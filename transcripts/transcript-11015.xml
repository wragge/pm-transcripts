<p>E&amp;OE.................................................................................................</p>
<p>MILNE:</p>
<p>Welcome, Prime Minister.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good to be here.</p>
<p>MILNE:</p>
<p>What are you proudest of in this budget?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Keeping all of our promises, without exception, from the last election</p>
<p> Â every last one of them delivered. Every last one of them. I'm</p>
<p> very proud of the fact that we can hold up the document saying ÂKeeping</p>
<p> Our Promises for a Stronger Australia.' Everything we took to</p>
<p> the Australian people we are implementing in this budget. And there,</p>
<p> of course, are two other things that, in a sense, surround the budget</p>
<p> that we took to the Australian people and the Senate willing will</p>
<p> implement those as well.</p>
<p>MILNE:</p>
<p>We might come to the Senate in a moment and this is a related question.</p>
<p> There's one thing I don't understand about this budget.</p>
<p> You've got a whopping surplus of $5.4 billion. Brian Harradine,</p>
<p> the Independent Senator who holds the balance of power up there in</p>
<p> the Upper House, only required another $100 million in compensation</p>
<p> for families to be satisfied and probably give you his vote on the</p>
<p> GST. Why didn't you give him that extra $100 million?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, you obviously know things about his intentions that I don't</p>
<p> and I think it's very unwise to ever sort of pass a sort of a</p>
<p> public observation on what he does in return for this or that. I mean,</p>
<p> he's a person, I've always found, who's committed to</p>
<p> good policy as he sees it. He's not a horse-trader. He's</p>
<p> somebody who has a strong set of attitudes and values, many of them</p>
<p> I share, some of them I don't, but that's in the nature</p>
<p> of politics. But that $5 billion surplus doesn't go a mouldering</p>
<p> in the bank. We use that to reduce our debt. There's a funny</p>
<p> idea around that if you have a surplus then it just sort of stores</p>
<p> up and nothing happens to it. It gets quickly used to pay previously</p>
<p> accumulated debt. And our Labor predecessors did a pretty good job</p>
<p> of doing that over the last few budgets with billions and billions</p>
<p> and billions of debt. But we're using that to pay debt.</p>
<p>MILNE:</p>
<p>So you're saying that the surplus is good for families as well,</p>
<p> that it's not just a...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I'll tell you what it does help to underwrite is lower</p>
<p> interest rates. And every family in Australia is $320 a month, on</p>
<p> average, better off because of low interest rates. I can't think</p>
<p> of a greater gift to Australian families from this Government than</p>
<p> lower housing interest rates. They've got the double whammy.</p>
<p> They've got rising real wages and they've got lower housing</p>
<p> interest rates Â more money in the pocket for the average family</p>
<p> as a result of good general economic policy. That in a way is the</p>
<p> best thing that this Government has done for Australian families.</p>
<p> We've kept inflation down. We've added to the real value</p>
<p> of average wages. And we've cut housing interest rates. Now,</p>
<p> those three things are really Â I mean, that is pure gold as</p>
<p> far as the benefits of good economic management are concerned.</p>
<p>MILNE:</p>
<p>Just coming back to Senator Harradine. He says you had a deal and</p>
<p> he says that you welched on it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, he doesn't say that. But, look, I'm not going to get</p>
<p> into a public dialogue about Senator Harradine. I talk to him from</p>
<p> time to time about a lot of things. I prefer to talk to people directly</p>
<p> and not via television or radio programmes. I keep my promises whether</p>
<p> they're made to Â no matter who they're made to. But</p>
<p> I'm not...</p>
<p>MILNE:</p>
<p>Well, why is he saying, why is he saying that you didn't?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Glenn, I'm not going to do what you're inviting me to do</p>
<p> and that is get into a dialogue regarding Senator Harradine.</p>
<p>MILNE:</p>
<p>I'm purely after an explanation because last night he held a</p>
<p> press conference here. He was obviously very angry and he said that</p>
<p> he voted for the original youth allowance bill on the understanding</p>
<p> that there'd be compensation in this budget for families and</p>
<p> he says he's been short-changed by $100 million.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, he didn't say exactly that but beyond that I'm not</p>
<p> making any comment.</p>
<p>MILNE:</p>
<p>Well, can I put to you that he did say: too little too late, nothing's</p>
<p> happening in this budget for families, it's improper what has</p>
<p> happened and I've let families down, I had no idea it would be</p>
<p> tied into the GST package...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, that's, with great respect, Glenn, that is not what you</p>
<p> put to me a moment ago and that is why I said...</p>
<p>MILNE:</p>
<p>Well, can I just...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, hang on, we'll just leave it at this, I'm not getting</p>
<p> into a dialogue with you or anybody else about the attitude of Senator</p>
<p> Harradine.</p>
<p>MILNE:</p>
<p>He's certainly chosen to enter into a public dialogue.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, that is his right and that's his choice. I choose to handle</p>
<p> things differently.</p>
<p>MILNE:</p>
<p>So will you be seeing him shortly to explain to him the way the budget's</p>
<p> structured and why it's good for families?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Glenn, I talk to him about a range of subjects from time to time but</p>
<p> I don't make a habit of disclosing the details of my diary in</p>
<p> relation to him or anybody else.</p>
<p>MILNE:</p>
<p>Your private health insurance initiative Â if I couldn't</p>
<p> afford private health insurance yesterday, what makes me able to afford</p>
<p> it today even though you've given a 30 per cent rebate?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Because you might give it a higher priority. The reason you can't</p>
<p> afford Â you couldn't afford it yesterday was that you chose</p>
<p> to spend the money on something else in preference to the private</p>
<p> health insurance rebate. Today you are faced with the possibility</p>
<p> that if you want it in 10 years time, when you're perhaps not</p>
<p> as healthy as you are now, it will be more expensive. So, therefore,</p>
<p> you might say to yourself, Âgee, it's more important to</p>
<p> stop that and go into private health insurance now than to add another</p>
<p> country to my next overseas trip.'</p>
<p>MILNE:</p>
<p>Well, your budget says unemployment is going to stay at around seven-and-a-half</p>
<p> per cent. If I lose my job after July 2000 next year and I have to</p>
<p> drop out of private health insurance, why should I be penalised?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, there is a provision which from memory Â and this is getting</p>
<p> into some of the fine Â from memory provides for a sort of a</p>
<p> total period of about 24 months of absences due to that sort of situation.</p>
<p> And we think that that can be the basis, providing a bit of a safety</p>
<p> net for that kind of eventuality. But one obviously has to guard against</p>
<p> people who deliberately hit and run.</p>
<p>MILNE:</p>
<p>Well, I was going to say, I mean, if you can drop out every two years...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, it will be put together in a way that gives people who are,</p>
<p> through no fault of their own, disadvantaged but at the same time</p>
<p> will prevent any hitting and running.</p>
<p>MILNE:</p>
<p>So you'll be making sure that you can't do that, sort of</p>
<p> drop out every two years and then join...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we're certainly not going to allow a hit and run approach.</p>
<p> On the other hand, you do have to cover genuine eventualities of the</p>
<p> type of which you described. And it will take a little bit of crafting</p>
<p> to get the right mix. But Michael Wooldridge has outlined that there</p>
<p> is a general concept of having that kind of safety net.</p>
<p>MILNE:</p>
<p>Given all the things that you've done for private health funds</p>
<p> to encourage people to join, will you now be putting pressure on them</p>
<p> not to increase premiums any further?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we've already done that. The increases are less frequent</p>
<p> now than they were previously and in most cases they're not as</p>
<p> great. But you cannot hold back market forces and increases that might</p>
<p> occur in the future, in the near future, are the result of the situation</p>
<p> some time ago, before the introduction of the 30 per cent tax rebate,</p>
<p> when there was a steady exodus of people from private health funds.</p>
<p>MILNE:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, we thank you for your time.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Pleasure.</p>
