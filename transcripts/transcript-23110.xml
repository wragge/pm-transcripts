    <content><![CDATA[<p>Strengthening our party is vital to the future of our organisation and the future ability of the party to provide good government for the state and for the nation.</p>
<p>We must ensure that the Liberal Party in NSW has an organisational structure that supports a greater say for members, improves connections to the community, and motivates a wider base of people to actively engage with the party in candidate selection and policy debate.</p>
<p>To continue the process of reform, the State Executive has agreed to immediately establish a Reform Blueprint Expert Panel of senior party leaders who will examine the party's processes for preselection of candidates.</p>
<p>The Hon John Howard OM AC has been appointed as Chair of the Expert Panel.</p>
<p>The Hon Philip Ruddock MP, Mrs Chris McDiven AM and the Hon Dr David Kemp will be the other members of the Expert Panel.</p>
<p>The Expert Panel will deliver a blueprint for reform to State Executive and State Council in March/April 2014, after which the members of the Expert Panel will spend a period of months engaging with party members and conducting regional forums to discuss their reform proposals.</p>
<p>It is our hope that this process will culminate in a proposal for constitutional change being brought to State Council by the end of the third quarter of 2014.</p>
<p>There is no person better placed to lead this process of reform than the Hon John Howard OM AC, Australia's greatest Prime Minister since Sir Robert Menzies.</p>
