<p>I will visit Indonesia from 16 to 18 September and Japan firom 18 to 21 September. </p>
<p>Visits planned for earlier this month had to be cancelled for family reasons. I am very pleased that it has been possible to reschedule them so soon. Australia has important shared bilateral and regional interests with Indonesia and Japan. I look forward to discussing these in Jakarta with President Soeharto and in Tokyo with the Prime Minister, Mr Hashimoto. </p>
