THE ACTING PRIME MINISTER ANT) MINISTER FOR TRADE<br />
ACTING MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS<br />
MEDIA RELEASE 2 July 1997<br />
DIPLOMATIC APPOINTMENT: AMBASSADOR TO THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF<br />
YUGOSLAVIA<br />
The Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, Tim Fischer, today announced the appointment of Mr<br />
Christopher Lamb as Australian Ambassador to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, with<br />
non-resident accreditation to Romania and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. Mr Lamb<br />
will replace Mr Noel Campbell.<br />
Australia's relationship with the countries of accreditation is based on community ties and<br />
commercial links. With exports increasing to $ 104 million in 1996, Romania has now surpassed<br />
Russia as our largest export market in Central and Eastern Europe and Australian investment there<br />
is also growing.<br />
The Australian Embassy in Belgrade, in close co-operation with Austrade representatives in the<br />
region, is working to identify new opportunities for Australian trade and investment in all three<br />
countries of accreditation, and in particular Romania where the Government believes there is<br />
greatest scope for commercial development in the short to medium term. More modest potential<br />
has been identified in the other two countries. Central to the Australian Governiment's role in the<br />
region is a continued and concerted effort to eliminate impediments to fair trade.<br />
Mr Lamb commenced work with the then Department of External Affairs ( 1968) in the Legal and<br />
Treaties Branch. After overseas postings in Australian Missions in Vienna, Rangoon and the<br />
United Nations New York, he was Minister in Bangkok as well as Permanent Representative to the<br />
United Nations Economic and Social Commnission for Asia and the Pacific ( ESCAP) ( 1984-86),<br />
Ambassador to Myanmar ( 1986-89). He was then Minister in Washington ( 1989-92), with<br />
responsibility for Congressional Relations. In Canberra his assignments have included Acting<br />
Head, Public Information Office ( 1974), Director, Foreign Service Training ( 1975), Head, United<br />
Nations Political and Legal Sections ( 1980-83), Assistant Secretary, General Legal and Immigration<br />
Branch ( 1983). He has been the Department's Legal Adviser ( including responsibility for<br />
Refugees Immigration and Asylum) since 1993.<br />
Mr Lamb is a graduate of the Australian National University.<br />
Mr Lamb is expected to take up his appointment in August 1997.<br />
