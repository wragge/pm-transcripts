TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER ON AM 21 AUGUST 1985<br />
BEUTLER: Mr Hawke, the first reaction to this Budget has been<br />
favourable. How much can we rely on the underlying assumptions<br />
of growth, employment, inflation and value of the dollar?<br />
PM: Well I think we can rely on them entirely. Wc have put an<br />
enormous amount of work into this Budget. As you know, we started<br />
work on it much earlier than usual. We really began the processes<br />
almost a month after the last Budget and I think through the<br />
prolongation of those processes including the very substantial<br />
achievements in the May Economic Statement this is a better<br />
prepared, n. G. e thoroughly thought through Budget than there<br />
has been in living memory.<br />
BEUTLER: No rubbery figures?<br />
PM: No rubbery figures. obviously, let me make this point<br />
that it is understood the 4.9 billion deficit is in there on<br />
the assumption that one must properly make that the Arbitration<br />
Commission will continue its existing principles, that is the<br />
full indexation, but we have made it clear that we will argue<br />
for discounting and in that sense if we are successful, then<br />
as the Treasurer pointed out in his Budget speech, the deficit<br />
would come up to about 54 billion.<br />
BFUTLER: Well that question of wage discounting, of course,<br />
is critical and already Simon Crean from the ACTU has repeated<br />
the union movement's total opposition to discounting. Why are<br />
you persevering on this what appears to be a collision course<br />
with the unions?<br />
PM: Let me make it clear that I think Mr Crean has made a<br />
broader statement than that., A'ind Mr Dolan, the current President<br />
of the ACTtJ, who perhaps in the past has been somewhat more<br />
unbending in his approach on this, I think has very responsibly<br />
indicated that there may be, from their point of view) a capacity<br />
to accept the approach as there should be. Well, ultimately<br />
you'll have to listen to the full bench of the Conciliation and<br />
Arbitration Commission because they will have to make the decision.<br />
I believe that they should make a decision in line with our<br />
submission.-Because I want to make it clear, as Mr Keating did<br />
last night, that the Government remains fully committed to<br />
the basic principles of the Accord, that is, through time the<br />
maintenance of real living standards. But what we are saying is </p>
<p>2.<br />
that the whole of Australia, including not only those who are in<br />
the work force now bud.-those who want to enter into the work<br />
force, have an enormous opportunity for the creation of very many<br />
more jobs if we rete'in the competitive advantage provided for us<br />
by the very significant devaluation that's taken place. And I<br />
believe that in the discussions that we had both with the ACTU<br />
and the employers that they will all see the wisdom of the approach<br />
that we are putting in the Budget.<br />
BEUTLER: Will you offer the. ACTUJ a tax cut in return for wage<br />
discounting? PM: We will not be discussing on this programme or anywhere else<br />
the overall strategy that we will be adopting in the future in<br />
this area.<br />
BEUTLER: But is that an option?<br />
PM: Well, living standards are made up of disposable income and<br />
in that sense it is always a fact that what people are able to<br />
take home in the post-packet situation is what determines<br />
relative standards. But I am not in any sense indicating the<br />
range of avenues that are available. I mean, the Budget speech<br />
doesn't refer to the spinning out of the productivity case. That's<br />
obviously one of the areas that we will be talking about but<br />
I'm not on this programme going to be developing the whole range<br />
of discussions that we'll have to hdve ith employers and trade<br />
unions to give continuing effect to the outstanding economic<br />
success that we have had to this point.<br />
BEUTLER: Well, how far are you prepared to push this issue,<br />
as far as to effectively destroy the Accord?<br />
PM: I don't believe that the Accord is in danger of being<br />
destroyed. BEUTLER: Why not?<br />
PM: For the reasons I have put. That is, that I believe that<br />
we have delivered the goods, that is, 410,000 new jobs. I believe<br />
the trade union movement shares the commitment of this Government<br />
that the No. 1 priority is the creation of the maximum number of<br />
job opportunities for their fellow Australian men and women.<br />
BEUTLER: When it comes to the crunch would you accept anything<br />
less than full discounting?<br />
PM: We will be putting the case for discounting as I have said.<br />
The ultimate decision is the decision of the Arbitration Commission.<br />
BEUTLER: Don't you run the risk, if you push this whole issue<br />
too far, of powerful unions getting their wage rises elsewhere<br />
by going outside the centralised wage system?<br />
PM: Well, let me say this. That from day 1 in the election<br />
campaign at the beginning of 1983 people were saying you won't<br />
be able to make the Accord work. It is just an election gimmick.<br />
I have said from day 1 it will work. It has worked with<br />
spectacular success, success increasingly acknowledged overseas.<br />
We have the Financial Times. Wde now have the latest issue of the<br />
Economist pointing out that the rest of the world should be<br />
looking at what we have achieved. Now, we have achieved this </p>
<p>3.<br />
/ 7because we have been able to persuade the whole community including<br />
the trade union movement of the correctness of our policies.<br />
We have got the runs on the board. No one is entitled now, it is<br />
getting rather boring if I may say so ankd tedious for people after<br />
two and a half years of spectacular success to say ' Oh, it might<br />
not work'. It has worked, it will continue to work.<br />
BEUTLER: Well, the lower deficit means less Governmenit borrowing.<br />
That should mean lower interest rates, when?<br />
PM: Well, let me say this, I am not going to be making predictions<br />
because I don't think that's helpful but I will say this and say<br />
it with pride that as a result of the decisions we* ye made not<br />
only in this Budget but prioi. to the Budget, Government has taken<br />
all the action that is within its power to reduce the pressures<br />
in the capital markets on interest rates. We had a magnificently<br />
successful outcome from the Premiers Conference in getting their<br />
co-operation. I pay tribute to them and as a result of what they<br />
have done in containing their borrowing requirements and as a<br />
result of the enormous reduction in our deficit there will be a<br />
significant reducti~ on in the public sector borrowing requirement<br />
as you indicate. That means as far as the factors within our<br />
control, we have created the situation for the least possible<br />
pressures upon interest rates.<br />
BEIJTLER: And you won't any predictions?<br />
PM: Well, it is not proper but all I can say, I want to say ittis<br />
not proper in the immediate environment of the Budget. I don't<br />
want to be saying something which is going to perhaps of itself<br />
have a positive or negative effect. What I can do in conjunction<br />
with my Treasurer and my colleagues is to make the decisions which<br />
creates the best possible environment for the lowest practicable<br />
level of interest rates. We have done that.<br />
BEUTLER: Mr Hawke, you are about to address this ALP breakfast<br />
in Melbourne your home city and you have brought some of your<br />
most senior Ministers from Victoria here this morning......<br />
PM: When you say I brought them, physically they travelled with<br />
me. They were bursting out of their skins to come.<br />
BEUTLER: Well, you have got a good new story to tell this morning.<br />
How much is that undermined by the factional fighting going on<br />
here within the Victorian branch of the ALP at the moment?<br />
PM: I know you are a member of the media and you do your job<br />
well. But one day you people will come to understand that<br />
Mr and Mrs Australia and young Australians are concerned about<br />
jobs, are concerned about growth, are concerned about economic<br />
performance. That is what will determine their position and their<br />
judgment about the magnificent achievements of this Government<br />
and by the way also by way of contrast to those pusillanimous<br />
non-entities that occupy the benches opposite us in the Parliament<br />
and where they will continue to sit because of the their economic<br />
and social irrelevance. </p>
<p>4<br />
' 3EUTLER: Well if you have got the economic runs on the board.<br />
What are you going to do about the Australian cricket team?<br />
PM: Well, now you are talking about an area of very great<br />
difficulty. This Government is capable of solving most of the<br />
problems confronting this great country but you are now putting<br />
your finger on an area where I haven't got any instani: or even<br />
medium term solutions. It was an enormous thrashing that we<br />
received. I think we should be sensible enough to recognise the<br />
fact that it was a thrashing. The better side in that test match<br />
won. I say to Allan Border who has developed into a great captain,<br />
I say to him get them together, make them realise they've got the<br />
potential to win that last and deciding one and I wish them the<br />
best of luck.<br />
BEUTLER: Mr Hawke, thank you for joining us. </p>
