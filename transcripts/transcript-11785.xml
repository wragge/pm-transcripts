    <content><![CDATA[<p>Subjects: petrol prices; American-Chinese relations; Cheryl Kernot; election campaign</p>
<p>E&amp;OE................................</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister is the issue (inaudible) that the price of petrol (inaudible) almost nine cents a litre, the oil companies are being accused of Easter profiteering. What's your response to that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well that is something for the ACCC to chase and I hope they chase it hard and if it's happening the oil companies should be dealt with.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>(inaudible) about the first home buyers scheme, Mr Prime Minister, do you (inaudible).</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>My understanding, and I said I'd check it, my understanding is the rules require, well entitle people who have not previously owned a home to have it.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister you would welcome the end of the spy stand off between the United States and China.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I think everybody will welcome that and it does represent a good outcome. It means that as a result of patient diplomacy, and dealing with things in a measured, controlled way, a good outcome can be achieved. And I welcome the fact that the crew of the American plane will be reunited with their families for Easter. It's also a matter of sadness that the Chinese pilot died and I'm very sympathetic to his family. Relations between the United States and China are very important and I think it reflects credit on the leadership of both countries that the matter appears to be on the road to resolution.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister we're told that the Labor Party is furious with Cheryl Kernot for refusing to back down over her comments that leaders of the major parties are boring (inaudible) in suits.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I think you're witnessing the working out of quite a lot of tension inside the Labor Party on this issue. I think it's one of those things where I'll just let the Labor Party, I'm sorry I can't.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Did Cheryl Kernot get it right do you think?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I'm sorry, can you repeat it? That noise.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>There's anger in the Labor Party, Cheryl Kernot apparently got a ticking off by a member of Mr Beazley's staff, she's released details of that to the press. She's not backing down at all. Did she get it right do you think?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well look I'm not a political commentator, I have a point of view on different things and I think that's a matter for the Labor Party to sort of wallow in and deal with itself. I'm amused by it, but I'm not going to make a political commentary on it.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Do you think now Cheryl Kernot's wishing she hadn't switched sides?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh I think there's always a bit of a hint of regret in a lot of these statements she makes. But that's a matter for her to resolve. I'm not particularly fussed by it, it remains an internal, area of internal tension within the Labor Party. It's a matter for them to deal with.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, Mr Beazley has said that a long drawn out election campaign is bad for the economy, would you go along with that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well he's the person who announced it at the beginning of the year when he released his, what did he call it, my plan for our nation. He said this is the beginning of Labor's campaign. I mean the person who's talking everyday about us being in an election campaign is Kim Beazley, it's not John Howard. What I am doing at the moment is what I normally do, this is my normal pace. I've had doorstops with you in this very spot before. I mean the person who is talking everyday about the election campaign is Mr Beazley, I mean he's the person who sets fire to the house and then calls the fire brigade, it's the arsonist claiming respectability as a fire-fighter. I mean he started the long election campaign by that declaration at the beginning of the year. And I don't talk about it being an election campaign. I'm continuing to govern, we're continuing to take decisions. The election will be held when it's scheduled , and I know Mr Beazley sort of doesn't want to be pressured into releasing any policies, but gee give us a break, he's the bloke who started the campaign and he's got to put up with the consequences and the speculation that he himself started.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>But he's also said that you wouldn't be in WA if this wasn't an election campaign.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well that's just wrong and insulting. I visit Western Australia regularly. I mean the person, the Prime Minister who didn't visit Western Australia regularly was my predecessor, he once went 13 months I think without coming here. I come to Western Australia on a very regular basis, he knows that, he shouldn't tell porkies to the Western Australian public on that subject.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, Mobil is reportedly training contract labour in Sydney to act as strike busters at an Adelaide plant. Is that an IR strategy that your government would support?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I know nothing more than what I read in the Australian and I'm not going to comment on that.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
