PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF JOINT PRESS CONFERENCE DAWKINS, WILLISJanuary<br />
1985<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
Although this Government has been able to arrest the<br />
massive explosion in youth unemployment which characterised<br />
particularly the last two years of the Fraser Government, we as<br />
with the rest of the community are still concerned with the<br />
dimension of this problem. And it was for this reason, of course,<br />
that we commissioned reports by Mr Peter Kirby and also had the<br />
OECD Report both of which we've recently received. Since the<br />
election we've given this issue top priority. The Ministers<br />
concerned have been, with their Departments, examining the reports<br />
and the Social Policy Committee and the Cabinet yesterday<br />
considered these matters and arrived at decisions which have just<br />
been endorsed by the fully Ministry. The Kirby Report, as you're<br />
aware, covers a wide range of matters and, indeed, its 86<br />
recommendations in all cover the whole range of labour market<br />
programs. For the most party Kirby recommends refinements to<br />
existing arrangements, to focus them more closely on what he has<br />
identified to be the major need of labour market programs at<br />
present that is, to provide adequate training and skills<br />
development for unemployed people. Now without any question the<br />
central recommendation of the Kirby Report is his proposal to<br />
introduce a system of traineeships starting with 16 and 17 year<br />
olds involving, as you know, formal broad skills training both on<br />
the job and off the job in conjunction with paid employment. Now<br />
the Government considers this proposal in the Kirby Report as a<br />
very imaginative response to the current disadvantages that young<br />
people currently face in gaining broad experience and training ana,<br />
life skills, and'as well the proposal calculated to make a<br />
significant contribution, we believe, to improving Australia's<br />
skill level and competitiveness. It's certainly a proposal from<br />
the Kirby Committee which is consistent with the approach of the<br />
OECD in stressing that youth unemployment will not be solved<br />
without raising youth skills and productivity. And so the<br />
Government has endorsed the principle of traineeships recommended<br />
by the Kirby Report. And we see broad skill-based training, which<br />
is involved in the proposal, as one way to improve the<br />
opportunities open to young people in the labour market, and<br />
especially for young people who have experienced prolonged </p>
<p>P. M. cont: unemployment or who are otherwise disadvantaged. Now<br />
it's quite clear, as you'll appreciate, that implementation of e<br />
proposal will require considerable consultation with the<br />
employers, the trade unions and with the States and the relevant<br />
educational institutions so that there can be a fleshing out of<br />
the proposal and an identification by us of the courses open to us<br />
to implement the concept. And the Ministers will be immediately<br />
undertaking those consultations with a view to Ralph Willis, the<br />
Minis Ãµ ter for Employment and Industrial Relations, bringing before<br />
the Cabinet as soon as possible a more detailed proposal as to the<br />
method of implementation of the proposal. I'd say to you that he<br />
will also in conjunction with the other relevant Ministers be<br />
looking at the other proposals contained in the Kirby Report so<br />
that the appropriate response of Government can be determined to<br />
those proposals. And as part of a consideration of the issues<br />
raised -by ' Kirby * and the OECD -and -our own work there will be an ongoing<br />
examination of the whole range of income support supplements<br />
available to young people so that appropriate decisions can be<br />
made which fit in with the thrusts of the Kirby and the OECD<br />
Reports. That's all I want to say at this stage and not only I,<br />
but my Ministers, are available to any questions you'd like to<br />
address to us.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke do you embrace of Mr Kirby's proposal. He<br />
was talking about 75,000..<br />
He was talking abo'ut 75,000 by the year 1988. Part of what<br />
the Minister will be doing in his consultations with the employers<br />
and the trade unions and the States will, in part, be related to<br />
the feasibility of the program in terms of numbers. Kirby and his<br />
committee have talked about 75,000 by 1988 as you appreciate. Now<br />
the Minister will be looking at that to see if that's possible, or<br />
more. What you will appreciate is that our determination of the<br />
numbers that can be handled will depend upon the sort of answers<br />
that we get from the people with whom he'll be consulting that<br />
is, the employers and the unions you've got to see what sort ofC<br />
response there is in the various sectors of industries towards a<br />
proposal to try and form some sort of judgement as to whether that<br />
sort of number or more will be able to be-taken . ip. And also<br />
you'll appreciate that it involves the capacities of institutions<br />
within the TAFE set-up to handle numbers. So it's these sorts c-F<br />
consultations which will determine numbers, but we would hope that<br />
that sort of figure of 75,000 by 1988 can at least be achieved.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, do you foresee any problems with the trade<br />
unions in negotiating the concept of a training wage given their<br />
suspicions.. All that I can say about that, and perhaps Ralph may like<br />
to add something to what I say, is this that the only public<br />
comment I have seen has been from Mr Kelty, the Secretary of the<br />
ACTU, and he has said, as I understand the report, that the ACTU<br />
is not opposed to the concept of the traineeship proposed by<br />
Kirby. He's flagged naturally enough that the unions will wish to </p>
<p>P. 14. cont. consulted. But I take that statement by the<br />
Secretary of the ACTrU as indicating prima facie support. And that<br />
doesn't surprise me because in all the discussions that we've had<br />
with the ACTU, both prior to coming to Government and since we've<br />
been in Government, indicates the very real concern they have<br />
about the levels of unemployment generally and of youth<br />
unemployment in particular. So I expect that they will take a<br />
positive approach to this matter and you must remember that the<br />
ACTU was represented on'the Kirby Committee by Mr Harry<br />
Hauenschild. WILLIS: I'd just add to that Mr Kelty has directly confirmed to<br />
me that that's his view.<br />
JOURN ALIST: Mr Hawkrle one option which the Cabinet Committee was<br />
looking at over the last day-or so was the possibility of means<br />
testing unemployment benefits for young people possibly lowering<br />
the level of them. Is that going to be looked at further in this<br />
study of other proposals.<br />
Well let me make it quite clear that neither the Committee<br />
nor the full Ministry has in any shape or form endorsed any<br />
proposals for reductions of any benefits. But what we, with<br />
responsibility, have had to do is to say is well, now once you've<br />
had both the OECD and Kirby externally and our own IDC looking at<br />
the issue, the whole range of income support measures, we've got<br />
to, and we are asking, for further reports to us on it. Because<br />
what's got to be done is to have dispassionate look at the<br />
relationships that exist between various income support<br />
measures, both within the education system where there's a whole<br />
range of inconsistencies within the education area as far as<br />
income support mechanisms are concerned, and also to look at the<br />
relationship between them and unemployment benefits. So no<br />
decisions have been made about reductions of any benefits. It's<br />
rather what we're looking at is to see, as I say as<br />
dispassionately as we can, what are the relationships and what is<br />
the impact of those relationships upon the broad thrusts of policy<br />
which are determined by the Government in the light of its<br />
acceptance of the Kirby Report that is, that we have got to<br />
adopt policies which are going to maximise the capacity of young<br />
people for education and training to equip them for future<br />
employment. And-inevitably, any Government that has, once you've<br />
made that decision, that you're going to attack that problem and<br />
try and achieve those results, then inevitably you must have a<br />
look at the relationship between the various income support<br />
measures. But there has been no decision of any sort in regard to<br />
reductions of benefits.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Dawkins, I was wondering if I could ask you what's<br />
your view on making more flexible wage-fixing levels for young<br />
people? DAWKINS: Well I think the approach that's been decided by the<br />
Government is to pursue the question of traineeships. It's </p>
<p>important to recognise that both the Kirby Report and the OECD<br />
DAWKINS cont both rejected the notion that the level of youth<br />
wages is the prime cause of the level* of youth unemployment. And<br />
that's a view which I agree with.<br />
JOURNALIST: But Mr Dawkins, without it necessarily being the<br />
prime cause, do you figure there might be some case for more<br />
flexibility in certain industries with regard to time of the day<br />
and all that kind of stuff, where some impetus might be given for<br />
the creation of new jobs particularly-for younger people.<br />
DAWKINS: I think the approach that's been taken is to indicate<br />
that what's important in terms of getting young people into the<br />
labour market and keeping them in the labour market is a level of<br />
training. And that's the important question which has been<br />
referred to us by both -of-th-ese reports. That's why Ralph and the<br />
rest of us are going to be looking very carefully at the proposals<br />
of traineeships, the central part of which of course still has to<br />
be negotiated with the unions and the employers.<br />
WILLIS: Can I just add to that that we've already got<br />
considerable flexibility or variation in the level of junior<br />
wages. In a study of the 60 major awards by my Department, we<br />
found that the junior rates expressed as a percentage of the adult<br />
rate varied from 38% to 75% for 16 year olds and from 42% to<br />
for seventeen year olds. ., Now those variations reflect all sorts<br />
of things and in the development of the trainee wage we'll have to<br />
industry-by-industry assess what was the way in which that wage<br />
was previously developed, whether there is built in there the<br />
concept of some adjustment of that wage for training which takes<br />
place and then an assessment of the trainee wage and make a<br />
decision about whether there needs to be any reduction in that<br />
wage to take account of the fact that whilst young people are on<br />
the job they are going to under the trainee concept be being<br />
trained on the job and not just working productively all of that<br />
time. In some cases wage rates already take account of that fact,<br />
in other cases they obviously don't.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Willis what can we do about Mr Ki. rby's suggestion~<br />
that apprenticeships are a very expensive way to subsidise fulltime<br />
training and his suggestion that there be a review of<br />
apprenticeship rates.<br />
WILLIS: Well it is true that apprenticeship involving payment to<br />
the apprentice for time off the job is expensive in the sense that<br />
that is pretty well recompensed to the private employer by the<br />
federal Governmment which costs us some $ 76 million and therefore<br />
the expansion of that kind of training would become very expensive<br />
for us indeed. The trainee concept doesn't involve the Government<br />
in any payment to employers for time off the job because young<br />
people will not be paid for time off the job. So in that sense i<br />
guess we are recognising that we can't as a society afford to<br />
extend the apprenticeship concept. And I think that Mr Kirby is<br />
right in saying with scarce resources it's not possible for us to </p>
<p>considerably expand the training effort on the apprenticeshic<br />
1/ WILLIS cont model. And therefore if we are going to do it a,,<br />
we should, and we agree with him that we should, then hav,. e to<br />
find another more cost effective way. I think what lie's prop,: 3.,-d<br />
is a very cost effective way and one which we intend to pursue.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Willis, how long do you expect the con~ sultation<br />
process to take and is the Government into the consultations with<br />
a view already formed.<br />
WILLIS: Well we have a view, as the Prime Minister has said, that<br />
we support the traineeship concept in principle.<br />
JOURNALIST: I mean more detail.<br />
WILLIS: Obviously theT~:-are'-many--practical difficulties in the<br />
development of the concept. We at this stage have had no<br />
substantial discussions with any of the interested bodies. Now in<br />
the next month and a half we will have an array of discussions. I<br />
will have discussions with the National Labor Consultative<br />
Council, with national employer and trade union<br />
organisations, through the meeting with State Labor Ministers in<br />
early March I'll have discussions with the State Labor Ministers<br />
and also there'll be a national training conference on the<br />
and 21st of February organised by the National Training Council<br />
which will involve the whole training network under the NTC and<br />
also State training authorities, the Commonwealth Department of<br />
Education, TAFE and other interested bodies. So that by early to<br />
mid-March we will have had extensive consultations in my area and<br />
also my colleague, Susan Ryan, the M4inister for Education, will be<br />
having consultations with State Ministers for Education and other<br />
education authorities, so that in the next month and a half we<br />
will have a pretty good idea what reactions are to the concept<br />
from all interested groups and then develop the concept from<br />
there.<br />
JOURNALIST: What's really in it for the employer?<br />
WILLIS: For the employer there is the chance to have a more<br />
skilled workforce available without any additional cost to him.<br />
Now I would have thought that from the employers' point of view<br />
there is a lot tcs be said for having a more skilled workforce<br />
without him having to face considerable extra costs to achieve<br />
that. The costs of training off the job will not be a cost to the<br />
employer. The training on the job will involve perhaps some cost,<br />
but insofar as that involves less production to him that will be<br />
picked up in the concept of the training wage. So really this is<br />
not going to be a cost imposition on employers. And the Kirby<br />
concept is one of the h~ eed to share the costs equitably between<br />
government, employers and trainees. The employers will have-to<br />
provide some training and so therefore there is some element of<br />
cost there. But other than that I think that it's not an<br />
imposition on employers and, of course, we very much hope that<br />
they will accept this as something which is in their long-term </p>
<p>WILLIS cont interests in having a more skilled workforce.<br />
It's also, if I may just add very briefly, that they were<br />
also represented, as you'll appreciate, on the Kirby Committee.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Willis how will industrial type unions be invovied<br />
in the planning of this training wage.<br />
WILLIS: Well Kirby I think at one stage refers to industrial<br />
negotiated wages but at my discussions with him clearly his<br />
concept includes arbitration if the parties couldn't agree. What<br />
we'll clearly have to have is assessment award by award of what<br />
the trainee wage should be in the light of the training contract<br />
which has developed in that particular industry and in the light<br />
of the existing pattern of junior wage rates which exists in that<br />
industry. And so it will1-not be someth-ing which has developed at<br />
an across the board sense. It will have to be developed indus try<br />
by industry, award by award. So it's going to be quite a lengthy,<br />
time-consuming process. And as the Prime Minister said we're not<br />
looking at having this in place until really 1989 because, as<br />
Kirby says, you shouldf k have the objective by the end of 1988 of<br />
having the 75,000 traineeships. So it really is almost the end of<br />
the decade before the thing is fully operational.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Willis was there any decision taken to-help<br />
unemployed people of the age of say 18 and<br />
WILLIS: Well at this stage, I mean we are looking at developing<br />
the traineeship for 16 and 17 year olds. Kirby clearly<br />
contemplates that it can go beyond that, but I think we have to<br />
crawl before we can walk, we'll get the traineeships going for the<br />
younger people first and then look at developing it for others.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, Mr Kirby found that there were probably 1.2<br />
million unemployed in Australia. Do you accept that figure or do<br />
you think it is exaggerated?<br />
What you have got to appreciate is that it has been<br />
consistently understood that the official figures for unemployment<br />
don't fully state the unemployment situation. That has been true<br />
for a considerabl-e period. Now there would be some debate about<br />
the assumptions made which have you arrive at the figure that you<br />
mention of 1.2 million. The point I make, I repeat from the<br />
beginning and this is why it somewhat sticks in the craw to have<br />
our Liberal and National Party opponents talking about this<br />
problem as though they can come to it with clean hands. They are<br />
the guilty people of politics in this area. And let me remind you<br />
of the sort of change that has taken place since we came into<br />
power. Between March ' 81 and March ' 83, if you look at the<br />
centrally important figure of 15-19 year olds looking for full<br />
time work in that period between March 81-83 the percentage of<br />
young people in that category looking for full-time work increased<br />
from 16.4% to 27.4% and there was an actual increase of over </p>
<p>50,000 in the numbers in that category. That was their<br />
contribution in the area of youth unemployment in their last two<br />
years of office. Between March ' 83 and December ' 84 that figure<br />
has dropped from 161,000 down to 122,000. The percentage from<br />
27.4% to Now the point I am making is that it is still too<br />
high, both for young people and older people. And that is why we<br />
are directing ourselves here, in the field of education and the<br />
various relevant areas to do even more with the support of the<br />
community to tackle this problem. But in the current political<br />
situation I find it a little short of obscene that you can have<br />
the Liberals and the National Party in Victoria saying, look at<br />
this terrible problem. It was a problem which exploded under<br />
their stewardship federally and state. We have reined the problemnin<br />
but we are not satisfied. We are going to do more to ensure<br />
that what is a fundamental problem confronting the whole community<br />
is going to be tackled-an'd we hope that-it will be tackled not<br />
just with the resources of government, but with the full support<br />
of the trade union movement, the employers organisations, the<br />
States and the educational institutions.. It is an issue which<br />
transcends political considerations and I hope we will have the<br />
support of the whole community. Because-whatever the figure is<br />
and there can be debate about the precise figure, in reality it is<br />
too high.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Willis, you talked about canvassing attitudes in<br />
the next six weeks, can you tell us if you envisage a specific<br />
time when you will take this issue back to Cabinet?<br />
WILLIS: I have no specific time, Alan, but I don't wish to drag<br />
the anchor at all on this. As soon as I am in a position to come<br />
back to Cabinet with a clear process as to how we can further<br />
develop the traineeship concept, then I will do so. So I would be<br />
certainly looking to do so within the next two or three months at<br />
the outside.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, what sort of timeframe are you looking at<br />
for the dealing with the other Kirby and OECD recommendations?<br />
Well, I think, let me answer it and then pass it over to my<br />
Ministers. I have expressed the hope in the expe-ctation that it<br />
will be dealt with as quickly as can be done. But you will<br />
appreciate I think the number was 86 recommendations in all in<br />
Kirby so that is going to take some period of time. I don't<br />
know Ralph, or you John, whether you can add to that, but I feel<br />
not competent because what is involved is the discussions by Ralph<br />
and John and Susan Ryan in a number of areas and I don't know<br />
whether you can add anything to it. It is a matter of urgency as<br />
far as we are concerned, consistent with the work that has to be<br />
done and negotiations with other relevant bodies.<br />
JOURNALIST: For example, might you be ready by Budget time to<br />
introduce a rationalised income support system do you think? </p>
<p>DAWKINS: Certainly our aim in relation to the incoiia-sun-port<br />
arrangjements would be to have any new operations or any new;<br />
arrangements in operation for 1986.<br />
Yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: I imagine that quite a few of these new positions for<br />
traineeship might be in service industries. Are there any<br />
disruptions within the Government to-reconsider the idea of the 9-<br />
five day week outside of which penalty rates start applying?<br />
WILLIS: Well this is not considering that issue. This is a<br />
process of developing training and training doesn't exist at the<br />
present time at the sub-trade occupational level and it is a quite<br />
different thing that we are considering from the question of<br />
penalty rates. We will---start-ddscxssing -now a particular<br />
issue.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you mind saying something about say someone was<br />
learning to be a chef or something like that and had to be doing<br />
it in the evening. That would start to be an area where you could<br />
see occurring.<br />
WILLIS: Well the question of penalty rates is one which comes up<br />
from time to time. The problem with that is that, as a study at<br />
Monash University showed, even if you abolished penalty rates you<br />
would still have to pay people more to work at hours when people<br />
generally don't want to work you know, late at night, at<br />
weekends and public holidays and so-on. And so they felt that you<br />
end up with much the same pattern of wages as you have with the<br />
formal existence of penalty rates. There have been other studies<br />
by the NLCC, the Queensland Industrial Commission, and so on, all<br />
of which have come to pretty much the same conclusion. I think at<br />
this stage we need to have some more compelling evidence that<br />
penalty rates are something that we need to tackle as a major<br />
problem in the employment field. At this stage I am not convinced<br />
that it is.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime minister, could I ask a question on another<br />
matter? I am open . to questions on other matters, but can I just<br />
find out whether there are any more in this area. If not, yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: I was wondering whether you have had any discussions<br />
at all, or proposed to have any discussions with the Queensland<br />
Premier and remind him about the boundaries of his<br />
responsibilities? I think in this area h-e has been a somewhat quicker learner<br />
than he has been in other areas after the making of gaffs. I<br />
think it has been gently pointed out to him that he is out of<br />
his province and from the interests of Queenslanders<br />
themselves, particularly the sugar industry, that his sally into </p>
<p>P. M. cont...: the area of foreign affairs has been singularly, or<br />
would be singularly counter-productive. So, I think good sense<br />
would prevail. We have seen another-example of his idiosyncratic<br />
tendencies. I think those around him, if not from the point of<br />
view of intellectual considerations issues, but if only from the<br />
point of view of self-interest, have pointed out what he should<br />
do.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, are you certain ' that your letter to<br />
Mr Lange hasn't inspired him to bring forward the idea of<br />
legislating to prevent ships of nuclear varieties coining to New<br />
Zealand? Yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Min-ister,.-was th-er-e : wny criticism of that<br />
letter....... No. We are going well, aren't we.-<br />
JOURNALIST: Have you had any response yet from Mr Lange?<br />
Not that has been brought to my attention and I imagine<br />
that if there had been a response, it would have been.<br />
JOURNALIST: Did the American Government in any way try and get<br />
you to write the letter?<br />
No, of course not. Really that is somewhat of an insult to<br />
the American adm-inistration. I am used to being insulted ryse3. f<br />
I mean that is part of the game we play with one another but<br />
they would have more sense than to suggest such a thing and I, of<br />
course would not accept such a suggestion. There was made clear<br />
in the statement that I issued a while ago after the letter had<br />
been or the thrust of the letter had been leaked somewhere else<br />
that in no sense was I acting as an emissary for anyone and<br />
has been made quite clear from the beginning of this matter. T11e<br />
issue is one between New Zealand and the United States and I di6<br />
no more than to indicate to my good friend David * Lange that I was<br />
going to the United States. I explained the position to him, as<br />
had exactly in August in Port Moresby when we met and I was<br />
wanting to know exactly what his position was so that when I was<br />
in the United States I would be totally au f-ait with the position.<br />
JOURNA LIST: Did the subject sorry, were you going to go on?<br />
No, I think I have adequately covered it, don't you?<br />
JOURNALIST: Was the subject of ANZUS canvassed in any way at the<br />
Ministry meeting?<br />
No. Let me be fair. I mean I don't want to appear as<br />
though I've got off some imagined hoof that might be hanging<br />
around out there. The Ministerial meeting hasn't finished, and so </p>
<p>if you have had some indication from some quarters that these<br />
things are going to be raised, your exPectations are not<br />
necessarily frustrated. I mean, I am going back.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, why was it necessary to release a<br />
paraphrase of the letter? It seems a bit unusual.<br />
Well the Unusual features of this began when somewhere cls<br />
there was a release, either of the letter, or of an indication of<br />
its contents. I strictly followed the proprieties, as I always<br />
do, and I wrote privately to the Prime Minister of New Zealand,<br />
and that was it. Now, we were faced with a situation w. here, for<br />
reasons of which I am unaware, the letter Or an indication of its<br />
contents were made available elsewhere. That generated some<br />
speculation, totally ill-founded, both as to purpose and to<br />
content and it seemed the best interests of Australia were served<br />
by me bringing an end to that ill-founded speculation. I did<br />
that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you think it was leaked in Australia?<br />
No, I don't. Have you got different ideas?<br />
JOURNALIST: No<br />
I mean, if you have, I would be interested to know. That's<br />
all.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, do you-believe the Lange Government<br />
will change its mind?<br />
I don't know, and I have said from the beginning that this<br />
is a matter for the Government of New Zealand. That has been my<br />
position, the position of the Government of Australia, from the<br />
very beginning. It is a matter for them. I have not sought<br />
either in writing that letter or in any other way from the day I<br />
first spoke with Mr Lange in New Guinea to try and tell them what<br />
they should or had to do. It is a matter for New Zealand. That<br />
is how it has been from the beginning. That is the way it should<br />
remain.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you think that the Left is over-reacting then by<br />
placing it upon the agenda for tomorrow's meeting?<br />
What meeting tomorrow is this? It is their meeting. I<br />
would think that they should put on the agenda of their meeting<br />
whatever they want to put on. They have never asked me for advice<br />
as to what they put on their agenda. It would be rather<br />
interesting if they started doing it, but they haven't. There is<br />
no Caucus meeting tomorrow. You don't want to believe the press.<br />
JOURNALIST: Inaudible. </p>
<p>The Left I don't mind what they put on their agenda.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, on another [ matter, does the Cabinet subcommittee<br />
agree with Western Australian proposed land rights bill?<br />
I think I heard something about Holding up there, so<br />
perhaps with what is the last question and answer we can bring it<br />
together. The position is this that in regard to the matter of<br />
the veto rights of aboriginals, our position was made clear at the<br />
latter part of last year. The joint statement by myself and Mr<br />
Holding and Mr Burke and that is that we would not be supporting<br />
that right of veto. Let me make clear that that was in the<br />
context that there should be an appropriate tribunal mechanism<br />
where the rights of people concerned, including aboriginals, to<br />
put a point of view about the utilisation of land for mining<br />
purposes would be ava-i-lable. A-nd ' at the meeting that we had the<br />
other day the points of agreement between us and the West<br />
Australian Government were made clear. There was no argument<br />
about that. There were other areas in which there was not<br />
agreement and in which there is to be further discussion between<br />
us and the West Australian Government following further<br />
consultation with the interested groups. Now, that is the<br />
position. It is quite clear. </p>
