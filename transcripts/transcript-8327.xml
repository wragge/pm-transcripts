TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH PRIME MINISTER AND JOHN KERIN<br />
RAY MARTIN MIDDAY SHOW, SYDNEY 28 AUGUST 1991<br />
E OE -PROOF ONLY<br />
MARTIN: Would you please welcome the Prime Minister Mr Hawke and Treasurer John Kerin.<br />
My apologies for the faux pas John.<br />
KERIN: That's alright Derryn.<br />
MARTIN: Thanks for that. Mr Hawke thank you for the time, both of you. I hate to hit you<br />
with a poll straight away but The Australian's got a poll out today that says, a national poll that<br />
says that only 7 per cent of Australians believe the Budget's going to do them any good. Has it<br />
been a marketing and media disaster?<br />
PM: No it hasn't. It's never easy selling a Budget and John had the, I think the additional<br />
difficulty this time of the succession and obviously people were looking at a lot of it through the<br />
prism of comparison. I think a difficult job has been done well.<br />
MARTIN: Was it basically a Keating Budget as Mr Willis has said?<br />
KERIN: It was a Government Budget. The Expenditure Review Committee, which is what puts<br />
the Budget together, we'd worked out the strategy when Paul was there. But it was a Government<br />
strategy and it's very appropriate for these times. If you haven't noticed we do have a recession<br />
and there's not goodies.<br />
MARTIN: I've certainly noticed. I think most of us are aware of that. But what about the<br />
suggestion, this line that Brian Howe has used that it's not the time for a song and dance man.<br />
Could you have sold it better?<br />
KERIN: I don't think' you can really get into a lot of glitter when we have to spell out quite a few<br />
hard messages. But there's real reform in this Budget and there's real social justice in this Budget<br />
as well the families package, the reform through the superannuation, the fact that we are<br />
cementing in Medicare, all of these things continue a lot of reform.<br />
MARTIN: Can I ask the audience, I haven't asked them before, but do you, was there social<br />
justice? Did you see that or did you see reform in the Budget?<br />
AUDIENCE RESPONSE<br />
MARTIN: Alrighit, some yeses, some nos. But my question I guess is that it gets back to selling<br />
it, that there wasn't a memorable line. This obviously is written by bureaucrats, but there wasn't a<br />
memorable line in the speech, there wasn't any, you've now got to put a white paper out on<br />
superannuation. I don't think the message got out of reform.<br />
KERIN: There's a lot of detail in superannuation and this is something that has to be really tidied<br />
up in a way because about 70 per cent of people are now in superannuation funds. There's about<br />
over $ 3 billion worth of taxation concessions and we are now getting it right through to all the<br />
wage and salary earners. We just have to take this decision now because this is a decision for the<br />
next century. So the white paper is to make sure we get it right. </p>
<p>MARTIN: Alright. Mr Hawke you've attacked the Press coverage for being mindless and plain<br />
stupid. PM: Some of it, some of it.<br />
MARTIN: It's also been were there exceptions?<br />
PM: Yes indeed there were. I mean yes indeed there were, I mean there were a lot of favourable<br />
comments. My point was that, particular point, and you won't find me in this thing getting into a<br />
whole lot of jargon because I don't think that's appropriate. My basic point was this, that some<br />
people were saying there wasn't any, this was a stand still Budget because there was no vision for<br />
the future. I was making the point, and I haven't been able to be challenged on it by anyone. I<br />
spoke at the Financial Review dinner on the Wednesday night and I've spoken elsewhere. I said<br />
1991 is the year of the greatest reform, not just in this Government, but since the War. The<br />
Budget was the third step which followed the March Statement, the Special Premiers' Conference<br />
process and this. We're just transforming this country in a whole lot of areas. The<br />
superannuation reform is historic. But that was only part of it. We've got the Special Premiers'<br />
Conference where we're wiping out conflicting State regulations, where we're having a National<br />
Rail Freight Commission, a National Road Transport Commission, bringing these things<br />
together, a National Electricity Grid Commission which will mean we'll save billions of dollars in<br />
stopping this replication of investment, one State doing what it needn't do, where you can share<br />
electricity between States, historic reform in the area of tariffs. Now all these things are going at<br />
break-neck speed because we've got to go at break-neck speed in changing this country. I mean<br />
if I can leave this session with these people with one statistic in their mind, in all your viewers,<br />
it's this, and it's the most important statistic for all Australians. We are 17 million people in a<br />
world of five and a half billion and we have to become competitive. The world isn't going to give<br />
us a living. What John Kerin is about as Treasurer and I am as Prime Minister and my Cabinet, is<br />
making a whole series of decisions which is going to make this 17 million people a great 17<br />
million, tremendous capacity, but we've got to be able to run this country in a way which makes<br />
us competitive with social justice. And that's what it's about.<br />
MARTIN: But they remain words. You don't think that we've numbed by promises and lies and<br />
deceit in some cases? They're words that you can now utter but where's<br />
PM: But they're not words.<br />
MARTIN: But where's the indication that people understand it? The polls show 7 per cent of<br />
Australians believe that that Budget offers them anything.<br />
PM: There are two different things, two different things. You say whether they are words and<br />
whether they understand it. They're not words. I mean I<br />
MARTIN: If they don't understand it, who are you talking to?<br />
PM: Whether they are words or not I'm simply saying we are doing the things. I mean in the<br />
March Statement, the tariff reform not words, actions. The reform of the taxation law not<br />
words, action. And the same thing with the Special Premiers' Conference, all the things I've<br />
listed. They're not words, they're actions.<br />
MARTIN: But apart from that poll, Bob, it's been bucketed. The Budget has been bucketed by<br />
the media. It's been bucketed by business. It's been bucketed by welfare groups. Even the<br />
ACTU and Bill Kelty.<br />
PM: By some of them, by some of them.<br />
MARTIN: Pretty general.<br />
PM: But two different propositions.<br />
MARTIN: But are they all wrong and you're right? </p>
<p>PM: They are wrong insofar as they say that action has not been taken.-Certainly you're wrong if<br />
you're saying it's words. These are not words. These are a range of decisions, including in this<br />
Budget that John's brought down, the superannuation reform which is the most important<br />
decision that's been taken<br />
MARTIN: You both know better than I do that politics is about perception. Now you can sit<br />
there and say this is t~ he biggest reform that we've had in 1991. If the mob out there watching<br />
this, if the business, if the ACTLJ, if the welfare groups, if they think it's not reform<br />
PM: The answer to t~ hat is very simple.<br />
MARTIN: Where are you failing? Not getting the message out.<br />
PM: Well politics is about perceptions. Before the 1987 election, well before it, people were<br />
saying you're dead. People were saying the same sort of thing, well do people understand what<br />
you're about. Look ait the polls. They were saying it before the 1990 election. What I say is this.<br />
When the people have to cast their vote in 1993 they are going to be casting a vote in regard to a<br />
Government which will have done more in terms of economic reform and social justice than any<br />
other government in the history of this country.<br />
MARTIN: So this is done for ' 93 rather than ' 91?<br />
PM: It's done not just for ' 93, it's done for the year 2003.<br />
MARTIN: Would you agree Mr Kerin with Bill Kelty and with Bob Carr that you're a spent<br />
force, you're dead to use the PM's words, if you can't get unemployment under 10 per cent by<br />
1993? KERIN: We will get it under 10 per cent by 1993, there's no two ways about it.<br />
MARTIN: Significantly?<br />
KERIN: To alarge degree. It will certainly be pointing in the right direction. T1here's no two<br />
ways about that.<br />
MARTIN: Are you dlead as a Party though, as a Government if you don't do that?<br />
KERIN: No. When you see the Opposition and see some of the things they're promising the<br />
people, they have absolutely no compassion knock off unemployment benefits after nine<br />
months, bring in an extra big tax, cut Government spending, cut all the welfare out that really<br />
affects people we've got a better than good chance. But it's not just on that negative ground. It<br />
is what we are actually doing. We've got so much on the agenda that sometimes I think people<br />
just don't understand it. And if they just want froth and bubble in the middle of the situation we<br />
are now, to go through all that mad excesses of the 1980s, they are not thinking very straight at<br />
all. MARTIN: You see I keep coming back to my first question. I mean you keep saying that froth<br />
and bubble is not good enough, song and dance is not good enough, we need more. Now that's<br />
fine, we can all agree, but why aren't you getting the message out? Why are the polls so bad in<br />
terms of Budget?<br />
KERIN: The world knows it.<br />
MARTIN: The world knows it. Australians don't. 17 million Australians don't seem to.<br />
PM: That's not right. If you look back at the period of the past, I mean I look at the future in<br />
terms of reading whai:' s happened in the past. I can point to you in the period between the ' 84 and<br />
the ' 87 election where we made decisions and tough decisions and the polls were awful because<br />
people didn't like the immediate impact of tough decisions. </p>
<p>MARTIN: I'm not talking of popularity now, I'm not talking about the Government. I'm talking<br />
about the Budget, the understanding of the Budget.<br />
PM: And I'm talking about the same thing, about where we've made tough decisions and there've<br />
been polls about it and people didn't like it. But as they came to understand it, in the end, look<br />
don't let's jargonise about this. In the end what Government is about and what elections are about<br />
is people making a decision between alternatives. They'll have to make a decision in 1993<br />
between a Government which in employment terms has had an employment record better than<br />
the rest of the world, which has brought prices down. We inherited<br />
MARTIN: But you've got almost one million people out there watching this out of work. I mean<br />
how can you say<br />
PM: I know there are and we have well the answer to that has been, as you know again without<br />
blinding you with statistics, if we hadn't slowed the economy down the world would've imposed<br />
a much more drastic solution We had to slow it down. But what is the Opposition doing?<br />
They are offering policies which will increase, dramatically increase the level of unemployment<br />
in this country. It's inevitable that their policies would do that. But what would they do then<br />
about looking after those people you're talking about? They are saying bye bye unemployed,<br />
we'll increase the numbers of you, we'll give you benefits for nine months but after nine months<br />
you're off. No benefit from the community. Now that's the judgement that the people are going<br />
to have to make Ray.<br />
MARTIN: Alright, OK. I keep referring to the 7 per cent poll which is just one poll but that's<br />
their understanding of the Budget. Let's move on. Does this bloke, does your future depend on<br />
this bloke selling this Budget?<br />
PM: My future is connected with this bloke in some respects. I mean a Treasurer in any<br />
Government, in any Australian Government certainly, is a very important part of that.<br />
MARTIN: Are you good mates?<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
MARTIN: You told us you are good mates the last time we were together with you and Paul<br />
Keating. PM: We're good mates. But let me say it's not just of course I'm good mates with him. But it's<br />
not just the Treasurer in whose hands the Government is. We've got a team, a team may I say<br />
which is essentially the same team which was described in 1987 by Hewson as the best<br />
Government in the post-War period of Australia, essentially the same people.<br />
MARTIN: But you're talking today about a team that is tattered around the edges, if not in<br />
tatters. PM: I said there were some tatters around the edges, yes, because I don't like the proposition<br />
that's occurred in the last few days where there was a little bit of selective Cabinet leaking.<br />
There's no way I can, as Prime Minister, say in front of an audience like this, audience, it's a good<br />
thing if I have a Minister doing a bit of selective leaking. It's not. And so I've said so. That<br />
doesn't look good and it isn't. It'll stop.<br />
MARTIN: Alright. It will stop will it?<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
MARTIN: I might come back to it in a moment. Can I just ask, in terms of straight talk you said<br />
no, you're both emphasising no jargon in this Budget and straight talking<br />
PM: Well we try not to. </p>
<p>MARTIN: Why did you decide to drive yourself? Why did you get rid of the chauffeur and the<br />
Ford Fairlane?<br />
KERIN: It's a long story.<br />
MARTIN: Can you keep it short.<br />
KERIN: My electorate is closer to Canberra than any other Minister's. So I have a house in<br />
Canberra and I have a house in my electorate. The white cars cost an awful lot of money.<br />
MARTIN: How much? How much do they cost?<br />
KERIN: Well they cost over $ 100,000 because the charging system is crazy.<br />
MARTIN: $ 100,000 a yeair.<br />
KERIN: Yes. So I just lease a car from the Commonwealth Car pool and drive that. That costs<br />
the taxpayers a whole lot less. Eight kilometres from work I live and it's just nonsense to sock<br />
the taxpayers with $ 100,000 when you don't need to.<br />
MARTIN: Well you're the boss, why don't you do that with all your Ministers? Why don't they<br />
all get rid of $ 100,000 a year car?<br />
PM: He just explained, he's just explained that it's not as easy for all of them.<br />
MARTIN: Why? They all live in Canberra.<br />
PM: They don't all live<br />
KERIN: No they don't.<br />
MARTIN: You mean from your electorate to Canberra etc.<br />
PM: He lives in Canberra, his home's there.<br />
MARTIN: But you say you couldn't do that. You think even those who rent a flat or rent a<br />
house in Canberra that they need Commonwealth cars?<br />
PM: In that period in Canberra I suppose some of them could. Some of them mightn't have the<br />
same degree of confidence they have in their driving as this bloke has.<br />
MARTIN: But Bob, I mean, you are fair dinkum.<br />
PM: Yes of course I am.<br />
MARTIN: At this stage here's a bloke who's your Treasurer, he's our money man. He says look<br />
it's good enough for me to save $ 100,000 and drive myself in these tight times<br />
PM: But listen to what he says. He said it's easier for him to do it in respect of his total operation<br />
because he lives in Canberra than it is for others.<br />
MARTIN: So you don't think you could do it with the other Cabinet Ministers.<br />
PM: Look, let me say this. In terms of a budget, you know, of over $ 100 billion, what perhaps<br />
would be saved at the edge by another couple of Ministers doing a John Kerin I admire him for<br />
what he's doing but what<br />
MARTIN: It'd be good PR. It'd be a good sign, a good symbol.<br />
KERIN: You see I'm in a different situation. It's quicker for me to drive from my electorate<br />
down to Canberra where I have my other house, two and a half hours, whereas you've got to </p>
<p>allow so much to drive from Campbelltown into the airport. So I use my private car there and in<br />
Canberra I just use a lease car. It makes sense.<br />
MARTIN: I'm not going to get anywhere on that obviously. Do you think that banks are<br />
bastards? KERIN: I didn't say that.<br />
MARTIN: You didn't. I thought you didn't you, you're quoted, I was reading the quotes last<br />
night of you saying it. We can't believe the quotes?<br />
KERIN: No you can't. I never said that at all.<br />
MARTIN: What did you say roughly that said that?<br />
KERIN: Well the report was, it was a purely private conversation, we were looking at the article<br />
by Christopher Skase who said that he blamed the Government, the airline pilots, the<br />
communists, for all his troubles and I said yes people like him treated us like mugs, the banks<br />
went along with it and we're all paying now. So that got translated by the media that I was saying<br />
the banks are mugs.<br />
MARTIN: Bastards was the word.<br />
KERIN: No it was not.<br />
MARTIN: Alright. You've got a reputation as being the clown prince of Parliament. Has<br />
Treasury made Jack, or John in this case a dull man?<br />
KERIN: No, I have a good sense of humour but I'm basically very serious about things. I don't<br />
think now's the time to be jocular about matters economic. I find there's nowhere near as much<br />
source for humour as there are with the farm animals and all that.<br />
MARTIN: So no mesmerising of chooks or magpies these days?<br />
KERIN: No, no. I've knocked off the public performances there.<br />
MARTIN: Alright we'll leave it. Let's leave it there for a moment. We'll take a break and come<br />
back and talk about leadership with the two gentlemen in a moment.<br />
COMMERCIAL BREAK<br />
( Grab of Brian Howe comments)<br />
MARTIN: PM, why did your Deputy, Brian Howe, feel the need to say that publicly?<br />
PM: Because in recent days there's been, some silly things have happened. There's been as I said<br />
earlier some selective leaking of what went on in Cabinet. The Deputy<br />
MARTIN: By whom?<br />
PM: Well I'm not going to name names. It happened and I'm saying to you I believe it will stop<br />
now. MARTIN: But you've both said to me, Mr Howe just last week, that in fact it's the Press that's<br />
been obsessed with the leadership troubles, in the Labor Party it's not a problem.<br />
PM: No, the situation was that I believe that the Press has certainly played a role and naturally<br />
enough has been very interested. I mean whether it's been on my side of politics or others, if<br />
there's any suggestion of leadership challenges they read everything through that particular prism.<br />
That's one issue. </p>
<p>MARTIN: ( Inaudible)<br />
PM: Wait a minute. ' rhat's one issue. On this one it reached a point where there were selective<br />
versions talked about of what had happened in Cabinet. Now that properly upset the Prime<br />
Minister, the Deputy P rime Minister Brian Howe, and has upset the Prime Minister too I might<br />
say. As a result of that there are some certain things, quiet discussions have taken place. I don't<br />
believe that will happon again. As far as I'm concerned that's the end of that. It's got to end<br />
because if that were to go on, if you were to have selective leakings of what went on in Cabinet,<br />
or particular coloured versions of what went on, you can't have stable government on that basis.<br />
Now it was serious. I could've tried to say oh it didn't happen or don't let's worry about it, so<br />
could Brian Howe. It's much more honest to say that's not good, it's got to stop, it will stop.<br />
MARTIN: You also s; aid that someone would talk to Mr Dawkins.<br />
PM: I said there'd be some discussion. I'm not saying anything more publicly about it. I'm<br />
simply saying publicly I believe this will stop.<br />
MARTIN: But you've raised it, you see. It wasn't the Press raising it this time. Mr Howe raised<br />
it and you raised it yesterday at the Press Conference.<br />
PM: Yes I was at a Press Conference. I was asked a question about it. I gave an answer there.<br />
As far as I'm concernied I've given the answer and it will stop.<br />
M. ARTIN: We spoke to Mr Dawkins' office this morning. No-one's spoken to him.<br />
PM: Well, time for that to happen.<br />
MARTIN: Is it tough trying to sell a Budget when all you read in the papers is about a leadership<br />
crisis still, three months after the event?<br />
KERIN: I don't think that's anything new. There are some people in the Press Gallery in<br />
Canberra who think there is-only one story around, that everything is put through that filter.<br />
MARTIN: Hang on John. This was Mr Howe and Mr Hawke, the number one and number two<br />
in the Party who raised it. It wasn't the Press.<br />
KERIN: I think the comments by Mr Dawkins first raised this after stories in the papers. I was<br />
going to go on to say that of course there are some people who are doing things that are silly. But<br />
obviously there are some parts of the Press that are obsessed as well.<br />
MARTIN: Let's have a look at what Mr Dawkins said.<br />
( Grab of Dawkins' comments)<br />
MARTIN: Have you heard from Mr Keating given the fact he delivered eight Budgets before<br />
you? Have you spoken to him at all since the Budget?<br />
KERIN: Yes I have spoken to him since the Budget.<br />
MARTIN: Can you tell what did he did he like the Budget?<br />
KERIN: Well it was at a party in Ross Free's office and we just had a chat.<br />
MARTIN: Did he approve of the Budget?<br />
KERIN: Yes of course.<br />
MARTIN: And have you spoken to him Mr Hawke?<br />
PM: No. </p>
<p>MARTIN: Do you blame Mr Keating for this destabilisation, this leadership trouble now?<br />
PM: No, I'm not about attributing blame. I have no evidence that Paul is instigating anything or<br />
trying to stoke fires. But there are a few people with some passions and I think the priorities need<br />
to be sorted out. I think they will be. But my major concern in this is in ensuring that the<br />
Cabinet functions effectively and I challenge anyone, you, anyone else to give one shred of<br />
evidence, one piece of evidence, that Ministers are not doing their job and that Government is not<br />
performing. It is. There is more being done by this Government than ever before.<br />
MARTIN: But if Ministers are leaking Cabinet documents they're not doing their job are they?<br />
PM: That's a nonsense to say that if in 24 hours of a day a Minister takes one minute to leak<br />
something that he's not doing his job. I mean that is statistically a nonsense and you'll appreciate<br />
it. It doesn't mean that it's helpful if he does it. But it doesn't mean that he's spending the other<br />
23 hours not doing his job. The fact is that Hewson made one of the few correct political<br />
judgements of his life when he said just a few years ago that this is the best Government since the<br />
War, the best Cabinet, the best talent. He was right. It's substantially the same Government now.<br />
It is doing more in 1991 in this year than has ever been done in important areas of reform than by<br />
any other Governument in the post-War period. Those are the facts. We're not being helped.<br />
We're not being helped by these things that are happening. They will come to an end.<br />
MARTIN: That's it. We won't hear any more of that. You wouldn't like to get rid of Mr<br />
Dawkins from Cabinet?<br />
PM: No, I've got no desire or intention to get rid of Mr Dawkins or anyone else. But if we had a<br />
situation where X, Mr X or Ms X, we've only got one, if any member of the Cabinet were<br />
identified as doing that sort of thing again then that would be a different story. I don't think it<br />
will happen.<br />
MARTIN: If they were identified as doing that sort of thing they would go?<br />
PM: I don't think they would have a brilliant future.<br />
MARTIN: What about the future for Mr Hewson then? He got<br />
PM: Don't de-doctor him. Dr Hewson.<br />
MARTIN: Alright, Dr Hewson. He got the public gallery applause, he's had<br />
PM: If I bring in, if I busload in the members of the Labor Party branches and can't get an<br />
applause out of them I'm going bad.<br />
MARTIN: It was stacked was it?<br />
PM: They've got to do something right.<br />
MARTIN: What about the suggestion that he made, that in fact this Budget is all about you<br />
saving your job, that you're a captive of the Left wing?<br />
KERIN: Cheap..<br />
PM: Cheap, irrelevant nonsense. What the job of the Leader of the Opposition is, particularly in<br />
tough economic times, is to give an alternative strategy. In that speech there was not one word,<br />
not one sentence, not one paragraph which said what he'd do. The only conclusion that you could<br />
draw is in terms of the things that he has talked about, that is slashing another $ 3 billion of<br />
expenditure, is more social hardship, more unemployment and indeed a situation where the<br />
economy would have to get worse and the people within this economy who most need help, the<br />
unemployed, would be thrown off without any assistance after nine months. Now when Dr<br />
Hewson starts to give the details of what he would do I tell you what, we're waiting. And we'll<br />
be waiting with pleasure. And I'm sure the people in this audience will be waiting with pleasure<br />
to see how he will justify a proposition that he will make these people and those dependent upon </p>
<p>them, he'll make thei pay 15 per cent tax on necessities of life, your milk, your food, your visits<br />
to sport and so on, other things that are not taxed now, he'll whack 15 per cent on those so that he<br />
can make their luxury cars cheaper, bring down the tax from 30 per cent to 15 per cent, so he can<br />
shovel billions of dollars into the pockets of the already privileged in this community and make<br />
these ordinary people pay. Now that's when we'll have the interesting political debate and I'm<br />
waiting for it. So is John.<br />
MARTIN: You mentioned cheap shots. What about your Ferrari jibe at Dr Hewson? For a man<br />
who's just paid $ 1.4 million for a harbourside house isn't that a little bit hypocritical?<br />
PM: Well, you know, I'm nearly 62. Nearly 62. And look at it, very, one of the most beautiful<br />
positions in Sydney, a ve, modest house. I'm 62. I sold a house in Melbourne and I've taken<br />
out a whacking big overdraft, a whacking big overdraft. And I have nothing to apologise<br />
MARTIN: No no-one asked you to. But similarly he earned that money to pay for his Ferrari.<br />
Why should you take a jibe at him?<br />
PM: What I am saying is this, very clearly in regard to Dr Hewson compared to Bob Hawke, is<br />
this is a man of many mansions, many mansions if I can use the biblical phrase<br />
MARTIN: You had a place' in Melbourne with a tennis court and a swimming pool. You didn't<br />
live too poorly.<br />
PM: Yes I did, but let me finish. I mean you haven't had this habit of interruption before. Let<br />
me say<br />
MARTIN: You have a<br />
PM: Let me make the point. The man of many mansions, the restaurant owner who was, the<br />
man of many cars, that:' s alright. I don't criticise him for that. But what I do criticise him for is<br />
this. If you're going to have your mansions, you're going to have your Ferraris, have compassion<br />
for those who are not as fortunate as yourself. What compassion is there in a man who says in<br />
respect of hundreds of thousands of unemployed after nine months, after nine months you will<br />
get no benefit at all. Now that's what I'm comparing. I don't condemn Dr Hewson for having a<br />
Ferrari as such. But what I'm saying is what he is about in this country, what he represents is<br />
propping up, adding more privilege to those who are already privileged and making the poor and<br />
the middle income pay for that transfer of more wealth. He would abolish<br />
MARTIN: Hang on, let me just here rather than interrupt you. But there are close to one<br />
million Australians who would say to you two blokes you didn't show me much compassion in<br />
that Budget last week, I didn't get much compassion, I'm 100 per cent out of a job.<br />
PM: What we would say is this, that we have brought down inflation from nearly 11.5% that I<br />
inherited MARTIN: It doesn't help if I'm one of the million out of a job though.<br />
PM: What it does mean is that we will be able to bring down the level of unemployment, we'll<br />
have a more competitive Australia. It's on that basis that we will create jobs that will be secure<br />
and competitive jobs. Thiat's what the relevance of what we've done is.<br />
MARTIN: When is that? I'm confused about that. You say that the second half of this financial<br />
year. PM: Second half of this financial year.<br />
MARTIN: You say not for two years.<br />
PM: No it will start in the second half of this financial year.<br />
KERIN: (( inaudible) </p>
<p>MARTIN: When will we get below 10 per cent then, unemployment?<br />
KERIN: We believe we'll be getting below 10 per cent by about this time last year next year<br />
sorry, and then it will continue.<br />
MARTIN: Airight, so we'll go to ten and three quarter per cent and it will come down?<br />
KERIN: Yes it will peak at about, we think it will peak at about ten and three quarter this year,<br />
the average through the year will be ten and a half per cent, it'll be below the ten and a half per<br />
cent by middle year and then through ' 92-93 it will come down gradually.<br />
MARTIN: We're almost out of time but I had a number of questions here. One was written by<br />
rye misplaced the card now but who wrote, here we go. A question from someone who said,<br />
exactly on compassion, is it Will Hancock? Put your hand up. It's written here by one of the<br />
audience. It says what are you doing for unemployment for young Australians, which is So<br />
what are you doing for young Australians? Obviously there are lots who sit at home watching<br />
this program.<br />
PM: The most important thing that we're doing is to massively increase expenditure on programs<br />
for education and training and re-training so that in this period where there is a relative lack of<br />
employment opportunities they are going to be able to develop the talents they've got so that as<br />
the economy does come up they're going to be better equipped to get them.<br />
MARTIN: there'll be no jobs for them though. The trouble is they go to university and there<br />
are no jobs.<br />
PM: It simply is not true. We're not going to stay in recession any more than the United States is<br />
going to stay in recession. Australia is sharing this difficulty with the United States, Canada, the<br />
United Kingdom. We're going to come out of recession. The responsibility for Government is to<br />
make sure that you spend money now on programs for the young people and not only the young<br />
because remember middle aged people also have a problem in regard to unemployment, very<br />
much so. And you've got to have programs that in a time of recession give them the opportunity<br />
for training and retraining so that when the jobs come, as they will, they are going to be better<br />
equipped to get them. That's what we're doing for young people.<br />
MARTIN: Alright. Just finally the last, I think the hottest political issue in Australia at the<br />
moment is guns. Now we saw you emotional about Tienanmen Square and the massacres there.<br />
We've seen you emotional about other things. Are you emotional about this? The fact that 700<br />
people a year die from guns and we have no national gun laws, no national register for guns?<br />
PM: More important than being emotional about it, what I've done is to suggest to the Premiers,<br />
because in the end this is a matter of state laws and I think your audience here and outside would<br />
agree that part of the problem is within the States there is political, you know, lack of perhaps<br />
courage or determination, they're not quite sure where the votes are and so on. I've put it on the<br />
agenda, the whole question of violence in Australia, I've put it on the agenda for the Special<br />
Premiers' Conference in November in the hope that with a national thrust we can do something<br />
about it.<br />
MARTIN: With respect, Mr Hawke, I was on your national committee on violence for the year<br />
of 1989. We spent a year going around the committee. That's your national committee.<br />
PM: Yes.-<br />
MARTIN: Now the recommendations went through to you 18 months ago for a national gun<br />
law, for a national register, for control. What's happened in 18 months.<br />
PM: But you understand what's happened is that the governments, that is not the<br />
Commonwealth Government, the action<br />
MARTIN: But where's the national law? Where's the national register? </p>
<p>PM: There isn't a under the Constitution it requires the action and laws of the State<br />
governments and what I'm saying to you is that due to a lack of political will within the states the<br />
governments that have got the responsibility who must pass the laws won't do it. That's why I'm<br />
going to take the lead in November and say come on you've got to act. And it will probably be<br />
easier for the States t~ o act under that national thrust. T'hey'll be looking at one, will you do it,<br />
yes, yes, yes, if they'll all do it, and governments of different political persuasion we might get<br />
somewhere. MARTIN: We might. I mean, is there a fire in your belly?<br />
PM: I can't change the Constitution.<br />
MARTIN: But you have fire in your bellies about other things. Is there a fire in your belly about<br />
this one. Would you like<br />
PM: I can't change the Constitution. I have not got the constitutional power to pass laws<br />
MARTIN: You're the Prime Minister. You're the Prime Minister leading a government. Your<br />
position are you in favour of gun laws?<br />
PM: I am in favour of gun laws.<br />
MARTIN: No guns?<br />
PM: I am in favour of bringing in tougher legislation in this country in the States that have got<br />
the constitutional responsibility<br />
MARTIN: Be specific, be specific.<br />
PM: I'm being specific.<br />
MARTIN: Semi-automatic rifles, would you ban them?<br />
PM: I am being quite specific. If I had the position of authority in the States I would pass laws, I<br />
would pass laws if I were a State Premier.<br />
MARTIN: You're the Prime Minister, Bob.<br />
PM: But it is no good. saying that.<br />
MARTIN: What's your position? Tell me what your position is.<br />
PM: I'm telling you my pos ' ition. My position is quite clearly that I have not got under the<br />
Constitution the power to pass the laws. That is an authority with the States.<br />
MARTIN: Forget the Constitution.<br />
PM: I will not forget the Constitution.<br />
MARTIN: Well hang on, hang on. Well I accept what you've said there but Bob Hawke<br />
PM: Well thank you.<br />
MARTIN: Bob Hawke the man. Are you<br />
PM: I would pass laws if I were a State Premier<br />
MARTIN: Are you in favour of banning semi-automatic rifles?<br />
PM: I would I would </p>
<p>MARTIN: You won't answer me. You won't answer me.<br />
PM: I'm telling you if I were the State Premier who had the power to pass laws, yes of course I<br />
would. MARTIN: So you'd ban semi-automatic rifles?<br />
PM: I would ban them. I think that what has happened in this state of New South Wales<br />
MARTIN: And in Victoria.<br />
PM: And in Victoria well can I finish? In this State and in Victoria what has happened<br />
particularly in this State and in Victoria, I mean, is something of which we should be ashamed.<br />
And I believe that the States who have the responsibility should pass the laws which prevent it<br />
happening and I as Prime Minister am doing now what I can to give the vehicle for the States to<br />
do it. I can do no more than that. I'm going to do that. I'm going to bring them together and try<br />
and get themi to do it and I hope that with some sensible pushing from people and programs like<br />
yourself and others that the State Premiers who have the responsibility will have the courage and<br />
the support of their oppositions I might say, which is important, that both sides of politics at the<br />
State level will have the commitment and the courage to pass the necessary legislation.<br />
MARTIN: Can you see any reason for guns in Australian cities?<br />
PM: I don't.<br />
MARTIN: Do you have guns John?<br />
KERIN: No, no.<br />
MARTIN: But as a farmer you didn't have guns?<br />
KERIN: When I was a farmer I did, yes. Not these semi -automatics, of course<br />
MARTIN: But see that was my question, Bob. As just basically again it seems we always ask<br />
politicians, yes they're all in favour of mother and apple pie and goodness. They all would like to<br />
see things that happened in Strathfield last week not happen again but are you prepared to put<br />
your name and position on the line personally and I understand the Constitution<br />
PM: I've done it. I've done it.<br />
MARTIN: about things like banning guns, of banning semi-automatic guns, of getting a<br />
national register.<br />
PM: I will create, I will create the conditions where those who can pass the laws which isn't<br />
me I'll create the conditions where if they've got the will and the commitment, the courage and<br />
hopefully the support of their respective oppositions that they will do it.<br />
MARTIN: Alright, you're not passing the buck?<br />
KERIN: Ray, could I just make one point?<br />
PM: They pass the laws.<br />
MARTIN: But you're not passing the buck to the States?<br />
PM: I'm not passing the buck. Will you please accept that we are federation where the Federal<br />
Government cannot pass laws on these matters, only the States can. I will create the conditions<br />
where they will pass the law if they've got the will to do it.<br />
MARTIN: John, you're </p>
<p>KERIN: Can I just make one point?<br />
MARTIN: Please.<br />
KERIN: The Labor Party lost every country seat in New South Wales bar one in 1988 because<br />
the Labor Party was running on gun laws and that was exploited, has been continued to be<br />
exploited by the conservative forces playing up to the gun lobby.<br />
MARTIN: But does that mean we let Strathfield happen because you lost some seats?<br />
KERIN: No it doesn't. What the Prime Minister explained is the States have the powers. There's<br />
no sense just one State: doing it alone, they've all got to do it.<br />
PM: They've all got to do it.<br />
KERIN: The Commonwealth's got to give the lead otherwise they'll just come in through<br />
whichever State doesn't go along with the uniform legislation. So we've always got to get<br />
something uniform right across Australia and the Commonwealth can only try and get them<br />
together and that's what the Prime Minister is saying.<br />
PM: If you want to help in this<br />
MARTIN: I desperately want to help.<br />
PM: Well okay.<br />
MARTIN: As I'm sure you do.<br />
PM: Well I do. So if you really want to help, face up to what's the fact and not the emotion that<br />
we've got<br />
MARTIN: I'm not emotional about this, I'm very factual.<br />
PM: Well I am emotional and factual. But let's together do something about it. Let's together<br />
with whatever power you've got and it's very considerable between now and November, this is<br />
the real thing you can do, the real thing, between now and November use your powers of<br />
persuasion so that politicians from both sides of the fence at the State level are going to be so<br />
moved that by the time they meet with me in November they will be persuaded that what the<br />
people of Australia want in every State is the relevant legislation. That's what you and I can do<br />
together. So let's do it.<br />
MARTIN: I'd love to do it.<br />
PM: Okay. Thanks.<br />
MARTIN: Last word Bob, you spoke to George Bush this morning. What did he have to say?<br />
PM: Well very quickly<br />
MARTIN: last words I know.<br />
PM: very quickly. He talked about what was happening in the Soviet Union. We agreed<br />
MARTIN: He rang you did he?<br />
PM: Yes, he rang me. But may I say also as well as talking about the events in the Soviet Union<br />
I raised with the President the fact that we were tending in all the drama of what's happening in<br />
the Soviet Union and what's happened there is the most, one of the most important things that's<br />
happened in this century but we're tending to overlook another tragedy in Europe and that's<br />
Yugoslavia. It's a tragedy what's happening there. Every day people are being killed in what, </p>
<p>could escalate into a very violent conflict. I suggested to the President that while the Europeans<br />
have been tryig haud and I congratulate them, they don't seem to be terribly successful in getting<br />
a basis of resolution. I said I think the time's coming when we may have to try and, together,<br />
perhaps take some initiative in the United Nations to get a basis of trying to solve that dispute<br />
because we've got a quarter of a million of our fellow Australians who come from that country.<br />
It's a tragedy for them. It's a tragedy for the people there. I think really we're going to have to try<br />
and do something through the United Nations on this he agreed.<br />
MARTIN: Yes. It's dreadful. We wish you both well in selling the Budget. Obviously every<br />
Australia, all 17 million of us need it to work and work properly so we wish you well. Thanks<br />
for your time.<br />
PM: Thank you.<br />
KERIN: Thank you.<br />
