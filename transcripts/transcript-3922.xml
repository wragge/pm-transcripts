Press Statement No. 577<br />
16 October 1975<br />
GRAHAM4 PERKIN<br />
I knew Graham Perkin well and was shocked and saddened<br />
to hear of his death.<br />
He was an outstanding journalist and a brilliant editor<br />
whose integrity and professionalism and extraordinary capacity<br />
for work made the Age one of the great newspapers of the world.<br />
Australian journalism can ill afford tbeloss of a man of<br />
his ability and independence of mind.<br />
I offer my heartfelt sympathy to his widow and family.<br />
