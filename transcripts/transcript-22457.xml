    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Government will introduce legislation to:</p>
<p> adjust the level of superannuation for Parliamentarians elected at the 2004 Federal election and subsequently so that it is the same as that paid to Commonwealth public servants, that is 15.4 per cent.</p>
<p>  make provision for a resettlement allowance at the rate of three months ordinary backbench salary in circumstances of involuntary retirement (loss of party endorsement  and/or defeat at the subsequent election) for Parliamentarians elected from 2004 and onwards and also for those elected at the previous election and affected by the prohibition on accessing entitlements until age 55.</p>
<p>Parliamentarians fully covered by the previous scheme would not qualify for these initiatives because they benefit from existing arrangements.</p>
<p>These initiatives follow a joint approach by the Chief Government and Opposition Whips to the Remuneration Tribunal.</p>
<p> The Leader of the Opposition has indicated to me his agreement to, and support for these proposals.</p>
