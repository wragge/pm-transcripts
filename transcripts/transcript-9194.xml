PRIME MINISTER<br />
INAUGURATION OF SOUTH AFRICAN PRESIDENT<br />
Two former Prime Ministers, the Rt HonjdMalcolm Fraser and the Hon Bob Hawk~ e,<br />
will represent Australia at the ioauguraion of the new President of South Africa<br />
scheduled to take place in Pretoria on 10 May 1994, following the elections on 27<br />
April. It is especially appropriate that Mr Hawke and Mr Fraser should attend the<br />
inauguration, since for more than 20 years Australia n governments on both sides of<br />
politics sought an end to apartheid. From the early 1970s, despite a number of<br />
changes of Government, one constant, whichever party was in power, has been<br />
Australia's active opposition to apartheid in all its manifestations.<br />
Both Mr Fraser and Mr Hawke were personally in the forefront of international efforts<br />
to end apartheid. Both were firmly committed to Commonwealth sanctions against<br />
South Africa.<br />
As Prime Minister, Mr Fraser was one of the driving forces behind the<br />
Commonwealth ban on sporting contacts imposed as a result of the 1977<br />
Gleneagles Agreement. Following his retirement from politics, the Commonwealth<br />
recognised Mr Fraser's standing in the struggle against apartheid by inviting him to<br />
be joint chair of the Commonwealth's Eminent Persons' Group ( EPG) which helped<br />
encourage the development of political dialogue in South Africa.<br />
During his term as Prime Minister, Mr H-awke was closely involved in Commonwealth<br />
efforts to end the oppression of black South Africans. In 1985 he made a strong<br />
personal commitment to the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting<br />
( CHOGM) in Nassau which agreed on the imposition of trade and investment<br />
sanctions against South Africa, and at subsequent Commonwealth meetings he was<br />
Involved in strengthening the sanctions regime. In particular, he was involved in the<br />
development andd pro motion internationally of the concept of financial sanctions.<br />
The Labor Government under Mr Hawke also led the way in developing the<br />
Commonwealth's policy of the phased reduction of sanctions in response to positive<br />
steps by South Africa in negotiating a transition to democracy.<br />
Mr Fraser and Mr Hawke will carry with them the best wishes of the Government and<br />
people of Australia for the future of a democratic South Africa.<br />
