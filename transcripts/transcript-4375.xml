JJJ AUSTRALIA<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 24 APRIL 1977<br />
TELEGRAM TO MR. HAMER<br />
The Prime Minister sent the following message to the<br />
Victorian State Premier, Mr. Hamer, this afternoon.<br />
My dear Premier,<br />
I am concerned that every effort should be made to find<br />
a quick solution to the present petrol crisis which is<br />
so severely disrupting industry and the community<br />
generally in your State, and is having a direct impact<br />
on interstate trade and commerce. It is an intolerable<br />
situation that 230 men should be able to hold the State<br />
to ransom in the way that they have, and cause so much<br />
damage. I appreciate that your government has available to it<br />
the powers to deal with this situation, and I was pleased<br />
to hear that you are considering the legalities of<br />
action which you might take. The Commonwealth Government,<br />
however, stands ' ready to assist you in your efforts in.<br />
any way that ' Vgu consider helpful. Commonwealth<br />
officials are available to discuss the matter with<br />
your officials.<br />
You may be assured that the action that you do take<br />
will have the full support of the Commonwealth.<br />
Yours sincerely,<br />
Malcolm Fraser. </p>
