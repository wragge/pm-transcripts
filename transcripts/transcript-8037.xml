CHECK AGAINST DELITVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELITVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
ACCEPTANCE OF BROTHERHOOD OF ST LAURENCE<br />
CHILD POVERTY POSTCARDS<br />
PARLIAMENT HOUSE 22 JUNE 1990<br />
Archbishop Hollingworth<br />
Dr Hewson and other Parliamentary colleagues<br />
Ladies and gentlemen<br />
and, in particular, children of Canberra<br />
representing the children of Australia<br />
Thank you for these postcards and thank you more importantly<br />
for the concern and the commitment that they represent:<br />
your cn~ en about the plight of Australian families and<br />
Australian children who are living in hardship, and your<br />
commitment to do something positive to remedy that plight.<br />
Your action demonstrates that Australians do care about<br />
those in our community who have less, and are prepared to<br />
speak out for those whose own voice is muffled by<br />
disadvantage. For that, you deserve the respect and<br />
gratitude of us all.<br />
As Archbishop Hollingworth has noted, my Government has<br />
placed great emphasis on improving the financial situation<br />
of families with children<br />
we have raised all children's payments to a benchmark<br />
of adequacy and we have indexed them<br />
we have substantially increased rent assistance and<br />
from March 1991 it will be indexed<br />
we have introduced the Child Support Scheme<br />
we have introduced a $ 100 million package of help for<br />
disadvantaged young people, particularly the homeless.<br />
And we have recognised too, that the causes of poverty are<br />
complex and that breaking the poverty cycle involves more<br />
than income support. </p>
<p>2.<br />
The most effective means of overcoming poverty is of course<br />
through employment. Our record of job creation is second to<br />
none. Some 1.6 million Australians have found jobs since<br />
1983. Some of these are disadvantaged people who have found<br />
work through programs like JET and NEWSTART.<br />
We have dramatically expanded the quality and quantity of<br />
opportunities for education and training.<br />
For families to take advantage of employment and training<br />
opportunities, access to affordable quality child care is<br />
crucial. We are working to create more than a quarter of a<br />
million places by 1996 and to ensure, through better fee<br />
relief levels, improved access to these places.<br />
Having achieved greatly improved income support, job<br />
opportunities, training and education chances for<br />
disadvantaged groups in our society, we are now<br />
investigating how to carry the fight for social justice into<br />
new arenas.<br />
For example, we have announced the National Housing Strategy<br />
so that, together with the States, we can look further into<br />
the housing needs of Australians and determining how these<br />
can best be met.<br />
We have also announced a major review of health policy<br />
within the Medicare framework designed to put in place a<br />
national health strategy for the twenty-first century.<br />
Also in pursuit of these new approaches to social justice I<br />
invited the Premiers and Chief Ministers last December to<br />
participate in a Commonwealth/ State Ministerial Committee on<br />
Services for Disadvantaged Children and Families. The<br />
intended objective of that Committee is for the States and<br />
the Commonwealth to improve the co-ordination of services<br />
that we provide to disadvantaged children and families so<br />
that these people get a better deal.<br />
As the Brotherhood and the Councils of Social Service have<br />
also realised, many families suffer disadvantage simply<br />
because they live in places where fewer services are<br />
available such as on the outer fringes of our major cities<br />
and provincial towns, or in remote parts of Australia.<br />
Part of the solution to this problem lies in the better<br />
coordination and allocation of services.<br />
As I said at the opening of the Committee's first meeting:<br />
from the point of view of the family in need, working out<br />
which tier of Government has the responsibility of providing<br />
the services is less important than ensuring that the<br />
appropriate services are delivered, to those who need them.<br />
The Committee's work so far has borne out that fundamental<br />
truth. </p>
<p>The first step the Commonwealth has taken is to try to<br />
establish with the States a genuine exchange of information<br />
and views on what services are currently provided and how<br />
best they can be integrated and improved.<br />
I can assure you my Government is committed to action. We<br />
very much want to see results.<br />
But I think it's appropriate in this gathering, where the<br />
focus is on the Federal sphere, to remember that the States<br />
also have a vital role to play. They too need to<br />
demonstrate their full commitment to the work of the<br />
Committee. In particular, their strong commitment is needed to<br />
collecting and exchanging better information than available<br />
to date on the location of their services and the scope for<br />
better integration before real progress can be made.<br />
On the special needs of Aboriginal children, funds and<br />
co-ordination are of course necessary. However, as the<br />
Brotherhood has pointed out, Aboriginal people themselves<br />
must have an opportunity to develop and implement solutions<br />
to their own problems. The context of their poverty the<br />
dispossession and oppression suffered by generations of<br />
Aboriginal people must be addressed. Through the<br />
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission and the<br />
promotion of a process of reconciliation, the Government is<br />
attempting to give Aboriginal people the self-management and<br />
self-respect necessary to overcome the fundamental causes of<br />
Aboriginal child poverty.<br />
Let me conclude with a more general point about the<br />
motivation of politicians and the rationale of social<br />
justice programs such as we are discussing today.<br />
It's very easy to adopt a fashionable cynicism about<br />
politicians and assume that they will only do something if<br />
they're pushed into it. That's an attitude that I see<br />
underlies these postcards, where you make the claim that<br />
" tall. politicians will only do something about [ child<br />
poverty] if they feel they have to. At election time, for<br />
instance Let me say, quite deliberately, I think that is a cheap<br />
shot. It may make you feel good -quite simply it is a<br />
false statement.<br />
I can tell you: That's not my attitude to social justice;<br />
it's not my attitude to what politics is about.<br />
I think any closer analysis of the new services we have<br />
delivered to disadvantaged Australians would show they<br />
haven't been based on a judgment that there may be votes in<br />
them. Instead, they have been part of an overall strategy<br />
of change based on a fundamental analysis of who really is<br />
in need in this community. </p>
<p>4.<br />
The reason we can afford to spend more money on the less<br />
well off is, by and large, because we decided to spend less<br />
money on those who are better off. That has meant taking<br />
benefits away from people and levying new taxes on those who<br />
hadn't been paying their fair share. In other words, we've<br />
made some tough decisions some unpopular decisions<br />
decisions that cost us votes at election time. I ask you to<br />
recall the virulent campaigns waged against us on the assets<br />
test, the fringe benefits tax and the capital gains tax.<br />
But we made those decisions because they were the right<br />
decisions to make. I think at the end of the day you would<br />
agree that is a far better rationale for decision making<br />
than any knee-jerk responsiveness to a lobbying campaign,<br />
whether expressed through postcards or by any other means.<br />
So my Government has worked, and will continue to work, to<br />
improve the circumstances of the disadvantaged in our<br />
community. We cannot do it single-handed. The contribution<br />
made by the many community organisations, notable among them<br />
the Brotherhood of St Laurence, and the Councils of Social<br />
Service is crucial. I commend your work and wish you<br />
continued success. </p>
