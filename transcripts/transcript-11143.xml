<p>SUBJECTS: Coastwatch, US style coastguard, voluntary student unionism,</p>
<p> GST legislation, Senator Meg Lees.</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, good morning to you.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good morning Steve.</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>You say these new measures will send a strong message to the rest</p>
<p> of the world but with so much money involved in illegal immigration</p>
<p> these days, especially in China, do you think the messages a) are</p>
<p> going to be heard and b) will be heeded?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, I do. Not only are we putting more resources in the way but we</p>
<p> are making it very clear that by sending immigration officers into</p>
<p> potential source countries that we have a capacity to seek out potential</p>
<p> waves of illegal immigration before they really start and prevention</p>
<p> is always better than cure. We've actually done very well over the</p>
<p> last few months where there's been an increased attempt to, sort of,</p>
<p> raid Australia with illegal immigrants. We have done extremely well</p>
<p> but we know that illegal immigration is on the increase all around</p>
<p> the world. Australia is very attractive. We are a terrific country</p>
<p> to come to anyway and on top of that there is a perception that some</p>
<p> of our laws allow people once they get a foothold here to tie up the</p>
<p> legal system for years. And if only we could persuade the Senate to</p>
<p> pass some legislation to stiffen that we'd send an even stronger message.</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>And are you confident that overseas governments, especially the Chinese</p>
<p> Government, are going to cooperate with us?</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>Yes. So far they've been very good. In fact the Chinese Government</p>
<p> has been very co-operative about returns of illegal immigrants. We</p>
<p> talk to them on a very detailed comprehensive basis and so far they</p>
<p> have taken a very understanding and a very co-operative view.</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, why did the Government reject calls or reported calls</p>
<p> for an American type national coastguard?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, America is not Australia. America has a much larger population</p>
<p> than Australia although our coastline is comparable. We actually think</p>
<p> that the way we've organised it is just as effective. You have got</p>
<p> to bear in mind that with all of the coastguard and everything the</p>
<p> Americans have they still have a lot of illegal immigration. There</p>
<p> was a well-publicised case a few years ago of people getting into</p>
<p> the Hudson River in New York. So no country can guarantee there will</p>
<p> never be illegal immigrants coming in. I think there is always a mistake</p>
<p> in this country to just lamely ape the Yanks no matter what the issue</p>
<p> is. You have got to look at the Australian situation and the Australian</p>
<p> circumstance.</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>And in looking....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I can't hear you, Steve, I have lost sound. [Commercial break]</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>We are talking to the Prime Minister, John Howard, about the Government's</p>
<p> new initiatives to improve coastal surveillance in Australia. Prime</p>
<p> Minister, before we were rudely interrupted, you were talking about</p>
<p> looking at Australia's position and not following the United States</p>
<p> just as a matter of course. When you looked at Australia's position,</p>
<p> why not greater involvement for our defence forces?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we have because the new Director-General of coastal surveillance</p>
<p> will be a serving defence officer. And he will therefore be able to</p>
<p> even better co-ordinate the roles of our customs service, our Federal</p>
<p> Police and our defence services. And in the arrangements we have now</p>
<p> the Navy is involved and it'll continue to be involved and involved</p>
<p> quite heavily.</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>And why not a single agency that combines, say, immigration, customs,</p>
<p> quarantine, the whole lot under one umbrella? Because one gets the</p>
<p> distinct impression that the fragmentation of authority in this particular</p>
<p> area has worked against us in the past?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we are effectively going to do that because we're bringing</p>
<p> it all under the control of this person who will come out of the defence</p>
<p> area. But we're not going to the expense of setting up yet another</p>
<p> agency because you can sometimes, by setting up yet another agency,</p>
<p> you can just create a new bureaucracy. But the existing agencies do</p>
<p> co-operate very well together. And I make the point again that we've</p>
<p> actually been very successful in deterring people and catching people</p>
<p> when they get here, very successful.</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>So you haven't been concerned at a degree of bureaucratic rivalry</p>
<p> in this whole area?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think a lot of that's now gone. It may have existed a few years</p>
<p> ago but I'm satisfied that it's largely gone.</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>Because the other thing, I mean, illegal boat arrivals are getting</p>
<p> all the headlines but, in fact, our airports are the major ports of</p>
<p> entry, if I can put it that way, for illegal immigrants, are they</p>
<p> not?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>That is true and that is one of the reasons why we're putting</p>
<p> such an emphasis on placing immigration officers, twelve of them,</p>
<p> in different source countries so that you'll be able to get it</p>
<p> at its source rather than respond to it when it happens.</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>Okay, Prime Minister, just while I've got you there, a couple</p>
<p> of other matters. The appearance today of an advertisement in the</p>
<p> papers Â 35 prominent Australians including Cardinal Clancy the</p>
<p> Archbishop of Sydney and the high Court Judge, Gerard Brennan, calling</p>
<p> on the Senate to reject your Government's voluntary unionism</p>
<p> for university students legislation.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I haven't actually seen that advertisement but I don't</p>
<p> agree with them. And, of course, Sir Gerard Brennan is a former High</p>
<p> Court Judge. I think there's a very simple principle involved</p>
<p> in this and that is the right of people to join or not to join an</p>
<p> organisation. I cannot for the life of me understand people who believe</p>
<p> in civil liberties arguing passionately to force people to belong</p>
<p> to a union and that is what voluntary student unionism is about. It's</p>
<p> about giving students the choice and the right. And I think, once</p>
<p> again, you have an example of people not quite understanding that</p>
<p> a growing number of people of university age want the choice, they</p>
<p> want the option of joining or not joining a union. They don't</p>
<p> want to be told by the system that they must join something and must</p>
<p> make a contribution even though they may not choose to use the services.</p>
<p> I mean, there are plenty of examples in the past of where money has</p>
<p> been spent by university unions on political purposes clearly out</p>
<p> of step with the wishes of the majority of the people who've</p>
<p> made those contributions.</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>Okay. Incidentally, you must be feeling pretty pleased with yourself</p>
<p> today. I mean, it looks like the GST legislation will go through the</p>
<p> Senate. You've got another section or a portion of Telstra that</p>
<p> is being sold off and I see this morning that you're also attracting</p>
<p> now the younger Australian voter.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I saw that. I don't get complacent about those things but</p>
<p> I do think increasing numbers of young Australians are attracted by</p>
<p> the fact that we are in favour of something, that we are doers. We</p>
<p> are endeavouring to reform and improve, rather than just bag and knock.</p>
<p> And I also think that the younger generation of Australians today</p>
<p> are people who don't want to be told to conform to a pattern.</p>
<p> Something like voluntary student unionism Â I think a lot of</p>
<p> the objection to voluntary student unionism is coming not from people</p>
<p> of student age but from people of a much older age who have a different</p>
<p> paradigm, a different mindset, a different attitude and perhaps that</p>
<p> is illustrated in that advertisement that you referred to.</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>And Meg Lees looks like she's going to stay as Leader of the</p>
<p> Democrats. You'd be pleased with that, wouldn't you?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, that's a matter for them but I repeat, I found her a very</p>
<p> honourable, decent person to deal with and naturally I'm pleased</p>
<p> that we're on the brink, after a quarter of a century, of getting</p>
<p> fundamental tax reform in this country. When that legislation finally</p>
<p> passes the House of Representatives in the next few days and becomes</p>
<p> law it will be a great moment for the cause of economic reform in</p>
<p> this country. For 25 years political parties and Prime Ministers and</p>
<p> Opposition Leaders have striven for this day and at long last it's</p>
<p> within reach. And it's a great moment for the economic security</p>
<p> of Australia, forget about its party political impact.</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>Nice to talk with you again. Thanks for your time.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Thanks, Steve.</p>
