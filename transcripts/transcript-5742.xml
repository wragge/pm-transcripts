LAUNCHING OF CAMPAIGN FOR CONSTRUCTION<br />
OF N. F. F. HOUSE<br />
CANBE RRA<br />
It is a great pleasure to have the opportunity to launch<br />
the campaign for the construction of N. F. F. House<br />
for the in just two and a half years of existence,<br />
has established itself as an effective and constructive voice<br />
for Australian farmers in the National Capital. In doing so,<br />
it has fulfilled an objective a dream that many in the farming<br />
community had been pursuing since the turn of the century,<br />
namely,. to establish a single national organisation to<br />
represent farmers.<br />
I applaud the success of the N. F. F. in securing an unprecedented<br />
degree of unity among representatives of rural communities,<br />
and I applaud its success in promoting the interests not only<br />
of farmers but of the whole Australian community through its<br />
constructive approach to major issues of national policy.<br />
What the N. F. F. has achieved the role it has played could.<br />
not have happened with divided organisations representing<br />
the rural interest.<br />
I would like to take this opportunity to make some brief rema~ rks<br />
about two issues of concern not only to the N. F. F. and its members<br />
but also to the Australian community at large the issue of<br />
inflation and wage settlements and the issue of the latest<br />
Japanese beef tender.<br />
There is no doulbt that inflation remains a major threat to the<br />
renewed growth and prosperity that the Australian economy has;<br />
experienced in the last few years, for it undermines the<br />
confidence, profitability and competitiveness of producers inl<br />
all sectors of the economy. And without question, the greate! st<br />
potential source of continuing inflationary pressure lies in<br />
excessive wage-settlements. It is not only producers who suffer loss<br />
of profits and sales as a result of high wages: their employees<br />
also lose for, directly or indirectly, employees can price<br />
themselves out of the market and destroy job opportunities not<br />
only for themselves, but also for those who are already unemp" Loyed. </p>
<p>-2<br />
The last six months has seen a significant change occur<br />
in the wage determination process. Following the Commonwealth<br />
Conciliation and Arbitration Commission' s decision to abandon<br />
wage indexation, a series of industry-by-industry cases have<br />
gone before the Commission, and settlements of various sorts<br />
have been made, now covering an estimated 65% of wage and<br />
salary earners. We may not all be happy with everything that<br />
has occurred, or all the settlements that have been made, but<br />
what is done is done. What we need now is time to digest<br />
the wage increases and other developments that are taking place.<br />
What we do not Want, what the economy must not be subjected<br />
to, is a further general wage increase on top of those which<br />
have already occurred.<br />
There is one aspect of wage increases in recent times that<br />
I think stands in need of some correction, an aspect that is<br />
particularly relevant to the perceptions of farmers and the N. F. F.<br />
People often point at manufacturers, especially those affordedl<br />
protection by tariffs, and argue that by conceding excessive<br />
wage increases under the shelter of Government assistance<br />
policies, they lead the thrust to higher wages throughout the<br />
economy. But the reality is quite different. While the metal<br />
trades award is certainly a key award in the wage process, and<br />
spreads throughout the system, in terms of the size of wage<br />
increases, workers associated with export oriented projects<br />
miners and construction workers on big resource projects<br />
have been among the leaders, and in terms of the timing of<br />
increases in the industry-by-industry wage round, workers in<br />
the naturally protected non-trading sector transport workers<br />
and storemen and packers have led the round. But in the endt,<br />
it really matters little where the wage pressures start from.<br />
The very fact that they exist threatens profitability and<br />
competitiveness in all sectors of the economy, and threatens<br />
the prosperity of all Australians, especially in a period when<br />
trading conditions are so difficult because of the world<br />
economic situation.<br />
Australia has been subject to inflationary pressures because of<br />
our growth and development. Our important t rading partners iii<br />
North America and Europe have had little or no growth<br />
and are suffering massive unemployment rates in the vicinity<br />
of 8-10%. As a. consequence, inflationary pressures in those<br />
countries Eare less than those we face. They are still diminishing<br />
and the combination of these overseas factors with the very high<br />
wage settlEments which have been taking place in Australia means<br />
that overseas inflation rates could drop below our rate.<br />
Combined with slack world trade, these overseas conditions<br />
are creating a difficult situation for Australian producers and<br />
exporters. The Government is aware of these problems, and I am<br />
sure you are aware of them. I just wish that more of our<br />
unions and employees were more aware of them and more aware of the fact<br />
that high wages create more une'mployment than there would otherwise<br />
be. / 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
It is appropriate t~ hat I should also take this opportunity<br />
to say a few words about the latest Japanese beef tender.<br />
I am disturbed that about half of this tender has specifications<br />
which'can only be met by U. S. grain-fed beef.<br />
When the Minister for Primary Industry, Mr. Nixon was in Japan<br />
just over a month ago, he received assurances at the<br />
highest levels of Government that Japan's beef imports would<br />
be administered in a genuinely non-discriminatory way.<br />
But the fact is that over the past 12 months in some<br />
specific tenders, we have seen the share of U. S. specification<br />
beef steadily rise. It rose from around 25% in earlier tenders to<br />
38% in a tEnder announced last month and now in the latest<br />
tender it has risen to 49%. This is obviously a matter of<br />
great concern to the Government. Today Mr. Anthony called<br />
in the Japanese Ambassador to protest about the terms of this<br />
latest tend. er, and the Government will be seeking urgent<br />
clarification of the Japanese Government's intentions before<br />
considerinc-what further action it might take.<br />
At a time of major challenges to the Australian economy and<br />
to the well-being of farmers an organisation of the calibre arid<br />
vision of the N. F. F. has an important role to play. The record<br />
that the N. F. F. has established in a short space of time<br />
has ensured that it is here to stay, and the construction of a<br />
permanent headquarters for the N. F. F. here in Canberra will<br />
give concrE. te expression to that fact.<br />
It gives ME! great pleasure to launch this campaign<br />
and to wish it every success. 00 </p>
