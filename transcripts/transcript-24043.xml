    <content><![CDATA[<p>The $7 Medicare co-payment measure announced in the 2014-15 Budget will no longer proceed.</p>
<p>The Government will instead implement a package of measures that will strengthen Medicare and help make it sustainable, ensuring Australians will continue to have access to affordable, world-class health care.</p>
<p>The Government has listened to the views of the community.</p>
<p>This new package ensures the Government can make Medicare sustainable, improve the quality of care for patients and continue its repair of the Budget.</p>
<p>The Medicare rebate paid to doctors for some consultations will be reduced by $5 and the troublesome issue of âsix minute medicineâ will be addressed by encouraging doctors to spend more time with patients.</p>
<p><strong><em>Optional co-payment and protection for patients</em></strong></p>
<p>A new optional co-payment will be introduced for GP services with additional protections for patients.</p>
<p>The Government will not impose a co-payment on GP services provided to pensioners, Commonwealth concession card holders, all children under the age of 16, veterans funded through the Department of Veteransâ Affairs, attendances at residential aged care facilities and pathology and diagnostic imaging services.</p>
<p>Incentives paid to doctors to encourage them to bulk bill concession card holders and children under the age of 16 will also remain.</p>
<p>Medicare rebates for common GP consultations will be reduced by $5 for non-concessional patients aged 16 and over from 1 July 2015.</p>
<p>Doctors may choose to recoup the $5 rebate reduction through an optional co-payment or continue to bulk bill non-concessional patients over the age of 16.</p>
<p>Doctors will be under no obligation to charge the co-payment and this decision will be entirely at their discretion.</p>
<p><strong><em>Improving patient outcomes by tackling âsix minute medicineâ</em></strong></p>
<p>In a further move to streamline Medicare and improve quality outcomes, the Government will make changes to standard GP consultation items which currently provide the same Medicare rebate for a six minute consultation as for a 19 minute consultation.</p>
<p>This change will ensure that Medicare expenditure more accurately reflects the time a GP spends with a patient.</p>
<p>It encourages a shift away from âsix minute medicineâ so that appropriate, comprehensive care is better rewarded over patient throughput.</p>
<p>Additionally Medicare fees for all services provided by GPs, medical specialists, allied health practitioners, optometrists and others will remain at their current level until July 2018.</p>
<p><strong><em>Making Medicare Sustainable and the Medical Research Future Fund</em></strong></p>
<p>The Government is committed to taking these prudent measures to protect Medicare.</p>
<p>Medicare will not survive in the long term without changes to make it sustainable.</p>
<p>In the last decade spending on Medicare has more than doubled from $8 billion in 2004 to $20 billion today, yet we raise only $10 billion from the Medicare levy. Spending is projected to climb to $34 billion in the next decade to 2024.</p>
<p>In the last year alone, 275 million services were provided free to patients. Thatâs three out of every four Medicare services being bulk billed.</p>
<p>These changes will contribute more than $3 billion to the Medical Research Future Fund which will fund the research needed to find cures to the health problems of today.</p>
<p>In six years the returns from the MRFF will provide a billion dollars to be invested in medical research annually â doubling our national funding commitments to researchers.</p>
