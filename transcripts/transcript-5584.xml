FOR MEDIA MONDAY, MAY 11 1981<br />
MESSAGE TO FRENCH PRESIDENT-ELECT MITTERAND<br />
The Prime Minister tonight sent the following telex to the<br />
President-elect of France, M. Francois Mitterand:<br />
" Dear Mr President-elect,<br />
on behalf of the Australian Government and on my own<br />
behalf, I would like to extend to you warmest<br />
congratulations and best wishes on your election as<br />
President of France.<br />
Australia attaches grec'it importance to relations with<br />
the countries of Western Europe and with none more so<br />
than France. I look forward to the further development<br />
of relations between Australia and France under your<br />
leadership, drawing strength from our shared concern<br />
for the peace and stability of the international<br />
community, as well as from the importance that both<br />
our countries attach to the South Pacific.<br />
I look forward to an opportunity to meet with you<br />
in the near future. Yours sincerely,<br />
Malcolm Fraser." </p>
