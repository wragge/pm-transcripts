GOVERNMENT WELCOMES RELEASE OF FRANCIS JAMES<br />
The Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr<br />
Whitlam, said today that he warmly welcomed the news that Mr Francis<br />
SJames would be allowed to leave China on 16 January.<br />
The Chinese Government had advised the Australian Embassy<br />
Sin Peking that Mr James would be deported, having been found guilty of<br />
espionage. Mr Whitlam added that the Chinese had said that the<br />
arrangement was being made as a friendly gesture now that diplomatic<br />
relations had been established between China and Australia.<br />
SMr Whitlam said that arrangements had been made for Australian<br />
officials in Peking and Hong Kong to offer assistance to Mr James and<br />
that he had personally informed Mrs James of the news this morning.<br />
The Prime Minister recalled that there had been a number of direct<br />
and indirect approaches made by and on behalf of the Australian Government,<br />
through several channels, and he welcomed the outcome. Mr WVhitlam said he<br />
was certain that Australians, particularly those who had taken a close<br />
personal interest in Mr James' welfare, would be very pleased that the<br />
uncertainty surrounding his well-being had now been resolved and that he<br />
had been allowed to leave China. </p>
