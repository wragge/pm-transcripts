PRESS CONFER' NCE GIVEN BY T'E PRIME MINISTER,<br />
THE RT. HON. R, G. MENZIES, ON THJiSDAY, 21ST<br />
_ DECE4M ER. L AT<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I was just about to say that I suppose I will have<br />
to alter my Who's Who entry by including among Hobbies<br />
Cabinet-making. That seems to be my chief job for the<br />
last two days.<br />
QUESTION: Can you announce the result yet, Sir?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No. but Ill. be in a position to, I have to do<br />
something on this between now and lunch time tomorrow<br />
and I've secured the Governor-General's permission to<br />
because as you know I don't like to announce these<br />
things without his approval. I should think I can have<br />
this out by lunch time tomorrow. And the Swearing-In<br />
will be at 4 o'clock tomorrow afternoon. That gives<br />
unbridled pleasure to the evening press,<br />
QUESTION: How many at the Swearing-In Mro Menzies?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: A few. Yes, a few.<br />
Well, who wants to know something that I can't say.<br />
QUESTION: When will. you hold the first of these conferences<br />
that you mooted yesterday, Sir?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well, I would hope by the middle of January. I<br />
gather that there is a widespread belief that every man<br />
is entitled to three weeks holiday a year. Is that so?<br />
Not having had any for ten years I thought I might take<br />
a week or two off at the beginning of January.<br />
QUESTION: The question has been raised whether you ae likely<br />
to speak with the A. oCT. U. or Trades Hall people<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I can't answer that at this stage, I used,<br />
advisedly, fairly general terms. Those are matters that<br />
we will discuss when we meet, and I would hope to have<br />
a meeting of Ministers by, or possibly before, the<br />
middle of January. And I certainly want conferences<br />
that will occur to occur before the end of January.<br />
QUESTION: '. ill you indicate, Sir, the machinery you will use<br />
for these conferences, the machinery of selecting<br />
people, and topics to be discussed,<br />
PRIME MINISTR: No. I don't think, however, that there will be very<br />
much difficulty.<br />
QUESTION: Have you got anything like a sort of standing<br />
arrangement, standing link, in mind, Sir, as an outcome<br />
of the conferences?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I t. iink that will depend on the conferences., I<br />
don't exclude that possibility at all.<br />
QUESTION: Do you propose to limit the representation, Mr,<br />
Menzies?<br />
PRTME MINISTER: Look, I haven't begun to work this out yet, I want<br />
to have a talk with say the Bankers, I want to have a<br />
talk with, say the manufacturers and so on. But<br />
really I haven t worked out any standing orders yet. </p>
<p>QUESTION: When you say conferences, Sir, do you include<br />
conferences on Northern Development as you suggested, by<br />
the end of January. Do you think that you can see the<br />
Queensland Government, say, by the end of January?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I would hope to have all the consultations that I<br />
have indicated, somewhat generally, before the end of<br />
January. It would suit me, Maybe they would run into<br />
February, But I don't regard it as a matter that<br />
admits of leisure. I mean, subject to your kind<br />
permission, to have a week or two, myself.<br />
QUESTION: Any possibility of a supplementary Budget early this<br />
year Sir?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I haven't the slightest idea,<br />
QUESTION: Can you see sufficiently far into the crystal bowl<br />
to see a date for the opening of the Session?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, but it will be before the end of February. But<br />
wLen I don't know, I haven't really discussed that<br />
with the -eader of the House. I would think somewhere<br />
in the third quarter of February I haven't looked at<br />
the dates.<br />
QUESTION: Can you give any indication at all, Sir, at this<br />
stage of any proposed changes in economic policy that<br />
you have in mind?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, I was surprised to read in one paper this<br />
morning that we were abandoning the policy of stability<br />
and development: I didn't say that, or anything like it.<br />
QUESTION: Can you tell us anything, Sir, from official<br />
channels about the situation, Indonesia vis-a-vis the<br />
West New Guinea argument?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well, I think that you probably know as much about<br />
that as I do because the newspapers have carried a<br />
report of what Soekarno had to say. We have had some<br />
discussion about this matter, of course, in the last<br />
few days, Our attitude on all these matters has been,<br />
first, that we have had now, both from President<br />
Soekarno and Dr, Subandrio categorical assurances that<br />
force will not be resorted to<br />
QUESTION: Have you had that in the last 24 hours Sir?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No We've had it before publicly announced, And<br />
nothing has been said to us that would modify that,<br />
In the second place we, of course have the<br />
greatest desire to live on the friendLiest of terms<br />
with Indonesia. Indeed, we have only one matter of<br />
difference and that a difference of opinion about<br />
the sovereignty of West New Guinea, ' eW would desire to<br />
maintain that position.<br />
Third, we think that in the United Nations the<br />
Netherlands made proposals which went a long way. They<br />
involved, at the appropriate time, transferring<br />
sovereignty to the people of West New Guinea by a<br />
process of self-determination, * Je are deeply attached<br />
to the principlc of self-determination and it is<br />
interesting to recall that in the United Nations General<br />
Assembly when the Netherlands proposal came up, 53<br />
nations supported ito In other words without going<br />
into detail a majority of the nations in the General<br />
Assembly found the general apprcach satisfactory </p>
<p>We still adhere to the principle of self-determination;<br />
and we still hope that out of whatever discussions may<br />
occur, self-determination for the inhabitants of West<br />
New Guinea will be respected, just as we look forward to<br />
and respect it, in the case of our part of New Guinea.<br />
So that we stand firm on that principle: we have<br />
stated it from time to time quite plainly, both here and<br />
in the United Nations, through Mr. Plimsoll, and<br />
earlier through myself last year, and we adhere to it.<br />
de think it is a sound principle, and that it is to<br />
us one of the inevitable steps in passing from a<br />
stage of colonialism to a stage of self-government. Je<br />
have expressed these views to all the relevant parties<br />
and they remain our views, But they are not put forward<br />
in a hostile way, They are put forward by Australia as<br />
a subscribing member of the United Nations, recognising<br />
tha-the Charter provides for self-determination, and<br />
rddhering to it ourselves, for our part, in New Guinea,<br />
and profoundly hoping that it will be respected. in the<br />
case of West New Guinea.<br />
QUESTION: Do you think it is only a political threat rather<br />
than a ph; sical threat,,.,?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Oh, don't ask me that, I don't know. I don't know,<br />
Threats have been made before.<br />
QUESTION: Sir, could you say whether you have received in the<br />
past three years requests for special Commonwealth<br />
development aid from the Queensland Government which<br />
the Commonwealth Government has rejected?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't recall any,<br />
QUESTION: During the campaign one of your Ministers, Mr.<br />
Hulme, was attacked by one of Mr. NicJ. lin s Ministers.<br />
Did you know of that and have you any comment to make on<br />
it Sir?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: NoneI non. e, I don't think that it is useful for<br />
Queensland, to engage in post-election recriminations.<br />
They are not very helpful. The main thing is to<br />
develop the country so I will go into discussions I<br />
have without prejudice, and without hostility,<br />
qJESTION: Is it possible, Sir, that there may be scope for<br />
further development action et the Premiers'<br />
Conference or Loan Council meeting in February?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Is there one due in February?<br />
PRESSMAN: Well around about that time,<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't know. I don't think that a date has been<br />
fixed,<br />
PRESSMAN: Well it has been stated that there will be one early<br />
in the new year.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Wh: ere has it been stated? In the Mirror? Look, I<br />
don't know when there is going to be a Conference. I<br />
can't say,<br />
T EST ION: Why the Mirror, Sir?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Because the Mirror has a greater capacity for<br />
inventive genius than any other newspaper in Australia.<br />
That lets you out lad but only just, only just, </p>
<p>QUESTION1 Could you tell us, Sir, if there are any impending<br />
developments on the European Ccmmon Market the<br />
possibility of a Ministerial visit?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: ITll put it this way: I don't exclude the<br />
possibility of a Ministerial visit, but nobody can say<br />
that dogmatically at this stage, because the situation<br />
develops. There is no doubt that we must have the<br />
closest possible contact with it and I don't exclude the<br />
possibility of a Ministerial visit,<br />
QUESTION: V In that case, Sir, would you make arrangements for<br />
" pairs" with the Opposition?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I would hope so. VIe have never had difficulty in<br />
the past about pairs and I have no reason to suppose<br />
tVat the Leader of the Opposition will want tc depart<br />
0rom that practice. He knows the importance of these<br />
matters. We have not had trouble in the past about<br />
them, and I don't anticipate any. I mean, I can't<br />
imagikne for one moment that an experienced<br />
parliamertarian like the Leader of the Opposition would<br />
want to deprive Australia of having a voice on these<br />
great matters at the appropriate time0 Of course it is<br />
not thinkable to me. I haven't the slightest doubt that<br />
Mr. Calwell will behave with the usual propriety or,<br />
those matters. I don't doubt it for one moment.<br />
QUESTION., I was just wondering, Sir', because there has been<br />
opposition to Mr. Holt's trips abroad in recent yea' sf<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Oh, well now you are getting on to a different<br />
matter. I know about those arguments, but when it comes<br />
to overseas negotiations affecting the interests of<br />
Australia I have never found that the Opposition was<br />
unwilling to make those things feasible, because, after<br />
all if it had won the Election it would necessarily be<br />
in the same position as we are now. And I wouldn't<br />
hesitate to say " Certainly. If anybody has to go to<br />
discuss these matters he's paired". There's no<br />
question about it. And I don't anticipate the faintest.<br />
0.0<br />
QUESTION Tradition lives you an automatic pair with the<br />
Leader of the Opposition, doesn~ t it Sir?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes, I have a standing pair with the Leader of the<br />
Opposition.<br />
QUESTION: Do you expect to go yourself, Sir?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I dontt know. I don't know. My mind doeen't<br />
precipitate itself so far into the futu:' e at the moment.<br />
Here we are, I've just had a birthday. Twelve<br />
hours work in the office is an interestin~ g wtliof<br />
celebrating a birthday and I shall do exactly the same<br />
number tomorrow. I think I will wait and ace how the<br />
Davis Cup goes0<br />
QUESTION: Who's going to win Sir?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I havenft well I have a clue, but it doesn't<br />
matter.<br />
QESTION: W4ill you have much legislative business for the<br />
first Session, the first sitting? How long do you<br />
expect it to last? </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: God. bless my soulT Are you going to ask me for a<br />
list of the legislation and for a time-table? I haven't a<br />
clue but I will, of course, but not now, not now. " I do<br />
r ot ask to see the distant scene. One step enough for me".<br />
Do you remember that? It shows that you had a proper<br />
upbringing in your earlier days.<br />
QUESTION: Have you thought about the obligations to do some<br />
re-distribution, Sir? You should be getting a Certificate<br />
through from the Statistician soon.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, I've had people whistle that into my ear but so<br />
far it would be flattering myself to say that I have<br />
thought about it. I've had other things to think about.<br />
But they tell me I don't know, you're the expert that<br />
we are probably due for one next year. I've even had<br />
people tell me what the result of it will be, State by<br />
State. But I don't know, I don't know. I have a<br />
considerable faculty for remaining uninformed until I want<br />
to 1, e.<br />
QUESTION: Do you intend to make any arrangement, Sir, with the<br />
DLP to ensure control of the Senate?<br />
PRIME ". iNISTER: Not uhat I've ever heard of. I don't contemplate it,<br />
Ie've never made any before. ihy should we start now?<br />
QUESTION: I was just wondering, Sir, now that you are back<br />
with a hostile Senate.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well, how hostile the Senate is remains to be seen.<br />
QUESTION: What particular time of the year do you think is the<br />
most important to Common Market discussions?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well look, nobody can answer that question because<br />
that will depend on the stage that negotiations have<br />
reached in January or February or March or April, or whatever<br />
it may be. No doubt when the stage has been reached<br />
at which the United -ingdom feels that there are crucial<br />
matters that fall for decision and that a Prime Ministers'<br />
Conference ought to occur, then it will occur. I used to<br />
think to myself that that looked like being about April,<br />
but I don't know. Because it is very hard to tell how fast<br />
the negotiations will go or what form they will take. You<br />
have to remember that there are scores of items involved in<br />
this thing and quite a considerable number of nations<br />
involved. But I would think that that is a question that<br />
might be answered with some more accuracy by some ti. e in<br />
January. It can't be answered nov.<br />
QUESTION: Do you think the consultations will be multi-lateral<br />
at the Prime Ministers' Conference?<br />
PRIME i1INISTERS Well I dcn't know, But if a rIime Ministers'<br />
Conference is called then of course they become multilateral.<br />
Just as Il've had an election they tell me, so<br />
Mr. Diefenbaker, I think, has an election coming up some-<br />
*, here. 
QUESTION; Do you have any special measures in mird, Sir, for<br />
dealing with unemployment?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, I don't want to say anything about that yet. You<br />
see we met only, what the day before yesterday. It's no<br />
use rushing at propxitions on two hours' notice, that's no<br />
good to anybody. All know is that we recognise that<br />
problem and this will de one of the first things that we<br />
have to consider. But don't ask me about the details of it.<br />
I may have some ideas but Ilm not announcing them.<br />
QUESTION: Are you still confident that you can re-absorb a<br />
great number of them within 12 months?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes, </p>
