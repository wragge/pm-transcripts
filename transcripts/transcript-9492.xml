TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
ADDRESS TO HOPE VALE COMMUNITY, QUEENSLAND<br />
24 FEBRUARY 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
Thank you members of the Hope Vale Council, other distinguished members<br />
of communities in the Cape, my colleague Peter Dodd and mostly of course<br />
members of the Hope Vale Community, men and women, and boys and girls.<br />
It's a great pleasure for me to come to Hope Vale I'm very much in your debt<br />
for opening up your community and your hearts to me and my colleagues, to<br />
get to know you, and to get to understand you, and to, see how you are living<br />
here, and what your aspirations for yourselves and your community are. This<br />
is a valuable thing, and one which I have taken an opportunity... . which I have<br />
taken on earnestly. Notionally, I came to lend support to the Cape York<br />
Health Council. For all the reasons that Noel ( Pearson) just said, that to make<br />
a health strategy work or any strategy work it can't be just the leadership or<br />
the Government it has to be everybody. And just as we are speaking about<br />
health, the non-Aboriginal community has seen a dramatic change. For<br />
instance in the incidence of heart attacks in the last 20 years. That change<br />
didn't come simply because there were more doctors in each suburb, or that<br />
people were more likely to go them, it came because of a change in the way<br />
Australians have responded to their health needs as a community. They have<br />
changed their diet, they have changed their exercise, they have changed their<br />
levels of stress, and they have sought to live longer. So they have been given<br />
leadership by the medical community, but they have followed it through as the<br />
broader community.<br />
This is the central point the, Noel made to you, and the point that I<br />
would endorse that whatever we do in Aboriginal Australia, has to be done<br />
between the Government, the Australian community, and you as a community.<br />
In other words, it will never be done simply by one group only it will always be<br />
a group effort. It is about basically cooperation and organisation, as<br />
Gerhardt ( Pearson) made the point. And it is about all of you being a part of it. </p>
<p>Now, great changes have been made. In 1967, Aboriginal people didn't have<br />
the right to vote in this country they were not recognised in the Constitution.<br />
That changed. There was an enhanced consciousness about that. There has<br />
been progress since more recently, you have seen the Commonwealth<br />
Parliament enact the Mabo legislation, coming from an important decision that<br />
said that your customs and tradition were not just something that the<br />
Australian community had to assimilate and accommodate, but that it was<br />
actually a source of the Common Law. That your traditions and customs were<br />
a source of Australian Common Law. That was a declaration, but for it to be<br />
law, the Government had to make a law. Anid we passed that law with the<br />
help of a lot of you a year ago" We are now trying to.. . this week I<br />
will introduce the Bill for theiL and Fund, that gives you the chance<br />
to buy land that formerly has been . anated from you, and that you can't<br />
secure under Mabo. Now why are we doing these things? Simply because<br />
we feel that a wrong has been done yes, we do. There was the historic<br />
denunciation of your rights, the removal of your land, the attack upon your<br />
population this community is seeking to right those wrongs, and we are<br />
seeking to right them in land. Land we know is important to you, because it is<br />
a part of the course of empowerment of Aboriginal people. That because of<br />
this spiritual connection you have with your lives and the land, the land is<br />
important to you. For us to make a reconciliation with you, the land must be<br />
part of the parcel it must be part of the package.<br />
But part of that is also about giving you the right to live a traditional lifestyle.<br />
That is, having the capacity to use that land. And as Noel said eloquently,<br />
" living long enough to use it as well" That is, not just having it but living on<br />
it, enjoying it, and living lone this is what I think most Australians<br />
wish for you as a Community thtse things are possible. And I think that<br />
while it is entirely true that the Mission stations have now become Aboriginal<br />
Communities and they do have their leaders, and you do have your<br />
strategies, and you are getting your land we know that whenever Aboriginal<br />
people move towards a traditional lifestyle, their connection with the land not<br />
only empowers them, but changes their psychology, and it also changes the<br />
quality of their life. It changes their health, and it means that their health<br />
improves, their well-being improves their sense of well-being their sense of<br />
mind, and so the out-station movement is an important movement in the return<br />
to that traditional style of life which the land gives you the capacity to create.<br />
So, can I say that as Prime Minister, I see the whole story of Aboriginal<br />
Australia and the reconciliation as being in a number of parts. The<br />
recognition, the vote, the land, the helth, the leadership, the empowerment,<br />
the enjoyment the happiness. ~ i~ use the whole point of public policy is<br />
human happiness, and what greatsr cbjective could we have for you that you<br />
are happy and well?<br />
Now, health is a problem. It is a problem because of congregation in part, it is<br />
a problem because of inadequacy of resources, and we know crowded<br />
accommodation in communities, former mission stations areas produces all<br />
sorts of health problems. And we have not seen the public facilities there in<br />
the environmental health: like the roads, the sewerage systems, the hospitals,<br />
the immunisations, the various things that the non-Aboriginal community has. </p>
<p>But we are also seeing a less than complete understanding on the part of<br />
Aboriginal communities about the way they live their own lives about their<br />
diet, about how they actually.. . about their hygiene, about how they actually<br />
diminish the incidence of infection, about prevention once infection comes<br />
along. None of this, of course, can be separated from education, and one of the<br />
things I was delighted about today was to see in this school which has<br />
produced now so many quite famous people, and articulate people, leaders<br />
indeed of the Australian community to see so many young Aboriginal<br />
Australians learning those skills: literacy, numeracy and empowerment. It is<br />
that education which is going to underpin any community understanding and<br />
strategy about how Aboriginal people join with the Government of the<br />
Commonwealth and the Government of the States and Local Government in<br />
improving their health and life opportunities. So, I come here to Hope<br />
Vale... . first of all I come to a community which is welcoming, I come to one<br />
which is open, I come to one which has a sense of enjoyment and pleasure in<br />
its own company, and I come to one that is trying to grapple with its change of<br />
its history, and its' opportunities, and to do something about the problems of<br />
health. And I have been told about the problems that you can't get the Flying<br />
Doctor in if the airport is bad. That there is no point in trying to protect<br />
yourselves from things like scabies, or from diseases of the kidneys, or<br />
nephritis, if in fact there is a run-over of sewerage. So the sewerage system<br />
has to work it has to be adequate. It's not good for Aboriginal women to be<br />
leaving their communities to have their children none of our women do that.<br />
Why should you? Because you have the nurturing and you have the support<br />
that you need but you don't have the midwives, you don't have the facilities,<br />
and you don't have the doctors when you need them, because you don't have<br />
the facilities to get the doctors here, and they won't work here. All this implies<br />
to me that there is a reasonably comprehensive strategy to take this on.<br />
First of all, a recognition of the problem. This is what. the Cape York Health<br />
Council is doing it is recognising the problem. It knows that the solution is in<br />
all of you adopting it. It knows solution is in better coordination with<br />
the Commonwealth, and the iid. Local Governments. And it is not a<br />
matter, as I think Gerhar' tther it is ATSIC or the Commonwealth<br />
Health. Department, or: .1 ueensland or it's the Local Government or the<br />
Health Council, or the Lancu Council it is a case of everybody coming together<br />
in the delivery of a coordinated strategy. That is what we are seeking to do<br />
here. But we can't do it without you. None of us can do it without you. If you are not<br />
interested in health in a primary way and when I say primary, I mean in terms<br />
of your own personal health to the point where you are part of a strategy, just<br />
as any community works to alleviate disease or the likelihood of certain<br />
complaints we can perhaps help you if you help yourselves, in joining in a<br />
strategy that actually tries to make it work. And so that health and hygiene,<br />
and that the strategy is to if you like ease the congregational pressures on<br />
communities by moving from towns to out-stations, or taking positions on the<br />
periphery of Aboriginal comminutes, all these things which lower the<br />
temperature of infection and disease and maladies are the things which are </p>
<p>going to make the difference. It is not going to be simply an immunisation<br />
program. It is not simply going to be lights on the runway. It is not simply<br />
going to be the mid-wife. It is going to be the whole combination of things.<br />
So, I think this is a period of great opportunity for all Australians, because I<br />
have said and I mean it that when we are as a nation together, we are<br />
stronger. When Aboriginal Australians and non-Aboriginal Australians are<br />
together as a nation, we are stronger. And there is no doubt that the passage<br />
of Mabo has made the Australian community feel better about the Aboriginal<br />
Communities futures, and better about themselves as a community for making<br />
this opportunity and this gesture in land. We have now got to do another thing<br />
another perhaps more complex thing. And that is, to weave into our health<br />
strategy the life and lifestyles of Aboriginal people, and to join with the<br />
administrators of the Commonwealth and the States in -seeing those strategies<br />
come to pass. It is not simply a matter of money -if the Commonwealth<br />
Government wrote a cheque tomorrow morning in the Budget, it will not solve<br />
the problem. It may help in particular ways, but it will not solve the problem.<br />
So I think one of the lessons I would learn from this very welcoming visit to<br />
Hope Vale is that you understand here in Cape York the problem. You<br />
know it is a sophisticated problem which means all of you every one of you<br />
have to be part of the solution. That your leaders can articulate it, but you<br />
have to be part of the solutic then have to develop those strategies<br />
out for housing, for health p , for access and transiting, for medical<br />
support but we have to be aware of all of the dangers and incidents of the<br />
traffic of disease, and to do the things which are customary in developed<br />
societies to deal with scabies with ointments. To deal with nephritis. And to<br />
do these things which can be done, and which should be done.<br />
So, I am delighted by the sense of community I have found here I am<br />
heartened, buoyed by the sense of community that I found here, by the<br />
vigour and the intelligence and the verve of your young people which I could<br />
see today in school, by the dedication of those who teach them, and inculcate<br />
these truths and this learning to them, who can provide this future on-going<br />
understanding and leadership to the community. And in seeing that, knowing<br />
that all of you want to live, and want to recapture that traditional lifestyle, that<br />
was denied to you for such a large part of our history. I think this is now a<br />
possibility not everybody will take it, not everybody should. But those who<br />
do, will have the benefit of it both spiritually and environmentally, and in terms<br />
of their health and longevity, the challenge therefore is to deal with the<br />
communities. So, I would like to take this. opportunity of saluting what has<br />
been done in recognition of this problem with the Cape York Health Council, of<br />
all the Communities of the Capc' no to say that the Commonwealth<br />
Government will be cooperating in seeking to find the right course and<br />
strategy to get the problem solveo.<br />
Some of them are location specific and they can be done. And you have got<br />
to wonder why they haven't been done whether it Is the road through from<br />
here that should have been tarred. I mean dust is a problem dust is a<br />
problem for respiratory complaints, of which Aboriginal people have many.<br />
Access through strips and things like that through airports these are simply<br />
a matter of funds and the doing of it. </p>
<p>These things can be done but what has to be done is to put the strategy<br />
together, and not be territorial about it. So for my part, I said in Redfem in<br />
1992, we this community of Australia want a new relationship with the<br />
Aboriginal Community. We understand the history, we understand the sins,<br />
and we want to make reparations, and we want a reconciliation. Of these we<br />
have now sought step-by-step to do. Mabo, the Land Fund, now health. And<br />
with health will be the environmental issues housing, sewerage etc. We<br />
should be able to do it together, but together is the only way to do it. And I<br />
think that is the message of this visit. Thank you very much for having me,<br />
and for the welcome.<br />
ends. </p>
