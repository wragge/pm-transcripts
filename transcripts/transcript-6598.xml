PRIME MINISTER<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER AT A PARLIAMENTARY DINNER IN<br />
HONOUR OF H. E. SIR KINGSTON DIBELA, GCMG, K. St. J, GOVERNORGENERAL<br />
OF PAPUA NEW GUINEA -26 FEBRUARY 1985<br />
YOUR EXCELLENCY, MEMBERS OF THE DIPLOMATIC CORPS,<br />
HONOURABLE MEMBERS.<br />
IAM PLEASED TO WELCOME YOUR EXCELLENCY To AUSTRALIA, ON<br />
BEHALF OF ALL THE PARLIAMENTARIANS HERE AND ON BEHALF OF<br />
ALL AUSTRALIANS. I DO SO IN THE SURE KNOWLEDGE THAT<br />
PAPUA NEW GUINEA HAS A SPECIAL PLACE IN THE HEARTS OF<br />
ALL AUSTRALIANS. THE UNFORCED AND UNDIVIDED AFFECTION<br />
WHICH AUSTRALIANS AND PAPUA NEW GUINEANS HAVE MAINTAINED<br />
FOR EACH OTHER IS THE SUREST DEMONSTRATION OF THE<br />
SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES.<br />
VISITS SUCH AS YOURS CONSOLIDATE AND CONFIRM WHAT WE ALL<br />
KNOW TO BE TRUE THAT RELATIONS BETWEEN AUSTRALIA AND<br />
PAPUA NEW GUINEA ARE UNIQUELY CLOSE AND UNIQUELY FIRM.<br />
IT IS EASY TO TAKE FOR GRANTED THE POSITIVE ASPECTS OF<br />
THE RELATIONSHIP-BUT WE SHOULD NOT FORGET THAT<br />
DEALINGS BETWEEN AUSTRALIA AND PAPUA NEW GUINEA<br />
CONSTITUTE AN IMPORTANT A14D R~ ARE SUCCESS STORY. </p>
<p>WE IN THE LABOR PARTY * REGARD OUR OWN ROLE IN THE PROCESS<br />
AS ONE OF OUR MAJOR HISTORICAL ACHIEVEMENTS. THE ROLE<br />
OF THE COALITION PARTIES IN THAT SAME PROCESS,<br />
PARTICULARLY TOWARDS THE END OF THE COLONIAL PERIOD,<br />
ALSO BROUGHT GREAT CREDIT ON AUSTRALIAPAPUA<br />
NEW GUINEA'S MOVEMENT TOWARDS INDEPENDENCE WAS<br />
ACHIEVED WITHOUT VIOLENCE, WITHOUT RECRIMINATIONS,<br />
WITHOUT INSTABILITY. SINCE INDEPENDENCE PAPUA NEW<br />
GUINEA AND AUSTRALIA HAVE BEEN FORMALLY SEPARATED BUT<br />
HAVE CONTINUED TO MOVE TOGETHER. WE DO NOT ALWAYS<br />
AGREE, BUT WE ALWAYS RESPECT AND TRUST EACH OTHER-BO0TH<br />
COUNTRIES RECOGNISE THAT THE OTHER IS A PARTNER OF<br />
PERMANENT IMPORTANCE-WE HAVE NO INTENTION OF ALLOWING<br />
ANY ASPECT OF THAT SITUATION TO CHANGEORGANISING<br />
OUR RELATIONSHIP HAS ENTAILED A LOT OF GIVE<br />
AND TAKE ON BOTH SIDES-MUTUAL RESPECT HAS MADE THOSE<br />
PRAGMATIC ADJUSTMENTS EASY TO HANDLE-WE WILL CONTINUE<br />
TO SHARE MANY INTERESTS IN OUR NEIGHBOURHOOD.<br />
2.<br />
THE BASIS FOR THAT RELATIONSHIP REMAINS THE WAY IN-WHICH<br />
DE-COLONISATION WAS HANDLED-WE WERE ALL PROUD AT THE<br />
TIME OF THE WAY THAT PROCESS WAS CARRIED OUT SMOOTHLY,<br />
EFFICIENTLY, QUICKLY AND PEACEFULLY-WE CAN STILL BE<br />
PROUD-</p>
<p>WE WILL CONTINUE TO DEVELOP THE POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC<br />
DIMENSIONS OF OUR RELATIONSHIP-WE WILL CONTINUE TO<br />
WORK TOGETHER IN MEETINGS OF COMMONWEALTH COUNTRIES AND<br />
THE SOUTH PACIFIC FORUM.<br />
OUR RELATIONSHIP IS NOT SIMPLY A MATTER OF SENTIMENT AND<br />
TRADITION ALTHOUGH THE MUTUAL SENTIMENTS ARE NATURAL<br />
AND WARM, AND THE TRADITIONS BINDING US TOGETHER ARE<br />
LONG AND HONOURABLE-MY FIRST OVERSEAS VISIT AS PRIME<br />
MINISTER WAS TO PAPUA NEW GUINEA. THAT WAS A NATURAL<br />
AND FITTING ORDERING OF PRIORITIES-I RETURNED TO PORT<br />
MORESBY LAST AUGUST TO ATTEND A REGIONAL COMMONWEALTH<br />
MEETING AND TO SHARE IN PAPUA NEW GUINEA'S CELEBRATIONS<br />
FOR THE OPENING OF THE NEW PARLIAMENT BUILDING-I WILL<br />
BE BACK AGAIN-IN THE MEANTIME MR HAYDEN HAS ONLY<br />
RECENTLY COMPLETED ANOTHER SIGNIFICANT VISIT. AIMED AT<br />
FURTHER BROADENING AND DEEPENING THE LINKS BETWEEN USAs<br />
YOU KNOW, MR HAYDEN VISITED PAPUA NEW GUINEA<br />
PRINCIPALLY TO RATIFY THE TORRES STRAIT TREATY. I REFER<br />
SPECIFICALLY TO THAT TREATY BECAUSE IT REPRESENTS A<br />
LANDMARK IN OUR RELATIONS-THE TREATY HAS BEEN DRAFTED<br />
LABORIOUSLY AND CAREFULLY-IT CONSTITUTES A PRACTICAL<br />
RESOLUTION OF COMPLICATED AND CONTENTIOUS ISSUES. IT<br />
PROVIDES APPROPRIATE RE-ASSURANCES FOR THE TRADITIONAL<br />
INHABITANTS OF THE TORRES STRAIT ISLANDS-</p>
<p>4~.<br />
BOTH GOVERNMENTS HAVE INDICATED THEIR DETERMINATION TO<br />
FULFIL ALL THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO THE ISLANDERS-MORE<br />
GENERALLY, BOTH COUNTRIES HAVE SHOWN THEIR ABILITY AND<br />
THEIR INTENTION TO WORK THROUGH A SET OF DIFFICULT<br />
QUESTIONS, TO DEAL HARMONIOUSLY AND EFFECTIVELY WITH<br />
EACH OTHER, AND TO STRENGTHEN OUR RELATIONSHIP BY DOING<br />
so. THAT IS A MODEL WHICH WE SHOULD NOT AND WILL NOT<br />
FORGETOUR RELATIONSHIP HAS NOT STOOD STILL-WE HAVE GONE WELL<br />
PAST DE-COLONISATION. MOREOVER WE IN AUSTRALIA HAVE<br />
NEVER BEEN INTERESTED IN NEO-COLONIALism. THOSE ASPECTS<br />
OF AUSTRALIAN EXPERIENCE WHICH HAVE FOUND A RELEVANCE IN<br />
PAPUA NEW GUINEA HAVE BEEN APLIED BECAUSE THE PAPUA NEW<br />
GUINEA GOVERNMENT AND PEOPLE FOUND THEM TO BE FITTINGNOT<br />
BECAUSE AUSTRALIA WANTED TO IMPOSE THEM.<br />
NOR WILL AUSTRALIA INTRUDE INTO AREAS PROPERLY THE<br />
RESPONSIBILITY OF PAPUA NEW GUINEA. THE IRIAN JAYA<br />
BORDER ISSUE, FOR EXAMPLE, IS ONE TO BE MANAGED BETWEEN<br />
PAPUA NEW GUINEA AND INDONESIAIWISH<br />
TO REFER TO TWO SPECIFIC FACETS OF OUR SHARED<br />
EXPERIENCE IN WHICH YOU, YOUR EXCELLENCY, HAVE PLAYED A<br />
PARTICULAR ROLE. THE FIRST IS THE WESTMINSTER SYSTEM,<br />
FROM WHICH WE BOTH DRAW HEAVILY-YOU KNOW THAT SYSTEM<br />
WELL AS A FORMER SPEAKER OF YOUR PARLIAMENT. </p>
<p>BOTH AUSTRALIA AND PAPUA NEW GUINEA HAVE ADAPTED THE<br />
SYSTEM AS DEVELOPED AT WESTMINSTER ITSELF. BUT BOTH OF<br />
US HAVE ALSO FOUND THAT SYSTEM TO BE A BUTTRESS FOR THE<br />
DEMOCRATIC VALUES AND HABITS WHICH WE SHARE, AND A<br />
SAFEGUARD FOR THE LIBERTIES WE CHERISHTHE<br />
SECOND ASPECT OF SHARED EXPERIENCE CONCERNS<br />
EDUCATION, A FIELD WITH WHICH YOU ARE MOST FAMILIAR FROM<br />
YOUR YEARS OF WORK AS A TEACHER. A LOT OF AUSTRALIAN<br />
TEACHERS HAVE IN THE PAST LIVED AND WORKED IN PAPUA NEW<br />
GUINEA. A LOT OF PAPUA NEW GUINEA TEACHERS HAVE<br />
RECEIVED SOME OF THEIR SECONDARY AND TERTIARY EDUCATION<br />
IN AUSTRALIA.<br />
THESE PEOPLE TO PEOPLE LINKS ARE VITAL AND MUST<br />
CONTINUE. OUR EDUCATION SYSTEMS AND PRIORITIES WILL<br />
NECESSARILY DIVERGE SOMEWHAT. BUT WE BOTH KNOW THAT<br />
EDUCATION IN AUSTRALIA AS IN PAPUA NEW GUINEA IS<br />
FUNDAMENTAL. FOR NATION BUILDING-WE BOTH KNOW THAT<br />
EDUCATION SYSTEMS MUST TEACH ACCURATELY AND THOROUGHLY<br />
WHAT OUR NATIONS IPLACE IN THE WORLD MEANS AND HOW WE<br />
MIGHT BOTH WORK WITH EACH OTHERTHAT<br />
MEANS GIVING A PARTICULAR PRIORITY TO TEACHING HOW<br />
OUR TWO COUNTRIES HAVE DEALT WITH EACH OTHER. THIS, I<br />
BELIEVE, IS AN IMPORTANT WAY OF CONTINUING AND<br />
CONFIRMING THE TIES BETWEEN US-</p>
<p>6. A<br />
ICOULD GO ON TALKING ABOUT OUR CRUCIAL AID<br />
RELATIONSHIP, OUR PRACTICAL NETWORKS* OF DEFENCE<br />
CO-OPERATION, OUR IMPORTANT ECONOMIC RELATIONSHIP, OUR<br />
EXCHANGES IN MOST FIELDS OF GOVERNMENT ADMINISTRATION;<br />
THAT GROUND WOULD BE FAMILIAR TO YOU-I WOULD RATHER<br />
CONCLUDE, HOWEVER BY REITERATING A POINT I MADE EARLIER,<br />
THAT WE SHOULD NOT TAKE THE WARMTH AND DEPTH OF OUR<br />
RELATIONSHIP FOR GRANTED. THE RELATIONSHIP REFLECTS<br />
WELL ON BOTH COUNTRIES AND PROMISES BOTH OF US A GREAT<br />
DEAL. IHOPE AND EXPECT THAT YOUR VISIT, YOUR EXCELLENCY, WILL<br />
BE NOT ONLY A CAUSE FOR RE-AFFIRMATION OF OUR TIES BUT A<br />
SPUR TO FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF OUR RELATIONS-</p>
