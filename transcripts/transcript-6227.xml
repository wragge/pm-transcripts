    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong> 8 October 1983</strong></p>
<p>A further increase is to be made in Commonwealth road funds for Queensland which are already running at record levels. </p>
<p>The Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, today announced an extra $10 million has been set aside for Queensland.</p>
<p>This will push expenditure on the State's road system to $ 272.4 million this financial year a rise of 51.3 per cent over 1982-83.</p>
<p>Almost $ 60 million will be spent on local roads, an increase of 60 per cent.</p>
<p>In the last few days, approval has been given for road works in Queensland worth an estimated $ 136 million.</p>
<p>These projects will create 3,000 jobs and include $ 65 mill ion for the Bruce Highway.</p>
<p>Work on the State's National Highways will include:</p>
<ul><li>The dual carriageway to be completed between Brisbane and Nambour;</li>
<li>Major upgrading on the Bruce Highway to include replacement of many old and narrow flood-prone bridges as well as long sections of narrow and weak road pavements;</li>
<li>Construction of the remaining unsealed sections between Morven and Augathella, anrid Winton and Cloncurry, as well as upgrading of long sections of old and narrow pavement;</li>
<li>Work on a second carriageway between Ipswich and Toowoomba.</li>
<li>The Ipswich bypass to be completed and general highway upgrading work carried out on the Cunningham Highway.</li>
</ul><p>Work on arterial roads will include:</p>
<p>Urban</p>
<ul><li>Extending the South East Freeway toward Springwood;</li>
<li>Duplication of the Kingston to Beenleigh Road;</li>
<li>Duplication of the Sanford sub-arterial road between</li>
<li>Dawson Parade and Settlement Road;</li>
<li>Reconstruction of the Brisbane to Woodford Road.</li>
</ul><p>Rural</p>
<ul><li>Extension of the Pacific Highway to Tugun on the new route towards Tweed Heads;</li>
<li>Construction of-the Dawson River Bridge and approaches on the Dawson Highway between Banana and Rolleston;</li>
<li>Upgrading of the Flinders Highway between Townsville and Charters Towers;</li>
<li>Upgrading of the Leichhardt Highway between Goondiwindi and Taroom.</li>
</ul><p>A total of 116 projects on local roads has been approved.</p>
<p>With others approved last month, a total of 283 local road projects have been endorsed this year.</p>
<p>These projects will be undertaken in 110 local government areas.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth funds are allocated under three Local Roads programs.</p>
<p>They are the Road Grants Act, the Australian Bicentennial Road Development program ( ABRD) and the Jobs on Local Roads (JOLOR) scheme.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth funds national roads 100 percent; urban and rural arterial roads by a third; and makes a substantial contribution to local roads, which are maintained by local councils. The increased spending in Queensland will help to meet a number of Comamonwealth aims.</p>
<p>Firstly, it will create more jobs which, in turn, will help to stimulate spending in local areas.</p>
<p>Secondly, it will reduce accidents and imp'rove communications, of particular importance i n a State as large and as decentralised as Queensland.</p>
<p>Thirdly, it will help the tourist industry, especially by making travel to northern centres on the Bruce Highway more attractive.</p>
