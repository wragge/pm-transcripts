PRIME MINISTER'S PRESS CONFERENCE<br />
PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA<br />
TUESDAY 30 JULY 1974<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Are there any questions?<br />
QUESTION: Is it true as Senator Michael Townley alleged in the<br />
Senate today that the Government is proposing to acquire two<br />
Boeing 707' s from Qantas. Have you asked that these planes be<br />
ready for your trip to Indonesia or for any trip anywhere for<br />
that matter? Can these planes be sold by Qantas for $ 20 million,<br />
could the cost of running these planes by $ 12 million a year?<br />
Is one of these planes to be known as " Airforce One"?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: We conduct an independent airforce, so it might<br />
be that we would devise a name of our own. I have no doubt that<br />
you would apply that name to it. There has been, for quite some<br />
time, a suggestion that the Airforce should acquire some of the<br />
surplus, the old model, 707s from Qantas. The Airforce needs<br />
this capacity. Qantas no longer needs the aircraft. Any sale<br />
by Qantas to the Airforce will be on commercial terms. I don't<br />
believe any arrangements have been made yet. I have no doubt<br />
they will be made in due course. There will be many months<br />
required to convert any aircraft which the Airforce buys, not<br />
only to convert the aircraft, but more importantly of course,<br />
to train the air crew and the staff to service them.<br />
QUESTION: Well they go into the VIP fleet soon?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I expect so but, like any of the VIP fleet they<br />
can be used for troop transports, for I think, Cyprus, Butterworth.<br />
I don't know what position any plans are in at the moment but it<br />
would be very many months I am told before there can be any use<br />
by the Airforce of any of these Qantas surplus aircraft.<br />
QUESTION: But that is the intention?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I think in general terms; I don't know that a<br />
decision has been made. I know it has been suggested for quite<br />
some years. It was suggested before we came in. It is one matter<br />
where we haven't made a very quick decision.<br />
QUESTION: Following discussions I understand between ministers<br />
over the past few days, has any decision been made about the<br />
possibility of either increasing our police contingent in Cyprus<br />
or sending Australian troops there as part of -the United Nations<br />
Peace Keeping Force?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The Foreign Minister, Senator Willesee, has been<br />
considering this matter. I haven't spoken to him in the past<br />
hours about it so perhaps you should ask him what the present<br />
position is. It is more likely that we would send troops if the<br />
U. N. asked than to send police. The troops would be more readily<br />
available. They are, of course, entirely within the jurisdiction<br />
of the Australian Government. The police, however, would mainly / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
be in the jursdiction of the State Governments. The Commonwealth<br />
Police Force and the two territory police forces would not be<br />
responsible for more than a small fraction of the police in<br />
Australia. We have had some difficulty in maintaining the police<br />
contingent of about 35 in Cyprus. When the Government was elected<br />
there was some pressure from the States, in fact, to discontinue<br />
our participation. However, I persuaded all the Premiers, except<br />
Queensland, to continue their contribution. I have seen the<br />
police contingent in Cyprus on a couple of occasions and they<br />
undoubtedly do a very effective job.<br />
QUESTION: About how many troops would you consider?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't know. You should ask Senator Willesee<br />
about this.<br />
QUESTION: Can you tell us if there is a Prime ministerial or<br />
ministerial statement on the reported explosion of the fifth test<br />
by the French?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I would expect that Senator Willesee will make<br />
a statement when we have reason to believe that a fifth explosion<br />
has taken place. We have done it after each of the other four.<br />
I think I did, I was acting of course.<br />
QUESTION: The one that occured yesterday morning?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: There will be a statement when we have reason<br />
to believe it.<br />
QUESTION: In view of the fact that many of your ministers and<br />
I name them: Dr Cairns, Dr Cass, Mr Cameron, Mr Bryant and, of<br />
course, Mr Crean have been publicly denunciating economic policies<br />
to the confusion of the people, will you yourself now say in<br />
precise terms what is your Government's policy to combat inflation.<br />
And do you appreciate and agree with the historical analogy that is<br />
being drawn of a parallel between the economic problems of the<br />
Scullin Government and that of your own Government?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well this is a very enticing question. It is put<br />
in very attractive terms and I hope you will forgive me if I don't<br />
respond to all the invitations that you have put so civilly. I<br />
think youi would have got a very good illustration in Question Time<br />
today of the folly of making comments on reports of what ministers<br />
say. The Leader of the Opposition, Mr Snedden, asked Mr Crean<br />
a question obviously based on a story on the front page of the<br />
" Australian", I think it was, that Dr Cairns has said that some<br />
banks might crash. You heard Dr Cairns give a personal explanation<br />
after Question Time that he never made any such statement. Now<br />
I don't blame Mr Snedden because better men than he have fallen<br />
for this trap. In fact the " Australian", right next to this story,<br />
quoted Mr R. V. Cameron, the spokesman for the banks as a whole<br />
I am not referring to Mr Prowse, the spokesman for the " Wales",<br />
I am referring to Mr Cameron, the spokesman for all the banks saying<br />
how irresponsible it was for a senior minister to make such a<br />
statement and, of course, it would have been very irresponsible<br />
for any senior minister or any minister or any member of Parliament<br />
or any Leader of an Opposition to make such a statement. But, no<br />
such statement was made. I discussed this with Dr Cairns; he<br />
discussed it with me yesterday, and he told me how some of the </p>
<p>journalists from other newspapers were called in by their editors<br />
to explain how they missed such a scoop and they pointed out to<br />
their editors that, in fact, Dr Cairns had not said it. He had,<br />
in fact, discounted any such eventuality as regards the banks.<br />
The banks in Australia are all guaranteed by the Reserve Bank<br />
which is guaranteed by the Australian Government, so there will<br />
be no bank crashes in Australia. This is fresh in our minds and<br />
I think it is quite foolish I have always taken this attitude<br />
as you know, t hat I don't comment on reports unless I have seen<br />
the text or heard the speech. In this case there is a story<br />
beaten up on something which was quite inaccurate, so I will not<br />
respond, I regret, to your summary. Even your summary might not<br />
be accurate. I mean you were not there, you didn't hear these<br />
things, you haven't got the text.<br />
QUESTION: A lot of other statements have been made though, Sir,<br />
on economic policies?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well, if you don't mind, I will only comment on<br />
things which I know or can check myself.<br />
QUESTION: Well, with respect, will you say what the Government's<br />
economic policies are then?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: It falls to me to enunciate these things, for<br />
instance, at the Premiers' Conference on 7 June, I did so. There<br />
will be a Premiers' Conference I expect as soon as this session<br />
ends and I will express the Government's policy at that. The<br />
Treasurer gave part of the program last Tuesday. He will be giving<br />
a. very large part of the program on 17 September when he presents<br />
the Budget.<br />
QUESTION: What benefits do you see in wage indexation?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I believe that it avoids the'too frequent and<br />
too large wage and salary claims which are being made at the<br />
moment. These claims are being made so frequently and so excessively<br />
in anticipation of rising prices. Now, indexation will cope with<br />
any increase in prices. It will eliminate the excess and reduce<br />
the frequency of wage claims. I have expressed that view as you<br />
know for some months now.<br />
QUESTION: Is the Government about to announce or have you decided<br />
to bring in new controls or restrictions on travel from Britain<br />
and New Zealand to Australia?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: There has been some correspondence with other<br />
Commonwealth Prime Ministers concerning the same requirements for all<br />
people coming to Australia. At the moment there is discrimination<br />
in travel documents between people of European origin and others.<br />
This has been an unacceptable feature of our relations, for instance,<br />
with Fiji. Accordingly, there has been some correspondence.<br />
QUESTION: Does that mean in fact that you are going to bring in<br />
the same sort of restrictions for British travellers to Australia<br />
as there are for other travellers?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The difference has been between British subjects<br />
of European origin and British subjects of other origins. For instance<br />
in Fiji. / 4 </p>
<p>QUESTION: Can you outline for us any of the ground rules for<br />
the joint sitting next Tuesday?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: There will be a meeting between the Leader of<br />
the House, the Minister in charge of Government business in<br />
the Senate and their counterparts and the Clerks. There have<br />
been some informal meetings up till now but of course it hasn't<br />
been proper to publicise them because one shouldn't give the<br />
impression of counting one's chickens . before they are hatched.<br />
One has to see what the Governor-General's decision will be<br />
and he, of course, only made that this morning so there will<br />
be meetings for this purpose. There will have to be legislation<br />
if privilege is to attach to the proceedings of the joint sitting<br />
such as attaches to the sittings of the individual Houses. We<br />
will have to amend the Parliamentary Broadcasting Act and the<br />
Parliamentary Papers Act in order to give privilege to documents<br />
and I think also the Evidence Act so as to enable proofs to<br />
be given in the courts of the proceedings of a joint sitting<br />
as distinct from the separate sittings which have always taken<br />
place up until now.<br />
QUESTION: In reply to the Rt. Hon. the Leader of the Opposition<br />
in the House this morning, you said that either House can reject<br />
or defer Public Service pay increases. In view of the Government's<br />
call for restraint....<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I think I said reject, or disallow, I don't<br />
think I used the word defer.<br />
QUESTION: Is it the Government's intention to act that way by<br />
using its numbers in the House of Representatives?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well, wait and let us see if there are any of<br />
these determinations that come before it. I think the Rt. Hon.<br />
the Leader of the Opposition to give him the title which he likes<br />
to adopt in the Britishmould. I am satisfied to have a purely<br />
Australian designation. Maybe I am the first Prime Minister since<br />
Deakin to be content with that appellation. Nevertheless, I don't<br />
want to disparage the Rt. Hon. gentleman. He referred to the<br />
proposed $ 16 increase for clerical administrative staff and so on.<br />
Now, that determination I am told was issued only yesterday. It<br />
will be my job to table it. I haven't yet got it. Now, it will<br />
then be open to anybody in the Parliament to move to disallow it.<br />
Either House can disallow determinations, we saw that in respect<br />
to proceedings under the Remuneration Tribunal Act last week. It<br />
has always been possible under the Public Service Arbitration Act.<br />
QUESTION: In reference to your answer to Ken Begg's question<br />
about indexation, you said that it would avoid too frequent and<br />
too large wage claims. How will it do this for salary earners<br />
above the minimum who will find that in fact indexation under<br />
the Cameron plan, if it comes about, will not compensate them<br />
in percentage terms, percentage price rises, and how will it do<br />
it for the crucial metal trades awards for which negotiations<br />
are to take place, I think, immediately after the Moore Conference?<br />
And with respect to the last matter, will the Government be taking<br />
a more active stance in relation to these vital metal trades rounds<br />
of negotiations? </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: The Government's proposals for Mr Justice Moore's<br />
Conference were given to you by Mr Cameron at a press conference<br />
yesterday. I was asked in Question Time a couple of hours ago<br />
about the metal trades matter. At this stage, it is purely<br />
a ' Matter of negotiation. It is not before arbitration. If it<br />
does come before arbitration, then the Government can consider<br />
its attitude. But, frankly we are busy enough without considering<br />
contingencies which might never come about. I was interested<br />
to learn that the employers in the metal trades are now taking<br />
the attitude that because of the Government's more stringent<br />
attitude towards protection for industries, they can't automatically<br />
absorb any wage increases, including those under sweetheart<br />
agreements, and just pass them on to the public. The public<br />
interest is being served in this case very clearly by the<br />
Government's attitude on protection, on tariffs..<br />
QUESTION: And what about the higher paid workers, the fact that<br />
they wont....<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Mr Cameron, I believe, discussed all this with<br />
you yesterday. In our proposal there would be a flat rate increase<br />
for all people above the level to which the Moore Conference<br />
agrees there should be indexation. The Government rejected the<br />
idea that there should be indexation across-the-board. The<br />
Parliament's attitude was shown last week on this matter. For<br />
instance, if there is a 15 per cent increase in the cost of living<br />
it is obviously more necessary, more just, to increase by<br />
per cent the award income of people at the bottom of the salary<br />
scale. This is my argument with the Premier of Queensland,<br />
Mr Bjelke Petersen. As I said at Question Time this morning,<br />
since 1921 the Queensland Parliament has had an act which says<br />
that if the minimum wage ir males in Queensland goes up by a<br />
certain percentage in any financial year then every Member of<br />
Parliament will have his salary increased by the same percentage<br />
for the following year. The Queensland Parliament has adopted a<br />
policy of wage indexation for the top people. The same percentage<br />
as for the bottom people, the minimum people. The Cabinet<br />
considered this yesterday and supported the idea that Mr Crean and<br />
I should discuss this with the Premiers. It is quite futile for us<br />
to have a moratorium between December last and July next for the<br />
people at the top of the salary tree in the federal garden and to<br />
have all the proliferation and luxuriants in the State gardens<br />
because there are twice as many Public Servants emiployed by the<br />
State Governments as by the Australian Government. There are three<br />
times as many ministers, members, judges, in the State gardens<br />
as in the federal garden. Now, if you are to have any economic<br />
impact or even if you are to have any psychological impact it is not<br />
achieved by just having a moratorium on the incomes for 187 members<br />
of the Federal Parliament. You can have a very considerable<br />
economic and psychological impact if you show a similar restraint,<br />
if you have a moratorium for the top people in the States as<br />
well as in the federal.<br />
QUESTION: What is your reaction to the Senate blocking salary rises<br />
for Parliamentarians?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Pleasure.<br />
QUESTION: And the second one, what's your reaction to Mr Snedden's<br />
announced intention that the Opposition plans to vote against the<br />
postal rises in the Senate? / 6 </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: It would be grossly irresponsible. The Post<br />
Office in this new financial year, if there is no increase in<br />
its charges for postal and telegraphic services, will suffer a<br />
deficit of $ 142 million. Last week the Opposition didn't oppose<br />
it outright in the House of Representatives. Apparently events<br />
of last week have gone to their heads as it did last April, they<br />
have decided to oppose them in the Senate. Now, if they are<br />
rejected in the Senate it will be two months before they can be<br />
brought in in the Budget. That means that we will have subsidised<br />
these -losses from taxes to an extent of about $ 25 million.<br />
Now, the previous Government, when Sir Alan Hulme was Postmaster-<br />
General, had a report from the Director-General of Posts and<br />
Telegraphs, the same one who is there now, that there would have<br />
to be these increases. He specified that the basic postal rate<br />
would have to go up from 7 cents to 9 cents. He stated that, and<br />
would later on have to go up to 10 cents and he made similar<br />
projections for the telephone service. So, it was known before<br />
we came into Government. Very soon after coming into Government<br />
we asked Sir James Vernon and two other prominent businessmen,<br />
accountants, to serve as a Royal Commission into the whole of the<br />
operations of the Post Office. Their report came in in April,<br />
it is quite a large one as you know, two volumes, we got it printed<br />
and we tabled it last Tuesday and Sir James Vernon's Royal<br />
Commission recommends these increases. Now, nobody has discounted<br />
or reputed what he had to say on this. In fact, he has recommended<br />
some economies which we have accepted. You remember for about<br />
12 years under the Liberal Government there had been a charge on<br />
users of the services to pay back the capital cost of the services.<br />
Sir James Vernon recommended against that and we have accepted his<br />
recommendation. It was a matter which Mr Crean had highlighted<br />
throughout the 1960s. Now, it seems the grossest irresponsibility<br />
from Opposition, which when it was in Government knew this would<br />
have to be done, which has now had that knowledge reinforced by<br />
Sir James Vernon's Royal Commission, now to say that it will reject<br />
those charges. Now, on 7 June I said to the Premiers that we would<br />
not heed their pleas to put up our taxes in order to pay for their<br />
deficits on their business enterprises. The New South Wales railways<br />
this year were expected to lose $ 170 million. The Victorian<br />
railways were expected to lose this financial year $ 70 million and,<br />
of course, the Post Office is expected to lose $ 142 million, that<br />
I take it if there is no further increases in wages and salaries.<br />
Now I said to the States they would have to make their business<br />
enterprises pay. We were determined to make ours pay. If these<br />
charges are rejected in the Senate the taxpayers as a whole will be<br />
subsidising our enterprises. I suppose if that's the case we ought<br />
to be consistent and subsidise the $ 170 million losses on the<br />
New South Wales railways, the $ 70 million losses on the Victorian<br />
railways. The total is about one-quarter of a billion this year,<br />
losses on State Government enterprises. Now, it is quite inflationary<br />
to subsidise the installation of telephones. No telephone costs<br />
less than $ 2,000 to put on. If you are in an exchange with fewer<br />
than 200 subscribers connected to it the cost is over $ 20,000.<br />
Now if you were installing pieces of machinery or a whole battery of<br />
colour television sets you wouldn't expect the Government to advance<br />
you the capital required. This is the biggest business enterprise<br />
in Australia and it was running down. We got top business people<br />
to advise us and we have accepted their advice and the Opposition<br />
composed, one would think, of people who claim to be businessmen<br />
are rejecting the advice. That is, they are treating Vernon the<br />
way Menzies treated Vernon. I believe the public will see how<br />
irresponsible this is. Why should we put up taxes or keep taxes up<br />
in order to subsidise business enterprises? </p>
<p>QUESTION: Do you think it, is good business now to be purchasing<br />
two 707s from Qantas for the VIP flight?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I am not sure that we are. I didn't give that<br />
impression earlier. I don't know. I will find out if you like,<br />
but I don't know. All'I can say is that the Airforce, for some<br />
years, has said that they need better transport aircraft than<br />
the BAC III. The BAC III hasn't got adequate range. The Cabinet<br />
at the time was misled as to the range. You know that it can't<br />
fly across Australia from east to west in one hop.<br />
QUESTION: What assistance will you be seeking from the State<br />
Premiers when you meet and if you don't get them, what action.<br />
would you take to get them through other methods, other ways,<br />
would you consider perhaps going to the people by way of<br />
referendum? PRIME MINISTER: No, I think the Opposition would be irresponsible<br />
again there. They would scare the people again. But after all,<br />
the things on which we sought powers by referendum are all matters<br />
which are in the powers of the State Parliaments as it is. Now<br />
I have said for months, well over a year, I put it to the Premiers<br />
at. the last inflation conference in May last year that they ought<br />
to do something about their land prices. South Australia has<br />
done so. The other Labor Governments tried to get it through<br />
their Upper Houses but didn't succeed, but this is obviously<br />
something which is within the powers of the State Governments.<br />
They don't make any more land and it can't be carried across a<br />
State border, they can regulate the increase in prices.<br />
QUESTION: But that's not your exhaustive list I presume?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, as I understand what they are prepared to<br />
discuss is a concerted program among themselves of how they<br />
would exercise these matters. I give you a specific instance of<br />
something that they could do and they should have done and people<br />
have suffered in the meantime because they haven't.<br />
QUESTION: What's your view of the argument that a Cabinet of<br />
27 ministers is too large a body to take decisive action on<br />
economic policies. Would you favour adopting perhaps the Liberal/<br />
Country Party Government's practice of having an inner and outer<br />
Cabinet? PRIME MINISTER: I agree that 27 is too large a Cabinet to deal<br />
with such matters. I believe that there ought not be more than<br />
half that number of ministers. The United States gets by with<br />
a Cabinet of about 8. But I am not saying that that is the universal<br />
experience, I think Canada has a larger one than we. There is a<br />
very great deal of loose talk goes on about how we conduct our<br />
affairs. Our work is done at Cabinet committees and the largest<br />
of those committees consists of 12 men and then the Cabinet considers<br />
recommendations which each committee makes on the submissions that<br />
the various ministers have made. Those committees are augmented by<br />
the presence of any minister who does not belong to that committee<br />
but who has a submission on the subject which comes before that<br />
committee. Now this has been public knowledge, I would have thought,<br />
for the last year and a half. The 27 do not consider things from<br />
the outset, each committee considers such matters. There is the<br />
Welfare Committee,' there is the Foreign Affairs and Defence<br />
Committee, there is the Economic Committee, Legislation. </p>
<p>-8-<br />
QUESTION: How much say will the Caucus have in the framing of<br />
the Budget and if they do have some say in it, what safeguards<br />
will there be about leakage of information on which people could<br />
profiteer? PRIME MINISTER: There were no leaks before the last Budget.<br />
There was one reason why we brought in some of those extra<br />
Customs and Excise matters last week because there would have<br />
inevitably have been speculation if we had waited until the<br />
17 September. We brought in legislation which will avoid it now<br />
but by bringing it in earlier, a month earlier than it ordinarily<br />
would have been, two months earlier than the Budget itself will come<br />
in this time, we would have been able to avoid that speculation.<br />
None of you brought up any whiske~ y last Tuesday.<br />
QUESTION: Did Mr Crean's statements of last Tuesday night contain<br />
all of the anti-inflationary matters that you would have like'to<br />
have seen announced at that second stage of the Government's<br />
program. PRIME MINISTER: No.<br />
QUESTION: Can you tell us what<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No. Well, gentlemen, I hope you won't feel<br />
that I am being perceptive or evasive if I do not answer any<br />
fiscal questions. You would be rather amazed if I were to I am<br />
too responsible to do that and all of you gentlemen would be too<br />
responsible to give your readers, your viewers, any impression<br />
that a Head of Government would be so irresponsible.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Oh wait a moment, there is a beauty. I was<br />
hoping I would get a question from the Canberra Times and I was going<br />
to put it to you. It is a matter of very great moment, it is on<br />
behalf of Harry M. Miller well, I shouldn't have been so blatant.<br />
Next year from 7 March to 16 March, Canberra will stage a major<br />
festival devoted specifically to Australian creative arts and<br />
sciences. It is intended to make this a biennial event. Next<br />
year's festival will be called " Australia In keeping with<br />
my Government's practical support for the arts we have made a grant<br />
of $ 45,000 towards the cost of mounting this festival, although<br />
it is being organised with the intention of being as close to<br />
self-supporting as possible. The organisers hope to attract a public<br />
happy to pay for the enjoyment of seeing and hearing some of our<br />
exciting national achievements in the arts and sciences.<br />
Mr Harry M. Miller has accepted an invitation by the Festival<br />
Board to work as consultant to the festival organisation. He will<br />
work in collaboration with the artistic director, Mr Stefan Haag,<br />
and will be responsible for promotion and public relations areas.<br />
Between 1967 and 1970 Mr Miller was a commercial consultant to<br />
the Elizabethan Theatre Trust, and is well-known as producer of<br />
his own theatre productions. He is Chairman of the Art Gallery<br />
Society of New South Wales and a member of the Board of the<br />
National Institute of Dramatic Art. He trained me for this elocution. </p>
