STATW~ NT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, RT. HON. R. G. MENZIES QGC., M. P.,<br />
iN THIE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES ON TUESDAY7 24th FEBRUARY, 1959<br />
INDONESIA AND ' JEST NEWi GUINEA<br />
What has been our policy?<br />
1. 14e recognise Dutch sovereignty of tUest New Guinea;<br />
we have supported and continue to support this sovereignty.<br />
2. We say that if sovereignty is to be changed it must<br />
be by legal methods, i. e. by some means which international law<br />
accepts and recognises.<br />
3. We have in the United Nations taken up the position<br />
that Indonesian submissions on this Netherlands territory are<br />
neither in substance nor in form within the effective jurisdiction<br />
of the political organisation of the United Nations; that it is<br />
not the function of the Genc-ral Assembly to interpret agreements<br />
nor to pass judgments on questions of ' territorial sovereignty.<br />
This did not and does not exclude a reference by the parties to<br />
the International Court.<br />
4. We have advocated and still advocate the reference<br />
to the International Court of the Indonesian claim to sovereignty.<br />
The Dutch have previously expressed their willingness; Indonesia<br />
has refused. We have always maintained that the paramount<br />
interest ultimately is that of the indigenous population. This<br />
view recog. 7nises sovereignty, but looks to the future in terms of<br />
self-determination. The same goes for Australian New Guinea and<br />
Pa pua,<br />
Has there been any change?<br />
NO. On two occasions during Dr. Subandrio's very welcome<br />
visit I had the opportunity of stating Australia's position. I<br />
will put to the House that position in substantially the terms in<br />
which, as Prime Minister, I stated it to Dr. Subandrio.<br />
ie are and always have been of opinion that the<br />
Netherlands has sovereignty over ', est New Guinea. If,<br />
as you clearly do, you dispute this, the matter should<br />
be determined by a lawful process, i. e. either by<br />
adjudication or by agreement arrived at in free discussion.<br />
" de are certainly not prepared to urge the Dutch to<br />
negotiate. You have made it clear publicly in<br />
Australia that your conception of a negotiation is<br />
that it should lead to and work out the conditions of<br />
a transfer of sovereignty. Under these circumstances,<br />
for us to urge the Dutch to negotiate would be to take<br />
up the position that we desire to see the sovereignty<br />
changed. This would be a clear reversal of our policy,<br />
and we will not do it. Je will therefore not<br />
advocate a negotiation. </p>
<p>w 2.<br />
But should Indonesia and the Netherlands come<br />
to some agreement in the future about sovereignty,<br />
we will recognise and respect it, just as we expect<br />
our own sovereignty to be recognised.<br />
This is not to say that we are not deeply<br />
concerned with the future of the indigenous populations<br />
of New Guinea. UJe are most concerned. Ie are<br />
developing our own portions of New Guinea alonga lines<br />
which will, we hope, in due course, lead to selfdetermination.<br />
W1e expect similar policies in West<br />
New Guinea.<br />
Ile would desire that Indonesia should publicly<br />
affirm that force will not be resorted to in order to<br />
establish territorial claims. This principle is vital<br />
to Australia and her owm security.<br />
de would think it a tragedy if our differences on<br />
the matter of . Vest New Guinea and the Netherlands should<br />
impair the development of sensible friendship and mutual<br />
understanding between our two countries. Indonesia is<br />
our nearest neighbour of great population; we both<br />
have much to gain from peace; we are not disposed to fall<br />
into war with each other; in your search for democratic<br />
government and administration, your dangers, like ours,<br />
come from undemocratic and aggressive world movements.<br />
You will find Australians an instinctively friendly<br />
people, clear in their views about New Guinea, for<br />
vividly remembered historic reasons, an tl givul<br />
disturbed by your treatment of Dutch assets. But if we<br />
can isolate these matters of difference and see them<br />
dealt with in a lawful way, there is no reason why we<br />
should not live as friendly neighbours, with mutual<br />
assistance and tolerance, with common hopes and interests.<br />
The joint communique of the two Ministers was designed<br />
to give effect to these propositions.<br />
Uhat are the complaints? Dr. Evatt must face up to some specific questions.<br />
1. Does he regard a disputed territorial claim as unfit<br />
for adjudication in the International Court, the supreme<br />
adjudicating organ of the United Nations? For, though he<br />
says there is " nothing to decide" the fact is that<br />
Indonesia does claim, as against the Dutch, sovereignty<br />
over West New Guinea. There is thus a clear justiciable<br />
issue.<br />
2. Suppose Indonesia decided to accept the jurisdiction<br />
of the Court, would Dr. Evatt deny that jurisdiction?<br />
If so, why?<br />
3. If the Court decided the issue of sovereignty in<br />
favour of Indonesia, would Dr. Evatt ( in my place)<br />
repudiate the decision, or accept it?<br />
Should he accept, how would the case differ from a<br />
transfer of sovereignty freely agreed upon between the two parties<br />
principal. Can the Court do by judgment what the parties cannot do<br />
by free agreement or settlement? </p>
<p>Should he reject the decision, what would he do to<br />
make his rejection effective? Would he move the United Nations<br />
to overrule the Court? igould he quarrel with both the Dutch and<br />
the Indonesians, each of whom had, 21 hyp : he. s, accepted the<br />
jurisdiction of the Court? Would he really think that the United<br />
Nations would vote to overrule the Court?<br />
But pursue the matter further.<br />
Dr. Subandrio is reported to have named the Labour<br />
government of Australia, chiefly moved on this matter by Dr. Evatt<br />
himself, as " the midwife" of the new Indonesian Republic.<br />
Suppose the Dutch had, at the hand-over, included<br />
' Jest New Guinea with Java and Sumatra and the rest of the Netherlands<br />
East Indies in the transfer, would Dr. Evatt, as midwife, have<br />
refused to deliver the additional child?<br />
What could or would the Labour government have done<br />
had W4est New Guinea been included?<br />
And if the Dutch at some future time, exercising<br />
their own judgment ( and we are clear that any decision must be<br />
made freely and no under threat or duress) were to decide to<br />
add West New Guinea to the transfer, notwithstanding, the fact that<br />
we recognise and clearly support their claim to sovereignty, what<br />
could or would an Australian government do, except recognise the<br />
new sovereignty as lawful?<br />
It is said that we have changed our policy. I venture<br />
to assert that it is the Labour Party which has changed its policy.<br />
On Wednesday last, Dr. Evatt said:<br />
" The Minister seems to suppose that, if sovereignty<br />
over West New Guinea resides in the Netherlands, it<br />
can be transferred at the will of the Nethcrlands<br />
to Indonesia, and that will be the end of the matter.<br />
But it is not.'"<br />
But in 1949, Dr. Evatt's government thought the<br />
matter one between Indonesia and the Netherlands. Thus, on October<br />
7, 1949, in answer to a question by Mr. Falkinder, Dr. Evatt, as<br />
Minister, said<br />
" Sovereignty of Dutch New Guinea is in the Netherlands,<br />
and it is for the Netherlands to say whether Dutch New<br />
Guinea shall come into the agreement. From our point<br />
of view the relationship of Dutch New Guinea with the<br />
Indonesian Republic and the future government of the<br />
territories concerned are matters primarily for the<br />
Dutch and Indonesian governments. I repeat that our<br />
interest is that there should be a peaceful settlement<br />
of that question."<br />
The whole of this controversy appears to have sprung<br />
from a mis-interpretation of the words " would not oppose such an<br />
agreement." These words have been twisted to mean that Australia<br />
will actually encourage the making of such an agreement. This is<br />
not our attitude, as we made crystal clear to Dr. Subandrio in<br />
the statements I have already recalled. It just could not be our<br />
attitude. For years we have not only accepted and supported Dutch<br />
sovereignty, but have also supported the Netherlands in the United<br />
Nations. So clearly have we contemplated a continuance of Dutch<br />
administration that, as rocently as November 6th 1957 the<br />
Australian and Netherlands Governments publicly Aefineci the jointly<br />
agreed principles being followed in respect of their New Guinea<br />
territories. </p>
<p>p These principles included a declaration of the basic<br />
importance of the interesta and inalienable rights of the indigenous<br />
inhabitants; and the need for co-operation in policy and administration,<br />
having regard to the geographical and ethnological association<br />
between the two sections of New Guinea. The two governments agreed<br />
that they would continue and strengthen their co-operation. In<br />
conclusion, they said:<br />
" In so doing the two Governments are determined to<br />
promote an uninterrupted development of this process<br />
until such time as the inhabitants of the territories<br />
concerned will be in a position to determine their own<br />
future. " 1<br />
Nothing that we have said or done modifies or<br />
contradicts this joint declaration in any way.<br />
If honourable members will look at the relevant<br />
paragraph of the recent communique they will see that our nonopposition,<br />
or, as I would prefer to say, our recognition, is to<br />
attach only if and after an agreement is reached " 1between the<br />
Netherlands and Indonesia as parties principal, arrived at by<br />
peaceful processes and in accordance with internationally accepted<br />
principles." 1 It seems to have been overlooked by some that this<br />
communique contains at least three other statements about New Guinea<br />
which are of significance for Australia.<br />
The first is that it is now on record in this joint<br />
document, which will be studied in Indonesia, that Australia not<br />
only recognises Netherlands sovereignty but also recognises in<br />
respect of New Guinea thJ principles of self-determination.<br />
The second is that we have stipulated that any<br />
agreement should accord with " internationally accepted principles".<br />
Those principles are in some important ways expressed in the Charter<br />
of the United Nations. They certainly include a recognition of the<br />
duties to native peoples arid their ultimate right of self-determination,<br />
( As Mr. Joske pointed out to the House on Thursday last,<br />
one of the international principles, binding on Indonesia, the<br />
Netherlands, and Australia as member nations of the United Nations,<br />
is expressed in Article 73 of the Charter. We think that under that<br />
article all the inhabitants of New Guinea, W4est or East, whoever has<br />
the responsibility of administration, have interests declared to be<br />
paramount. These, as I have said, are referred to in the joint<br />
communique, and were emphasised by us in the discussions,)<br />
The third is that Indonesia expressly renounces the<br />
use of force to sustain its claim to West New Guinea. In view of<br />
some threats and rumours of threats, we attach great importance to<br />
this statement as no doubt will other powers concerned in the peace<br />
of South East Asia, and the South-West Pacific.<br />
There is another aspect of this matter to which I<br />
would wish to make a brief reference.<br />
We have stated that we will not put pressure on either<br />
of the parties to come to any new arrangement. It should however,<br />
be understood that we are not forgetting our special relations w-ith<br />
the Netherlands, our joint declaration of November 1957, and the<br />
importance we attach to the development of the indigenous inhabitants<br />
of New Guinea as a whole. We therefore have a lively and continuing<br />
interest in the result of any negotiations should the Netherlands,<br />
freely decide to engage in them. We would therefore naturally<br />
expect to have our voice heard on the matters which affect the future<br />
of New Guinea. </p>
<p>We are not aware of any Netherlands intention to<br />
negotiate, but clearly any negotiation would relate to a variety<br />
of aspects of the future of West New Guinea and its inhabitants.<br />
Conclusion It is, I think, unfortunate that our friendly and<br />
frank, but civilised talks, with a ncar and significant neighbour<br />
should have given rise, hure and there, to such intemperate<br />
forebodings. My own government has a clear record of friendly<br />
association with the Dutch, with whom we have, and will, expand as<br />
opportunity offers, the administrative contacts to which I have<br />
referred in respect of our various sections of New Guinea. We<br />
have made it plain that the Dutch will most certainly be under no<br />
pressure from us either to negotiate or withdraw. But it would<br />
be offensive to them to suggest that they are not their own masters<br />
in these as in other things.<br />
We have equally made it clear to Indonesia that,<br />
apart from our firmly-hield views on the Dutch issues we desire<br />
friendship, understanding and peace. We think that the recent<br />
talks advanced these desires.<br />
Before I finish, I would like to reiterate Australia's<br />
genuine interest in the welfare of the young and growing nation of<br />
Indonesia. We were all impressed by the visit which we have just<br />
had from Dr. Subandrio indicatin,-, as it did, his Government's real<br />
desire for co-operation. Wie were impressed by Dr. Subandrio<br />
himself, personally and as the representative of a very significant<br />
neighbour, whose scores of millions of people live so close to us,<br />
and whose good will is so important for our own future. I am bound<br />
to say that his friendly, w. ell-informed, and intelligent approach<br />
to us and his explanations of Indonesian problems, have done nothing<br />
but good in clearing the air of misconceptions which may have<br />
existed in some minds. Should ill-considered criticisms of the<br />
outcome of his visit damage the relations strengthened by this<br />
visit, it would be a stop backwards. I hope that there will be an<br />
end to doubts and fears now that our position has been made clear.<br />
With the compliments of<br />
Hugh Dash,<br />
Press Secretary to the Prime Minister,<br />
