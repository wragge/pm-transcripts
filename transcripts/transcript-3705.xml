PRIME MINISTER Press Statement No. 496<br />
April 1975<br />
SECOND ORPHAN FLIGHT<br />
The Prime minister, Mr Whitlam, said a chartered<br />
Qantas 707 would leave tomorrow morning to bring back to<br />
Australia a group of Vietnamese children whose departure<br />
from the Republic of Vietnam for adoption in Australia<br />
had been approved by the Government of the Republic of<br />
Vietnam and for whom a sufficient number of approved<br />
adoptive parents were waiting in Australia.<br />
Arrangements would be similar to those made for<br />
the first flight. RAAF C-130 ( Hercules) aircraft would<br />
fly the children from Saigon to Bangkok where they would<br />
board the charter flight.<br />
Dr W. A. Langsford Acting Deputy Director G~ eneral<br />
of the Department of Health will be in charge of the party<br />
which will include Dr J. Forbes, Head of the Fairfield<br />
Infectious Diseases Hospital in Melbourne ( where the<br />
children will be taken on arrival) and a group of about<br />
medical and nursing personnel.<br />
The medical personnel will fly on to Saigon on<br />
RAAF aircraft and escort the children throughout their<br />
flight back to Australia.<br />
The Prime Minister said that this would be a<br />
smaller uplift than it had been possible to arrange for<br />
the first charter flight. It was expected that there would<br />
be about 77 children brought to Australia. This reflected,<br />
and emphasised, the fact that there were few children in<br />
Saigon waiting for adoption at this stage who fulfilled the<br />
requirements of the Saigon Government and the Australian State<br />
Government S.<br />
The Qantas charter aircraft will carry about<br />
12 tonnes of relief supplies for Vietnam.<br />
The aircraft is expected to return to Melbourne<br />
at approximately 0630 on Friday 18 April.<br />
