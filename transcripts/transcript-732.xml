GREY BY-ELECTION MEETING HELD AT PORT<br />
PIRIE, SOUTH AUSTRALIA<br />
ON 6TH MAY, 1963<br />
Speech by the Prime MInIster, the Rt. Hong Sir Robert Menzies<br />
Sir Mr. Premier, Parliamentary Colleagues and Ladies and<br />
Gentlemen I want to say how indebted I am to the Premier<br />
( Interjector " Speak up") Can't you hear me? ( Laughter)<br />
I am very indebted to the Premiei who was this afternoon ssfroray<br />
from here as Mount Gambiev for having come up here tonight<br />
they tell me that he knew the road so well that he drove<br />
himself. ( Laughter) ( Applause)<br />
But before I begin to engage in a by-election<br />
speech in a political statement, I would like to say here in<br />
Port Pirie how much I regret the occasion of this by-election.<br />
After all, you had for very many years the late Mr. Russell as<br />
your Member, and in my experience of him, he spared no effort<br />
in his desire to serve you in Parliament0 ( Hear hear.<br />
Applause) We all liked him li. ry much. I was delighted as I<br />
came in here tonight to have the opportunity of shaking hands<br />
with his daughter, who gave him devoted assistance for a long,<br />
long time in the work that he was doing for you, ( Applause)<br />
But the fact that he has gcne and that we ar-e<br />
having a by-election will serve to dlsolose, I think, a very<br />
interesting fact, and that was that Edgar Russell probably<br />
secured many votes from people who woul-d not not normally be<br />
Labour supporters, I am ncit criticising that; I think it<br />
admirable but I think it vas due to his own personality and<br />
his contacts with people in the electorate, so that the Party<br />
lines as we would normally call them tended to be blurred.<br />
That Is entirely an honcurable thing to be recorded about any<br />
man0 But it means that at this by-election we will tend, I<br />
suppose, to come back to what I will call Party lines so that<br />
people who are Liberals will support the Liberal candidate and<br />
people who are Labour will support the Labour candidate except<br />
those who support the Independent Labour candidate and so on.<br />
And I am here, not only as Prime Minister, but as Leader of<br />
the Liberal Party to do what I can to bring about the result<br />
of having Mr. V. Dyason in the Federal Parliament. ( Applause)<br />
And for that reason, of course I am delighted to see so big<br />
a meeting and delighted to find that apart from one chap who is<br />
so eager to get to question time that he can hardly wait<br />
( Laughter) there appears to be a very sound body of opinion<br />
represented here tonight in favour of the candidate I am<br />
supporting. Now, Sir, we have had up in Canberra, a couple of<br />
" No Confidence" motions and when an Opposition moves a " No<br />
Confidence" motion it, as A rule, selects the topic as the topic<br />
on which it would like to go to an election if it won in the<br />
vote, After all, let us admit it at once my Government has,<br />
with a Speaker in the Chair, a majority ol one in division.<br />
A majority of one. ( To interjector And if the one were you,<br />
my friend I would resign at once) ( Applause) After all, if<br />
an Opposition moves a " No Confidence" motion, and the Government<br />
has a majority of one, then all the Opposition has to do is to<br />
detach one voter from the Government side if possible and the<br />
Government is out and we are out to the country at an election.<br />
And, therefore, it is proper, I think, to regard the first of<br />
60096.0.0./ 2 </p>
<p>2-<br />
their " No Confidence" motions which was fairly general, as<br />
representing the issues on which they want to go to the<br />
country and, therefore, I think I am entitled to treat them<br />
as the issues on which they would desire the Grey by-election<br />
to be fought, and I want to say something about the two issues<br />
which they raise, One of them is internal and the other is external.<br />
It makes a fair balance, if I say something to yoa, I hope not<br />
tediously, about each of them. In the first place, they said<br />
that our economic management of the affairs of Australia had<br />
resulted in chaos, in next-door to disaster, in the halting<br />
of the economic processes, in a stagnant economy; in fact, I<br />
could hardly remember all the words that they used to describe<br />
the shocking state that Australia is in. And yet, I must<br />
say as one who goes around Australia a fair bit, I don't feel<br />
that I am going through a country that is suffering from<br />
disaster. Do you? Some of these people who talk about<br />
Australia being in a depressed condition, near disaster, ought<br />
to have a look at some other countries in the world. I venture<br />
to say to you, and I say this after now being continuously in<br />
office for over thirteen years, that this country has the<br />
highest standard of living of any country in the world.<br />
( Applause) ( To interjectors Save it up, boys; save it<br />
up, and practise the questions for after the meeting. Sit<br />
down) I will be able to answer questions when the meeting is<br />
over, Now, Sir, let me just support that broad statement.<br />
We have had, in this period of time, the most tremendous<br />
development in Australia. If you look around the nation<br />
and the nation matters and see the enormous works of development<br />
that have gone on all over Australia in the last ten years,<br />
then you will at once admit that; there has been a tremendous<br />
period of developmento Now, a great period of development in<br />
the country ( Now this silly chap is talking on his fingers<br />
to me ( Laughter) You would almost think I was deaf. Save it<br />
up, mate. Save it up, Go out and buy a bottle of soda water)<br />
( Laughter) Now, I was saying, ladies and gentlemen and<br />
everybody here knows it is true we have had the most phenomenal<br />
development going on in this country, and that development has<br />
been made possible for a variety of reasons, one of which is<br />
the fact that we have had a tremendous programme of migration<br />
into Australia during that time, and it is quite clear to<br />
anybody who looks into the matter that unless we had had this<br />
enormous population increase, we could nev ELave had this degree<br />
of development that we have had in the last ten years,<br />
( Interjector " Who brought them in, Bob?") The Labour Party.<br />
I agree, ( Laughter) You know, I am very glad you made that<br />
interjection because this great migration programme was begun<br />
by the Labour Government in which Mr. Calwell was the Minister<br />
for Immigration, and I have always made it quite clear that I<br />
regard this as a very statesmanlike action ,....( Interjector<br />
" You was a Labour man") I've never been a Labour man, Oh, ho,<br />
ho. ( Laughter) ( Applause) Oh, really, if you repeat that you<br />
will hurt my feelings, ( Laughter) I have my own pride, you<br />
must remember that. Oh, sit down. You know I have a sneaking<br />
idea they came here to hear me, not you, ( Applause)<br />
You will, of course, ladies and gentlemen, not<br />
fail to realise that whenever somebody like myself is on a<br />
platform and scoring something, some alleged Labour supporter<br />
will get up and squeal like a stuck pig. It is always the<br />
way. I repeat One of the statesmanlike things done by the </p>
<p>-3-<br />
last Labour Government was to implement the migration<br />
programme and the migration programme will always be<br />
associated, to his credit with Arthur Calwell. I have<br />
given him credit, time after time. The amazing thing to<br />
me is that although if I were a Labour man I would be<br />
claiming credit heavens high for the migration programme,<br />
half the Labour interjectors I encounter around Australia<br />
are not only ashamed of the immigration programme. but appear<br />
to be against it. That is an astonishing thing 6o me,<br />
because without it, we wouldn't have had the rate of development<br />
that we have hado<br />
Now, there is another factor in this matter.<br />
Australia with 10 million, 10J million people can't<br />
( Interjector 11) !-ell, it will soon be 11. You do<br />
something about it. ( Laughter) ( Applause) Now, ladies and<br />
gentlemen, with 10 million, 101, 11 million people in<br />
Australia. we cannot out of our own savings though we do<br />
save money very well we cannot cut of our own savings,<br />
produce all the capital moneys that are needed to develop<br />
this country at the rate at which we must develop it, if we<br />
are to hold it. Therefore, we have found, over these last<br />
ten years, a tremendous coming-in of capital from outside<br />
Australia not just coming in on Government borrowings;<br />
there has been a little of that but coming in primarily by<br />
the establishment or building up of new industries in<br />
Australia. Hundreds of millions each year come into Australia<br />
on private capital investment account and this has been a<br />
phenomenally good thing for us, Wherever I go in Australia,<br />
I can see factories, enterprises of various kinds which are<br />
there because overseas investors had enough confidence in<br />
this country, in the stability of its government, in the<br />
liveliness of its future, to invest their money in it, and<br />
you will see that wherever you goo<br />
Have you ever heard any Labour leader in the<br />
Federal Parliament say a kind word about investment from<br />
overseas because I never have, I would be fascinated to<br />
know who her anybody in the audience over heard a good word<br />
spoken by Labour about overseas investment in Australia, On<br />
the contrary one of their great slogans is that Australia<br />
is putting itself in pawn to the rich overseas interests.<br />
Now ladies and gentlemen, that is one of the other factors<br />
in the growth. But another factor is related to our internal<br />
attitude in Australia, the spirit of confidence, the desire<br />
to get on with the job and that reflects itself in the fact<br />
that in the primary industries vital to our future the<br />
cost level of which is vital to future we have seen,<br />
in my own time of office most remarkable increases in<br />
production. I'm not talking in terms of money, but talking<br />
in terms of actual physical production of the matters concerned.<br />
I had a look at the figures I won't weary you with many of<br />
them. Beef and veal 37 per cent, up sugar 96 per cent, up;<br />
wool 61 per cent, up; wheat 30 per cent. up; mutton and<br />
lamb 83 per cent, up. These are very remarkable figures<br />
because they show that in spite of all the difficulties of<br />
varying prices, the problems that primary industries have had<br />
in overseas markets all the kinds of problems that we have<br />
had leading up to the discussions on the Common Market, the<br />
man on the land in Australia has kept on improving his efficiency<br />
and increasing his production and the result is that the nation<br />
is wealthier to that extent. </p>
<p>Now, Sir, apart from that let me say thiso<br />
When we came into office when was it? at the end of 1949,<br />
Australia was importing coal. We had the finest coal measures<br />
in the Southern Hemisphere but we were importing coal5 and we<br />
were importing coal because the coal-mining industry had been<br />
allowed to fall into a state of chaos,, ( Interjector -" Rubbish")<br />
These are the factsø Well you must tell me sometime how it is<br />
that we had to import coal, If we had all the coal in the<br />
ground, we were still importing it and importing it from India,<br />
from South Africa, paying through the nose for the freights on<br />
it because charter rates were extraordinarily high.<br />
Today, the production of coal in Australia has gone<br />
up 64 per cent. and so far fr'om having to import coal we are<br />
now developing a growing and substantial export market for coal.<br />
Indeed, one of the things done by my Governmont on the east coast<br />
has been, in relation to Gladstone and Newcastle, to provide<br />
extra coal-loading facilities so that these export markets<br />
could be developed. Now, that is a pretty good thing isn't it?<br />
Something that any Government might be proud of any group of<br />
governments might be proud of to know that in these important<br />
commodities, productivity in Austre. lia in actual terms has been<br />
going up. And indeed, Sir, we are now, as a result of a series<br />
of wise incentive policies on our part, developing with the<br />
co-operation of intelligent manufacturers, exports of manufactured<br />
good, There was a time ( Interjector " How many shares<br />
have you got?") Look, don't cry yourself to sleep wanting to<br />
know how many shares IVve got in something. I've got a terrific<br />
set of shares in Australia Unlimited. ( Hear, hear. Applause)<br />
Now, Sir3 I was saying about manufacturing, that<br />
we decided that we oughtn~ t to have all our eggs in one basket,<br />
that we ought not to depend as much as we have in the past on<br />
the exports of primary prcducts0 We need to develop our exports<br />
in that field,, We need, and we are working for it at this<br />
very moments both here and abroad, to get a more stabilised price<br />
level " or the things that are produced on the land, a safer<br />
market, a more stable market, But if we are going to be a large<br />
country, industrialized as well as on the land, then we must<br />
develop export manufactures. ( Inaudible interjections) All<br />
right. Some chap who is obviously an old friend of mine, he<br />
says Did he say that the Labour Party did this thirty<br />
years ago? I wonder0( Interjector " Remember what you<br />
said thirty years ago") Of course I can't,. Ive even forgotten<br />
what stupid remarks you were making thirty years ago, ( Laughter,<br />
Applause) When Labour went out of office, the exports of<br />
manufactured goods from Austra]. ia were œ 29M and this year, they<br />
are œ 134M. Now that is a tremendous growth from œ 29M to<br />
œ 134M and I am hoping very much that as a result of the taxation<br />
incentives and other arrangements that have been made, we will<br />
find that our manufacturing industries will increasingly be<br />
able to produce, at a cost level which will enable them to<br />
compete in overseas markets and Lord knows, there are plenty<br />
of them around Australia on competitive terms, and when that<br />
happens we will find that we have a balanced economic growth.<br />
But all these things, if they are to be done, require something<br />
that is not always popular, They require a stable value of<br />
money. You can't expect the man on the land to go on saying," Oh,<br />
yes. I'll keep on producing, I'll increase my production of<br />
this or that" if in fact inflation is going on inside Australia<br />
so fast that all his costs have built up against him while his<br />
.00./ 5 </p>
<p>price from overseas remains uninfluenced by inflation. And<br />
therefore, for the man on the land, stable currency is of the<br />
essence, And for the manufacturer, people say, " Oh, well,<br />
he doesn't care because he can pass it on to the customer,"<br />
A manufacturer can't pass it on to the overseas customer,<br />
Therefore, he has a tremendous interest in keeping his costs<br />
stable ana, indeed, cutting them down by increased efficiency<br />
of plant and of management and so one And the man who is<br />
employed, whether it is on the land or in the city, in the<br />
factory, he has a lively interest in avoiding inflation because<br />
I may tell you, to take a simple example, he is a very<br />
substantial holder of savings in the savings banks.<br />
Do you know, ladies and gentlemen, it is a thing<br />
worth remembering, that in the savings banks Australia, there<br />
are 10 million accounts and that the average in each of these<br />
accounts is f185. That shows how poverty-stricken we are in<br />
Australia, Ten million accounts in savings banks average<br />
œ 18o5 And the employee who has money in the savings bank<br />
he doesntt want to see the value of it run away by inflation.<br />
The man and there are millions of them in Australia who<br />
insures his life against his old age for lage or small sums<br />
doesn't want to see the value of his insurance run awayo<br />
Let me remindl you that there is no man who has got a livelier<br />
interest in stabilised price levels than tha man who works for<br />
wages. And what has occurred?<br />
The fact is that as a result of policies which<br />
sometimes have been unpopular I remember them very well<br />
we have had stability i. n the cost and price level in Australia<br />
for just about three years, This, of course, is the most<br />
tremendous encouragement to people from other countries who<br />
are looking around with surplus capital to invest and who are<br />
looking for a country in which there is stability, in which<br />
there is security, in which there won't be ratbag governments<br />
or irresponsible governments. They have had plenty of<br />
experience in South America of countries that turned out to<br />
be completely unreliableo Increasingly, they are coming here<br />
and so far from resenting it I take great pride in it and I<br />
hope and believe that Australians all do,<br />
Having spoken about that, I want to turn to the<br />
other branch of the famous censure motiono ( Interjector<br />
" I want to ask you a question") Oh, well, you are in a bit<br />
of a hurry, lad, because when the meeting is over, when I am<br />
finished you can get up and ask it but I might tell you in<br />
advance that I will listen to the question and you'll jolly<br />
well listen to the answero ( Applause)<br />
Now, ladies and gentlemen, I perhaps occupied a<br />
little too much time on that, because I want to turn to the<br />
external problems on which the Labour Party took us to task,<br />
What was their policy when they dealt with external affairs?<br />
It seemed to me that they had two or three points and these<br />
ought to be understood because if they win the next election,<br />
these two or three points of theirs will represent the policy<br />
of Australia, so let's all be careful as to what we are doing<br />
about it. Dontt think you can have the best of all worlds at<br />
all times. If the present Government's policy is bringing us<br />
in the world, increasingly, friendship and security, then you<br />
must hesitate before you throw it away in order to experiment<br />
with people whose policy I am just now about to describe. </p>
<p>6<br />
First of all they said, " Internationally, well,<br />
Australia has some troops in Malaya." Quite true, we have some<br />
troops in Malaya as part of the strategic reserve under the<br />
South East Asia Treaty. The South East Asia Treaty which we<br />
signed, which we advocated, contains in its membership Pakistan.<br />
Thailand, the Philippines, Australia and New Zealand, France and<br />
the United States of America and the United Kingdom. This is<br />
the group included in the South East Asia Treaty, commonly called<br />
SEATO. And we have, with Great Britain, and New Zealand,<br />
contributed to a relatively small reserve force in Malaya0 When<br />
it went there, our friends the Malayans, under their distinguished<br />
Prime Minister, the Tunku Abdul Rhaman, were being harassed by<br />
a lot of Communist bandits in their northern counties. These<br />
people were being fed and assisted from across the border and<br />
it took a long time to defeat them and control them, and our<br />
troops took a part in this business I had always thought, with<br />
the warm approval of the general public of Australian<br />
But the Labour policy, as expressed the other day<br />
by a prominent front-bench Member and you know front-bench<br />
Members of the Opposition at Canberra don't speak outside the<br />
instructions of the 36 men outside, so this is authoritative you<br />
may be perfectly certain he said, " Well, withdraw the troops<br />
from Malaya. What has Malaya to do with us?" This is what<br />
this spokesman for Labour said " What has Malaya to do with us?"<br />
And now the proposal has been advanced and is considerably<br />
advanced, to establish Malaysiaooo.. ( To interjector I know,<br />
you are interested in everything except thiso You said that<br />
earlier, But Australians are interested in this) ( Applause)<br />
The Prime Minister of Malaya sponsored a proposal<br />
under which tte Federation of Malaya and Singapore, where the<br />
great naval base is and the three Borneo provinces, Sarawak,<br />
Brunei and North Borneo should, with the agreement of their own<br />
people, come together in a Federation of Malaysia and we, as<br />
the Government warmly approve of this, as does the Government<br />
of the United Kingdom as does the Government of the United States,<br />
because this would establish a hard circle of countries highly<br />
friendly to us and we need countries that are highly friendly<br />
to us auite frankly, because all the pressure in our direction<br />
here is from Communist China, down through Laos down through<br />
North Vietnam and with constant threats on the Thailand border,<br />
We would need to be blind if we didn't realise that the threat to<br />
our future comes from that direction and from that source and so<br />
we say we are all for Malaysia.<br />
The Labour Party, after its recent Conference of the<br />
36, who gave their orders, said, ' Woll, yes we have nothing to<br />
say about in Malaysia in particular except that we are glad that<br />
they will no longer be colonies." Not a positive word about<br />
Malaysia, The Melbourne " Age", one of the greatest newspapers<br />
in the Southern Hemisphere, wrote a leading article on it of the<br />
most pungent description. It was a poor, equivocal, shuffling<br />
attitude towards a great problem,<br />
Then there is the next one, What is their policy<br />
about nuclear affairs? Well, I hope you won't mind if I take<br />
just five or ten minutes to deal with this because it is of<br />
the first importance, They are bgginning to talk as if they<br />
were the only people that wore against nuclear war, You know,<br />
ban-the-bomb and all this business. They act as if they<br />
were the only people against it. Presumably we are a lot of<br />
blood-thirsty fellows in Government who want to get on with a<br />
nuclear war. And they have the unparalleled impertinence in<br />
a0* 0e aee* ac/ </p>
<p>7<br />
the course of debate of' quoting what the Commonwealth Prime<br />
Ministers agreed on a couple of years ago i~ n London, forgetting<br />
that I was one of them, and indeed not knowing perhaps that<br />
the paragraph they most rely on was actually written by me and<br />
accepted unanimously by all the Prime Ministers present. Now<br />
we said two things on this disarmament problem. Wde said we<br />
were all for dlsarmament7 we were all for getting armaents<br />
down, step by step. we believed and, of course, we still<br />
believe that the eliminating of nuclear and conventional<br />
armaments ( non-nuclear armaments) must be so phased that at<br />
no stage will any country or group of countries obtain a<br />
significant military advantage. So I want you to follow what<br />
that means. At the present time, Jit you talk about orthodox<br />
weapons, conventional weapons, great armies, air forces not<br />
devoted to the use of nuclear weapons and so on the Soviet<br />
Union would outnumber the entire world put togelhero' If you<br />
could abolishi all the rniclear weapons in' -the world at thin<br />
moment and stick thorn in the uttermost parts of the sea, there<br />
would be nothing to prevent the Soviet Union from taking charge<br />
of Europe any fortnight it occurred to them, because she has<br />
overwhelming power in non-nucloar forces, It is the fact that<br />
the United States primarily and Great Britain to a certain<br />
extent have nuclear weapons which serves as a deterrent to them<br />
that prevents them from continuing their aggression in Western<br />
Europe, an aggression which has been halted. now for about<br />
eight or nine years. Now this is t emendously importat<br />
What we said as Prime Ministers was, " Well. look, it would be<br />
silly to wipe out or to reduce nuclear arms if you left the<br />
others untouched, Therefore they must all be dealt with.<br />
They must all be cut down -toget; her so that no country, or group<br />
of countries is put at the mercy of' another country Qr roup<br />
of countries. We all agreed on this. The Pr~ ime Ministers,<br />
with an imiheasurable variety of ideas on most things, were<br />
unanimous, And in the second place, we came to this paragraph<br />
that I referred to, as I have a particular interest in it,.<br />
and we said this, I am telling you this because I am tired of<br />
al! this nonsense about the Labour Party being the only people<br />
who are interested in this matter. We said this " Every<br />
effort should be made to secure rapid agreement -to the permanent<br />
banning of nuclear weapon te7. sts by all nattions and to arrangements<br />
for verifying the observance of the agreement. Such an agreement<br />
is urgent, otherwise further countries may soon become nuclear<br />
powers, wicih would increase the danger of war and further<br />
complicate the problem of disarmament."<br />
Not much to quarrel wita there, I venture to say.<br />
That is what we wanted. That is what we want. But ever<br />
since that time, every conference at Geneva designed to bring<br />
about a cessation of nuclear tests has dealt with positive<br />
proposals by Great Britain and the United States to cease them<br />
and complete obstruction by the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union<br />
gets out of it by saying, " Well, it's all right for you, but we<br />
are not going to have anybody inside our territories inspecting<br />
what we do and finding out whether we are making nuclear tet.<br />
The Communist power, the great Communist nuclear power the<br />
O3oviet Union is today solely responsible for the fact ? hat<br />
neclear tests are allowed to go on,<br />
Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, I venture to say<br />
that the Labour Party starts on this problem a little bit<br />
a000 so 00a8 / 8 </p>
<p>8-<br />
off-balance, but having claimed in this rather arrogant fashion<br />
that they are the great spcnsors of getting rid of nuclear war,<br />
then, egged on let's speak quite frankly egged on by the<br />
Communist Party which began this scheme, they have now said,<br />
" We are for making the world South ofl the Equator a nuclearfree<br />
area, not allowing any nuclear weapon to come into it or<br />
be discharged from it or be stock-piled in it or to be made<br />
in it." This is the policy that you will be voting for in the<br />
next election in Australia if you vote -Tor Labour,<br />
Now, I just want to remind you, ladies and gentlemen,<br />
what that means. ', Je are not a nuclear power. We have stood<br />
clear of this kind of thing. We are not ambitious to be building<br />
nuclear weapons. UIe think the fewer hands that they are in<br />
the more chance of avoiding disaster in the world. But, under<br />
the South East Asia Treaty and more particularly under the ANZIJS<br />
Pact which my Government sponsored Australia, New Zealand<br />
the inhited States under that pact, America is our ally, ana<br />
America is a nuclear power and if a igreat war arose, you don't<br />
suppose that we would be left out of it. Would we be just<br />
the unwilling prize of victory to whoever won? It is worth<br />
thinking about. But if a great world war broke out which<br />
Heaven forbid would the United States a..( Interjector-<br />
" You'd resign tomorrow) You couldn't be more wrong. I<br />
resigned in August, .1941. It is about as accurate as most of the<br />
things you have been saying,<br />
However, ladies and gentlecmen,, I want to pursue this<br />
serious topic,. Suppose there were a great war, and suppose<br />
China by this time has developed nuclear weapons as undoubtedly<br />
she will before long, and the United StEates of America is our<br />
ally, and the United States decides to use nuclear weapons<br />
herself in answer to a nuclear attack. Now this is something<br />
that is no use shutting ou-r eyes to and pretending there is no<br />
such danger,, We have to open our minds and our eyes and look<br />
at it quite plainly, Would we say would you like the<br />
Australian Government rather to say to the United States, " You<br />
are not to have in the Southern Hemisphere, south of the<br />
equator, any submarinas with nuclear weapons on them, you are<br />
not to fly around south of the equator any aircraft with nuclear<br />
weapons on them because thiat's against our beliefs. Suppose the<br />
United States said, " We don't care what you say, we are going<br />
to do it." This is a great contribution to our alliance<br />
isnst it? But suppose, on the other hand, they said, " Well,,<br />
we'll do what you want us to do. We will leave Australia out<br />
of all this business. We will put our fellows in and take the<br />
rap." How would they get into the Indian Ocean, which<br />
strategically is essential -to an attack on the Soviet Union or<br />
on Communist China? Do you know how they would have to get<br />
into the Indian Ocean? Through the Suez Canal. You realise how<br />
long that would be oren, or through the Straits of Malacca,<br />
next door to Indonesi. a,, ( Continuous interjections) It's all<br />
right, ladies and gentlemen, I sympathise with you, but it is<br />
a well-known statistical fac~ t that in a population of say, 800,<br />
you are bound to have a couple of nuts,, ( Laughter, applause)<br />
The third item of Labour policy which I want to<br />
mention to you quite briefly concerns itself with the proposed<br />
installation of a radio signalling station by the United States<br />
in the North-West of Australia, North-West Cape<br />
( To constant interjector You ydon't think you've done me any<br />
harm, do you? On the contrary, youlve been worth 100 votes<br />
tonight to Vern Dyason) ( Applause) 000.0./ 9 </p>

I come to the final aspect of this matter, the radio<br />
communications station in the North-West of Western Australia,<br />
Here is something which, as everybody now knows, I hope and<br />
itfs been made clear from the beginning is a radio signalling<br />
station, under which the United States authorities can convey<br />
messages to their naval vessels within the range of the station,<br />
that is to say, in the Indian Ocean and the South West Pacific.<br />
Very important that they should have this as in other parts of<br />
the world, This is rather a blank spot. And they asked us<br />
whether we would agree ou~ o allies and of course we said we<br />
would, It wasn't without interest that it is going to be very<br />
expensive and they are going to pay for it. It is a pure means<br />
of conveying messages to their naval vessels and has nothing to<br />
do with controlling thei~ r fire or these fanciful things that<br />
people have been talking about, This is a perfectly commonplace,<br />
straightforward idea.<br />
What did the Labour Party do about it? ( Interjector<br />
" What about the 36?" 1) Thank you very much. Yes, I wanted that<br />
question. Yes, I'll tell you. The 36 outside bosses of the<br />
Labour Party because the Labour Party doesn~ t believe in<br />
control by Parliament but by control by 36 outside bosses who<br />
lay down the law the 36 outside men or women they decided<br />
ultimately that they would approve of this proviled that the<br />
United States was not to use it in the event of war without<br />
the approval of the then Australian Government. ( Interjector<br />
" That's fair enough") Well, you say so, but I' 11 make two<br />
comments on it,<br />
First of all, that was carried by 19 to 17; 17 out<br />
of the 36, apparently, didn~ t want them there at all and but<br />
for one man switching his vote, it would have been Aall or<br />
19.. 17 the other Now, how do you like that? Don't forget<br />
that the 36 are not dead; they meet from time to time and they<br />
lay down the lauy from time ' to tim-and every man in the Federal<br />
Parliament on the Labour side is bound by it. Just within a<br />
whisker of saying to thie United States of America, " You keep<br />
off."' They must be feeling strong. They must be feeling that<br />
Australia is a tremendously powerful country in spite of the<br />
wrctched Menzies Government. They are prepared to say, 2We<br />
are able to go alone, Wle don't wrant you the United States,.<br />
coming along and building a n~ e-ion,." Imore fantastic point<br />
of view I have never heard of and yet it went within a touch<br />
of being carried, and the 19 said, " Yes well, no doubt there is<br />
a lot in what you say, but it will be all right if, in the event<br />
of a war, the Americans can be ordered out by us."<br />
Now, ladies and gentlemen, do you like to imagine a<br />
war in this part of the wrorld in which we are engaged, in which<br />
the United States is not alongsIde us? Do you like to think of<br />
it and if you were an American, woldv you expect that if you<br />
hal an alliance with Australia, Australia would be along if<br />
you were engaged in a war? The United States of America cantt<br />
be engaged in a war in which it requires these facilities for<br />
its naval forces unless that's a great war and a great war<br />
against whom? Against the Cormmunist powers. There is no other<br />
enemy, And to think that any nation would be prepared to invest<br />
its money and its time and its skill in putting up a signalling<br />
station on the North-West coast of Aus-tralia only to be told<br />
that at the very moment it needed it, it couldn't use it, This<br />
to me is sheer lunacy. Lunacy. And if that point of view<br />
prevailed, I wouldn't give tuppence for the durability of our<br />
arrangements with the United States of America and, quite frankly,<br />
B &amp; 0606/ 1 0 </p>
<p>if I couldn't give tuppence for the durability vr thzoce<br />
arrangements, I would-n't be -able to offer much for our<br />
chances of surviLval0<br />
And yet, this unreal view, this fantastic view is<br />
the one that went within well was carried by 19-17 and<br />
but for a little accident en route, it would have gone still<br />
further and the Americans would have been ordered out if<br />
I may be completely Irish before they arrived. ( Laughter)<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, these are great problems<br />
and they are problems here in a by-election, they are problems<br />
in the next Australian election and, apart from being a matter<br />
of political debate or argument, they are great problems for<br />
our country, because this is our country and we have the<br />
liveliest sense of obligation to preserve it security and<br />
to preserve the standards and future of the people who live<br />
in it, Now I really thiink, if I may say so, that this<br />
by-olection where there is an a-xnirable candidate as you all<br />
know, gives you a splendid opportunity of firing a shot across<br />
the bows of the Labour Opposition at Canberra,<br />
