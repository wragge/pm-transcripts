Today Nick Sherry has announced he will retire from Parliament, after almost 22 years as a Senator for Tasmania.</p>
<p>Nick has made a tremendous contribution to the Labor team.</p>
<p>He served as a Parliamentary Secretary in the Keating Government and subsequently spent many years working tirelessly on the Opposition frontbench. He then served as a Minister from 2007 until his retirement from the Ministry in December last year.</p>
<p>During his time in the Ministry, Nick worked hard to protect jobs and to strengthen Australia's small business sector. He was also a strong advocate for the growth of the Australian tourism sector and his name will always be synonymous with Labor's superannuation reforms.</p>
<p>Nick has made considerable achievements in his areas of portfolio responsibility, and in the ALP caucus and the Senate more broadly.</p>
<p>He has also served his constituents, the people of Tasmania, loyally and thoroughly for two decades.</p>
<p>I thank Nick for his remarkable service to the ALP and I wish him and his family well in the future.</p>
<p>Nick overcame some personal tough times and is much admired for his determination.</p>
<p>I'm sure he's looking forward to spending more time with his three young children in his post-Parliament days, and that they will be equally thrilled to have him home.</p>
<p>Nick will spend his final day in the Senate on June 1. </p>
