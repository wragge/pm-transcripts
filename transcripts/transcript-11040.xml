<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, is that it for the GST?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, no. I am as committed to tax reform and lower personal tax for</p>
<p> the Australian community as ever before. We fought and won an election</p>
<p> having disclosed in full what we intended to do. We are willing to</p>
<p> make even fairer a very fair tax package. We will move those amendments</p>
<p> in the Senate and we will continue to persevere and press to implement</p>
<p> the mandate given to us by the Australian people last October.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Will you try once again with Mr Harradine?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>There's no point. I had a long talk to him this afternoon. Unless</p>
<p> of course he indicates a change of mind but I don't think he</p>
<p> will. You should talk to him about that. He told me that he couldn't</p>
<p> support the package. He acknowledged that the compensation changes</p>
<p> were generous, were significant. The case for example for getting</p>
<p> rid of food is less now than it was 24 hours ago because the compensation</p>
<p> is even more generous.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Would you like to reveal the extent of that package and compensation?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes. The compensation is in the order of 1 to $1.5 billion on an annual</p>
<p> basis. It includes an increase of 4% to 5% in the compensation for</p>
<p> pensioners. It includes an increase from 25% to 26% in the factor</p>
<p> so far as the pension is concerned, the guarantee. So that eliminates</p>
<p> totally any suggestion that the compensation could be eroded. It locks</p>
<p> the compensation in for all time, for all time it locks it in. It</p>
<p> includes increases in benefits for large families, it includes an</p>
<p> increase in the self-funded retirees' benefit and making that</p>
<p> available for self-funded retirees at the age of 55. I also indicated</p>
<p> to Senator Harradine that we would deliver in full on the requests</p>
<p> that he made in relation to the youth allowance.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>He says that you can't lock in and give that guarantee. You obviously</p>
<p> didn't manage to convince him.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well nothing can be guaranteed in life Spencer. He can't guarantee</p>
<p> that a future Labor government won't increase wholesale sales</p>
<p> tax.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Well you say that you won't give up. Are you prepared to deal</p>
<p> with the Democrats and back down on food?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No. We're not prepared to back down on food. The case for changing</p>
<p> food is less now than it was 24 hours ago because we have significantly</p>
<p> increased the compensation.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Is that enough then to appeal to the Democrats?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well you should go and talk to the Democrats.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>But you would hope?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well look, you go and talk to the Democrats. I mean I am more interested</p>
<p> in keeping faith with the Australian people then I am with keeping</p>
<p> faith with other parties. We disclosed every last detail of this.</p>
<p> We were honest, up front and candid. What more do you have to do to</p>
<p> implement a programme that the Australian public voted for. I didn't</p>
<p> keep it in my back pocket, I didn't mislead them. I was up front,</p>
<p> I was honest, I was forthright and I was candid. And I won the election</p>
<p> and I now want the right to implement the programme I took to the</p>
<p> Australian people which has been made even more fairer and more generous.</p>
<p> Now that is the choice that the Parliament faces.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>And you'll go through to the bottom line then?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We will continue to push the package. I have no intention of backing</p>
<p> away because tax reform is needed for Australia. Not for John Howard,</p>
<p> for Australia. And that is the course that I'm resolved to continue</p>
<p> down.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Lastly Mr Howard, Senator Harradine said that he had apologised to</p>
<p> you by phone. He expected his name would be mud now. Did you accept</p>
<p> his apology and his he in fact mud?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well Senator Harradine is accountable not to me but to the Australian</p>
<p> people. I don't intend to denigrate Senator Harradine personally.</p>
<p> I never have and I never will. Every promise I've ever made to</p>
<p> Senator Harradine I've honoured in full, in full. And I'll</p>
<p> continue to do that into the future. But Senator Harradine's</p>
<p> argument is with the Australian people, it is not with me.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>You're an angry man tonight?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I believe that the Australian people are entitled to better than</p>
<p> this from their political system. I believe the Australian people</p>
<p> are entitled if they vote for a government that's fully disclosed</p>
<p> its promises that that government should be kept to those promises</p>
<p> and should implement them. And plainly that is in danger of not happening</p>
<p> and I think the Australian people have a right to be angry about that,</p>
<p> not me.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister thank you for your time.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
