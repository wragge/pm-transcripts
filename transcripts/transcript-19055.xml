    <content><![CDATA[<p>Canberra</p>
<p>Today, North Korea's official news agency claimed North Korea had conducted a successful nuclear test. </p>
<p>Seismic data supports this claim and a third North Korean nuclear test is consistent with North Korea's dangerous nuclear ambitions.</p>
<p>The Australian Government condemns in the strongest possible terms nuclear testing by North Korea.</p>
<p>Nuclear testing by North Korea clearly violates United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1718 (2006), 1874 (2009) and 2087 (2013) which demand North Korea not conduct any further nuclear tests. </p>
<p>North Korea's development of nuclear weapons and missiles and its proliferation of sensitive technologies threaten international peace and security. </p>
<p>North Korea's actions challenge the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.</p>
<p>Only last month, in unanimously adopting Resolution 2087, the Security Council expressed its determination to take significant action in the event of a further North Korean nuclear test.</p>
<p>Australia has called for an urgent meeting of the Security Council.  As a Security Council member, Australia will work for the strongest possible response to North Korea's continuing defiance of the will of international community.</p>
<p>Australia will also be making its deep concerns known to the North Korean Government directly, as well as in international and regional forums.</p>
<p>North Korea's future security and prosperity can only be secured through constructive relations with its neighbours and the international community.</p>
<p>Australia will continue to work closely with our friends and allies for peace and stability in North Asia.</p>
