PRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT27SPEBR19<br />
ADDRESS TO LIBERAL PARTY DINNER, CANBERRA<br />
Margaret Reid, John Atwill, Bob Ellicott, John Knight,<br />
John Haslem, Jim Leedman and his team, ladies and gentlemen.<br />
It is good to be here tonight, and good to see so many<br />
people coming to this annual ACT Liberal Party function.<br />
I have been asked to speak about Canberra, and I wanted<br />
to try and say something about the future how I believe<br />
Canberra is going to develop as a greater and greater national<br />
capital capturing the pride of all Australians.<br />
But first I would like to trace some of the beginnings of this<br />
city and try and link together how the history of Canberra is<br />
very much bound together with the history of the Liberal Party.<br />
Because it was thirty years ago in 1949 with Sir Robert Menzies<br />
and the decisions that were made after that great election victory<br />
that really led to the development of Canberra as a great city<br />
and as a great capital.<br />
Canberra has come a long way since its beginnings. In 1912<br />
there were two tiny villages Hall and Tharwa nine large<br />
pastoral stations, a few buildings scattered near the Molonglo<br />
Crossing. In 1925 it was still fairly rural when A. P. Herbet<br />
visited Parliament House during the construction period and<br />
he wrote, " Our guide pointed to a concrete mixer and said,<br />
' that's the Senate'. He then took us to a crowd of men hard at<br />
work in a cloud of dust. ' That's the Lower House', he said.<br />
Finally, they too, us out to a grand terrace... . our friend<br />
pointed to an empty field and said, ' That's the National<br />
Library'. ' Remarkable', we said, and so it was, for at<br />
that moment there was passing through the National Library<br />
a real Australian cow".<br />
I remember seeing dairy cows on Molonglo Flats when I first<br />
came to Canberra, about 24,. 25 years ago. Just after the<br />
Second World War, the only buildings of significance were<br />
the temporary Parliament House, and Bob Ellicott is doing<br />
something about that, the Australian War Memrorial, the Hotel<br />
Canberra where too many stories were probably told too late<br />
at night, the Hotel Kurrajong, the old Patent's office and<br />
East and West Block where the power of the Public Service<br />
used to reside.<br />
Before the creation of Lake Burley Griffin in the early sixties,<br />
Canberra was in a sense, two cities, seperated by a flood plain,<br />
or a dairy farm or a golf course, depending upon the weather<br />
or your own inclination. The flood plain was even used by<br />
Lord Casey as an airport I-am told at times. I do not know<br />
what the air traffic controllers were doing then.<br />
Despite continuous opposition from people in the States, and<br />
by people who really did not know what the Liberal Party was<br />
about in seeking to build a great capital, despite the claims<br />
of waste and all the rest, over 30 years there have been dramatic<br />
changes in this city from a little over 20,000 people in 1949 to<br />
230,000 today. 27 SEPTEMBER 1979 </p>
<p>-2<br />
Now, with maturity, Canberra gains dignity and becomes yearly<br />
more impressive as a significant city. The society of Canberra,<br />
the community of Canberra is more sophisticated, more<br />
cosmopolitan. People from many different lands are represented<br />
as is made quite plain by the very fact that we are meeting<br />
tonight in the Hellenic Club. On a more mundane and material<br />
level, Canberra has the highest weekly earnings of any State<br />
or Territory in Australia<br />
In the intervening years, Canberra has seen major construction<br />
including the National Library, the Treasury, the Belconnen<br />
Offices, the Academy of Science, the Mint,' the Russell Defence<br />
complex, the Woden Valley development, the building of<br />
hospitals, the National University itself which is a<br />
creation since the Second World War, the Black Mountain<br />
Tower. And I suppose many of these are musts for the 2 million<br />
visitors that come to Canberra each year.<br />
During this time, fifty suburbs were developed, containing<br />
more than 50,000 homes, compared again with 30 years ago<br />
with about 3,500 homes. Now these developments have not just<br />
happened. They occured because people had a conception of<br />
what Canberra should be about. They occured because people<br />
had an idea of what the seat of Government should be about.<br />
They occured because people believed that the main policy<br />
departments, the great departments of State my own, Treasury,<br />
Foreign Affairs, Trade should have their policy divisions in<br />
Canberra-giving-substance-to the seat of Government, and at<br />
the same time, giving substance to the Australian capital.<br />
So initiative was required, both by Government and by the private<br />
sector which must continue to work in partnership and now I<br />
believe, more than ever before. often there was a need to<br />
overcome prejudice. I can well remember from an excursion into<br />
western Queensland and Sir Robert was attacked for building<br />
a lake in Canberra. He said, " Well, people have been telling<br />
me to go and jump into the lake all my life. So I thought<br />
it was time I had one".<br />
Successive Liberal Governments have developed this city, this<br />
capital, and in particular I think we need to note the<br />
contribution of Sir Robert Menzies. So many buildinggs, so much<br />
of this city bore his print, his idea, his conception, of what<br />
a great capital should be. The National Library standing on<br />
the foreshore of Lake Burley Griffin is just one lasting tribute<br />
to his wisdom and foresight in helping to build this city.<br />
And of course, Lake Burley Griffin itself.<br />
Sir Robert was ably assisted by Sir John Overall of the National<br />
Capital Development Commission and the continuing work of that<br />
Commission which goes on to this day.<br />
Since 1950, the population of this city has grown, as you all<br />
well know, by nearly 8% a year. There was, of course, no way<br />
in which this rate of growth can be continued indefinitely<br />
into the future. It is now around still above the national<br />
average and hopefully at a sustainable level, but obviously<br />
there have been very real problems in the transition from<br />
that rapid rate of growth to the current growth of 2%. / 13 </p>
<p>-3<br />
What slower growth has meant adjustments. I think that at some<br />
, time the change was going to be inevitable but unfortunately<br />
there have been difficulties. Bob Ellicott and your own Members<br />
are well aware of that and I am aware of it.<br />
The Public Service transfer programme had to slow down once most<br />
of the great departments of State had come to this city.<br />
Despite what some people might think, there is not an<br />
inexhaustable supply of Public Servants to go on coming to<br />
this city from Melbourne and Sydney and other places.<br />
It is important to make sure that the Public Service maintains<br />
its links in the commercial centers in the States just as<br />
it is important that the great policy elemenits of major departments<br />
should be housed and placed in the capital itself.<br />
We have got to remember that Government spending had to be<br />
brought under control. It had to be reduced to a level which<br />
you and everyone else as tax payers.,: were prepared to sustain<br />
on a long term and sensible basis. The hot house of Labor<br />
years had to be put behind and responsibi. lity had to be<br />
re-established. So we are well aware that there have been,<br />
that there ara difficulties, and these I hope we can work<br />
together to overcome.<br />
But much of the solution not all of it much of the solution<br />
to Canberra's problems is fundamentally the same as the solution<br />
for the'rest of Australia itself. Sensible economic management<br />
that enables Governments and people and industries to plan<br />
for the future. That is just as important to Canberra as it<br />
is to the rest of Australia.<br />
To have inflation down and competitiveness up, to have overseas<br />
investment increased, and thus increase employment, to increase<br />
economic activity and to establish a growing confidence in<br />
Australia as indeed there how is, here and overseas. The<br />
Government is very firmly committed to its Liberal philosophy.<br />
and that partnership which is so essential between Government<br />
and private enterprise and private initiative. It is the role<br />
of Government to create the conditions for development and<br />
growth. I think-Bob Ellicott has probably given more-attention<br />
than any other Minister for the national capital to ways in<br />
which private sector involvement and interest and investment<br />
in Canberra and the Australian Capital Territory can be encouraged<br />
and enduced to come here.<br />
Ithink much of the future in Canberra will lie in the success<br />
of those particular efforts. Now we are looking to the future<br />
of this city as we look to the future of the rest of Australia.<br />
We look to the future so that Canberra can grow, steadily,<br />
firmly and confidently into the 1980s having a pretty fair<br />
idea of what lies ahead. But we can do this in a number of ways:<br />
further developing this city as a symbol of Australia's national<br />
identity, our strength of purpose and our pride as a nation;<br />
consolidating the development of the departments of State<br />
in Canberra; and encouraging the development of the private<br />
sector as we never have before.<br />
The Government has taken a number of decisions which will set<br />
the broad guidelines for some major developments in the coming<br />
years. Decisions to construct a new and permanent Parliament House </p>
<p>-4<br />
on Capital Hill. The decision in principle to construct new<br />
Commonwealth Law Courts which include the Federal Court, the<br />
Supreme Court of the Capital Territory, the Conciliation and<br />
Arbitration Commission and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.<br />
A National archives headquarters, a new institute of criminology,<br />
and the Government inspite of a Public Works COmmittee, has not<br />
forgotten the Casey University proposal.<br />
I can remember about 11 years ago in a Cabinet meeting when<br />
that particular proposal was first put to Cabinet. I think the<br />
argument took three hours and I got beaten, but I have never*<br />
ceased to believe that the concept of Casey University makes<br />
sense for Australia's armed services and for the development<br />
of the defence forces. I venture to say that that is a military<br />
view at the most senior level, just as much as it is a civilian<br />
view. In addition to that, the High Court of course is going to be<br />
open very shortly. The National Gallery buildings are also<br />
nearing completion in year or two. In May of 1980, Her Majesty<br />
the Queen will open the High Court building, a magnificent<br />
building which will add to the dignity of this capital.<br />
The National Gallery opening will be in 1982, and that<br />
will be an exciting event. It will enable Australians to see<br />
perhaps for the first time, the excellence of the national<br />
collection that was begun by Sir Robert Menzies under arrangements<br />
made about 30 years ago, and which has continued steadily ever<br />
since.<br />
The Director of the Gallery, James Mollison, has and is making<br />
an enormous contribution to the development of that collection<br />
and it must indeed be exciting for him as it is for Australia,<br />
to look forward to the opening of Australia's own National Gallery.<br />
As further evidence of the Government's commitment of the<br />
Liberal Party's commitment to the development of Canberra<br />
as a national capital, as a center point of Austral~ ian pride<br />
and achievement. I am pleased to announce that the Government<br />
has decided to introduce legislation establishing a National<br />
Museum of History in Canberra. It will be the Museum of Australia.<br />
An interim council will be appointed. It will bring forward plans<br />
for the development of the museum for'the first stage-of buildingsp<br />
three inter-related themes, natural environment, Aboriginal<br />
history, European civilization and Australia. This is important<br />
to Australians. It will be important to overseas visitors. It<br />
will take some time to develop clearly but we need to understand that<br />
the planning and development for the National Gallery began<br />
a long while ago, and it is past time when we began the planning<br />
for the museum of Australia.<br />
The transfer programme is important to the continued development<br />
of this city but at some point, the large significant transfers<br />
of the past come to the end. In this sense, I suppose Australia<br />
runs out of Public Servants, at some point, but there are still<br />
some public transfers and they will continue while there is a<br />
need for more people to come here particularly from policy areas<br />
of significant policy departments.<br />
While units exercising national responsibilities may come here<br />
and need to, we need also to remember that departments must<br />
retain in regional areas in the States and in the capital cities<br />
of the States so that policies can be implimented, and to make sure </p>
<p>that the central offices are kept informed of local issues<br />
and local needs.<br />
But, we also need to understandtha those transfers to Canberra<br />
improve efficiency of administration, the standard and<br />
responsiveness of advice, of access and of communication at<br />
the highest policy levels. Over the next five years or so,<br />
transfers will take place in the order of 1,800 jobs<br />
involving the departments of Transport, which will most significantly<br />
be involved, Employment and Youth Affairs, Postal and<br />
Telecommunications, Productivity, Industrial Relations and<br />
Defence. Details viill be finalised after consultation between the Public<br />
Service Board, the departments concerned and-the consultation<br />
that we are commited to undertake with the peak councils.<br />
The actual timing of the transfers will need to be considered<br />
in the light of present and future accommodation requirements<br />
in Canberra itsel~ f.<br />
I would -like something' more about private enterprise in<br />
this city. Tourism Canberra acts as a powerful magnet<br />
for tourists as we all know~ attracting over 2 million visitors<br />
each year. The Government hopes that this can be increased<br />
very significantly. A tourist office is being established<br />
in Sydney and that office will attract more overseas tourists,<br />
assisted we would hope, by lower international airfares.<br />
But the'location of Canberra, a gateway to the Snowy Mountainsits<br />
relative proximity to Sydney and to Melbourne, its accessibility<br />
by air and by road all act to enhance the tourist potential of<br />
Canberra and the possibilities for further growth.<br />
Indeed, the more this city is developed as a great national<br />
capital, the more it attracts Australians to come and visit<br />
and see their own national capital. I think one of the interestin,<br />
things is that sometimes people come here as sceptics, but<br />
if they do, they generally leave with a sense of great<br />
national pride in their capital.<br />
Private enterprise is important and there are examples of<br />
our Liberal approach . working in co-operation with--the<br />
private enterprise sector now becoming more clear within<br />
this city. The old Canberra brick works are being developed<br />
asa tourist attraction, costing $ 1 million or more.-<br />
The. Northbourne Avenue Motel Devblopment, again at considerable<br />
cost. The flood lighting at Bruce Stadium is going to be upgraded<br />
so that colour television can be translated. I am sorry the Soccer<br />
club, Canberra City, are not here to know that. It seemed a little<br />
wasteful to have lighting which was only good for black and white,<br />
and so the lighting is being upgraded.<br />
Then there are other examples of tourist attractions. The<br />
Cockington Green Minature Village, the Canberry Fair project,<br />
a major tourist centre on the old.-Jolimont site is subject to<br />
a feasibility study. These are the kinds of things that people<br />
can be involved in, helping to forge this city through into<br />
the 1980s and beyond. We sought submissions for the development<br />
of a convention centre and a hotel,. possibly including a casino<br />
in the business centre of Canberra. / 6 </p>
<p>-6<br />
The House of Assembly has recommended that a licence be<br />
granted for a casino the'Government has yet to make a<br />
decision on that but I do not believe that there is great,<br />
in principle, opposition to the concept.<br />
The Commonwealth Heads. of Government Meeting will be held in<br />
Australia in two years time. This is a meeting of 40 Heads<br />
of Government. It is a unique meeting because I do not know<br />
any other assembly where a significant number of Heads of<br />
Government are prepared to give up to eight or ten days<br />
of their time to get to meet together, to talk to each other,<br />
to understand each other's problems and hopefully to make<br />
some contribution to the resolution of difficult issues.<br />
The last conference at Lusaka certainly opened the door<br />
to the settlement of one of the most difficult international<br />
problems of the last 15 to 20 years in Rhodesia, and the advice<br />
we have from London is that the Constitutional Conference<br />
has been moving forward steadily and making better progress<br />
than might have been expected at the outset.<br />
The next meeting will be in Australia and it is a great honour<br />
to Australia I believe that the conference will be held here.<br />
There is no final decision yet about the actual<br />
location of the conference but we are determined to make<br />
sure that Canberra participates at least in some part of<br />
the conference if the particular needs of the conference<br />
in terms of accommodation make it impossible to have the<br />
major part of the conference in this city.<br />
So, the Commonwealth Heads of Government will be coming<br />
to Canberra, part of the conference at least will be held<br />
this city but, we have not made final decisions about the<br />
actual location of the major part of the conference.<br />
The natural gas pipeline will be coming to Canberra. It has<br />
been approved in principal. It will be a spur line from the<br />
Moomba-Sydney pipeline. It will provide alternative fuel source<br />
which will I suppose be all the more welcome as oil prices rise.<br />
Itwill supply Canberra and Queanbeyan and again will be a useful<br />
development for this city.<br />
Bob Ellicott has established the Canberra Development Board.<br />
This city has reached the stage where attractions, the attributes<br />
of this city, need to be marketed in the wider Auttralian scene.<br />
Ithink the Quest of Quests was one example of that bringing<br />
much of Canberra to the notice of a very large audience right<br />
around Australia.<br />
But the Government cannot do these things alone. The Canberra<br />
Development Board under the Chairmanship of Laurie Muir,<br />
the senior partner of one of Australia's leading stockbroking<br />
firms will promote and encourage further investment in Canberra<br />
by the private sector. It is a great challenge in front of the<br />
Board but we have high hopes for its success in the years ahead.<br />
The Board will build on the infrastructure the Government has<br />
and is creating in Canberra and encouraged private sector<br />
investment in the maturing stages of Canberra's growth as<br />
a city.<br />
THe programmes I have announced tonight, the major works underway,<br />
the major works planned, the major decisions made, the continuation<br />
of the transfer programme, the creation of the Canberra . Developmnent Board </p>
<p>-7<br />
and the resources that have been developed over many years,<br />
largely by Liberal Governments in this city, have all demonstrated<br />
the firm and lasting committment of the Commonwealth Government<br />
to a prosperous and viable national capital.<br />
There is one last thing I would like to say about the national<br />
capital. It might perhaps be more relevant to people who live<br />
outside Canberra in the States than to people who live in<br />
it. There is some kind of a message in it for all Australians<br />
because I believe we have earnedgand justifiably earned but I<br />
wish we had not, the name of being a nation of knockers.<br />
How often do we hear Australians saying, " We can't do it<br />
so well, Australian workmanship isn't so good, Australian<br />
motorcars aren't as good as some that are imported", and<br />
how often do we hear people who live outside Canberra saying<br />
something derogatory of this city and of this capital, as though<br />
it were a waste as though it were something unnecessary in<br />
the Australian Commonwealth. Well, I think that we should have<br />
out growniat kind of attitude long ago and I hope that people<br />
who live in Canberra, people who come and visit this city as<br />
the time passes, will all go away as advocates of Canberra.<br />
Because, if Canberra did not exist, if it had not been established<br />
here many years ago, I suspect there would be a need today to<br />
establish this capital as a mark of identity, as a symbol of<br />
Australia' s national pride, of what Australia is all about,<br />
what Australia stands for, what the Government and people in<br />
partnership intend to do. I believe much has been achieved in<br />
Canberra of which we all should have a reason to be very<br />
justly proud. I would like to think that all Australians could<br />
share in that and increasingly, a number do. But still we<br />
sometimes find, you know Canberra is unnessary, what is<br />
Government support of it all about. People I. suppose think, is<br />
it popular sometimes to knock this city? Well, if it is, they<br />
ought to understand that if they knock this city they are<br />
knocking themselves and they are knocking this nation.<br />
I believe it is time that we put that past us. It is time<br />
that we began to understand what Australia is all about.<br />
and that Canberra is part of it a great city, surely largely<br />
an administrative city but an important an important<br />
part of this nation, the best nation in the world. </p>
