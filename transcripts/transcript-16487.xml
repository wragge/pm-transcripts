    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Government will appoint Local Employment Co-ordinators to marshal training, infrastructure and Jobs Fund investments to maximise job opportunities in seven local communities hit hardest by the effects of the global recession.</p>
<p>The Government is providing $20.8 million for the Local Employment Co-ordinators to work in regions and communities affected by higher unemployment and job losses.</p>
<p>Trucking magnate, Mr Lindsay Fox, has agreed to support the work of Local Employment Co-ordinators by advising employers in communities affected by the economic downturn how to keep their workers. He will be assisted in this task by Mr Bill Kelty.</p>
<p>While the effects of the global recession are being felt across the nation, some regions are experiencing higher unemployment and job losses.</p>
<p>The Government is determined to take all action possible to help those who lose their jobs through no fault of their own during this global recession.</p>
<p>Local Employment Co-ordinators will work with employers and not-for-profit organisations to identify new job opportunities and will help match the employment and training needs of local communities with available Commonwealth services and funding.</p>
<p>They will work in seven initial areas:</p>
<p>     * Canterbury Bankstown and South Western Sydney</p>
<p>     * The Illawarra, south of Sydney</p>
<p>     * Ipswich  -  Logan in Queensland</p>
<p>     * Northern and Western Adelaide</p>
<p>     * South Eastern Melbourne</p>
<p>     * South West Perth</p>
<p>     * Northern Tasmania</p>
<p>These regions were identified using a range of labour market and social indicators with further regions to be identified.</p>
<p>Local Employment Co-ordinators will also work with identified communities to access funds under the $650 million Jobs Fund and to develop projects that will create employment, training opportunities and deliver new infrastructure and services.</p>
<p>Mr Fox has agreed to work in partnership with these coordinators, acting as a Local Jobs Champion, advising employers how to find alternatives to laying off workers. </p>
<p>Mr Fox will also promote Government support and assistance available to individuals, employers and communities.</p>
<p>These initiatives form part of the Government's Jobs and Training Compact which aims to support retrenched workers, young people and local communities to get back to work or learn the skills required for future jobs.</p>
