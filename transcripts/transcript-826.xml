Extract from Hiansard<br />
COMMflON TE. A TH GOVERNME~ NT OFFER TO ASSIST IN<br />
FINANCIUNG OF 100OLi PROMO0TION<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon.<br />
Sir Robert Mvenzies, in the Ho,, se of Representatives<br />
on 10th October, 1963<br />
The Government has decided to assist the wool,<br />
growing industry to finance an expanded wool promotion<br />
campaign. The decision to do this has been taken after<br />
consideration of a request put to the Government by the<br />
Executive Committee of the Australian Wool Industry Conferen~ e,<br />
The Government is willing to match : Ci for ! Zl any additional<br />
funds which wool-growers are prepared to contribute by way<br />
of levy for wool promotion.<br />
Mr. Curtin ( Labour Another band-out,<br />
SIR ROBERT MENZIES This is a serious topic. I wish I could<br />
be allowed to make this statement with-out interruption. This<br />
is a matter of great interest to all wool people, if not so<br />
much to woolly ones. I repeat: The Government is willing to<br />
match Vi for Vi any additional funds which wool-growers are<br />
prepared to contribute by way of levy for wool promotion.<br />
Honourable members will appreciate that this means that if<br />
wool-growers agree to increase their levy for promotion, which<br />
is at present 10/-a brale, the Commonwealth will contribute<br />
an amount equal to the additional funds provided by wool-,<br />
growers as a result of an increase in the levy.<br />
The Government's offer -to match additional funds<br />
contributed by wool-growers for wool promotion will apply for<br />
a period of three years. At the end of that period the.<br />
Government will review its assistance in the light of the<br />
circumstances at that time. The Australian Wool Board will<br />
be asked to report to the Government annually on the operation<br />
of the wool promotion programme.<br />
Although the Executive Committee of the Wool<br />
Industry Conference has also suggested that the Cormmonwealth<br />
should assist in providing additional funds for wool research,<br />
the Government has decided to defer consideration of this<br />
particular request for the time being. In making that<br />
decision, we took account of the fact that substantial reserve<br />
funds are at pru. sent avail. ble for financing wool research.<br />
At the same time, however, we have noted that these reserves<br />
are being depleted and we will review the position after the<br />
Australian Wol Board has taken over the administration of<br />
wool research and has had an opportunity of examining future<br />
financial roquirements. The Commonwealth is at present<br />
contributing the equivalent of a bale for wool research<br />
while wool-gro-wers themselves contribute at the rate of 2/-<br />
a bale. The Commonwealth will, of course, continue to<br />
contribute on this basis.<br />
Mr. Speoker, this has been a major decision by<br />
the Government and it has been taken in the light of the<br />
special circumstances applying to the weol industry and<br />
having regard to its competitive position with other fibres<br />
and its significance to the Australian economy. </p>
