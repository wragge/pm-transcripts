    <content><![CDATA[<p>ADDRESS BY THE PRIME MINISTER, T'HE HON P. 3. KEATING, MP TO<br />THE SIXTH NATIONAL SMALL BUSINESS FORUM SYDNEY, 19<br />OCTOBER 1992<br />Mr Edwards, my coleague, the Flon David Beddall, ladies arnd gentlemen.<br />Thank you for inviting me to talk to you today.<br />I want to talk to you about what the Government is now doing, and what it intends to<br />do to make sure that small business continues to play its part in the expansion of the<br />Australian economy which is now underway.<br />But before I do that I want to spend a little time describing to you the quite<br />extraordinary sea change which the Australian economy has undergone In recent<br />years. We face many challenges over the coming decade, and the most important evidence of<br />our capacity for change is the change we have already made.<br />We simply are a much morc competitive, productive, internationally-oriented, export<br />based ccononiy.<br />No one would deny that that is what we want to be what we must bc.<br />Australians should be aware of these achievements because they arc theirs. They<br />should know, for Instance, that:<br />we now export almost twice as much as we did a decade ago.<br />that, exports now account for more than 23 per cent of total output.<br />that we now sell more than manufactured products overseas than metal<br />ores and minerals, and, for the first time in our history they match our<br />expotts of rural products.<br />that in 199U-91 our manufactured exports showed the fastest growth in<br />the OECD, and fastest among them were Elaborately Transformed<br />Manufactures which have grown at a rate of about 45 per cent in recent<br />years. that our service exports have tripled in the last decade.<br />that tourism is now our single largest export industry, accounting for<br />over 10 Tper cer, of thc iotal.

<p>TEL: 19. Oct. 92 16: 40 No. 014 P. 02/ 0<br />2<br />that we arc exporting ETMs and services as well as mincral and rural<br />products to thc fastest growing economies in the world thc Asian<br />economics. that we are exporting them through ports which have doubled their<br />productivity in the past couple of years.<br />that they are being generated in officesq and factories and mines which<br />arc increasingly working under enterprise agreements whose number is<br />growing so fast we expect half the workforce to be under them by<br />midway through next year.<br />There has been a great change in our economy and a great change in our attitudes and<br />I think Australians deserve to be reminded of it, and encouraged to take heart and<br />pride from what they have achieved.<br />And it is for thesc reasons that I have to say that I willt passionately resist the<br />Opposition's intentions to undo those achievements.<br />And you shouldn't be surprised if I'm passionate about it because you know it was<br />the L. abor Government which took the leap, against much more internal resistance<br />than you would expect the conservatives to have faced, and made the changes, and<br />opened the economy up.<br />And 1 believe very strongly that we wouldn't have made them, we wouldn't have the<br />chance we now have, if we hadn't taken the people with us.<br />if we hadn't built a consensus, encouraged negotiation and consultation and<br />maintained our commitment to social development.<br />Unashamedly, I take the view that there is a role for government. We cannot<br />responsibly back away from maintaining the necessities of peoples lives, we cannot<br />retreat from our economic role.<br />I take the view that governments can make subtlc and sensible interventions in the<br />economy and I think the facts of the last decade support me.<br />I have no doubt about that and no doubt about the one great certainty in the<br />economic life of this country that a great deal will depend on the continuing cnergy<br />and initiative and skills and ideas of small business.<br />It will continue to depend on the success of people like yourselves and those you<br />represent. We recognise that small and medium sized firms employ much of the Australian<br />labour force over the past two decades small business has generated more than<br />per cent of the new jobs.<br />We recognise that small businesses generate a lot of the new product, and that they<br />drive a lot of those very welcome developments I outlined earlier.<br />We recognise that the potential of their enterprise s unlimited. When they thrive<br />Australia does.</p>
<p>TEL: 19.0ct. 92 16: 40 No. 014 P. 03/ OS<br />3<br />We recognise that they form the basis of much of the future growth and prosperity of<br />the Australian economy.<br />We recognise that it is among them that a lot of the risk is taken. A lot of the<br />necessary risk.<br />They know fear. They know frustration. They know hard work.<br />But they also know hope, and excitement and fulfilment.<br />Recognising all these things, the Government's role is to minimise the frustration, and<br />maximise the fulfilment.<br />Small business has been an integral part of the consultative process of this<br />Government starting with the Economic Summit in 1983 and put on a more permanent<br />footing with the establishment of this very successful Small Business Forum.<br />We have not always agreed with each other.<br />And we have not always been able to do all we would have liked.<br />But the results of the continuing consultation between Government and the<br />representatives of small business can be seen in the measures introduced.<br />Our assistance to business has ranged from the deregulation of financial markets to<br />the deregulation of aviation; reducing company tax to reducing wholesale sales tax on<br />motor vehicles; reducing the number of strikes to a thirty year low to reducing<br />inflation to a thirty year low.<br />We made tax reforms in One Nation specifically for business.<br />the nine week deferral of company tax payments for instance.<br />a new accelerated depreciation schedule which allows plant and<br />equipment with an effective life of, say, ten years, to be written off<br />over five years, rather than eight. A measure which in one year alone<br />constitutes a peak saving to business of $ 1.25 billion.<br />an increased depreciation rate for industrial and short term traveller<br />accommodation from 2.5% to 4%.<br />an increase from 20 to 50 per cent of the capital gains tax exemption<br />ood will, and a doubling of the eligibility ceiling from $ 1 million to<br />2 million of net business interests.<br />We have legislated to allow for the development of Pooled Development Funds to<br />help firms obtain equity capital, and I am pleased to announce that the Equity<br />Investors Ltd has been registered as the first of many PDFs that will play a vital role<br />in assisting the expansion of small and medium sized Australian businesses.<br />Ladies and gentlemen, with public discussion in economic reform directed largely at<br />the need to create internationally competitive industries, there is a tendency to feel that<br />locally made goods and services are uncompetitive.<br />This is a long way from the truth an increasingly long way.</p>
<p>TEL: 19.0ct. 92 16: 40 No. 014 P. 04/ 09<br />4<br />Our agriculture and mining industries are among the most competitive in the world,<br />while the record of our manufacturing and service sectors in responding to the<br />competitive challenge has been simply outstanding.<br />Manufactured exports have grown at a rate of more than 14 per cent each year since<br />1985/ 86 and now total nearly $ 13 billion annually.<br />Exports of services such as tourism have been similarly impressive with a real 8.5 per<br />Cent average annual growth since 1985.<br />And one of the reasons for the extraordinary growth has been the greatly improved<br />quality of the products Australians now make.<br />And small and medium fixed businesses are a major clement of this success.<br />Of course, the Government recognises the extra hurdles small businesses face if they<br />are to succeed in international markets.<br />This is why we established the Export Access pogram that will assist 700 small and<br />medium enterprises over the next three years.<br />These days we build cars and sell them into the most demanding car market in the<br />world, Japan the same country where Peters WA sells $ 50 million worth of ice<br />cream each year.<br />Australian companies build the ferries that cross the English Channel. And some of<br />the best luxury motor yachts in the world.<br />I could list dozens of other examples, but chances are you will know about them,<br />because it is companies like your own or your members' which are doing a lot of these<br />things.<br />The simple fact is that these days, across a whole range of products, you can't buy<br />better than Australian.<br />All of us have an interest in telling Australians about it telling Australians that<br />Australian made products are very often as good, if not better, than anything made<br />anywhere else in the world, and that when they buy them they are doing both<br />themselves and their country a favour.<br />In a sense it is the return on their initiative, imagination and hard work. Buying good<br />Australian products pays the dividend on the all the changes we have made.<br />It is for this reason in this Australian Made month that I am pleased today to<br />announce that the iovcrnment will work with the Advance Australia Foundation to<br />further promote the Australian Made symbol.<br />We will put in $ 2 million in each of the next two years to ensure continuity and a high<br />profile for the campaign.</p>
<p>And a central element of the campaign will be the quality and reliability of products<br />made in Australia.</p>
<p>It's desirablc for example for the Governmnt to regulate unconscionable conductÂ under the trade practices legislation, and we will introduce a Bill into Parliament for<br />passage this session to do just that.Â </p>
<p>It's certainly desirable to have clear and conmprehensive rules to encourageÂ competition and fair pricing.</p>
<p><br />This is one reason the State and the Federal Governments agrccd to the need for a<br />national competition p~ olicy which, as I recently announced, is the subject of an<br />enquiry to be cha" ird y Professor Fred Hilir of the Australian Graduate School of<br />Management. it will look at extending the reach of competition policy into areas not now covered,<br />such as government business enterprises and the professions.<br />There has to be cquality of competitive standing betwecn government enterprise and<br />private enterprise.<br />Again, that is an area where the application of law to Ousincss is a good and necessary<br />thing and, by and large, business both big and small supports it.<br />But I know there are regulatory inconsistencies between thc States or between the<br />States and the Commonwealth areas whcrc regulations may no longer fulfil their<br />original goal, and areas whcre regulations may have been made without sufficient<br />supervision by the Parliament or the Govcrrcment.<br />Many of these problems have been addressed by the adoption of principles of mutual<br />recognition by the States and the Commonwealth.<br />From March next ycar standards recognised in one Statc will be recogniscd in all<br />States. I am firmly committed to cutting inessential regulatory burdens on small businesses<br />but let me tell you that the administrativc burden of a GST will be vastly greatcr than<br />any reporting requirements presently faced by small business.<br />I havc spokent to a lot of small business people about the idea of a Goods and Services<br />Tax in recent months, and I must say I am puzzled by the gap between what they say<br />and what somec small business organisations say on their behalf.<br />The people who spcak to mc recognise that small business would be a big loser from<br />the GST.<br />It is small business which will have to collect the tax. Undcr our amended wholesale<br />sales tax, only 20,000 businesses will be required to be in the system. Most small<br />business will be able to opt out and have no reporting requirement whatsoever.<br />But under the Opposition proposals all small businesses will havc to pay a 15 per cent<br />tax on their purchases, and add a 15 per ent tax to their sales. They will get the first<br />per cent back eventually of course, hut only when they have done the paperwork.<br />They will remit the 15 per cent on sales to the Govermecnt, and again they will have<br />to do the paperwork.</p>
<p>TEL<br />Already, Australian products compete favourably on price; a clearer apprcciation by<br />consumers, other producers and distributors of the quality of our products can only be<br />beneficial for all Australia.<br />In deciding to provide this additional support to thc Australian Made -symbol, I have<br />been very awvare of the problems that have bccn cncounicrcd recently by some<br />doubtful labelling practices.<br />We have all heard stories of thc overseas product with a Made in Australia label<br />because it was packagcd here.<br />Fortunately this is not a major problem with thc Australian Made symbol itself.<br />But it is clcarly a problem with the rangc of descriptions that appear like " Made in<br />Australia", " Product of Australia", " Manufactured in Australia' and so on.<br />And it is not only the consumecr who is confused.<br />Business does not have clear guidelinei and definitions in the various Federal or State<br />legislation to which it must adherc.<br />Accordingly, the Ministcr for Consumer Affairs, Jeanniette. McHugh, has been given<br />the task of developirng practical definitions of such termis to ensure that both<br />consumers and those charged with enforcement such as the Trade Practices<br />Commission and Customs have a solid and universally-applicable basis for<br />assessing whether something is, in fact, Australian made or not.<br />Thcrc will bc a number of complex matters involved in the review and the vicws of all<br />affected parties including the groups represented here today will be welcomed.<br />I will also be writing to the State and Territory governments asking them to contribute<br />to this process and adopt its outcome.<br />I expect that this task can be undertaken without delay, and that we can put<br />appropriate changes into legislation in the first half of next year.<br />I said earlier that 1 know something about the hopes and fears of small business<br />people. I know it primarily because my father ran a medium sized business. I grew up<br />knowing it.<br />For example, I know of the difficulty my father had in persuading the banks to lend<br />him money on cash flow or receivables. They only wanted to lend against the<br />property and I have to say that therc is still too much of that kind of thinking among<br />the banks today.<br />It was hard to get a loan from a bank in those days, and just as hard to finance the<br />business from profits, because undlistributed profits in private companies were taxed<br />in a very discriminatory way.<br />That's one of the things I'm pleased to say I fixed as Treasurer.<br />Government regulation is a particularly difficult prohlcn because there are, Of course,<br />many areas where regulation is desirable. T1E9L: . EOct. 92 16: 40 No. 014 P. 05/ 09</p>
<p>TEL: 19. Oct. 92 16: 40 No. 014 P. 07/ 09<br />7<br />As a New Zealand accountant reported for that country, small businesses people will<br />lose their Sundays to new paperwork.<br />The Canadian expericnce is particularly telling for small business.<br />Canada intfoduced its GST in January 1991. In November 1991, the Canadian peak<br />small business organ on, the CFIB, released the results of a survey it conducted of<br />its members in a report titlcd " The GST: A National Tax Tragedy."<br />Over 25,000 responded to the survey, the biggest response to a CFJB survey ever.<br />And their message was very clear.<br />Over 70 per cent of respondents reported a negative impact from the GST on their<br />businesses while only 8 per cent reported a positive impact.<br />The message was clear small business is much more disadvantaged by a GST than<br />is largc business.<br />Compliance costs were 5.5 per cent of sales for small business but less than 0.2 per<br />cent f) r largc firms.<br />We are told business will b; better off because payroll tax will bc eliminated but<br />most small businesses don't pay payroll tax. Only a small proportion of the 800,000<br />small businesses in this country, pay payroll tax.<br />About 700,000 businesses will not benefit at all from the removal of payroll tax.<br />What they will receive is a new and complex consumption tax which will hit each and<br />every link in the business chain.<br />In a way, the position of small businesses illustrates what I think is one of the biggest<br />problems with a OST.<br />It is a very considerable clerical burden but for nothing.<br />It won't sell one additional article of commerce.<br />It won't help most of the small businesses selling services, which are not taxed now at<br />all. It won't help the construction industry, which will not be able to offset the tax it will<br />pay on all inputs.<br />It won't help the tourist industry, which would be obliged to hit its clients on day one<br />with a 15 per cent price rise.<br />Here we have an industry which is making a tremendous contribution to our export<br />success, which has grown so rapidly in the eighties that it is now one of the major<br />employers and export carers in this country, and the Opposition proposes a<br />cent tax on cvcrything it does.<br />It wants to slap on the tax despite pleas from the Access Economics firm which<br />helped it write the GST package.</p>
<p>TEL<br />It wants to slap it on despite the resistance of the Opposition shadow minister for<br />tourism.<br />Anid it wants to slap it on despite thc nearly unanimous view of the industry iself that<br />important products of the tourism industry should be exempted.<br />It's a similar story with industrial relations, We have right now in Australia a set-up<br />in which employers can ncgotiate just about anything with their eniployccs penalty<br />rates, hours of work, thc working week, work practices and so forth.<br />They can negotiate whatever they wish and come to any agreement they wish, so long<br />as the employees arc not lcft worse off by the new arrangement.<br />That seems to mc a reasonable reservation in our socicly.<br />These deals can be done in a framework of cooperation which has sccn Australia's<br />competitiveness improve by miore than 10 pcr cent over the last decade, and our<br />inflation fall to one of the lowest in thc OECD and in our region.<br />Yet again the Opposition want to throw all that away. It wants to tear up all thc<br />present agreemcnts and awards and return to thc kind of pitched battles bctwcen<br />employers and unions which wc had in the sixties and seventies.<br />Ladies and gentlemecn I began by saying that Australians could take pride in what they<br />have achieved in the past decade, and that they have many reasons for confidene<br />about dccadc ahead.<br />What they have achievced may be attibuted very largely to the spirit of consultation<br />and consensus which dcveloped in the eighties, and which now characteriscs so much<br />of our industrial relations Culture and the relationship between government, business<br />and unions.<br />I said there had been a sea change in the Australian economy: it has been the change<br />in our attitudes and in the way we do things which has produced it.<br />And this will bc the province from which more change comies.<br />Morc than anything elsc, it has been the change in the culture from conflict to<br />cooperation which has brought us up to the rest of thc world and given us a chance.<br />And it is the threat to those gains which I think we should perhaps fear most.<br />I have addressed you today as people engaged in business.<br />In conclusion I would addrcss you as Australians meaning people with a care for thc<br />society and economy at large.<br />It seems to mie, and I quite sure it will become clear to the majority of Australians, that<br />our Opponents' policies will be destructivc of both.<br />Destructive of the economy for the reasons which I have broadly outlined.<br />Destructive of the social fabric principally because they seek to replace the principles<br />of cooperation and consultation with a regression to conflict and divisiorn.<br />We small business and the Government have come a long way in the past decade.<br /><br />Further, I suspect, than of either of us can readily recall.</p>
<p><br />And, faccd with the alternative which the Opposition is proposing with absoluteÂ inflexibility, I do believe we need to be rernindcd.Â We've come too far to throw it all away.</p>
