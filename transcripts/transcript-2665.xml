" THIS DAY TONIGHT"<br />
Interview given by the Prime Minister, the Rt.<br />
Hon. William McMahon on ABC National Television Network<br />
Interviewer : Tony Joyce AUGUST, 1972<br />
Introduction ( Bill Peach)<br />
To revalue or not to revalue, that is the question.<br />
Whether it is noble or not seems to be anybody's guess. Mr.<br />
Whitlam and the Reserve Bank seem to think we should revalue right<br />
away, they think the Australian dollar is undervalued. But no<br />
sooner had Mr. Whitlam said this on TDT last night, then he was<br />
being publicly contradicted by the Labor spokesman on rural affairs,<br />
Dr. Rex Patterson. The Deputy Prime Minister, Mr. Anthony, weighed<br />
in to accuse Mr. Whitlam of'a political crime", and the Prime<br />
Minister, Mr. McMahon, said he thought the Australian dollar should<br />
stay right where it was. The value of the Australian currency has<br />
obviously become a political issue at least the politicians<br />
themselves obviously see it as a political issue. The voters might<br />
be finding it a bit hard. to work out which way the political benefits<br />
would flow from this controversy since it appears there is<br />
disagreement within both the Liberal and the Labor Party on what<br />
we should do about the Aussie dollar. The Prime Minister, Mr.<br />
McMahon, talks with Tony Joyce.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, your Government's own advisers, the<br />
Treasury, the Reserve Bank and most financial experts seem<br />
to agree that a revaluation would ease inflation. Why then<br />
has the Government decided against a revaluation?<br />
PM. We must look at every single effect of the Budget<br />
itself I'm sorry, of the valuation itself. In pure monetary<br />
theory, you can probably justify an increase in the value of<br />
the Australian dollar but when you look at other angles as,<br />
for example, you look at what would happen to our rural<br />
industries and the increased competition they would get and<br />
the lower price they would receive, then you have to think a<br />
second time.<br />
Q. Well the Treasurer, Mr. Snedden, has not yet said<br />
that he is against a revaluation are you going further and<br />
arguing against the revaluation? / 2 </p>
<p>PM. My opinions are exactly t-he same as the<br />
Treasurer who is the Minister most involved' in this and it<br />
is exactly the same as the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr. Anthony.<br />
None of us wants revaluation.<br />
Q. Mr. Snedden has said thouqh that he hasn't said<br />
that there shouldn't be a revaluation.<br />
PM. Has he? I didn't know he'd said that, but I do<br />
know in a conversation with me he has indicated clearly that<br />
our ideas are the same.<br />
Q. Mr. Snedden last night on this programme said that<br />
statements on the currencycould cause speculations. Do you<br />
agree with this?<br />
PM. I agree that statements of the kind made by<br />
Mr. Whitlam could cause problems for us, and that is why I<br />
believe that we have to be clear and definate that we have<br />
no intention of revaluing.<br />
Q. Yet Mr. Anthony has come out quite clearly for<br />
the status quo. Is he not equally culpable with Mr. Whitlam<br />
for making a positive statement?<br />
PM. I think we have to make the positive statement<br />
that revaluation will not take place, neither will devaluation<br />
take place, and that is to make it certain that people will<br />
be able to carry out their transactions without fear of<br />
change in the value of the currency.<br />
Q. You don't think that Mr. Anthony's clear<br />
statement that he doesn't want any revaluation could itself<br />
cause some sort of speculation?<br />
PM. I don't. I think it became critically important<br />
after Mr. Whitlam had made his statement that positive<br />
statements be made on behalf of the Government that no change<br />
would take place.<br />
Q. Tc what extent did Mr. Anthony's public<br />
statements both against revaluation and for an early election<br />
embarrass you and the Government?<br />
PM. Certainvly there could be no embarrassment so far<br />
as changes in the value of the currency were concerned,<br />
because only on Sunday night I went on and said exactly the<br />
same as he had said so that couldn't have caused any<br />
embarrassment to me. The other question hasn't caused much<br />
embarrassment either.<br />
Q. You say it hasn't caused much embarrassment?<br />
PM. Yes.<br />
Q. Mr. Anthony didn't, I believe, consult you before<br />
he made these public statements? </p>
<p>PM. He talked to me about it, yes, and I knew his<br />
views, but he did not think to tell me that he was going on<br />
television, that is correct.<br />
Q. Would you have preferred that Mr. Anthony had<br />
consulted with you?<br />
Pm. I don't think there would have been any difference,<br />
anyhow.<br />
Q. Might this not be seen though in a sense as the<br />
Country Party tail wagging the Coalition dog?<br />
PM. It obviously didn't happen, because I will make<br />
up my own mind, I will listen to advice that is given, but the<br />
decision will be made by me, so your impression of the tail<br />
wagging the dog just couldn't be right.<br />
0. Might this not be an impression that the<br />
electorate could get?<br />
PM. No I don't think so, I think on the contrary it<br />
comes out as a decisive action on my part.<br />
Q. Mr. Anthony seems to see revaluation as an election<br />
issue which could be of some advantage to the Government.<br />
Do you agree?<br />
PM. Yes I do. It will be a marked election advantage<br />
to the Government not only in the country areas but amongst<br />
business and those who want the highest level of employment.<br />
Because if we did revalue I think it would have a bad impact<br />
on employment.<br />
Q. Do you now see an early election as a more<br />
attractive prospect?<br />
PM. I just won't give you an answer to this no matter<br />
how much you might try and encourage me to give the exact<br />
date. I think I have the date in my mind and when the<br />
proper occasion, or the prover moment comes when I'll<br />
announce it, I'll announce it in the House and nowhere else.<br />
Q. If the Budget is a good Budget and revaluation<br />
is a good issue what then would be the advantage of waiting<br />
to a later date?<br />
Pm. Well, I'm asked, and I believe this is critically<br />
important for me. We've made certain promises in the Budget.<br />
They are some of the most humanitarian and profound or<br />
wil1espread of any that I know since I've been in the Cabinet.<br />
I believe that those that give benefits to the people should<br />
be put into law before we go to the polls,<br />
Why then does Mr. Anthony want to go now? / 4 </p>
<p>PM. You must ask him those questions, but the<br />
country is perhaps a little different, substantially<br />
different, from the rest of Australia. That is a question<br />
you'd better ask him not me.<br />
Q. Mr. Snedden, too, has said that he's quite<br />
happy to have an election.<br />
PM. Yes, but the decision is mine and I will make<br />
it and announce it at the appropriate time.<br />
Q. Do you think the electorate is going to be<br />
affected by this apparent split in the coalition?<br />
PM. No I don't because it's a question as to date<br />
not of substance, and I believe the electorate itself will<br />
want to know the promises made are fulfilled before we in<br />
fact go to the people.<br />
Mr. Prime Minister, thank you very much. </p>
