PRIME MINISTER 22/ 95<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
INSPECTOR-GENERAL OF INTELLIGENCE AND SECURITY<br />
The Government has decided to recommend to the Governor-General in Executive<br />
Council the appointment of Mr Ron McLeod AM, Deputy Secretary in the Department of<br />
Defence, as the next Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security. It is proposed that<br />
the appointment will take effect on 6 April 1995. The Leader of the Opposition has been<br />
consulted on the proposed appointment.<br />
Mr McLeod has had a long and distinguished public service career. He has served the<br />
Government in a number of senior positions, including most recently as Deputy Secretary,<br />
Budget and Management in the Department of Defence and, during 1994, as Chairman of<br />
the Review Group which reported on possible changes to the Public Service Act.<br />
The office of Inspector-General was set up by the Government in 1986 following the<br />
second Hope Royal Commission into Australia's security and intelligence agencies to<br />
ensure that the agencies act with legality and propriety. It occupies a central place in the<br />
arrangements for the accountability of Australia's security and intelligence agencies. The<br />
office is a demanding one requiring the highest standards of ability. I am confident that<br />
Mr McLeod's skills and experience make him well suited to the task.<br />
Mr McLeod succeeds Mr Roger Holdich AM, who has almost completed two terms as<br />
Inspector-General. Mr Holdich has decided to resign his appointment some six months<br />
early in order to give his successor time to settle in before he is required to put into effect<br />
whatever changes the Government decides upon as a result of any recommendations<br />
concerning the office of Inspector-General that may arise from the Commission of Inquiry<br />
into AS IS.<br />
Mr Holdich has had a long career of public service, including in my department, the<br />
Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Public Service Commission. As<br />
Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security since 1959 Mr Hold ich has served the<br />
Government with distinction and integrity and has made a particular contribution to the<br />
further development of arrangements for accountability in the intelligence community. I<br />
wish him well in his retirement.<br />
