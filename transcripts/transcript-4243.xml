Jj,, AUSTRALIA,&amp;<br />
PRIME MIN3STER<br />
FOR PRESS OCTOBER 1P 1976<br />
GOVERNMENT PUJRCHASING POLICY<br />
New arrangements have been made to help Australian industry<br />
obtain orders for Government purchases.<br />
The arrangements provide for additional preference for locally<br />
made goods in special cases.<br />
Although the principle of ' best value for money spent' should<br />
generally apply to Government purchases, the Government recognises<br />
that special circumstances can exist in which preference should<br />
be given in favour of Australian production.<br />
It is already standard procedure for Departmental purchasing<br />
authorities to add to tenders involving goods from overseas,<br />
for comparison purposes, the appropriate rate of duty and<br />
primage ( even though these are not paid by the Commonwealth)<br />
so that the protection of normal tariffs was available to local<br />
manufacturers tending for Government orders.<br />
This procedure will be supplemented by new procedures for<br />
reviewing purchases which might be placed overseas.<br />
The Government has now established a Committee of Ministers to<br />
examine cases in which evaluation by purchasing authorities,<br />
on the basis of the ' best value for money' principle would lead<br />
to goods being bought overseas.<br />
The Committee will comprise the Minister for Administrative<br />
Services ( Chairman), the Treasurer, and the Ministers for<br />
Industry and Commerce, Employment and Industrial Relations,<br />
Transport and Business and Consumer Affairs. The Minister for<br />
Defence and the Ministers for other purchasing Departments<br />
will be co-opted as appropriate.<br />
The Committee will consider whether purchase from Australian<br />
sources would assist a depressed industry or area within<br />
Australia, or enable the establishment, development or<br />
retention of industrial or technological capabilities required<br />
for reasons of national security or independence.<br />
A similar procedure operated effectively from 1961 until the<br />
change of Government in 1972. ./ 2 </p>
<p>O 2.<br />
All Government Departments and other bodies are being directed<br />
to ensure that Australian firms are given reasonable opportunity<br />
to bid for all requirements within local capabilities.<br />
The Government reaffirms and will further develop its offsets<br />
policy ( formerly known as the Australian Industry Participation<br />
Scheme) under which Australian industry is enabled to obtain<br />
work as offsets against major overseas purchases by the Government.<br />
This program has already produced over $ 100 million worth of work for<br />
Australian industry, and more can be expected.<br />
The Government believes these new arrangements will help<br />
Australian industry benefit from Government purchasing programs. </p>
