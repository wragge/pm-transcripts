    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to announce that leading Australian-owned meat processor, Nolan Meats, is to receive a $1.6 million grant to assist in a five-year expansion programme for its Gympie abattoir.</p>
<p>Expansion of the plant's export potential will provide greater training opportunities for workers and a significant number of extra jobs for the region.</p>
<p>The project represents the start of a $20 million five-year expansion programme for the abattoir.</p>
<p>Up to 150 permanent and 30 contract jobs are expected to be created for Cooloola Shire and surrounding regions as a result of the expansion.</p>
<p>The funds have been provided under the Dairy Regional Assistance Programme, which funds new projects around Australia in communities affected by dairy de-regulation.  So far 92 projects have been supported.</p>
<p>Nolan Meats abattoir is a modern, well equipped facility. There are approximately 114 dairy farms in the surrounding Cooloola region.</p>
<p>This is the biggest project to receive assistance under the Dairy Regional Assistance Programme.  The company is also seeking $1.2 million from the Queensland Government.  However, State funds are yet to be committed to the project.</p>
<p>The Federal Government recently announced $140 million supplementary assistance to the dairy industry, part of which has been allocated to the Dairy Regional Assistance Programme bringing total funding available for this programme to<br />
$65 million.</p>
<p>Nolan Meats is a registered training organisation and was a State finalist in the 1998-99 "Workplace Rehabilitation Excellence Award", highlighting the firm's commitment to excellence in human resource management.</p>
<p>The Nolan Meats project will result in training opportunities for workers, in particular those seeking to acquire skills and experience.</p>
