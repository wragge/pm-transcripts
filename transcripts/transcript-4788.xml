PRESS OFFICE~ TR~ ANSCRIPT 21 AUGUST 1978<br />
INTERVIEW WITH MIKE PETERSEN<br />
CHANNEL SEVEN<br />
Question:<br />
Why has it taken you five days to refute the allegations<br />
in the. Bulletin?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
In substance, the allegations were refuted by Eric Robinson<br />
and by myself, in the Parliament and I think also outside<br />
it, but the discussions that are referred to took place<br />
amongst ministers, part of it at least in a Ministerial<br />
meeting and I place a very great deal of importance on the<br />
essential confidence of discussions between ministers and<br />
it's only with extreme reluctance that I break that<br />
confidentiality down. Now because the matter had obviously<br />
built up into a matter of some degree of media concern that<br />
just during the weekend I started to have discussions with<br />
the Deputy Prime Minister and also with Eric Robinson as<br />
to whether or not, in this particular circumstance, that<br />
principle confidentiality shouldn't be breached.<br />
Question: Given the fact that the Parliament was sitting until Thursday<br />
night, and you had a meeting at the Lodge of senior ministers<br />
then, might you not have been better to have put this statement<br />
out on Thursday night and therefore saved a lot of damage?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I think with the wisdom of hindsight, that's a very easy ( inaudible)<br />
wisdom to have. It might well have been better to make the<br />
decision that all right, a statement of this kind when the<br />
matter was first raised, but I think you underestimate the<br />
importance I attach to confidentiality. It is very important.<br />
Confidentiality of discussions between Ministers is quite<br />
essential to the good and proper operations of Government.<br />
All right, in view of everything' that's gone on, that's been<br />
broken on this occasion.<br />
Question: Having broken it, you say in a written statement this afternoon:<br />
" I asked Mr. Robinson if he was sure of his recollection to<br />
write me a note". Now since the transcript of the Royal<br />
Commission was available to everyone, why did you need a note?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Because he had said something to Ministers, in front of Ministers,<br />
which made it perfectly plain that it was in his then<br />
recollection, the fact of the phone conversation and not the<br />
details, the substance, the contents of that conversation that<br />
had been related to me. Now one of the things which, if you like,<br />
in a sense has puzzled me, how Eric Robinson can have a very / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
Prime Minister ( continued):<br />
clear recollection of the reporting of that conversation<br />
while I had none. Now if a Minister comes into my office<br />
and says I've been speaking with my Permanent Head, that<br />
is thoroughly unremarkable. It can only be the substance<br />
and the nature of the conversation that start to make it<br />
remarkable. It wasn't only the substance of this conversation,<br />
it was the purpose which Mr. Justice McGregor attached to it<br />
that-really made it remarkable and that came out obviously<br />
many many months later with the Report of the Royal Commission.<br />
If I could just take that one stage further. If a Minister<br />
came into my office and said I haven't had a conversation with<br />
my Permanent Head for three months, I would also find that<br />
remarkable. Now, if it was only the fact of the conversation<br />
and nothing else, that might well have offered an explanation<br />
as to why it was in Eric Robinson's recollection but in no part<br />
of mine whatsoever. Now, that's not the way it fell out, as<br />
the statement indicates.<br />
Question: Did not Mr. Robinson, before the Royal Commissioner, say that<br />
he was quite certain that Senator Withers had mentioned a name<br />
change about talking to Mr. Pearson?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I think it would be a good idea to read the totallity of<br />
this evidence. There are a number of questions on this<br />
particular point. At another point for example, Mr. Robinson<br />
says that he was only aware of the substance and detail of the<br />
conversation when Mr. Pearson gave his evidence before the<br />
Royal Commission.<br />
Question: I'm sure you won't mind if I go back to the question of, however,<br />
why you asked Mr. Robinson, to write you a note.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Because it would explain to me why he remembered the incident<br />
and why I didn't. If it was as, he'd.. related to Ministers at<br />
that time but now, again let me make the point, it was suggested<br />
he should check the transcript. But he did.<br />
Question: Why then, would a busy man write the note first and then<br />
check the transcript. Which you say...<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I don't find that unremarkable. / 3 </p>
<p>3<br />
Question: I'm afraid I do Prime Minister. If you asked him for anote,<br />
surely he would go away and check first, before writing the<br />
note to you?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
The note was never sent. It was never signed. I didn't see<br />
it before today.<br />
Question: I appreciate that. But why would a busy Minister of State<br />
write a note and then go away and check.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Well, that's just the way it fell out.<br />
Question: Are we able to talk to Mr. Robinson about this?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I think you can talk to whoever you like but the fact remains<br />
the note was.. never sent and also, it's worth noting I think<br />
that the note itself, or the draft, because that's all it<br />
ever was, confirms the substance of what I'm saying to you<br />
in very precise detail. 000---</p>
