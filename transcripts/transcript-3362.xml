PRIME MINISTER 23 August 1974<br />
PRESS STATEMENT NO. 309<br />
APPOINTMENTS APPROVED BY THE EXECUTIVE COUNCIL<br />
The Prime Minister announced today the appointment<br />
of Sir John Bunting, at present the Secretary to the Department<br />
of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, as High Commissioner for<br />
Australia in the United Kingdom as from 1 February 1975. The<br />
two-year term of the present High Commissioner, the Hon.<br />
J. I. Armstrong, which expires on 14 December 1974, has been<br />
extended to 31 January 1975.<br />
Mr Whitlam announced that Mr J. L. Menadue, who<br />
is at present a senior executive of the News Limited group of<br />
companies, will succeed Sir John Bunting as Permanent Head of<br />
the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet on<br />
1 February 1975. The Prime Minister said that Sir John Bunting<br />
will be the first non-political High Commissioner to the<br />
United Kingdom. His association and standing with the<br />
Queen's Household, the Commonwealth Secretariat and the British<br />
Civil Service make his appointment especially suitable and<br />
significant. In addition, his long experience as a Departmental<br />
Head and as Secretary to Cabinet will be important qualities<br />
in the office of High Commissioner and the administration of<br />
Australia House. Australia House had been administered by<br />
the Prime Minister' 3 Department until last year, when it was<br />
transferred to the Department of Foreign Affairs. In 1959 the<br />
previous Secretary of the Prime Minister's Department,<br />
Sir Allen Brown, was appointed by Sir Robert Menzies as<br />
Deputy High Commissioner in London.<br />
The Prime Minister said that Sir John was appointed<br />
Head of the Prime Minister's Department in 1959 when he was<br />
years of age and that he is one of the most distinguished<br />
public servants Australia has known. His loyalty, integrity<br />
diligence and dedication have made him a leader and example<br />
among all public servants. He said that his Government was<br />
indebted to Sir John for his untiring assistance at the time of<br />
the change of government in 1972 and in many of the initiatives<br />
subsequently taken by the Government. </p>

The Prime Minister paid a tribute to<br />
Mr John Armstrong's service as High Commissioner in London.<br />
It has crowned a long and distinguished public career. He<br />
has represented Australia with much success and personal credit.<br />
The Prime Minister said it was also a decision<br />
of the Government that the consequential vacancy in the position<br />
of Secretary to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet<br />
would, on this occasion, be filled by a senior executive from<br />
the private sector. Mr Menadue is now 39 years old. After<br />
graduating from the University of Adelaide, he joined the<br />
Bureau of Statistics in 1957 and transferred to the Treasury<br />
in 1959. He became Mr Whitlam's Private Secretary in 1960.<br />
He left Mr Whitlam's staff in 1967 to join the Murdoch<br />
organisation. He has been a member of the Australian Council<br />
for the Arts since its inception last year.<br />
In order to facilitate a smooth transition in<br />
the Department, the Public Service Board had agreed with the<br />
Government that a position of Secretary Designate should be<br />
created and filled by Mr Menadue, and the Governor-General<br />
had approved the Board's recommendation. Mr Whitlam said that<br />
Mr Menadue will take up his position on 23 September, 1974.<br />
