PRIME MINISTER<br />
SPEECH BY THB PRIM M[ NISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP AT<br />
THE AIR FORCES* NORIAL RUIIYME SATURDAY, 4 JUNE<br />
1994 We have come to Runnymede on the fiftieth anniversary of<br />
D-Day to pay tribute to some of tWose who gave their<br />
rives in defence of liberty.<br />
We honour all those whose memory is preserved here.<br />
Never were men braver or more selfless. They gave their<br />
lives so that we might enjoy freedom.<br />
We honour in particular our countrymen: those Australians<br />
who left their homes and all they loved to cross the<br />
world and fight in a war against evil.<br />
Their deeds bestowed great honour on Australia, indelible<br />
honour on themselves.<br />
We should tell our children what this var concerned. Why<br />
Australians came to right alongside the British, the<br />
Americans and the Canadians. Why a generation of<br />
Australians believed freedom was worth dying for. Their<br />
spirit can nourish the life of a nation.<br />
Shortly before I left Canberra my office received a<br />
letter from an Australian, Xr Martin Pirrie, whose<br />
father's brother commanded a small coastal craft offt the<br />
coast of Normandy on D Day. It was his 24th birthday. In<br />
support of the Canadians he went within range of the<br />
enemy's guns and, with others of his crew, was killed.<br />
His brother learned of the event while serving with the<br />
Australian infantry in New Guinea. Kr Pirrie wrote:<br />
I cannot help but feel that in many ways young<br />
Richard typified the spirit of those Australians who<br />
fought and died in the war and reflected the values<br />
and spirit of the country they gave their lives for<br />
in a foreign land.<br />
it is true. It is why we remember them wherever they<br />
served. (; 5199 </p>

It is appropriate on the eve of D-Day's anniversary that<br />
we pay tribute to all the Australians who served in<br />
European campaigns: those who fought against the odds in<br />
Greece and Crete; those who spent precious years of their<br />
lives in prison camps in Europe; those who served in the<br />
forces of other allied nations; those who fought and died<br />
in the crucial war at sea.<br />
In Australia the memory of every one of them who died is<br />
held sacred: their names are recorded on the walls of the<br />
Australian War Memorial with the 100,000 others who made<br />
the supreme sacrifice for their country.<br />
The names of 1397 Australians more than a quarter of<br />
all our airmen killed in Europe in World War 11 are<br />
inscribed here at Runnymnede. They number among the<br />
eighteen thousand Au4stralian servicemen and women with no<br />
known grave.<br />
The Tomb of the Unknown Australian Soldier is for them.<br />
The principles for which Australians fought in Europe are<br />
universal ones. Liberty, justice and human decency do not<br />
know the boundaries of nations or cultures, any more than<br />
courage and sacrifice know them.<br />
So it is right that they should be honoured here among<br />
those from other countries with whom they fought and died<br />
in common cause.<br />
And it is right that they should be honoured in the<br />
country from which came the most stalwart resistance to<br />
tyranny. For Britain embodied the courage democracy<br />
needed. Britain inspired the tree world and those whose<br />
freedom had been taken from them. There can be no doubt<br />
she inspired those whose names are recorded here.<br />
In the course of the war two Australian Prime Ministers,<br />
Robert Menzies and John Curtin, came to Britain and were<br />
moved by her example.<br />
John Curtin visited shortly before D-Day. When he<br />
returned to Australia, he reminded the Parliament of the<br />
epic dimensions of the British effort. It is worth our<br />
being reminded now.<br />
" They have thwarted an invasion by a great and powerful<br />
continental foe" he said.<br />
At the risk of their local defence they have<br />
conducted campaigns overseas, and are at present<br />
engaged in the greatest of all. They have<br />
maintained command of the sea over a large part of<br />
the globe. They have conducted an air offensive in<br />
Europe. They have produced immense quantities of<br />
munitions and supplies not only for their own<br />
requirements, but for other-members of the United<br />
Nations.<br />

Fifty years later the admiration John Curtin expressed<br />
lives on. It is true that in fundamental ways our future<br />
is less closely intertwined with Britain's than our past.<br />
But whatever different paths we take the history we share<br />
the story we share goes with us. The battles we<br />
fought together will be remembered. The men and women<br />
who fought them will be remembered. And Britain's heroic<br />
defence of freedom will never be forgotten.<br />
Nor shall the Australian airmen of this memorial be<br />
forgotten.<br />
Twenty thousand Australian aircrew served in Bomber<br />
Command 3486 were killed, a death rate to compare with<br />
that on the Western Front in World War I.<br />
They were young men. They knew how high the risks were.<br />
Rollo Kingsford-Smith commanded No 463 RAAF Lancaster<br />
Squadron. The Squadron had an operational aircrew of<br />
about 240, yet in the 18 months after November 1943, 546<br />
were killed or posted as missing in action.<br />
Mr Kingsford-Smith wrote to se a few weeks ago:<br />
Young inexperienced crews coming into my Squadron<br />
knew their death was almost certain, yet their<br />
morale was always high and they fought the Germans<br />
and the weather with equal determination. Other<br />
Australian squadrons and Australians in RAF<br />
squadrons would tell a similar story.<br />
These Australians served their<br />

Western Front had served.<br />
The loss of their young<br />

But it can never be doubted that they fought in a great<br />
cause.<br />
Mr Kingsford-Smith tells me that " many next-of-kin of<br />
those Air Force men feel Australia has forgotten then.."<br />
From today let there be no doubt that we will always<br />
remember them.<br />
