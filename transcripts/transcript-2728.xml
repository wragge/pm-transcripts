CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
NATIONAL PRESS CLUB<br />
CANBEIRA 29 NOVEMBER 1972<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hhn. William McMahon<br />
M. P.<br />
Mr. President, Members of the National Press Club and Ladies and<br />
Gentlemen of the National Press;<br />
One of the perennial questions in a democracy like ours<br />
is the one about the Press and politics.<br />
Does the Press have the power to radically influence the<br />
political process? Can the Press actually change a Government or alter an<br />
election result? And as a politician, I am isked with some regularity what<br />
a Government ought to do about it.<br />
Well, I'll give you one commitment and one non-election<br />
promise. I am committed to a free Press as an essential element<br />
of a democracy and I would always want to preserve it.<br />
And I make the non-promise. We will not establish a<br />
Ministry for the media.<br />
I noticed that a distinguished British Journalist said the<br />
other day that newspapers who claimed they could win an election were<br />
being fanciful. I'm not sure how closely this translates to the Australian<br />
situation, but I will say this to you:<br />
That all the praise and the blame,<br />
agreements and disagreements,<br />
and conflicts of opinion between politicians<br />
and the Press eventually finish up at one point.<br />
and we will reach that point on Saturday<br />
when all the newspaper readers,<br />
television viewers<br />
and radio listeners<br />
turn themselves into voters and make the final<br />
decision for themselves.<br />
That's the only way to settle the argument.<br />
Ana i think for once we all have to agree that it's the<br />
correct and proper method. / 2 </p>
<p>4 2-<br />
Having said that, I come to my main purpose in accepting<br />
your invitation today<br />
And that is to review this election campaign and the<br />
major issues that are before the Australian people today.<br />
If I could sunarise them briefly in the form of a list<br />
but not necessarily in order of importance, they are<br />
First of all<br />
representative Government.<br />
Gcod Government rests on three basic principles:<br />
It should be truly representative.<br />
There must be respect for the rule of law:<br />
And there must be an independent judiciary to protect<br />
the individual against the State.<br />
As an elected representative, you are there for the<br />
people's purposes Not your own<br />
And you should reflect the ambitions and the vitality<br />
and the feelings of all Australians.<br />
This goes hand in hand with my strong conviction<br />
that no single person or group of people should become dominant<br />
or too powerful in the community.<br />
That is the road to dictatorship.<br />
And here lies the fundamental and primary difference.<br />
We stand fcr truly representative Government.<br />
We are there to reflect the will and the wishes of the<br />
people, and I believe we do.<br />
The evidence of the years against Labor is overwhelming<br />
and irrefutable. Labor Members of Parliament are pledged to obey<br />
the instructions of the party machine.<br />
This has been true for many years. It remains true,<br />
despite Mr. Whitlam's cosmetic efforts.<br />
In fact, it may well be that a Labor Government in the<br />
nineteen-seventies would be more subject to outside non-elected<br />
direction than in the nineteen-forties.<br />
It is certainly true that the influence of the left wing<br />
unions through Mr. Hawke and the A. C. T. U. executive is stronger.<br />
So that remains a primary issue.<br />
The second question is that of irresponsibility and<br />
inflation which has been made an issue by Whitlam's costly and<br />
incredible total of 140 policy promises.<br />
Together with his delv. sions about w. hat can be done with<br />
the growth rate. </p>
<p>-3<br />
Closely linked with this is the state of the economyaad<br />
the management of the economy.<br />
The latest indicators<br />
Industrial production,<br />
New motor vehicle registrations,<br />
And building approvals,<br />
All confirm the diagnosis of an economy which is bubbling<br />
along and which by this time next year<br />
or possibly a few months earlier<br />
may well be in the condition of boom.<br />
Clearly it is not appropriate in the coming months to<br />
unleash demand in the tremendous and irresponsible manner that<br />
Labor's huge list of promises implies.<br />
Next, there is the very real question<br />
of why the Labor Party wants to run away from the<br />
issues of respect for the law.<br />
And the preservation of accepted social values,<br />
now that the election is so close.<br />
They are. badly divided on this.<br />
And that issue is very closely tied in with Labor's<br />
impotence and silence on industrial relations and the future of<br />
the arbitration system.<br />
There is the question also of the party which puts<br />
itself up as an alternative Government consistently skating away<br />
from and trying to dodge the great issue of the defence and foreign<br />
policies of this nation.<br />
And the issue of centralism versus federalism, which<br />
is an expression of one of the great and overriding philosophical<br />
gulfs between us and the socialists.<br />
As well there is the question of campaign opportunism<br />
again made an issue by Labor's<br />
on-the-run attempts to prOduce last-minute vote-catchers<br />
and plug gaps which it seems oven the 140 election<br />
promises did not cover.<br />
Then there are the other great issues.<br />
Is there to be freedom or onforc--d conformity and<br />
monolithic control of education in Australia?<br />
Is freedom of choice<br />
and the whole private and religious hospital system<br />
to be destroyed in the name of a single, depersonalised and more<br />
expensive health machine? / 4 </p>
<p>04 4<br />
Are our cities to be renewed and our new cities built<br />
according to the rules of the political game or should it be done<br />
by a properly constituted expert body advising both Federal and<br />
State Governments? Those are some of the major issues.<br />
But let me look at them in a little more detail.<br />
The Labor Policy Speech ( and his attempt at economics<br />
at Queanbeyan) showed that Mr. Whitlam had dropped all prctence of<br />
responsibility and moderation in this attempt to buy his way into<br />
office and bluff his way through the questio-n of cost and the<br />
impact on the economy.<br />
We have attempted to make sense<br />
out of this ness of ambiguity and half-baked proposals<br />
in order to get a fair and sensible estimato. of costs<br />
to the taxpayer. As you know, their figure was $ 1,330 million against<br />
$ 375 million for my Government's election proposals.<br />
That is, four times the cost.<br />
A~ s you know, too, Labor's figure covered only a few of<br />
the firm proposals and have not been costed.<br />
We had to leave out many of Labor's deceptive and vague<br />
proposals simply because they-were too sloppy for any disciplined<br />
and proper costing.<br />
In total, they would most certainly run into many<br />
hundreds of millions more.<br />
All this was wrapped up in pious talk about open<br />
Government. M4r. Whitlan might well have started by being open about<br />
the exact nature of his proposals,<br />
their timing,<br />
the specific priorities in implementing his myriad<br />
promises, and, most importantly, how they are to be paid for.<br />
He has been too clever by half in dodging the taxation<br />
question by saying there will be no change in taxation rates.<br />
Every Australian knows that rising incomes and prices<br />
automatically cause a greater and greater burden of actual tax in<br />
dollars. The serious inflationary consequenices of the Labor<br />
programme such as thle 35-hour week and reduction in immigration<br />
would accelerate the speed at which the burden becomes<br />
heavier and heavier, and the tax paid becomes punitive. </p>
<p>N 5<br />
We have recognised this with two large tax cuts since<br />
the last election Nearly 10 percent in the 1S70-71 Budget<br />
and an average of 10 percent in the Budget three months<br />
ago. Mr. Whitlam hopes that no one will see through his<br />
lawyer's talk about tax rates rather than actual dollars paid in<br />
tax. As a means of financing his white elephants through a<br />
two-way squeeze of inflation-boosted taxation.<br />
This policy is not only dishonest to the taxpayer<br />
and inhuman in its effects<br />
on fixed income earners<br />
and social service beneficiaries<br />
it is also inadequate<br />
to meet the huge costs involved.<br />
Taxation rates themselves would have to go up,<br />
or it would have to be done through new or increased<br />
indirect taxes. Remember, Labor would impose two new taxes immediately.<br />
The Health levy of 1.35% and the Social Services tax<br />
of Or 3.85 cents in every dollar of your earnings.<br />
We have reduced personal income taxation twice, as I<br />
have already mentioned.<br />
As I said at the beginning of this campaign and I repeat<br />
now, Under Labor either taxes will have to be increased,<br />
or many of Labor's promises wo* uld have to be quietly<br />
dropped as forgotten election gimmicks.<br />
: nd Labor talks about trusting the people.<br />
While it deliberately perpetrates this slick and<br />
unworthy deceit. In fact, 1ir. Whitlam doesn't trust his own Shadow<br />
Treasurer who was candid enough to admit<br />
that anyone over the $ 90 to $ 95 a week level would pay<br />
more tax under Labor.<br />
It is typically dishonest of him to try and get around<br />
this by talking about tax rates.<br />
Most people are rightly concerned with just how much is<br />
going to be left in their pockets.<br />
But the misery of<br />
unremitting taxation burdens<br />
chained to unchecked inflation<br />
is only one side of this type of mandrake economics<br />
we hear from the Leader of the Opposition.<br />
You know what I mean. / 6 </p>
<p>-6<br />
Think~ of the growth rate halve it and then-pretend<br />
you can multiplyit-by magic.<br />
The other side of this story is simply the very structure<br />
of Government which the history and geography of this nation has given<br />
us that is the three-tiered Federal system.<br />
The whole thrust of the socialist takeover scheme is the<br />
concentration of all political power here in Canberra<br />
while State and Local Governments are to be strangled<br />
and emasculated. There aro a lot of wolves in sheep's clothing around the<br />
place on this subject.<br />
Not least M4r. Whitlam himself.<br />
But I put it to you that no one who has read the Labor<br />
Platform, the Labor Policy Speech,<br />
or Mr. Whitlam's many constitutional speeches could<br />
have any doubt about his Party's true intention.<br />
To put it in the words of my friend, Bob Askin:<br />
" They want to murder the States"<br />
The policy of the Liberal Party on this issue could not<br />
be more opposed to that of Labor.<br />
We are convinced that power should not be sucked into<br />
the centre but pushed out and down to the grass roots, close to<br />
the problems and close to the people.<br />
his is a world trend, even in Mr. Whitlam's so-called<br />
" comparable countries."<br />
So much for the Policy Speeches.<br />
What have we seen since from our oppocnents?<br />
Incredibly it appears that Mr. Whitlam was not satisfied<br />
with his 140 promises, once he saw our proposals.<br />
Opportunism was piled on top of irresponsibility and we<br />
heard first that Labor would match our plans for $ 330 million for<br />
city transport. Since then, every time he arrives in a capital city he<br />
adds another titbit from a stolen report<br />
and at last count, was well past the $ 700 million mark<br />
in extra transport promises.<br />
On tcp of that, his Deputy suddenly discovered that<br />
Labor might also be able to afford an enlistment bonus for the<br />
army although this appears to be still in the half-baked<br />
promise category. / 7 </p>
<p>-7<br />
Two more bribes from the Labor Party.<br />
After that we have heard virtually nothing from Labor's<br />
sham campaign but a few belated bleats about their half-hearted plans<br />
to quieten down organised Labor rowdies<br />
who have been trying to drown out my own election<br />
meetings around the country.<br />
The truth is that once the Labor Party had trotted out<br />
its T-shirt, TV commercials and its tremendous election bribes,<br />
it ran for cover, leaving it to Mr. Sayers to throw the<br />
mud. With -plenty of financial support, of course.<br />
So what then have we seen in this campaign?<br />
Mr. Whitlam is scared of defence and foreign policy.<br />
He refuses to discuss law and order.<br />
He has been muzzled on industrial relations policy.<br />
He won't talk about immigration.<br />
He wants to wash his hands of moral issues.<br />
So much for trusting the people<br />
So much for leadership.<br />
Let me sp. eak to you now about this question of<br />
leadership. I know many of you are experts in this area<br />
you write about it so much.<br />
So you may want to know how I see it.<br />
As I said at the start, I believe Government should be<br />
truly representative. That is the first of the three ingredients of good<br />
Government. The second is that we should respect the rule of law.<br />
And the third is that we should have an independent<br />
judiciary that can be able to determine disputes between the<br />
individual and the State.<br />
So I believe that a man should have those qualities of<br />
leadership which will make certain he can<br />
sensibly and satisfactorily interpret the will and the<br />
wishes of the people.<br />
He should also be able to makec the machinery of<br />
Government function in such a way that those wishes can be put into<br />
practice. And the people themselves should be kept informed that<br />
he is carrying out their will in the way they wan -t him to do.<br />
He is also the man<br />
who can create the conditions under w~ ich the individual<br />
himself can realise his own ambitions ( providing. they don't interfere<br />
with the rights of others), / 8 </p>
<p>8<br />
can satisfy his needs and his wants, can help his<br />
neighbours, and can help to develop the better society we all want.<br />
It is also a fundamental task of leadership for the<br />
Government. to interpret the changes occurring in society as life<br />
becomes more complex<br />
to be able to adjust<br />
the Parliament<br />
and the law<br />
in order to mesh with the changing environment and<br />
changing values. Now, I'd like to relate these thoughts to my own<br />
party to show how in a practical way we have been able to<br />
put these principles into practice.<br />
I faced a difficult task when I took office twenty<br />
months ago, as most of you have recognised<br />
with no small emphasis in your reporting.<br />
First of all, I had to make sure<br />
that the State Premiers were treated as men<br />
with their own serious responsibilities of Government in their<br />
own areas. The results have been worthwhile.<br />
The relations between the Commonwealth and the States<br />
are much better and they have been able to play a much more<br />
effective part in getting this good society that we all seek<br />
to achieve. Then we had the problem<br />
of unemployment getting too high<br />
and demand for goods and services falling.<br />
We had the problems of falling prices for rural<br />
commodities and the exchange rate<br />
and the alarming rise in wages and average earnings<br />
and industrial lawlessness.<br />
So we deliberately set cut to boost demand<br />
to get production and employment rising<br />
and to improve the climate of expectations<br />
so that economic conditions would be improved.<br />
Part of this was to ensure that people would have<br />
the opportunity to earn more money<br />
and keep a greater amount of it in their own pockets.<br />
After all, this is the incentive to do better<br />
remembering always that there are national and<br />
social nieds which the Government must take into account<br />
at the same time as it looks at the tax burden on<br />
the individual. / 9 </p>
<p>9-<br />
So as I have said, we twice reduced taxation<br />
substantially to meet this objective.<br />
Looking at this problem in the much wider national<br />
sense You will remember that we acted with a series of<br />
measures The Premiers' Conferences<br />
with the mini-Budget<br />
the Budget<br />
and then on to our Policy Speech<br />
In all of these, you will see that our objective<br />
has been to represent the individual men and women in our<br />
society. And we wanted to give priority to those in the<br />
greatest need. I believe any honest witness will agree that we have<br />
achieved our purpose.<br />
But once having satisfied those basic or conventional<br />
needs we believe there's much more the Government should,<br />
and must That is, to promote the arts<br />
to Provide opportunities for recreation<br />
opportunities for travel<br />
opportunities to ensure that if man is the paramount<br />
objective of social life,<br />
that he is able to realise inherite* d1 qualities<br />
to burgeon and to grow<br />
and to ensure that as he burgeons and grows<br />
he will be able to help his own family<br />
his neighbours<br />
and to more helpfully participate in the social<br />
life of the community.<br />
In my view, this is the true objective of Government<br />
I don't believe in dictatorship.<br />
I do believe in leadership.<br />
I hope that I have made some contribution to<br />
achieving the true liberal ideal<br />
of ensuring that the person himself<br />
the individual man, woman or child<br />
can have a much better life, a much happier one,<br />
and that his prospects for the future in the wider sense can be<br />
fully realised. We have come a long way along this road in twenty<br />
months. Notwithstanding both the economic and political<br />
conditions which were very much le: os than ideal.<br />
The economy is now in good shape and obviously<br />
getting better. The quality of social ju., tice has been greatly<br />
improved. And I have a young, ablB and dedic-ated team of<br />
Ministers with me. </p>
<p>I think Australians recognise that what we have<br />
done has been sound and practical and progressive as well.<br />
I think they recognise<br />
that we are moving into better times<br />
and a greater future<br />
a future in which good Government<br />
means that it is the Government's job to do its<br />
best to meet the will and wishes of the people as individuals.<br />
I am therefore convinced that when it comes to the<br />
decision on Saturday<br />
they will accept us<br />
and reject the alternative of a Goverrnment which<br />
wants to impose its will and its machinery and its theories<br />
on the people themselves.<br />
Thank you. </p>
