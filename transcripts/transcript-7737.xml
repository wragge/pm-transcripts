PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH ALLAN DICK, PACIFIC RADIO, NEW<br />
ZEALAND, 12 SEPTEMBER 1989<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
DICK: We dithered a lot in this country over the purchase<br />
of the two frigates. Are you pretty satisfied with what<br />
we've done?<br />
PM4: Yes, I am. It's the purchase of two with an option of<br />
a further two. I'm pleased with that and I certainly want<br />
to make it clear to your listeners there, Allan, that this<br />
has not been a case of Australia standing over or attempting<br />
to stand over New Zealand. What we've tried to do is to put<br />
our case as to why we think, in terms of future<br />
relationships and future capacities and future<br />
inter-operabilities of our forces, that this was a sensible<br />
decision. But, in the end, the New Zealand Government has<br />
made a decision according to its assessment of what New<br />
Zealand's best interests are. I'm very pleased with the<br />
decision. DICK: Were you beginning to get a bi~ t impatient though with<br />
all our dithering and chain dragging?<br />
PM: Well, I suppose it's fair to say we would have liked to<br />
have seen a decision earlier, but let me say quite<br />
straightforwardly that I understand that within New Zealand,<br />
both within the Labour Party and more generally, that there<br />
are people of goodwill who had reservations about the wisdom<br />
of this decision. I respect their integrity, but I am<br />
certain that the decision that it's taken is the right one.<br />
So if, in the result, we've got a decision which is better<br />
understood within New Zealand so much the better.<br />
DICK: One of these confidential business newsletters that<br />
every country appears to have says that we now have aligned<br />
ourselves with the Australian defence and that the<br />
flexibility on the price was in fact based on the Australian<br />
perceived fears of Indonesia some time in the next 20 years.<br />
Do you think that would be incorrect?<br />
PM: No, we haven't developed our defence policy on the<br />
basis of perceived fears of any particular nation, but we<br />
have developed our white paper, on defence and </p>
<p>-2-<br />
ensuing policy decisions on the basis that we have to accept<br />
a responsibility for any likely eventuality into the future.<br />
We see the future, sensibly handled, as one where there<br />
shouldn't be conflict. But no Government can responsibly<br />
ignore that it must accept the necessity of taking decisions<br />
which enable you to meet with any possible eventuality.<br />
That's what we've done. But Australia, like New Zealand, is<br />
a peace loving nation and if you are going to understand our<br />
decision, not only in regard to frigates, but in regard to<br />
the acquisition of other naval craft and aircraft, this has<br />
to be seen in the context of the fact that I think no nation<br />
has done more in the international councils of the world to<br />
push the causes of peace and disarmament.<br />
DICK: Have you noticed anything already in New Zealand's<br />
attitude towards Australia now that we've got Geoffrey<br />
Palmer as Prime Minister? Have you noticed any change at<br />
all so far?<br />
PM: No, I think that would be quite unfair to David Lange.<br />
I mean, it's fair to say this, that although David and I had<br />
a difference of view on the question of the ANZUS<br />
relationship and ships visits a difference which was<br />
conducted between us intelligently and civilly I must say<br />
in fairness to David Lange that in all our meetings,<br />
particularly in relevant international fora like the<br />
Commonwealth Heads of Government and the Pacific Forum, he<br />
was always very supportive of me and the positions which I<br />
took because we had views which, apart from that major area<br />
of difference, coincided. So, if I were to say that now<br />
things are better with Geoffrey, that would be unfair to<br />
David. But let me say this, I've always enjoyed very good<br />
relations with Geoffrey including jus) L being able to pip him<br />
on the golf course in New Zealand and-we respect one<br />
another. I like him very much and what I see as a<br />
continuation under Geoffrey Palmer of the warm relationships<br />
that existed with his predecessor.<br />
DICK: I showed the good judgement to go to Australia for a<br />
holiday last year and while I was there I read a Sydney<br />
newspaper. One of the things that was being said by<br />
manufacturers, I think it was a manufacturing group, was<br />
this. Now that we've got CER in place, don't overlook the<br />
New Zealand market. It might be small but after all it has<br />
got the population of Sydney. As I put the brakes on the<br />
car I thought ' well, we really are pretty small aren't we?'<br />
PM: well, Sydney's pretty big of course too. That's the<br />
other way of looking at it and you ought to try driving<br />
through it. But let me say this, the CER agreement between<br />
our two countries has been enormously successful. There's<br />
been a very, very significant growth in two-way Trans Tasman<br />
trade since we negotiated the agreement in 1983. In fact,<br />
, the ave-rage growth in that Trans Tasman trade since 1983 has<br />
been 14-percent per annum. So this has been good for both<br />
countries. </p>
<p>DICK: New Zealanders continue to flood to Australia, even<br />
though every day across here we hear more bad news about the<br />
Australian economic scene<br />
PM: You haven't been reading all the right news then.<br />
DICK: Perhaps not. Can you understand what it is that's<br />
dragging New Zealanders in their tens of thousands to<br />
Australia? PM: We're a very attractive country. Well, let me say,<br />
that relatively the employment position in Australia has<br />
been more attractive than New Zealand. I mean, I can give<br />
you some idea of the dimension of employment growth since<br />
we've been in Government. We've had an employment growth<br />
since we've been in office which is about half your<br />
population. In other words, we've had over one and a half<br />
million new jobs created in Australia since we came to<br />
office in March of 1983. That increase in employment has<br />
been across a wide range of industries, particularly in the<br />
tourist industry and a lot of that has been in areas which<br />
are very congenial. So, where you've had a greater problem<br />
in regard to employment than we have, I suppose people have<br />
made the judgement over there that they've got a relatively<br />
better chance of employment and in relatively congenial<br />
environments here.<br />
DICK: There's always been a pretty strong spirit of<br />
competition between Australia and New Zealand.<br />
PM: There sure has.<br />
DICK: Do you think it's perhaps stronger from our point of<br />
view than the Australian?<br />
PM: I guess so and I guess that's understandable. I mean,<br />
I don't take gloat in the fact but it is the fact that we<br />
are relatively very much bigger, I mean, in both the size of<br />
our country and the size of our population, we're about 17<br />
million which is five or so times your size. It's<br />
inevitable in circumstances like that, that the relatively<br />
smaller country is going to be the one which is relatively<br />
more aggressive in its attitude. I think that's perfectly<br />
natural and understandable. Without making an exact<br />
parallel, I suppose you'd think of the position of Canada<br />
and the United States where the same sort of phenomenon<br />
exists. </p>
<p>DICK: We continue, I'm talking about New Zealand continues<br />
to be at logger heads with the USA primarily because of our<br />
anti-nuclear stance, the Australians aren't. Is that a<br />
problem for you?<br />
PM: Well let me put the position this way. We have made it<br />
quite clear from 1984 when this Government came to office in<br />
New Zealand that we didn't agree with their nuclear ships<br />
policy. We took the view and maintain the view that you<br />
can't have a defence alliance relationship, which is what<br />
ANZUS is, and say to you " hello I'm sorry your ships can't<br />
come to our port". That to us is a claytons policy. A<br />
claytons defence alliance relationship policy. Now we say<br />
that with no sense of aggression or superiority. That's our<br />
view. You have a different view. But the fact of the<br />
difference meant that we weren't able to have as an<br />
effective defence interrelationship between the United<br />
States, Australia and New Zealand as existed before. There<br />
was some limitations on the exchange of intelligence<br />
information, but with the full understanding of our American<br />
friends in that situation. We tended to increase the<br />
bilateral defence relationship between Australia and New<br />
Zealand because that made a lot of sense because we have<br />
shared responsibilities in regard to the South Pacific. So<br />
it has been a case of saying well you have your view, we<br />
have ours, we think we're right, we know you think your<br />
right, but don't let that stop, in any way, the relationship<br />
between the two of us.<br />
DICK: $ 64 billion question. There is not a great deal of<br />
difference in attitudes between Australia and New Zealand<br />
and it is not going to happen in your'. life time or mine, but<br />
political amalgamation, 100 years away?<br />
PM: It is silly to put any time table on it Allan. I'd<br />
simply say this, that it is not, as far as we are concerned,<br />
a pressing issue, and I wouldn't understand that it is in<br />
New Zealand, but if you look at the whole span of human<br />
history with things that at one stage didn't seem possible,<br />
( they) changed. And all I can say is that if that is ever<br />
going to eventuate, it will only eventuate if the peoples of<br />
the two countries come mutually to a perception that it<br />
would be in their respective self interest for it to happen.<br />
So I think that this is a slow evolution, it may occur, but<br />
it won't occur in my political life time. If at some time<br />
during the life of my children or their children, our<br />
dependants here and in New Zealand just make the decision<br />
that a full political integration would be in their best<br />
interests, then it will happen. </p>
<p>DICK: How about a common unit of currency though?<br />
PM: Well, I was talking earlier about the CER. We are in<br />
this situation, if I can look at the steps that occurred.<br />
By July of next year virtually all impediments in the way of<br />
trades and good and services will have been removed and that<br />
will be five years ahead of the schedule that was<br />
contemplated when it was signed in 1983. What we're into<br />
now is the sort of next stages of discussing the issues of<br />
an investment agreement and harmonisation of business law<br />
and cooperation in customs and quarantine areas. So we are<br />
well ahead of the schedule that was set. The next major<br />
review of the . CER is set to take place in 1992 and in that<br />
there will obviously be some fairly difficult issues<br />
involved. Now whether, with the accelerated pace of dealing<br />
with issues that marked the way it has operated so far,<br />
whether we will get to that stage in the foreseeable future<br />
I can't say. But obviously, while posing some advantages,<br />
also has difficulties. I mean in terms of the fixing of<br />
exchange rates and so on.<br />
DICK: Final question Mr Hawke. You have already indicated<br />
that you going to stand again. When do you see yourself<br />
retiring? PM: What I have said is that I will lead the party in this<br />
coming election and the next one. I think probably after<br />
that it will be time to think about it. But I am nearly<br />
now, I will be 60 in December. I think it is generally<br />
considered that I am a pretty fit and healthy and alert near<br />
and that sort of schedule would have me up into the mid<br />
and then I think there is plenty-of time for life after<br />
politics then.<br />
DICK: Prime Minister, Mr Bob Hawke. It has been a<br />
pleasure. Thank you for your time Sir.<br />
PM: Thank you very much indeed Allan.<br />
DICK: Thank you very much indeed Sir.<br />
