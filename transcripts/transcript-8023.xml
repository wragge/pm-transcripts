PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 15 MAY 1990<br />
Prime Minister Palmer of New Zealand has accepted my<br />
invitation to visit Australia in early July.<br />
The main purpose of the visit is to mark the achievement<br />
of full free trade in goods between Australia and New<br />
Zealand on 1 July and to discuss future directions under<br />
the Close Economic Relations ( CER) Agreement.<br />
I am pleased that progress achieved to date under CER has<br />
been faster and more extensive than had been thought<br />
possible when the Agreement was signed in 1983. Since<br />
then, total bilateral trade across the Tasman has grown<br />
at an average annual rate of 14%, from about SA1.8<br />
billion in 1982-83 to SA4.18 billion in 1988-89. New<br />
Zealand remains Australia's fourth-largest trading<br />
partner overall, our third-largest destination for<br />
exports and fifth-largest source of imports.<br />
A review of the CER arrangements undertaken in 1988 led<br />
to acceleration of trade liberalisation between our two<br />
countries, and a further review is due in 1992. Mr<br />
Palmer and I will be discussing that review and the<br />
opportunities it provides for us to look to the future<br />
interaction of our economies and to enable us both to<br />
take advantage of emerging regional trading<br />
opportunities. 73 11 </p>
