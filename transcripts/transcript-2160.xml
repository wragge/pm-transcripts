Issued from the Office<br />
of the Press Secretary<br />
to the Prime Minister.<br />
FOR PRESS: TALKS WITH VICE-PRESIDENT<br />
The Vice-President, Mr. Spiro T. Agnew, called<br />
on the Prime Minister this morning. Subsequently, Mr. Agnew<br />
met members of the Cabinet for a discussion and exchange of<br />
views on matters of mutual interest to the Australian and U. S.<br />
Governments. It has been helpful both to the Australian Ministers<br />
and to the Vice-President to exchange views between the two<br />
Governments in person on these matters.<br />
The discussions emphasised the continuing<br />
co-operation of Australia and the United States. This involves<br />
co-operation both in defence and in peaceful development.<br />
