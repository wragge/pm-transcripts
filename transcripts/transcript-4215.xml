PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESSAUGUST 18, 1976<br />
MESSAGE FROM THE PRIME MINISTER TO PRESIDENT MARCOS<br />
On behalf of the people and the Government of Australia I<br />
wish to express our deepest sympathies and sorrow for the<br />
tragic loss of life and the injuries that have been caused<br />
by the earthquake in the southern Philippines. I would like<br />
you to know that Australia stands ready to afford whatever<br />
assistance it can within its resources and I should be grateful<br />
if you could advise me through the Australian Embassy in Manila<br />
of your most urgent needs. </p>
