    <content><![CDATA[<p>Australia and our Pacific neighbours share more than an ocean; we have a common interest in regional development and security.</p>
<p>The Pacific Islands Forum discussed practical ways Pacific Island countries can grow their economies, including through securing sustainable economic returns from their fisheries and maximising the potential of information technology.</p>
<p>I was pleased to announce that, in addition to our $2 billion Pacific patrol boat replacement programme, Australia will provide around $19 million per year to further enhance maritime surveillance and coordination in the region. If countries can more easily identify and target illegal fishers and other transnational criminals, it will help ensure ongoing returns from Pacific fisheries.</p>
<p>Improved internet access will help drive our regionâs economic prosperity. To take advantage of this potential, we need to work together to ensure trust, confidence and stability in cyberspace. Australia will help train regional business leaders to improve their defences against cybercrime.</p>
<p>The Pacific is particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. The Forum leaders agreed that the Paris climate change meeting needs to advance long-term global climate action. Australiaâs contribution â an emissions reduction target of 26-28Â per cent on 2005 levels by 2030 â is strong, responsible and achievable.</p>
<p>Through actions such as these, the 46th Pacific Islands Forum has advanced the goal of a safer, stronger and more prosperous Pacific.</p>
