PRIAE MINISTER OF AUSTRALIA fRIDAY, 25TH NOVEMBER, 1977<br />
The Prime Minister today commented on representations<br />
made by Service Station proprietors concerning pioblems in the<br />
petrol market. The Service cation proprietors have discribed how<br />
they are facing price discrimination and the serious problem<br />
it is causing them.<br />
The Prime Minister commented that he had real<br />
sympathy fur the members of the industry and for this reason<br />
the Government had recently set up an Oil Industry Marketing<br />
Consultative Committee to explore the means by which the<br />
problems can be overcome.<br />
He mentioned that the Fourth Report of the Royal<br />
Commission on Petroleum had made certain recommendations to<br />
relieve the problems but its recommendations had raised some<br />
difficult questions including those relating to Commonwealth-<br />
State powers. However, Mr. Fraser said that as soon as possible<br />
after the next meeting of the Consultative Committee, scheduled<br />
for mid December, he would take steps to bring together<br />
suppliers and retailers in conference under the auspices of<br />
the Government to examine with the industry how more<br />
equitable distribution and marketing policies could be<br />
developed. The Government wished to relieve distributors of<br />
the burdens that have rpcently been placed on them. </p>
