AUSTVLI( 7<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 28 APRIL 1978<br />
SYDNEY CHAMBER OF COMMERCE LUNCHEON<br />
I am glad to be able to address today such a broad crosssection<br />
of the New South Wales business community. I<br />
attach great importance to regular communication between<br />
Government and business. The genuine exchange of views<br />
can remove misunderstandings, and help towards finding<br />
solutions to the problems which confront us all.<br />
Of course, communication today is itself a major industry<br />
whose output is prodigious and where persuasion, pursuit<br />
of special interests and over-simplification as well as<br />
the telling of the plain truth form part of that output.<br />
It is prudent to keep this always in mind for in econimic<br />
matters in particular, the truth is rarely simple.<br />
I want to speak to you today about economic policies in<br />
Australia and the rest of the world. Let me begin with the<br />
world economy, a topic very much in the minds of all Government<br />
leaders at the moment and the subject of my discussions in<br />
Japan last week with Prime Minister Fukuda and his ministers.<br />
Over the past year or so, increasing concern has been expressed<br />
throughout the world about the sluggish growth of the world<br />
economy and world trade. Faster world growth is clearly<br />
necessary if the global problems of under-utilization of<br />
resources and high unemployment, especially amongst the young,<br />
are to be overcome.<br />
The great difficulty which faces all national governments is<br />
how best to achieve this result without rekindling inflation.<br />
Various solutions have been put forward in the past year, many<br />
with somewhat colourful titles.<br />
There was the " Locomotive" theory, whereby the powerful " Motor"<br />
economies of the United States, West Germany and Japan would<br />
pull the economic carriages of the rest of the world on to<br />
the growth track. ./ 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
This theory had its attractions, but it also had some serious<br />
drawbacks, for it could be taken as encouraging governments<br />
of the weaker economies simply to sit back and wait for the<br />
locomotive to begin pulling. This was, and remains, a false<br />
hope. The weaker countries could only take advantage of the benefits<br />
which increased world growth might bring if they had effective<br />
anti-inflationary domestic policies in force. Without such<br />
domestic Policies, the increased world demand could merely<br />
result in higher inflation and thus negate any lasting benefit<br />
to the trading world: and in particular, preclude any significant<br />
decline in unemployment.<br />
In other words, the locomotive theory was of little use to those<br />
countries which had not yet completed necessary internal repair<br />
work on their own rolling stock. The " Locomotive" theory was<br />
then supplanted by the " Convoy" theory.<br />
Under this theory, a fleet of national economies, instead of<br />
just two or three, would set sail together from the recessionary<br />
harbour all mutually supporting each other. One difficulty<br />
with this approach is that the convoy ranges from battleships<br />
to rather leaky dinghies, and like all convoys, the fleet can<br />
only move as fast as its slowest member.<br />
Both these theories try to offer general solutions to what is<br />
an aggregate of particular national situations. In doing so,<br />
they do not seem to take full account of the complexity of the<br />
world economy. For example, we are all aware that the health<br />
of the world economy depends greatly upon the health of the<br />
U. S. economy; but that does not mean that the U. S. should<br />
try to pull others out of recession if by so'doing its domestic<br />
economy would be impaired.<br />
Recent fluctuations in the value of the U. S. dollar have brought<br />
home rather sharply the point that the U. S. must correct certain<br />
basic imbalances within its own economy if it is to avoid<br />
being a source of instability for the world rather than an engine<br />
of sustained recovery.<br />
In an important speech earlier this month, President Carter<br />
re-affirmed the danger which resurgent inflation presents to<br />
the U. S. economy, and thereby to the world. Australia cannot:<br />
ignore the effects of developments overseas. At the same time,<br />
we must avoid the error of seeing " overseas" as some sort of<br />
homogenous entity to which some single remedy can be applied.,<br />
The truth is very different. Out there, there are a multitude<br />
of countries, all of which are struggling with their own<br />
problems, many of them rather similar to our own.<br />
The ability of each country to join in the " Convoy" on any<br />
lasting basis will be determined by the quality of its domestic<br />
economic performance in beating down inflation; in restoring<br />
the probitability of new investments; in bringing Government<br />
finances and the growth of money supply under control. </p>
<p>-3-<br />
In short, the first task for each country is to pursue with<br />
steadiness and determination the re-establishment of these<br />
fundamental pre-conditions for future growth of its own economy.<br />
As these pre-conditions are attained, cautious expansionary<br />
policies can then be pursued without consequent damaging<br />
increases in inflation.<br />
Some of the stronger economies have reached this position, and<br />
West Germany and Japan in particular are now pursuing moderate<br />
expansionary policies.<br />
In Australia too, our successes ' in reducing inflation and<br />
overcoming some of the imbalances which had been created in our<br />
economy have enabled the government to undertake a moderate<br />
expansionary initiative, not through inflated government spending<br />
but through the less inflationary course of cuts in personal<br />
income tax which were recently introduced.<br />
One implication of what I am saying is that there needs to be in<br />
the industrialized economies a greater readiness to take a<br />
medium-term view of the policy formation process, to lay down<br />
policies accordingly and to stick with them as, slowly, they<br />
begin to put things right.<br />
We have tried to follow that course since late 1975 I think<br />
with some success. And I acknowledge in that regard the increasing<br />
support we have received from the business community in doing so<br />
as it has come to be recognized that there are today no simple<br />
and speedy solutions to the fundamental imbalances with which<br />
our economy is still beset.<br />
Yet there is still a tendency to react or over-react to every<br />
new set of statistics, to look for crises where none exists and to<br />
inflate even quite small problems to the status of national<br />
events which, it is then suggested, should be accommodated by way<br />
of some policy change or other.<br />
What we should be paying attention to, are the fundamentals which<br />
underlie our economic situation and which, if not put right, will<br />
continue to debar us from any lasting progress.<br />
Let me be a little more specific, and in doing so try to set<br />
Australia's problems within the broader framework of the<br />
world's economy.<br />
I place Australia's own problems first in that categorisation<br />
because the plain truth is that Australia's overall economic<br />
welfare depends first and foremost upon our own efforts. Only<br />
Australians can correct the results of past mistakes most of which<br />
were made here in Australia.<br />
I am assisted in this task by being able to refer, very topically,<br />
to a survey of the Australian economy which was released last<br />
night by the Paris-based organisation for Economic Cooperation<br />
and Development. </p>
<p>The OECD, as it is called, undertakes regular surveys of the<br />
economies of all its 24 member countries. I commend the<br />
close and careful scrutiny of our own economy and its problems<br />
which is contained in the survey. Though I must say that I do not<br />
share all the views expressed in the survey's conclusions..<br />
If the survey has a single theme, it is to point out the economic<br />
constraints under which the Australian economy in company with<br />
many others is still labouring and which do of course limit the<br />
policy options open to a responsible government in such circumstances.<br />
Indeed, the OECD discusses at s ome length the distortions under<br />
which the Australian economy has been operating for some years now,<br />
and it concludes that " The Australian economy is still undergoing<br />
a process of glow cyclical recovery and gradual adjustment of<br />
some of the major imbalances which developed in recent years". ( P. 44).<br />
If I may digress for a moment, you will note that the OECD recognizes,<br />
as some commentators do not, that a recovery is in train in<br />
Australia. In commenting on our past experience the OECD report points out that:<br />
" Australia has suffered, in acute form, two problems common to<br />
many OECD countries: rapid inflation and'an increase in real wages<br />
well in excess of productivity". ( P. 44).<br />
Furthermore, the OECD observes that, unlike many other countries<br />
the immediate cause of these problems in Australia was not:<br />
" The import price rise for oil and other raw materials but a<br />
domestic wage explosion". ( P. 44).<br />
The survey points out that, as a result of this largely self-inflicted<br />
wound, Australia saw: "' the emergence of some of the classic<br />
symptoms of real wage imbalance deterioration of employment and<br />
investment beyond what can be explained by the weakness in activity,<br />
weak balance of payments despite low levels of capacity utilisation,<br />
and greatly accelerated capital/ labour substitution". ( P. 44).<br />
How, you might ask, does a country get out of such a mess? The<br />
OECD survey goes to some trouble to analyse how we got into the mess,<br />
and the clear conclusion that it reaches is that the only way to<br />
get out of it to achieve economic recovery is by going through<br />
the rather painful process of correcting past mistakes and<br />
restoring those basic economic relationships that I referred to<br />
earlier to a more sensible pattern.<br />
My own government has set out, from the beginning, to follow such<br />
a policy course and effect the fundamental repair job which was<br />
necessary. But there is still some way to go and we propose to<br />
maintain our steady course of policy while we get there.<br />
For example, we have achieved a real advance in reducing price<br />
inflation to the point where our performance is now broadly in line<br />
with the OECD average. The March Quarter Consumer Price Index<br />
issued on Wednesday of this week showed that over the past twelve<br />
months the index has risen by 8.2 per cent. Over the first three<br />
quarters of this financial year the index has risen at an annual<br />
rate of 7.7 per cent. </p>
<p>I make no bones about saying that these are still high figures,<br />
but can any fair-minded observer deny that, by comparison with the<br />
state of our affairs a bare two years ago, they are again, to<br />
use the words of the OECD survey " an important achievement"?<br />
We have, however, had less success in dealing with perhaps the<br />
most fundamental distortion from which our economy is suffering<br />
and to which the OECD survey devotes a major part of its analysis,<br />
namely, a level of real wages that is " out of line" with the<br />
productivity of the labour involved. That distortion remains.<br />
Until it is removed and better corporate profitability is restored<br />
and inflationary expectations are entirely quenched the road to<br />
full economic recovery for Australia will continue to be difficult.<br />
That is why we have continually stressed, and will continue to stress,<br />
the need for the Arbitration Commission to play its part in<br />
restoring sanity to the wage determination process and reducing<br />
unemployment. We are keenly aware that our policies, or more correctly the past<br />
mistakes which those policies are designed to correct involve<br />
some continuing and heavy costs, costs which represent the payment<br />
for past errors.<br />
In this connection, the OECD survey mentions the high level of<br />
unemployment in Australia which is of such serious concern to<br />
all of us. The survey goes on to say that: " with a considerable<br />
part, but by.. no means all, of unemployment cyclical in nature there<br />
would on the face of it seem to be strong reasons to turn to more<br />
expansionary policies to try to alleviate the problem".<br />
Having, as it were, offered this tempting prospect of a quicker<br />
and easier path to recovery and reducing unemployment through<br />
measures such as pump-priming government spending the OECD then goes<br />
on to explain that the prospect is in fact a mirage.<br />
I quote: " It seems probable that such policies would indeed lead<br />
to some short-term expansion of output and reduction in unemployment,<br />
but that the net gains so achieved would be less over the longer run<br />
that what is likely to be achieved under policies broadly similar<br />
to those now being followed".<br />
In short, the superficially attractive path of providing an<br />
inflationary governmental " stimulus" to the Australian economy is<br />
seen on closer examination to be one of irresponsibility which no<br />
government with a view to the medium and longer-term welfare of the<br />
Australian people could countenance.<br />
The survey concludes that: maintenance of the present stance<br />
is broadly appropriate".<br />
There are many other sections of the OECD survey which bear<br />
quotation and I again commend it to you as a useful and objective<br />
contribution to the economic debate in Australia.<br />
On the whole, it reaches the same conclusions as those long held<br />
by my own government, namely that there is no instant, packaged<br />
solution to the economic problems to which past mistakes have<br />
given rise. </p>
<p>-6-<br />
What is required is a continuing and unremitting attention<br />
to the basic imbalances which still persist in our economy which<br />
must be put right if Australia is to enjoy the future which<br />
her resources offer her and to which her people, given resolution,<br />
good sense, and firm leadership, could reasonably expect to be<br />
entitled. If these qualities are forthcoming, the decade ahead of us will<br />
make the dark years in the 1970' s seem merely like a bad dream.<br />
The job is up to us all. 000---</p>
