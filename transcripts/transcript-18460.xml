South Australia has become the third state to sign up to tougher regulations for future coal seam gas and large coal mining projects.</p>
<p>SA has signed up to the Gillard Government's National Partnership Agreement on Coal Seam Gas and Large Coal Mining.</p>
<p>This means all environmental approvals and licensing developments for coal seam gas and large coal mining developments in South Australia will be based on rigorous scientific evidence.</p>
<p>The National Partnership Agreement specifies $150 million for a new Independent Expert Scientific Committee, to:</p>
<p> * 	Provide governments with expert scientific advice on CSG and large coal mining development proposals that are likely to have a significant impact on water resources;<br />
 * 	Commission public research and bioregional assessments in areas of high CSG and/or large coal mining developments in order to improve scientific knowledge and understanding of the impacts of these developments, both in specific locations and on water resources more broadly; and<br />
 * 	Make public its advice and the findings of all research undertaken.</p>
<p>The Agreement strengthens the regulation of CSG and large coal mining developments that may have an impact on water resources.</p>
<p>Coal seam gas and coal can bring huge opportunities  -  both in investment and job creation - but it is important to maintain community confidence in these developments.</p>
<p>The new Committee will fill the gaps in scientific understanding about the impacts of these developments, and underpin the safe and reliable expansion of the industry.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister wrote to the Premiers of NSW, Qld, Vic, SA and the Chief Minister of the NT in November asking them to sign on to the Agreement.</p>
<p>The Queensland Government signed up to the Agreement on February 14, followed by the NSW Government on March 7.</p>
<p>The Government will continue to work cooperatively with other states and territories. </p>
