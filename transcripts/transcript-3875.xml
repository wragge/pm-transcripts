PRIME MINISTER Press Statement No. 551<br />
2 September 1975<br />
VIETNAMESE REFUGEES<br />
The Australian Government has approved the entry<br />
into Australia of 8 South Vietnamese refugees who are on<br />
board a Japanese ship, the Kenkai Maru, which is due to<br />
reach Brisbane tomorrow.<br />
The decision was taken in response to a request<br />
from the Australian representative of the United Nations<br />
High Commissioner for Refugees ( UNHCR).<br />
The refugees 3 soldiers and 5 students were<br />
rescued by the Kenkai Maru off the coast of Vietnam. They<br />
were apparently refused permission to land in Bangkok when<br />
the ship called there. The ship's next port of call after<br />
Brisbane will be the North Vietnamese port of Haiphong.<br />
The 8 Vietnamese have been granted temporary<br />
residence in Australia. It is expected that eventually some<br />
of them,. may choose to travel to other countries for<br />
resettlement. CANBERR. A. C. T. </p>
