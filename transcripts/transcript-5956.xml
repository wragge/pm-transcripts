AUSTRALIAN ARCHIVES HEADQUARTERS<br />
The Conmmonwealth Government has decided that a headquarters<br />
building for the Australian Archives will be built in Canberra.<br />
The new Australian Archives Headquarters is estimated to cost<br />
more than $ 30 million and is to be located on a site adjacent<br />
to the National Library.<br />
The Government had decided that only a high quality buil1i. ng<br />
would be appropriate to serve the National Archives<br />
Headquarters in Canberra and cater properly for the research,<br />
cultural and social aspects of archival operations.<br />
On this site in the Parliamentary Triangle the National<br />
Archives Headquarters will join other buildings of great<br />
cultural and social significance the National Library,<br />
the Australian National Gallery and the High Court of Australia.<br />
The Government's decision was yet another example of its<br />
continuing commitment to the development of Australia's<br />
National Capital.<br />
The Commonwealth Government's public works building programnme<br />
for the National Capital totals a record $ 146 million this year<br />
and I am pleased that private enterprise is responding<br />
magnificently to our initiatives. Just three years ago the<br />
private enterprise building programme in Canberra was less<br />
than $ 30 million this year it could be as high as $ 70 million.<br />
The National Capital Development Commission has been authorised<br />
to commence design work in the current financial year. Modern<br />
archives were proving to be not just repositories of historic<br />
documents but places of great historical, artistic and<br />
cultural significance, and of particular benefit in the<br />
fields of eduation and tourism. This new project will further<br />
enhance the character of Australia's National Capital. </p>
