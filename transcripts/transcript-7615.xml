CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
COMMITTEE FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF AUSTRALIA<br />
SYDNEY 26 MAY 1989<br />
There are many reasons why it is a pleasure to be here<br />
today. Most immediately, it is a welcome duty for me to launch John<br />
Nieuwenhuysen's book Towards Freer Trade Between Nations.<br />
It is an important book on an important subject, and-having<br />
already expressed my endorsement for it in my Foreword to<br />
the book I appreciate this opportunity, which I shall take<br />
up shortly, to comment in greater detail on it.<br />
It is a pleasure also to be here to congratulate the<br />
Committee for Economic Development of Australia CEDA<br />
both for sponsoring the publication of this book and for<br />
hosting this conference. For many years CEDA has made an<br />
impressive contribution to the generation and discussion of<br />
ideas in domestic and international policy-making.<br />
By all reports, this conference has once again demonstrated<br />
CEDA's commitment to creating a more informed public debate<br />
on the key issues we face at the close of the 1980s.<br />
Most of all, however, I welcome this invitation to address<br />
you today because of the overwhelming importance of the<br />
issues you have been discussing for the past two days, and<br />
because of the constructive contribution Australia is making<br />
to the development and resolution of those views.<br />
The theme of this conference, The Pacific Era Your Future?<br />
poses a significant question.<br />
For a long period of Australia's history, most Australians<br />
would have believed their future lay with the region that<br />
gave us this nation its birth Europe, and most<br />
specifically, Great Britain.<br />
Today, the Australia-Europe relationship remains very<br />
strong, whether it is measured in economic, cultural,<br />
political or demographic terms. Indeed in a month's time I<br />
will be making a visit to France, Great Britain, Germany and<br />
Hungary, as well as the United States, in order to reaffirm<br />
and strengthen those ties. </p>
<p>But throughout this century, as Australia matured as an<br />
independent nation, the orientation of'our commercial and<br />
diplomatic activity has increasingly been towards the<br />
Asia-Pacific region.<br />
So much so, in fact, that today, any moderately well<br />
informed Australian, when confronted with your conference<br />
title, would edit it, remove the question mark, and make the<br />
affirmation: The Pacific Era Our Future.<br />
Of course our future lies with the immediate region.<br />
That has been apparent since, first, Japan and, then, other<br />
Asian economies sought Australian raw materials to fuel<br />
their growing industries in the decades following world war<br />
Two. It has become increasingly apparent as the consumer markets<br />
of Asia grow in sophistication and affluence, presenting<br />
immense opportunities to our manufacturers and service<br />
exporters. It has become increasingly apparent as Australian industry<br />
benefits from investment and imports from the Asian region,<br />
and as European investors come to appreciate the obvious<br />
advantages of Australia as their springboard into Asia.<br />
In 1987/ 88 Australia's trade with the Western Pacific region<br />
accounted for nearly half of our total trade, and this rises<br />
to two-thirds with the inclusion of North America.<br />
Around half of the total foreign investment in Australia<br />
originates from the Asia-Pacific region, and almost 60% of<br />
Australia's overseas investment is located in the region.<br />
Eight of Australia's top ten export markets are in the<br />
Asia-Pacific region: Japan, the United States, New Zealand,<br />
Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan, China and Singapore.<br />
The question is not, then, for an Australian: Does our<br />
future lie with the dynamism of the Pacific? It is: how<br />
best do we position ourselves, what actions do we need to<br />
take, to ensure the benefits of that enmeshment are obtained<br />
and not wasted?<br />
In the same way, as Dr Nieuwenhuysen's book recognises, the<br />
question is not: Is free trade an appropriate mechanism for<br />
building prosperity?<br />
That question is already answered. Just look at the<br />
astonishing growth of this region and you see a growth and a<br />
prosperity that was built, in the early post-war decades,<br />
through reliance on open and competitive trading policies<br />
especially those practiced in the United States.<br />
Already the Asia-Pacific region provides more than half of<br />
the world's economic output, with the outlook for further<br />
growth in that share, and accounts for more than one-third<br />
of world trade. </p>
<p>So the relevant question Dr Nieuwenhuysen's book asks is:<br />
how do we ensure the survival and reinforcement of the<br />
practice of free trade, so that we may continue along that<br />
path of prosperity?<br />
To bring these two sets of questions together the nature<br />
of our Pacific future and the importance of trade I note<br />
that conferences such as this are likely to dwell in glowing<br />
terms on the glorious future that awaits us in what is<br />
referred to as " the Pacific Century".<br />
That is good as far as it goes. But the real issue and<br />
very much the harder issue is ensuring that those glowing<br />
predictions are achieved.<br />
How do we usher in the Pacific Century? Surely, through<br />
free trade. Because surely, the health and vitality of<br />
world trade underpins our capacity to provide better living<br />
standards for ordinary men and women in our region and,<br />
indeed, around the globe.<br />
This is of course the theme of Dr Nieuwenhuysen's book. one<br />
of his contributors put it nicely: trade is not a war won<br />
by running a trade surplus and lost by having a trade<br />
deficit. Another adds: trade is a positive sum game in<br />
which all the participants benefit.<br />
The implication is clear. Those who impose restrictions on<br />
trade certainly harm their trading partners, and they damage<br />
the overall trading system but they also delude, and harm,<br />
themselves. So the message of Dr Nieuwenhuysen's book is that<br />
progressively moving towards a free and open international<br />
trading system will contribute to greater prosperity and<br />
stability in the world economy.<br />
Despite the validity of this argument in a scholarly sense,<br />
however, there are too many disturbing trends in the global<br />
market place to be confident that this truth is being<br />
universally understood or acted upon.<br />
Let me enumerate them.<br />
First, the continuing presence of significant trade<br />
imbalances between a number of regional countries and the<br />
United States continues to be associated with bilateral<br />
pressures to open markets in a manner which discriminates<br />
against efficient exporters.<br />
Second, we are faced with a trend towards the formation of<br />
bilateral or regional trading arrangements which run the<br />
risk of being inward-looking and undermining a truly<br />
multilateral international trading system.<br />
Third, fundamental tensions continue to exist within the<br />
GATT framework of multilateral trade rules, despite the<br />
recent resolution of the Montreal mid-term Review of the<br />
Uruguay Round. </p>
<p>I hope this book will be widely and fully read, so I am<br />
loath to suggest to potential readers that they should<br />
consider taking any short cuts. But I do recommend in<br />
particular Dr Nieuwenhuysen's summary of its themes, which<br />
includes a valuable distillation of five proposals for<br />
action necessary to-achieve freer trade.<br />
He outlines these needs:<br />
The need for greater transparency in the nature and cost of<br />
protection; the need to open up agricultural trade; the need<br />
for a timetable for ensuring application of GATT rules; the<br />
need to understand and address the costs incurred by some in<br />
the process of adjusting to change; and, finally, the need<br />
to combat protectionism by a persistent effort to reveal and<br />
promote the advantages of free trade.<br />
In regard to this fifth point, of course, this book itself<br />
will play a very prominent role.<br />
All these five points are forceful and practical steps<br />
forward. Each is reflected in the decisions Australians<br />
have made in recent years to ensure our more competitive<br />
participation in world trade.<br />
Australia of course has been a trading nation for most of<br />
its two hundred year history. within only two decades of<br />
the arrival of the First Fleet here in Sydney in 1788<br />
Australia exported its first wool clip to Europe.<br />
The problem of course was not that we found export difficult<br />
or markets elusive. For most of our history we found it<br />
easy to build high living standards on the basis of<br />
exporting a range of commodities to an eagerly waiting<br />
world. Our mistake was to pretend, as we did as late as the 1950s<br />
and 1960s, that we could go on like this ad infinitum, and<br />
that we could therefore shirk the more difficult task of<br />
building an export capacity beyond primary production.<br />
The debate between free traders and protectionists in<br />
Australia dates back to before the Federation of the<br />
Australian colonies in 1901. Progressively, and<br />
comprehensively for most of the four decades since the<br />
Second world war, this debate was won by the protectionists.<br />
The challenge of manufactured exporting was avoided; we<br />
built instead a range of weak, inefficient manufacturers<br />
catering for our small domestic market, supplemented where<br />
necessary by imports of higher technology equipment.<br />
The crash, when it came, was rough. In 1985/ 86 it was<br />
brought home very forcefully to Australians that the world<br />
did not have infinite willingness to support our living<br />
standards through high commodity prices. our decades of<br />
protectionist industry policy meant that we had very little<br />
to offer the world beyond the traditional staples produced<br />
on our farms and in our mines. </p>
<p>It has been an overwhelming priority of my Government since<br />
1983 to diversify our export regime so as to remedy those<br />
profound traditional vulnerabilities of the Australian<br />
economy. This required the most dramatic restructuring of the<br />
domestic economy, as well as a concerted effort in our<br />
diplomacy to create a more export oriented, competitive,<br />
efficient, diverse, open and productive Australian economy<br />
and to ensure a world trading system in which the fruits of<br />
those reforms, our exports, could compete on fair terms.<br />
Maintaining our prosperity will require the development of a<br />
domestic economy adequately equipped to take advantage of<br />
international and regional economic growth, and it will<br />
require access to international markets.<br />
So, profound changes have been underway in the Australian<br />
economy since 1983.<br />
We have implemented policies designed to encourage a more<br />
open, flexible and responsive industry structure one which<br />
is capable of investment and growth not only in the domestic<br />
market but also as a base for involvement in markets through<br />
the Asia-Pacific region and elsewhere in the world.<br />
We have sought to internationalise the Australian economy<br />
through actions such as floating the Australian dollar and<br />
deregulating the financial sector.<br />
Changes introduced in 1988 will reduce the level of tariff<br />
protection afforded to Australian manufacturing industry by<br />
around 30% and our primary industries have been made more<br />
responsive to changes in the international market place. We<br />
have plans in place to reduce substantially over time the<br />
protection afforded Australia's textile, clothing and<br />
footwear and passenger motor vehicle industries. Such<br />
reforms are designed to encourage international<br />
competitiveness, and to reduce the burden that protectionist<br />
policies place on Australia's exporters.<br />
The consensus approach to industrial relations, which has<br />
been a central feature of the relationship between my<br />
Government, industry and workers, has resulted in<br />
significant real wage restraint, major and genuine<br />
restructuring of employment awards, and a marked improvement<br />
in the industrial relations climate in Australia.<br />
Since 1986, Australia's foreign investment policy has been<br />
essentially an open-door approach which welcomes<br />
constructive and mutually beneficial investment into the<br />
Australian economy. Foreign investment guidelines are<br />
essentially open and transparent, with few restrictions.<br />
Last year we announced a major overhaul of the corporate<br />
taxation system, with corporate tax rates being reduced from<br />
49 to 39 per cent. This, coupled with the tax imputation of<br />
dividends, provides a favourable environment for business<br />
investment. </p>
<p>All of these changes have created considerable opportunities<br />
for Australian companies and also for foreign companies<br />
based in Australia which seek access to the Asia-Pacific<br />
market. International companies have set up business in<br />
Australia to capitalise on the opportunities that abound<br />
here and in the region, recognising that we are now an<br />
effective and competitive springboard into the Asia-Pacific<br />
market. You will no doubt be aware of concerns at present about the<br />
way in which Australia's excessive demand is fuelling a<br />
serious balance of payments deficit. This is not the place<br />
to enter into a lengthy discussion of Australia's economic<br />
situation.<br />
But I do say this: don't let these admitted short-term<br />
difficulties colour your judgement of the fundamental and<br />
enduring reforms that have been undertaken in this country.<br />
Australians have their eyes on the long-term future, and<br />
thanks to the fact'that our underlying economic problems are<br />
being effectively addressed, as never before, gives us<br />
confidence that we will be playing a very significant role<br />
in this region into that future.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
The effectiveness of these domestic reforms would be<br />
substantially reduced if the rules of open international<br />
trade were to be abandoned or flouted by the major<br />
economies. So it has been a major priority of our diplomacy to pursue,<br />
at the bilateral, regional and multilateral levels, policies<br />
which will encourage greater openness in the economies of<br />
our current and potential trading partners.<br />
In particular, we have taken a close and active interest in<br />
the Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations. We<br />
fought successfully for the inclusion of agriculture in the<br />
GATT round so as to bring pressure to bear on the massively<br />
protectionist policies of the major economies, particularly<br />
Europe's C. A. P.<br />
Through the Cairns Group of Fair Agricultural Traders,<br />
formed in August 1986, we have successfully worked to create<br />
a powerful third force in the negotiations. The recent<br />
decision in Geneva provided a significant breakthrough at<br />
the half-way mark of the current Round but we recognise<br />
too that there is a long way to go before the absurdities<br />
and inefficiencies of the C. A. P. are eliminated.<br />
We are also pressing for significant reductions in<br />
protectionism in other sectors, including natural resource<br />
based products and the new areas of services and<br />
intellectual property rights. </p>
<p>In our bilateral dealings with all countries we take the<br />
opportunity to urge our partners to remove or reduce trade<br />
barriers that invariably exist. Last year we reached an<br />
agreement with Japan to liberalise significantly their beef<br />
market, and helped to convince the Americans to amend some<br />
of the more damaging measures originally proposed for their<br />
1988 Trade Bill.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
What is particularly important is that we combat any<br />
emergence of restrictive trading blocs, be it in Europe<br />
post-1992, in North America, or elsewhere.<br />
As a region, we must employ what means we have at our<br />
disposal to ensure that the international trading system<br />
does not fragment into exclusive zones.<br />
That would be ultimately to the cost of us all.<br />
It was in part to harness the region's efforts to prevent<br />
such an outcome that earlier this year, as part of an<br />
official visit I paid to the Republic of Korea, I proposed<br />
the establishment of a new and more formal vehicle through<br />
which the governments of the region could cooperate in the<br />
analysis and discussion of key economic and trade issues<br />
facing us.<br />
I see the primary task of such regional cooperation as being<br />
the reinforcement of support for an open, non-discriminatory<br />
international trading system operating within an expanded<br />
and strengthened GATT formula.<br />
That is a goal the nations of this region broadly share and<br />
towards which we are already working. Collective action,<br />
through strength in numbers, should help us achieve it.<br />
Second, I see the need for the region to investigate the<br />
scope for further dismantling of barriers to trade within<br />
the region, in ways which do not discriminate against the<br />
rest of the world.<br />
Third, closer regional cooperation would be a valuable means<br />
of identifying the broad economic interests we have in<br />
common. We need to investigate whether, through improved<br />
policy coordination, we might better capitalise on the<br />
extraordinary complementarity of the economies of our region<br />
and so stimulate even greater economic activity within the<br />
Asia-Pacific.<br />
Our region, of course, contains a very diverse set of<br />
countries,. at different stages of economic development, and<br />
with quite different social and political systems. To<br />
respect these differences and still achieve our common goals<br />
is a challenge that will require close consultation and a<br />
mutual commitment to achieving consensus. </p>
<p>As a guiding principle for participation we believe the key<br />
criteria must be the extent to which countries have economic<br />
linkages with the region and their willingness to contribute<br />
meaningfully to regional economic cooperation.<br />
Recently, my special envoy, Richard Woolcott, the Secretary<br />
of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, has been<br />
visiting the capitals of the Western Pacific region to<br />
pursue this proposal. So far the feedback we have received<br />
has been positive and encouraging.<br />
Australia began the initial soundings of regional views by<br />
focusing on ten countries in the Western Pacific, the ASEAN<br />
nations, Japan, the Republic of Korea, New Zealand and<br />
Australia. This was not an attempt to exclude any country<br />
but it did represent the realistic assessment that any broad<br />
process of economic cooperation in the region would need to<br />
involve these countries as the essential and minimum group.<br />
Subsequently, Mr Woolcott has visited China, Hong Kong and<br />
the United States, and will shortly visit Canada.<br />
In all of the countries consulted by Mr Woolcott, the<br />
principles underlying my proposals have been strongly<br />
endorsed. There is wide acceptance that our mutual economic interests<br />
would re -ceive a significant boost by developing a more<br />
effective vehicle for regional intergovernmental economic<br />
cooperation.<br />
Now more than ever, there is a regional desire to ensure the<br />
economic achievements of recent decades are built upon and<br />
extended a growing regional self-confidence and<br />
determination to ensure the pendulum swings towards, not<br />
away from, freer trade.<br />
There are many issues still to be worked out. These include<br />
questions of participation, the nature of any support<br />
structure to underpin greater economic cooperation between<br />
governments, and the relationship of any new vehicle to<br />
those that already exist.<br />
These are issues that Australia looks forward to addressing<br />
over the coming months with the countries of the region.<br />
I stress that we do not seek to create a vast new<br />
bureaucracy. That is in no-one's interests. Nor do we seek<br />
to derogate from the important role and functions of ASEAN,<br />
which continues to be a major political influence in<br />
Southeast Asia.<br />
PECC, too, has been an extremely useful institution which<br />
has built up the habit of multilateral dialogue and<br />
research. </p>
<p>But I believe it is now the time to extend that habit up to<br />
the governmental level throughout the region and so provide<br />
an additional, effective, means for advancing our region's<br />
concerns in the changing international economic environment.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
My address today has largely been cast in economic terms.<br />
Dollars and yen are critical, after all, in determining the<br />
prosperity of the peoples of our region.<br />
But it would be a profound mistake if we were to assume that<br />
we are dealing purely with issues of global economic<br />
management, or if we were to pretend that such issues do not<br />
have vital relevance to, and impact on, broader questions<br />
including the fundamental question of global peace and<br />
stability. In January 1987 I had the honour of delivering the opening<br />
address to the World Economic Forum's Symposium in Davos,<br />
Switzerland. I said then that if we were to learn anything from pre-war<br />
history it must be that the global conflict of the Second<br />
World War was in large measure the product of the failure of<br />
political leadership to recognise and adjust to the collapse<br />
of economic relationships between and within nations.<br />
The world paid a heavy price then for its incapacity to read<br />
and resolve the emerging economic autarky of the 1920s and<br />
1930s. But as horrendous as that price was, it would be as<br />
nothing compared to the consequences of conflict in this<br />
nuclear age.<br />
I warned on that occasion at Davos that commercial tensions<br />
in the 1980s among the developed industrial democracies<br />
and I was referring in particular to the debilitating<br />
dispute over trade in agricultural products would, if<br />
continued, considerably erode Western political and security<br />
relationships.<br />
That the process might be subtle and gradual, rather than<br />
sudden and dramatic, would make it no less pernicious and<br />
its ultimate consequences no less damaging.<br />
That was January 1987.<br />
Since then we have witnessed, over nearly thirty months, an<br />
astonishing political transformation a transformation that<br />
only heightens the relevance and sharpness of my warning.<br />
What we are seeing is nothing less than the emergence of a<br />
new era in world affairs. </p>
<p>At the level of superpower relations, including strategic<br />
nuclear arms control, and at the regional level in<br />
Afghanistan, Angola, and Cambodia, we are witnessing a new<br />
capacity for negotiation leading to sensible and farsighted<br />
solutions. In the massive programs of reform underway in the Soviet<br />
Union we are perhaps seeing the erosion of the command<br />
economy model and its replacement with a more responsive<br />
economy and a more open society.<br />
Throughout Eastern Europe we are seeing a diversity and<br />
acceptance of change unparalleled since the Iron Curtain was<br />
erected.<br />
What an irony it would be if, at the very time when the<br />
merits of the market economies are starting to be understood<br />
and emulated by these command economies, we market economies<br />
were to abandon the fundamental factor behind our success<br />
the principle of free trade.<br />
And what a tragedy it would be if the emerging signs of<br />
maturity in the conduct of political relations between<br />
nations were to be flouted and jeopardised by an incapacity<br />
satisfactorily to manage our economic relations.<br />
The fundamental truth is that we are all interdependent.<br />
The poverty or prosperity of one of us are questions that<br />
concern us all. They effect not only our own economic<br />
well-being but also, fundamentally, our political security<br />
and stability.<br />
As a region, we have much to offer each other. We have<br />
substantial shared political and economic interests, and a<br />
powerful complementarity in our economic skills, resources,<br />
and business, cultural and political links.<br />
The opportunity is now at hand to grasp the potential of our<br />
region.<br />
By working to liberalise multilateral trade, and by seeking<br />
to build regional cooperation, we are seeking to safeguard<br />
and enhance our future.<br />
That way, I believe, we can ensure that we enter the next<br />
century with confidence that our great potential will be<br />
fulfilled. </p>
