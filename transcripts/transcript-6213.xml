EMBARGOED UNTTIL DELIVERY<br />
8 P. M4. PERTH TI1ME 28 SEPTEMBER 1983<br />
THERE ARE CERTAIN RARE OCCASIONS IN A LIFETIME V01CH ARE<br />
MEMORABLE, VALUABLE, AND MOVING,<br />
rOR ME,. THIS IS SUCH AN OCCASION,<br />
I THANK THE UNIVER51TY LABOR CLUB DEEPLY FOR TH! S<br />
INVITATION WHICH ALLOWS ME4 ONCE AGAIN, HERE IN MIY HOME<br />
CITY AND UNIVERSITY, TO ADD MY TRIBUTE TO JOHN CURTIN,<br />
A GREAT LABOR LEADER AND A GREAT AUSTRALIAN.<br />
i BELIEVE DEEPLY THAT JOHN CURTIN'S LEADERSHIP STANDS NOT<br />
ONLY AS A SPLENDID EXAMPLE OF AUSTRALIAN STATESMAINSHIP<br />
AT ALL TIMES AND FOR ALL TIMES. 1UT IT ! S AN EXAMPLE OF<br />
SPECIAL RELEVANCE CONTEMPORaRY RELtVANCE AT THIS<br />
WATERSHED OF OUR NATION S HISTORY.<br />
AT THE NATIQNAL Ecorqomic SUM11, IT CONFERcNCE ON THE 11TH<br />
OF APRIL, QUOTED PART OF A SFEECH MADE IN THE HOUSE OF<br />
REPRESENTATIVES BY JOHN CURTIN ON THL 16' nq OF DECEMBER 1941.<br />
I t I </p>
<p>HE SAID: " OUR AUSTRALIAN MODE OF LIFE, OUR CONDITIuONII,' OURs<br />
SEASONS, ALL THAT GO TO MAKE UP TH5 NATURAL<br />
CONDITIONS Or-LIVING, MAI( E US BETTER EQUIP ; ED<br />
( FOR THE PURPOSE OF MEETING THIS CRISIS) ARE<br />
THE P5OPLES OF MANY OTHER COUNTR181ES THE<br />
QUALITATIVE CAPACITY OF OUR POPULATION Ct) P' NATES<br />
IN LARGE MEASURE FOR THE SHORTAGE OF OUR NUM' RS t<br />
li. LIKE EACH OF YOU,, HAVE SEEN THIS COUNTR~ Y AT<br />
WORK, ENGAGED IN PLEASURE., AND EXPERIENCING<br />
ADVERSITY; I HAVE SEr-N IT PAICE GOOD TIM1ES AND C'/ IL<br />
TIMES, BUT I HAVE NEVER KNvN A TIME IN ' XHI' H THE<br />
INHERENT QUALITY OF AUSTRALIA HAS TO BE USED 83<br />
UNSTINTINGLY AS AT THIS HOUR"<br />
ITHEN WENT ON TO SAY:<br />
" DO NOT PRETEND TO COMPARE TH1E SCALE OF THE C ISIS<br />
THROUGH WHICH JOHN CURTIN ISTEERED THIS NATION TO TRIUMPH<br />
WITH OUR TASK TODAY, BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT THE<br />
ELEMENTS WHICH JOHN CURTTN DEFINED AS THE KCY TO VICTORY<br />
ARE AS RELEVANT IN 193AS THEY WERE IN 1~"<br />
AND THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT WHATrSOEVE/ R T1AT THE OVERRIDING<br />
NEED) AS JOHN CURTIN -SAW ITj WAS TO EFFECT A NATIONAL<br />
RECONCILIATION ANO TO FORGE A NATIONAL CONSENSUS Q<br />
THE PROSECUTION' OP THE WAR EFFORT. p X i. </p>
<p>IT IS NOW SONMET4iMES FOrT N HOW DEEPLY DTVIDED<br />
A NATION AUSTRALIA WAS ON THE EVC OF WORLD WAR 11<br />
POLITICALLYj ECONOM[ CALLY, AND SOCtALLY. IHE EFFECTS<br />
OF THE 6REAT DEPRESSION WERE STILL AT WORKt<br />
CLASS AND SOCIAL DIVISIONS RAN DEEPI THL<br />
DIVIGIONS TN TR4E LABOR IOVEME* INT FOLLO-eltNG THE<br />
SPLIT OF 193 2 tD tY NO -AEANS HEALE,, AND THAT<br />
HEALJNG TASK WAS JOHN CURYMN'S FIRST PM! ORiTY<br />
AFTER NE WON THE LEADERSHIP Im 19356 s r </p>
<p>HE AL SO S4 lW HjA T ThF CONSERVAT IVES<br />
RFPR SENTED,; NOT A FORCE FOR UN" ITY,, BUT FOR DIVIS! ON'-<br />
AND Ht-SAW WITH EQU,: AL CLARITY THAT LABOR At-ONE COULD<br />
BUILD THE BASIS FOR ' CONCILIATION AND CONSENSUS,.<br />
AND HE SAW THAT THERE WAS NO BASIS 5OR HARMONY IN THE<br />
CLIMATE OF ACRIMONY WHICH-HAD BECOME, ENDC-MIC WITHIN THC<br />
CONSERVATIVE PARTIES, AND TO THE EXTENT THEY INrLUENCED<br />
THE NATION, WITHIN THE NATION IrsCLFL<br />
BUT HE ALSO RECOGNISED THAT, IN DEF-AULT OF THlE<br />
POSSIBILITY OF A GrNUiNE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT, NEW M'ACHINLERY<br />
WOULD HAVE TO BE ESTA13LISHEID AN D EXISTING MACHINERY<br />
STRENGTHENED IN-ORDER TO HARNESS TO THE NATIONAL EFFORTTH<br />
ENERGIES AND THE TAILENTS AND THlE PATRIOTISM OF ALL<br />
SECTIONS OF THE NATION, LABOR AND NON-LABOR ALIKEj<br />
INCLUDING REPRESENTATIVES OF CONSERVATISM) B~ OTH INSID<br />
AND OUTSIDE THE PARLIAMENIT,<br />
THAT IS WHY, IN OPPOSITION AND GCVERNMENT, HE; P! ACED SUCH<br />
EMPHASIS ON THE ADVISORY WAR COUNC1L. WHOSE ME1N1ERSHIP<br />
INCLVDED SUCH OLE) D POEY AS MENZIE$ s, FADDEN, ANP HUGHES.<br />
FURTHER, ALTHOUGH NO AUSTRALIAN LABOR LFAPER HAD MOR.<br />
INCISIVELYj, MOflE ELOQUENTLY OR FOR SO LONG, EXPOSED THE<br />
GROSS DE5iCIENCIES AND EXPLOITATION OF LAISSEZ-FAIRE<br />
CAPITALISMi, AS IT EXISTED IN THE PRE-WAR DECADES,, 0 1 is/. </p>
<p>CURI-N RECOONISED Til' PARA 10L) NT NEED TO SECUR~ E THE<br />
CO-CPERATIAON OF S$ Q, MADE NO APOLOGY iHATS(. 1EVLU-:<br />
FORi HARNESSING llF ABO'L. I AND LOYALTY OF GREAT CApTrAiNS<br />
01' INDUSTRY LIKE ESSIN4GTON-LEWIS AND W S. ROBINSON, TO<br />
tHE COMMON CAUSE -THE tAUS' OF AUSTRALIA ITSELF.<br />
BUT IN THEf SEARCH FOR ( CON$ ENSU:*( S -AND SOMETIMES' 3, IN THE<br />
STRUGGLE FOR CONSENSUS CUIRTIN NEVER LOST SIGHT OF THE<br />
LIMITS UPON CONSENSUS IN A FRFE AND DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY,<br />
NOk DID HE FAIL 1-O ACKN0' WkLC--GC TrHE LIMITS UPON CONS ENSUs<br />
WITHIN A Fk OPEN ANnT DLMOCRATIC PARTY LIKE THEAUSTRALIAN<br />
LABOR PARTY,<br />
AND INDEED IT MAY B3E SAID THAT, ! N 1' 1E FINAL ANALY81.3SJ<br />
FINES;' T ACHI VP. MLTNl W,, AS THE FORGING OF A CONSENSUS<br />
IN WAR-TIME, WITHOUT IMPAIRING THE FREEDOMS Or THE PARTY<br />
AND THE NATION.<br />
THE RECOGNITION OF THE LIMITS OF~ CONSE~ NSUS 8CCOMES.<br />
EVIDENT, IF ONE STUDIES THE SKI. LL, PERSEVERANCE ANDJr<br />
PERSUASIVENESS WITH WHHICH HE SECURED WITHIN THE LAB3OR PAR~ TY<br />
A CONSENSUS -BUT NONETHELESS A LIMITED CONSENSUS O<br />
THE NEED TO INTRODUCE CONSCRIPTION FOR MILITA-RY SERVICE O~ EL:<br />
IT WAS A STRUGGLE THAT PERHAPS BROKE HIS HEART., BUT<br />
CERTAINLY NEVER HISj SPIRIT, 1 4 1 </p>
<p>BUT IF ANYONE IN THu AUISTRALIAN4 LABOR PARTY Or OUTSIDE<br />
IT ASSERTS T1HAT HlIGH-NATIOINAL-OR PARTY INTEREST$ CAN NEYER<br />
ADMIT COMPROMISE, NOCT ON rLJNDA14ENTA. PRINC! PLES. BUT THE<br />
INMPLEMENTATION OF PRINCIPLESJ LET THEM PONDER THE EXAMP-LE<br />
OF JOHN CURTIN,<br />
BI-1-THE~ MO1ST IMPORTANT TRUTH Or-ALL ABOUT CURTIN AND<br />
CURTIN'rS LEADERSHIP, WA3 THAT EVCN IN THE DARKEST AND<br />
M~ OST DEMANDING DAYS Ot-TH4E WAR,. HE NEVEiR LOST SIGHT OF<br />
LABOR tS PEACETIME QB.. ECTIVES AT HOM1E AND A~ kOAD:<br />
DI~ D NOTC SEEK TO USIF TH-E CRISIS OF W'% AR AS AN ALIBI<br />
AGAINST RErORMs<br />
Am) IT 13 A DISTORTED PERCEPTION. OF THE PEFORMANC[-<br />
OF THE CURTIN IABOR GOVERNMENT FROM 19141 TO DIM TO SE<br />
ONLY IN TERMS OF WAR LEADERSHIP,, THE WAR EFFORT, OR<br />
MILITARY SURVIVAL AND MILITARY VICTORY.<br />
TiiE WInER TRUTH IS THAT CURTJN'S WAS A GREAT REFORM LABOR<br />
GOVERNMENTj NOT ONLY FOR ITS OWN ACHIEVEMENTS IN SOCIAL.<br />
RZEFORM, BUT POR rHF FOUNDATIONS I1T LAID FOR THE MASSIVE<br />
PROGRAM OF POST-WAR REHABILITATION AND RECONSTRUCTION, I:' ND E E<br />
THE DEPARTMENT OF POST-WAR IRECONSTRUCTION BECAME THE FOCAL<br />
POINT OF AUJSTRALIA'I S ADMINISTRATIVE TAL. ENT AND DEDICATION<br />
To THE TASK CF 13UILDING A MODERN NATION IN THE POST-WAR YEARS,<br />
CURTIN AND CHIPLEY TOGETHER SET IN TRAIN THE GREAT REFORM1<br />
PROGRAM BY WHICH THE CHIFLEY GOVERNMENT ITSELF<br />
TRANSFORlMED AUSTR~ ALIA, i, &amp; 7 </p>
<p>JNTERNATIONALLY, CUI T1 N REfISED THE FUNDAMcbENTAL CPU<br />
WH! Ci HAD OCCURED I N THE BAL/' ANCE OF IFORCES INi THE<br />
AND IN AUSTRALIA I S STRATEOIC SITUATIOW, 1 IN E OF h I<br />
GREATEST ACHIE\ VEMENTS WAS TO FORGE THE RFA_. ATJ0ON'sHiP WITH<br />

" AUSTRALIA TH ' d* 1AY AHEAD", </p>
<p>THE COURSE~ ON' WHICHi M1Y GOVERNMI: N-HAS EMBARKED<br />
IS ONE OF REFORM WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF AN ESSENTIAL<br />
CONTINUJITY IN AUSTRA" LIJAN TRADITIONS AND INSTFTUTIONS,<br />
LET ME EMPHIASISE AT THE OUTSET THAT TrHERE 1$ NOTHING<br />
CONSERVATIVE, NEGATIVE. o OR DEPEATis'T IN THIS RECOG. NIITION<br />
OF CERTAIN NECESS$ ARY ELEMENTS OF~ CONTINUITY IN CUR<br />
DE44OCRATIC SYSTEM,<br />
ON THE CONTRARY, PRUDENT RECOGNITION OF WHAT CAN Bi:<br />
PRESERVED AND CONTINUED IS THE BE$ T BASIS FOR AC-HIEVING<br />
THE TRANSITION FROM' A CONSERVATIVE ERA TO AN SERA OF REAL<br />
REFORM AND PROGRESOSJ ANtl THE BEST 5ASIS FOR ENSIURIN~ i THAT%*<br />
OUR~ REFORMS WILL ENDURE, AND WILL THEMSELIVES BL OTI4E<br />

AT THE SAME TIME, THE SHEER WEIGHT Or OUIR INHERITANC" E<br />
THE SIZE OF THE DI~ IIULT1ESi NOT ONLY BUT ESPECIALLY,<br />
THE ECONOMIC D) IFPICULTIES WE INHER! TEDi CAN NIEVER BE<br />
OVERSTATED, AND I DO NOT RCErR JUST TO THE LEGACY OF SEVEN YEAR0<br />
OF FRASER AND rRAS RISMo OR TO SPECIPIC MATTERS SUCH AS<br />
THE $ 9.6 BILLION DEFICIT WITH WHICH WE, WEkE CONFRONTED<br />
ON THE DAY WE TOOK OFFICE.<br />
IT GOES FAR I3EY0OND THAT. a IaI </p>
<p>I<br />
IN A VERY REAL SENSE, THE B. ACK;_ oG WqE HAVE IP4HEITEP,,<br />
THlE DEAD WEIGHT WE HAVE TO REMOVE FROM THIS NATIONj<br />
BACK.; NOT MERELY SEVEN YEARS, BUT NEARLY THIRTY--FIVE YEAR$,<br />
TO THE END OF THE CHIFLEY GOVERNMENT IN 19419<br />
IN ALMOST THIRTY-FIVE YEARS, LABOR HAS F0PRjeEJ FIEDCRAL<br />
GOVERNMICNTS FOR LESS THAN FOUR,<br />
THE REMARKABLE RESURGENCE OF LABOR THROUGHOUT AU-STfALIA.,<br />

ON THE 5TH OF MNARCH CANNO4T AT ONCVE CANCEL. OUT THE DEEPLY<br />
ROOTED LEGACY Or THIRTY YEARS AND MORE OF CO* NS~ kVAl'' vtE<br />

THE FIRST PART OF OUR TASK HAS fLELN TO ATTEMPT TO 11RIING<br />
A13OUT CHANGES IN ENTRENCHED ATTITUDES WHICH1 THEMSELVE3,,<br />
IF THEY PERSISTED WOULD PREVENT OR? RETARD THE SUCCE'[ SSFUL;<br />

WE HAVE RECOGNI. SED THAT ONLY AN AUSTRALIA UNITED AROUND<br />
GREAT NATIONAL GOALS OF PROVIDING ADPOUATELY FOR ALL<br />

DIV'IDED AUSTRALIA LIKE THE AUSTRALIA OF THF SEVEN YEARS<br />
AND FIVE MONTHS PRECEDING MY GOVERINMENT' S ACCEPTANCE OF<br />
OFrICE ON MARCH 11, IS DESTINED FOR THE SWAMPS AN) D SHALLOWS<br />
OF A STAGNANT ECONOMY, </p>
<p>WE HAVE ALSO REC06, NI SED A ONLY A LABOR GOVERNIMEN-T CAN<br />

FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF A SENSE OF NAlT ON! AL ' RU<br />

NEITHER DO WE LOSE SIGHT OF THE REALI FY TH4AT THE GREAT<br />
GOALS OF EQUITY IN THE DISTrnIRUTION O INCOME AND ~ Wl.<br />
AND OF NATIONAL RECONCILIATIONj WILL iB ~ TJ~ 3L-I THE<br />

SUSTAINING GROWTH IN THE VALUi. Or OUR NATIONAL PODIJCTIC! N<br />
OVER LONO PERIODSj IS PARI OtP OU-R PROGRAMME OF EQUITY<br />

PER'SONAL, NATUREj WHICH V4ORYED TO EXACERPBATE THEDV~ ia$<br />
OF THE TIME, I RErER PARTICULARLY TO THE AFT" EkkATH OF THIE<br />
CRISIS OF 1975, CULMI NATING IN THE INFAtIY1 O THE 11TH<br />
OF NOVEMBER, 195 IT IS CLEAR TIHAT THOSE EVCNTS RADICALLY<br />
CHANGED THE PERSPECI'IVES OF A SIGNIFICANT NliMnER OF<br />
AUSTRALIANS, FSPEC1ALLY IN THE LABOR MOVEME'NT, ABOUT THE<br />
NATURE, USEo AND ABUSE OF POWER IN OUR SYSTEM; AND DID<br />
INJECT AN ELEMENT OF CYNICISM INTO THE ATTITUDES OF iMANY<br />
OF THOSE WHO HAD HITHERTO 5EEN FOREMOST IN UPHOLDING<br />
THE SYSTEM.. AND MOST COMKMITYED TO MAKING IT WORK,<br />
INDEED, IT 13 TESTIMONY TO THE BASIC 5STR-ENGTK AND<br />
RESILIENCE OF THE AU$ TRALIAN LABOR PARTY, AND THE<br />
STRENGTH OF ITS CIMTMENT TO PARLIAMiLNTARY DEM~ OCRACY,<br />
