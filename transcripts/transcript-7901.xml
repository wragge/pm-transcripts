TRANSCRIPT OF STATEMENTS BY PRIME MINISTER HAWKE AND<br />
PRIME MINISTER RYZHKOV, PARLIAMENT HOUSE, 14 FEBRUARY<br />
1990<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
HAWKE: Ladies and gentlemen, I'll say a few words. My<br />
friend, the Soviet Prime Minister will then say a few<br />
words about our meeting and then we'll be available if<br />
you desire for questions for a while. The Soviet Prime<br />
Minister and I have had extensive discussions lasting for<br />
a couple of hours this morning and in those discussions<br />
we were able to cover the exciting developments in the<br />
Soviet Union, in the international sphere, and also the<br />
question of bilateral relationships between our two<br />
countries. Prime Minister Ryzhkov underlined the<br />
commitment of the leadership of his country to a<br />
continuation of the process of change in the political<br />
and economic spheres that are underway in the Soviet<br />
Union. And I told the Prime Minister that as far as<br />
Australia, the people, and the Government of Australia<br />
were concerned, that we wholeheartedly supported the<br />
changes that were taking place in the Soviet Union and<br />
Eastern Europe and that in Australia we wish to respond<br />
constructively to those changes and do whatever we can to<br />
assist. We discussed specific ways in which the<br />
bilateral relationship between our two countries could be<br />
expanded, especially in the economic area, and in<br />
addition to the interchange that the Prime Minister and I<br />
were able to have, that was supplemented significantly<br />
over lunch when we had the opportunity of being joined by<br />
a number of leaders of Australian business. I'm pleased<br />
to announce that we have agreed that there will be a high<br />
level visit to the Soviet Union later this year by<br />
Australian experts from both the private and the<br />
Government sectors who have experience, expertise in the<br />
area of food processing, handling and transportation and<br />
we believe between us that there is scope for significant<br />
cooperation in that area. Amongst the international<br />
issues that we covered was one of particular interest in<br />
our region, of developments in Cambodia and I'm very<br />
pleased to say with the Soviet Minister again in my<br />
presence, warmly welcomed the Australian initiative in<br />
regard to Cambodia and the attempts that we're making<br />
there to bringing about a resolution of the tragedy in<br />
that country. We also shared observations about general<br />
developments in the Asian Pacific region. Finally, in<br />
these introductory comments, let me say with a great deal<br />
of pleasure that the Prime Minister of the Soviet Union </p>
<p>indicated the support of the Soviets for the initiative<br />
that Australia has taken together with France in regard<br />
to the Antarctic.<br />
RYZHKOV: Ladies and gentlemen, it is my second day on<br />
this visit to Australia and it is the first time ever<br />
that a Head of a Soviet Government is visiting Australia<br />
since the time diplomatic relations were established<br />
between our two countries. Yesterday I had some scenes<br />
in Melbourne and early in the day we had some official<br />
formal ceremony and also a very exciting discussion with<br />
Prime Minister, Mr Hawke. Among the major issues that we<br />
discussed and as I understand that issue is of major<br />
concern to the Prime Minister is the problem, the actual<br />
internal situation in the Soviet Union. I tried to be as<br />
detailed as possible in providing a description of the<br />
positive and negative aspects of that current situation<br />
in the Soviet Union. the discussion was on the subject<br />
of economic situation, the situation of the Party, the<br />
inter-ethnic relationship. It is my hope that the<br />
information I was able to provide to the Prime Minister<br />
will enable him to take a more objective look of the<br />
situation in our country. It is our feeling that we're<br />
going to complicated period in our reform process and<br />
in other words that we have come to a point that we have<br />
to implement fully the reforms that we outlined in the<br />
past. We know that we have to go through that difficult<br />
period. We also discussed some international issues and<br />
as the Prime Minister just said, this above all was the<br />
conflict in Kampuchea. We support the initiatives that<br />
were put forward by Australia on the Cambodian conflict,<br />
especially whether it's to involvement by the United<br />
Nations in that process. We also touched upon several<br />
bilateral issues and it is also appealing that our<br />
additional discussions that we had with members of the<br />
Australian business community and the plenary sessions<br />
that we're going to have later in the day will provide an<br />
opportunity for a more detailed discussion of those<br />
issues. It is our feeling that in the area of bilateral<br />
relationship we have good prospects. I'm very much<br />
satisfied with the course of this visit. Everywhere I<br />
went I felt kind attention and attitude and I felt<br />
sincere kindness coming from those officials Australian<br />
officials that had to organise my visit here. We met<br />
and we know each other, Prime Minister Mr Hawke, for some<br />
time. People in our country have good memories of this<br />
visit that he made to our country late in 1987 so we met<br />
again here as good old friends. I thank you for your<br />
attention.<br />
HAWKE: OK, are there any questions?<br />
JOURNALIST: ( Question not translated)<br />
RYZHKOV: We are working on a number of proposals<br />
covering further development of bilateral economic<br />
relationship. It is our view that we have come very<br />
close to completion of a project on a joint venture in </p>
<p>the production of aluminium. We also engaged in<br />
negotiations on geological exploration and prospecting<br />
and these are some of the non traditional trade and<br />
economic relationship that we have established in the<br />
past. We also discussed with the Prime Minister the<br />
issue of fishing. It would appear that there are many<br />
interesting suggestions in that regard, but the<br />
Australian side will have to give another thought to what<br />
we have suggested. We would hope that the suggestions<br />
that we have made would be of mutual benefit both to<br />
Australia and the Soviet Union. Tomorrow we intend to<br />
continue country discussion of that issue.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Prime Minister, could you tell us your<br />
feeling about this discovering Australia and you said<br />
before that you and Prime Minister Hawke know each other<br />
quite well for quite some time, but this is a first visit<br />
and this is a sort of a discovery of Australia.<br />
What's your feeling on that?<br />
RYZHKOV: I feel strongly that visit Prime Minister Hawke<br />
made to Moscow late in 1987 provided a very powerful<br />
impetus to our bilateral relationship and that is not<br />
meant as a compliment or as a flattering remark, but this<br />
is indeed what the actual situation is. And, as I said<br />
this morning, I also pledged that my current visit go<br />
beyond the bounds of protocol function and also lay<br />
down another stone in the foundation of our bilateral<br />
relationship. If we are successful in accomplishing this<br />
target then our mission will have been completed, but of<br />
course this is a discovering a new, for me this is<br />
discovering of new of this country and I see a lot of<br />
prospects and opportunities for expanded cooperation.<br />
And what happens most is the attitudes on the part of<br />
the Government to further developments of relations<br />
with the Soviet Union to building trust and confidence<br />
and trust is the most important thing because that is the<br />
foundation for any further development of relations and<br />
this is what we have been feeling most strongly. Trust<br />
and confidence coming from the Government of Australia.<br />
JOURNALIST: Would the Soviet Prime Minister tell us<br />
whether the future of the Soviet base at Cam-Ranh Bay was<br />
discussed? And if it was discussed, what was said and if<br />
it was not discussed, what are the intentions of the<br />
Soviet Union<br />
JOURNALIST: From the outset I could tell that we did not<br />
discuss that issue. On the base I can tell you the<br />
following. Basically you may be aware of the overall<br />
Soviet position which is in favour of dismantling foreign<br />
bases in and that would apply to Soviet, US and bases<br />
of other countries wherever they may be found. On the<br />
Cam-Ranh base, following the request of the Vietnamese<br />
Government, we are based there only one squadron, that is<br />
five to six aircraft, no more.<br />
