EXCHANGE PROGRAM FOR YOUNG POLITICAL LEADERS<br />
An Interim Committee representing all Parties has been<br />
formed to develop exchange visits by young people in politics<br />
between Australia and other countries.<br />
The Committee will seek to establish an early exchange program<br />
with the American Council for Young Political Leaders ( ACYPL),<br />
The ACYPL is. a bipartisan non-profit organisation which operates<br />
a number of programs, including exchange programs aimed at the<br />
development of an understanding of international affairs in<br />
young American political leaders and at providing insight into<br />
the American political process to young leaders from other countries.<br />
The Committee will also make suggestions to Party Leaders on an<br />
appropriate form and functions for a permanent body to establish<br />
future programs with the United States and, it is hoped, with<br />
other countries.<br />
It is envisaged that the exchanges could involve people in<br />
local government, members of party organisations, union leaders<br />
and others involved in the political process as well. as State<br />
and Federal parliamentarians.<br />
With the agreement of all Party Leaders, the Hon. Sir Robert<br />
Cotton has been appointed to chair the Interim Committee.<br />
Until recently, Sir Robert served as Australian Consul-General<br />
in New York following his earlier career in public life. in<br />
Australia. The other members of the Committee are:<br />
Nominated by<br />
Mr A G Cadman, MP The Prime Minister<br />
Mr T Eggleton, CVO The Prime Minister<br />
Mr A J MacKenzie, MP Mr Anthony<br />
Senator the Hon.<br />
Douglas McClelland Leader of the Opposition<br />
Mr R McMullen Leader of the Opposition<br />
Mr S SpindlerSenator chipp </p>

The f * uture ofE this country depends in good part on the quality,<br />
knowledge and understanding of young people entering public<br />
life. The proposed exchange scheme will provide these people<br />
with opportuniities to gain valuable experience and understanding<br />
through visits to countries of relev'ance to Australia's place<br />
in the world. The scheme will also facilitate visits to<br />
Australia by young leaders of other countries.<br />
