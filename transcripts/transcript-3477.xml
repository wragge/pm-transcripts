THE MINISTRY<br />
After calling on the Governor-General, who<br />
returned to Canberra today, the Prime Minister announced<br />
that the Deputy Prime Minister, Dr J. F. Cairns, had agreed<br />
to become Treasurer and Mr Frank Crean to become Minister<br />
for Overseas Trade.<br />
Because of the legislation before Parliament for<br />
which they were responsible, the ministers would be sworn<br />
into their new portfolios at the end of the present session.<br />
The announcement was being made at the present<br />
time because the Governor-General felt that this was the<br />
appropriate course in all the circumstances.<br />
