    <content><![CDATA[<p>Australian farmers suffering through the crippling drought will be able to access greater government assistance sooner as part of a $320 million comprehensive drought support package.</p>
<p>The Government will bring forward more generous income support arrangements for farmers and their families; extend concessional loans to eligible drought affected farm businesses; provide funds for water infrastructure and pest eradication; as well as funds for counselling support services for farmers.</p>
<p>Farming is a very significant part of our economy and will play a critical role in our economic future. This is a government determined to stand by the people of Australia in good times and bad.</p>
<p>As part of the package:</p>
<ul><li>More generous criteria for accessing income support will be made available to farmers from 3 March 2014 instead of 1 July 2014.</li>
<li>Drought Concessional Loans totalling $280 million will be allocated to give eligible farm businesses the resources to recover from the effects of drought.</li>
<li>To assist drought affected farms to access water, $12 million will be added to existing emergency water infrastructure schemes, including supplementing those in NSW and Queensland.</li>
<li>$10 million in assistance will be available for pest management in drought affected areas.</li>
<li>$10.7 million will help increase access to social and mental health services in communities affected by this drought.</li>
</ul><p>Farm businesses and farm families across Australia are suffering financially and emotionally as a result of the prolonged drought.</p>
<p>This drought assistance package is to support farm businesses, families and communities that are experiencing hardship and to help them recover when the current drought ends.</p>
