OPENING OF YOUNG LIBERAL YEAR 1968<br />
BRI SBANE<br />
18th January, 1968<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, Senator John Gorton<br />
I don't think that it is possible for me really to<br />
communicate to you the great warmth of feeling that rises<br />
within me by having you here and by having such an undeserved<br />
reception from you. But I can say this, that though I think<br />
that as of now this reception is undeserved, I will promise<br />
you that as far as it lies within my power, I will try in the<br />
years ahead to make it deserved.<br />
One of the things that has been worrying me since<br />
the party elected me to be Prime Minister and the reception<br />
that I feel that this has had throughout the country is the<br />
feeling pressing in on me a little that there are great<br />
expectations of dramatic changes, of sudden variations in<br />
direction, of immensely exciting things happening all at once.<br />
They can't happen that way in the field in which we are engaged.<br />
You can't all of a sudden, in the middle of a financial year,<br />
in the middle of a particular course, have pyrotechnic displays<br />
which change everything in one moment. But that doesn't mean<br />
that we cannot start on new courses, that we cannot think in<br />
new directions, that we cannot, with increasing momentum,<br />
although that momentum may take eighteen months or two years,<br />
but with increasing momentum, set the goals before you and<br />
the people of Australia, indicate what is required to reach<br />
those goals, call on you for the effort needed to achieve those<br />
goals and in that, way, perhaps, meet these new challenges that<br />
you expect us all together to meet. So if there is no drama<br />
immediately, bear that in mind. If there is no sudden<br />
pyrotechnic, bear that in mind. This does not mean that there<br />
will not be for you and us together, new paths to follow which<br />
you may help to indicate to us.<br />
You, Sir, spoke of an Australian national anthem<br />
" God Save The Queen" and " Australia". It reminds me of<br />
somebody who, I think, went to Canberra with their small child<br />
and saw the House of Representatives beginning as you remember<br />
the House of Representatives always begins with a prayer.<br />
The small child said, " Are they praying for the Members of the<br />
House of Representatives" and the mother said, " No, they are<br />
looking at the House of Representatives and praying for<br />
Australia". Actually, that was first told against the American<br />
Senate. But you did speak of a National Anthem. While, of<br />
course, " God Save The Queen" is the over-riding anthem for<br />
Australia, and I regard this as of some significance in a<br />
growing country, I must tell you I am a " Waltzing Matilda" man<br />
myself. I know that song may have originated during the<br />
Marlborough wars somebody once told me that was true, I don't<br />
know. I don't think it matters. i/ hat I think matters is that<br />
it was first sung when this country was first discovered and<br />
first developed. And not beyond the bounds of this country was<br />
it known for some while, but then it began to be known, and<br />
those who went from this country in the 1914-1918 War spread<br />
" Waltzing 1vatilda" and marched to " Waltzing Matilda" and it<br />
became known a little in Europe and other countries of the<br />
world. </p>
<p>2.<br />
In between times whenever two or three Australians<br />
might be gathered together in some foreign country, sooner or<br />
later, somebody usually with a frightful voice would begin<br />
to sing " Waltzing Matilda" and it would become even more known.<br />
I remember myself during the Second World Wat we were in England<br />
and stationed in London and wearing a different uniform from<br />
the RAF, a dark blue RAAF, and walking into nightclubs, because<br />
in those days, they were still interested in nightclubs. and * 1<br />
that was relatively early, and the band when we walked in would<br />
begin to play " Waltzing Matilda". There was a warm feeling<br />
spreading through one at that just as there was when the slouch<br />
hat was hauled to the peak of the flag pole above Bardia to<br />
the strains of " Waltzing Matilda". I think this song is so<br />
integrated into Australia that whatever a government might do,<br />
whatever an ABC might do and, of course, ABC's are far more<br />
important than governments in relation to this " Waltzing<br />
Matilda" will never be able to be taken away from what is the<br />
ethos of the Australian people. Have your anthem, Sir, but<br />
please do not ever allow this song to fall into disuse.<br />
I remember once I went into Taiwan, and the leader<br />
of our delegation was a very distinguished gentleman called<br />
Sir John Latham who was the Chief Justice of Australia, and<br />
he confided to me on the way that the one song he hated above<br />
all others was " WValtzing Matilda", and I said, " Why?" And he<br />
said, " Viell, I am a lawyer, and it is absolutely ridiculous<br />
that a swagman would jump into a billabong and drown himself<br />
merely to escape a charge of stealing a jumbuck, which would,<br />
at the utmost, mean about five days in gaol." 1 So I had great<br />
pleasure when we arrived in Taiwan in persuading all the<br />
Chinese authorities that the one song that the leader of our<br />
delegation liked better than any other was " Waltzing Matilda",<br />
and it would have been thoroughly successful except that they<br />
had played it in Chinese music and he never knew what was being<br />
played, and neither did I! But it is, I think, a part of the<br />
blood of this country of Australia.<br />
mean, what Haavo inweg tonu. i jathoen m th avj√±~ eng auasses, o ng9 6awlayt rtehea lliyn podroet ant thing<br />

build the future. I think that here in this country we<br />
have a great deal to draw from the past and a unique opportunity<br />
for the future. Just use your imaginations for a moment<br />
forget that you are living in a capital city in the Australia<br />
of today, in which you were born, in which many of your parents<br />
were born, which is your country, and think what it must have<br />
been like at the beginning when to these shores came people<br />
from England, from Scotland, from Ireland, from the United<br />
Kingdom. Think of them living in some loneliness, fairly<br />
isolated from the countries which gave them birth, pushing out,<br />
further out into the country with the women isolated from<br />
contact with other women to gossip ( which women always like<br />
to do) living alone, clearing the land, raising a family in<br />
strange surroundings, in unusual circumstances, in loneliness,<br />
calling for effort, calling for fighting against drought and<br />
flood and fire and famine, and of the steadfastness which kept<br />
those people there and which, over the years as this country<br />
developed, built it first in the hinterland, and then as a<br />
result of the riches grown there because of the years of effort<br />
put in there, built the cities which in turn provided the<br />
technological and other advances required. Think for a moment,<br />
just for a moment of that history, where you depended on bullock<br />
trains for transport, where you depended on horseback or buggy<br />
for travel. That is not history for which any country need have<br />
anything but pride. It has enabled us to reach the stage we<br />
have reached today. From it we can draw some inspiration for<br />
what it is we wish to reach in the future. But what is it that<br />
we wish to reach in the future? </p>
<p>3.<br />
Very largely, this is in your hands. It is in the<br />
hands of your leaders, but your leaders will be swayed by the<br />
feelings that you have as to what it is you wish this country<br />
to stand for, as to the paths you wish it to follow.<br />
I am sure and I now talk politically in the best<br />
sense that what you would want to see in this country for the<br />
future is a continuance, and perhaps a refinement of that<br />
political freedom that we have today, that you would be prepared,<br />
as at some time you might have to be prepared, to fight against<br />
some doctrine of absolute and autocratic rule from the top, that<br />
you would be prepared to see that it is impossible for a society<br />
to live in anarchy, and that you would seek to find between that<br />
autocratic rule from the top and that anarchy from the bottom,<br />
some arrangement by which the general will could prevail, giving<br />
freedom to all but not allowing that freedom to extend where it<br />
became licence and threatened the freedom of others. This, I<br />
am sure, is the political base on which you would want to build<br />
our future country. But having given that political base, then<br />
what do you want to see?<br />
Of course, and this is simple, you would wish to see<br />
the material capacities of this country, the material rewards<br />
to those who are living in it, growing, This is obvious, this<br />
is simple, this is easy, this is not, ultimately, important.<br />
But you would wish to see that happen, I am sure, and you would<br />
seek to see that it did happen. But that alone, that alone<br />
couldn't make this a great country, couldn't allow us to take<br />
the chance, the unique chance that we have here to build and<br />
show that a democracy can provide in the world a country better<br />
than any other system can provide. I say " unique" because they<br />
must follow their own talents to the top of their bent, whether<br />
they lie in the field of painting, whether they lie in the field<br />
of music, whether they lie in the field of business administration.<br />
wherever it may be, there is inside each human being, in this<br />
and all other countries, a desire to express themselves, and the<br />
way they can express themselves is by taking the talents that<br />
are inside them and using them and they can only do this if the<br />
opportunity is provided, if the education is provided, if the<br />
material well-being is provided.<br />
There is, I think, some quite meretricious cynicism<br />
in this country today, at least some meretricious cynicism<br />
reported in the papers of this country today about the youth<br />
of Australia, that they have thrown away the values of the past,<br />
that they question the values of their parents. Of course, they<br />
should question the values of their parents and I think they do.<br />
I don't think they throw them away. I don't believe, and I<br />
think you are some living examples to justify my lack of belief,<br />
that there is in the youth of Australia a cynicism. I believe<br />
there is in the youth of Australia a desire to build. I believe<br />
there is in the youth of Australia a desire to give, I believe<br />
that the youth of Australia would respond to other words of<br />
President Kennedy's, " You ask what yo ' ur country can do for you.<br />
Ask rather what you can do for your country". And it is to a<br />
man like me, standing in a place like this tonight, of such<br />
enormous importance that there should be in this room from all<br />
over Queensland so many young people who are taking an interest<br />
in how their cauntry shoula be governed, in the paths their<br />
country should follow, who are prepared to give themselves to<br />
see these paths are followed, their country outside of themselves<br />
is made great. It is of~ such importance to a man like me standing<br />
here, it is of such importance to our country, it is such a<br />
refutation of this cheap charge of cynicism so often levelled<br />
against the youth of Australia. -4 </p>
<p>It will not be long, in the way in which the lives<br />
of nations are mentioned, it will be little less than the<br />
blinking of an eye before some of you here in this room are<br />
called to do the same kind of work that my colleagues and<br />
myself do now. You are preparing yourselves for it, and I<br />
only hope, and I believe that this will be true, that when<br />
that time comes you will be buttressed, you will be supported,<br />
you will be given the spiritual courage which we are given<br />
now by having you here with us.<br />
I haven't much more to say to you. I don't propose<br />
to talk on details of politics or details of policies some<br />
other time. This is the first speech that I have made since<br />
becoming Prime Minister, and I wanted to make it to young<br />
people. I wanted to make it not on what the rate of taxation<br />
should be, or what the rate of excise should be or what there<br />
should be given to this or to that, but rather on the motivating<br />
forces, on the real wellsprings of a nation which alone will<br />
keep a party great, which alone will keep a country great, and<br />
I believe that I see here before me living examples that that<br />
spring is in this party and is in Australia.<br />
I will finish as I began, that I will do my utmost<br />
to be worthy of the support of people such as you, and together<br />
we may see, we may attain more than Henry Lawson thought of,<br />
not only " the vision splendid of the sunlit plains extended<br />
and at night the wondrous glory of the everlasting stars", but<br />
in those sunlit plains are people, happy, arguing, working,<br />
building, and by effort, because by effort alone these things<br />
can be attained, making a country great materially and great<br />
spiritually for the people who live in it.<br />
This conference is open. </p>
