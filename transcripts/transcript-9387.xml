TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH JOHN LAWS, RADIO 2UE, 20 OCTOBER 1994<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
PM: the rain is pouring down.<br />
JL: Well, that's terrific news because I just had a call from somebody in<br />
Yarrawonga, it's raining there and I rang the valley this morning, it's<br />
raining there, they had some thunderstorms in Brisbane last night and<br />
maybe some more today. So, perhaps the rain has returned, Prime<br />
Minister.<br />
PM: Well, I just hope it is widespread. That's the main thing, John.<br />
JL: Yes, pretty important. So is Creative Nation, creative Australia. It<br />
seems to have been pretty well received. There are a few knockers<br />
there. Some saying it was an electoral bribe, I suppose there has to<br />
be elements of that in anything don't there?<br />
PM: Well, I think the arts are so central to where Australia is going to not<br />
just the formation of our identity, but the expression of it and that so<br />
much of the transmission of what Australia is in film and in other things<br />
we do, dance, theatre, that this was the right time to give a new<br />
direction to the arts and to support it.<br />
JL: Yes, I agree with that and it is something, of course, that we should<br />
always be looking to. Somebody has got to have a view of Australia,<br />
not everybody might like your particular view, but at least you have a<br />
view. We have got to have a vision for our country and we need a<br />
cultural vision for our country as well and that is why it should have<br />
been well received.<br />
PM: This is not simply my view of Australia, John, by funding the various<br />
agencies of the arts whether it is the Australia Council or the major<br />
institutions or film and television or multi media or what have you it is </p>
<p>then up to individual creative people to then manage their interests, to<br />
define their own view of Australia and their own view of particular<br />
elements of the arts. So, in a sense, all the Government can be here<br />
and all the Government should be here, is a facilitator.<br />
JL: Yes, why the emphasis on the information super highway as it's called.<br />
Is that tremendously important to Australia's future?<br />
PM: It will be John because I think we are moving into an information age. I<br />
think that we are going to see very refined product of very high value<br />
transmitted around the world and at this point in time a very large<br />
preponderance of the product is English speaking. We are an English<br />
speaking country with a tremendous capacity to develop software and<br />
as you know we have a sophisticated film and television industry<br />
JL: Yes, we do.<br />
PM: And a very high standard education system. So, it seems to me we<br />
are really well set up if we take the advantage, take the option, of<br />
actually producing product for international dissemination on the fibre<br />
optic highway and satellite.<br />
JL: It all amounts to an awful lot of money, but I suppose money shouldn't<br />
be taken into consideration at this time except that you are going to<br />
have the knockers and they are there, who will say and, I suppose, to<br />
a degree correctly, it might have been unfortunate timing because of<br />
the drought, but maybe today's rain puts pay to that criticism.<br />
PM: I think you can do more than one thing at a time.<br />
JL: Well, that's what you and I have talked about before. I mean, it is a<br />
strange sort of government that can't handle more than one thing at a<br />
time, but people quite often want it not to be that way if it doesn't suit<br />
them, but governments must be able to, obviously, all governments at<br />
all levels have got to be able to handle more than one thing at a time.<br />
PM: I met the banks yesterday about the drought and the banks were<br />
saying that they think the structural policy is right, following that<br />
package that I announced on behalf of the Government about three<br />
weeks ago. Now, in respect of the arts we have got a $ 250 million<br />
policy over four years which is roughly $ 60 million a year. Well, the<br />
budget is $ 110,000 million so $ 60 million is not going to break the<br />
bank. But, what it does for the arts is to encourage them, give them<br />
direction and the financial support that, I think, things like, for instance,<br />
John, let me just run through a few of the things: We are establishing<br />
a production fund with the networks and independent producers to<br />
produce higher quality mini-series type, higher quality in television<br />
products for Australian television. Now, I think, that is a thing worth<br />
doing. It is going to create work for our creative people, our </p>
<p>3<br />
producers, directors, actors, writers, in the same way we're doing the<br />
same for SBS. In the Australia Council we're picking up a major<br />
organisation's board to pick up bodies such as the Australian Chamber<br />
Orchestra, the Bell Shakespeare Company, perhaps, the Sydney<br />
Symphony Orchestra...<br />
JL: Who is complaining the loudest?<br />
PK: As you well know, once you do anything with the arts there is always<br />
some criticism but, really, the criticism has been very mooted. There<br />
has been tremendous support for this statement. I am delighted with it<br />
and I'm glad that we were able to do it.<br />
JL Yes, well, I think it is tremendously important. Just back to the banks,<br />
quickly, what was their reaction when you asked them to go gently with<br />
the farmers?<br />
PK: Well, they have been, generally, going gently with the farmers. That is,<br />
from... JL I tell you what, a lot of farmers out there would not agree with that.<br />
PK: No, but if all the farms who could not meet their way, meet their<br />
obligations, had their properties tipped into the market, you would<br />
have a collapse in farm values. Now, the banks, sensibly, have not<br />
done that. And, I think that given the fact that under the exceptional<br />
circumstances arrangements that I announced a couple of weeks ago,<br />
we are meeting up to 100 per cent of the interest cost on borrowings.<br />
And, under the non exceptional circumstances RAS that's the Rural<br />
Adjustment Scheme we're meeting partial interest payments. That's<br />
keeping the banks going, that's keeping them in the game, and it is<br />
keeping the weight off a lot of farmers.<br />
JL: Yes, well, let's hope that today's rain perhaps might be the beginning<br />
of the end of the drought, at least in some areas. Just before we leave<br />
each other, back to the Creative Nation statement, are there changes<br />
in the pipeline for the cross media ownership rules?<br />
PK: No. There are no changes in the pipeline. But, what I was saying the<br />
other night is we're going to see a time not far away, John, when the<br />
cable that comes under your fence is going to be an optic fibre cable<br />
or a coaxial cable which hangs from it. And, that will give you the<br />
capacity for somewhere between fifty and a couple of hundred<br />
channels of product. And, when that goes in, one of the products is<br />
going to be telephones. So, you're going to have telephones and pay<br />
television and other kinds of interactive products on the one line. The<br />
expression for that is convergence. And, as we get convergence the<br />
separation we now have between radio, television, print and telephony </p>
<p>4<br />
is going to change. That was my point. The technology and, of<br />
course, above all of that, the satellites.<br />
JL: So, there are not going to be any changes in the regulations for.., the<br />
reason I'm asking the question is it is a question being asked by a<br />
few what does Rupert Murdoch want in return for setting up the big<br />
film studio?<br />
PK: Well, he has asked for nothing. I have got to say that, I think, what he<br />
would procure from this is because he has the Star Satellite now<br />
transmitting from the Middle East to the Russian Far East and down to<br />
Queensland, and that huge part of Asia, a lot of it will be not all of it,<br />
obviously English speaking product. And, Australia is standing in<br />
that part of the world, the unique nature of our film and television<br />
industry means the system is hungry for product. I think he sees it<br />
as a great opportunity to take, if you like, non American, English<br />
speaking product out of Australia and put it on, basically, that<br />
international system.<br />
JL: OK. Well, thank you very much for your time, let's keep our fingers<br />
crossed about the rain for the sake of the farmers. Is it raining heavily<br />
in Canberra?<br />
PK: Yes, we've got thunder here and it's coming down in sheets.<br />
JL: OK. Well, let's hope it spreads all over Australia and thanks for your<br />
time.<br />
PK: Good, John.<br />
ends. </p>
