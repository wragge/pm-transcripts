TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCE, EASTERN SUBURBS LEAGUES<br />
CLUB, BONDI JUNCTION 20 FEBRUARY 1990<br />
E EQ PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, why is the NCA investigating Mr<br />
Elliott? PM: Let me makea this position very clear, that it has<br />
been the practice consisten. ly, dnd I've spoken to the<br />
Attorney-General about this and I'm reinforced by what he<br />
has to say to me, that Governments neither confirm nor<br />
deny whether particular matters have been referred to the<br />
NCA. that has been the consistent practice. I'm neither<br />
confirming nor denying. But having said that, let me say<br />
this and make it quite clear so that there can be no<br />
grounds for any imputation or snide. suggestion by anyone<br />
in this country, in the media or outside It, that in all<br />
cases where the NCA has references, it's on the basis of<br />
a request by the NCA following preliminary investigations<br />
of referral information from other Government agencies.<br />
They make the request. The NCA makes the request. In<br />
those circumstances, if it comes to the Commonwealth<br />
Attorney-General, then there is a consultation by the<br />
Commonwealth Attorney-Genieral with the relevant Ministers<br />
in each State. That is the practice that has been<br />
followed, as I'm informed, in any case where there has<br />
been a referral. Now let me make it also clear that the<br />
NCA is, as you all know, not a political body. It is the<br />
premier investigative body in this country. It would<br />
only seek references if it has, in any cases, it would<br />
only seek references from the Commonwealth or the State<br />
Ministers when it, the NCA, was satisfied that it had<br />
evidence requiring such a reference. So there's the<br />
position. I'm not confirming nor denying because that is<br />
the practice which has been consistently followed. I'm<br />
neither confirming nor denying. I'm simply saying that<br />
in respect of all cases where there has been references,<br />
it's on the basis of a request from the NCA. Where it<br />
has material before it which it believes requires a<br />
reference, and when it comes to the Commonwealth<br />
Attorney-General, he consults with the States. Obviously<br />
it would be improper in terms of all past practice for me<br />
to say anything more than that and I don't intend to.<br />
JOURNALIST: The Liberal Party has labelled this a<br />
political smear. Do you have any response to<br />
I </p>
<p>PM: Well just let's be clear about that. Let's assume,<br />
let's assume and for the sake of answering your<br />
question, I'm only making the assumption let's assume<br />
that a reference came last year, a request for a<br />
reference came last year to the Attorney-General from the<br />
NCA according to the normal processes where the NCA had,<br />
for the Bake of assumption, that it had material and it<br />
requested the Attorney-General for reference. Then the<br />
logic of what's being said, not by you, but in putting<br />
the question, the logic of it is that if a request had<br />
come in this particular case, because a person concerned<br />
was involved with an opposition party and there may be an<br />
election coming up some time within the next six months,<br />
you don't allow the normal processes to follow. That<br />
would be the assumption if that's what the situation had<br />
been. Now you only have to put it that way to see that<br />
that's an absurdity.<br />
JOURNALIST: Changing the subject Mr Hawke, is the Labor<br />
Party going to actually target Mr Elliott in terms of his<br />
conflict of interest between dealings<br />
PM: No, I haven't got any particular intention at all of<br />
targetting Mr Elliott. What I have said in regard to Mr<br />
Elliott in the past has been measured, as you know, and I<br />
can produce if you like, and I probably will at some<br />
stage during the campaign, acknowledgements by Mr Elliott<br />
that he has been involved with Mr Peacock, when Mr<br />
Peacock was Shadow Treasurer, in discussions about<br />
economic policy. And hie's entitled to. I'm not saying<br />
I mean he's the President of their party and he<br />
acknowledges quite openly that he has been. I'm simply<br />
going to be pointing out during this campaign, amongst<br />
other things, that in regard to the capital gains tax,<br />
which is the proposal to abolish that on the part of the<br />
Liberals, is very simple. It is one which will mean that<br />
the very rich and privileged in this country are going<br />
collectively to have billions of dollars put into their<br />
pockets and taken out of the public revenue which would<br />
be available for expenditure by any Commonwealth<br />
Government on education, roads and a whole range of<br />
things for the benefit of ordinary Australians. Those<br />
billions of dollars are going to be taken out of the<br />
public revenue and put into the pockets of the rich and<br />
privileged. Mr Elliott would be one of the beneficiaries<br />
not the only one. He'd be one of the beneficiaries of<br />
that. And he has said himself that he has been involved<br />
with the Shadow Treasurer in the development of economic<br />
policy. Now I don't think that that's something that the<br />
Australian people would like. I think it's appalling.<br />
But that has got nothing to do with any suggestions that<br />
have emerged in the last 24 hours. And indeed, may I<br />
say, I've been making that point going back over several<br />
months. JOURNALIST: Do these reports help the Government in any<br />
way? </p>
<p>PM: Who am I to assess? I don't know. But I'm in the<br />
position, as is the Attorney-General, that according to<br />
practice we simply can neither confirm nor deny. 1 would<br />
think there are very obvious reasons for that. But I<br />
would make this point in addition. Lionel Bowen is a man<br />
who is not standing at this election. He is a man who I<br />
would think of whom nothing has ever been said, nothing,<br />
by either side of politics which goes to questioning his<br />
integrity. I don't think anyone in the media would be<br />
able to point, and I would challenge anyone on the<br />
Opposition, in the Liberal or the National Parties, to<br />
point to any time in the long and distinguished career of<br />
Lionel Bowen in the State and Federal Parliament, and in<br />
his period as Attorney-General, where there has ever been<br />
any suggestion about the integrity of Lionel Bowen.<br />
Indeed,. I'll auk you to recall that in the Parliament, in<br />
the farewells, they spoke glowingly of Lionel Bowen.<br />
There have been references in the last few months when it<br />
was known that he was going. No-one has ever questioned,<br />
nor could ever question the integrity of Lionel Bowen.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is the NSW State Bank in trouble?<br />
PM: I don't know. That refers to an observation I made.<br />
I simply was saying, people asked me about the State<br />
Bank. I thought the situation was that there could be<br />
not questioning the integrity or the substance of the<br />
bank, but the banking system generally, including the<br />
State Blanks have been in a situation, as you know. I<br />
mean they've announced it, the private banks have<br />
announced that they have difficulties where they have<br />
extended credit in situations where with hindsight they<br />
probably wished they hadn't done so. But I'm not in any<br />
way suggesting that the State Bank of NSW is in problems,<br />
in difficulties, nor have I said that at any point.<br />
JOURNALIST: You mentioned by name.<br />
PM: I di~ d. I'm simply to say that there was some<br />
suggestion that, an implication that the State Bank in<br />
Victoria may uniquely be in a situation of some bad<br />
debts. Now I was simply making the point that I don't<br />
believe that the State Blank of Victoria is uniquely in<br />
that position. And indeed the published results of<br />
private banks would confirm that.<br />
JOURNALIST: On the wages accord, withbut taking away<br />
from Treasurer Keating's limelight<br />
PM: Yes, I'm not going to do that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Would you expect those that you'll be<br />
targetting for benefits to feel grateful for what's being<br />
given or would you expect a cynical reaction?<br />
PM: No, I wouldn't expect a cynical reaction. I mean,<br />
what you've always got to do when you're asking questions<br />
like this is to remember that we've been in office for </p>
<p>seven years. I think this will be about the 14th<br />
economic statement that my friend and colleague, Paul<br />
Keating, will be delivering. So you are able to test<br />
your question as to the likely reactions against what's<br />
happened before. I think you will find that where Paul<br />
Keating, on behalf of the Government, has brought these<br />
statements down, they have been welcomed. But<br />
importantly not only by those who are the direct and the<br />
immediate beneficiaries of what we will be announcing<br />
today but in the sense, even more importantly than that,<br />
there will be the welcome by the community as a whole<br />
that what you're getting is a statement from a Treasurer<br />
on behalf of a Government which is fully funding, not<br />
just for one year but over a three year period, fully<br />
funding any additional spending proposals that we'll be<br />
making. And that will be consistent with what we've done<br />
in the past. In other words, the community is going to<br />
feel satisfaction that these are not wild, unspecified,<br />
unfunded promises. These ure fully funded commitments.<br />
So the attitude will not only, I think, be one of<br />
gratitude on the part of people who will be specific<br />
beneficiaries, but that will give, in my judgement, a<br />
great deal of satisfaction to the community who I think,<br />
have had a gutful of politicians over the years who've<br />
come along and made wild, extravagent, unfunded promises.<br />
I mean, those days are gone. One of the products of this<br />
period of Government has surely been that we do have a<br />
community which is now more economically sophisticated.<br />
It will not buy this wild attempt to buy their votes and<br />
support with unfunded promises. I insan, we say that in<br />
1987 and we have a situation now confirmed by the<br />
Opposition today in regard to the two tier tax system<br />
that they're promising, that they have got a great gaping<br />
hole of $ 6B. $ 6B and a contrast not be able to be<br />
more stark. They are insulting the intelligence of the<br />
Australian voter, saying that they think the Australian<br />
voters will buy the $ 6B hole, credibility gap against the<br />
Government, which through my friend and colleague, Paul<br />
Keating, today will be announcing, fully funded spending<br />
proposals. JOURNALIST; Is there any merit in the call by Mr Bob<br />
Carr for a summit of yourself and State Premiers on the<br />
truck blockade?<br />
PM: Well it doesn't seem to be immediately necessary. I<br />
see that those involved in the blockade have indicated<br />
that their concern is with NSW and not with the Federal<br />
Government, which is appropriate. Now I'm not in any<br />
sense ther fore saying we haven' t got an interest, we<br />
have. But I want to say to Nick Greiner, and Nick I'm<br />
saying this in a non-aggravating and a non-partisan<br />
point scoring sense. I really want to refer to the facts<br />
and that is that there is a proposal on the table, the<br />
blackspots proposal which has got $ 120M attached to it.<br />
If you will agree with the other States well then that<br />
will introduce a uniformity of standards which naturally<br />
enough those operating out there in the trucks, it's a </p>
<p>hell of a job, they as much as those of us who are<br />
looking at it Just rationally and intellectually,<br />
particularly those that are driving the trucks, they want<br />
a uniform standard. Now I'm saying to Nick Greinier that<br />
it can be done and in a way which will involve outlays of<br />
$ 120M by us. If there are some further matters that are<br />
concerning the truckies that go to issues of log books<br />
for instance, which are not part of the $ 120M black spots<br />
program but are matters of concern to them, I would be<br />
quite prepared and happy if there are additional matters<br />
that are not covered by our particular proposals, to have<br />
a meeting of the Commonwealth arid States to look at those<br />
matters to try and get some national uniformity.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Carr has suggested that the State<br />
Government should invoke Section 45D of the Secondary<br />
Boycotts Legislation. Do you support that call?<br />
PM; Well I would hope that you can get it resolved<br />
before you go into that position because as I say, while<br />
I don't condone and I think the truckies know that and<br />
they'll accept my observation on that I don't condone<br />
their tactics. I and I think the overwhelming majority<br />
of Australians understand their concern about standards<br />
and it's a tough job they've got, it really is a tough<br />
job. They are entitled to our understanding but not<br />
support for their tactics. Now I would hope that you<br />
could get the response from NSW to what I've said and on<br />
that basis arid particularly if the federal union can get<br />
an understanding with the others, I would hope that you<br />
can get this matter resolved without resort to that<br />
measure. JOURNALIST: How important to your re-election chances is<br />
today's statement by Mr Keating?<br />
PM: It's impossible to be precise about that. I mean,<br />
the electors5 of Australia will have a range of issues in<br />
their mind. It will be important. There will be<br />
leadership, there will be Medicare, there will be a whole<br />
range of issues. But I think pretty centrally important<br />
will be the question of responsible economic management.<br />
And I think as a result of what Paul will have to say<br />
that you will have projected on to the political face of<br />
Australia now and these next five weeks in which people<br />
have to make up their mind, the starkest possible<br />
alternative. Now obviously I must leave all the details<br />
to Paul but I can say this without jumping his gun in any<br />
way, that the outcome&amp; from his statement will be such<br />
that Australians, wage and salary earners, employers, all<br />
levels of Government, all organisations and welfare<br />
organisations, are a~ ll going to be able to say, well<br />
there for the next 12 to 16 months, there is the economic<br />
environment within which we're operating. There's the<br />
wages outcome, there's the inflation outcome, and quite<br />
clearly it will be within the context of continued<br />
economic growth. They will know that anything that we're<br />
promising will be paid for. Now against that, starkly </p>
<p>there will be the position of an opposition which let's<br />
go to the elements. We're talking about interest rates<br />
being central and crucial. OK, I'll buy that. Now Mr<br />
Peacock has said on the AM program yesterday morning that<br />
his capacity to do anything about interest rates depends<br />
on what happens in the other two areas, fiscal policy and<br />
wages policy. Now at the end of the Keating statement Mr<br />
Peacock will be shot down in flames because you will have<br />
the contrast in fiscal policy, fully funded promises from<br />
the Hawks Government, fully funded. Against that you<br />
will have the $ 6B hole of Mr Peacock. And on wages, a<br />
precise outcome for the next 12 to 18 months on the part<br />
of the Government. Against that, a wages policy which is<br />
regarded by half his own people as a joke and by the<br />
whole community. Why do you think it is that Yesterday<br />
the large business organisations of this country<br />
indicated they didn't want a bar of a Peacock Government.<br />
In large measure it was because they know they have all<br />
the facilities to analyse this thing and they know better<br />
than anyone that in the wages area they would be facing a<br />
wages explosion and a collapse of the economy. if you<br />
have a fiscal blowout and a wages collapse, interest<br />
rates are through the roof to recess the economy. So<br />
it's a long answer to your question but deliberately so.<br />
I can't say precisely how important it will be but<br />
knowing that those things are involved in Paul Keating's<br />
statement on behalf of the Government, it is going, I<br />
think, very clearly in the minds of the Australian<br />
electorate, highlight the difference between responsible<br />
economic management, from a united team who can speak<br />
with one voice and with authority against $ 65 hole from a<br />
group of people who are consistently and continuously<br />
contradicting one another.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawks, do you think Mr Kelty has undue<br />
influence on the Government, given that he is now<br />
formulating 8 large part of your re-election package?<br />
PM: He's not formulating our election package. We have<br />
Snot been secretive about the relationship between the<br />
Governemnt and the trade union movement. It's been there<br />
for seven years. Now the Australian people can make<br />
their judgement and they can take their choice. Before<br />
1983 you had a situation of the conservatives adopting,<br />
as they always have, I mean, it wasn't just a feature of<br />
the last couple of years, they've always adopted a<br />
confrontationist attitude to the trade union movement and<br />
that produced the worst recession in 50 years.<br />
Burgeoning unemployment, burgeoning inflation and may I<br />
say interest rates higher than we ever have reached. Now<br />
against that we said that it doesn't make sense. The<br />
trade union movement is not an ogre. They represent<br />
ordinary Australians, like people that are watching this<br />
and listening to what I'm saying. They are organisations<br />
of ordinary working men and women and we've taken the<br />
view that it makes sense to talk with them and say, look<br />
can we get a way in this country, can we got a way, a<br />
method of talking about your remuneration, which is not </p>
<p>' S. 7<br />
simply to be determined by the biggest money wage<br />
increases that you can possibly get? can we look at<br />
restraint in your money wage claims and also look at<br />
remunerating you and rewarding you by improvements by way<br />
of tax cuts and by way of increases in the social wage<br />
generally,? And Mr Kelty, on behalf of the trade union<br />
movement, has respondend. And in the result, instead of<br />
having the worst recession in 50 years from<br />
confrontation, we've had a rate of employment growth five<br />
times faster than under the conservatives, twice as fast<br />
as the rest of the world, two out of three of our kids<br />
staying in school instead of one out of three, Medicare<br />
instead of two million of our fellow Australians not<br />
being covered. All these have come because the trade<br />
union movement, as the business community recognised, has<br />
excercised a massive restraint in their wages claim.<br />
We've had a 13% reduction in real wage unit labour costs<br />
because of the rest. raint that the trade union movement,<br />
via Mr Kelty, has exercised. So my answer to your<br />
question is I don't think that people are going to say<br />
that that is a bad thing. We have co-operated, talked<br />
with the trade unions as we've talked with business and<br />
the results have been spectacularly better than that<br />
awfully recessed economy that we inherited in ' 83.<br />
JOURNALIST: slightly different accord this time<br />
round in the election campaign<br />
PM: Oh, so the argument therefore is that we throw away<br />
the proper conduct of economic management because there's<br />
an election campaign. I mean, that is a ridiculous<br />
situation. we're reaching the point where you have to<br />
negotiate the next wages agreement and the Australian<br />
electorate are entitled to know as they go to the<br />
election as to whether this Government is capable again<br />
of doing what it's done for seven years, of getting the<br />
restraint in money wage claims. If that can be done in<br />
the context of other considerations which will produce<br />
predictable wage outcomes and predictable inflation<br />
outcomes. They are entitled to know that and to be able<br />
to make a comparison between us and the Opposition. And<br />
we have given them that opportunity and you will see that<br />
spectacularly made clear at the end of Mr Keating's<br />
statement. </p>
