r I FOR PRESS: PM. No. 8C/ 1967<br />
END OF TRANSITION TO DECIMAL CURRENCY<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr Harold Holt<br />
Tomorrow will see the end of the transition to dollars<br />
and cents. Reports reaching me show that the public and the business<br />
community generally are already reaping benefits we had anticipated from<br />
conversion to decimal currency.<br />
There is, however, some danger that the greatest<br />
benefit that of simplicity in our money dealings may not be fully<br />
realised for a time because we find some still showing the value of<br />
commodities, particularly higher-priced commodities, in pounds, shillings<br />
and pence. This will only confuse the public, who have demonstrated<br />
their ready acceptance of the new currency.<br />
The Treasurer and I have discussed suggestions that<br />
the Government should legislate to prohibit refercnces to pounds, shillings<br />
and pence. We both considered this to be undesirable, and preferred to<br />
make a joint appeal to those concerned. Accordingly, I have written to<br />
representatives of the Australian newspapers, television and radio stations8,<br />
and to advertising agencies, seeking their co-operation and assistance in<br />
putting an end to 9. s. d. advertising. I have also written to interested<br />
national commercial associations informing them of this, and asking them<br />
to co-operate with the Government and advertising media by eliminating<br />
all references to pounds, shillings and pence from their prices and<br />
advertising. With the co-operation of these groups, the last vestiges<br />
of the old currency should rapidly disappear. The replies I have already<br />
received assure me of a genuine desire to work with the Government in<br />
this matter. We changed our currency because of the considerable<br />
advantages of a decimal system. We would be depriving ourselves of the<br />
essential simplicity of the new system if we continued to use Outmoded<br />
pounds, shillings and pence. The Decimal Currency Board, the machine<br />
conversion companies, banks, business houses and news media have all<br />
done an excellent job in assisting to shorten the transition . The<br />
Government asks that pricing and advertising in the old currency<br />
now cease.<br />
