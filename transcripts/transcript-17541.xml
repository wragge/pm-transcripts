    <content><![CDATA[<p>
PM: Can I start by saying I want to address some matters as we move towards the opening on the 43rd Parliament next week, and I also want to make some comments about the Commonwealth Games.</p>
<p>Firstly, starting with matters as we move towards the formal opening of Parliament next Tuesday, there has been a considerable degree of public interest in what is to happen with the position of Speaker. I have literally, minutes ago, put the phone down from a telephone conversation with the Leader of the Opposition, Tony Abbott. He has said to me in that telephone conversation that he and the Opposition will not abide by the parliamentary reform agreement that they signed.</p>
<p>Mr Abbott has indicated to me that whilst, of course, he and his political party agreed with parliamentary reform, he does not intend to honour that section of the agreement that has the Speaker paired. Mr Abbott has indicated to me that he intends to break his word - having given his word; having had his political party give its word; having entered an agreement in writing; having publically verified on a number of occasions that he intends to honour the agreement, he now intends to break his word.</p>
<p>The Opposition will not honour the pairing section of the agreement.</p>
<p>In those circumstances, where Mr Abbott is behaving in such a fashion, obviously the Government will consider its position and when I'm in a position to provide people with further advice about our attitude towards who should take the position of Speaker, then I will.</p>
<p>But can I confirm I view this to be an extraordinary set of events. Parliamentary reform is important. It's important to the openness of the Parliament.</p>
<p>The Government entered into discussions with the Opposition and with Mr Rob Oakeshott, representing the independents, in good faith. We gave our word. Our intention has always been to honour our word.</p>
<p>I would have thought it was a reasonable expectation that the Leader of the Opposition would also honour his word. He has now said to me, and effectively to the Australian people, that his word is worth absolutely nothing.</p>
<p>Then, of course, on arrangements for the 43rd Parliament, I can today confirm that when the Parliament sits the Government will be introducing legislation in both the House of Representatives and the Senate.</p>
<p>We will introducing over 30 bills into the Parliament in the first week of it sitting. These bills cover a wide variety of areas, and of course we will be releasing the full list of legislation to be introduced in the first week, but the bills include topics like: strengthening our nation's aviation security by increasing penalties; establishing a permanent national body to set safety and quality standards for our hospitals and health services; improving access to services and representation for university students; establishing, for the very first time, a national preventative health agency to help drive reform in the preventative health agenda - that is, keeping people healthier; and we will also be strengthening the ability of the Australian Crime Commission to fight organised crime.</p>
<p>These are obviously significant legislative items and they will be before the Parliament from the first week that it sits.</p>
<p>I now turn to making some comments about the Commonwealth Games, and let me start by saying there is obviously widespread concern about the Commonwealth Games. Now, the Government's role is to provide Australians who are intending to travel, whether they be athletes or whether they be Australians travelling generally, with the best possible advice that we can on the circumstances that will confront them when they travel.</p>
<p>The decision on whether to attend the Games is obviously a matter for individuals, just like any decision to travel is a matter for individuals, but as the Government we seek to provide people with the best possible travel advice, and I do remind Australians that for a considerable period of time our travel advice in relation to India has asked Australians to exercise a high degree of caution in India; our travel advice is made clear that there is a high risk of terrorism in New Delhi; and our travel advice has made clear that since 2000 there have been at least 14 major terrorist attacks in New Delhi.</p>
<p>Now, this travel advisory reflects our best assessment of the safety and security issues in India, and we'll of course continue to monitor the security environment in India very closely, and while security in India is ultimately a matter for the Indian Government, we have also boosted the number of officials we have in New Delhi and we have others on stand-by.</p>
<p>Now, questions about the Commonwealth Games are matters for the Commonwealth Games Federation. Our High Commission in New Delhi is in constant contact with the Indian Government, the Commonwealth Games Federation and of course our own Australian Commonwealth Games Association. Our High Commission is obviously also in contact with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade here in Canberra on all aspects of the Commonwealth Games preparations, including issues relating to safety and security.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth Games Federation and the Australian High Commission have sought repeated assurances from Indian authorities as to the safety and structural integrity of Games venues. Now, I understand that the head of the Commonwealth Games Federation, Mike Fennell, is meeting with senior Indian officials to discuss their concerns about the preparedness of the facilities. The Minister for Sport, Minister Arbib, will be seeking an update once those discussions have occurred.</p>
<p>I'm very happy to take any questions.</p>
<p>Yes, Mark?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: How would you characterise the tone of your conversation with Tony Abbott and does this mean, this breakdown mean, that the new politics, the new atmosphere, is dead before it's even got to the starter's line?</p>
<p>PM: Well, look, the tone of my conversation was businesslike and professional, but obviously the news here, I think, is important news. That is, at the very outset of this Parliament Mr Abbott has indicated to me and to the Australian people that he can't be trusted to keep his word.</p>
<p>Paul?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Today you said that there's new information in terms of the Constitutional implications of the agreement?</p>
<p>PM: Well, there is new information. That is, the advice that was released by the Government yesterday from the Solicitor-General. It's a very extensive advice. My recollection is it's around 20 pages. I sat down and read it page by page yesterday, and what that advice provides to us is a very clear indication that the arrangement for pairing was Constitutional. The Solicitor-General, in his written advice, made that absolutely clear, so Mr Abbott is not in a position to use yesterday's Solicitor-General's advice as an excuse, and indeed in his telephone conversation with me he did not seek to do so.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, what was the reason that he did use for not honouring the agreement?</p>
<p>PM: Well, Mr Abbott used with me the terminology that this comes down to a 'gentlemen's agreement'. The Solicitor-General uses the terminology that is a question of honour. Mr Abbott says he doesn't believe that these questions can be dealt with as a matter of honour or a 'gentlemen's agreement'. I, of course, disagree with that. I believe if you're prepared to keep your word then you can keep your word.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Why are you not able to now tell us what you'll do about the Speaker, and are you still casting around beyond Harry Jenkins?</p>
<p>PM: Well, Michelle, I literally put the phone down from Tony Abbott minutes before coming out here to advise you of this. Obviously, I was intending to make the announce about the legislation and also provide some commentary about the Commonwealth Games, so I've literally put the phone down minutes ago. In those circumstances I'll consider what the Government should do now following Mr Abbott's advice to me, and I'll have some consultation with my colleagues.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Further to Michelle's question, can you rule out the Government actually approaching a Liberal MP to be Speaker, and secondly, just on the Commonwealth Games matter, you mentioned that you've got security, you've boosted officials and so on to go to India, with other people on stand-by. Are you talking about military types, spy agencies, that sort of stuff? Is that the sort of personnel you're talking about sending to India?</p>
<p>PM: Well, firstly we don't comment on the detail of security arrangements, but we've boosted the number of people working in New Delhi.</p>
<p>On the second, I'm obviously not going to speculate about what decisions I and my colleagues may take following this advice from Mr Abbott. I had not expected that Mr Abbott would just wholly break his word - wholly break his word. That wasn't my expectation. In those circumstances I'll take the time to consider the matter and to consult with my colleagues.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: So it is still possible? It is still possible-</p>
<p>PM: -I'm not going to, having literally just put the phone down from Tony Abbott, speculate about what course the Government might take now. I will consider the matter and I'll consult with my colleagues as I believe is proper and appropriate.</p>
<p>Katherine?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, given that it is, it is pretty unlikely that a Liberal will deprive one of its own side of a number at this point, wouldn't it be better - with Parliament resuming next week - just to accept that Mr Abbott has taken this position, draw a line over it, and put up Mr Jenkins and move on? Wouldn't that be better?</p>
<p>PM: We'll, we'll take the time to consider it and I'll consult with my colleagues. Yes, Ross?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, are you planning to move into The Lodge before Parliament sits?</p>
<p>PM: Look, yes, I am making some arrangements. Obviously, The Lodge has had repairs done which were best done whilst no-one was there in residence. They go to securing some asbestos, for example, so I will be seeking to move into The Lodge before Parliament formally opens next week.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, some of the parents of the athletes have expressed concern about going to Delhi. What's your message to them today?</p>
<p>PM: Well, Australians need to make their decisions. Obviously, as a Government we don't - and this is true of the Government today, it's been true of the Government over years and years and years - this is a free country where Australians make their own decisions about where they travel to.</p>
<p>What we seek to do is to provide the best possible information, so I would direct their attention to the travel advisory. Obviously, they can also speak to our officials at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. They should absorb the travel advisory, obviously work with their sporting association, work with the Commonwealth Games Association and make what they believe is the appropriate decision.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Are you intending to have your Sports Minister attend the Games?</p>
<p>PM: Yes, it's our intention that Minister Arbib will attend the Games. Obviously, Minister Arbib is there in an official capacity as the Minister for Sport.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, the Opposition accuses you of breaking your word to the Australian people over a carbon tax.</p>
<p>PM: Well, that's as it may be, Paul - a matter of politicking by the Opposition. Obviously, what I have done as Prime Minister is recognise that in this Parliament there are players who are not members of the Government who will also be there in the Parliament, able to put propositions for consideration and debate. I've agreed with the Australian Greens and also with the other independents that we will have an inclusive climate change committee to discuss questions of best tackling climate change.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, are you able to give an assurance to the parents of the athletes and the athletes that the Government is telling them and the public everything you know about the security situation? And would you, having weighed up the travel advice yourself, would you actually prefer that people didn't go?</p>
<p>PM: Look, the Government provides publicly the best advice we can. We don't seek to hide anything. We want Australians to have the information and that - the travel advice there - is the best travel advice we can give people on the information that we know.</p>
<p>Now, you know, this comes down to a decision for individuals. I travelled to India in 2009 as Minister for Education and Deputy Prime Minister. I travelled there when the travel advice was in this form, so I made a decision.</p>
<p>Now, people need to make decisions, to think it through for themselves. We, as a Government - it's true of this Government, it's been true of Governments of the past - in a democracy where people are free to make their own decisions we don't tell people what to do. We give them the best possible information to inform adults and, obviously, adults that have the care of people who are under age, to inform them so that they can make their decisions.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, on your legislative agenda, have you discussed this with Senator Brown? Do you expect a euthanasia vote soon? Has he asked for that? What's your position on euthanasia?</p>
<p>PM: Well, firstly the legislation list - we have consulted as we're obligated to do under our agreements with Mr Oakeshott and Mr Windsor and Mr Wilkie, as well as the Australian Greens. As a matter of courtesy I've also asked my office to advise Mr Crook and Mr Katter that this is the Government's legislative agenda that will be introduced in the first week. So, advice has been given that this is the legislative agenda.</p>
<p>On the matter that Senator Brown talked about on Meet the Press, I think it was, on Sunday - which of course I watched - but on that matter, Senator Brown's indicated that he's going to move a Private Member's Bill. He is able to do that under the standing orders as they are now and, indeed, as they will be as a result of the new Parliamentary arrangements. So, I'm not going to give an indication about my own personal decision in relation to that bill until I see it.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, do you-</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: -(inaudible) a conscience vote if it does come up?</p>
<p>PM: Last time - this obviously has a legislative history - where as I understand it, I wasn't in the Parliament at the time, but as I understand it the Northern Territory took a decision about euthanasia. Mr Andrews, who is still in the Parliament, Kevin Andrews sponsored a bill to change the competence of territories to legislate on such questions. It was dealt with then as a conscience vote by the ALP, so it would be dealt with now as a conscience vote by the ALP.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Ms Gillard, the operation of Parliament, both Houses, requires a certain amount of convention and unwritten agreement. Does Mr Abbott's starts on the Speaker, in your view does that rewrite the way you're going to conduct business informally with the Opposition over the next three years?</p>
<p>PM: Look, my intention is to bring to this Parliament a spirit of goodwill and a determination to get things done. I would hope that others in the Parliament would show that same spirit of goodwill and determination to get things done. Obviously, I am concerned that the spirit that Mr Abbott is bringing to this Parliament is one of what can he wreck rather than what can he achieve.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, there are issues, other Parliamentary reform - Question Time and so on. Have you had discussions with Mr Abbott about a committee to look at this? And is there any progress, once this issue, which is obviously being fought out, once that's settled, further reform, bipartisan Parliamentary committee?</p>
<p>PM: Well, extensive Parliamentary reform was the subject of this agreement, and the Leader of Government Business, Minister Albanese, has been working to have that changed from an agreement into standing orders. He's done that in a consultative way with his counterpart, Christopher Pyne. I would obviously hope that those new standing orders will get bipartisan support and be dealt with very early on in the life of the new Parliament.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, have you had any indication - have you had any indication-</p>
<p>PM: -You right there, Sid? You're confused today. You're alright?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: No, no, I'm fine.</p>
<p>PM: Good.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Have you had any indication from the independents about whether they will support these bills, about whether these bills will pass? And secondly, why did you mention aviation security as the first bill that you talked about when you were outlining the legislative agenda, because I notice on the television this morning there's lots of reports out of the United States about increased threat levels.</p>
<p>PM: Look, I went to just a number of matters I thought were particularly noteworthy, so that was the reason for mentioning aviation security.</p>
<p>On the legislation, what we've done is we've advised the independents and the Greens that the Government will be seeking passage of this legislative program. That is, these bills will be introduced in the first week. Obviously, other legislation will be introduced in the other weeks of the Parliamentary session, including legislation that the Government will bring to the Parliament to action our election commitments. So, further consultation will happen following the introduction of the bills.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, when will you send Chris Bowen to East Timor-</p>
<p>PM: -Last one. Last, last one.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: When will you send Chris Bowen to East Timor, and when do you intend going yourself?</p>
<p>PM: Look, I did have a conversation, obviously, with Mr Gusmao. We had a conversation - he rang, we made arrangements to speak. Partly, as Prime Minister, he was offering me congratulations after the election. We did have a discussion about Minister Bowen going to East Timor as soon as that can be reasonably done for a discussion with his counterpart.</p>
<p>Okay, thank you very much.</p>
