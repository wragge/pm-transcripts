PRESS STATEMENT NO. 6<br />
8 December 1972<br />
SALES TAX ON OPAL CONTRACEPTIVES<br />
The Federal Government has lifted the sales tax on<br />
oral contraceptives as from today.<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr. Whitlam, made the decision<br />
after consultations with senior officers of the Federal<br />
Treasury and the Taxation Department.<br />
A special meeting of the Pharmaceutical Benefits<br />
Advisory Committee called for today agreed with Mr. Whitlam's<br />
suggestion that oral contraceptives prescribed by a doctor<br />
would become available as pharmaceutical benefits.<br />
Sales tax until today on all contraceptives was<br />
levied at a rate of 27-per cent.<br />
Mr. Whitlam, in announcing today's decision, said that<br />
enabling legislation would be introduced when Federal Parliament<br />
resumed next year.<br />
The legislation would make the exemption of the sales<br />
tax retrospective to today.<br />
However, pending passage of the legislation, the tax<br />
will not be collected.<br />
