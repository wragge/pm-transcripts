TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WI<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
1AUGUST 198h<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke,<br />
might make comments abott<br />
Do you find it rather ama<br />
and actually admitted the<br />
Labor-Party put our polici<br />
and then Ie he abeWS fAi<br />
PM: I suppose at last we<br />
Party who is approaching I<br />
indictment of his own part<br />
is to slash social servicE<br />
ho has spent the last 12 ri<br />
Covernmernt. The smal I 5ep<br />
what we have done is righ<br />
to slash more. Hie has sh(<br />
of Australia in the socia<br />
risk. The Pensioners wo<br />
more. He said in regard<br />
are doing is right. Not<br />
Mr Howard, the job wh.<br />
around anid saying what we<br />
the hard jobs and if they<br />
Mr Peacock. let Mr Howard<br />
they are. Are they going<br />
truth about their Pdrty o.<br />
and delude the Australian<br />
the liberal PartLy, Mr Peat<br />
They will never be trust'<br />
trusted before.<br />
JOURNALIST: So you obvio<br />
support for your policies<br />
and thc tax<br />
PM: Let's read what lie s<br />
with Lhis talk of privati<br />
at the edges. What you h<br />
welfare. HeI said what ha<br />
which if I can be a litti<br />
someone in the Liberal Pa<br />
be a little candid on whl ~ INSTER<br />
T1I CHE~ RYL -rA-AL0Z CHANNEL 9 SVDNI-Y<br />
think that the political analysts7<br />
the strategies of various partis<br />
z~ ing that John Valder has come out<br />
strategy of elo's sit and watch the<br />
. eS. let them fall out of office<br />
ke 0vei.<br />
have found someone in the Liberal<br />
ionesty. IL is a most devastating<br />
He says that what to be done<br />
1Here is Lhe leader of" Lhe Party,<br />
riths or more attacking my<br />
Swe took in the assets Lest. tie said<br />
L. It is not eniough, you have got<br />
) wn that pensloners, al. l the people<br />
L welfare system would be in grave<br />
ld have their incomes slashed even<br />
to fringe benefits on tax, what we<br />
enough. But of course, Mr Peacock.<br />
ile we are in government of going<br />
are doing is wrong. Let Labor do<br />
get back do it even more. Now let<br />
stand tip and be revealed for what<br />
to repudiate this man who tells the<br />
r are they going to go on and try<br />
people even more. This has revealed1<br />
cock, the cynical tiypocrits, which<br />
an1 people will come to know they are.<br />
ed again. They should not have been<br />
usly Lake this as a rcsound inq<br />
. Particularly on t4pp6fd Porh. m<br />
ays. H-e said don't fiddle around<br />
sat-ion. He says it is just fiddling<br />
ave got to do is slash the social<br />
ppenied over even the assets test,<br />
e candid, You know remarkable for<br />
rty. he is the President. If I can<br />
t he thought was a Private program.<br />
i* </p>
<p>PM cont: But here it is. He said about the assets test, it<br />
" was a very small step in the direction" the L-iberal Party<br />
should take.<br />
JOURNALIST: It looks like it is Valder versus Peacock. Any<br />
, predictions on where it is going<br />
PM: NO it is not just Valder against Peacock. It is Valder<br />
against the sham, the hypocrisy arid deceit embodied by Mr<br />
Peacock. Mr Peacock is an illustration of the tactic of the<br />
Liberal Party in this country. They recognise, as indeed Mr<br />
Peacock did on the backbench in 1981, they recognised the<br />
truth, the necessiLy for tne welfare of this country, for Lhese<br />
things to be done that we are doing. They are sayinq no, in<br />
public we will get up and we will tell lies. We will say<br />
we are against what the Government is doing in the assets test,<br />
against what we are doing with the fringe benefit. And hope<br />
that the Labor Party will do them, and the population will<br />
be turned against the Labor Party by our of the Liberal Party,<br />
hypocrisy and lies. And then when we get back in, not<br />
repudiate what the Labor Party has done, but do even more to<br />
cut deeply into social welfare. So it is not Valder against<br />
Peacock, it is in part. Tt is Valder against all the sham<br />
and hypocrisy of these people. Now what we want to hear from<br />
Mr Peacock, is he going to try and sack Mr Valder for telling<br />
the truth. WE want to hear from Mr Howard. What is Mr Howard<br />
gring to do? Because Mr Howard agrees with Mr Valder. It<br />
is an interestinq scenario which we will all be watching with<br />
very, very great interest.<br />
