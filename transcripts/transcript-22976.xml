    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Prime Minister and the Chairman of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) are pleased to announce that a Prime Minister’s XI and an ATSIC Chairman’s XI will play a cricket match at Manuka Oval in Canberra on Thursday 5 April 2001. The match will be an important event during the Centenary of Federation.</p>
<p>A cricket game held to recognise the significance of the participation of Indigenous Australians in cricket both prior to and since Australian Federation was first proposed by ATSIC Chairman, Mr Geoff Clark.</p>
<p>The staging of this match provides an opportunity to celebrate the past and present contribution made by Indigenous Australians to cricket, and more widely to sport.</p>
<p>Indigenous cricket teams have a long and proud tradition on Australian cricket fields, stretching as far back as the middle of the nineteenth century.</p>
<p>Achievements by Aboriginal cricketers include the legendary 1868 Aboriginal team that was the first representative team from this country to tour England.</p>
<p>The 5 April match will be a standard one day game held during national Centenary of Federation celebrations.</p>
<p>The majority of cricketers participating in the match will be professional and/or promising young cricketers. At the same time, match arrangements will allow for the participation of a small number of well known identities who do not regularly play the game.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister and the ATSIC Chairman wish to thank the Australian Cricket Board and the ACT Cricket Association for giving their support to the staging of this match.</p>
<p>The Australian community, and cricket fans in particular, are urged to support this event.</p>
<p>3 January 2001</p>
