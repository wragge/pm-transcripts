TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP, TREASURY PLACE, MELBOURNE, 17<br />
NOVEMBER 1989<br />
B 0 2 PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, do you'have any comment on the Pilots<br />
Federation applying to the Industrial Relations Comission to<br />
be a respondent to the IPEC award?<br />
PM: about any of that area is my profound amazement at<br />
the laziness and intellectual sloth of media of Australia<br />
who seem to find surprising a statement I issued yesterday<br />
which is a repitition of what I've said all along. That is<br />
to enunciate clearly what apparently hasn't been enunciated<br />
by their own Federation to the pilots about the possible<br />
role of the AFAP in the Commission. That has been laid down<br />
explicity by the Commission in its decision and an<br />
opportunity has always been there provided they abide by the<br />
conditions of the Commmission. It's amazing to me that<br />
JOURNALIST: inaudible<br />
PK: understand thisf haven't understood the position<br />
that's been quite clear.<br />
