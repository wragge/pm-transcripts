I EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
AUSTRALIAN MADE PHASE II LAUNCH<br />
GREENSBOROUGH -7 APRIL 1986<br />
Last June, when I announced the Australian Made Campaign I<br />
was confident it would be a success.<br />
I was confident that Australians were waiting for a campaign<br />
like this and were repared to do their bit for the country<br />
by choosing Australian made products where they represented<br />
value for money.<br />
But I am pleased to say that my high hopes for the campaign<br />
have been well and truly exceeded.<br />
Because the message conveyed by the ' True Blue'<br />
advertisements is really getting through to the Australian<br />
buying public.<br />
And the green and gold ' Australian made' logo is being<br />
attached to more and more products, showing that they are<br />
genuine, true blue, Australian made goods.<br />
Since the campaign began, more than 800 manufacturers have<br />
signed up for the right to display that green and gold logo.<br />
In using the logo, thos~ e manufacturers are telling you, the<br />
customers, that their product is the genuine Aussie article.<br />
It's even more encouraging that a number of manufacturers<br />
have boosted their local content so that they can qualify<br />
for the logo.<br />
And it's not just manufacturers, but shoppers themselves,<br />
who have seen the benefits of supporting Australian made<br />
products. They're not just saying " Yes, I know about the True Blue<br />
advertisement but I'm not going to do anything about it".<br />
The fact is more and more Australians are now buying<br />
Australian made products and in doing this they are<br />
playing a central role in helping Australia meet the<br />
economic challenge it faces.<br />
The collapse in many of our export prices means that the<br />
world has cut Australia's income to the tune of $ 1500 per<br />
-~ Australian family. Australian workers and families and<br />
businesses have to practise restraint and work together if<br />
we are to build a better Australia for ourselves and our<br />
kids. </p>
<p>By choosing products bearing the official green and gold<br />
logo, you are helping your country by reducing our<br />
dependence on imports and by boosting Australian companies,<br />
Australian jobs, Australian products.<br />
If, in a single year, shoppers were to switch $ 200 of their<br />
purchases per family member from imported to Australian Made<br />
products, we would cut about $ 2.5 billion off Australia's<br />
import bill. And that would be a very significant step<br />
indeed on the way to building prosperity for the future.<br />
The success of the Australian Made campaign so far has<br />
spurred the Government on to a second phase, and that's what<br />
I'm here to launch today at Greensborough Shopping Centre.<br />
During this second phase we'll be aiming to boost the<br />
quality of a broader range of Australian made products.<br />
We'll also be encouraging more manufacturers to use the<br />
green and gold logo. We'll be helping retailers mount<br />
Australian Made promotions like the one displayed here at<br />
Greensborough this week. And, of course, we will be running<br />
True Blue advertisements on TV and in regional newspapers.<br />
What we are seeking to do is to have more products on the<br />
shelves of our shops and supermarkets bearing the green and<br />
gold logo, so that more Australian made products will be<br />
bought by shoppers, and so that the quantity of imported<br />
goods we need will fall.<br />
I want to congratulate the Advance Australia Foundation for<br />
its great work in organising the campaign. I want to<br />
congratulate Australian manufacturers and retailers for<br />
getting Aussie products on the shelves.<br />
But most of all I want to congratulate you, the Australian<br />
shopper, for choosing Australian made products where they<br />
represent value for money.<br />
You are helping your fellow Australians by keeping them<br />
secure in their jobs, you are helping your country trade its<br />
way out of its difficulties, and you are helping your<br />
hildren by building a stronger economy.<br />
You have every right to be proud of yourselves, and I thank<br />
you. </p>
