INTERVIEW WITH RICHARD COLVIL1LE<br />
Question: The Premiers have been somewhat critical of the deliberations<br />
of the Loan Council rather than what went on with the Premiers'<br />
conference. Why have loan approvals been kept Co what must<br />
be I suppose the barest acceptable minimum?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
They have been kept tight because there have been substantial<br />
other funds available. The tax reimbursement funds are rising<br />
quite considerably by an average of something a little over<br />
11% it varies a little from State to State.<br />
A couple of years ago, we began with the States a major<br />
new programme of national development to underpin the growth<br />
and progress of Australia in the 1980s major resource projects,<br />
opening new mines, coal mines or whatever it might be, providing<br />
the power which is needed for indust-ry, for the expansion of the<br />
aluminium industry and aluminium smelters. It is all vastly<br />
expensive and because of the pace of development projects<br />
in Australia, new efforts, new initiatives are needed by<br />
governments. Six months ago I wrote to the States and asked them to bring<br />
forward new electricity generation projects for electricity<br />
based on coal. We have good supplies of coal and by world<br />
standards, we can produce cheap electricity. That would enable<br />
us to at-tract more industries for processing, for manufacturing<br />
and it will help to employ more Australians.<br />
Now the States put forward a large number of projects.<br />
They put forward projects in relation to rail electrification<br />
and very, very large sums of money are involved in this.<br />
The ~ total programme is now running between $ 4 and $ 5 billion<br />
over several years they're ' approvals. So.. this is a new area<br />
of funds available to the States. Again, in -the total funds<br />
available to the States around 10 or 11 percent in the circumstance<br />
it is not unreasonable for one or two of the States major<br />
resource States the funds are a good deal higher than that.<br />
But it is becaus3-of these new programmnes-for national<br />
development, access to funds, the States borrowing overseas,<br />
that the other demands of government have been kept very tight<br />
because there has to be an overall. limitation on ahat the<br />
Government can assume and what governments demand from the<br />
economy.<br />
Question: A couple of Premiers or State leaders, Mr Ferguson and Mr Hamer<br />
in particular, have said that they will probably have to put<br />
up State charges because of what happened here today. How do<br />
you react to Chat? SUNDAY JUNE 29 1980 </p>
<p>-2<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Premiers will always go away, anld i~ f they have an unpalatable<br />
thing to do, they will -blame the Co-' monwealth or blame the<br />
Premiers' Conference, the Loan Council meeting. That is<br />
the way I think it will always be. But I only ask you to look<br />
at-what a number of Premiers not. all, a numberhave<br />
said year after year about Premiers' Conferences. The dire<br />
predictions of calamity after the Premiers' Conference a year<br />
ago, but as a ' result of that Premiers' Conference, and a<br />
result of our economic policies, there has been stronger econo-ic<br />
growth than the Treasurer foreshadowed at the time of the last<br />
budget. We are in a much, much better Dosition* than many countkies<br />
overseas with lower rates of inflation here than America or<br />
3ritain where it is double ours, more than double. There is a<br />
degree of tradition in what the Premiers say, but obviously,<br />
if there is inflation which nobody likes, State charges are<br />
going to have to go up because the ' State bodies-whether it is<br />
for water supplies or sewerage or for electricity generation<br />
while they borrow funds for some of their capital works, they<br />
also need to generate funds internally. Any normal business<br />
operates in that way. Therefore,. costs are going up and<br />
charges for those kind of State services, are inevitably<br />
going to go up from time to time. I don't think it is real<br />
life to say that those things are going up because of the<br />
Premiers' Conference and the Loan Council as such. They are<br />
basically going up because the States want more revenue.<br />
I am not criticising that, but I would say that they should<br />
take responsibil. ity for their own decisions and not try and<br />
suggest that it is something, somebody else has done.<br />
Question: Speaking of raising revenue, you are now working on your<br />
next budget the pre election budget. What can we look<br />
forward to there?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I am afraid you will have to wait and see. The only thing that<br />
I have said about that budget as I have said about others, is<br />
that it will be a responsible budget. Against the philosophy of<br />
what we have done, it will be against what we believe to be<br />
right for Australia to embark on the path of trying to buy votes<br />
in the pre-election budget, and we are not going to do it.<br />
It would be a wrong thing, I believe if the government<br />
takes that path it is adopting a somewhat cynical attitude<br />
towHards the people of A_' ustralia, because I have always believed<br />
the average Australian can judge for himself whether a government<br />
is acting in his best interest or not. And that average Australian<br />
also knows that a government which is going to do what is right<br />
for the country can't always do what is popular. Obviously,<br />
we would prefer to if we can, but there are some times as<br />
we have shown over the last five years when awkward decisions<br />
have been necessary. Now, I don't want anyone to conclude from<br />
that that there will be awkward decisions in the next budget.<br />
The only word I would apply to it is responsible. ./ 3 </p>
<p>3<br />
Question: And not a vote buying buciet?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Not in the sense in which it is meant to be, no. In the common<br />
ja'rgon, no, most certainly not.<br />
Question: Turning to foreign affairs. Over the last couple of weeks<br />
there has been a change to the Russian status in Afghanistan,<br />
or a promise of a change. The Russians have said<br />
that they will withdraw some troops. What is your reaction<br />
to this? Do you think it is at least something of a success for<br />
your stand over Afghanistan?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I have seen reports to the nature of troops that are likely<br />
to be withdrawn, and I don't think they are ones that are<br />
much use in battling with the insurgency the rebels, the<br />
freedom fighters in Afghanistan. SO, in. a sense, I think it<br />
is a phony withdrawal. On our advice, it is a withdrawal<br />
to the border or just over where there are about 40,000 other<br />
troops waiting to reinforce units in Afghanistan if that should<br />
be necessary, and reinforce at short notice.<br />
So, I don't place much store on that. But there is a point<br />
that is interesting. The Soviets have shown over what they<br />
said about that withdrawal -however phony or false it might<br />
be -that they are to an extent, responsive to world opinion.<br />
They have shown that they are concerned to an extent with the<br />
odium which has been cast at them and the slur upon the<br />
Soviet name as a result of their invasion, and oppression<br />
and suppression of Afghanistan.<br />
Again, to an extent-and all of this has real qualifications<br />
on it -that is a sign that does have some encouragement in it.<br />
Because if world opinion, and those who make it all the countries<br />
o2 tCe world, large, small, third world, Islamic countries,<br />
countries lik. Australia can know that speaking with a conmon<br />
voice and in this case a common voice of condemnation, and taking<br />
some actions which give strength to that condemnation, if they<br />
can know that it is going to have an impact on Soviet policies,<br />
well then that gives us a capacity and a hope for being able<br />
to build a better and safer world. I don't overstate it, but<br />
it is something to think about. </p>
