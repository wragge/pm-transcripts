FOR PRESS No. 111<br />
QUANTITATIVE RESTRICTIONS<br />
( Statement by the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade,<br />
Mr. J. McEwen.)<br />
The Minister for Trade, Mr. McEwen, said today that<br />
the Government had no intention whatever of re-introducing<br />
import licensing as previously understood. The Prime Minister<br />
had intimated that in respect of a quite restricted category<br />
of Australian manufactures it appeared that an element of<br />
quantitative restrictions could be a most useful addition to<br />
other tariff protection.<br />
Mr. McEwen denied that he would detail rigid quotas<br />
on a number of imported items within the next few days.<br />
He was referring to certain published reports of what<br />
he described as of a purely speculative character, that there<br />
would be the imposition of quantitative restrictions on about<br />
items. Mr. McEwen said there was no intention of substituting<br />
a widespread system of import licensing for the temporary tariff<br />
system. He added that he would make a statement within the<br />
next few days in further explanation of the Prime Minister's<br />
announcement that the Government intended establishing a<br />
Special Adviscry Authority. Mr. McEwen stated that the<br />
Governm~ nt's policy in this regard was designed to operate<br />
within the framework of the Tariff Board but in such a manner<br />
as tc -armit decisions being quickly reached and quickly applied.<br />
