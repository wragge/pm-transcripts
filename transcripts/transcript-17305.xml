    <content><![CDATA[<p>PM: Well good morning animal lovers one and all- from Abby the dog, and all the pooches out there. They tell me last year that we had 3500 canines doing the RSPCA Million Paws Walk. And they're all- I think there are 3600 here this morning, from what I can see. This is a great day for the RSPCA. It's a great day for Canberra. And it's a great day for all creatures great and small.</p>
<p>This little one of ours, Abby, a Golden Retriever, she makes up so much of our family life at home. As I look down at the faces of all the little kids here today and of family pets who are loved and are part of their families, they make such a huge difference to us as human beings. The big thing is this- animals love us without question. The big question for us is how do we care for animals without question. And what the RSPCA is on about is looking after animals, making sure we exercise our duty of care and responsibility to animals, because they have no choice.</p>
<p>So folks, thank you for being out here in such wonderful numbers today. I was told last year we had 9000 people walking, 3500 dogs, five Ferrets, and one Alpaca. Hands up, the Aplaca this morning. Can't see the Aplaca this morning. Anyone bring a Ferrett? No one's brought a Ferrett. Jasper, our cat, has decided wisely to stay at home.</p>
<p>Folks, have a wonderful day, and may this RSPCA Million Paws Walk remind the whole country, Australia, of our duty of care to animals.</p>
<p>I thank you.</p>
