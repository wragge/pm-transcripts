    <content><![CDATA[<p>AUSTRALIAN-AMERICAN ASSOCIATION<br />ANNIVERSARY DINNER HELD AT MELBOURNE 29TH OCTOBER. 1965<br />Statement by the Prime Minister, Sir Robert Menzies<br />Sir and Ladies and Gentlemen<br />May I first of all enter a caveat about this word<br />" Oration". Now having like some of you leairned a little Latin<br />and less Greek which puts us on the same footing as Shakespeare<br />I know about the Oratio Recta and the Oratio Obliqua have any<br />of you forgotten that? I hope so, because that will give me a<br />spourraitoiuosn reputIa dtino'nt foprr oploesaer nitnog om ake Buatn oIr adtoino'nt; likIe jutshti s wawnotr dto<br />talk to you a little about one or two things, but before I talk<br />to you about one or two things, may I just mention something about<br />one or two people.<br />First of all, I would like to say that it gives me great<br />satisfaction to sit here comfortably and listen to Weslev Ince<br />making a speech, because he and I were at school together.<br />You would never believe it of course, because, really, Wesley's a<br />cultivated fellow and I'm a politician, but we were at school<br />tcgether, and he's been a friend of mine ever since which does<br />him infinite credit. And therefore Wesley, I was delighted to<br />be able to hear you speaking tonight so admirably, if you'll<br />allow me to say so.<br />And then of course Floyd Blair, a reticent character,<br />is here from the United States. No some of you may have<br />forgotten that Floyd Blair is a merchant banker. Now this is<br />a very mysterious occupation. And he arrived in Australia what<br />was it Floyd? about a year ago, and had a press interview.<br />You Imow the passion that Americans have for press interviews,<br />and so Floyd had one. And he encountered a cross-examiner who<br />for the first time in his experience or mine wanted to know<br />something. And the cross-examiner said ' Ae. t is a merchant<br />banker, Mr. Blair?" And he said, " Oh, that's quite simple.<br />You see there's a fellow over here who has money to invest, and<br />there's a fellow over here would like some money to be invested<br />by somebody, and so we bring them together and as the mone<br />crosses the board, we take a little out of it for our own dividend."<br />Now I must say Floyd, that was the first time I ever understood<br />merchant banking to perfection. But having said that, which may<br />be deroagatory for all I know though I don't intend it to be.<br />I want To tell all of my fellow Australians here, that if there's<br />one man who has been the moving spirit of the American Australian<br />Association in New York, it's Floyd Blair. He's a wonderful man<br />and a great friend, and I am, as I'm sure you are, delighted to<br />have him here tonight.<br />Then there's one more preliminary observation that I<br />might like to make and that is that you had a message from Lord<br />and Lady Casey. It's a marvellous event in Australian history that<br />they should now be at Government House. We're all delighted about<br />this. And the news of the appointment of Lord Casey to be Governor-<br />General must have given particular pleasure, I think, in Washington,<br />because he was our first diplomatic representative in the United<br />States. I don't believe that anybody ever did more I doubt if<br />anybody did as much to interpret Australia to the United States<br />as he did. And therefore, now that he sits in the highest position<br />that is available in this country, as Governor-General of Australia,<br />I like to feel that he will continue to be a symbol of the association<br />between our two countries. / 2</p>
<p>-2-<br />And of course Lady Casey irrespective of him she's been<br />the President of the iomen's Section you mustn't hold me u on<br />a technical point on this matter. But she has been, and with<br />immense success. So that this association here in the United<br />States and this conjunction of the planets in the minds of a man<br />like myself, have their embodiment today at Government House at<br />Canberra. I just want to mention that because I'm sure you would<br />all want to send your greetings to them, and your thanks to them.<br />As for the Cinque Ports, well, I'd like to tell you in case<br />you haven't heard it, inough I've done my best to promulgate the<br />idea. The other morning when the radio announced thisTppointment,<br />a man rushed out of his filling station at Canberra to a happy<br />passer-by who wanted five gallons of petrol and said, " Have you<br />heard the news? " No, what news?", said the fellow very drily.<br />All that he knew was that he wanted five gallons at an extravagant<br />price he thought. And the garage-keeper said, " But Sir Robert<br />has been made Lord Warden of Singapore." Now I " ould like to make<br />it quite clear that this is confidential. I wouldn't want my<br />distinguished colleague, Mr. Lee of Singapore, to know about his<br />because it might involve me mightn't it in some obligations but<br />there it is, so treat me witn respect I'm the Lord Warden of<br />Singapore. And the other preliminary remark I thought I'd like to make<br />to you was this, that years ago eight or nine years ago having<br />made a powerful speech at the Pilgrims, this most celebrated society<br />in London, I was invited to be the guest of honour of the Pilgrims<br />in New York at the Waldorf-Astoria. Six hundred men and women, if<br />not all Daughters and Sons of the Revolution, at least all impeccable<br />and I know I was the guest of honour, because it said so on the<br />menu. And being the guest of honour, I thought well I must as I<br />have tonight, give a little thought to what Im to say and<br />prepared a pretty powerful lucubration, you see. Well, before all<br />this happened...... you know, in the United States of America if<br />I may say so, Floyd, you are devoted to gadgets, and one of the<br />gadgets this night was a sort of lectern, which rose or fell and<br />it had buttons cn it marked " up" or " down". And in my colonial<br />innocence, I thought " up" meant up with the noise, and ' Rown' meant<br />down with the noise but it turned out no. It was up with the whole<br />jolly machine. And I almost had my neck broken, you see, two or<br />three times when I pressed the wrong button.<br />But anyhow there were some powerful speeches made as there<br />always are in the United States of America. Nobody will ever say<br />that the United States of America failed for want of being vocal,<br />and so two or three people made speeches. One or two of them I<br />thought were quite acceptable, and then up got a distinguished<br />Minister as we would call him he was one of the secretaries of<br />one of the departments and he made a powerful speech about me for<br />ten minutes. So flattering that I knew instantly that he didn't<br />know me, but I was none the less pleased on that account and having<br />done this, and I was beginning to purr and thinking, well, now<br />this where I get up and hope to press the right button, he put his<br />hand up like that, and one of his speech writers they have those<br />animals, you know, Floyd in your country he came along with a<br />typed script, and for half an hour, I listened to a learned<br />discussion on automation.<br />Well, I'm of course many things, and possess a great variety<br />of talents no doubt, but I'm not automatic. But this was half an<br />hour on automation, and at the end of this time, all the men out<br />of the Sons of the Revolution were down like this. Some of them<br />had their heads right down on the table, others were half way and<br />the women, with that diabolical faculty with which God Almighty has<br />endowed women, were sitting up, bolt upright, with their eyes open</p>
<p>3-<br />and sound asleep. Oh yes, this is a form of feminine genius<br />and all I know is that when at twenty to eleven what's the time<br />low? when at twenty to eleven, I, the guest of honour I repeat,<br />so described on the bill of lading got up to speaki the men were<br />in that comatose state that I've described, the women like this<br />and for the first ten minutes I had to put on a music hall turn<br />in order to wake them up. ' ell, after all, that's what I've<br />been doing for the last five minutes.<br />Now having said all those things for what they are worth<br />I would like tonight, without being quite as long as John suggested,<br />I would like to say something because this is the twenty-fifth<br />anniversary, and we're living in a state of affairs in the world<br />in which the relations between the United States and Australia, and<br />indeed between the United States and the entire free world, have<br />never been more important and have never been more urgent.<br />And so, I would like to offer a few views on them.<br />I don't know whether you realise that today is October 29th.<br />Well, from October 15th to November 15th was duclared by the<br />Communist Party at Hanoi in North Viet Nam to be a special<br />propaganda month, and it was to be described as the Hate America<br />Month. Now this is not fiction, this is it the Hate America<br />Month, from October 15th to November 15th. And in the result,<br />Sir, identical demonstrations have been put on in most of the<br />capitals of the world, including great cities in Australia, based<br />on this slogan Hate America; Down With America. What's America<br />Doing In Viet Nam? What's America Doing Intervening in the Affairs<br />of the World? Hate America. You know this is a horrible,<br />horrible slogan. It's a reat pity that it receives so much<br />free publicity all round the world the Hate America Monthwhereas<br />any people who are sensible, who are sensible of individual<br />liberty, who are sensible of the tremendous issues that divide the<br />world, could well be excused if they had a Thank America Month,<br />not a Hate America Month.<br />We are in this time constantly hearing pleas that we should<br />negotiate for peace in Viet Nam and that we should persuade the<br />United States to give up bombing in Viet Nam. Now I've heard this,<br />you've heard this; there are so many people, decent people,<br />misguided people, including soae clerical people who join in this<br />cry You must make peace in Viet Nam. And it's about time we<br />sorted outselves out and decided how you make peace in Viet Nam.<br />About time we sorted our ideas out and discovered for ourselves,<br />and, I hope, for other people, why it is that the United States<br />which five years ago would have hesitated a long time before putting<br />a single ground force on to the Asian Continent, now has 200,000<br />fighting there. hy has this happened? Is this because the<br />United States has some axe to grind?<br />This just makes me ill when I hear people who ought to know<br />better accusing the United States of America of pursuing some<br />selfish interest. What selfish interest? Do they want to make<br />South Viet Nam a colony, Really ladies and gentlemen, who wants<br />a new colony today? Of course it isn't because they want a colony.<br />Is it because they have overwhelming commercial interests? Of<br />course they haven t. It just happens, and I'll come back to this<br />before I finish that the United States of America today has<br />accepted and acted upon policies which, I believe set an example<br />to the modern world in unselfishness and responsibility.<br />Now perhaps it's not a bad idea on these matters to try<br />to settle our minds on a few first principles. Would you mind if<br />I mentioned one or two? I don't want to be too tedious on a happy<br />night like this. But in a civilised world, every nation is</p>
<p>-4-<br />entitled, in the immortal words of the American Declaration of<br />Independence, to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness.<br />This wasn't something that Thomas Jefferson wrote just for the<br />American colonists. This was something that was written as it<br />turns out, for the entire world. We're all entitled to life,<br />liberty and the pursuit of happiness. These are very simple<br />things. They are not aggressive things, they are homely things.<br />They are the kind of things that in our own families we all<br />understand life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. And<br />what's happened is that above all people, theadministration of the<br />United States of America have said, if not in terms at least by<br />implication, that this is true for the people of South Viet Nam,<br />just as it was true for the people of Virginia and Ca'rolina life,<br />liberty and the pursuit of happiness.<br />And that being so, our second great principle is that each<br />nation has the right, the right to defend itself against aggression<br />and to call on its friends to help it. Does anybody quarrel with<br />that? So far I've not heard that anybody does. Buc when any<br />nation our own nation, Austr-iia hs to decide its answer to<br />that call for help then it has to answer itself a few questions,<br />and I thought about this a great deal before I did,<br />Some of you may recall the Jefferson Lecture at Monticello<br />a couple of years back. Do you mind if I engage in the poor<br />exercise of quoting one paragraph of what I said on that occasion?<br />I said: " The freedom or man ( this was a good topic in the home of<br />Thomas Jefferson), the freedom of man is not a local perquisite,<br />and it can't be defended in isolation." Now that remains true.<br />It isn't a local perquisite. It's not good enough, it would never<br />have been good enough for the United States to say " Well, as long<br />as we preserve our freedom, t doesn't matter about the rest."<br />It would never be good enough for us in Australia to say " As long<br />as we defend our freedom and preserv iithat's good enough." Because<br />freedom is one of the great human things in the world, and it can't<br />be defended in isolation.<br />Now all these principles have been recognised both by the<br />United States and by Australia. And it Is because of their belief,<br />their belief and our belief in these principles, that we have<br />Australian forces, small enough in all conscience, operating in<br />South Viet Nam, and the United States has vast forces operating<br />there. And yet the presence of both of those forces is today in<br />our own country, and in many other countries under attack.<br />The Hate America Week has been reproduced in Australia.<br />' ho are the people who attack it? Will I understand when the<br />Communists attack it? Because the Communists in this issue in the<br />world are the aggressors and nobody seriously disputes it. Nobody.<br />On either side of Parliament at Canberra, nobody disputes it,<br />nobody denies it. But the Communists of course believe, particularly<br />those who are allied with Peking, that the withdrawal of<br />American forces would mean the collapse of successful resistance,<br />and therefore would mean Chinese Communism trium~ imt in South East<br />Asia. This is not oversimplifying it. This is so profoundly<br />true. It's perfectly understood in Washington. It is not perfectly<br />understood by some of the critics and agitators in Australia.<br />If the United States walked out of South Viet Nam and we<br />walked out with them not that we are a major factor what do<br />you suppose would happen? How lng would South Viet Nam last?<br />How long would it take to have Chinese Communism triumphant on the<br />very edges of the Sunda Straits? This is the great issue of our<br />time and we in Australia are indeed fortunate that we should have<br />had in the United States of America a predominant view that accepted<br />the responsibility for saying this must not happen. Because if<br />it does happen then we can give up exercising ourselves about who</p>
<p>is going to win the cup next Tuesday. we'll have to begin to<br />exercise ourselves very fiercely about whether we are to be here<br />self-governing, free, at all. This is not an extravagant statement.<br />This is an extremely sober and considered statement.<br />Now as a matter of fact you'll be told by some people,<br />including some who ought to know better, that what's going on in<br />Viet Nam is just a sort of civil war, there's a sruggle for freedom.<br />And they are not incapable of telling you that this resembles the<br />struggle by the American Colonies themselves in the late years of<br />the eighteerth century. This is a struggle for freedom. 7ell,<br />fortunately the facts on that are very clear because the South<br />Viet Nam liberation Front, as it's called they've started one in<br />Viet Nam; I haven't yet heard that they've started one in Australia,<br />but no doubt they will but the South Viet Nam Liberation Front was<br />established in 1960 by the North Viet Nam Communist Party. It is<br />their puppet. It is their instrument, and in order to make this quite<br />clear, the commander-in-chief in North Viet Nam as recently as March<br />in this year said " The problem of the peaceful reunification of<br />Viet Nam is the affair o the Vietnamese people". So far so gcod,<br />on the face of it.<br />" It will be settled" he went on to say " by the Viet Nam<br />' Fatherland Front' ( that's the major Communist Party) and the ' South<br />Viet Nam Liberation Front'". In other words, this will be settled<br />by the Communists and no non-Communist need apply. This is perfectly<br />clear. This is not a strange exercise of my ojn. This has been<br />repeated time after time by the Foreign Minister of Great Britain<br />whose party is not my party. This is not a party affair. The<br />other day he made a speech in Tokyo in which he reiterated the same<br />thing, Michael Stewart did that here is a crude demand by the<br />Communists of North Viet Nam that they shall be in charge of the<br />future of South Viet Nam and therefore of course never forget it<br />of the future of Thailand the future of Malaysia the future of<br />Singapore, the future of Indonesia and, and thenheret'hse big<br />questaon, the future of Australia?<br />And are we to be content to allow these dreadful things to<br />happen leaving them alone, being frightfully high minded, leaving<br />them alone until the day comes when at the very end of the line we<br />find ourselves defending ourselves on our own shores? Of course<br />we shall do it, of course, but should we? Should we allow ourselves<br />to be beguiled by these people who want us to believe that this is<br />just a little civil conflict in South Viet Nam? I believe, Sir, I<br />believe most profoundly, that all of those who are agitating on<br />this matter in Australia are consciously or unconsciously, and I hope<br />most of them unconsciously, are trying to weaken the national will in<br />Australia by propagating doubts as to the justice of our actions, and<br />of course, American action in South Viet Nam, for no other purpose,<br />no other intelligible purpose than to weaken the resistance to<br />aggression in this part of the world.<br />Now Sir, I've spoken already rather longer than I intended to,<br />but could I add two things? Every now and then somebody says to me.<br />in a very well-meaning way " But why don't you favour negotiations?<br />Why don' tyou favour peace?" And could say for mysel and for all<br />of you " Of course we favour peace, just as the United States favours<br />peace. But who stands in the way of negotiations for peace? Who<br />is it? I wish people would just read and reread the sober history<br />of events in the last two years. There must have been thirteen or<br />fourteen or fifteen attempts made on our side of the world to secure<br />a negotiation. The United States, the United Nations, the Prime<br />Ministers' Conference,( the last one that I attended when we set up<br />a mission to go), the seventeen unaligned nations; Tito in Yugoslavia<br />1. a strange but fruitful alliance as I would have thought with<br />India. Time after time, and every time Peking and Hanoi have said, / 6</p>
<p>-6-<br />" Nonsense, ve won't talk," and they have usually rejected these<br />approaches with contempt and with insult. This is the great thing<br />to remember, that in the whole of this period of two or three years<br />when decent human beings in both our countries have just been<br />sweating over this matter and hating the idea of a war that might<br />be avoidable not one word has come from the aggressor to indicate<br />that he would even talk about it. You may understand, I'm sure<br />you do how I feel when people of eminence, here or there or there,<br />write to me and say, " Why don't you negotiate?" The answer being,<br />of course, I would negotiate, my Government would negotiate, the<br />United States Administration would, the British Government would at<br />the dro of a handkerchief, if the other man said " I am . illing to<br />negotiate.' But of course he's not. He has made it quite clear<br />that as long as he think he is winning by violence and terror, he<br />won't talk. And that's why in plain simple English the United States<br />of America is so profoundly right, and we in our smaller way are so<br />profoundly right in saying, " Very well, as he won't talk until he<br />knows he can' win, it s our job to beat him."<br />Now the last thing that I want to say to you rather<br />reproduces something I said in my own Parliament not long ago.<br />I'm no servile follower of United States policy. I'm happy to say<br />that in my time I've been on such terms with all the American<br />Administratiors that I could say what I thought even in terms of<br />disagreement and have it listened to. h'-it the United States has<br />done with Australia in these years is treat Australia as being an<br />adult country with a point of view that is worth listening to.<br />And therefore we've always been able to disagree on details the<br />press vies on details, but on the central things that determine the<br />future of mankind, we ve been happy enough to find ourselves in<br />complete unison with them. This, I think, is of tremendous<br />importance. However, it will be all the more important to our own people<br />if they will just remember one great central fact. It's one of<br />the great facts of modern history. Not a matter of whether<br />Australia likes the United States because it has a sort of cupboard<br />love for the United States. This is one of the great central<br />facts of modern history. In this century the United States of<br />America has had prolonged periods of isolationism, and it has<br />been jolted out of them twice by the terrors and horrors of war.<br />And one of the great things of our time has been that ever since<br />that happened for the second time in the second great war, the<br />United States has without hesitation moved into a position of<br />supreme power, carrying with it the aclmowledgment of supreme<br />responsibility. This is the most terrific thing in our modern time.<br />If the United States had simply been the greatest power in<br />the world, the greatest arms power, the greatest nuclear power,<br />the greatest industrial power, and it sat back and said ' Well,<br />that s rather nice isn't it, we're the great power this would<br />have been a terrible thing. But ever since 1941, the United States<br />has cheerfully and sometimes under great criticism accepted the<br />responsibilities that go with great power. It pours out aid, it<br />pours out assistance of every kind. It does it with such<br />generosity, a generosity of its own taxpayers, never let us forget.<br />It does it with such generosity and so frequently, that a lot of<br />us are disposed to say, " Oh well, you can take this for granted.<br />Ask America tbdo this, ask America to provide that.' Look, this<br />is not true. The American people are just like us in Australia.<br />They don't like paying taxes unduly. Of course not but they have<br />through all these years accepted the responsibility that goes with<br />power and the result is that in all these other parts of the world<br />what the United States has done and is doing deserves not miserable / 7</p>
<p>7<br />carping criticism but an intelligent understanding. This is<br />something that fits into tne broad structure of the defence of<br />freedom which, in the long run make no mistake, is our own defence.<br />And therefore it is not difficult for th6 head of a Government in<br />Australia to find himself en rapport with the head of an administration<br />in the United States; not difficult at all for people<br />like myself to understand that Australian-American association,<br />Anglo-american association is no longer a post-prandial bit of<br />enthusiasm, but something which is the very stuff of life for<br />all of us and not only for us, but for other people.<br />Now I'm sorry to have s oken for so lonr, and perhaps so<br />seriously about ', his matter, but I just wanted to convey to you<br />the feeling of distaste I have when people want to promote a<br />" Hate America Week", when people cash in on the easy temptation<br />to throw stones at the rich relative. This is so easy, we all<br />know all about it. And yet it is on this association, this<br />" marriage of minds", this " marriage of passions", this " marriage<br />of understanding" that the future of all your children and<br />grandchildren will depend.</p>
