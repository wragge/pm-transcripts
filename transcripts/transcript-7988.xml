TRANSCRIP~ T OF INTERVIEW WITH JOHN I1AWS, RADIO 2US<br />
THURSDAY, 22 MARCH 1990<br />
EW9 PROOF ONLY<br />
LAWS: But in the meantime, miy guest in the studio, the Prime<br />
Minister of Australia, Bob Hawke. Good morning and welcome.<br />
PM: Thank you very much, John. Pleasure to be with you.<br />
LAWS: Good or bad at the moment do you reckon?<br />
PM: Oh, I think we're going along reasonably well. As you know,<br />
I never got cocky or complacent about elections. I've done the<br />
best job I can in the campaign, John, and I'll1 continue to do<br />
that until late tomorrow night.<br />
LAWS: Any regrets about the campaign? Any areas whereu you think<br />
you might have been a bit light on? Any things you think you<br />
should have brought up earlier and didn't?<br />
PM: I think if I could have it all over again, there wouldn't<br />
be much different, John. I mean, obviously you don't do a<br />
campaign perfectly. There's some things here and there that you<br />
may have done a little bit differently. But substantially, I<br />
think, I've tried to get the balance between being positive,<br />
* telling Australians about the vision I have for Australia and how<br />
we can get there, the good things about this country. And I've<br />
also had to discharge that part of the responsibility of pointing<br />
out what I think are the weaknesses of my opponent and their<br />
positions. I hope I've got the balance right,<br />
LAWS: Yeah. The National Account figures, Paul Keating calls<br />
them, pd I was fascinated with his phraseology, a ' beautiful set<br />
of numbers';% others are saying we're in the first stage of a<br />
recession and certainly by technical definition we're halt way<br />
there, aren't we?<br />
PM: Well, the technical definition is two quarters in a row of<br />
negative growth. well, of courser the quarter before this last<br />
one we had 0.9 percent positive growth. we'Ive had about 4<br />
percent for the year. And you've got that large statistical<br />
discrepancy of 0.9. That, when it's redistributed an they are<br />
in later quarters, could quite possibly have us into positive </p>
<p>., I. l growth. LAWS: Yeah, but i mean<br />
PM! Really, really, what we've got, John, is a situation where<br />
tight interest rates have done their 4ob. I mean, we had to have<br />
tight interebt rates, you and I have talked about this, we had<br />
to have them tight ( yeah) to slow things down because we couldn't<br />
sustain that level of imports. They've done their job and<br />
without any doubt I can assure your listeners, John, if we're<br />
returned there will be very, very quickly a further reduction in<br />
interest rates ( yeah) because the high rates have done their job.<br />
LAWS: Okay. Well we'll get back to that in just a moment.<br />
PM: Sure, sure.<br />
LAWS: But, in the meantime, by technical definitiun, we are half<br />
way Into a recessioni, aren't we?<br />
PM: Yeah, if this, it in the next, when the figures come out<br />
next and they revise this quarter, if this quarter stil~ l stays<br />
at that just in negative at 0.2. But what I'm saying is, with<br />
that large statistical discrepancy, that m~ ay be revised to<br />
positive. But if, you're right, I mean, if this were to be<br />
confirmed and then you've got another quarter of it, that would<br />
technically be the case.<br />
LAWS; Yeah. But, I mean, as it stands on this very day we've<br />
had one out of two quarters that have shown we're not in great<br />
shape, except in one way we are in great shape..<br />
PM: We are in great shape.<br />
LAWS: because you've achieved -what you wanted to achieve.<br />
But technically two quarters indicates that we're in a recession.<br />
Now one quarter has indicated that. So technically there isn't<br />
any arguing the fact that we are half way into a recession?<br />
PH4: If you've got another quarter that would be technically<br />
right. But what we've had to do and what I think Australians<br />
understand ib Lhat We couldn't keep the level of growth going<br />
before that was bringing in all those imports. And so what we've<br />
got in these figures, John, is precisely what we wanted to see.<br />
We haA that big gap, there was an, before there was an 8 percent<br />
growth in consumption and a 4 percent growth in production.<br />
LAWS: Oh, yeah, no, I understand you brought those<br />
PH: And we've got those<br />
LAWS: Together.<br />
PM: So interest rates have done its job. No0w we can bring<br />
interest rates down and 1I'm sure that, in the jargon of the </p>
<p>-3-<br />
economists, there's a soft Idnding. We're goinlg to continue to<br />
have growL; arid employment growth. sut, in a sustainable way,<br />
the big thing is what Australia's doing now, it's putting so much<br />
more of its productive effort into export~ s.<br />
LAWS: Okay. Now you've stopped spending and that was the<br />
intention, wasn't it, to cut down spending?<br />
PH: To slow it down, yes.<br />
LAWS: Yeah, to slow it down. You've not slowed down, however,<br />
Government spending?<br />
PM: On the contrary, John, on the contrary, that just isn't<br />
right. we've done, for the first time ever in the history of<br />
this country, we've got the fourth successive year of real<br />
reductions in Government spending.<br />
LAWS: So you maintain you have cut~ Government spending?<br />
PM: Well, not, no, T mean, you ask any economist, we have. I<br />
mean, the fact that Dr 2Iewson, who has abandoned the integrity<br />
of being an economist and Is just tioundering around as a<br />
prejudiced politician, every economist acknowledges. I mean, you<br />
ask any economist, has this Government cut Government spending<br />
in real termis? Answer yes. rour years in a row, an 8 percent<br />
turnaround, equivalent to $ 30 billion turnaround of our demands<br />
upon the public saving~ s.<br />
LAWS: Okay. But consumer spending hasn't gone down though, has<br />
PM: Consumer spending. Consumer spending -no. it's up a<br />
little bit, but the rate of increases has'-been bought about to<br />
acceptable levels.<br />
LAWS: Okay. Well if consumer spending has gone up a little bit<br />
which y'ou can see, then surely it means that where we have<br />
reduced h spending must be in the area of investment?<br />
pzM: yeah, investment, but it had to come back. I Mean, every<br />
economist will tell you that the rate of investment growth was<br />
at simply unacceptably high, I mean, you couldn't keep, YOU<br />
01o'Idn't sustain it at those levels.<br />
LAWS; Well, how did that come about in the first instance?<br />
PM: Well, well, it came about because of the massive shift from<br />
wages to profits which was engineered with the agreement of the<br />
trade union movement so that we could get an investment boom.<br />
what we had to have was a restructuring of our industry. SO we<br />
shifted from wages to profits, profits went into record<br />
inveetment. Last year 13.5 percent business investment at the<br />
highest ever recorded. And that has meant that our restructured<br />
economy is doing things now that it's never been able to do </p>
<p>-4-<br />
before. I mean, we've had, john, this mausive increase in the<br />
exports of manufactur. ed goods.<br />
LAWS: That's right. And it all happened very quickly. And, I<br />
mean, you created that environment and you, 1 note, are 1 suppose<br />
in many ways justifiably proud of it where people were<br />
investing, where people were expanding, where people ware<br />
employing, 93 percent was in the private sector.<br />
PH: In the private sector.<br />
LAWS: But now It seems to me that the private sector, who in<br />
fact employed 93 percent, so 93 percent of your good figures of<br />
1.6 million improvement in employmnent, was employed by the<br />
private sector. But it would appear to me from what we're<br />
reading and what we're seeing and what those figures showed<br />
yesterday that d lot. Of the private sector has got .2 lot of<br />
worries? PM: It is the case that when you blow the economy down, and the<br />
93 percent was of the 1.6 million increase in jobs, 93 percent<br />
in the private sector, it still, if you take the economy as a<br />
whole, it's, the private sector accounts for, you know, between<br />
and 80 percent of total employment.<br />
LAWS Yeah.<br />
PM: And obviously when you've -got to slow things down in the<br />
economy, the private sector will take its share. And I've said<br />
in my policy speech, I know there's been some hardship,-but i had<br />
the alternative as a responsible Prime Minister, John, of doing<br />
one of two things.<br />
LAWS., Yeah. And I understand that.<br />
PM: I could have said, okay, let the thing blow. Now if I'd<br />
have let it blow, then you would have had what the Libs left us<br />
with in ' 83 the worst recession in fifty years. 1 couldn't do<br />
that.<br />
LAWS: Yeah, but I understand that. But, as I gay, you created<br />
this environment that you're proud of, that your Government is<br />
proud of, it's not fair to just say you, the Government created<br />
MXe environment of which you're proud. 93 percent of the<br />
employment came from the private sector, but now the private<br />
sector is in dreadful trouble. I mean, investment, that's where<br />
the spending has dropped in the area of investment?<br />
PM: No, but look, John, at the most recent statistics in terms<br />
of the next year. The business sector has said it's expecting<br />
a nominal increase in invtetment of 33 percent in 1991.<br />
LAWS: Yeah, but people are hurting flow?<br />
PM: There is some hurt now, John. But, John, you can't, yOU </p>
<p>can't have.<br />
LAWS; But you created the hurt?<br />
PM: But, . Yohn, you can't have It both ways. We can't have a<br />
situation where we' re told Dy your listeners, rightly so, ( yeah)<br />
that they're worried about the growth of debt and our current<br />
account deficit and the growth of imports. We can't have that<br />
worry and not do something about it. And the only way to s1ow<br />
down that massive growth of imports was to slow economic activity<br />
down and it you slow economic activity down, sorne people got<br />
hurt. LAWS: Some people huve got to get hurt. Yeah. But you created<br />
the environment where they went out and invested, they went out<br />
and employed, then they got hit with high interest rates. So<br />
really you have created the hurt t. hat exists now, well<br />
intentioned though it may have been, but your Government has<br />
created the hurt that these people are feeling now?<br />
PM: Well, what has happened, we created the conditions for<br />
growth. LAWBI Yes.<br />
PM: That's right.<br />
LAWS; Then they grew too quickly.<br />
PM: And the economy grew too fast. And I'Ive said quite<br />
honestly, John, I mean, I say it again to your listeners because<br />
I have the greatest respect for their concern about these things.<br />
LIke every other economist in Australia, 1 and the Government,,<br />
early last year, we under-estimated the strength, or at the end<br />
of ' 88 and into $ 89, we under-estimated the actual strength of<br />
the economy.<br />
LAWS; Mistake?<br />
PM: I mean, every private economist, every public economist, and<br />
we were part of it and I concede that.<br />
LAWS: Mistake?<br />
PM: Yeah, we didn't see early enough the strength of 9rowth.<br />
If we had had the benefit of hindsighte we would have applied the<br />
brakes a little bit earlier. But I've been honest about that,<br />
I've said it time and time again. I mean, every economist in the<br />
country was wrong in our estimates of the strength of demand.<br />
It wee growing stronger than we appreciated.<br />
LAWS: Okay. Well now some people might argue and are, inl fact,<br />
arguing that you have now deliberately, not you, the Government,<br />
has do 1 berately pushed the economy towards recession? </p>
<p>-6-<br />
PdMo: w n. No, w e cebretliaeivnel, y nwoitt. h thWee ' vme ajdoerliityb eroaft eelcyo nsolmoiwsetsd# ththe ate cwoen'olmly<br />
got, in the jargon of the trade, a soft landing which means that<br />
we believe that economic growth will continue and employment<br />
growth will continue, but at a level where what will be happening<br />
is that more of our production will be going into net exports.<br />
When we talk about net exports we 4imply mean going into exports<br />
and imports replacement. And that's what we need to happen.<br />
LAWS: Yeah. Can I say this to you. Back there you said about<br />
our exports having eCSalated. If our exports have been that<br />
good, why is the balance of payments so bad?<br />
PM: Well, because, as we wore moving to greater performance in<br />
exports, we still had the backlog of this high level of imports.<br />
But what's happening now, if you look at the figures for, the<br />
most recent figures, then we have moved into a plus position<br />
that our net exports has improved. That is, our rate Of<br />
improvement in export growth is better than what's happening in<br />
imports. T mean, you see, imports are a lagged thing and they<br />
represent o~ rders that were made, you know, a long time ago.<br />
They've been growing. But now we can see that import. are<br />
tailing off and i! you look at the...<br />
LAWS: How can imports be really tailing off if consumer spending<br />
! s up? I mean, what I'm trying to say is the balance is in the<br />
wrong area, isn't it, the balance i~ n the investment area?<br />
PM: WellI I mean, I can give you, I mean, if you like I can give<br />
you the figures. I mean, I don't know whether you want me to go<br />
into the details of the figures, but 7. can do that in regard to<br />
what's happened on...<br />
L. AWS: No, well the detail isn't necessary. it's only the<br />
overall PM: Okay. But what I ' m saying is that the figures now Show,<br />
John, that we are movi. ng to a position where we, our growth of<br />
exports is accelerating and the balance of activity in the<br />
economy is moving more to a position where more of our production<br />
is going into net exports. More exports and more import<br />
substitution which is what happens when you get this slowing down<br />
and where we're getting the benefit now, John, of all that<br />
inlvestment in our industry. I mean, let me give you the<br />
statistics. in the last four years where we've seen, starting<br />
to see the benefit of this investment in our industry, we've had<br />
a 54 percent increase in manufactured exports. I mean, the<br />
classic example of it, John, is steel. I mean, that's where we<br />
as Australians are entitled to be very proud, all of us, because,<br />
all of them, it's not oust Government. You know, when we came<br />
to off ice, as you know, Bit? was going to shut down the steel<br />
industry. Now we saidi that's, I'm not going to accept that. So<br />
we negotiated with Sill and the unions and in the result now we<br />
have a world competitive steel Industry. In this last year,<br />
John, exported three-quarters of a billion, dollars of steel into </p>
<p>all the competitive markets and that's going to treble by 1992.<br />
LAWS: Okay. But it doesn't get back, it doesn't alter the fact<br />
that if our exports art up, why aren't our balance of payment<br />
figures batter?<br />
PM: Well, because I was saying, we still had a position where<br />
we had high levels of imports, we had high levels of imports.<br />
What's happening though is that they are now coming back<br />
LAWS; And when will we see the result of this though. How<br />
long's it going to take?<br />
PM: Well, I believe that we can see, getting into a<br />
stabilivation of our external position inl something like three<br />
years. Now let m~ e explain just briefly what that means. We've<br />
got to get to a point where the current account def icit is<br />
running at a level which doesn't increase your aggregate of debt.<br />
We did that right though the 1970' u, running at about, with a<br />
current account deficit of about 2 1/ 2 percent of gross domestic<br />
product. I don't want to sound too complex, but that was the<br />
sort of f i ure. In the most recent few years that current<br />
account deficit has moved up to about 6 percent. So we had a 3<br />
1/ 2 percent, you know, figure that we had to pull back.<br />
LAWS: Okay. Now look I understand all these figures are<br />
Important, but you also understand they're very difficult to<br />
understand.<br />
PM: Yeah and that'Is why I don't want to get into it in detail.<br />
LAWS: Okay, so let's<br />
PM: But i had to, it's very difficult to answer your question<br />
without saying what's happened and how we are now#-9<br />
LAWS: Yeah. Well, you're saying it's likely all to come about<br />
in three years?<br />
PM: Oh, what I'm saying, it's our assessment that within three<br />
years, because of what's happening in the Australian economy<br />
where we are showing ourselves more capable of exporting and more<br />
capable of substituting with our own production f or imports, that<br />
we V111 have a deficit on our current account of a much smaller<br />
proportion which will not add to debt and which will gradually<br />
allow us to run debt down.<br />
LAWS:, Okay. Does that mean that people are going to have to<br />
suffer for another three years?<br />
PM: No, no, no. on the contrary, on the contrary, it doesn't<br />
because our estimate for this year, john, is that there'll be<br />
increases in real -Income for people. That will come f rom a<br />
combination ot wage increases ( yeah) and tax cuts. </p>
<p>-8-<br />
LAWS: Okay. What do you say to Nobby tlarki-assume you've<br />
been alerted of what he's had to say, head of the National<br />
Australia Bank. He claims your monetary policy is irrelevant,<br />
stupid and unconscionable, managed in a way that would make<br />
Atilla the Hun look like a nanny at a Sundayschool picnic. Quite<br />
a turn of phrase, isn't it?<br />
PMH: Yeah, well, let me say this. That Nobby Clark's lack of<br />
impartiality in politics is one of the well-known features of the<br />
Australian scene. I content myself with referring to, I mean,<br />
if you've quoted Nobby ClarX, could I just quote just one or two<br />
other sort of figures. From the Commonwealth Bank, just a couple<br />
of days ago. They say the most recent figures, retail figures,<br />
confirm the softer trend which should prompt a further stepped<br />
easing in monetary policy. That's what will happen.<br />
LAWS: Well, obviously you'd rather cop that than Nobby Clark's<br />
comments? PM: Well, yeah, I'd certainly. Let'e also take the, let's take<br />
the Reuters screen just two days ago. I mean, this is not Nobby<br />
Clark, a player in the political scene and known to be a player,<br />
a Tory. Okay and Nobby's entitled to be a Tory and he's entitled<br />
to have his views. If he wants to espouse the Liberal cause,<br />
good on him. But let me quote the Reuters screen to you of two<br />
nights ago. Traders said credit markets ended the day firmer<br />
in anticipation of a further easing in monetary policy in the<br />
next few weeks assuming the Hawke Labor Government is re-elected<br />
at Saturday's federal election. I mean, what the market as a<br />
whole is saying -is that interest rates can come down provided<br />
that the Hawke Government is re-elected ( yeah) and i'll take the<br />
market instead of Nobby Clark's blatant politicing.<br />
LAWS: Okay. Well, Paul Keating says Nobby Clark's comments are<br />
an endorsement of your intention to pressure, use the word<br />
cautiously, the Reserve BanX into lowering interest rates. Now<br />
does that mean if Paul Keating has said that that's what it<br />
means, does that mean that Paul Keating agrees with Nobby Clark?<br />
PH: No, no, no. Nobby is saying that rates can come down. What<br />
I'm saying is that his critique of monetary policy stands<br />
uneasily. His critique of policy stands uneasily with the<br />
asscesment of the market that the Government's policies have<br />
worked, that they've been necessary, they're working now and<br />
that, as a result of these policies and assuming a return of the<br />
Hawke Government, we can get a lowering of rates. </p>
<p>LAWS: Yes, but surely if Paul Keating says Hobby Clark's<br />
comments are an endorsement of the intention you have to<br />
go to the Reserve Bank and lower interest rates. Doesn't<br />
that mean that Paul Keating agrees with what Nobby<br />
Clark's saying?<br />
PH4: Paul and I agree with Nobby in terms of him Baying<br />
that rates can come down, to the extent he says that, but<br />
to the extent that Nobby has been a critic of policy and<br />
this talk about Atilla the Hun, neither Paul Keating nor<br />
I endorse that.<br />
LAWS: The report that's been leaked from the<br />
Government's Bureau of Industry Economics says a quicker<br />
pace of adjustment including deregulation of the labour<br />
market could deliver average additional wages and so it<br />
goes. Now, what do you say to that<br />
PH: ( inaudible)<br />
LAWS: of that report being leaked? You know<br />
PM: I'll tell you what I say about the report. It<br />
wouldn't be a bad idea if the fellow, I think it's been<br />
Milne in The Australian, who's gone to I think it's<br />
M4ilne, yes, it is, Glenn Milne in The Australian<br />
LAWS: Yes.<br />
PHI Wouldn't be a bad idea if he went to the whole of<br />
the thing and pointed out that the paper, in f act,.<br />
contrasts tvo hypothetical scenarios, case one is where<br />
all policy stops and then case two is where a level<br />
playing field, as he put it, is created very quickly<br />
without taking account of any adjustment costs. Now<br />
what's the condition of this case two that they're<br />
talking about? The condition is, the assumption there is<br />
that you have in fact four times the growth in taxation,<br />
four timues the growth in taxation. Now it wouldn't be a<br />
bad idea if they spelt out the assumption in that and if<br />
you want to, you know, go to some of the parts of the<br />
paper which is purely a draft, hasn't been endorsed by<br />
the BIE, one of the areas I see from the report I have is<br />
they say in the later years of the l9BOs a host of<br />
industry policy reform issues were addressed<br />
LAWS: Why would<br />
PH: ( inaudible)<br />
LAWS: Why would the newspaper be so selective in what it<br />
published from that report?<br />
PM: Well you'd have to ask them wouldn't you?<br />
LAWS: Well, what do you think? </p>
<p>-IC)-<br />
PM-Well, I think that Mr Milne thinks he had a good<br />
story by putting it the way he did and. f air enough. But<br />
I'm simply saying that if people want to argue for that,<br />
take the assumption that's involved with-. the -four times<br />
increase in the, in the taxation that's involved. I<br />
don't think people would want that.<br />
LAWS: Yes. Every day, as you know, I talk to lots of<br />
people all over the place who are reaching desperation<br />
point. They can't meet mortgage payments, their food<br />
bills they maintain have gone through the roof and they<br />
have, they say that their standard of living has<br />
declined. They've had it with politicians and their<br />
promises generally. Now what can you say to those people<br />
that can give them some sort of hope and do you blame<br />
them for being cynical?<br />
PM: I don't blame people who've been huart from being<br />
angry and perhaps cynical. All I can say to them is<br />
this. I've devoted the whole of my adult life to public<br />
life, the whole of my public life has been devoted to<br />
trying to help people in the community. First as a<br />
research officer and advocate, advocate for the ACTJ, I<br />
put in 21 years of my life working to improve the<br />
conditions or people. Now I moved on to the<br />
parliamentary sphere to do the same thing. You look at<br />
the whole of Hawke's public career. It's not been about<br />
personal aggrandisement, it's been about trying to help<br />
others. The last thing I would do as a person who's<br />
whole life has been devoted to helping others who love<br />
this country. I wouldn't be about hurting people.<br />
LAWS: Deliberately.<br />
PM: Deliberately, no. I had a situation-<br />
LAWS: But do you, do you concede that they have been<br />
hurt? PM: Had a, had a position where my responsibility was to<br />
tighten things. I would have been irresponsible to the<br />
future of this country if I hadn't slowed things down.<br />
Now in answer specifically to your question, I simply ask<br />
them to ask themselves this question on 24th March you<br />
can have the re-election of a Hawke led Government which<br />
the markets is now saying will produce a reduction in<br />
interest rates because our policy works. Against that<br />
you can have Peacock as Prime Minister with the certainty<br />
that interest rates must explode because he's got no<br />
wages policy, wages will go through the root and he'll<br />
blow the budget surplus both of which must ruin the<br />
economy and put interest rates through the roof. N~ ow<br />
that's the alternative.<br />
LAWS: OK, now can I ask you this. You're saying and<br />
very clearly that within two weeks of the election that.<br />
you would bring interest rates down, that you'd be in </p>
<p>I I<br />
touch with the Reserve Bank and have a yarn to them.<br />
Isn't the Reserve Bank supposed to be independent?<br />
PM: No, under the legislation monetary policy is<br />
conducted, the combination of the Government and the<br />
Reserve Bank and if there is a conflict, in the end, the<br />
view of the Government prevails, but that, that conflict<br />
doesn't arise.<br />
LAWS: OK.<br />
PH: Well, we've been able in seven years to conduct<br />
policy amicably with the bank.<br />
LAWS: Well<br />
PM: But the important thing, John, the important thing,<br />
John, is what the market is saying. The market is saying<br />
I could give you more quotes, I've just given you some<br />
O havbeu t bemeanr kcertse ataered nthoewm fsoerlv eas resadyuicntgi onth aint trhaet esc. onditions<br />
LAWS: Yes, now I have no argument with that. It's also<br />
said in the paper this morning that it is likely that<br />
there will be a reduction in interest rates, but it's<br />
also being said that they couldn't be sustained so they<br />
may come down, but they're more than likely go back up<br />
again as they're going up in other parts of the world.<br />
PM: No, no, but that's there's no argument there<br />
because the, the argument that's run is that because<br />
there've been some slight increase in rates in Japan, for<br />
instance, that we wouldn't be able to sustain a fall<br />
here. The tact is that there's an eight percent<br />
differential, John. We can sustain a fall.<br />
LAWS: Yes, alright, well if it's possible for you to<br />
negotiate with the Reserve Bank, which you say you'd do<br />
within two weeks of winning the election, the question<br />
that all those people out there that have been hurt, and<br />
you concede that there are a lot that have been hurt, is<br />
why didn't you ring the Reserve Bank before and get<br />
interest rates down?<br />
PM: Well, the two, two points to say to that. Before the<br />
election started, in fact, there were conversations<br />
between the Treasurer and the Reserve Bank and the prime<br />
rates have been lowered. They were lowered there and<br />
they've come down over two percentage points. Now,<br />
obviously during the election campaign, it was not proper<br />
and it hasn't been proper during the actual election<br />
campaign to be pushing this issue. We started the<br />
process before the election campaign and as soon as the<br />
election's over and we're returned, then the conditions<br />
will be there properly to have a further reduction which<br />
will then be reflected in mortgage rates.<br />
LAWS: OK, Well </p>
<p>PM: And the mnarket is saying that will only happen under<br />
us. LAWS: Alright, well, if, if you as leader of the<br />
country can simply call the Reserve Bank and say we've<br />
got to have a talk about interest rates, if Andrew<br />
Peacock becomes Prime minister, why can't he simply do<br />
the same thing?<br />
PM: Because of what I said before. You would have the<br />
situation where we can do it because the policies that<br />
we've had in place have produced the conditions for a<br />
reduction in rates. Under Mr Peacock he's the man,<br />
John, who stood before the National Press Gallery in<br />
Canberra when asked the critical question about<br />
interest rates, what would happen to wages, he was asked<br />
the question. The classic reply, shrugged his shoulder<br />
and said ' who's to know,. Everyone else knows there<br />
would be a wages explosion because it's a free for all.<br />
You have a wages explosion and the second point is that<br />
he will blow the budget surplus.<br />
LAWS: So what you're saying<br />
PH: And what I'm saying, the conditions simply wouldn't<br />
be there.<br />
LAWS: OK, so what you're saying is that you, if you're<br />
re-elected, can bring interest rates down, will bring<br />
interest rates down. Is that correct, to say will bring<br />
interest rates down?<br />
PM: Yes, yes.<br />
LAWS: But Andrew Peacock can't.<br />
P14: He can't in any sustainable way because the only way<br />
that you can sustain any fall in interest rates would be<br />
if you've got a wages policy and a fiscal policy which<br />
will sustain lower rates. If your wages blow out and you<br />
dissipate your budget surplus, with his $ 6-7 billion hole<br />
that he's got, and giving back billions of dollars to<br />
less then one percent of the population by abolishing the<br />
capital gains tax, you blow your budget surplus and you<br />
have a wages explosion. in those circumstances you can't<br />
sustain a fall in interest rates.<br />
LAWS: OK, well can I ask you this. If you, if you can<br />
and he can't, you will if you're re-elected, be in touch<br />
with the Reserve Bank and interest rates not might, but<br />
will come down?<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
LAWS: Will they stay down? </p>
<p>1' 3-<br />
PM: I believe so for the reasons I've put. I couldn't<br />
say that if I didn't have a wages policy arnd a fiscal<br />
policy of appropriate firmness to allow me to say that.<br />
But I can say to you that we've negotiated the wages<br />
outcome, we know what it will be and John, every year<br />
we've got the wages outcome right, so we know what will<br />
happen to wages-<br />
LAWS: Yen, but-<br />
PM: And the surplus will be sustained.<br />
LAWS: In fairness you, you might have had the wages<br />
right, but you got a few other things wrong, didn't you?<br />
PM: Well, look I as I've said earlier in your program,<br />
John we underestimated the strength of demand. I mean,<br />
I don't know how many times you want me to, sort of,<br />
confess. But 1, but I've dones it openly. we got the,<br />
the level of demand wrong because one of the things that<br />
happened, we had this enormous turn around in the terms<br />
of trade and because we got a very big increase in our<br />
export prices, we just had billions of dollars streaming<br />
into the country which did inflate demand.<br />
LAWS: Doesn't it say a lot about this campaign that with<br />
only days, literally, left to go we get bogged down with<br />
the Multi Function Polls? Surely one would have thought<br />
that isn't one of the big issues of the election, but it<br />
now seems to become one of the big issues?<br />
PM: well, you know who introduced it. Wasn't me. The<br />
position of the Opposition, John, the week before was<br />
this on the Multi Function Polis and let me quote you<br />
LAWS: Yes, they were, they were in favour of it.<br />
PM: Let me quote it so that your listeners know what<br />
they were saying a week before in a considered replay to<br />
a question, what's the position on the Multi Function<br />
Polis? Here's the answer. In one short sentence, the<br />
Liberal National Party position the proposal is unique<br />
for Australia and deserves extensive consideration. And<br />
John Howard, the Shadow Minister I don't think we<br />
should bury the concept in a sea of hostility. Now, that<br />
was there position and so then he comes out with this<br />
story about enclaves. Can I just read to your listeners<br />
what the principle, the binding principle was that's<br />
adopted by the commonwealth and the State Governments and<br />
everyone involved in developing it. Principle four,<br />
develop the MFP as an entity which is not an enclave but<br />
is linked with the remainder of the Australian economy<br />
and provides a leading edge and technology transfer.<br />
And that was accepted.<br />
LAWS: Sure, and I understand that. We see the wisdom in<br />
all of that, but would you concede that politics is a<br />
great deal about perception? </p>
<p>PH: I concede that leadership is about having guts and<br />
having a vision for your country and having the courage<br />
to stand up for that.<br />
LAWS: Absolutely, but would you<br />
PH: And, and that was what was accepted to the credit,<br />
to the credit or the opposition, that was accepted<br />
LAWS: That's right<br />
PM: until the last week of the campaign because they<br />
knew that what this was about was not an enclave and what<br />
it was about attracting, not just from Japan, but<br />
attracting from North America, from Japan and from<br />
Europe, the best technology that we could get into this<br />
country so that we were going to secure the future of our<br />
kids and our grandchildren by marrying the best<br />
technology from overseas to an increasingly well trained<br />
Australian workforce.<br />
LAWS: Absolutely and there should be no argument about<br />
that. PM: And there shouldn't have been the reduction of that<br />
issue, John, which they understood and which they<br />
endorsed. There shouldn't have been this miserable,<br />
behind-hands sort of decision which ignored John Howard,<br />
John Howard the Minister, the Shadow Hinister, who was in<br />
favour of it, said it shouldn't be buried. But in the<br />
last week in the campaign to tap some vein in, in<br />
Australian politics, they gave away not the Polls, we<br />
haven't decided on it what's being done is that there<br />
is a high level inquiry, you've got the captains of<br />
Australian industry including John Elliott involved<br />
LAWS: Oh, yes.<br />
PM: will Bailey, what we're doing is investigating<br />
whether there is a way to bring for Australia and its<br />
future, the best technology to this country.<br />
LAWS: Yes.<br />
PM: in an acceptable way and these people are saying<br />
now, we won't even allow the investigation to go ahead.<br />
LAWS: But can I go back to what I said? Do you concede<br />
that politics has a lot to do with perception, with the<br />
way people see things?<br />
PM: Of course it has.<br />
LAWS: Well now many Australian people, because I talk to<br />
an awful lot of them, many of them perceive the Multi<br />
Function Polis, as it's extraordinarily called, as being </p>
<p>something and the, and the media ran with it, which would<br />
be eighty percent Japanese owned.<br />
PM: And there was never<br />
LAWS: There mightn't have been<br />
PF4: Never any justification f or it.<br />
LAWS: There may not have been but what I am saying to<br />
you is, if it was perceived as such by the, by the people<br />
of Australia, even incorrectly, I understand as well as<br />
you understand and everybody else understands, that we<br />
need the Japanese. By God we need them, we need their<br />
investment, we need their help, we need their<br />
cooperation, but there is a perception within, within<br />
certain areas of Australia that is fundamentally racist<br />
and it can't be argued, but nobody seems to want to admit<br />
it. Now if people perceive this as happening why didn't<br />
you, earlier in the campaign, and you must have been<br />
aware of it if I was aware of it, you were why<br />
didn't, why didn't you verbally put your arm around the<br />
shoulders of some of these dear old ladies who are<br />
concerned about Japanese involvement in Australia and<br />
explain it to them?<br />
PM: Well, John, the answer to that is very simple.<br />
LAWS: Yen.<br />
PH4: Because I and the Labor Party and Will Bailey and<br />
all leaders of Australian industry who are involved in<br />
this LAWS: You.<br />
PM: acted on the assumption that we were entitled to,<br />
that we had a responsible Leader of the opposition and<br />
they meant what they. said that they supported a<br />
position, as did Nick Greiner, the Liberal Premier in<br />
W this State<br />
LAWS: Yen, well I understand<br />
PM: Yes, but what I'm, I'm answering your question, I'm<br />
not avoiding it. You asked me why didn't we put arms<br />
ar~ und people. I'm saying that we had a bipartisan, a<br />
tripartisan position, the National Party, the Liberal<br />
Party and the Labor Party all supported this issue. It<br />
was a non issue as far as policy was concerned.<br />
LAWS: Yes, but that in itself might have been a non<br />
issue, but that triggered what really is an issue and<br />
that is a feeling that does exist in this country of<br />
concern, rightly or wrongly and I believe wrongly, but it<br />
does exist that there is a, a great. feeling of concern<br />
about the Japanese literally buying out this country.<br />
-1 </p>
<p>PM: Well let's have a look, let's have a look at the<br />
facts, John.<br />
LAWS: I know facts and I..<br />
PH: Well, no but let's have a look at the level of<br />
foreign investment in Australia.<br />
LAWS: Yes, we do that constantly and the Japanese level<br />
is down by comparison to New Zealand, the United Kingdom<br />
PH: The United Kingdom $ 44 billion.<br />
LAWS: Yes.<br />
PM: The United States 39, Japan 26 and overwhelmingly<br />
Japanese investment is in tourism, in tourism and what<br />
does that investment mean for Australia? It means jobs,<br />
it means an enormous number of jobs.<br />
S LAWS: I understand that all of that.<br />
PM: It means, we were talking about our foreign debt<br />
before LAWS: Yes.<br />
PM: It means an attack Last year tourism earned us<br />
$ 4.4 billion and the fact that the Japanese are investing<br />
in tourism here, it means that we're going to continue to<br />
get Japanese tourists here which is going to be a great<br />
source of dealing with the problems that you and I are<br />
concerned about.<br />
LAWS: That's right, but do you understand the anti-<br />
Japanese sentiment?<br />
PM: Yes but John, can I ask you a question?<br />
S LAWS: I mean, I understand you don't like it any more<br />
than I do, but do you, you understand it exists?<br />
PM: Yes, but I also understand, John, the political<br />
leadership is about putting the facts to people which I<br />
have done. The simple fact is that if I wanted to think<br />
of one single thing which would hurt my children and my<br />
grandchildren and all the future generations of<br />
Australians, all the kids and grandchildren of your<br />
listeners, the one thing that I could think of that was<br />
most calculated to harm my kids and my grandchildren and<br />
all the kids of your listeners is that we put a<br />
calculated insult to the Japanese. The Japanese are<br />
biggest customer.<br />
LAWS: Absolutely.<br />
PM: And as Asia is the biggest, fastest growing part of<br />
the world </p>
<p>LAWS: OK, now<br />
PM: And if we want, if we want to hurt our kids, let's<br />
insult the Japanese, let's insult the Asians because<br />
what, what Japan and Asia will say thank you very much<br />
Australia, we can get our coal, our iron ore, our<br />
aluminium, increasing amount manufactures from your<br />
country that were let in, we can get all those elsewhere.<br />
If you want to insult us and say that we are second class<br />
human beings, OK Australia, you do that and we'll look<br />
elsewhere. 17 </p>
<p>LAWS: Yes but nobody is suggesting that anybody do that,<br />
least of all me and least of all a lot Of people I talk<br />
to PM: I know you are not your suggesting<br />
LAWS: I am certain~ ly not suggesting<br />
P14: i know you're not, I know you never have, but what i<br />
am saying John is what to the duty of leadership in these<br />
circumstances? LAWS: Well I think the duty of leadership generally, I<br />
think the duty of Goverrnents is to try and understand<br />
the thinking of the majority and if the thinking of the<br />
majority is incorrect and is unobtainable then placate<br />
them by at least giving some explanation of the<br />
importance of it and I don't believe that you have done<br />
that. PM: On the contrary. What we have done, what we have<br />
done Is to quite openly set out the principles, we did<br />
that three years ago. The principles were known, they<br />
were published and as I have read out to your listeners,<br />
principle four no enclave. it is perfectly well known<br />
that we have enlisted the best brains of Australian<br />
industry, we've given our bit, now it has been out in the<br />
open. LAWS: OK but the people,, and they are the only ones that<br />
netter, the people saw the Multi-Function Polio as being<br />
something that was going to be popul~ ated by 80t Japanese<br />
PM% Which is wrong.<br />
LAWS: Which is wrong true. Which was going to be a<br />
separate City, now that was run and allowed to run and<br />
S nobody like X always thought that immigration and<br />
integration should go hand in hand and I am sure that you<br />
would agree with that.<br />
0PM: Absolutely.<br />
LAWS: NJow the impression given with the Multi-Funotion<br />
Polio was that it warn going to be virtually a Japanese<br />
city and they were going to be within a ghetto virtually.<br />
Now nobody denies that.<br />
FM: Of course It has been denied. It has been denied<br />
all along.<br />
LAWS: Yesterday and the day before<br />
P1: It is like Mr Peacock getting uip and saying Bob<br />
Hawke is going to sell Darwin to the Indonesians, and I<br />
am against Darwin being sold to the Indonesians. I mean </p>
<p>17<br />
that is the equivalent. Talk abouta creating a s+ voa.<br />
have got to defend a position, according to the thssxsl<br />
you are putting, where this has been out in the open,<br />
respected peopl1e like Bailey and Elliott have been<br />
identified with this, Greiner and so onl. No suggesting<br />
that is an enclave<br />
LAWS: But aren't you the people who don't<br />
understand, I'm not talking about the people that do<br />
understand. PM: But John I am saying that as far as the community<br />
was concerned, until just a few days ago, you had the<br />
position in this country of total bipartisan support for<br />
It. It wasn't a political issue.<br />
LAWS: Thea right which has raised some problems.<br />
PM: Can I ask you the question<br />
LAWS: But obviously the Opposition sees the anti-<br />
Japanese sentiment which do you concede exists in<br />
Australia? PM: There is some. I do not acept that is a majority<br />
position, because<br />
LAWS: Well I think you are wrong, and I think they are<br />
wrong. PM: I know you think they are wrong John, but what I am<br />
saying is that I have a different perception of<br />
Australians than you do. I believe that Australians are<br />
essentially decent, I believe they are essentially<br />
intelligent. Australians know that this country of 17<br />
million people, thats what we are, 17 million people in a<br />
world of 5 1/ 2 billion. In a region which is the fastest<br />
growing economic region in the world where Japan is far<br />
and away our biggest market.<br />
LAWS: Absolutely<br />
PM: Biggest trading partner. I Just happen to believe<br />
that the majority of Australians and not the ones who<br />
make the noise, you think about Australian politics, the<br />
-majority of Australians are not the noise-makers.<br />
LAWS: Well you listen to a lot of the noise-makers.<br />
PM: Of course you have got to listen to a lot of the<br />
noise-makers.<br />
LAWS: OK, but can I Justago back to this. You say that<br />
Australians are fundamentally docent<br />
PM: And intelligent* </p>
<p>LAWS: And intelligent. Well you don't have to be either<br />
indeenrt or unintelligent i-f you are a widow and your<br />
husband died in the Second World War at the hands of the<br />
Japanese. When you hear that Japanese investment in<br />
Australia is large, when you hear that the block of laend<br />
next door to Kirribilli House, where you live when you<br />
are in Sydney, is being sold to the Japanese, can't you<br />
understand that that woman at that time thinks well what<br />
my husband died at the hands of these people. She needs<br />
to be told that her husband died in vain if we didn't now<br />
do business with the Japanese that thats what the whole<br />
thing was about, but don't you understand that that<br />
exists? M14 aohn, I also understand that I do a lot of meeting<br />
with and talking with people who fought against the<br />
Japanese. one of my closest friends, one of my closest<br />
friends in Australia today is Sir Williami Keys, the bloke<br />
who was the outstanding President of the RSL<br />
LAWS: Certainly.<br />
PM: A great Australian and Bill Keys in conversations I<br />
have had with him said, Prime Minister we have got to<br />
understand, we've got to understand and all my members<br />
have to understand that their future and the future of<br />
their kids, and he has talked about the grandchildren and<br />
of their grandchildren, depends upon us learning to live<br />
construotively with our former enemies. John, I<br />
LAWS: Well that is exactly what I am saying.<br />
PM: I know this John, I do not question your position.<br />
LAWS: And you know Bill Keys has said it and he is a<br />
wonderful PM: He's a wonderful man<br />
LAWS: Remarkable man but you didn't say it until just<br />
then.<br />
P14: I have been saying it for years.<br />
LAWS: You have but during this campaign I know you did<br />
not want to make it an election issue<br />
PM: And I did not make it an election issue.<br />
LAWS: N~ o you didn't, but it has become an election<br />
issue.<br />
PM: And once it has become an eleotion issue John I have<br />
responded. But I ask you the question, may I put this<br />
question to you? Do you think that Andrew Peacock hoe<br />
discharged the responsibilities of leadership, a man who<br />
would lead this country by six days before an election,<br />
after having said this is a great idea and deserves to be </p>
<p>studied in full, do you think he has discharged the<br />
responsibilities of leadership for the future by what he<br />
has done?<br />
LAWS: I believe that he made an effort, rightly or<br />
wrongly, and I happen to think wrongly, to placate the<br />
people t~ o which I have just referred.<br />
PM: Exactly, I agree with you.<br />
LAWS: But is that wrong?<br />
PM; Ytes you said wrongly and I agree with you because<br />
what leadership is about is not tapping in to lowest<br />
common denominators on antagonisms. Leadership, John, is<br />
about recognising that there can be misunderstanding,<br />
antagonism but understanding where the future of your<br />
country and where the future for your kids lies and I<br />
repeat the future for all the kids of your listeners and<br />
their grandchil. dren absolutely depends upon Australia<br />
being able to be eneshed into the dynamic growth of the<br />
Asia Pacific R~ egi~ on of wI~ ich Japan is an Integrally<br />
important part. We don't lie down for the Japanese but<br />
what we sensible do is to say we want to tap, not only<br />
yours, but Americans, Europeans the beat technology, we<br />
want it to come here under our sovereign control so that<br />
we can marry the best of your technology with our<br />
Australian skills so that we are going to becomne<br />
competitive in a very competitive world, that is what<br />
leadership is about.<br />
LAWS: Back to the Japanese that we both agree are<br />
tremendously important to us and particularly in the area<br />
of tourism. We suffered a slump in tourism because of<br />
the pilots' dispute, what are pour plans for tourism?<br />
PM: Thanks John. Could I just very quickly give you the<br />
background to what has happened in the period since we<br />
have been in office. We have put $ 250 million, a quarter<br />
of a billion dollars was invested in the Australian<br />
Tourist Commission and that has led, in thislperiod that<br />
we have been in office John, to over $ 50 billion of<br />
investment. It ha. led to over 300,000 new Jobs and a<br />
turnover increase from 7 billion to 27 billion and an<br />
increase in international visitors from 900,000 to obout<br />
2 1/ 2 million.<br />
LAWS: We have suffered a bit of a slump.<br />
PM: Yes we have and let me say this that In the build-up<br />
of those figures a very important role was played by Paul<br />
Hogan and I pay tribute to him, he provided his services<br />
free to the Australian Tourist Commission and I thank<br />
Paul Hogan, but he is not going to do any more. I have<br />
got good news and that is that another great Australian<br />
of international atature, Greg N~ orman, as a reult of<br />
discussions that I and your mate and my mate 33 Brown.<br />
Discussions with Johnny Brown and I have had with this </p>
<p>Oteftt Australianl, Greg Norman has agreed free of charge<br />
and you know what his fees would be if he wanted to, he<br />
has agreed to do f ree of charge for us through the<br />
Australian Tourist Commission, promotional films that<br />
will be shown around the world. I guess particularly in<br />
the United States and Japan, but elsewhere, to attract<br />
tourists to Australia and I just want to take this<br />
opportunity of saying a great thank you to Paul Hogan and<br />
a great thank you to another great Australian in Greg<br />
Norman who loves his country, wants to see It grow end<br />
prosper and is prepared to do this for Australia and I<br />
think we are going to see as a result of that, we6 1l make<br />
sure that the Australian Tourist Commission is in a<br />
position to be able to take advantage of Greg's<br />
marvellous offer and we'll see a resumption of the great<br />
growth in tourism which is going to be very important for<br />
this economy.<br />
LAWS: The aforementioned mutual friend one 33 Brown also<br />
reckons you haven't put enough money into tourismn, * re<br />
you going to put more in?<br />
PM: To be f air to John, he goes out of his way to say<br />
that the before we camne to office there was nothing done<br />
and that we have done a marvellous job, Johnny would<br />
always like to see a bit more and we will be 1listening to<br />
what he has got to say.<br />
LAWS: Are you going to give him a bit more?<br />
PM: Well we hae in this year, we've given a very big<br />
boost as you know to try and meet the problem created by<br />
the pilots' problem<br />
LAWS: Yes but will that be ongoing?<br />
PM: We are going to examine it. one, let me say this<br />
that I give the guarantee to the Australian Tourist<br />
Commission will be put in a position where it will be<br />
able to take advantage of this offer of Greg Norman, it<br />
won't suffer financially.<br />
LAWS: Who's idea was Greg Norman?<br />
PM: I think I have got to give, basically give credit to<br />
33, to John Brown. X mean I am a good friend of Ore ' a<br />
== be you know and he is very close to me, he is very clo se<br />
to JJ, but I give credit to 33 for really getting the<br />
idea and when it warn mentioned Greg said Yoh love to do<br />
it. Australians are going to be terribly indebted to<br />
this man who can command millions of dollars for doing<br />
things but he is going to provide his services free.<br />
LAWS: Tell me this, I think you have done a strange<br />
thing, obviously you thought it was necessary or you<br />
would not have done it or your advinors thought it woo<br />
necessary. You have virtually gone out and bought the<br />
green preferences. -k </p>
<p>Pm: oh come on John.<br />
LAWSi Ye~ s, you have.<br />
Pm: John, can I<br />
LAWSt You have pitched advertising right at those voters<br />
and sold make up your mind but make sure you give us the<br />
preferences. PM: John, what we have done is to accept the reality of<br />
world politics. You're a student of politics beyond this<br />
country as weil as, it there is one feature of yolitio.<br />
cround the world for the last five years or so t is the<br />
emergence3 of the environment as an issue of concern and<br />
that concern, as you made John, It crosses the Income<br />
barriers, crosses social barriers, there are just many<br />
many more people concerned about the environment then<br />
they were before and to the point where in this country,<br />
as in others, people are prepared to vote their concern<br />
by giving their first vote to a candidate who they think<br />
has the environment on the top of their list. So what I<br />
have said, and the Party has said, we recognise that<br />
reality and said alright if people are going to cast<br />
their first vote for a Democrat or a green candidate<br />
because they went to emphasis* their concern with the<br />
environment I am simply mak~ ing the logical point to each<br />
one of them. If your maj~ or concern is the environment,<br />
remember this, the Democrats and the green$ are not going<br />
to form the Government. its either going to be Labor or<br />
the Liberal -Notional Coalition, so make sure that your<br />
second preference goes to Labor because we have got the<br />
best record and the best policy on the environment. That<br />
is just sensible politics John. </p>
<p>LAWSt well, it's sensible politicking.<br />
PM: Sensible politics. I mean wouldn't I be silly,<br />
knowing that the truth is that there will be a higher<br />
vote of people who are going to cast their f irst vote on<br />
environmental grounds, if I didn't remind them' that their<br />
real important decision is what they do with their seCond<br />
preference vote. I mean I've got to that. From their<br />
point of view and certainly from mine. I want their<br />
preference. LAWS: Is this the first election that you've found this<br />
necessary, to go seeking preferences?<br />
PM: Yes, because it's the first time in which the<br />
evidene is that the non-major parties are going to have<br />
a reasonably significant vote. And understanding that,<br />
I've got an obligation to them and to my own party and to<br />
the people of Australia to say well, what you do with<br />
your second preference isi important.<br />
LAWS: Just bock to the airline dispute. in it true that<br />
you gave a sizeable reduction to Ansett for the cost of<br />
too, government aeroplanes?<br />
PM: No. if you read the whole of that~ report you'll see<br />
that the officials have indicated there was no<br />
justification for that. I had no approach from, and I<br />
certainly would not do deals for anyone. You know me<br />
wall enough that. I mean I think the reality, and I<br />
mean the best way of exploding that reality is this.<br />
That the big thing that Ansett had going for them over<br />
the years until I became Prime Minister was the two<br />
airline agreement. It was a guarantee to print money.<br />
And who is It that smashed the two airline agreement? A<br />
fellow called Bob Hawke.<br />
LAWS: True. But did they get a reduction?<br />
0 PM: No. what happened was that the initial figure that<br />
was suggested was questioned, as I understand it, by the<br />
airline. There was further discussion within the<br />
Department of Pefence. My Department was referred to.<br />
There was no approach to me. The decision was made at<br />
the level of the Departments concerned and with the<br />
Minister of Defence authorising it. . There was no<br />
approach to me and no decision by mes.<br />
LAWS: No, but all that aside, did they get a reduction?<br />
PM: The figure was a lower one than the one that was<br />
initially put up.<br />
LAWS: Ok, that means that<br />
PM: But what I'm saying, but not through my<br />
intervention. ' A </p>
<p>r<br />
LAWS: Nobody's suggesting that.<br />
PM: Some people were.<br />
LAWS: Ok.<br />
PM: Not you. I mean But some people were<br />
suggesting in the press that it was Hawks. And they had<br />
the snide did you notice the snide line said sir<br />
Peter Abeles is a friend of Bob Hawke's. I mean, lovely<br />
line. Nice snide line, but inaccurate. It wasn't Hawke.<br />
And as far as Ansett's concerned the bloke who's knocked<br />
Ansett of f from a privileged position, not just in term~ s<br />
of one year but into the future, is Hawke. I've ended<br />
the two airline agreement.<br />
LAWS: Ok, but the short answer to the question is yes<br />
they did got a reduction?<br />
PM: But when you say reduotion, what was being -Imean<br />
I'Im not being semantic or<br />
LAWS: I think you are.<br />
PM: I'm not. Look<br />
LAWS: I mean and it became x minus y<br />
FM: It wasn't a This was at the beginning of the<br />
arrangements. We were going to use the Airforce and so<br />
details had to be worked out as to what they were going<br />
to be charged. in the first place, someone, somewhere<br />
within the bureaucracy, suggested that figure. It wasn't<br />
the one that was applied. That was the one that<br />
Then there was argument and discussion. They didn't get<br />
a reduction from something they'd been paying. Some<br />
bureaucrat had a figure there. That was questioned. And<br />
the figure that emerged was a lower one then the fi lure<br />
that was mentioned by the first bureaucrat. They d dn't<br />
got a reduction from something they were paying.<br />
LAWS: No. Did the some thing happen with Australian<br />
Airlines? FM: Australian paid exactly the mnia as Ansett. Exactly<br />
the isome.<br />
LAWS: I think it's very important to clarify that.<br />
PM: Sure, I appreciate it.<br />
LAWS: In light of the cynicism that you say exists, I<br />
Must tell you inoidentally that I had a telephone call<br />
yesterday I imagine from a coalition plant suggesting<br />
that it was laughable, but it's the sort of thing that I<br />
imagine you have to put up with if you want to be in<br />
politics, suggesting that your daughter had bought a<br />
house in Canberra and had paid for it with a cheque </p>
<p>signed by Sir Peter Abeles. So that's the kind of<br />
nonsense that<br />
PM: I wish they'd have the guts<br />
LAWS: They don't.<br />
PM: No, of course they've got no guts. A total<br />
falsehood. A total falsehood and I just challenge that<br />
person to have the guts to come out and say it.<br />
LAWS: But they don't.<br />
PM: of course they don't.<br />
LAWS: around long enough to know that they never<br />
have the guts.<br />
PM: No guts.<br />
LAWS: And that'a the way it is.<br />
PM4: That's the way it is.<br />
LAWS: Now tell mne this. Back in the early, seven years<br />
ago when I used to see you, you'd come bounding in here<br />
full of energy and full of enthusiasm. You st ill appear<br />
to be full of energy. A lot of people have put it to me<br />
arnd I've heard a couple put it to you that you might be<br />
tired. PM: I've never felt better.<br />
LAWS: I heard someone say to yesterday, they cited what<br />
they called an old adage, which is a double something<br />
because an adage is old, that if you have a job for two<br />
years you should make a move, if you are there for four<br />
it's really time you got out, and if you were there for<br />
six it was too long.<br />
PM: The Liberals seem to have an adage like that. If<br />
you're Leader of the Liberal Party for two years, that's<br />
long enough. Then the hurdy gurdy goes round and then<br />
the next bloke hops on then the hurdy gurdy goes round<br />
over the next years and the bloke that was on before gets<br />
back on. They seem to hove the adage. But as far as the<br />
Labor Party is concerned, the truth is that in 1983 they<br />
picked Bob Hawke and they were pretty enthusiastic then.<br />
LAWS: Yes, they..<br />
PM: They are more enthusiastic in 1990 than they were in<br />
1983. 1 have the total support, total support of my<br />
Party. And I've never felt more enthusiastic about the<br />
job. </p>
<p>LAWS: Do you really believe that it's right and proper<br />
that the people of Australia should be encouraged to vote<br />
for a Party rather than a person?<br />
PM4: Look, you're never goinlg to be able to disentangle<br />
the two John.<br />
LAWS: But isn't it proper that they should do that?<br />
PM: I think they've got to, they do both. I think<br />
leadership, for better or for worse, is an important part<br />
of politics. I mean the truth is that when people wake<br />
up on the 25th of this month they're either going to have<br />
Bob Hawke 88 Prime Minister or Andrew Peacock. Who leads<br />
is very important. But so are the policies. I simply<br />
say in respect of the question you put. of how I f eel, I<br />
oen honestly say to you I'va never felt fitter, I've<br />
never felt more mentally alert, and may I say this, I've<br />
never felt more exuberant about being Prime Minister of<br />
the best country in the world. I mean, the future of<br />
this country is enormous and I just want to be identified<br />
with bringing to fruition the sorts of basic changes that<br />
are happening now in education, in science, technology<br />
our capacity to go out in those export markets and take<br />
on the best in the world and beating them. I mean that's<br />
what we're doing and I just want to see those things come<br />
even more to fruition.<br />
LAWS: Could you tell me just in the two minutes or so<br />
that we've got left, just in your own words, what you see<br />
for the future, for people like me, for people like the<br />
rest who are listening to us all over Australia, for<br />
their kids and their kids' kids.<br />
PM: Sure. I see a better educated Australia where every<br />
kid, irrespective of the income level of their parents<br />
are going to be able to go on and develop to the full<br />
whatever talents they have. We've already gone a long<br />
way in doing that. That's the best thing for the future.<br />
LAWS: Irrespective of colour or creed.<br />
PM: irrespective of colour, creed, income. Every<br />
Australian child is going to be able to go on in the<br />
education system and have his or her talents fully<br />
trained. That's the best thing for the future of<br />
Australia. It's the most fundamental building block.<br />
We're going to have an industrial award system which gets<br />
rid of the irrelevancies and the ossification of the past<br />
as has just happened in the Metal Trades award. Three<br />
hundred and sixty classifications out and now fourteen,<br />
so that we're going to have an increasingly competitive<br />
Australian industry. We're going to be an Australia<br />
which is increasingly enmeshed in this most dynamic<br />
Asian-Pacific region. We're going to help shape that,<br />
not just accept it as it happens. But we're going to<br />
help shape it by this initiative that I've taken in<br />
establishing the. Asian-Peoifia Economic Co-operation </p>
<p>body. And most importantly, John, these kids are going<br />
to grow up with a greater chance than any kids ever<br />
before of living in a world of peace. Fortunately, and<br />
waive been part of it, the superpowers now understand<br />
it's more sensib1e, as it is in Australia, not to have<br />
conflict but to have co-operation. I can look the kids<br />
of Australia in the eye in a way I never could before and<br />
say you are going to grow up in a world at peace and<br />
Australia's been part of bringing that about.<br />
LAWS: Thanks very much for your time. It's been good to<br />
talk to you as always, Let me say, as I've said on mlany<br />
other occasions, and I know you agree with what I'm about<br />
to say. Whatever happens on Saturday, let's all hope and<br />
pray if we're that way inclined, that it's ontob<br />
for the betterment of the f uture of Australia,<br />
PM: Yea.<br />
LAWS: Bacause it's all that matters, isn't it?<br />
PM: it's all that's ever concerned me John.<br />
LAWS: Ok, thanks very much for your time.<br />
