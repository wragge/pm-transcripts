PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 21 June 1984<br />
JOINT STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER AND THE PREMIER OF VICTORIA<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, and the Victorian Premier, Mr Cain,<br />
today applauded the ACTU decision over the BLF picket line<br />
at the MCG.<br />
" The decision is the only proper course for the ACTU because<br />
the BLF has flouted tha industrial law of this country and<br />
the rules of the peak union council.<br />
" The conduct of the BLF on the picket line has been disgraceful<br />
and contrary to the very spirit of trade unionism in this<br />
country." The Prime Minister and Mr Cain were notified by the ACTU<br />
Secretary, Mr Kelty, late today that the ACTU officers had<br />
decided to formally advise the TWU that the picket on the MCG<br />
lights project was not authorised.<br />
Mr Kelty said in his telex to the TWU that:<br />
" The ACTU officers have today decided to formally advise<br />
that the BLF picket in respect to the MCG lights is not<br />
authorised and accordingly the ACTU does not expect<br />
unions to recognise it.<br />
' This decision has been made on the grounds that:<br />
Cal the BLF did not follow ACTU policy in respect<br />
to picketing; and<br />
the BLF has advised on more than one occasion<br />
that it is not prepared to follow ACTU policy<br />
in respect to demarcation in relation to this<br />
site."<br />
Mr Hawke ' and Mr Cain discussed . the issue today and they have<br />
fully endorsed the ACTU's action.<br />
" It is our fervent hope that the BLF will now withdraw its picket<br />
and allow those unionists who have been awarded the work on the<br />
lights to go about their duties<br />
" Clearly, the picket has no support from any unions affiliated with<br />
the ACTU.<br />
" Mr Gallagher should now apply his own oft-quoted dictum and<br />
' cop it sweet'." </p>
