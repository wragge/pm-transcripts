STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
PARLIAMENTARY RESOLUTION ON THE<br />
ANNIVERSARY OF THE OUTBREAK OF THE<br />
SECOND WORLD WAR<br />
31 AUGUST 1989<br />
Mr Speaker<br />
I move that this House, remembering:<br />
that 3 September 1989 is the fiftieth anniversary<br />
. of the outbreak of the Second World War, and<br />
that nearly 34,000 Australian servicemen and women<br />
died in that conflict,<br />
expresses its profound hope that the troubled peace since<br />
the end of the War will become a permanent peace in the<br />
world, and in particular<br />
reaffirms its deep and continuing gratitude to<br />
those Australian men and women who served their<br />
country in that War, both overseas and at home, and<br />
its continuing sympathy to the families and friends<br />
of those who died or were wounded in combat; and<br />
resolves to ensure that the sacrifices of those men<br />
and women were not made vain, by meeting our<br />
Nation's continuing defe -and security<br />
responsibilities and by working to preserve and<br />
extend the goals for which the War was fought: a<br />
peaceful world, in which the human rights and<br />
democratic aspirations of all men and women are<br />
inviolate.<br />
Mr Speaker<br />
O On Sunday the world will mark the fiftieth anniversary of<br />
the beginning of the Second world war, the second time in<br />
our century that the tragedy of global conflict engulfed us.<br />
It is appropriate that the Australian Parliament should mark<br />
this event on behalf of the Australian people. AS this<br />
motion notes, the anniversary of the outbreak of the war is<br />
a time for us to recall with deep gratitude the sacrifices<br />
made by all those Australian men and women who fought<br />
overseas and who served at home during the Second World War.<br />
It is a time to recall, in particular, the debt we owe to<br />
the 34,000 Australians who died in the conflict, to those<br />
who suffer still as a result of their experiences in the<br />
war, and to the families and friends of those who died. </p>
<p>So much has changed in the world over the past half century,<br />
and in Australia's place in it, that it is sometimes<br />
difficult for younger Australians to appreciate how much we<br />
owe to the generation which responded so bravely and so<br />
enthusiastically to the dreadful challenges of 1939 and the<br />
years that followed.<br />
But it was the heavy human and economic price they paid that<br />
resulted in the final defeat of fascism and imperialism, and<br />
the liberation of the peoples of Europe and the Asia-Pacific<br />
region from the crushing weight of two barbarous tyrannies.<br />
And this victory, in turn, permitted the creation of the<br />
most positive and dynamic feature of the world we have<br />
inherited: the collection of free, democratic and equitable<br />
societies in North America, Western Europe and East Asia<br />
that has been the driving force behind the development of<br />
the more prosperous and peaceful world order that now<br />
beckons us.<br />
Australia reaped another benefit from the tragedy of the<br />
war: the immeasurable enrichment of our society through the<br />
massive influx of new settlers who fled the devastation of<br />
their war ravaged homes to build a new life in the clear<br />
Australian atmosphere of freedom and opportunity.<br />
It is true that the eventual victory in the Second world War<br />
did not secure for all people the democracy and human rights<br />
so painfully regained for some. As we have been reminded in<br />
the most moving way over the past few months in places as<br />
diverse as Beijing, Hungary, Poland and the Baltic states,<br />
the democratic impulse has been smothered for long periods<br />
throughout many parts of the world.<br />
But it now seems possible, Mr Speaker, that parts of the<br />
world which had appeared frozen in repression may finally be<br />
able to take their place with the rest of humankind as we<br />
move to a more cooperative and prosperous future. We are<br />
privileged to be living through an exciting and challenging<br />
time in international affai-rs. For the first time in our<br />
often unhappy century we can contemplate the idea of a world<br />
in which another global conflict seems improbable.<br />
Appalling problems remain, of course. In places such as the<br />
middle East, where the suffering of the Lebanese people is<br />
so tragically prolonged, and the gap between Arabs and<br />
Israelis so apparently unbridgeable, and in South Africa<br />
under the abhorrent yoke of apartheid, peace still seems a<br />
distant and elusive hope.<br />
But, on the whole, we are entitled to permit ourselves a<br />
degree of optimism about the future. </p>
<p>3.<br />
So this anniversary, Mr Speaker, gives us opportunity and<br />
reason to remember that we have only reached this<br />
potentially benign point in human history with the help of<br />
the sacrifices that were made by ordinary Australians during<br />
the Second World War. It gives us reason, too, to remember<br />
one of the great lessons of that war: that peace and<br />
security are fundamentally intertwined.<br />
Having recently returned from observing the Kangaroo ' 89<br />
exercise, I am particularly conscious of the role the men<br />
and women of our Defence Force have played not only in time<br />
of war, but also in preserving the peace. They serve us and<br />
our nation well.<br />
Mr Speaker, just as Australians can look back proudly on the<br />
part we played in helping to win the war, so we can reflect<br />
with pride on the way we have helped to sustain the peace.<br />
In recent years, Australia has made intensive efforts to<br />
0 contribute to an international climate aimed at protecting<br />
and expanding peace.<br />
Through our active work in multilateral arms control<br />
organisations, by our diplomatic activities in our own<br />
region, and through the influence we have exerted within the<br />
councils of our alliance relationship, we have been able to<br />
work towards a safer world.<br />
In particular, Mr Speaker, we have made our voice heard<br />
loudly in support of the very welcome measures that have<br />
already been taken by the superpowers to reduce their deadly<br />
arsenals of nuclear weapons although much more has yet to<br />
be done; we have worked tirelessly to reduce the risks of<br />
other countries joining the nuclear club; and we have been<br />
at the leading edge of international efforts to prevent the<br />
proliferation of the modern plague of chemical weapons.<br />
And as we consider this motion today,' Mr Speaker,<br />
Australians are helping-to keep the peace on behalf of the<br />
United Nations, often in dangerous and uncomfortable<br />
conditions, in Namibia, in Cyprus, in Southern Lebanon and<br />
on the Golan Heights, and along the battle-scarred border<br />
between Iran and Iraq.<br />
I call on Honourable Members to support the motion before<br />
the House, and to join me at the conclusion of the<br />
consideration of the motion in a moment of silence,<br />
recalling the courage of those who died in the Second world<br />
War, the resilience of those who survived, and our common<br />
hope that by our actions we will repay the debt we owe those<br />
Australians in the best way we can: by ensuring that such<br />
sacrifices are never again made necessary. </p>
