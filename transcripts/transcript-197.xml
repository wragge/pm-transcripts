SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTEht, THE RT. HON.<br />
R. G. MENZIES, C. H. M. P. AT THE<br />
STATE LIBERLAL CONFERNCE, HOBART, 15' TH 3JLY 196o<br />
Mr. President and ladies and gentlemen:<br />
I think I will follow my usual prudent course and<br />
declare the Fifteenth Annual Meeting of the State Council<br />
Open. I was told to do it at the finish, but I know if I don't<br />
do it now I may forget to do it later on.<br />
I was very very interested to find that Mr. Pitchford's<br />
mind was running back over a long period now since this Party<br />
began, and as that rather relates to my theme this morning, I<br />
will make a further reference to it myself.<br />
Back in 191+ 3 our predecessor parties had the biggest<br />
defeat, I think, in their political history. In 1944 I had<br />
become once more, Leader of the Party and Leader of the<br />
Opposihion and I determined that there must be a tremendous<br />
effort made to produce something new and vigorous and united.<br />
Many of you may have forgotten that at that time in 1944, one<br />
could find in Australia no less than fourteen different<br />
organisations, all of them professing, more or less, our ownr<br />
point of view fourteen different bodies. Disunity of that<br />
kind was one of the reasons for our defeat. And the unity that<br />
was produced by the work of 1944 and 1945 in welding all these<br />
bodies into one and creating the Liberal Party is one of the<br />
great factors that has kept us in office in the Commonwealth<br />
for the last ten or eleven years. It is worthwhile recalling<br />
that in disunity we found our greatest disaster; and in unity<br />
we found our greatest and most continuous success. The history<br />
of politics is full of that.<br />
I can remember and no doubt many of you can in 1929-<br />
wasn't in the Federal Parliament, that had nothing Lo do with<br />
it the Bruce Government went down to the greatest defeat that<br />
it could have encountered. It was forced into an election<br />
twelve months after the election of 1928, which it had won, and<br />
it was forced into an election by disunity in its own ranks.<br />
And Labour came in at the end of 1929 with a majority that<br />
induced the usual faint-hearted among us to say: " Oh, they'll<br />
be there for ten years". It is wonderful how quickly some<br />
people abandon all hone. They were going to be there for ten<br />
years. And inside 18 months they had fallen to pieces. They<br />
had encountered difficulties of policy and of character in<br />
their own ranks, and in the result they fell to pieces and by<br />
the end of 1931, they were gone. The Lyons' Government came<br />
in and we had from the beginning of 1932 to the beginning, or<br />
the middle, of 1941, an unbroken period of Government by people<br />
of our side of politics.<br />
Do you see how it w; orks out? Every time there is<br />
disuhity, disaster may be looked for. Every time there is<br />
unity victory is three parts achieved.<br />
I had, I think, some illustration of the value of<br />
this kind of thing this year in London. lie had a Prime<br />
Ministers' Conference. The Conference met under very, very<br />
difficult circumstances. There had been an incident at<br />
Sharpeville in South Africa and all round the world there were<br />
denunciations of the South African racial policy not that<br />
that policy was a policy of shooting people but the policy of<br />
apartheid, the policy of separate developmenl of the black and<br />
the white races. And this was under tremendous attack.<br />
Fortunately the matter came up for the first time in any wide<br />
discussion at the Prime Ministers' Conference.<br />
And there we were quite different people: Mr. Macmillan<br />
as the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Mr. Diefen-</p>
<p>baker from Canada, Mr. Nash from New Zealand, Tunku Abdul<br />
Rahnaan from Malaya, President Ayub from Pakistan, a representative<br />
of Ceylon and the Prime Minister of Ghana, Dr. Nkrumah.<br />
Well, we are all different people. And, particularly in the<br />
case of some of our colleagues from Asia and Africa, feelings<br />
were very, very high and they had stated their views and<br />
offered them with considerable force in their own countries.<br />
In the result we sat down together: there is a strange, illusive<br />
unity about the British Commonwealth. If you look at it<br />
as a matter of paper you say " Well what is it?" I have<br />
encountered people who say i doesn? t exist. W~ hat is the<br />
relation between these countries? There are republics; and<br />
there are monarchies, like Australia. ' Uhat does hold these<br />
people together? What is it that induces a country like Ghana<br />
when it gets independent self-government, to apply at once tha?<br />
it may be a member of the Commonwealth? And what induces it,<br />
when it votes to become a republic, to apply at once, as it<br />
did, for approval to remain in the Commonweal th as a republic?<br />
Why is it that this happehs? And the answer is that we meet.<br />
ge are not like any other body on eath. We have no slight<br />
resemblance to the Security Council of the United Nations or<br />
the General Assembly. We are not meeting on the stage of the<br />
theatre; we are not conducting public debates; we are not<br />
taking votes; we don't have people running around the lobbies<br />
trying to persuade somebody else to support this amendment if<br />
I support yours. All this kind of thing which is inseparable<br />
from great assemblies doesn't exist when we enter No.<br />
Downing Street. And down upon us in that room I know because I have<br />
had a long experience of it, longer now than anybody else<br />
down upon us there settles a particular sense of intimacy, a<br />
particular sense of friendly understanding, a particular realisation<br />
that if we can remain a united body for the things that<br />
we believe in, a great good will come to the world. And there<br />
we were, sitting around the table, sitting in various rooms,<br />
talking as occasion offered with the representative of South<br />
Africa, the South African problem: courteously, quietly, no<br />
passions displayed, an earnest desire to get to understand and<br />
to make sensible suggestions. And in the result, after 10 days<br />
of that conference, we were able to issue a communique which<br />
referred to the problem of South Africa referred to the<br />
existence of a multi-racial soc,-4oty in Lho Commonwealth, and<br />
which was the unanimous product of all those present<br />
includinc, South Africa.<br />
You see the point that I am getting at? There are<br />
plenty of debating societies in the world I take a hand in<br />
one at Canberra from time to time, myself,-( Laughter) in a<br />
small way. But the Prime Ministers' Conference is one of the<br />
gre at proofs that people who disagree, perhaps profoundly on<br />
a number of matters, can find a great sense of unity aboU~ the<br />
important things about which, underneath it all, they find<br />
themselves agre. eing.<br />
Now, Sir, we can carry that further on to the world<br />
stage. The world is going through a pretty bad period, a very<br />
worrying period. Khrushchev has two things, perhaps, in his<br />
favour: one is that he knows his own mind and he is the<br />
master of his own time table, just as Hitler was. The other is<br />
that he is acting, so to speak, on internal lines of communication:<br />
he's got this great country behind him, an enormous<br />
aggregation of people behind him, whether willingly or otherwise,<br />
and he can press out, probe out on to the rest of the<br />
wiorld at his own choico. While the free world, being the free<br />
world, will argue, one country with the other, conduct all the<br />
disputes in public, have all the differences magnified in the<br />
headlines though they may be quite trivial. Superficially it<br />
is an example of unity versus a certain amount of disunity. </p>
<p>0 3.<br />
When the disunity becomes too prevalent, the Cold Var by the<br />
Soviet Union succeeds. When the great nations of the Vdest<br />
really get together and begin to act and think together, then<br />
the Cold War begins to fail. But the Cold Wgar has had a<br />
considerable amount of success of late.<br />
I was in London of course, at the time when the<br />
Summit Conference occurred, or didn't occur as the case may be.<br />
And when Mr. Macmillan came back from Paris I had a long<br />
private discussion vith him about it in order to get some of<br />
the background of it. He was, of course, bitterly disappointed.<br />
No man had done so much as hehad to bring it about. He had<br />
with a bold stroke of moral leadership, as I will always<br />
regard it, IoettMso hmef urged the holding of a<br />
Meeting at the Summit, and had finally persuaded President<br />
Eisenhower and General De Gaulle that it ought to occur. And<br />
so, everything was set for it. Khrushchev had himself<br />
proposed it, do you remember, at least a year before,<br />
Well, what were we all expecting? It know that it is<br />
a very human frailty always to expect too much and I daresay<br />
there might have been some who expected that out of the Summit<br />
we would get an era of peace. 4ell that was never quite, I<br />
think, on the board.<br />
But there wolo two things that I, for on~ e, had hopes<br />
about. One was that they might have agreed to some sort of a<br />
moratorium cabout Berlin. This wretched nagging problem of<br />
Berlin which bordered very close to armed conflict only a fea<br />
years back, until the whole thing was broken by the famous airlift<br />
to Berlin, this nagging problem which goes on and on with<br />
threats on the Eastern side, threats of separate treaties with<br />
East Germany and of closing Berlin out to the i-estern world and<br />
to Western influence. And so most of us had hoped that when<br />
four men of responsible posts got togother they would have<br />
said: " Well there is plenty of time to settle all these<br />
allegedly legal arguments about Berlin; let's have a moratorium<br />
on that",<br />
And in the second place that we might have seen some<br />
answer to the problem of nuclear tests. Because at Geneva they<br />
had been discussing with each other for a long timeu the problem<br />
of suspending nuclear tests on both sides, with an adequate<br />
system of inspection. They had got so close together that I<br />
thought myself that all it needed was a good nudge by the four<br />
people meeting together at the Summit, to close the gap and<br />
bring about at least that measure of relief from tension.<br />
And so it was a tragedy for the world, a tragedy for<br />
ordinary men and women all over the world, people who have a<br />
vested interest in being kept out of the horrors of another war.<br />
It was a tragedy that this one man, on the feeblest excuse in<br />
the world, should have wiped the Summit Meeting out before it<br />
began. Ile must beware of the propagandists, because the<br />
propagandists, the Communist propagandists, would have you<br />
believe that the reason why he did that was the Americans had<br />
had a plane over Russia taking photographs.<br />
Well I'm bound to say two things, ladies and gentlemen:<br />
one is: it may have been very unwise to have a plane at<br />
that time, but at some time or another, I think a very .:, ood idea.<br />
Lot us just reason together a little about this matter, this<br />
famous U2. Did he complain about the U2 because he was shocked<br />
at the idea that somebody was spying on his country? a strange<br />
kind of sheok for a Communist to suffer from., the strangest in<br />
the world. Of course he wasn't. He regarded it in the first<br />
place as rather a nice trick that he had taken. This plane had<br />
come down, or had been brought down, he had the pilot, and I can </p>
<p>almost imagine him saying, " Ab, I've taken the first trick in<br />
this game; now I'll have them in trouble". But all in a<br />
sense good clean fun, you know. ( Laughter) Until, of course,<br />
he suddenly realised, and so did the famous Marshal Malenovsky,<br />
that this plane was 1 000 miles inside the Russian frontier a<br />
thousand miles. And that as it could be guessed pretty safely<br />
it was by no means the first, but it was the first to be detected<br />
and brought down, this was a little embarrassing: this meant<br />
that without intercontinental ballistic missiles these<br />
wretched things that some day, let's say, will be capable of<br />
being popped up and dropped on to the precise spot in another<br />
continent even in the absence of those, quite clearly, aircraft,<br />
flying at a suitable height, couiA deliver nuclear<br />
weapons deep into the Soviet Union. In other words, the nuclear<br />
deterrent was disc losed in one flash as being immeasurably more<br />
powerful than Khrushchtev had ever been prepared to admit. And<br />
all his protestations to his own people that the counter-attack<br />
was ' kn absurdity, just fell to the ground. And that, I am<br />
sure, with suitablecomplaints in his headquarters, induced in<br />
him this fit of rage which may have begun by being synthetic<br />
but ended up by being very real, in which he just blew the<br />
whole thing out.<br />
Wiell I don't suppose that that is the end of it, because<br />
you remember that very shortly afterwards he said that we<br />
might perhaps have a Summit in another six or seven months'<br />
time, meaning by that after the American Presidential election.<br />
And I don't myself despair of that being the case: I think<br />
that very well might turn out to be the case.<br />
I don't quite knew what the famous Khrushchev has in<br />
his mind on that point because that was, I thought, just about<br />
as good an indication as anything could be, that he would wait<br />
until he could deal with a Democratic President. And if I had<br />
been a Democrat in the United States of America I would have<br />
thought that was very dubious assistance to have my Party told<br />
that it would be more likely to be agreeable to Mr. Khrushchev<br />
than the Republican Party, I don't think for one moment that<br />
that is true, but they have strange ideas in their minds<br />
occasionally about the Western psychology. I hope, and believe,<br />
that after the Presidential election he will get an unpleasant<br />
surprise whichever candidate wins.<br />
Now, Sir, the ether thing that I want to mention to<br />
you is thils I was talking about this Cold liar. W~ e have<br />
seen two things of dramatic importance in the Middle East and<br />
in the Jest in our recent lives: the first of them was Suez,<br />
whore, in the result Colonel Nasser got awray with it had a<br />
great success, developed immense prestige in the Middle East,<br />
with the result that the Middle East has been in this place and<br />
that in a state of foment ever since. And the second one is<br />
the incidents in Cuba.<br />
You know we have fed so well on sensations in our<br />
lifetimes, in this century of sonsations, that we hale almost<br />
lost our capacity for surprise everything just seems to be<br />
another incident, and what of it.<br />
But this performance by Fidel Castro in Ct': ba is on<br />
all fours with the performances of Nasser. And as you haven't<br />
failed to observe, not only has he been treating the United<br />
States, his near neighbour, with open contempt, but he has been<br />
getting away with it, getting away wi-th their investments,<br />
getting away with their money, getting away with their interests<br />
calling in aid, the Soviet Union, getting large and<br />
posihive help from Khrushchev, doing all that he can to convert<br />
Cuba into a Soviet base right off the shores of the United<br />
States. That to me is one of the great crucial things that has<br />
happened of late. It indicat * es something that you and I have<br />
to give a lot of thought to. 14hat it illustrates is that small </p>
<p>countries today are not unwilling to treat with contumely the<br />
large powers of the world. They will turn to them for protection;<br />
but they will use their own voice, and the voice of an<br />
aggregation of other small countries, to defeat and humiliate<br />
them if they can.<br />
I hope that the United States of America, with its<br />
passionate belief in the United Nations, as the saviour won't<br />
be too disillusioned if Castro rallies in the United Nations a<br />
few score of countries, small in themselves, all willing to<br />
" have a go" at the big fallow.<br />
This is a very disturbing state of affairs and it will<br />
require two things: it will require immense strength and<br />
readiness and determination in the great powers in the United<br />
States of America, in the United Kingdom, in France, which is<br />
recovering rapidly in modern terms great strength and determination<br />
on their part, great unity between them so th~ at<br />
they are not divided and conquered. And for us, who are of the<br />
free world, it reminds that we should be increasingly conscious<br />
of what is going on outside, of our duty to our friends of our<br />
readiness ourselves to play our part in the affairs of the free<br />
world, and in our capacity, because of character and determination,<br />
to earn the respect and friendship of these great countries<br />
upon whom the security of the world depends,<br />
These are vitally important considerations. I know<br />
that there are some people who say: " Oh, what has that got to<br />
do with Australia?" Some fellow, the other day in Melbourne,<br />
I noticed, talked about Foreign Affairs, " What has that got to<br />
do with Australia?". Voll if that state of mind prevailed in<br />
this country we would be finished. vie are an adult nation. We<br />
are ten million people it's quite true but believe me, we<br />
are listenedtto in the rest of theo world in a Prime Ministers'<br />
Conference, in a meeting of the South-East Asian Treaty, in a<br />
meeting of ANZUS with the United States of America. In all<br />
these things in Whitehall and in Washington Australia is<br />
listened to and, I'm proud to say, listened to with sympathy<br />
and respect. ( Appla~ use). We are not to underestimate our-selves0<br />
And because of that I believe we must look forwad to a<br />
period in front of us when Australia will increasingly become<br />
known as a country with internationai outlook and intc-, rational<br />
ideas. These very matters that I have mentioned and thoe<br />
are only a few out of miiany are the best proof that thla-oe<br />
matters on the world stage are immeasurably more important than<br />
any of the things that we argue about of a domestic kind inside<br />
our own country. And they have a great habit of coming home,<br />
Twice in this century they have dome home. Does anybody suppose<br />
that if the world fell into nuclear war or indeed a global war<br />
of any kind, we would be innocent bystanders? Not at all. And<br />
the contribution that a country can make to the solution of the<br />
world's problems is not measured by the population of the<br />
country. There are some very large countries in the world that<br />
have contributed mighty little to the solving of the world's<br />
problems one or two of them not far away from us, like<br />
Communist China. And yet on the other hand there are smaller<br />
countries which make a contribution. I venture to say that<br />
under Mr. Harold Macmillan, Great Britain is more and more<br />
restoring herself to a position of, intellectual and moral<br />
leadership in the world. ( Applause)<br />
Now, Sir, Cuba may seem a long way away, That phrase<br />
reminds me, if I may interrupt myself, that back in 1935 I think<br />
it was, I had a conversation with President Roosevelt in Washington<br />
at the Vhitehouse and I asked him a highly hypoi. hetical<br />
question about what the attitude of America would be if Australia~ </p>
<p>got into any kind of trouble. And ' iith that characteristic<br />
smile of his, he said: " Well you know what my mind is on that,<br />
but what my people would say I wouldn't know!. You know they<br />
might say: ' It's a long ways away'.' 1 I couldn't object to<br />
that, because that's just what we say, isn't it, about some of<br />
the events of the world.<br />
Today that attitude has entirely disappeared. One<br />
never meets an American who doesn't know about Australia and<br />
Australians, and very seldom does one meet one who hasn't either<br />
himself or by a brother-, or a cousin, or an uncle, been in<br />
Australia either during the war or after it. And ther-, fore we<br />
are on c-lose easy friendly terms with them.<br />
But, despite all that, you may say: " IVell Cuba is a<br />
long way from us". But Communis China isn't. If we look up<br />
north: Indonesia is not far from us; Singapore is not far<br />
from us. I only realised the other day how short a distance it<br />
is to Singapore, because if you leave Darwin by plane today you<br />
are in Singapore in about three htours' time. North of Singapore,<br />
you have Malaya and you have Thailand; you have South<br />
Viet Nam, Laos, Cambodia and all around them on the top and at<br />
the sides you have the Communist forces whether they are the<br />
forces of North Viet Nam, or the forces of Continental China<br />
itself. And there is in all these places a constant pressure.<br />
Communist China, they estimate, will have by the turn of the<br />
century a thousand million people. And they won't be untrained<br />
or ill-informed. That is a long way off it's forty years<br />
hence and in 40O years enormous strides can be made in industrial<br />
development, in the organisation of military activities<br />
enormous strides. A thousand million people.<br />
My friend, Mr. Nehru, the Prime M nister of India,<br />
ought to be the last man to be undier attack by Chou En-lai, of<br />
China, because sometimes, at the risk of unpopularity with some<br />
of us, he has sought to explain their point of view, has<br />
maintained diplomatic relations with then he is no Communist<br />
himself, of course but he has always tried to act as a sort<br />
of moderating and interpreting element between Communist China<br />
and the rest of the free world. And for his reward he finds<br />
that Tibet is dealt with by Communist China in a most violent<br />
fashion, rofugoes are streaming over the frontier and the<br />
frontier2 of India have boen violated and are at this rioment,<br />
violated by Communist China, A pretty poor reward for honourable<br />
conduct. And the result of it, of course, is that India,<br />
now, is in a state of mind of feeling apprehensive about the<br />
thrust of these arrogant people.<br />
We have the South East Asia Treaty Organisation. It<br />
was my own Government that played a leading hand in organising<br />
it. We have the ANZUS pact with the United States and New<br />
Zealand of which we were certainly -the promoters. These are<br />
of great potential value. In the South East Asian Treaty we<br />
have Pakistan, and we have two or three of the Asian countries<br />
plus Great Britain and France, and the United States and New<br />
Zealand and ourselves. And there we are, 1Wbhra d a meeting<br />
in 1-Jashington. There is, I think, a greowing sense of community.<br />
But there again I had occasion to point out that all the<br />
organisational arrangements, all the military planning in the<br />
world, wouldn't make our Organisation effective if there were<br />
internal disputes inside our own frontiers, so to speak.<br />
And to take an example:, Cambodia, which is one of<br />
the protected countries under th. is iireaty, has a quarrel with<br />
Thailand and it gets very heated. It is over something that I<br />
would have regarded as quite trivial, but it goes on. Then<br />
another country has another argument with somebody over a couple </p>
<p>of islands of no great intrinsic value except as a matter of<br />
prestige. And, as I pointed out to them, unless you can settle<br />
these irritating points of difference, you will find that the<br />
Communists are not fools they love to intervene where there<br />
are private disputes, they like to exaggerate them, they like<br />
to fish in troubled waters. And so long as they can fish in<br />
troubled waters our side of their frontier then we are<br />
weakening our own position and exposing ourselves to great risk.<br />
Well I hope that those things will be solved because<br />
and here again is my point it is only by the utmost unity,<br />
not only by treaty, but by the spirit between the nations in<br />
the South East Asian Treaty Organisation, that we have any<br />
chance of ultimate salvation. Unity, unity, unity must be the<br />
thing to be achieved all over the free world, whether it is in<br />
our own Party or in our own nation or in the international<br />
field. Disunity means disaster.<br />
Our opponents, to go down to the political field, in<br />
Canberra have an expert know~ ledge of that truth.<br />
Now, Sir, I have spoken a long time Jout those<br />
matters, but I have spoken about them because I believe that we<br />
are going through a tough, rough, international period. That<br />
doesn't mean that I believe that Khrushchev wants to start a<br />
war. As always, he will go as far as he can, as boldly as ho<br />
can, as bullyingly as he can, up to the point at which he sees<br />
a strong prospect that this will be resisted by force. And in<br />
the meantime they go on, probing here, probing there sometimes<br />
it is a relatively small matter; sometimes it is a<br />
relatively g,, reat mattes:. But every time there is a probe of<br />
that kind and it succeeds, and we simply fall back on vague<br />
generalisations and arguments with each other every time that<br />
happens another step has been taken in the march of Communism<br />
in the world a march which, of course, is welcomed by the<br />
Communist Fifth Columnists inside Australia; and apparently not<br />
entirely disfavoured by those) who are willing to ally themselves<br />
with them, but a march of the greatest gravity for all of us.<br />
I Trould just like to add to that that there is going<br />
to be a Presidential election in Ameirica; there is going to be<br />
an election in Ceylon shortly: " Uhat though the tropic breezes<br />
blow soft o'er Ceylon's isle". Some of us have been there a<br />
lovely place, marvellous place, happy people. They have two<br />
Communist Parties in their Parliament and those Parties, in this<br />
election, are active and make no secret of the fact that if they<br />
can socure an alliance what you might call a unity ticket<br />
with one of the major opposition parties, then they will be<br />
inside that Party if it wins and they will ultimately get<br />
command of it. I am most unhappy and you would be too at<br />
the very thought that it might be possible for Ceylon to come<br />
under Communist influence.<br />
B~ ut it is not the only place. Before I finish, let me<br />
say this to you: people have talked so much about South Africa<br />
that they have, perhaps, forgotten that that is only a small<br />
portion of Africa. There are 200 million people in Africa and<br />
all moving with tremendous speed towards self-government.<br />
People have a great itch for political self-government it is<br />
understandable. Very few of them worry a-bout economic selfgovernrment".<br />
It is rather, to people like ourselves,-" a little<br />
astonishing to find that there is no recognition that there is<br />
a distinction between political independence and economic<br />
dependence on the rest of the world. But there it is. And it<br />
has this effect: political independence they are going to<br />
have willy-nilly. Sometimes, as in the case of Ghana, with<br />
grea goodwill; as in the case of Nigeria very soon, with<br />
great goodwill; sometimes, as in the case of the Congo, with<br />
the absolute certainty, as most of us believed, of riot and<br />
bloodshed which is now going on because circumstances were </p>
<p>I 8.<br />
differaint. Gr~ eat Britain is the one power, in my opinion, in<br />
the world that understands or has understood the colonial<br />
problem, and how to bring people up to a stage of governing<br />
themselves. But there is one remarkable truth, greatly forgotten<br />
I fear, and that is that if these nations in Africa achieve<br />
their political independence at a time when they are not<br />
economically capable of survival, and therefore need great help,<br />
economically, they will either get it from the free world or<br />
they will got it from the Soviet Union. And if they get it<br />
from the Soviet Union, which is busy today examining Africa,<br />
then before long they will find that they have fallen into the<br />
hands of the Soviet Union, that they are mere catspaws for the<br />
Soviet Union. And therefore, from that point of view, there is<br />
an enormous task in front of the doestern world not to diminish<br />
its help to other countries, but to increase its help to other<br />
countries. Unless we of the destern world, we in our small way<br />
and other great countries in their large way, face up to the<br />
duty of doing something about these emergent African States we<br />
may wake up, or our children may wake up some day, to find that<br />
there is a great Communist Continent. That would be, I think,<br />
more than Australia could surviv3.<br />
There is another aspect of it and it is a very humane<br />
one, and as we are a humane Party with, I am happy to say, a<br />
magnificent record of humanity in legislation and provision, we<br />
might think about it. One of the ironies of the (, Iorld is that<br />
the highly developed industrial countries are developing more<br />
and more rapidly every year, as technology, technical skills,<br />
scientific efforts and the progress of an industrial country<br />
improves. It is remarkable. But in these under-developed<br />
countries, like these emergent nations in Africa and in Asia<br />
progress is nothing like so fast it can't be: they do no<br />
have the technical resources; they do not have the technicians.<br />
And therefore their rate of progress is slow, while our rate of<br />
progress is rapid. And that means and this is a simple truth,<br />
easily to be overlooked that the gap between their standards<br />
of living and ours, instead of diminishing, is increasing. Now<br />
that, I think, is something wihich must make us all furiously<br />
think that in spite of what g; oes on, the gap increases. And as<br />
the gap increases, so will the inevitable resentment and<br />
frustration of these people grow more and more strong. And in<br />
that atm.-osphere, the Com-. munists, the overthrowers, have a great<br />
opportunity. And therefore so far as all the free world is<br />
concerned, it will have to divert more and more time, and<br />
thought, and money a-, nd sacrifice to helping other human beings<br />
in the world to raise their standards of living, to get into<br />
that condition of life in which Communism will not interest<br />
theom, will have w appeal to them and in i , hichi by their very<br />
realisation that there has been a warm and friendly atmosphere<br />
in the world, they may themselves powerfully contribute to the<br />
peace of mankind. </p>
