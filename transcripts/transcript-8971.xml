TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH THE PRIME MNINSTER, THlE HION.<br />
P. J. KEATING, M. P. SHELBOURNE HOTEL, DUIRLIN, IRELAND<br />
SUNDAY 19 SEPTEMBER, 1993<br />
PM: I was received in audience by her Majesty the Queen at Balmoral Castle<br />
Yesterday and there is a long-standing convention that the contents of these<br />
conversations remain confidential. But, I am able to say that I explained to<br />
Her Majesty that, notwithstanding the deep respect and warm affection felt<br />
towards her by the Australian people, there is a growing feeling that Australia<br />
should make the necessary constitutional changes to allow the appointment of<br />
an Australian Head of State. I said such a move was seen as weessary to<br />
establish clearly Australia's identity as an independent nation.<br />
1 outlined to Her Majesty the various steps that would be involved in such a<br />
proceis including the need for a referendum to approve constitutional<br />
amendments. I explained that the Australian Government's view was that if<br />
approved by the Australian people at a referendum, it would be appropriate for<br />
Australia to become a republic by the centenary of our Federation in the year<br />
2001. 1 told Her Majesty that in such a situation Austraia would remain a<br />
member of the Commonwealth of Nations and that the Australian people<br />
would warmly welcome visits to Australia by Her Majesty as Head of the<br />
Commonwealth, as Queen of the United Kingdom.<br />
Her Majesty authoriscd me to say that she would, of course, act on the advice<br />
of her Australian Ministers as she always has, and on any decision made by<br />
the Australian people.<br />
J: Prime Minister, how did the Queen take to being told by you that there was no<br />
place for her ( inaudible) in Australia's future?<br />
PM: Well. as said to you. I arn not breaking the convention of giving you details<br />
of the conversation or its ambience except to say that the visit was a most<br />
enjoyable one for Mrs Keating and 1. T'here was a most cordial atmosphere<br />
there, and it was friendly and relaxed and I came away after a very nice<br />
afternoon and evening with Her Majesty and her famnily. </p>

Prime Minister has the extension of Governor General Bill Hayden's term got<br />
anything to do with your republican timetable?<br />
PM: No, I'd spoken tv the Governor General briefly about this matter some time<br />
ago and as this is a matter for Her Majesty's pleasure neither he, the Governor<br />
General, nor I could then progress the matter without my first having had a<br />
discussion with the Queen. And she's indicated to me that she is pleased by<br />
the Governor General's proposed extension and hence we will now put the<br />
procedures in place for the Governor General's term to be extended until early<br />
in 1996.<br />
J: Why do you want it extended?<br />
PM: Well, I think that it's a matter that the Governor General seems to be very<br />
broadly accepted by the Australian public and by both sides of Australian<br />
politics and he has obviously both enjoyed and taken great interest in the<br />
position. So, not unnaturally, I've said to him," Should you wish to extend I<br />
should be pleased to raise this matter with Her Majesty." He said to me, " I<br />
am," and so I dld.<br />
J: By extending the term to 1996 though it does mean that if your timetable<br />
comes to pass the next Governor General would be the last before the first<br />
Australian Head of State.<br />
PM: That would be so.<br />
1: Mr Keating the Queen saying that she would act on the advice of the<br />
Australian Ministers on any decision of the Australian people, is that the kind<br />
of green light you were hoping to get?<br />
PM Well, look, the statement's there, and it's there. It's there in print and I don't<br />
want to amplify it.<br />
J: On the subject of Bill Hayden's extension, did his warnings about the dangers<br />
of certain models of a republic influence your thinking or did that make you<br />
think twice or...( inaudible)...?<br />
PM: The Governor General and I discussed this some time ago and it was then<br />
simply a matter of me raising it. with the Queen, which I have. So nothing that<br />
he's said in the last day, or week, in any way has influenced the decision.<br />
J: What do you think of whathe said?<br />
PM: Well, I think he thought he was taken out of context and then quickly went to<br />
clear the context up.<br />
TEL </p>
<p>TEL -3-<br />
J: Did you ( inaudible)..?<br />
PM I didn't read the full text.<br />
J: When do you think the referendum will be held?<br />
PM Well, that's again a matter for that's a matter for the Australian public and a<br />
matter for debate in Australia. And that debate has already started, it will<br />
obviously again revolve around the presentation of the report of the<br />
Committee we've established and so no doubt in 1994 well see some, I think,<br />
you know, some real reflections by all concerned in Australia upon the merits<br />
of a republic and the modalities of such a change.<br />
1: ( inaudible)... dangers ofa popularly elected President. I know that you told<br />
the Turnbull Committee that you had a reservations about that. Are you<br />
prepared to go public on those reservation3?<br />
PM: Well I think that's probably a conversation for when rm at home. I did speak<br />
to the Turnbull Committee about some of those matters but I think that's a<br />
debate for another place and another time and I'm quite happy to have it then,<br />
really.<br />
PM: I have to go now.<br />
I: Mr Keating, how would you describe the circumstances of the step taken at<br />
Balmoral?<br />
PM: I'm sorry, I have to go.<br />
Ends. 20. Sep. 93 8: 05 No. 006 P. 05/ 05 </p>
