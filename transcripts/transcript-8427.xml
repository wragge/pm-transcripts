TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH DEAN BANKS, 3AW<br />
27 FEBRUARY 1992<br />
E OE PROOF ONLY<br />
J: Good morning. Are you happy with the initial reation<br />
to the package?<br />
PM: Yes I think so. It is a reasonably good response.<br />
People believe, I think, that now is the time for the<br />
Government to lift activity in the economy, to spend some<br />
money, after all we, were very abstemious in the 1980s,<br />
turning these huge deficits into surpluses and when private<br />
spending was strong in the ' 80s we pulled the Government<br />
back. But now private spendings weak, this is now the time<br />
for the Government to spend and do a lot of sensible things<br />
like railways, like roads, like technical and further<br />
education etc.<br />
J: Reaction is all important for you and I suppose<br />
economics is supposed to be a fairly clinical matter that is<br />
easy to work out, yet you have the situation where someone<br />
like Robert Gottliebsen comes out this morning and says that<br />
he basically likes it, whereas your old sparing partner<br />
Terry McCrann comes out and gives you a right old bucketing.<br />
PM: But he always has old Terry, he's to the right of<br />
Ganghis Kahn, but it wouldn't be fun if he wasn't there<br />
would it? That's the point, I mean if he came and gave the<br />
package an endorsement I would have to have a good hard look<br />
at myself.<br />
J: It would be the kiss of death do you think?<br />
PM: The fact is it is a great package for the community in<br />
general. For the business community it is a revolutionary<br />
change, it's depreciation for business, and for the<br />
community in general, apart from the payment to families, it<br />
is rebuiulding a lot of our basic infrastructure and getting<br />
employment from it. That is, in rebuilding the whole<br />
railway system, in doing the ring roads around the capital<br />
cities, in a new electricity grid, all these things are long </p>
<p>term things for Australia and they can only be done by the<br />
Government, t~ hey can't be done by the private sector. The<br />
private sector is not going to rebuild a Sydney-Melbourne<br />
railway, the private sector is not going to put a standard<br />
gauge rail from Melbourne to Adelaide, it's not going to do<br />
any of those things, so if you get John Hewson on the<br />
program he won't be doing them. Nobody of that ilk<br />
believes, that McCrann doesn't believe it, but we know that<br />
it's crazy to be carrying around our merchandised freight on<br />
trucks between Sydney and Melbourne, crashing into each<br />
other, killing people on roads, breaking up highways, these<br />
are the things that Government should be doing.<br />
J: Prime MiLnister, Dr John Michael Hewson as we dub him,<br />
has been talking about paying by bankcard and also where<br />
there's a will there's a way.<br />
PM: Yes that: is an absurd simile. Look, in the 1980s I<br />
cut, as Treasurer, the public sector back by $ 30,000 million<br />
a year, 7 per cent of GDP, $ 30 billion a year. We have got<br />
a structural surplus laying under the current account<br />
deficit, as soon as the economy starts to pick up it jumps<br />
back into sur7plus and it does under this package by 1995.<br />
So all this stuff about bankcard and that is simply him,<br />
exploiting what he thinks is the ordinary persons lack of<br />
understanding of the national budgetary accounts. The fact<br />
is, this is hialf a per cent of gross domestic product, half<br />
a per cent of the size of the economy. The economy is about<br />
$ 400 billion in size, this is $ 2 billion, it's half of a per<br />
cent. When : 1 became Treasurer, I picked up John Howard and<br />
John Hewson who was his adviser, I picked up their deficit<br />
and it was 9 per cent of GDP, nearly $ 9 billion, about 5 per<br />
cent of GDP. This thing is half a per cent of GDP. Talk<br />
about bankcar: d, he didn't leave me bankcard, he left: me a<br />
mountain of debt to scramble over in the ' 80s and then<br />
tottled off to the private sector and came back when the<br />
dirty work had been completed.<br />
J: We all : Look for deals in this grand economic statement<br />
and we all wonder whether there will be some pay-back to<br />
Victoria. You've no doubt, just done an interview on Sydney<br />
radio with A: lan Jones, is there significant whining from NSW<br />
about special treatment to Victoria?<br />
PM: No, NSW has done exceptionally well. The big projects<br />
are the same in most of the capitals. For Sydney and<br />
Melbourne, for NSW and Victoria the principle project is the<br />
rebuilding of the Sydney-Melbourne railway line. To get the<br />
efficiencies of that up and giving quick access out of<br />
Sydney by re--buiiding a line out of Enfield and re-building<br />
that whole structure at Dynon in Melbourne and for Victoria,<br />
then the standard gauge rail from Melbourne to Adelaide<br />
which will do a great deal for Melbourne as a transport hub.<br />
It's the place where freight can be shifted north to Sydney,<br />
west to Adelaide, west to Perth and south to Tasmania and<br />
what we are doing in this package is giving Melbourne the<br />
chance to really have a new industry, that is a service<br />
industry in freight. </p>
<p>J: How are you going to sell it, are you going to spend<br />
time now out of Canberra and across the country?<br />
PM: I will be doing a bit of that, but I will also be doing<br />
a bit of this. The good thing about communications is you<br />
can be in Canberra and talk to you this morning here and not<br />
on a telephone, also with voice quality radio.<br />
J: What about this extra couple of hundred dollars that<br />
families are going to get. Is that enough to kick start the<br />
economy? PM: Well what we tried to do, because the big projects like<br />
the ring roads, for instance that ring road around<br />
Melbourne, we are re-building another sector of that between<br />
the Hume Highway and the Calder Highway. Now those sorts of<br />
projects are important for the city of Melbourne, it takes<br />
traffic out of the city, but it takes a while to build it<br />
up. It will take a while now to get that cracking. We<br />
wanted a way of being able to inject some fiscal stimulus<br />
and spending power into the economy early and we thought the<br />
best way of doing that was a payment to families. So<br />
they'll actually start spending and lift consumer spending<br />
and it will lift it early, we can do that in April, whereas<br />
the other things will take more time. So we wanted<br />
something in the spending profile to happen earlier and<br />
that's why we think the best way to do it is to inject some<br />
money into the economy and the best place to do it is into<br />
families. J: This country isn't the only country that is suffering<br />
from a recession, as your old mate Max Walsh observed last<br />
night, aren't you being a little ambitious trying to lead<br />
the world out of recession?<br />
PM: No because we are in the fastest growing part of the<br />
world. We are not sitting waiting on the European community<br />
to tottle along at 2 per cent a year or the United States at<br />
one. We are in the Asia-Pacific which is growing at 6-8 per<br />
cent a year and the other thing is because for 40 years we<br />
were in the Rip-Van-Wrinkle years of Menzies, and as a<br />
result we missed the whole post-war trade in goods and<br />
services. We are now picking that trade up in tourism, in<br />
manufactured exports. In other words we are getting a share<br />
of something that in the past eluded us, so that is why we<br />
can actually grow our merchandise trade account faster than<br />
say a comparable country could if it were part of the<br />
northern hemisphere or part of Europe or part of North<br />
America. We are in the fastest growing part of the world.<br />
So Max ( Walsh) was carrying on last night about how we<br />
shouldn't be spending any money does anyone really believe<br />
with Australia in a recession as we are, trying to get out<br />
of this hole that we should do nothing, do nothing? To<br />
spend $ 2.3 billion in a budget of $ 100 billion? </p>
<p>4<br />
J: Dare I say it., we're not waiting for the world.<br />
PM: No# we're getting cracking.<br />
J. Were you concerned when they came to you, or somebody<br />
advised you, that this package needed a name called One Nation.<br />
I mean we've had all these names, Priority One, Fightback and<br />
Clever Country and all these....<br />
PM: What I want to do is to give the sense that this is a<br />
partnership proposition between government and business. The tax<br />
concessions there for depreciation are really quite profound.<br />
They put Australia back in the big league, in terms of tax<br />
provisions for business, and the big capital works programs are<br />
also about trying to get employment going and use parts of the<br />
business community to supply those goods and services employed in<br />
those programs. We're also involving the trade unions who have<br />
given a committment to keep Australia's inflation rate at our<br />
trading partners' average. In other words, we're bringing the<br />
place together, One Nation, and that's why I thought, well look<br />
we are bringing i. t I'm not Hewsoi, I'm not saying we'll wipe<br />
unions out, I'm not saying there'll be no national wage cases,<br />
I'm not saying, as he said, don't talk to business, they're only<br />
after handouts. Hewson criticized me for talking to the business<br />
community in those consultations. He's about dividing and<br />
splitting the place up and I wanted to make the point that<br />
Labor's about saying look, we can do this but only do it together<br />
as one nations<br />
j: T. get a strange sense of deja vua, Prime Minister, about One<br />
Nation because it was vaguely reminiscent of the basic approach<br />
that your predecessor took when he took over in 1983, about<br />
ending divisiveness.<br />
PM: I think we proved in the eighties that a country that talked<br />
to itself, where unions talked to government and government<br />
talked to business and unions talked to business and particularly<br />
now with enterprise bargaining, you end up with a better economic<br />
outcome. You see we grew every year for eight years at twice the<br />
pace in the eighties than we grew for the previous eight years in<br />
the seventies. We had five times as much employment growth in<br />
the eighties as we had in the seventies and we had that because<br />
we had a more cohesive society. Consultation, talking to people<br />
and getting their support for things is the way governments<br />
should run the place, and this idea that you're governed by a<br />
press statement, that some Liberal Cabinet sits in a locked up<br />
room then puts a statement in the press boxes and the nation<br />
springs to attention is a bit of old nonsense, because they did<br />
that In the seventies and what we had was 1.8% growth a year<br />
instead of 4.2. And we had three hundred thousand jobs tn seven<br />
years instead of 1.5 million as we did. I mean it just works, it<br />
works. </p>
<p>J6. Prime Minister, we get locked into all the terminology when<br />
we talk about economic statements. Can you help us with the<br />
estimate,, the forecast and the scenario?<br />
PM; Look what we try and do in these things is we have these<br />
things called national forecasting models and we try and forecast<br />
activity some years out, and what we believe is that we'll have a<br />
reasonably strong pick-up in activity in ' 92-3 of about four and<br />
three quarter percent through the year, and we believe that over<br />
the forecast period which is four years that we'll be able to<br />
produce about eight hundred thousand jobs. In other words,<br />
reducing and not just finding enough jobs to take up new entrants<br />
to the workforce, the school leavers etcetera, but to actually<br />
then cut into unemployment, the pool of unemployment.<br />
J: Your colleague John Dawkins has said that some of the<br />
figures are based on scenario. How close does scenario get t~ o<br />
rbak guess?<br />
PM: There's 9L fair bit of science in all this but these models<br />
picked the turn in ' 84-5. when I first became Treasurer we<br />
forecast a through the year growth phase of six percent and<br />
people said oh this is terribly optimistic Treasurer, thin is<br />
only a bit of greenhorn stuff because you're new in the job. But<br />
the six percent turned up. I mean we're not always correct as<br />
you know. I mean these estimates are done by the Treasury and<br />
the Reserve Bank and the statisticians, in the main. They're not<br />
always correct but they're the best summation that can be put<br />
together. is We were ta: lking about the theatre of the moment earlier this<br />
morning Prime Minister. I mean is it the same for you as Prime<br />
Minister of a nation, the reaction of the newspapers around the<br />
country this morning, those headlines, the critics'<br />
observations. I mean are you happy with the response there?<br />
PM: I think so. From our point of view it couldn't be any<br />
fairer than it:' s been. You'll always have the McCranns of this<br />
world who say don't give anybody an even break, just make it hard<br />
and tough, survival of the fittest, if you haven't got a quid<br />
you're a bludger, if you're not a millionaire you're a bum,<br />
that's the McCrann view of the world, that's fine. I just reject<br />
that absolutely. </p>
<p>6<br />
3: Well today is sort of make or break day for you in a sense,<br />
isn't it, because you are out selling it today, and I note with<br />
interest that you are doing a television interview tonight with<br />
Derryn Hinch. At which precise moment did you two kiss and make<br />
up? PM: It's not a matter of kissing and making up but just that the<br />
sort of form-at of his program he had in the past has never quite<br />
suited me, the time Blot and everything else and I never did much<br />
with him. But the fact is I'll be pleased to talk to him. The<br />
main thing is, look this is a four year plan for Australia. The<br />
main paint about this is it's Labor doing what it does best and<br />
that is the b. Lg building programs of Australia. It's only ever<br />
been the Labor Party that's built the big railways and did the<br />
big road developments and the ringroads and the rest, that's what<br />
we're doing again, a national electricity grid. The Liberals<br />
gave us a two airline policy and high airfares, we're junking it.<br />
We're letting Qantas fly internally, we're letting the domestic<br />
airlines fly outside of Australia. It's only Labor that picked<br />
up all those kids and gave them university places in the eighties<br />
and gave them places in school. We're going to do it again now<br />
in technical and further education. This is not a miserable<br />
exercise in accountancy like Dr Hewson's Fightback , you know,<br />
changing the tax system from income to expenditure I mean<br />
essentially an irrelevant change. Apart from being an unfair<br />
change, an irrelevant change, because that change is not going to<br />
improve a railway line, it's not going to improve the airports or<br />
the seaports. It can only be done by governments and that's what<br />
this huge package is about.<br />
Jo: Small business in the country has been crying, naturally,<br />
you've made some changes there as far as small business is<br />
concerned. Could you outline those changes as far ats the banks<br />
are concerned?<br />
PM: The ban): change is quite important. At the moment a bank<br />
can't write off a debt unless it sends a business into<br />
receivership. J: Does that apply to all banks or is the Commonwealth exempt<br />
there? PM: No, all banks. Now what this means is that a bank can now<br />
write off a partial debt. So let's say somebody owed a million<br />
dollars for instance, and the bank decided to put them into<br />
receivership and they wrote off the million. What they could do<br />
now is write off half a million and let the business remain<br />
viable. Do yo'u understand? </p>
<p>J: Yes.<br />
PM: It's quite a big change.<br />
J: And somebody could've been caught in that position by say the<br />
mortgage on their house and the valuation of their property today<br />
to be a lot less which is worrying the bank.<br />
PM: Well it could be that somebody says look this person's been<br />
good, I don't want to sell them up, what we'll do is we'll take a<br />
partial write-off here and we'll keep them going. Because peopl. e<br />
might be able to service half a debt or two thirds of the debt<br />
but they can't service it all. So it's a big change for the<br />
banks and the Treasurer met the banks and said look we're doing<br />
this for you, we want you to do something for the community. We<br />
want you to start opening your pockets up again. We're tired of<br />
this sort of conservatism where you've pulled your head in,<br />
you're turning everybody away, you're withdrawing lines of<br />
credit, cut it out, let's get cracking again, help people that<br />
need help, that's what the banking system's for and we'll hel. p<br />
you. J: Look at you personally, your image. There have been some who<br />
say that the wimp, lever has been operated too strongly on you and<br />
that you in the past have been a mongrel and they wouldn't mind a<br />
bit of the mongrel back.<br />
PM: Well look, the problem I've always had is that in the press<br />
conferences I had over the years as Treasurer it was always ray<br />
job to entertain the'press gallery, crack the funny, to educate<br />
them to do all these things. But the bit that always got run on<br />
television was the -hard comment about the day's balance of<br />
payments or something else. But in my normal life, my dealings<br />
with the Cabinet. with the Caucus, with the media, it's always<br />
been discursive, and I think people are starting to see a little<br />
bit of that as me as Prime Minister and they think there's a<br />
change. There really has been no change, that's as I really am.<br />
They're starting to see now me as I really am and not really<br />
through the ofle minute grab or the thirty second grab on the<br />
monthly balance of payments.<br />
Jt On that note, Minister Ros Kelly broke Cabinet<br />
confidentiality with us not so long ago. She told us that you<br />
responded to her in Cabinet by singing the Billy Joel song<br />
Allentown. </p>
<p>PM: Oh yes, that's right. When we were doing some of the<br />
railway discussions and we were talking about some of the<br />
investment allowances for the heavy plant and equipment, you<br />
know, some people Bald well let's not forget some of the short<br />
life things like the computer industries and these sorts of<br />
things. I said look it's not all going to be the Billy Joel<br />
number, it's not going to be the field town, it's not going to be<br />
Allentown, you know, and I gave them a little song, you know.<br />
J: Is there a song for One Nation?<br />
Pm: well it doesn't spring to mind but Advance Australia Fair<br />
will do because this is about advancing Australia. This is about<br />
a bit of vista anti vision and faith in the Australian people.<br />
It's not about basically sticking your hand in their pocket,<br />
taxing the food they put in their mouth, the shirt they put on<br />
their back, and of course, look let me just make this point to<br />
you. If you're earning twenty or thirty thousand dollars a year,<br />
everything you earn you spend, so whether you tax the income or<br />
the expenditure is immaterial, you're taxed a lot. But if you're<br />
earning a hundred and fifty thousand a year, you spend maybe<br />
sixty and you save ninety. IHewson's package -is very unfair to<br />
the low paid and a big' break to the high paid and as well as that<br />
he puts on a tax cut. we've got a tax cut in there of thirty<br />
percent for people from twenty and a half thousand to forty<br />
thousand, a thirty percent rate, but with no fifteen percent<br />
consumption tax. we've got the same rate as he has, thirty, but<br />
no fifteen percent consumption tax. so this package is a package<br />
that helps the average person, the person in the street who's<br />
doing it a bit tough or hasn't got a Job or who's got a job, is<br />
paying a higher marginal rate than they ought to be. This<br />
package is about ill that and it's about building a better<br />
Australia, a more competitive Australia.<br />
J: It's also a very political statement in a sense and you've<br />
got to face an election within fifteen months. Do you<br />
realistically suggest that we be popping down to the TAB and<br />
backing federal Labor?. </p>
<p>PM: Well get on early, that's what I'd say to you. While you're<br />
being offered good odds, hop on. Because look, Dr Hewson's been<br />
terrific while the games's been running his way. For two or<br />
three months he's had a dream ride, but he got a little bit of<br />
criticism in the House on Tuesday from me and he was up yesterday<br />
with a censure motion saying how dare I criticise the economist<br />
who did his Fightback package. The economist who said it will<br />
actually reduce gross domestic product in the economy, it'll<br />
actually increase unemployment, it'll actually increase<br />
inflation, under the three scenarios the economist had proposed<br />
and examined. So what does Dr Heweon do? Get up and move a<br />
censure on me for it. I mean what a shocking thing. I've<br />
actually pointed Ithat his package reduces the size of the<br />
economy, it reduces3 employment and lifts inflation. So as<br />
sensitive as one can be, bang, in he goes with a censure motion<br />
and of course we cleaned him up in fine style.<br />
J: Airight Prime Minister, you've been most generous with your<br />
me this morning. When will you be in Melbourne next?<br />
PM: Well I think tomorrow, I think tomorrow.<br />
J: Alright, we obviously won't be catching up then but maybe<br />
PM: I don't think: so' but I'm there a lot these days. Anyway<br />
thanks for your time.<br />
J: No worries, and you'd be pretty happy with Collingwood's preseason<br />
form.<br />
PM: From what I read l am, yes.<br />
J: Apart from being beaten by the West Coast Eagles...<br />
I'll be seeing Alle= n McAlister soon, he'll bring me up to<br />
J: Alright Prime Minister, thank you.<br />
PM: Thank you again.<br />
