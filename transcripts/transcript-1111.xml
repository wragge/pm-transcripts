COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA<br />
SPEECH BY<br />
The Rt. Hon. SIR ROBERT MENZIES,<br />
M. P.,<br />
ON THE<br />
SECOND READING<br />
OF THE<br />
STATES GRANTS ( SCIENCE LABORATORIES)<br />
BILL 16<br />
[ From the " Parliamentary Debates," 18th May 19651<br />
kSir ROBERT MENZIES ( Kooyongrime<br />
Minister) move-<br />
That the BUi be now read a second time.<br />
This Bill seeks authority for the Government<br />
to continue, during each of the next three<br />
financial years, grants to secondary schools<br />
for the construction and equipment of<br />
science laboratories. Such grants were first<br />
made in the present financial year by authority<br />
of the States Grants ( Science L-aboratories<br />
' and Technical Training) Act 1964.<br />
Operations in this year have demonstrated<br />
~ the value of this form of aid and have re-<br />
WSulted in assistance in varying amounts being<br />
given to an impressive number of secondary<br />
schools. State Governments have been paid<br />
18,900 for provision of laboratories in<br />
~ State schools and this grant, since it was<br />
* ma de on condition that State Governments<br />
did not reduce their own contributions, has<br />
resulted in the States being able to under-<br />
583 1/ 65 take programmes to provide science laboratories<br />
and equipment in 293 more secondary<br />
schools than would otherwise have been<br />
possible. New South Wales intends to provide<br />
facilities in 80 schools, Victoria in 167,<br />
Queensland in 11, South Australia in 18,<br />
Western Australia in 7 and Tasmania in<br />
The States ' have not, for their own good<br />
internal reasons, been able to spend in this<br />
year, all the money made available to them.<br />
However, they have committed it and the<br />
-assurance of a three year programme which<br />
the Bill will give, will enable them to plan<br />
for accelerated spending in the knowledge<br />
that they are assured of the necessary<br />
finance. In the case of indcpendent schools,<br />
œ 1,334,000 was provided this year for<br />
independent schools in the States and<br />
œ E47,000 for independent schools in the<br />
Australian Capital Territory and the<br />
Northern Territory. Of this total sum, </p>
<p>œ 1,200,000 has already been paid to independent<br />
schools and by the end of June<br />
virtually all the funds provided will be<br />
in the hands of the schools and be represented<br />
by laboratories which have been<br />
finished, laboratories which are under construction,<br />
or by modern equipment. In all,<br />
189 independent schools will have been<br />
assisted, 120 by way of grants for laboratories<br />
and equipment and the remainder<br />
by grants for equipment only. At present<br />
708 independent schools are registered with<br />
the Department as being interested in receiving<br />
assistance.<br />
Here again the provision of a three year<br />
programme will enable independent schools<br />
to plan their building programmes ahead in<br />
the knowledge of the amount of assistance<br />
they will receive and the year in which they<br />
will receive it. The scheme has been greatly<br />
assisted by the co-operation of State Governments<br />
most of which have, amongst other<br />
helpful actions, agreed to provide equipment<br />
to independent schools through the same<br />
channels as those through which they provide<br />
equipment to Government schools.<br />
thus ensuring equipment being purchased<br />
at the lowest possible cost.<br />
New South Wales<br />
Victoria Queensland South Australia<br />
Western Australia<br />
Tasmania All States<br />
Australian Capital Territory and Northern<br />
Territory Government Schools The Government has been greatly<br />
helped, too, by the advisory committees in<br />
the States which have recommended<br />
priorities among the many independent<br />
schools which have sought assistance under<br />
the scheme. The Advisory Committee on<br />
Standards has made a most significant contribution<br />
to the success of -the programme<br />
in independent schools. This Committee<br />
has developed a series of laboratory plans<br />
and its members, who all have much experience<br />
in science teaching, visit applicant<br />
schools and give advice on the most suitable<br />
laboratories to meet their individual<br />
needs. Broad proposals for the next three<br />
years have been submitted to the Commonwealth<br />
but have not yet been agreed in<br />
detail. The programme will provide<br />
million for science laboratories and equipment<br />
over each of the next three financial<br />
years. With the permission of the House I<br />
would like to * have incorporated in<br />
" Hansard a table showing the distribution<br />
of the proposed grants among government<br />
and independent schools for each o<br />
the next three financial years.<br />
