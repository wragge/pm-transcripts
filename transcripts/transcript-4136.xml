PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 1 JUNE 1976<br />
DERWENT BRIDGE STUDY<br />
Detailed investigation of the river bed is under way<br />
for the permanent bridge across the Derwent from<br />
Dowsing Point.<br />
In a joint statement today the Premier Mr Neilson, and<br />
the Prime Minister, Mr Fraser, said that the first progress<br />
report covering the period up to 3] March ] 976 had been<br />
received from the Joint Committee on the Second Hobart<br />
Bridge established by the Commonwealth and State Governme-. ts.<br />
The Report indicated that the investigatory drilling<br />
programme began on March 9. The first stage was intended<br />
to cover the total length of the proposed bridge. It<br />
should be complete within four months.<br />
A barge mounted drilling rig was supplied and operated<br />
by the Mines Department while the Public Works Department<br />
was providing direct supervision of the field work and<br />
all laboratory testing of the material encountered.<br />
Good progress had been made with preparatory work for the<br />
second permanent crossing since the Joint Committee was<br />
set up to arrange and co-ordinate investigation and desic-f: r<br />
the bridge and its road approaches.<br />
The firm of Maunsell and Partners had been appointed Cons-! t-=<br />
Engineers for the design of the bridge and related invest--Z---<br />
and studies. Eight alternative design concepts were bein=<br />
appraised for the new bridge which would cross the Derwen-<br />
. just north of the present temporary bridge.<br />
Mr Neilson and Mr Fraser said further drilling would fol:: athe<br />
present initial investigations to provide enough<br />
information at each pier and abutment location to enable<br />
all foundations to be designed with confidence as to founi'-<br />
level and foundation conditions.<br />
An investigation of velocities and directions of river cur_=.<br />
at various depths near the proposed crossing had been starc<br />
by the Hydro-Electric Commission. This information would<br />
necessary for the study of pier protection. / 2 </p>
<p>S A tentative programme for the investigations, studies<br />
and design of the Bridge indicated that design and<br />
documentation to the stage where tenders could be called<br />
would be achieved in the second half of next year.<br />
Four closely related studies concerned with the impact of<br />
a second permanent crossing in Hobart had begun and<br />
should be available to the Joint Committee within four<br />
months. The consulting firm of Atkins Meinhardt was<br />
conducting a study of river transport as it might affect<br />
the design of the Bridge.<br />
The development impact would be assessed by Nicholas<br />
Clark and Associates, while P. G. Pak Poy and Associates<br />
would report on traffic impact.<br />
Mr Neilson and Mr Fraser said an important issue was the<br />
effect of the Bridge on the natural environment and the<br />
local community. The firm of M. S. T. Keys-Young would<br />
investigate this matter.<br />
It was possible the new Bridge would offer an alternative<br />
route into Hobart for the national highway from northern<br />
Tasmania and the Commonwealth Bureau of Roads had been<br />
co. nissioned by the Commonwealth Minister for Transport<br />
( M: r Nixon) to carry out a study of the optional corridors.<br />
The Public Works Deoartment was co-ordinating all the<br />
investigations and studies and also was carrying out plannnand<br />
design of the road approach system and its connections<br />
into the Glenorchy atea.<br />
Mr Neilson and Mr Fraser said that close liaison was<br />
necessary between the various consultants and a number<br />
of local councils and other authorities. Arrangements<br />
were being zade to ensure that the attitude and opinions<br />
of all authorities and the public were obtained and<br />
carefully considered.<br />
The Joint-Ccmmittee's Reports on all investigations<br />
were expected to fully cover the consequences of the decision<br />
to build a new Bridge and the findings should be of<br />
great benefit to planning development in the Hobart area.<br />
