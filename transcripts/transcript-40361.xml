    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Turnbull Government is delivering on its election commitment to support South Australia’s steel sector and workers at Arrium.</p>
<p>The Export Finance and Insurance Corporation will provide a loan under the National Interest Account of $49.2 million for new machinery at the Iron Knob and Iron Baron mines.</p>
<p>This will enable Arrium’s OneWhyalla business to process iron ore to export quality and is expected to boost Arrium’s cash flow by more than $200 million over the next five years.</p>
<p>The investment builds on the Turnbull Government’s ongoing commitment to support Australia’s steel industry, including:</p>
<ul><li>Using Australian steel across our naval shipbuilding program</li>
<li>Upgrading 1200 kilometres of rail line between Adelaide and Tarcoola, worth approximately $80 million to Arrium</li>
<li>Strengthening Australia’s anti-dumping system</li>
</ul><p>The Turnbull Government will continue to work closely with the administrators as they prepare Arrium’s businesses for sale.</p>
