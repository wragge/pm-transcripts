FOR PRESS 6 AUGUST 1978<br />
ELECTORATE TALK<br />
The strength and health of our great rural industries affects<br />
the lives of every Australian. One of the most important<br />
messages your Government is-. trying to make clear is that<br />
there can be no permanent prosperity in the great cities<br />
of Australia, unless there is prosperity in the countryside.<br />
City and country are interdependent. If farmers are not<br />
producing, are not selling, then they' are not adding to<br />
their farms, not makifig improvements, they are not investing.<br />
This has direct impact on companies in the cities producing<br />
farm machinery, equipment, fencing and even affects the<br />
local general store trade. On the other hand, if factories<br />
and industries are not going well in the cities, the whole<br />
country is adversely affected. That is why the Government<br />
determined from the very first days to seek to work in the<br />
interests of all Australians irrespective of where<br />
they live.<br />
We have given considerable assistance to our great rural<br />
industries. We make no bones about it. For too long, farming<br />
communities bore the brunt of inflation and operated in very<br />
depressed markets with low prices and rising costs.<br />
Slowly, the farmer's lot has, improved. For the first time in<br />
maybe a decade, the men and women on the farms and the great<br />
pastoral areas of Australia are looking ahead with confidence.<br />
They are optimistic about the future.<br />
There are a number of reasons, but the key is the fall in<br />
the inflation rates. No group feels the effects of raging<br />
inflation harder than farmers. Costs take of f, prices<br />
remain low and farmers were caught in the squeeze their<br />
incomes weren't indexed like most of the community.<br />
Inflation is now down to 7.9 percent and it is falling, and<br />
that has given farmers new incentive, and new ability, to<br />
compete again. There is confidence in the great rural<br />
communities for other reasons. Sheep prices are reasonable,<br />
wheat and wool prices are good, and the beef industry is now<br />
moving out of its trough. A bonus for farmers is that the<br />
damaging drought of recent years has broken for most of Australia.<br />

One of the real strengths of the Australian rural economy<br />
is that the wool marketing operation is working extraordinarily<br />
well. It has put a floor in the industry and that floor<br />
has been steadily increased by the Government. The stabilisation<br />
scheme has given the industry real backbone and protection<br />
during difficult times.<br />
Overseas, great markets are opening up for our beef industry<br />
the industry that has probably been hardest hit in<br />
recent years. The renewed United States interest in our<br />
beef, for a variety of reasons, including a desire to keep<br />
domestic prices down, is a boon for cattlemen and the cattle<br />
industry generally.<br />
The additional 200 million Oounds weight that the United<br />
States wants imported before Christmas is a first step.<br />
I believe that quota will have to be increased, otherwise<br />
meat prices will rise again to unreasonable levels in the<br />
United States and add to inflation and inflationary expectations.<br />
At the same time, we are vigorously seeking increased access<br />
to the great markets of Japan, the European Community, the<br />
Middle East and other markets. Beyond that, we have been<br />
pressing for a more general liberalisation of international<br />
trade. Our attempt to gain increased access for agricultural goods<br />
has been recognised as fair and reasonable by other world<br />
leaders, and by the world press. President Carter has recently<br />
written to me about international trade negotiations and<br />
in his letter he said: " I will not consider these negotiations<br />
a success unless they lead us towards a significant<br />
liberalisation of world trade in agricultural products".<br />
The British Prime Minister, Mr. Callaghan, and the Foreign<br />
Minister, Dr. Owen, have also recognised the cost to the<br />
European consumer of the European Economic Community's<br />
total protection of agriculture.<br />
We do not intend to desist from trying to get a fair go for<br />
Australia in the world's largest and richest market. I am<br />
sure that no-one in the rural community or people in the<br />
cities want us to stop trying. Farmers know, better than<br />
most, that greater access for our agricultural goods would<br />
bring benefits to all Australians.<br />
All of these factors combined better prices, markets opening<br />
up, increased beef exports, a strong wool marketing scheme,<br />
and drought breaking mean a greatly improved farm outlook<br />
for Australia.<br />
It is estimated that average farm income will increase<br />
substantially this year, although from a low base, and this presents<br />
a better outlook for families in rural Australia than for almost<br />
a decade. </p>
<p>-3<br />
Farmers traditionally have shown they will spend their<br />
incomes on investment and property improvement. That has<br />
impact on confidence, impact on jobs, right across Australia.<br />
Of course, one of the key factors that will help the great<br />
rural industries, and all industry, is a continuing fall<br />
in interest rates. The level of interest rates is important<br />
to farming coaunities. Farmers require considerable cash sums<br />
to buy expens..: ve machinery, equipment, and for stock.<br />
Next week's Bud', et will show we are determined to keep on<br />
the path to lower inflation, because this is the way interest<br />
rates will keep coming down.<br />
The GovernmentL is mindful of the special cash flow problems of<br />
the farming community. That. is one reason the Government<br />
recently asked the Commonwealth Development Bank to give<br />
special attention to the financial needs of purchasers of<br />
rural machinery and equipment. Legislation already passed<br />
enables the Bank to finance the purchase of replacement as<br />
well as additional items of rural plant and equipment.<br />
The new Primary Industry Bank of Australia is close to<br />
opening and beginning operations. The Bank will aim to<br />
commence lending as soon as possible.<br />
I am most optimistic about the prospects for rural Australia.<br />
With inflation falling, interest rates coming down, prices<br />
improving and markets opening up, the signs are good.<br />
A strong rural community will benefit all Australians.<br />
City and country people need no reminding that, above all<br />
else, we are all Australians with great interests in common.<br />
