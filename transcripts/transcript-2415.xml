AUST RALIA -JAPAN BUSINESS GO-OPERATION COMM= TEE<br />
ACADEM/-Y OF SC IENCE, CA NERRA, A. C. T. 6 MAY 1971<br />
Spechbthe Prime Minister, Mr. William McMahon<br />
Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen,<br />
Now may I make some comments to you formally. And the first I would<br />
like to make, and I will put it in three different classifications, is the importance in<br />
aim trpaodritnagn csee nthsaet oJfa pJaanp acna nto pulas, y tahse ai mpoploitritcaanlc ein folfu eJanpcaen foinr at hwe orrilgdh ctso notfe xtht ea npde oapllseos tohfe'<br />
South East Asia. It is probably well known, but it bears repetition, that within the course of<br />
the next ten years, Japan will be, undoubtedly, the second greatest production nation<br />
in the world. And in order to be able to sustain its continued growth, it must have<br />
access to raw materials, semi-processed materials and, I believe, a large range of<br />
manufactured items as well.<br />
Thus it necessarily follows that Japan, in order to be able to sustain its<br />
production and its trade, must be able to obtain raw materials from various parts of<br />
the world. There can be no doubt that Japanese businessmen will be looking increasingly<br />
at Australia as the source of raw materials and processed materials.<br />
The second point is that as Japan's economic growth continues, and as it<br />
increases its trade in Asia, including South-East Asia and further South, it must be able<br />
increasingly * to play an important part in the development of the countries with which<br />
it trades. And so too should it be able to play a part in parallel with other countries<br />
in qnsuring that the less developed countries of South-East Asia have the opportunity<br />
for development. And the last assumptions on which I want to base my subsequent remarks<br />
are,: That as Japan develops its industrial strength and its trading strength as well,<br />
it will increasingly be able to play an important political role in the development of<br />
Asia, and particularly those parts of Asia closest to our shores.<br />
Consequently, we want to be able to join with the Japanese in order to ensure<br />
that Japanese political activity is directed towards ensuring the political freedom and<br />
the physical freedom of the countries of South East Asia. And that increasingly together<br />
we can make our contribution to helping the poorer people of this part of the world.<br />
Now while we as a Government can create an effective and real atmosphere<br />
or milieu in which development can take place, nonetheless, it is you as businessmen<br />
who can go out, seek the contacts with the political, and industrial and commercial<br />
people, and be able to achieve the kind of ideal I have just mentioned. That is increasing<br />
trade and with that increasing trade, increasing understanding and with that increasing<br />
understanding a higher responsibility for helping others in order to help themselves.<br />
Fortunately for us, trade between the two countries is complementary.<br />
They will be, as I have said be! ore, large importers of rawx materials and processed<br />
materials, and we will in our turn be able to import from them large quantities of<br />
highly sophisticated industrial eqa. ipnent. / 2 </p>
<p>Li-14.1.. </p>
<p>If we look at the trade between our two countries,, we can, on a preliminary<br />
estimate, get a false impression. Becaus. we have undoubtedly a big surplus in our<br />
balance of payments our balance of trade with Japan. In the latest figures that have<br />
been made available to me, we have, in recent years, increased our trade by about<br />
per cent to Japan, and they have increased their trade from us by about 60 per cent.<br />
So there is very nearly reciprocity at this present moment.<br />
The point I'd like to make, however, is that the Japanese authorities from<br />
the Prime Minister down, recognise that it is in their best interests and our best<br />
interests to have multilateral trade. And they realise that in a multilateral trade<br />
and finance world it is not essential that there should be a balance with every country.<br />
Japan accepts the fact that its balance of payments with us will be adverse,<br />
and probably this adverse balance will increase as the years go by. That does not<br />
mean that both of us don't want increased trade. Of course we do. As I said a few<br />
moments ago you can be absolutely certain that that trade will increase and increase<br />
at a rapid rate. As to the future, I think the first submission that I put up to the Cabinet<br />
or I should state in a preliminary way that I asked the Department of Foreign Affairs to<br />
prepare was the way in which we should look at the problems, the inter-relationships<br />
between Japan and Australia. As a consequence of that submission we have appointed<br />
a high-ranking group of civil servants at-F irst Secretary level or at Deputy Secretary<br />
level in order to be able to co-ordinate the relationships between the two countries.<br />
Equally, too, if I can interpolate this, although it is not exactly relevant<br />
but It has a bearing on what I am saying, we also in recent weeks prepared three<br />
papers for the Government on our relationships with China, particularly improved<br />
trading relationships with them.<br />
I have been able to announce in the House that we will considerably liberalise<br />
our trade with the People's Republic and that the Minister for Trade will shortly be<br />
releasing two lists one of goods that can be exported to the People's Republic, and<br />
one, the Strategic List in which there will be prohibitions imposed on trade.<br />
The substance of this is that businessmen will shortly know exactly the<br />
type of goods they can and the type of goods they cannot export.<br />
May I now refer shortly to three different subjects first capital<br />
movements, secondly, our problems relative to tariffs, and third, if I can mention<br />
It, guidelines for borrowing in this country by overseas interests.<br />
First, then, as to capital movements. I must again interject to say that<br />
in recent months the Japanese Government has indicated quite clearly that it will<br />
liberalise the quota restrictioces that are now imposed. And secondly I go on to say<br />
that as Japan has a very favourable balance of payments surplus, and one that is likely<br />
to grow, and is now in world terms in the financial market in a very strong position,<br />
we wifl welcome the fact that Japanese markets of this kind will be opened up to<br />
Australia. And we can hope for capital movements to increase between the two<br />
countries. In the last three years there has in fact been a movement of direct<br />
investment in Australia by Ja-anese interests of something like $ 43 million. </p>
<p>3.<br />
The second point I want to mention is borrowing capacity by Japanese interests<br />
or Japanese firms that have been established here. This depends on the amount of<br />
Australian equity as well as on the duration or the time during which the Japanese<br />
interests have carried on buiness here.<br />
We have two political objectives. We do want Australian equity participation<br />
when Japanese firms establish here and I know this is well known to the Japanese<br />
authorities, and 1 believe to Japanese business and commercial interests. And secondly<br />
we do like Australian talent, whether it happens to be on an administrative or a technicalI<br />
basis, to be able to participate with the Japanese in the development of Australian projects.<br />
I applaud the statement made by Mr. Miyazawa when he was here a few weeks<br />
ago that the Japanese look forward to co-operation between Japanese and Australian<br />
interests for the development of industry here. I hope we can extend that and extend our<br />
joint influence to the development of Australian/ Japanese interests in other parts of Asia.<br />
The third element is with our tariff policy, and whilst I would never like to<br />
feel I had become involved in controversy with the Minister in control of MITI, I thinkj<br />
I should say here that we have in fact only one kind of restriction on goods from Japan<br />
entering this country.<br />
Virtually we have an open-door policy to import and we do not, except on a<br />
very limited scale, impose quotas or non-tariff policies. But whatever we do, we do it<br />
after a thorcugh-going review by the officers of the Australian Tariff Board and after<br />
recommendations and reports by them to the Government. We do not act unilaterally.<br />
But all of this that I have just mentioned relating to the Tariff Board and<br />
capital movements will be submerged by the fact, and I repeat this again because it is<br />
so critically important there can be no doubt at all that trade from Australia to Japan<br />
and in the reverse direction will increase substantially in the years to come.<br />
We in Australia do want the most friendly international relations with the<br />
Japanese Government and people and the Australian Government and people. And from<br />
all I can gather and I have recently been to Japan as a guest of the Japanese Government<br />
for a period of something like ten to fourteen days, I think I can express the feeling that<br />
there is an increasing desire to be friendly. And not only friendly, but that we should get<br />
to know one another, that tourism should increase and that we should be able more and<br />
more to establish direct contact between the two peoples.<br />
And I finish on this note that while we as a government can do much in<br />
order to provide the infrastructure, the circumstances in which trade can increase,<br />
I do want to emphasise that the businessmen themselves can, and I believe will do the<br />
job. I know of the tremendous industry and the application of sound business principles<br />
particularly in finance and industry of the Japanese. Equally, too, do I know of the<br />
abilities of Australian businessmen as well. I am sure, and I express this view on behalf<br />
of the Government, that you will. make our task easier. But if you ever feel that we<br />
can do something to improve the relationships and to improve the trade between the<br />
two countries, I assure you that everyone in the Government will be only too happy<br />
to participate with you. </p>
