PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA WEDNESDAY JUNE 23 1982<br />
13TH SOUTH PACIFIC FORUM<br />
I shall be at~ tending the 13th South Pacific Forum Meeting<br />
to be held in Rotorua, New Zealand, on 9 and 10 August 1982.<br />
The'South Pacific is a region of primary importance to<br />
Australia. The Forum has since its inception in 1971 provided<br />
a unique opportunity for regular meetings of Heads of Government<br />
oil independent and self-governing South Pacific States, including<br />
Australia and New Zealand. The forum has been the instigator<br />
of, many positive measures of regional co-operation which have<br />
been developed in the South Pacific, and has been the chief<br />
means by which leaders have maintained regular contact with<br />
one another in an area where distance often imakes such contact<br />
difficult. I am looking forward to exchanging views with South Pacif ic<br />
leaders on regional and international political and economic<br />
developments of significance to member governments. I shall<br />
also have an. opportunity to have bilateral discussions with<br />
Heads of Government of neighbouring island states and New Zealand. </p>
