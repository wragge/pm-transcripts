TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP, ROYAL CANBERRA GOLF COURSE,<br />
CANBERRA, 23 N4OVEMBER 1990<br />
E OE PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister were you surprised, as the rest<br />
of us were, with Mrs Thatcher's decision?<br />
PM: No, I wasn't surprised. I was talking to my people<br />
yesterday and I thought that that was the most likely<br />
outcome. Either that or they would support her for this<br />
immediate election and seek her resignation a little bit<br />
later on. I think the events of the past week, particularly<br />
starting with the speech of Sir Geoffrey Howe, that fairly<br />
mortally wounded her.<br />
JOURNALIST: What will be the impact of her departure, do<br />
you think?<br />
PM: Well it will change the prospects of politics in<br />
Britain. All -the polling and one's intuition suggested that<br />
the conservatives had virtually no chance of winning with<br />
her. Equally -they seem to suggest that they have got a<br />
reasonable chance with a new leader. I would have thought<br />
that Neil Kinnock probably had his tongue reasonably<br />
substantially iLn his cheek when he said he thought it was<br />
good news.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do) you think it will make the Commonwealth a<br />
less abrasive organisation?<br />
PM: Well let's; be fair to Mrs Thatcher in some respects in<br />
regard to the Commonwealth. I mean when you talked about<br />
the Commonwealth and Mrs Thatcher it all was through the<br />
prism of South Africa and on that she certainly was a force<br />
for divisiveness that's true. But she was a very, very<br />
positive contributor to the good works of the Commonwealth<br />
in many other respects and it would be churlish not to<br />
acknowledge that.<br />
JOURNALIST: You've had the odd angry word with her. What<br />
conversation sticks in your memory?<br />
PM: I suppose generally the arguments about South Africa<br />
are the ones that stay in one's mind. But again to be fair<br />
to Mrs Thatcher and I think it is appropriate through<br />
their period in office and afterwards to be fair to peopleshe<br />
did take very constructive views about assistance to the<br />
South African siLtuation via the help that she thought ought<br />
to be given to the frontline states and so on. So my<br />
memories of Margaret Thatcher are mixed. Certainly the </p>
<p>incorrect position I think she had all the way through on<br />
South Africa I remember that. But I also remember the<br />
great courage of the woman. I mean, on South Africa she was<br />
always one out and she was never intimidated by the odds.<br />
She had the courage of her convictions and she would fight<br />
to see that they were put, even if we all thought that she<br />
was terribly wrong on them.<br />
JOURNALIST: She's left her own country though a much more<br />
divided society?<br />
PM: Yes she has. That's true. It's for her country really<br />
to make the judgement about her impact on that country. I<br />
would be hypocritical if I just, now that's she's finished,<br />
spoke simply in glowing terms of her because I think she was<br />
a force for backwardness on certain issues. But again in<br />
regard to the relations between Australia and Britain she<br />
must be given credit. I mean when she came out here in 88<br />
she was committed to strengthening the relationship. She<br />
went out of her way in 1989 when we were over there to<br />
marshall all t: he forces to ensure, not just that that was a<br />
successful visit but that all Ministers and Departments of<br />
the British Government were directed to ensuring into the<br />
future the best possible relations. So that's the picture<br />
of Margaret.<br />
JOURNALIST: Can you be enticed into a tip as to the<br />
replacement? PM: No. Speaking from afar I think that the one that I<br />
know best and for whom I have a very high regard is Geoffrey<br />
Howe. ends<br />
