    <content><![CDATA[<p>Â l AU,' iltAI A LPRIME<br />MINISTER<br />I'Ul Ml:: IDJA I Nov( mi1ll Tr 1i8n3<br />The Federal Government has agreed to transfer the title to Uluru<br />National Park to the traditional aboriginal owners.<br />Title to the park will be transferred from the Commonwealth<br />to an Aboriginal Land Trust established under the Aboriginal<br />Land Rights ( Northern Territory) Act.<br />The Government accepted the proposal put forward by the<br />aboriginal owners of the land that title would be transferred<br />to aboriginal ownership on the basis that the area would<br />continue to be used as a national park which would be available<br />for the use and enjoyment of all Australians and the many<br />thousands of visitors from overseas who travel to the park<br />every year.<br />This is an historic decision and is a measure of the willingness<br />of this Government on behalf of the Australian people, to<br />recognise the just and legitimate claims of a people who have<br />been dispossessed of their land but who have never lost their<br />spiritual attachment to that land.<br />In 1979 an aboriginal land claim over an area including Uluru<br />National. Park was heard by His Honour Mr. Justice Tooley,<br />the first Aboriginal Land Commissioner.<br />However, it was held at that time that the national park fell<br />outside the jurisdiction of the Commissioner because title to<br />the land had been vested in the Director of the Australian<br />National Parks and Wildlife Service.<br />But when Mr. Justice Toohey reported on 31 August 1979 he stated<br />that: " Both Ayers Rock and Mt. Olga are of enormous<br />significance not only for the local descent groups immediately<br />responsible for them but for the claimants generally and for a<br />wide range of aboriginal people". Th-; overnment has taken<br />, iccnunt of thc'se conIncnts. wheln taking it s doc: i ion.<br />The granting of aboriginal title and the leasing back to the<br />Commonwealth for the purposes of maintaining cnd operating a<br />national park has already been done in the top c: nd of the<br />Northern Territory in relation to the Kakadu National Park.</p>
<p>These lease arrangements with the Director, Australian National<br />Parks and Wildlife, have in no way adversely affected the<br />operation of that park and it is not expected that similar<br />lease arrangements in relation to Ulurn will in any way<br />adversely affect the operation of the national park at Ayers<br />Rock.

Uluru<br />National Park.<br />A management regime will be established to provide an<br />opportunity for Northern Territory participation.<br />Eiscussions will be held between the Minister for Home Affairs<br />and Environment and the Northern Territory Government and the<br />Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and relevant aboriginal bodies<br />with a view to outlining mutually acceptable management<br />arrangements under the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation<br />Act 1975.<br />Those talks are expected to start soon so that the new<br />arrangements can be put in place as soon as practicable.</p>
