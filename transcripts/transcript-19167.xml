    <content><![CDATA[<p>Canberra</p>
<p>PM: Thank you very much. I intend to make a short statement. I don't intend to take questions today. There is very much work to do.</p>
<p>I'm grateful to my colleagues for their continuing support of me as just demonstrated in our Labor Party meeting.</p>
<p>I accept their continuing support of me as Prime Minister and Labor Leader, with a sense of deep humility and a sense of resolve.</p>
<p>I never sought office for its own sake; I have only ever sought office in the interests of the nation, and to assist our nation to prepare to meet the challenges of the future.</p>
<p>It is in that spirit that I intend to continue to govern.</p>
<p>We've got a lot of work to do and we will continue to do it, making sure Australians have got the benefit of jobs and opportunity, making sure that in our nation we are getting ready for the future.</p>
<p>Rolling out the National Broadband Network, improving support for people with disabilities through our new scheme Disability Care, making sure too that we support modern families with the stresses and strains of everyday life and cost of living pressures.</p>
<p>And above all, ensuring that every Australian child gets a world-class education and a ticket to the future.</p>
<p>That is the purpose with which we govern, and that is how we intend to continue. That is what matters to Australians, and it is what matters to me.</p>
<p>Today the leadership of our political party, the Labor Party, has been settled and settled in the most conclusive fashion possible.</p>
<p>The whole business is completely at an end; it has ended now.</p>
<p>The Government has a plan for the nation's future. We've got plenty of work to be getting on with it, and we'll be getting on with it in a few minutes' time.</p>
<p>I'll turn now to the Deputy Prime Minister for some comments.</p>
<p>DPM: Thanks very much Prime Minister. I think it's pretty fair to say that there was very strong support in the party room for the Prime Minister today.</p>
<p>And that's because this Prime Minister is a tough leader, and a leader who is a great champion for our country and for the reforms that are required to create future prosperity. And also to spread opportunity around our country.</p>
<p>Now I think today's result does end these matters once and for all, and what we will do is rededicate ourselves to working every minute to put in place a program which will lift our country up and maximise all of the opportunities which will flow in our region and to this country in the years ahead.</p>
<p>For my part, I've got a Budget to prepare. I've been working on that very, very hard over the last few weeks and the Government will continue to do that.</p>
<p>But from our perspective, it's back to work.</p>
<p>Thanks very much.</p>
<p>PM: Thank you very much.</p>
