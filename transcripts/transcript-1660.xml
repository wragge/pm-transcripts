CHAMBER OF MANUFACTURES AND CHAMBER OF<br />
COMMl~ ERCE JOINT LUNCHEON, PERTH, W. A.<br />
13th SEPTEMBER, 1967<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, Mr. Harold Holt<br />
Mr. Hughes; Mr. Henderson; Mr. Premier; Ministerial<br />
and Parliamentary Colleagues of the Commonwealth and State<br />
2arliaments; Members of the Chambers of Commerce and of<br />
Manufactures; Distinguished Guests; Ladies and Gentlemen:<br />
I am glad to learn from you, Mr. ' Hughes, that such is<br />
the relative state of prosperity of the members of the two<br />
Chambers, that you have been inundated with requests to attend<br />
this function. That is a symptom of the buoyancy of this State<br />
and of the remarkable development which is occurring here and<br />
indeed occurring in abundant degrees through the Commonwealth<br />
as a whole and I want to say something to you, Sir, on the<br />
subject of growth today. But before doing so may I thank you<br />
for your welcome, the kind things you have said about my<br />
election to office. It is one thing to be greeted with a<br />
resounding win at your first election. It is a more satisfying<br />
thing to be able to repeat the performance,. and we hope that we<br />
will give you satisfaction in what we attempt over the period<br />
which lies ahead before we come to our accounting with you<br />
again. And I think we can claim that at least in the state of<br />
Australia-and in particular the condition of the state of<br />
' ivestern Australia we can point with some satisfaction to<br />
effective organisation of what are the principle elements of<br />
growth. Our human resources, our material resources, functioning<br />
in an atmosphere of stability, economic stability and political<br />
stability in a state of national security and with an environment,<br />
an economic climate which is encouraging to incentive to<br />
enterprise and to initiative. And if the results which you are<br />
manifesting in this state of W; estern Australia can be taken as<br />
reflecting the effectiveness of governments, Commonwealth and<br />
State, and their partners in these enterprises, those who<br />
hazard their skills and their fortunes, the entrepreneurs so<br />
strongly represented here today then, Sir, that partnership I<br />
believe has demonstrated its effectiveness and it is our goal<br />
to see that it continues effectively over the period ahead.<br />
I had the pleasure of making wvhat I understand is a<br />
little State and Australian history today by attending a meeting<br />
with the Premier and mem'bers of his Cabinet. I learned that<br />
this was the first time an Australian Prime Minister had performed<br />
this function and it only stressed to me the need for a closer<br />
relationship than perhaps we have had in the past, if we are to<br />
make the Federation function effectively and if we are to secure<br />
the degree of partnership with each other as Governments and<br />
with you who contribute so much to our resources, our revenues<br />
and to the advancement of the nation by your own efforts. I<br />
hope that at least our meeting here today where we have been<br />
able to go over some mutual items of interest is a symptom of<br />
the desire we have for that closer co-operation in the future.<br />
Sir, I mentioned that we had in a country of some<br />
3,000 square miles and with less than 12 million people that we<br />
had no, I am sorry it is 3 million square miles that is a<br />
pretty big percentage of error, I thought there was a catch to<br />
it still there are less than 12 million of people and so my<br />
point stands in that direction. qVe have, if wie take a comparisonand<br />
I do not employ this critically of the countries concerned<br />
but as a mark of what we have ourselves achieved the gross<br />
national product of this country of less than 12 million people,<br />
and compare it with some of our neighbours, we find that India </p>
<p>with a population 42 times our size generates in money value<br />
just on double our gross national product. Pakistan and<br />
Indonesia with populations 9 times our size that can point to<br />
only one half the value of gross national product and so we<br />
have been at least making advances ourselves in the way in which<br />
we have managed our affairs inside this country. And we are<br />
looking to greater things ahead for us, and in order to achieve<br />
these greater things we have to build up our resources, our<br />
human resources, which we are trying to do through an active<br />
programme of immigration and the material resources largely<br />
generated inside our own country. Eighty-five to 90% of our<br />
fixed capital investment in Australia is generated from our<br />
own resources but it is the remaining 10 to 15'/ which has been<br />
so helpful in stimulating growth over these recent years. We<br />
must do what we can to encourage that at the same time taking<br />
such action as we can to make it possible for our fellow<br />
Australians to participate appropriately in the development of<br />
the resources of this country.<br />
Thanks to this programme of population building we<br />
have added 50% to our population over the last 20 years. Canada<br />
is probably the only country that can point to a similar volume<br />
of growth although I do not overlook the quite phenomenal<br />
performance in a smaller population which Israel has carried<br />
out but comparably Australia and Canada would rank outstandingly<br />
amongst the industrialised countries of the world in the degree<br />
of population growth they have attained through immigration.<br />
And what th'is has meant to us is that whereas without<br />
immigration we would have had about one-third of our population<br />
under the age of 20, we have been able to lower the median age<br />
of the population with all that that means in terms of work<br />
force effort, the addition to the consumer requirements of the<br />
community and the other advantages that a smaller average age<br />
of the community brings to us. This has, as a result of<br />
immigration, moved now from less than one-third under 20 to<br />
something of the order of 407o under 20. If we had not had this<br />
programme there would have been a drop in the number of people<br />
in the 20 to 34 age group of about 132,000. Thanks to it we<br />
have an increase more than double that dimension rather than a<br />
fall of that size. 9hen we look to the skills which have been<br />
brought to us as a consequence of this process, 42% 14 of those,<br />
the males, coming to settle with us are skilled, against about<br />
one in three of our own proportion of the work force. And so<br />
the reliance we have come to place and I stress it to<br />
members of two Chambers which have given us strong support in<br />
this programme, I stress it to emphasise its importance for our<br />
growth as a nation is that whereas even as recently as 1961,<br />
immigration contributed 29% of our population growth, last year<br />
it actually contributed because of our own declining birthrate<br />
for a variety of social factors, it contributed 4%%<br />
Now looking at this from another aspect, if it costs<br />
about 5,000 to rear a child to productive age, then each<br />
migrant who comes to us represents a considerable financial<br />
asset. But as my friend, the Premier, realises only too well,<br />
while you have that advantage of a saving in the cost of<br />
bringing a child up to working capacity, you have the claims<br />
on the community in the social and capital facilities of the<br />
community which bear very heavily on governments and require<br />
about 3 to 4% for migrants alone of our gross national product.<br />
But with all this we have managed to succeed over the past five<br />
years in maintaining a growth rate in Australia of an average<br />
of 5-and this is only exceededso far as we can ascertain, by<br />
one industrialised country, Japan and that high average growth<br />
rate has been achieved despite a year of very serious drought<br />
just a few years ago, serious, ccrtdinly, in relation to<br />
Queensland and New South viales. doe are doing much to help </p>
<p>ourselves although we have turned to foreign investment to a<br />
degree as I mentioned earlier but no country with the exception<br />
of Japan ploughs more of its national income back into investment<br />
than Australia roughly 27% of our gross national product<br />
compared with 16 to 17% in the United Kingdom and in the United<br />
States. Now all this has been a background to what have been<br />
the quite spectacular and remarkable developments of recent<br />
years, notably in the mineral field and no State has shown up<br />
more spectacularly in this connection than has your State of<br />
Western Australia. I am informed that the value of output from<br />
our mining industries currently is of' the order of $ 900M. and<br />
this should reach about " W1,700M. by 1975. Mr. Court would be<br />
more familiar with these figures that I now mention than I am,<br />
but my colleague, the Minister for National Development who is<br />
with us, will have advised me that we have in sight iron ore<br />
contracts, I think for this State alone, of an order of $ 39000M.<br />
over the next 20 years. Somie 50 new mineral projects involving<br />
a capital of 42,400M. are currently in progress in Australia,<br />
and of course prospecting is going on actively for a great many<br />
more. Now having mentioned something of what is occurring<br />
inside the country, those of you who are here as representatives<br />
of commerce will be well aware of the notable increase which is<br />
occurring in our trade with Asia. In the early ' 50' s 15% of our<br />
exports went East of Suez. Now more than 30% of our exports are<br />
going East of Suez and with the percentage tending to rise.<br />
Japan has, of course, become our largest customer, outstripping<br />
the United Kingdom, and again, the trade there is on a rising<br />
curve. As I went recently through some of the countries of Asia<br />
I was struck with the potentialities which exist for the trade<br />
of this country in the future, particularly in places such as<br />
Taiwan and Korea. In both of those, Mr. Premier, they were<br />
talking to me of the steel industries that they were setting up<br />
there with a consortium already established in each of the two<br />
countries and both said that they would be looking to Australia<br />
for the iron ore they would be needing for that industry. And<br />
this is just typical of the sort of growth which lies ahead for<br />
us. Now if I may move from that broad economic picture to<br />
a topic which may at first seem a little remote but does bear<br />
quite intimately on our future prospects, the kind of stability,<br />
security, the economic climate to which I referred in general<br />
terms a little earlier, and that is the issue which has faced<br />
us in Vietnam. I stress this because in recent times there has<br />
been perhaps a disposition either to allow to recede into the<br />
background the vital considerations which moved us to accept an<br />
involvement in Vietnam and which at the ti; ne persuaded us that<br />
not only was security involved but the kind of future of the<br />
area in which we live that we want to see developed.<br />
Now, of course, there are various important reasons<br />
why we took the decision to participate. We have fought in two<br />
world wars very far from Australian shores to support those who<br />
were trying to resist aggression, small countries, themselves<br />
under attack by larger powers and in this instance, of course,<br />
the geographical factor is a very much more proximate one than<br />
was the case in thnose two world wars. Darwin is closer to Saigon<br />
than Perth is to Brisbane and so there is a security factor<br />
involved there which was not apparent to us even in the same<br />
degree in the two world wars. But in principle we were resisting<br />
much the same thing a small nation under aggression from<br />
others and we joined in the task of resisting it.<br />
Secondly, of course, we ourselves being a small nation,<br />
if we regard others as expendable and not worthy of support when<br />
they come under attack can have no real assurance that we, should </p>
<p>4.<br />
that situation ever arise, be ourselves able to rely on others<br />
to come to our aid. In this connection, the realities of' our<br />
present circumstances are that the most important pillar of<br />
security for the Australian nation is the alliance we have with<br />
the United States of' America and we are joined in the ANZLJS<br />
Treaty, and for our part we have seen in the American action,<br />
first in resisting aggression in Korea, secondly in coming to<br />
the aid of South Vietnam, the same sort of principle of aid to<br />
a weaker country that is wrapped up in the American obligation<br />
in ANZUS there set out in more precise terms and perhaps more<br />
reliably stated, but nonetheless the willingness of the United<br />
States to join in resisting aggression there has been a matter<br />
which we have had to properly take into account in our own<br />
decision in relation to our participation in Vietnam.<br />
And I mentioned the bearing it has on the kind of<br />
world in which we wish to live, to trade, to co-operate and to<br />
join in the activities of the region and what is far too often<br />
overlooked, is the benefit that we have received and the countries<br />
of the area have received. While we are conscious of all the<br />
problems and agonies that are going on in Vietnam itself, there<br />
is far less disposition on the part of the critics to look at<br />
what has been achieved on the positive side in such countries<br />
as Korea, and Taiwan, around the whole periphery of Asia in<br />
Thailand, the Philippines, in South Vietnam itself' with some<br />
prospect that this thing can be sorted out, of a secure and<br />
prospering life in the future, and Australia and New Zealand<br />
themselves made the more secure because of' the guarantees we<br />
have against aggression if' that were ever to be directed against<br />
us. So there have been these benefits immediately discernible,<br />
currently discernible as a result of the resistance to aggression<br />
in this area. Now, I lead from that to the query which I know arises<br />
in the minds of many people, " Well why if' you feel this way<br />
about Vietnam do you continue to trade with China?" And,<br />
properly understood, there is no inconsistency in these two<br />
courses of action.<br />
We demonstrated in the case of Indonesia, when the<br />
confrontation policy was in force there, that it was possible<br />
on the one hand to resist the processes of confrontation but at<br />
the same time maintain a channel which enabled a relationship<br />
of friendship and of mutual interest to build up when circumstances<br />
made this propitious. And we all know that there must come a<br />
time when the free world will, with China, have to find an<br />
accommodation, a process of' peaceful co-existence.<br />
' te are not at war with China. We are engaging in<br />
international trade on items which can be procured by that<br />
country from a vaiiety of' countries. The products we sell,<br />
wheat, wool, even steel, are readily procurable by China from<br />
other parts of' the world. The steel sales, about which so much<br />
of' public criticism was directed against us, represent less than<br />
one-third of' 1% of' the steel availability from sources which<br />
China has either internally or which it produces from overseas.<br />
So, what we sell is itself marginal. Our total trade with China<br />
represents less than 2% of the imports of that country from<br />
other parts of' the world. And so they can dispense with their<br />
trade with us far more with far less inconvenience and damage<br />
to their economy than Australia can. Vie can put to better and<br />
more effective use nationally what we secure from our trade than<br />
the effect would be if it were to be cut off by China altogether,<br />
and the bearing it would have on their trade.<br />
But on the other hand just as trade does build up some<br />
mutuality of' interest, some prospect of a capacity to live more<br />
securely and in greater friendship with a country so we find that </p>
<p>this trade that China has with the free world has more than<br />
doubled over the past five yeara. It has moved from 35-/ 0 of<br />
total imports to 70% of total imports and that, one would<br />
imagine, would in the long run have a bearing upon the policies<br />
which finally emerge from China in relation to the rest of the<br />
free world. Now, Sir, I know that you like to keep to a fairly<br />
tight schedule in functions such as this, so could I just by<br />
way of conclusion offer a few broad predictions as I, Head of<br />
Australian Government, see the future course unfolding over the<br />
years ahead. Surely if we can maintain a situation of peace<br />
and peace is relative these days, we regard ourselves as being<br />
at peace in one sense even when we have military forces engaged<br />
as they are in Vietnam but the effect on the national economy<br />
as a whole is still that of a peacetime economy, and providing<br />
that a situation of' peace can be continued, Australia must be<br />
able to look to an assured future and a continuance of effective<br />
pcrtnership in a free enterprise system with Governments<br />
co-operating in our Federation.<br />
We can foresee a nation of 15 million people in 10 to<br />
12 years' time with a growth rate and a productivity level<br />
ranking among the best of the developed nations of the Western<br />
world. As a nation with a diversification of our industry we<br />
should be able to carry on without putting too many eggs into<br />
one basket a nation with a much broader economic base a<br />
greater variety of exports and more diversified markets. We<br />
can look, with the application of methods of science and increased<br />
fertiliser production, to spectacular rural development with<br />
very large additional acreages responding to this scientific<br />
knowledge and the application of scientific methods. We have<br />
already witnessed a spectacular development of our mineral<br />
industries with new communities, new factories arising around<br />
them, and no-one imagines that we are at the end of discoveries<br />
in this direction. We have a broader energy base for power<br />
developing in the continent. This will flow from our recent<br />
discoveries of oil and natural gas and the possibility of nuclear<br />
power for peaceful purposes on an economic basis. We see our<br />
own country as a continent of stability in Asia demonstrating<br />
to the emerging nations there the happiness and practical virtues<br />
to be found by a free people in a parliamentary democracy<br />
stimulated by incentives matching their energies and enterprise.<br />
WVe find a new intimacy developing with Japan, with Indonesia,<br />
and the other free nations of Asia and a still closer relationship<br />
likely to develop with New Zealand as we share some common<br />
tasks in the area.<br />
So we find in all these directions growth at work not<br />
as something that can be guaranteed by edict but growth which<br />
responds to the efforts of governments and peoples co-operating<br />
freely together. And in that process I pay a tribute to the<br />
Government of this State which itself has given so much by way<br />
of leadership and effort to the prosperous growth of the State.<br />
I hope I can be pardoned for including my able colleagues from<br />
destern Australia, of my own MVinistry and of my own Parliament,<br />
Senators and M~ embers from this State. They are of a high calibre<br />
and I am indebted to them for all the assistance they bring to<br />
the processes of Government.<br />
Finally, it is through the work of responsible bodies<br />
like your two Chambers that the partnership which the Premier and<br />
I, and the Mlembers of our Governments so fervently desire, can be<br />
given the most valuable practical expression by having responsible<br />
voices with responsible membership conferring with us and able<br />
to work out with us the policies which serve the national interest<br />
best. It is in that spirit that I look confidently to a continuation<br />
of the progress which in Western Australia and in Queensland, </p>
<p>6.<br />
another great State of tremendous potential now stirring perhaps<br />
for the first time in its long history into great activity. It<br />
is through developments such as these that we look confidently<br />
to the greater Australia of the future and to see ahead a<br />
stronger, more prosperous and happier nation to which we can<br />
all usefully contribute. </p>
