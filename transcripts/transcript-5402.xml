FOR MEDIA TUESDAY, 22 Jq i<br />
ADDRESS TO THE FIRST STATE CONFERENCE i, j] cu-A t '! l<br />
SOF THE Li:. A V I<br />
UNITED FARMiERS AND STOCKOWNERS' ASSOCIATION<br />
OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA<br />
I welcome the opportunity to be with you for this your<br />
inaugural conference as the United Farmers and Stockowners'<br />
of South Australia.<br />
The formation of this organisation is recognition of the fact<br />
that, although rural producers are involved with different<br />
commodities they have over-riding common interests; and these<br />
interests are best served when the industry speaks as one voice.<br />
I can assure you that the Commonwealth Government looks forward<br />
to working closely with you in the future; and I am equally<br />
confident that you will be able to respond successfully to the<br />
rural challenges of the new decade.<br />
We meet at a time when Australia's rural industries have won<br />
significant achievements; and confidence in Australia's future<br />
has reached its highest level for many years. This confidence<br />
is soundly based. Australia's greatly inproved export performance<br />
to which rural industries have contributed significantly, has<br />
played a prominent part in our recovery.<br />
In the last financial year total exports rose by nearly 33%<br />
and rural exports rose by 41%. For 1980/ 81, the BAE forecasts<br />
rural exports to increase by another 6% to a record of more than<br />
$ 9 billion. What is pleasing to the Government is that Australia<br />
has been able to maintain and improve its level of economic<br />
activity at the same time as a significant downturn is taking<br />
place in a number of major world economies.<br />
Australia's vast possibilities, in the decade ahead, have been<br />
widely canvassed by international authorities and policies<br />
of the kind being pursued by the Australian Government are now<br />
advocated by most Western governments. The OECD has recently<br />
drawn attention to the fact that Australia's grQwth prospects<br />
are very much better than those anticipated for the OECD area<br />
as a whole; and much better than prospects for the U. S. A. and the<br />
U. K. A number of important surveys conducted in Australia<br />
bear out thu OECD's optimistic view. S./ 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
The May survey of investment projects by the Department of<br />
Industry and Commerce shows $ 29 billion of projects committed<br />
or in the final feasibility stage. And these prospects-are<br />
supported by the Australian Bureau of. Statistics' Survey,<br />
taken during April and May, which shows that expec ' ted investment<br />
for the year ahead is 40% higher than expectations which existed<br />
at this time last year. So that, in spite of the difficulties<br />
that are being experienced overseas, there are very soun~. and<br />
well based reasons for having confidence in our future.<br />
Our natural resources, our energy endowment and our<br />
geographical position give us the potential to reduce the<br />
iitpact on ' Asrai' development of the conditions in the<br />
world economy. For examPle, as a result of the d{ Lversification<br />
of our markets, some 47% of our exports now go to Asian anid<br />
Middle East countries which, in general, are likely t~ o do<br />
relatively well in sustaining their growth rates in the years<br />
ahead. Foodstuffs which remain a most important export from<br />
Australia, appear to be in good demand..<br />
our success in achieving efficient and lower cost industries,<br />
is helping us to meet the difficult international econom~ c<br />
conditions. Central to these international difficulties has<br />
been the dramatic rise in the price of oil by 125% since the<br />
end of 1978; and increased international tension has increased<br />
the uncertainty about the reliability of oil supplies in the<br />
longer term.<br />
I know that the price of the long term supply of fuel are vital<br />
issues for all rural producers. Both these matters occupied<br />
the attention of the recent economic summit meeting in Venice.<br />
The leaders of the seven major industrialised countries<br />
pronounced that the link between economic growth and oil<br />
consumption must be broken this decade. And they stressed<br />
that this must be done through maximum reliance on the pricing<br />
mechanism, supplemented, where necessary, by other measures.<br />
The summit confirmed that the Australian Government's import<br />
parity pricing policy is the right policy. That only by allowing<br />
prices to bring supply and demand together can we hope to encourage<br />
exploration and development of new energy resources; to moderate<br />
the growth in demand for oil; and to facilitate the shift to<br />
alternatives to oil-fired energy.<br />
On all these fronts, as a result of our gil parity pricing<br />
policy, the Government-has secured significant success. In<br />
oil exploration and development,<br />
expenditure levels are five times what they were in 1975<br />
during this year 50-60 on-shore wells are likely to be<br />
drilled compared with six in 1975<br />
in the last four years one billion barrels of petrcoleum<br />
liquids have been added to Australia's economically<br />
recoverable reserves<br />
$ 4-5,000 million of investment is about to proceed on the<br />
North West Shelf, and<br />
ESSO BHP have already announced programmes of $ 1.2 billion<br />
for the next four years. ./ 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
In conservation, Australian vehicle manufacturers recently announced new<br />
targets for fuel efficiency and economy, based on voluntary<br />
standards sugqested by the Government<br />
This will result, on current usage, in a saving of motor<br />
spirit in 1983 and 12% in 1987, and<br />
pe-trol con~ sumption for May 1980 was 9.800 below that<br />
for May 1979.<br />
In promoting t he use of alternatives to oil,<br />
the Government's pricing and taxation measures are encouraginvg<br />
motor vehicle conversion -to LPG, expecially in vehicle fleets.<br />
It is anticipated that between 10-15% of motor spiri~ t usage<br />
could ultimately be replaced by LPG.<br />
In 1979, two million barrels of fuel oil were saved in the<br />
Sydney market alone by industrial conversions from oil to<br />
natural gas.<br />
And the extension of natural gas pipelines will result<br />
in further savings.<br />
The Sydney-Newcastle pipeline due to be completed<br />
later this year will save the equivalent of about<br />
3 million barrels of oil a year.<br />
Without parity pricing, the increasing interest being shown<br />
in producing oil from coal and shale-would not exist. Planning<br />
of the Rundle project, for example, provides that, by about<br />
1990, it would be producing approximately 200,000 barrels per day;<br />
equal to about one-quarter of Australia's crude oil de-ma:-ids at<br />
that time.<br />
of course, in the short term, oil parity pricing poses difficulties.<br />
Farmers in particular have voiced concern at the price increases.<br />
This is understandable. Nobody likes increased prices for petrol.<br />
But in the current world energy situation, it is the height of<br />
irresponsibility to talk about cheaper petrol. Cheaper petrol<br />
would give us an unlimited right to use up our scarce fuel<br />
reserves. Cheaper petrol means that exploration and development<br />
would cease; that the development of shale oil deposits, such<br />
as Rundle, would not take place.<br />
With cheaper petrol, industry would be encouraged to postpone<br />
new techlnoloqies. Cheaper petrol would make Australia, in thne<br />
years ahead, a defenceless victim of OPEC countriesbeggars<br />
for fuel with prices much higher than we now have to pay.<br />
We would lose our independence and with it our chance of oil<br />
self-sufficiency. Such a policy of cheaper petrol would be a<br />
selfish policy; a policy for today; a policy which ignores the<br />
needs of our children. It would be asking our children to make<br />
adjustments in the future, more extreme and much more difficult<br />
than are being asked of us today. We owe our children something<br />
better than that. / 4 </p>
<p>4<br />
On our-farms and properties we put a lot of money and effort<br />
into development and improvements; not necessarily because theywill<br />
add directly to farm income, but, partly, because these<br />
improvements will make our farms and properties better for our<br />
children when they take over. This is part of the motivating force<br />
of everything we do.<br />
But shouldn't we do the same for Australia and make decisions<br />
that will leave it a better place than otherwise it mig-ht have<br />
been? That is, in effect, -the reason for our oil parity priuinig<br />
nolicy. The Governmrett has orjv ta. ken the decision it has because we know<br />
it is not on. y-right', but also necessary. And even with<br />
par ity pricing, our petrol prices of around 32-33 per litre<br />
in capial cities, still compare more than favourably with<br />
New Zealand 45 per litre; West Germany 57c per litre, Britain<br />
62 per litre, Japan 67 the Netherlands 67 France 73' and<br />
Italy 77 per litre.<br />
Of course, I recognise that rural communities are paying more than<br />
city areas. Because of this, we introduced a fuel policy for<br />
country areas whereby the difference between city and country<br />
petrol prices, on account of freight, would be kept to less than<br />
half a cent a litre. Yet some people wonder why the price in<br />
inland areas is still higher than it is in capital cities.<br />
There is a simple reason for that. The retail mark up in the<br />
capital cities, because of present discounting and intensive<br />
competition, has been driven to as low as one cent. In rEgional<br />
areas, where these forces do not exist, the mark up is commonly<br />
6-8 cents per litre; occasionally it is even higher than that.<br />
our energy policy is a key par t of the Government's overall<br />
economic strategy. Another part of that strategy, of equal<br />
importance, is the reduction of inflation. To achieve this,<br />
the Government must continue to pursue restraint in publiLc<br />
expenditure; reduction of the budget deficit., resistance<br />
to excessive wage increases; and support for the co-ordinated<br />
development of Australia' s resources.<br />
our dedication to international competitiveness has been a key<br />
factor in securing new markets in the face of tough competition<br />
from other exporters. To retain our old markets, and to improve<br />
our access -to them., the Government has negotiated, and is<br />
continuing to negotiate, on behalf of our rural industries.<br />
Through the recently concluded MTN negotiations Australia<br />
secured improved access for beef and dairy products to the<br />
European and U. S. markets; and won new commitments on beef<br />
from the Japanase. Australia secured a quiaran-teed minimu~ m<br />
access level for globalbeef imports of 1.2 billion pounds per annum<br />
in the vital United States market. This is the first timie suc~ h<br />
a guarantee has been given by the United States government.<br />
This commitment will be of particular importance whenever<br />
U. S. beef production is high and the recently enacted U. S. A.<br />
counter-cyclical legislation operates to reduce imports.<br />
Australian beef exporters are now better able to plan for the<br />
future on the basis of a firm and predictable minimium import<br />
level. </p>
<p>We were also successful in securing a useful reduction in U. S.<br />
beef import duty from 31 a pound to U. S. 2 a pound which is<br />
expected to yield an extra $ 6 million to $ 7 million per annum<br />
to Australia's beef producers.<br />
After strong pressure from Australia, the United States<br />
also-agreed to reduce the duty on raw wool by 60% over a<br />
three year period.*<br />
As a result of tl-e negotiations with Japan, Japanese bee"<br />
imports are increasing steadily and it is our expectat ion<br />
that they will reach at least 142,000 tonnes in 1983.<br />
Sincea Japan ais our second largest market for beef, after<br />
Li-e United States, these new comimitments provide a more,<br />
secure basis for our : 3::-ports.<br />
Our success in the Japanese market is in stark contrast to<br />
the performance of the Labor government which sat back<br />
passively while the Japanese market was closed to Australian.<br />
beef producers in 1974 and 1975.<br />
We also negotiated some useful increases in access for<br />
manufacturing beef and high quality beef imports into the:<br />
European Economic Community.<br />
We have had some initial difficulty in getting the<br />
E. E. C. to fully implement these new concessions and we have<br />
made strong representations on the issue.<br />
I am hopeful that the Community will live up to its commitments<br />
on beef and that our trade will increase. </p>
<p>6<br />
Unfortunately, the E. E. C. continues to cause difficulties<br />
for Australia on a range of other agricultural commodities.<br />
There is no economic justification for this provocative action.<br />
In order to meet the demands of French sheepmeat producers,<br />
a new scheme has been proposed involving the support of<br />
prices paid to local producers;. levies on imports; and<br />
export subsidies for European exporters to third markets.<br />
This new regime is estimated to cost the E. E. C. about<br />
$ 275 million in its first year of operation.<br />
In effect, Community consumers and taxpayers are being<br />
asked to subsidise Community producers $ 500 for every tor. ne<br />
of shegpmeat produced. This figure a isi nCa1db4. oiuate half theeX tecturrent<br />
world market price ' or sheepmeat and cates the entent to<br />
which the proposed subsidy would insulate E. E. C. producers<br />
from normal market forces.<br />
As a significant exporter of sheepmeat to Europe and as<br />
the world's largest exporter of sheepmeat and live sheep to<br />
markets outside Europe, Australia is vitally concerned at:<br />
these developments.<br />
E. E. C. Commissioner Gundelach visited Australia last week and<br />
had discussions with Doug Anthony and Peter Nixon. They both<br />
made him aware of our grave concern.<br />
We intend to press our case strongly; and stress that<br />
the E. E. C. benefits greatly from its access to the Australian<br />
market. Indeed, now, two senior officials are in Brussels and,<br />
depending on progress with negotiations, Mr. Anthony could be<br />
going to Brussels in September.<br />
Our hard won concessions in our more established markets are<br />
significant, but they should not obscure the importance of<br />
selling more to the Middle East and Asian markets, where<br />
living standards are increasing rapidly. One of the most<br />
encouraging aspects of the rural recovery has been our success<br />
in these markets.<br />
Meat exports to the Middle East, including live sheep, have<br />
sh;.-m strong growth; while the Wheat Board Chairman,<br />
Sir Leslie Price, recently commented that the Middle East is our<br />
most rapid-y expanding wheat market, likely to take nearly.<br />
of Australian wheat exports in 1980.<br />
The Asian market has also become much more important for our<br />
rural export industries, with rising sales in grain, wool, meat,.<br />
cotton and dairy products.<br />
The current competitive position of the Australian exporters;<br />
the underlying increase in world food demand; the vigorous and<br />
successful attempts by exporters and the Government to. expand<br />
our markets; all these have established the foundation for<br />
continuing growth of our rural industries. / 7 </p>
<p>-7-<br />
It is a tribute to the resilience of the Australian farmer,<br />
and his capacity to respond to improved circumstances, that<br />
the recovery from rural depression of the mid 70s has been so<br />
commanding between 1976-77 and 1979-80.<br />
In this time: the value of rural production rose by 69% e;<br />
the value of rural exports rose by 65%; and real-income<br />
per farm almost doubled.<br />
Forecasts released today indicate that the value of rural<br />
production in 1980-81 is expected to increase by a further<br />
to reach a record ofL" more than $ 12 billion.-<br />
Al1though real income is expected to moderate in 1980-81, the<br />
Bureau points out that the three years ended 1980-81 are expected<br />
to , e th~ e best three consecutive years for the rural sector<br />
since the Ko-rean War boom of the early<br />
All major rural industries are sharing in these achievements.<br />
The beef industry has come out of the years of bitter depression<br />
and market prospects are favourable. Wool has bounced back as<br />
a competitive industrial fibre that, for the first time in quite<br />
a long while, has increased its textile market share. Cotton<br />
production nearly trebled in the past four years and expansion is<br />
continuing. Rice production is increasing, and the sugar industry<br />
is considering a significant acreage increase in response: to<br />
better market prospects. For the wheat industry, the decade<br />
ahead is one of real promise.<br />
Two landmarks reached in 1979-80 were the emergence of<br />
Australia as the world's second largest wheat exporter; and<br />
wheat becoming Australia's largest export industry in value terms.<br />
I understand that at this stage, South Australia is looking to<br />
another good crop this year.<br />
Our stature as a world exporter has meant that the UnitEd States<br />
has looked to us, as an ally, for support in their grain<br />
sanctions against the USSR. Australia will maintain its firm<br />
support for the United States in its attitude to the invasion<br />
of Afghanistan by the Soviet Union. Part of our response, in<br />
concert with the has been to restrict grain sales t~ o the<br />
Soviet Union, to make sure that we do not make up any of the<br />
shortfall created by the U. S. withholding supplies.<br />
In this financial year the Unitecl States is only allowing sales<br />
to take place up to the level of 8 million tonnes provided for<br />
in its bilateral agreement with the SoviLet Union.<br />
Australia-is supporting that action by restricting its grain<br />
sales to the Soviets in this financial year to a maximum total<br />
for all grains of 3.9 million tonnes which-is about the ' Level<br />
of last year's sales.<br />
The improvement in returns to Australia's wheat farmers, and<br />
other rural producers, owes much to the harmonious partnership<br />
over the past five years between industry and Government which<br />
provides a solid underpinning for future development. / 8 </p>
<p>-8-<br />
It is only when the range of new measures is looked at<br />
in full that the extent of the improvements in rural policy<br />
measures can be appreciated.<br />
Farmers now have access to long term credit through the<br />
Primary Industry Bank which, in response to heavy demand, has<br />
already approved $-230 million to 3,200 borrowers.<br />
Farmers now have the ability to even out tax payments th-rough<br />
the income equalisation deposit scheme.<br />
The fuel freight subsidy scheme will benefit people in country<br />
areas by over $ 120 million in* 1980-SI.<br />
We have provided special dep re, 4a t -Lon p) rovisions frbui7. din-s<br />
for the scorage of hay, grain at~ d fodder; and recently in~ ounced<br />
the introduction of mjrnew taxation concessionrs to assist<br />
with increased water storage; whether by helping farmers to<br />
increase their capacity to withstand drought or in developing<br />
their own irrigation schemes.<br />
For the key industries, we have provided the support they need<br />
to plan confidently for the future. The wool floor price has<br />
been increased progressively from 250 cents in 1975-76 to the new<br />
level of 365 cents per kilo. The wool market support fund has<br />
been placed on a permanent basis with provision that growers'<br />
earlier contributions will be returned when the fund balance<br />
exceeds predetermined maximum level. We provided assistance<br />
for beef producers when prices were low and have gained Secure<br />
access and new markets for meat. The Government has int-roduced<br />
a new wheat marketing scheme to underwrite wheat returns and<br />
facilitate earlier payments for wheat deliveries. We have stood<br />
by the troubled dairy industry while it went through an<br />
adjustment period and were able to recently announce a 20% lift<br />
in the 1980-81 underwriting level.<br />
And of benefit to all farmers, Federal death duties have been<br />
abolished, and a comprehensive rural adjustment scheme introduced.<br />
One area of real concern in recent times is the unjustified<br />
disruption of Australia's $ 180 million live sheep trade which<br />
has dra. rn cries of protest from misdirected -union militants.<br />
The live sheep export trade to the Middle East is one of<br />
particular inuercst to South Australians.<br />
Tn 1979, over two million live sheep, valued at almost $-60 imillion;<br />
were exported-from South Australia alone. The trade has grown<br />
progressively over the last ten years and since 1970-71, we have<br />
exported over 24 million live sheep, mainly older wethors.<br />
The Middle East countries which take these sheep do so mainly<br />
becausa the:-y have a long established traditional preferencce<br />
for fresh killed meat. They are importing steadily increasing<br />
quantities of frozen lamb but they are not prepared to purchase<br />
these older sheep in frozen carcass form.. It is obvious that<br />
there is little likelihood that banning the trade would lead to<br />
increased slaughtering or increased job opportunities in<br />
Australian meat works. </p>
<p>-9-<br />
In fact, a study conducted by the Director of the Bureau of<br />
Agricultural Economics in 1978 found that, far from jobs<br />
being lost in abattoirs through this trade, significant<br />
other jobs were actually created by it. The Bureau has now<br />
done further research which shows that these conclusions<br />
are still valid.<br />
While the live sheep trade has increased, our exports to<br />
the Middle East of frozen meat, especially in the form of lamb<br />
and hogget, continue to rise.<br />
To assist this trade, the Conmmonwealth Governmen-has recently<br />
made decisions which will more then treble Australia's air-freighted chilled<br />
meat tonnage to the Middle East. Ralph Hunt will shortly be<br />
announcing these decisions in detail.<br />
They will mean additional benefits to the meat industry in<br />
Australia of at least $ 4 million; and these gains for producers<br />
will of course mean more jobs for meatworkers in the abattoirs.<br />
( A benefit that I hope the A. M. I. E. U. will appreciate).<br />
Regrettably, these significant benefits can be jeopardised<br />
by sections of the union movement bent on achieving massive<br />
wage increases and shorter working hours. The recent national<br />
wage judgement granting a 4.2% increase to wage earners will<br />
significantly add to cost pressures.<br />
And on top of this is the selfish and unrealistic campaign by<br />
metal workers for a 35 hour week which would increase costs and<br />
prices; reduce sales; sacrifice our competitiveness; and<br />
increase unemployment throughout Australia.<br />
These developments represent not just a challenge to industry<br />
viability and our competitiveness in world markets; but a<br />
challenge to the whole momentum towards national economic recovery.<br />
Coming as they do on top of substantial industrial disruption,<br />
they offer us an urgent warning about the consequences of<br />
unchecked militant left wing union leadership.<br />
In spite of our resource endowments, our strengthening economy<br />
and our stable political environment, overseas customers will not<br />
continue to tolerate the disregard they are shown by sections<br />
of Australia's union leadership.<br />
The time is now for Governments, employers, union membership and<br />
the whole community to place Australia's future well being ahove<br />
the selfish pursuits of unrepresentative and militant minorities.<br />
If this can be done, the portents for the future are most<br />
favourable. The big industries of Australian agriculture, wool, meat, sugar<br />
and grains, have sound long term prospects. The dairy industry<br />
is now much better placed to take advantage of market potential. </p>
<p>Moreover, there are emerging industries the growing<br />
rice industry, the developing oilseeds industry and a spectacular<br />
growth in cotton production.<br />
The fruit industries, which are of great importance to<br />
South Australia, have undergone major and successful adjustment.<br />
We are well located geographically to meet increased food<br />
import demands from the high growth Middle East and Asian<br />
markets. In the 80s, Australia will have an increasingly<br />
important ro e -s a net food and energy exporter.<br />
The Government is determined to make sure that we have the<br />
economic environment in which these roles can be fully and<br />
productively played out. Tnevitablv, one of the challenges 4n<br />
any decade i the challenge of change; so it will be with<br />
rural industries,<br />
There will be new domestic and international agricultural<br />
demands and new and rapidly developing markets. A cohesive<br />
organisation such as yours will be a valuable spokesman for<br />
South Australian producers, not only on the commodity issues,<br />
but on the role and viability of rural industry in an<br />
expanding and complex economy.<br />
Farm organisations have become much more involved in discussion<br />
of these wider issues, and I am sure that your new body will<br />
be a constructive influence in the years ahead.<br />
I am grateful for the opportunity to be with you today and have<br />
pleasure in declaring your inaugural conference officially open.<br />
