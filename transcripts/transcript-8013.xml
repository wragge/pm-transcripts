SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
DAWN SERVICE, GALLIPOLI<br />
APRIL 1990<br />
The ANZACs who came ashore at this place, at this hour,<br />
on this day, seventy five years ago, and their comrades<br />
who followed them here during the eight long months of<br />
the dreadful combat that ensued, were not, despite all<br />
their efforts, to achieve their military objectives.<br />
But because of the courage with which they fought,<br />
because of their devotion to duty and their comradeship,<br />
because of their ingenuity, their good humour and their<br />
endurance, because these hills rang with their voices and<br />
ran with their blood, this place Gallipoli is, in one<br />
sense, a part of Australia.<br />
So we return to this remote peninsula today, privileged<br />
in the company of some of the diggers who fought here,<br />
and proud to identify in their exploits the very<br />
character of our nation.<br />
We have not come in order to dedicate this place it is<br />
already sacred because of the bravery and the bloodshed<br />
of the ANZACs.<br />
S We should instead dedicate ourselves to keeping bright<br />
the memory of those men who so unstintingly did what was<br />
asked of them on our behalf and to ensuring that the<br />
freedom and peace for which they so ardently yearned, for<br />
which they so bravely fought, and for which so many of<br />
them so selflessly gave their lives, shall not pass away.<br />
Let us remember too, in respect, the valour of those<br />
Tdrkish soldiers who died here in defence of their<br />
country. As dawn broke on this day in 1915, a terrible slaughter<br />
began. Today, as dawn emerges from the blackness of<br />
night, let us hope that the nations of the earth are<br />
emerging from the self-destructive practices of enmity<br />
and will build, in sunlight, a world of peace. </p>
