I was pleased today to meet Queensland Premier Rob Borbidge and Deputy Premier Joan Sheldon for the first time since the Government was sworn in. </p>
<p>Queensland is central to the future prosperity of our nation. It is a state whose high population growth and expanding economic base is built on a strong-small business sector.</p>
<p>I am confident that there will be close cooperation between governments in Canberra and Brisbane.</p>
<p> I completely agree with the Queensland Government that the Century Zinc Mine should go ahead and urge that all the parties involved cooperate to resolve outstanding issues. I support the Premier's efforts to bring the parties together to seek a successful outcome for<br />
the stakeholders, Queensland, and the national economy. </p>
<p>Mr Borbidge, Mrs Sheldon and I canvassed a number of other issues including national competition policy and Commonwealth-State financial relations. </p>
<p>The Premier indicated that his government was examining a range of options for electricity generation in Far North Queensland. It was agreed that the Tully-Millstream or any related proposals would not go ahead unless they met stringent environmental standards.</p>
<p>This is in keeping with my commitment at the National Press Club during the election campaign that Tully-Millstream would not go ahead if it were to cause significant environmental damage. </p>
<p>19 March 1996 </p>
