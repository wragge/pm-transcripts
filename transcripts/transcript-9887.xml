TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH KERRY O'BRIEN, ABC TV 7: 30 REPORT,<br />
14 DECEMBER 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
KOB: Prime Minister, in what circumstance would Australian troops go to the<br />
assistance of Indonesia?<br />
PM: Kerry, I think, you have got to see this agreement in context. For a<br />
start its title, An Agreement on Maintaining Security, security is not<br />
simply about external threats, it is about the whole environment of the<br />
region. It is about the foreign policy and trade policies of the<br />
countries. It is about the way we organise ourselves. What we are<br />
saying here is that Australia and Indonesia have a coincidence of<br />
views and interests in the strategic outlook of the region. And in that<br />
context, it says it will consult in the event of a challenge to either<br />
country. It will consult and decide what approach should be taken,<br />
whether it should be taken jointly or singularly.<br />
KOB: Ok, but you have acknowledged today that there are circumstances in<br />
which Australian military assistance might be given. Can you give us a<br />
hypothetical instance, I think it is important for Australians to<br />
understand those circumstance because you are talking about a big<br />
step.<br />
PM: Just understand this, this is a reciprocal agreement where Indonesia,<br />
in that circumstance you are speaking of, would also be likely to be<br />
supporting Australia. We have in place now, under the Five Power<br />
Defence Agreement, for the non-reciprocal defence of Malaysia and<br />
Singapore an agreement which commits Australia to discuss, consult<br />
and perhaps defend those two states without any commitment by them<br />
to us. The key thing about this agreement, Kerry, is that Indonesia is<br />
the first Asian country to put its hand up and say it would consider<br />
joining Australia in this sort of an agreement.<br />
KOB: Ok, now, to try to understand this further. In June this year, Defence<br />
Minister Robert Ray endorsed a defence study by Professor Paul Dibb </p>
<p>which warned that uneven economic growth in Asia could threaten<br />
peace in the region and that report identified China as a potential<br />
source of volatility. Do you agree with that scenario?<br />
PM: I think you may recall a couple of weeks ago I went to the Osaka<br />
APEC meeting where we adopted the Action Agenda on trade<br />
liberalisation coming from President Soeharto's Indonesian meeting.<br />
What that is very much about is resourcing East Asia, clearing away<br />
the road blocks, the constraints, the trade and non-trade barriers, the<br />
resource constraints to keeping the massive machinery of East Asia<br />
moving. Not just south-east Asia, but China, Korea, Japan, all those<br />
huge resources. I think, it is very important that given that East Asia<br />
has shown that it can bring their economies up, can distribute wealth,<br />
can have a rising living standard which we have seen in places like<br />
Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore and we are seeing it in Indonesia, in<br />
Malaysia, the challenge with China is also to get an evenness of<br />
income growth and that means resourcing it properly. So, APEC is<br />
very much about that, it is about keeping the growth running through<br />
East Asia and resourcing it.<br />
KOB: I understand that kind of scenario you are putting, but the other side of<br />
that coin is the one that Robert Ray virtually endorsed in June this<br />
year. I am asking you if you acknowledge the other side of the coin<br />
which is, that if the growth is uneven China could pose a threat in<br />
terms of volatility in the region. Is it that kind of potential threat that<br />
you are trying to anticipate in this agreement with Indonesia?<br />
PM: Is it a threat from China? No. But are you saying could there be<br />
tensions within the Chinese society and economy by uneven growth?<br />
Well, of course there could. The fact of the matter is that the way you<br />
maintain security is that you cover these bases like APEC, like free<br />
trade in goods and services, like proper regional defence cooperation,<br />
like a harmonious view between member governments and member<br />
states of these organisations in the area. That is what much of this is<br />
about. But, it is also about, in the event that there was an external<br />
threat to either one of us, we would consult one another.<br />
KOB: I want to move on with the time that is left. You say that the treaty is<br />
premised on our respect for the sovereignty, political independence<br />
and international integrity of all countries. Dare I ask it, what about<br />
East Timor's sovereignty?<br />
PM: East Timor is a province of Indonesia. There are problems in East<br />
Timor in respect of human rights issues which this treaty doesn't affect<br />
at all. This in no way affects the internal developments in Indonesia or<br />
any attitude we may take to them. Let me take the view, I mean, I see<br />
some reports already by members of the East Timor groups and<br />
lobbies here and others speaking for them, they seem to think,<br />
fallaciously, that some alienation of the relationship between Australia<br />
and Indonesia our largest neighbour will in some way help their </p>
<p>cause. The only thing that is going to help their cause from Australia<br />
is, basically, interventions by the Australian government for and on<br />
their behalf in a constructive climate of cooperation with the state of<br />
Indonesia.<br />
KOB: But, you have been doing that for years and there appears, in the end,<br />
to be no progress in resolving that issue.<br />
PM: Look at the relationship with Indonesia today and the culmination of<br />
this agreement compared to, say, three years ago or four years ago.<br />
KOB: But, we are talking about East Timor.<br />
PM: Yes, but I am talking about the breadth of the relationship. Look at the<br />
progress we have jointly had with our collaboration in APEC or in<br />
Cambodia or in any of these other places. The whole relationship with<br />
Indonesia is now thicker, it has got more struts to it, it is more<br />
meaningful, it is not just simply a narrow foreign policy relationship any<br />
more. Therefore, the government of Australia is always going to be in<br />
a far stronger position to deal with Timor in the Indonesian context<br />
than in any other environment. Kerry, this notion that the Timor lobby<br />
in some way expect Australia to disrupt its relationship exclusively with<br />
Indonesia on the Timor issue, is not going to help the Timorese<br />
people.<br />
KOB: By the same token, the Timor issue, it would seem, is not going to go<br />
away, it does seem to be in an appalling situation and Patrick Walters,<br />
an Australian correspondent in Jakarta who was senior adviser to Kim<br />
Bealzey when he was Defence Minister, wrote last week that the<br />
Indonesians appear to have run out of ideas on East Timor. The talk<br />
of special political autonomy, for example, has lapsed. Where can we<br />
expect them to go from here and what do you regard as an acceptable<br />
resolution of that problem?<br />
PM: It is for them to decide which way they wish to tackle the problems<br />
which are now quite endemic there and they are serious.<br />
KOB: But, what guidance do you seek to give them with this special<br />
relationship that you have?<br />
PM: Understand this point, this is a massive archipelago of huge cultural<br />
diversity in ethnic and religious terms. It is the biggest Muslim country<br />
in the world. It is, outside of this context of Timor, a country which has<br />
shown quite substantial tolerance to religious and ethnic groupings. It<br />
is used to managing diversity. This is now a rutted in problem for it<br />
and it is something we have indicated we would like to help with. I do<br />
this regularly in my discussions with President Soeharto as well as say<br />
when ever we believe human rights are being affected, forthrightly put<br />
our view and we will continue to do that. But Kerry, the important point<br />
is this, we are not going to hock the whole Indonesian relationship on </p>
<p>Timor. Now, that is what the lobby has got to understand. It is not<br />
going to happen because let me just say this to you Kerry, a Prime<br />
Minister's first duty is the security of his country and I have always<br />
regarded our, if you like, settlement with Indonesia whom we have<br />
embraced from its post colonial period as one of the primary building<br />
blocks of Australian security and foreign policy.<br />
KOB: And you have made that clear, but very quickly, last question. Does it<br />
matter to you in the framework of that relationship, that you always<br />
seem to be going to President Soeharto, he doesn't come to you and<br />
now you are off to Jakarta again to sign this treaty on Monday.<br />
Superficially at least, that doesn't suggest an even relationship?<br />
PM: Look at the results. The largest free trade arrangement in the world in<br />
APEC in the world 63 per cent of world GDP. The only genuine<br />
north south arrangement in the world. Look at this agreement which<br />
would have been inconceivable just a few years ago.<br />
KOB: But, do you concede that superficially that does not suggest an even<br />
relationship. How many times have you been there?<br />
PM: No, my frequency there or his visits here are not measure of the<br />
importance of the bilateral relationship or the way in which the<br />
interests of Australia and Indonesia are accommodated. For a start,<br />
this agreement is the only one of its kind Indonesia has with anyone<br />
and let me repeat a point I made earlier, it is the only Asian country<br />
that has actually put its hand up to say it would contemplate such an<br />
arrangement with Australia about Australia's security.<br />
KOB: And I'm going to have to cut you off there, I'm sorry, because we have<br />
to cross to Sarajevo to Tusla in a moment, but thanks very much for<br />
joining us.<br />
PM: Good, Kerry.<br />
KOB: Thank you.<br />
