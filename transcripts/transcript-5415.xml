SPECIAL GRANT FOR QUEENSLAND.<br />
Subject to the passage of the necessary legislation, Queensland<br />
will receive a special grant of $ 6.7 million in 1980-81.<br />
The grant is a general purpose payment and is in addition<br />
to the State's tax sharing entitlement.<br />
The special grant for Queensland in 1980-81 was recommended<br />
by the Commonwealth Grants Commission and represents a . completion.<br />
grant in respect of 1978-79. Although Queensland has applied<br />
for a special grant in respect of 1980-81, it has indicated<br />
that it is not seeking an advance grant. Accordingly, the<br />
Grants Commission has made no recommendation with respect<br />
to an advance grant payment in 1980-81. The effect of this<br />
is that the actual payment in 1980-81 will be smaller than<br />
has typically been the case in recent years.<br />
The total general revenue assistance paid to Queensland in<br />
1979-80 payments of tax sharing entitlement plus<br />
special grant) was almost $ 965 million. On present-estimates<br />
corresponding payments in 1980-81 are expected to increase<br />
by about 12.5 per cent. OR98( ZY rl4e / I </p>
