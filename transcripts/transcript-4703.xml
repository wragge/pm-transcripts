PRESS-OFFICE 10 MAY 1978<br />
PRIME MINISTERS STATEMENT<br />
TO TELEVISION CAMERAS<br />
I am quite certain that all Australians will deplore the<br />
barbaric murder of Aldo Moro, one of the most distinguished<br />
political leaders from Italy. He has been a great leader and<br />
his assassination, his murder, his kidnapping, comes at a-. time<br />
when he had been seeking through the democratic process to<br />
seek some kind of consensus within the Italian community and<br />
nation. This is another serious attack at the heart of the democratic<br />
process, at the heart of a democratic society-and I am quite<br />
certain that all Australians join me in offering their sorrow<br />
and deepest sympathy to the whole Italian people--to the Italian<br />
nation.. The plague of terrorist activity must be opposed with all the<br />
vigour at our command and countries in support of a peaceful<br />
way of a democratic process need to reinforce each other in<br />
making sure that opportunities available to: terrorists<br />
are minimised to the maximum extent possible. There is no<br />
excuse for this kind of action anywhere in any society. and<br />
least of all is there any excuse in a democratic society which.<br />
from its very nature leaves open the possibility of reform<br />
and change through peaceful processes.<br />
Democratic nations need to reinforce each other in opposition<br />
to terrorism. The Australian Government's view in these<br />
particular matters has been very firmly expressed. It was<br />
a monstrous act, one of the worst acts that we have seen in a very<br />
long. time, and again, on behalf of the Australian Government and<br />
people I would like to offer the sympathy and sorroii to all<br />
the people of Italy.<br />
QUETIN: Prime Minister, was the Italian Government right not<br />
toJo a Ueal with the terrorists?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: If you had read, or if you re-read, the first<br />
iMen-i-i U-E-ur-at Monash University when I spoke about terrorism,<br />
you will see there that I was stating policy because we believe<br />
that you can't compromise with terrorism. You can try and do a<br />
deal but the end might be the same and if terrorism is to be<br />
defeated, the terrorists need to understand that there will be<br />
no compromise.<br />
QUESTION: Mr. Fraser, if you had been captured in a terrible<br />
siTtuation like that, and were sending letters to the Party, the<br />
Government and things, would you expect the Australian nation.<br />
through its representatives, to ignore those letters which might<br />
have been under duress? / 2 </p>
<p>2<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't think it's a question of ignores<br />
I 7--hin--h any nation would be doing what it possibly could to<br />
secure the safety and freedom of a person who had been<br />
kidnapped. That doesn't mean to say that you would compromise<br />
other people in whatever arrangements are made. You've got<br />
the normal processes of your security forces and your police<br />
who would be obviously enquiring and seeking to secure the<br />
freedom and safety of aperson in that position.<br />
QUESTION: You wouldn't expect to buy a<br />
p compromise for yourself?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: For myself at the price of other people?<br />
T T-hi-F t itwould be wrong. 000---</p>
