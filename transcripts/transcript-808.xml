CHAMBER OF M4ANU3FACTUR~ ES OF NEhJ SOUTH WALLS<br />
ANNUAL DINNER HELD AT THE AUSTRALIA HOTEL<br />
SYDNEY, ON 12T1H SEPTEMBER, 1963.<br />
Speech by the Prm iitr h t ~ oL ~ rRbr eze<br />
Sir, Your Excellency and Gentlemen:<br />
I am in a very difficult position tonight, In the<br />
first place, I am not accustomed to making speeches ( Laughter).<br />
In the second place, I am in the presence of a bunch of fellows<br />
who have almost counted me out on one or two occasions in the<br />
past ( Laughter) which I must say I enjoyed. In the third<br />
place, I Learned at the last moment that the man who has the<br />
great advantage of being the second last speaker who is proposing<br />
the toast of " The Guests" is unhappily not here -John Walker<br />
and his place is being taken by my favourite pupil, John Hurley.<br />
( Laughter) And perhaps, therefore, I ought to begin with John<br />
Hurley, because, last week I think it was, I was in Papua and<br />
Now Guinea and when wve got up into the Highlands of New Guinea,<br />
we saw a great number of people whose garments wore slightly<br />
sketchy. ( Laughter) They looked rather like B~ ondi or Manly,<br />
and as I was taken around, I said to my friends who, I hope,<br />
understood me, I said " You know, John Hurley would do no<br />
business in ths country," ( Laughter) Then as I thought what<br />
might be done if we do our' duty by Papua and New Guinea, I<br />
thought that I would like to be out of office by that time and<br />
take a few shares in Johnts business. ( Laughter) ' dell, I just<br />
leave that to you, you understand these things so much better<br />
than I do. That after all is a minor trouble. I knew that<br />
I was coming down here this week and I knew that my old and<br />
bitter enemy, Bob lieffron, would be here ( Laughter), flushed<br />
with success from an overseas journey ( Laughter) and I opeiqed<br />
my paper you know, you chaps who just go on making profits,<br />
you don't understand this but there is nothing a politician<br />
likes more than to enjoy the misories of other people ( Laughter)<br />
and every now and thcn you encounter a state of affairs in<br />
which the other fellow is able to do something that you canft<br />
do. Now, here am I there's no news, there's no novelty about<br />
this remark I have a majority of one ( Laughter), a state of<br />
affairs to which all of you, in your various ways, contributed.<br />
( Laughter) And I opened my paper -I hesitate to say which<br />
one because they arc all here ( Laoughter)-and I read that my<br />
old and friendly enemy, Bob Heffron has stood up on the floor<br />
of the House and has said to a supporter, a somewhat doubtful<br />
supporter perhaps I don't know ( Laughter) I mean, we all<br />
have those ( Laughter) and with a sweeping gesture has also<br />
said to the Leader of the Opposition, " You can hava him"<br />
( Laughter) I didn't feel too good about this, ( Laughter)<br />
I didn't think I had quite come to the point of living on the<br />
crumbs that fall from the rich man's table ( Laughter), He has<br />
got a majority of X plus Y plus Z; I have a majority of one.<br />
( Laughter) If you wake up some morning and you open your<br />
favourite journal and you see " Menzies said to So-a-nd-so<br />
' Leave and Join the Opposition" then you will know that I<br />
am going to have an election ( Laughter) ( Applause)<br />
Therefore, Mr. Premier, I really felt that in spite<br />
of the happy personal relations that you and I have had that<br />
this was rubbing it in a bit. ( Laughter) Don't you think so?<br />
. oee/ </p>
<p>2.-<br />
All of those of that opinion say " Aye" ( Voices " Aye") To<br />
the contrary " No" the "~ Ayes" I have it.<br />
Well, of course, this is politics, when you have an<br />
enormous majority as before you got to work, I had ( Laughter)<br />
you assume a rather gloomy attitude. Well, you know, you fear<br />
the worst when you have a majority Of 32, but when you have a<br />
majority of one, you assume a eupeptic appearance. One a<br />
marvellous majorityl Marvellous4 And everybody says, " lIsn~ t<br />
it wonderful to have a majority of one?" Now, I refer this<br />
question, not necessarily to a Royal Commission ( Laughter) but<br />
for some domestic investigat io ntohePmirfNeSuh<br />
Wales the simple question, Doc or, being What does it feel<br />
like to have a majority of one? And when we ore both kicked out,<br />
old boy, if I am still alive, I will write you a little essay<br />
on that matter. Anyhow, that's enough of that kind. of nonsense.<br />
My job tonight is to propose the Toast of Australian<br />
Industry. I must say, gentlemen, that I admire tne skill with<br />
which you use these general tezt. s _ Austral-ian Industry becaluse<br />
if you printit with a capital then, Of course it includes<br />
primary industry, secondary industry, tertiary inaustry, public<br />
industry, private industry, and my task is to propose the toast<br />
of the lot which means, in reality, that I am up here to propose<br />
the toast of Australia and triis, I think, is a very honourable<br />
task, But having mentioned all the capital I might<br />
perhaps be allowed to add a small I also propose the toast<br />
of " personal industry" in Austr3lia because in reality, whon<br />
we have got over all the political arguments, the truth remains7<br />
doesn't it that the future of this country your country, my<br />
country the present and the future both do. pend on hew far the<br />
primary industry, secondary industry, tertiary industry, public<br />
industry private industry and personal industry conspire together<br />
for the luture of the country. This is quite right, because<br />
unless all of thnese things march together then the development<br />
and gr~ owth of Australia will not be what It should be.<br />
Now, of course7 people like to hoar you say what<br />
ought to be done, but a grea~ t deal has been done. I know that in<br />
any country like our own a marvellous country there are<br />
builders and there are " knockers". I make no expression of<br />
disrespect to my old friend whom I have never met, Mr. Whelan the<br />
Wrecker ( Laughter) " Whelan the Wrecker was because<br />
I know a certain amount of wrecking is necessary before a building<br />
goes up. But really, I think we all ought to take a little timie<br />
off occasionally to ask ourselves whether we are " knockers" which<br />
is easy, rather clever, quite simple. I have always been afraid<br />
that when I finally go~ out of my present discontents and can<br />
sit in an armchair in the corner of a club and say, " I dont<br />
understand what these fools are about" well7 I hope I shall<br />
understand how simple it will be to achieve a reputition as a<br />
critic, But what goes on in Australia and what has gone on in<br />
Australia is not to the credit of the " knockers" but to the<br />
credit of the builders to the credit of the co-operators, to<br />
the credit -of the people who have looked forward and who have<br />
done their stuff and have seen a vision of what can occur in<br />
Australia. Somebody on my staff, some faithful chap because<br />
we all have a few faithful chaps reminded me only yesterday<br />
that not long ago I went up to the North-4est of Western<br />
Australia to the Ord River to the opening of the Kununurra Darn,<br />
and this is a fascinating affair. It is still, in a sense,<br />
e @ e eo 6*/ </p>
<p>-3<br />
experimental. It is experimental on a large scale. Here is a<br />
part of Australia i~ n which a great river which from time to time<br />
becomes rather exuberant can be dammed and can be distributed over<br />
the countryside, over land which normally wouldn't grow very much.<br />
And there you are you can see acres and hundreds of acres and<br />
thousands of acres of land under cotton, under all sorts of<br />
various crops sa-fflowor and so on, and you begin to realise<br />
what hap~ ens in a dramatic way in Australia when water is applied<br />
to an otherwise unpromising soil,<br />
This, I found rather oxciting, and if you will allow<br />
me the rare privilege that I have of quoting myself in my own<br />
favour, T will quote what I said on that occasion, and that was,<br />
and I commend this to everybody that the whole h-istory of<br />
Australia is the history of the impossible becoming the possible,<br />
of the possible becoming the probable and of the probable becoming<br />
a living certainty ( Hear, hear) ( Applause). Whenever I read,<br />
some months afterwards, something that I said, I am not like the<br />
fellow who said " What a genius I had when I wrote those lines."<br />
I usually sa1y, ? Take it away and burn it". But on this occasion,<br />
I repeat it, and this might very well be our text, because her'e<br />
I am proposing the Toast of Industry Industry with particular<br />
reference, of course, to manufacturing industry which has had so<br />
much to do with Australian development and will have more and more<br />
to do in the future. But Industry.<br />
Why do we take so much time off to argue with each<br />
other about matters which are of no great importance when in<br />
reality, what you and I have the groot privilege of engaging in<br />
is the task of building a young country, in terms of population a<br />
small country, in such a fashion, so generously, so ambitiously,<br />
that in a hundred years' time, the people who then live in<br />
Australia and who have a population of 60 to 70 million people<br />
a great nation. a great people, a groat race will look back on<br />
us and say " Well, at any rate, they had imagination. They laid<br />
the foundations. They got together." Whenever I read the<br />
history of another country the United States if you like, and<br />
I have read a great deal of the history of the United States in<br />
my time I am not so much interested in the things they disagreed<br />
about except to identify them as I am about how far their<br />
ideas coalesced to produce an immense result,<br />
You knew, gentlemen the other day by some error on<br />
somebodyts part, I was invited to deliver the Jefferson Lecture<br />
at Monticello in the United States at Charlottosvillel Virginia,<br />
and on behalf of my country, I took this as a compliment because<br />
it is the first time anybody outside the United States has ever<br />
been invited to do it. And so I brushed up my recollection of<br />
he legal history of the early part of the United States and its<br />
general history and it suddenly dawned on me that there was one<br />
singular fact Thomas Jefferson, a very great man by any<br />
measurement, great enough to incur hostility in any quarter today<br />
( Laughter) Thomas Jefferson had been the American Minister<br />
( they didn't have an Embassy in those days) in France. He came<br />
back. He was the Draftsman of the American Declaration of<br />
Independence. He was the First Secretary of State in Washington~ s<br />
administration and, by any measurement George Washington was one<br />
of the great men of modern history, full of courage, fortitude,<br />
understanding and Thomas Jefferson was his Secretary of State.<br />
And then later on he was Vice President of America and then for<br />
two terms, he was President of the United States, When he first<br />
became~ President of the United States, he presided ever a United<br />
States of r5-million people. Please remaerbe r that. Five and a<br />
half million people. 909 69/ </p>
<p>I, for some reason or another that you may analyse<br />
in my absence, have been Prime Minister of Australia for some<br />
years and today, we have 11 million pc ople. Eleven million<br />
people. We sometimes feel, don't we, that eleven million poople<br />
is a very small number of people. We are a small country.<br />
Compar'e us with the vast masses of people. We are no great shakes<br />
after all. If Jefferson had said that if Jefferson had written<br />
off the United States because it had afmillion people, the whole<br />
history of the world would have been a1tered. Make no mistake<br />
about it. We, in Australia, with 11 million people, with all the<br />
advantages that we have in life, with all the prospects that we<br />
have in the future, have a tremendous opportunity, provided wie<br />
pre prepared as individuals to apply industry to work, to sweat,<br />
not to ask too much for too little 2 but to feel that we , sre building<br />
a nation which will someday be as important in the world as the<br />
United States of America is today. Look, if we could only understand<br />
this, this is something tremendous.<br />
I know thore are a lot of poople who say, " Well, we<br />
live we die we are buried and so what." You know, if we really<br />
all thought that, if we really all thought that, it would be a<br />
pretty dyspeptic sort of life, wouldn't it? Here today and gone<br />
tomorrow. I am not engaging in arguments about theological<br />
matters, whether people believe in a future life or not is their<br />
own business, I do, But it is their own business. But the<br />
greatest disbeliever in a future life in some astral sphere must<br />
still believe that what we are doing today in Australia must have<br />
some effect on what happens in Australia in fifty years' time;<br />
in other words that we have our contribution to make whether we<br />
know about it Irom some other place or we don't, whether we are<br />
recognised for it or we are not. These things dontt matter all<br />
that much, The truth of the matter is that we are doing something,<br />
we are building something for the future. A'nd our great-grandchildren<br />
may net think about us at all except when they go and<br />
see some plaque in my case and say, " Well old great-greatgrandfather,<br />
hr. adafonain tn. Well that doesn.' t<br />
matter very much,, Foundation stones don't matter very much.<br />
I'd like them to feel that you and I, in our generation, had laid<br />
more than foundation stones, that we h( ad done something to build<br />
industrially, in all its aspects, a great country. Then we willj<br />
from wherever we arc you in Heaven., I in Hell ( Laughter) -' we<br />
will, in somne mysterious fashion, perhaps? become conscious of<br />
it. But this requires not only great faith and great energy and<br />
very little narrowness of mzind, very little dwelling on the<br />
particular interest at the moment; this requires a broad mnind<br />
and a constructive sense,<br />
Sir, I was up the other day in Papua and New Guinea<br />
and here is a country which presents us with a challenge. We<br />
have been tremendously assisted in our consideration of our<br />
problems in that country by a group of meon led by Jimr Kirby<br />
( Sir James Kirby) who went up there not long ago and had a look<br />
at it; and only the ether day by a professional group from the<br />
World Bank who went there and will in due course present us with<br />
a report on it.<br />
We can't look at ourselves as if we were in a watertight<br />
compartment. A1re we to look at Australia and say " Well<br />
our groat ambition is to be purely self-contained noboly else<br />
need apply; nobody else need compete" 9 Are we io say that to<br />
Papua and Now Guinea? Are we to say to this country for which<br />
we have accepted the greatest international responsibilities in<br />
a e * 1 </p>
<p>our history a task which is overlooked by people, many of whom<br />
would love to see us fail are we to say, " Well, what happens to<br />
Papua-New Guinea doesn't matter very much. They can grow rubber<br />
they can grow tea" and I think they'll grow more and mora of i<br />
" they can grow coffee, they can grow cocoanuts, copra, they can<br />
grow cattle." Well, all these things are at their very beginning,<br />
but you can never think of the problem of Papua-New Guinea as if<br />
this country were isolated from us, as if we could treat it for all<br />
purposes as if it were a foreign country because it is not a<br />
foreign country, Papua-New Guinea is the greatest responsibility<br />
that this country of ours has ever taken on in the eye of international<br />
judgment. And therefore I was delighted when distinguished<br />
members of your own from Sir James Kirby down went and had a look<br />
at this business, went and made valuable reports on it. Never<br />
lot us get too bedded down on the immediate problems that we have,<br />
although they are important. Of course they are important.<br />
But let us all of us you, I, all the rest of us feel that<br />
the judgment that will be applied to us is not the judgment of<br />
the shareholders at your next general meeting, or the judgment<br />
of the electors at my next general election, but will be the<br />
judgment of people, in the long run, who say, '" Jhat did these<br />
ancestors of ours, what did these predecessors do as builders<br />
not only in Australia but elsewhere,"<br />
Now, the only other thing I want to say to you is this,<br />
Sir. I have spoken too long, but this exercises ny mind or<br />
what passes for my mind. There has been a great deal of hurroosh<br />
I don't know how to spell that word but it sounds all right<br />
( Laughter) about the problem of restrictive practices, of trade<br />
practices. ( Laughter) That's right, this rings a bell. ( Laughter)<br />
And of course all this problem evokes two classes of people who<br />
dont matter. One the people who say, " I'm against it, whatever<br />
it is." Well, that's silly. There are others who say, " I don't<br />
understand what it is but I am in favour of it" and that doesn't<br />
matter. What I have been interested to discover in the last<br />
year, is that very, very few people come along an say, " I'm<br />
against anything." The people who count on this matter are the<br />
people who say, " Well, yes, there are some things that are done<br />
that ought not to be done but a real important problem is to<br />
discover what they are, how sensibly a scheme may be developed<br />
on those matters," and I like those people for the very simple<br />
reason that I think they are very sensible and I would like to<br />
toll you that in the middle of all the hurroosh, we had last week<br />
a discussion no, it was this week, last Monday with representatives<br />
of the Manufacturing Industries Advisory Council, their<br />
spokesman being Mr. Irish, and we had put to us the most balanced,<br />
sensible and impressive body of ideas on this matter that I have<br />
yet heard and I would like to say that on behalf of the Government<br />
we are very grateful for this.<br />
We are not dogmatic on this matter, we are not<br />
doctrinaire on this matter. Indeed, we are like you. We want<br />
to preserve competition and, so far as we can, with good sense,<br />
eliminate unfairness and injustice. Well, it is easy enough to<br />
say that in the broad. When you come down to the point as to<br />
how you are to do it, you get to a problem which will, in due<br />
course, exercise the Governments of the States who have exactly<br />
the same interest as we have on this matter and whose co-operation<br />
is essential in this field, and all I want to tell you is that<br />
what has been said to me and to ry colleagues in the last few<br />
days has been so constructive and so helpful that I think it may<br />
well determine the future course of action. ( Applause) / 6 </p>
<p>6<br />
Sir, when I was coming here tonight my wife said<br />
to me because she has gone to see somebody else " How<br />
late do you think you will be?" And, I said, " Oh, I don't<br />
know. About half past ten" and the driver, who knows me<br />
of old, said relevantly, though perhaps impertinently, he<br />
said, ' Well Sir, ( one of the great advantages of<br />
life is that the driver calls you " Sir" ( Laughter) he said,<br />
" Sir, the year before last it was a quarter to twelve and<br />
last year it was a quarter past twelve," So I said to my<br />
wife, " All right, my dear. When you have seen as much as<br />
you want to see of Earthy or whatever her name is<br />
( Laughter) you go home. And, therefore, in the meantime Sir,<br />
thanking you for your usual and marvellous hospitality. I<br />
will invite all my temporary collaborators ( Laughter) to<br />
stand up and drink with me the Toast of Australian Industry.<br />
I_ </p>
