fATEMB~ NT BY TIM, PRIME MINISTER, MR. HAROLD HOLT<br />
SYDNEY AIRPORT ON HIS RETURN FROM HIS TOUR OF<br />
SOUTH EAST ASIA. 1st May, 19GG<br />
Well, gentlemen, I don't propose to say a great deal<br />
in detail here for very obvious and good reasono.. The first<br />
is that just having come off a rather long and tiring flight<br />
after what has been a very heavy programme, literally more than<br />
sixteen hours a day in active operation of one kind or another,<br />
this is not the state of mind or body in which to make<br />
carefully considered statements about matters of the degree of<br />
importance that I havre been deLling with. And the other good<br />
reason is that in these circumstances, the first detailed report<br />
I should be making is to my colleagues in Cabinet and then to<br />
the-Parliament. I expect to be talking to my colleagues on<br />
Tuesday mornino when we will have a meeting of Cabinet, and<br />
either that same day or on one of the later dates in the week,<br />
to Parliament. But I can say in general terms tj~ iat this journey has<br />
been one of the most rewarding experiences of a lifetime and I<br />
am going to derive tCremaendous benefit from it for myself<br />
personally in the strength of conviction it will b~ in to<br />
judgments and assessments of particular situations, and -the<br />
value it will possess, I believe, for my colleagues as I am<br />
abole to contribute on a better informed basis to our discussions<br />
on external and defence matters. There is no effective<br />
substitute, as most of us have discovered, for contact directly<br />
on the spot, either with a situation or with personalities, and<br />
this has proved very true in relation to the quite exntensive<br />
journey I have undertaken. Although I have only been away<br />
from Australia for some ten days, we have covered discussions<br />
in four countries in that time and I must haire visited twenty<br />
or more significant locations either of military operation or<br />
extensive governmental activity. For example, I have been<br />
talking about the Singapore naval base for many years but it<br />
wasn't until now that I was able to ins-pect it and get a<br />
thorough briefing on operations there, fly over the area by<br />
helicopter and come back with a pretty clear idea of what was<br />
going on there. In Viet Ham, although the issues have been clear<br />
enough in my mind for a firm judgment to be made and for the<br />
government to have definite policies in relation to Viet Nam,<br />
it is only when you are on the spot and see for yourself what<br />
is going on, sometining of the atmosphere of the city, that<br />
these matters tend to fall into perspective. For eizample, you<br />
read day by day of episodes occurring in Saigon arid people<br />
get the impression that the place is in a state of turmoil,<br />
that chaotic condiLions exist in the city. Saigon has a<br />
population of just on two million people and it is rather like<br />
the reporting that gjoes on about a bu! hfire in Australia as<br />
read by somebody in London. They wonder whether we are all<br />
in a holocaust. Wlell, as vie know, it could be occurring<br />
1,500 miles from where we are. And in Saigon, life goes on<br />
a little more hazardous than in some other places, but the life<br />
of the city goes on, affected by the dioruptive action which<br />
the coimunists bring to it. For example, I was asking about<br />
-their electricity supply, which is clearly inadequate for a<br />
city of that dimension, and they were telling me about the </p>
<p>hydro electric power which they had in the north, but every<br />
time they f ixed it uap, the~ iet Cong cuit thc wires so tney had<br />
no electricity from that hydro-electric station.<br />
W~ hen you came Ito our own troops you get pictures<br />
from read i nj day by day accounts of what is going on there, of<br />
our troops having a very heavy time almost on an uninterrupted<br />
cycle of operations. W17ell, of course, this is not the way the<br />
Army fuinctions. They do engage in operations of a very<br />
uncomfortable and dangerous kind, but then they come back to<br />
the camp. They are there in camp for refurbishing, refreshing<br />
and spending, some of them, a bit of time on rotation at Vung Tau<br />
which is the recreational seaside centre we have taken aid<br />
equipped for just this very purpose. Some of their time they<br />
go out on their programmnes of civic action to which we attach<br />
a good deal of importance as the positive constructive side of<br />
helping a people less fortunate and less able to look after<br />
themselves, and the need for this is clearly perceived and now<br />
determinedly pursued by the Government of South Viet Nam and by<br />
the American authorities concerned and by our own troops. But<br />
in a variety of ways, the reality differs from the impressions<br />
which one might have otherwise have gained. There are some<br />
things which one can report as definite improvements over what<br />
we have known before. The standard of the Ar~ my cooks has<br />
certainly improved since the last world war not just because<br />
they turned it on for me but '-hey excplained that their cooks now<br />
go thirough food school training and they are a pretty keen lot.<br />
I had a buffet meal with the boys at Bien Hoa which I uwouldn't<br />
have found surpassed at eell, who 1. will I givie a boost to?<br />
the Chevron Hilton or the Southern Cross aiotel or any of<br />
tiese other illustrious establishments.<br />
And another thing which represents a great improvement<br />
is that fatalities from battle casualties are occurrinU at only<br />
half the rate taat occurred in Korea and the Second World War<br />
because thanks to this helicopter service, they get the wounded<br />
men out of the battle area to ei-Lher a casualty station or a<br />
hospital in about less than half the time that they have ever<br />
been able to achieve in earlier . battles.<br />
There are various points of interest of that kind<br />
which one encounters and I -merely mention them illustratively<br />
again to illustrate that all is not grim in the life that ia led<br />
by the troops there.<br />
I paid visits to Terendak and Butterworth two of our<br />
stations in Malaysia and they are most; delightful camp establishmnents,<br />
lovely green lawns, swimmuing pools. At Terendak,<br />
the men had just left for their tour of duty in Borneo but I<br />
met some 450 wives there, in charming suimmer frocks with<br />
small children darting about in all directions. It wras an<br />
indication of an aspect of military service which we don't<br />
normally read about and I merely mention these matters because<br />
I think that a journey of this sort does enable one to get a<br />
better balanced perspective.<br />
But as to the main purpose, this, I t~ iink, has been<br />
well publicised. originally my idea and thirs goes back to<br />
my first days in office was to seize the opportunity as early<br />
as it presen-Led itself, of visiting our troops in thie field. </p>
<p>A This has now been done and I have, I think, visited most of<br />
the centres, if not all the principal centres in South East<br />
Asia in wnich we have our troops stationed. And I found<br />
them in splendid spirits with morale high. Those who had<br />
been there any length of time were, naturally enough, looking<br />
forward to coming back to Australia, but I found no<br />
indications of any dissatisfaction with conditions in the<br />
service or the life they were living. They were keen, alert,<br />
obviously enthusiastic about the job they were doing, with<br />
a clear idea those that I talked to, anyhow of the need<br />
for them being there and what the job was all about.<br />
And when you reflect on it, in the four countries<br />
they have all been facing the same threat, perhaps in differing<br />
degree, and the degree of intensity has varied fromi time to<br />
time. It wasn't so long ago that i. was the communist guerilla<br />
activity in Malaysia that was giving us the concern. The<br />
communist activity continues there as it does in Borneo. In<br />
Thailand they are concerned abouL'-increased communist probing<br />
and infill-ration and, of course, you find it exemplified in<br />
its most active form currently in Viet Nam.<br />
So that in the countries I visited, it was of great<br />
value to have talked closely, intimately with the heads of<br />
Å“ jovernment and be taken completely into their confidence as<br />
to their view of things and the even%' s-occurring in their<br />
country. I feel that Australia has strengthened its friendship<br />
in each of these areas and that is one of the continuing<br />
dividends which we shall derive from the visit.<br />
Now this is almost beginning to take the character<br />
of a report to Parliament and I said at the outset this was<br />
not to happen. But I feel encouraged by what I have seen.<br />
I hope to report fully on it to my fellow Australians, but I<br />
can say this with great certainty, that if they had gone<br />
through the same ex~ perience with me they would share my pride<br />
in the quality, character and ability of service which is being<br />
given by so many Australian men and some Australian women in<br />
these various theatres which I have visited.<br />
I could just add, perhaps, a postscript about the<br />
National Servicemen. There were a few that I encountered<br />
who had gone forward either as special units or as part of<br />
some advance party, and both they and the men of the Regular<br />
Army were clearly going to get along very well together.<br />
They were welcomed by the Regular Army volunteers. I believe<br />
that the National Servicemen will add a chapter to Australian<br />
military history of which they will be proud and which we will<br />
come to applaud. </p>
