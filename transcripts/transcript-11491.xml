<p>E&amp;OE..........................................................................................</p>
<p>SALLY SARA:</p>
<p>Mr Howard why should Kim Beazley have to make his promises now when it</p>
<p> was only two weeks before the last election when you spelt out the detail</p>
<p> of your entire tax package?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Sally all this started when Mr Beazley made a promise to the state Labor</p>
<p> leaders. The great weakness in Mr Beazleys' position is that he says</p>
<p> I can't say this about income tax, I can't say that about the</p>
<p> health insurance rebate but I can promise the state Labor leaders that</p>
<p> the roll back of the GST won't leave the states with less money.</p>
<p> In other words he allowed himself to be bullied by Mr Bracks, Mr Beattie</p>
<p> and Mr Bacon down in Burnie and he has only got himself to blame because</p>
<p> you can't promise to roll back the GST, guarantee the states they</p>
<p> will be no worse off, keep the budget in balance and not in some way lift</p>
<p> income tax. It's just impossible and Mr Beazley has now become the</p>
<p> victim of his own strategy of being all things to all men. He has tried</p>
<p> to quieten down interest groups criticising aspects of the GST, then he</p>
<p> has turned around and promised the state Labor leaders there will be no</p>
<p> problem for them. And now he is saying look don't ask me to go into</p>
<p> detail about anything else it's too far out from the next election.</p>
<p> Well if it was too far out from the next election in relation to the deficit</p>
<p> and all these other things, why wasn't it too far out from the next</p>
<p> election in relation to the promise on the roll back. Mr Beazley will</p>
<p> have no alternative but to lift income tax if he is to roll back the GST</p>
<p> and leave the states no worse off.</p>
<p>SALLY SARA:</p>
<p>Mr Howard on the issue of the health insurance rebate. Can you promise</p>
<p> at this stage that that is an initiative the Government is planning to</p>
<p> keep forever? Isn't that a short term measure?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, it's not a short term measure. We have always believed in it.</p>
<p> Always. And it's a very good measure. And I challenge Mr Beazley</p>
<p> this morning to guarantee to the 32 percent of Australians who have private</p>
<p> health insurance, many of them retired people, many of them self-funded</p>
<p> retirees, many of them pensioners who regard private health insurance</p>
<p> as a very important area of comfort for them if they get sick and they</p>
<p> welcome that rebate. And can I just point out to your listeners Sally</p>
<p> that taking away the private health insurance rebate is a tax increase,</p>
<p> because it's a tax rebate. And because after the first of July 80</p>
<p> percent of Australian tax payers will be on a top marginal rate of no</p>
<p> more than thirty cents in the dollar, which is the value of the rebate,</p>
<p> it would represent taking away full tax deductibility of private health</p>
<p> insurance for 80 percent of the people who now have it. Now that is a</p>
<p> tax increase however you describe it and I have no doubt that people like</p>
<p> Jenny Macklin and others inside the Labor party are very keen on the idea</p>
<p> of axing it. They have never believed in it because they don't believe</p>
<p> in private provision for health. They have bled the private health insurances</p>
<p> dry when they were in office, even Graham Richardson appealed to them</p>
<p> to stop the haemorrhaging when he was Health Minister but they ran it</p>
<p> down and we have patiently built it up and we are very proud of what we</p>
<p> have done and for the first time in a decade, you are seeing a turn around,</p>
<p> you are actually seeing people going back into private health insurance.</p>
<p>SALLY SARA:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, lets get back to this key issue of what is being ruled in</p>
<p> and ruled out. Are we getting into dangerous territory here? Yesterday</p>
<p> you were asked whether there would be additional tax cuts, post the first</p>
<p> of July and you said after the first of July that's something the</p>
<p> Government will consider the situation. Aren't you left open to questions</p>
<p> too about whether things are being ruled in or out.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Not at all Sally. We went to the last election with a plan. We went through</p>
<p> a lot of political pain to win that election. We were courageous enough</p>
<p> to lay out all our plans. The popular bits, the not so popular bits. The</p>
<p> people re-elected us. You know what happens after the first of July the</p>
<p> average Australian family will get a tax cut, a personal tax cut of forty-seven</p>
<p> dollars a week after allowing for the GST. Forty-seven dollars a week.</p>
<p> Now that is what happens after the first of July and it's the value</p>
<p> of that tax cut which is at risk as a result of Mr Beazley's conduct</p>
<p> over the last few days if the Labor Government were to be elected. Now</p>
<p> that is what happens after the first of July. I mean we have had the courage</p>
<p> to lay out a plan. We've been criticised for taking on what is something</p>
<p> that you know you can easily run a scare campaign about. But we believe</p>
<p> that tax reform was good in the long-term interest of Australia.</p>
<p>SALLY SARA:</p>
<p>But you layed out that plan two weeks prior to the election. Kim Beazley</p>
<p> is what eighteen months out from an election. Why should he have to spell</p>
<p> out the detail now?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Sally, he started it. He was the one who spelt out the detail to the</p>
<p> Labor Premiers in Burnie. I mean he was the person who was bullied by</p>
<p> them into undertaking not to leave the states any worse off. In other</p>
<p> words he knew enough about the budget in two years time to give that promise.</p>
<p> But he is now pretending to you and the rest of the Australian community</p>
<p> that he doesn't know enough about the budget situation to give a</p>
<p> commitment about the private health insurance rebate. Now you can't</p>
<p> have it both ways. You can't say I know enough about the economic</p>
<p> situation of the country to guarantee the states they will be no worse</p>
<p> off but I don't know enough about the economic situation of the country</p>
<p> to guarantee there will be no lift in income tax. I mean he is cornered</p>
<p> by his own weakness. If he had not been bullied then maybe the situation</p>
<p> would have been different. But having said that the states will be no</p>
<p> worse off as a result of the roll back then he has no alternative but</p>
<p> to go the extra distance and answer all the questions that are now being</p>
<p> raised because he cant have it both ways. You cant say on the one hand</p>
<p> I know nothing about the budget therefore I can't give any undertakings.</p>
<p> But then say to the Labor premiers oh don't worry you will be all</p>
<p> right. I mean it just is absolutely unacceptable and he has displayed</p>
<p> monumental weakness on this.</p>
<p>SALLY SARA:</p>
<p>Mr Howard thanks for joining us this morning.</p>
