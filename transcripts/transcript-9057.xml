PRIME MINISTER<br />
PAUL UMaIrZNG WITH RUSSELL POWELL, 2GB, 1OVMIR 26, 193<br />
X a 03 PROO OnLy<br />
POWELLs Prime Kinister, Paul Zeating, is on the line zow.<br />
Prime Minister, good morning.<br />
XltAIUNG ( inaudible)<br />
POWEL I'm well. Are you satisfied with Conrad Black's<br />
discussion of the whole issue in the papers this morning-ia<br />
the erald?<br />
XXATTNGi Well, look. His point about 35 percents he<br />
mentioned this. You see, to understand vhat'm happened here,<br />
Mr Black wants to get control of John Pattf ax A Sons, he wants<br />
over .50 percent of the stock. No saw thi Qvreaimhkt, I had<br />
discussions with him, and he mentioned 35 prcent. Out, Iour<br />
months later, when the Covsmaasnt considered this in a full<br />
Cabinet meeting on a submission from the Treasurer in April<br />
the Treasurer put a statemenL out saying this case has been<br />
assessed against the objective of limiting foreign involvemnt<br />
in mas-circulation newspapers and the Government's agreed to<br />
the Telegraph increasin its shareholdinj in Fairfax from just<br />
undar 15 percent to 2? percent. And a finished the press<br />
* tatwuunt by saying the Goernment will not Countenance further<br />
inoreases in the permitted level of foreign involvement in<br />
mass-circulati on nevpp&amp; Ors. So, Xr Black came, asked and<br />
received 25 perc. unt on a full Cabinet decision four months<br />
after he asked me. Now, this little piece in the paper this<br />
morning refers to the first conversation. But what today's<br />
paper also says is that Lhe Leader of the Opposition.. he said<br />
that the Opposition had not expressed a preference for any<br />
specific coiling for such ownership. In other words, Dr Howson<br />
vent in and gave him unconditional.. an unconditiunzal p-; Fto-val<br />
to go to whatever level he wished. So, before the election#<br />
what's happened is thl; Mr black's walked into me and said:<br />
' Look# I've seen the Leader of the Opposition, he said he is<br />
very relaxed and ho can take.. we can take our interest up to a<br />
hundred percent, it we wanlt. But we don't need to go to a<br />
hundred pareent bh&amp; uie 50 percent is control. go, from the<br />
opposition we're getting control, what are you prepared to give<br />
us?" Ad I saidl " Well, Australia's national interests need<br />
to be taken into account here. I don't believe that a </p>
<p>foreigner should be controlling Australia's two premier<br />
broadsheet newspapers. So I saids " We'll consider it in the<br />
appropriate way." We did, and we wont to 25 percent. Now, Dr<br />
Howson's on the radio toeday calling me a liar and everthing<br />
else. He uses the word liar ten times each day, these days,<br />
about me. But the fact of the matter is, the proof of the<br />
pudding 1s in the eating. We put a statement out after the<br />
Cabinet meeting ftour onths after this conversation and decidud<br />
nn 25 percent.<br />
POWJ Lt0 Toe*, So, despite canvassing 35 percent at that<br />
meeting, the decision's been made and that it won't be<br />
KIR TIN4Gs Exactly. Now, on the Sunday prograa ' Business<br />
sunday', a weak ago on the.. Just over a veok ago, Mr Block<br />
said this s " I wrote in xy book about Dr Hewson's posltion<br />
vhich was that this vat not an issue with him" In other<br />
vords, the control was not an issue with him. And he was, he<br />
said in agreed phraseoloqy in other words, he and Black had<br />
agreed to say this as they left the meeting " very relazed<br />
about what our level of ownershlp would be" in the event he won<br />
the elootion.<br />
POWELLa im. Well, he ( inaudible)<br />
XEATINGs In other words: " Look, I'm not going to put any<br />
silly 25 prcenL or 15 percent limits on this.. you can.. this<br />
is unconditional. You can have what you like."<br />
POWLLS Yes. He claims he didn't talk about 50 percent or<br />
one hundred percent. You're saying that it's applied in what<br />
he said, that it.. there could be total Ownership.<br />
xATrNGat Exactly. It's uneonditional, in other words, he's<br />
very relaxed, he couldn't care less. He can have the things,<br />
in other words.. you see, you've got to understand that, before<br />
an election, you've got Mr Black swannrming into town sayings<br />
' Look, you know, I'm nov the hairy-chested owner of John<br />
Fairfax Sons. Now, what are you going to do for me? Because<br />
Dr Hawson's going to let me have a, you know, unlimited control<br />
here., And I saida " Well, hang on. Their happen to be a few<br />
national interests here. And, yes, I understand4 you've<br />
difficQlt runninlg the papers at 14.9 percent and we may<br />
consider taking it to 25 which would give you control to run<br />
the business. Replace the presses And do all the things you<br />
need to do. But it's not majority as far as.. because, look, a<br />
Canadian living in London can never be an Australian."<br />
POWELL ryeah. And did you say.. did you atiuntiui also<br />
percent later? You might be disposed to support 35 percent.<br />
SBATIRMIdWell, of course, they try and push you up, these </p>
<p>feallows. And he mentioned 35, but I gave him no, no<br />
eneouxagement on that at all.<br />
POWBLL&amp; Okay. So, what he's saying In the paper this<br />
oning is wrong?<br />
IATZNOs No, what he said was, I think he said in the paper<br />
this morming that z said I'd consider 35. Well, I didn't say<br />
that. But the truth is, it Wuldn't matter what I'd said, when<br />
the Cabinet considered it, the statement said 25. And that'<br />
whera he nov stands.<br />
POWXLL, Yeah. He said.. he said, now, I've got it hezre.<br />
He saids " If at some stage after the election we wish to raise<br />
our percentage to 35 percent, if he was still Prime Ltnhister,<br />
he might be disposed to support such an application.'<br />
M TINGM Well, here it is after the election, I've seen him<br />
again a couple of weeks ago, and he is not going beyond<br />
percent. So, there's ( inaudible). can I ust make this clear<br />
to you, Russell. John Hewson now wants a ienate inquiry. But<br />
when Sanator Kernot the Libs put up those teoms of reference<br />
which saids " Question* about the Prime inister's conversation<br />
with Mr Black*. When Senator ornot put up.. changed the toam<br />
of reference to include, as vweall, questione by Dr Hewson with<br />
Mr Black, John Hewson'sa now back-sliding from appearing before<br />
the haring. Because Mr Blaok said on tho same ' Businesm<br />
Sunday' prograut ' I said I'i quite happy to appear under oath<br />
and say what each has said to me." Now, Dr Hewson doesn't want<br />
to appear because, if he has to appear under oath, ho' 11 either<br />
have to perjure himself or confirm what Mr Black ha saide<br />
that he was relaxed and had no level and regarded an<br />
unconditional, letting Telegraph newspapers buy control of John<br />
Teirtaf a Sons. you've got, you know, him now running<br />
around on your radio program he's on other radio programs<br />
this morning saying the Prime Minister is a liar, he's got<br />
this to answer for. He won't even appear before the committee.<br />
He's got nov Senator Aleton, his fellow in the Senate, trying<br />
to remove the term of reference to him. And then he's saying<br />
that I should appear.<br />
POWELL: Yeah. Well, as I remember, he told me this<br />
morning that he would be willing to appear but said that he<br />
wasn't the target of it.<br />
XRATIHMO Yea, that's code for saying' " If I'm mentioned in<br />
the terms of reference, I von't be there.' Because vhat that<br />
means is, when he's asked about these things, he's under oath,<br />
and he's going to have to say or perjure himself that he<br />
was prepared to shovel control of John Fairfax Sons to a<br />
foreigner. </p>
<p>POWELLI Well, he...<br />
xUTITNGs And, at the same time, attacking me. So, at a<br />
time.. see, Russell, May I make this point to you. Since late<br />
last year Dr Howson was striding around Sydney arrogantly, like<br />
the sort of toast of the business scene, about to becoame Prime<br />
Minister. You know, he vas ushering people into his office<br />
like he was a sort of king of the castle. And in came Xr<br />
Black, you know: " What can we do for you?" OWell, you know,<br />
now we run the major papers in this country, we want control of<br />
it." " Look, we're very relaxed about that, we are very relaxed<br />
about that. You can have whatever you like." Mean hile, silly<br />
me I'm only protecting the natiunal interest. When he comes<br />
and sees me, Z says " Well, hang on, whoa, whoa, whoa, there's<br />
a few interests here. You've got 14.9, yes, we understand<br />
that's a problem.<br />
POWELL Teah. Yet the point that probably re Ains<br />
unresolved is this whole issue of balanced reporting. And what<br />
is halanned reporting from your point of you, and was it going<br />
to be a trade-oft of balanced reporting for 25 percent?<br />
KEATINGs Yes, wVol, I made no deal with Mr Black<br />
( inaudible). There was no element of a deal. In other words,<br />
if it's balanced reporting. See, what happened to us, Russell,<br />
in the campaigns the Herald editorialised against the<br />
Government. In the editorial on the 12th of March IL saids<br />
" Tt's time for a change', The Age said. " Why the Coalition<br />
should win tomorrow"', the Financial Review said: " Why Hewvon<br />
should win'. In fact, the.. and I referred in the Parliament<br />
to that appalling front page, after the policy speech of the<br />
Labor Party, which was headed$ " Pork barrel Republic and a<br />
free set of steak knives, too'. I mean, it was the moat biased<br />
presentation of a front page following a major policy speech<br />
that I have ever seen. Despite that, we still let Mr Black go<br />
to 25 percent.<br />
POWZLL So, it wasn't balanced reporting, in fact...<br />
M ATINGt No.<br />
POWELLt during the campaign.<br />
XEATINGa It was the Herald's presentation of news and<br />
aditorial vent in favour of the Liberal Party.<br />
POWELL: So, it was unbalaneod and..<br />
KEATINGe Well, in my view it was. But the fact was, 48 it<br />
wasn't to the point where, I believed, it disqualified the<br />
legitimate request Black had to have enough of the stock to<br />
actually be able to run the business. </p>
<p>POWBLL; Yeah, yeah.<br />
KERATINQs3 At 14.9 percent, everybody in Jones Street,<br />
Broadway, told Mr Black to go and disappear. You know, the<br />
journalists, the managers, saying " Woll, hang on, you've only<br />
got 14.9 of the stock. It won't be long before you're out of<br />
hot., Why should we take notice of you?" So, naturally, he<br />
was sayings " I can't run the business at 14.9 percent. 0 So Z<br />
saids * Tou certainly can at 25, and that's all you need." So,<br />
this is it, now. But, I mean, look., the proof of the pudding<br />
of this will be in the eating, that is whether Dr Reveon<br />
actually apears before the Senatv co mittee he's promoted.<br />
Because, it he does, it'll become very olear that Mr Black's<br />
now three references I refer to the one in the book, the book<br />
which started all this. What he said was, t he Leader of the<br />
Opposition had already promised promisedi that, if he was<br />
elected, he would remove restraints on our ownership. Now, I<br />
act a group of journalists of John Fairfax sone not long<br />
after I met Mr Black this yas late last year, and some of the<br />
Fairfax executives.. and at that meeting I told them that Mr<br />
Black told me that John Hewion had said to him that they could<br />
take their interest as high as a hundred percent. So, it's not<br />
a matte of me saying it now...<br />
POWKINLt So, presumably they can back you up on that?<br />
BRZATINGs Exactly.<br />
POWELL: What, senior Fairfax executives and journalists?<br />
KrATINGs Exactly.<br />
POIWELLs Mike Secombe among them,<br />
KZATINGs Mike Steketee was amonget themr Rose Gittins..<br />
POWELL, K.<br />
K~ ATING: so, i nean, I said it then. Kr Black said it nov<br />
and, yet, you've got Dr Hewson saying.. he starts off an<br />
interview ' liar, liar, liar, liar, liar, liar..', he says that<br />
about fifteen times and then people says " Oh, this is<br />
serious.'" But this is part of the standard stock in trade.<br />
POWILLs Okay. Well, 3ust finally., he said yesterday that<br />
he'd slap a writ on you within an hour, if you said the kinds<br />
of things you were saying in Parliament outside of Parliament.<br />
EATINaG: Yes, but, you see, that sort of bluster goes<br />
nowhere, nowhere in public life. You can't say of a Prime<br />
Minister that he has in some way diminished his office by doing </p>
<p>6<br />
something untoward. And when the reply comes back " Well,<br />
hang on, you're going to give the company up to four times as<br />
Ach stock in this, and then accuse him, to say: " Oh, well, it<br />
he says that again I'll put a vrit on hiam." I moean, this is<br />
the sort of tactic Dr Mmwon uses. I mean...<br />
PowULt Are you threatening a writ this morning, because<br />
there's a report aroun4 that you are.. on Kerry Stokes.<br />
SATINGi NO, what Kerry Stokes said.. I mean, I don't have<br />
to deal with the elorry Stokes of this world. Hoe's 8 bit below<br />
my speed. But what he did say yesterday was, on the A. m.<br />
program, he said.. there was a question, " Conrad Black says Mr<br />
Reating has not compromised the integrity of his offaice".....<br />
now, mind you, Black did say thisa that I had not compromised<br />
the integrity of my offee...." Do you agree with that<br />
aseoement? I certainly do not., XeanAing that I had<br />
compromised the integrity of my office. What I said this<br />
morning# well, about Nr Stokes vass that if he continued in<br />
that vein, I would.. I would issue process against him.<br />
Because none of us have to put up vith him, with people like<br />
that. But the Leader of the Opposition.. I'm not in the<br />
business of Lesuing write against politicians because, I think,<br />
you've got to be able to take as well as give it.<br />
POWELLs Yeah. Well, you've dished it out in the past end,<br />
I suppose, you do have to take it.<br />
REATTINGS But the Leader of the Opposition..... well, that<br />
is it it's not of a very personal or defamatory nature, but,<br />
itf it's of a porsonal, defamatory nature I think it's a<br />
different matter. But if it's just general political issues<br />
like this you take it as it comes, But the Leader of the<br />
Opposition.. you know one of the things he said this morning on<br />
anothOt tAdio station, he said, ' The Prime Minister is a liar,<br />
he promised tax cute, he lied." The tax cute were delivered<br />
last week.<br />
POWLL; Yeah.<br />
IZATINGa Eight to ten dollars a vaak for everybody as of<br />
last Tuesday.<br />
POWLI Yeah. The tax cuts are not the issue here, are<br />
they? IZATINGs They're not# no.<br />
POWELLs OKay, Prime Kinister, thank you for your time this<br />
morning. I appreciate that. I hope we'll talk again.<br />
ZCATINGn Good. </p>
