SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER THE RT. HON. R. G.<br />
MENZIES, AT THE OPENING OF TI KODAK PLANT AT<br />
COBURG. MELBOURNE. ON FRIDAY, 15TH APRIL. 196L<br />
Sir and ladies -and gentlemen:<br />
You have been listening, so far, to the experts. What<br />
they don't know about this great enterprise and its history, is<br />
not worth learning. I am here in the humble, but necessary<br />
capacity, of a customer.<br />
I am going to say a few words, not too many, about<br />
photography, but before I do, I would like to say this, I was<br />
very glad to hear so much reference made to the firm of Baker<br />
and Rouse because when I was a small boy those names were<br />
practically as well known as Gilbert and Sullivan. Baker and<br />
Rcl; se this was a naima, or a termso familiar to people in<br />
Australia even in those days that it is hard to believe that it<br />
is so long ago.<br />
Now, Sir, I said I was a customer. I want to start<br />
off by making one or two customer's complaints. I have done a<br />
certain amount of cinematography myself as an amateur on tackle<br />
suitably obtained from the Kodak people, and over a period of<br />
years whenever I brought in a great batch of stuff from some<br />
overseas journey, I would encounter my old friend Merton of<br />
Kodak, who is sitting down there now, and he would say to me in<br />
a most amiable manner " lThose things came out quite well; how<br />
lucky you wr". Thai is the furthest I could ever got. I<br />
once took a beautiful lot of sequences, I thought, of a bull<br />
fight in Lisbon, full of colour. I thought it was very good<br />
and so did he. But you must never allow the customer to feel<br />
that he ha got the better of you. he said, " you know<br />
that is a remarkable thing; you know that shot with all that<br />
lighting was impossible!" ( Laughter) Did he go on to say,<br />
" You are a miracle-worker?" Not at all. " Hmmm, you were<br />
lucky weren't you?"'<br />
Now there is anothi,, r aspect of photography. If you<br />
were a politician like r. ysolf; if you had to sit in various<br />
interviews as much as I do; if you had to become so accustomed<br />
to these people, the pross photographers, you would know what<br />
happens. One follow comes in looking all innocent; hots got<br />
one of these little deceiving looking cameras; and ho goes<br />
click, and goes click, and goes click quite rapid fire<br />
while you oare in the middle of a conversaition. He goes away<br />
with about 30 pictures of you, sorme of then showing you scowling<br />
like mad, some of them showing you with a nost fatuous grin on<br />
your face some of then showing you looking down with intense<br />
gloom, and. others with your head so far back that they could<br />
take a study of your adenoids. Back they go to the office and<br />
they are put in stock. And when the day comes that I am<br />
popular if it ever does ( Laughter) in that particular office<br />
they bring out the best one. It makes me look as handsome as<br />
possible; nice photograph: ' Put a good one in this time;<br />
we're writing a leading article in his favour'. But most times<br />
of course it is the odd ones. Oh, dear! I've suffe3red from<br />
photography as much as any mortal man.<br />
Yet I am delighted to be here as a customer, and as<br />
somebody who has naturally an immense feeling for his own<br />
country. The name of this Company is so world famous that<br />
whenever one thinks of photography, photographic material, one<br />
naturally thinks of Kodak. That is a remarkable thing. It is<br />
not a monopoly because there are others. But if any enterprise<br />
in this century has establisheod its name as a nane of irmmense </p>
<p>2.<br />
honour and repute and quality in the fields of photography it<br />
is Kodak. That, I think, is soLuething to be proud of; something<br />
for everybody connected with it to be proud of.<br />
After all you don't become pre-eminent in this field<br />
or in any other field without producing the aoods or without<br />
having some quality. Of course this vast concern has based its<br />
development and its prestige and its power upon devoting at a<br />
time when lots of people didn't do it, lots of time and lots of<br />
skill to research. This is one of the first of the great<br />
fields of free enterprise, in which one observed many years ago<br />
a concentration upon research.<br />
So starting with research and going through<br />
production and processing, and selling, this enterprise has<br />
not only been able to provide the vital materials for the<br />
astonishing modern developments of photography in all its<br />
aspects, but it has, if I may come back to myself as a customer,<br />
provided world-wide facilities for the itinerant amateur<br />
incompetent photographer.<br />
But, Sir, there is a relationship between photography<br />
and modern life that I think one ought to glance it. After<br />
all I suppose I am getting a bit long in the tooth as I am<br />
occasionally reminded by my political opponEts, one of whom I<br />
can see beaming at me amiably from the audience. I must be<br />
because I can remember the day, as indeed many of you can, or<br />
some of you can, when to be taken to the photographer to have<br />
that cabinet size picture taken for posterity involved sitting<br />
in a chair rather rigidly and uncomfortably, and having a pair<br />
of forceps put in the back of your neck do you remember?<br />
and you backed into it. And there you were held like a v0ice,<br />
keeping you quiet enough for the slow speeds of those days to<br />
have a chance. That, of course, Sir, explains the glassy eye that<br />
you detect in our more reaent anccstors, When you see the<br />
family photographs in tie family zlbur: s it is all due to the<br />
forceps and the primitive rmaterial of that time. Now, of<br />
course, all these things have changed.<br />
But this b . siness of photography is not a : ere<br />
matter of providing somebody with a hobby, or somebody with a<br />
living, taking portrait studies in Collins Street. These are<br />
very useful undertakings, though I have never been able to<br />
secure that tremendous amount of mercy that I would wish from<br />
a photographer. Apart altogether from that, Sir, photography is now<br />
entering into almost every aspect of life. You consider how,<br />
with its trenendous developrnent in precision and speed it ns<br />
been able to come to the aid of medical work, of scientific<br />
investigation. WIhen we think of the miracles of colour<br />
photography with its enormous developments we can see how far<br />
this has come in aid, not merely of individual entertainment,<br />
but of the sciences and of advancement in many branches of<br />
knowled ge. It is not so long since a world event could happen<br />
which would come to us by telegraph or by cable, be the subject<br />
of a certain amount of letter press, and then there would be a<br />
delay for sometime before any graphic picture of the event<br />
could arrive. Isn't it amazing today to think that within a few<br />
hours, thanks to the mir. cle and precision of photography, and<br />
the great new arts of transmission, we can see the pictures,<br />
literally, of events, all round the world. This, of course, </p>
<p>adds to the vivacity of the printed sheet; it adds to our<br />
comprehension of what is goini on in the world. Because we<br />
don't all read and like reading; many of us like to look<br />
because we like looking. It is therefore the great, the<br />
tremendous art of photography xrhich is at the basis of a<br />
growing amount of knowledge of the other countries in the world.<br />
God knows we need a growing knowledge of other countries in the<br />
world, and they need it of us, because the one hope of the world<br />
is that we shall, on a basis of genuine knowledge and<br />
understanding, become tolerant of each other and live in peace<br />
with each other.<br />
Sir, wherever I have lone in the world I have been<br />
immensely struck by this fact, that the possession Df the<br />
camera is becoming almost one of the signs of a high-living<br />
standard in any country. More and more, every youngster, every<br />
young man and woman every adult, every veteran feels more<br />
and more the attraction of being able not only to see something,<br />
but to record it. It was truly said that ' journeys end in<br />
lovers' meetings'. Journeys end a great deal today in<br />
photographers' meetings. I don't know of any more remarkable<br />
way in which to refresh the memory which is at best a<br />
treacherous thing, than to have these superb records of events<br />
and of people. So, both publicly and privately this industry has<br />
merited its growth. This day today is for your Company an hour<br />
of great triumph. This is a phenomenal development, this<br />
magnificent site in this good setting, with a vista of the<br />
future that exhibits no small outlook on the future of<br />
Australia. I am delighted to be here. I would like to<br />
congratulate everybody who has had anything to do with it and I<br />
give myself the singular pleasure of declaring it open. </p>
