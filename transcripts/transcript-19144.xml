<p>Prime Minister Julia Gillard today announced that President U Thein Sein of Myanmar will visit Australia from 17 to 20 March at the invitation of the Governor-General of Australia, Ms Quentin Bryce AC CVO.</p>
<p>President Thein Sein's visit will be the first by a head of state of Myanmar since 1974. The visit comes during a period of far reaching change in Myanmar and deeper bilateral engagement in support of reform, including enhanced development cooperation and high-level ministerial contact.</p>
<p>President Thein Sein's visit is an important opportunity to forge closer ties, including cooperation to support political reform, social development and trade and investment in Myanmar.</p>
<p>The President will meet the Prime Minister in Canberra, and will also call on the Governor-General and attend a State Lunch held in his honour at Government House.  While in Australia, the President will have an opportunity to interact with Australian business leaders and Myanmar recipients of Australia Award scholarships.</p>
