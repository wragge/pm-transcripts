TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP, YARRAMUNDI VISITORS' CENTRE,<br />
CANBERRA, 19 NOVEMBER 1990<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: What do you think of Gough Whitlam's envoy,<br />
hostage envoy?<br />
PM: Well I've got nothing to add in respect of the<br />
proposed Whitlam visit to what I've said on behalf of the<br />
Government in regard to all such visits and that is that<br />
the Government doesn't embrace them or condone them for<br />
the reason which has been accepted by all governments<br />
involved in the multinational forces seeking to impose<br />
United Nations sanctions. There is common ground that<br />
any such official involvement weakens the attempt of the<br />
international community to deal with the essential issue<br />
and that is the totally unacceptable annexation of Kuwait<br />
by Iraq and the fact that any hostages are maintained by<br />
Saddam Hussein. This playing with hostages, as the<br />
leadership of Iraq is doing, is repugnant. Having said<br />
that, I repeat what I've said before that if these<br />
individual missions do in fact achieve the release of<br />
some hostages then of course for those who are released<br />
and their families we welcome that. But the governments<br />
of the nations involved in this important attempt to<br />
maintain international law and adherence to international<br />
standards will not themselves be involved in such<br />
missions. JOURNALIST: Isn't it a propaganda coup for Iraq to get<br />
Gough Whitlari to go, Prime Minister?<br />
PM: Well they obviously I mean it's perfectly clear<br />
that they arE! expressing great satisfaction in getting<br />
ex-Prime Ministers, whether it's from Japan, New Zealand,<br />
Australia, they are obviously seeking to extract<br />
political pro'paganda and mileage from it.<br />
