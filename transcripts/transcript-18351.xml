Tonight we celebrate Australia Day by celebrating those who reflect the very best of our great nation.</p>
<p>Because we are a great nation.</p>
<p>And we are a great nation because of our people.</p>
<p>That is our true wealth:</p>
<p>The 23 million people who love this country deeply, sometimes at the cost of their lives.</p>
<p>It says a lot that alongside fireworks and BBQs and all the things we will do tomorrow, we celebrate Australia Day day by choosing four individuals who reflect and inspire our nation.</p>
<p>They've been opera singers and artists.</p>
<p>Football players and scientists.</p>
<p>Our most recent recipient, Simon McKeon, is a businessman who has used his success to help others.</p>
<p>They are remarkable men and women, every one of them.</p>
<p>And they point the way to a creative, confident future for our nation.</p>
<p>If there is any quality common to all our Australians of the Year, it is courage.</p>
<p>Jessica Watson embarking on her dangerous voyage.</p>
<p>Fred Hollows restoring sight to those without hope.</p>
<p>John Farnham risking everything on a comeback.</p>
<p>Alan Stretton rebuilding a shattered city.</p>
<p>They had courage.</p>
<p>The courage to imagine a better nation and to face the future without fear.</p>
<p>We don't all have the gifts these extraordinary Australians possess.</p>
<p>But each of us in our own way  -  can share and emulate one thing: their courage.</p>
<p>Because it's not in our nature to be afraid  -  it never has been and I know it never will be.</p>
<p>So let's celebrate the great nation we are, and the even greater nation we can become together.</p>
<p>Happy Australia Day! </p>
