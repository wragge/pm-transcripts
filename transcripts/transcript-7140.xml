AUSTRALIA JAPAN RELATIONS SYMPOSIUM<br />
24 MARCH 1987 CANBERRA<br />
Your Excellency,<br />
Sir Geoffrey,<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen<br />
In my four years as Prime Minister, this is the nineth<br />
occasion on which I have spoken on Australia-Japan<br />
relations. When the contributions of my ministers are<br />
added, the number increases ten-fold.<br />
That is but one indication of the importance my Government<br />
attaches to forging closer relations between Australia and<br />
Japan. The Japanese Government, for its part, has also fre quently<br />
demonstrated its recognition of the importance of its<br />
relationship with Australia not least through its support<br />
over the years for this symposium.<br />
Together we have come a long way.<br />
Twenty five years ago Australia's top exports to Japan were<br />
wool and wheat. Today they are iron ore and coal. Japan<br />
sold mainly textiles and iron arnd steel products to<br />
Australia 25 years ago. Now its main export earners in<br />
Australia are motor vehicles and consumer electronics.<br />
Twenty five years ago, Japan was a negligible foreign<br />
investor in Australia. Today she is the third largest<br />
behind the US and Britain.<br />
And 25 years ago, it is estimated that only 2,200 Japanese<br />
tourists visited Australia, while this year an estimated<br />
220,000 tourists from Japan will enjoy the natural beauty of<br />
the Australian landscape and the friendliness of the<br />
Australian people.<br />
whenever Australia-Japan relations are discussed at symposia<br />
such as this, the two staples of discussion are the dynamism<br />
of the Pacific region and the complementarity of our two<br />
economies. </p>
<p>IFR LE-4 ' 135 j3I_: 48Pf PjRLL:-B CEP 2<br />
These two facts are the reason why the Australia-Japan<br />
relationship is on-the threshold today of a fundamental<br />
restructuring that offers huge benefits for the people of<br />
both our countries.<br />
They were certainly uppermost in my mind in may 1986 when I<br />
last visited Japan to inspect your remarkable economy and to<br />
assess ways in which Australia can work more closely with<br />
You. Let me briefly recite the salient facts.<br />
First, the proof that our region is the most dynamic<br />
economic performer in the world today is crisply summarised<br />
by this fact: two years ago the value of trans-Pacific trade<br />
surpassed that of trans-Atlantic trade for the first time.<br />
The Pacific rim is without doubt where the action is in the<br />
world economy today. China's bold modernisation program<br />
offers vast opportunities for trade and investment; South<br />
Korea and other newly industrialising countries of East Asia<br />
are rapidly moving into high-technology assembly; and the<br />
ASEAN nations too are beginning to break their commodity<br />
dependence and rekindle their enormous growth prospects.<br />
Second, within this dynamic region, the two economies of<br />
Australia and Japan are very well equipped not only to take<br />
advantage of the new markets and investment opportunities<br />
our neighbours offer. We are also moving into closer and<br />
more complementary bilateral relationships which present us<br />
with increased potential for trade and investment.<br />
Perhaps the clearest pointer to these changes is the massive<br />
realignment of our currencies over the last few years.<br />
A strongly appreciating yen has eroded the competitive edge<br />
of many of the Japanese industries such as steelmaking and<br />
aluminium smelting that formed the foundation of the<br />
country's post-war growth.<br />
The pressure for the re-location of parts of these<br />
industries offshore is enormous, and Japan's massive<br />
surpluses of irvestible capital are creating opportunities<br />
for countries of the region including Australia as sites<br />
for that inevitable relocation.<br />
At the same time, the depreciation in the Australian dollar,<br />
along with a very considerable range of internal<br />
restructuring measures, make us both a more desirable focus<br />
for foreign investment as well as a competitive and capable<br />
exporter.<br />
As I have said, the details of our mutual strengths and<br />
needs, and the challenges they present to us, have become<br />
well understood over the last few years and I do not propose<br />
to spend time this evening elaborating them before this<br />
audience. P. 3/ 9 </p>

It is nearly a year since Prime Minister Nakasone and I<br />
agreed to establish a series of investment missions between<br />
our two countries.<br />
An Australian mission visited Japan in November 1986 and we<br />
were honored last February to play host to a distinguished<br />
and very large mission of Japanese businessmen.<br />
Accordingly I consider I should give you my perspective this<br />
evening on how Australia and Japan have actually managed to<br />
meet these challenges and on the progress we are making in<br />
building the next stage of our relationship.<br />
Probably the most promising achievement has been the<br />
continuing acceptance by Japanese policy makers of the<br />
thrust of the Maekawa Report.<br />
it is a very great honor, and a very positive omen for the<br />
success of the symposivm, that the chairman of the group<br />
responsible for that report, Mr Haruo Maekawa, is in<br />
Canberra and will address you tomorrow.<br />
When it was released in 1986, the Maekawa Report was<br />
welcomed by the Australian government. It remains in our<br />
view a valuable blueprint for the essential task of economic<br />
restructuring which lies ahead of the Japanese nation, and<br />
it has been heartening to see that the maekawa message<br />
is being heard and understood in Japan.<br />
A second and related development in our relationship has<br />
been the significant upgrading by Australia of our efforts<br />
to seek an end to the crazy spread of protectionism which<br />
threatens to stall world trade.<br />
At Davos in January I proposed a method of attacking<br />
protectionism as it affected agricultural trade. This<br />
message was specially directed at the the European<br />
Community and Japan who between them share the greatest<br />
responsibility for the corruption of agricultural trade.<br />
I recognise of course that the response to the Maekawa<br />
Report has demonstrated a growing awareness within Japan of<br />
the need to liberalise Japanese agricultural policies.<br />
I recognise too that Japan is the world's largest<br />
agricultural importer, and that it has the lowest<br />
self-sufficiency ratio amongst the major industrialised<br />
countries.<br />
Nevertheless, Japanese consumers are paying a very high<br />
price for domestic protection and this policy continues to<br />
have very substantial adverse implications for other<br />
agricultural exporters.<br />
I would be less than frank with you if I didn't say that we<br />
want Japan to press ahead resolutely in opening its domestic<br />
market to imports.<br />

Let me in this context acknowledge that the Japanese<br />
Government's recent decisions which' should allow greater<br />
import penetration for Australian coal are an optimistic<br />
sign for the future. While Japan's coal mining industry is<br />
undergoing painful adjustment problems, we are seeing an<br />
encouraging application of the principle of enlightened self<br />
interest in enhancing the overall prosperity of the Japanese<br />
people.<br />
AS Japan continues to address itself to the new<br />
circumstances in which it finds itself, with the strength of<br />
its currency and the huge pool of investible surpluses it<br />
has accumulated, we will I hope see Japan continue to apply<br />
that principle.<br />
A third development in our relationship has been the<br />
continued discovery of new investment projects as tangible<br />
products of the complementary and friendly relations between<br />
our two countries.<br />
The investment missions themselves have produced some<br />
promising proposals and I urge those involved to pursue them<br />
actively.<br />
Nowhere is our complementarity more evident than in basic<br />
metal production. While Japanese basic metal production has<br />
been contracting slowly for more than a decade, Australia<br />
has developed and retained a strong comparative advantage in<br />
these industries. As Japanese exports of steel and<br />
non-ferrous metals lose their competitiveness, Australia<br />
will be well positioned to step into the breach in supplying<br />
the needs of the Asia/ Pacific region and countries further<br />
afield.<br />
Another emerging export-oriented industry in Australia is<br />
the production of auto parts and accessories. Mitsubishi<br />
Australia's achievement in exporting 26,000 cylinder heads<br />
per month to Japan is an example of the new face of trade<br />
and investment co-operation between Australia and Japan.<br />
I am pleased to see that this investment co-operation is not<br />
being confined to export-oriented manufacturing industries<br />
but is being extended into traded services and hotel/ resort<br />
development. One of the exciting ideas to arise in the context of the<br />
latest investment mission is a proposal that the Kyoto<br />
Institute of Science and Technology establish a private<br />
Technical College and Technology Exchange in Sydney. This<br />
$ 100 million investment has the potential to establish a<br />
basis for Japan-Australia co-operation in knowledge<br />
intensive industrial sectors.<br />
The detailed proposal is being finalised and will be subject<br />
in part to decision by the NSW Government. However I point<br />
to it as one kind of project which we should be looking to<br />
in building our relationship. As far as the Commonwealth is<br />
concerned, we will ensure that every avenue is pursued in<br />
exploring this project. P. 5/ 9 </p>
<p>PPR 24 ' 95 03: 50PM Pf~ RLLIB CEP P. 6/ 9<br />
Reviewing our relationship, we therefore fIinad irrefutable<br />
evidence that we are on the right path and that real<br />
progress in being made.<br />
our two governments have a responsibility to approach the<br />
task of restructuring in a positive fashion and to set about<br />
the task of removing the impediments to change.<br />
For Australia's part, I can assure you of our growing<br />
awareness of the need for a new industrial structure. With<br />
that, there is a new determination within both the business<br />
community and the workforce to achieve it.<br />
I can also assure you that we will continue to welcome<br />
foreign investment, including Japanese investment, in<br />
Australia. My Government's proudest achievement has been that, from day<br />
one in office, we have sought to foster awareness of this<br />
need for change and to remove many of the obstacles in the<br />
path to change including some unnecessary obstacles. to<br />
foreign investment.<br />
We have set in place a program of policy changes designed to<br />
make Australian industry more competitive, more outward<br />
looking, more vibrant and more resilient.<br />
we established an unprecedented Accord with the trade union<br />
movement which, thanks to the magnificent response of<br />
Australian workers in moderating wage claims, has allowed<br />
real unit labour costs to fall by more than 6 per cent.<br />
This has helped create three quarters of a million jobs, the<br />
vast bulk of them in the private sector. While we have had<br />
to slow the economy down in the last year, the reduction in<br />
labour costs has been sufficient to allow continued job<br />
expansion 131,000 new jobs and a recent fall in the<br />
unemployment rate.<br />
And there is yet another critical dimension to the Accord<br />
which has been acknowledged by many Japanese observers of<br />
Australia including the Japanese Prime Minister, Mr Nakasone<br />
and the head of the recent investment mission, Mr Amaya:<br />
the rate of industrial disputation in this country has been<br />
more than halved.<br />
That is a very gratifying achievement and one which ranks<br />
Australia highly by international standards in reducing<br />
industrial disputation. Of 19 OECD countries for which<br />
figures are available, only nine experienced a decline in<br />
working days lost due to industrial disputes between 1982<br />
and 1984 and only four experienced a decline greater than<br />
Australia's.<br />
As pleasing as those figures are in their own right, they<br />
tell a story that augurs well for the future of Australian<br />
industry. For with the large depreciation of the Australian<br />
dollar, matched by the wage restraint exercised by the<br />

6<br />
workforce, Australian industry is now more internationally<br />
competitive than in at least two decades.<br />
Such is the commitment of the trade union movement to the<br />
establishment and expansion of export industries that its<br />
leadership has assured the Government of its willingness to<br />
facilitate new investment in Australia. Trade unions are<br />
willing to have consultations with potential investors to<br />
explore a basis for the necessary co-operation between<br />
employer and the workforce in prospective projects.<br />
This is an opportunity which potential investors should be<br />
quick to accept. Australia's reputation as a reliable<br />
supplier was somewhat tarnished through the 1970s and early<br />
l980s. But today, steady progress is being made through our<br />
co-operative approach with the trade union movement in<br />
assuring our trading partners of our renewed reliability.<br />
My Government's cooperative and innovative approach to wages<br />
policy has been coupled with our efforts to improve the<br />
productivity of the Australian economy. At my request,<br />
trade unions and business are currently engaged in an<br />
examination of ways of eliminating outdated work and<br />
management practices. Productivity has, we recognise, been<br />
hampered in the past by these restrictive practices.<br />
Today there is a growing recognition that we can only earn<br />
durable prosperity if we improve productivity through<br />
greater efficiency and flexibility in our work places.<br />
My Government has also deregulated the financial system in<br />
Australia, allowing the Australian dollar to find its<br />
natural level, allowing the entry of foreign banks, and<br />
easing exchange controls. This has increased the<br />
competitive supply of financial capital to investors.<br />
similarly, we have gradually reduced protection of<br />
Australian industry by laying out sectoral plans for the<br />
steel, motor vehicle, shipbuilding, chemicals and plastics,<br />
heavy engineering, and textiles, clothing and footwear<br />
industries.<br />
Our commitment to these measures demonstrates that we are<br />
not asking of others reforms which we are -unwilling to<br />
implement ourselves.<br />
Lower protection enhances the competitiveness of Australian<br />
industry, by lowering its cost structure and through its<br />
effect on the exchange rate.<br />
The protectionist ethos fostered by successive conservative<br />
Governments over some three decades now is virtually gone.<br />
Australian business for the most part now rejects the<br />
nostrums of the protectionist school, as do Australian<br />
workers. They know, through bitter experience, that there<br />
is no future in it; our future lies in efficient, outward<br />
looking industries. P. 7/ 9 </p>
<p>.7<br />
These are challenging times for Australian businessmen and<br />
workers: never before in the post-war era has there been<br />
such a stable policy framework for the encouragement of<br />
export-oriented manufacturing and service industries.<br />
No longer are investment opportunities confined to a small,<br />
protected domestic market.<br />
No longer do our industries have to endure the severe<br />
penalties of rising real unit labour costs and an<br />
over-valued exchange rate.<br />
while this fundamental re-orientation of the business psyche<br />
must, by its nature, be a long process, it is heartening to<br />
see the response already beginning to show through.<br />
Our trade figures over the last few months are telling us<br />
that many Australian manufacturers are beginning genuinely<br />
to expand into overseas markets. New, export-oriented<br />
projects are coming on stream. Manufactured exports have<br />
increased by nearly a third so far this financial year over.<br />
the same period last year.<br />
Having learned the lesson that it is not in our self<br />
interest to sustain a protected, insulated and highly<br />
regulated industrial structure, we in Australia look forward<br />
to working with Japan in reaping the rewards of less<br />
restrained trade and investment flows.<br />
And we do this, acutely aware of and highly receptive to the<br />
opportunities for new investment to satisfy the changing<br />
demands of our dynamic regional market.<br />
it must be clearly understood that my Government welcomes<br />
Japanese investment in Australia and sees great benefit to<br />
the people of both our countries from it.<br />
To help achieve this, we have liberalised Foreign investment<br />
Review Board procedures.<br />
Each year the Government receives a large number of<br />
applications from Japanese investors to establish projects<br />
in Australia. Virtually all of those applications are<br />
approved. it is only on the rarest of occasions, such as<br />
the recent decision on the Shelburne Blay sand mining<br />
proposal, that an application has to be rejected on national<br />
interest grounds.<br />
in the case of Shelburne Bay the national interest grounds<br />
related to the adverse impact the project would have had on<br />
the environment. our decision to oppose the project<br />
proceeding would have been the same had it been wholly<br />
domestically owned. The decision in no way weakens the<br />
Government's commitment to encourage Japanese investment in<br />
Aus t rali a.<br />

The Government is aware of Japanese concerns over the<br />
question of entry by businessmen for temporary residence.<br />
Several steps have been taken in the past few years to<br />
facilitate this entry. We know, however, that Japanese<br />
business is still not satisfied with Australian procedures.<br />
The Government is now looking at means of further<br />
streamlining policy and procedures relating to entry for<br />
temporary residence to allow companies more effectively to<br />
place executives in their Australian operations. we will be<br />
taking decisions on this question in the near future.<br />
Japan's role in the celebration of our Bicentenary is a<br />
particularly pleasing example of the warmth of<br />
Australia/ Japan relations. Among a number of Japanese<br />
contributions to the Bicentenary, one stands out for special<br />
mention: the Japanese Government's considerable involvement<br />
in the Science and Technology Centre now being built in the<br />
heart of Canberra's Parliamentary Triangle.<br />
Australia and Japan are partners in the development of this<br />
imaginative joint project, which will serve to educate,<br />
entertain and inform Australians and visitors to Australia<br />
about present and future applications of science and<br />
technology. This Centre will stand as a significant and<br />
lasting reminder of the Bicentenary and of the strength and<br />
closeness of relations between Australia and Japan. I would<br />
be remiss if I failed to take this opportunity to<br />
acknowledge Japan's generosity and vision in making this<br />
contribution. Finally let me make a comment about tourism. The Australian<br />
Tourist Commission expects two million tourist arrivals by<br />
1988. Judging from current arrival figures this target is<br />
well within reach. The official estimates are for 220,000<br />
Japanese tourists to visit Australia in 1987, an increase of<br />
105 per cent on arrivals in 1985.<br />
These tourists play an important part in the creation of a<br />
very healthy Australian tourist industry, and we welcome<br />
them for that reason.<br />
However we welcome them too as friends, as honoured guests<br />
sharing the delights of the Australian lifestyle and<br />
landscape. it is my belief that these visits, reciprocated<br />
as they are by Australian pleasure and business travel to<br />
Japan, symbolise the closeness and friendliness of the<br />
relationship between our two nations.<br />
Conferences such as this play an important role in building<br />
a stronger relationship between our two countries. Your<br />
success as you tackle the challenging issues on your agenda<br />
will have a beneficial impact on both Japanese and<br />
Australian decision makers engaged in the all-important task<br />
of enhancing our mutual prosperity and building our shared<br />
future.<br />
