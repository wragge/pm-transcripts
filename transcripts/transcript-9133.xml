TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH JOHN SHOVELAN, ABC RADIO, " AM" PROGRAM,<br />
FRIDAY, 25 FEBRUARY 1994<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
PM: We have come a long way with COAG the Council of Australian<br />
Governments in just a short period of time. We have seen a number<br />
o1 -substantial success stories in the national arrangements for<br />
technical and further education with the National Training Authority;<br />
we've seen a declaration to do something very radical with electricity,<br />
so I am hopeful that that same spirit will continue because it is now up<br />
to the commonwealth and the states to move along change in the<br />
government business enterprise area.<br />
JS: Well, are the states still adamant that a national competition policy is<br />
going to cost them a lot of money?<br />
PM: It is in every states interests to see reform, I think, in their own<br />
Interests not just something which the Commonwealth is seeking to<br />
manage, in a sense against their interests or against their wishes. We<br />
must have a competitive economy in the private sector, in the public<br />
sector and this kind of change will mean that their states are more<br />
competitive therefore business succeeds Is more likely to succeed;<br />
growth will be more obvious and therefore the proceeds and their<br />
budgets will become more bountiful. The more supple are the<br />
economies of each of the states, the more likely they will have healthy<br />
budgets.<br />
JS: But they seem more concerned about the short term don't they, at least<br />
going into the meeting?<br />
PM: I wouldn't underestimate people. I think there is a lot of value amongst<br />
them In terms of knowing what is good for their states and good for the<br />
country.<br />
JS: What are you offering the states in return for adopting your idea or the<br />
Hilmer Report on a competition policy for Australia? </p>
<p>T2EL.: Feb. 94 10: 30 No. 010 P. 02/ 04<br />
2<br />
PM: In a sense it is not just a Commonwealth idea, It is a general thing that<br />
the nation must do. We have now been moving towards a much more<br />
competitive country over the last ten years.<br />
JS: But you have got to sell it to them don't you? There are a few Premiers<br />
there that are a bit reluctant aren't they?<br />
PM: It is a repo rt which has the support of the business community, of the<br />
major business organisations and one would have thought that most<br />
Premiers would see their states interest running parallel to those<br />
business interests in terms of the private economy. So, It shouldn't be<br />
a very radical proposition for a meeting of Heads of Government to<br />
adopt a policy on enhanced competition.<br />
JS: H-ow do you read Premier Richard Court's mood? I understand he has<br />
released a forty page audit of what he calls " a Commonwealth power<br />
grab"?<br />
PM: I don't think he could construe a move towards higher levels of national<br />
efficiency in any way I mean, how could it In any way be a<br />
commonwealth grab so-called. it is simply making the state of<br />
Western Australia as the other states as In the other states more<br />
efficient. That Is, making the government business enterprises more<br />
efficient. It is something for them, not for the Commonwealth.<br />
JS: Do you believe your attitude towards COAG has changed a great deal<br />
since the days when you were a back bencher? For example, when<br />
you campaigned very strongly against the idea of a fixed share of<br />
revenue for the states?<br />
PM: I have always said that uniform taxation is the glue that holds the<br />
federation together. That is a view I have, I do not believe that six<br />
states with their own taxing powers will do anything but develop six<br />
separate economies In this country. That can't be good for any of us,<br />
so I have never compromised on that view. But, that Is not to say I<br />
don't believe that the states shouldn't be properly resourced and that<br />
we ought to develop, that is, a co-operative culture together in these<br />
other matters. That is, In service delivery in program delivery, in the<br />
efficiency of government business enterprises these are all things of<br />
common and mutual benefit.<br />
JS: That is a hump though that you have to get over with a few of the<br />
Premiers Isn't It?<br />
PM: It hasn't been at the last couple of meetings.<br />
JS: But coming into this one there has been, I think, Premier Goss,<br />
Premier Fahey. TEL </p>

PM: But there is a general assumption that Premiers are not into good<br />
works and deeds. I just don't think that is true,<br />
JS: This time around it Is five Liberal Premiers, I think it is, and Premier<br />
Goss, how does the mechanics differ, the dynamics differ given the<br />
party structure?<br />
PM: I do not think the party denominations has made any difference over<br />
time. I have had more arguments with Labor Premiers than I have ever<br />
had with Coalition Premiers.<br />
JS: Well, that's one of the Ironies isn't it'? I mean, there is a strong<br />
suggestion that Jeff Kennett is probably your biggest ally in there.<br />
PM: I have had arguments over they have been basically financial ones,<br />
but where these are about micro-economic change and program<br />
delivery, they are different kinds of issues. But I think, from my point of<br />
view, you take people as you find them and most people in public life.<br />
are well motivated towards change and doing sensible and reasonable<br />
things.<br />
JS: It Is Important for you that the meeting is successful because there is a<br />
perception around that the government has become politically bogged<br />
down by the ' sports rorts' affair. That is fair enough isn't? That is a fair<br />
enough perception for people to take out of what has been going on<br />
over the recent weeks?<br />
PM: I don't think it is, but this is a classic Canberra Press Gall ery story.<br />
Out there in the country in the broad, I just don't think too many people<br />
have ( switched) onto the so-called ' sports rorts' affair which Is about<br />
what in the end? About giving grants to amateur sporting clubs who<br />
will never have the financial resources themselves to put in a netball<br />
field -or a basketball facility or what ever it might be.<br />
JS: Do you accept though that it is causing some problems for you?<br />
PM: It is causing us some problems, yes, it is. But again, let's see where<br />
the value is. The value is In the pick up in the economy, which Is now<br />
very obvious; it is in changes of the kind that we will be considering at<br />
the Council of Australian Governments; it is in the pick up in<br />
employment. That Is where the value is and I think the public focus on<br />
value and they let a lot of the political static go over their shoulders.<br />
JS: Yesterday the public galler applauded and John Howard thinks the<br />
public gallery was actually applauding him. Who do you think they<br />
were applauding? </p>

PM: Look, it is very hard to decipher these things at the time. The fact is,<br />
the leader of the Opposition made a very poor speech and his<br />
backbench was embarrassed as was his front bench and they decided<br />
that the story should be parliamentary hi jinx, parliamentary uproar,<br />
rather than the story which would have otherwise been written entirely,<br />
though of course it's been said, in the commentary over night, that<br />
John Hewson had an opportunity to land some punches and couldn't<br />
even do it on this. That was what it was really all about.<br />
