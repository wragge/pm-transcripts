<p>E&amp;OE..................</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr President, how do you feel about a free trade agreement with Australia?</p>
<p>PRESIDENT BUSH:</p>
<p>We';ve had a good discussion about it.  </p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Progress, Sir?</p>
<p>PRESIDENT BUSH:</p>
<p>I think we';ve made some good progress.  You bet.  I appreciate the Prime Minister being here.  Australia is a great friend of the United States and it';s an honour to welcome him and the delegation here.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>.  this year..</p>
<p>PRESIDENT BUSH:</p>
<p>We';re making good progress.  He';s certainly making a good case.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>If you had to choose between education and your tax cuts, which would you choose?</p>
<p>PRESIDENT BUSH:</p>
<p>I';m going to Florida today to talk about education.</p>
<p>I hope the Australian press is kinder to you than the American press is to me!!</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Now have you heard that Dennis? </p>
<p>SHANAHAN :</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Just listen to the man.  He speaks great common sense!</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, how have you found the discussions so far with Mr Bush?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Very good.  We are very close friends.  We covered just about everything you could cover in the time.  We are going to continue over lunch to talk about some of the regional issues and it is a great opportunity to reinforce what a deep friendship it is and the President and I have a great similarity of views on many issues and it';s a great experience to be able to exchange them with somebody who has the views he does.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Have you provided an update on the HMAS Manoora at all?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Haven';t discussed it.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr President do you congratulate Lleyton Hewitt for winning the US Open?</p>
<p>PRESIDENT BUSH:</p>
<p>Yeah I do.  Man, you are talking about a guy who can play tennis.  He was ..clearly tennis is one of Australia';s best exports.  And by the way now that you are here, I do want to say hello to my old friend John Newcombe.  I knew him years ago.  He represents the best of Australia.  And by the way, we get along well because if there is any place that is like Texas, it';s Australia.  That';s a high compliment, I want you to know!</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr President, do you see a role for Australia in the development of your missile defence treaty?</p>
<p>PRESIDENT BUSH:</p>
<p>I do.  The close allies will have close consultation and I look forward to the Prime Minister';s continuing advice.  We';ve had a great discussion about the Far East and his advice is very valuable for our foreign policy.  There';s nothing like a friend who will tell the truth.</p>
