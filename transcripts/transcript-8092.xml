Jim Waley: At best this week's instant opinion polls showed a<br />
country evenly divided over Australia's ihvolvement in the<br />
Persian Gulf blockade. And though, when they finally get to the<br />
Gulf our frigates will not fire on. or board vessels trying to run<br />
the blockade, doubts were raised over the suitability of the<br />
vessels for their mission, whose finger would ultimately be 6n<br />
the trigger and over the wisdom of the Prime Minister's<br />
dispatching the warships without discussion in Cabinet or<br />
Parliament. Mr Hawke is in our studio this morning. Here to<br />
talk with him are Alan Ramsay of the ' Sydney Morning Herald and<br />
Sunday's political editor, Laurie Oakes.<br />
LAURIE OAKES: Prime Minister, welcome. As you have heard there<br />
they have started shootirg in the Gulf now. An American ship has<br />
fired across the bows of an Iraqi vessel. Is there any way of<br />
avoiding war now or is it an unstoppable slide?<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAWKE: Well I hope it can -be avoided, Laurie.<br />
I have had reason to say before that you have a certain amount<br />
of' difficulty in prediction and analysis when you are dealing<br />
with a leader who, on the record of his actions including in<br />
regard to his own people, often seems not to act on a rational<br />
basis. But any logical assessment by the leadership of Iraq at<br />
this time must point to the conclusion that the best interests-"<br />
of the Iraqi people would be served by the withdrawal of their<br />
forces from Kuwait. And I add to that, as I have always, if the<br />
leadership of Iraq believes that they have legitimate causes of<br />
grievance with its neighbour, Kuwait, then there are available<br />
mechanisms for the peaceful pursuit of those issues.<br />
LAURIE OAKES: The latest Iraqi statements about foreigners in </p>
<p>2<br />
Iraq and Kuwait make it clear now that they are hostages. What<br />
is your attitude to the latest statement that they will be used<br />
as human shields protecting military installations?<br />
LAURIE OAKES: It's a totally despicable action and,.-of course,<br />
littered with hypocrisy. If you look at the actual statement you<br />
can gather the hypocrisy of it because they talk about what is<br />
being-done by others as ' being in violation of all the norms of<br />
international law and human conduct among nations'. What they<br />
have done, of course, is unacceptable by any standards.<br />
LAURIE OAKES: What is your attitude to the Australians who are<br />
in this position? Would you contemplate a deal-to get them out?<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAWKE: You can't deal in this situation. I feel,<br />
of course, as I have from the beginning enormous concern for the<br />
welfare of these people and we have kept up, both through our own<br />
diplomatic missions and through the availability of the Britigh<br />
resources in Kuwait where we are not diplomatically represented,<br />
a constant pressure upon the Iraqi authorities to try and ensure<br />
as far as we can the Well-being of our citizens.<br />
LAURIE OAKES: Would we support any military effort at the<br />
moment? PRIME MINISTER HAWKE: I don't think it' is appropriate for me to<br />
speculate on what may or -may not happen in that area other than<br />
to say this, of course, Laurie, it is a legitimate question. We<br />
would be discussing appropriate responses with all our friends,<br />
obviously including the United State s and the British who have<br />
the major number of people concern ed.<br />
ALAN RAMSAY: Prime Minister, now that the shooting-has actually<br />
started in the Gulf, will Cabinet automatically review the role<br />
of our ships when they get there or do we have to wait----<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAWKE: What we have said, Alan, on that is this.<br />
We have laid * down a role at this point. There are two things--*<br />
that are now happening in consequence of ' that. Our own defence<br />
people, particularly Navy, are examining with others the<br />
appropriate rules of engagement. But the second thing that is<br />
happening is that in this next week we understand there will be<br />
discussions among representatives of all those nations with<br />
forces going to the area to get the best sort of coordination </p>
<p>that is possible, the most effective coordination. What we said<br />
in the Cabinet when we discussed this matter last week was that<br />
if, out of the developments in the area and these discussions<br />
that we are having the sort that I referred to it becomes<br />
apparent that there is a case for any lifting of the degree of<br />
commitment we have made then that will be considered by and<br />
decided by Cabinet.<br />
ALAN RAMSAY: It is a fortnight before the ships get there. The<br />
role in fact could change before they do get there, given what<br />
you have said.<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAWKE: It could. This is n6t the first time I<br />
have said it. It could change., I hope it doesn't. In fact my<br />
hope is that between now and th. e time that the ships arrive,<br />
Alan, that good sense will have prevailed and there won't be a<br />
need for any presence.<br />
ALAN RAMSAY: Can I ask you why did you wait for a call from the<br />
President before announcing the commitment given essentially that<br />
you and a few of your colleagues had made the decision thel day<br />
before? PRIME MINISTER HAWKE: I thought it was appropriate to have a<br />
discussion with the President. There wasn't any-need to announce<br />
it before that and the discussions that had taken place had been<br />
at diplomatic and military level. It seemed appropriate to<br />
culminate those discussions in a discussion between the President<br />
of the United States and myself-There wasn't any pressure to<br />
do it before that. That seemed the appropriate course of action.<br />
LAURIE OAKES: But you are now getting protesters saying you are<br />
a lap dog of the Americans. Didn't you, in a sense, ask for that<br />
by your handling of it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAWKE: No. It doesn't matter what you do you.<br />
would have had that sort of mindless observation. If in this job'<br />
you conducted yourself in terms of what sort of mindless<br />
observation will you get, what do I do to avoid that well then<br />
you can't conduct affairs that way. I know that what I did was<br />
right. I know that I had the sense of my Cabinet's feeling. I<br />
knew that the Cabinet would be supportive and that, in the event,<br />
was what happened. There was no dissent within Cabinet. </p>
<p>ALAN RAMSAY: The point Prime Minister surely is that you did it.<br />
Not your Cabinet. And given that you had had at least three days<br />
warning because of the talks going on over-diplomatic channels,<br />
surely there was time to call a full Cabinet before you made the<br />
decision? You should involve the full Government in this.<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAWKE: I know that you have got your position,<br />
Alan, -so just calm down. I am saying that your observation that<br />
I did it is not an accurate statement of the position. I had<br />
discussions with a number of my colleagues. I also had the<br />
benefit of a previous Cabinet meeting when the, Iraq situation<br />
came before us in terms of a decision ablout following the<br />
sanctions route.<br />
ALAN RAMSAY: Military options were not canvassed at that Ca binet<br />
meeting. PRIME MINISTER HAWKE: Laurie, I am here to answer question..<br />
I am not here to have an argument with a man parading his<br />
prejudices. Let me finish my answer. I am saying that I had had<br />
the opportunity of'* a d iscussion with all my Cabinet colleapues<br />
about the Iraqi situation. I had a sense of their feeling. I<br />
had had the discussion following that with a number of relevant<br />
Ministers. I knew what the view of my Cabinet would be and my<br />
knowledge of that was con-firmed by the fact that when we went to<br />
the Cabinet there was no dissent from what I had done.<br />
LAURIE OAKES: Prime Minister, how well prepared are our sailors<br />
and our ships for what awaits theml in the Gulf? The reason I ask<br />
that is I have a copy of a letter, that has been faxed to you by<br />
the fiancee of one of those sailors and she says quite bluntly<br />
that the ship is not capable of defending itself effectively.<br />
Is that true?<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAWKE: No, that is not true. Let me say these.<br />
things which I think are relevant. Firstly, ., and most.<br />
importantly, Australians are entitled to be proud of and<br />
confident in the capacities of the Royal Australian Navy. They<br />
have a history and a tradition and a current practice of<br />
competence. In regard to the ships themselves this is the<br />
equipment they have. They have, firstly, standard and harpoon<br />
missiles which can destroy air and surface targets at long range; </p>
<p>they have a 76 millimetre gun for their own defence; they have<br />
a rapid firing what is referred to as close in weapon which can<br />
latch on to the missiles launched at them like the Exocet; and<br />
they have electronic equipment to warn of the approach of<br />
missiles and decoy systems to deal with that. The further point<br />
to make is that these are our most modern vessels and there is<br />
some 50 equivalent FFGs in the United States Navy. There is a<br />
comparability always.<br />
LAURIE OAKES: Sure. But this woman, presumably, is reflecting<br />
the views of her fiancee who is on the Adelaide. If I could read<br />
you a little bit of what she writes. You presumably have got<br />
this letter in your office. But she says that these men have not<br />
had the necessary training to cope with potential dangers they<br />
may encounter. Add to that the fact that our ships are not<br />
capable of defending and attacking and you have a fairly lethai<br />
combination. She also says that it seems to be a death sentence<br />
for those sailing for the Middle East and she wonders how you,<br />
as a father, would feel if your son was on the ship.<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAWKE: I'll just ask you a very simple question.<br />
It makes good television to read the letter from the fiancee and<br />
I feel for her and her concerns. But as' Prime Minister I ask you<br />
a very direct question: ' Would you be moved to judgment by the<br />
letter of a fiancee or by the best advice that comes from your<br />
professional people in the Navy?<br />
LAURIE OAKES: I would be conce-rned if I thought the sailors<br />
S thought that they were in for a death sentence.<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAWKE: All I can say is that I didn't dodge the<br />
sailors. I went and farewelled them. I moved among them as a<br />
matter of record. And all I can say is that I found amongst the<br />
sailors and their officers these feelings and may I say that<br />
I was very glad to find that there wasn't a mad jingoism to get<br />
there and get them attitude. I wouldn't have like to have seen<br />
that. There was a degree of apprehension which is what you would<br />
expect and, in a sense, what you would hope. But over and above<br />
all that, there was a feeling of commitment and of pride and of<br />
confidence. ALAN RAMSAY: Prime Minister, Iraq's announcement about the </p>
<p>hostages does raise the stakes. If George Bush decides to go<br />
into Kuwait or into Iraq, do we support him?<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAWKE: What I have said in answer to a previous<br />
question holds. I am not going to speculate in advance as to<br />
what the position of Australia will be or how we will conduct<br />
ourselves and I don't think you really expect that I would. But,<br />
with my colleagues, we will make the decisions which we think are<br />
in the best interests of this country and we will certainly,<br />
within that parameter, be conscious of what you rightly referred<br />
to as the upping of the stakes and the putting in very<br />
considerable danger the lives of Australian citizens.<br />
LAURIE OAKES: Prime Minister, the. Middle East crisis has obvious<br />
implications for Tuesday's Budget. To what extent did the<br />
Government have to do a re-write? Did it have to revised its<br />
forecasts? PRIME MINISTER HAWKE: That is being done. I can't give you the<br />
details of it but in net terms, because Australia is a net energy<br />
exporter, increases in prices in net terms should benefit<br />
Australia. YdU are quite right it involves the re-writing of<br />
some of the assumptions about prices and so on.<br />
LAURIE OAKES: And inflation, I guess. You were predicting a 6<br />
per cent inflation rate this year. Is that now not realistic?<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAWKE: It is too early to predict the outcome.<br />
You have got to make an assumption about how. long the crisis is<br />
going to last. Secondly, what are the other OPEC and non-OPEC<br />
countries going to do about production. There are only four<br />
million barrels a day to make up. You could do that easily by<br />
a million barrels a day rundown of the record levels of stocks<br />
and by an increase of production on the part of others. So,<br />
there are so many assumptions that you have got to make. I would-',<br />
hope, of course, in line with all I have said that we are not<br />
going to be looking at a long period of crisis. If that is so,<br />
then the volatility of prices shows that you could relatively<br />
quickly get back. What happened immediately before the crisis<br />
was that it was just under $ US20 a barrel these are in US<br />
dollars of course and it shot up to $ US30, went back to $ US24 </p>
<p>and it is now about $ US27. It is too early to predict for a<br />
whole financial year.<br />
LAURIE OAKES: What about defence spending,'-Prime Minister? It<br />
will look a bit silly in the present climate to have another cut<br />
back won't it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAWKE: The obvious point is that nothing we will<br />
do will diminish our capacity to sustain our commitment in the<br />
region. LAURIE OAKES: So an increase in defence spending in real terms?<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAWKE: You wait and see to the Budget. What is<br />
the important . thing to Australians is the a'nswer I have just<br />
given. That no Budget decision ~ will be allowed to stand in the<br />
way of ensuring we meet properly . and adequately the commi tment<br />
that we have made.<br />
ALAN RAMSAY: Prime Minister, the accord. ACTU leaders say thi-t<br />
if rising oil prices do feed into inflation that they would<br />
expect a wage increase.<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAWK-E: The accord, Alan, as you know, -1 is<br />
calculated to try and give at least a maintenance of real<br />
income/ outcome'. They will obviously want to take that into<br />
account but this is a matter for discussion at the time. I don't<br />
avoid the thrust of what~ you are putting there.<br />
ALAN RAMSAY: It is a problem.<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAWKE: It's a problem. If the prices go up more<br />
than we expected prior to the event then that is something that<br />
is going to affect us not only in regard to the accord but the<br />
whole calculus of this financial year.<br />
LAURIE OAKES: Unions have to accept there is sacrifice demanded,<br />
don't they, in this crisis?<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAWKE: Everyone has to and I think you will see-.<br />
that the Budget, quite apart from the question of' the Gulf<br />
crisis, is one which is directed, Laurie ' and Alan, to trying to<br />
shape for Australia the sort of position we need to have to meet<br />
the challenges of the present time and the period ahead of us.<br />
Now there is a new element in that challenge that will have to<br />
be taken into account by everyone including Government.<br />
LAURIE OAKES: Is it the toughest Budget since you came to </p>
<p>office? Is that a fair description?<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAWKE: I don't whether it is the toughest. They<br />
have all been pretty hard. I suppose it is the toughest in this<br />
sense to the extent that we have got to find some more-saving and<br />
we do, almost by definition. The ones you have taken in the<br />
first seven years are relatively the easier ones. What's left<br />
are comparatively the harder.<br />
ALAN RAMSAY: You still want a great big surplus, though?<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAWKE: It is not a question of wanting it just<br />
for the sake of it.<br />
ALAN RAMSAY: For economic reasons.<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAWKE: You need a considerable surplus, yes.<br />
ALAN RAMSAY: That would be more-, spending cuts and essentially<br />
the first Budget after an election. Always the---<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAWKE: Let me say this, Alan. I know neither o'f<br />
you expect that I am going to give you-the details. But rpughly<br />
you have got it right. There will be more expenditure savings<br />
and this, together with the other things we do in . the Budget,<br />
will be directed towards having a significant surplus because<br />
Australia has * got to have that. Without getting into the<br />
technical jargon, essentially what Governments that is, the<br />
Federal and the State Governments have to do is to reduce their<br />
demands upon the community savings because that means then that<br />
the savings are available for expansion by the private sector.<br />
And we don't need then, correspondingly, to call to the same<br />
extent upon overseas resources.<br />
LAURIE OAKES: Prime Minister, does the economic situation mean<br />
that you won't be able to deliver fully now in the Budget on some<br />
of your election promises.<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAWKE: Let's wait and see. I don't want to<br />
prejudge. ALAN RAMSAY: You're confident that the child care package, which<br />
was a centrepiece of the election campaign and your campaign<br />
speech, will be met over the term of this Government?<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAWKE: It's not long to wait, Alan.<br />
LAURIE OAKES: That's almost an admission that it's not going to<br />
be met. </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER HAWKE: You read what you like into what I say.<br />
You had one great scoop in getting the Budget before it was<br />
actually delivered, Laurie, and you deserve credit for that.<br />
You're not going to get one from me.<br />
LAURIE OAKES: Not today. Prime Minister, Graeme Richardson, the<br />
Social Security Minister, was reported as telling colleagues that<br />
he expects to cop heaps as a result of the Budget. That does<br />
mean that you are going to be belting people on welfare benefits?<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAWKE: There will be some decisions that have an<br />
effect in that area. Of course, in some important areas, there<br />
will be compensating decisions but I can't go any further than<br />
that.<br />
S AURIE OAKES: Why is the Labor G6vernment targeting those sorts<br />
of areas?<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAWKE: It is not a question of targeting those<br />
areas. To put it that way doesn't do justice to what our<br />
approach has been. There has been targeting in the past in that<br />
we have tried to conserve resources to ensure that those mos in<br />
need are protected and there will not'be any capricious attack<br />
on those most in need.<br />
ALAN RAMSAY: Prime Minister, the Resdrve Bank recently the<br />
Treasurer has again cut bfficial interest rates. Fiscal policy<br />
is being tightened as you acknowledge. Does this mean that the<br />
Government's overall economic policy is being changed along the<br />
lines that critics have been calling for?<br />
S PRIME MINISTER HAWKE: What it means, Alan, is that we have had,<br />
as you know, to tighten policy over the last 12 months or so<br />
because we couldn't sustain the level of demand with the<br />
associated level of imports. Let's look at what has been<br />
happening. Over the last four quarters the inflation rate is.:<br />
trending down from about 2.3 per cent in the September quarter<br />
down to 1.6 per cent in the last quarter.' Inflation in tending<br />
down. In the last quarter imports went down by 11 per cent. So<br />
we are seeing evidence of the successful impact of the tight<br />
policies that we have had. That has been associated then with<br />
this most recent decision to which you referred the ease off<br />
of monetary policy. What we will continue to do, Alan, is to </p>
<p>monitor the impact of the decisions that we have made and<br />
obviously, if further down the track we see further evidence to<br />
support the conclusion then there will be a further easing of<br />
policy. LAURIE OAKES: One thing that the Budget won't contain is any<br />
announcement of telecommunications or the airlines for that<br />
matter. The Government is in a terrible mess on those issues,<br />
isn't it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAWKE: I wouldn't describe it as a terrible mess.<br />
It is not elegant and I concede that. We are not in a terrible<br />
elegant position. I am not trying to be the slick politician in<br />
dodging an issue. I have said quite clearly that when you come<br />
to a point in a great party l: ike this that has very firm<br />
positions about monopolies of publicly-owned utilities, it is not<br />
to be expected, Laurie and Alan, that we are just going to say<br />
that it is easy to contemplate changethere. That is going to<br />
arouse passions. As well as passions it is going to arouse quite<br />
legitimate differences' of view about what is the best way of<br />
going about change. So what we are witnessing now is precisely<br />
that and I am rot upset about it. I concede it is not terribly<br />
elegant but it is exactly what you woul'd expect. The important<br />
thing is this. Where ' he essential debate remains in this<br />
community is not within the Labor Party. We will come up in the<br />
area of telecommunications with a policy that will be calculated<br />
to introduce competition but in-a situation where there will<br />
S continue to be a publicly-owned telecommunication facility. As<br />
far as the best interests of Australia are concerned that is<br />
essential. And the debate, the distinction, is between that<br />
Labor Party position and what is now clearly that of the<br />
conservatives who will flog Telecom and sacrifice the interests<br />
of Australians by just removing a publicly-owned facility from<br />
this area and just throw it right over to the private sector.<br />
That is the real debate and it is the debate that the Labor Party<br />
will deal with.<br />
LAURIE OAKES: But they have at least made a decision but you are<br />
paralysed to the special ALP conference, are you not?<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAWKE: Paralysed if you want to put it that way. </p>
<p>11<br />
What I have said, quite properly, is that we will wait until the<br />
conference has the opportunity of considering this because there<br />
is an existing policy position which is not appropriate to the<br />
present position. We are changing that but out of that change<br />
you will have in Australia the start of debate. Labor standing<br />
for competition but competition where there is a publicly-owned<br />
telecommunications facility, internationally and domestically.<br />
The conservatives who are going to say to the Australian people<br />
that we don't give a damn about protecting you, we are going to<br />
flog the whole lot off to the private sector that is a debate<br />
that I am more than happy to be engaged in', and am more than<br />
confident about the outcome.<br />
ALAN RAMSAY: Prime Minister, Gough Whitlam has challenged you<br />
to say what has happened since 1985. Have you changed your<br />
stance of privatisation?<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAWKE: I'll be saying tiat as I have been within<br />
the process of the party. I don't regard it as particularly<br />
necessary or appropriate to be having a public discussion) or<br />
debate with Gough about this. I will be handling it within the<br />
party.<br />
ALAN RAMSAY: On the subject of Gough. ' His terms as Chairman of<br />
the National Gallery ends' in December. Will you be giving him<br />
an extension?<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAWKE: I think what I will be doing in that area,<br />
Alan, is not appropriate for relevation on this show.<br />
ALAN RAMSAY: Gough would think so.<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAWKE: That he would think it appropriate to<br />
reveal it on here?<br />
ALAN RAMSAY: No. Just to know. He would like an extension.<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAWKE: We will see.<br />
LAURIE OAKES: Prime Minister, in the election campaign in March<br />
you said repeatedly you promised that you would remain Prime<br />
Minister through this entire term and go to another election.<br />
Does that still apply?<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAWKE: Yes.<br />
LAURIE OAKES: Absolutely, solemn, cross-your-heart promise?<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAWKE: Yes. That is my commitment. </p>
<p>LAURIE OAKES: So if you breach that commitment, if you do go<br />
before the next election, the Australian public would have reason<br />
to feel that you had breached faith with them?<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAWKE: They would certainly have reason to<br />
believe that I hadn't adhered to what I said. I guess is<br />
something disastrous happens to me they might excuse me but I am<br />
hoping that won't happen.<br />
LAURIE OAKES: But it has to be something disastrous. You won't<br />
be forced out, you won't go to avoid being a loser?<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAWKE: I've given you my answer, Laurie.<br />
LAURIE OAKES: We are just about out of time, 1rime Minister, but<br />
the Senate is to be televised from Tuesday. Will the Government<br />
allow the House of Representative' to be televised as well?<br />
S PRIME MINISTER HAWKE: Let me quickly answer that. I have had<br />
a discussion with my Cabinet about a range of issues for reform<br />
of the proceedings generally of the Parliament. I have just got<br />
to finalise one matter on that in the -Cabinet room this week and<br />
then I am going to have a discussion with the Leader of ) the<br />
Opposition. It would be my hope that out of those discussions<br />
we would be getting television of the Parliament.<br />
LAURIE OAKES: Prime Minister, thank you very much.<br />
