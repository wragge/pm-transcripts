PRIME MINISTER<br />
EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
BUSINESS COUNCIL OF AUSTRALIA<br />
CANBERRA 29 APRIL 1987<br />
Sir Roderick Carnegie<br />
Ladies and gentlemen<br />
It is a more than usual pleasure to be with you tonight.<br />
You can imagine it has been a rather entertaining couple of<br />
days in Parliament, observing from hour to hour an<br />
ever-changing opposition line up.<br />
But I have to state honestly as Prime Minister of a country<br />
which still faces a serious economic challenge that the<br />
chronic shortcomings of the Opposition are disturbing.<br />
Their basic failure has been an incapacity to develop<br />
workable and relevant economic policies.<br />
That failure must be of particular concern to the business<br />
community which along with the rest of the country,. is<br />
incapable of getting answers to their legitimate questions<br />
about where the alternative Government stands on the<br />
absolutely central issues in the national economic debate<br />
such as taxes, spending cuts and industrial relations.<br />
That opposition policy vacuum makes it all the more<br />
important that groups like the BCA continue their articulate<br />
and constructive involvement in national policy making.<br />
Let me commend you in particular for the part you have<br />
played in encouraging the review of out-dated work practices<br />
and in opening channels of communication with universities.<br />
We have recently received your important submission to the<br />
Government on the Budget and your report on enterprise-based<br />
wages negotiation. I want to make some specific comments<br />
about those reports later.<br />
First let me make the general point that as Prime Minister I<br />
appreciate your contribution and, even where we have not<br />
been able to see eye to eye, I welcome your continued<br />
involvement in the public arena.<br />
And in saying that, let me reaffirm my commitment to the<br />
process of consultation and cooperation which I believe is<br />
one of the abiding hallmarks of my Government's approach. </p>
<p>2<br />
This process is based on my deeply held conviction that our<br />
shared destiny will be enhanced if we are prepared to share<br />
the work of getting there.<br />
in 1987 that conviction is more, not less, relevant than<br />
when we came to office in 1983.<br />
Next month Paul Keating will be presenting to Parliament the<br />
May Statement and, later, we will be hosting another<br />
Premiers' Conference. We see both of these events as<br />
absolutely crucial stages in the Government's overall<br />
strategy of restructuring the economy and ensuring the<br />
future prosperity of the Australian people.<br />
The task of economic adjustment is far from over. Years of<br />
sustained effort lie ahead if as a community we are to<br />
create a kind of Australia that Australians deserve.<br />
But that is not to say there has been no progress in the.<br />
seven months since I last had the pleasure of-speaking<br />
formally to the BCA. There has indeed been significant<br />
progress and tonight I want briefly to review that progress<br />
with you.<br />
Let me begin with Australia's trading envi ronment.<br />
This week we are witnessing another unedifying episode in<br />
protectionism as the US and Japan argue over their market<br />
for semi-conductors.<br />
I do not wish tonight to take sides in the dispute, or to<br />
overestimate the importance of this specific dispute to<br />
Australia's trading prospects.<br />
But I mention it as another disturbing symptom of the<br />
spreading plague of protectionism.<br />
Australians are already suffering enough from the failure of<br />
the major agricultural producers to lift their crippling<br />
restrictions on the trade of farm products.<br />
I outlined a plan in Switzerland in January to bring about a<br />
reduction in those protectionist excesses. That plan has<br />
been well received.<br />
And I have decided to send an all-party delegation of MiPs to<br />
Washington next month to lobby the US Congress against its<br />
next round of proposed protectionist legislation. Mr<br />
Dawkins will be visiting Washington shortly afterwards to<br />
take our concerns directly to the Administration and to the<br />
Congress. So in that context the semi-conductors dispute between the<br />
Us and Japan illustrates again the unwillingness of two of<br />
the world's major trading nations to undertake the<br />
structural reform they so urgently need. </p>
<p>Poised as we are on the Pacific rim region, the most dynamic<br />
economic performer in the world, those opportunities are<br />
gigantic.<br />
Of particular pride to me personally is the strong bilateral<br />
relationship we have developed with China. The importance<br />
of the relationship can only grow as China's impressive<br />
modernisation policies bear fruit in the decades to come<br />
the more so if other countries resist the need to change.<br />
The Government has also put considerable work into<br />
developing bilateral ties with other countries within the<br />
region that may emerge as major trading partners of the<br />
future.<br />
Many of the businesses represented here tonight have built<br />
strong ties with the region. I applaud that and encourage<br />
others to do so.<br />
For many smaller companies, however, the task of exporting<br />
must seem daunting.<br />
The Government has in place a number of programs designed to<br />
assist small exporters. In particular, Austrade can and<br />
will provide assistance to those who wish to become involved<br />
in this task.<br />
I have asked Austrade to establish a register of companies<br />
willing to help small exporters market complementary<br />
products abroad.<br />
Let me again invite you, as I have on previous occasions, to<br />
look closely at your operations both to ensure you are not<br />
missing export opportunities and also to see whether you<br />
have the capacity to " give a leg up" to other Australian<br />
companies who may be too small alone to tackle the challenge<br />
of exporting.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
There can be little doubt that the long and complex task of<br />
restructuring is bearing fruit.<br />
As we predicted in the last Budget, the slowing in the<br />
economy then evident was short lived. The December quarter<br />
saw a return to strong growth in Gross Domestic Product with<br />
an increase of 1.1 per cent.<br />
Latest estimates of the 1986-87 current account deficit are<br />
of the order of $ 1 billion less than the Budget forecast of<br />
$ 14 4billion.<br />
Moreover net exports are expected to coptribute<br />
substantially more to growth than the 14 percentage points<br />
forecast at Budget time.<br />
Particularly pleasing has been the strong performance of<br />
manufacturing exports up 30 per cent so far this financial<br />
year. </p>
<p>Without that reform the entire trading system, including<br />
Australian traders, can only suffer.<br />
The Japanese and the American Governments are both well<br />
aware of our concerns on this issue. Only this afternoon I<br />
received from the Japanese Prime Minister Mr Nakasone a<br />
letter, written just before his departure for talks with<br />
President Reagan, in which he expressed his Government's<br />
commitment to address the issues seriously.<br />
The 6.5% decline of the $ US on world currency markets<br />
against the yen over the past month is a signal of the<br />
extent of adjustment required.<br />
The yen and the US dollar are both heavily weighted in<br />
Australia's trade and financial transactions.<br />
The weakness of the US currency has greatly reduced the<br />
significance of movements of that currency as an indicator<br />
of changes in the average value of the Australian dollar.<br />
Greater attention needs to be focussed by markets, by<br />
policy makers, by potential exporters on the trade<br />
weighted value of our currency. The value of the SA<br />
measured in TWI terms, although it has risen significantly<br />
against the US dollar, is in fact little changed from its<br />
level of a month ago.<br />
On average these developments do not adversly affect<br />
Australian producers though they do reduce the<br />
profitability of those exporters who sell in markets quoted<br />
in US dollars and who compete against producers in the<br />
United States.<br />
Both the United States and Japan seek greater currency<br />
stability. But both parties will need to back that<br />
sentiment with domestic policies macro-economic,<br />
industrial and trade which are conducive to stability.<br />
In the absence of those measures, the potential<br />
trade-related dangers for Australia are considerable.<br />
On one hand, the easiest way for Japan to meet US pressures<br />
on market access would be to transfer existing market share<br />
from less valued trading partners; and on the other, the<br />
easiest way for the US to reduce imports is through<br />
protectionist legislation.<br />
Australians would suffer from both of these alternatives and<br />
we will continue to resist them strongly.<br />
As well as urging others to reduce protection this<br />
Government has applied those lessons to our own domestic<br />
institutions and attitudes as well.<br />
That has created new pressures on Australia's businesses to<br />
seek out and exploit new export markets and not just<br />
pressures but opportunities as well. </p>
<p>Tourism has also stepped up markedly. The net foreign<br />
deficit on travel has fallen 49 per cent.<br />
The net services deficit, which covers freight and insurance<br />
in addition to travel, has fallen by 21 per cent.<br />
Weaker than forecast consumption growth a desirable<br />
development in present circumstances has also greatly<br />
assisted this turnaround in the current account.<br />
Interpretation of the trend in the current account is likely<br />
to become more difficult over coming months as the seasonal<br />
increase in the deficit begins to inflate the monthly<br />
statistics. But the underlying improvement in the current account is now<br />
well established and is expected to continue in 1987-88.<br />
AS for GDP growth overall, it appears likely to be rather<br />
weaker for 1986-87 as a whole than we forecast at Budget<br />
time, essentially because of the slower growth of<br />
consumption.<br />
Employment growth has however exceeded our expectations.<br />
In the nine months to March employment has grown by 1.2 per<br />
cent. This means a further 82,000 jobs, bringing the total<br />
number of jobs created under my Government to 760,000.<br />
More than any other statistic, the robustness of employment<br />
growth this year demonstrates the underlying strength of the<br />
economy and the success of the Government's economic<br />
policies. But I don't want to weigh you down this evening with<br />
statistics. The important point is what lies behind those<br />
figures namely, a new and absolutely critical set of<br />
attitudes which now pervades the nation.<br />
There is a dramatically increasing awareness of the need to<br />
export and, more generally, to make and market competitively<br />
priced, quality products.<br />
There is an awareness of the need for continued wage<br />
restraint.<br />
There is an awareness of the need to re-examine past ways of<br />
doing things and an awareness of the need to address our<br />
industrial issues constructively.<br />
Through the Australian Made campaign, there is a growing<br />
awareness of the need to support domestic rather than<br />
imported goods though let me add there is still room for<br />
more Australian companies to adopt the green and gold<br />
kangaroo symbol to identify their products as<br />
Australian-made. </p>
<p>Capitalising on these new attitudes is a task for all of us<br />
business, government, trade unions and the wider<br />
community. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the area of wage<br />
setting and industrial relations and it is to that subject<br />
to which I wish to turn now.<br />
This is the area which the BCA addressed recently in its<br />
report " Towards an Enterprise-Based Industrial Relations<br />
System". I think we can all agree with your concluding comment that<br />
" 1what we want is a better way of working for the benefit of<br />
our industries, their employees and for all Australians".<br />
Similarly, we are on broadly common ground in seeking<br />
flexibility and cooperation to enhance efficiency at the<br />
workplace and greater employee participation in the<br />
workplace. However having said that I must register my disagreement<br />
with your central long-term aspiration totally<br />
enterprise-based agreements on wages.<br />
Australian economic history teaches us that unregulated<br />
bargaining would inject increased inflation into the economy<br />
via a wages explosion and would massively erode the position<br />
of those workers unable to bargain successfully.<br />
The current system has, thank s to the generally magnificent<br />
cooperation of the trade union movement, delivered wage*<br />
outcomes whose macro-economic benefits I believe cannot be<br />
questioned by anyone in this audience a 6% fall in real<br />
unit labor costs over the last four years.<br />
But committed as we are to that centralised system, we are<br />
also determined to make whatever sensible reforms are<br />
necessary to ensure it remains a relevant and useful element<br />
of the national economy.<br />
The Government will shortly be introducing into Parliament a<br />
new Industrial Relations Bill based on the Hancock inquiry<br />
which will contain a number of reforms to enhance the<br />
centralised system.<br />
In drafting these reforms, our approach has been one of<br />
consultation and consensus the very style of approach we<br />
wish to encourage and foster in industrial relations.<br />
On the matter of sanctions, which I know to be of crucial<br />
concern to the business community, I can assure you that the<br />
new legislation will ensure the effective operation of the<br />
industrial relations system, and will include appropriate<br />
penalty provisions and means of redress.<br />
After proper consideration of the Bill I am sure that<br />
generally both unions and employers will recognise its<br />
inherent good sense and equity. </p>
<p>A further example of the centralised system's capacity for<br />
flexibility is provided by the new two-tier structure.<br />
This structure effectively provides one of the goals urged<br />
in your report bargaining over productivity issues at<br />
industry or enterprise level while permitting aggregate<br />
wage outcomes to be kept within responsible bounds.<br />
It is the responsibility of all parties to ensure that the<br />
system works properly to the maximum benefit of Australia.<br />
It has therefore been a little disappointing recently to<br />
observe that agreements have been reached which do not<br />
comply with the principles laid down by the Commission.<br />
The business sector cannot have it both ways.<br />
Business cannot at once call on the Government to seek<br />
modest wage outcomes while acquiescing in significantly<br />
higher outcomes at plant level.<br />
The Commonwealth will be opposing in the appropriate forums<br />
any agreements which are inconsistent with the Commission's<br />
principles. Firms which breach the wages principles can expect to have<br />
the closest of scrutiny applied to them by the Prices<br />
Surveillance Authority.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
The Government is determined to preserve and build upon the<br />
economic gains we have made so far.<br />
We can confidently expect inflation to decline over the<br />
course of the coming year or so, given continued wage<br />
restraint and currency stability.<br />
Interest rates have already begun to decline, partly in<br />
anticipation of further responsible fiscal measures and<br />
lower inflation and partly because of greater overseas<br />
interest in $ A assets.<br />
The Government is determined to preserve and build upon<br />
these gains.<br />
The forthcoming May Statement and Premiers' Conference will<br />
be important building blocks in the Government's strategy.<br />
I have said on a number of occasions now our approach will<br />
be tough but we will not be abandoning our commitment to<br />
fairness in expenditure restraint.<br />
There will be significant cuts in our own outlays in the<br />
Statement and we will adopt a similarly hard-headed approach<br />
in the ensuing Premiers' Conference and Loan Council. </p>
<p>The BCA has recommended we achieve a Budget deficit of<br />
to $ 2 billion in 1987-88.<br />
It is still too early in the Budget cycle to have precise<br />
estimates of revenue and, therefore, of the deficit which<br />
will emerge.<br />
But given our record there should be no doubt about the<br />
Government's determination to provide a significant cut in<br />
both the Budget deficit and the total Public Sector<br />
Borrowing Requirement as a share of GDP.<br />
In the May Statement, spending cuts will be spread across ' a<br />
number of portfolios. Although the Commonwealth is looking<br />
closely at its asset holdings to effect rationalisations<br />
where prudent, the major focus of our attention is on<br />
general recurrent outlays.<br />
There will, for example, be further measures to weed out<br />
welfare cheats and ensure that social security benefits go<br />
only to those who are entitled to them.<br />
A more wide ranging examination of welfare outlays has also<br />
been necessary, producing some measures which, in earlier<br />
times, may not have been contemplated.<br />
But we will not be wielding the knife indiscriminately.<br />
Instead we will be seeking, as we have sought in the past,<br />
to implement durable, structural reforms which achieve<br />
budget savings but which also bring about more effective and<br />
fairer delivery of Government services.<br />
The collapse in our terms of trade since the end of 1984 has<br />
stripped some $ 9 billion dollars from our national economic<br />
capacity. To distribute a loss of this magnitude equitably<br />
and to maintain employment growth has been no easy task.<br />
But we have faced this task with firm resolve and we are<br />
succeeding.<br />
The Government is getting the economic fundamentals right.<br />
Private enterprise now must exercise its responsibilities.<br />
Australia needs entrepreneurs with drive and new ideas to<br />
create new products and new markets.<br />
We need research and development, expenditure on which now<br />
qualifies for an extremely generous tax deduction of 150 per<br />
cent.<br />
We need investment which has, indeed, already begun to pick<br />
up, especially in manufacturing.<br />
Over the next year several factors will create unprecedented<br />
opportunities for investment to strengthen further. These<br />
include: </p>
<p>9<br />
SA gradual easing in interest rates as the task of<br />
adjustment is progressively removed from monetary<br />
policy;<br />
SA resumption of economic growth;<br />
SA slowing in the rate of increase of prices of imported<br />
investment goods; and<br />
SA wider perception of the opportunities emerging for<br />
Australia to expand into new export markets thanks to,<br />
among other factors, the depreciation of the dollar.<br />
So we enter the crucial next stage in our strategy of<br />
reconstruction with some cautious optimism that the economic<br />
future is brighter than the months and years we have just<br />
passed through.<br />
The worst is behind us.<br />
As you are aware I decided earlier this month not to call an<br />
early election.<br />
The disarray among the Opposition parties provided an<br />
enormous temptation to go to the voters early. It would<br />
certainly have been a successful political move. But it<br />
would also have been inconsistent with our long-term<br />
strategy to improve the economy.<br />
That strategy means we must take the hard decisions. We are<br />
taking them.<br />
It means we must act with fairness and compassion. We are<br />
doing that.<br />
Our strategy means we must govern for the future even at the<br />
expense of some short-term flak for unpopular decisions<br />
along the way. We are acting accordingly.<br />
Our strategy, finally, means that we must together promote<br />
the nation's best chances of prosperity. We most certainly<br />
are doing that.<br />
And we look for your continued assistance in this shared<br />
task of reconstruction our task for today and,<br />
importantly, our responsibility to future generations of<br />
Australians. </p>
