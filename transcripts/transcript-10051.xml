    <content><![CDATA[<p>Gough Whitlam celebrates his eightieth birthday today. All Australians<br />
will wish him well. </p>
<p>imulative tust the Whatever one's politics may be, it must be acknowledged that Gough Whitlam has been a colourful, forceful and influential figure in the affairs of our nation for many years. </p>
<p>His success in leading the Labor Party to victory after 23 years of Coalition Government was, of course, his greatest political achievement. </p>
<p>Despite our political differences, I have long had a warm personal regard for Gough Whitlam. His company, and that of his wife, Margaret, is always enjoyable, lively and, of course, from time to time provocative. </p>
<p>Janette and I wish him and his family a very happy celebration on such<br />
a milestone. </p>
