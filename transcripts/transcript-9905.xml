CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
THE SINGAPORE LECTURE " AUSTRALIA, ASIA AND THE NEW<br />
REGIONALISM" SINGAPORE, 17 JANUARY 1996<br />
It is a great honour to have been asked to give this lecture and I thank Professor<br />
Chan Heng Chee and the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies for the invitation.<br />
Australia has had a long and productive association with the Institute over many<br />
years. I also want to thank the Government of Singapore for Its support for the lecture<br />
and, especially, Deputy Prime Minister Tony Tan for his courtesy to me In<br />
chairing it today.<br />
This is my third visit to Singapore as Prime Minister and It is always a pleasure<br />
to come here. There Is an energy about Singapore which flows from people<br />
who are conscious of the Inevitability of change and who are trying to shape that<br />
change for the better.<br />
I admire that. Singapore, perhaps more than any other place in the world,<br />
teaches the vital lesson that we cannot prepare for the future until we know<br />
what we want it to be.<br />
This has been the distinctive principle guiding Singapore's modern history: the<br />
same principle that some time ago began to guide Australia through the present<br />
era. When you face things and begin to do what must be done, you liberate<br />
ideas about what can be done. This great era of change has meant that as we<br />
approach the centenary of Australia's nationhood a new, stronger and clearer<br />
vision of our future has begun to emerge. And It now goes without saying that<br />
much of the future we see we see in the Asia-Pacific.<br />
The vision of a future for the region, and of the potential for our relationship to<br />
serve our separate and mutual interests, has been the Inspiration and the guide<br />
for the joint efforts between Australia and Singapore over the past four years,<br />
and it is the reason why I have so much enjoyed working with Prime Minister<br />
Goh and his colleagues on Issues like APEC and regional security. </p>

And although this lecture Is not about our bilateral relationship, I want to begin<br />
by saying how pleased 1 am that the Prime Minister and I were able this morning<br />
to issue a major declaration on the Austral! ia. Singapore partnership which will<br />
help ensure that this old relationship between us remains relevant and creative<br />
into the next century.<br />
And it Is an old relationship. In Singapore, of all places, the provenance of<br />
Australia's engagement with modem Southeast Asia Is clear. Indeed, for the<br />
generation of Australians before mine, Singapore was interchangeable with<br />
what we then referred to as the Far Fast, although It was really the Near<br />
Northwest. Singapore's history and Australia's have been closely linked throughout this<br />
century. You need only go to the cemetery at Kranjl where so many<br />
Australians are buried.<br />
After Singapore's Independence. the links between us grew through our<br />
partnership in the Five Power Defence Arrangements and the bilateral defence<br />
ties which merged from It Today, our bilateral defence cooperation is<br />
extensive. The Singapore armed force train in Australia and the RSAF has<br />
established a Flying School at Pearce Air Force Base in Western Australia.<br />
Our close engagement was strengthened through the people to people links<br />
establshed under the Colombo Plan and since. Last year nearly<br />
10,000 Singaporeans studied In Austraria.<br />
And, of course, our growing trade and Investment ties underpin an economic<br />
relationship which is Important to both of us. Singapore and Australia are<br />
consistently among each other's top ten trading partners.<br />
We have also developed a strong habit of cooperation on regional Issues where<br />
our views so often coincide APEC most recently, of course, but earlier with<br />
ASEAN, with which Australia was the first country to estabrish a formal dialogue<br />
relationship. Now in the declaration we have signed today we have affirmed the strength of<br />
our partnership and established a framework to support our continuing<br />
cooperation In all these areas.<br />
For me this partnership is especially important because, as Prime Minister, one<br />
of my central goals has been to see that Australia Is better Integrated with the<br />
rapidly changing region around us, that we have an opportunity to play a role in<br />
shaping it and are better prepared to meet whatever challenges the 21st<br />
century may offer. -A N </p>

1 have said more than once before* I Australia does not succeed In Asia It will<br />
not succeed anywhere.<br />
But success clearly requires more than the traditional tools of foreign policy.<br />
For Australia, as I suspect for most countries, our external relations can no<br />
longer exist in a separate box marked " foreign relations" or " foreign policy"<br />
largely unconnected with the domestic policies which are needed to build a<br />
society which Is both open and competitive and cohesive and strong.<br />
That was why it was imperative for Australia to dismantle the ring fence of tarffs<br />
and protection to open our economy to competitive breezes, and in so doing, lift<br />
our gaze to the world.<br />
We deregulated our capital and exchange rate markets and opened them to the<br />
world for the same reasons.<br />
As a result, In the decade to 1 994/ 95, Australia's export to GDP ratio Increased<br />
from 14 percent to 21.5 per cent. The level of direct foreign investment In<br />
Austrlia Ns increased eight fold and the level of direct Australian Investment<br />
abroad has increased seven fold.<br />
Rt was all there, waiting to be unlocked.<br />
It is also why it has been necessary for us to address other challenges thrown<br />
up both by our history and the imperatives of the future. One of those has been<br />
the Injustice done to Australia's Indigenous people, not least through the<br />
lingering pretence that before Europeans arrived on our oontinent it was a terra<br />
nuthlus a land of nobody. We have undertaken a huge effort In social justice to<br />
see that historic wrong put right.<br />
I think It will be equally good for our long term national cohesion and sense of<br />
ourselves If we make the leap to a republic. The time has come for an<br />
Australian, rather than the monarch of Great Britain, to be our head of state. I<br />
want Australia to be, a3 Singapore is, a Republic and a Republic within the<br />
Commonwealth.<br />
The change will not make us what we want to be, but It will help describe us to<br />
ourselves and to others. it will help define our complex Identity, help articulate<br />
our ambitions and values, help fuse the links between the old Australia and the<br />
new. </p>

Much the same desire to preserve Australia's egalitarian values and traditions<br />
arnd maintain cohesion and harmony ted us, as we made the structural changes,<br />
to intensify our efforts to strengthen Australia's social fabric. Our economic<br />
effort has been matched by an effort to develop sophisticated social programs<br />
which deliver equity and encourage tolerance. The path we have taken leads<br />
towards a modem multicultural Australian social democracy, one that Is dynamic<br />
economically and socially fair,<br />
All this change, economic, social and political, has set Australia up for the<br />
future. It Is also divining our path in the Asia-Pacific.<br />
I have always said that the nature of Australia's relationship with Asia has been<br />
long and for the most part honourable.<br />
But Australian Governments and the Australian people have recently come to<br />
recognise the impflcatlons of living In and with the region which Gareth Evans<br />
describes a~ s the East Asian hemisphere.<br />
Australia's closer relationship with Asia Is partly driven by economic realities, of<br />
course. Already two-thirds of our trade is with the APEC region, more than half<br />
of It with East Asia.<br />
But our engagement with the region around us Is not just commercial. And It is<br />
not just the result of some crude economic determinism.<br />
It goes and must go much deeper than that<br />
Rt goes to a genuine desire for partnershIp and real Involvement.<br />
For example, it has changed our thinking about our defence on the basis that<br />
Australis needs to seek its security In Asia rather than from Asia.<br />
That is why we have so strongly supported the development of the ASEAN<br />
Regional Forum. It Is why we have worked hard to develop strong defence links<br />
with our neighbours like Singapore and Malaysia, as well as new partnerships<br />
with countries like the Philippines and Vietnam.<br />
And It Is why we recently signed with Indonesia a new Security Agreement<br />
which builds on the development of our bilateral defence inks, </p>
<p>TTEELL 17. Jan. 96 15: 58 No. 012 P. 05/ 1'<br />
This agreement sets out formally for the first time the reality that neither<br />
Australia nor Indonesia threatens the other and that we have common interests<br />
In the stability and security of the region around us. And it goes further than<br />
that, to make it clear that we are prepared to consult If those interests are<br />
challenged. The agreement marks a major step not only In Australia's relations with our<br />
largest neighbour but also In the outlook for regional stability. It expresses a<br />
common understanding that we are stronger together and that we should affirm<br />
a common interest.<br />
Similarly, Australia's engagement with the region extends much more freely to<br />
people-to-people contacts. Language and capacity in language Is central to<br />
this. Accordingly, the Federal and state governments have committed<br />
themselves to a language strategy which aims to have by 2006 sixty per cent of<br />
all Australian school children from years three to ten studying one of four Asian<br />
languages Indonesian, Japanese, Mandarin Chinese or Korean.<br />
And this change is already well underway. Already more people are studying<br />
Japanese1 Australia than in any other country apart from China, Korea and<br />
Japan Itself. And more schoolchildren from Australia spend time studying In<br />
Japanese schools than children from any other country.<br />
At the same time there can be no doubt that the course of closer engagement<br />
with Asia on which Australia Is now embarked is having its impact on our culture<br />
and outlook as well.<br />
The nearly forty per cent of Immigrants to Australia who now come from Asia<br />
are playing their part in changing the way Australians think about the world and<br />
their country; In just the same way that earlier waves of Immigrants, ever since<br />
1788, successively shaped and re-shaped Australia's sense of itself.<br />
And, It goes without saying, Australia Is shaping them and their descendants as<br />
It shaped those who have come before.<br />
I don't want to enter the debate about ' Asian values' here but I do want to say<br />
something about Australian values.<br />
Although it Is often described as a young country, Australia is one of the oldest<br />
democracies In the world. We had universal suffrage and secret ballots well<br />
before the United Kingdom and before almost any other country. The<br />
democracy is old and runs deep. Our sense of ourselves Is imprinted with ideas<br />
of equality and equity among them, the conviction that all members of our<br />
society not only have a right but a duty to have their say. That is why voting in<br />
Australia Is compulsory. </p>

And despite deep imperfections in our record, including the racism inherent in<br />
our immigration policies until a quarter of a century ago, Australia has also been<br />
a very tolerant community, absorbing settlers from all parts of the world with<br />
remarkably little tension.<br />
In many perhaps most respects, the values I believe In and most Australians<br />
believe in are precisely those that are often referred to in this debate as " Asian".<br />
The importance of family, the benefit of education, the need for order and public<br />
accountability, the inherent value of work most Australians I know would<br />
describe these as Australian values. Indeed the word most Australians would<br />
very likely choose to describe as the core Australian value is ' mateship' and<br />
' mateship' expresses an ethic of communltarianism and mutual obligation which<br />
in other contexts Is called " Asian".<br />
In other areas respect for authority, the Importance of ' face' and the<br />
preference for harmony and the avoidance of conflict the differences between<br />
Australia and some other Asian countries is dearer, but the degree to which this<br />
to a debate about values, as opposed to cultural practices, Is less clear.<br />
More Impqant over time, I think, will be where we stand on the larger debate<br />
not about" Asian' or western values, but about values themselves and what the<br />
role of government should be In shaping them.<br />
Fundamentally It will be a debate between those who believe the main role of<br />
government is to get out of the way and let the market rip and those who<br />
consider that government provided it is operating with the consent of the<br />
governed has a role in shaping and expressing the values of our community.<br />
Defined this way, the debate cuts across Asian and western societies alike.<br />
I have never believed that Australians should describe themselves as Asians or<br />
that Australia is or can become part of Asia.<br />
We are the only nation In the world to Inhabit a continent of our own. I have<br />
said more than once before, we can't be Asian any more than we can be<br />
European or North American or African. We can only be Australian and can<br />
only relate to our neighbours as Australians. Our history, Including the 40,000<br />
year history of our indigenous people and the histories of the 150 different<br />
cultures from which Australians derive, make us unique in the world.<br />
Our somewhat unlikely history and geography should not change this<br />
fundamental conviction and this irrevocable commitment that Australia Is and<br />
must always be an integral part of the region around us.<br />
Let me turn now from Australia to the issues of this wider region, and to the<br />
question of regionalism itself. </p>

1 want to use this lecture to say some things about the region, about what<br />
regionalism means in the post-Cold War world, and especially for the<br />
Asia-Pacific. Finally, I want to look ahead at some of the issues we will have to<br />
address in the next decade or so.<br />
The fact that we describe the present International scene as the post-Cold War<br />
world in terms of what came before us rather than what we have become<br />
underlines how fluid the International environment is at present and how<br />
uncertain we are about the shape it Is taking.<br />
We are living through the greatest period of change In the world since the<br />
emergence of the nation state, arnd we have a very limited time in which to<br />
shape the new international structures before nations and institutions settle into<br />
new grooves from which It will be very difficult to dislodge them. What we. 1<br />
mean all of us do now will lay the foundations for prosperity and security In the<br />
21 st century just as fatefully and Inevitably as the actions of Europe's leaders<br />
did a century ago.<br />
And unles~, get it rght now, our failure might be no less calamitous then<br />
theirs. When the Berlin Wall came down, when President Yeltsin and his supporters<br />
later stood on the tanks outside the White House In Moscow to defy the coup<br />
plotters and brought down the Soviet Union, they also brought down the post<br />
war international order.<br />
The expectations of a new International order, based on a concert of powers<br />
opetating to a large extent through a revived and renewed United Nations, have<br />
not been fulfilled.<br />
In part. I believe, this Is because our global international structures are<br />
Incomplete and immature. They still reflect too directly the world into which<br />
most of them emerged at the end of the 1940s.<br />
Japan and Germany. the world's second and third-largest economies are selfconstrained<br />
from playing their full part In the International system.<br />
Russia will always be one of the world's great powers, but now and over the<br />
next few years it will be preoccupied with the consequences of the end of the<br />
Soviet Union.<br />
China is emerging into the world, and the way that happens will dominate the<br />
Asia Pacific like no other Issue over the coming decades. But for the time being<br />
China, too, is largely preoccupied with domestic issues and especially<br />
developing t economy. </p>
<p>TEL: 17. Jan. 96 15: 58 No. 012 P. 08/ 19<br />
Meanwhile, in the United States, the world's only remaining superpower, the<br />
struggle goes on as it has since the foundation of the Republic between those<br />
who believe the United States should avoid foreign entanglements and those<br />
who want it to be engaged with the wider world. This, as always In the United<br />
States, is not only a debate among the politicians and the political elite. Its<br />
outcome depends, In the and, on what t American people think. and we<br />
should not be surprised If it is harder to engage them with foreign policy now<br />
than it was for the high moral struggle of the Cold War.<br />
At another level, too, global structures are often too large and rigid to permit<br />
productive discussion. The sheer weight of numbers In the United Nations, for<br />
example, means that complex negotiations often have to be conducted through<br />
increasingly out-of-date groupings which often fall to reflect current economic<br />
and political realities.<br />
Australia can speak with feeling on this matter. For United Nations purposes,<br />
we are relegated to the category of ' others', as part of a Western European and<br />
Others grouing.<br />
it Is not Juit the absurdity of this classification which Irritates but the practical<br />
consequences. More and more clearly, Australia's Interests cannot be properly pursued in such<br />
framework. It Is a structure which emphasises North/ South divisions. This<br />
tends to generate on the side of the North a strongly Eurocentric perspective<br />
on global problems. But the ' South' is where Austraria's neighbours are, and it<br />
Is with the ' South' that our Interests often coincide rather than diverge.<br />
For all these reasons, the present global structure is inadequate.<br />
This is not an unchangeable state of affairs. There is much that can be done<br />
about it.<br />
For example, Australia supports permanent membership of the United Nations<br />
Security Council for both Germany and Japan, a position for which Japan's<br />
excellent chairmanship of the Osaka APEC meeting further justified It.<br />
And we believe it is essential to encourage the United States to play an active<br />
and engaged role In the world not just in the Asia Pacific, but globally. </p>

We hope that such outside encouragement like the Joint declaration which<br />
Singapore and Australia issued this morning will strengthen the position of<br />
those Americans who share our conviction that US Interests, as well as ours,<br />
are advanced by their continuing active engagement in East Asia. Nothing is<br />
more likely to generate security tensions In this part of the world, or threaten the<br />
region's continuing economic and social development, than uncertainty in<br />
countries like Japan and Korea about the continued US security commitment.<br />
One of the main reasons behind Australia's support for APEC has been our<br />
conviction that closer American economic engagement in Asia and the Pacific<br />
win reinforce the essential political underpinnings of Its security relationships.<br />
The other great uncertainty about the interational situation In the coming<br />
decades, as I said earlier, is China.<br />
The economic reforms introduced by Deng Xlaoping and President Jiang Zemin<br />
have brought profound benefits for the international community as a whole, not<br />
just for China. There have been few more significant developments in the past<br />
half century.<br />
I do not bel( eve China is an expansionist or aggressive power, or that it is likely<br />
to become so. It is an essential and central part of the regional community.<br />
However, the sheer size of its population and economy raises questions for the<br />
rest of us about how we deal with it,<br />
For my part, I think there is little doubt about what the broad approach should<br />
be. Above all, the answer Is to ensure that China is engaged comprehensively in<br />
global and regional institutions. This has been a major aim of APEC and the<br />
ASEAN Regional Forum to engage China, not to contain it or Isolate it.<br />
But the answer also lies In China's neighbours making their own way in the<br />
region and taking responsibility for their own future. It Is the responsibility of all<br />
of us to build what ASEAN calls our national and regional resilience: a region<br />
which is self-confident and cooperative, rather than apprehensive and self.<br />
absorbed, will be better for an of us including China.<br />
And, In part, that means building institutions and structures which engage all the<br />
countries of the region in a dialogue about the future.<br />
ts ar hrIin ht hnOk fram the to the regional. It Is a sign of<br />
the times the most important sign oI the oeneve. </p>

For the time being, at least, the role of the great powers in shaping the<br />
development of the International system Is less dominant than it might otherwise<br />
be. And this, as I said earlier, 13 happening at the very time when we are<br />
moulding the Institutions and processes and ways of resoMng problems which<br />
will form the pattern of the next period In International relations.<br />
I think that one outcome of this situation 1s that regionalism and regional<br />
approaches will come Into their own as never before.<br />
This century, was dominated by global struggles. Imperialism and later<br />
Communism were of their nature global. Two world wars and the Ideoiogical<br />
struggle of the Cold War taught us to structure our ways of thinking about the<br />
world In essentially global terms.<br />
Regional approaches were usually subordinated to this broader competition.<br />
The multilateral defence pacts of the 1950~ s were an example. Even the<br />
development of the EEC was driven in part by the need to strengthen western<br />
Europe economically and politically against the Soviet threat<br />
But with the-breakdown of the bipolar structure of the Cold War, regional<br />
problems nI&amp; longer automatically form a metaphor for a wider global and<br />
Ideological struggle as they did In Afghanistan and Angola and Central America.<br />
Instead, it Is easier now to address regional Issues on their own terms.<br />
And a degree of flexibility Is possible In regional Institution building which has<br />
never been possible before. Vietnam's membership of ASEAN and the<br />
common membership of APEC by the three Chinese economies are Important<br />
examples. So, for alt these reasons, I think that In the Immediate future regionalism offers<br />
the capacity to generate new Ideas, subsume old enmites and provide new<br />
ways of doing things. It can let the light in in a way which global structures are<br />
too large or unwieldy or rigid to do.<br />
Thi3, In turn, means that the opportunities for small and medium sized countries<br />
to shape the International agenda are greater than they have ever been In the<br />
post. So long as they know what they want and where they are heading.<br />
I am sure that one of the reasons for the success of the Asia Pacific In global<br />
terms Is the creative way In which regionalism has been embraced in this part of<br />
the world.<br />
It Is not a new phenomenon. of course. ASEAN has been an enormous<br />
success in transforming the tensions of the confrontation era In Southeast Asia<br />
Into a habit of working together. </p>
<p>TEL: 17. Jan. 96 15: 58 No. 012 P. 11/ 19<br />

But the next burst of regionalism, including within ASEAN, is growing in range<br />
and ambition.<br />
APEC has made huge strides In a few short years.<br />
When I first proposed the idea of meetings of APEC leaders In 1992, I did so<br />
because I was convinced that unless APEC could begin to draw upon the<br />
executive authority of national leaders it would remain a modest and essentially<br />
peripheral organisation, making progress only at the pace of Its slowest officials.<br />
It Is leaders who have the political authority to commit a country to a certain<br />
course in pursuit of certain outcomes, and leaders who are charged with the<br />
responsibility to recognise the bigger picture and the bigger opportunities that<br />
come with it.<br />
Once leaders were involved In the development and formulation of policy in<br />
APEC, a different dynamic evolved and the pace of action quickened.<br />
Most leaders believe that any event In which they participate should deliver a<br />
good result so, from Seattle on, the pressure was on to formulate a strategy<br />
and then dive it.<br />
At the same time, once the leaders met and don't forget that the Seattle<br />
meeting was the first time leaders from across the Asia Pacific had ever met<br />
the pressing reality of our interdependence generated a new momentum for<br />
cooperation. The very feeling of co-operation generated even more goodwill.<br />
This happened in Seattle, where we set out the vision of an Asia Pacific<br />
community. Then the following year in Indonesia. President Soeharto gave this<br />
vision a concrete form in the Bogor Declaration's historic commitment to free<br />
trade and Investment in the region by 2010 and 2020. And finally, last year, In<br />
Osaka, where we put together the plan of action for reaching our objective as<br />
well as offering specific downpayments on our Bogor commitments.<br />
APEC was conceived as an organisation of economies and It is vital that its<br />
main function continues to be economic. If the East Asian economic miracle is<br />
not to run out of steam to end up, as some European commentators wishfully<br />
predict, as a short-term and unsustainable phenomenon It Is essential that the<br />
trade and Investment arteries within the region are kept open. It is essential that<br />
we do all we can to help the activities of our business people, who make the<br />
trade happen.<br />
So the pressure on APEC will not diminish. Every meeting, every year has to<br />
make progress. Later this year in Subic Bay we will need to take the first steps<br />
to implement our Individual plans of action. </p>
<p>TEL: 17. Jan. 96 15: 58 No. 012 P. 12/ 1_<br />
12<br />
Such progress is critical not only for the Asia Pacific's continuing economic<br />
growth, but for its security as well.<br />
Because, although APEC's purpose Is economic, It will have, like ASEAN before<br />
it, important political and strategic consequences.<br />
It is already having them. No-one who has participated in those three<br />
successive leaders meetings, or in the Ministerial meetings, can fail to notice the<br />
increasing ease with which leaders representing half the world's production now<br />
deal with each other. And no one can be blind to the amount of business which<br />
Is now conducted In the corridors and related bilateral meetings.<br />
APEC is in many critical respects a new model for regional cooperation and I<br />
believe It shows the way forward. It is " new" in at least three ways.<br />
First, its development has been driven as much by the small and medium<br />
powers as by the large ones a fact that has been one of its strengths given the<br />
global situation I described earlier. Of course President Clinton's decision to<br />
invite APEC leaders to the informal meeting in Seattle was critical, as was the<br />
support wh) ph the Japanese Government and Prime Minister Murayama gave<br />
the free trade agenda during their chairmanship of the Osaka meeting. But<br />
ideas and energy have come just as powerfully from economies like Korea and<br />
Singapore and Indonesia and Australia.<br />
In other words, the sense of ownership and participation Is broadly spread<br />
throughout the organisation. APEC gives the smaller and middle sized<br />
countries of the region a very direct say in shaping its future.<br />
Second, APEC is possibly the best practical example the world has yet seen of<br />
cooperation between countries at different levels of development.<br />
Developing countries are not just participants, they are at the core of the<br />
organisation's activities. President Soeharto's chairmanship of the Bogor<br />
meeting was a critical moment for APEC, but it was also an example to the<br />
world of the new sort of partnership between developed and developing<br />
countries which will be essential as the process of globalisation and<br />
Interationalisation proceeds. The world's fifteen most dynamic trading nations<br />
between 1980 and 1993 were all developing countries.<br />
Third, APEC has offered an approach different from the formal structures and<br />
legalisms of other regional approaches like the European Union or NAFTA or, at<br />
the global level, from the Uruguay Round and the WTO. Unlike earlier models of<br />
trade liberallsation. APEC first announced its end point that is, free trade and<br />
investment by 2010 or 2020 and left the getting there to a process of<br />
concerted Ilberalisation between members rather than to direct negotiation. </p>

This approach is not only new, it has aroused considerable scepticism,<br />
especially from those whose experience of International trade negotiations has<br />
been in the heavyweight boxing ring of the Uruguay Round and its<br />
predecessors. I can understand this scepticism, but I am also convinced It is misplaced. The<br />
drag out/ knock down approach to trade negotiations has surely reached the end<br />
of its useful life In an environment where almost every country in the world,<br />
rather than just a handful of industrialised countries, has a stake in global trade.<br />
Few even among the hardiest trade negotiators can relish the idea of another<br />
seven year Round conducted like the last one. And one where the real offers,<br />
the real impetus to llberalisation, were too often left in the negotiator's pocket to<br />
take back home.<br />
So I remain an optimist that APEC will be able to deliver on the promises it has<br />
made, and that, in doing so, it will offer an example which will be useful to the<br />
rest of the world.<br />
Drawing on these experiences with APEC, as well as other regional<br />
organlsatior it Is becoming possible to draw up a number of rules for the new<br />
regionalism in the Asia/ Pacific. Let me try to enumerate them.<br />
The first rule; there are no rules. Or, at least there are no fixed approaches and<br />
as far as possible we should avoid the nightmare of a bureaucratic and legalistic<br />
approach to what we are doing. The Asia Pacific needs to be a small ' c'<br />
community If It Is to succeed.<br />
For the approach to work, however, a high degree of trust will be required not<br />
a commodity which is thought to flow freely through intematlonal discourse.<br />
The best way of encouraging trust as ASEAN has shown and APEC will Is<br />
through close personal contact between leaders and Ministers and with officials<br />
and, beyond that, their counterparts in business.<br />
As 20th century European history vividly testifies, contact does not rule out<br />
conflict but it Is certainly impossible to develop trust between countries and<br />
cultures without It.<br />
The second rule is that we need to avoid closing Asia and the Pacific off to the<br />
outside world.<br />
My argument in favour of regionalism is not an argument against global<br />
multilateral approaches when these are most appropriate, as they often will be. </p>

Indeed, they are often essential. A comprehensive test ban treaty or a chemical<br />
weapons convention, must be negotiated globally. And although Intra-regional<br />
trade in East Asia has grown much more rapidly and Is of greater volume than<br />
extra regional trade, we all have a deep anid growing Interest In the world<br />
trading system. We need a regional approach which can be reconciled with the<br />
development and strengthening of that system. This Is one of the challenges for<br />
the first WTO Ministerial meeting, when it meets, very appropriately, In<br />
Singapore lsaer this year.<br />
The final rule Is that the region must not become complacent with success.<br />
The challenges to economic growth and to security In this part of the world<br />
remain serious. We will only have a chance of overcoming them If we confront<br />
them directly and with a clear-eyed sense of what they mean for us.<br />
Let me end by speaking In particular about two of those challenges which I<br />
believe should be placed more prominently on the agenda of regionalism In Asia<br />
and the Pacific.<br />
The first of them Is the environment.<br />
Sooner thian many people expect, environmental problems winl begin to affect<br />
not only the degree to which people in Asia and the rest of the APEC region can<br />
enjoy the fruits of recent economic growth, but, more fundamentally, will begin<br />
to impede the extent of that growth.<br />
Demand for food and energy in the region will grow disproportionately as<br />
standards of living rise and expectations Increase. China's demand for food, for<br />
example, is growing so fast that Its shortage within 15 years could be three to<br />
six times Australia's total annual wheat production: just feeding chickens to<br />
vatistY China's demand by 2000 will take more grain than Australia currently<br />
produces. World food production will have to Increase by more than 75 per cent over the<br />
next 30 years if global food security is to be assured.<br />
But significant questions exist about whether the green revolution responsible<br />
for 90 per cent of the great growth in food production over recent decades can<br />
be sustained, and whether we can afford environmentally to sustain It. Heavy<br />
use of fertilisers, Irrigation and pesticides has caused major problems In many<br />
countries. Soil erosion, sallity and pollution of water resources Increasingly<br />
accompany pressure for greater agricultural productivity. </p>
<p>TEL: 17. Jan. 96 15: 58 No. 012 P. 15/ 1' I<br />
The region's ability to sustain high levels of economic growth will also depend<br />
on its capacity to meet the growing demand for energy. By 2010. electricity<br />
demand across the APEC economies Is expected to Increase by between<br />
per cent and 80 per cent. East Asia's demand for energy is doubling every 12<br />
years, compared with 28 years for the world as a whole.<br />
Few people now question the judgement that we are seeing a discernible<br />
human influence on global climate. While to date developed countries have<br />
contributed disproportionately to this problem, by the year 2000 developing<br />
countries are expected to contribute more than half of global C02 emissions,<br />
And much of this will be in Asia.<br />
Today's global population Is expected to grow by 2.6 billion 45 per cent-by<br />
the year 2025. 90 per cent of this increase will take place in developing<br />
countries and 90 per cent of this will be urban. By the end of the century for<br />
the first time in history more people will live in cities and towns than In rural<br />
areas.<br />
The absolute growth of urban environments will be greatest In Asia. The United<br />
Nations estinates that cities in the region will gain 500 million Inhabitants in the<br />
next ten years. By 2025 the Asian region is expected to be predominantly<br />
urban.<br />
This demographic shift will put huge strain on basic services such as water,<br />
sanitation and shelter. Only half the urban populations In Asia currently have<br />
access to water supplies and 42 per cent to sanitation.<br />
The growth of urbanisatlon is being accompanied by a disproportionate growth<br />
in the incidence of poverty In urban areas. Across the Asia-Pacific region,<br />
some 25-35 per cent of urban dwellers are thought to be squatters. To<br />
compound the problem, marginalised urban dwellers often live in ecologically<br />
vulnerable areas.<br />
The environment has become a sensitive Issue in Asia because environmental<br />
arguments have sometimes been used as a disguised form of protectionism by<br />
developed countries. And developing countries have understandably resented<br />
being told by developed countries that they should not do what developed<br />
countries did namely, pass through their period of industrialisatlon without<br />
having to consider the impact on the environment<br />
But we cannot deny the reality of the environmental challenges facing the<br />
region.<br />
We must see protection of the environment in the Asia-Pacific not as an<br />
alternative to economic growth, but as the only thing that will ensure its<br />
continuation. </p>

Sustainable development was neatly defined by the Brundtiand Commission on<br />
the Environment and Development as ' meeting the needs of the present without<br />
compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs'. At its<br />
heart this is or should be a very Asian Issue.<br />
Because if there Is one characteristic which has underpinned Asia's recent<br />
economic growth it has been the willingness of current generations to work for<br />
the future good of the community and postpone Immediate reward. So the Idea<br />
of Inter-generational equity a key to the environment debate is very Asian.<br />
With the environment, as with economic liberailsatlon, we will get further In this<br />
part of the world if we use a flexible and cooperative approach which takes<br />
account of the particular development needs of all the countries In the region.<br />
With its mix of developed and developing country members which have already<br />
demonstrated the political Wil1 to cooperatively tackle some difficult Issues,<br />
APEC may help us find a way through the developing/ developed country divde<br />
which has t Indered progress on environment issues at the international level.<br />
The advalntge we have Is a set of goals and aspirations shared by both<br />
developed and developing countries.<br />
A regional approach to environmental management will also help us to respond<br />
effectively In International forums to European approaches which, while<br />
appropriate to their economic and environmental circumstances, too often<br />
ignore the environmental differences In the Asia Pacific and the different<br />
demands of Industrialising and fast growing economies. It Is important that we<br />
work together to ensure outcomes on International negotiations reflect not only<br />
northern but southern hemisphere realities.<br />
APEC has already adopted framework principles for integrating environmental<br />
considerations into Its overall program and Into the activities of its working<br />
groups and committees. This integrated approach Is essential If environmental<br />
Issues are not to be marginalised,<br />
This was the thinking of the leaders at Osaka when they decided on joint action<br />
to deal with the demand for food and energy and the pressures that will be put<br />
on the environment. </p>

The region's economic expansion and accompanying high rates of Investment<br />
are taking place at a point in history when energy efficient technologies and<br />
processes are widely available. This presents a unique opportunity to get it<br />
right the first time to put in place up-to-date technologies that use materials<br />
and energy efficiently, minimise emissions, improve product quality and reduce<br />
costs. Developing APEC economies currently use 50 per cent more energy to<br />
produce a unit of GDP than developed APEC economies. So, clearly, the<br />
potential gains from Improving efficiency are very substantial.<br />
And significantly, If the region doesn't take up this opportunity It will face not only<br />
an investment bill exceeding SUS1.6 trillion to build the Infrastructure for Its<br />
growth in energy demand by 2010, but the additional costs of fixing avoidable<br />
environmental damage.<br />
Australia is committed to working with countries in the region to avoid this for<br />
example, by addressing emissions, including through the use of energy efficient<br />
or renewable energy technologies. One area with considerable potential Is the<br />
replacement of fossil fuel-based power with photovoltaic ( solar) energy systems.<br />
We are already cooperating with Indonesia on solar energy and the feasibility of<br />
using Aus ralia's leading edge clean coal technology and HI Smelt technology<br />
for its future steel plants.<br />
Integrated management of our natural and urban environments will become<br />
more important as urbanisation intensifies, particularly where hazardous and<br />
Industrial wastes have the potential to Impact on marine and coastal<br />
environments and fisheries. Managing urbanisation in a way which is<br />
ecologically and socially sustainable is one of the key challenges confronting<br />
the region. If we succeed, we will see continued Improvements in our quality of<br />
life. If we fail, we risk slowing economic growth and having to divert resources<br />
to deal with waste and pollution, increased vulnerability to natural disasters and,<br />
eventually, social unrest.<br />
In preparation for the UN's Habitat II conference in June, Australia Is looking at<br />
how we can better utilise our aid program to address the challenges of<br />
urbanisation. Key issues include low cost housing, assistance for squatter<br />
settlements, land use planning, human resource development, support for<br />
micro-enterprises, and Infrastructure development<br />
We need in general to have a much better sense of what is happening to our<br />
land cover. The preparation of Australia's first National Greenhouse Gas<br />
Inventory showed that we were still clearing substantial areas of native<br />
vegetation for agriculture, and thus contributing significantly to our greenhouse<br />
gas emissions. This came as a surprise. It would not have had we been<br />
monitoring overall changes in land coverage. </p>
<p>18<br />
We have now embarked on a major project to monitor agricultural land cover<br />
change using remote sensed data from the Landsat satellite. As far as I know it<br />
Is the biggest project of its type undertaken anywhere. The data, including<br />
maps, resulting from this project will improve our greenhouse gas emission<br />
calculations, providing a basis for better catchment planning, dryland salinity<br />
management and conservation of biodiversity. This is something that should be<br />
done region-wide If we are to improve the quality of global data and provide a<br />
more accurate and comprehensive Information base for global policy making on<br />
climate change.<br />
No Australian Prime Minister is going to claim that getting the balance right<br />
between the Immediate needs of economic growth and the longer-term<br />
requirements of the environment is easy or painless. We have been wrestling<br />
with it In many areas, most recently in our forest policy. But It has to be done<br />
and it will be easier if we can cooperate regionally not just because so many<br />
environmental problems have no regard to national borders, but because we<br />
can make greater progress if we lear from and draw on the experiences of our<br />
neighbours.<br />
A second cfallenge the region faces is in meeting its human resource<br />
developnient needs. President Ramos has already spoken of his hope that<br />
APEC will address this challenge directly during the year of his chairmanship.<br />
The Asia Pacific already faces serious shortages of skilled workers who are vital<br />
for economies that are moving Into export-oriented manufacturing and service<br />
Industries. Thailand, for example, produces only half of the 10,000 engineers it requires<br />
each year. Malaysia estimates it has a shortage of 9,000 engineers and 18,000<br />
engineering assistants. China needs to find two million technically qualified<br />
workers each year, but produces only one million.<br />
Many APEC Governments are already addressing these problems Individually.<br />
Malaysia, for example, is reviewing its entire education structure. And<br />
Hong Kong and Singapore as well as Malaysia are giving higher prionty to<br />
vocational training In secondary schools.<br />
Australia, too, has dramatically increased its investment in education. More<br />
than three quarters of young Australians now complete twelve years of<br />
schooling, and since 1983 we have Increased the number of students at<br />
university by 70 per cent. We are linking education much more closely to<br />
Industry through a new nationwide vocational education and training system.<br />
A regional approach can help strengthen what each of us is doing nationally.<br />

We can make the temporary movement of professional people easier.<br />
We can strengthen existing exchange schemes and cross-accreditation<br />
arrangements for students In different countries.<br />
We can Improve the mutual recognition of professional qualifications, and<br />
Australia has proposed the establishment of an APEC regional skills centre to<br />
facilitate this.<br />
More fundamentally, the resources Invested in education and training will need<br />
to grow throughout the region. And this will be easier If we can encourage cross<br />
investment in education and training among APEC members, as Malaysia Is<br />
doing now.<br />
As I noted eariler, I am quite convinced that we are living through the period of<br />
the most fundamental change in the world for the past century and a half, and<br />
possibly longer,<br />
We may IlVe at the end of the millennium, but we do not live at the end of<br />
history.* And that history the world in the twenty first century the structure and shape<br />
of its International system, the nature of its conflicts, the forms of its cooperation<br />
is being decided now. And here. </p>
