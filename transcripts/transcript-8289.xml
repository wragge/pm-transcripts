f CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
ANNUAL DINNER OF THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN MINING INDUSTRY COUNCIL<br />
CANBERRA 2 MAY 1991<br />
It is a pleasure once more to address AMIC's annual<br />
dinner the eighth occasion on which I have done so<br />
since becoming Prime Minister.<br />
These occasions give me a chance both to brief AMIC on<br />
the major policy~ developments that have occurred in the<br />
previous twelve months and to comment on issues that will<br />
affect your industry and the Australian economy over the<br />
coming year.<br />
Tonight I want to focus my remarks on two issues of very<br />
great significance to the Australian economy and to the<br />
mining industry in particular: the dual imperatives for<br />
Australia to increase its competitiveness and to<br />
integrate our economic development with proper<br />
conservation of our environment.<br />
The choice facing the nation is, as I am sure you<br />
understand, ( quite clear.<br />
If we are to have a modern, prosperous economy and<br />
maintain and improve the quality of life for ourselves<br />
and our children, then we need to build a more<br />
competitive Australia, and to achieve ecologically<br />
sustainable development.<br />
On 12 March delivered to Parliament the Statement<br />
' Building a Competitive Australia'. The statement marked<br />
another important milestone in the economic development<br />
of this country, and provided answers to fundamental<br />
questions about the future of the Australian economy.<br />
The substant: a1 package of measures which I announced was<br />
directed at the basic task of improving our productive<br />
capacity and our international competitiveness. </p>
<p>I<br />
2.<br />
Virtually for as long as Australian industry has existed,<br />
it has been " assisted" by tariffs. " Assistance",<br />
however, as any high school economics student can tell<br />
you, is a misnomer. Tariffs encourage industry to<br />
concentrate on the smaller domestic market rather than<br />
the challenge of international trade they remove the<br />
incentive to develop new technologies and new work and<br />
management skills they have damaged our efficient<br />
export industries, such as mining and agriculture, by<br />
forcing up the-price of inputs in short, instead of<br />
assisting industry, tariffs have retarded it, to the cost<br />
of us all.<br />
The Government's decision to press on with tariff<br />
reductions was a clear signal that the days of national<br />
economic introspection, protected from the challenges of<br />
the outside world, are well and truly over.<br />
The extent of the turn-around we are achieving can be<br />
dramatically measured. By the end of the decade, the<br />
average nominal rate of assistance to the manufacturing<br />
sector will have been brought down from 13 per cent to 3<br />
per cent and the average effective rate from 22 per cent<br />
to 5 per cent.<br />
By lowering the costs of your manufactured inputs, this<br />
measure alone is calculated to increase output in the<br />
mining industry by up to 5 per cent.<br />
And as you know, a number of the other measures I<br />
announced in the March Statement will also benefit the<br />
mining industry. These include the broadening of<br />
wholesale tax exemptions, the provision of tax<br />
deductibility for capital expenses incurred in the<br />
preparation of environmental impact statements, the<br />
introduction of a more favourable depreciation regime,<br />
and the decision to extend duty free entry to mineral<br />
processing equipment not made in Australia. I am pleased<br />
to note that all these changes were welcomed by AMIC.<br />
I should stress that the March Statement's emphasis on<br />
increasing Australian competitiveness was only one<br />
further instalment in the Government's long running<br />
endeavour towards this goal. In particular, it must be<br />
placed in the context of our continuing micro-economic<br />
reform agenda.<br />
I have said before that I am happy for our record on<br />
micro reform to be compared to that of any other<br />
government in Australia's history. We are making, and<br />
are continuing to make, substantial progress in improving<br />
the efficiency of our transport and communications<br />
systems, our taxation system, our workplaces and our<br />
union structures.<br />
As the Federal Government, we are doing, and will<br />
continue to do, what is within the ambit of our power to </p>
<p>do, to move -the process of micro-reform along as quickly<br />
as it can be moved.<br />
But clearly many areas of micro reform requiring<br />
attention do not lie solely in the province of the<br />
Commonwealth Government. Through the Special Premiers'<br />
Conference process we are making historic progress in<br />
ensuring that: all levels of government are cooperating to<br />
improve the efficiency of the public sector as a whole.<br />
No one doubts the size of the task before us, and it is<br />
clear that the massive transformation necessary to<br />
achieve our economic goals is only partially completed.<br />
Nevertheless, it is the case that many of the fundamental<br />
reforms requiLred are well under way.<br />
In this context let me report to you on the outcome of<br />
the negotiat:. ons on the waterfront that I completed only<br />
this morning with the relevant union and employer<br />
organisations. I have been involved with the chequered course of the<br />
waterfront rEform program at various times since last<br />
November, whenever Senator Bob Collins as Minister<br />
responsible felt that I could contribute.<br />
Following thet National Wage Case decision late last<br />
month, the cause of waterfront reform was clearly in<br />
jeopardy. Senator Collins, Senator Cook and I took the<br />
view that a circuit-breaker was required. Both parties<br />
to the waterfront reform process also clearly felt that<br />
such a step was appropriate, and so last week I called<br />
the first of what proved to be an exhausting but<br />
ultimately successful series of meetings.<br />
The elements of that outcome were released today, and in<br />
summary they involve:<br />
continuation of the reform process with an<br />
important role for the Industrial Relations<br />
Commission acceleration of the reform process, by<br />
comparison with any alternative course<br />
an incentive for both parties to co-operate for<br />
the: early delivery of company-based employment;<br />
an award structure suitable to this; and a<br />
base for enterprise bargaining<br />
a means of ensuring that waterfront reform<br />
benefits not only the companies involved<br />
through major productivity gains and those<br />
leaving the industry through generous<br />
redundancy arrangements but also those<br />
remaining in the industry who will, after all,<br />
be working significantly smarter for </p>
<p>themselves, for their companies and for this<br />
country and a reaffirmation of the role of the<br />
Waterfront Industry Reform Authority which was<br />
also involved in these discussions.<br />
I think an indication of the unique success of this<br />
agreement is that it has received support from Conaust<br />
often a stern critic of the pace of reform and from the<br />
unions who are, after all, good judges of their<br />
members' interests. This is a win-win result that surely<br />
puts the lie to those who would abandon the path of<br />
negotiation in favour of harebrained schemes for<br />
confrontation. I know AMIC's interest in waterfront reform is longstanding,<br />
and I respect the consistency of your views.<br />
But I cannot support what has been coyly described as<br />
" more prescriptive alternatives"<br />
The fact is, for users of the waterfront, this negotiated<br />
agreement will yield clear benefits: swifter passage of<br />
essential inputs across the waterfront; and eventually,<br />
I am convinced, lower real rates as companies strive to<br />
obtain greater market share in a newly competitive<br />
atmosphere on the Australian waterfront.<br />
Let me add this final point, because it needs to be well<br />
understood. Competitiveness is not a static concept, so<br />
micro-economic reform will be literally a never ending<br />
process. What it takes to be competitive in 1991 will<br />
not be the same as is required in the year 2000. The<br />
important lesson Australia needs to learn is the habit of<br />
change, so that we can constantly adapt to the constantly<br />
changing circumstances of the world to which our future<br />
is so closely linked.<br />
I am happy for our record on micro reform to be compared<br />
to that of any other Government in Australia's history.<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen,<br />
All these efforts are dedicated to making Australian<br />
industry more competitive. Your industry, I know, has<br />
long been world-competitive. But I referred at the<br />
outset to the dual imperative facing Australia becoming<br />
competitive and putting our economy on a footing that is<br />
ecologically sustainable.<br />
John Kerin and I have spoken at some length at previous<br />
AMIC functions about the need for an integrated approach<br />
to conservation and development. It is a concept with<br />
which no-one disagrees though there is, of course,<br />
always room for discussion about the emphasis that should<br />
be given to its component parts. </p>
<p>Active public debate on sustainable development is in<br />
this regard not only necessary, but also a healthy sign<br />
that organisations are taking the subject seriously.<br />
Last year the Government released a Paper on Ecologically<br />
Sustainable Development as a stimulus for discussion on<br />
this issue. Since then, nine sectoral working groups<br />
have been established to help translate the concept of<br />
ecologically sustainable development into individual<br />
sectoral strategies. The working groups are to complete<br />
their reports by October for consideration at the<br />
November Special Premiers' Conference.<br />
I am encouraged by the progress being made by the ESD<br />
Working Groups, given the complexity of the issues and<br />
the often conflicting interests involved. I am also<br />
confident that the outcome of the process will provide a<br />
sound basis for the Government to make decisions on<br />
future processes and the implementation of appropriate<br />
strategies.<br />
Let me again place on record the Government's<br />
appreciation of the involvement of AMIC in the ESD<br />
process. We have' not forgotten that the mining industry<br />
was one of the first sections of the community to embrace<br />
the concept of sustainable development and to call for<br />
its wider consideration, and your experience and insight<br />
make for a valuable industry contribution to the whole<br />
process.<br />
Your early and general recognition of the importance of<br />
environmental considerations is widely respected and<br />
appreciated. I understand -that the mining working group has been<br />
tackling a raln1ge of difficult issues that have been of<br />
long standing concern to your industry. Naturally there<br />
may be areas w. here agreement will not be reached in the<br />
time allowed, and this will need to be reflected in the<br />
final report. However, I hope that there will be<br />
considerable agreement on many key issues.<br />
Ladies and Gentlemien,<br />
As part of the March Statement, I announced that the<br />
Government had dedided to provide resource security for<br />
major new wood processing projects, involving investment<br />
of $ 100 million or more and which are directed to export<br />
or import rep'lacement. As you know, this decision<br />
aroused a good deal of interest from industry and<br />
conservation organisations alike.<br />
I know there have been suggestions, including from your<br />
industry, tha-: the concept of resource security could be<br />
extended to o-: her industries, notably mining. I want to<br />
use this opportunity to tell you that the Government's<br />
view is that his would not be appropriate and will not<br />
happen. </p>
<p>Let me explain the background to the forestry resource<br />
security issue.<br />
In reaching its decision, the Government was conscious<br />
that the forestry industry has a number of distinctive<br />
characteristics. Forests have multiple functions and<br />
values. They provide timber for wood production; they<br />
have important roles in protecting water catchments and<br />
providing habitats for wildlife; they serve as recreation<br />
areas for public enjoyment. It goes almost without<br />
saying that they occupy very large areas of land.<br />
These various unique characteristics need to be carefully<br />
weighed in any development decision. And indeed, the<br />
resource security decision in no way reduces the<br />
Government's commitment to proper environmental, heritage<br />
and other safeguards.<br />
Eligible projects will be subject to a comprehensive<br />
integrated assessment process. Existing environmental,<br />
heritage and Aboriginal legislation will be fully<br />
applied, up front, so that the project proponent will<br />
have the security of knowing that once the assessment is<br />
completed and approved, no action will be taken down the<br />
track to remove part of their resource except in<br />
specified exceptional circumstances.<br />
So the Government's commitment to the proper protection<br />
of forests remains firm. But we recognised that in<br />
part due to this consistent commitment to proper<br />
safeguards there had been a reduction in the forest<br />
resources allocated to existing operations in the<br />
industry. This situation put the forest industry in a unique<br />
position, and it was on this basis that the industry<br />
claimed that a crisis of confidence existed in the<br />
industry and that future investment was dependent on the<br />
Commonwealth providing resource security legislation. In<br />
view of the importance of having major value-added<br />
projects come forward, and the general economic<br />
circumstances Australia faces, this was clearly a problem<br />
which the Government had to address.<br />
At the same time we obtained legal advice that resource<br />
security legislation was the only way the Commonwealth<br />
could provide a binding undertaking of the kind sought to<br />
get major wood processing projects started. Given these<br />
circumstances, the Commonwealth decided to give an<br />
undertaking that it was prepared to introduce such<br />
legislation on a case by case basis.<br />
I stress that this difficult decision was made only in<br />
response to a unique set of circumstances. As such,<br />
there can be no application of the concept of this<br />
legislation to other industries. </p>
<p>Having said that, I do recognise the need for a greater<br />
degree of certainty in relation to access and approval<br />
processes for the mining industry.<br />
The division of responsibilities between the different<br />
levels of government has long been a concern of industry.<br />
It can lead to duplication or inconsistent approaches,<br />
with resulting uncertainties, inefficiencies and higher<br />
costs to both industry and the community generally. It<br />
can also result in inadequate protection of the<br />
environment. With this in mind, the Special Premiers' Conference last<br />
year agreed that a more cooperative approach to the<br />
environment should be pursued. This is being done<br />
through negotiation of an Intergovernmental Agreement on<br />
the Environment. The agreement will include provisions<br />
for the streamlining of environmental assessment and<br />
other approval processes which will facilitate greater<br />
certainty of Government and business decision making.<br />
It is planned that drafting of the Agreement will be<br />
completed in time for consideration at the November<br />
Special Premiers' Conference.<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen,<br />
The Resource Assessment Commission Report on the Future<br />
Use of Resources of the Kakadu Conservation Zone was<br />
received by the Government today and will be released<br />
publicly next: week. The fact that this will be the first<br />
report completed by the Commission since its<br />
establishment in 1989 has given it additional prominence.<br />
I know that both the mining industry and the conservation<br />
movement see the Government's final decision on the<br />
Kakadu Conservation Zone as something of a litmus test.<br />
Industry executives have indicated that a ' no mining'<br />
decision could have a substantial impact on investor<br />
confidence in mining and could result in mineral<br />
exploration activity moving overseas. On the other hand,<br />
conservationists and Aboriginal groups see our<br />
forthcoming decision as another test of the Government's<br />
bona fides on the issues of importance to them.<br />
It is of course, inappropriate and, in any case<br />
premature, fcr me to speculate on what the Government's<br />
final decisicn might be. However, I would like briefly<br />
to address scme of the underlying concerns, and in doing<br />
so to show that whatever our ultimate decision on this<br />
issue, it in no way can be construed as a litmus test for<br />
other issues.<br />
The mining industry in general was critical of the<br />
original decision to have the Resource Assessment<br />
Commission inquire into this issue. It has been argued </p>
<p>that this particular reference was too project-specific,<br />
and fell outside the stated purpose of the RAC.<br />
No one would be naive enough to deny that this particular<br />
issue has been a difficult one for the Government. it<br />
involves an extraordinary range of very complex and<br />
sensitive resource, environmental and Aboriginal issues.<br />
The Kakadu Conservation Zone covers an area, including<br />
Coronation Hill, that has great mineral potential and<br />
could produce very significant export income for<br />
Australia. Part of the area is also a registered sacred<br />
site and is currently subject to an Aboriginal land claim<br />
as well as an application under the Aboriginal and Torres<br />
Strait Islander ( Heritage Protection) Act. The area is<br />
also environmentally significant, surrounded by a<br />
National Park and located in the catchment of the South<br />
Alligator river that feeds important wetlands in the<br />
Kakadu World Heritage Area.<br />
These factors were sufficiently complex to warrant very<br />
careful examination by an independent body that could<br />
study the competing claims as well as provide any further<br />
relevant information to enable us to make an informed<br />
decision. The Resource Assessment Commission was an entirely<br />
appropriate organisation to carry out this task. We<br />
specifically established it to inquire into complex<br />
conservation-development issues. The fact that this<br />
inquiry covered only a relatively small area of land does<br />
not mean that the issues are any less complex. I have no<br />
doubt that Justice Stewart would agree with this view.<br />
So the Kakadu Conservation Zone is truly a special case,<br />
involving a combination of complex and sensitive issues<br />
which would only rarely occur in most mining projects.<br />
Irrespective of the final outcome, any claims that the<br />
Government's decision will set policy parameters for<br />
future mining projects in this country are simply not<br />
supported by the facts.<br />
The Kakadu decision will have no implications for the<br />
overwhelming majority of mining projects in this country.<br />
These will continue to be subject to normal environmental<br />
and other approval processes.<br />
I acknowledge that resolution of the Kakadu matter has<br />
taken substantially longer than we originally envisaged.<br />
Now that the RAC report has been completed, the<br />
Government will be moving to make a final decision<br />
without undue delay. We wish to avoid any further<br />
uncertainty about the future of the Conservation Zone and<br />
the Coronation Hill project.<br />
In view of the very extensive consultative process that<br />
we have pursued, it is not the Government's intention to </p>
<p>seek further public comments on the final report.<br />
Nevertheless, Ministers will be consulting with key<br />
interest groups to ascertain their reactions to the<br />
report. In the final analysis the Government will weigh<br />
the different considerations and take a decision which we<br />
judge to be in the long term interests of the community<br />
as a whole.<br />
I expect the Government's final decision will be made by<br />
early next month.<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen,<br />
In concluding, I want to assure you that the Government<br />
does recognise the vital contribution that the mining<br />
industry makes to Australia's economy. We are striving<br />
to provide a framework conducive to your continued<br />
success in the future.<br />
We will continue the task of reshaping our society and<br />
economy through tackling the tough issues of structural<br />
reform and the equally tough issue of dragging Australian<br />
attitude into the 21st century.<br />
As the Prime Minister, I give you my unqualified<br />
commitment that my Government will continue to build a<br />
competitive and an ecologically sustainable economic base<br />
for our nation.<br />
Present and future generations expect no less of us than<br />
this. I am sure that the mining industry will continue to play<br />
its important role in meeting these challenges and<br />
building that future. </p>
