ENMOBTA GOT: O BE RELEASED BEFORE 6 P. M. ( EST) ON 16/ 10/ 67.<br />
FOR PRESS: CL LI lR A V0 P. MV.. No. 106/ 1967<br />
MINISTERIAL CHANGES<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr. Harold Holt<br />
The Minister for Primary Industry, Mr. Adermann, has<br />
asked to be relieved of his duties as Minister for Primary<br />
Industry as from today. His resignation has been accepted by<br />
the Governor-General.<br />
Mr. J. D. Anthony, up till now the Minister for the<br />
Interior, has been appointed to the Primary Industry portfolio<br />
and Mr. P. J. Nixon, the Member for Gippsland, has been appointed<br />
to the Ministry and will take over from Mr. Anthony as Minister<br />
for the Interior. The two Ministers were sworn in their new<br />
offices by the Governor-General this afternoon.<br />
It is a matter of deep regret to me and my colleagues<br />
in the Cabinet that Mr. Adermann has felt it necessary to resign<br />
to ease his load of work. We have all respected the able manner<br />
in which he has discharged the duties of a difficult portfolio<br />
for so many years. I know that this high opinion of his work is<br />
widely held, and nowhere more strongly than in those primary<br />
industries for whose prosperity and welfare he has worked so<br />
devotedly. Mr. Anthony comes to the Primary Industry portfolio<br />
with a wealth of knowledge of the land and its problems.<br />
I have invited 1dr. Sinclair to become a member of the<br />
Cabinet and he will continue administration of his portfolio of<br />
Social Services in which appointment he has shown great ability.<br />
Mr. Nixon's promotion is well earned, and he will be a<br />
welcome addition to the Ministry.<br />
I announce also a change in the Leadership of the<br />
Government in the Senate.<br />
Senator Henty, who had proviously announced his decision<br />
to retire from the Senate at the expiry of his current term, wrote<br />
to me recently saying that in the circumstances he thought a change<br />
should be made in the leadership in order that the Government<br />
Senate Leader in the forthcoming election campaign might have<br />
continuity of office.<br />
Senator Gorton, at my request, has agreed to assume<br />
responsibility as Government Leader in the Senate.<br />
I would like publicly, as I have done privately, to<br />
thank Senator Henty for the able and devoted service he has given<br />
the Government through his years of leadership in the Senate. I<br />
have asked him to continue as a member of the Cabinet in his<br />
present portfolio.<br />
CANBERRA 16th October, 1967.<br />
