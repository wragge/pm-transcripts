PARTIAL TRANSCRIPT, MORNING EXTRa, SYDNEY<br />
26 APRIL 1984<br />
E. O. E. -PROOF ONLY<br />
it's very hard to make any comments upon Dr Caldicott's<br />
own comments because they are so emotional and many of them<br />
false. Obviously Dr Caldicott received some different advice<br />
after her initial outburst because she was reported as saying<br />
quite different things at the rally subsequently about myself<br />
and what I could do and so on. I think that the subject is such<br />
anl important one that it warrants rational discussion and not;<br />
emotional falsehoods and that's why I am rather pleased at the nature<br />
of the debate that has developed actually within the Labor Party<br />
which had previously tended to be highly emotional and has now<br />
reached a more senisible level.<br />
QUESTITON: A quarter of a million, or approximately a quarter<br />
of a million Australians marching on the issue must mean something<br />
then, Well, what does it mean to you?<br />
QUESTION: Well, how do you look at it electorally?<br />
Well, a quarter of a million marching what's the Australian<br />
voting population?<br />
QUESTION: But do you discount that then?<br />
It's not a question of discounting, I simply try to be<br />
rational and calm about these things. If I find-. that there<br />
are a quarter of a million people or 200,000 or 150,000 whatever<br />
the number is and there are great varieties in the estimate.<br />
You've got to put that in the context of alot of people who<br />
werbenht marching. If you talk about that particular issue<br />
uranium mining, it seems to me to be much more rational to look<br />
at the latest scientific poll that we've done on it. And that<br />
shows a very, very clear majority of Australians in favour of the<br />
policy ' of the Government not only a majority of Australians,<br />
a majority of Labor voters. Now.. ask me the question about -that,<br />
what's the significance of that for the election. Is that the<br />
more significant thing to look at that than number of people<br />
marching? QUESTION But does it...<br />
Look, are we here to have a debete about uranium and the<br />
Government's policies on it?<br />
J" Aft </p>
<p>QUESTION: Well, we are looking at the uranium question,<br />
Yee. The ABC has tackled this question once already, in a<br />
way in which it put its line. Now, if we are going to be here<br />
in a situation of you putting the anti-uranium line then that's<br />
O. K. with me, but I didn't think thats what this is about.<br />
QUESTION: Well, we are here to discuss many issues<br />
with Labor Party policy<br />
Good, well let's get on with it then.<br />
QUESTION: This is one of the latest issues that~ has come up,, and<br />
uranium has concerned alot of people, enough people to march<br />
250,000 people to march.<br />
Look, let's be quite clear about this. We've handled that<br />
you talked about it, you put the argument about 250,000 people.<br />
I put the proposition to you about a poll.. Now, you want to<br />
keep coming back and saying there is something that is significant<br />
and decisive about a number of people that marched. Now I've put<br />
the overall poll figure to you. Nlow, if you want to keep<br />
arguing the anti-uranium case and implications of marching -do so<br />
and it will be another example of the way in which on this program,<br />
this institution is going to push a particular line.<br />
QUESTION: Mr Hawke, ABC biased questions, you've mentioned th~ e<br />
ABC. In recent weeks you've criticised the ABC for bias against<br />
the Federal Government, and the Labor Party. Can you give us<br />
specific examples of that line?<br />
Again, it's a pity you couldn't get your facts straight..<br />
I wasn't talking about bias against the Labor Party. I talked.<br />
about bias I am certainly not going to engage in a discussion<br />
with you about bias on the ABC. I believe that Mr Whitehead may<br />
be meeting with me. If he wants to raise the question, I'll<br />
talk about it with him if he wants to.<br />
QUESTION: You asked the ABC . to approach you to talk about the<br />
question of bias?<br />
No, I didn't.<br />
QUESTION: How did the proposed meeting you just mentioned<br />
come about then, or the possibility of<br />
I think that's a matter for the management of the ABC<br />
and myself. It's not a matter for discussion on your program.<br />
QUESTION: You said that we ' didn't get our facts right concerning<br />
bias, you mentioned biAs on the ABC, then what were the facts?<br />
I am not here to discuss the issue of ABC bias with you.<br />
If Mr Whitehead wants to discuss the matter with me, that's where<br />
I'll discuss it. I'm not going to discuss it on your program.<br />
QUESTION: You don't think the ABC is biased or you do think it's<br />
biased?* </p>
<p>I don't know whether you want tolachieve a situation<br />
similar to something that occurred before it seems as though<br />
you want to. I'm not going to satisfy your desire in that<br />
regard. I have answered your question on this twice, do you<br />
want me to answer it again or are we going to occupy the time<br />
between now and 10.45 with you asking the same question and<br />
me answering it. isn't twice enough?<br />
QUESTION: Perhaps you'd prefer somne calls Mr Hawke. </p>
