<p>The Australian Government will give $ A750,000 as a cash contribution towards relief operations in Mexico. All Australians will have been shocked by the extent of the disaster and the human toll resulting from the earthquakes over the last few days.</p>
<p>The Australian Ambassador in Mexico City has already announced an initial contribution of $ USl00,000  Tonight's donation will be in addition to that. </p>
<p>The Australian Government has received close support from the Canadian Foreign Ministry in restoring communications with the Australian Embassy in Mexico City so that it can check on the welfare of Australian citizens in Mexico. This is part of a co-operative arrangement being developed with the Canadians in consular matters. The Government appreciates this Canadian assistance.</p>
<p>Officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs have been receiving inquiries all weekend from people with relatives and friends in Mexico.</p>
