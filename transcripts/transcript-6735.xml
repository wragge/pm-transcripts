<p>The Australian Government will give $ A750,000 as a cashÂ contribution towards relief operations in Mexico. AllÂ Australians will have been shocked by the extent of theÂ disaster and the human toll resulting from the earthquakesÂ over the last few days.</p>
<p>The Australian Ambassador in Mexico City has alreadyÂ announced an initial contribution of $ USl00,000Â Â Tonight'sÂ donation will be in addition to that.Â </p>
<p>The Australian Government has received close support from theÂ Canadian Foreign Ministry in restoring communications with theÂ Australian Embassy in Mexico City so that it can check onÂ the welfare of Australian citizens in Mexico. This is partÂ of a co-operative arrangement being developed with theÂ Canadians in consular matters. The Government appreciatesÂ this Canadian assistance.</p>
<p>Officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs have beenÂ receiving inquiries all weekend from people with relativesÂ and friends in Mexico.</p>
