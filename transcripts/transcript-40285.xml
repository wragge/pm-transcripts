    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Gateway WA project has been completed almost a year ahead of schedule and under budget.</p>
<p>This project has delivered a safer and more efficient transport network around Perth Airport and the freight and industrial areas of Kewdale and Forrestfield.</p>
<p>The Gateway WA project is the largest road project undertaken in Perth to date which was jointly funded through a $676 million investment from the Federal Government and $310 million from the Western Australian Government.</p>
<p>The project, which at its peak employed over 1,000 construction workers, delivers a fully upgraded road network around Perth Airport and nearby Forrestfield and Kewdale industrial estates.</p>
<p>As a result, the Gateway WA project means commuters and businesses have better and safer access to the airport and surrounding industrial areas.</p>
<p>This is another example of the Australian and state governments working together to build world-class infrastructure that will help unlock the economic capacity of Western Australia.</p>
<p>The Gateway WA project involved the construction and upgrade of five main interchanges, widening Tonkin Highway to six lanes between Great Eastern Highway and Roe Highway and upgrading Leach Highway between Tonkin Highway and Orrong Road to expressway standard.</p>
<p>It incorporates road and bridge improvements, around 21 kilometres of shared path and local connections for pedestrians and cyclists, approximately seven kilometres of noise/screen walls, a major landscaping program and the use of Intelligent Transport System technology.</p>
<p>The Gateway WA project will ease congestion, improve safety and reduce delays for the thousands of road users who access the airport and surrounding areas every day.</p>
<p>The road network now has the capacity to cater for increasing demand. The number of passengers travelling to and from Perth Airport is expected to double in the next decade and freight transport movements within the Kewdale Industrial Precinct are also expected to double by 2030.</p>
<p>The Gateway WA project was delivered by an alliance consisting of CPB Contractors (formerly Leighton Contractors), Georgiou, GHD, AECOM and BG&amp;E, together with Main Roads Western Australia.</p>
