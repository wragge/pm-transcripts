FOR PRESS 19 FEBRUARY 1977<br />
JOIN7 STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER AND THE ACTING PREMIER<br />
OF VICTORIA, THE HONOURABLE L. H. S. THOMPSON, CMG, MP<br />
NEW NATIONAL HIGHWAY SIGN UNVEILED<br />
The first of Australia's new National Highway roadside identification<br />
signs was officially unveiled by the Prime Minister, Mr. Fraser,<br />
on the Hume Highway near Wodonga today.<br />
The Acting Premier of Victoria, Mr. L. H. S. Thompson, and the<br />
Commonwealth Minister for Transport, Mr. Peter Nixon, attended.<br />
A joint statement issued by Mr. Fraser and Mr. Thompson described<br />
the sign as a symbol of Commonwealth-State co-operation in roads<br />
matters, particularly in the area of National Highways.<br />
" It is appropriate that the first sign should be on the Hume<br />
Highway one of Australia's most important road links, linking<br />
as it does the two major cities of the Commonwealth," they said.<br />
" The Commonwealth and the States believe that National Highways<br />
which are vital to the Australian economy as a whole should<br />
be specially identified.<br />
" As result, all Governments have co-operated in the design of<br />
signs which will clearly indicate this recognition to travellers<br />
on the system."<br />
It proposed that the first of the new signs would be<br />
at points on each National Highway near the boundary of each<br />
capital city.<br />
The signs would be six-by-eight feet and, against a gri,, n<br />
background, would carry the Australian Coat of Arms, map of<br />
Australia, and the words " Australian National Highways" in<br />
reflecting yellow paint.<br />
It was also proposed to replace existing highway route mar-kers<br />
in the same green and gold colours following a trial introdi.-, tion<br />
on the Humne Highway between Wangaratta ( Vie.) and Holb: ool..<br />
and on the National Highway east of Adelaide. / The Commonwea lt: h<br />
I </p>
<p>The Commonwealth Government has allocated almost $ 400 million<br />
to the States for spending on National Highways in the period<br />
1974-77.<br />
The total National Highway system which covered more than<br />
16,000 kilometres connected all Australian capital cities<br />
and serviced important centres of trade,-commerce, mining and<br />
recreation.<br />
Under the National Roads Act, the States were eligible for<br />
financial assistance for approved construction works on declared<br />
National Highways.<br />

Liberal Party Regional Convention and other official engagements.<br />
