FOR PRESS 23 SEPTEMBER 1976<br />
ADVISORY COUNCIL FOR INTER-GOVERNMENT RELATIONS<br />
This Bill provides for the establishment of an Advisory<br />
Council for Inter-Government Relationz.<br />
The formation of the Advisory Council is a further step in<br />
the implementation of our programme of reform to improve<br />
the functioing of Australia's political institutions.<br />
Honourable Members wil.-by now be familiar with the main<br />
thrust of that programme. It is designed to strengthen the<br />
federal system by giving the states and local government<br />
an assured source of revenue; by matching revenue to<br />
responsibilities and by a more appropriate allocation of<br />
functions among governments.<br />
The Advisory Council gives life to the Government's commitment<br />
as outlines in our federalism policy statement of September 1975.<br />
The Council should be looked at in the context of our overall<br />
federalism reforms. These reforms attempt to restore a proper<br />
balance bez.; een responsibilities and finances in Australia.<br />
The work of the Council will supplement other reforms, such<br />
as our tax sharing proposals which will be the subject of<br />
separate legislation soon to be put before this House.<br />
The Advisory Council is intended to bring together representatives<br />
of the Commonwealth, state and local Governments and private<br />
citizens to review and consider matters relating to the<br />
improvement of cooperation between the different spheres of<br />
government. The Council will operate under the Premiers Conference.<br />
By reference from the Premiers' Conference, the Advisory<br />
Council will examine problems which emerge between the various<br />
spheres of government. Under the Premiers' Conference the<br />
Council will give continuing attention to the range of<br />
intergovernmental problems in the federal, state and local<br />
government spheres.<br />
It will be a most important source of advice on the most<br />
desirable allocation of governmental functions, responsibilities<br />
and revenues. .12 </p>
<p>The Bill provides for a Council of 22 members:<br />
five representatives of the Commonwealth ( three Government<br />
Members and two Opposition Members six state<br />
representaitives ( one from-each state Parliament);<br />
six local government representatives; and five citizen<br />
representatives.<br />
Three Commonwealth Government representatives will be<br />
nominated by the Prime Minister, two will be nominated by<br />
the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives.<br />
So -far as the local government membership is concerned,<br />
the states agreed to three local government representatives.<br />
We regret having to increase that numbe-r without the prior<br />
agreement of the states but we have come to the conclusion<br />
that six representatives of local government are necessary<br />
for-the effective operation of the Council and for the<br />
reasonable presentation of local government.<br />
So far as is practicable, the six local government members<br />
should be persons associcated with local government in<br />
different states.<br />
Citizen representatives to the Council will be selected<br />
by the Commoi.: wqealth Government in consultation withthe States.<br />
The Chairman of the Council will be one of the five citizen<br />
members. Members will normally have a three year term.<br />
Provision is also mad-in . the Bill for the appointment of deputy<br />
memb.-rs, and attendance by one observer from each of the<br />
Northern Territory and the Australian Capital territory Assemblies.<br />
The body will be-distinctly bipartisan and the Government<br />
wishes to ensure that its independence is preserved. The<br />
Council is clearly not dominated by numbers of Commonwealth<br />
representatives. The Council will fulfil its function best<br />
if its members approach their tasks with a broad perspective,<br />
considering Australian Government as a whole system.<br />
The Body which this Bill proposes to establish has been modelled on<br />
the Uh'ited States Advisory Commission on Inter-governmental rela-tions. 7<br />
The United States Advisory Commission is a 17 year-old<br />
bipartisan body in which representatives of national, state and<br />
local governments and private citizens study the operations of<br />
the federal system in the United States.<br />
The American commission conducts studies and investigations<br />
of specific inter-governmental conflict points and drafts<br />
proposed legislation and administrative orders to carry out its<br />
recommendations. The Commission is a successful and highly<br />
respected body which has done much to improve the American Federation.. </p>
<p>It is our intention that the Australian counterpart<br />
also establish itself as an independent and highly respected<br />
body. The Bill to establish the Council provides that the Premiers'<br />
Conference, or a majority of Governments participating<br />
may request the Council to institute inquiries. Local<br />
government, throught their state Premiers will be able to<br />
have matters brought to the Premiers' Conference<br />
for reference to the Council for examination and report.<br />
This Bill makes provision for the Advisory Council to furnish<br />
reports of its inquiries and investigations to the Prime Minister,<br />
to the Premier of each participating State and to the Australian<br />
Council of Local Government-Associations.<br />
The Advisory Council is also required to make an annual report<br />
on its activities. This report will be made public by being<br />
laid before both Houses of this Parliament within 15 sitting<br />
days after the Prime Minister'has received a copy.<br />
This Bill is the result of a great deal of consultation and<br />
thought. All State Premiers, as well as the Australian Council<br />
of Local Government Assoiations, have had an opprotunity to<br />
comment on the proposed Council which has been modified in the<br />
light of their comments. The Charter of the Advisory Council<br />
was approved at the April Premiers' Confrence. And before<br />
that Senator Carrick discussed details of the Council with<br />
State Ministers.<br />
The costs of the Council will be shared by agreement among the<br />
three spheres of Government. At present it is intended that<br />
the Commone iltb and the States each meet 45% of the Council's<br />
cost, the remaining 10% being contributed by local government.<br />
Since this arrangement may be subject to change or re-negotiation<br />
as the Council develops it has not been written into the Bill.<br />
Honourable Mlembers will also note that the Bill contains no<br />
reference to staffing. This is to ensure maximum flexibility<br />
and the opportunity for participation by officers drawn from all<br />
spheres of Government.<br />
A Secretariat to service the Council will be based in Hobart.<br />
The staff iill be small in number but of a calibre which will assist<br />
the Council to achieve the status and presitge which we envisage<br />
for it. 1here necessary, it is hoped that other people and<br />
institutions can be used to research proposals.<br />
The Secretariat will be based in Hobart. While the initial<br />
meetings will be in Hobart, when the Council is well established<br />
it is expected that it will feel free to meet in other centres<br />
around Australia.<br />
An important role of the Council will be to promote discussion<br />
and disseminate ideas. To reach a wide audience and to present<br />
to that audience an independent view on possible solutions<br />
to problems of inter-government relations. </p>
<p>4.<br />
Such a role should do much to dispel the notion,' so prevalent<br />
in recent years, that all wisdom resides at the centre.<br />
The Council possesses only advisory powers. The Council<br />
does not exist to pre-empt the . decisions of governments.<br />
It exists to provide an effective vehicle to encourage<br />
public debate on the practical resolution of problems<br />
facing governments in Australia.<br />
It exists to make Governments fully aware of the options which<br />
face them. The Governments concerned will be solely<br />
responsible for the decisions they make.<br />
