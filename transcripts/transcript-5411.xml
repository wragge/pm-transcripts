FOR MEDIA PRIMEY MIIS E AUGUST, 1980<br />
ADDRESS TO SECOND ASEAN TPADE FAIR<br />
MELBOURNE<br />
The welcome I extend to you today, on behalf of the<br />
Australian Government, is a very sincere and warm one.<br />
This fair brings us another step foward, not only in confirming<br />
the strength of the existing relationship between our countries<br />
and our Governments: but also in confirming the growing<br />
importance we place on this relationshi p. Through this fair,<br />
ASEAN Governments and business leaders are given an important<br />
promotional opportunity for their products in the Australian<br />
market. These ties between Australia and ASEAN have developed rapidly.<br />
Thirty years ago, we knew relatively little of each other.<br />
our colonial histories were quite different. Australia developed<br />
much of her trade under imperial preferences. We depended<br />
almost entirely on our income from rural products.<br />
As Australia underwent post-war development of its economy, the<br />
countries of Asia, particularly South-East Asia, became markets<br />
for our developing manufacturing industry, our commodities and<br />
our raw materials. This brought more and more Australian<br />
businessmen and Government leaders into contact with South-East<br />
Asia. Our trade links were beginning to develop; and they have<br />
matured during a period of great change for our economy and<br />
those of the South-East Asian countries.<br />
Now, your countries have developed as a significant and growing<br />
economic force. You are enjoying rapid industrialisation; and,<br />
in a difficult world economic environment, you have generally<br />
enjoyed sound growth rates.<br />
For our part, Australia has been successful in containing inflation;<br />
in providing a stable economic environment; and in promoting<br />
the co-ordinated and responsible development of our natural<br />
resources. As a result, Australia is a net energy exporter; an<br />
advantage which adds significantly to our long standing status<br />
as an important raw material producer.<br />
These new circumstances in'which we are placed, mean that the<br />
challenges of the new decade contain great opportunities for<br />
us all. </p>
<p>-2<br />
We, in Australia, see our continuing capacity to take advantage<br />
of these opportunities, as being dependent upon our encouragement<br />
of the competitive instinct. Because, for us all, in Government<br />
and in business, we will need to adopt a truly international<br />
outlook and become competitive beyond our own shores.<br />
The strategy of looking mainly to the domestic market, appropriate<br />
in the early stages of industrial development, is not the<br />
strategy which will take us successfully through the<br />
There is no going back to it. The fears of the decade ahead only<br />
exist for those who want to meet it with the solutions of<br />
the past.<br />
Great changes have taken place in recent times in the<br />
international economic and energy order. None of these changes<br />
are temporary. Those who imagine them to be so merely yearn<br />
for a. past where business and industrial life was safe and<br />
more comfortable.<br />
We believe that Australia's economic machinery is geared to move<br />
us confidently ahead. And Australian industry is already<br />
making successful adjustments in a wide range of areas. There<br />
is already, underpinning many of the industrial projects of the<br />
future, an outward-looking, forward-thinking, progressive sense<br />
of management. Figures bear witness to the success of our<br />
relationship with ASEAN countries.<br />
Two-wfy trade between Australia and ASEAN ha s increased<br />
substantially in recent years, despite international<br />
economic problems. In the calendar year ended December 1979, this<br />
trade was ever $ 2 billion, more than double the level of<br />
1975/ 76. From the early 70s, while Australia's exports to ASEAN<br />
have grown steadily, our imports from ASEAN have expanded rapidly<br />
at a rate of around 35% per annum. almost twice the annual rate<br />
of growth of imports from all sources. In the same period, the<br />
growth rate of imported manufactured products from ASEAN countries<br />
has been just as dramatic, running at an annual average growth<br />
rate of over 40%: a rate much higher than that for our total<br />
imports of manufactures.<br />
With the textiles, clothing and footwear industries, often the<br />
target of criticism about perceived Australian protectionism,<br />
the picture is very much the same. ASEAN has enjoyed a rapid<br />
penetration of the Australian market for textiles, clothing and<br />
footwear, with imports rising from $ 2 million in 1971 to $ 55 million<br />
in 1978-9. When one considers that our total imports in these<br />
areas were more than $ 1,200 million in 1978/ 79, it is clear that<br />
there is still considerable scope for ASEAN to improve its<br />
share of the import market.<br />
In value terms, imports account for about 32 per cent of the<br />
Australian market for textiles; and over 22 per cent of the<br />
market for clothing. This is a much higher penetration than in<br />
the Japan and the E. E. C. In the case of clothing, the<br />
penetration in these countries is estimated to be between 8 and<br />
13 per cent; for textiles 2 to 14 per cent. By these standards<br />
our market is more open than those of these advanced industrialised<br />
countries. / 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
From the existing base, the potential for expansion of<br />
trade between Australia and the ASEAN countries is<br />
very great. ASEAN includes some of the fastest growing<br />
economies in the world, with extensive sales to developed<br />
countries. This~ growth, together with the realities of the<br />
new international energy order, means that, more and more,<br />
Australia is becoming a significant supplier of both energy<br />
and raw materials to our neighbours in the Asia/ Pacific region.<br />
As these countries widen and deepen their industrial base,<br />
t here will be greater demands for Australian raw materials<br />
and energy. At the same time, successful, competitive producers<br />
in ASEAN, and Asia, will be able to take advantage of the<br />
opportunities for imports in the Australian markets.<br />
It is my Government's determination to develop, to the<br />
greatest possible extent, trade within the region. For this<br />
purpose, through the Australia/ ASEAN economic co-operation<br />
programme, the Australian Government is providing considerable<br />
funds to assist ASEAN countries to explore the potential for<br />
their goods in Australian markets.<br />
The Australian Government, in 1974, established a market advisory<br />
service to assist producers in developing countries in<br />
investigating market prospects. And I am pleased to note that<br />
ASEAN countries have been significant users of this service.<br />
Apart from this promotional assistance, developing countries<br />
enjoy preferential tariffs to encourage our importers to<br />
consider new sources of supply.<br />
The five ASEAN countries provide a significant share of the<br />
total Australian imports coming in under this system. In June<br />
of this year, the ASEAN/ Australian Business Council was<br />
established between the ASEAN Chambers of Commerce and Industry<br />
and the Confederation of Australian Industry and Australian<br />
Chambers of Commerce. This should provide a worthwhile forum<br />
for expansion of business links between Australia and ASEAN.<br />
Further indications of the increased importance of these links<br />
between our countries can be guaged from investment figures.<br />
A decade ago, Australian investment in the ASEAN countries was<br />
relatively insignificant $ 1 million new Australian investment<br />
in 1969/ 70. In 1978/ 79, new Australian investment in the region<br />
had risen to $ 41 million, representing nearly one-fifth of the<br />
total outflow of Australian investment abroad in that year. All<br />
of this highlights a positive programme of continuing progress<br />
and adjustment, occurring throughout many sectors of our economies.<br />
And this can only be to our mutual advantage. This advantage<br />
will increase in the future, through Government and industry<br />
identifying their respective responsibilities.<br />
The essential role of Government will continue to be one of<br />
creating institutional machinery and a broad economic policy<br />
framework in which market forces can operate. We take the view<br />
that Government can not replace the key role of investors and<br />
company managers in deciding where capital will be directed; in<br />
determining which companies and industries will successfully carry<br />
new projects to completion and subsequent profit; in anticipating<br />
which products can compete effectively in a tough and changing<br />
trading scene. </p>
<p>-4<br />
Where appropriate, we are prepared, and should provide,<br />
incentives to our industries. But the main engine of growth<br />
and progress must be our private sector. I have great<br />
confidence in the capacity of our business managers to recognise<br />
the changes in the external environment and to perceive the<br />
new trading and investment opportunities which these changes<br />
are creating. Th-e historical lesson of Australian industry is<br />
that successful management is management which adjusts.<br />
Australian economic strength will continue to depend on<br />
the Government's capacity to provide the environment in which<br />
entrepreneurs, business managers and farmers can create, or<br />
build upon, industries capable of competing effectively in<br />
the trading world.<br />
One of the great advantages of this Fair is that it gives, to<br />
ASEAN . Government and business leaders, firsthand knowledge<br />
and experience of what is happening in Australian industry<br />
and the Australian economy. But, just as important, the<br />
ASEAN Trade Fair enables our Government and business leaders<br />
to become aware of how we should approach the ASEAN economies<br />
with a full understanding of what they can provide; of the<br />
opportunities they offer; and of the directions being taken<br />
in their development.<br />
This is essential, not just because we are neighbours and have<br />
a mutual interest in economic development. It is also essential<br />
because this decade has already indicated to us the need for<br />
heightened regional security. And our ability to co-operate in<br />
trade and development promotes trust and co-operation at the<br />
political and diplomatic level.<br />
However, this Fair is more than just a trade promotion activity.<br />
It is a symbol of the close co-operation and friendship between<br />
Australia and the ASEAN nations. For over a year now, many<br />
people have worked towards this occasion. Australian and ASEAN<br />
Government officials have collaborated closely in the design and<br />
promotion of the display.<br />
It has brought together Ministers from the countries of ASEAN<br />
and Australia in an atmosphere of good will and co-operation.<br />
What we have before us, is the result of the work of many<br />
people from our region, united in a common purpose.<br />
I have no doubt that the week ahead will reinforce and<br />
strengthen the growing ties between our countries of which<br />
this Fair is a practical expression. I have much pleasure<br />
in declaring this Second ASEAN Trade Fair officially open.<br />
