PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 6 April 1983<br />
Since the National Economic Summit was first proposed,<br />
one of its central features has been its role as an<br />
information-sharing occasion.<br />
In line with my commitment to provide a range of information,<br />
three documents with which the Government has been involved<br />
in the preparation of have been sent to participants.<br />
The three are:<br />
S a Department of Finance report on the forward<br />
estimates for the next three financial years;<br />
S an Information Paper on the economy; and<br />
an addendum to this paper which includes six<br />
information papers commissioned by the Technical<br />
Committee to the National Economic Summit.<br />
The forward estimates have been released for the first<br />
time by any Federal Government.<br />
The Information Paper covers developments in the domestic<br />
and international economies from 1971-2 to the present day.<br />
This paper was compiled by a sub-committee of the<br />
Technical Committee which comprised representatives of<br />
the ACTU, CAI and officers of the Australian Bureau of<br />
Statistics and the Department of Employment and Industrial<br />
Relations and the Treasury.<br />
Each organisation represented on the committee has agreed<br />
that the facts contained in the paper provide an<br />
indication of the state of the economy up to the present<br />
time. The addendum to the information paper provides factual<br />
information on certain existinq Government policies and </p>
<p>In addition, a second addendum of background papers will<br />
be sent later to participants.<br />
The purpose of releasing all of these papers is to provide<br />
participants in the Summit with a common information base.<br />
A Steering Committee for the Summit has been established<br />
to assist in the conduct of the conference.<br />
Its members are myself, the NSW Premier, Mr Wran, the<br />
Queensland Premier, Mr Bjelke-Petersen, three representatives<br />
of the ACTU, and Mr Hughes, President of CAI, Mr Bridgland,<br />
President of AIDA, and Mr John Utz ( Wormald International<br />
Ltd). I have already released the draft Agenda for the Summit.<br />
The flow of the Agenda will, over the course of the<br />
Summit, be determined by the participants.<br />
However, it is expected that under the first item<br />
" Basic Directions and Objectives" opening statements will<br />
be made by myself, Premier Wran, Mr Dolan, Mr Hughes,<br />
Mr Gibbons ( Council of Small Business) and Mr Mackenzie<br />
( ACOSS)<br />
Major expositions on the economy will be provided by the<br />
Treasurer, Mr Keating, an ACTU representative, and Sir<br />
Roderick Carnegie ( CRA) </p>
