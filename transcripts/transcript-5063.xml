DOORSTOP INTERVIEW ON IAN SINCLAIR ' L<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
This whole matter has been sub. ject to the grossest injustice,<br />
perpetrated by the Labor Pa; 7ty and also by some people in NSW.<br />
There is, what is in affect, an inquiry that has judicial<br />
implications, being undertaken by an agency for the NSW Labor<br />
government. Time and time again, some of the evidence has been<br />
leaked out into the Parliament through some Opposition office in<br />
this Parliament. The matter is part heard. Evidence alleged<br />
evidence is part introduced into the Parliament, all designed<br />
quite deliberately to damage Ian Sinclair. There is a long<br />
standing rule that this kind of debate cannot take the place<br />
of a judicial proceeding. That is so that people's future<br />
will not be prejudiced, so that the court can make its<br />
findings properly and clearly, and then whatever flows from<br />
that, flows.<br />
There is no such rule to protect Members, whether they be Members<br />
of Parliament, or members of the public, from quasi judicial<br />
proceedings, from administrative proceedings, which can have<br />
just as great an effect on the future of individuals as can a<br />
normal judicial proceeding in a court. This is a matter that<br />
teParliament is really going to have to look to, I believe.<br />
I~ z is not only a question of what happens to Members of<br />
ra;= rliament, it is also very much a question that as things<br />
no3w stand people outside Parliament can, without any redress,<br />
be slandered and destroyed by statements made inside the<br />
Parliament. We have not acted on this before because the Sinclair inquiry,<br />
conducted by the NSW Labor government has been continuing. We<br />
did not want allegations of trying to drop debate in the middle<br />
of that particular inquiry because it had been'started in that way.<br />
But once Finnane ' 5 report, on behalf of the Labor government,<br />
has been completed and published, then I think very seriously,<br />
the Parliament needs to look to its own procedures. Great and<br />
gross injustices have been perpetrated by bringing into the<br />
Parliament some evidence, or things alleged to be evidence, not<br />
neces'sarily corroborated, by members of the Labor Party. This<br />
all ougrht to have waited on the results of Mr Finnane's inquiry.<br />
I've said, on a number of occasions, that there is a question<br />
of basic common decency, that there is a question of basic<br />
justice in the way these things ought to be handled. That<br />
has certainly been absent in the case of Ian Sinclair. 7 JUNE 19 79 </p>
