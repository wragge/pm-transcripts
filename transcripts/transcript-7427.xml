PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 8 NOVEMBER 1988<br />
The Premier of China, Mr Li Peng, will visit Australia from<br />
14 to 20 November at the invitation of the Australian<br />
Government. His visit will be one of the most important of<br />
this Bicentennial year.<br />
I am delighted that Mr Li has chosen to visit Australia as<br />
part of his overseas tour since his appointment as Premier<br />
in March. His visit will serve to strengthen the very warm<br />
and friendly ties which have been built up between our<br />
countries over a decade and a half, and which have always<br />
been a priority for my Government.<br />
Australia and China have much to offer each other. In one<br />
aspect, this is demonstrated by our two-way trade, which has<br />
grown fourteen-fold in the past fifteen years, and by the<br />
steadily increasing interest in bilateral investment.<br />
But there are other links which, while less visible, provide<br />
an enduring basis for continuing harmony between our<br />
nations: the links of education, scientific cooperation,<br />
cultural exchange and personal friendship. I value highly<br />
the friendships that I made during my visits to China as<br />
Prime Minister in 1984 and 1986 and visits to Australia by<br />
Premier Zhao Ziyang in 1983 and General Secretary Hu Yaobang<br />
in 1985.<br />
In my discussions with the Premier in Canberra on 17 and 18<br />
November I shall be emphasising the importance Australia<br />
attaches to its relations with China and my hope that we can<br />
expand and deepen the contacts between our countries. I<br />
look forward to exchanging views on major issues facing the<br />
international community and, in particular, to discussing<br />
new developments in our region.<br />
Premier Li will be accompanied by five colleagues of<br />
ministerial rank: the Foreign Minister, Mr Qian Qichen;<br />
the r. nister of Metallurgical Industry, Mr Qi Yuanjing; the<br />
Minister of Labour, Mr Luo Gan; the Minister of<br />
Aeronautics and Astronautics Industry, Mr Lin Zongtang; and<br />
the Director of the China Rural Development Research Centre<br />
of the State Council, Mr Du Runsheng. The Premier's party<br />
will also include several Vice Ministers and a team of<br />
senior officials.<br />
The Premier will visit Perth, the Mount Channar iron ore<br />
joint venture in the Pilbara region of Western Australia,<br />
Sydney, Canberra and Melbourne. A STRAL1, A </p>
