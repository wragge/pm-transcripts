FOR MEDIA FRIDAY, 7 MAY 1982<br />
MINISTRY AND DEPARTMENTAL CHANGES<br />
This statement outlines important changes in the<br />
Ministerial and Departmental organisation of the<br />
Government. These changes will:<br />
make the structure increasingly relevant to<br />
current needs;<br />
enable more effective attention to be<br />
given to certain critical policy<br />
areas; rationalise a number of government functions.<br />
The overall re-organisation will mean that there will<br />
in effect be one less Government Department with<br />
specific operational responsibilities. On the other<br />
hand, there will be new Ministries and Departments<br />
designed specifically to focus on areas of growing<br />
importance in the Australian community.<br />

<p>DEPARTMENTAL RE-ORGANISATION<br />
The following Departments will be-abolished and their<br />
functions re-organised:<br />
Business and Consumer Affairs;<br />
Employment and Youth Affairs;<br />
Housing and Construction;<br />
Industrial Relations; and<br />
Transport.<br />
The new Departments to be created are:<br />
Aviation; Defence Support;<br />
Employment and Industrial Relations;<br />
Transport and Construction;<br />
Vice-President of the Executive Council.<br />
INDUSTRY Employm~ ent, Industrial Relations and Youth Affairs<br />
The Government's policies in relation to maintaining high<br />
levels of employment and effective industrial relations,<br />
and the close links between * these two areas, require the<br />
Departments of Industrial Relations and Employment and<br />
Youth Affairs to be brought together again.<br />
The Departments were split during the formative stages of<br />
the employment and training programmes. The basis for the<br />
effective operation and continued development of these<br />
programmes is now well established.<br />
The office of Youth Affairs will retain its identity and will<br />
receive continued priority within the new Departmental<br />
structure. Other Industrial Responsibilities<br />
To give a greater focus to Government policies affecting<br />
industry, the customs and excise functions of the Department:<br />
of Business and Consumer Affairs will be transferred to the<br />
Department of Industry and Commerce. ' As a consequence of this<br />
move, the other functions of the Department of Business and<br />
Consumer Affairs will be relocated and the Department abolished.<br />
The corporate affairs, trade practices and consumer affairs<br />
functions will be transferred back to the Attorney-General's<br />
Department. The regulatory functions in this area rest<br />
largely with the National Companies and Securities Commission<br />
and the Trade Practices Commission. Because of the substantial<br />
legal content of these functions, they are appropriately placed<br />
within the Attorney-General's portfolio.<br />
The Industries Assistance Commission and the work associated<br />
with protection policy previously located in the Department<br />
of Business and Consumer Affairs will be transferred to<br />
the Department of Administrative Services to continue the<br />
practice of having these functions administered by a<br />
Department independent of particular industry sectors. </p>
<p>DEFENCE The new Defence Support Department is based on a recommendation<br />
from the Defence Review Committee. Because its terms of<br />
reference included Departmental Structures, I asked if<br />
a report concerning these aspects of its terms of<br />
reference could be brought forward. An interim report<br />
on the issue of departmental organisation has been presented<br />
by the Committee under the Chairmanship of Mr John Utz and<br />
whose other members are Sir Frederick Wheeler, General<br />
MacDonald and Mr Eric Neal.<br />
The Review Committee concluded that there were disadvantages<br />
in the present large structure of the Defence Department.<br />
It recommended the creation of a second Department in<br />
the Defence area a Department of Defence Support. I<br />
have decided to accept this recommendation. The interim<br />
report will be made public forthwith and tabled in the<br />
Parliament.<br />
The Department of Defence Support will take over the defence<br />
production factories now under the Department of Industry<br />
and Commerce; the naval dockyards at Garden Island and<br />
Williamstown other than the fleet-based activities at<br />
Garden IsLand; administration of the major research and<br />
development laboratories of the Defence Science and<br />
Technology Organisation viz. the Defence Engineering<br />
Laboratory, the Aeronautical Research Laboratories, the<br />
Electronic Research Laboratories, the Materials Research<br />
Laboratories, and the Weapons Systems Research Laboratories;<br />
that part of Defence purchasing now located in the Department<br />
of Administrative Services; and the Defence Industry Development<br />
functions of the Department of Defence.<br />
The grouping of defence support activities under a<br />
separate Minister and Department will enable close<br />
co-operation with scientific and industrial organisations<br />
who are now involved with the Defence Department. At the<br />
same time, defence support effort could be integrated more<br />
closely with private sector industrial capacity and move<br />
towards increased self-reliance in industrial support.<br />
There will be a close relationship between the new Department<br />
and the Department of Defence. The Minister for Defence,<br />
Mr Sinclair, will retain central responsibility for<br />
formulating defence policy and co-ordinating defence<br />
expenditure. The Minister for Defence Support, Mr Viner,<br />
will be the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence.<br />
The Minister for Defence Support and the Secretary of his<br />
Department: will be members of the Council of Defence and<br />
the Department of Defence Support will be represented at<br />
various levels on defence co-ordinating bodies. It is<br />
intended that there will continue to be an overall defence<br />
expenditure programme covering both Departments. </p>
<p>TRANSPORT The functions of the Department of Transport will be divided<br />
between the two new Departments of Aviation and of Transport<br />
and Constr7uction. The re-establishment of an Aviation<br />
Department recognises the importance of civil aviation to<br />
the economy and to the community at large. It is a distinct<br />
area which presents particu * lar issues of its own and its<br />
importance! warrants undivided ministerial attention.<br />
The new Detpartment of Transport and Construction will carry<br />
out functions relating to road, rail and sea transport and<br />
assume responsibility for the Commonwealth construction<br />
activities of the Department of Housing and Construction<br />
and that Department will be abolished.<br />
HOUS ING<br />
The welfare housing activities of the Department of Housing and<br />
Construction will be transferred to the Department of<br />
Social Security. This will align housing, including the<br />
administration of the improved Home Deposit Assistance<br />
Scheme and welfare housing payments to the States, more<br />
clearly with the Government's overall welfare programme.<br />
Relations with the building industry and housing policy generally<br />
will be the responsibility of the expanded Department of Industry<br />
and Commerce and take their place alongside other industry matters.<br />
VICE-PRESIDENT OF THE EXECUTIVE COUNCIL<br />
Mr Killen will be the Vice-President of the Executive Counci'l<br />
and Leader of the House of Representatives and will retain<br />
his position in the Cabinet. The new Department of the<br />
Vice-President of the Executive Council is a vehicle for<br />
the appointment of a seni-or minister whose functions can<br />
be performed without involving heavy departmental<br />
responsibilities. The practice of appointing Vice-Presidents in this way<br />
goes back -to Federation. More than half of the Ministers<br />
who have held the office have held it without portfolio.<br />
This practice was once embraced by successive governments,<br />
but doubts have been expressed in more recent times about<br />
certain legal aspects of appointments of Ministers without<br />
portfolio. In view of these doubts, a very small Department<br />
of the Vice-President of the Executive Council is being<br />
created. The Permanent Head of the Department of the<br />
Prime Minister and Cabinet will. be appointed as the<br />
new Department I'shead in addition to his existing<br />
responsibi Ii ties. oo00000000---</p>
