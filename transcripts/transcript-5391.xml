ORGANI SA'PTONS. </p>
<p>2<br />
THE GOVERNMENT ACTS UPON THIS BELIEF BY WORKING TIN<br />
PARTNERSHIP WITH VOLUNTARY ORGANISATIONS; RECOGNISING<br />
THAT IT IS IN THIS ACT OF PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN GOVERl'!, ENT<br />
AND THE COMMUNITY THAT THE MOST PRODUCTIVE WELFARE<br />
WORK IS DONE.<br />
THE ROYAL NEW SOUTH WALES INSTITUTE FOR DEAF A! N BLi:: D<br />
CHILDREN IS ACTIVE TESTIMONY TO THIS TRUTH.<br />
I AM AWARE OF THE THOUSANDS OF VOLUNTARY WORKERS<br />
SEPARATE AUXILIARIES WHO, BY THEIR OWN EFFORTS, AND<br />
IN THEIR OWN WAY, CONTRIBUTE TO THE FUND RAISI PRGLRAI'_ 4E<br />
OF THE INSTITUTE.<br />
IT IS EFFORTS OF THIS KIND WHICH ENCOURAGE AND JUSTIFY<br />
GOVERNMENT SUPPORT.<br />
AND THAT IS WHY THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN HAPPY TO CONTRIBUTE<br />
IN EXCESS OF $ 2 MILLION, TO THESE NEW EXTENSIONS AND<br />
TO THE PURCHASE OF EQUIPMENT AND FURNISHINGS FOR THEM.<br />
TODAY WE WITNESS THE TANGIBLE EVIDENCE* OF CO-OPERATION IN<br />
ACTION. THESE EXPANDED FACILITIES FOR MULTI-HANDICAPPED BLIND<br />
CHILDREN EFFECTIVELY TAKE THEIR CARE OUT OF THE " TOO-HARD<br />
BASKET" INTO A PROGRAMME OF ACTIVE AND CONSTRUCTIVE<br />
DEDICATION TO THEIR WELFARE.<br />
WHAT BEGAN IN 1974 AS A PILOT PROGRAMME WITH AN ENROLMENT<br />
OF TEN CHILDREN, NOW STANDS AS THE ONLY SPECIAL SCHOOL<br />
IN AUSTRALIA ESTABLISHED TO EDUCATE AND TRAIN<br />
MULTI-HANDICAPPED BLIND CHILDREN.<br />
INDEED, THE INSTITUTE IS TO BE CONGRATULATED FOR PIONEERING<br />
THIS FACILITY IN THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE AND PROVIDING<br />
ONE OF ONLY FOUR SIMILAR FACILITIES IN THE WORLD.<br />
IN THIS WAY, TODAY'S CEREMONY CARRIES ON A PROUD TRADITION<br />
WHICH WAS BEGUN AS FAR BACK AS 1860.<br />
SINCE THEN THE INSTITUTION HAS STEADFASTLY ADHERED<br />
TO A POLICY THAT NO CHILD SHOULD BE TURNED AWAY.<br />
IT HAS MOST EFFECTIVELY SERVED DEAF AND BLIND CHILDREN IN NEW<br />
SOUTH WALES OFFERING THEM LOVE, INSTRUCTION AND SUPPORT; AND<br />
IMBUING THEM WiTH A DETERMINATION TO OVERCOME OBSTACLES.<br />
THE RESPECT AND ADMIRATION THAT EXIST WITHIN THE COMTUNITY,<br />
TOWARDS THE INSTITUTE, IS WELL-FOUNDED. / 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
OF COURSE, WE CAN BE INSPIRED IN OUR EFFORTS BY THE UNSELFISH<br />
AND REMARKABLY SUCCESSFUL WORK OF WORLD FAMOUS TEACHERS LIKE<br />
ANNE SULLIVAN WHO DEVOTED PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL ENERGY,<br />
WHICH EVENTUALLY ENABLED HELEN KELLER TO MAKE SUCH AN<br />
IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTION TO AMERICAN LIFE.<br />
BUT THERE ARE MANY OTHERS, NOT AS FAMOUS AS HELEN KELLER AND<br />
ANNE SULLIVAN PARENTS, RELATIVES AND FRIENDS WHO PUT<br />
SIMILAR AND CONSISTENT EFFORT INTO OBTAINING FACILITIES AND<br />
SERVICES NEEDED TO GIVE DISADVANTAGED CHILDREN AN APPROPRI.-ATE<br />
EDUCATION AND WORTHWHILE OPPORTUNITIES IN LIFE.<br />
SOME OF THE PROBLEMS EXPERIENCED BY THE COMMUNITY IN<br />
ADJUSTING TO THE NEEDS OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN, DERIVE,<br />
I BELIEVE, FROM THE TERM ITSELF, " HANDICAPPED CHILDREN."<br />
IT IS AN UNHAPPY PHRASE WHICH ATTRACTS ATTENTION TO<br />
THE DISABILITIES RATHER THAN TO THE POSITIVE ABILITIES,<br />
APTITUDES AND INTERESTS POSSESSED BY THESE CHILDREN.<br />
INSTITUTES SUCH AS THIS CONSTANTLY REMIND US THAT CHILDREN<br />
WITH HANDICAPS HAVE SIGNIFICANT ASSETS. AND POTENTIAL FOR<br />
GROWTH PROVIDED THEY ARE GIVEN OPPORTUNITIES AND THE<br />
ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH THEY CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THEM.<br />
THEREFORE, IN THE EDUCATION OF THESE CHILDREN, THE<br />
PROSPECTS OF THEIR SUCCESS IS GREATLY ENHANCED IF WE<br />
BUILD ON THEIR ASSETS WITH A FULL KNOWLEDGE OF THE<br />
LIMITATIONS THAT THE HANDICAPS MAY IMPOSE.<br />
VIEWED THIS WAY, WE ARE ABLE TO PLACE OUR EMPHASIS ON<br />
THE CHILDREN FIRST AND THE DISABILITY SECOND.<br />
INDEED, THE EXAMPLE SET BY MANY YOUNG PEOPLE WHO RECEIVE<br />
THEIR TRAINING HERE, IS AN EXAMPLE WE CAN ALL PROFITABLY<br />
FOLLOW. FOR, IN LIFE, IT IS ALL TOO EASY TO GIVE IN; TO IMAGINE'<br />
THAT THE CHALLENGES WE FACE ARE TOO DIFFICULT TO SURMOUNT.<br />
WHAT IS DEMON~ STRATED HERE, IS THAT IN SPITE OF THE<br />
DIFFICULTIES AND THE CHALLENGES, THERE ARE ALSO REWARDS.<br />
WHEN THESE REWARDS ARE GAINED IN THE FACE OF ADVERSITY,<br />
AND THROUGH PERSISTENCE AND PERSEVERANCE, THEY CAN<br />
BE VERY GRATIFYING INDEED.<br />
THE COURAGE OF THOSE WITH HANDICAPS, OF THEIR PARENTS AND.<br />
THEIR RELATPIVES, IS A SOURCE OF INSPIRATION TO US ALL WHO<br />
WITNESS DAILY THEIR WILLINGNESS AND THEIR SUCCESS IN<br />
OVERCOMING DIFFICULTY. / 4 </p>
<p>4<br />
A GOOD DEAL IS SAID THESE DAYS ABOUT THE DIFFICULTIES<br />
CONFRONTING YOUNG PEOPLE GROWINiG UP IN AN INCREASINGLY<br />
COMPLEX SOCIETY.<br />
INEVITABLY, FOR SOME CHILDREN AND THEIR PARENTS, THE<br />
FUTURE MUST SEEM, AT TIMES, CONFUSING AND DISPIRITING.<br />
THE CHALLENGES FOR HANDICAPPED CHILDREN, AND FOR THEIR<br />
PARENTS ARE MUCH GREATER.<br />
THE PROCESS OF GROWING UP, OF LEARNING, OF ACQUIRING<br />
SPECIAL SKILLS TO ENABLE CHILDREN WITH HANDICAPS TO<br />
TAKE AN ACTIVE ROLE IN THE COMMUNITY NONE OF THESE<br />
ARE EASY.<br />
ASSISTANCE AND ENCOURAGEMENT TO THESE CHILDREN MUST<br />
BE A MATTER OF CONCERN TO US ALL.<br />
CERTAINLY, THE FAMILY MUST NOT BE LEFT TO PROVIDE THIS<br />
ASSISTANCE ENTIRELY FROM ITS OWN RESOURCES.<br />
THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE, INCLUDING GOVERNMENT AND INDUSTRY,<br />
HAVE THEIR RESPONSIBILITY AND THEIR ROLE TO PLAY.<br />
I KNOW THIS ROLE AND RESPONSIBILITY HAS BEEN MET WITH<br />
UNPARALLELED SUCCESS BY THE ROYAL NEW SOUTH WALES INSTITUTE<br />
FOR DEAF AND BLIND CHILDREN.<br />
IT MUST NOT BE ALLOWED TO LOSE MOMENTUM.<br />
ONE OF THE MOST PRODUCTIVE ROLES FOR THE GOVERNMENT<br />
LIES IN ENCOURAGING AND SUPPORTING THE VOLUNTARY SECTOR,<br />
AND IN PARTICULAR, INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS THIS.<br />
AS A GOVERNMENT WE ARE PROUD OF OUR REPUTATION AS ECONOMIC<br />
MANAGERS. BUT TALK OF INFLATION AND INTEREST RATES TENDS TO OBSCURE OUR<br />
PROVEN RECORD OF CARE AND CONCERN FOR THOSE IN NEED.<br />
IMPROVED CARE FOR THE DISABLED IS CENTRAL TO OUR COMMITMENT.<br />
OVER MANY YEARS NOW, WE HAVE PROVIDED FINANCE TO COMMUNITY<br />
ORGANISATIONS THROUGH THE HANDICAPPED PERSONS' WELFARE<br />
PROGRAMME. IN THIS WAY, THE GOVERNMENT HAS HELPED IN THE ESTABLISHMENT<br />
AND OPERATION OF FACILITIES FOR HANDICAPPED CHILDREN<br />
AND ADULTS.<br />
LAST YEAR, THE GOVERNMENT PROVIDED SUBSTANTIAL FUNDS<br />
TO ELIGIBLE VOLUNTARY ORGANISATIONS UNDER THIS PROGRAMME. </p>
<p>WE ALSO ENCOURAGE THE DEVELOPMENT OF REHABILITATION<br />
PROGRAMMES TrO ASSIST HANDICAPPED PEOPLE WHO WANT SO<br />
MUCH TO PLAY A USEFUL PART IN THE COMMUNITY.<br />
BECAUSE OF' OUR BELIEF IN THE GREAT NEED FOR TIIS TYPE<br />
OF ASSISTANCE TO BE MORE FREELY AVAILABLE, THE GOVERNMENT<br />
IN 1977 WIDENED THE ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR RENMEDIAL<br />
AND TRAINING PROGRAMMES.<br />
WHERE FORMERLY, REHABILITATION HAD BEEN AVAILABLE ONLY<br />
TO THOSE WITH A REASONABLE PROSPECT OF EMPLOYMENT;<br />
IN NOVEMBER 1977, THIS WAS EXTENDED TO THE MENT-ALLY<br />
AND PHYSICALLY HANDICAPPED TO ENABLE THEM TO LIVE<br />
INDEPENDENTLY IN THEIR OWN HOMES.<br />
FROM THAT DATE ONWARDS, THIS REHABILITATION HAS BEEN<br />
PROVIDED FREE OF CHARGE TO THESE PEOPLE.<br />
AND LAST YEAR, THE COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT MADE INCREASED<br />
PROVISION FOR THIS PURPOSE.<br />
OF COURSE, 1981 HAS BEEN DECLARED BY THiE UNITED NATIONS<br />
AS THE INTERNATIONAL YEAR FOR DISABLED. PERSONS.<br />
SUCH A , DECLARATION HAS THE WHOLEHEARTED SUPPORT OF<br />
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT; AND WE ARE LOOKING FORWARD<br />
TO IT BEING A YEAR OF ACTION AND ACHIEVEMENT FOR HANDICAPPED<br />
PEOPLE IN AUSTRALIA.<br />
I HOPE THAT IT WILL ENCOURAGE A COMBINED EFFORT, FROM<br />
DISABLED PEOPLE, VOLUNTARY ORGANISATIONS, GOVERNMENTS<br />
AND THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE, TO PROMOTE PUBLIC AWARENESS<br />
OF THE NEEDS OF THE DISABLED.<br />
THE SUCCESS OF THE INTERNATIONAL YEAR FOR DISABLED<br />
PERSONS WILL BE MEASURED BY THE EXTENT TO WHICH IT<br />
PROVIbES FURTHER IMPETUS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF SERVICES TO<br />
ASSIST THE INTEGRATION OF HANDICAPPED PEOPLE INTO THE<br />
COMMUNITY. THERE IS VIRT UALLY NO AREA OF GOVERNMENT, OR COMMUNITY<br />
ACTIVITY, WHICH WOULD NOT BE IN A POSITION TO MAKE<br />
A POSITIVE CONTRIBUTION TO AUSTRALIA'S OBSERVATION<br />
OF THE INTERNATIONAL YEAR; AND I URGE THEM TO DO SO.<br />
IT IS MOST APPROPRIATE THAT DURING THE MONTHS LEADING<br />
UP TO 1981, THIS OUTSTANDING COMPLEX SHOULD BE OPENED.<br />
THE GOVERNMENT IS PROUD OF ITS PRODUCTIVE PARTNERSHIP<br />
WITH THE INSTITUTE IN ENABLING THIS FACILITY TO COME<br />
ON LINE.<br />
BUT THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF THlE INSTITUTE ARE SUBSTANITIALLY<br />
ASSISTED BY SUPPORT FROM MANY SECTIONS OF THE COMMUNITY.<br />
IN PARTICULAR, I COMMEND MOST WARMLY THE ROYAL NEW<br />
SOUTH WALES BOWLING ASSOCIATION. / 6 </p>
<p>-6-<br />
THROUGH ITS AFFILIATED BOWLING CLUBS, AND MAGNIFICENTLYSUPPORTED<br />
BY THOUSANDS OF BOWLERS THROUGHOUT NEW SOUTH WALES,<br />
IT HAS RAISED OVER A QUARTER OF A MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE<br />
INSTITUTE IN 18 MONTHS.<br />
THERE COULD BE NO MORE FITTING WAY FOR YOUR ASSOCIATION<br />
TO COMMEMORATE ITS CENTENARY THAN IN CONTRIBUTING,<br />
SO UNSELFISHLY, TO SUCH A WORTHWHILE CHARITY AS THE<br />
INSTITUTE FOR DEAF AND BLIND CHIL1DREN IN THIS STATE.<br />
I KNOW THAT THE SAME SPIRIT MOTIVATES THE MANAGEMENT<br />
OF CHANNEL ' PEN IN THE CONDUCT, EVERY TWVJO YEARS, OF<br />
THEIR TELETHON; AND THE GENEROUS GOINTRIBUTIONS OF CONCERNED<br />
CITIZENS AND ORGANISATIONS TO THE CHANNEL TEN APPEAL<br />
HAVE HELPED LESSEN THE BURDEN OF BUILDING COSTS FOR<br />
THIS SCHOOL.<br />
AND SO IT IS WITH THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE AND ORGANISATIONS<br />
THROUGHOUT NEW SOUTH WALES WHOSE EFFORTS HAVE HELPED GIVE,<br />
THESE YOUNG AUSTRALIANS NEW DIRECTION IN LIFE.<br />
I HOPE THAT MANY PEOPLE WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO<br />
SEE AT FIRST HAND THE WORK WHICH IS CARRIED OUT HERE<br />
BY STAFF AND PUPILS.<br />
I KNOW THAT IN THIS NEW SCHOOL ALL OF THE STAFF,' INCLUDING<br />
THE TEACHING STAFF, ARE SUPPORTED BY THE INSTITUTE<br />
WHICH MAKES ITS EXISTENCE, AND ITS ACHIEVEMENTS, A<br />
PROUD RESULT OF CO-OPERATIO. 1 BETWEEN THE INSTITUTE,<br />
THE COMMUNITY AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.<br />
I AM CONFIDENT THAT THESE SERVICES WILL BENEFIT IMMENSELY<br />
THE CHILDREN WHO USE THEM.<br />
IT IS A PLEASURE TO BE AMONGST YOU.<br />
I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING OF THE PROGRESS THAT YOU<br />
MAKE IN THE FUTURE.<br />
TO THE YOUNG CHILDREN, I EXPRESS THE HOPE THAT YOU<br />
WILL ALL WORK HARD WITH YOUR TEACHERS; THAT YOU WILL<br />
UTILISE TO THE FULL THIS SPLENDID ENVIRONMENT; AND<br />
THAT BY YOUR EFFORTS AND ACHIEVEMENTS YOU WILL BE AN<br />
INSPIRATION TO US ALL.<br />
I HAVE MUCH PLEASURE IN DECLARING OPEN THIS SPECIAL<br />
SCHOOL FOR MULTI-HANDI CAPPED BLIND CIHILDREN.<br />
