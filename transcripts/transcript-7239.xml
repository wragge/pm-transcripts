    <content><![CDATA[<p>AIJ<br />PRIME MINISTER<br />FOR MEDIA 9 NOVEMBER 1987<br />I have sent the following message to Prime Minister<br />Thatcher: I was appalled to learn of the terrorist outrage at<br />Enniskillen. I express through you the deepest sympathy<br />of the Government and people of Australia to the<br />relatives and friends of those killed in this callous<br />crime and to the surviving victims.<br />The Australian Government strongly supports the efforts<br />of the British and Irish Governments through the<br />Anglo-Irish Agreement to end communal strife in Northern<br />Ireland through reconciliation and the search for<br />understanding. We utterly repudiate violence.<br />I join you in your forthright condemnation of this<br />despicable and cowardly act.</p>
