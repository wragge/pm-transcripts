4AUS RL AL June 1974<br />
Press Statement NO. 264<br />
THE DUKE OF GLOUCESTER<br />
Throughout his long life the Duke of Gloucester<br />
showed a sense of duty worthy of his high station and<br />
royal position. He had close links with Australia<br />
over the last half-century. He represented his father,<br />
King George V, at the 150th Anniversary of the<br />
foundation of Melbourne. In 1945, Prime Minister<br />
Curtin sought and secured the appointment of the<br />
Duke of Gloucester as Governor-General of Australia.<br />
He remained with us for two years. His last visit<br />
to Australia was to represent his family at the<br />
Anniversary of Anzac.<br />
On behalf of the Australian people I have sent<br />
a message of our deepest sympathy to the Queen on the<br />
death of her uncle.<br />
CANBERRA. A. C. T. </p>
