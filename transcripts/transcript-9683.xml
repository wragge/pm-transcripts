PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON PJ KEATING MP<br />
THE ALAN GRIFFITHS INQUIRY<br />
The Alan Griffiths inquiry, conducted by Mr Michael Codd AC, has concluded<br />
and its report has now been presented to the Government.<br />
The full and independent investigation found that it would be properly open to<br />
me to accept the return of Mr Griffiths to the Ministry.<br />
Mr Griffiths has made a valuable contribution to the Labor Government, to<br />
Cabinet and to Parliament and I would have welcomed his return to Cabinet.<br />
However, he has already indicated that he will be retiring from Parliament at<br />
the next general election.<br />
The Inquiry also found that there would be merit in the Government<br />
considering the clarification and reinforcement of guidelines to Members of<br />
Parliament and Ministers in a number of respects related to the use of staff<br />
and facilities.<br />
I understand that action already taken by the Minister for Administrative<br />
Services, the Hon Frank Walker, to strengthen the guidelines is now well<br />
advanced. I ha~ ie--] 6d-him to provide a report to Cabinet on implementation<br />
as soon as possible.<br />
The Inquiry's report has been tabled and its conclusions are attached,<br />
Mr Codd has produced a thorough report and I thank him for the work he has<br />
done. CANBERRA 3 August 1995 </p>
<p>CONCLUSIONS 200. The inquiry was asked to examine and report on " whether the conduct of the Hon<br />
Alan Griffiths in relation to the matters leading to his resignation from the Ministry was<br />
in accordance with appropriate standards of behaviour for a person holding office as a<br />
Minister and a Member of Parliament, and in particular:<br />
whether there was any conflict between his private interests and the performance of<br />
his public duties;<br />
whether he authorised or condoned any inappropriate, improper or illegal activities<br />
by any of his staff in relation to the conduct of his private interests."<br />
201. In relation to the first particular question there is no evidence of any direct conflict<br />
or personal breach of guidelines or declaration requirements.<br />
202. In relation to the second particular question there is no evidence that he authorised<br />
or condoned behaviour by his staff of the kind specified, but the inquiry concludes there<br />
has been conduct on the part of Mr Griffiths which does not meet standards which might<br />
reasonably be expected of a Minister and Member in relation to three matters in<br />
particular:-the way in which he directed Mr Lennox to involve himself in support of Mr<br />
Griffiths' private financial interests ( paras 152 to 160 above);<br />
( ii) the way in which he acted when the illegal and improper conduct of Mr Lennox<br />
was brought to his notice ( paras 161 to 183 above); and </p>
<p>( iii) the responsibility he bears for the conduct of Mr Lennox ( paras 184 to 190 above).<br />
In the case of all three the inquiry finds errors of judgment and/ or a want of diligence.<br />
With one exception the inquiry considers it would be unreasonable to find that Mr<br />
Griffiths' conduct in the circumstances was improper. The exception is in relation to his<br />
requirement that Mr Lennox repay $ 5,000.00 to the BB Account given the indirect<br />
linkage to Mr Griffiths' financial interests.<br />
203. On the basis of the findings in this report, however, and against the broad<br />
background of precedents referred to in paragraphs 191 to 199 ( and particularly because<br />
Mr Griffiths has paid $ 5,000.00 to Mr Lennox in recompense and has already lost the<br />
benefits of Ministerial office for a longer period than any of those cases of precedent) the<br />
inquiry believes that it would properly be open to the Prime Minister to accept the return<br />
of Mr Griffiths to the Ministry.<br />
204. The Inquiry further concludes that there would be merit in early consideration of<br />
the clarification of guidelines to Members and Ministers in a number of respects:-<br />
To make much clearer that the " over-riding conditions of use" of the facilities<br />
provided to Members and Ministers, and the over-riding role of staff provided, is<br />
to support parliamentary, electorate, portfolio or official business.<br />
( ii) To clarify the guidelines concerning limidtations on Ministers and Members earning<br />
income through personal exertion ( see paragraph 48).<br />
( iii) To clarify the extent to which it is acceptable for staff provided to<br />
Senators/ Members and Ministers to carry out duties related to the private interests </p>
<p>of the Senator Member or Minister, and especially their private financial interests.<br />
As indicated in the report, a degree of such involvement is inevitable, but as a<br />
minimum it needs to be made clearer that the extent of any such involvement<br />
should not be such as to cause any detriment to the official duties of staff. Beyond<br />
that there may be value in guidelines which limit the areas to those which are<br />
inevitable ( such as answering phones, passing messages, opening mail).<br />
( iv) To refine the reference to electorate staff not being used for " party political<br />
purposes", since the present apparently widespread practice is that electorate staff<br />
are involved in campaign activity in election periods and throughout their<br />
employment often in fund raising and other activities which on any reasonable<br />
interpretation might be regarded as " party political". ( see paragraphs 114 to 116<br />
above) To bring more directly and regularly to the attention of Senators Members and<br />
Ministers the responsibility assigned to them for the conduct of their staff and for<br />
ensuring their staff understand the standards of conduct expected of them.<br />
( vi) To clarify the guidelines on use of official motor vehicles for private purposes so<br />
that it is clearer what activities are properly embraced within the term " private". It<br />
is not sufficient to proscribe, as the latest public service guideline does, use for<br />
" 1commercial" purposes since that term also lends itself to a variety of<br />
interpretations. The ambit needs to be made less ambiguous, therefore, for public<br />
servants as well as for Members/ Senators and Ministers.<br />
( vii) To' clarifyr the power to withhold severance benefits in appropriate circumstances<br />
( see paragraph 181 regarding Ministerial Determination 1993/ 1). </p>
<p>205. It should be noted also that, since 1987, the Code of Conduct deriving from the<br />
Bowen Report and set out in paragraph 40 of this report has been accepted as applying<br />
not just to Ministers but also to ministerial staff, public servants and other officials ( see<br />
paragraph 38). The material presented to this inquiry suggests that there has been no<br />
attempt by the Department of Administrative Services to bring this Code of Conduct to<br />
the direct attention of all ministerial and electorate staff. This should be done, and done<br />
regularly. 206. The Department of Administrative Services has acknowledged the findings in<br />
paragraphs 204 and 205 and indicated they will be taken into account in a broader review<br />
of DAS responsibilities and administration in this area, already well advanced.<br />
207. Finally, the inquiry believes that the Australian Electoral Commission is open to<br />
criticism for its actions in following up on the improperly constituted 1990 and 1993<br />
electoral returns of Mr Griffiths ( paras 109 to 111) and should ensure it has procedures<br />
in place to follow through its duty more effectively in circumstances where it becomes<br />
aware of an improperly constituted return. The AEC has acknowledged there is room<br />
for improvement and is taking action accordingly. </p>
