CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
OPENING OF TWENTIETH CENTURY KASTERS EXHIBITION<br />
NATIONAL GALLERY CANBERRA 28 FEBRUARY 1986<br />
DISTINGUISHED GUESTS, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN<br />
IN 1983 1 HAD THE PLEASURE OF OPENING THE FIRST OF THE MAJOR<br />
INTERNATIONAL EXHIBITIONS DISPLAYED HERE AT THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
NATIONAL GALLERY THE CHINESE ENTOMBED WARRIORS EXHIBITION<br />
WHICH WAS AN OUTSTANDING SUCCESS. THE FOLLOWING YEAR THE<br />
GREAT IMPRESSIONISTS CAME TO THE GALLERY AND WAS ALSO HIGHLY<br />
SUCCESSFUL, ATTRACTING SOME 200,000 PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER<br />
AUSTRALIA, AS WELL AS PAPUA NEW GUINEA AND NEW ZEALAND.<br />
AND NOW, THE THIRD SUCH INTERNATIONAL EXHIBITION THE<br />
TWENTIETH CENTURY MASTERS FROM THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF<br />
ART, NEW YORK IS ABOUT TO OPEN AND WILL, I AM SURE, BE<br />
EQUALLY SUCCESSFUL.<br />
WHEN THE AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL GALLERY OPENED TO THE PUBLIC<br />
LESS THAN FOUR YEARS AGO, THERE WERE SCEPTICS WHO SAID THAT<br />
IT WAS WELL NIGH IMPOSSIBLE TO ' CREATE' ANOTHER WORLD<br />
RENOWNED ART MUSEUM. TO THOSE SCEPTICS I BELIEVE IT MUST<br />
NOW BE CLEAR THAT THE GALLERY HAS ' COME OF AGE' AS AN<br />
OUTSTANDING AND IMPRESSIVE ART MUSEUM THAT HAS ALREADY WON<br />
WORLD WIDE RECOGNITION.<br />
MANY OF YOU MAY RECALL THAT MR WHITLAM'S ACQUISITION OF BLUE<br />
POLES WAS ALSO GREETED WITH CONSIDERABLE SCEPTICISM. BLUE<br />
POLES IS A SPLENDID WORK OF ART AND IT IS NOW SO VALUABLE<br />
THAT SELLING IT OFF COULD SUBSTANTIALLY SOLVE OUR CURRENT<br />
ACCOUNT PROBLEMS.<br />
DURING THIS CENTURY THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART IN NEW<br />
YORK HAS BECOME ONE OF THE WORLD'S MOST PRESTIGIOUS TREASURE<br />
HOUSES. THE MUSEUM DID NOT HESITATE TO LEND THIS THE<br />
CREAM OF ITS TWENTIETH CENTURY COLLECTION TO THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL GALLERY AND LATER TO THE QUEENSLAND ART<br />
GALLERY. </p>
<p>THIS SUPERB EXHIBITION I-S MADE UP OF 71 PAINTINGS, DRAWINGS<br />
AND SCULPTURES. AMONG THE WORKS THAT AUSTRALIANS WILL SEE<br />
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THIS COUNTRY ARE THOSE BY THE MODERN<br />
EUROPEAN MASTERS PICASSO, BONNARD, MATISSE, DERAIN,<br />
BECKMANN AND PAINTINGS BY AMERICANS JOHN MARIN, JACKSON<br />
POLLOCK AND WILLEM DE KOONING. THERE ARE ALSO WORKS BY THE<br />
GREAT EARLY AMERICAN PAINTERS WHO INTRODUCED MODERN ART TO<br />
AMERICA, MARSDEN HARTLEY AND GEORGIA O'KEEFFE.<br />
WHILE A NEW WING TO HOUSE THIS COLLECTION IS BEING ADDED TO<br />
THE METROPOL:' TAN MUSEUM IN NEW YORK, AUSTRALIA HAS THE<br />
UNIQUE PRIVILEGE OF BORROWING THESE WORKS. FOR THIS<br />
PRIVILEGE, WE ARE INDEBTED TO THE DIRECTOR OF THE MUSEUM, MR<br />
PHILIPPE DE MONTEBELLO AND THE TRUSTEES AS WELL AS TO THE<br />
CHAIRMAN OF THE DEPARTMENT OF TWENTIETH CENTURY ART, MR<br />
WILLIAM S. LIEBERMAN, WHOSE ENCOURAGEMENT AND ENTHUSIASM<br />
MADE THIS ALL POSSIBLE.<br />
SPECIAL THANKS MUST ALSO GO TO THE DIRECTORS AND STAFF OF<br />
BOTH THE AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL GALLERY AND THE QUEENSLAND ART<br />
GALLERY. THE ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF WORK AND ENERGY THAT GOES<br />
ON BEHIND THE SCENES OF THESE EXHIBITIONS IS OFTEN<br />
OVERLOOKED AND SELDOM PRAISED.<br />
THERE IS A FURTHER LINK BETWEEN THE GALLERY AND AMERICA<br />
WHICH MAKES THE OPENING OF THIS EXHIBITION HERE PARTICULARLY<br />
APPROPRIATE. ALL OF THE PAINTINGS AND DRAWINGS THAT MAKE UP<br />
THIS EXHIBITION HAVE BEEN DONATED TO THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM<br />
BY PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS IN THE UNITED STATES.<br />
AS MY COLLEAGUE, THE MINISTER FOR ARTS, HERITAGE AND<br />
ENVIRONMENT HAS SAID IN THE FOREWORD TO THE CATALOGUE,<br />
AUSTRALIANS HAVE LONG ADMIRED THE GENEROSITY OF AMERICANS IN<br />
THEIR SUPPORT OF THE ARTS. THROUGH THE EFFORTS OF GORDON<br />
DARLING, THE AMERICAN FRIENDS OF THE AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL<br />
GALLERY FOUNDATION HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED.<br />
I AM PLEASED TO SAY THE FOUNDATION UNDER ITS PRESIDENT,<br />
RICHARD PAGET, IS MAKING EXCELLENT PROGRESS IN ENLISTING<br />
TRUSTEES. ALREADY THE ASSOCIATION IS BEARING FRUIT WITH THE<br />
GENEROUS DONATION TO THE GALLERY OF CONTEMPORARY AMERICAN<br />
WORKS EARLIER THIS MONTH BY A M4AJOR US COMPANY SARA LEE<br />
CORPORATION, CHICAGO FOR DISPLAY IN THE GALLERY AND<br />
REGIONAL ART GALLERIES.<br />
FINALLY, AND FOLLOWING ON FROM WHAT BARRY COHEN SAID<br />
EARLIER, I SHOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS MY APPRECIATION TO THE<br />
GENEROUS SPONSORS OF THE EXHIBITION:<br />
TO THE FLYING TIGERS AND TAA FOR THE TRANSPORT OF THE<br />
ART WORKS AND COURIERS; AND<br />
TO MCPHERSONS FOR UNDERWRITING PART OF THE COST OF<br />
MOUNTING THE EXHIBITION IN CANBERRA.<br />
MAY I ALSO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO CONGRATULATE THE ABC ON<br />
COVERING THE OPENING OF THIS MAJOR INTERNATIONAL EXHIBITION.<br />
IT NOW GIVES ME GREAT PLEASURE IN FORMALLY DECLARING OPEN<br />
THIS MAGNIFICENT EXHIBITION WHICH I AM SURE WILL PROVE TO BE<br />
A REWARDING EXPERIENCE FOR THE MANY AUSTRALIANS WHO I KNOW<br />
WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE IT.<br />
