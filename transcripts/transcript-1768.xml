FOR PRESS-: LIB R P I PM. No. 13/ 1968<br />
SETTLIEMNT OF POSTAL DISPUrE<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Senator Ljohn Gorton<br />
The entire community will welcome the return to<br />
work. It Is a win for common sense, which all concerned should be<br />
able to regard as a gain. It Is certainly a gain for the nation as a<br />
whole. For my part I will see that claims advanced through<br />
the arbitration machinery are processed, as I have promised, with<br />
no deliberate or undue delay.<br />
I express my deep gratitude to those Australians who<br />
have helped to keep the mails collected, sorted and moving, and have<br />
given me support in a course I did not relish but which I felt was<br />
essential In the national Interest.<br />
CANBE RRA,<br />
23rd January, 1968. </p>
