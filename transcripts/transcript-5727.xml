FOR MEDIA SUNDAY, 20 DECEMBER 1981<br />
PROPOSED PREMIERS CONFERENCE/ LOAN COUNCIL MEETING<br />
The decision by the Commonwealth to invite the State<br />
Premiers and the Chief Minister of the Northern<br />
Territory to Canberra for a meeting in January arose<br />
from the Commonwealth's understanding of the problems<br />
facing the States funding some off their authoritics.<br />
Some of the recomendations of the Campbell Committee<br />
are relevant to the consideration of the financing<br />
of capital works by these authorities, and the Commonwealth<br />
wants to sit down with the States and work through<br />
the issues in a positive way.<br />
The decision to deny the investment allowance in cases<br />
where the real " end user" is a tax-exempt statutory<br />
authority is not aimed at preventing States from<br />
financing particular developments. The intent<br />
of the present law is that the investment allowance<br />
should apply only to plant from which the " end user"<br />
derives assessable income; it is a tax concession to<br />
tax payers and the States and their authorities are<br />
not usually tax-payers<br />
The January meeting is designed to examine these issues<br />
against the background of the Campbell Report. </p>
