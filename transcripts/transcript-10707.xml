    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE...............................................</p>
<p>  Ladies and Gentlemen, good afternoon. The Australian Government</p>
<p>   very warmly welcomes the announcement that was made by President</p>
<p>   Soeharto in Jakarta a short while ago. In our view, the President</p>
<p>   has laid down a very clear, orderly and statesman-like path for</p>
<p>   the transition of power in Indonesia in a way that is more guaranteed</p>
<p>   than any alternative to avoid bloodshed, to preserve intact the</p>
<p>   constitutional processes of the Indonesian State, and also to give</p>
<p>   hope to those many people within Indonesia who are looking for a</p>
<p>   more open society. Australia looks forward to the elections being</p>
<p>   held as quickly as possible and, as a result, the installation of</p>
<p>   a new President and Vice-President in Indonesia. We recognise that</p>
<p>   the country has passed through some very difficult times. We have</p>
<p>   been more conscious than most of the great economic strain that</p>
<p>   has been put upon Indonesia by events over recent months. And as</p>
<p>   you know, we have worked hard to ensure that the world community</p>
<p>   has taken a realistic attitude towards the problems of Indonesia</p>
<p>   in responding to her economic difficulties.</p>
<p>  We welcome the announcement, the interim announcement, by the President</p>
<p>   that he would establish a new reform Cabinet and that that Cabinet</p>
<p>   would be directed towards a number of issues including corruption</p>
<p>   and anti-trust activities. We, of course, see that as very much</p>
<p>   in his words as an interim measure because his announcement today</p>
<p>   was very much an announcement about providing and orderly transfer</p>
<p>   of power and about laying down the procedure whereby there could</p>
<p>   be a replacement for both himself and Dr Habibie.</p>
<p>  We do look forward to a speedy implementation of the changes. We</p>
<p>   know that Indonesia has gone through an enormous amount of pain</p>
<p>   and difficulty and we also believe that the steps that have been</p>
<p>   announced this afternoon, which if responded to with good will and</p>
<p>   cooperation by all those who exercise influence and assert authority</p>
<p>   within Indonesia, will provide a proper and orderly basis for the</p>
<p>   transfer of power.</p>
<p>  It is a moment in, not only the history of Indonesia, but also in</p>
<p>   the history of our region. Indonesia is the fourth most populous</p>
<p>   nation in the world. It is our nearest neighbour. We have very close</p>
<p>   ties with Indonesia, we care about the future of the Indonesian</p>
<p>   people. As I said a few days ago, our policy goal always has been</p>
<p>   to preserve and develop good relations between the people of Indonesia</p>
<p>   and the people of Australia irrespective of who might hold authority</p>
<p>   within Indonesia.</p>
<p>  Throughout these past difficult weeks we have said constantly that</p>
<p>   it is for the Indonesian people and for President Soeharto working</p>
<p>   through the institutions of the Indonesian state to resolve the</p>
<p>   difficulties the country now faces and to lay a pathway for the</p>
<p>   future. It would appear on the basis of this afternoon's statement</p>
<p>   that that has, in fact, been done. And it is a matter that I personally</p>
<p>   welcome very much. I congratulate the President on the wisdom that</p>
<p>   he's shown. I welcome his announcement. I believe it is appropriate.</p>
<p>   I believe it is timely. I think it is wise and it shows that, at</p>
<p>   a moment of greatest difficulty and challenge, he has put the interests</p>
<p>   of the Indonesian people first.</p>
<p>  I think it's also appropriate to reflect upon the enormous</p>
<p>   contribution that President Soeharto has made to the Indonesian</p>
<p>   people over the past 32 years. He took over at a time of enormous</p>
<p>   internal strain and difficulty. He has turned the Indonesian economy</p>
<p>   around and, although in recent weeks the focus has been on economic</p>
<p>   difficulty in Indonesia, if you look at the sweep of the past 32</p>
<p>   years, it can hardly be denied that President Soeharto has brought,</p>
<p>   relatively speaking, additional prosperity to the people of Indonesia.</p>
<p>   He has certainly presided over a significant reduction in levels</p>
<p>   of absolute poverty in that country. He has restored the economic</p>
<p>   repute on a number of occasions of the country that he has led.</p>
<p>   And he has certainly provided a great deal of cohesion and unity.</p>
<p>  Of course his administration has not been without either its critics</p>
<p>   or its flaws, and as I've said on a number of occasions, although</p>
<p>   Indonesia and Australia are very close and although we totally respect</p>
<p>   the right of peoples in our region to run their own countries, according</p>
<p>   to their own ideologies and their own beliefs, nonetheless we respect</p>
<p>   fully the fact that our society is different, that we have different</p>
<p>   attitudes, we have different approaches.</p>
<p>  But within that understanding, I don't think anybody can deny</p>
<p>   that if you look at the entirety of his 32 years in office, he has</p>
<p>   certainly been a very positive force for progress, for modernisation.</p>
<p>   He's been a formidable figure in regional forums. He's</p>
<p>   been a person of great influence amongst the ASEAN countries and</p>
<p>   the countries of our region. I have found in my own dealings with</p>
<p>   him over the past two and a little years that he is a person who</p>
<p>   values very much the relationship between our two countries. And</p>
<p>   I have tried very hard, particularly in recent months, to ensure</p>
<p>   that that relationship, on a country-to-country, people-to-people</p>
<p>   basis, has been preserved fully because we do look to the future.</p>
<p>  We have been, in recent times, a very good friend of Indonesia's.</p>
<p>   We are a good friend of Indonesia's and we will be a good friend</p>
<p>   of Indonesia's into the future. And we have demonstrated that</p>
<p>   friendship in a very practical way and I am very proud of what the</p>
<p>   Government has been able to do in that connection. It is in every</p>
<p>   sense, a momentous development in the history of Indonesia. It demonstrates</p>
<p>   a care and a sensitivity towards the welfare of his people which</p>
<p>   is to be commended. And I know that all people who think positively</p>
<p>   about Indonesia's future and are concerned about the welfare</p>
<p>   of that country and the avoidance of strife and bloodshed will want</p>
<p>   to see the reform arrangements and the transition arrangements which</p>
<p>   the President announced this afternoon given effect to as soon as</p>
<p>   possible.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, obviously the time-frame is important. Do you have</p>
<p>   any reservations about that time-frame if it turns out to be six</p>
<p>   months, twelve months?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I would not hope it took that long. I don't know what the precise</p>
<p>   time-frame is. It's a little early to know. I have spoken a</p>
<p>   few moments ago to our Ambassador in Jakarta, Mr McCarthy, who has</p>
<p>   given me an on-the-spot assessment. The belief is that the matters</p>
<p>   will be put in hand as soon as possible. I see the statement for</p>
<p>   what it says, and that is, it makes it very clear that neither he</p>
<p>   nor Dr Habibie will be candidates for re-election by the new Parliament.</p>
<p>   It speaks of a transition. I saw his remarks about his own personal</p>
<p>   future. I think the important thing is that he has laid down an</p>
<p>   orderly way of transferring power in a very difficult situation</p>
<p>   where rumours were flying around and different theories were being</p>
<p>   put on different statements and different patterns of behaviour.</p>
<p>   He has always been a man, as I have read him, who has placed a lot</p>
<p>   of store on constitutional form and whatever observations people</p>
<p>   might make about the institutions of government in Indonesia there</p>
<p>   is a form, there is a procedure. He is having a new election. There</p>
<p>   will be a new Parliament to choose a new President and a new Vice-President.</p>
<p>  Now, based on what I have heard, I accept that but I naturally say</p>
<p>   that the sooner that those processes are put in train the better.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, one of his Ministers has already indicated that</p>
<p>   the process could take up to two years. Would that be too long?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes. Anything that long would immediately lack credibility.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Should the IMF now reconsider the suspension of its loan programme?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think it's too early to make that judgement because it would</p>
<p>   be wrong to see what has happened in the last few weeks in Indonesia</p>
<p>   as being totally a product of what the IMF has done. Now I say that</p>
<p>   as somebody who was rather critical of some of the earlier offerings</p>
<p>   of the IMF and I remain of the view that the steps that Australia</p>
<p>   took, my Government took, to soften the IMF package were justified</p>
<p>   and, in fact, have been doubly justified by subsequent events. But</p>
<p>   we shouldn't gainsay the fact that there has been a building</p>
<p>   up of the pressure for change and the pressure for openness and</p>
<p>   modernisation, so far as political institutions are concerned in</p>
<p>   Indonesia, for some time and often, it's the conjunction of</p>
<p>   a set of circumstances rather than one circumstance alone that brings</p>
<p>   about change.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, do you feel now that the transition can occur peacefully</p>
<p>   or are you still concerned about the prospect of violence tomorrow</p>
<p>   when students demonstrate and there will be soldiers in the street?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I would hope that violence is now avoided and a lot will depend</p>
<p>   upon the role played by the army, and can I say for all the critics</p>
<p>   it has, that the Indonesian armed forces have played a very positive</p>
<p>   role, generally speaking, in this whole issue and I think have probably</p>
<p>   been a force for stability and a force for calm. One must always</p>
<p>   worry in a volatile situation where there has been a loss of life</p>
<p>   over the past few days but the early indications that I had a few</p>
<p>   moments ago are that on the streets, so to speak, of Jakarta, the</p>
<p>   President's announcement was accepted in a very positive way</p>
<p>   and was seen to be genuine.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, at two o'clock the Department of Foreign Affairs</p>
<p>   upgraded its travel warning to effective leave if you can. Given</p>
<p>   the President's announcement, should that be rescinded?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No I don't think I would be, sort of, rescinding anything at</p>
<p>   the present time, but Mr Downer may wish to say something about</p>
<p>   that, but I would have thought that was the proper, normal, logical</p>
<p>   precaution for the department to take at a time when the immediate</p>
<p>   future was not certain.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Will ...... remain in Darwin on standby?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  I think they do, don't they? Yes.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Are you concerned about the lack of an obvious sense of a line of</p>
<p>   succession to President Soeharto? Are you confident that if does</p>
<p>   happen speedily, as you have expressed a wish, there is time to</p>
<p>   put in place a successor with the experience and the capacity?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I am sure there is. Just as I have not got into the business of</p>
<p>   telling people publicly whether to stay or to go, as others have</p>
<p>   felt free to do, I certainly haven't and I wouldn't have</p>
<p>   thought it would have helped the relationship or would have been</p>
<p>   appropriate. Just as I don't think I should have done that</p>
<p>   equally I don't think I should be speculating about who should</p>
<p>   be the new candidate, except to say that I think there will be people</p>
<p>   there and I have no doubt that people will rise to the occasion</p>
<p>   and that there are people of great ability, and the fact that you</p>
<p>   have now got a process and you have a bit of time, I actually think</p>
<p>   that's more likely to produce the best outcome than if things</p>
<p>   had happened more precipitously.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, do you think that the events in Jakarta have lessened</p>
<p>   the pressures on the Australian dollar?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't know that I want to talk about the level of the Australian</p>
<p>   dollar. As you know, Mr Grant, it is not my wont either as Treasurer,</p>
<p>   it wasn't my wont as Treasurer or as Prime Minister to talk</p>
<p>   about the level of the dollar. I merely leave it at that.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, do you see any plans in the future for more aid</p>
<p>   for Indonesia?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, it's something that we would keep under review. We have</p>
<p>   for good reason, my Government and governments before it have invested</p>
<p>   a lot politically, diplomatically, economically and I guess on a</p>
<p>   people-to-people basis, emotionally in the relationship and in her</p>
<p>   time of great need, we stuck by Indonesia and that need is still</p>
<p>   there. Now, the question of whether there is any requirement for</p>
<p>   further financial assistance is something that we will take as the</p>
<p>   circumstances and the arguments come. I don't rule it out,</p>
<p>   I don't rule it in. We have been very generous already. We</p>
<p>   provided the aid package, and we of course also participated in</p>
<p>   the IMF bail-out, and I don't think there's any doubt</p>
<p>   that the Indonesians, whatever their views are about the regime</p>
<p>   or the future, see Australia as a very reliable friend, and as being</p>
<p>   a country that has a particular understanding of Indonesia and has</p>
<p>   a sensitivity towards the views of the Indonesian people that I</p>
<p>   hope is a little more finely tuned than that of some other countries.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Mr Howard are you confident that the election process will be seen</p>
<p>   as sufficiently democratic, that it is regarded as legitimate by</p>
<p>   the broad cross-section of Indonesians?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  That's almost impossible for me to answer. I hope it is. There</p>
<p>   will be enormous pressure on the Indonesians to conduct it in a</p>
<p>   bona fide fashion. Once you've gone through something like</p>
<p>   this, your society is permanently prised open, in a way, to world</p>
<p>   inspection, that it hasn't been in the past. And I don't</p>
<p>   think Indonesia, even if it wanted to, could go back to where it</p>
<p>   was before these events occurred. It's like imagining that</p>
<p>   the waterfront can go back to where it was before particular events</p>
<p>   occurred.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Can I ask a question on the timetable. Are you saying that six months</p>
<p>   is about the maximum time that ....?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, Tom, I didn't say that. I said that two years would be,</p>
<p>   would outrageously lack credibility. I don't want to start</p>
<p>   saying precisely what it is. I mean, I'm not getting into that.</p>
<p>   But let me say this. I think it should be as soon as possible. The</p>
<p>   sooner the better, the sooner the greater credibility. But if you</p>
<p>   started getting into periods like one or two years, that would clearly</p>
<p>   lack credibility.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  This calender year?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  I'm not going to answer that. I'm simply going to say</p>
<p>   I want it as quickly as possible. And I think the sooner the better</p>
<p>   and the quicker the more credibility, and the 12 months to two years</p>
<p>   would plainly lack any credibility at all.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Will you communicating with the President?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Yes I will. I'll be sending him a personal message as soon</p>
<p>   as this conference is over.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  What will you say?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  It will be a personal message, but it will certainly, amongst other</p>
<p>   things, reflect the views that I expressed about his stewardship</p>
<p>   of Indonesia over the past 32 years, the manner of his parting and</p>
<p>   the way in which he has risen to the demands of statesmanship to</p>
<p>   lay down a very orderly, I hope, peaceful path for the transition</p>
<p>   of power in a country of 200 million people. It is no mean feat.</p>
<p>   And what every other cynicism, or the cynicism of some may be, whatever</p>
<p>   the criticisms are, whatever the flaws of the political process</p>
<p>   in Indonesia are compared with those in other countries, or whatever</p>
<p>   the democratic shortcomings may be, and all the other things that</p>
<p>   we might say - given the enormity of the task, the diversity of</p>
<p>   that country, the tremendous pressures, the economic strains, the</p>
<p>   social dislocation, the social differences - given all of those</p>
<p>   things, the President, the Army, and many others, have acquitted</p>
<p>   themselves in my view very well, and if what he's laid down</p>
<p>   is played out in accordance with a reasonable timetable, I think</p>
<p>   history will recall that the manner of Soeharto's parting was</p>
<p>   that of a Statesman who cared about the future of his people. Thank</p>
<p>   you.</p>
