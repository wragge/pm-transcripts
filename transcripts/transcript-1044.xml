FOR PRESS: P. M. z/ 196<br />
TRIBUTE TO SIR WINSTON CHURCHILL<br />
Statement bythe Prime Ministe. the Rt. Hon. Sir Robert Menzies<br />
After a prolonged period of illness, Sir<br />
ainston Churchill's death was not unexpected. But it comes<br />
as a shock. At the height of his power and achievement,<br />
he " bestrode the world like a colossus" but, being no tyrant<br />
or dictator, he left all men in his debt,<br />
He was one of the great men in the whole course<br />
of British history and in the history of the struggle for<br />
freedom. As Prime Minister, he faced the greatest challenge<br />
of our lifetimes. He met it xvrith courage and imaginative<br />
genius. He was able to express and stimulate the spirit<br />
of his people by his immortal mixture of tenacity and humour<br />
harsh realism and indomitable optimism. So long as men retain<br />
their pride in liberty, he will never be forgotten.<br />
Through the many vicissitudes of his sometimes<br />
turbulent and always brilliant career, his wife, that marvellous<br />
woman, was with him&amp; She will, I hope and know, got some<br />
comfort from the love which goes out to her from so many<br />
millions of people at this time.<br />
