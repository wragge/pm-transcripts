    <content><![CDATA[<p>The sudden death today of the Liberal Party's Federal Vice-President, Bill Gatenby is a profound loss to the Party.</p>
<p>On the weekend the Tasmanian Division honoured Bill in the presence of his family as he stood down as President of the Party in that State. It was my privilege to pay tribute to Bill and to recognise his contribution over a long period.</p>
<p>Bill Gatenby epitomised the commitment of Liberals across the Australia to willingly give their all for the principles we jealously hold. He was a man of substance and fibre for the Party he led in Tasmania for three and half years.</p>
<p>As a standard bearer for our cause in Tasmania he led the Party in difficult circumstances at times and with quite meagre resources.</p>
<p>He was a strong representative of the organisation because he so forcefully advocated the cause of mainstream Tasmanians.</p>
<p>He brought very sound credentials to the Party. His background in farming and real estate, together with his commitment to landcare and his longstanding involvement in local events such as the Royal Launceston Show ensured that he was an able representative of his community.</p>
<p>I was delighted with Bill's election to the Federal Vice-Presidency of the Liberal Party in October last year. He was a constant champion of the Party grassroots both from his own State and nationally.</p>
<p>Bill Gatenby was a good and faithful servant of the Liberal Party. Party members throughout Australia owe him a great debt. I extend my sympathies to his widow, Margot and to his children, Andrew, Lucy and Sarah.</p>
<p>25 August 1997</p>
