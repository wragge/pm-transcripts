TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH ANGELA CATTERNS, TRIPLE J, 8 JUNE 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
AC: In the Morning Show with Angela Catterns, and joining us now from the<br />
Lodge, to fill us in more on his vision of an Australian republic, is the<br />
Prime Minister Paul Keating. Good morning, Mr Keating.<br />
PM: Good morning, Angela.<br />
AC: What sort of person do you think should be President?<br />
PM; Well, someone I think who commands the broad respect of the<br />
community, who can be the embodiment of the nation while ever he or<br />
she holds the office, and who can secure the support of the major<br />
parties.<br />
AC: Why should the Parliament choose the President, and not the people?<br />
PM: Because I think that were we to go to a popular election, the President<br />
would be the only person in the Australian political system who is<br />
popularly elected, and enjoying wide powers. You see, at the 1993<br />
election where people think I was elected Prime Minister, in fact I<br />
wasn't. I was elected the Member for Blaxiand. I was elected a<br />
member of the Labor Parliamentary Party. It's the parliamentary party<br />
who chose me to be Prime Minister, and it was the Governor-General<br />
who appointed me. And that goes for the Ministers they were elected<br />
to their seats, and they were chosen by the Caucus of the<br />
Parliamentary Party, and then appointed by the Governor-General.<br />
So, the system is at the moment diffuse it is wide, and there is no one<br />
person enjoying the preponderance of power. But if you elect<br />
somebody who has an election at large, who is there for say 5 years,<br />
and who can't be if you like unelected, and who also enjoys wide<br />
powers, the whole system of Government that we have of<br />
representative democracy, of people voting in their constituencies, of </p>
<p>MP's relating to their communities, of shifts in public opinion becoming<br />
very manifest and obvious on various issues as you see now that will<br />
become a thing of the past. And we would go to a far more<br />
Presidential system, such as France, where basically, the head of<br />
government is the head of state, and a President can just bring on and<br />
dismiss Prime Ministers as they see fit.<br />
AC: But won't leaving the choosing to politicians mean that they will choose<br />
a politician for the job?<br />
PM: No I think the opposite of that is true. It has been left to politicians<br />
now, and we have rarely ever chosen politicians for the job, other than<br />
those who have distinguished themselves. But what I said last night<br />
was that sitting parliamentarians can't run for office can't be<br />
considered nor can MP's who haven't retired 5 years earlier. The<br />
most likely because you would have to get the support of both major<br />
parties the most likely situation would be that you would get people<br />
like Sir Ninian Stephen, or Sir Zelman Cowan people who have long<br />
periods of distinguished service to the public and the community, who<br />
can command the support of say in this case, the Labor Party, the<br />
Coalition or the minor parties that's the sort of person you would get.<br />
But if you have an election, you will have the Labor Candidate for<br />
President, you will have the Liberal Party Candidate for President, and<br />
then you will have party election campaigns, and a party politician will<br />
win it, probably.<br />
AC: Mr Keating, so your suggestion is that the President be chosen by a<br />
two-thirds majority of parliament at a joint sitting. John Howard and<br />
Lloyd Waddy both pointed out past examples of where one party held<br />
a two-thirds majority of both Houses, had a joint sitting been held how<br />
could a President remain politically neutral then?<br />
PM: There has never been a situation since the War where one party<br />
has commanded a two-thirds majority.<br />
AC: But that's not to say it might not happen in the future?<br />
PM: It may not, and somebody made the point that if Malcolm Fraser had<br />
won one more seat in 1975, that Party would have had a two-thirds<br />
majority. Well, if the Liberal Party was then able to command such<br />
wide community support then, it was entirely appropriate then that that<br />
support be reflected in the choice of candidate for President. You see,<br />
I mean that if they are really saying that all of the rest of the political<br />
system didn't even add up to one-third in other words they had the<br />
two-thirds why should the one-third decide less than one-third<br />
decide who is to be the candidate?<br />
AC: What about the idea of having a referendum to determine how we<br />
choose the head of state, so that everybody at least has had a say? </p>
<p>PM: Well, the problem about that is that it's not a simple matter if, for<br />
instance, were we to decide to have a popular election, we wouldn't be<br />
in a position to leave the so-called reserve powers with that person.<br />
That is, were we to have a popular election, we would have to decide<br />
what powers the President had, compared to the current Governor-<br />
General. Now, under the proposal I outlined last night, they are the<br />
same powers. So, we are leaving quite substantial powers with the<br />
President, but we are saying the source on authority for the President<br />
is constrained by the mode of his or her election by the two houses of<br />
Parliament. But if it's to be a public election, where the president<br />
would be above the Prime Minister and the Cabinet and the<br />
Parliament, then we would have to seriously consider delineating the<br />
powers. That means, by Constitutional change, so there can be no<br />
simple referendum. Your question was why don't you let the people<br />
decide what the nature of the appointment is, but it can't be say<br />
popular election, or non-popular election, because to say popular<br />
election comes with a heap of qualifiers. But who says.. . who is to say<br />
what the qualifiers are? I mean, for a start the Liberal Party won't<br />
agree, and remember this that every word, every dot point, dotted " i"<br />
and crossed that goes to a referendum, has to go through the<br />
Federal Parliament. And then to be agreed, it has to be agreed by a<br />
majority of voters in a majority of States. So, in this one, you have got<br />
to be fairly sure the first time around that you have got an adoptable<br />
proposal. Because if you are not, the history of referenda in Australia<br />
is a very poor one.<br />
AC: You said you would let each State decide if they want to have an<br />
Australian head of state. Couldn't that lead to a ridiculous situation<br />
where the Commonwealth might be a republic, but certain States still<br />
keep the Queen as their head of state?<br />
PM: It would mean any State government that so decided that would have<br />
to run the gamut of public opinion. I mean, we would have the<br />
president of the Commonwealth of Australia and we would have the<br />
governor equivalent position in a number of States and then we would<br />
have somebody who was a representative of Queen Elizabeth the<br />
Second. Now, I think, most States, all States, would probably once the<br />
country decided to have a republic that they would quit on the idea.<br />
But you never know, but it would only last until the next Labor<br />
government came along and it would change anyway.<br />
AC: Mr Keating, should we have the right perhaps as suggested by the<br />
Democrats to at least make nominations for our president?<br />
PM: Well, the Democrats and the Liberal and National parties with this<br />
Government for instance, would have a right of consultation because it<br />
would be intolerable for a candidate to have the government of the day<br />
saying ' well look, we won't consult you, we will just propose at a joint </p>
<p>sitting your name, we won't consult the parties, we will just propose<br />
your name at a joint sitting'. What would happen is that person would<br />
be defeated. So, it will mean that the government of the day, if we are<br />
speaking of now, as Prime Minister I would need to approach the<br />
Coalition parties and the Democrats and say ' look, this is what we<br />
have in mind'. And so, that is the best form of consultation, I think, If<br />
they say ' oh no, we don't think that is the right person, will you come<br />
back with another person?' That is how a process like this would work.<br />
At the moment, the Prime Minister alone can at his or her nomination<br />
propose to the Queen the name of a person. For instance, as you<br />
know the current Governor-General is reaching the end of his term.<br />
Very shortly, I will open a process up with Queen Elizabeth about his<br />
replacement, but I have to secure no support from the Coalition or any<br />
other party. In this proposal it is a complete change. It would mean<br />
that the government's nominee has to have the support also of the<br />
other parties.<br />
AC: What would the referendum ask in 1998 or 1999?<br />
PM: It would be framed so as to competently make a constitutional shift to<br />
the republic. I don't think I am in a position now to give you the words,<br />
but the sense of it would be that the position of Governor-General<br />
would be removed from the Constitution and in place thereof the words<br />
' President of the Commonwealth of Australia' and there would be a<br />
change to the Constitution saying that that person should act primarily<br />
on ministerial advice and it would be framed pretty much as I said last<br />
night.<br />
AC: What is your reluctance about having a constitutional convention?<br />
PM: Because they are basically just elitist and they are not the initiating<br />
body. You see, the Constitutional Conventions nearly everyone in<br />
Australia who doesn't want to do anything says ' let's have a<br />
convention' because that is the great black hole of constitutional<br />
proposals. They are the dark holes of constitutional reform. They<br />
have nearly all failed since the war and we have held over a dozen of<br />
the things and as a consequence we have to face this fact: that we<br />
now have a Constitution this is not the 1890s in the 1890s the<br />
convention was the proponent of the Constitutional proposal. But once<br />
we adopted a Constitution and a Commonwealth of Australia, once we<br />
had the Constitution the Parliament and the Parliament only is the<br />
initiating body for a referendum. John Howard has been running<br />
around saying ' oh, let's have a People's Convention', but the greatest<br />
Peoples Convention is a referendum. We have got to get a majority of<br />
electors in a majority of States and a majority overall. There is the<br />
public expression, the democratic expression. But, to have a little elite<br />
group of 10 or 12 parliamentarians from each State, a representative<br />
sprinkle of the community groups, that is not a peoples convention, it is<br />
just an elite discussion group. </p>
<p>AC: But, if it transpires that that is what most Australians want, are you<br />
open minded about the way that this republic might come about?<br />
PM: Want, in which sense do you mean?<br />
AC: Well, if it transpires that during the debate now, that most people do<br />
want to have some kind of a convention, that they want to get together<br />
and discuss it more in more formal ways, are you open minded about<br />
they way it will come about?<br />
PM: I don't think people will want to be in a ruse. That is, the notion that a<br />
convention can propose a constitutional amendment when it can't. Do<br />
you understand? We have a Constitution which says the only initiating<br />
body is the Parliament. So no convention and no party leader not<br />
me, not John Howard, not anybody can give a convention that power.<br />
The power only resides with the Parliament. You see when pressed..<br />
you have got to read Mr Howard's text finely, someone said to him<br />
the other day and certainly to his predecessor ' does that mean that<br />
if you had a convention, you would then adopt the outcome of the<br />
convention?' ' oh, no, no, we would only take it as some advice to us.<br />
We wouldn't be under an obligation to actually put it into place'. In<br />
other words, what he wants is a talkshop. What he really wants is not<br />
to say where he stands. You see, I put the simple question to Mr<br />
Howard a number of times: does he believe an Australian person, an<br />
Australian, should be the Australian head of State? It is not a complex<br />
question. It is a very simple issue. He has a chance tonight to tell us.<br />
He is more likely to tell us, on his record of the last couple of days, he<br />
is more likely to tell us that he will have a constitutional convention<br />
which will discuss the Senate powers or discuss the external affairs<br />
power. In other words, he will do anything but say that he believes in<br />
the monarchy which is what, I believe, he still believes in. He believes<br />
in having the English Monarch as the Australian head of state and the<br />
only way he can dispel that notion of belief in that system is to say he<br />
stands for an Australian being our head of state.<br />
AC: Mr Keating, how will you gauge public reaction and opinion and debate<br />
about your proposals. How will you keep your ear to the ground?<br />
PM: You can tell with these debates, all of us, you are in the broadcasting<br />
business Angela, and you can feel the opinion change on your<br />
program you can talk to people, you can say ' look, that's going poorly'<br />
or ' that's going well' and if you look at the debate today, the ambient<br />
climate within which this proposal has been launched compared to,<br />
say, two and half years ago when I first mentioned it in the policy<br />
speech at the election. It is a completely different climate. And, what<br />
we are saying is from here to 1998 or 1999 which is a number of years<br />
away, there is an adequate opportunity to debate for the first time a set<br />
of proposals. Last night I gave the nation a set of proposals to debate. </p>
<p>Not just a waffly idea about a republic, but actually saying what the<br />
modalities of such a change would be. What the mode of such a<br />
change might be. What we will do is listen to the debate, hear what<br />
people say and cut our cloth accordingly. But, I bring you back to that<br />
central point, the only body in the Constitution able to propose a<br />
constitutional amendment is the Parliament. So, it must come back to<br />
the Government in the House of Representatives.<br />
AC: Mr Keating, was that an exciting thing to do, to give that speech in<br />
Parliament last night? It was quite exciting to watch.<br />
PM: I think it was a great pity, in a sense, that in the telecast the ABC<br />
completed it the moment I stopped speaking, because they wouldn't<br />
have seen the public galleries break out in spontaneous applause<br />
which was very surprising and pleasing to me. Normally the public<br />
galleries are very restrained in the Parliament, but as far as I could<br />
see, it was unanimous. There would have been 700 or 800 people<br />
there. So, it was a fair test, I thought, of whether the proposals in the<br />
speech were capable of engendering, as I have said before, a touch of<br />
excitement. I think, it probably did.<br />
AC: Who do you think will be most resistant to change?<br />
PM: I think John Howard. The reason I do is because I think he is a 1970s<br />
politician with a 1950' s view of the world.<br />
AC: Mr Keating, you said no former politician can run for five years after<br />
leaving politics if they were to run for the position of president. If you<br />
stepped down next year, that means you could be up for the post in<br />
2001, is that an attractive career option for you?<br />
PM: No, and I would never nominate for it, ever. Not ever.<br />
AC: Why not?<br />
PM: No, because, I think, this [ PM] is the paramount political job in terms of<br />
the capacity to effectively change and reform an economy and society<br />
and I also don't believe that anybody so associated with a<br />
constitutional change like this should, in some way, exploit it or take<br />
advantage of it. So, for my part, I would never consider the position.<br />
This is not about me. This is about Australia being able to adequately<br />
represent the country we have become. The people we are and the<br />
clear notion that the head of state could only, really, represent<br />
Australia well when that person is one of us.<br />
AC: Mr Keating, just finally, who do you think might be the last Governor-<br />
General, given that your model is accepted and goes ahead? </p>
<p>PM: That is something the Government has got to think about in the next<br />
few months.<br />
AC: And assuming that there is an election before his term is up, might you<br />
take into account Mr Howard's views and wishes regarding who would<br />
be the Governor-General?<br />
PM: If I asked Mr Howard or Mr Fraser in the last period of their office,<br />
would they desist from making an appointment of Governor-General or<br />
a legitimate appointment of that government within the capacity of that<br />
government, within the gift of that government. They would reject such<br />
a proposal out of hand. This is an appointment which the Government<br />
will soon have to put into motion. Normally, the protocols are that the<br />
Prime Minister starts to enter into a discussion with Her Majesty about<br />
six months before the appointment is made and the position changes<br />
and that period is coming up now and were Mr Howard to be Prime<br />
Minister and were I to ask him to delay this into the next Parliament, he<br />
would laugh at me.<br />
AC: Mr Keating, thank you so much for your time this morning. It has been<br />
terrific to have you on the morning show.<br />
PM: Good Angela, thank you indeed.<br />
