. PRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT 4L MAY 1979<br />
PRIME MINISTER'S PRESS CONFERENCE: MANILA, PHILIPPINES<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, this is the conclusion of what I believe<br />
to be a very successful visit to the Philippines. A rapport<br />
has been established between the President and myself, between<br />
our two governments. Two agreements have been signed and that<br />
was not expected. That was not planned when I was first<br />
asked to come here, but the discussions and relationship<br />
has developed to the extent that that has been possible.<br />
We welcome therefore the signature of the double taxation<br />
agreement, but in particular the ratification of the<br />
trade agreement between the Philippines and Australia which<br />
as you know had been negotiated sometime ago but not signed.<br />
The fact that it now has, is a significant step in Philippines-<br />
Australian relations. We've had wide-ranging discussions on<br />
other matters, security matters, matters of international<br />
affairs, and again, there is an identity of interest which<br />
comes out of our common geography in this part of the world.<br />
This morning I've also had very useful discussions with<br />
Prime Minister Ohira, in particular in relation to the<br />
forthcoming Tokyo Summit meeting. We were discussing the<br />
sorts of matters which would be important to that meeting.<br />
Publicly, I would like to say how much I appreciate the<br />
President's hospitality and his Government's hospitality during<br />
this week. I would be happy to try and answer whatever<br />
questions you might have.<br />
QUESTION Mr. Prime Minister, how do you react to the Singapore statement<br />
( on air fares) at the general debate on UNCTAD?<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
There has been agreement in Kuala Lump ur, and you<br />
will see from the communique that has been signed that the<br />
Philippines and Australia are both welcoming that there<br />
has been a negotiated compromise in relation to that, and<br />
the words in the communique I think are warmly recognising the<br />
fact that a compromise has been reached, as has to be so in<br />
matters of this kind.<br />
QUESTION Could you please give us some details on the uranium supply<br />
arrangements... ( inaudible). / 2 </p>
<p>2-<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
Yes. We have sigied the bilateral safeguards agreement<br />
between the Philippines and Australia and that opens the way<br />
for a supply agreement. Shortly, both countries ought to be<br />
in a position to negotiate a supply agreement. We will be a<br />
reliable supplier of uranium to the Philippines.<br />
QUEST ION<br />
. Volumes?<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
We haven't discussed volumes, but I have no. reason to doubt that<br />
we could meet the Philippines requirements.<br />
QUESTION Regarding the 1975 Trade Agreement signed with the Philippines<br />
power, entered into with the Philippines, what is the ( inaudible)<br />
now? Is there any possibility of getting it into operation?<br />
Will it be operational soon? The 1975 Trade Agreement with the<br />
Philippines? PRIME MINISTER<br />
The Trade Agreement? It has now been ratified so it is now<br />
operative. QUESTION It has already been ratified?<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
Yes. We did that this morning. This hadnot been planned before<br />
I came here, but it was possible because of the progress made<br />
at the talks between the President and myself;. There are<br />
copies of the trade agreement available for those who would<br />
like to see it.<br />
QUESTION I am from Malaysia. Yesterday in your speech you made an<br />
attack on protectionism. Could you please tell this press<br />
conference what measures your country is taking to reduce the<br />
level of protectionism in Australia. ( Inaudible)... . ASEAN<br />
countries that... ( inaudible).<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
I think the best way of looking at this is to look at what<br />
has happened to ASEAN's exports into Australia and indeed the<br />
developing countries as a whole their exports to Australia.<br />
Over the last many, many years our imports fromi developing<br />
countries and from ASEAN have been growing at something over<br />
percent a year. That is a very substantial rate of growth.<br />
I concede that it started from a low base, but 30 percent,<br />
built upon 30 percent year after year, adds up to a signficant<br />
growth indeed. As a result of the Kuala Lumpur meeting between<br />
/ 13 </p>
<p>3-<br />
PRIME MINISTER ( continued)<br />
ASEAN I-eads of Government and myself a couple of years ago,<br />
we have established an ASEAN-Australia consultative committee. It's an<br />
early warning device and that gives us permanent machinery<br />
in which we will be enabled to discuss trade problems. Under<br />
the trade treaty signed with the Philippines there will be<br />
special consultative arrangements between the Philippines and<br />
Australia in addition. Last year I opened at ASEAN-Australia<br />
Trade Fair which flowed out of an initiative from the Kuala<br />
Lumpur meeting. That Trade Fair was designed to bring<br />
the products of ASEAN countries more to the notice of<br />
Australian importers. I believe it was a highly successful<br />
Trade Fair and it is something that, on the Australia side,<br />
we are very happy to repeat. The first was held in Sydney.<br />
If it is desired to hold successful trade fairs in other major<br />
cities of Australia well that will certainly have our<br />
cooperation and our support. It is important that ASEAN<br />
exporters get closely in touch with Australian importers because<br />
in some things of course, there is competition between ASEAN<br />
countries themselves, but there is also competition with<br />
similar products from Taiwan, Hong Kong and Korea. Therefore<br />
to the maxium extent that ASEAN can develop a close relationship<br />
with Australian entrepreneurs and Australian importers, the<br />
better then will ASEAN countries do in the Australian market.<br />
But the real basis of it is of course is that ASEAN's exports<br />
to Australia have been growing very rapidly and if you take<br />
the sensitive items textiles, apparel and footwear if the<br />
United States, Europe and Japan bought on a per capita basis<br />
the same value of imports as we do in Australia, then the<br />
ASEAN countries alone would be exporting an extra $ 1,000 million<br />
worth of goods a year. I think the Australian record in these<br />
matters is a good one.<br />
QUESTION What is the extent of Australia's development aid in the<br />
Philippines and other ASEAN countries, and what specific role<br />
does Australia have in bringing about basic elements of<br />
the Common Fund?<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
We play a signficant role in the Asian Development Bank. I<br />
think the two largest single aid projects which we are<br />
supporting are both in the Philippines and Australia aid is<br />
spread through many countries of South East Asia but also<br />
in the Pacific. We have a particular relationship with<br />
Papua New Guinea and a very large part of Australia's aid<br />
does go to Papua New Guinea because of the particular relationship<br />
that we have with Papua New Guinea. I think you would understand<br />
the reasons for that. I believe that Australia has played<br />
a significant role in bringing about agreement in relation to<br />
the Common Fund, because up to 18 or so months ago the " B Group"<br />
countries had a rigid position Group 77 had a rigid position<br />
the two sides weren't really meeting. Their ideas weren't<br />
touching each other. We believe, from our own experience<br />
as a commodity exporter that sensible devised commodity<br />
arrangements can work, can be beneficial to producer countries<br />
and also to consumer countries. Because the Australian economy 4 </p>
<p>-4-<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
at early times was very much dependent upon the fortunes of<br />
two or three commodities what, meat in particular, and wooland<br />
the prices of those commodities used to fluctuate<br />
enormously, we can well understand the difficulties that<br />
developing countries are placed in under present circumstances.<br />
So we decided that we should no longer about 18 months<br />
ago no longer stick rigidly with the " B Group" position.<br />
We announced our own position, our forthright support for<br />
the Fund and we started negotiations we started to try and<br />
flexibility into the negotiations so that people would move<br />
their positions. In the Commonwealth of Nations and in<br />
regional forums, at a meeting last New Year in Jamaica,<br />
we pressed very strongly for the acceptance of a Common Fund.<br />
Now the Fund is a reality. I hope as many countries as possible<br />
will support the second window operations but also, it is<br />
not good enough as I indicated in a speech to UNCTAD to<br />
rest upon the existence of a Common Fund. There must be full<br />
participation of developed and developing countries, of the<br />
producer countries and consumer countries with an interest in<br />
the trade, in various commodity agreements. It was in that<br />
context that I gently mentioned my disappointment with the<br />
policies of Europe in being unwilling so far to enter the<br />
International Sugar Agreement.<br />
QUESTION<br />
Yesterday at a press conference the French Minister for the<br />
Economy, who is also the current President of the EEC Council<br />
of Ministers, rejected the criticism you made of the EEC in<br />
your speech to UNCTAD as entirely unjustified. He said further<br />
that he felt you were biased and obsessive about the EEC<br />
and suggested that you could have made some comments about<br />
Japan's huge trade surplus and its, what he claimed, poor<br />
performance in absorbing imports. I wonder if you feel<br />
whether your comments about the EEC at the UNCTAD session,<br />
your criticism, was ill-advised.<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
Not at all. I am fully responsible for what I say but it<br />
was obviously said on advice. It was said advisedly. I think<br />
that it ought to be understood that Japan has made a very<br />
significant effort over recent times to reduce those trade<br />
surpluses. I think that in the month of March, for example,<br />
there might even have been a complete turn-around. That's<br />
not necessarily a long-term trend, but it is bearing fruit<br />
and Japan has been making very significant efforts to increase<br />
its imports in a number of commodities, in a number of goods.<br />
But I think really the thrust of what I was saying is<br />
verified by some International MNonetary Fund direction of trade<br />
figures they are not Australian figures, they are not<br />
European figures, they are International Monetary Fund figureswhich<br />
indicate that if you take out the OPEC countries,<br />
because they are a special case and if you take out the<br />
newly industrialised countries because they are also in a sense a<br />
special case they are the countries that are doing better<br />
and then you take the other Third World countries which are<br />
the countries most in need of assistance, countries most in </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER ( continued)<br />
need of assistance, countries most in need of access to<br />
markets, you will then find that Europe's imports from<br />
these other Third World countries has fallen between 1971 and<br />
1977 as a percentage of their total imports., fallen, as<br />
a percentage of their total imports over that period. It<br />
has fallen I haven't got the precise figures but it has<br />
also fallen for the Lome countries over the same period.<br />
Now if the borne convention was operating as one would<br />
have hoped one would have expected that the imports of other<br />
Third World countries, the ones most in need of<br />
assistance, would have increased as a proportion of the<br />
Community's total imports. But it hasn't. It has fallen.<br />
That I think just reinforces the need for an examination of<br />
these particular issues. I ought to say for the completeness<br />
of the answer that partly as a result of measures that we<br />
have taken Australia's imports from other Third World countries<br />
as a percentage of our total imports, has in fact increased.<br />
QUESTION<br />
May we know the results of your talks with Prime Minister Ohira?<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
The discussions with Prime Minister Ohira were very fruitful<br />
and useful and forthright. The discussions were held in particular<br />
to discuss broad international matters and matters that will<br />
be raised at the forthcoming Summit meeting. The Prime Minister<br />
had put to us that he would appreciate Australia's views on the<br />
kinds of matters that ought to be raised and dealt with by the<br />
major countries when they meet in that Summit meeting.<br />
We, on the broader issues, emphasised the need to maintain<br />
the fight against inflation and emphasised the linkage that that<br />
has with the trading opportunities for the Third World; the<br />
linkage that it has with the North/ South relationship, because<br />
inflation,, as I indicated at UNCTAD, drives countries toward<br />
protectionism and diminishes the quantity and volume of trade<br />
and diminishes the possibility of better access for developing<br />
countries. In addition, we spoke of the need to, in the<br />
post-MTN context, to keep up the pressure against renewed<br />
and increased forms of proctionism. I emphasised the need<br />
to give support to the positive adjustment policies supported<br />
by the OECD. I think. somnetimes there might be some misunderstanding<br />
of the nature of those policies, and that might come from<br />
the name. But broadly, the positive adjustment policies supported<br />
by the OECD, are exhorting__ the countri -es not to do certain<br />
things, not to go into wage subsidies,-not to subsidise<br />
inefficient industries, not to put up additional barriers to<br />
trade, to let the adjustment process work without undue<br />
government interference. I put the point of view that a<br />
re-affirmation of support for those principles would be useful,.<br />
especially if it was followed by positive action by the<br />
countries that most vigorously do not support, in their<br />
national policies,, have not supported the OECD view. I also<br />
raised the question of selective safeguards and again pointed<br />
to the dangers inherent in that. We discussed energy matters<br />
and I expressed an understanding of the problems of energy<br />
importing Countries, their need for security, their need for<br />
/ 6 </p>
<p>-6<br />
PRIME MINISTER ( continued)<br />
stability in energy supplies and have of course committed<br />
Australia, as has been consistent with our policy for a<br />
number of years, to be a reliable and stable supplier of<br />
energy sources. I pointed to our supplies of coal, future<br />
supplies of uranium, and present and future natural gas<br />
developments which could be very significant, for example,<br />
in giving, providing, Japan and other countries with<br />
reliable and steady sources of supply not of oil because<br />
we don't have oil to export but other forms of energy which<br />
would give a degree of independence from some OPEC policies.<br />
QUEST ION<br />
Yesterday in your speech you mentioned a review mechanism<br />
with regards to protectionism. Could you give us some mnore information<br />
aboutthis. Will it be a proposal ( inaudible). My other question<br />
is you mentioned the important role of UNCTAD in the North/ South<br />
Dialogue. Are you going to propose any high level commission<br />
for strengthening the UNCTAD Secretariat, like some countries<br />
would like to do and ( inaudible)...<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
I haven't got specific proposals to make about strengthening<br />
the UNCTAD Secretariat but if proposals are made Australia would<br />
certainly want to examine them in a constructive way, because<br />
as I indicated UNCTAD is a very necessary forum. If it did..-not<br />
exist there would have to be something like it to fill its<br />
purpose. It would have to be devised forthwith and it<br />
obviously needs to be able to undertake its task with reasonable<br />
but adequate resources. I think in relation to protectionism,<br />
I was principally saying that once the MTN is over it is not<br />
good enough just to sit back and relax, because in the kind<br />
of trading world that we are living in, the protectionist<br />
pressures are always present I think in all countries and it<br />
is going to be necessary for national governments to pursue<br />
to the maximum extent they can open trading policies and to<br />
maintain and to enhance the fight against, especially against,<br />
non-tariff measures of protection which have proliferated over<br />
the last ten years. I did not envisage any specific<br />
machanism for doing that, there are already international forums<br />
with a capacity for that but the national decisions of the<br />
major countries at the Tokyo Summit can obviously of course have<br />
a very real impact because from the very nature of the size of<br />
their economies, what they do affects all of us.<br />
QUESTION Did Mr. Ohira raise with you Australia's ( inaudible) on<br />
commodity exports and ( inaudible) possible changes to Australia's<br />
( inaudible) guidelines... ( inaudible).<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
In relation to foreign investment we wanted to make sure that<br />
there would be opportunities for Japan and I said that the </p>
<p>-7<br />
PRIME MINISTER ( continued)<br />
policy is designed to encourage overseas investment, but<br />
traditionally most overseas investment has come from<br />
Britain or from the United States more recently from a<br />
number of other countries including Japan and we welcome<br />
the increasing interest from coun1tries such as Japan in<br />
broadening the base of overseas investment in Australia.<br />
But I also pointed out that if some countries started<br />
earlier and nothing can alter that situation, they are<br />
already there, but that we would welcome Japanese involvement,<br />
especially in partnership with Australian concerns in<br />
resource exploration and development. That's a matter that<br />
can be taken up by officials and on a commercial<br />
basis. On the question of exports, it was put to me that Australia<br />
should not introduce measures that would be designed to<br />
inhibit the export of coal or of minerals, and I indicated<br />
that on the contrary our policies were designed to encourage<br />
and enhance the export of raw materials from Australia, but<br />
that from time to time there had been some particular<br />
marketing problems. But our approach had not been to meet<br />
those problems when they did exist by restrictions on exports<br />
but by sensible negotiation on a commercial basis. Quite<br />
plainly, the thrust of our policies is to encourage<br />
exports at the best price available on a commercial basis.<br />
QUESTION<br />
You said that ( inaudible)... attempting the development of<br />
energy capability of the Philippines Government and you said<br />
that you would be a reliable and ( inaudible). Could you tell<br />
us, do you extend the same capacity to other ASEAN countries.<br />
Would you ( inaudible).., bilateral agreement between you,<br />
( inaudible) and other ASEAN countries?<br />
PRIME. MINISTER<br />
Our general export policies are ones which apply to all<br />
countries. We do, obviously, seek a particularly close<br />
relationship with ASEAN countries and we welcome in particular<br />
the individual trade treaty which has now been ratified between<br />
the Philippines and Australia. But our committment to be a<br />
reliable supplier of energy is one it's not just a bilateral<br />
policy it's a general policy. Now, I need to make one<br />
qualification in relation to that. Where trade in uranium is<br />
involved, our policy does require a bilateral safeguards<br />
treaty between Australia and the country concerned. Such a<br />
treaty has been signed with the Philippines and if other<br />
countries wish to buy Australian uranium, it would be necessary<br />
to negotiate that bilateral safeguards treaty. But you would<br />
understand the reasons for that; it is as a backup to the<br />
international safeguards to prevent proliferation and it is<br />
of vast importance to all of us that trade in uranium as a<br />
supply of energy for peaceful purposes, must be conducted in<br />
a way that is not only safe but which demonstrates to other<br />
countries not party to the actual sale that the trade is being<br />
conducted in a safe way that supports the general world<br />
non-proliferation objective. Our policies arc general ones and<br />
/ 8 </p>
<p>8-<br />
PRIME MINISTER ( continued)<br />
and we will be pursuing them in those ways. To say that<br />
the policies are general is not in any sense to limit the<br />
importance or reduce the importance of a bilateral trade<br />
treaty on which we do place a great deal of importance<br />
with the Philippines, other trade treaties with many other<br />
countries, and they commit the governments and entrepenuers<br />
in both countries to do what they can to advance mutual<br />
trade between countries. I think that is a very desirable<br />
objective and again, one of the reasons I am particularly<br />
glad that the treaty negotiated with the Philippines a long while<br />
ago has now been ratified. I think it clearly is a mark of<br />
a new phase, a new stage, in the development of Philippine<br />
Australian relations. I think that is as a result of<br />
policies that we have been applying over recent times--policies<br />
which have resulted, as I indicated, in substantial increases<br />
in exports from ASEAN countries the Philippine figure is<br />
better than the average, it is over 45 percent a year increase<br />
in exports from the Philippines to Australia.-As a result<br />
of those policies, we've advanced our relationship to the<br />
stage where that treaty can be ratified with great<br />
confidence for the future.<br />
QUESTION The joint communique mentioned that the two leaders noted<br />
the ( inaudible) between the U. S. and China ( inaudible)<br />
Since Taiwan is one of the major trading partner of Australia...<br />
do you have any ( inaudible).<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
That is a matter that is under actual examination at the<br />
moment. We do need to indicate also that the previous<br />
Australian government normalised its relationship with<br />
Peking in a somewhat different way from the United States, so<br />
therefore that establishes a different set of circumstances.<br />
There is trade between Taiwan and Australia. Those'arrangements<br />
can be are under a degree of examination because our<br />
objective is to enhance and encourage trade between Australia<br />
and all countries. 000---</p>
