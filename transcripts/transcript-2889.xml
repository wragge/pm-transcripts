AU ST RALIAL PRESS STATEMENT No. 72.<br />
8 April 1973<br />
HEART WEEK 1973<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam, today ( Sunday)<br />
launched Heart Week 1973.<br />
Heart Week is the focus of the education effort<br />
of the National Heart Foundation of Australia.<br />
This year the foundation is concentrating on<br />
encouraging early recognition and treatment of high blood<br />
pressure which it has found to be a major causal factor<br />
in about 52,000 deaths every year.<br />
Mr Whitlam said today: " In opening Heart Week<br />
1973, I support the National Heart Foundation's efforts<br />
to inform people of the dangers of high blood pressure.<br />
" High blood pressure is easily the most common<br />
chronic disease in Australia.<br />
" It afflicts an estimated 1,200,000 Australian<br />
adults and more than half of them are unaware of their<br />
condition. " That is why the Foundation is emphasising this<br />
problem in its education campaign th~ is year.<br />
" The campaign will stress the point that, while<br />
high blood pressure is a serious disease, its treatment<br />
can be simple and effective.<br />
" The first step is for people to have their blood<br />
pressure checked regularly and I am happy to joint the<br />
Foundation in urging all Australian adults to do this.<br />
" This alone will lead to a lowering of illness<br />
and death from coronary heart disease, strokes and other<br />
conditions of which high blood pressure is a major cause.<br />
" If Australians follow the Foundation's advice,<br />
we will have a healthier nation." </p>
