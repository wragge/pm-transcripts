CECKAGAINST DELIVERY FMBARQCOFD UNTIL DlELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
LAUNCH OF ' SHIP TO SHORE'<br />
MELBOURNE 21 NOVEMBER 1990<br />
There is no container port of greater significance in<br />
Australia than the Port of Melbourne. It is Australia's<br />
largest port with assets of over $ 1 billion; it generates<br />
annual income of $ 120 million; and It handles around 40% of<br />
Australia's container traffic.<br />
And as Rupert Lockwood's book ' Ship to Shore'<br />
comprehensively proves, there can surely be no port with a<br />
more colourful past dating back to the earliest days of<br />
European settlement of the Port Phillip area.<br />
It was here that the excitement and chaos of the Gold Rush<br />
was so vividly experienced; it was here that the new<br />
Melbourne Wharf Laborers' Union the predecessor of the<br />
Waterside Workers' Federation, formed 105 years ago helped<br />
pioneer the arbitration system; it was here that the<br />
dislocation and trauma of the Depression spilled over into<br />
violence~ and bloodshed; it was here that war tine and boom<br />
time and the modern technological revolution have forced the<br />
pace of dramatic change.<br />
Given such a sweep of events, a well-told and well-informed<br />
historic record is essential; we should be reminded both of<br />
the defe3ats and the victories, the failures as well as the<br />
successes. With ' Ship to Shore' we now have such a record,<br />
and the Melbourne branch of the Waterside Workers'<br />
Federation is to be congratulated for its initiative, and<br />
Rupert Lockwood congratulated for his efforts in telling<br />
this story.<br />
The Federation and the Australian Labor Party go back a long<br />
way together. When your national Federation was launched in<br />
1902 in Australia's first Parliament House that is, the<br />
Parliament House in Melbourne it was headed by a committee<br />
of Labor~ politicians. Lockwood disparagingly refers to this<br />
group of men " who, with one exception, had never clutched a<br />
cargo hook".<br />
3422<br />
I </p>
<p>But I don't want to dwell on the past as richly<br />
embroidered. with larger-than-life figures and events as it<br />
is. To do so would be a lost opportunity, because there is<br />
so much that is important happening now, that has profound<br />
and enduring effects for the future of Melbourne's, and<br />
Australia'sa, waterfront.<br />
What we arel seeing at present is nothing less than a<br />
sweeping transformation of the attitudes and the<br />
institutions of the waterfront.<br />
The reason I was happy to accept your invitation to address<br />
you today is that it provides me with a very welcome<br />
opportunity to recognise the role of the Federation in this<br />
great transformation and to congratulate the Federation<br />
and all its members for the positive and constructive<br />
contribution they are making to it.<br />
The Federation's dealings with Victorian farmers illustrates<br />
just one aspect of this transformation. For many years,<br />
relations with the agricultural sector of this State a<br />
sector that relies very heavily on the waterfront to ensure<br />
its produce reaches the markets in time and in top condition<br />
were not exactly close.<br />
It's very mnuch to the credit of both sides that these<br />
problems have been addressed in a frank and commonsense way<br />
at the negotiating table, face to face, as they should be.<br />
This has made both sides much more informed about each<br />
other's needs and processes.<br />
The last few years have seen such a dramatic improvement in<br />
relations that visits up-country by waterfront workers, and<br />
visits to the port by farmers, are now regular events.<br />
Today it is a particular pleasure to know that this audience<br />
includes a number of farmers' representatives as the special<br />
and welcome guests of the Waterside Workers Federation.<br />
In this small but significant way you have successfully<br />
demonstrated the truth of one of the central principles of<br />
my Government. It is only by working together and by<br />
recognising each other's point of view that Australia as a<br />
whole will gain the capacity to build a new era of economic<br />
productivity and prosperity.<br />
Before I talk about the details of waterfront reform, I want<br />
to put it in its proper perspective the perspective<br />
provided by more than seven and a half years of Government,<br />
in which we have consistently followed a strategy directed<br />
at improving the quality of life for all Australians.<br />
Our strategy has seen consistent pursuit of these goals:<br />
sustained and sustainable economic growth;<br />
continuing employment growth;<br />
controlled and equitable wage growth; 3423 </p>
<p>increased efficiency and international orientation of<br />
the economy aiming at a transition to a competitive<br />
world class economy fully enmeshed in the dynamism of<br />
the Asia-Pacific region;<br />
a fairer society created through radical welfare<br />
reform, with the emphasis on better services for<br />
families and for the aged and sick; but all of this<br />
within the context of unprecedented financial<br />
responsibility and restraint;<br />
a clevrer country in which intellectual skills are<br />
prized and harnessed to the broader needs of the<br />
community; and<br />
an environment safeguarded for future generations<br />
through policies of ecologically sustainable<br />
development.<br />
Everybody -in this audience will be familiar with the phrase<br />
micro-economic reform. Indeed more than most Australians,<br />
you are at the front line of micro-economic reform. I want<br />
to make sure today that you understand the direct and<br />
integral way in which micro-economic reform contributes to<br />
the pursuit of these broad goals.<br />
The transformation we are seeing on the waterfront, taken<br />
together with the sweeping reforms across the whole spectrum<br />
of the Australian economy, is starting to yield the benefits<br />
we seek for all Australians: better employment prospects, a<br />
more capab * le and diverse export performance, and higher<br />
productivity, opening the door for a steadily stronger<br />
Australian achievement in the competitive markets in the<br />
world. The Federal Government has overhauled the system of taxation<br />
in this country, introducing a fairer and more efficient<br />
system in which all Australians pay their fair share. We<br />
have fostered a more cooperative and constructive approach<br />
to industriLal relations in this country. We have slashed<br />
the inefficiencies of tariff protection, liberalised the<br />
financial system, and improved the management of Government<br />
Business Enterprises.<br />
During the last election campaign I promised to accelerate<br />
further tho pace of such micro-economic reforms. You will<br />
be aware that only a fortnight ago I delivered to Parliament<br />
a comprehensive statement of our achievements in this regard<br />
achievements that we have recorded in the last eight<br />
months. I referred to the recent Special Premiers' Conference at<br />
which the Premiers, Chief Ministers and I were able to<br />
achieve lanting reforms in a genuinely constructive and<br />
positive at~ mosphere a very welcome change from the normal,<br />
somewhat acrimonious, tone of such gatherings.<br />
3424 </p>
<p>We recognised the truth that if we are credibly to seek a<br />
more efficient and dynamic performance from employers and<br />
workers in the private sector, we had also to make sure that<br />
the public sector is as efficient as it can be.<br />
For the Federal Government, we have over the past seven and<br />
a half years steadily built a leaner public sector that is<br />
better focussed on its essential tasks.<br />
At the Premiers' Conference we embarked on a new effort to<br />
make the federal system itself the way the three tiers of<br />
Federal, State and local government relate to each other<br />
more effic: ient and better attuned to the demands of our<br />
complex modern society.<br />
Never before have the heads of all the Australian<br />
Governments been able to achieve such progress in this task.<br />
Among our achievements, we signed an agreement to bring new<br />
investment and improved performance to rail freight, and<br />
complementing this we were able also to start work on<br />
improving the funding and standards of road transport.<br />
Parallel to all this, the Australian Labor Party has<br />
pioneered a dramatic change in Australia's<br />
telecommunications industry. As a result, there will be new<br />
investment, new Jobs, new exports, and for consumers,<br />
cheaper services and greater choice all within the context<br />
of a strong public sector involvement in this vital<br />
industry. And we have at last liberated domestic aviation from the<br />
dead hand of the two-airline agreement, opening the door to<br />
new services and lower prices.<br />
This is the context of determined and dynamic change in<br />
which the Government's commitment to reform of the<br />
waterfront must be seen. Let me today spell out what the<br />
key elements of the Government's approach have been.<br />
First, we made sure that we knew, and that all of the other<br />
parties involved in the waterfront knew, just what the<br />
existing problems were. We didn't rush in with a<br />
confrontationist approach that sought to shove some<br />
ideological remedy down people's throats.<br />
After a very deliberate process of examination of the<br />
industry's problems and needs, we announced on 1 June 1989<br />
a date that will loom large in future histories that will be<br />
written of the Australian waterfront a comprehensive<br />
three-year reform process for the waterfront that promises<br />
major labour productivity gains.<br />
Quite simply this is the most comprehensive program of<br />
reform ever undertaken on the waterfront; it will usher in<br />
an entirely new era of efficiency and growth for your vital<br />
industry; and in so doing it will ensure that Australia as a<br />
whole is a more productive and competitive force in the<br />
world economy. 1125 </p>
<p>4 The program concentrates on two key areas.<br />
The first, covering ataymdoring and container depot<br />
indartim, commenced with the establishment last year of<br />
the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority.<br />
This authoriLty is overseeing the implementation of the<br />
agreement, n., egotiated between the Government, ACTU, and key<br />
waterfront employers and unions, that will massively<br />
restructure employment arrangements.<br />
Enterprise employment at major ports will replace the<br />
existing industry-based system.<br />
The workforce will be rejuvenated with the offer of early<br />
retirement -to 3,000 older employees and recruitment of 1,000<br />
younger new entrants.<br />
Award restructuring will develop greater labour flexibility.<br />
Regional ports will become more efficient with new labour<br />
arrangementl3 aimed at phasing out cross-subsidisation of<br />
stevedoring labour costs.<br />
Most importantly, the process has now led to the achievement<br />
of the first enterprise agreement between a major employer<br />
and the Wate~ rside Workers Federation the historic National<br />
Terminals agreement.<br />
The second element of the reforn program involves Sñ AtaBnd<br />
Tprrññ nz Grnments in reform of Port Authorities.<br />
The Governments of the six States and the Northern Territory<br />
have given their full support to the Inter-State<br />
Commission'a recommendations that affect them.<br />
Operations of port authorities are being commercialised and<br />
pricing practices are being reformed. The Australian<br />
Transport Advisory Council has a continuing role in review<br />
of the progress being made.<br />
There is a long way to go, but we already have some runs on<br />
the board. The Autralian Wheat Board estimates that new<br />
stevedoring arrangements for bulk grain will save S2.7<br />
million a year.<br />
Gangway watchmen reforms will save about $ 30 million<br />
per year.<br />
The initial intake of 213 new employees has completed<br />
training and is at work.<br />
34 26 </p>
<p>, I I 6.<br />
Its a pity that Bob Collins is unable to be here today. AS<br />
Minister for Shipping he has been tireless in helping bring<br />
about these changes. Many of you will have met him and so<br />
you will know his determination, through consultation and<br />
first hand understanding of the industry, to achieve<br />
significant and sustainable reform in this key industry.<br />
But I want to take this opportunity to underline how much<br />
he, and the Government as a whole, appreciate and respect<br />
the way in which the trade union movement and this<br />
Federaticn in particular have supported these reforms.<br />
Without your active support, of course, no progress could<br />
have been. achieved. That would have been a tragedy for the<br />
Australian economy as a whole and it would have been a<br />
betrayal of the best interests of your members.<br />
But with your support, we have achieved gains which benefit<br />
your memkers and all Australians.<br />
You have played a vital role in developing an interim award<br />
agreement: that will facilitate award restructuring and the<br />
negotiation of enterprise agreements.<br />
With your pending amalgamation with the Australian Foreman<br />
Stevedores Association and the Seamenp' Union of Australia,<br />
you will be taking a giant stride towards more effective<br />
protection of your members' interests and more speedy<br />
negotiation with employers.<br />
And all of this take careful note, all those who suggest<br />
that confrontationist industrial relations might be a<br />
preferabl e course has been achieved without industrial<br />
disputation. It has indeed been the very model of how negotiated reforms<br />
can achieve lasting benefits to all parties.<br />
The publication of " Ship to Shore" broadly coincides with<br />
the first centenary of the Federation's existence at the<br />
port of Melbourne. As a result of your support for these<br />
reforms, you have made sure that waterfront unionism will<br />
continue to be a strong and relevant factor in Australia's<br />
ports well into your second century. ' 3427 </p>
