SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
REGIONAL TELEVISION AUSTRALIA SYDNEY, 5, JUNE 1984<br />
DISTINGUISHED GUESTS, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN<br />
THANK YOU FOR YOUR KIND WELCOME. I PARTICULARLY APPRECIATE<br />
THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO YOU TONIGHT.<br />
JUST OVER TWO MONTHS AGO I HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF PRESENTING<br />
THE GOLD LOGIE BEFORE AN AUDIENCE OF TELEVISION PEOPLE FROM<br />
THE CREATIVE SECTOR OF THE INDUSTRYTHIS<br />
EVENING I AM VERY PLEASED TO BE ABLE TO SPEAK TO AN<br />
AUDIENCE WHICH REPRESENTS A MAJOR SEGMENT OF THE MANAGEMENT<br />
OF THE TELEVISION INDUSTRY.<br />
AT THE LOGIES I DREW1' ATTENTION TO THE CONSIDERABLE ADVANCES<br />
THAT HAVE BEEN MADE IN VCENT YEARS IN AUSTRALIAN<br />
PROGRAMMING. IT IS VERY ENCOURAGING TO KNOW THAT OF THE<br />
MORE THAN $ 300 MILLION COMMERCIAL TELEVISION SPENT ON<br />
PROGRAMMING IN 1981/ 82 THAT NEARLY 80 PER CENT WAS DIRECTED<br />
To AUSTRALIAN PRODUCTIONS. WE CAN ALL DRAW SOME<br />
SATISFACTION FROM THE FACT THAT LAST FINANCIAL YEAR MORE<br />
THAN 50 PER CENT OF THE PRIME TIME PROGRAMS WERE AUSTRALIAN<br />
MADE. PERHAPS EVEN MORE EXCITING IS THAT OVERSEAS SALES OF<br />
AUSTRALIAN PROGRAMS ARE GROWING STEADILY AS FOREIGN BUYERS<br />
COME TO RECOGNISE THE QUALITY OF OUR LOCAL PRODUCTREGIONAL<br />
TELEVISION AUSTRALIA HAS BEEN INVOLVED IN THIS<br />
WELCOME DEVELOPMENT OF OUR LOCAL PRODUCTION'CAPACITIES AND<br />
TALENT AND I AM AWARE OF ONE OF YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS THROUGH<br />
THE DOCUMENTARY SERIES THE PRIME-MINISTERS FOR WHICH YOU<br />
ALSO DESERVE RECOGNITIONTO<br />
DESCRIBE TELEVISION AS OUR MOST POWERFUL MEDIUM HAS<br />
BECOME SOMETHING OF A CLICHEBUT<br />
THAT SHOULD NOT OBSCURE THE FUNDAMENTAL TRUTH OF THIS<br />
OBSERVATIONCHECK AGAINST DELIVERY </p>
<p>I HAVE BEEN FORTUNATE THAT MY PERIOD OF PUBLIC LIFE HAS<br />
COINCIDED WITH THE GROWTH IN INFLUENCE OF YOUR MEDIUM.<br />
TELEVISION OFFERS ALL OF US WHO HAVE INFORMATION OR VIEWS WE<br />
WISH TO PRESENT TO THE PUBLIC A UNIQUE VEHICLE THROUGH WHICH<br />
TO COMMUNICATE OUR CASE.<br />
I RECOGNISE THAT IN THE REGIONAL CITIES AND IN PROVINCIAL<br />
AUSTRALIA YOU PLAY A SPECIAL ROLE IN DISSEMINATING<br />
INTERNATIONAL, NATIONAL AND LOCAL NEWS AND COMMENT. IT IS A<br />
ROLE THAT CARRIES WITH IT A GREAT RESPONSIBILITY WHICHI<br />
KNOW YOU ACCEPT IN YOUR APPROACH TO THIS TASKI<br />
NOTED WITH INTEREST THAT YOU PRESENT THE SPECIAL AUDIENCE<br />
THAT REGIONAL TELEVISION CAPTURES AS THE ' FRESH<br />
AUSTRALIANS' THE AUSTRALIAN LABOR PARTY BOTH BEFORE AND SINCE WINNING<br />
OFFICE HAS MADE A SPECIAL EFFORT TO COMMUNICATE ITS POLICIES<br />
TO THE PEOPLE LIVING OUTSIDE THE MAJOR METROPOLITAN CITIES.<br />
THE GOVERNMENT HAS ALSO, AND I BELIEVE THIS IS REFLECTED IN<br />
THE FACT THAT I HAVE VISITED MORE THAN 20 REGIONAL CENTRES<br />
IN THE LAST 15 MONTHS, ENSURED THAT IT HAS BEEN ACCESSIBLE<br />
AND RESPONSIVE TO THOSE OF YOU LIVING IN NON-METROPOLITAN<br />
AUSTRALIAIN MY OWN EXPERIENCE I HAVE BEEN IMPRESSED NOT JUST WITH THE<br />
COMMITMENT OF REGIONAL TELEVISION STATIONS TO REPORT ON<br />
POLITICAL AND SOCIAL ISSUES BUT ALSO WITH THE QUALITY OF<br />
YOUR COVERAGE OF THESE ISSUES. I K( NOW THAT MANY STATIONS<br />
PROVIDE EQUALLY HIGHgQUALITY CURRENT AFFAIRS, CHILDRENS'I,<br />
VARIETY, COMMUNITY INTEREST AND LOCAL SPORT PROGRAMS. A<br />
FURTHER MEASURE OF YOUR ItOMMITMENT IN THIS AREA IS THE<br />
APPOINTMENT OF A REGIONAL TELEVISION AUSTRALIA JOURNALIST IN<br />
THE PARLIAMENTARY PRESS GALLERY-TO MONITOR AND TO REPORT ON<br />
ISSUES OF SPECIAL INTEREST TO YOUR VIEWERS.<br />
BEFORE DISCUSSING SOME OF THE SPECIFIC INDUSTRY ISSUES YOU<br />
HAVE INDICATED THAT YOU WOULD LIKE ME TO ADDRESS, I AM SURE<br />
YOU WOULD LIKE TO HEAR BRIEFLY THE GOVERNMENT'S VIEW OF THE<br />
MEDIUM TERM PROSPECTS FOR THE ECONOMY.<br />
YOU ARE ALL AWARE OF THE PRIORITY THE GOVERNMENT HAS<br />
ATTACHED TO A SUSTAINED, LONG-TERM ECONOMIC GROWTH AND THE<br />
CONSEQUENT IMPROVEMENT IN LIVING STANDARDS FOR OUR<br />
COMMUNITY. YOU HAVE SEEN AT FIRST HAND THE REVITALIZATION OF THE RURAL<br />
ECONOMY WITH THE BREAKING OF THE DROUGHT.-WON'T CLAIM<br />
FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS!<br />
OTHER FACTORS HAVE ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE IMPROVED<br />
PERFORMANCE OF THE NON-FARM ECONOMY. BUT THE GOVERNMENT'S<br />
POLICIES, AND PARTICULARLY THE CONTINUED SUCCESSFUL<br />
OPERATION OF THE PRICES AND INCOMES ACCORD, HAVE ALSO HAD A<br />
SIGNIFICANT IMPACT IN RECENT MONTHS ON GROWTH, EMPOLOYMENT </p>
<p>AND UNEMPLOYMENT, INFLATION, THE GENERAL LEVELS OF CORPORATE<br />
PROFITABILITY AND PROSPECTIVE LOWER WAGE COSTS. THERE ARE<br />
ALSO SOME ENCOURAGING SIGNS OF A PICK-UP [ N BUSINESS<br />
INVESTMENT. IN THE FORTHCOMING BUDGET WE WILL BE BRINGING IN A LOWER<br />
DEFICIT THAN FOR THE CURRENT FINANCIAL YEAR, THUS FURTHER<br />
REDUCING PRESSURES ON THE FINANCIAL MARKETSTHE<br />
UNDERLYING STRENGTH OF THE RECOVERY IS REFLECTED IN THE<br />
LATEST NATIONAL ACCOUNTS STATISTICS RELEASED TODAY:<br />
NON-FARM PRODUCT IN THE MARCH 1984 QUARTER GREW BY<br />
2.4% A REMARKABLE 7.6% ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE<br />
JUNE QUARTER 1983 ( THE TROUGH OF THE RECESSION).<br />
FARM PRODUCT FOR THE MARCH 1984 QUARTER WAS<br />
HIGHER THAN IN THE SAME QUARTER LAST YEAR.<br />
ACTIVITY IN THE HOUSING SECTOR CONTINUED TO BE VERY<br />
STRONG, REGISTERING A 12% GROWTH IN THE QUARTER.<br />
EXPORTS ALSO GREW IMPRESSIVELY By 4% IN THE<br />
QUARTER PARTLY A REFLECTION OF STRONG GROWTH IN<br />
RURAL EXPORTS.<br />
THERE WAS ALSO DURING THE MARCH QUARTER CONTINUED<br />
GROWTH IN PRIVATE CONSUMPTION EXPENDITURE ( 0.7%<br />
AFTER ALLOWING FOR THE ME'DICARE EFFECT) AND STRONG<br />
GROTH N PJVATE FXDINVESTMENT ( NEARLY<br />
FINALLY, NON-FA4 PROFIT SHARE ROSE BY A FURTHER 1%<br />
IN THE QUARTER TO 17.1% RECONFIRMING A RETURN TO<br />
THE LEVELS OF THE EARLY 1970' s.<br />
IT IS CLEAR THAT RECOVERY IS OBVIOUSLY WELL AND TRULY<br />
UNDERWAY. THE GOVERNMENT ATTACHES THE HIGHEST PRIORITY TO<br />
SUSTAINING AND CARRYING FORWARD INTO THE LONG-TERM FUTURE<br />
THE VERY GOOD ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE OF RECENT MONTHSI<br />
WOULD NOW LIKE TO TURN TO SOME ISSUES OF PARTICULAR<br />
CONCERN TO YOUR INDUSTRY.<br />
AT PRESENT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF ISSUES WHICH HAVE OR WILL<br />
HAVE A MAJOR BEARING ON THE FUTURE OF STATIONS OPERATING IN<br />
THE REGIONAL NETWORK. THESE INCLUDE THE MATTERS OF<br />
SATELLITE POLICIES, SUPPLEMENTARY LICENCING, AND THE MORE<br />
GENERAL ISSUE OF REGULATION IN THE INDUSTRY.<br />
THE CONSEQUENCES OF POSITIONS ADOPTED BY THE GOVERNMENT ON<br />
THESE MATTERS ARE VITAL TO THE COMMUNITY. BECAUSE OF THIS I<br />
THINK IT MAY BE HELPFUL AT THIS STAGE FOR ME TO GIVE A<br />
GENERAL INDICATION OF SOME OF THE ASSUMPTIONS THE GOVERNMENT<br />
BRINGS TO THE ISSUES INVOLVED-</p>
<p>GOVERNMENT POLICIES FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF TELEVISION AND<br />
RADIO SERVICES ARE BASED UPON SEVERAL PRINCIPLES WHICH ARE<br />
DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT THE AUSTRALIAN COMMUNITY GAINS<br />
MAXIMUM BENEFIT FROM NEW AND EXISTING TECHNOLOGY. THERE IS<br />
A NUMBER OF PARTICULAR PRINCIPLES GUIDING THE GOVERNMENT'S<br />
APPROACH IN THIS AREA:<br />
TO MAXIMISE DIVERSITY OF CHOICE IN RADIO AND<br />
TELEVISION SERVICES, SO THAT ALL AUSTRAIANS HAVE<br />
ACCESS TO AS WIDE A RANGE OF SERVICES AS POSSIBLE;<br />
TO ENCOURAGE AN ' AUSTRALIAN LOOK' FOR T. V. AND<br />
RADIO, BY MAINTENANCE OF AN APPROPRIATE AUSTRALIAN<br />
CONTENT, AND FOSTERING OF AN AUSTRALIAN PRODUCTION<br />
INDUSTRY;<br />
TO DISCOURAGE CONCENTRATION OF MEDIA OWNERSHIP AND<br />
CONTROL OF STATIONS; AND<br />
TO MAINTAIN THE VIABILITY OF THE BROADCASTING<br />
SYSTEM.<br />
CONSISTENT WITH THESE PRINCIPLES, THE GOVERNMENT HAS A<br />
NUMBER OF IMPORTANT OBJECTIVES:<br />
TO BRING A SIMILAR RANGE OF ENTERTAINMENT AND<br />
INFORMATION THROUGH THE BROADCASTING SERVICES TO<br />
ALL AUSTRALIANS ESPECIALLY THOSE CURRENTLY<br />
WITHOUT ANY OR WITH INADEQUATE SERVICES;<br />
TO PROVIDE AROADCASTING SERVICES RELEVANT AND<br />
RESPONSIVE TO LPCAL NEEDS;<br />
TO DEVELOP SERVICES BASED ON SOCIAL NEEDS RATHER<br />
THAN SIMPLY UNCRITICALLY FOLLOWING THE DICTATES OF<br />
NEW TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT; AND<br />
IT IS WITH THESE PRINCIPLES AND OBJECTIVES IN MIND, COMBINED<br />
WITH A FLEXIBLE CONSENSUS APPROACH TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF<br />
DECISIONS, THAT WE HAVE SHAPED OUR POLICIES IN THE<br />
COMMUNICATIONS FIELD.<br />
THE ' INTRODUCTION OF SATELLITES WILL CLEARLY HAVE A PROFOUND<br />
EFFECT ON THE BROADCASTING SYSTEM. FOR A COUNTRY AS LARGE<br />
AND AS SPARSELY SETTLED As AUSTRALIA, THE BENEFITS OF<br />
SATELLITE COMMUNICATIONS ARE OBVIOUSTHIS<br />
DOES NOT MEAN, HOWEVER AS YOU WOULD ALL KNOW THAT<br />
THE DECISION TO INTRODUCE AUSSAT WAS A STRAIGHTFORWARD, OPEN<br />
AND SHUT CASE. THE SIMPLE EXISTENCE OF THE TECHNOLOGY WAS<br />
NOT SUFFICIENT TO JUSTIFY ITS USE. THE GOVERNMENT WAS<br />
KEENLY SENSITIVE TO THE NEED TO ENSURE THAT THE INTRODUCTION<br />
OF AUSSAT WOULD NEED TO HAVE FULL REGARD FOR THE EXISTING<br />
STRUCTURE OF BROADCASTING IN THIS COUNTRY. FOR THE DECISION </p>
<p>TO PROCEED THE GOVERNMENT ALSO FELT THAT ITS USE WOULD ALSO<br />
HAVE TO TAKE ACCOUNT OF COMMUNITY REQUIREMENTS AND BE<br />
ECONOMICALLY SOUND.<br />
THE SATELLITE PROGRAM SERVICES INQUIRY FLOWS DIRECTLY FROM<br />
THIS DECISION. IT IS A CLEAR EXAMPLE OF THE GOVERNMENT'S<br />
CONCERN THAT THE VIEWS OF ALL SECTORS, AND ESPECIALLY THE<br />
REMOTE COMMUNITIES, SHOULD BE PAID SPECIAL HEED IN THE<br />
DEVELOPMENT OF THESE SYSTEMSTHIS<br />
INQUIRY BY THE AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING TRIBUNAL HAS<br />
BEEN LOOKING AT TWO BROAD SETS OF ISSUES, WHICH I KNOW ARE<br />
OF PARTICULAR INTEREST TO YOUR MEMBERSHIP:<br />
FIRST,, WHETHER THERE SHOULD BE ANY REGULATION<br />
GOVERNING THE PROVISION OF SATELLITE PROGRAM<br />
SERVICES; AND<br />
SECOND, WHAT SHOULD BE DONE TO ENSURE THAT<br />
COMMERCIAL TELEVISION IS PROVIDED TO THOSE 650,000<br />
PEOPLE THROUGHOUT AUSTRALIA WHO DO NOT HAVE A<br />
SERVICE.<br />
A CLOSELY RELATED MATTER IS THAT OF DIRECT BROADCASTINGTHIS<br />
RAISES ISSUES WHICH NEED TO BE HANDLED WITH PARTICULAR<br />
CARE. I THINK YOU WOULD ALL RECOGNISE THAT HOUSEHOLDS OUTSIDE THE<br />
RANGE OF REGIONAL C* 4MERCIAL TELEVISION ARE ANXIOUS TO<br />
RECEIVE NOT JUST THE BUT A WIDE RANGE OF COMMERCIAL<br />
SERVICES. FOR THEM DIRACT BROADCASTING WOULD PROVIDE THE<br />
TYPES OF SERVICES THAT VIEWERS IN METROPOLITAN CITIES AND<br />
REGIONAL CENTRES ALREADY TAKE FOR GRANTED. ON THE OTHER<br />
HAND, I FULLY APPRECIATE YOUR CONCERN THAT UNLIMITED DIRECT<br />
BRAODCASTING TO ALL PARTS OF AUSTRALIA WOULD HAVE A SERIOUS<br />
IMPACT ON THE VIABILITY OF REGIONAL, STATIONS AND<br />
CONSEQUENTLY ON LOCAL TELEVISION PROGRAMINGIT<br />
WAS THIS LATTER CONSIDERATION THAT PROMPTED THE MINISTER<br />
FOR COMMUNICATIONS TO ANNOUNCE LATE LAST YEAR THAT THE<br />
GOVERNMENT WOULD NOT AUTHORISE COMMERCIAL DIRECT<br />
BROADCASTING BY SATELLITE AT THAT TIME.<br />
IN THE FINAL ANALYSIS, HOWEVER, THE GOVERNME-NT WILL HAVE TO<br />
BRING A FLEXIBLE, PRAGMATIC APPROACH TO THIS ISSUE AN<br />
APPROACH WHICH ADEQUATELY ADDRESSES THE NEEDS OF THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN COMMUNITY AT LARGE. THE CURRENT POSITION ON<br />
DIRECT BROADCASTING SHOULD NOT THEREFORE BE SEEN AS EITHER<br />
IRREVOCABLE OR INDEFINITE IN DURATION-ULTIMATELY WE ARE<br />
GOING TO HAVE TO FIND A MEANS OF ADDRESSING THE NEEDS OF<br />
THOSE 650,000 AUSTRALIANS WITHOUT ACCESS TO COMMERCIAL<br />
SERVICES. THE SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM MUST INITIALLY AWAIT<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING TRIBUNAL's REPORT.<br />
I .1 </p>
<p>OUR NON-METROPOLITAN COMMUNITIES ARE THE RICHER AND BETTER<br />
FOR THE CONTRIBUTION MADE BY OUR REGIONAL TELEVISION<br />
STATIONS.<br />
THE GOVERNMENT'S APPROACH IS, THEREFORE, ONE WHICH SEEKS TO<br />
PRESERVE THE BENEFITS OF LOCAL CONTENT OF PROGRAMMING IN<br />
REGIONAL AREAS, WHILE AT THE SAME TIME ALLOWING FOR BETTER<br />
DISTRIBUTION OF TELEVISION PROGRAMS THROUGHOUT AUSTRALIA.<br />
BECAUSE OF THE IMPORTANCE OF THE CONCEPT OF LOCALISM, THE<br />
GOVERNMENT, THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF COMMUNICATIONS,<br />
RECENTLY ESTABLISHED A REVIEW OF LOCALISM IN BROADCASTING<br />
UNDER THE CHAIRMANSHIP OF MR JAMES OSWIN. I KNOW THAT THERE<br />
IS SOME WARINESS WITHIN REGIONAL TELEVISON AUSTRALIA THAT<br />
THIS REVIEW MAY IN SOME WAYS WORK AGAINST THE INTERESTS OF<br />
REGIONAL BROADCASTING. I WOULD SIMPLY REITERATE THAT THE<br />
GOVERNMENT'S OBJECTIVE IS TO PROVIDE BROADCASTING SERVICES<br />
RELEVANT TO LOCAL NEEDS.<br />
THE GOVERNMENT IS STRONGLY OF THE VIEW THAT PEOPLE LIVING IN<br />
REGIONAL AREAS SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO A SIGNIFICANT DEGREE OF<br />
LOCAL CONTENT TELEVISION. IT IS, NONETHELESS, AN<br />
INESCAPABLE FACT THAT THE ECONOMICS OF TELEVISION PRODUCTION<br />
HAS BEEN THE GREATEST FACTOR AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE IN<br />
LIMITING THE DEGREE OF LOCAL PROGRAMING BY REGIONAL<br />
TELEVISION STATIONS.<br />
SOME LOCAL PRODUCTIONS HAVE REFLECTED GREAT FLAIR AND<br />
INITIATIVE, AND ARE A REAL CREDIT TO THOSE RESPONSIBLEBUT<br />
I DOUBT THAT ANY, 4WF YOU WOULD ARGUE THAT REGIONAL<br />
PROGRAMING HAS ACHIEVED THE LEVEL OF LOCAL SERVICE WHICH THE<br />
PARLIAMENT ANTICIPATED WA-~ N COMMERCIAL TELEVISION WAS FIRST<br />
INTRODUCED IN REGIONAL AUSTRALIA NEARLY TWENTY-FIVE YEARS<br />
AGO. THIS FACT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED OPENLY AND FRANKLY BY<br />
ALL CONCERNEDANOTHER IMPORTANT SATELLITE RELATED ISSUE IS THAT OF<br />
SUPPLEMENTARY LICENCES. THE SUPPLEMENTARY LICENCE SCHEME IS<br />
ANOTHER COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT DESIGNED TO BRING ABOUT<br />
A GREATER DIVERSITY OF CHOICE FOR VIEWERS IN REGIONAL AREAS.<br />
THE AIM WILL BE TO ENSURE THAT THIS BE DONE WITHOUT<br />
AFFECTING THE VIABILITY OF CURRENT OPERATORSIAM<br />
AWARE THAT THERE IS A VIEW WITHIN THE INDUSTRY THAT THE<br />
SUPPLEMENTARY LICENCE PROCEDURE SHOULD BE SIMPLIFIED AND<br />
SPEEDED UP. I SHOULD LIKE YOU TO KNOW THAT THE MINISTER FOR<br />
COMMUNICATIONS, MR DlUFFY VERY RECENTLY UNDERTOOK A REVIEW OF<br />
THE PROCESS TO SEE WHETHER THERE WERE ANY STEPS WHICH COULD<br />
BE TAKEN TO SPEED UP THE PROCESS. HE WAS CONVINCED THERE<br />
WERE NO PRACTICAL AND LAWFUL ALTERNATIVES, SHORT OF MAJOR<br />
LEGISLATIVE CHANGESQUITE<br />
CLOSELY LINKED TO THE MATTER OF SUPPLEMENTARY LICENCES<br />
IS THE MATTER OF DEFINING SERVICE AREAS-I AM PLEASED TO </p>
<p>SAY THAT THIS IS GOING AHEAD SMOOTHLY, THANKS IN PART TO THE<br />
CO-OPERATION OF REGIONAL TELEVISION AUSTRALIA MEMBERS AND<br />
OTHERS. THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE GIVING PRIORITY TO THOSE<br />
AREAS WHICH HAVE BEEN SINGLED OUT AS BEING OF PARTICULAR<br />
INTEREST BY APPLICANTS FOR A SUPPLEMENTARY LICENCEFINALLY<br />
THERE IS THE ISSUE OF REGULATION, AND I RECOGNISE<br />
THAT THIS IS A MATTER OF CONTINUING SENSITIVITY WITHIN YOUR<br />
INDUSTRY. LET ME ASSURE YOU THE GOVERNMENT HAS NO<br />
COMMITMENT TO REGULATION FOR THE SAKE OF REGULATION-OUR<br />
DISTINCT PREFERENCE WOULD BE FOR CO-OPERATIVE APPROACHES<br />
WHICH PAY DUE REGARD TO CLEAR, ALBEIT EVOLVING, COMMUNITY<br />
ATTITUDES AND EXPECTATIONS.<br />
IN THIS REGARD I AM DELIGHTED BY THE CO-OPERATION THAT IS<br />
TAKING PLACE BETWEEN THE COMMERCIAL NETWORK CHANNEL 10 AND<br />
THE A. B. C. OVER TELEVISION COVERAGE OF THE OLYMPIC GAMES.<br />
THIS IS NOT ONLY A REFRESHING DEVELOPMENT AND ONE THAT I<br />
WOULD HOPE WOULD BE THE NORM FROM NOW ON, BUT IT ALSO IT<br />
REPRESENTS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF WHAT IT NEEDED IF BROADRANGING<br />
COMMUNITY INTERESTS ARE TO BE ADEQUATELY AND EFFECTIVELY<br />
PROVIDED FOR.<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING TRIBUNAL HAS JUST RELEASED NEW<br />
CHILDREN IS AND PRE-SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN IS TELEVISION PROGRAM<br />
AND ADVERTISING STANDARDS. REVISED STANDARDS TO BE<br />
DETERMINED DURING THE NEXT 12 MONTHS WILL INCLUDE<br />
ADVERTISING TIME STANDARDS, RELIGIOUS PROGRAM STANDARDS,<br />
AUSTRALIAN CONTENT STANDARDS AND PROGRAM CLASSIFICATION<br />
STANDARDS. WHAT IS IMPORTANT IS THAI INDUSTRY AND COMMUNITY BODIES BE<br />
CLOSELY CONSULTED IN THESE MATTERS. THIS IS PROVIDED FOR BY<br />
WELL ESTABLISHED PROCEDURESIT<br />
REMAINS THE GOVERNMENT's PREFERENCE NONETHELESS, THAT THE<br />
INDUSTRY CONTINUE TO REGULATE ITSELF AS IT HAS DONE THROUGH<br />
A NUMBER OF BODIES SUCH As FACTS, THE MEDIA COUNCIL, THE<br />
ADVERTISING STANDARDS COUNCIL AND THE ADVERTISING INDUSTRY<br />
COUNCIL OF AUSTRALIA. IN MOST CASES SELF-REGULATION OF THIS<br />
KIND HAS BEEN SUFFICIENT AND ACCEPTABLE TO ALL PARTIES.<br />
THERE IS NO INTRINSIC REASON WHY CO-OPERATIVE APPROACHES OF<br />
THIS KIND SHOULD NOT PREVAIL-IN THE DUAL SYSTEM OF<br />
GOVERNMENTAL OVERSIGHT AND INDUSTRY SELF-REGULATION WHICH<br />
NOW APPLIES, THE DECISIONS WHICH EMERGE SEEM GENERALLY<br />
WORKABLE AND WELL BALANCED.<br />
THE COMMUNICATIONS ENVIRONMENT IS CHANGING RAPIDLY. THE<br />
TASK BEFORE ALL OF US IS TO MANAGE THAT CHANGE IN A WAY THAT<br />
ACCOMMODATES THE VARIOUS INTERESTS CONCERNED AND MOST<br />
IMPORTANTLY, PROVIDES THE SERVICES NEEDED BY THE COMMUNITY<br />
AT LARGE-</p>
<p>DECISIONS THAT HAVE TO BE TAKEN WILL INEVITABLY CAUSE SOME<br />
PARTIES TO BE LESS THAN TOTALLY SATISFIED. BUT IN THE<br />
LONG-TERM I BELIEVE THAT THE AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING SYSTEM<br />
AS A WHOLE BENEFITS FORM THE STABILITY OF APPROACH ADOPTED<br />
BY THIS GOVERNMENT.<br />
WE RELY ON THE ASSISTANCE OF ORGANISATIONS SUCH AS YOUR OWN<br />
AND I TRUST THAT THE CO-OPERATIVE SPIRIT YOU HAVE SHOWN WILL<br />
CONTINUE AS, TOGETHER, WE STRIVE TO PROVIDE THE BEST<br />
POSSIBLE BROADCASTING SYSTEM FOR ALL AUSTRALIANS. </p>
