FOR MEDIA 20 APRIL 1989<br />
I have today launched Australia's first National Women's Health Policy at Westmead<br />
Hospital, Sydney.<br />
Based on the views of more than one million women around Australia, the policy<br />
provides a blueprint for improving the health and well-being of Australian women<br />
into the twenty-first century.<br />
The seven major issues identified by Australian women during one of the widest<br />
consultative processes undertaken in this country are reproductive health and<br />
sexuality; the health of ageing women; women's emotional and mental health;<br />
violence against women; occupational health and safety; the health needs of women<br />
as carers; and the health effects of sex role stereotyping.<br />
It is proposed that a National Women's Health Program cost-shared with the States<br />
will address these concerns through five key action areas<br />
improvement in health services for women;<br />
provision of health information for women;<br />
research and collection of data on women's health;<br />
training of health care providers; and<br />
women's participation in decision-making on health.<br />
The policy recognises the special needs of women who may be disadvantaged through<br />
age, low income, urban or rural isolation, by having a disability, or because they<br />
are from non-English speaking backgrounds.<br />
All of its recommendations aim to provide affordable, accessible, appropriate and<br />
acceptable health services for women.<br />
My Government is committed to the policy and working towards its full<br />
implementation in conjunction with the States. State Health Ministers gave their<br />
in-principle endorsement to it last month.<br />
This bipartisan approach acknowledges that -implementation of policies and programs<br />
designed to improve women's health, well-being and life opportunities must be one<br />
of Australia's major goals in the closing years of the twentieth century.<br />
The National Women's Health Policy is a major component of the National Agenda for<br />
Women, my Government's blueprint for improving the status of Australian women<br />
towards the year 2000.<br />
The release of this policy complements, from a health perspective, the measures<br />
announced in the tax package last week, of which many Australian women will be<br />
major beneficiaries.<br />
The policy has been developed over the past three years, coordinated by the<br />
Department of Community Services and Health, and with the assistance of a special<br />
consultant to the Minister, Ms Liza Newby. </p>
