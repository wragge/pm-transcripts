    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER</strong>:<br />
On behalf of the Government, the warmest congratulations on your elevation or your re-elevation to the great Office of Speaker of the House of Representatives.</p>
<p>You have conducted this vitally important office with elegance, intellect, dignity, charm, impartiality.</p>
<p>This is a very robust chamber, as we all know. Sometimes in Question Time even people that are naturally very reasonable will become unreasonable and intemperate.</p>
<p>But you Sir, have risen above that and you project a calm that reflects so well on our House and so well on our democracy.</p>
<p>You have demonstrated that as Speaker in the last Parliament and it is a great achievement that you have done that because all of us understand that we come into politics as advocates, making a strong case for our principles, for our constituents, being prepared to take on arguments with force and sometimes with ferocity.</p>
<p>To translate from that role to one of calm, equanimity, impartiality, nonetheless authority is a really profound transition.</p>
<p>You have achieved that, Mr Speaker, you have reflected so well on our democracy, so well on our house and we - from the Government, are so delighted that you have once again consented to be the Speaker of the House of Representatives, congratulations.</p>
<p>To Pam and your family, without whose support we know you wouldn't be able to perform your high office.</p>
<p><strong>ALL:</strong></p>
<p>Hear, hear!</p>
<p><strong>[ENDS]</strong></p>
