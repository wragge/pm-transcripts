INTERVIEWER Barrie Cassidy:<br />
Hello and thanks for joining us on this special edition of<br />
Meet the Press coming to you from the cabinet suite<br />
inside Parliament House in Canberra where our guest is,<br />
of course, the Prime Minister, Paul Keating.<br />
Good morning and thanks for joining us.<br />
Paul Keating:<br />
Barrie Cassidy:<br />
Paul Keating: Good Barrie.<br />
We'll talk about the APEC agreement very shortly but<br />
first, on wages: should Australians be bracing<br />
themselves for a period of industrial disputation in the<br />
leading up to Christmas?<br />
I don't think so except, you must know and I think most<br />
Australians know, we've changed from the centralised<br />
wage fixing system. We've now got the sort of system<br />
that I think most people in public life have believed we<br />
should have had for a long time. That is a broadly<br />
decentralised system which is industry for industry, plant<br />
Agency Report. For private research and niot to be di~ ssemninated. Every effort made to ensure accracy<br />
for the benefit ofour clients but no legal or other responsibility is taken for erros or omissions. I </p>
<p>Barrie Cassidy:<br />
Paul Keating:<br />
Barrie Cassidy:<br />
Paul Keating:<br />
Barrie Cassidy: for plant. And because people are making agreements<br />
which go for a year or a couple of years or three years,<br />
it's likely that there will be some disputes but that's the<br />
nature of the system.<br />
And does that mean that disputes will be enterprise to<br />
enterprise, that we shouldn't expect to see a blanket<br />
strike a national strike by the Transport Workers<br />
Union, for example?<br />
I don't think so. But, again, if they are bargaining for<br />
what they see as a sort of industry-wide adjustment of<br />
some kind, some segments of that industry could be<br />
subject to disputation.<br />
They are certainly talking tough aren't they? Steve<br />
Hutchins, the President of the TWU, said, for example,<br />
that he'll roll right over the top of you if you get in his<br />
way when he's going for these wage claims.<br />
But he's running for election, Barrie, you see. They've<br />
also got an election on so you get this sort of talk in<br />
union journals when the campaigns are on. You get it in<br />
national election campaigns, indeed.<br />
Well what about the merits of the claim? They are going<br />
for 15 per cent 71/ z per cent a year. How much of that<br />
do you think could be made up of both productivity and<br />
profiteering? </p>
<p>Paul Keating:<br />
Barrie Cassidy:<br />
Paul Keating:<br />
Barrie Cassidy:<br />
Paul Keating: There is an assumption, I think, in a lot of the<br />
commentary about these claims that what is claimed will<br />
be given. But, remember, this is not the centralised<br />
system where largely what was claimed came from it. A<br />
claim is one thing but an agreement is another. So, in<br />
my view, 7/ 2 per cent a year is too high and<br />
It's an ambit claim.<br />
And I think employers will think that too.<br />
So what percentage? Is there a percentage that you can<br />
point to that accounts for productivity? Because some of<br />
this is retrospective of productivity, of course, in its-<br />
No, I can't disaggregate the claim and I'm not going to<br />
do the employers' work or their bidding for them. In<br />
this system the employers have got to, for the first time<br />
in decades, actually stand up and be counted. They've<br />
actually got to defend their own profits and seek to draw<br />
a productivity from the arrangements. In other words,<br />
this is a grown-up system. It's not a system where the<br />
government and the ACTU under the Accord through<br />
the centralised system fixes wages. The employers<br />
wanted us out of that system. We are now out of that<br />
system and the employers now have to manage the<br />
system and deal with claims and try and deal with them<br />
in a way that protects their profits and keeps the<br />
inflation rate low. </p>
<p>Barrie Cassidy:<br />
Paul Keating:<br />
Barrie Cassidy:<br />
Paul Keating: But then you, as a government, you have to take the rap<br />
if the claim is too generous if what they get in the end<br />
is too generous, and that feeds into inflation, and then in<br />
turn puts pressure on interest rates.<br />
The government doesn't take the rap because this is a<br />
system where it's all up to the participants. But, by the<br />
same token, we will keep our eye on the total outcomes<br />
and the portents for inflation and competitiveness and it<br />
is in that respect, and for that reason, that Ralph Willis<br />
made the remarks I think yesterday saying the<br />
government will look at fiscal and monetary policy in<br />
the context of wage settlements which we think are<br />
unreasonable. All right. While they're trying to sort this out and you<br />
are looking on from the sidelines, how much sympathy<br />
have you for the Transport Workers Union, for<br />
example, because they are among some of the lowest<br />
paid workers in Australia?<br />
Exactly. And there's going to be some pressure inside<br />
that union for adjustments. And I think the other thing<br />
that's worth bearing in mind: it's also true it's been<br />
some time since they've had an adjustment. So there is<br />
an element of catch-up here. But, again, it's a very<br />
competitive industry and a productive one and it's for<br />
the employers to draw the productivity from it. </p>
<p>Barrie Cassidy:<br />
Paul Keating:<br />
Barrie Cassidy:<br />
Barrie Cassidy:<br />
Paul Keating:<br />
Barrie Cassidy:<br />
Paul Keating: And for political reasons you don't want to see those<br />
wages kept down anyway because it just feeds this<br />
perception that the opposition is putting out that in<br />
Australia the poor are getting poorer.<br />
That's just patently untrue and this comes from the<br />
humbugs in the opposition who oppose every wage<br />
increase since 1983. All the years that I've been here as<br />
Prime Minister and as Treasurer, Barrie, in every<br />
national wage case, in every wage round, they opposed<br />
the lot.<br />
We have to take a break. We will be right back with<br />
Meet the Press. Stay with us.<br />
( Commercial break)<br />
We are back with Prime Minister, Paul Keating, here at<br />
Parliament House in Canberra. It does appear quite<br />
obviously interest rates will go over 10 per cent very<br />
shortly. Are these rates going to go up through next year<br />
and then the following year? When can we see an end to<br />
it? It depends what you call 10. We're<br />
The housing industry.<br />
The yardstick of the Government's what we call ' cash<br />
rate' you know, the Reserve Bank's cash rate? I think </p>
<p>Barrie Cassidy:<br />
Paul Keating:<br />
Barrie Cassidy:<br />
Paul Keating: the commentary to make here, Barrie, is that it would be<br />
most unlikely that in any recovery of strength you could<br />
keep the interest rates that you had while you were in<br />
recession and we've now adjusted the cash rate by 11/ 4<br />
percentage points, to about 6'/ 2 per cent. But, again, it's<br />
amongst the lowest cash rates in the last 20 years.<br />
Yes, sure, but can you say to the people of Australia<br />
that there will be end of this; that it won't go on all<br />
through next year; that we're looking at an<br />
There'll be no repeat of the eighties here. For a start<br />
That's in terms of the top limit of interest rates. But in<br />
terms of this constant rise that we expect every three<br />
months? Well, again, we'll see what happens in activity. We'll<br />
see what happens with the economy and activity. I mean<br />
we're already starting to see a slowing in housing<br />
lending, for instance, since the last rate rise. That's been<br />
reported fairly comprehensively by financial institutions.<br />
So, again, I think we'll look at activity and we'll look at<br />
wages. We'll look at the inflation outcomes. Remember<br />
this: that it was just a week or so ago that the inflation<br />
outcome for the last quarter came through and for the<br />
year it was 1.9 per cent. So we're still sort of keeping<br />
There's very strong productivity in here about 3 per<br />
cent productivity at the moment. So that's keeping the </p>
<p>Barrie Cassidy:<br />
Paul Keating:<br />
Barrie Cassidy:<br />
Paul Keating:<br />
Barrie Cassidy: inflation rate low and that lower inflation rate is the<br />
driver of interest rates and competitiveness.<br />
What is the optimum growth rate above which you<br />
cannot go without having to ratchet up interest rates<br />
again to bring it down?<br />
It depends how much capacity we can see installed and<br />
how efficiently we use it. I mean you can see some of<br />
the East Asian economies growing at six and seven per<br />
cent a year without inflation sort of jumping<br />
We go over 4 per cent and there's a problem, isn't<br />
there? That was because under 30 years of the Liberals our<br />
capital stock fell to pieces. I mean, I used to say to the<br />
Liberal Party in the last few years, ' You should hang<br />
your head in shame', in the late eighties; that as soon as<br />
the economy gets a burst on If it gets over about four<br />
to 4 1/ per cent it spills into imports. The reason for that<br />
is because we had such a poor over 20 or 30 years<br />
development of the capital stock. Now, that's changing.<br />
It's changing under Labor. It changed in the eighties<br />
with a big addition of investment, and it will change in<br />
the nineties.<br />
Now I'll come back at you and talk, of course, about the<br />
budget deficit. I think this coming budget in May next </p>
<p>year is going to be one of the most analysed in the<br />
country's history, certainly in advance of it. Are you<br />
warming to the view now that you need to do more on<br />
the budget deficit, you need to get it down at a sharper<br />
rate?<br />
Paul Keating:<br />
Barrie Cassidy: I think people should understand what's already been<br />
done to get it down in the future. That is, the decisions<br />
which It's as if we'd been through a little time warp<br />
here that people haven't noticed. You might remember<br />
John Dawkins' budget of last year and the difficulties we<br />
had getting that through the Senate the tax changes<br />
through the Senate. Well those policy changes are worth<br />
about $ 9 billion to the budget over the next two years.<br />
That's around two per cent of GDP. A lot of that hasn't<br />
happened yet. A lot of that is still coming through.<br />
Now, a lot of people who focus on the deficit put that<br />
straight in their pocket and say, ' All right, what's next?'<br />
What I say is ' Well, just remember what's coming.' It's<br />
not a matter of what's here. It's what's already been<br />
provided for because what was legislated were triggered<br />
That is tax changes which were triggered to come into<br />
effect on petrol, on wholesale sales tax, and other things<br />
over the next couple of years.<br />
Well, even allowing for that and the growth dividend, of<br />
course, there will still need to be tax increases and<br />
spending cuts, won't there? You won't be able to avoid<br />
either one of those? </p>
<p>Paul Keating:<br />
Barrie Cassidy:<br />
Barrie Cassidy:<br />
Paul Keating: As I often say in commentary about the budget, we'll do<br />
our usual housekeeping job on the outlays. Remember<br />
this, Barrie, that the outlays in Australia are as low as I<br />
think you could possibly have them in an OECD country<br />
and deliver the sort of services we have. Apart from the<br />
spending on the jobs compact, the 1992 One Nation<br />
spending has now all largely been unwound. So this is<br />
not as if there's been a spending spree here. The outlays<br />
are still largely as they were at their low point in the<br />
eighties largely at their low point in the eighties. This<br />
has been essentially a revenue problem. About $ 3 billion<br />
has gone to the business community in lower company<br />
tax and accelerated depreciation and in tariff cuts. And<br />
of course with the slower growth over the last few years<br />
we've had a smaller tax base. But that will improve.<br />
All right. We have to take another break. We'll be right<br />
back to talk about the historic APEC meeting in<br />
Indonesia. ( Commercial break)<br />
We are back with the Prime Minister, Paul Keating.<br />
You've said this APEC meeting last week was the most<br />
important thing that's happened to you as Prime<br />
Minister. Why should people at home share your<br />
enthusiasm? Simply because in the past, Barrie, we've never been<br />
part of a free trade area. Australia has simply been a </p>
<p>Barrie Cassidy:<br />
Paul Keating:<br />
Barrie Cassidy: sole trader. But as the world is getting a tougher place<br />
to live in, with the US signing preferential agreements<br />
with Canada and Mexico, under NAFTA; as Europe has<br />
its borders closed behind the European union, life's<br />
pretty tough out there. So getting Australia to become<br />
part of a free trade area is obviously a change that<br />
Australia has never enjoyed before.<br />
But are the benefits at home going to be fairly mixed?<br />
It's not going to be particularly good news for those<br />
who are working in highly protected industries, is it?<br />
I think it's going to be tremendous news for the whole<br />
country because what happens with a trade round is you<br />
get not just your own decision to reduce protection that<br />
is a unilateral decision you get a multilateral decision.<br />
So everyone is coming down at the same time. So you<br />
are comparing then apples with apples. The problem<br />
we've always had is when we've reduced protection<br />
other people haven't. If you look through the tariff and<br />
non-tariff barriers of East Asia, they're very high. So if<br />
we get them to come down we are going to open up<br />
enormous opportunities for Australians.<br />
How does that work when you are all coming down<br />
from different bases? Do you keep an eye on what the<br />
others are doing and act accordingly, or do you like to<br />
try and lead the region? </p>
<p>Paul Keating:<br />
Barrie Cassidy:<br />
Paul Keating:<br />
Barrie Cassidy:<br />
Paul Keating: That will be the basis of the negotiation which we will<br />
begin establishing processes for in Osaka in 1995.<br />
But you've signed onto a very big agreement here. You<br />
must have given some thought to how it works from<br />
now on.<br />
Absolutely. Because we're already Most of this is<br />
behind us. We will have an average level of trade<br />
weighted tariffs of 2.3 per cent by the year 2000. So for<br />
us the bulk of the work is behind us. It's the other<br />
countries. I mean we've opened Australia up. We've<br />
made it competitive. We've reduced tariffs. We've got a<br />
productivity culture and we've had a big throw to<br />
exports. What we had to do in public policy was get<br />
something in place to get the tariffs down around the<br />
Asia Pacific, and that's what APEC does.<br />
But, as you say, the heaviest responsibility is now with<br />
the other countries, not with Australia. You obviously<br />
have faith in the resolve of the present leaders but<br />
leaders come and go. Is there not a possibility that this<br />
will get a bit of a head of steam up and it just might run<br />
out of steam in two or three years?<br />
I don't think so because I think certainly East Asian<br />
leaders know that the countries with the lower tariffs<br />
grow faster and they do because the countries with the<br />
lower tariffs get more investment. Now, with South </p>
<p>Africa coming back into the world economy; China for<br />
the first time really in the world economy; South<br />
America, Russia, the Russian Far East, India there's<br />
going to be an enormous competition for capital and<br />
countries that keeps their tariffs up are not going to get<br />
capital. It's as simple as that. And that's why, for<br />
instance, in Malaysia last week we saw a reduction in<br />
tariff protection. In Indonesia three months ago, a<br />
unilateral reduction in tariff protection. So what we're<br />
doing here is saying, ' Listen, if we club in together and<br />
bring them down together, the political cost and the<br />
difficulties of economic restructuring will be much<br />
easier.'<br />
Barrie Cassidy:<br />
Paul Keating:<br />
Barrie Cassidy: You spent a lot of time with Bill Clinton this week.<br />
What do you think of him?<br />
I think he is what one would always hope an American<br />
president is, and that is a person into good works and<br />
deeds. I think Bill Clinton is a very conscientious<br />
person. He's not simply about sitting back watching the<br />
world go by. He's trying to address the policy issues<br />
that a lot of people either never had the courage to<br />
address or found great difficulty in addressing.<br />
And it's tougher for him in many ways, isn't it, because<br />
getting up the GATT round and APEC in the United<br />
States is a tougher shot for him than it is for you here in<br />
Australia. </p>
<p>Paul Keating:<br />
Barrie Cassidy:<br />
Paul Keating:<br />
Barrie Cassidy:<br />
Paul Keating: He has the difficulty of the Congress to deal with, but<br />
he's got NAFTA through. He's now got the GATT<br />
ratifications going through but he comes to the GATT<br />
ratifications with this APEC agreement in his pocket. In<br />
other words, what Bill Clinton can say, and* I think say<br />
with voracity, is that he's the one who has opened up<br />
the opportunity in Asia for the United States. That's got<br />
to be a bull point, I think, in getting the GATT round<br />
through the Congress.<br />
Why do you think he is so unpopular at home, then? It's<br />
not a personality problem. The country seems to think<br />
that he's failing them in terms of leadership.<br />
I think that probably he was a bit like I mean there's a<br />
moot point here. The Democrats blame him for their<br />
difficulties but I think probably he's entitled to blame<br />
them. I think it was like marrying into an unpopular<br />
family. He picked up all the dross of the Democratic<br />
Party and he's had it sort of round his neck over these<br />
last 18 months. I think this is going to give him a<br />
chance for a very clean break.<br />
We'll see the real new Democrat, do you think, in the<br />
next two years?<br />
I think he is a new Democrat but he tends to look like<br />
an old one because of the demands which the<br />
Democratic Party make of him. You see, when he came </p>
<p>Barrie Cassidy:<br />
Barrie Cassidy:<br />
Paul Keating:<br />
Barrie Cassidy:<br />
Paul Keating:<br />
Barrie Cassidy:<br />
Paul Keating: to Washington I don't think the Democratic Party said,<br />
' Oh, here's the new Democratic President. Let's see<br />
what we can do for him.' The view was: here's a new<br />
Democratic president, can we knock him into shape?<br />
Okay. Still a lot to talk about. We'll be back in a<br />
moment. ( Commercial break)<br />
Back with the Prime Minister, Paul Keating. Clearly,<br />
you're not going to tell me when you are getting out of<br />
politics but have you made up your own mind? Have<br />
you got a ball park idea about when you plan to get out?<br />
No. No I haven't.<br />
Because you have said that you've got at least a<br />
strategy, if not a time table.<br />
I've always said that I think there is a time when you've<br />
done your best and you should basically clear off. But<br />
I'm still I think kicking goals, so<br />
I suppose a week like you've just had would encourage<br />
you to stay around even longer?<br />
Well you do get that sort of feeling with a week like this<br />
I think. I've been here 25 years last month but I came </p>
<p>early, Barrie, so I can sort of stay on, if you see what I<br />
mean.<br />
Barrie Cassidy:<br />
Paul Keating:<br />
Barrie Cassidy:<br />
Paul Keating:<br />
Barrie Cassidy:<br />
Paul Keating: And you can't set up something like APEC and then<br />
walk away from it because, as you say, there's so much<br />
follow-up work to be done it could take years.<br />
And it's so interesting as well. I mean it's so interesting<br />
to get these countries together and put all the blocks<br />
together; to see all the blocks coming together in a sort<br />
of a change. I mean APEC didn't have to happen. There<br />
was no logical reason why it had to happen. It happened<br />
simply through cooperation and goodness basically<br />
some people seeing something better, which I thought<br />
was tremendously encouraging. I think it's the most<br />
encouraging thing that's happened in the last probably<br />
years.<br />
So I presume from all of that you can go to the next<br />
election and promise Australians that you will serve the<br />
full term?<br />
Indeed. So that's at least four years, and perhaps longer?<br />
I think it's silly to be saying, I'm here for the next<br />
decade, and all this sort of stuff. I've always taken the<br />
parliaments parliament at a time. I started thinking about </p>
<p>Barrie Cassidy:<br />
Paul Keating:<br />
Barrie Cassidy:<br />
Paul Keating:<br />
Barrie Cassidy: my life in here after I was here about three years. Well<br />
I've been here 25 now and so I'll obviously think about<br />
it and carry on.<br />
What do you think you will do next, when you put all<br />
this behind you?<br />
Well I don't think anyone knows really, do they, when<br />
they're in public life? I mean it's such a high wire act,<br />
public life, you just wonder how you go off the wire.<br />
You joined, as you said, at 25. You cut off your options<br />
at a very early age in many respects. From someone<br />
who has worked and lived overseas for three years, it's<br />
one of life's great experiences have you ever felt that<br />
you denied yourself some of that? The opportunity to<br />
work overseas<br />
That's the thing about Australian politics. You can't hop<br />
out and hop back in. I mean, in the US if there's a<br />
Democratic administration, the Republicans all clear off<br />
to their private lives and they come back a few years<br />
later. You can't do this in Australia. You sort of grind<br />
on till you're finished. I'm a stayer, I hope, so I'll stay<br />
on. But would you look forward one day to experiencing life<br />
overseas and perhaps living over there for a while? </p>
<p>Paul Keating:<br />
Barrie Cassidy:<br />
Paul Keating:<br />
Barrie Cassidy:<br />
Paul Keating: Not necessarily. I would look forward to a life without<br />
the attendant pressures and strain and stress of public<br />
life. It's not the hours, ever, it's the responsibility. It's<br />
the responsibility but, again, I've had it as a Minister<br />
now for 12 years, as Prime Minister, and one gets a bit<br />
case hardened to it I think.<br />
I know, again from my experience working with a<br />
former Prime Minister, that this invasion of privacy is a<br />
constant problem. Is that something that you struggle to<br />
cope with?<br />
Oh everybody does I think, because the media today is<br />
so intrusive and there's so much of it and everybody<br />
wants a little piece, like you're trying to get a little piece<br />
now, Barrie. I mean everyone wants a bit.<br />
Can I ask you about your kids and whether you think<br />
there are any positives for them in having a father as a<br />
Prime Minister? Or, from their point of view, is it just a<br />
damn nuisance?<br />
I think it's uplifting for the kids, but is it advantageous<br />
in the long run? Well, I wouldn't know. I mean it's very<br />
hard to make a judgment about that, I think. There's no<br />
doubt it certainly is an added pressure on them in their<br />
young years they could do without. But, again, they do<br />
see things and hear things and are part of things that<br />
other kids aren't. So there's an advantage there'. </p>
<p>Providing it doesn't affect them adversely, that's<br />
probably not a bad experience for them.<br />
Barrie Cassidy:<br />
Paul Keating:<br />
Barrie Cassidy: Okay. We're almost out of time. With the next election<br />
coming up next year perhaps into 1996 who do you<br />
think you'll be facing John Howard, Alexander<br />
Downer, Peter Costello?<br />
It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. The problem, as I've<br />
always said, for the Liberal Party is it's not the jockey,<br />
it's the horse. The problem is the Liberal Party has had<br />
it. So I don't think it matters whether it's Alexander<br />
Downer or it's John Howard or whoever it is. I mean I<br />
think the Liberal Party constitutionally is in trouble. It's<br />
basically not a national party. It's just a party of six<br />
state runts and that's why you hear all this talk about<br />
state's rights all the time state's rights in the Liberal<br />
Party because all the Liberal Party thinks about is the<br />
rights of the states because it is just a states' party.<br />
Okay. We are out of time. Thank you for giving up part<br />
of your weekend. We appreciate it very much. Next<br />
week's program will be the last for the year. I hope you<br />
can join us then. So it's goodbye from Meet the Press.<br />
