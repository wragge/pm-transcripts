CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
OPENING OF THE EXTENSIONS AT THE<br />
HEIDELBERG REPATRIATION GENERAL HOSPITAL<br />
MELBOURNE 24 APRIL 1989<br />
On the eve of Anzac Day 1989, Australians once again recall,<br />
with sorrow and with pride, the sacrifices made by our<br />
servicemen and women in defence of liberty and peace around<br />
the world.<br />
At Gallipoli and in France, at El Alamein and Tobruk, in<br />
Greece and Crete, at Kokoda, in the Coral Sea, and at Long<br />
Tan, and at hundreds of other battle fields throughout the<br />
globe, Australian forces have distinguished themselves by<br />
their valour and their tenacity.<br />
War Graves around the world show the immensity of the<br />
sacrifice Australians have made. Only this year, I had the<br />
honour of laying a wreath at the Commonwealth War Cemetery<br />
near the River Kwai in Thailand which honours the Allied<br />
prisoners who gave their lives on the Burma Railroad. Later<br />
this year it will be my privilege, in France, to visit<br />
viillers Bretonneux, where men from the First AIF fought and<br />
died in the great battles of 1918.<br />
In ceremonies around the nation tomorrow, Australians will<br />
pause to remember those who fought, and those who did not<br />
return home from the fighting.<br />
But Anzac Day is not just an occasion on which we should<br />
look backwards to the exploits of war. It is also an<br />
occasion for us to look to the present and to reaffirm our<br />
determination, as a community, to repay the debt we owe our<br />
veterans. Today with the opening of this new ward here at Heidelberg,<br />
we are demonstrating anew our determination to repay that<br />
debt as fully as we can.<br />
-Throughout Australia, Repatriation Hospitals are being<br />
upgraded with new buildings and new medical equipment, in<br />
order that veterans continue to receive the very best of<br />
health care, provided by dedicated staff, and backed up by<br />
access to the best medical technology available.<br />
Here at Heidelberg there have been dramatic changes, with<br />
the expenditure of some $ 42 million over the last six years<br />
on new and refurbished buildings and new equipment. </p>
<p>I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the medical,<br />
nursing and administrative staff at Heidelberg for their<br />
dedication and skill in supporting our veterans.<br />
I am also pleased to announce that the Government has<br />
allocated another $ 1 million for new radiology and<br />
cardiology equipment at Heidelberg and its counterpart<br />
hospitals at Concord in Sydney, Greenslopes in Brisbane, and<br />
Daw Park in Adela-ide and new orthopaedic and urological<br />
equipment at Hollywood in Perth.<br />
Veterans deserve the best in health care.<br />
Here at Heidelberg, and around the nation, they are<br />
receiving the best in health care.<br />
I want to make clear my Government's complete determination<br />
to ensure that, as the health care needs of veterans change<br />
over the years, they continue to get the best.<br />
That is why we are moving to integrate Repatriation<br />
hospitals into the State system.<br />
Integration will ensure that veterans continue to have<br />
access to the best medical staff and equipment, and it will<br />
provide veterans with a greater choice, often including<br />
placement in hospitals closer to their homes.<br />
The Veterans' Affairs Minister, Ben Humphreys, and I, have<br />
guaranteed on a number of occasions:<br />
no repatriation general hospital will be transferred to<br />
a State until a satisfactory agreement has been reached<br />
on matters such as priority of access and quality of<br />
health care for veterans and war widows, and unless the<br />
interests of hospital staff have been adequately<br />
safeguarded; and<br />
no final decision will be taken if the RSL has<br />
reasonable cause for dissatisfaction with the proposed<br />
arrangements.<br />
There is nothing equivocal about these guarantees and there<br />
is no secret agenda.<br />
This is not a step towards abolishing the Department of<br />
Veterans' Affairs or eliminating the special and separate<br />
status that veterans have in our community.<br />
Indeed I want to tell you today that the Government is<br />
absolutely committed to maintaining a separate Department of<br />
Veterans' Affairs answerable to its own Minister.<br />
Under this Government, the Department will continue to<br />
exercise the Commonwealth's responsibility for veterans'<br />
health care and it will continue to respond to the<br />
particular needs of veterans, of war widows and of their<br />
dependants, to ensure that those people receive, the<br />
compensation to which they are entitled and which they<br />
deserve. </p>
<p>Anybody who questions this Government's commitment to<br />
meeting, through the Department, the needs of veterans, or<br />
who casts doubt on that commitment, is only seeking to<br />
mislead. The philosophy and objectives expressed in the Department of<br />
Veterans' Affairs corporate plan are based on ensuring that<br />
the delivery of services to veterans meets the needs of<br />
those veterans.<br />
The Department is committed to:<br />
helping veterans to cope with their disabilities and to<br />
improve their health and well being;<br />
delivering in the best possible way benefits, health<br />
care and other services that meet the changing needs of<br />
beneficiaries; and<br />
Sdeveloping and promoting policies within Government that<br />
meet the needs of all veterans, war widows and their<br />
families.<br />
I have given you my promise that the Department of Veterans'<br />
Affairs will retain its current role and status and that<br />
promise will be kept.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
While we contemplate the changing health needs of the ageing<br />
veterans of the two World Wars, let us not forget the lesser<br />
number of equally important veterans the 50,000 who served<br />
ty Vietnam.<br />
As a group, these veterans have endured special difficulties<br />
since their return to Australia.<br />
We have tried to meet these needs through means such as the<br />
Vietnam Veterans' Counselling Service.<br />
I have always made it clear that whatever one's views about<br />
the controversy that surrounded the Vietnam War, no one can<br />
ever doubt the commitment and the courage of the Australian<br />
soldiers who were called upon to fight it.<br />
I was very pleased to attend the Welcome Home Parade in<br />
Sydney in October 1987, which, at last, gave fitting honours<br />
to the men who fought there.<br />
The Government has also agreed to the construction of a<br />
memorial to the Vietnam Veterans to be built in Anzac Parade<br />
in Canberra. We have allocated a site and we will be<br />
providing a sum of $ 200,000 towards the cost of building the<br />
memorial. I trust this will work as an incentive to others<br />
in the community to support this valuable memorial.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, </p>
<p>Next year, we will be celebrating the 75th anniversary of<br />
the event that in many ways still defines the Australian<br />
identity and consciousness the landing by the ANZACs at<br />
Gallipoli. This will be an anniversary that Australians will want to<br />
mark with dignity and special awareness of its significance..<br />
It is not too early to begin now our planning of how we<br />
should honour that occasion.<br />
Recently the Defence Minister, Kim Beazley was asked by a<br />
group of World War One veterans to assist them to make a<br />
pilgrimage to Gallipoli for the 75th anniversary.<br />
Mr Beazley passed on the request to me and we have agreed<br />
that there could be no more fitting way for the nation to<br />
honour the achievements of these veterans, and of recalling<br />
the sacrifices of their comrades-in-arms, than to send a<br />
party of veterans back to Anzac Cove on Anzac Day, 75 years<br />
after the first landing.<br />
So I am pleased to say today that the Government has decided<br />
that we should make one of the RAAF's 707s available for<br />
this purpose, together with all the necessary support.<br />
In addition, I feel that it would be appropriate for me as<br />
Prime Minister to attend this ceremony and might I add, I<br />
would find it deeply moving in a personal sense to be there.<br />
Accordingly, I am considering the possibility of doing so as<br />
part of an official overseas visit next year.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
OW. The Australian veterans community deserves our deepest<br />
support.<br />
The Government, on behalf of the community, is doing what it<br />
believes is necessary to safeguard and advance the<br />
well-being of our veterans.<br />
Our concern must embrace, as it does, the oldest World War<br />
one veteran and the youngest man serving today with the<br />
United Nations peacekeeping force in Namibia a contingent<br />
which will, for the first time, -receive full repatriation<br />
coverage in view of the hazardous nature of their service.<br />
The Department of Veterans' Affairs will continue to meet<br />
the diverse and changing needs of those veterans in a way<br />
which respects the debt we owe to them.<br />
It is in this context with a message of our continuing<br />
commitment to the veterans that I now have the pleasure of<br />
declaring this ward block open. </p>
