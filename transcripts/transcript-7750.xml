TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP, GULF SHOPPING CENTRE, PORT AUGUSTA,<br />
21 SEPTEMBER 1989<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: inaudible<br />
PM: It's a free society and I was very pleased to have the<br />
opportunity of talking with the chemist.<br />
JOURNALIST: what did you tell him?<br />
PM: I said these things. Firstly, that we had made an offer<br />
to the chemists early on and they were very close, I think<br />
there was only about one vote or so on their council against<br />
accepting it. So then we had no alternative but to go to the<br />
Tribunal, a Tribunal which as I reminded him was set up not<br />
by us but by our predecessors, by the conservatives. They<br />
set the Tribunal up and in setting the Tribunal up they said<br />
in the Parliament in introducing the legislation that it was<br />
appropriate to have these decisions distanced from the<br />
Government. That's why they set up the Tribunal.<br />
JOURNALIST: inaudible<br />
PM: What I'm telling you is the answer to your question.<br />
Can I please finish giving you the answer. I told him that<br />
we went to the Tribunal set up by our predecessors because<br />
there couldn't be agreement. He said he thought it was a<br />
good idea the Tribunal, I said well yes that's what we've<br />
done but now the Tribunal's giving its decision you don't<br />
seem to agree with it, he said that's right.<br />
What needs to be done now is that we talk with your guild.<br />
Please use your influence to get them to talk with us<br />
because there is room, definite room to go beyond the<br />
decision that was made by that Tribunal in respect to some<br />
things that concern me and that's what we want to do. so I<br />
think he understood that.<br />
