    <content><![CDATA[<p>The China-Australia Free Trade Agreement means more jobs for Australians.</p>
<p>Trade means jobs, and more trade means even more jobs.</p>
<p>A fortnight ago, former NSW Premier and Foreign Minister Bob Carr came out in support of the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement.</p>
<p>Last week, former Prime Minister Bob Hawke came out in support of the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement.</p>
<p>Yesterday, South Australian Labor Premier Jay Weatherill came out in support of the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement.</p>
<p>And, this afternoon, Victorian Labor Premier Dan Andrews has come out in support of the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement.</p>
<p>The only person standing in the way of jobs and the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement is Bill Shorten – who is taking instructions from his union masters and the CFMEU.</p>
<p>If Bill Shorten and the Labor Party try to reject the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement they will be sabotaging our economic future and they will be turning their back on one of the greatest opportunities our country has ever been offered.</p>
<p>I say to Bill Shorten: listen to decent Labor people, and stop dancing to the tune of the CFMEU standing in the way of jobs for Australian workers.</p>
<p>This is a decisive moment for the economic future of Australia.</p>
<p>Australia has nothing to fear and everything to gain from freer trade.</p>
<p>We are in the right place at the right time, and – as far as my Government and I are concerned – we can, we must, and we will seize this moment.</p>
