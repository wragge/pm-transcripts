PRIME MINISTER Tuesday 2 June 1992<br />
JOINT STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER THE RON PAUL<br />
KEATING, MP; THE MINISTER FOR FINANCE, THE EON RALPH<br />
WILLIS# MPl; AND,* THE MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT AND<br />
COMMUNICATIONS, SENATOR THE EON BOB COLLINS<br />
The Government has approved the sale of Australian<br />
Airlines to Qantas.<br />
It has also endorsed sale of 100 per cent of the combined<br />
airline, subject to approval by the Australian Labor<br />
Party. The Government has also decided to establish an<br />
independent Tribunal to allocate international aviation<br />
routes.<br />
These decisions where taken by Cabinet last night and<br />
agreed by Caucus this morning.<br />
The decision to sell Australian Airlines to Qantas<br />
follows detailed examination by the Department of<br />
Finance's Task Force on Asset Sales of initial indicative<br />
bids for Australian Airlines.<br />
The main factor bearing on the Government's decision was<br />
the increased value placed on the synergistic benefits<br />
which will result from operating the domestic carrier and<br />
Qantas together.<br />
A sale agreement will be signed tomorrow between Qantas<br />
and the Government under which Qantas will pay $ 400<br />
million for 100 per cent of Australian Airlines.<br />
Settlement of the sale will be finalised by the end of<br />
September after which Australian Airlines will become a<br />
wholly-owned subsidiary of Qantas.<br />
The acquisition will allow for significant synergistic<br />
benefits and operational efficiency gains which will<br />
increase the ultimate sale value of Qantas as well as<br />
benefiting the travelling public. </p>
<p>Taken together with the new aviation regulatory changes<br />
also announced today, this transaction will ensure a<br />
strong and viable aviation industry in Australia in<br />
future.<br />
As part of the transaction the Chairman of Qantas, Mr<br />
Bill Dix, and the Chief Executive, Mr John Ward, will<br />
Join the Board of Australian Airlines as soon as<br />
possible. In proposing to sell 100 per cent of Qantas the<br />
Government will retain a " golden share" providing a<br />
number of national safeguards.<br />
These will include requirements that:<br />
no more than 35 per cent of voting equity be<br />
sold to foreign interests;<br />
the trading name " Qantas" be retained for<br />
international air transport passenger services<br />
provided by the company;<br />
the head office of Qantas remain in Australia;<br />
and a majority of Qantas' Board be Australian<br />
citizens.<br />
The trade sale of Qantas will continue contingent with<br />
settlement of the acquisition by Qantas of Australian<br />
Airlines. The Government expects no diminution of interest in<br />
Qantas by prospective purchasers as a result of this<br />
acquisition. In fact, a number of prospective purchasers have<br />
indicated that this acquisition would strengthen their<br />
interest in the combined entity.<br />
Prospective purchasers already approved for access to the<br />
next and final stage of the trade sale of<br />
Qantas/ Australian Airlines are being advised.<br />
The Government will also seek expressions of interest<br />
from new bidders attracted by the proposed revised<br />
ownership arrangements.<br />
The parties concerned will be permitted to conduct their<br />
own detailed " buyer due diligence" investigations into<br />
the combined entity prior to submitting binding bids.<br />
The trade sale process is expected to be completed by the<br />
end of this calendar year. </p>
<p>Significant resources are being allocated to preparing<br />
for a public float of the remaining eguity in Qantas<br />
which will be undertaken in the period immediately<br />
following the trade sale.<br />
With the decision to sell 100 per cent of Qantas, this<br />
will involve a major equity raising, recapitalisiig the<br />
airline on a competitive commercial basis and returning<br />
well over $ 1 billion to the Commonwealth Budget.<br />
INDEPENDENT TRIBUNAL:<br />
An independent Tribunal will be responsible for assessing<br />
applications by domestic carriers for international route<br />
and capacity entitlements on the basis of criteria to be<br />
determined by the Government.<br />
Licensed airlines will be eligible to seek the right to<br />
fly international services to the many countries where<br />
multiple designation is provided under existing bilateral<br />
air services agreements.<br />
Until the Tribunal is established, Qantas will continue<br />
to be Australia's designated international airline, other<br />
than on trans-Tasman routes.<br />
The Government has decided to clearly separate route<br />
authorisation and carrier selection procedures from its<br />
continuing regulatory and administrative functions, by<br />
establishing an independent Tribunal. This separation is<br />
consistent with practices in a number of major aviation<br />
countries. The Government's objective is to introduce a process<br />
which will be clearly seen as being open, transparent and<br />
accessible to all parties and the Government will be<br />
legislating to give this effect.<br />
At the same time, the Government has ensured that such<br />
matters as tourism and trade, route economies, incumbent<br />
airlines' rights and entitlements, the interests of other<br />
Australian carriers and broader national interests are<br />
adequately reflected in the criteria to be considered by<br />
the Tribunal.<br />
The combination of existing unused capacity and<br />
additional capacity, arising out of bilateral<br />
negotiations, will provide the opportunity for the<br />
commencement of operations by competitive Australian<br />
carriers on international routes.<br />
The new approach provides for the gaining of potential<br />
benefits and exposure to competition for all airlines<br />
under a timetable where access to new markets is aligned<br />
with competition in existing markets. </p>
