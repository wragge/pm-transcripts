PRIME MINISTER 115/ 93<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MPR<br />
ENTOMBMENT OF THE UNKNOWN AUSTRALIAN SOLDIER AN EVENT<br />
OF NATIONAL IMPORTANCE<br />
I am pleased today to formally declare the funeralI and entombment of the<br />
Unknown Australian Soldier in the Australian War Memorial on 11 November<br />
1993 an event of national importance.<br />
The ceremony, timed to mark the 75th Anniversary of the 1918 Armistice, will<br />
be the most significant commemorative event in the history of the Memorial<br />
since it opened on Armistice Day 1941. Surviving Australian veterans of the<br />
first world war will participate in the ceremonies providing a unique<br />
opportunity for the nation to honour them and to remember all Australians<br />
who have fought and died in war.<br />
Assisted by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission and officials from<br />
the Australian Funeral Directors' Association, the Australian War Memorial<br />
will recover the remains of an unknown soldier irom one of the many<br />
battlefields cemeteries in France. It was this area where Australia suffered Its<br />
largest number of casualties in the first world war. The Tomb in the<br />
Memorial's Hall of Memory is intended to symbolise all Australians who have<br />
died in war, and to provide a central point for national remembrance.<br />
A national telecast of the event will be provided by the Australian<br />
Broadcasting Corporation. All Australians, wherever they may be, are<br />
encouraged to participate. They may attend thi) funeral in Canberra, take<br />
part in their local Remembrance Day ceremony or watch the ABC broadcast.<br />
I ask all Australians to join in the observation o1 the traditional two minutes<br />
silence at 1 1: 00am on 11 November.<br />
