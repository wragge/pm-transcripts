PRIME MINISTER'S PRESS CONFERENCE<br />
PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA,<br />
TUESDAY, 27 NOVEMBER, 1973<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Ladies and gentlemen, we were able to fit this<br />
in this morning which, as you know, I try to do alternatively<br />
if I can but House business usually prevents us being evenhanded<br />
between the afternoon papers and the morning. You will be<br />
interested in the report which I have just tabled in the House of<br />
Representatives from Mr Terry Winter on the use that can be made<br />
by the Australian Government of the powers which we are seeking at<br />
the Referendum on 8 December. Mr Winter was a member of the<br />
ACTU Executive for many years; he was appointed by the Menzies<br />
Government to the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration<br />
Commission. There have been several Cabinet Committee meetings<br />
this week but only a short one of the Cabinet itself. The only<br />
announcement that I can make now there will be some at the end<br />
of the week is of the Defence Force Ombudsman. You will remember<br />
that in my policy speech last November I undertook to appoint a<br />
military ombudsman. Mr Barnard has actively pursued this undertaking<br />
to the stage where legislation is being prepared and we expect that<br />
it will be introduced in the autumn session next year. In<br />
anticipation of the passage of the legislation, the Government has<br />
decided to name the first defence force ombudsman. He will be<br />
Mr David Hay, CBE, DSO, who, as you know, is the Permanent Head<br />
of the Department of External Territories. He is a man of very<br />
considerable accomplishments he is well versed in matters of<br />
Government, had a distinguished war record with the.. 2nd AlE' from<br />
1940-1946, anid has taken an active interest in community affairs. The<br />
Government is confident that together with his military experience<br />
Mr Hay wil~ l bring a very desirable blending of administrative<br />
capacity anid balanced understanding of service life to the office.<br />
There wil. 1 also be an Australian ombudsman whose appointment will<br />
be announced later on. The Winter Report, that was the one I was<br />
referring to there. To give the long title Power Over Prices<br />
and Incomes Report to the Australian Government on Certain<br />
Matters Relating to Power over Prices and Incomes. Mr Winter acted<br />
as a Task Force in the same way as Dr Coombs did on the inherited<br />
governmental commitments. Are there any questions.<br />
QUESTION: Why was the Winter Committee kept seeing as<br />
you are under criLticism during the referendum campaicn for not<br />
spelling out what you will do with prices power. Why didn't you<br />
announce that the committee was meeting and would come up with<br />
some report?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: It was intended all along that its report would<br />
be published. I asked for it by the 23rd of this month, it came<br />
to hand on that date, copies have been made, it has been tabled and<br />
now released at the first opportunity.<br />
QUESTION: Do you condemn the killing on the Syrian front in the<br />
October war of 24 bound and gagged Isracd-i pf~ isoners?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't know any facts on this but obviously we<br />
condemn any breaches of what should be accepted standards of the<br />
treatment of prisoners of war. </p>
<p>QUESTION: The European countries and Japan have been pressured<br />
by the Arab States into adopting a much harder line o'n Israel nd<br />
in particular into demanding a complete withdrawal a unilateral<br />
withdrawal to the 1967 borders without any guarantees as to the<br />
future security of Israel without any guarantees of secure<br />
borders. What is the Australian Government's position on this now?<br />
Do we go along with the position as stated by the Europeans and<br />
the Japanese?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I will not comment on your version of what the<br />
western European countries and Japan have done on this subject. I<br />
do not endorse your version of it; I don't refute your version<br />
of it; I speak on behalf of the Australian Government. As I said<br />
in answer to a question without notice this morning, the attitude<br />
of the Australian Government is the same as that of preceding<br />
Governments. We have supported the Gorton Government, the McMahon<br />
Government, the present Government have all supported the proposals<br />
made by the Security Council unanimously in 1967 in its Resolution<br />
No. 242. The Australian Labor Party summarised that Resolution<br />
and made it part of its Party Platform at the last Federal<br />
Conference in Surfers Paradise in July. I will read it to you<br />
again as I did in the House. " The situation in the Middle East<br />
remains the greatest threat to the peace of the world. There can<br />
be no peace until the Arab States respect and recognise Israel's<br />
sovereignty and right to exist. Equally, there can be no peace<br />
until Israeli forces have been withdrawn from occupied territories<br />
to secure and recognise boundries and a just settlement of the<br />
refugee problem is achieved".<br />
QUESTION: How much longer can you afford the luxury of being<br />
criticised by the Federal A. L. P. President, Mr Hawke, and in view<br />
of his latest public criticism of you and your Government<br />
particuldiriy on the Middle East, do you belier tjtosr stat,: rnents<br />
are daind. ginj to the Governmen~ t's standing and do you propose to<br />
take step,, s tc, h:,. ve him silenced by the Fec ral A. L. P. ExecW-ivr<br />
PRIM-E MINISTPL ilt 1Ii,,-: ke i~ i tde it quite plain he has been<br />
at pains to emphasis~ e, and I repeated this in th,-House in answer<br />
to two questions without notice this morning, that on this subject<br />
he is sztoaking as a private citizen. He is cxpressing personal<br />
views. the Lcader of the Government I have to carry out the<br />
governmen-t's policy. I have just read it to you, it happens to<br />
be the sanie policy as our predecessors had. Australia's policy<br />
on the M~ iddle East is bipartisan. it has been for a quarter of a<br />
century.<br />
QUESTION: Sir, do you honestly believe that a man in high public<br />
office can -uddenly take off the mantle of that office and speak<br />
for himself? Also, do you believe that foreign embassies based<br />
i. n Canberra will accept that in their reports back to their home<br />
offices, and do you accept the same right for yourself that you<br />
-7ouldl speak privately?<br />
I. RIME MINISTER: No. As head of Government'I can only speak in<br />
av,-cordance with Government policy and it is my duty, which I try<br />
to discharge without let up, to carry out that policy. I believe<br />
that embassies and High Commissions in Canberra know what the<br />
Government's policy is. </p>
<p>QUESTION: It was my understanding that uranium leases in the<br />
Northern Territory would not be renewed until the report of the<br />
Woodward Commission was finalised and that understanding was<br />
confirmed when you said in the House on 18 October that: " I believe<br />
we should wait for its further report so that any legislation which<br />
the Government puts before the Parliament will be as invulnerable<br />
as is possible to anticipate". I now understand that a Cabinet<br />
committee meeting yesterday decided to renew the exploration permits<br />
in the uranium province of the Northern Territory. Could you<br />
explain that apparent change in policy?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: There are two matters I should point out. One is,<br />
there is some confusion you seem to suffer it too between<br />
leases and licences. The second is that Cabinet committees may<br />
meet on subjects, and they are meeting on this subject, but the<br />
decisions are made by the Cabinet. The Cabinet has not considered<br />
this matter.<br />
QUESTION: Do you see any need to conserve or perhaps ration<br />
Australia's fuel supplies at this stage?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No. Mr Connor answered a question without notice<br />
on this yesterday.<br />
QUJESTION: What's the situation today regarding the Government's<br />
efforts to solve the TAiA standoff. If it continues for any length<br />
of time, do you have any estimates on how soon TAA will have to<br />
stand down other staff people who may not be able to withstand<br />
a long stoppage as well as the pilots?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I haven't discussed this with my colleagues<br />
since last night. I haven't discussed it for, I suppose, 14 hours<br />
now. I would imagine that the pilots will be going back to their<br />
duty and that they will observe safety standards without complaint<br />
from now on.<br />
QUESTION: Going back when?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I have no more information on this.<br />
QUESTION: Could you Lcoll me what your attitude is towards the<br />
announcemrenlt by the P~ cr t. IAt they will seek an increase of<br />
a week in the national wage and an increase in the minimtum wage<br />
from $ 60 to $ 702?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: This matter has not been considered by the Government<br />
yet, and I would make no comment until it was.<br />
QUESTION: Having in mind that last week the Senate rejected the<br />
motion of a joint sitting to decide where the new Parliament House<br />
should be, has your Government made any fresh move on this?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: We haven't discussed it. </p>
<p>QUESTION: Do you think it will be decided this year before the<br />
Parliament rises?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I think it is most unlikely. I imagine that both<br />
Houses will be debating other matters until they adjourn for<br />
Christmas and I see no chance of the Government discussing this<br />
matter with the agenda it has.<br />
QUESTION: Have you accepted the resignation of Senator Cavanagh<br />
as Minister in Charge of Government Business in the Senate, if not,.<br />
do you intend to, and thirdly, so that the matter can be clarified,<br />
who in fact is in charge of Government business?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I am sorry, I have no more to tell you on this.<br />
QUESTION: Last week you were quoted as saying that you expected<br />
that any minister who wished to challenge a decision in Cabinet<br />
back in the Caucus would inform the Cabinet first and you<br />
referred to two offenders. Have you done anything further about<br />
this?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No. You are referring to an answer I gave to<br />
Mr Laurie Oakes in an interview which was published in the Melbourne<br />
Sun last Friday or Saturday. I have done no more since then.<br />
QUESTION: Recently a staff memorandum circulated between some<br />
departments, said that in view cf the Government's support for<br />
the United Nations sanctions on Rhodesia that public servants and<br />
ministers would not be able to travel to or through Rhodesia and<br />
citizens would not be able to go to Rhodesia on official or<br />
diplomatic passports. This has been interpreted as meaning that<br />
public servants may not go to Rhodesia even in a private capacity,<br />
and I understand the decision was taken when you were Foreign<br />
Minister. I ask does this in fact mean that public servants may<br />
not go on private visits to Rhodesia and if it does mean this, do<br />
you think this in any way affects their civil rights as citizens?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't remember the details of this now, it<br />
was some months ago. The general attitude would be that public<br />
servants and military officers have responsibilities to the<br />
Government which they advise or, in many cases, represent. They<br />
cannot detach themselves from their official position.<br />
QUESTION: Do you mean that they couldn't even get a private<br />
passport, Prime Minister?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: If you want anything further on this I will have<br />
to give you a considered reply to it, but I don't remember the<br />
details. Public servants or military officers are not entitled to<br />
compromise a Government. Now if you want further information, qive<br />
me a written question and I will give you a written reply. </p>
<p>QUESTION: The Arab oil producers have taken to ranking different<br />
nations according to their friendliness and favourableness such<br />
as the Dutch and the Japanese etc. Has the Australian Government<br />
had any official communication about the standing of the Arab<br />
oil producers?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't believe so. I haven't inquired, I haven't<br />
been informed. There has been some speculation about why Mr Haig<br />
visited the oil countries the Gulf States and so on. I will<br />
take this opportunity to point out that he visited the area weeks<br />
before the outbreak of the 18 day war and the arrangements for<br />
his visit were made many weeks before that.<br />
QUESTION: Are you concerned that some of your ministers are being<br />
unnecessarily provocative at question time with the length of<br />
their answers. I ask the question because of an aside from the<br />
Speaker to you during Question Time in which he appeared to be<br />
asking you to pull some of them into line and it also appeared<br />
from the Press Gallery<br />
PRIME MINISTER: When was this, today?<br />
QUESTION: During Question Time. There was a comment which came<br />
across the loud speakers, in which he said you ought to tell some<br />
of your ministers<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't remember him saying this. I didn't hear<br />
him say this?<br />
QUESTION: It came over the earphones.<br />
PRIME MTNISTER: I didn't hear it, I am sorry.<br />
QUESTION: Are you concerned at all?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I believe that ministers naturally enough. reply<br />
-in a tendentious way sometimes to questions which are asked in a<br />
tendentious way. Questions without notice transgress the Standing<br />
Orders constantly. All you ladies and gentlemen would realise that<br />
one would not be allowed to put on notice a question in the terms<br />
which are constantly used in questions without notice. There are<br />
some very offensive terms and implications used in questions without<br />
notice, and there is no such offence given in the replies.<br />
QUESTION: Mr Hawke said last night that he thought about 50 per cc'nt<br />
of Caucus agreed with his point of view and he said that he would<br />
also do his best he thought he had a duty to do his best to<br />
influence people to his point of view. Do you think Mr Hawke has<br />
a right to influence or perhaps try to organise Caucus to try and<br />
change the Party's policy on the Middle East? </p>
<p>6-<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Any person has the right to influence opinions<br />
of Members of Parliament. The Australian Labor Party has declared<br />
an attitude on this matter in the terms I have just read out to<br />
you, and all of us are bound by that until the Federal Conference<br />
alters it. It is, I reiterate, substantially the policy which<br />
Governments have pursued for the last quarter of a century in<br />
Australia Australia has a bipartisan policy, a policy of<br />
neutrality in the Middle East, and the Australian Labor Party's<br />
Platform on this matter is a summary of the United Nations Security<br />
Council's unanimous Resolution of 1967 No. 242. ' That resolution<br />
provides the basis of a settlement in the Middle East and the<br />
various interests which have to be safeguarded Israel's existence,<br />
the Arab territories, the rights of the Palestinians, can be best<br />
asserted and vindicated if that unanimous Resolution of six years<br />
ago goes into operation. It is very fortunate now that there is<br />
going to be this meeting, these negotiations in Geneva next month.<br />
QUESTION: You have set such a cracking legislative pace that<br />
you have hospitalised some members and caused bad backs all round<br />
the House.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Bad backs are not on our side.<br />
QUESTION: I was wondering, Sir, apart from the damage done to the<br />
inhabitants of Parliament House, do you think this cracking pace<br />
is damaging your image with the public and perhaps confusing them?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I think the cracking pace may be confusing the<br />
public in so far as there isn't the opportunity to explain the<br />
purpose or the details of the legislation. This year there will<br />
be about twice as many bills passed by the Parliament as there<br />
has been in any previous year. But when you mention the cracking<br />
pace, this is the cracking pace of legislation. I would point<br />
out that th-e Parliament's hours are very much more civilised. While<br />
we are sitting more hours in the day, for instance, we are sitting<br />
on Tuesday and Wednesdays in the morning as well as in the afternoon<br />
and night, and we are also quite often sitting on Monday afternoon<br />
and night when it has been very rare indeed to sit on Mondays at<br />
all in the past. While all that is true, we don't sit beyond<br />
11 p. m. at night, and I would like to pay tribute to Fred Daly the<br />
Leader of the House, the fact that we have kept reasonable hours<br />
throughout this year. I think there has only been one case when<br />
we have sat after 11 p. m. and that was by agreement just to get<br />
something through in the extra 2 minutes which was required to get<br />
it through. If you look back to what has happened in previous<br />
years as far back as I can recall ( that would mean as far back<br />
as any of you can recall) at this time in the Spring Session we<br />
would always be sitting well after 11 p. m. and usually after<br />
12 midnight. Now we are keeping proper hours long hours, many<br />
days, but bad backs haven't been caused by late, late sittings.<br />
And since I mention this which is not only a relief for members of<br />
Parliament, for all the staff and for all of you ladies and<br />
gentlemen who have to report theParliament, there is also the fact<br />
that every opportunity has been given for Private Members to raise<br />
matters. And if they raise them by way of a motion, a vote is<br />
taken on that motion. In previous years whenever a Private Member<br />
moved a motion on alternate Thursday mornings no vote was ever<br />
taken. It remained on the Notice Paper until the Parliament was<br />
clissolved. There is no such motion still on the Notice Paper in<br />
the House of Representatives this year. Every Private Members' </p>
<p>-7-<br />
motion has gone to debate and vote and on the intervening Thursday<br />
mornings there has always been grievance day. So Private Members<br />
are not being hustled or excluded. There is a terrific amount<br />
of legislation, that's true. I-ow some of the legislation had to<br />
be put through because Papua New Guinea is becoming self-governing<br />
at the end of this week; some had to be put through because we<br />
had obligations which we wanted to honour by the 25th anniversary<br />
of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights on the 10th of next<br />
month, but most of it, the great bulk of the legislation, was in<br />
the party platform and emphasised in my policy speech on behalf<br />
of the party last November.<br />
QUESTION: When do you expect to finish now, first week or second<br />
wee k?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I think it is more likely to be the second week<br />
but there is no definite decision made on this. You will see from<br />
the Notice Papers that there is some substantial legislation which<br />
ought to be got through. There again, perhaps I should say, that<br />
there has never been under us any bill coming up for debate until<br />
there has been an intervening Wednesday morning for the Opposition<br />
parties to consider it and usually at least a week. Many of the<br />
pieces of legislation have come on for debate many weeks after<br />
they were introduced and given the minister's second reading<br />
speech.<br />
QUESTION: Will you guillotine the Health Bill, sir?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: You mean the Universal Health Insurance one?<br />
QUESTION: Mr Hayden's?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't know how long the debate will take. It<br />
is a shorter bill., a simpler and clearer bill than the legislation<br />
which it will replace. There has been ample opportunity for<br />
Members of Parliament to understand it because you will remember<br />
there was the White Paper by Messrs Deeble and Scott in the autumn<br />
session; there was the amended White Paper, the definitive one,<br />
which Mr Hayden brought in at the beginning of this month, and<br />
there has been debate on the Estimates of the Department of Health<br />
and th-e Department of Social Security; there has becen a Private<br />
Member Ãµ Motion which was debated and voted so I shouldn't believe<br />
there is an excessive amount of time required. It won't be<br />
debated until next week.<br />
QUESTION: Do you see any dangers yet to the Australianr economy'<br />
from the Lrab boycotts on our major trading partners, and woul. d<br />
you agree that there is a possibility of a wor~ d-uide recessor,<br />
next year?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: There is obviously going to be somE: 1 effect. on<br />
Australia's trade from the fact that our major triding partners<br />
are being hit by the energy crisis and the energy crisis has been<br />
made more severe by the prospect, in some cases the actuality,<br />
of Arab reduction. There has been a great deal of speculation<br />
by economists that there is going to be some recession among the<br />
industrialised trading nations of the world. Australia would be<br />
more happily situated, both as regards energy sources and also<br />
as regards prcduction and trading patterns, than most of those other<br />
countries. </p>
<p>QUESTION: Taking foreign policy apart, what do you think are<br />
the three or four principal achievements of the Government at<br />
the end of its first year in office?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The biggest one is the transformation we have<br />
made in educational opportunities. I haven't thought out what<br />
other ones I should mention. I would put next, I suppose, the<br />
involvement, the direct relationship, already achieved in many<br />
respects and now being sought to be extended, between the<br />
national government and elected local government bodies. And<br />
probably in that context also, I should mention the more rational<br />
arrangements which are being made for the production and sale<br />
of our primary products and the emphasis being taken in national<br />
plans for urban matters in general, i. e. transport, housing,<br />
environment, where most of the people live.<br />
QUESTION: What do you see as your three or four biggest mistakes,<br />
Prime Minister?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: You always get one of the very earliest questions,<br />
and you were told that it was the last one. </p>
