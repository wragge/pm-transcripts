PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH HOWARD SATTLER, RADIO 6PR 27<br />
FEBRUARY 1992<br />
E AND OE PROOF ONLY<br />
SATTLER: Good morning Prime Minister.<br />
P14: Good morning Howard.<br />
SATTLER: Does it apply, the statement I just read?<br />
PM: Absolutely. I mean there is no point in being<br />
in this game buat trying to move the common wheel along to make<br />
things better and this is a time to try and get the economy<br />
out of the recession into a recovery and we have done it I<br />
think in a way which adds to the productive f ocus of the<br />
place, by the big rail, road and port infrastructure<br />
development programs which will provide work and make<br />
Australia stronger and better.<br />
SATTLERi But are you doing it for us or are you doing it<br />
to save your own bacon?<br />
PM: Obviously we are doing it for the country.<br />
There is no election campaign on now,, it's 15/ 18 months away.<br />
SATTLER; You are kidding. The election campaign is<br />
underway it got underway when Dr Hewson delivered his<br />
atatement, surely.<br />
PM: Let Dr Hewson go for his life. The fact of the<br />
matter is this government has continually moved through these<br />
large economic changes in the economy and now we are on to all<br />
these so called micro. changes like airlines, ports, wharves,<br />
rail, road and it is these things which we think we can do<br />
more with and we have now as a result of this package, for<br />
instance you will be able to bring freight into Perth and take<br />
it right across on a standard gauge railway to Melbourne arid<br />
Sydney, and vice versa. We will be building ring roads around<br />
the capital cities so that the cars are not driving right<br />
through the middle. </p>
<p>SATTLER: But i have to ask you why have you waited till<br />
now, just one year out from the election?<br />
PM: We have been doing a lot of this over time.<br />
The rail freight corporation we did a couple of years ago.<br />
What we are doing now is quite dramatically adding to the<br />
stock of capital which that will have and its charter to do<br />
more things. Airline deregulation we started on a couple of<br />
years ago we are now completing it by letting Qantas f ly<br />
inside Australia and the domestics f ly out. I mean this is a<br />
continuum of change but again it's the difference between<br />
Labor, the party of builders in this country, it always had to<br />
build the bicr national projects and do the big national things<br />
and the coalition which is basically about a miserable<br />
exercise in accountancy.<br />
SATTLERt But Prime Minister we have had eight Keating<br />
budgets and we have had a series of economic statements<br />
inbetween and we have had with all of that the worst economic<br />
slump since the Great Depression.<br />
PM: Yes but you also had eight years of phenomenal<br />
growth and phenomenal employment growth.<br />
SATTLER: well what went wrong then?<br />
P14: well what went wrong was that in the end there<br />
was too much lending and spending.<br />
SATTLER: You were the government why didn't you stop it?<br />
PM: But this was an international thing. Banks<br />
create credit. We had credit growth running at 20% a year in<br />
1988/ 89 and 1987/ 88 and this was happening also in the USA, In<br />
Britain, Canada and Europe and that is why now they are in<br />
recession for the same reason we are.<br />
SATTLER: So you are saying Australian banks included are<br />
out of control, out of government control?<br />
PM: Well they were. We are now down to credit<br />
growth rates of about 1-2% a year, we were running at 20 and<br />
that's what happened. I mean in 1989 we had spending running<br />
at twice the capacity of the economy to produce. Now if I had<br />
been any Treasurer worth his or her salt the only thing to<br />
have done was to try and pull it back so that is was<br />
affordable and that's basically what we did. But the reason<br />
it got there was not because of any extravagance by the<br />
government. Remember this/ Howard in those years I cut the<br />
public sector back to produce large surpluses, this spending<br />
happened in the private sector. But the main point is that we<br />
had f ive timeB as much job growth in the first eight years of<br />
this government as we had in the last seven years of the<br />
former government, the Fraser government, we had twice as much<br />
economic growth in the 80s as we had in the 70s. Now we have </p>
<p>PM: ( cont'd) had an 18 months to 2 year slowdown, a<br />
recession, what we are now doing is getting out of it to get<br />
back on with the growth which Labor has always been committed<br />
to.<br />
SATTLER: You are talking about producing 800,000 jobs<br />
but what is the good of that if more than 800,000 fall out the<br />
other end of the pipeline, that's what has been happening in<br />
the last 2 years hasn't it?<br />
PM1 No what we are saying is that unemployment will<br />
stabilise and fall and with<br />
SATTLER: I hope so because it's 11.3% over here at the<br />
moment. PM: Well ok but the fact of the matter is we have<br />
got to do two things. You have got to have the economy<br />
running fast enough to take up the jobs of the new entrants to<br />
the workforce, that's the school leavers as they come on and<br />
also take up some of the unemployment which is now pooling in<br />
the economy so you have got to be running the economy at some<br />
speed. SATTLERi Ok, but what about immediately for instance<br />
cutting immigration because how can we keep bringing people<br />
into Australia and putting them on the dole queues?<br />
PM: Migration is a long term program for this<br />
country. Migration has made Australia bigger, stronger, it's<br />
grown faster, it's wealthier as a result of it.<br />
SATTLERt In the good times.<br />
PM: No, in all the times. What the program does is<br />
that we lift it and lower it to look in terms of the economic<br />
cycles and that's why we lifted it in the good times of the<br />
and we have been lowering it ever since.<br />
SATTLERt Well doesn't it need to be lowered even more at<br />
least in the short term?<br />
PM: I think it will be lowered more.<br />
SATTLERs When?<br />
PM: When our annual review is completed in April.<br />
SATTLERi In April and you will make an immediate<br />
decision? PM: We do it every April, we make a decision every<br />
April. </p>
<p>SATTLERa So we can expect you think to see some sort of<br />
reduction in immigration in the short term<br />
PM: it was 140,000 at its peak about 18 months or 2<br />
years ago. This year it's down to 111,000, it's down to<br />
111,000 and we have got the review procedures on now looking<br />
to business. The people that mostly argue for higher<br />
migration intake is the business community who look for the<br />
skills they need and skills in demand and it's the skills in<br />
demand and business migration program which has been part. of<br />
the general ' buoyancy in the migration issue.<br />
SATTLER: But surely you would want young Australianst to<br />
take up those positions. I mean you are creating all sorts of<br />
new positions in technical and further education to train<br />
young Australians. Surely you would want business to take<br />
them before migrants?<br />
PM: The answer to this is economic growth and<br />
that's why in this year we forecast at ' 92/ 3, that's from July<br />
1 this year for this 12 months following. July 1 this year we<br />
have got 4.75% growth a year. Now f or this year we have had<br />
zero growth, the economy has just stayed where it is but we<br />
will have wa think a conservative 4.75%. If you look at any<br />
of the graph of this over the years, employment and growth<br />
in the economy are tied almost together. When growth in the<br />
economy goes up employment goes up, when growth goes down it<br />
goes down so if we get growth in GDP up and we get growth in<br />
the economy up we will get growth in employment which will be<br />
enough to take up the school leavers, chop into unemployment<br />
and handle what comes from the migration<br />
SATTLER: Yes but Prime Minister not surprisingly tha<br />
economists are jumping out of the woodwork today and one of<br />
them a Chase Manhattan economist reckons your forecast for<br />
growth in the first year out of a recession are too<br />
optimistic. PM: I was Treasurer in 1983/ 4 coming out of John<br />
Howard and John Hewson's recession and we forecast 6% growth<br />
through the yea~ r and we got it, we got 6.1% in fact.<br />
SATTLERt ' And you will get it again.<br />
PM: No we are not even seeking that much we think<br />
we will get 4.75, that's what I say<br />
SATTLER: I mean you will get your prediction?<br />
PM: Yes I think we will get our prediction, yes I<br />
think 4.75 is a conservative number. Look, a bank economist,<br />
understand this Howard about these fellows it's off the top of<br />
the head<br />
SATTLER: SATTLaEreR : nYootu a big wrap for the banks are you. </p>
<p>PM: I They don't have an econometric model, this is<br />
put together by the Treasury, the Reserve Bank,, the<br />
statistician,~ it's the most complex national income<br />
forecasting model in the country, no economic commentator in a<br />
bank has such servicing available. It's just an opinion, just<br />
basically ignore them.<br />
SATTLER: Can we talk about the easter egg worth $ e317<br />
million to people on family allowance supplement. The cynics<br />
are saying lie is doing this just before the by-election for<br />
Bob Hawke's old seat of Wills<br />
PM It's got nothing to do with Wills, look this<br />
was decided a couple of weeks ago before Bob even announced he<br />
was retiring.<br />
SATTLERi Only a couple of weeks ago?<br />
PM: In the Cabinet process a couple of weeks ago<br />
when we decided this for the Statement.<br />
SATTLER: What do you expect people to do with that<br />
money, go and have a good time for a week?<br />
PM: I think they will basically spend it. What we<br />
needed to do before the big railway, road, port projects build<br />
up through 1L992, we wanted to get the profile of spending up<br />
in the early part of the year. Now how can you put money into<br />
the economy to give a stimulus to it in a sort of one of f way<br />
and do it early. It's not very easy. See if you do a tax cut<br />
it's very slow it comes out per week and it's very slow.<br />
SATTLER: But what do you want people to do with the $ 125<br />
or maybe $ 250.<br />
PM: They will do with what they like but the people<br />
who are getting it, families, people on family allowance and<br />
people on the family allowance supplement, both groups,<br />
generally what they will do Is spend it.<br />
SATTLER: What in one hit?<br />
PM: I don't know but I think so.<br />
SATTLER: Have one big week.<br />
PM: They will spend it in one hit or maybe little<br />
hits I don't know but they will certainly spend it. we took<br />
the decision we needed a fiscal stimulus early in the year and<br />
we said who will' we give it to and we said people who can use<br />
it and need it, families. NOW if it were John Hew-son he would<br />
give it to the top end of town he would throw it to the<br />
business community or the millionaires, we are giving it to<br />
families. </p>
<p>SATTLER: But it's pretty short term thinking isn't it?<br />
P14: No it's about trying to get spending moving in<br />
the economy. It's simply about that task, it's about an early<br />
injection of funds to get spending moving, that's the point of<br />
it. Now if you say to yourself well look that has to happen,<br />
and I believe it does, how do you best inject some money into<br />
the economy and the best thing is with a one of f payment. if<br />
you make it per week it's too little it doesn't have the<br />
impact, it takes 12 months. V'ou are doing over 12 months what<br />
you can do in a day.<br />
SATTLER: Apart from the consumption tax what is the<br />
difference between your policy and the Liberals?<br />
PM: First of all". the main thing is this is a big plan to rebuild<br />
the basic infrastructure of Australia. Taxing income or<br />
expenditure a la Dr Hewson's consumption tax, taxing it as<br />
income or whether when you spend it will make no difference to<br />
the Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, Perth railway line,<br />
it will make no difference to the ports around the capital<br />
cities, will make no difference to the roads, will make no<br />
difference to the national highways, will make no difference<br />
to technical training for children, for kids, will make no<br />
difference to' any of these things it is basically an exercise<br />
in accountancy to tax the low paid to give a tax break to the<br />
high paid. It's got no national vista about it, that is the<br />
difference here and he offers, you go and pay this 15% slug on<br />
everything you put in your mouth, everything you put on your<br />
back and he offers you a 30% marginal tax rate. We are<br />
offering the same 30% marginal tax rate but no consumption<br />
tax, no 15% string attached.<br />
SATTLERt But you have got a hidden sales tax?<br />
PM1 What do you mean hidden?<br />
SATTLER: We go to the supermarket and there are sales<br />
taxes on goods like soap and we don't know what it is.<br />
PM: But not on food, not on food, not on clothing.<br />
I mean the f act, is that wholesale sales tax has been there<br />
right through the Commonealth's history from the 30a and the<br />
fact of the matter is it works and it works efficiently and<br />
you can decide what's low taxed. Like last night we decided<br />
to reduce the tax on motor cars we took it from 20% to<br />
SATTLERs To save Joan Kirner in Victoria?<br />
PM: No no to give the car industry a f illip, to<br />
give the car industry a fillip. Do you realise that the<br />
average age of our car fleet is 17 years. We have got one of<br />
the oldest vehicle fleets in the world because people find the<br />
price of cars too expensive and they are belching out leaded </p>
<p>PM: ( cont'd) fuel emissions, they are expensive for people to<br />
run and so we are trying to give the motor vehicle industry a<br />
bit of a f illip. But you can do that if you have got a<br />
wholesale sales tax to change and that's why the wholesale<br />
sales tax has been useful. But the main point is we will be<br />
saying to the great body of Australian taxpayers from $ 20,000<br />
to $ 40,000 we will give you a 30% tax rate the same as Dr<br />
Hewson but no 15% consumption tax.<br />
SATTLER: Prime Minister the last Budget, John Kerin's<br />
Oudget was a. disaster and is now largely irrelevant. T just<br />
wonder whether this Atatement will obviate the need for a<br />
' Budget in August?<br />
PM: No no,, and it wasn't a disaster it wasn't a<br />
political success but it was in economic termsr it was a very<br />
carefully crafted Budget. No we will still do another budget<br />
this is not the be all end all.<br />
SATTLERs You are saying it was as the budgets that you<br />
produced? PM: Politically it never had the impact but in<br />
terms of its's economics. I mean the judgement was that the<br />
economy was recovering and their judgement was wrong,<br />
therefore the Budget<br />
SATTLER: Who judged it was recovering?<br />
PM: The government at the time. I wasn't part of<br />
that process.<br />
SATTLER: Well the government at the time was not much<br />
different to the government now, the sanme advisers. Have you<br />
got rid of them?<br />
PM: Well there is a different Prime Minister there<br />
is a different Treasurer and different views are being taken.<br />
SATTLERs And different advisers?<br />
PM1 In some cases yes abesolutely, in some Ca13es,<br />
but not in the key departments. But the point is simply, but<br />
that doesn't make much of a point though Howard. The fact; is<br />
Australia does need a stimulus. Now I notice Dr Hewson<br />
running around saying this is a, he is using some ridiculous<br />
expression like-it's a Bankcard proposition it's sort of you<br />
know-SATTLERs That's the one, Bankcard.<br />
PM: We can't afford this. When he and John Howard<br />
cleared off, cleared their desks out in 1983 and left me that<br />
wreckage to pick up they left me a $ 10 billion budget deficit </p>
<p>PM: ( cont'd) at the time, just on $ 10 billion when the budget<br />
was about $ 50 or $ 60 billion. Now the budget is over $ 100<br />
billion this is 62 billion, two in one hundred compared to ten<br />
in fifty or sixty. Now the fact of the matter is this is the<br />
right thing f or the government. I mean he is the only parson<br />
in Australia saying nothing should be done. The banks said<br />
the government should spend about $ 2 billion,, the ANZ Bank<br />
said it, Westpac said it, the business community have said it.<br />
The business community have said they want faster depreciation<br />
rates, Hews-on said don't talk to them, don't talk to the<br />
business community, the Prime Minister shouldn't be talking to<br />
the business community they only want a tax break, nothing<br />
should be happening. He would prefer to see the country sink,<br />
live in more troubles, stay in trouble than see the government<br />
do something about it lest it reflect well on the government.<br />
SATTLER: How long before any of your plan will start to<br />
work. Will it start to work before the next election because<br />
it if doesn't<br />
PM: That was the point of the payment to families<br />
it will start to work from April.<br />
SATTLER; Yes but will it reduce unemployment before the<br />
next election?<br />
PM: We think so.<br />
SATTLER; Because if it doesn't you are in deep trouble<br />
aren't you?<br />
PM: I think our job is to stabilise Lhe rise in<br />
unemployment and to see the trend head down.<br />
SATTLER: And do you think that will happen before the<br />
next election?<br />
PM: I think so, yes.<br />
SATTLER: Why don't you just call an election now. I<br />
mean all the major policies are out in the open, why don't you<br />
just let the people decide now who is best and then you can<br />
get on with it?<br />
PMt W4hy, the parliament doesn't expire until June<br />
93.<br />
SATTLERt Would you be afraid to go to the polls now?<br />
PM: It's not a matter of being afraid. The point<br />
is we won an election just on two years ago and this<br />
parliament has got a long way to go and I think the public<br />
would take et dim view of parties going to elections at their<br />
whim and caprice. </p>
<p>SATTLER: Why won't you debate Dr Hewson publicly on the<br />
respective packages now they are both out?<br />
PM1 I debated him in the House yesterday. He came<br />
in yesterday petulantly and moved a censure motion on me for<br />
having dare, point to the fact that the principal<br />
economitrician who examined his GST Fightback proposals<br />
pointed out that under all of his scenarios GDP or the product<br />
of the economy falls, unemployment rises and inflation rises<br />
and of course having been stung by that revelation from one of<br />
his own authors he then jumped in petulantly yesterday and<br />
called me a . iar, a cheat, a distorter<br />
SATTLER: He didn't, did he?<br />
PM: He did.<br />
SATTLER: He used words like that?<br />
PM: And did just exactly what I said a day or so<br />
ago, it would take him a day to turn nasty once there was a<br />
bit of pressure on him. This guy has had a dream run he has<br />
been wandering around, see he actually thinks that politics is<br />
a very easy caper. He dropped Fightback on the table, there<br />
was no response from the overnment, he has wandered around<br />
for a couple of months with people saying well yes, what is<br />
your views about this Dr Hewson, what is your views about that<br />
Dr Heweon, all of sudden I turn up and say your principal<br />
economic author says this reduces GDP, increases unemployment<br />
and increasen inflation. What's the point of Fightback and he<br />
said this is a shocking thing to say so he moved a censure<br />
motion on me.<br />
SATTLER: Sounds like he has pinched your acid tongue and<br />
you have become contrite.<br />
PM: No what he has done is run true to form and<br />
that is he is a very sensitive, brittle little petal and once<br />
you go and touch him or say anything about him or criticise<br />
him, I mean the old jaw locks and the face gets mean, well<br />
it's going to get a lot meaner before I am done with him.<br />
SATTLERt You are back are you, are you back?<br />
PM: What do you mean am I back?<br />
SATTLER: The real Paul Keating, not this one that is<br />
sort of is wandering around the place acting contritely.<br />
PM: No no don't give me that stuff about acting<br />
contritely. Look I always<br />
SATTLER: I couldn't believe what I saw after you got<br />
elected. </p>
<p>PM." No no but the thing is you don't see me up<br />
close, lioward. I mean at the press conferences here in<br />
Canberra I have always been the one that had to entertain<br />
them, teach them, cajole them, but what always got run was the<br />
second grab on the balance of payments or something. But<br />
the discursive Paul Keating, the talkative, the one that sort<br />
of you know has to sort of get a result out of the Cabinet and<br />
the government and the press gallery and what have you, thatoften<br />
is never in my case very rarely been shown to the<br />
public, What you have seen of me of the last few months is me<br />
really as I am. Well a broader side of me, a broader view of<br />
me rather thian simply the 30 second grab on the monthly<br />
balance of payments.<br />
SATTLERs An all round nice guy.<br />
PM: Well I would like to think so dear boy, I would<br />
like to think so.<br />
SATTLER: Now while you are there i have to ask you one<br />
question, you can tell me to go to hell or whatever, but over<br />
in England i have to tell you and you know that the gutter<br />
press over there are saying you are an awful person who<br />
breached protocol when you laid your hand on the royal<br />
personage's waist. Did you know you were breaching protocol?<br />
PM: I was not really laying a hand on Hler Majesty I<br />
Was Simply guiding her from down a long corridor to the people<br />
I knew that she knew like Dame Patty Menlzies on one side and<br />
there was John Gorton on the other side and she wasn't<br />
expected to know where they were or who they were and I was<br />
trying to sort of, which I succeeded in doing I think, that<br />
was point her along and I think she had a very interesting<br />
morning, she enjoyed it immensely.<br />
SATTLER: I have to tell you that as a result of that<br />
calls to this radio station overwhelmingly said Paul did the<br />
right thing.<br />
PM: Did they<br />
SATTLER: You got more votes yesterday for that little<br />
act than all of the economic statements and budgets over the<br />
last nine years.<br />
PM: Come on.<br />
SATTLER: True, true.<br />
PM: That's a bit of hyperbole there, a bit of<br />
hyperbole there.<br />
SATTLER: SATTLEwRe: Tdriude , p olls on it. </p>
<p>11. P? 4: You did.<br />
SATTLERt Yes.<br />
PM: Well anyway the thing is I think Her Majesty<br />
had an interesting visit to Australia and the point I made to<br />
some of the sort of forelock tuggers and British bootstrappers<br />
around here like Dr Hewnon and Mr Howard and others is that<br />
Her Majesty is the Queen of Australia and in fact The Age said<br />
it very nicely in an editorial yesterday. It said when the<br />
Prime Minister ' addresses the Queen he addresses her as Queen<br />
of Australia And it is entirely appropriate for him to<br />
articulate independent Australian attitudes. I mean she is<br />
not visiting here as the Queen of Great Britain she visits<br />
here as the Queen of Australia and to be saying that Australia<br />
is now more3 independent of Europe, that 80% of its trade is<br />
with the Asia Pacific area, that we are a country making our<br />
own way in our part of the world is of course a message she<br />
understands well. It's only all these sort of people that<br />
would like to be up there sort of you know doing business in<br />
Whitehall and trotting down to the city and picking up their<br />
sort of knighthoods and things. It's all that brigade who are<br />
Baying isn't this shocking the Prime Minister Just actually<br />
talked abouit Australian independence from Europe, isn't this<br />
terrible. I<br />
SATTLERS You will never be Sir Paul Keating.<br />
PM: Never, If you ever see me, for a start<br />
knighthoods are not permitted any more<br />
SATTLERI Good.<br />
PM: But if you ever see me take an award you suay he<br />
has had it, he's gone, forget him, it's all over.<br />
