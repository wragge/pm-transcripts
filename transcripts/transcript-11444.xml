    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE....................</p>
<p>Thank you very much and to you Mr Muto thank you very warmly for your</p>
<p> kind words of welcome. It is a very important part of my visit to</p>
<p> Japan that as parliamentarian I have the opportunity of meeting fellow</p>
<p> parliamentarians from the Japanese Diet.</p>
<p>I have often remarked on my visit that the relationship between Australia</p>
<p> and Japan is a model of how two very different societies can come</p>
<p> together and work to achieve common objectives. One of the objectives</p>
<p> is surely the promotion of the parliamentary system within our two</p>
<p> societies and the strengthening of the links between those who are</p>
<p> elected representatives of our two peoples.</p>
<p>I am honoured that so many of you have turned up this morning and</p>
<p> that it's such a representative range of members both political background,</p>
<p> age and the different constituencies that you represent. It is a very</p>
<p> strong indication to me of the great importance that the elected representatives</p>
<p> of the Japanese people place on the relationship between our two countries.</p>
<p>Although we have a very good and strong relationship it is not one</p>
<p> that should be taken for granted and it's very important particularly</p>
<p> in a global economic environment that both Australia and Japan continue</p>
<p> to work hard at strengthening and improving the relationship. And</p>
<p> that is why I agreed with the former Japanese Prime Minister, Mr Hashimoto,</p>
<p> that we would, as far as possible, meet each other as Prime Ministers</p>
<p> once a year alternating between the two countries. And I think that</p>
<p> is very important and a very powerful symbol of the commitment of</p>
<p> the two societies to each other.</p>
<p>Japan buys more from Australia than any other country and Japan has</p>
<p> been our best customer for many years. We are very conscious of that.</p>
<p> We are keen to preserve the goodwills that exists within Japanese</p>
<p> industry. And the strength of our economy makes Australia an increasingly</p>
<p> attractive country with which to do business.</p>
<p>Our economic growth rate has been between four and five per cent.</p>
<p> Our interest rates and our inflation rate are the lowest they have</p>
<p> been for more than 30 years. Our unemployment rate is also coming</p>
<p> down. Our business investment levels are very high and we have just</p>
<p> completed a major reform of our taxation system to which Mr Muto made</p>
<p> reference in his introductory remarks. All of these things indicate</p>
<p> that Australia is determined to play an even stronger role in the</p>
<p> regional and the world economy.</p>
<p>We respect both Japan's strength as the second largest economy in</p>
<p> the world and also the leadership role that that gives to Japan. It</p>
<p> is important not only to our region but also to the entire world that</p>
<p> the recent signs of strengthening of the Japanese economy continue</p>
<p> because a stronger Japan means a stronger region and a stronger world</p>
<p> economy.</p>
<p>But our relationship is not only defined by economic and trade issues</p>
<p> it is also a very strong people-to- people relationship. At present</p>
<p> tens of thousands of young Australians are being taught the Japanese</p>
<p> language at schools. There is a very strong commitment to the teaching</p>
<p> of your language in our education system and it has rapidly replaced</p>
<p> the teaching of many other foreign languages over recent years. And</p>
<p> through a knowledge of your language young Australians are being given</p>
<p> a knowledge of your ancient and special culture.</p>
<p>And finally there will be a lot happening in Australia over the next</p>
<p> two years. We will host the Olympic Games in Sydney next year and</p>
<p> for all of the following year we will commemorate 100 years of the</p>
<p> establishment of the Commonwealth of Australia through the federation</p>
<p> in 1901 of the then six colonies. And I can assure you that as many</p>
<p> members of the Japanese DIET who wish to do so should come to Australia</p>
<p> particularly at the time of the Olympic Games and I can assure you</p>
<p> of a very warm and affectionate Australian welcome if you choose to</p>
<p> do so. Thank you very much.</p>
