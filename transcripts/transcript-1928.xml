    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>P. M. No. 79/1968Â </strong></p>
<p>The United States Communication Station at North West Cape will be renamed next month in honour of the former Prime Minister, Mr. Harold Holt.</p>
<p>The ceremony will take place on 20 September, within a few days of the first anniversary of the official opening of the Station. ( This was attended by Mr. Holt on 16 September 1967.</p>
<p>Dame Zara Holt will be Guest of Honour at the renaming ceremony, and will unveil a memorial designating the station as the " United States Naval Communication Station, Harold E. Holt".</p>
<p>The American Ambassador will represent President Johnson and will read a message from the President. I will also be attending the ceremony.</p>
<p>The renaming of the Station by the U. S. Government is a gesture much appreciated by Australia. It is yet another indication of America's high regard for Harold Holt who, in his relatively short term as Prime Minister, did so much to strengthen the bonds of friendship between our two countries.</p>
