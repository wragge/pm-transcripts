PRIME MINISTER'S TOUR OF SOUTH-EAST ASIA<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr. Harold Holt, gave<br />
a dinner to return hospitality extended to<br />
him during his visit to Saigon. The Prime<br />
Minister of South Viet Nam Air Vice-Marshal<br />
Ky, was the principal guest. 24TH APRIL, 1966<br />
Mr. Holt said I would like to thank you again, Mr. Prime Minister,<br />
for the warm welcome which you and members of your Government<br />
have given me during my visit. I will leave Viet Nam with a<br />
lasting impression of The courtesies and kindnesses which I have<br />
received as your guest.<br />
May I say also that this visit has been of great value<br />
for the discussions we have conducted together and the information<br />
I have gathered at first hand here.<br />
As you know, Mr. Prime Minister, we in Australia feel<br />
that the Vietnamese people's resistance to communist aggression<br />
is of vital importance o free men everywhere. Until the<br />
communists, especially those in Pekin*, learn that they cannot<br />
achieve domination over others by their sinister techniques of<br />
infiltration, sabotage and terror, there can be no lasting peace<br />
nor personal freedom in Asia or indeed anywhere in the worl.<br />
May I also say Mr Prime Minister, that the Australian<br />
eople deeply respect ana admire the qualities of courage,<br />
fortitude and resolute independence which are part of the national<br />
heritage and character of the Vietnamese people.<br />
We are proud, Mr. Prime Minister, to stand with the<br />
Vietnamese people in their determined resistance to communist<br />
aggression and in their efforts to achieve rising standards of<br />
living. Mr. Prime Minister, Excellencies and gentlemen, I<br />
invite you to raise your glasses to the Government and people<br />
of Viet Nam to victory in their struggle for independence to<br />
success in their efforts to achieve a better life in conditions<br />
of security freedom and justice and to the deep bonds of<br />
friendship between Australia and Viet Nam which have been<br />
strengthened by our association in this common cause. </p>
