<p>Over the last two days I have been in Lismore and Port Macquarie talking to health professionals and community representatives about long term reform of our health and hospitals system.</p>
<p>For the 7 million or so Australians living in rural and regional areas, universal entitlement under Medicare does not always translate into equal access to services.</p>
<p>Already the Rudd Government is tackling the critical issue of workforce shortages out bush as part of a broader package of more than $134 million in the last budget for targeted rural health programs, in addition to significant funding provided to rural communities through the MBS, PBS, the National Healthcare Agreements and infrastructure commitments for regional hospitals and cancer centres.</p>
<p>But clearly more needs to be done.</p>
<p>The Health Reform Commission makes a range of recommendations. Some of the questions they ask include: Should under-served remote and rural communities be provided with 'top up ' funding? Do we need a greater emphasis on telehealth services? What role do networks of primary health care services play in new and innovative models of rural and remote care? Do we need, as well as the Rural Health Workforce Agency, a Clinical Education and Training Agency to take the lead in unifying strategies such as university fee relief, study leave and locum support?</p>
<p>I am keen to get your feedback - especially if you live in rural and remote areas - on how we can reform the health system to ensure it serves all Australians, equally.</p>
