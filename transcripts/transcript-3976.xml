PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESSNOVEMBER 17, 1975<br />
ADDRESS TO THE NATION<br />
Since coming to office last week as Caretaker Government<br />
we have been fully advised by-depar. tments on the state of the<br />
Australian economy.<br />
Jobs, prices, prosperity are matters that concern us all.<br />
In fulfilling our pledge to provide Australia With'sound<br />
management until the election, we have given special emphasis<br />
to our duty to be informed on the economy.<br />
During-the last week, certain facts have come to light which*<br />
we have a responsibility to place before you.<br />
They are not pleasant facts.<br />
They are not welcome facts.<br />
They show that, as a result of past policies, Australia will<br />
face very severe problems of economic management next year.<br />
These are the facts.<br />
The budget deficit will not be $ 2,800 million as planaed.<br />
We-will be about $ 4,000 million in the red by the eniiiof<br />
the year. In two years Australia will have spent $ 6,500 million<br />
more than we have got over $ 500 for every Australian. In<br />
August the former Treasurer said this kind of deficit would<br />
lead to " roaring inflation" and require " devastating monetary<br />
measures". The rate of price increases in the December quarter will be<br />
about 5% one of the highest on record one of the highest<br />
rates in the western world.<br />
This year our national production will be $ 500 million less<br />
than estimated in the last budget.<br />
Unemployment is now estimated to rise to over' 400,000 early in<br />
the new year. Tens of thousands of school leavers will start<br />
life on the dole. Where is the recovery we have been told<br />
about? / 2<br />
F75/ 248 12 </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER -2-<br />
Latest statistics show that consumer spending is not recovering<br />
as we were told it would.<br />
We now know that the political events of the last few weeks<br />
have had no effect on official statistics and forecasts.<br />
As a result of the materialonow available, in our view, under-.<br />
Labor s policies no real.. recovery-was&amp; possib-le., The recovery<br />
is a myth. The economy is not coming out of its recession.<br />
The facts ware all available to the former government.<br />
They are facts that should have been available to the Parliament@<br />
They support the view that the former government at best did<br />
not understand the extent of the damage caused by its incompetence,<br />
and that its economic policies had failed.<br />
Despite the fact that the government knew that investment had<br />
fallen last year and would fall again this year, it did nothing.<br />
New jobs depend on investment. Without investment there will<br />
be no new jobs.<br />
SThe budget deficit, declining investment, slower than expected<br />
growth, low confidence these all mean that next year Australia.<br />
will be facing more inflation, and the highest unemployment<br />
since the. great depression.<br />
In fact, official information only completed in the last few<br />
days, indicates that-there-could be-80,000 more people out of-<br />
Swork by the middle: of next year than expected. This shows<br />
unmistakably that talk of a recovery is quite wrong.<br />
The previous government was told the situation by its own.<br />
expert committees, especially-the Mathews Committtee. a They<br />
warned how serious--the-situation was.:<br />
SThey warned that. unless reforms were introduced the very survivaL.<br />
of private enterprise-wa threatened,-<br />
It is worth remembering that private enterprise provides three<br />
out of every four jobs in Australia. </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER -3-<br />
The previous Labor Government ignored the recommendations.<br />
It was not prepared to exercise any of the necessary restraints<br />
on its own spending. In light of the facts I have given<br />
Government will continue to get bigger, leaving no room for new<br />
jobs in private enterprise.<br />
If the Australian people approve our policies at the election,<br />
we will take action to introduce the recommended . reforms as<br />
soon as practicable we have-long supported them. They will<br />
form part of our full three-year-programme to get Australia<br />
moving ahead.<br />
The reforms will mean that. for the-first time,. wage and salary<br />
increases due solely to inflation-will not lead to heavier-taxes.<br />
They will mean that business will not be paying away in taxes the<br />
money it needs to create jobs.<br />
These reforms, supported by the trade union movement, together<br />
with other policies to be announced in the policy speech will<br />
provide a solid basis for the recovery of business confidence,<br />
for co-operation between all sections of the community for<br />
restraint in government spending.<br />
Under the terms of our commission from the Governor-General the<br />
Liberal and National Country Parties are pledged not to change<br />
any government policies before the election on December 13.<br />
Our respo'nsibility is to manage-Australia to the best of our<br />
ability, without changing policies, until that time.<br />
The last three years have-hurt many people. Those who are<br />
worse--off are:-<br />
The weak and unorganised<br />
The poor, the retired:.<br />
The-small businessman and. the farmer<br />
The school leaver<br />
The family man who is paying more of his wages in tax than<br />
ever-before-in-our-. hisry.<br />
The first essential step on-the road to prospe-rity is tobe-hone-st<br />
with ourselves about what h&amp; s happened, to recognise the-problems<br />
for what they are immensely tough problems we can solve if we<br />
are prepared to work together as a people. / 4 </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER -4-<br />
I regret that this is a gloomy report. It is not going to be a<br />
quick and easy task to overcome the difficulties created by past<br />
policies. Australia has had three dark years.<br />
We are like a family that-has-greatly overspent-its income:.<br />
our house is mortgaged<br />
we have debts-to pay witrr: basically the same reaL: income<br />
It takes more than a year or-two to pay off these debts.<br />
I have the greatest confidence that Australians working , together<br />
can resolve their present problems. But it won't be-easy.. It wil<br />
require work. It will require determination. It will require---<br />
effort, it will require the co-operation of all Australians.<br />
Our policies will be directed to working with all of you to give<br />
Australia a responsible government, and one that you can trust.<br />
