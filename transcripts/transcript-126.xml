MELBOURNE " PEACE" CONFERENCE<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER IN THE HOUSE OF<br />
REPRESENTATIVES ON TUESDAY, 27TH OCTOBER. 1959<br />
Mr. Deputy Speaker the function of the Australian security<br />
ihtelligonce organization is perfectly clear. It was established<br />
by the late Mr. Chifley; it has been continued by us.<br />
It operates in a direct sense under the Prime Minister but it is<br />
attached to the Attorney-General's Dupartment for certain admihistrative<br />
purposes. It reports to me on matters about which it<br />
thinks I should be informed. It undoubtedly maintains contact<br />
with the Department of External Affairs. It would be a very remarkable<br />
state of affairs if it did not, since the Department of<br />
Externa Affairs is charged with responsibility for our relations<br />
with other countries and is in charge of a general policy which,<br />
in one of its major aspects, consists of resistance to Communist<br />
aggression. The security intelligence organization is our principal<br />
weapon for gathering knowledge about Communist activity,<br />
and I will continue to encourage it to perform its duty in that<br />
respect in spite of anything that may be said about it.<br />
It is quite true that in one exceptional case, the circumstances<br />
of which were referred to by the Attorney-General ( Sir<br />
Garfield Barwick) this afternoon, and on request, information was<br />
given to one gentleman in Sydney who was a sponsor of this congross.<br />
It is not the function of the security intelligence organization<br />
to go around persuading people. It has no instructions<br />
to do so and, with that one exception on request it has<br />
not done so. But it keeps me informed and, through me, it keeps<br />
the Government informed of what goes on. I am happy to say that<br />
there is very little that goes on in the Communist Party organization<br />
of Australia with which one is not familiar as a result<br />
of the activity, loyalty and zeal of the officers of the security<br />
service. This particular congress that is to be held seems to<br />
have been the occasion for this trouble. In the very few minutes<br />
that I have, let me say one or two things about it. There is<br />
nothing very mysterious about them. They have only to be stated.<br />
They have their effect on the minds of sensible people.<br />
This congress issued a printed pamphlet describing what<br />
it was about and what its functions were. It made no secret,<br />
because on the very first page it said<br />
" The idea for the congress arose from the post-war history<br />
of the struggle for peace.."<br />
That is a phrase that we have heard so frequently from those who<br />
have conducted the cold war. The statement went on<br />
the post-war history for the struggle for peace and in<br />
particular from the Stockholm Conference for Disarmament and<br />
International co-operation last year."<br />
Does anybody, with any wits about him, suppose for one moment or<br />
have any doubt that the Stockholm Conference was a Conmunist<br />
front? The Stockholm Conference, which then began to operate<br />
through the World Peace Council and, as it comes to Australia and<br />
New Zealand, through the Australian Peace Council, enlisting the<br />
aid of those remarkable bodies like the Eureka Youth League and<br />
a half a dozen bodies of that kind, notoriously Communist or<br />
Conmmunist controlled or made up of Coraunist fellow travellers?<br />
There is no mystery about that.<br />
The marvellous thing to me is that anybody should suppose<br />
that the eminently respectable people xihose names have been<br />
put forward as sponsors are actually those who have promoted the </p>
<p>2.<br />
conference. They are not. This conference was promoted as a<br />
result of the Stockholm Conference. It is perfectly clear that<br />
this conference has been made the main 1959 activity of the Communist<br />
Party of Australia. This is their great effort for this<br />
year and if it succeeds in attracting the attention of a sufficient<br />
number of thousands of non-Communists, they will regard<br />
that as rather a propaganda victory.<br />
Those are the simple facts about the matter. These<br />
are the people who have promoted the conference. What they have<br />
done is to go to a number of eminently respectable people and<br />
say: " Would you mind having your name used as a sponsor for this<br />
conference?". And a lot of people, who, like everybody in this<br />
House, desire peace and who would do much to secure it, have<br />
said: " Yos, if this is for peace, you may use my name." But there<br />
is a very great difference between being an invited sponsor and<br />
being an invitor, an orgarizor, a promotor, and I say, with no<br />
hesitation, that the whole of the initial promotion of this conference<br />
goes back to Communist, and Communist-allied organizations.<br />
Indeed, anybody who cared to examine the list of the executive<br />
officers would, without knowing too much, know that the<br />
list embraces a number of well-known and notorious Communists,<br />
Therefori Sir, I want to say this: If it is the desiro<br />
of the Labour Party to promote a peace conference, good. Let it<br />
do so. That is intelligible. If it is the desire of the Churches<br />
to promote a peace conference, they have an enormous constituency<br />
and a powerful spiritual influence on the people of Australia;<br />
let them do so. But itis very odd to me that some of<br />
them should allow themselves to be drawn into the organization of<br />
a congress which they have not promoted at all but with which,<br />
unhappily, they have allowed their names to be associated,<br />
I wonder if honourable members ever cast their eyes on<br />
the " Tribune", the Comnunist official journal? They will find<br />
that that has given a powerful boost to this conference and well<br />
it might because this is the task for this year,<br />
Now I must confess that I was surprised to hear my<br />
friend the honourable member for Melbourne Ports ( Mr. Crean), who<br />
just concluded his speech, and whom nobody would accuse and I<br />
thoroughly agree of being a Communist, and whose intentions on<br />
this matter are of the highest. I am surprised that he should<br />
take some pleasure in the statement that the Labour Party in Victoria<br />
is supporting this congress. At the risk of occupying a<br />
minute longer than I should, I just want to say this: The Labour<br />
Party has spoken about this matter twice. The Australian Labour<br />
Party through its Federal conference and executive in 1951 gave<br />
consideration to the Australian Peace Council, one of the active<br />
promoters of this Conference. What did they say? They said<br />
" Your executive gave consideration to the standing of the<br />
Australian Peace Council in relation to the Australian Labour<br />
Party and determined as follows<br />
That this Federal Executive, being of the opinion that<br />
the Australian Peace Council is a subsidiary organization<br />
of the Communist Party, we therefore declare that it is<br />
not competent for any member of the Australian Labour<br />
Party to be associated therewith."<br />
If that was true in 1951, when did it cease to be true? It certainly<br />
had not ceased to be true in 1955 because once more the<br />
Partycame back to the same problem and this is something which I<br />
will quote and, having quoted it I need say no more. What they<br />
said was this:<br />
" The Executive now declares that it is Communist stra':. gy<br />
to use these functions to represent the West as aggressive<br />
and the exclusive centre of danGer to world peace to conceal </p>
<p>the aggressive actions of Communist regimes in Eastern<br />
Europe and in Asia and to bring about negotiations between<br />
Communist regimes and the ' elst under circumstances when<br />
territorial concessions will be made by the West in return<br />
for concessions which have no substance."<br />
Sir, that is a<br />
ent position.<br />
by quoting it. pretty clear and powerful exposition of the pres-<br />
Therefore, Sir, as I said I can satisfy myself<br />
I agree with it. I stand by it. </p>
