PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF DEBATE WITH ANDREW PEACOCK, LEADER OF THE<br />
OPPOSITION, ABC STUDIOS, SYDNEY, 25 FEBRUARY 1990<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
MURPHY: Bob Hawke says this election is the most<br />
important in 40 years as he tries for a fourth term as<br />
Prime Minister. Andrew Peacock says he's certain he'll<br />
be Australia's next Prime Minister. Well tonight we'll<br />
put them both to the test. And joining me is a panel of<br />
four senior political journalists elected by the Federal<br />
Parliamentary Press Gallery Warwick Beutler from ABC<br />
Radio Current Affairs, Laurie Oakes from the Nine<br />
Television Network, Alan Ramsey from the Sydney Morning<br />
Herald newspaper and Paul Kelly who's political editor of<br />
the Australian newspaper. Now let me explain the rules<br />
of this debate. Of course it's always hard to work out<br />
the rules but after exhaustive discussions between all<br />
parties, we've decided to tackle it in a way which we<br />
hope makes it as interesting and informative as possible.<br />
The Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition will<br />
talk on three issues the economy, social policy and the<br />
environment. They'll question each other and then the<br />
panel questions both of them. Later the panel will throw<br />
questions to both leaders on any issues and topics that<br />
they care to choose and we'll wind up with final<br />
statements from Mr Hawke and Mr Peacock. Time<br />
restrictions have already been agreed to and as we have<br />
only one hour, I'll be rigorous but reasonable in<br />
applying these rules. So now let the great debate of the<br />
1990 election campaign begin. The first topic is the<br />
economy. A few minutes ago we tossed a coin, the Prime<br />
Minister called, he won and he allowed the Leader of the<br />
Opposition to lead of f so Mr Peacock, the economy.<br />
PEACOCK: Thank you very much, Paul. I think for<br />
starters the one thing that I would agree with that Mr<br />
Hawke has said in this election campaign is that this is<br />
the most important election in the last 40 years of<br />
Australia's history. For the reality is Australia needs<br />
a new era, a new epoch and a new spirit.<br />
You know and I know that the economy is on the brink of<br />
collapse. Business failures are at a record level,<br />
family living standards have been shattered, our<br />
children's futures have been mortgaged because of the<br />
spiralling debt and so the decision that you'll take on </p>
<p>24 March is in fact one of the most important in the last<br />
years.<br />
But worse still in the outline that I could put to you,<br />
worse still, is that for the first time in Australia's<br />
history we contemplate the reality that the next<br />
generation of our children could inherit worse living<br />
standards than their parents. This has never happened<br />
before and it should never have happened. You know and I<br />
know who is to blame.<br />
My opponents deliberately chose the high interest rate<br />
route. They deliberately chose an economic instrument<br />
which is both crude and cruel.<br />
They could have tightened fiscal policy, they could have<br />
freed up the labour market and with those settings in<br />
place, had a steadier monetary policy which would not<br />
have had the effect of adding to the inflationary<br />
pressures pushing interest rates up. Oh no, they took<br />
the high interest rate route. They can not therefore<br />
blame anything else for the choice was theirs.<br />
Now we're saying to you, what Australia requires is a<br />
coordinated set of programs. We will tighten fiscal<br />
policy and we've identified in our Economic Action Plan<br />
$ 2.7 billion of costs, of cutting of expenditure in our<br />
first year alone.<br />
We are of course utilising $ 2 billion of that savings for<br />
families, for tax relief a child care rebate, a child<br />
tax rebate, easing of the eligibility and increasing the<br />
dependent spouse rebate. We're abolishing the capital<br />
gains tax where 80 percent of the men and women who paid<br />
capital gains tax in the last figures available earned<br />
only $ 35,000 or less and that ain't millionaire stuff,<br />
but the Labor Party keeps threatening me with the<br />
allegation that we're doing it for millionaires. Eighty<br />
percent of those who paid capital gains tax earned<br />
$ 35,000 or less.<br />
But the great stress has to be on the family and we've<br />
produced a program which will give genuine relief for<br />
families, a marked contrast, a marked contrast<br />
staying with the status quo.<br />
MURPHY: OK, I must stop you there and now ask the Prime<br />
Minister, Mr Hawke, to speak.<br />
PM: Next month you must make the decision as who is the<br />
best equipped to run the Australian economy.<br />
For the last seven years with my colleagues I've been<br />
running the biggest business around here and that's the<br />
Australian Government and for the first time in history<br />
we have made a profit out of running that business<br />
never before. </p>
<p>In the last three years, a $ 17 billion surplus and I have<br />
applied that surplus, that $ 17 billion, to wipe out<br />
Commonwealth Government debt. As far as you are<br />
concerned, through your Commonwealth Government, you owe<br />
no overseas debt at all. We are an international<br />
creditor. But I've done that at the same time as we've<br />
reduced tax rates.<br />
I inherited from this crowd a top rate of 60 cents in the<br />
dollar, we've brought it down to 47 a bottom rate of<br />
we've brought that down to 21 and we've done that by<br />
making the rich pay where they didn't pay before a<br />
capital gains tax, a fringe benefits tax and closing off<br />
all those tax avoidance rorts that we inherited.<br />
But as well as doing that we've substantially cut<br />
outlays. For the first time in history, against what Mr Peacock<br />
has said, for the first time, four successive years of<br />
real reductions in outlays which has allowed us to<br />
transfer $ 30 billion of resources to the private sector<br />
and that's where the jobs have been created 1.6 million<br />
new jobs and 92 percent of them in the private sector.<br />
We've done that because together, you and the Government,<br />
have put Australia's future first.<br />
We've had predictable wage outcomes and with that we've<br />
been able to restructure the Australian industry.<br />
We now have had in the last four years a 54 percent<br />
increase, real increase, in manufactured exports. We're<br />
sending cars to the United States, we're exporting steel<br />
to the world, imports are coming down and we have the<br />
biggest investment surge in history $ 90 billion worth<br />
of investment projects identified by Access Economics to<br />
bring on $ 10 billion worth of extra export income in the<br />
years ahead.<br />
There's had to be high interest rates because we've gone<br />
too strong, but you've accepted that and I know it's<br />
hurt, it hasn't been pleasant, but now the banking sector<br />
says that the policies are right, that the interest rates<br />
are coming down.<br />
If you're going to control interest rates, you've got to<br />
control wages, you can predict the wages outcome<br />
under us, under Mr Peacock it will be a wages explosion.<br />
He has a $ 6 billion unfunded set of promises which will<br />
blow the deficit out again. So, if you are going to keep<br />
restructuring the economy, keep up with manufactured<br />
exports, bring interest rates down, then you must control<br />
wages which we can, he can't you must fund your<br />
promises. I will fund every promise I make during this<br />
election against the $ 6 billion unfunded situation of the<br />
conservatives. </p>
<p>So there it is. If you want interest rates down, exports<br />
going ahead and jobs growth, then you must have wages and<br />
fiscal control. We've got it.<br />
MURPHY: Well now we go to an interesting part and this<br />
is where the leaders question each other. First question<br />
to you Mr Peacock.<br />
PEACOCK: Thank you, Mr Murphy. Mr Hawke, in your 197,<br />
1987 election policy speech, not once, not twice, but<br />
three times you undertook to the Australian people that<br />
you would get interest rates down. Home mortgage rates<br />
are now at a record level.<br />
MURPHY: Will you get to the question.<br />
PEACOCK: Yes, sure. Well you can see that your promise<br />
has been broken.<br />
PM: No, what has happened, Paul and viewers, is that<br />
I've conceded publicly that at the end of 1988 every<br />
professional economist, every private and Government<br />
economist underestimated, we underestimated the strength<br />
of demand and demand grew so much in the Australian<br />
economy, recognised and reflected by the fact that there<br />
was an, an eight percent increase in expenditure, a four<br />
percent increase in consumption. Now we could have, if<br />
we'd wanted to, still having a tight fiscal policy and<br />
tight wages policy, let a soft monetary policy which<br />
would have wrecked the economy. You just would have had<br />
more imports that you can afford. So we had to take the<br />
tough decision. I'm neither masochist nor sadist, but<br />
that's what had to be done and the banking sector has<br />
realised and recognised now that under those policies,<br />
interest rates will come down.<br />
MURPHY: Do you have a quick follow up question?<br />
PEACOCK: Not worthwhile after that answer.<br />
MURPHY: Well, Mr Hawke, now you can question Mr Peacock.<br />
PM: Yes, well, I'd like to ask you, Andrew, you have<br />
said, rightly, that if you are going to get a reduction<br />
in interest rates, then inflation must come down. Now I<br />
guess if you are thinking about getting inflation down,<br />
you must have some idea, some target in your mind of what<br />
wages outcome there will be necessary to bring inflation<br />
down. What's the target rate for wage increase you have<br />
in the first year?<br />
PEACOCK: You love targets because those who like<br />
centrally planned economies always like targets and they<br />
want people to meet ' em. We believe in the market and<br />
we're not getting into this game. Our target, if you<br />
want to use that term, is to get labour costs down to the<br />
equivalent rate of our trading partners and we can only<br />
do that with a stress on productivity and we are </p>
<p>underlining the drive for productivity in our wage<br />
fixation mechanism which you're not prepared to<br />
undertake. Together with that, of course, in reaching it<br />
we can have our drive through tighter fiscal policy,<br />
freeing up the labour market and a steadier monetary<br />
policy which will be directed towards getting inflation<br />
down. But without the program of freeing up the labour<br />
market, without a program directed toward getting labour<br />
costs equivalent to that of our trading partners, what<br />
will happen is that inflation will continue to enter,<br />
eat into wages and those real wages which under your form<br />
will not turn around.<br />
MURPHY: A follow up, Mr Hawke?<br />
PM: Well, you said on 31 August, your exact words, that<br />
Government should stay out of industrial disputes, stay<br />
out of wage fixing as such, they just get in the way.<br />
That means that you will just leave it absolutely free if<br />
you meant what you said on 31 August. You'll leave it<br />
absolutely free for the strong to get whatever wage<br />
increase they want. Is that correct?<br />
PEACOCK: No, that's not so. Industrial disputes..<br />
Government ought get out of the way. They tend to play<br />
politics with it. In terms of wage fixation, this, the<br />
current system will remain. You will in fact have<br />
amendments in directions to the Commission to take note<br />
of productivity. International competitiveness and<br />
employment in the fixing of wages and those who move out<br />
will get wage rises in line with productivity increases.<br />
MURPHY: OK. We now move to the members of the panel, my<br />
colleagues, and the first question comes from Paul Kelly<br />
and it's to Mr Hawke.<br />
KELLY: Mr Hawke, after seven years in the job, can you<br />
tell us where we are in terms of achieving in this<br />
country a truly internationally competitive economy? Are<br />
we nearly there, are we just in the middle or are we<br />
still at the start?<br />
PM: No, we're past the start. Let me give you examples,<br />
as I said in my opening statement, that we are now<br />
exporting cars to the United States. We are exporting<br />
vehicle parts to Japan. Let me give you the outstanding<br />
example. When we came to office BHP was contemplating<br />
closing the Australian steel industry. I saved the steel<br />
industry and now we are exporting steel all around the<br />
world we are a world class competitive exporter'of<br />
steel. We couldn't have done that without wage restraint<br />
and cooperation, so we're there. But importantly we're<br />
having wage restructuring, award restructuring as well,<br />
so that the training that will take place in industry<br />
will be relevant to modern processes. I can take you to<br />
factories around Australia which are now competing in the<br />
most competitive markets in the world in a whole range of<br />
exports of manufactured goods. So we're doing it, </p>
<p>there's more to be done, but you can only do it under our<br />
wages policy.<br />
KELLY: But, Prime Minister, how can you say we're nearly<br />
there when our inflation rate at the moment is one and a<br />
half times that of our trading partners and we've got a<br />
net external debt at over $ 100 billion, one of the worst<br />
in the world?<br />
MURPHY: And you've got 30 seconds<br />
PM: Well, let me say this in respect of our debt. You<br />
look at the debt. Access Economics identifies the other<br />
side of that debt. $ 90 billion worth of investment<br />
projects in this country which they say will project<br />
another $ 10 billion of export income in the years ahead.<br />
KELLY: And they say that debt will get worse. They say<br />
that in the paper that they released last week.<br />
PM: But, but they also make it clear that as far as the<br />
Government is concerned that we've wiped out debt and the<br />
debt that is being accumulated by the private sector is<br />
increasing the productive and competitive capacity of<br />
Australian industry.<br />
MURPHY: OK, now Warwick Beutler puts a question to<br />
Andrew Peacock.<br />
BEUTLER: Mr Peacock, Senator Janine Haines, who wanted<br />
to be here but couldn't, wants to know how you justified<br />
further deregulation of the Australian economy and<br />
particularly, how do you go about implementing your<br />
policy of abolishing capital gains tax and further<br />
privatisation of organisations such as Qantas when the<br />
Democrats hold the balance of power in the Senate, will<br />
do so after this election and they're to be opposed<br />
to those policies?<br />
PEACOCK: Well, of course, the Democrats aren't running<br />
for office in the sense of running for Government. The<br />
Democrats never produced programs for Government. Great<br />
respect for many members of the Democratic Party, the<br />
Democrat Party, but they are not seeking to govern<br />
Australia. Therefore, if you vote for the Democrats,<br />
you'll be voting for a group of people who want a degree<br />
of purchase and leverage on events but do not want to<br />
lead the nation through the 1990s. And leading the<br />
nation through, through the 1990s, returning to<br />
incentive, returning to programs for development, labour<br />
market deregulation absolutely essential, following the<br />
freeing up of the banking and finance system, the capital<br />
gains tax I indicated in my opening statement<br />
percent of the men and women who paid capital gains tax<br />
earned $ 35,000 or less. So I want to return incentive.<br />
I want to get taxes down. If Janine Haines wants to<br />
oppose that, let her do so at her own peril. </p>
<p>BEUTLER: But the reality is you do have to deal with the<br />
Democrats. Are you going to do it?<br />
PEACOCK: Well, the reality is that they've got to get<br />
elected. What I'm proposing for Australia is a new era.<br />
What I'm proposing for Australia will return incentive to<br />
Australia and Australians and let her seek to oppose my<br />
programs which will be helpful to the great bulk of men<br />
and women who've been slugged under this Government, not<br />
only through interest rates, but through high taxes. I<br />
have the programs to do it, the Democrats regrettably<br />
don' t.<br />
MURPHY: Laurie Oakes, a question for Bob Hawke.<br />
OAKES: Prime Minister, a Sunday newspaper today asked<br />
residents of a Sydney street what they thought you should<br />
be asked and one of the questions they threw up was why<br />
are you allowing our country to be sold out to the<br />
Japanese? Now, if you eliminate these racial overtones,<br />
that's a question I've heard from a lot of Australians.<br />
What's your answer?<br />
PM: Well, of course, we are not. And the fact is that<br />
we have a Foreign Investment Review Board whose task is<br />
to recommend whether any takeovers or acquisitions of<br />
Australian assets are against the national interest and<br />
we take account of the advice of that body. Australia<br />
does need investment from abroad. We must have some<br />
mechanism for taking account of whether it's in the<br />
Australian interest or not and we are in a situation<br />
where, in regard to many sectors of our economy now, we<br />
have been strengthened because we've brought in<br />
expertise, technology, equipment, know-how, which is<br />
associated with investment from overseas. But we have<br />
kept a mechanism in the Foreign Investment Review Board<br />
to oversee that investment.<br />
MURPHY: Do you have a follow up?<br />
OAKES: No that's fine.<br />
MURPHY: OK, well Alan Ramsey now questions Andrew<br />
Peacock. RAMSEY: Mr Peacock, your proposal to abolish the capital<br />
gains tax. That tax this year will bring in $ 500<br />
million. It is a tax paid by one percent of Australian<br />
taxpayers. You intend in abolishing the, in the,<br />
abolishing capital gains to make it retrospective to<br />
1985. Now how do you justify backdating, abolition of a<br />
policy that gives a five year windfall of $ 450 million to<br />
one percent of Australian taxpayers, one percent?<br />
PEACOCK: Look I think, Alan, you're suffering a bit of<br />
selective amnesia and caught it from the Prime<br />
Minister. </p>
<p>RAMSEY: No I'm not one percent of taxpayers.<br />
PEACOCK: The reality is, I've said to you, that of those<br />
men and women, those small businesses that are copping it<br />
in the neck, 80 percent of the men and women paying<br />
capital gains tax earn $ 35,000 or less<br />
RAMSEY: Mr Peacock, that's distortion.<br />
PEACOCK: Now you can, you can in fact, describe them<br />
as millionaires, but you'll be laughed out<br />
RAMSEY: I didn't describe them as millionaires.<br />
PEACOCK: And the second point about it is why backdate<br />
to ' 85. In fact it's from ' 85 to the date of our<br />
election to office. The reason for that is obvious.<br />
Otherwise you'll have three categories of people. You'll<br />
have those who purchased an asset before that date in<br />
1985, you'll secondly have the people who purchased<br />
assets between ' 85 and our election to Government, then<br />
you'll have a third category thereafter. Now we've<br />
already got a bag of snakes in the income tax and other<br />
tax acts now. The classic way to make it worse would be<br />
to follow your lead.<br />
MURPHY: Follow up?<br />
RAMSEY: Yes, indeed. Mr Peacock, you never, you always<br />
opposed retrospective tax penalties. Why are you giving<br />
a $ 500 million windfall gain to one percent, one percent,<br />
of Australian taxpayers by backdating this particular<br />
policy? PEACOCK: I've just told you, administratively you'd have<br />
three classes of people and that<br />
RAMSEY: Are you saying simple?<br />
PEACOCK: RAMSEY: What is simple about, I mean, what is difficult,<br />
what is difficult about applying the policy the day after<br />
you're elected?<br />
MURPHY: OK, now the answer.<br />
PEACOCK: I have the utmost respect for you, but I would<br />
prefer you to allow me to answer the question.<br />
RAMSEY: You're avoiding the question.<br />
MURPHY: Please<br />
PEACOCK: I was about to answer it-<br />
RAMSEY: You're avoiding it </p>
<p>MURPHY: Go ahead, please go ahead.<br />
PEACOCK: My time starts now?<br />
MURPHY: Yes it does.<br />
PEACOCK: OK, fine. The reality is not only are the men<br />
and women who are paying capital gains tax, earning only<br />
$ 35,000<br />
RAMSEY: That is not true, Mr Peacock.<br />
MURPHY: Please, please, Alan, let Mr Peacock<br />
PEACOCK: If you have a look at the latest figures<br />
available RAMSEY: I have.<br />
PEACOCK: Well, you will find that in fact of the<br />
companies that paid capital gains tax, 65 percent of them<br />
only had a corporate profit of $ 40,000. Now it seems to<br />
me if you want to return incentive in this country,<br />
you'll look at those figures and you'll recognise what<br />
they're doing to small business.<br />
MURPHY: Ok, I must intervene here. We must move on<br />
because we've got three topics. We move into the second<br />
of them now and it's social policy. I'd ask Bob Hawke to<br />
speak first.<br />
PM: When I talk about social policy and social Justice I<br />
look first of all at kids. I look at the fact that now,<br />
after seven years as Prime Minister, I can go into the<br />
schools of Australia and see that two out of every three<br />
of our kids are staying on in school against the one in<br />
three at the end of the seven years of conservative<br />
government. That means that what we're doing for the<br />
families of today is we're training and educating the<br />
kids of today's families, and importantly training and<br />
educating the parents of tomorrow's families.<br />
When I talk about social policy and social justice I look<br />
at health and I see all of my fellow Australians now<br />
covered by Medicare and with bulkbilling available. I<br />
don't see the two million Australians that I inherited in<br />
' 83 who had no cover. And I see an Opposition pledge to<br />
abolish Medicare.<br />
I see social justice when I see kids and adults going to<br />
programs like Skillshare and our whole range of other<br />
training programs that mean that people with some<br />
disabilities or backwardness are able to be trained to go<br />
into the employment market. our opponents would abolish<br />
all these programs. What they would do was to substitute<br />
for a social safety welfare net a social trapdoor. Push </p>
<p>the people through the trapdoor and then do nothing more<br />
for them.<br />
I see social justice in regard to our kids where every<br />
major social welfare organisation has congratulated me<br />
and the Government for now paying over two billion<br />
dollars a year to the kids of low income families. They<br />
have said, they have said that that's matched the promise<br />
to ensure that there be no financial need for a kid to<br />
live in poverty. That two billion dollars has been paid<br />
to meet that promise.<br />
I see social justice in a fair taxation system. The sort<br />
of thing that Alan Ramsey's been talking about. I see<br />
social injustice in giving, over a period of time as they<br />
would, literally billions of dollars to less than one per<br />
cent of the population. In the last year ' 87-88, 65,000<br />
people, one third of one per cent, paid capital gains.<br />
But will put billions of dollars back to them, billions<br />
of dollars that could've been spent on health and<br />
education and the welfare of the needy.<br />
These are the things that are important. I don't want to<br />
see an Australia where we're going to have a pattern of<br />
privilege returned. Where superannuation is the preserve<br />
of the few instead of for the blue collar workers and for<br />
women as we have made it. It's these things, it's<br />
education, it's health, where we have done the things<br />
that need to be done. And through all this, despite what<br />
Mr Peacock has said, the independent analysis shows that<br />
average standards have also increased by over six per<br />
cent in the period we've been in office. That's what<br />
social justice is about.<br />
MURPHY: Ok, thank you Mr Hawke. Now three minutes from<br />
Andrew Peacock.<br />
PEACOCK: Well Mr Murphy I actually think, listening to<br />
what the Prime Minister has just said, that we may have<br />
all been fools. It must be Max Gillies in here. This is<br />
not Australia today that he is discussing.<br />
Let me just say firstly we are not going to abolish<br />
Medicare. Secondly we are not going to abolish all<br />
training programs. And thirdly, if you want to know who's<br />
close to the privileged, have a look at the man over<br />
here. Because during his time as Prime Minister of this<br />
country Australia has become an unfair society. Unfair<br />
to the great bulk of men and women, particularly working<br />
men and women. The rich have got richer, the poor have<br />
got poorer, and the great bulk of Australians have not<br />
only just been squeezed out, they've been forgotten by Mr<br />
Hawke. The focus of social policy ought to be firstly the<br />
family, secondly our children and thirdly the elderly.<br />
I've said what I'll do for the family with child tax<br />
rebates, child care rebates, assistance for spouses </p>
<p>through a lift in the dependent spouse rebate. And as<br />
for our children, now I mentioned before a-. broken promise<br />
indicated three times in the 1987 policy speech by Mr<br />
Hawke. And if I may say the most debased promise of all<br />
was that one that said no child will live in poverty by<br />
1990. Well it's 1990 and 500,000 children live in<br />
poverty and 70,000 are homeless. So much for the<br />
undertakings that are made by Mr Hawke in his election<br />
speech. We're on about keeping families together. That<br />
will assist this particular problem. We're on about<br />
working with those great welfare groups in the community<br />
to work with government to solve this problem. Mr Hawke<br />
will not.<br />
In regard to the elderly to whom we have the most special<br />
duty of all, and particularly the current generation,<br />
some of whom went through a First World War, some of<br />
course a Second World War, and including between that<br />
the Depression, the duty is even more profound than at<br />
any other time. We are going to maintain, I say to the<br />
elderly, every program that is down at the moment,<br />
including Medicare. And we're going to liberalise the<br />
assets test. And we're going to end the compulsory<br />
retiring age. And we're going to have a deferred pension<br />
plan. And we're going to lift the tax free threshold on<br />
lump sum superannuation from $ 60,000 to $ 125,000.<br />
The guiding principle of social policy is to be fair.<br />
You've seen what's been enacted out over the last three<br />
years. Well we'll be fair while they talk.<br />
MURPHY: Ok, we now again come to the section where the<br />
leaders question each other. First question to you Mr<br />
Hawke. PM: Do you agree with the statement of your Shadow<br />
Minister for Health, Mr Shack, where he said that the<br />
Liberals and National Party have a very poor track record<br />
in health both in government, in opposition? Do you<br />
agree with his statement and why was he right?<br />
PEACOCK: Well, if I agreed with the statement I'd have<br />
to make it relative and compare it with your record. The<br />
reality is there is now a Medicare crisis with 100,000<br />
people unable to get into public hospitals. The only way<br />
to redress that is to correct the imbalance between<br />
public hospitals and private hospitals. Before you<br />
brought in Medicare more than 62% of the population was<br />
covered by private insurance. That's fallen to 42,000<br />
today. And as a consequence the queues have grown and<br />
grown. We're going to leave Medicare in place, not only<br />
just for the disabled and the aged and the poor, but<br />
we're going to make it attractive to get into voluntary<br />
insurance by not requiring those who take out a premium<br />
with a voluntary health insurance society, not only will<br />
they not have to pay the Medicare levy but they in fact<br />
will get a tax rebate. So I'll stack up our record any<br />
time you like with yours. </p>
<p>MURPHY: Do you have a follow-up?<br />
PM: Why did you say on the 23rd of June last year<br />
through your spokesman that the policy had been finalised<br />
and the costing completed when in fact that wasn't the<br />
case? Why did you keep saying that?<br />
PEACOCK: Because the costing had been completed. But<br />
then we got further material from you which had not been<br />
made available before.<br />
PM: ( inaudible)<br />
PEACOCK: Well, that was the situation as it was. I mean<br />
I openly said, when you eventually made the material<br />
available in terms of the numbers in State hospitals, we<br />
realised that we could make the change I've just<br />
described to freeing that system up somewhat, but we<br />
would have to do it in the second and third year and not<br />
in the first.<br />
PM: Will it be cost neutral?<br />
PM: I told you about the costing itself before and you<br />
know that in determining that no-one in fact will pay<br />
more because any changes that we make in the system will<br />
have an offset through the tax mechanism.<br />
MURPHY: Ok, time has expired. It's your turn now Mr<br />
Peacock to put a question.<br />
PEACOCK: Well once again I want to go back to that<br />
graphic 1987 policy speech of yours. You said that your<br />
Government, and I'll quote it, sets the welfare of the<br />
Australian family as it's top priority. In fact the<br />
living standards of most Australian families have been<br />
savaged since then. Why?<br />
PM: Of course that's not true. If you look at the<br />
research that's been done by the independent University<br />
of NSW Institute of Social Studies you'll see that what<br />
they say is on average real standards have increased.<br />
Because when you ' re measuring real living standards,<br />
disposable income is made up not only of what happens to<br />
real wages, it's made up also of whether there are more<br />
jobs, whether there's been a cut in taxes, and what's<br />
happened to the level of social welfare payments. When<br />
you take these all into account there has been an<br />
increase in standards. So your basic premise is wrong.<br />
If you want your people afterwards to see the statistics<br />
and the basis of my statement, that will be provided to<br />
you and to any journalist that wants to see it.<br />
MURPHY: A follow-up? </p>
<p>PEACOCK: Well I'm going to rest with that. I mean you<br />
know that is no answer to the question. But I'll let<br />
other people judge that. Have I got a question now?<br />
MURPHY: Sorry?<br />
PEACOCK: Have I got another question now?<br />
MURPHY: A follow-up. Do you have one?<br />
PEACOCK: No, no a separate question. Do you want a<br />
separate question or not?<br />
MURPHY: It's a follow-up which means that there's a<br />
thirty second<br />
PEACOCK: I wouldn't be bothered with that after that<br />
answer. MURPHY: Ok. Well we now go to panel questions. First<br />
it's Paul Kelly with a question to Mr Peacock.<br />
KELLY: Mr Peacock I think you'd agree that when you<br />
mention social justice to Australian families these days,<br />
they think interest rates. Every banker and economist in<br />
this country knows that we need higher interest rates<br />
than countries overseas in order to finance our overseas<br />
debt problem. Now you've been going around the country<br />
saying that under your government there can be massive<br />
falls in interest rates. How do you reconcile that<br />
promise with the interest rate differential which we need<br />
to finance the foreign debt?<br />
PEACOCK: Firstly what I'd say to you is that we do not<br />
need interest rates as high as they are. They have in<br />
fact been hitting record levels. There are two reasons<br />
for the this. Two reasons. Firstly the impact of the<br />
Government's tight money supplies which have forced those<br />
interest rates up. Secondly because this Government<br />
doesn't have anti-inflationary policies. So long as they<br />
continue to allow inflation to be stuck at a high rate<br />
then interest rates will remain high. Now I'm on about<br />
getting them down. The reality is all my programs in the<br />
economics field are directed towards not only listing<br />
productivity but they're having a drive on inflation.<br />
But as a consequence of the success of that, through<br />
tighter fiscal policy and freeing up the labour market,<br />
when I'm able to have that steadier monetary policy, I'll<br />
get inflation down and I'll get interest rates down.<br />
KELLY: You're talking about massive cuts. I mean how<br />
can you say massive cuts? I mean you don't know what's<br />
going to happen to interest rates overseas.<br />
PEACOCK: I do know what the effect of my program<br />
KELLY: Are you standing by massive cuts or are you </p>
<p>PEACOCK: Mr Kelly, I know that from day one when I'm<br />
elected on September the, on March the 24th that on the<br />
I will make a statement as Prime Minister<br />
reiterating the programs of the new government. The<br />
market will see clearly because government's don't set<br />
interest rates, you know that the market will see<br />
clearly that I'm embarking on the tough anti-inflation<br />
drive that I've spoken of.<br />
KELLY: Isn't<br />
PEACOCK: That'll give real relief in interest rates to<br />
families that they are desperate for. I'm confident that<br />
the market will respond and that through our period of<br />
government you will have sustained and significant<br />
reductions in interest rates.<br />
KELLY: You'd agree therefore would you that you went too<br />
far promising massive cuts?<br />
PEACOCK: I'm telling you we will get significant<br />
interest rate cuts through the first term of our<br />
government because our policies are right and we're not<br />
relying on high interest rates to conduct the Australian<br />
economy.<br />
MURPHY: Alan Ramsey, it's now your turn to put a<br />
question to Mr Hawke.<br />
RAMSEY: Prime Minister, welfare payments of course are<br />
eroded if you can't get inflation down and you can't get<br />
interest rates right. Now in four of the last six<br />
budgets the Treasurer, and you were talking before to Mr<br />
Peacock about targets, the Treasurer didn't meet his<br />
targets on inflation. He said it would come down and in<br />
fact in each of those four occasions it went up. We're<br />
still waiting judgement on his most recent budget. Your<br />
own forecast on interest rates last year were hopelessly<br />
wrong. Now given what you said on interest rates, and<br />
given what he said for five years about inflation, why<br />
should voters now believe that you now know what you're<br />
talking about or what you're doing?<br />
PM: Fair question Alan. They have to make a choice<br />
between Mr Peacock and myself. The central question in<br />
interest rate levels, as everyone knows, is the inflation<br />
level. And the central determinant of what happens to<br />
inflation is what happens to wage rates. You people were<br />
at the press conference on the 30th of November when you<br />
put the question to Mr Peacock about wages outcomes.<br />
RAMSEY: But that's not what I'm asking you.<br />
PM: Let me answer<br />
RAMSEY: people believe you now when you've been so<br />
wrong in the past? </p>
<p>PM: Could I answer the question. What I'm saying is<br />
there's got to be a choice. And I'm saying that we will<br />
have lower wages outcomes. Lower wages outcomes and<br />
therefore a greater capacity to bring inflation and<br />
interest rates down. In regard to the wages predictions,<br />
let me remind you of this, and again we'll show all the<br />
statistics afterwards, that over the whole period of<br />
wages predictions by the Treasurer, on average his<br />
prediction has been over what the wages outcome can be.<br />
So we are more reliable in terms of the basic determinant<br />
of interest rates, that is what happens to wages, than<br />
the alternative.<br />
MURPHY: Ok, now Laurie Oakes to Andrew Peacock.<br />
OAKES: Mr Peacock you go into this election campaign<br />
with no health policy even though health is very<br />
important to Australians, Medicare is very important to<br />
Australians. Your figures didn't add up. You're going<br />
into the campaign saying trust us even though we won't<br />
tell you what we're going to do with health, we won't<br />
tell you how we're going to pay for it. Why should<br />
people trust you?<br />
PEACOCK: The reality is we're going into the election<br />
campaign with a health policy. What we said was that we<br />
could not implement it in the first year. I'd love to be<br />
able to correct every mistake that Labor has made on the<br />
first day and in the first year. But there are<br />
restrictions on even those who have got well thought<br />
through programs. And that health policy is, to be<br />
implemented in the second and third year, to leave<br />
Medicare in place for the aged and the disadvantaged and<br />
the poor, and to encourage people either to cross to the<br />
private health funds for which, if they take out a<br />
premium there they will not have to pay the Medicare levy<br />
and they will in fact get a tax rebate. That rebate will<br />
be skewered down to the lower end to be of more<br />
significance to lower income earners than middle income<br />
earners. I'm very happy with that.<br />
OAKES: ( inaudible)<br />
PEACOCK: We do, because we will in fact be ensuring, as<br />
I said, that any changes that are made in the health<br />
policy will not cost individuals more. Because whatever<br />
the change we make in terms of health per se of the<br />
arrangements will in fact be offset then through the tax<br />
mechanism which is what I mean by<br />
OAKES: But your health spokesman said it would cost tax<br />
payers anywhere between zero and $ 2.6 billion. That's<br />
ridiculous PEACOCK: The only relevance of $ 2.6 billion Mr Oakes<br />
would be<br />
OAKES: That's Mr Shack's figure, not mine. </p>
<p>PEACOCK: would be if everybody went off Medicare.<br />
Well they won't. $ 2.6 billion is the amount the<br />
Government receives in terms of revenue from the Medicare<br />
levy. It's not relevant to what I'm talking about.<br />
MURPHY: Thank you Mr Peacock. We now must move on to<br />
our next topic in the great debate. Each Leader has two<br />
minutes to speak on the environment and Mr Peacock leads<br />
off. PEACOCK: Well thank you very much, Paul. The guiding<br />
dictum that we apply to the environment and it's fairly<br />
simple and it's spelled out in our policy is that the<br />
environment is not something that we've inherited from<br />
our parents but rather something that we borrowed from<br />
our children. And an effective environment policy must<br />
be aimed at targeting and increasing our quality of life.<br />
Now the Labor Party place great stress on what they've<br />
allegedly done for the environment. We're always seeing<br />
either Mr Hawke or Senator Richardson stomping all over<br />
the flora and frightening the life out of the fauna as<br />
they're being photographed majestically. But the reality<br />
is if you look at our record, we established the first<br />
federal Ministry of the Environment. We ended whaling,<br />
we proclaimed the Kakadu, Uluru, and Great Barrier Reef<br />
marines parks, we have a record in the environment<br />
extending through to the saving of Fraser Island from<br />
sandmining and that will continue.<br />
Incidentally, I'm proud to say that, albeit for a short<br />
time, I held the portfolio of Ministry for the<br />
Environment. And I've ensured that we have committed<br />
ourselves to sensible and sensitive environmental<br />
policies not just for Australia, but for the planet.<br />
For Australia we're committed to sensible and well<br />
planned policies for reaf forestation. No world heritage<br />
area will be de-listed or degraded. We will protect the<br />
Antarctic. In fact, we were the first to take the<br />
decision to oppose the mineral regime in the Antarctic<br />
while two Ministers, Senators Richardson and Evans, were<br />
proclaiming the need to mine in the Antarctic. Ours is,<br />
as I say, a sensitive and a sensible environment program.<br />
It calls for sustainable development, it sits well with<br />
achieving what we need in Australia, a sensitive<br />
environment program for quality of life and sensible<br />
economic policy to improve our living standards.<br />
MURPHY: Thank you Mr Peacock. Now two minutes for Mr<br />
Hawke to address the environment.<br />
PM: Thank you. It could not be a greater gulf between<br />
myself and Mr Peacock on the question of the environment.<br />
Let me first refer to his claims about what they did. </p>
<p>The point about that is that everyone of those decisions<br />
that they made in government, they did with our support,<br />
with the support of the Labor Party. But since I've been<br />
Prime Minister every major decision we've made in terms<br />
of protection of the environment has been bitterly<br />
opposed by our opponents. If I were not Prime Minister,<br />
if Mr Peacock had been Prime Minister the Franklin would<br />
not be running free. Daintree would be logged. Kakadu<br />
would be mined and there would be authorisation for the<br />
Wesley Vale Pulp Mill to be pumping out 13 tonnes of<br />
organochlorides each day into Bass Strait. The decision,<br />
that latter one, opposed by Peacock. All the other<br />
decisions opposed by the conservatives. So there is the<br />
gulf, there is the gulf between us.<br />
In terms of our global responsibilities, we are out there<br />
at the forefront with other nations in doing what we can<br />
within Australia and by way of international cooperation<br />
to combat the effect of the Greenhouse emissions. We<br />
are, with France, proudly taking a lead. Not just<br />
talking but proudly taking the lead in ensuring that the<br />
Antarctic is going to be free from mining and kept as a<br />
great nature and science reserve, and we are being<br />
applauded worldwide for that.<br />
And in regard to protecting the soil, we instituted last<br />
year a $ 320M landcare decade program which is going to<br />
tackle the problems of salinity and soil degradation.<br />
So in all these areas we have not talked, we've acted and<br />
on every major decision that we've taken, we've been<br />
opposed by the Liberals and the National Party.<br />
MURPHY: Thank you Mr Hawke. Now, of course, the Leaders<br />
question each other and Andrew Peacock you lead off.<br />
PEACOCK: Well the harsh reality is, Mr Hawke, you were<br />
dragged reluctantly to oppose the minerals regime in the<br />
Antarctic. Is it not a fact that we opposed that and<br />
took the decision before you and that your Ministers were<br />
proclaiming a need to mine the Antarctic and only changed<br />
their minds after we issued a policy directive?<br />
PM: You had no impact upon us at all. This was<br />
something that had been considered by a range of our<br />
Ministers. It is the case that some of them wanted to go<br />
on with the signing of the mineral convention because<br />
they took the view that that was the only way, they<br />
thought, which could provide some environmental<br />
protection. I took a different view and I was persuaded,<br />
and persuaded my Cabinet, that what we should do would be<br />
bold and go out and say no, no mining, that it is silly<br />
to talk about protecting the Antarctic environment<br />
through the medium of a minerals convention. We were<br />
told that we wouldn't be able to get anywhere but now<br />
we've got the Russians, many of the Europeans, New<br />
Zealand, I think, is reconsidering it's position, the<br />
United States is reconsidering it's position. As in so </p>
<p>many areas of international affairs, Australia, the<br />
Australian Government, is taking the lead on this.<br />
MURPHY: Do you want a supplementary, Mr Peacock?<br />
PEACOCK: No. The reality is Mr Hawke has admitted that<br />
in fact the Government was torn on the question. It took<br />
them quite some time and that we were the first in to ban<br />
it.<br />
MURPHY: Mr Hawke, you now question.<br />
PM: Yes. I wanted to ask the Leader of the Opposition<br />
how can he support a position where his Shadow spokesman<br />
for the Environment, Senator Puplick, has said that you<br />
would allow mineral exploration of the Kakadu National<br />
Park, including the area where Crocodile Dundee was<br />
filmed. How can you possibly contemplate endangering the<br />
Kakadu National Park in that way?<br />
PEACOCK: No. Stage 1 and Stage 2 in Kakadu will not be<br />
mined and we've made that perfectly clear. Just as you<br />
were prepared until you buckled yet again under the<br />
pressure in terms of Stage 3 we would allow the<br />
examination of the possibility of mining in Stage 3, in<br />
fact the company had an environmental impact statement<br />
which said that Coronation Hill, you could proceed. Now<br />
the reality is if you place-any faith in those<br />
environmental impact statements and they say that it's<br />
not endangered, then you ought be prepared to proceed.<br />
There will be no mining in Stage 1 or Stage 2.<br />
MURPHY: A supplementary?<br />
PM: I mean, why is it that in October of last year<br />
Senator Puplick, your Shadow Minister, indicated that<br />
they would allow mineral exploration via the Bureau of<br />
Mineral Resources in Stage 2. Why did he say it? Did he<br />
not have your authority?<br />
PEACOCK: No, Senator Puplick said, as has the Party,<br />
that there will not be mining in Stage 1<br />
PM: Well we'll show you<br />
PEACOCK: That we would be prepared to look, as you were,<br />
in terms of Stage 3 and there we've been decisive. And<br />
as with value added industries elsewhere, we are prepared<br />
because of the need for Australia to have valued added<br />
industries, to examine the possibility of the proceedings<br />
and if the environmental impact statement says they can<br />
proceed without damage, then they will proceed.<br />
MURPHY: Now do you want to ask another question on the<br />
environment? PEACOCK: Oh no, I thought we were going on to the panel<br />
now. </p>
<p>MURPHY: Well I'm just giving you another chance.<br />
PEACOCK: No, that's fine with me.<br />
MURPHY: Right. Another question Prime Minister?<br />
PM: Yes. Why, Mr Peacock, when we had advice from the<br />
CSIRO that there would be 13 tonnes per day of<br />
organochlorides pumped into Bass Strait by the Wesley<br />
Vale project and they recommended against it why were<br />
you in favour of it? Why did you criticise our decision<br />
to stop the Wesley Vale project on the advice of CSIRO?<br />
PEACOCK: There are two things I want to say about Wesley<br />
Vale. Firstly, it took you an interminable time to make<br />
a decision. Secondly, you've said earlier tonight that<br />
there are $ 90B worth of investment programs to go ahead<br />
and you quoted Access Economics I just happen to have<br />
it here.<br />
PM: You have a lot of things there, Andrew.<br />
PEACOCK: Contained well they're notes of your failed<br />
promises over the last 7 years, and there are a fair<br />
number of them. Contained within that, that you've been<br />
hotly pressing and advocating about $ 90M that you've put<br />
in the program, contained in this is the Wesley Vale Pulp<br />
Mill in Tasmania for $ 1B. Now you can't talk in favour<br />
of these programs which contain, in fact, a preparedness<br />
to proceed at Wesley Vale and then use the other side of<br />
the argument now. The fact is if it could be done in an<br />
environmentally sound way, we said then that it should<br />
proceed. And that's the reality of the question.<br />
MURPHY: A quick supplementary?<br />
PM: Well the CSIRO said it couldn't been done in an<br />
environmentally sound way. Why did you therefore support<br />
it? PM: My God, you are like a human hiccup on that one.<br />
You are all over the place. It took you a long time, and<br />
your own Ministers have said and it's being re-examined<br />
again as you know and what I'm saying to you, if it can<br />
be developed on environmentally sound basis, it will<br />
proceed and that's what your Minister says.<br />
MURPHY: OK. We move on now to the panel. To pose<br />
questions to both Leaders on the environment and indeed<br />
anything else that they want to ask and the first<br />
question comes from Warwick Beutler.<br />
BEUTLER: Mr Peacock, another specific question about the<br />
environment. What is your solution to land degradation<br />
and salinity?<br />
PEACOCK: Well the land degradation and salinity problems </p>
<p>of Australia are the most crucial problems that we face<br />
environmentally. There are high profile problems<br />
elsewhere which can attract an enormous amount of<br />
support. In fact, we will double the funding for the<br />
national conservation strategy and we've made that<br />
perfectly clear. And this real drive has to be on land<br />
degradation and salinity. The National Farmers<br />
Federation has supported with the Australian Conservation<br />
Foundation this approach. It has our full support. In<br />
fact, I think apart from our commitment to more than<br />
doubled expenditure in this arena, it's one of the<br />
welcome signs in Australian politics that the Party's are<br />
moving increasingly close to recognising the need to move<br />
in this arena.<br />
BEUTLER: What's the doubling of spending mean? How much<br />
are you spending on it?<br />
PEACOCK: Well you take out the forward estimates by the<br />
Government and multiply it by two, old son. I haven't<br />
got those instruments with me.<br />
MURPHY: OK. Laurie Oakes to Mr Hawke.<br />
OAKES: Mr Hawke, is the Labor Party prepared to match<br />
the coalition's commitment to spend SiB next year on<br />
child care and before you answer it, could I say that<br />
since you insisted the debate had to be before the policy<br />
speech as I hope you won't fob me off by saying I'll<br />
have to wait till I hear your policies?<br />
PM: Well it's not a question of fobbing you off. I can<br />
say to you that in fact during the campaign I'll be<br />
making announcements which indicate further moves,<br />
substantial moves, on our part in regard to child care.<br />
But let me say this. I do that from a position of<br />
strength because under my Government, when this current<br />
program of child care place increases which finishes in<br />
1992 is in place there will have been a trebling, a<br />
trebling by us of the number of child care places that we<br />
inherited from the Opposition. But we're not resting on<br />
our laurels, Laurie. We in fact, will be doing more and<br />
in terms of being available for question, when I've made<br />
my announcement during a campaign, I will be available as<br />
I am each day for detailed questioning by you.<br />
OAKES: But if I could repeat the question. Is the Labor<br />
Party prepared to match the coalition's billion dollar<br />
promise on child care?<br />
PM: I will answer that by saying I will be making<br />
OAKES: You fobbed me off.<br />
PM: No I haven't. I've said I'll be making my statement<br />
and I'll be available when the day I make that<br />
announcement, Laurie, you be there and ask me any<br />
questions you like. </p>
<p>OAKES: Well if you're so inhibited, why did you insist<br />
the debate had to be now instead of after the policies,<br />
Mr Hawke?<br />
PM: No inhibition at all. It seemed to me a good idea<br />
to have it now, get it out of the way and get on with the<br />
real business.<br />
OAKES: still things we can't talk about.<br />
PM: Not at all. I'll be available to you every day. I<br />
don't know whether Mr Peacock will be.<br />
MURPHY: We must move on now. Paul Kelly with a question<br />
for Mr Peacock.<br />
KELLY: Mr Peacock, I think a lot of people would like to<br />
know how serious you are about fighting inflation, which<br />
is the cornerstone of your economic strategy. Now the<br />
lesson of the 80s in countries like Britain and the<br />
United States is in order to fight inflation there's<br />
normally a cost. The cost can be higher unemployment or<br />
cuts in real wages. Now are you prepared to fight<br />
inflation to the extent that you might countenance either<br />
of those?<br />
PEACOCK: No, because by the mechanism that we're using<br />
in fighting inflation we will in fact lift employment.<br />
Because we'vye got to end this nexus between inflation and<br />
wage rises and cost rises, prices just passing it on. To<br />
the extent that you lift wages solely in line with<br />
inflation and without regard to productivity, that in<br />
fact workers just get diminished real wages.<br />
KELLY: So you are not prepared to achieve your inflation<br />
objectives if the cost of those objectives is either cuts<br />
in real wages or a higher level of unemployment. Is that<br />
the real situation?<br />
PEACOCK: The reality is<br />
KELLY: Is that the real situation or not?<br />
PEACOCK: Listen Mr Kelly, just listen to me. That's a<br />
fundamental point that I make because you're talking<br />
about unemployment rising in one feature of an antiinflation<br />
policy. What I've said to you earlier tonight<br />
is that we in fact have a coordinated economic strategy<br />
that doesn't rely on one element alone like this<br />
Government does in terms of controlling demand and using<br />
high interest rates.<br />
KELLY: I'm just talking about price that other countries<br />
have had to pay during the 1980s.<br />
PEACOCK: You are very agitated in making your point but<br />
I thought I was being asked the question, my dear friend. </p>
<p>The reality is our program is a coordinated one. It is a<br />
tighter fiscal policy, it is freeing up the labour<br />
market. With those settings in place it means we can<br />
have that steadier monetary policy to get inflation down<br />
and we will boost productivity not only through our wages<br />
policy but also through privatisation and contracting<br />
out. So we have a coordinated program which will tackle<br />
inflation, bring down interest rates as a consequence and<br />
boost productivity thus ensuring greater take home pay.<br />
MURPHY: Alan Ramsey, would you like to put a question to<br />
Mr Hawke.<br />
RAMSEY: Yes Prime Minister, I want to go back to the<br />
question I asked you last time about inflation and<br />
interest rate forecasts. I remind you that two budgets<br />
ago, which is only 18 months ago, the ' 88 budget, Paul<br />
Keating said inflation would be coming down to three or<br />
four per cent, three to four per cent by 1990. Well<br />
we've arrived at 1990. Inflation is just on eight per<br />
cent, 1 ask you again, why should voters now<br />
believe that you know what you're talking about?<br />
PM: Because we have been honest in saying that we<br />
underestimated the level of demand. We were absolutely<br />
right, as we have been each year, in our wages estimate<br />
Alan. But we frankly underestimated the level of demand,<br />
as did every other economist in the country. So now come<br />
to the present. The present situation is one in which<br />
the inflation rate will be coming down, the Treasury has<br />
said, at the end of the year, end of last year, that the<br />
underlying rate was There is a lessening of<br />
demand, there is a lessening of demand. No-one questions<br />
that. And the banking sector itself has said that<br />
interest rates are coming down. So we have been frank in<br />
saying yes we did underestimate demand and in that<br />
underestimate of demand inflation was higher than we<br />
expected. We've got an $ 11 billion surge, or more than<br />
an $ 11 billion surge of income, from the improvement in<br />
the terms of trade and that money surged into the country<br />
and lifted demand. We believe that in the current<br />
circumstances as does the banking sector that we've<br />
got the settings right for a lowering of both inflation<br />
and interest rates.<br />
MURPHY: Do you want to follow up Alan?<br />
RAMSEY: No.<br />
MURPHY: Warwick Beutler, have you a question for Mr<br />
Hawke? BEUTLER: For Mr Peacock actually. Mr Peacock do you<br />
rule out a consumption tax under your Government?<br />
PEACOCK: I've indicated quite clearly that in the<br />
program for the first term of our government, which is<br />
what we're offering the Australian people, there will be </p>
<p>no consumption tax. That's contained explicitly in our<br />
policy document. Now Mr Hawke may have a different view<br />
and he may dump a new tax on us if he wishes. The<br />
reality is however that those who call for a consumption<br />
tax can argue quite plausibly in terms of it increasing<br />
our savings. But I do have to say to them the reality is<br />
it can have the appearance of this juncture of a<br />
palliative unless you start cutting government<br />
expenditure. We've taken the tough decisions. We're<br />
taking the dole for example back to nine months and<br />
saying to people if you've got the capacity to work then<br />
you've got to work. Australia is the only country in the<br />
world where you can leave school, go on the dole and stay<br />
there until you draw the pension. So tighter fiscal<br />
policy again, freeing up the labour market. We will in<br />
fact be able to get inflation and interest rates down and<br />
that's the route to go before you contemplate any<br />
consumption tax.<br />
MURPHY: Mr Peacock, is Mr Elliott wrong when he says,<br />
your Federal President, that he'd like to see a<br />
consumption tax?<br />
PEACOCK: He's long had the view in favour of a<br />
consumption tax but he's been told by us that it's not<br />
on. BEUTLER: He also has views about the removal of tariffs<br />
and tax breaks on savings and things like that. Is it<br />
time to start implementing those, some of those sorts of<br />
PEACOCK: Which ones are you talking about, tell me.<br />
What do you want?<br />
BEUTLER: Well, ways of getting us out of our debt<br />
problem for example. Removal of all tariffs.<br />
PEACOCK: Well I've told you first of all the best way of<br />
working the way through our debt problem is for Australia<br />
to become productive again. That's not only<br />
BEUTLER: We've all got to work harder.<br />
PEACOCK: Hang on a flash. That's not only in<br />
Australia's interest that we're able to compete in the<br />
export market and compete against the import placement<br />
industries. But it's pretty important, critically<br />
important for Australians own well-being, and to lift<br />
their own living standards. In terms of tariffs, then I<br />
want a liberal trading world. Mr Hawke wants a liberal<br />
trading world. The Garnaut Report puts a target of the<br />
year 2000 for example, for the elimination of all<br />
tariffs. I think it's a pretty heroic gesture. I don't<br />
think we would in fact be able to achieve it but it's a<br />
fine ideal to work to provided you give those industries<br />
out there in the market place some certainty as to what </p>
<p>you're doing as you work to that more liberal trading<br />
world. MURPHY: Thanks for that. Paul Kelly have you got a<br />
question for Mr Hawke.<br />
KELLY: Yes. Just a few days ago Mr Hawke, the<br />
Treasurer, Mr Keating, attacked most of the employer<br />
groups and branded them in fact, as Liberal Party fronts.<br />
Do you agree with Mr Keating on that and does this mean<br />
that there's now a new degree of tension in the<br />
relationship between your Government and the business<br />
community? PM: I would say that it is accurate to say that in the<br />
last few weeks the noises that have been coming from the<br />
major business organisations have been fairly pro-<br />
Liberal. But that doesn't lead into logically the second<br />
point. I don't believe that when we're re-elected that<br />
there will be tensions between us. We will have a<br />
capacity, as we have in the past, to talk and work with<br />
the Business Council, with the Confederation of<br />
Australian Industry. We've done that for 7 years and may<br />
I say, that they have been very cooperative in many ways,<br />
not least in one important area which I was involved in<br />
this week, women. One of the great performances of this<br />
Government is the opening up of opportunities for women<br />
in employment, to remove discrimination and I pay full<br />
tribute to the cooperation that we've had from the<br />
Confederation of Australian Industry and the Business<br />
Council of Australia in perhaps what is the most<br />
fundamental micro economic reform, making sure that<br />
of the population are available to be trained and to be<br />
employed. MURPHY: OK, time is galloping on, Laurie Oakes.<br />
OAKES: Mr Peacock, the coalition government has pledged<br />
to flog off a string of Government owned enterprises<br />
ranging from Qantas to Medibank Private. Your<br />
privatisation spokesman, John Moore, is quoted in a<br />
business magazine this week as saying professionals in<br />
Australia are really looking at the greatest Christmas<br />
party they've ever had. Now is that the way to present<br />
this? Why should Australians vote to enrich accountants,<br />
lawyers and stock brokers?<br />
PEACOCK: Well he may have been using a touch of<br />
hyperbole to get your interest, to raise the<br />
understanding of the privatisation program itself. The<br />
reality is however, it's not only us who want to<br />
privatise what could be described as either inefficient<br />
or capital starved government business enterprises. The<br />
Labor Party wanted to, the Prime Minister spoke in favour<br />
of it, the Treasurer spoke in favour of it, other<br />
Ministers spoke in favour of it but the Labor Party<br />
conference stopped them and they were unable to get<br />
through. </p>
<p>MURPHY: Time unfortunately is really getting away from<br />
us and I now come to the period where I ask you both to<br />
summarise. You're first Andrew Peacock.<br />
PEACOCK: Thank you very much indeed Paul. I said at the<br />
outset Australia requires a new era and a new epoch and a<br />
new spirit. The shame about tonight's debate is that it<br />
was held before the policy speeches. Mr Hawke made that<br />
a condition precedent. I thought elections campaigns<br />
were all about policies.<br />
I can tell you what we're going to do for the future. I<br />
have the blueprint. I have the schedule. My party does.<br />
But essentially, what Mr Hawke is telling you is that he<br />
is proffering the status quo. That's just not good<br />
enough. The world is changing. In fact the<br />
international changes that have occurred in the last four<br />
months have been the greatest since the ending of the<br />
Second World War. Whilst all of that's happening, and so<br />
many people have great hope for the future, Australia is<br />
going backwards.<br />
We've got the policies and we have the team. We are<br />
saying to people that you don't need to in fact have your<br />
living standards crushed. We have not only economic<br />
programs but the associated schedules that go with them.<br />
We've taken some pretty tough decisions to cut government<br />
expenditure to make it leaner so that we can have a real<br />
viable, in fact the most generous family tax program in<br />
decades. We haven't done it just for fun. We've done it<br />
a) because we believe in the family and b) because the<br />
family is being crushed. And in essence, when we come to<br />
the end of this campaign, you'll essentially have a<br />
choice one route or the other. If you in fact want<br />
more of the same then you'll vote Labor. But if you want<br />
a change for the better then the answer is Liberal.<br />
MUJRPHY: Ok, and the final two minute statement comes<br />
from you Mr Hawke.<br />
PM: The choice on the 24th of March is stark. Whether<br />
you're going to have continued economic growth, Job<br />
growth and a restructured economy where we are exporting<br />
more manufactured goods against the most competitive<br />
markets in the world or are you going to have the wages<br />
explosion? Mr Peacock, when asked the central question<br />
what happens to wages, shrugs his shoulder and says who's<br />
to know. And if you say who's to know to wages outcomes<br />
it means that you must have a wages explosion, interest<br />
rates up and the economy doing what it did before, out.<br />
You have the choice between a continuation of Medicare or<br />
its dismantling.<br />
You can have a choice between superannuation, a savings<br />
plan for the future, a fair one available to all and in<br />
which, when it's through, $ 30 a week being paid by </p>
<p>employers for every one of their employees or the<br />
dismantling of that superannuation arrangement.<br />
You can have absolute commitment to the protection of the<br />
environment or you can have the environmental vandalism<br />
of their opposition to every major decision we've had.<br />
And on the question of policies you can have these buzz<br />
words about productivity but it's all what we'll do but<br />
you've not heard one word about how you'll get an<br />
acceptable wages outcome.<br />
Finally, on the question of leadership and unity, you can<br />
have strong knowledgeable leadership of a united team or<br />
you can have the situation opposite where John Howard has<br />
said publicly that there can be and is no trust between<br />
John Howard and Andrew Peacock. The Liberal Party is<br />
ridden with internal bitternesses and hatreds and there<br />
is fundamental division between the Liberal Party and the<br />
National Party with whom they would go into coalition<br />
government. A party which can't govern itself cannot<br />
govern the country.<br />
MURPHY: Ok, and that's where we must finish although it<br />
mightn't be a bad idea to have another debate after the<br />
policy launches. I hope you've found this both<br />
interesting and entertaining. You've seen the leaders.<br />
The choice is now yours on March 24. Mr Hawke, thank you<br />
very much. Mr Peacock, thank you very much. Good luck<br />
to both of you for the rest of the campaign. Thanks also<br />
to my colleagues on the panel and thank you also for the<br />
faxes and telephone calls of suggested questions which<br />
have deluged us for the past few days. So from the great<br />
debate at the ABC, good night.<br />
ends </p>
