FOR PRESS 1 JUNE 1978<br />
NORTHERN TERRITORY SELF-GOVERNMENT.<br />
The Commonwealth Government is proposing that the Northern<br />
Territory Government be given membership of the Premiers'<br />
Conferences after the Territory enters a new phase of selfgovernment<br />
on 1 July.<br />
The Commonwealth Government also favours granting to the<br />
Territory Government full membership of the Advisory Council<br />
for Inter-Government Relations.<br />
Letters have been sent to State Premiers setting out these<br />
proposals ana also proposing that the Territory be invited to<br />
attend the Premiers' Conference in June, with observer status.<br />
In the past, executive members of the Northern Territory Legislative<br />
Assembly have attended most of the Commonwealth/ State Standing<br />
Ministerial Councils as observers.<br />
The Government also believes it would be appropriate for the<br />
Territory to be awarded full membership of Commonwealth/ State<br />
Consultative bodies where responsibility for the relevant function<br />
is transferred to the new Government.<br />
The Commonwealth Government accordingly will sponsor full<br />
membership for the Northern Territory of these bodies when<br />
they first meet after 1 July. </p>
