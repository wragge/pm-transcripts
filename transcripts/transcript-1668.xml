STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE<br />
RT. HON. HAROLD HCLT, CH, MP, IN THE<br />
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES<br />
26TH SEPTEMBER, 1967<br />
VISIT TO AUSTRALIA BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
OF NEW ZEALAND<br />
I ask leave of the House to make a short statement<br />
concerning discussions between the Australian and New Zealand Governments.<br />
I inform the House, with pleasure, that arrangements have<br />
been completed for a brief visit to Canberra next week at my invitation<br />
by the Right Honourable the Prime Minister of New Zealand, Mr Holyoake.<br />
( The New Zealand Minister for Defence, Mr Thompson, will accompany Mr<br />
Holyoake). Australia and New Zealand have a great many problems<br />
of common interest and talks between Mr Holyoake and myself between<br />
New Zealand Ministers and Australian Ministers and between officials of our<br />
respective Governments take place from time to time. It might be said that<br />
we are in almost constant touch. But a visit by the New Zealand Prime Minister<br />
to Australia, however, is an event of significance out of the ordinary run of<br />
discussions and we welcome it wholeheartedly.<br />
The visit will be the occasion to discuss a number of matters<br />
but consultation on defence policies in relation to South East Asia will be a<br />
particular purpose. The visit will be timely in that it will provide the first<br />
opportunity that Mr Holyoake and I have had to discuss at first hand the British<br />
Government's Defence V! hite Paper of July, with its profound implications for<br />
British Forces in Malaysia/ Singapore.<br />
Both Australia and New Zealand have troops in the Commonwealth<br />
Strategic Reserve in Malaysia/ Singapore and since the British decisions,<br />
Australia and New Zealand are both in a new situation in which foreign policy<br />
as well as defence policy aspects come up for review. As I have already<br />
indicated to the House, I contemolate discussions with a nurrber of Governments<br />
before completing our re-examination of Australian defence policy. It will be<br />
clear to the House that a major first step in this reappraisal at Government<br />
level is talks with New Zealand.<br />
Both Austraia and New Zealand have forces engaged and<br />
working together in Vietnam also. By means of exchanges at diplomatic and<br />
defence level there is at any stage a close understanding between the two<br />
Governments about Vietnam but it will be extremely useful for us to review<br />
together the situation there.<br />
Perhaps I should add as a further word of explanation that I do<br />
not expect to be making any early Government announcements as a direct / 2 </p>
<p>result of these discussions. The talks with Mr Holyoake ( and Mr Thompson)<br />
will be, as I have said, part of our continuing close consultation ard we are<br />
neither at the start nor at the end of this process.<br />
I expect Mr Holyoake to arrive in Canberra on Monday,<br />
2nd October. Most of Tuesday will no doubt be taken up with discussions.<br />
The discussions will be with myself, senior colleagues and members of<br />
the Cabinet Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence.<br />
The Minister for External Affairs, Mr Has luck, has<br />
deferred his departure for the United Nations General Assembly at New<br />
York in order to be present for Mr Holyoake's visit. Mr Holyoake will<br />
return to Wellington on Wednesday, 4th October.<br />
My colleagues and I are looking forward to seeing Mr<br />
Holyoake and Mr Thompson in Canberra. They will receive a warm welcome<br />
from us. </p>
