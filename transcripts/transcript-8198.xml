TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCE, WORLD CONGRESS CENTRE,<br />
MELBOURNE, 141 NOVEMBER 1990<br />
E OE PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, what do you hope to get out of the<br />
population study?<br />
PM: Information. In this whole area of immigration and<br />
the pattern of our population growth there are a lot of<br />
prejudices. There's a lot of lack of knowledge. What we<br />
are about is to try and get the best information we can<br />
about what are the consequences of population growth and<br />
what are the sorts of considerations that governments<br />
should properly therefore be planning for, and thinking<br />
about, to take account of the impact of population<br />
growth. Now, for any area of policy making, the<br />
essential prerequisite is to have as much information as<br />
possible. That's one part of it. That is getting a<br />
basis for good policy making. The other, of course, is<br />
to have the basis for having an informed community<br />
because an informed, knowledgeable community is going to<br />
be a more sensible community.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you not convinced then of the benefits<br />
of immigration growth, population growth?<br />
PM: You only had to listen to my speech and I hope you<br />
were there. I've made that quite clear.<br />
JOURNALIST: In your opinion, Prime Minister, what is the<br />
cause of pre.-judice in Australia today regarding<br />
immigration? PM: I think if you're looking at any community, whether<br />
it's Australia or elsewhere, if you ask that question,<br />
what is the cause of prejudice, you're asking one of the<br />
most difficult questions about human nature. Causes of<br />
prejudice wi. ll be different for different people. For<br />
some it will be fear. Perhaps an apprehension that more<br />
immigration is going to mean more competition for jobs<br />
and perhaps less security of employment. For others it<br />
may be considerations based on ignorance about the habits<br />
and customs of people. They just may feel that people<br />
are going to behave in a way which is going to upset<br />
them. A whole range of considerations that go to make up<br />
the patterns of prejudice in any society. I think to a<br />
very large eXtent the common elements in prejudice in any </p>
<p>community are ignorance and fear. That's why the sorts<br />
of things that we're about that I was talking about<br />
tonight and work that you asked about in the previous<br />
question of this National Population Council is to try<br />
and disseminate information. A more enlightened, a more<br />
informed community is going to be a less prejudiced<br />
community. JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke you referred to the Business<br />
Migration Program in your speech today and earlier the<br />
Opposition spokesman on immigration has criticised the<br />
administration of that program saying it's basically at<br />
risk because of maladministration and fraud, widespread<br />
fraud. How do you respond to that claim?<br />
PM: Well we have acknowledged in the past that there<br />
have been some shortcomings. As I said in the speech,<br />
this evening, changes have been made in the<br />
administration of the program. We concede because we're<br />
honest in the way we approach the whole question of<br />
government. There have been some shortcomings and we've<br />
moved to rectify them. But overall the concept and the<br />
practice of the Business Migration Program has been of<br />
considerable benefit to this country.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Ruddock also says that the Australian<br />
immigration program is selecting the lowest common<br />
denominator because better migrants are opting for Canada<br />
and the USA because the economies in those two countries<br />
are much better.<br />
PM: Well Mr Ruddock doesn't know what he's talking<br />
about. It's a tragedy that this policy-less Opposition<br />
and they are indeed policy-less as we've been<br />
demonstrating day after day in the Parliament. They<br />
haven't got one constructive idea. seem to just go<br />
on day after day trying to knock their country. If he<br />
wants to say that Canada is a better place to go to, then<br />
let him say and he'll be judged by his fellow Australians<br />
for the sort of mindless, prejudice, policy-less sort of<br />
representative of an Opposition that he is.<br />
JOURNALIST: What do you say to his rejections, then,<br />
that it's going to be considerably lower over the next<br />
few years given that there'll be tighter migration<br />
regulations? PM: Mr Ruddock and the Opposition wouldn't know what<br />
they are talking about on this or virtually any other<br />
issue. When we've seen this in the Parliament today.<br />
Just let an example today, you had the Leader of the<br />
Opposition being responsible for putting out a press<br />
release which is acknowledged by his own Party I mean,<br />
they were appalled in the Parliament today, at the total<br />
misrepresentation that they go on with. Now when you<br />
have a situation where the Liberal and Country members of<br />
the Parliament are sitting there blanching in the<br />
Parliament when their misrepresentations of their leaders </p>
<p>3.<br />
are exposed, I mean, what weight, what gravamen is there.<br />
They are people totally lacking in substance. To me this<br />
is a pity. I don't take any pleasure in it. I'd be a<br />
much happier Prime Minister if these people would come up<br />
with policies of substance. Come up with considered<br />
propositions, should say, here this is the way we think<br />
things ought to be done. But as was pointed out in the<br />
Parliament today, for instance, in this whole area of how<br />
to run the economy they say, well we say that there<br />
should be a considerable reduction in public<br />
expenditures. And what do they do? They then go into<br />
the Parliament and knock off 25 million savings in<br />
outlays that we're talking about in the area of assets<br />
tests. I mean, they really are fast developing into the<br />
most pathetic Opposition this country has seen. It's<br />
Leader is fast achieving the impossible. He's starting<br />
to make Andrew Peacock and John Howard look like men of<br />
substance and by God is that an achievement.<br />
ends<br />
