STATEMvENT BY THE ACTING PRIME MINISTER DR J. F. CAIRNS<br />
The Acting Prime Minister Dr Cairns said today<br />
he had been in communication with the Director-General of<br />
the Natural Disasters Organisation, Major General Stretton.<br />
General Stretton advised Dr Cairns that in his opinion the<br />
emergency situation in Darwin was at an end and that it was<br />
appropriate that the administration of the city be handed back<br />
to the normal authorities.<br />
General Stretton advised Dr Cairns that Darwin was<br />
secure and was functioning in an orderly way. Dr Cairns said<br />
he had authorised General Stretton to make the arrangements<br />
necessary to hand over to the administrator of the Northern<br />
Territory, Mr Jock Nelson, and to make the arrangements necessary<br />
for General Stretton and his staff to leave Darwin.<br />
" The work of General Stretton has been a great credit<br />
to himself and to his staff," Dr Cairns said. " A tremendous<br />
amount has been achieved in a shorter time than could be<br />
expected. I express to General Stretton and to his staff<br />
the gratitude of the Australian Government and of the Australian<br />
people." Dr Cairns said he was satisfied with General Stretton ' s<br />
advice to him that the job of the N. D. O. had been done and that<br />
the normal authorities could resume responsibility in Darwin.<br />
