PRESS: P. M. No. 22/ 1968<br />
AUSTRALIAN SUGAR FOR VIETNhM<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Yr. John Gorton<br />
The Prime Minister, Yr. Gorton, said today that<br />
general agreement had been reached between President<br />
Johnson and himself that Australia would supply refined<br />
sugar to the allied lorces in South Vietnam.<br />
The Prime Minister explained that most of the<br />
food requirements ( including sugar) of the allied forces<br />
in South Vietnam are procured on behalf of the allies by<br />
the American Government. Australia has then reimoursed<br />
the United States for the cost of Australia's share of<br />
these procurements. Mr. Gorton said that although details of the<br />
arrangement had yet to be worked out the quantity and<br />
value of the sugar involved had been broadly agreed at<br />
approximately 27 thousand short tons worth about SA6M.<br />
As one of the world's largest sugar exporters,<br />
Australia welcomed this procurement by the American<br />
authorities. C. ANBERRA<br />
