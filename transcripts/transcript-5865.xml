PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA SUNDAY, 18 JULY 1982<br />
CAPTIVE NATIONS WEEK, 18 to 24 JULY<br />
In Captive Nat~ ions Week the Government is mindful of its<br />
significance and its relevance for Australians. We recall<br />
during this week the tragic and sometimes brutal events which<br />
have put an end to the independence of many nations. It is<br />
a week of both remembrance and conrmitment: remembrance of<br />
those who have suffered and died in their quest for individual<br />
and national freedoms; and a commitment not to accept, and to<br />
do all we can to alleviate, the denial of independence that<br />
continues to be endured in many nations today.<br />
There are many recent examples of how easily national freedoms<br />
can be destroyed. The Soviet military presence in Afghanistan,<br />
the Soviet-ba ked Vietnamese occupation of Kainpuchea,<br />
and the measures taken to stifle free expression and basic<br />
liberties in ' Poland are part of a long Soviet record of such<br />
intervention. We remember in partLicular this week all those<br />
people who have been the victim of the world's greatest<br />
expansionist power, the Soviet Union. We recall the heroism<br />
of men and women who have resisted their subjugation and who<br />
continue today in their efforts to win back the freedoms<br />
which are rightfully theirs.<br />
Captive Nations Week, however, is more than an occasion for<br />
remembrance and regret. It is also a time to review our<br />
commitment to policies that affirm the value of freedom.<br />
Freedom is part of Australia's past, its presentand its<br />
future. -We are proud of our tolerance of individual views<br />
and our commitment to individual freedoms. We are grateful<br />
for the contributions made by many people, who have been<br />
forced to leave their homelands, towards making our country<br />
a richer and more truly multicultural society. These aspects<br />
of Australian life need to be constantly protected and nurtured.<br />
We need to remember that the freedom which we enjoy and often<br />
take for granted is denied to many nations.<br />
Captive Naticons Week reminds us that peace and freedom will<br />
be lost by dEfault if those nations which seek to preserve<br />
them leave the actual defence to others. The preservation<br />
of freedom requires constant vigilance, constant awareness<br />
and a preparEdness to make sacrifices. Free nations need to<br />
remain aware that their freedom involves obligations. Only<br />
through f ulf illing those obligations can free nations ensure<br />
that the future belongs not to those who seek to impose a<br />
single dogmatic ideology but to those who aim to liberate<br />
the diverse energies of free people. </p>
