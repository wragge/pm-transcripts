PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 26 September 1984<br />
The Government welcomes the agreement th~ at has been<br />
reached by the British and Chinese Governments about the<br />
future of Hong Kong.<br />
I congratulate both Governments on having achieved this<br />
settlement. It is noteworthy thatmore than two years of intensive<br />
negotiations have resulted in a detailed agreement being<br />
reached with the declared object of maintaining confidence<br />
in Hong Kong and of ensuring its continued stability and<br />
prosperity. It has been my firmly and consistently held view, a view<br />
strengthened by my visit to Hong Kong and particularly by<br />
my discussions with Premier Zhao in Peking in February<br />
this year, that the discussions between the United Kingdom<br />
and China would result in an amicable and sensible<br />
agreement which would allow Hong Kong to continue to<br />
function in conditions acceptable to all the parties.<br />
Australia has important interests in Hong Kong and in<br />
Hong Kong's continuing to play a positive role in the<br />
development of our region. The agreement that has now<br />
been reached, and the arrangements made for continuing<br />
co-operation between the parties involved in Hong Kong's<br />
future, will make an important contribution to the<br />
political stability of the Western Pacific region as a<br />
whole. </p>
