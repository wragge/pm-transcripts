COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA<br />
SPEECH BY<br />
The Rt Hon. W. McMAHON, M. P.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
ON<br />
Additional Assistance for Government and<br />
Independent Schools<br />
Ministerial Statement<br />
[ From the ' Parliamentary Debates', 9 December 1971]<br />
Mr McMLAHON ( Lowe-Prime Minister)<br />
-by leave-I wish to inform -the House<br />
of decisions the Government has taken<br />
to provide additional assistance to both<br />
government and independent schools : n<br />
areas of special need. Decisions taken in<br />
association with Commonwealth and State<br />
conferences over the last 18 months or so<br />
have resulted in a significant increase in<br />
the level and rate of growth of general<br />
revenue assistance from the Commonwealth<br />
to the States. The current expenditure<br />
on primary and secondary education in<br />
State schools has benefited significantly<br />
from these arrangements and the Government<br />
is convinced that additional assistance<br />
in that area would not be justified. However,<br />
the States have not been able to allocate<br />
as much as they would -have liked from their<br />
available capital funds for primary and<br />
secondary school buildings. They speak of<br />
problems including the provision of additional<br />
classrooms and associated facilities<br />
and the replacement of outmoded and<br />
cramped accommodation.<br />
We have decided that it would be desirable<br />
to assist the States to increase their<br />
capital expenditure in respect of primary<br />
and secondary schools. We have given very<br />
careful thought to the form in which we<br />
should provide this assistance and we have<br />
decided that the best approach would be to provide this assistance by way of additions<br />
to the interest-free capital grants<br />
which the Commonwealth is making to the<br />
States as part of their annual works and<br />
housing programmes, and as a substitute<br />
for loan raisings. These capital grants are<br />
being paid for the purpose of assisting the<br />
States to finance non-productive capital<br />
works, without incurring debt charges on<br />
the funds used. However, as these grants<br />
are being made in recognition of the need<br />
expressed by the States for additional capital<br />
expenditure in primary and secondary<br />
schools, we would expect them to be so<br />
used by the States. We would prefer that<br />
science laboratories and libraries in<br />
secondary schools, for which there are<br />
existing special purpose grants, be excluded<br />
from these grants.<br />
The additional grants will also be paid<br />
entirely without any matching conditions<br />
attached to them. I should add that the<br />
Commonwealth expects that the States will<br />
continue with their own planned levels of<br />
expenditure in this area so that these grants<br />
will represent a net addition to the facilities<br />
in government schools. The amount of the<br />
additional grants will be $ 20m of which part<br />
will be paid in the remainder of this financial<br />
year and part in 1972-73. They will be<br />
distributed between the States in proportion<br />
to the capital grants presently being received </p>
<p>by them, which in turn are distributed in<br />
the same way as the States' Loan Couqcil<br />
borrowing programmes for works and<br />
housing. The additional grants will be<br />
amalgamated into the basic capital grants<br />
for the purpose of determining the proportion<br />
of the works and housing programme<br />
that the grants Will represent in future years.<br />
The amount that each State will receive on<br />
the basis indicated is as follows: New South<br />
Wales, $ 6.36m; Victoria, $ 5.10m; Queensland,<br />
$ 2.53m; South Australia, $ 2.74m;<br />
Western Australia, $ l. 87m; and Tasmania.<br />
$ 1 .40m-a total of $ 20m. I have written to<br />
the Premiers inviting them to agree to<br />
accept these grants on the basis I have<br />
outlined. Since 1969 running costs of government<br />
schools have risen by at least 30 per cent<br />
to 40 per cent and even more in some<br />
cases and it is now costing over $ 300 a year<br />
to educate a child in a government primary<br />
school and over $ 500 a year to educate a<br />
child in a government secondary school.<br />
The general financial assistance grants from<br />
the Commonwealth represent about one half<br />
of the State's current Budget expenditure<br />
and on this basis it can be said that the<br />
Commonwealth is supporting approximately<br />
one half of the increased expenditure by the<br />
States on primary and secondary schools.<br />
The independent schools have received additional<br />
assistance from the States, but they<br />
are facing increasing difficulties in their<br />
efforts to provide adequate facilities for a<br />
reasonable proportion of the school-going<br />
population. Many of the independent<br />
schools have been paying their teachers<br />
salaries at rates significantly lower than<br />
those paid in government schools. However,<br />
there is now a number of awards<br />
which require these salaries to be increased<br />
to full parity with the operative rates in<br />
government schools over a short period.<br />
This development has resulted in relatively<br />
greater increases in costs in the independent<br />
schools than in the government schools. The<br />
independent schools have limited capacity<br />
to charge higher fees and collect other<br />
income, and for boarding schools there are<br />
additional difficulties arising from the downturn<br />
in rural activity. The combination of<br />
these factors has resulted in a continued<br />
drift in enrolments to government schools.<br />
The need for immediate additional<br />
assistance to independent schools in emphasised by the following current developments.<br />
The Roman Catholic authorities in Melbourne<br />
are considering seriously a proposal<br />
not to expand secondary schools but to concentrate<br />
resources in primary schools. In<br />
Tasmania a number of Roman Catholic and<br />
other independent schools are faced with<br />
the prospect of having to cease operations.<br />
The Government hopes that a contraction<br />
would not be necessary in either area.<br />
As a further measure of assistance to the<br />
independent schools, the Government has<br />
decided to increase the rates of the annual<br />
per capita grants to both primary and<br />
secondary independent schools throughout<br />
Australia. These grants were first made<br />
available from the, beginning of 1970 at<br />
annual rates of $ 35 per head in primary<br />
schools and $ 50 per head in secondary<br />
schools. These rates will be increased to<br />
$ 50 per head in primary schools and $ 68<br />
per head in secondary schools from the<br />
beginning of 1972. These additional per<br />
capita grants to independent schools in the<br />
States are expected to cost $ 9.7m in 1972<br />
of which half, that is $ 4,850,000 will be<br />
payable during the financial year 1971-72.<br />
The amount in each State will be approximately:<br />
New South Wales, $ 3.58m; Victoria,<br />
$ 3.14m; Queensland, $ 1.46m; South<br />
Australia, $ 600,000; Western Australia,<br />
$ 700,000; and Tasmania, $ 220,000-a total<br />
of $ 9.70m.<br />
Independent schools in the Australian<br />
Capital Territory and the Northern Territory<br />
share in the per capita grants which<br />
the Commonwealth makes available to<br />
independent schools in the States. They also<br />
receive a local component in their per<br />
capita grants broadly equivalent to those<br />
paid * by the State governments to independent<br />
schools in the States. In addition<br />
to the increases I have already mentioned,<br />
the local component in the annual per<br />
capita grants to independent schools in the<br />
2 Territories will be increased from the<br />
beginning of 1972. The increases will be<br />
from $ 20 to $ 35 per head in primary<br />
schools and in secondary schools from<br />
$ 30 to $ 45 in forms 1 and 2, from $ 40 to<br />
$ 45 in forms 3 and 4, and from $ 45 to<br />
$ 50 in forms 5 and 6. The increased grants<br />
to independent schools in the Australian<br />
Capital Teritory and the Northern Territory<br />
are expected to cost $ 347,000 in 1972<br />
of which $ 173,000 will be payable during </p>
<p>the financial year 1971-72. The Government<br />
will introduce appropriate legislation<br />
covering these measures during the autumn<br />
session of the Parliament next year.<br />
My Government will continue to cooperate<br />
with the States in measures both<br />
direct and indirect to expand and improve<br />
education services in government schools.<br />
Our policy for the independent schools is<br />
that, relying on their own efforts and with<br />
assistance from governments, they should<br />
be able to continue to provide places at a<br />
reasonable standard for that proportion of the school population which in the past has<br />
sought education in non-government<br />
schools. The action we are now taking is a<br />
further indication of our determination to<br />
assist those directly concerned to improve<br />
the standards in all types of schools. I<br />
present the following paper:<br />
Additional Assistance for government and<br />
independent schools-ministerial statement,<br />
9th December 1971.<br />
Motion ( by Mr Swartz) proposed:<br />
That the House take note of the paper.<br />
