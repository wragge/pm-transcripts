    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE...................................................................................................</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, it was a great result and on behalf of all Australians I congratulate</p>
<p> Steve Waugh and all the members of the Australian team. Shane Warne</p>
<p> on being named man of the match. I had the opportunity of speaking</p>
<p> to Steve Waugh last night just after the game to congratulate him,</p>
<p> it certainly sounded a very excited Australian dressing room and not</p>
<p> surprisingly because to win seven in a row is an astonishing performance.</p>
<p> The team had been written off by some of its critics without any real</p>
<p> prospect of winning the World Cup and I think it's just an outstanding</p>
<p> performance which fills all Australian sports lovers with great pride.</p>
<p> It also, incidentally, caps a great weekend of sport for Australians.</p>
<p> The men's and women's hockey teams were victorious and, of course,</p>
<p> the Wallabies beat Ireland in the Rugby Union Test in Perth. So the</p>
<p> World Cup triumph is a tremendous end to a great sporting weekend</p>
<p> for all Australians.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, will there by any kind of Commonwealth reception to welcome</p>
<p> home the World....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I am having a look at that. I am sure that in different ways all Australians</p>
<p> will want to honour the team and I am looking at what will be an appropriate</p>
<p> thing for the Federal Government to do and I am sure the Federal Opposition</p>
<p> as well.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Are you feeling a little bleary eyed yourself?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I am feeling a bit bleary eyed. I haven't had a lot of sleep the last</p>
<p> week or 10 days but it's all been in a tremendous cause and last night</p>
<p> was just terrific and a very resounding victory. The contest was not</p>
<p> as tight as the two previous games but the outcome was very gratifying</p>
<p> indeed and the delirious pandemonium that I could hear over the mobile</p>
<p> phone in the Australian dressing room last night was tremendous.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Any individual efforts you would like to single out Prime Minister?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I think Steven Waugh's century, his 120-odd in the match that</p>
<p> we needed to win to get into the semi-final against South Africa last</p>
<p> Sunday week, I thought that was the innings of the series as far as</p>
<p> Australia was concerned. That was the game that made it really...the</p>
<p> innings that made it really possible for us to end up winning the</p>
<p> World Cup. Without that we would not have beaten South Africa in that</p>
<p> match and therefore would have not got to the semi-final and certainly</p>
<p> not to the final. It was an absolutely World Cup winning innings and</p>
<p> the best one day innings I have seen. There may have been better ones</p>
<p> that I haven't seen but of the ones I have seen there have been none</p>
<p> better.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Are you sympathetic on any staffers who are a bit bleary eyed this</p>
<p> morning?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Absolutely. All is forgiven today.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>You must be pleased the early finish perhaps has improved Australia's</p>
<p> productivity today?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh look, I always knew Australians would turn up at work but I always</p>
<p> knew they'd be a bit more tired and I think everybody understands</p>
<p> that. It's all been in a tremendous cause and there's such a feeling</p>
<p> of benevolence and goodwill and gratitude towards the team I think</p>
<p> that will do wonders for productivity.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Can we ask you a couple of quick questions on other issues? Can I</p>
<p> ask, Mr Beazley is saying that the Telstra bonus for Tasmania is a</p>
<p> huge bribe....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh really, really. I mean, we went to the election with this. What</p>
<p> are they going on about? And why is Mr Beazley against helping the</p>
<p> State that has got the highest unemployment in this country? I mean,</p>
<p> how mean can you get? Tasmania needs a bit of help, Tasmania has got</p>
<p> a very high level of unemployment, doesn't have a lot of industry.</p>
<p> I mean, is Mr Beazley so insensitive that he doesn't understand that?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Are other States missing out to Tasmania...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, they are not missing out because in relation to the other States</p>
<p> they were all very, very generously treated in the first part of the</p>
<p> social bonus. And when you take into account all of the considerations</p>
<p> the Government has to bring to bear on this it's a very fair proposal.</p>
<p> And I just say again that we took this to the people, the people voted</p>
<p> for this, we have a mandate to indeed sell the whole of Telstra let</p>
<p> alone another 16 per cent.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Do you have any indication at this stage about how Senator Colston</p>
<p> may vote?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I hope that he will see the value of this package for Queensland.</p>
<p> I hope that he will see the educational advantages, things that he</p>
<p> has always been interested in in his time in the Senate. I never take</p>
<p> anything for granted but I am hopeful that we will get the support</p>
<p> of the Senate. But I have learnt from past experience that you don't</p>
<p> really know until the votes are finally cast.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, on tax. There's a suggestion this morning that the</p>
<p> Government's timetable is too pushed, that individuals or the new</p>
<p> Senate could be sworn in at midnight at the end of June and then push</p>
<p> on straight into another....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It's all news to me that, I don't know anything about that. Thank</p>
<p> you. [ends]</p>
