PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 16 JULY 1978<br />
ELECTORATE TALK<br />
In June 1976, in a statement on the world situation, I informed<br />
the Parliament of the Australian Government's serious concern<br />
about some aspects of the Soviet Union's activities.<br />
I noted that:<br />
" The Soviet leaders now have a strategic and political<br />
reach, a capacity to influence and even intervene well<br />
beyond the periphery of the established zones of Soviet<br />
security interest.<br />
" The time has come to expect a sign from the U. S. S. R.<br />
that it understands this, and that it is serious about<br />
reaching global accommodation with the West."<br />
During the two years s -z that statement, the Soviet Union<br />
has not only failed to = i~ e such a sign, but its current<br />
behaviour-is a source ol:-increasing international concern.<br />
We are witnessing a new phase in the Soviet Union's persecution<br />
of leaders of the human rights movement. The Soviet Union has<br />
established a considerable presence in the Horn of Africa. And<br />
there is a continuing major build-up in the military power of<br />
the Warsaw Pact.<br />
These are all distr" ui;= signs of the Soviet Union's failure<br />
to moderate major as== e = zs of its international behaviour<br />
aspects which exacer--bate world tensions.<br />
This week, in the area of human rights, the trials of two leading<br />
Soviet human rights defenders, Anatoly Shcharnsky and Alexandr<br />
Ginsburg, have been strongly condemned by the Australian Government<br />
and by the leaders of almost all Western democracies.<br />
We will continue to express our concern to the Soviet Union.<br />
We urge the Soviet Union to implement the important principles<br />
of human rights embodied in the 1977 Helsinki Accords, to which<br />
they solemnly agreed. We urge it to consider the adverse effects<br />
of the present campaign of repression of those who have attempted<br />
to monitor Soviet compliance with an international agreement. / 2 </p>
<p>It is hard for us to believe that Soviet leaders intend to honour<br />
international commitments and understandings if they can allow<br />
such persecution to proceed.<br />
Our concern at the Soviet Union's recent action on human rights<br />
is all the more-acute since it is jeopardising areas of arms<br />
control in which there has been some progress.<br />
The trials occur in the very week in which the United States and<br />
the Soviet Union are continuing major negotiations designed to<br />
reach new agreement to limit strategic arms.<br />
The Soviet Union's placing in jeopardy of these negotiations is<br />
even more disturbing because while it has been concerned with<br />
measures of nuclear disarmament, it-has also displayed a disturbing<br />
attachment to the utility of military power as a means of expanding.<br />
its own influence.<br />
In 1976 I said:<br />
" People can reason~ ably conclude that the Soviet Union<br />
still seeks to exznand its influence throughout the world<br />
in order to achieve Societ primacy. Its actions all too<br />
often appear inconsist-ent with the aim of reducing world<br />
tension The hu'id-up of the Warsaw Pact far exceeds<br />
the object of reatiia-raments of defending eastern Europe."<br />
Australia is not alone in its attitude. Just recently, President<br />
Carter said that t-he Soviet Union's miliary build-up " far exceeds<br />
the Soviet Union's l~ ztesecurity needs."<br />
This apprehension has also been plainly and forcefully voiced by<br />
the Biritsh Prime Min~ ister, Mr Callaghan, as . he-. repeated and<br />
endorsed President Ca. r_-a ' s statement.<br />
Other western leaders have expressed their concern.<br />
One current example off = he destabilising effects of the Soviet<br />
pursuit of power is tesituation in Africa. There, the Soviet<br />
Union has establishe. considerable presence, both in its own<br />
right, and through surrogate, Cuba.<br />
Despit e the loss o: ; r Berbera facilities, the substantial<br />
number of Soviet aa~ esand Cuban troops in the Horn of Africa,<br />
estimnated at some IE, 20 has an effect on the balance of power<br />
in the area as a whole, including the Indian Ocean.<br />
There is also a large number of Soviet and Cuban personnel in<br />
Angola. Their presence has wider implications for Southern<br />
Africa. Soviet Union activities in Africa have been instrumental in halting<br />
the discussions between the United States thd the Soviet Union,<br />
designed to achieve agreement about ba',. ance of power in the Indian<br />
Ocean designed to achieve a lowering of naval force levels in<br />
the Indian Ocean. ./ 3 </p>
<p>3.<br />
What the Soviet Union has done does not contribute to the search<br />
for peaceful solutions to the problem of the areas.<br />
The Soviet Union today still has an immense responsibility to<br />
use it3 power and influence to strengthen international peace<br />
and security. It has an opportunity to use its position to help<br />
build a stable and humane international order, and to end the<br />
arms build-up.<br />
I am sure all Australia. joins me in expressing the hope that<br />
the Soviet leaders will meet this historic responsibility. </p>
