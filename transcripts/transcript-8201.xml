PARTIAL TRANSCRIPT OF LOCAL NEWS CONFERENCE, CHARTERS<br />
TOWERS JOB TRAINING CENTRE, CHARTERS TOWERS, 16 NOVEMER<br />
1990 E &amp; 0E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, if the Uruguay Round indeed starts<br />
to fail, do you suggest that Lee Kuan Yew or a suggestion<br />
the world will fracture trading blocs likely<br />
outcome PM: Lew Kuan Yew Is not the first one by any means to<br />
point it out In my lecture in Singapore myself some<br />
years ago I made precisely this point. That's why we've<br />
got to understand these real dimensions that the<br />
problem is confronting the world. It's not just an<br />
economic challenge. If the Round fails then you will<br />
have a collapse Into economic autarchy, increasing<br />
protectionism and that Is an economic disaster. What<br />
we've got to understand is that it's more of an economic<br />
disaster, it will be a political disaster because if<br />
history shows. you anything it shows you this; that when<br />
countries do degenerate into trading blocs you have in<br />
there the seeds of political conflict. That's why I rang<br />
President Bush and said look we really do have a<br />
responsibility to inject political impetus into these<br />
discussions so that we get a positive outcome. I'm very<br />
pleased to say that the President totally agreed with me.<br />
We're going to keep in contact. He's taking bilateral<br />
Initiatives, I'm taking further initiatives and I'll be<br />
in touch with Chancellor Kohl, Prime Minister Rocard,<br />
uniting all the European leaders, and I'm going to do<br />
everything I possibly can to avoid what I think will be a<br />
disaster. Because If the system breaks down then you<br />
will have Europe, you've got the United States and Canada<br />
and they are conducting discussions and negotiations with<br />
Mexico. Inevitably, I guess, what we would find is that<br />
and this is the worst case scenario situation against<br />
all my philosophies I think if that's what happens we'd<br />
have to be looking at our region to see what sort of<br />
grouping we could become associated with. But this is a<br />
recipe for disaster.<br />
JOURNALIST: But would the all in that position<br />
have to be considered. Some reduction in the tariff<br />
would be hit by..<br />
PM: Your farmers can't have it both ways.<br />
JOURNALIST: inaudible </p>
<p>2<br />
PM: Well if we have a position where the rural community<br />
is saying if we want tariffs against citrus and so on<br />
coming in here, how do you set their argument that they<br />
want an abolition of tariffs in regard to machinery<br />
that's coming in. It's pretty hard to sit side by side<br />
and ride those two horses in the same room at the same<br />
time.<br />
