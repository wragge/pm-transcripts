LAYING OF THE FOUNDATION STONE AT THE<br />
KEW JEWISH CENTRlE, MELBOURNE<br />
ON 25TH AUGST, 1963<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon, Sir RoberCt Menzies<br />
Mr. Chairman Your Excellency and Ladies and Gentlemen and<br />
Boys and Girls You notice that I haven't tried to compete with<br />
my predecessors who had the game of naming all the people<br />
who ought to be named to perfection ( Laughter) and as I am<br />
quite an amateur in these matters, I will just begin by<br />
saying Sir" l. It is a very great pleasure for me and for my<br />
wife to be here. I don't need to tell you that. I have had<br />
the privilege in quite a few parts of Australia of attending<br />
the opening of Jewish Community Centres schools, homes and the<br />
like tbut do you know, this is the first tire I was ever asked<br />
to attend one in my own electorate ( Laughter). In factl you<br />
are entitled to gaze on me today with a certain amount of<br />
suspicion ( Laughter). Elsewhere it was quite all right; they<br />
weren't my electors, but this morning, I am exposing myself<br />
to great risk. I lived in Kew for many years. I have a great<br />
ambition to live there again before I die, though of course,<br />
the speed with which I can achieve that result will depend<br />
very largely on what happens to me at the hands of people like<br />
Senator Cohen and Maurice Ashkanasy ( Laughter)<br />
You have just been reminded of the story of so<br />
many of you and so many of your friends. It is one of the<br />
dreadful chapters in European history and in world history,<br />
but it means something to so many of you to have come up out<br />
of the house of bondage and into a free land, because this is<br />
a free land. This indeed, I am happy to say, is a land of<br />
tolerance, It won't mean that you won't meet a few intolerant<br />
people. There are some people who are even intolerant of me.<br />
Very hard to believe ( Laughter). But this, as a land, as a<br />
community, is a place of tolerance.<br />
I just referred to your very distinguished<br />
colleague and office-bearer Maurice Ashkanasy. I don't wanat<br />
to do him any damage but, Sir, he was a pupil of mine when he<br />
went to the Bar. I taught him practically all the law that<br />
he has now forgotten, ( Laughter) And he is a great friend of<br />
mine, We are always delighted to see each other, but I gather<br />
that he is on the opposite side to mine, politically, Now<br />
this is good. We dontt want too many people to be on the<br />
opposite side, but it is a very good thing. It is a very good<br />
thing that we should live in a community, isn't it, in which<br />
political opposition and personal friendship can dwell happily<br />
together. And this is of tremendous importance to the whole<br />
of Australia and particularly, if I may say so, of importance<br />
to you, You are, many of you, so near to the bitterness of<br />
intolerance persecution by intolerant people that it's not<br />
so easy, perhaps, for you to realise the true quality of this<br />
community very quickly, But I say to you these memories will,<br />
I hope, fade. They wontt be hold in a direot sense by children,<br />

<p>2<br />
More and more everybody will come to realise that this is a<br />
country in which every community may form part of a greater<br />
community and that a tolerant one.<br />
Now, of course, toleration is a very good thing.<br />
Perhaps it isn't enough. A man may be tolerant because he is<br />
indifferent, because he doesn't care what happens to the other<br />
fellow, and so although it's good, it isn't everything. In<br />
reality what makes a contribution to a nation like Australia<br />
is the service of people who have enthusiasm and faith, who do<br />
believe in something. They are not tolerant because they are<br />
indifferent, They are tolerant because they have a passionate<br />
belief in their hearts. And that's why the religious significance<br />
of this occasion is not to be overlooked, Indeed, this is at<br />
the very centre of it. I don't imagine that anybody in what<br />
I will call for this purpose, the Jewish community woulA wish<br />
that all Jews should live in one place together anA that all<br />
Scotsmen should live in another suburb all together with nobody<br />
else. I dot know how you would get on but I would becor~ e<br />
awfully tired of Scotsmen, No, no. ~ ie don't want this. We<br />
dont want to have a sort of colonial system established and<br />
therefore it is a very good thing that we should be all of us<br />
in our various origins distributed in the community but we<br />
must retain our right to get together from time to time for our<br />
common purposesI not thereby losing our sense of general<br />
obligation as citizens but gathering in the church of our faith,<br />
meeting the people of our faith refreshing ourselves from time<br />
to time at the very fountainheaA of the things that we believe in.<br />
You know, I made a lighthearted reference just<br />
now to Scotsmen, Nov been made an authentic one recently by<br />
being given the Order of the Thistle. Nothing could be more<br />
Scottish than that. Well you know as well as I do that there<br />
are two races in this world who are suspected by ill-informed<br />
outsiders of being moan. ( Laughter) the Jews and the Scots,<br />
the truth of course being that they are both diligent in<br />
business and may therefore stand before kings and that they<br />
are diligent in business, successful perhaps more than most<br />
more than some, and with the greatest capacity for generosity<br />
that can be found anywhere around the world. This is a proud<br />
thing to recall. I always admire immensely whenever I go to<br />
any Jewish establishment as I will call it in Australia how<br />
this family feeling, this instinct, this sense of responsibility<br />
for other people in your community as if they were all members<br />
of your family how this is maintaining itself and what a great<br />
contribution it is making to Australian life,<br />
You know, yesterday afternoon, I had the great<br />
honour of opening a very large building in Monash University<br />
a building which they have named after me, and I said something<br />
about the naming of the University. Every young member of your<br />
community ought to feel inspired by the contribution made by<br />
great, great Australians like Monash and like Isaacs. These'<br />
are outstanding examples of what can be done.<br />
Now, I've said something and I won't say very much<br />
more, I've said something to you about not establishing separate<br />
communities in a physical sense, maintaining your community<br />
relations but contributing to the community in the broad sense,<br />
adding threads to the structure of the community. This I<br />
believe is of tremendous importance. There are a lot o1 people<br />
you will encounter who think that we all ought to be the sqme, </p>
<p>that there ought to be a species of drab uniformity, that they<br />
all ought to be like meg so to speak, that they all ought to<br />
be like you, so to speak. This passion for uniformity is not<br />
to be encouraged. What we need in Australia is that every<br />
person coming from some particular race or faith who comes into<br />
the Australian community should retain his quality in that sense<br />
but should add it to the qualities of all the other people in<br />
the community so that finally we get a powerful structure, a<br />
self-respecting structure, a community of high ideals and of<br />
clear faith and of generosity and of understanding.<br />
Therefore, be yourselves I say this to the more<br />
newly-arrived be yourselves at all times, but also be<br />
something broader than that, a member of a community to which,<br />
given health and strength, you will make some notable contribution,<br />
I am delighted that this centre is being established<br />
here. I could see at a glance as we came along this morning<br />
that you had established already a pretty considerable command<br />
over the local Council. I saw treble parking in the street<br />
( Laughter) and somebody said~ in my party, " Now, look at that.<br />
That seems remarkable." I said, " Oh, no: Bill Birrell, the<br />
Town Clerk, will be there," ( Laughter)<br />
I won't detain you any longer. This is a very<br />
happy occasion for you and I must say, a very happy occasion<br />
for me. I ask God to bless you in your enterprise. May it<br />
succeed beyond your dreams. </p>
