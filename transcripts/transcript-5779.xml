FOR M4EDIA TUESDAY, 23 MARCH 1982<br />
AUSTRALIAN FOOTBALL TREE PLANTING<br />
I'd like to congratulate you very much on having your second<br />
national conference in Canberra and I think the first<br />
seminar. From my information on the first occasion there<br />
wasn't a seminar of the kind that was organised yesterday.<br />
I understand that went well and was regarded as a great<br />
S success. -You can't really blame us if you<br />
haven't been recognised in some special and unique way,<br />
because if you have a National Conference in Canberra in 1951<br />
then turn around and forget that this capital exists for 30 years.<br />
So now I'm very glad that that decision has been rectified and<br />
you have had a national conference here. I've alsb no-ted what you<br />
have said about the National Institute of Sport.<br />
The InstitutE! is expanding, it will be embracing additional<br />
sports, I'm riot quite sure of the mechanisms that the Institute<br />
uses to choose which sport, but as sometimes a supporter of the<br />
Australian game, I only hope that you put up a very good case<br />
and one that is irresistible and can't be rejected. As a supporter<br />
of football :-Lf you don't put up a case that is as strongj as that,<br />
and as good as that, I'll be writing to people who represent mqy<br />
interests in football to see why they didn't do a better job.<br />
I do hope that you do have success with that application.<br />
You mentioned New Zealand, you know if the Australian game was<br />
stronger and overwhelming in New Zealand, some of<br />
the problems we have had and are likely to have, just wouldn't<br />
have been present. So there is a challenge in front of you<br />
to maybe replace rugby and become the number one gamne in New<br />
Zealand, because I've got no doubt that that would do a great<br />
deal for ties with New1 Zealand and Australia.<br />
I would just like to wish all good fortune to all of you.<br />
The administration of Australian football has really beenundertaken<br />
on a high plane over recent years in a that has<br />
advanced the: game wherever it is played, and it is not just players<br />
who make the! game, it is the administration, and you're here in<br />
that capacity. I believe you have every right to be proud in the<br />
way this game has been managed in recent times while its been in<br />
your collective charcres. May Australian football go fromstrength<br />
to strength whether it is in Australia or elsewhere. </p>
