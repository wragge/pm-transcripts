    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Prime Minister today announced the communities of Smithton, Scottsdale and Midway Point will be the first to receive optical fibre broadband connections in the rollout of the National Broadband Network in Tasmania.  Nearly 5000 premises will have access to optical fibre broadband capable of delivering speeds of 100 megabits per second  -  the first of the $43 billion National Broadband Network.  To support the rollout, backbone fibre (fibre optic transmission links) will be built along the following five routes:  </p>
<p> * Port Latta to Smithton</p>
<p> * Cambridge to Midway Point</p>
<p> * Midway  Point to Triabunna</p>
<p> * George  Town to Scottsdale</p>
<p> * Scottsdale to St Helens</p>
<p> A new company, the Tasmanian NBN Company Limited (TNBN Co), will be established and jointly owned by the National Broadband Network Company and Aurora Energy to conduct the rollout and operate the network.  The first stage of the National Broadband Network rollout will deliver wholesale-only, open access broadband network services in the second quarter of 2010.  The Prime Minister also announced Mr Doug Campbell AM as Chair of the new Tasmanian company, and Mr Mike Quigley as the Executive Chair and CEO of the National company.  The Prime Minister made the announcement at the opening of the Aurora Energy and National Broadband Network Data Centre, a key piece of infrastructure that will support the National Broadband Network in Tasmania.  The Data Centre will be the location for operating support systems and business support systems which are critical for the efficient operation of the network.  The opening of the data centre coincided with a cable pull through, connecting the data centre with backbone infrastructure. This is the first piece of NBN cable to be installed in Australia and is a physical demonstration of work commencing on the ground in Tasmania.  The start of the National Broadband Network rollout in Smithton, Scottsdale and Midway Point highlights the Rudd Government's commitment to providing super-fast broadband for regional and rural communities.  The $43 billion National Broadband Network is the single largest infrastructure project in Australia's history, and is critical to building the recovery from the global economic recession.  This project marks the start of 25,000 local jobs that will be supported by the eight-year National Broadband Network project.
