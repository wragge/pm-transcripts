PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
ECONOMIC PLANNING ADVISORY COUNCIL NEW ARRANGEMENTS<br />
Today I am announcing changes to EPAC. Its tenth year of operation<br />
provides an appropriate time to make changes to enhance its future role.<br />
EPAC has contributed substantially to promoting a broader consensus<br />
and understanding of Australia's medium and long-term economic and<br />
social prospects.<br />
There has been a convergence of views among major groups in Australia<br />
that was unthinkable a decade earlier.<br />
EPAC discussion and consultation was the early linchpin for that process.<br />
Similarly, EPAC's reports have helped inform and shape debate on a wide<br />
range of issues including: foreign and public sector debt, savings and<br />
investment, population ageing, growth potential, productivity, public<br />
sector benchmarking, enterprise bargaining and micro-economic reform.<br />
I now wish to build on these achievements by creating a new advisory<br />
group, by developing and focusing the public information work of EPAC,<br />
and by establishing a capacity for related special projects in order to<br />
extend EPAC activities.<br />
In order to improve my access to new ideas and new ways forward in<br />
business and economic matters, I will be appointing a new " Eropornic<br />
Round-Table", to replace EPAC Council. The members of this small1 group<br />
will include the Treasurer and creative business achievers and<br />
independent-minded individuals who are thinkers and doers. The aim is<br />
to avoid simple interest group representation and to have flexible<br />
. memberskip-afrangements-in order-to -keep -the ideas flowing. I will chair<br />
the Group and relevant Ministers will be invited to attend. The Group will<br />
give attention to the possible role for the Government on key strategic<br />
issues and to links to broader social concerns. Initial composition of the<br />
Group will be announced soon when members have agreed to their<br />
appointments. 72/ 94 </p>
<p>I thank all present and past members of the EPAC Council for their<br />
contribution to developing our medium and longer-term thinking and<br />
policy. I will be. meeting with many of these members in the numerous<br />
other fora which have emerged for interchange of views, and I look<br />
forward to those continuing associations.<br />
Turning to the Office of EPAC, it is my intention that its widely respected<br />
work in producing public reports on medium and longer-term issues<br />
should continue. For many today, the name of EPAC is associated more<br />
with these studies than with the meetings of Council. The small group of<br />
past and present staff of the Office of EPAC deserve credit for this<br />
achievement. The acronym EPAC will continue with the re-establishment of the Office<br />
of EPAC as the Eoaomic Planning Advisory Commission. The<br />
Commission will continue to publish accessible and authoritative studies<br />
as in the past, but I wish the opportunity to be taken to develop a more<br />
thematic focus, with EPAC producing fewer but high quality reports. For<br />
1994-95 the Commission will look at three themes of fundamental<br />
importance for Australia's medium and longer-term future: Globalisation,<br />
Investment and Growth, and Work Patterns.<br />
In addition, I am asking Professor Glenn Withers, the head of EPAC, to<br />
establish a capacity for related special projects which will allow EPAC to<br />
broaden the range of its activities to include provision of policy advice on<br />
medium-term issues in selected areas. EPAC will retain its wellestablished<br />
role in co-ordinating for the Commonwealth submissions on<br />
the Budget by business, trade union and community groups and reporting<br />
publicly on their content. It will also strengthen public discussion on<br />
medium and long-term issues through seminars and conferences.<br />
In particular I am asking EPAC to convene a major conference on Long-<br />
Term National Strategies to be held in Sydney on November 24-25. This<br />
Government has long taken a farsighted view of the country's direction<br />
and has acted upon that. At the same time, it is appropriate that we<br />
take stock periodically beyond the immediate political arena. The<br />
Government-has a--commitment-to hearing-broad debate before policy<br />
decisions are made. This Conference will do this and will itself help<br />
define the longer-term work program for EPAC. More details of this<br />
Conference will be announced soon. </p>
<p>Finally, I intend that the Commission be able to undertake task force<br />
work on suitable projects as requested by Government. These could<br />
cover a. wide variety of topics with a medium-term focus. They would<br />
mainly be directed at reporting over 3-6 months periods and tapping the<br />
best talent from outside the public service, including as task force heads,<br />
and obtaining transfer or secondment of top expertise from within the<br />
public service. The projects may often have a sharper policy focus than<br />
for regular EPAC studies, but will still benefit from EPAC's remove from<br />
policy implementation responsibilities. I will announce the initial projects<br />
of this kind shortly.<br />
The Commission will be responsible to the Prime Minister, as is the<br />
present Office of EPAC.<br />
The changes I have announced today will increase still further the<br />
contributions to be made by EPAC in identifying the issues underpinning<br />
our future, for filtering the arguments and evidence and for discussing<br />
the issues in a balanced and authoritative way. I also look forward to<br />
meeting with the new " Economic Round-Table" as a new source of<br />
insights for the Government.<br />
