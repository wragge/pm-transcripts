    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to announce that Mr Paul McClintock will become the new head of the Cabinet Policy Unit and Secretary to Cabinet.  This appointment is effective from 10 July 2000.  Mr McClintock will be replacing Michael L’Estrange who is shortly to take up his duties as Australia’s High Commissioner to the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>Mr McClintock has extensive experience in Government and the private sector.  A graduate of Arts and Law (University of Sydney), he practised as a solicitor with Freehill, Hollingdale and Page (Sydney) and in London.  Since 1985 he has been a principal and director of the private investment banking firm, McClintock Associates.  He has considerable experience as chairman and director of companies, public sector bodies and non-profit associations.  He has an extensive knowledge of business in Asia and is the immediate past president of the Australia-Malaysia Business Council.</p>
<p>His experience in Government includes 2½ years as my senior private secretary when I was Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, Minister for Special Trade Negotiations and Treasurer.  A copy of Mr McClintock’s curriculum vitae is attached.</p>
<p>As Secretary to Cabinet Mr McClintock will be responsible for supervising Cabinet processes, ensuring appropriate follow-up to Cabinet decisions and providing strategic directions in policy formulation.  He will have a coordinating role in medium term policy development to ensure that Government policies and programmes are consistent with the Government’s overall aims and objectives.</p>
<p>I believe that Mr McClintock’s broad-based experience, commitment and strategic skills will be very valuable to the Government in the period ahead.</p>
