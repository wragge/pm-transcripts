PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA MONDAY, 7 JUNE 1982<br />
OPENING OF KAKADU NATIONAL PARK HEADQUARTERS<br />
It gives me great pleasure to be here today to open the<br />
headquarters building for Kakadu National Park. I first<br />
visited here many years before the National Park was established<br />
in 1979, and I have come back whenever I could.<br />
In earlier years, I found time to stay here for a day or two and<br />
I came to appreciate something of its fragile and unique<br />
beauty and the importance of the area to Australia and to the<br />
world. A visitor can come here for a few hours and enjoy the<br />
spectacle of the Arnhemland escarpment, or the Wetlands,<br />
or the floodplains. Or one can return for longer periods at<br />
different times of the year and experience a deeper appreciation<br />
and enjoyment. The face of the Kakadu changes with the<br />
seasons, frora the summer monsoons to the dry spring, the<br />
park is home for a vast array and variety of wildlife.<br />
Kakadu also has another dimension. It is a store of cultural<br />
values, greatly significant to aboriginal people and important<br />
to all of us. The park is full of sacred and significant<br />
places. When such features are identified and pointed out,<br />
even people who have no direct cultural ties with them can<br />
begin to glimpse the relationship which has grown over<br />
thousands of years between a people and their ancient land.<br />
As a national park Kakadu ranks with the finest in the world.<br />
The Government nominated it for the world heritage list not only<br />
for its natural values, but also for its cultural importance.<br />
And as many of you will be aware, Kakadu was accepted by the<br />
World Heritage Committee meeting in Australia last September,<br />
the first national park in Australia to be so honoured.<br />
At the same time, the Great ? 1rrier Reef and the Willandra Lakes<br />
area of New South Wales were also placed on the World Heritage<br />
List. Kakadu contains some of the most important wetlands in<br />
Australia and with this in mind the Government declared Kakadu<br />
a " Wetland of Interijetional Importance" in accordance with our<br />
obligations under the Convention on Wetlands of international<br />
Importance especially as waterfowl habitat. / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
Kakadu National Park owes its existence in its present form to<br />
an unprecedented action by the traditional aboriginal owners<br />
of the area. These people, in laying claim to the land now<br />
comprising the Park, indicated that if their claim was granted<br />
they would be prepared to lease the land to the Commonwealth<br />
Government for the purposes of a national park for the benefit<br />
of all Austra. lians. Following the granting of land rights and<br />
detailed negcotiations between the Government and the Northern<br />
Land Council, agreement was reached on the terms and conditions<br />
that would apply to the operation of the Park once it was<br />
established. on 3 November 1978 the Northern Land Council, the<br />
Kakadu Aboricfinal Land Trust and the Director of the Australian<br />
National Parks and Wildlife Service signed an agreement which<br />
set out details of how, the Park would be managed particularly<br />
in relation to aboriginal involvement.<br />
A particularl~ y satisfying aspect of the management of Kakadu<br />
is the involvement of the traditional aboriginal owners. This<br />
involvement obtained not only through employment and training<br />
but also through the detailed consultation that takes place between<br />
the Parks Ser7vice and the traditional owners on all matters of<br />
significance.. The assistance of the Northern Land Council and<br />
the Gagadju Association in this consultative process, and<br />
the relationships built Up between the parties involved, contribute<br />
much to the success of the Park.<br />
One feature of aboriginal involvement in the Park is the<br />
Aboriginal Ranger Training Program, run by the Australian National<br />
Parks and Wildlife Service. This program, which is required by<br />
the lease ag: ceerent, has received acclaim both nationally and<br />
internationa Lly. It is seen as a most successful initiative<br />
leading, within a reasonable time frame, to a situation where<br />
most of the senior positions in the park will be heldby aboriginals.<br />
I understand that we have with us today representatives of the<br />
South Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service who, with<br />
representatives of the aboriginal people having ties to the<br />
Gammon Ranges National Park are spending a ' week in Kakadu looking<br />
at the training program and at aboriginal involvement generally.<br />
At Mr Tonkin ' s request I have agreed that the Australian National<br />
Parks and Wildlife Service will assist their South Australian<br />
counterparts in establishing a similar program in the Gammon<br />
Ranges National Park. I hope that the visit by these officers<br />
will be fruitful, and that the experience gained in Kakadu over<br />
the last three years will be of assistance elsewhere in Australia.<br />
Kakadu is a magnificent national park. It is an outstanding<br />
addition to our system of national parks, which is one of the<br />
oldest in the world, dating back more than 100 years. And, in<br />
the five years to June 1981, the area of national parkland in<br />
Australia more than doubled, to more than 31 million hectares,<br />
with new national parks in every state and territory of<br />
Australia 31 million hectares: more than the entire area of<br />
the State of Victoria. / 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
I want to refer more broadly to environmental protection, and<br />
the unrivalled record that we have achieved. We prohibited<br />
sand mining on Fraser Island; we have banned whaling completely;<br />
we have substantially increased grants and research in<br />
marine science; we are progressively declaring sections of the<br />
Great Barrier Reef marine park. Wehaveworked towards the preservat~ ion<br />
of the Antarctic and the preservation of Antarctic seals; we<br />
have worked t~ o protect migratory birds and for nature<br />
conservation in the South Pacific; we were the first Party to sign<br />
the Convention on Wetlands of International Importance; we<br />
have assisted in the establishment of the World Wildlife Fund<br />
in Australia and before Federal Parliament now is a special<br />
wildlife prot~ ection bill to bring together the export controls<br />
which protec-: Australia's unique wildlife.<br />
only two days ago, on World Environment bay, I launched the<br />
Australian Year of the Tree and announced that the Government<br />
would initiate a national tree program to encourage people<br />
to value trees and to plant and care for them. And, as you<br />
will be aware, the Government is currently conducting an<br />
information -campaign across the nation to educate Attstralians<br />
to protect a. nd conserve their natural environment.<br />
Governments must be concerned with the preservation of Australia's.<br />
natural environment, and at the same time with the necessary<br />
balance between development and conservation and the reconciliation<br />
of competing land uses and this is very much the position in this<br />
part of Australia. Aboriginal interests and those of tourists,<br />
conservationists, researchers, miners and others all have to<br />
be considered. Our success in harmonising competing interests;<br />
will reflect the quality and sensitivity of the management<br />
applied in areas such as this Park and it will also reflect on<br />
our maturity as a nation. In the last three years, a great<br />
deal has been done at Kakadu, improving road access'and<br />
providing facilities for staff and visitors and producing a<br />
range of informative material.<br />
The Commonwealth is very conscious of the growing importance of<br />
toursim in the Northern Territory. I understand that the<br />
tourist industry has welcomed the workshops and seminars<br />
conducted by park staff. Similarly, the Park Service has<br />
provided courses and seminars for the staff of mining companies<br />
to inform them of the biological and cultural values of the Park<br />
and to seek their co-operation in protecting those values.<br />
This building is very much part of the process. It provides an~<br />
administrative centre for the Park operation and is an information<br />
centre for visitors.<br />
I understand that several people concerned with the design and<br />
constructiona are here today, and I would like to congratulate<br />
you on how well you have succeeded in creating a complex that<br />
fits in with, rather than intrudes upon, the environment.<br />
Congratulations should also be extended to the staff in the<br />
Park who have worked so hard and so successfully to get everything<br />
ready for today. I fully appreciate the time and the effort<br />
needed to maintain this standard in such a climate. / 4 </p>

Of course, Kakadu is a great inspiration. I am confident that<br />
the commitment of the Government and the dedication of<br />
everyone associated with Kakadu will ensure that this priceless<br />
part of our national heritage is passed safely to future<br />
generations of Australians.<br />
ThankyouMr Wilson for inviting me to officially open this<br />
fine building, I am proud and delighted to do so to unveil<br />
this commemorative plaque and declare the Kakadu National<br />
Park Headquarters officially open. </p>
