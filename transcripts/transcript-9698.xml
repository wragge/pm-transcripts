PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
THE WITHDRAWAL OF THEO THEOPHANOUS MP FROM BATMAN<br />
I warmly welcome the selfless decision of Theo<br />
Theophanous to withdraw from the pre-selection contest<br />
for the seat of Batman, thereby giving the nomination to<br />
Mr Martin Ferguson unopposed.<br />
I know that this was 4. a very difficult decision for Mr<br />
Theophanous to make, and a sacrifice for someone who<br />
obviously has very substantial support in the ALP<br />
branches in Batman. There is no doubt this action is<br />
motivated by what he believes is in best interests of the<br />
Labor Party.<br />
I should also like to echo these sentiments for the<br />
decision taken on Friday by Ms Jenny Mikakos.<br />
Theo Theophanous has already made an important<br />
contribution to the. Labor Party. His standing in the<br />
Victorian Parliament and community is strong and he has a<br />
big role to play facing a conservative government as the<br />
Leader of the Opposition in the Upper House in Victoria.<br />
In the event that an-opportunity arises for Mr<br />
Theophanous to join the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party<br />
in the future, I should welcome that and the contribution<br />
he would make.<br />
