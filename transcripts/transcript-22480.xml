    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Leader of the Opposition's latest attempt to attack the job-creating workplace relations reforms have been exposed as yet another fabrication.</p>
<p>In a confused opinion piece the Leader of the Opposition claimed that the workers engaged in industrial action at Boeing in Newcastle had faced 'devastating consequences' because of the WorkChoices laws.  He said they were just 'some of the casualties' of the reforms.</p>
<p>The regrettable truth for Mr Beazley is that the Boeing dispute began and ended before the WorkChoices laws became operational.</p>
<p>A quick phone call to Bill Shorten would have revealed this fact.</p>
<p>The Leader of the Opposition's ongoing scare campaign against these reforms continues to include clear fabrications. A matter of weeks ago the Office of Workplace Services found that the claims in the ACTU's 'real people real stories' advertisements were misleading and on several occasions questions in Parliament have been found to be based on misleading information.</p>
<p>The pattern of deceit continues with the Boeing example.</p>
<p>Here are the facts since WorkChoices began:</p>
<p> 175,000 new jobs - 85 per cent of which are fulltime;   industrial disputes at the lowest levels ever recorded; and   real wages continuing to rise.</p>
<p>Mr Beazley continues to mislead the public in an attempt to dodge scrutiny of his economically disastrous roll-back plans for the Australian economy.</p>
