PRIME MINISTER<br />
CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER OF AUSTRALIA<br />
THE HON. R. J. L. HIAWKE, AC, NP<br />
JOINT MEETING OF THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS<br />
WASHINGTON -23 JUNE 1988<br />
Mr Speaker<br />
Mr President<br />
Members of Congress<br />
Friends By inviting me to speak today to the Congress of the United<br />
States you honour not only the Prime Minister of Australia<br />
but all Australians.<br />
Yours is an institution which, down through tho yoars, has<br />
reflected the views and aspirations of the American people<br />
and taken its character from their character. From you I<br />
hear the voico of the Amer ican people and through you I am<br />
able to address the American people. I am most grateful.<br />
Mr Speaker,<br />
The concept of government of the peo-ple, by the people and<br />
for the people is as potent today as it was two centuries ago<br />
when that remarkable collection of farmers, lawyers, traders<br />
and intellectuals met in Philadelphia to craft a<br />
constitution. Although democracy is not the guiding precept<br />
of government in most nations, it is, assuredly, the guiding<br />
precept in those nations which have nuccessfully delivered to<br />
their citiz. ens a decent quality ot lite and a higih standard<br />
of living. As we approach the 21st century no nation can<br />
fail to note that ioxample. The wn; turn democracies can 1h'ad<br />
with self conf idence and have no oitcd of self doubt. " 145;--</p>
<p>To be exposed to the vigour of tho Australian political<br />
process is to realise that the underlying values of our<br />
political system are identical to your own. To say that<br />
there is debate in our Par3. iamont, our media and among the<br />
Australian people would be roughly the equivalent ot saying<br />
that when the Redskins and the Cowboys get together all thats<br />
involved is a friendly game ol. football a fairly<br />
considerable understatement.<br />
it is common values,, going to the heart of our view of<br />
mankind and of society, which form the enduring basis of our<br />
relationship. Social and political circumstances may change;<br />
governments of various persuasions come and go; economies<br />
adjust and transform; inte'rnational conditions ovolvo.<br />
American and Australian views and interests may at times<br />
diverge. But it is the values of individual liberty,<br />
equality before the law and the supremacy of people ovor the<br />
State to which we can always with confidence return as a<br />
powerful uniting force.<br />
If it is this that gives our relationship its ultimate<br />
strength and stability, it is individual contact between<br />
Australians and Americans which provides the special warmth.<br />
There is an ease of contact1 a roadiness to trust and an<br />
enjoyment of each others company which readily transcends<br />
differences.<br />
With the benefit of 200 years of hindsight I can acknowledge<br />
a debt which Australians owe Americans, although it must<br />
hardly have seemed something to thank you for at the time.<br />
In denying Britain a convenient repository here for the<br />
convicts overflowing British jails, your revolutionary<br />
forebears of six or seven generations ago provoked the<br />
decision to send convicts to Australia instead. it you were<br />
founded by the Pilgrim fathers, the founders of Australia<br />
were decidedly the prodigal sons.<br />
But when the First Fleet arrived in New South Wales in 1788,<br />
its human cargo of convicts and prison guards in fact began<br />
the creation not of a prison but of a nation.<br />
Our harsh beginnings required all the same grit and<br />
determination which marked the exploration, settlement and<br />
development of the United States. Two centuries later in<br />
this, our Bicentennial year we have, like you, a nation<br />
proud of the multicultural diversity of. its people and of our<br />
national achievements. Our country is tho s. ize of the<br />
continental United States with, however, only ( Alin population<br />
of Texas. 1 know Mr Speaker, that, at Texan you would aqrc. v<br />
of course, that that. iu ai any country needs.<br />
We have also built a nation more acuttly aware than ever<br />
before of the precious heritaqu of. the original Australians,<br />
the Aboriginal people who populated the land tor 40,000 years<br />
before the European arrival. 5) 3 </p>
<p>The American contribution to our Bicentennial celebrations<br />
has added a special dimension to our relationship. If I were<br />
to describe it in all its dotail I fear 1 would be accused,<br />
at least under Senate rules, oi a filibuster.<br />
Let me just say that we greatly we]. come the opportunity to<br />
celebrate with a very special triend.<br />
Mr Speaker,<br />
It is because of the deep similarities between our two<br />
nations that my predecessor, Australia's wartime Prime<br />
Minister John Curtint, was able to declare in 1944 that<br />
Australians looked forward to " an uninterrupted friendship"<br />
with the people of the United States.<br />
Curtin said those words in San Francisco, on his way to talks<br />
with President Franklin Roosevelt concerning the conduct of<br />
the war in which Australians and Americans wore fighting side<br />
by side in defence of liberty in the Pacific.<br />
I wish to state clearly that Australia and the United States<br />
are not just friends; we are allies. when my Government,<br />
assumed office 5 years ago we determined that the ANZUS<br />
alliance clearly served Australian interests. That alliance<br />
is stronger, and the commitment of Australians to it greater,<br />
for its having been thought about rather than merely assumed.<br />
We never wanted the alliance to be merely an inheritance from<br />
a past era, a piece of history gathering dust, but a dynamic<br />
arrangement serving the modern needs of both sides. And it<br />
does. The United States has every right to see alliances as two way<br />
streets, to expect that allies will carry their weight. I<br />
assure you that Australia is and will remain such an ally.<br />
We welcome your ships and aircraft to our ports and<br />
airfields. There is intimate co-operation between us in<br />
joint exercises, intelligence exchange, defence science and<br />
technology, communications and logistics, and training. we<br />
are one of the top cash purchasors of defence equipment from<br />
the United States.<br />
we host joint facilities important to the central strategic<br />
balance between the United States and the Soviet Union,<br />
facilities which have additional significance in the new<br />
phase of East-West relations through their contribution to<br />
arms control.<br />
We support a strong American involvement in Asia and Iho<br />
Pacific, and believe that your bases in the Philippinuu makin<br />
a crucial contribution to uteurity and vonlfidetico in our<br />
region. " 14 54 </p>
<p>4<br />
My Government has conducted the most thorough review of<br />
Australian defence policy in many years. Our policy<br />
emphasises the shouldering of our own responsibilities<br />
defence sel1f reliance, modurnisation, regional commitment and<br />
the development of strong, independent military capabilities<br />
within the framework 01. the allianco.<br />
our economic relationship with you is also vitally important.<br />
You are our second largest trading partner, supplying over<br />
201 of Australia's total imports and taking over 101 of our<br />
total exports. The trade relationship is about 2 to 1 in<br />
your favour. You are our largest single source of foreign<br />
investment. As our economy divorsiiies away from primary<br />
production and we strengthen our position as an exporter of<br />
manufactures and services, the business opportunities for<br />
America in Australia will expand still further. So again the<br />
benefits are very much two-way.<br />
Mr Speaker,<br />
You can therefore see why we believe our relationship<br />
entitles us to a fair go in our-trade with the United States<br />
and in competition with the United States in third markets;<br />
not, I emphasise, special favours, but a Lair go.<br />
This is not the occasion to make detailed representations<br />
about particular export commodities. But it would be wrong<br />
of me, here in Congress, to pretend that within our otherwise<br />
excellent relationship trade is not an area of very real<br />
concern to us.<br />
I should say to you, with the frankness which I trust is<br />
permitted to a friend, that some of the decisions made in<br />
Washington intended to defend the interests of Americans have<br />
turned out to hurt Australians.<br />
In particular Australia's primary producers are unsubsidised<br />
and are among the most efficient in the world, and yet we are<br />
finding ourselves squeezed out ot markets by practices which<br />
distort prices and levels of production. in agriculture we<br />
find ourselves caught in the crossfire of a destructive and<br />
counter-productive traits-Atlantic subsidies war.<br />
The statistics are graphic since your Export Enhancement<br />
Program has been operating, America's share of the world<br />
wheat market has jumped from 29 per cent to 43 per cent, the<br />
Europuan Community's share hav. fallen only a little irom 17<br />
per cent to 14 per cent, but Aust~ ralia' s share has slumped<br />
from 20 per cent Lo 1. per cent.<br />
The subsidies war is costing us atigd I mean both oi us not<br />
just. economically. Thorn in. isl; o an impact, a damaging<br />
impact, upon the perceptions which Australians have of the<br />
major trading powers, the linitud iincluded. 7<br />
1 7 </p>
<p>Australians must not be given reason to believe that while we<br />
are first class allies, we are, in trade, second class<br />
friends. Trade issues must not be allowed to tester, or to<br />
erode our wider friendship or alliance.<br />
I want to emphasise Australia's appreciation of the way in<br />
which we have been able to express our concerns to you. It<br />
is important that when we knock on doors In this city.<br />
including in Congress, those dooru continue to open.<br />
For the test of good United States/ Australia relations is not<br />
that as individuals or governments we agree on everything.<br />
It is, rather, that we are in accord on matters of basic<br />
principle and that where we disagroo we do so with civility<br />
and respeattfor the others point of view. I am proud to say<br />
that the relationship between our countries is now regarded<br />
on. both sides as being as warm, close and productive as it<br />
has ever been. And our relationship has a greater maturity<br />
than it has ever had before.<br />
Mr Speaker,<br />
All of us sense, I think, that the world we grew up with,<br />
whose shape emerged after the Second World War, is changing<br />
in some fundamental ways. New centres of economic power are<br />
emerging; there is less rigidity in the Eastern bloc; the<br />
familiar pattern of East-West strategic competition is often<br />
overlaid by a new pattern of economic competition within the<br />
West. Though we cannot yet soo the fine detail, the blurred<br />
outlines of the 21st century now only twelve years away<br />
are becoming sharper..<br />
What sort of world will it be? When I look at the<br />
international environment, when 1 talk to the leadership of<br />
major powers like the United States, the Soviet Union and<br />
China or countries in Australia's Asia-Pacific ioighbourhood,<br />
I am generally encouraged by what 1 see. There have been few<br />
enough times in recent decades when it has been possible to<br />
permit ourselves a degree of optimism about the world's<br />
future. But this, I think, Is such a time.<br />
The Soviet Union is undergoing far reaching changes. The<br />
domestic reforms introduced by General Secretary Gorbachev<br />
are the most hopeful sign in that part of the world in the<br />
period since 1917. Where they will eventually lead whether<br />
they will even succeed we cannot tell.. L~ ike (.(! otioCmic<br />
reformers Mr Gorbachov faces the classic dilemmna that the<br />
pain always comes bviore the benefits. Hut the direction ini<br />
which he is heading is encouraging. " 14 5I </p>
<p>Certainly we must withhold iinal judgement about the extent<br />
of change in Soviet foreign policy. We want to see deeds not<br />
just words. But there is unquestionably ground for hope. We<br />
are surely better off with a Soviet Union which has accepted<br />
that it must get out of Afghanistan than we were with the<br />
Soviet Union which originally invaded that country.<br />
We have seen the first ever arms control agreement which<br />
makes real cuts in the nuclear arsenals of the two super<br />
powers. We see and strongly support prospects for<br />
further reductions. The West is now engaging the East in<br />
dialogue across a wide range and at the highest leadership<br />
levels, but not on the basis of naivety or weakness. I pay<br />
tribute to the role which President Reagan has played with<br />
the invaluable support of the Congress at the centre stage<br />
of this process.<br />
China's continuing economic growth and its leaders'<br />
commitment to modernisation mark the emergence of that<br />
country from a barren period of upheaval and introspection.<br />
This is a development of historic importance, tremendously<br />
beneficial to regional and global stability.<br />
Significant parts of the third world, particularly in Asia<br />
and the Pacific, are experiencing dynamic economic growth.<br />
In parts of the third world there have, too, bon significant<br />
advances for democracy. We acknowledge in particular the<br />
victory over autocracy in the Philippines, and democratic<br />
reform in the Republic of Korea.<br />
And so, Mr Speaker, although competition between nations and<br />
alliance systems will not disappear we believe in our own<br />
values too strongly for that we can be allowed to hope that<br />
we are entering a period when such competition will be<br />
channelled into loss dangerous paths.<br />
But no man or woman who has lived in the 20th century can<br />
fail to understand how quickly, and how disastrously, change<br />
can come. We still face many dangers and challenges.<br />
Intractable and tragic conflicts persist in the Middle East<br />
and Southern Africa; famine, war and disease still haunt<br />
many parts of the third world; hundreds of millions of<br />
people lack the freedom and human rights we Lake for granted<br />
in our countries; recent events have even disrupted the<br />
relative tranquility of the South Pacific.<br />
So we must a] wayn remembuir t. hat iot. hinqg i! preordain id. The<br />
future doe not ju; t. happon Lo t; We make the iuture. And<br />
if we are to make it well, we need to remain engaged with the<br />
world, willing to struggle with its problems and to take our<br />
part in solving them. We live iii intirdp,! ndotnt world and<br />
we don't have the practical uptioti or ind md thi moral<br />
option of sittinq it out. I </p>
<p>That is why Austra] Ja concerns i~ tqelf with issues like arms<br />
control and the obscenity of apartheid in South Africa. it<br />
is also why we are members oi the alliance.<br />
Mr speaker,<br />
Some Americans seem to be apprehensive about the changes thoy<br />
see around them in the world.<br />
This is not surprising. Changes which alter familiar, and<br />
comfortable, relativities in economic and political power and<br />
familiar patterns of behaviour will always cause uncertainty<br />
and sometimes resentment. And the international system as we<br />
know it is very largely an American creation. The<br />
institutions, alliances and programs which characterise the<br />
system emerged from the generosity ot thi~ s country and the<br />
farsightedness of your statesmen, including many members of<br />
the Congress. The World Bank, the Marshal Plan, NATO, ANZUS,<br />
modern multilateral diplomacy: all of thorn are, in part, and<br />
in many cases in large part, your creation. We were all the<br />
beneficiaries of that impulse towards internationalism.<br />
So where change has come, it has often been because of the<br />
success of American policies, because you have achieved what<br />
you set out to do. It is because your policies worked that<br />
Japan, Western Europe, the Republic of Korea and others are<br />
now strong and prosperous.<br />
In any case particular global changes have often been<br />
overstated. Portraits of a ' declining' Unitod States have<br />
drawn upon beguilingly simplo but very misleading indices of<br />
comparison, whether of GNP or net indebtedness. Moreover the<br />
trends have been portrayed as continuing inexorably. That is<br />
nonsense, and un-American in its determinism. With the right<br />
policies, this country will remain the world's largest and<br />
moot important economy as far ahead as I or anyone else can<br />
se.' I put it to you therefore that we need not and must not<br />
pormit our view of the world to be conditioned by some kind<br />
of creeping pessimism and dulling fatalism. As analysin that<br />
would be deeply flawedf; as a policy prescription,<br />
potentially disastrous. Put bluntly, the United States and<br />
other Western nations, esp~~ cially the major actors on the<br />
world stage, must not behave in way,, that could turn some of<br />
the presently fashionable theories of decline into self<br />
fulfilling prophecies.<br />
Mr Speaker,<br />
Nowhere is this more clear than at Lhoe vji. l intersection of<br />
international economics and inLtilat. iorial utrategy. 7 4 U_ </p>
<p>The cost of failure to resolve present economic tensions In<br />
the world would be measurable not only in dollars and cents.<br />
It would be measurable in tho acccntuation oL destructive<br />
differences within the western alliance, and third world<br />
instability. we must understand that t. Lronger world economic<br />
and trade growth is a fundamental foreign policy objective.<br />
It is ultimately a national security objective.<br />
The greatest obstacle to that objective is the persistence of<br />
large current account imbalances in the three major<br />
economies; the United States, Japan and West Germany. This<br />
remains true despite certain trade statistics beginning to<br />
move in the right direction. The origin of the trade<br />
imbalances lies in turn, to a significant extent, in tho<br />
divergent fiscal and monetary policies pursued by the United<br />
States on the one hand and Japan and West Germany on the<br />
other through the 1980s.<br />
Now I know that these issues of economic and trade policy are<br />
contentious ones within the-United States, including within<br />
this Congress. I have no intention of taking sides. You<br />
have enough political candidates already in 1988.<br />
But they are issues with demonstrable impact upon, and<br />
therefore clear relevance to, other countries, Australia<br />
included. It is in that spirit that I ask you to take my<br />
comments. The inescapable reality is that adjustment of economic<br />
imbalances will occur. It is only a question of how they<br />
occur. The adjustment can be forced by market pressures upon<br />
reluctant governments or it can come through deliberate<br />
strategies to enhance world growth and maximise the<br />
individual and collective trading opportunities of all<br />
countries. It is clearly in the interests of all of us that the world's<br />
major economies opt for strategies of the latter kind. And<br />
this means a deliberate decision by them, the United States<br />
included. to reverse the corruption I can use no lesser<br />
word of the world trading system, combined with an equally<br />
deliberate commitment to make appropriate adjustments in<br />
domestic economic policies.<br />
I am not saying that the burden ol. adjustme'nt rests solely on<br />
the United States and I am not -sayitiy that you have no reason<br />
for frustration and complaint about the trade practices ot<br />
others. I can understand your objections to Lte barriers the<br />
United States faces to iL!; exportsi in certain markets.<br />
Australians can understand the pirub~) tms precisely because<br />
we share them.<br />
In the Uruguay roun~ d of multilateral trade neqotiations. the<br />
vehicle is at hand to noqotiate a new, fairer and liboralined<br />
environment for world trade. ' 7 It) 1 </p>
<p>9.<br />
This crucial negotiation confronts us with a test of our<br />
collective common sense; whether we will rucognise that any<br />
attempt to solve our national trading problems at the expense<br />
of others, rather than through pursuit of the common<br />
wellbeing. must ultimately be self destructive.<br />
It is this same enlightened self interest which dictates that<br />
we accept rather than oppose the need for adjustment in our<br />
own economies. What a sad irony if, at the very moment in<br />
history when we are seeing the belated recognition by the<br />
planned economies of the need to accept the relevance of<br />
market signals in their decision making, the Western nations<br />
were to try to ignore and distort those signals, both at home<br />
and in the international marketplace.<br />
In Australia we have practised the doctrine ot economic<br />
adjustment, not merely preached it.<br />
We have pursued the domestic economic policies necessary to<br />
cure our own external imbalance. We have converted a<br />
prospective fiscal deficit amounting to 5 percent of GDP just<br />
five years ago to a prospective, surplus of 1 percent or more<br />
in the coming fiscal year. We have implemented reforms to<br />
deregulate industry, lift productivity and innovation,<br />
promote an export culture and encourage foreign investment on<br />
fair terms. We are prepared to show the lead on tariff<br />
reform. We will be cutting tariffs by about 30 percent on<br />
average over, the next four years. Much larger reductions in<br />
protection will occur for the most highly protected<br />
industries.<br />
Now you are practising politicians and so am 1. I understand<br />
constituency interests. 1 know that the adjustment process<br />
is not easy. But it must be done.<br />
The costs of failure will be very high; the rewards of<br />
success enormous.<br />
Speaking to you as the closest of friends and allies,<br />
therefore, my message is that United Status' action now can<br />
play a decisive role in the future shape of the! world economy<br />
if you grasp the challenge of adjuutmont at home and drive<br />
with determination tor the liberalisation of trade on a<br />
global basis. America cani do the world, and itnnfl, no<br />
greater service at this time.<br />
Mr Speaker,<br />
I have not tho slightest doubt oL the unique capability oL<br />
the United States for leader; hip, whether in wantaging the<br />
pivotal relationship wit. h the Soviet Union, mainLaining the<br />
health of tho western al] iaticu, forqing further agreemouts in<br />
the essential area of arms : ont. rol. sceking solutions to<br />
regional issuen such as the Middle East. a~ td Southern Airica,<br />
or resolving international economic problems. ' Y/ i~ U) </p>
<p>If this sounds liko a tall order, and an unfair bur * den, we do<br />
not look to tho United States to solve all the-se problems<br />
alone or to mount the effort without the help of frionds. We<br />
ask only that the United States continue to contribute the<br />
strength, persistence, creativity and breadth ol vision which<br />
to the immense benefit of mankind have boon the hallmarks<br />
of the American character.<br />
I ami confidont that it will be so. No nation in the world<br />
surpasses the United States in justifiable pride in past<br />
achievements, confidenco that problems can be overcome and<br />
contagious optimism about the future. Neither oL us would<br />
claim that our nation is without blemish. Neither of us<br />
would claim that governments of our countries have always<br />
chosen wisely or acted woll. But I do !; ay this: that when<br />
all is said and done the United States of America is a great<br />
and a good country; that the people of the United States of<br />
America are a great and a good people; and that in Australia<br />
you will have in the years ahead the best kind of friend<br />
independent to be sure, forthright in defence of our own<br />
interests certainly, but also firmly supportive and deeply<br />
proud of our rich and enduring relationship.<br />
