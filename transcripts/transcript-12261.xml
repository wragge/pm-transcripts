The Federal Coalition will contribute $2 million toward the $5.4 million cost of building a heavy vehicle bypass around the Queanbeyan central business district.<br />
The bypass, known as the Northern Upgrade, will link East Queanbeyan with Canberra Avenue via the Oaks Estate in the Australian Capital Territory. The majority of the roadworks will be on the ACT side of the border.<br />
The bypass will divert up to 45 percent of the heavy vehicle traffic that currently uses Monaro Street, making the Queanbeyan business district a more attractive and safer place to work and shop.<br />
My announcement today is part of our future action plan to build the Headquarters Australian Theatre (HQAST) on the King';s Highway outside Queanbeyan.<br />
About 1,000 service personnel will work in the new headquarters complex, which will involve an investment of about $200 million in equipment and buildings. The construction of the complex will inject $150 million into the Queanbeyan economy and will create up to 250 jobs.<br />
The Liberal Member for Eden-Monaro, Gary Nairn, was instrumental in the Coalition';s decision to build the headquarters complex and to fund the Northern Upgrade. Gary is a superb MP and has done a great job representing Eden-Monaro.<br />
The Coalition';s funding for the bypass will be available in 2002-03, and will need to be matched by the New South Wales and ACT Governments. The funding will be drawn from the existing roads program.</p>
