F76/ 169<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS AUGUST-17, 1976<br />
MOTION OF CONDOLENCE LORD CASEY<br />
Richard Gardiner Casey died on 18 June.<br />
In the history of our country few men have attracted, or earned,<br />
the respect due and paid to Lord Casey. Not only was his public<br />
contribution one of great distinction and lasting value.<br />
He was also a man of integrity and enormous commionsense.<br />
He was the kind of man who imparted stature to the institutions<br />
he served. The Australian people can count themselves immensely<br />
fortunate to have had him as a servant over such a long period.<br />
When I became a Member of this Parliament in 1955 I found that<br />
Dick Casey was always prepared to listen and to help. One of his<br />
great qualities was that he was always prepared to assist young people<br />
and to share his experience with them.<br />
I first came to know Dick Casey through my famil y. He and my<br />
father were close friends over many years. They grew up together<br />
and went to school and university together.<br />
I recall that they were both interested in automobiles.<br />
Lord Casey was an engineer by training and proud of it. He wanted<br />
to understand how things worked and why, and he always believed<br />
that the more engineers in Parliament the better.<br />
At one stage my father and he became interested in a new engine<br />
designed by A. G. M. Michell. It was typical of Lord Casey that<br />
he would try to help someone with a good idea. They attempted<br />
to promote the engine but were unsuccessful in having it adopted.<br />
One of Lord Casey's most impressive characteristics was his immense<br />
capacity for work. His industry was remarkable and it was this<br />
extraordinary application that enabled him to undertake so<br />
many careers in the course of his lifetime.<br />
He was at one time or another, a soldier, an administrator,<br />
a politician, a diplomat and a Vice-regal personage. In<br />
all of these careers he served with conspicuous success. ./ 2 </p>
<p>In 1914 he volunteered in the A. I. F. and served with*<br />
distinction at Gallipoli and on the western front. He was<br />
mentioned in despatches and for his valour he won the<br />
Distinguished Service Order and a Military Cross. He was<br />
d ischarged in 1919.<br />
From 1924 to 1931 he served his country in the External Affairs<br />
Department as Australian political liaison officer in London.<br />
His political , career commenced in 1931 when he became<br />
a Member of this House for the seat of Corio, a seat he held'<br />
until his first resignation from the Parliament in 1940.<br />
During the period of the Great Depression he served in several<br />
portfolios. Among these he was assistant Federal Treasurer<br />
1933-1935 and Federal Treasurer from 1935 to 1939.<br />
As Treasurer he took an active role in the development of<br />
a national insurance scheme, which for reasons beyond his control<br />
was never implemented.<br />
He was also at this time Minister in charge of the Council for<br />
Scientific and Industrial Research ( 1937-1939) an association<br />
he continued after the war and through his retirement and<br />
one of great lasting benefit to that orgahisation and to the nation.<br />
Casey was a Liberal in the full sense a man of progressive<br />
instincts,, not fearful of change. He welcomed the challenge of<br />
a new circumstance, a new job. He was often ahead of his time<br />
and keen to play a part in defining a new role for his country.<br />
He represented Australia to the world in a critical<br />
period of our history.<br />
In 1940 Casey resigned from the Parliament to become the first<br />
Australian Minister to Washington. He expended great energy<br />
in ensuring that Australia's position was well known to the<br />
American administration and the President at that time.<br />
Mr Roosevelt.<br />
In 1942, at the request of the British Prime Minister, the<br />
late Sir Winston Churchill, Lord Casey assumed the position of<br />
Minister of State for the Middle East and had the rank of Cabinet<br />
Minister in the British War Cabinet. Speaking in the early part<br />
of this decade about the controversy that surrounded his<br />
acceptance of such a post, he remarked that such an appointment<br />
in the Middle East was far more important than the post he<br />
had left in Washington.<br />
He appreciated the need for Australia to recognise that its security<br />
depended on events in a number of areas of the world.<br />
From here in 1943 he took up his first Vice-Regal position as<br />
Governor of Bengal. During his time there, from 1943 to 1946<br />
he experienced at first hand contacts with leaders of the Indian<br />
nation which would stand him in good stead when he assumed<br />
responsibility for Australia's foreign policy. 3 </p>
<p>In 1949 in that vital election for Australia's future<br />
Casey returned to active politics as the representative<br />
for the seat of Latrobe. He held the seat until his<br />
retirement from politics in 1960.<br />
In two tasks he undertook following the 1949 election he<br />
showed again the importance he placed on looking to the<br />
future and his concern that Australia should develop into<br />
a strong outward looking and tolerant nation.<br />
Immediately after the election, he became Minister for Works<br />
and Housing and he continued his involvement with the<br />
C. S. I. R. O. being Minister in charge from 1950 to 1960.<br />
It was in 1951 that he became Minister for External Affairs, and<br />
he held the post until his retirement. Looking ahead, as always,<br />
he worked hard to establish a new set of relationships with the<br />
countries of our -region.<br />
His permanent head at the time has recently recorded that Casey's<br />
statements during his visit to Japan in 1951 " marked the first<br />
, real movement from enmity to close cooperation between Australia<br />
and Japan".<br />
He appreciated the great significance of Australia's location<br />
close to the new states emerging in Asia and moved rapidly<br />
to expand our representation in the region.<br />
Earlier than most, he foresaw the importance of bringing China<br />
in to the international community. He was always a realist<br />
about the world and never feared to see facts as they were.<br />
His advice was wise and his judgement sound.<br />
Lord Casey's career showed that deep patriotism could be<br />
combined with an outward looking and humane international<br />
perspective. In 1965 he assumed a Post for which he was uniquely suitedthe<br />
Governor-Generalship. He had much of value to say. He<br />
used the position to dignify Australia and symbolise the<br />
s tandards of public and private behaviour we should all strive<br />
to achieve.<br />
In his life he was assisted at all time by his wife Lady Caseya<br />
remarkable woman in her own right. She was to him in all of<br />
his careers a great comfort and point of courage. This was<br />
exemplified by her devoted action of daily attendance at his<br />
hospital bed after Lord Casey's serious motor accident in 1974.<br />
Richard Gardiner Casey upheld the highest standards of public life,<br />
and in his private life was unfailingly generous and kindly. What he<br />
achieved he earned by his industry, his courage, his integrity,<br />
and his humanity. He loved Australia and because of his life<br />
we have a better sense of ourselves and what we can become.<br />
To Lady Casey and to her son and daughter I extend on behalf<br />
of the Government my deepest sympathy at the loss of a husband<br />
and father. Australia has lost a devoted servant.<br />
