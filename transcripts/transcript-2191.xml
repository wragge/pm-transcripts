FOR PRESS P. M. No 34/ 1970<br />
PORT AUGUSTA-WHYALLA RAILWAY<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr John Gorton<br />
I am pleased to have signed today an Agreement with the<br />
Premier of South Australia, Mr R. S. Hall, for the building of a<br />
railway between Port Augusta and Whyalla.<br />
( Mr Gorton had announced in his Election Policy Speech that<br />
this railway would be built,<br />
Under the Agreement signed today the railway will be a<br />
standard gauge link to be financed, constructed and operated by the<br />
Commonwealth. The cost of construction and rolling stock is estimated<br />
to be about $ 8 million.<br />
The Agreement provides for the definition of the route, the<br />
provision of fencing, and arrangements for road crossings. The<br />
construction timetable will depend on the results of tenders to be called<br />
in the near future, but it is hoped that the work will be completed by<br />
the end of 1971. The Agreement will take effect after authorising legislation<br />
has been passed by both the Commonwealth and State Parliaments. The<br />
Commonwealth will introduce its legislation in the forthcoming Parliamentary<br />
Session.<br />
