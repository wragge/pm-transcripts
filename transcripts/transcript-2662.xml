the textile and apparel industries and there was a full and thorough<br />
discussion. The Ministers assured the delegation that the Government<br />
was looking closely and sympathetically at the problems of these<br />
industries. The Prime Minister repeated the views he had expressed in<br />
Adelaide last month when he emphasised the Government's recognition<br />
of the important place occupied by manufacturing industries in the<br />
Australian economy. The Prime ninister referred again to the fact<br />
that -the Government was negotiating for voluntary restraint<br />
arrangements with low cost overseas countries in order to ensure<br />
protection for Australian manufacturers of textiles and apparel.<br />
The Prime Minister also commended the efforts of Sir Robert Webster<br />
and the industry itself in recent negotiations to bring about<br />
voluntary restraints by countries exporting to Australia.<br />
