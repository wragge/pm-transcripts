SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE BON F J KEKATING NP<br />
KOREA riORRICR ThADE ASSOCIATIONI<br />
SEOUL MONDAY# 21 JJIE, 1993<br />
It is a great pleasure for me to address this gathering<br />
of business people here in one of the most dynamic and<br />
influential. capitals of the region.<br />
Korea is important to us, of coursei as one of our<br />
biggest trading partners.<br />
But it is important in other ways as well.<br />
Korea is an example of a country which, in recognising<br />
necessity, recognised great opportunities and found the<br />
Way to grasp them.<br />
A country which was determined to re-create itself, which<br />
imagined success in the world and found success.<br />
K~ orea has been an outstanding example of successful<br />
change. An example and an incentive k7uto of course, we are very<br />
different countries and we will find success in different<br />
Ways. in an entirely different cultural, political and<br />
historicat enviizonment, Australia is also undergoing a<br />
radical transformation.<br />
A deregulated economy, a new psychology and new<br />
disciplines in business and industry, a new labour<br />
relations culture, new manufacturing and export<br />
priorities imperatives most of all, a new orientation<br />
towards the region.<br />
Today Australians do business in ways which had not been<br />
imagined a decade ago. And they do much more business in<br />
East Asia.<br />
It has been an epoch-making decade in Australia our<br />
decade of re-definition. And we defining It further.<br />
in recent times Australians have recognised th~ e necessity<br />
to coinpete in the world, to be less reliant Onl </p>

coymodities, to change the idea of Australia from that<br />
of a country which needed to do little more than exploit<br />
its material resources, to one which also exploits its<br />
intellectual resources.<br />
From one which exploits her vast reserves of natural<br />
energy, to one which also calls on the energy of her<br />
people. Change is being vigorously discussed in other realms aS<br />
well: about how to deliver justice to Aboriginal<br />
Australians for instance; about the institutional and<br />
symbolic representations of our nationhood, about<br />
projecting an iuage of Australia which reflects the<br />
modern cultural complexity of Australia, about whether<br />
Australia would be better served by a republican form of<br />
government. In a significant sense all these debates derive from the<br />
same source, namely the recognition of the new realities<br />
facing us and the need to create a new Australia to meet<br />
those realities.<br />
They are all debates about issues which, in the interests<br />
of expediency, or old loyalties and connections, or<br />
because we were for a long time carried along by our<br />
comodities, previous Australian governments and previous<br />
generations were able to ignore or defer.<br />
Today we can't ignore them. We came to understand that<br />
in the 1980c. And the response from Australians has<br />
been, I believe, a reason for pride and confidence.<br />
but in Australia we face new challenges to keep raising<br />
our level of competitiveness, to find the means of<br />
concentrating our national enOrgies: so toO, I know<br />
does Korea have to deal with the challenges of a more<br />
sophisticated economy.<br />
Korea has also been important to us to all of us In the<br />
region fbr the'foresight and skill of its contribution<br />
to the creation of an Asia-Pacific economic community.<br />
It was here in Seoul four years ago that Australia and<br />
Korea launched the initiative that has today become the<br />
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation group.<br />
Two years ago it was again Seoul which hosted the third<br />
meeting of APEC ministers.<br />
When the history of APEC is written it will begin with<br />
that Seoul declaration of 1991 the set of principles<br />
upon which APEC is founded.<br />
Principles of open regionalism, of liberal and expanding<br />
trade connecting the two sides of the Pacific, which<br />
underlie the emerging Asia-Pacific economic comunity. </p>
<p>TEL 3<br />
Over the years the Republic of Korea and Australia have<br />
continued to work closely together on this great<br />
objective of linking the Western Pacific and North<br />
America. The objective of spreading a net of government<br />
understandings and cooperation under the booming growth<br />
of Pacific trade and industry.<br />
In APEC we produce half the world's output.<br />
Already the degree of regional integration is very high.<br />
of our total trade, two thirds is between APEC countries.<br />
We can observe within the Asia-Pacific region all the<br />
signs of an increasingly rapid and unique economic<br />
integration.<br />
We can see shifting patterns of production as labourintensive<br />
industry is relocated to China and Indonesia,<br />
for example; while Singapore and Korea develop newer and<br />
more capital-intensive industries based on services or<br />
new technologies.<br />
We can see successive waves of restructuring as Japanese<br />
industry is forced off-shore by the ever rising yen.<br />
We can see the growth of trade within the same industry,<br />
but between different APIC countries.<br />
We can see the growth of trade within the same<br />
corporation, but again between different APEC countries.<br />
We can see the rapid growth of investment across APEC<br />
borders and the growth in services trade.<br />
The notion that trade policy is only about access for<br />
goods, about tariffs and concessions, is dead.<br />
That is whvy the trade-liberalising agenda being pursued<br />
in APEC is one wich accommodates diversity and which<br />
focuses on changes from which all participants gain.<br />
Today, only four years after the process was launched in<br />
seoul, we have begun to give some real substance to APEC.<br />
There is an APmC secretariat in Singapore with an<br />
executive director and staff.<br />
There are working groups developing agendas of tradeliberalising<br />
reform in oustoms procedures, standards,<br />
health controls, telecommunications data bases and so<br />
forth. There is an APEC Eminent Persons Group, including Korea's<br />
* Kim Mahn Je, presently thinking about ways to deepen our<br />
integration In coming years. 21. Jun. 93 14: 13 No. 011 P. 03/ 10 </p>
<p>TEL: 4<br />
And there Is the ministerial meeting in Seattle in<br />
November. That is a meeting which will give all of us an<br />
opportunity to consolidate our progress and set new goals<br />
-and give the United States an opportunity to think<br />
through its economic and trading relationship with this<br />
side of the Pacific.<br />
So we have come. a long way. in building APEC, but we are<br />
Still only at the beginning of what might be possible.<br />
The integration of markets and production in the region<br />
is so rapid that governments are going to have to work<br />
very hard just to keep up with it.<br />
As our economies become more dependent upon each other it<br />
becomes ever more necessary to lay underneath them the<br />
political nets or cooperation, conflict resolution and<br />
dispute settling.<br />
As I said earlier this year, we should be seeking as our<br />
goal an integrated market which includes Australia and<br />
Now Zealand, the ASEAN countries, the three Chinese<br />
economies, Korea, Japan and North America -a market of<br />
two billion people producing half the world's output*<br />
bound together with harmonised trade rules, harmnonised<br />
investment rules, harmonised standards and certification,<br />
and an agreed way of settling disputes between members.<br />
it would be a market where trade between its members<br />
already accounts for two thirds of their own trade and<br />
where the total exports of the region already account for<br />
per cent of world exports.<br />
it would be an integrated regional market which works<br />
towards commonality and minimum restriction in all areas<br />
in which these can sensibly be advanced.<br />
That is sovething beao nd the initial APEC information<br />
sharing,~ trade 1 bral Lsing agenda to a true economic<br />
comuniy.<br />
All it takes is mutual agreement that it should be done,<br />
and the time and intelligence of governments to decide on<br />
appropriate standards, the appropriate forms of mutual<br />
recognition, the appropriate harmonisation of conflicting<br />
rules* There are great opportunities, but right now there are<br />
zany challenges to Asia-Pacific economic COOPeration.<br />
There are the bilateral trade negotiations between Japan<br />
and the United States# which require great sensitiVity<br />
and imagination on both sides. TEL: 21. Jun. 93 14: 13 No. 011 P. 04/ 10 </p>
<p>i-I<br />
I LL<br />
There is the end game in the Uruguay ikound, which means<br />
so much to the future of the world trading system on<br />
which Pacific prosperity is based.<br />
There is the lateat yen appreciation, which may see<br />
another wave of restructuring of Japan's industry<br />
throughout the region.<br />
Within a few months we will have the rminent Persons<br />
Group report and the November APEC meeting, which will<br />
set out goals for the organisation over the next few<br />
years. We will be looking at the possibility of a framework<br />
agreement which will formalise the objectives and process<br />
of APEC, and strengthen the structure of government<br />
understandings underpinning the has-Pacific economic<br />
community.<br />
We will be looking, too, at a work program designed to<br />
remove obstacles which business people encounter in trade<br />
within the region.<br />
Finally, there is the need for a meeting of Pacific<br />
leaders to give greater weight and authority to the APEC<br />
agenda. It the United States administration moves to host such a<br />
meeting this year, we should all be delighted to attend.<br />
Above all we would like to convey to the United States<br />
the message that the Asia-Pacific region represents much<br />
less a threat than an extraordinary opportunity: Duch<br />
less An area of difficulty than one of almost limitless<br />
potential. it is very much in the interests of all Western Pacific<br />
countries that the United States sees things this way.<br />
There is a great deal to be done, and I know from my<br />
talks with-Presioent Kim that Australia and Korea<br />
continue to find ourselves in close agreement on the main<br />
issues bef ore um.<br />
In a way this alliance between our two countries to<br />
advance the creation of an Asia-Pacific economic<br />
community is less surprising than it seems.<br />
True, we are at opposite ends of the Pacific.<br />
True, we often have so few difficulties In our<br />
relationship that the media have little cause to report<br />
on~ it.<br />
True, the strength of our mutual relationship is<br />
* sonetimes overshadowed by the relationships each-of usr<br />
V&amp; ewith the regional giants of China, Japan and the<br />
United States. I 17-21. jun. 93 14: 13 NO. 011 P. 05/ 10 </p>
<p>but the logic of our relationship in fact depends on<br />
these characteri~ stics.<br />
The economic weight you wield in the world is about the<br />
same as ours*<br />
Like us, you are always aware you are a big player in<br />
relation to some countries, and that Japan, China and the<br />
United States are big players in relation to us.<br />
Like us, you are a security ally and trade Fartner of the<br />
United States, but also an important participant in the<br />
Western Pacific economy.<br />
Like us, you depend on trade to expand your economy and<br />
increase your living standards.<br />
Like us, you have an interest in keeping both sides of<br />
the Pacific together.<br />
And of course the truth is that the bilateral<br />
relationship between Korea and Australia is now very well<br />
established, deep and stable and continuing to grow.<br />
it was in response to this growth and the growing depth<br />
and diversity of our dealings that President Kim and I<br />
agreed this morning to establish a new Joint Economic<br />
Coamittee, bringing together all the relevant government<br />
agencies, and meeting annually to oversee the developmsnt<br />
of our economic relationship.<br />
Korea is now our fourth largest export marketq<br />
Commercial links betWeen Australia and Korea underpin a<br />
relationship from which both countries have prospered.<br />
Australia supplies high-quality competitively priced<br />
industrial raw material inputs f or Korean industry<br />
including coal, aluminium, iron ore, non ferrous metals,<br />
uranium, wool and cotton.<br />
Australia is a Significant market for Korea in mtotor<br />
cars, textiles clothing and footwear# chemical$ and<br />
electronics. Today we are striving for a further expansion of two-way<br />
trade. Korean industry is still growing in areas which miatch<br />
Australia's export strengths, Particularly enkergy.<br />
Australia is broadening its trade profile with Korea as<br />
the Korean market expands and diveraifies.<br />
Australia remains well placed to supply coal andl uranium.<br />
Commercial appraisal is underway Of Australia's capacity<br />

to suPPlY Korea's long-term delhand for liqUid natural<br />
gas a<br />
Australia is now becomin~ g a supplier of Manufactured<br />
goods such as food, fiiM, building products, automotive<br />
engines and component..<br />
We are selling services such as telecommunications,<br />
banking, computer sortwareo education and tourism.<br />
Korea is also Iiproving its share of the Australian<br />
market. Last year your exports to Australia rose 20 per<br />
cent, with cars leading the surge.<br />
While Australia's reputation as a supplier or mineral,<br />
energy and agricultural commodities is well known within<br />
] Korean industry, we are much lass well known by Korean<br />
business as a source of industrial goods and technology.<br />
Australia has recognised Korea's priority to develop and<br />
access industrial technology as a part of the economic<br />
reform program.<br />
r an pleased to note that, coinciding with my visit,<br />
Australia and Korea will sign tomorrow an industrial<br />
technology cooperation a~ reement which will provide a<br />
framework for collaboration in this field.<br />
The extent of business cooperation between Australian and<br />
Korean companies is also encouraging.<br />
I refer particularly to areas such as the coo0perationt<br />
taking place between<br />
The Australian telecomm unicatians carrierl Tel'stra,<br />
and the Korean companyt posDATA. on Wednesday I<br />
will be witnessing the signing or a letter Of intent<br />
between the two cooPanies for a strategic alliance<br />
witi) a view to becoming one of the leading<br />
telecommuiicatjohs companies in Korea.<br />
In the informatiofl-t~ chn~ l~ gY field; the supply of<br />
industrial software to Hyundai zlectronics by<br />
Adelaide company# The Cadds. Man Australia, and the<br />
success of Moldf low Korea in selling Australianl<br />
comaputer-aided engineering software for the plastics<br />
industry. in the area of environmental technology; the suPPly<br />
of new water-related environmental technologY<br />
equipment by cheutronics to several organisations in<br />
Korea, including the Seoul Metropolitan Government,<br />
and the agreement between the West Australian<br />
ovipany, Environmental Solutionls InternatiOnal, and<br />
R Samsung on the supply of oil-from-sludge technology.<br />
in the automobile industry; the supply Of<br />
sophisticated mbachine tools by Kirby Engineerinlg for </p>
<p>TEL a<br />
the manufacture of automobile steering mechanisms<br />
and the supply of automobile engines by utralia's<br />
Holden Engine Company.<br />
And the supply of engineering services by Kaiser<br />
Engineering for the construction of a new aluminiua<br />
hydroxide plant in Korea General Chemical<br />
Corporation.<br />
In this context, I welcome the joint management<br />
consortium between the Australian company Intag<br />
International, Deutsche Aerospace of Germany and Samsung<br />
of Korea to use Australian technology for electronic<br />
baggage and freight handling. This is an agreement which<br />
will open up new manufacturing opportunities in both<br />
Australia and Korea for markets world-wide.<br />
I am also pleased that Austrade will be expanding its<br />
role in Korea with the-establishment of an office in<br />
Pusan.<br />
The growth of our trade has been more than satisfactory<br />
although Australia still encounters difficulties in the<br />
Korean market over access for agricultural commodities,<br />
particularly for beef and dairy products, and over<br />
Korea's wide-ranging quarantine restrictions on the entry<br />
of Australian horticultural products.<br />
The business environment between our two countries is<br />
being enhanced by the rapid increase in non-stop direct<br />
air services between Australia and Korea. Six flights<br />
per week will be in place this coming July compared with<br />
YAO services at the beginning of 1990.<br />
For those of you who haven't visited us recently, let me<br />
say that everything you hear about our wonderful beaches,<br />
about the forests and wilderness and the outback is true.<br />
But, as I said when I began, it is also true that<br />
Australian% have over the last decade transformed their<br />
economy. It is most visible in our trade performance. over a<br />
decade, exports have more than doubled. A decade ago<br />
barely one dollar in eight in Australia came from<br />
exports. Today it is one dollar in five, and Climbing.<br />
Today manufactures and services each rival rural exports,<br />
and both are growing. The fastes6t growing manufactured<br />
exports are elaborately transformed goods.<br />
Ahs our exports have grown and the nature Of our exports<br />
has changed, their destination has also changed, A<br />
decade ago less than half of our merchandise exports vent<br />
to East Asia. Today nearly two thirds do and our<br />
exports to Asia are far and away the fastest gr6wing part<br />
of our trade., 21. Jun. 93 14: 13 No. 011 P. 08/ 10 </p>
<p>TEL:* 21. Jun. 9 14: 13 No. 011 P. 09/ 10<br />
behind these changes in our trading performance are the<br />
ef forts of Australian industry* and deliberate changes to<br />
government policy.<br />
We have opened up the economy by floating the Australian<br />
dollar, abolishing capital controls, and puttinV in place<br />
a sensible, consistent program of tariff reductions.<br />
We have introduced competition into telecommunications<br />
anid deregulated air transport.<br />
We have Introduced a national system of eniterpr ise<br />
bargaining by management and labour, which we Intend to<br />
sustain and encourage through comprehensive legislation<br />
later this year.<br />
We have over a decade maintained an Accord withi the trade<br />
union movement which has been a significant factor in<br />
reducing inflation to 1.6 per cent one of the lowest<br />
rates among industrial countries.<br />
And as a result of tax reforms we now have one of the<br />
lowest ratios of tag to GDP in the OECD.<br />
The change continues today. We are cutting the company<br />
tax rate from 39 per cent to 33 per cent. We have<br />
introduced a conditional 10 per cent investment allowance<br />
for plant and equipment, anid an additional 10 per cent<br />
development allowance for approved projects with a<br />
capital cost over $ 50 million.<br />
We now have consistently higher productivity growth than<br />
we have had for a generation, low inflation, and the<br />
lowest level of industrial disputes for decades. We have<br />
a trade surplus, and manufacturing production is rising.<br />
There is no doubt the structure of the Australian economy<br />
is changing, and that we have the policies in place and<br />
under developm~ nt to maintain the pace.<br />
Certainly our recovery has not been as fast as we would<br />
like. economic growth, though faster than virtually any<br />
other OECD country, is not sufficient to make an impact<br />
on our greatest problem unemployment.<br />
Of course, we are not helped by the slow pace of world<br />
recovery, or the low prices presently being fetched by<br />
some of our commodities.<br />
But we have no doubt about the path we are on. Indeed it<br />
is all the more reason to push on with our programs of<br />
reform, especially our efforts to encourage more world<br />
class small and medium sized businesses to flourish, to<br />
flourish as exporters, and to flourish particularly ini<br />
Asia and the Pacific.<br />
Fifteen years ago, with some of my colleagues, I imagined<br />
an Ausntralia which exported not only commodities but </p>
<p>TEL:<br />
sophisticated manufactures. I sometimes ask those same<br />
colleagues to ileagine for a moment whiere we would now be<br />
bad these ref ormis not been made if We had continued to<br />
drift in the world, instead of qoing out to meet it.<br />
The reforms represent a huge step for any country to take<br />
they involve cultural change as well as structural<br />
change in the economy. It all takes time, anid the world<br />
does not always cooperate with our ambitions. Although<br />
in Australia we are determined to soften the impact,<br />
there bar, been hardship for a lot of people.<br />
But there is no question these reforms were essential anid<br />
that they have given us unprecedented opportunities and<br />
there is hardly a more persuasive testimony to this than<br />
our flourishing trade with Korea.<br />
I said at the beginning Australia has had to re-imagine<br />
itself anid rQ-define itself. And because Korea has done<br />
this, and because Korea continues to meet the new<br />
challenges, I know my audience here today will understand<br />
what I mean.<br />
I have no doubt we will continue to re-define ourselves.<br />
And I am sure that our two countrie&amp; will be able to call<br />
on this excperience in our efforts to re-imagine the Asia-<br />
Pacific region and help re-create it as a genuine<br />
economic community.<br />
If we do that, every country's interests will be served,<br />
and so will future generations of Noreans, anid<br />
Australians. Thanik you. TEL: 21. Jun. 93 14: 13 No. 011 P. 10/ 10 </p>
