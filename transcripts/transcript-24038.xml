    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Government will recommend to the Governor-General the appointment of the Hon Roger Gyles AO QC to the position of Independent National Security Legislation Monitor (INSLM).Â </p>
<p>Mr Gyles has extensive legal expertise as a former Federal and Supreme Court Judge, a member of several Tribunals and more than three decades at the New South Wales Bar, including 24 years of those as a Queenâs Counsel.</p>
<p>The Governmentâs $630 million Counter-Terrorism package announced this year included legislation to modernise and strengthen the powers of Australiaâs security agencies and fill the most pressing gaps in their counter-terrorism powers.</p>
<p>It is important Mr Gyles consider this legislation as soon as possible.Â  He will therefore commence as the INSLM immediately on an acting basis, pending consideration of a permanent appointment by the Governor-General as soon as practicable.</p>
<p>His first task will be to review any impact on journalists of the section 35P provisions in the Governmentâs first tranche of national security legislation, National Security Legislation Amendment Act No.1 2014.Â </p>
<p>Mr Gyles was appointed (acting) Judge of the Supreme Court of New South Wales in 1989 before being appointed Judge of the Federal Court of Australia in 1999, a position he held until 2008.Â </p>
<p>He was Deputy President of the Australian Competition Tribunal and Presidential member of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal; Royal Commissioner into the Building Industry of NSW between 1990 and 1992 and Commonwealth Special Prosecutor into âbottom of the harbourâ tax frauds.</p>
<p>He has also been President of both the New South Wales and Australian Bar Associations and is Chair of Transparency International Australia.</p>
<p>Mr Gylesâ experience will equip him well for the important task of monitoring complex national security legislation.</p>
