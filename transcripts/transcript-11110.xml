<p>  O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>  I am joined now by the Prime Minister in Parliament House. John Howard,</p>
<p>   we'll get to the issue of those leaked documents in a few moments but first,</p>
<p>   the issue of the levy. When you have got a strong surplus, why was a special</p>
<p>   levy necessary to pay for a year of East Timor peacekeeping and the build</p>
<p>   up of troops?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, Kerry, the surplus would have disappeared into a small deficit if</p>
<p>   we hadn't decided to introduce this special 12 month levy which will cover</p>
<p>   the financial year 1st of July next year to the 30th</p>
<p>   of June 2001. We had a cash surplus of $3.1 billion projected for that year.</p>
<p>   We had to spend another $1.8 billion in the negotiations with the Democrats</p>
<p>   to get the tax package through. When you take other necessary expenditure</p>
<p>   since the May Budget and variations of economic forecasts into account we</p>
<p>   faced the situation where we could have covered all of those things with</p>
<p>   the $3.1 billion without going into deficit. But the $1 billion on Timor</p>
<p>   which couldn't have been anticipated in the May Budget was really the king</p>
<p>   hit which would have tipped us into a deficit of about $500 million. And</p>
<p>   we weren't prepared to accept that and that's why it's necessary.</p>
<p>  Now, I don't like it, I am sorry about it but we had an alternative.You</p>
<p>   have three options - you go into deficit, you have this special levy or</p>
<p>   you cut further into spending. Now, frankly, there's a, you know, there's</p>
<p>   a point you reach with spending cuts where if you cut any further you are</p>
<p>   taking away essential services. Now, we have been very tough on Government</p>
<p>   spending,. It's a lower percentage of overall product now than it has been</p>
<p>   since the 1960s and I am not prepared to go further in many of the very,</p>
<p>   very sensitive areas because I don't think it's the right balance. I think</p>
<p>   you have got to have a balance between these things and I think we have</p>
<p>   got a pretty good balance and I think the Australian community, while they</p>
<p>   may not like this, they will see it as a fair and decent way of coping with</p>
<p>   an unexpected problem. And I repeat, it's only for people earning over $50,000</p>
<p>   and it's only for 12 months. It comes off after that 12 month period.</p>
<p>  O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>  And now today you have also announced a boosting in your armed force numbers.</p>
<p>   You have got a major Defence paper coming early next year, is there a prospect</p>
<p>   that we'll see a further boost again in defence numbers next year as well?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, Kerry, I don't want to pre-empt the White Paper but the lifting of</p>
<p>   the two additional battalions to full strength is of a piece with our East</p>
<p>   Timor commitment plus another 500 into the Air Force. I don't want to rule</p>
<p>   anything in or out but I have said before that this country has to make</p>
<p>   a greater provision for defence and that means that we have to give a greater</p>
<p>   priority to defence spending. The difficulty we faced and what really caused</p>
<p>   the levy was that the next financial year was a particularly hard year.</p>
<p>   We have got no problem absorbing East Timor this year and no problem in</p>
<p>   the years subsequent to next year but because the GST is starting next year</p>
<p>   there were particular front end costs on the Budget associated with that</p>
<p>   and that's why we had to have this levy. The surpluses in the years flowing</p>
<p>   after the financial year 2000/2001 look pretty healthy even if you make</p>
<p>   allowance for a continuation of the East Timor like costs.</p>
<p>  O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>  Okay. Prime Minister, these leaked Defence intelligence documents, were</p>
<p>   you aware early this year of that intelligence that the Indonesian Military</p>
<p>   were, according to that intelligence, were deliberately arming pro-Indonesian</p>
<p>   militia, effectively sub-contracting them, to use the terminology, to disrupt</p>
<p>   the independence vote?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, Kerry, I was aware and I made it very plain publicly that the Indonesian</p>
<p>   Military was behaving very badly. I just checked before I came on this programme,</p>
<p>   I, for example, at a news conference on the 17th or 18th</p>
<p>   of April this year I said that there was unmistakable evidence that the</p>
<p>   Indonesian Army at the very least was not doing anything to stop the violence</p>
<p>   and that was what.</p>
<p>  O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>  The.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, hang on, can I answer your question. And that's what provoked my visit</p>
<p>   to see Dr Habibie in Bali. But can I just say one thing about all of this,</p>
<p>   can I just say to those people who are now being critical, what did they</p>
<p>   expect us to have done other than what we did? Are they seriously saying</p>
<p>   that even if we had believed every single word in every single document</p>
<p>   that we were going to go and invade Indonesia?</p>
<p>  O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>  No-one is suggesting invasion, Prime Minister, but the implication is that</p>
<p>   when Australia's chief priority around this time, January, February, March,</p>
<p>   when Australia's chief priority as expressed by your Foreign Minister was</p>
<p>   to promote reconciliation between warring Timorese you had Defence advice</p>
<p>   that the Indonesian military were using the militia as active tools to ferment</p>
<p>   violence and disrupt any reconciliation process. How could you have hoped</p>
<p>   to achieve reconciliation in that climate?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, Kerry, we received a great range of advice and the take out clearly</p>
<p>   was that at the very least, and it was obviously potentially much worse,</p>
<p>   the Indonesian Armed Forces were not doing their job. That's at the very,</p>
<p>   very least. But I take you back to the fundamental question that we had</p>
<p>   no capacity to bring about a change of attitude on the part of the Indonesian</p>
<p>   Army or the Indonesian authorities other than by intense diplomatic pressure.</p>
<p>   We made 120 separate representations to the Indonesian authorities from</p>
<p>   the beginning of the year until about the time of the ballot. Australia</p>
<p>   ahead of any other nation on earth put pressure on the Indonesian Government</p>
<p>   to accept a peacekeeping operation. If it hadn't been for Australia's efforts</p>
<p>   the peace enforcement operation assembled more rapidly than any peace enforcement</p>
<p>   operation in the last 20 years by the United Nations would not have gone</p>
<p>   in as soon as it did into East Timor. Now, of course, the Indonesian Army</p>
<p>   failed in its duty at the very, very least and potentially much worse but</p>
<p>   there's no way on earth, Kerry, that the Indonesian Government was going</p>
<p>   to allow peace enforcers to go into East Timor until after the ballot. That</p>
<p>   was made plain to me when I saw Dr Habibie in Bali in April. It was made</p>
<p>   plain to me again when I spoke to Dr Habibie around the time of the ballot.</p>
<p>  O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>  [Inaudible] Dr Habibie told you but the fact is.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  But that is also my..</p>
<p>  O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>  Isn't it true that it was only by that concerted international effort, not</p>
<p>   just Australia's effort and nobody is taking away from Australia's effort,</p>
<p>   but isn't it true that it was only by that concerted international pressure</p>
<p>   on Indonesia that Indonesia eventually folded and allowed the peacekeepers</p>
<p>   in. And I guess the question is, will we ever know if that concerted international</p>
<p>   effort had been encouraged earlier in the process when you were getting</p>
<p>   this advice from your own military, we will never know whether the Indonesians</p>
<p>   would have folded early and lives would have been saved.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Kerry, you have left out one very important element in the chain of events</p>
<p>   and that was the ballot. It was the catalyst represented by the overwhelming</p>
<p>   vote for independence followed by bloodshed and a clear desire by the militia</p>
<p>   to frustrate the ballot outcome that finally galvanised the world. Now,</p>
<p>   my critics, the Government's critics on this.Mr Brereton and others are</p>
<p>   basically saying we shouldn't have had the ballot. Now, that's what they</p>
<p>   are basically saying. Now,.</p>
<p>  O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>  Aren't they saying that the effort should have been made earlier to get</p>
<p>   peacekeepers in?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, every effort was made but short of invasion how else could you have</p>
<p>   got people there. I mean, you come back.</p>
<p>  O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>  But isn't the point.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  No, could I just finish? I listened to a very long question so please allow</p>
<p>   me to answer.</p>
<p>  O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>  There have been some reasonable answers to.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, no, but I am actually being asked to respond. The catalyst for action,</p>
<p>   the thing that really galvanised the world in the end, Kerry, was the combination</p>
<p>   of two things. An 80 per cent vote for independence followed by unmitigated</p>
<p>   bloodshed and a clear desire by the militia to frustrate. Now, it is my</p>
<p>   firm view that that was the thing that finally made it possible for the</p>
<p>   world to be fully galvanised to act. There was no enthusiasm on the part</p>
<p>   of the Americans for heavy military involvement before. There was no enthusiasm</p>
<p>   on the part of anybody. Nobody in their remotest senses would have suggested</p>
<p>   that we should have contemplated military action against the will of the</p>
<p>   Government of the republic of Indonesia.</p>
<p>  O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>  But isn't it also..</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  ..a combination of events that finally tipped the scales in favour and it</p>
<p>   was Australia out of everybody else that brought this about.</p>
<p>  O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>  But isn't it also true that when you were still arguing and recommending</p>
<p>   to the Americans and others that reconciliation should be the primary focus</p>
<p>   that in that same period you were putting peacekeeping initiatives as a</p>
<p>   second rung issue, that reconciliation was your prime focus?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, Kerry, what I was recognising was the reality and that is that there</p>
<p>   was no way the Indonesians were going to accept foreign troops on their</p>
<p>   soil before the ballot. No way. That was made plain. That was the view of</p>
<p>   Kofi Annan. It was the understanding of any person who really understood</p>
<p>   this situation. We are seeing a massive and partisan attempt to rewrite</p>
<p>   history and it won't wash.</p>
<p>  O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>  Just very briefly, in one of the later intelligence documents in September</p>
<p>   after the ballot, they stated that General Wiranto quote has destabilised</p>
<p>   Indonesia, General Wiranto the head of the Armed Forces still, has destabilised</p>
<p>   Indonesia by reintroducing violent confrontation and repression as a means</p>
<p>   of doing business. That the resurgence of Wiranto will engender the widespread</p>
<p>   opposition likely to be met with violence, destabilising consequences over</p>
<p>   the next five years. Does that advice concern you, the implications of it?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, if it turned, obviously if it were true and it turned out to be true</p>
<p>   it would. I tend to take a more optimistic view, Kerry. I think the Presidency</p>
<p>   of Wahid and the Vice-Presidency of Megawatti offer real hope for Indonesia.</p>
<p>   I think they are embarked on a new path. I don't want to get carried away</p>
<p>   with that notion but I think we are seeing a huge change. I mean, they have</p>
<p>   gone a long way in 12 months. 211 million people, third largest democracy</p>
<p>   on earth if it sticks. Now, you know, I'd like to believe that that is possible.</p>
<p>   Anything can occur in a nation that has gone through the, sort of, volatility</p>
<p>   and turmoil that country has gone through. But there are some very optimistic</p>
<p>   signs and I see in President Wahid very much part of that.</p>
<p>  O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>  And are you satisfied that Australia is giving enough support, urging strongly</p>
<p>   enough for a genuine energetic international effort to prosecute war crimes</p>
<p>   where justified?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think we are getting the balance right in relation to that. And I think</p>
<p>   if you allow the proper processes to run and we will do all we can to facilitate</p>
<p>   the proper processes I believe that that will lead where there is guilt</p>
<p>   to the prosecution of that guilt and the punishment of those who are responsible</p>
<p>   for war crimes.</p>
<p>  O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>  Even if it goes right to the top, General Wiranto?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, look, Kerry, I don't want to say yes or no to that because, I mean,</p>
<p>   others can fling names around. I have to be rather more careful.</p>
<p>  O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>  John Howard, thank you for talking with us.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Pleasure.</p>
