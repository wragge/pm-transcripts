<p>  Well, I would like, on behalf of the Government and I know on behalf of</p>
<p>   everybody here, and my remarks would be supported by the Deputy Leader of</p>
<p>   the Opposition, I would like to congratulate you, Vicki, and all the other</p>
<p>   members of the team on a truly astonishing performance.</p>
<p>  You've achieved a strike rate, I understand, of 70 percent in world championships</p>
<p>   since there has been a world championship in netball. I don't know of any</p>
<p>   national sporting team for Australia that's done better than that. And to</p>
<p>   have maintained, as many of you have participated in maintaining, an absolute</p>
<p>   dominance in international netball over the past 10 years is a remarkable</p>
<p>   achievement.</p>
<p>  We've all read and heard and, more importantly, looked at that nail-biting</p>
<p>   finish that we were again reminded of so warmingly a few moments ago in</p>
<p>   that video. It's a clich of course but that is the stuff of which magnificently</p>
<p>   thrilling international sporting contests are made. The tension was evident</p>
<p>   and the sheer exuberance of you, Vicki, your team mates and your coaches</p>
<p>   and everybody else associated with the game was very evident. And it's a</p>
<p>   remarkable way, may I say, to conclude your own international netball career.</p>
<p>   And I do want to say, on behalf of the Government and everybody associated</p>
<p>   with the sport, what a tremendous ornament you have been, Vicki, to the</p>
<p>   game and the tremendous credit and repute that you have brought to netball</p>
<p>   Australia and to the playing of the game in our country.</p>
<p>  I know there is always some debate about how many people play what sport</p>
<p>   but it's my understanding that there is no sport in Australia that is more</p>
<p>   widely played than netball. And it has attracted not only enormously enthusiastic</p>
<p>   participation but it is attracting, importantly in this era of fierce international</p>
<p>   competition, it is also pleasingly attracting a growing level of sponsorship.</p>
<p>  But as always the strength of a sport, whether it's netball or any other</p>
<p>   sport that Australians indulge, the strength of a sport depends very heavily</p>
<p>   on that network of volunteers at a local level, those mums and dads and</p>
<p>   boyfriends and girlfriends and brothers and sisters and friends generally</p>
<p>   who year in and year out support in an entirely selfless, voluntary capacity,</p>
<p>   the playing of the game. And that has been the story of netball as it has</p>
<p>   been the story of so many other sports in the Australian community.</p>
<p>  We love our sporting heroes in this country. We love Australia to win. We</p>
<p>   love Australians to participate and we always like it when they win in very</p>
<p>   exciting circumstances providing, of course, they still just win. And you</p>
<p>   demonstrated that quite magnificently in the match against New Zealand.</p>
<p>  I'm delighted that we've had this little opportunity on behalf of the Parliament</p>
<p>   and the people of Australia to say thank you. I think national achievement</p>
<p>   in any endeavour where great credit is brought to Australia should be honoured.</p>
<p>   We should take a few moments out from our parliamentary existence and to</p>
<p>   simply say thank you to honour the fact that you have demonstrated that</p>
<p>   you are the best in the world and that you've demonstrated that in the name</p>
<p>   of the entire country. And we're very proud of that and we congratulate</p>
<p>   you. We wish you well. And, Vicki, we wish you particular health and happiness</p>
<p>   and good fortune in your future. And to all of those associated with the</p>
<p>   game, the trainers, the coaches, the administrators, the supporters, the</p>
<p>   spectators and the sponsors, we thank them. It's a great celebration and</p>
<p>   it's delightful to have you amongst us.</p>
<p>  Thank you.</p>
<p>  [Ends]</p>
