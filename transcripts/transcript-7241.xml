FOR MEDIA 13 NOVEMBER 1987<br />
JOINT STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER AND THE MINISTER FOR<br />
SOCIAL SECURITY, MR BRIAN HOWE<br />
Eligible families can now apply for the Government's new<br />
family benefit.<br />
The benefit fulfils a promise made by the Government during<br />
the election campaign.<br />
In the last Federal Budget, the Government committed itself<br />
to a $ 500 million family package to help out parents who are<br />
working to make ends meet.<br />
In framing our last Budget the Government decided to give<br />
something back to low income families. The recognition by<br />
Australian workers of the need for restraint over the last<br />
few years has helped support the reconstruction of the<br />
Australian economy.<br />
We decided to give a helping hand to the families with<br />
children.<br />
The major payment in the family package is called the Family<br />
Allowance Supplement.<br />
It is tax free, and it will be paid on top of the family<br />
allowance. Because it is tax free the Family Allowance Supplement is<br />
better than a pay rise eligible families will get to keep<br />
all of it.<br />
A family on $ 400 a week with two teenagers and paying rent<br />
will get $ 27 a week.<br />
Because it is tax free the Family Allowance Supplementc they<br />
get is equivalent to a pay rise for that family of $ 45 a<br />
week or 11.25 per cent.<br />
The same family on $ 350 a week will get an extra $ 52 to add<br />
on to their wage. That is equivalent to a pay rise of $ 86 a<br />
week or almost 25 per cent.<br />
Families with two young children are eligible for some<br />
payment up to an income of $ 400 a week. The more children<br />
families have, the more money they can earn and still get<br />
the Family Allowance Supplement. </p>
<p>2.<br />
Because of Labor, Australia's tax system is fairer because<br />
of the family package, Australia's wages system is fairer.<br />
The family package offers rent assistance to working<br />
families for the first time.<br />
And for the first time in our history it offers working<br />
families a child payment which is indexed to pension rate<br />
increases.<br />
This package takes the first step towards constructing a new<br />
system of public support for children targeted to those<br />
families who need it most.<br />
Labor has not forgotten its traditional commitment more<br />
than a million children will benefit from the family package<br />
in this financial year.<br />
Child payments for parents in the social security system<br />
will be increased automatically to the family package<br />
levels. This is the start of a three year program to build a new<br />
system of child support for Australian families. By that<br />
time there will be a single system of payments covering both<br />
eligible working families and families in the social<br />
security system.<br />
All Australian children have the right to a decent standard<br />
of living all our policies are directed to making that<br />
principle a firm reality for every family.<br />
Our goal is that no child need live in poverty by 1990.<br />
The family package is the first step towards<br />
goal. ( The Prime minister accepts the first formal<br />
the new benefit at Mt Druitt shopping centre<br />
today.) reaching that<br />
