THE PRIME MINISTER'S PRESS CONFERENCE<br />
AT PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA<br />
TUESDAY, 19 DECEMBER 1972<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Ladies and gentlemen: there is a matter which<br />
will be interesting in the next few days, it concerns diplomatic<br />
relations with East Germany the German Democratic Republic.<br />
I have instructed the Australian Ambassador in Moscow to<br />
have discussions with his East German colleague there, about<br />
the early establishment of diplomatic relations between Australia<br />
and the German Democratic Republic. These discussions are in<br />
progress. Following the recent moves between West and East Germany<br />
to normalise their relations, I consider it is important both<br />
for political and commercial reasons to normalise Australia's<br />
relations with East Germany. Apart from facilitating trade in<br />
both directions, Australian recognition of East Germany would,<br />
when agreement is reached, make people in Europe more aware that<br />
there is a new government in Australia which is not concentrating<br />
on South East Asia and the Pacific to the exclusion of our highly<br />
important relations with Europe.<br />
I would also make the point that in opening discussions<br />
with the German Democratic Republic I am seeking to avoid situations<br />
in which Australia takes general decisions in international affairs<br />
late. I would rather see Australia in the vanguard then in the<br />
rearguard in coming to its own foreign policy decisions.<br />
MR. BARNARD: Mr. Prime Minister, ladies and gentlemen: the<br />
Government has decided that because of the heavy burden of<br />
defence policy which will fall on the Defence Minister, a second<br />
Minister under the policy of higher management direction of the<br />
Minister for Defence should be appointed to whom the three services<br />
may look for political guidance, and who will answer questions in<br />
parliament relating to their parti cular sercice interests.<br />
He will participate along with the Minister for Defence himself<br />
in discussions in the Ministry when the interests of servicemen<br />
are involved in matters coming before the Government. The<br />
Minister assisting will exercise many of those functions which<br />
under existing legislation are conferred on the Minister for the<br />
Navy, the Army and Air.<br />
The Government intends, at the second stage and before the<br />
end of 1973, to merge into the Department of Defence the three<br />
service departments and, if deemed practicable, at the same<br />
time the Supply Department. Legislative amendments will be<br />
introduced after the plans for organisational change have been<br />
prepared by the Secretary of the Department of Defence in<br />
consultation with other responsible authorities, and after the<br />
Government has made a decision on them. There will be other<br />
innovations; the Government will establish standing machinery<br />
for assessing the pay and conditions of the armed forces and<br />
it will come into effect after the Woodward Committee completes<br />
its work. An Ombudsman for the members of the armed gervices<br />
will be appointed after his mandate has been drafted and his<br />
relationship with the military disciplinary and command system </p>
<p>-2-<br />
has been clearly laid down. As soon as the re-organised Department<br />
of Defence is ready to assume the responsibility, the Civil Defence<br />
Directora te will be transferred to it from the Department of the<br />
Interior, and there will be created a National Disaster Organisation<br />
in association with it to cope in co-operation with other civil<br />
authorities in Australia with the effects of natural disasters<br />
like droughts, floods, fires and cyclones to which Australia is<br />
subject. The appointments reflect the Government's intention to<br />
give an important priority to maintaining efficient fighting forces<br />
controlled by modern administration under a senior Defence minister.<br />
The Government intends to break down the separation of service<br />
administration from each other and from the Department of Defence<br />
in which respect a number of countries have moved far ahead of<br />
Australia. PRIME MINISTER: Ladies and gentlemen: the last two Conferences,<br />
the first two of the three Conferences given by the present<br />
administration, were given in the late afternoon. We tried to have<br />
the last one in time for the afternoon papers to have it in the<br />
morning. You remember, that that wasn't posiible, but we have<br />
been able to arrange this one this morning. It might suit your<br />
convenience best for the representatives of the afternoon papers<br />
to ask the first questions.<br />
Q. Mr. Prime Minister, in the field of foreign affairs, has<br />
it been made clear to the United States government that your<br />
government does not follow the same policy on Vietnam as your<br />
predecessors did and are you at this stage, prepared to deplore<br />
the resumption of American bombing of the Hanoi/ Haiphong area?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well, naturally we regret that the negotiations<br />
for a cease-fire, leading one would hope to a peace settlement,<br />
have broken down. There have been no communications on this subject<br />
between the United States and the Australian governments.<br />
Australia is not a party principal in any way in Vietnam.<br />
As you know, the last Australian combatant or training forces have<br />
now left the country. obviously, we hope that the negotiations<br />
are soon resumed.<br />
Prime Minister, what about the bombings?<br />
Q. Riave you any comment on the bombings to Mr. Matthew's question?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, I don't think a comment would help. we would<br />
like to have the negotiations resumed. That's all that I feel I<br />
should say.<br />
Q. Have you at last received the communication from the<br />
Queensland Premier about the Torres Strait Island border problem?<br />
Have you had any representations from the Islanders themselves that<br />
you should visit there or see some of their people? What's your<br />
latest attitude on this?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I : might have received a reply from Mr. Bjelke-<br />
Petersen. I haven't seen it. You can understand that yesterday<br />
and today I wouldn't be very much up to the minute on my<br />
correspondence. I don't know if he's replied. I did write to<br />
him last week on this subject. He must have the letter by now.<br />
Q. Has he said that he's replied? </p>
<p>-3-<br />
HAWKINS: I understood that he had written back to you again,<br />
but I'm niot 100% sure that it was in reply to your letter.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't I haven't seen a letter from him on<br />
this subj-ect.<br />
Q. Sir, will there be a Cabinet meeting before Christmas and<br />
what do you see as the most pressing problems or questions to be<br />
discussed by the first Cabinet meeting?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I hope there'll be a Cabinet meeting tomorrow.<br />
Ther-e will not: . be many matters that can be dealt with at this<br />
notice, but one that I have in mind is the application pending<br />
on Thursday before the Public Service Arbitrator about four weeks<br />
annual leave for the Public Service. I would like the full<br />
ministry to consider the attitude that should be taken on that<br />
application. Q. Mr. Whitlam, I'm told that the Chinese, in the discussions<br />
on recognition, are demanding that your government expropriate<br />
all the assets of the Taiwan Ggvernment and hand them over to<br />
them and, secondly, that we remove even our trade representatives<br />
from Taiwan. Are these things that the Government is prepared<br />
to negotiate with because they seem to go beyond the Canadian<br />
formula that you have laid down as the key to recognition?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: You've been told more than I have. There will<br />
be no official representatives in Taiwan once relations are<br />
established with Peking. There are there never have been<br />
official representatives of Canada in Taiwan.<br />
Q. Aren't there trade officials?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I thought not.<br />
Q. Appropo to that particular subject. Could you say what<br />
stage has been reached in the negotiations with the People's<br />
Republic of China through our ambassador to Paris?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The discussions are proceeding statisfactorily.<br />
I expect that there will be another meeting between the ambassadors<br />
quite shortly.<br />
Q. Mr. Prime Minister. If Mr. Barnard can handle five previous<br />
portfolios, admittedly with the assistance of an Assistant Minister,<br />
how hard will Senator Cavanagh work in Works? Could not the<br />
Ministry have, in fact, and the general administration, been cut<br />
considerably? PRIME MINISTER: The pra ctical fact is that no Commonwealth<br />
Ministry from now will have less than 27 ministers. I would<br />
imagine that Senator Cavanagh, as Minister for Works, will be<br />
much more fully engaged than his predecessor in that portfolio. </p>
<p>-4-<br />
Q. Sir, have you opened any negotiations with the French<br />
Governme. t regarding nuclear tests in the Pacific?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, you indicated prior to the elections that<br />
the one minister would control both the Departments of Labour<br />
and Immigration. In the Ministry you announced last night this<br />
was not so. Why have you now appointed an individual Minister<br />
for Immigration? Does this involve a re-thinking of your<br />
immigration policy?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: There have been three or four ministers who<br />
I have said, from time to time, would have two portfolios but<br />
who will now be having only one. The reason is largely the<br />
reason I've just given, that there have to be portfolios for<br />
27 Ministers. I also had said that Mr. Uren would handle both<br />
Urban and Regional Development and Environment and Conservation<br />
but he agreed to take only one. I had also said that Mr.<br />
Hayden would take both Social Security and Health. He has agreed<br />
to take only one and the change in Mr. Cameron's position of<br />
taking only one of the two that I'd previously suggested was one<br />
which was also taken with his agreement.<br />
Q. This doesn't represent any changes in your thinking on<br />
immigration the change in immigration policy?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No. No, I'm not quite sure what you mean there.<br />
Q. The fact that immigration will be running down?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, the emphasis will be, as you can well see<br />
from Mr. Grassby's appointment, in making people who have<br />
migrated to Australia happy in this country, and the prime<br />
means of bringing other migrants to this country.<br />
Q. Do you intend to give assisted passages to coloured migrants<br />
in the near future? If so, when and how many per year?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I would. The general attitude is, as has been<br />
stated for quite some time, the emphasis on who comes here will<br />
be not what the Government determines, but what is determined<br />
by people who are already living in Australia. Principally,<br />
that is the people who are close relatives and close friends of<br />
existing residents in Australia will be the migrants who will be<br />
coming here. No numbers have ever beeh stated, but I would<br />
think that the number of migrants of all categories will<br />
continue, I emphasise continue, to fall.<br />
Q. Will you give assisted passages to the Taiwanese?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I'll consider that.<br />
Q. How do you regard Australian and British relations now that<br />
you're Prime Minister? </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: Better.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, following the split between Social Security<br />
and Health, will Dr. Everingham. and Mr. Hayden both be involved in<br />
negotiations, for example with the doctors, or will the Social<br />
Security Minister be solely responsible for those negotiations?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The Social Security Minister will be mainly<br />
responsible. There may be occasions when the Health Minister<br />
would also be involved in bringing in the new form of health<br />
insurance. There will be other matters in which Dr. Everingham<br />
would be principally concerned in negotiation with the doctors<br />
such as hospitals and clinics.<br />
Q. Would he be involved in discussing with the doctors fees, the<br />
question of doctor's fees?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: This would be primarily Mr. Hayden's. I don't<br />
say that Dr. Everingham mightn't be involved but this would<br />
primarily be a matter for Mr. Hayden. You will appreciate<br />
that the Department of Social Security will deal not only with<br />
cash social services: it will also deal with health insurance<br />
and with the introduction of national superannuation and<br />
national compensation.<br />
Q. Sir, do you intend to encourage your Ministers to take up<br />
residence in Canberra and do you intend to review the policy of<br />
the last government on Ministerial housing?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: This will be considered by the new<br />
administration to be sworn in at half past five this<br />
afternoon. Where Ministers live will depend, as it always<br />
has, on the two considerations of looking after their<br />
electorate, which is their base after all, and best performing<br />
their administrative duties.<br />
Q. The Hospitals Commission you proposed. When do you envisage<br />
setting that up and who will be administering it, Dr. Everinghamor<br />
Mr. Hayden?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: It would be responsible primarily to<br />
Dr. Everingham.<br />
Q. When do you envisage setting it up?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I think, in an interim form. I would hope<br />
quite soon.<br />
Q. I want to clarify a question I asked you last week about<br />
a statement you made in July, of which you were apparently<br />
unaware, about rehabilitation assistance to people who<br />
suffered in the name of conscience under the National Service<br />
Act. I've since looked up the reference. I don't know<br />
whether you have.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No I haven't.<br />
Q. It was a telegram you sent to the Reverend Roger Wootten<br />
of the Melbourne Presbyterian Church. </p>
<p>-6-<br />
PRIME MINISTER: My communications from clergy usually come<br />
from othe-rquarters.<br />
Q. Well, this telegram was quoted in the " Age" on the 11th of July<br />
1972. The telegram you sent to him in which you promised<br />
rehabilitation assistance for those who had suffered in the<br />
name of conscience under the National Service Act. Again, what<br />
form will the rehabilitation assistance take. Will it be<br />
financial compensation and is financial compensation being<br />
considered for draft resisters who went underground?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I would guess that the answer I sent to this<br />
gentleman would be quoting the resolution at the Launceston<br />
Conference last year. I would doubt if I went any further than<br />
that, but I've given no further consideration to this matter.<br />
It's obviously a matter for the new Government to consider if<br />
it's to be considered at all.<br />
Q. In view of Mr. Cameron's rather gloomy forecasts about<br />
the future employment situation and the high priority which<br />
you gave to this in your election campaign, what remedial<br />
action can you take in addition to the action already tak en<br />
through the States? Is there any program in your mind for setting<br />
up plans to absorb the unemployed persons?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I've received a letter from Sir Robert Askin,<br />
along with several proposals for employment which can be rapidly<br />
increased in various fields through public expenditure in New<br />
South Wales along the lines that have been arranged with the<br />
four southern States already. I think this letter came yesterday<br />
and I'll be discussing it with Mr. Crean today, but the form<br />
of Commonwealth assistance to get people back to work will largely<br />
be in the form that's already been taken.<br />
Q. With regard to your own area: of responsibility, could you<br />
explain specifically your responsibility to the Tariff Board and<br />
how this fits in with the functions of the Department of<br />
Secondary Industry and, the second question, do you know at<br />
this stage when Parliament will meet?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, I don't know when Parliament will meet.<br />
This will be a matter which will be discussed by the new<br />
Ministry. About the Tariff Board; you'll remember that the<br />
proposal that we were making earlier this year was that the<br />
Tariff Board should be extended and perhaps renamed " Protection<br />
Commission" in order to have references, not only in respect<br />
to secondary industry from the Department of Trade and Industry<br />
which is now being abolished, but also from the new Department*<br />
of Bed-ondar y Industry and from the continuing Department of<br />
Primary Industry and from the continuing Department of Customs<br />
and Excise, the whole idea being that the Tariff Board, or its<br />
enlarged and maybe renamed successor, would inves tigate and,<br />
if it sees fit, recommend the forms of encouragement for protection<br />
by way of tariff or subsidies or grants research grants in both<br />
primary as well as secondary industry.<br />
Q. ' Prime Minister, have you had a chance yet to have a look<br />
at the proposed Cabinet Committee system? How many Committees<br />
will there be, what will be their names and to what extent will<br />
they be able to make decisions on behalf of the Cabinet? And, also,<br />
could you explain why you've transferred Prima ry Industry from<br />
the Reps to the Senate? </p>
<p>-7-<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I haven't considered yet the Cabinet Committee<br />
system. I've done a little study of it for instance, on the<br />
Canadian model. All I can say at this stage is that it's unlikely<br />
that the Cabinet Committees will make decisions on behalf of the<br />
Cabinet. What may happen is that the Cabinet Committees would<br />
make a recommendation to the Cabinet and that would become the<br />
Cabinet decision if no other Ministers objected to it and asked<br />
for the matter to be re-opened. You also asked me about the<br />
transfer of Primary Industry from the House of Representatives.<br />
to the Senate. There is, of course, no requirement for any<br />
Ministry to be in either House except, I suppose, the Prime<br />
Minister and the Treasurer have to be in the House of Representatives.<br />
Any other Minister can be in either House, and I would think every<br />
Ministry, hitherto, at one stage or another has been represented<br />
in each House.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, some pensioners have complained a little<br />
that they haven't received an immediate increase as you had<br />
promised in your policy speech, and I would like to ask how it's<br />
possible that youlre able to find a loophole in terms of getting<br />
dra ft resisters out of gaol and not being able to give a pension<br />
increase?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well, I'm sorry that any pensioners have made<br />
that compl'ant because I never made any promise in the Policy<br />
Speech of an immediate increase. I said there would be in Autumn,<br />
and there will be in Autumn quite early after the House sits.<br />
However, I never said there would be one before Autumn. I said<br />
that, thereafter, there would be twice a year, Spring and Autumn<br />
thereafter. Q. Reading the policy speech thouigh it does, in fact, say<br />
an immediate increase?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't think it does. There was no suggestion<br />
that there would be any increase before the Parliament met.<br />
There can't be, can there?<br />
Q. If I may just supplement that one. You were able to find<br />
a loophole in terms of conscription, and draft resisters were<br />
let out of gaol.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: There was no expenditure of money required there.<br />
You can't expend money on social services except by authorisation<br />
of the Parliament, and payment of social services comes out of the<br />
National welfare Fund I think it is to which the contributions<br />
are made under amending social services acts. I haven't got a<br />
copy of the policy speech with me but I never came across any<br />
misunderstanding on this matter at all. The promise was that<br />
there would be an increase of $ 1.50 when the Parliament met next<br />
year and thereafter every Spring and Autumn until the pension<br />
reached 25% instead of the present 20% of the avera ge weekly<br />
male earnings. </p>
<p>-8-<br />
Q. Mr. Whitlam, a question on your announcement at the weekend<br />
of a scheme to favour Australian-owned companies in the allocation<br />
of government contracts?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: That was in the policy speech.<br />
Q. Do you envisage the situation of tenders equal in price and<br />
availability arising very often? If tenders equal in price and<br />
availability do arise often, this is not a matter for the collusive<br />
tendering provisions of the Trade Practices Act?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I think it would be.<br />
Q. If they don't arise often what benefit real benefit will<br />
the scheme have for Australian-owned companies and the second<br />
point; have you any details of the criteria for determining<br />
Australia ownership? If those details haven't been worked out yet,<br />
why was the scheme announced by the interim administration and<br />
not announced in full detail so that companies who could<br />
be affected by it can find out all the details by the second<br />
Whitlam Ministry?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The present administration carried out as many<br />
of the proposals in the party platform and in the policy speech<br />
as it could do in the time available to it., T his was one of the<br />
proposals in the policy speech. It was particularly mentioned<br />
in the policy speech in connection with Commonwealth purchases<br />
of petrol and oil. The present situation, as I understand it,<br />
is that if tenders are equal then they go to the company which<br />
previously had the order, the contract. Presumably, therefore,<br />
there have been cases hitherto where people have made the same<br />
tender. Now, in that case, there may be in the future. If<br />
this happens in the future, instead of going to the old supplier<br />
it would go to the Australian supplier. As you will remember in<br />
the press statement I made two days ago, current contracts for<br />
petroleum products will not expire before the end of 1973. I.' ve<br />
been investigating this as regards the Department of Supply by<br />
way of questions in the last Parliament, but there are a<br />
considerable number of instrumentalities where I was unable<br />
to find the position in the last Parliament. It now appears<br />
that all the contracts go on until the end of 1973. Now, if by<br />
1973 some of the other oil companies achieve the favourable<br />
position of Ampol or even H. C. Sleigh then they will continue<br />
to get some of the Commonwealth contracts which hitherto they<br />
seem to have been largely monopolised.<br />
Q. The question of the criteria of Australian ownership. Has<br />
that been resolved?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No. There are various criteria which have already<br />
been laid down in Commonwealth legislation. Ampol would clearly<br />
comply with this and maybe H. C. Sleigh but it would appear that the<br />
other companies which have Commonwealth contracts at this stage do not.<br />
Q. May I ask, through you, Mr. Barnard a couple of current issues on<br />
defence? First of all, the Woodward Committee reported to you, I<br />
think last FRiday, on the outstanding items which included possible<br />
pay rises. It was mentioned that these pay rises could cost $ 70 million.<br />
How soon do you expect to be able to implement these last matters and<br />
also, on the DqF, R. B., you had meetings also last week on the D., RB<br />
which I believe are being </p>
<p>-9-<br />
tidied up this week. Are you encountering any unforeseen<br />
difficulties in carrying out the policy promise to implement<br />
the D. F. R. B. Jess Committee's Report as quickly as possible?<br />
MR. BARNARD: Well, first of all on the Woodward Committee Report.<br />
I received it last Friday afternoon. That allowed me some time<br />
over the weekend to look at it myself. Now, it's a very<br />
comprehensive report. It is true that it will involve the Government in<br />
additional expense but it is in line with our policy undertakings<br />
to improve the conditions of serving members ' of the armed forces.<br />
Naturally, I want sufficient time to be able to carefully consider<br />
the proposals before I have further discussions about the Woodward<br />
Committee's report with the Prime Minister. Now, I hope to do that<br />
as soon as possible because we have said that we will provide<br />
improved conditions for serving members of the forces as soon as<br />
possible. I believe this is a very valuable and significant<br />
report and, therefore, I hope to have the discussions as soon as<br />
pos. õ ible and then the decision will be one for the new Government<br />
to determine when legislation is introduced into the Federal<br />
Parliament. But we have also said that we would want to make<br />
reports available to the public and those interested in them as soon<br />
as possible. I can assure you that I'll be moving, as soon as<br />
practicable, to have the report made available to the media after<br />
consultation with the Prime Minister. Now, the second part of<br />
the question was on the Defence Forces Retirement Benefit Fund. Again,<br />
it was a policy decision during the last election that we would<br />
implement the recommendations of the Jess Committee. Now, I began<br />
last week by having discussions with those concerned; with the<br />
Treasury Department and from the armed services. I have indicated<br />
to them that I would hope to have legislation ready for the first<br />
session of the Federal Parliament. This, of course, will depend on<br />
some administrative matters, the availability of the necessary<br />
machinery to provide the legislation. But, I will be having further<br />
discussions again this week on matters concerning the D. F. R. B. and<br />
it will, as I have said, be introduced as soon as it is practicable<br />
to do so.<br />
Q. Mr. Prime Minister, on the subject of primary industry again.<br />
Only the second time since Mr. McMahon became the first Minister<br />
in the early fifties has this job fallen to a non-farmer. In<br />
view of the fact that the previous farmer representative in the<br />
previous government was ranked about fourth or fifth in the<br />
Cabinet with due respect to Senator Wreidt why has the<br />
position been so downgraded?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't know where primary industry has ranked<br />
in the Ministerial list hitherto. I think the highest position<br />
it ever reached was in the last Government and that was merely<br />
for the reason that it was held by the Deputy Leader of the<br />
Country Party. It was not because of the Department, it was<br />
because of the party position of the Minister.<br />
Q. Mr. Whitlam, I'd like to know who's going to authorise<br />
the tapping of our telephones? Could you tell us about the<br />
relationship of ASIO to the government, and are there any new<br />
arrangements there? </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: No.<br />
Q. It stays with Senator Murphy does it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes.<br />
Q. Sir, on tariffs. Which department will now carry<br />
the overall responsibility for moulding general tariff courses?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: This is probably one of those matters which will<br />
be discussed by one of the Cabinet committees. Tariff Board<br />
matters will only be defused to use your term because there<br />
will be, for the first time, an investigation of protection in<br />
various forms for primary products, not, as hitherto, secondary<br />
products alone. The administration is already pretty defused<br />
because two Ministers hitherto have been able to refer matters<br />
to the Tariff Board for enquiry and report, the Minister for<br />
Trade and Industry formerly I think it used to be Customs and<br />
Agriculture wasn't it? Commerce and Agriculture and then,<br />
of course, Customs and Excise can do so.<br />
Q. Sir, will we have an early increase in members' pay and,<br />
if so, will this mean an increase in ministerial pay?<br />
?' RIME MINISTER: I do like the lilt in your voice!<br />
This has not been considered by the present ministry. As you<br />
probably know, their emoluments have not been increased for years.<br />
Mr. Barnard and I are drawing the emoluments, and I've seen that<br />
Senator Murphy and Senator Willesee continue to receive them<br />
although they would otherwise have lost the emoluments we were<br />
all receiving in the last Parliament and no more at this stage.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Incidentally, on this I forget the calculations<br />
but tech-nic-aly Mr. Barnard and I could have taken, for this<br />
fortnight, the whole of the ministerial pool.<br />
Q. On that subject, Sir, at the moment there are senior ministers<br />
and junior ministers who receive differing pay scales. I think<br />
you are going to be an egalitarian minister, you're receiving<br />
the same salaryA<br />
PRIME MINISTER: You are quite right.<br />
Q. Will your salary drop or will the others increase?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: They might.<br />
Q. There is a point, Sir, related to that. What sort of<br />
staffing facilities do you think the Government will provide<br />
for the Liberal and Country Parties so that they can carry out<br />
their mandate to oppose?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I'll have to they will get better staffing<br />
facilitie~ s than the previous Opposition, and they'll probably<br />
need it. This is a matter where, clearly, the new ministry will<br />
have to discuss the matter and the method of communication in<br />
the first instance is between the leaders of the various parties.<br />
When the Liberals choose their new Leader then, presumably, he<br />
and Mr. Anthony and I will have a discussion on this matter and<br />
then the Ministry will have a discussion upon it. </p>
<p>-11-<br />
Mr. Anthony did approach me about this. He was very quick<br />
off the mark but I told him that he could go ahead on the basis<br />
that his staff should be not smaller than that which Mr. Barnard<br />
enjoyed in the last Parliament, and he has taken up residence.<br />
I hope the Speaker approves of it.<br />
Q. Mr. Prime Minister, in view of the meeting, I think early<br />
next month, with Mr. Hamer and Sir Robert Askin on the development<br />
of Albury/ Wodonga. Have any instructions been issued cancelling<br />
or deferring the transfer of departments to Canberra and, in<br />
particular, the building of office blocks further office blocksf<br />
or the Public Service in Melbourne or Sydney?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No.<br />
I'm not sure that there wasn't I said no oders had been given.<br />
I'm not sure there wasn't something on the proposed Woolloomooloo<br />
Commonwealth building. You'll remember that the Public Works<br />
Committee reported against it. Now, I if you're interested in<br />
this matter perhaps I'd better look it up and see precisely if<br />
anything has happened since then, but otherwise there hasn't been.<br />
Q. Will Dr. Patterson be answering for Primary Industry union<br />
representatives and, if so, what will be the inter-actio n between<br />
Northern Development and Primary Industry?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Of f hand, the principal relation between the<br />
two will be in sugar and in cattle but administratively they<br />
would be sepa rate departments. You ask me if Dr. Patterson<br />
would be the Minister in the House of Representatives representing<br />
the Minister for Primary Industry. I haven't discussed the<br />
question of representation in either House with any of my colleagues<br />
but I would expect that Dr. Patterson would be the Minister in<br />
the House of Representatives representing the Minister for Primary<br />
Industry.<br />
Q. Mr. Whitlam, can you name the new Permanent Heads of the<br />
departments you outlined last night and, if not, when can we<br />
expect to have the names of the new Pe rmanent Heads?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: This is a matter where the new ministers will<br />
be having ' discussionwsi th the Public Service Board, and then<br />
when they have recommendations they'll make them to the Cabinet<br />
which will then make the appointments. I don't know how soon<br />
this can be done but it may be possible to do it more quickly<br />
in some departments than in others. Some of the new departments<br />
are ones where it may not be possible to find a properly qualified<br />
person in the Commonwealth Service.<br />
Q. Have you given any thought to the invitations you might like<br />
to extend during the coming period to heads of governments or heads<br />
of State from other countries we've talked at previous press<br />
conferences about yourself visiting China, do you intend to invite<br />
anybody here? In terms of a European Leader, might you be<br />
thinking of the Chancellor of West Germany who is the Head of<br />
the fraternal party?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: It's too soon to say. It's a happy thought.<br />
I apprec'ia-te your reference to the Leader of our brother party </p>
<p>-12-<br />
in West Germany.<br />
Q. On the question of Mr. Cameron's ra ther gloomy predictions<br />
for unemployment, do you expect now that you will quickly bring<br />
in higher unemployment benefits? If so, when and what do you see<br />
as a reasonable figure for unemployment benefits?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: This is a matter where the new Ministry will make<br />
decisions.' Higher benefits will have to await legislation. I<br />
think that these are benefits which have remained unaltered<br />
longer than any except maternity allowances and child endowment.<br />
Q. I believe Lord Carrington, Britain's De fence Minister,<br />
is coming out in January. Can you indicate what might be<br />
discussed with him?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I've said that we I think I said this a.<br />
fort-night ago but there has been further correspondence and<br />
I have repeated the fact that we'll be very happy to have<br />
discussions with him on the whole range of matters which he<br />
likes to bring up on behalf of his Government.<br />
Q. You said a fortnight ago that a question on the Honours<br />
list was premature. Do you now confirm that there'll be no<br />
Commonwealth list in the coming New Year's list, and are<br />
you seeking or have you received any proposals from your<br />
department on an alternative Australian system of recognition?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: This is a matter of some delicacy. All I want<br />
to say i1s : no persons were sounded on their willingness to<br />
receive Awards in a New Year's Honours list on the nomination<br />
of the Australian Government. I say that because some people<br />
have suggested that there's been a breach of faith or a<br />
humiliation. No persons were sounded about any honours from<br />
the Australian Government.<br />
I'm assured that no soundings were made. I've read reports<br />
that some former ministers had been recommended for honours.<br />
I have not asked to see any civilian honours lists. I'm assured<br />
no soundings were made. There was one former private member<br />
I noticed, according to thepapers, had been recommended for a<br />
Knighthood. Q. Who was that?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I'd only be repeating newspaper speculation.<br />
All I can say about it is that it would have been the most<br />
remarkable knighthood since Sir Toby Belch. A fortnight ago,<br />
I did say that I was seeking a report on appropriate recognition<br />
of long service or gallantry in the armed forces or in the<br />
uniformed services. This would I've not received it, but<br />
I didn't ask for it as a matter of urgency. I would not expect<br />
it to come to hand for quite some weeks. There would be no<br />
recommendations by this Government, accordingly, for people<br />
in the armed forces or the uniformed services I mean people<br />
like fire brigades and police forces. </p>
<p>-13-<br />
Q. Can you report on the progress of moves to close the<br />
Rhodesian Information Centre in Sydney, and also following'<br />
the latest and yet more stories of Francis James' imminent<br />
release from China can you give us any information about<br />
this? Can you tell us the latest situation?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I wrote, you may remember, to Sir Robert<br />
Askin about the registratio n of a so-called Rhodesian<br />
Information Office under a New South Wales Act. He wrote<br />
back to me, in effect, acknowledging the letter. Now, I might<br />
have had a letter yesterday or today but due to the pressure<br />
of work, as you can imagine, I'm a bit behind with the letters.<br />
I've not seen a substantive reply. On Mr. Francis James,<br />
the answer is exactly the same as it was last time.<br />
Q. Could you give us your tip for who might be elected Leader<br />
of the Opposition by the Liberals?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I've had some big problems on my plate in<br />
the last fortnight but none as great as this. Gentlemen,<br />
this apparently is the last question at the concluding press<br />
conference of this ministry. Therefore, may I take the<br />
opportunity of saying that we will try to follow the same<br />
procedure in the new Ministry. In the meantime, we wish<br />
you as we wish ourselves a restful holiday.<br />
Q. And prosperous?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I hope so. I hope it's a prosperous<br />
New Year but this will require quite a deal of Government action.<br />
In the meantime, a Happy Christmas for us all. </p>
