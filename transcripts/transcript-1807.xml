ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF ASSOCIATED Q. 2APR1968<br />
CH. AMVBERS OF COMMERCE f<br />
HOBART, TASMANIA L/ RA<br />
MARCH 1968<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton<br />
Your Excellency, Mr. Macklin, Ladies and Gentlemen:<br />
it is quite important to me to see gathered here<br />
in this theatre people from the four corners of this nation<br />
and from other countries who are concerning themselves with<br />
seeing that the needs of people in the nation are met, that<br />
the wheels of commerce go round, who are carrying on, really,<br />
the kind of trade on which civilisations were origiftally built.<br />
It may perhaps seem a little far-fetched to you if<br />
I say this, but it is not really as far-fetched as it may<br />
sound, because going way back into the past of history, nations<br />
were brought together because some region or some country<br />
produced whatever it might be let us say silk which other<br />
regions and other countries did not produce but which they<br />
wished to have, and those other countries produced, let us<br />
say, some kind of beaten steel which the first countries did<br />
not have, and so the traders formed their caravans and they<br />
went to fetch from places where it was available, the goods<br />
which other countries wanted. They brought from those other<br />
countries the goods the first countries wanted, and in that<br />
way by enriching themselves it is true but by serving the<br />
needs of people in both places it is also true, they also<br />
managed to bring closer together gradually, through understanding,<br />
those two nations through whom, either in small ships across<br />
the sea, or in caravans across the desert, they carried on the<br />
lifeblood of trade.<br />
Now, of course, things have changed since those<br />
far-off, romantic days, but it is still as necessary as ever<br />
it was that there should be those spending their lives engaged<br />
in disseminating that which is manufactured amongst the people,<br />
engaged, I would hope, more and more in trying to see that<br />
just as we are interdependent inside this country one on the<br />
other, just as you are dependent on good seasons for primary<br />
producers, on full employment, on good purchasing power, on<br />
other matters, so you would see that we were interdependent<br />
internationally, particularly with the countries in our region<br />
and would, as I know you are doing, turn your minds to that<br />
trade going back to what the caravanners used to do.<br />
Together, governments and people build a country;<br />
neither the one or the other can do it alone. A government,<br />
of course, can help or hinder the building of a country and<br />
the improvement of the living standards of those living in<br />
it, but that is all it can do help or hinder, create a<br />
climate or prevent a climate being created, and then it is<br />
up to individuals to take advantage or to fight against a<br />
bad climate, and in that context build together that which<br />
is sought. This of course does pose some difficulties, because,<br />
I suppose, in an ideal world government would be so light and<br />
the requirements would be so small that the individual would<br />
be left almost completely without burdens placed upon him,<br />
able to retain that which his own industry and initiative was </p>
<p>able to achieve. But it is not an ideal world, and indeed not<br />
only does the individual engaged in farming, or in commerce or<br />
in manufacturing or working in a factory or teaching or whatever<br />
it may be, wish to retain as much as his industry and initiative<br />
will allow, but he also wishes many other things, and therefore<br />
requires that burdens should be placed upon him to provide those<br />
other things. In the case of this country, I can enumerate some of<br />
them and at once you will agree with me, I know. It is required<br />
now, in a greater degree than it has ever been required before<br />
in our history, that burdens should be laid upon us so that we<br />
can provide towards our own defence. I think I hardly need to<br />
remind you that for something like 200 years, we have existed<br />
as a nation secure behind the shield of the British Navy and<br />
the British people and that that shield has been removed and<br />
that that changes the situation and the world in which we have<br />
grown up and that that requires that we should be able, as we<br />
have not in the past been able before, to provide sufficient<br />
defence forces to repel any initial shock upon our own shores<br />
should it ever come and to be a credible ally to those countries<br />
to whom we look should we ever require help. This in turn<br />
requires expenditures and burdens which even in the last few<br />
years I speak of " few years" in the context of a nation's<br />
history have risen from some general average of $ 400 million<br />
to $ 1200 millior. and will rise more. The people of a community<br />
want, and you want I know, that we should, if we are to hold up<br />
our head as a civilised nation, pay full attention to the<br />
requirements and the needs of the ill and the aged and the<br />
unfortunate amongst us, and this too requires that burdens<br />
should be laid upon and borne by the people and the nation.<br />
You want, and I know that you want, that we should,<br />
particularly in the world as it is developing today, devote<br />
more and more of your resources to improving the facilities<br />
for education of our youth, and particularly perhaps to improving<br />
the facilities for advanced technological education of our youth,<br />
because in the years to come, the results of that education and<br />
that technological education will decide whether we are able in<br />
this nation, with the other nations of the world, with those in<br />
the forefront of the other nations of the w~ orld, to manufacture<br />
those new things which are being invented and which will be<br />
invented, and through that process of manufacture, see that<br />
commerce does not stagnate, but has new tools with which to<br />
work, has new things to trade. These too require that burdens<br />
should be laid upon a nation.<br />
And you want indeed I have seen your agenda and I<br />
know you want that we should continue to build up our nation<br />
by immigration at least as quickly as we have been doing it,<br />
and quite possibly, if possible, more quickly. But no longer<br />
can this be done or should this be done in the way in which,<br />
for example, the United States built up its population by<br />
immigration in the last century; no more can or should people<br />
just be brought to Australia from overseas and told " Here you<br />
are. You' re on your own. Make your own way". Rather, it is<br />
necessary that they must be not just brought, but provided with<br />
the employment which you help to supply, provided with the<br />
facilities they expect to receive here as they have received<br />
them from the nations from which they came, provided with those<br />
other matters of which I spoke an education for their children,<br />
health benefits and matters of that kind. This requires<br />
expenditure of capital to maintain each migrant. Though we<br />
get it back in years to come, yet at the time it does require<br />
a burden. / 3 </p>
<p>All of these things, I believe the people of Australia<br />
want, and you as members of the Chambers of Commerce want, yet<br />
all of these things do mean that there is more interference by<br />
government with, in some cases, the way in which matters are<br />
done, with in all cases the right of the individual to retain<br />
completely that which he has earned by -his initiative, or<br />
sometimes by his luck. This I know you accept.<br />
Yet there is a point where governments and peoples<br />
must reach a balance in this, There is a point where, while<br />
seeing what needs to be provided for you at your wishes by a<br />
government, while seeing the goals to which we want to attain,<br />
a judgment must be made as to whether should we seek to do too<br />
much in the fields of which I have spoken to you, we would<br />
impose such burdens o-n the individual that we would perhaps<br />
damage or destroy the incentive to work, the requirement to<br />
devote oneself to the business in which one is engaged. That,<br />
of course, is self-destructive because in the long run all<br />
those things I have spoken to you about that you require and<br />
governments provide are only provided if there is incentive to<br />
grow in the individual, if there is requirement to devotion to<br />
one's business in the individual, because that is the basis.<br />
So there is a balance required between those things a nation<br />
wants and between the necessity not to take so much from an<br />
individual's earnings that insufficient is left to him.<br />
There is another balance that is required because it<br />
is not only from things that are taken from money or resources<br />
that are taken from you that a government provides those things<br />
of which I have spoken, a government also, at any rate a central<br />
government, also has the capacity in fact, as you know, to print<br />
its own money, to provide through bank credit, or however it may<br />
be, for some resaurces, and yet there, too, there is though<br />
theoretically no limit, actually and practically a very real<br />
limit because if that path should be followed too far,-then<br />
we destr-oy that other requirement that you have and that a<br />
nation has and that wage-earners have, that pensioners have,<br />
and that is, that there should be relative stability in the<br />
cost-price structures of a nation, relative stability in. : the<br />
cost of living. I don't mean the stagnation, I don't mean the<br />
lack of any general slight inflation but that there should be<br />
sufficient stability to ena) le plans to be made by commerce<br />
and to enable individual pensioners and wage-earners not to be<br />
destroyed by inflation. So there too i~ s another mark which<br />
can't be overstepped. And it is in the selection of priorities, and it is<br />
in the judgment of what should be laid upon a people that the<br />
people will judge a government. A government will, if it is<br />
wise, if it takes the right decisions, provide to a people<br />
those opportunities which., if seized, will make that people<br />
great, and these are the tasks as I see them, on the one hand<br />
for a government, on the other for an Australian people.<br />
I want, before I declare the conference open, to<br />
mention perhaps one more thing, and that is this. I suggest<br />
to you that over the last two decades, if we look back on<br />
them, we can take pride because we have seen this country grow<br />
from a relatively small, relatively insignificant nation to<br />
one which is still not great and which still cannot throw its<br />
weight around in the councils of the world, but one which is<br />
much greater than it was, one which is I think respected in the<br />
world for its attitudes and its approaches, and one which has<br />
within it the seeds of greatness which, if they are nurtured,<br />
will lead, and if the paths followed in the last two decades<br />
are followed, will lead to what I think you would have in your<br />
minds as a picture of the nation you would like Australia to be.<br />
9-s/ 14 </p>
<p>4.<br />
If we follow those paths, we must follow them not<br />
just within this country. I know again that I am echoing what<br />
is in the minds of many of you and of those who are officials<br />
of your organisation when I say let us particularly, let<br />
commerce particularly pay attention, forge links, make trade<br />
with those countries in our region closest to us, with as much<br />
devotion as you can. We believe that it is necessary to try<br />
by all means to build up the edonomies of those closest to us,<br />
and by building up those economies to try to see that the<br />
living standards of the peoples in-those communities rise.<br />
This is humanitarian, but it is more than that. It is, if it<br />
becomes successful, of self-interest to us and to you and to<br />
them. As an example of what I mean, let me draw your minds<br />
to what has happened in our trade, in our nation's trade with<br />
the country of Japan. Only a mere decade ago, about 1955/ 56,<br />
we exported $ 173 million worth of goods from Australia to Japan,<br />
and now that scant time later, we export $ 591 million worth of<br />
goods from Australia to Japan. Ten years ago, we imported some<br />
million from Japan, and now we import close to 6' 300 million.<br />
This is an example of how trade can expand if there is a country<br />
such as Japan with rising living standards, with rising<br />
requirements, with the capacity to buy and the capacity to sell.<br />
As one more example in that country which has become<br />
a country to us of the most significance in trading terms, there<br />
has been a revolution caused in the everyday living of the<br />
Japanese in that as the standard of living has risen, .0o the<br />
requirements which were always there but were not able to be<br />
satisfied have bean able to be met, and the wool which is sold<br />
in such large quantities to Japan has become a fabric that the<br />
Japanese wear, whereas previously they could not afford it and<br />
they could not wear it.<br />
Well, that is Japan, but there is closer to us Thailand<br />
and Indonesia and Malaysia and the Philippines. In all those<br />
areas, as the standard of living rises, so will the opportunity<br />
for them to sell to us and for us to sell to them increase. As<br />
that increases, so will people be coming from there to sell to<br />
us or perhaps forming joint ventures with us in one way and<br />
another and so will we, I hope, be going there to sell to them,<br />
so will you and the manufacturers be going there, I hope, to sell<br />
to them, because as the markets arise there, there will be no<br />
substitute for the old-fashioned kind of salesmanship which we<br />
used to know in Australia door-knocking, visiting, talking<br />
to the buyer. There will be no substitute for this. And if<br />
this happens and you go there, then inevitably, just as in the<br />
past nations were drawn together and learnt about each other<br />
and had mutual benefit because of those who drove the caravans<br />
across the desert or the small ships across the sea, so will<br />
nations the better understand each other, the better know each<br />
other's problems, the better be able to provide technological<br />
assistance, whatever may come back in return for it, and there<br />
will be not only dividends in terms of firms' balance sheets,<br />
but there will be dividends in human relations which will be<br />
more enduring for the future and which because I think you can<br />
and will help in this, is one reason why I camne to declare this<br />
conference open this morning and why I now do so. </p>
