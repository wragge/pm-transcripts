13 DEC W PM. No. 131/ 1967<br />
EXHIBITION OF AUSTRALIAN PAINTING IN INDIA<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr Harold Holt<br />
An exhibition of contemporary A ustralian painting, which<br />
will be seen in several Indian cities over the next few weeks, has opened<br />
in New Delhi. The exhibition is being sponsored by the Commonwealth<br />
Government in co-operation with the Government of India, the Indian<br />
Education Ministry and the Indian Academy of Art.<br />
The exhibition comprises thirty-four paintings. Fourteen<br />
have come from the Australian exhibition at EXPO 67 in Montreal and the<br />
remainder, with two exceptions, from the National Collection. The<br />
exceptions are " The Billy Boy" by William Dobell, lent by the Australian<br />
WTar Memorial, and an Arthur Boyd from a private collection.<br />
The paintings were selected on behalf of the Art Advisory<br />
Board by one of its members, Mr Robert Campbell, CMG, OBE.<br />
Mr Campbell, a former Director of the National Gallery<br />
of South Australia, will travel in India with the exhibition. After New Delhi,<br />
the exhibition will go to Calcutta, Madras and Bombay over a period of<br />
about two and a half months.<br />
It Is hoped that arrangements can be made for the<br />
exhibition to go to Pakistan at the end of the Indian tour.<br />
The exhibition had its origin in the joint communique<br />
issued by the Australian Minister for External Affairs and the Indian Minister<br />
of E~ xternal Affairs at the conclusion of Mr Hasluck's visit to India in March,<br />
1966. The communique stated that increased cultural exchanges would offer<br />
further opportunities for close constructive friendship between India and<br />
Australia. Both Ministers agreed to give immediate attention to developing<br />
further means by which these exchanges might be usefully increased.<br />
The exhibition will further this objec tive and give an<br />
insight into the diversity and vigour of contemporary Australian painting.<br />
UCANBERRA, December, 1967. </p>
