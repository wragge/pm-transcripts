JAkt EMBARGO: 7.00 p. m.<br />
IJ US LI(<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 30 JULY 19789<br />
ELECTORATE. TALK<br />
The Government is encouraged by the latest Consumer Price<br />
Index figures, which show that inflation in Australia is continuing<br />
to fall steadily. The CPI increase of 2.1 percent which has<br />
just been announced was the lowest for any June quiarter since 1972.<br />
Inflation for the 12 months to December last was 9.3 percent;<br />
for the 12 months to March, it was 8.2 percent; and it is now<br />
down to 7.9 percent, the lowest for any period of 12 months<br />
since 1973.<br />
This is a reaffirmation that the Government's anti-inflationary<br />
policies are working. The result shows that the efforts of the last<br />
2k years the fiscal restraint, and monetary control, the<br />
control of expenditure -are paying off.<br />
The Government's budget -finalised this week will set the scene for<br />
a further fall in Australia's inflation rate. We are determined<br />
to press on with our anti-inflation programme. The Budget will leave<br />
no doubt at all that we are sincere in this resolve.<br />
Inflation is a deep-seated disease which destroys jobs, hits hard<br />
and direct at the underprivileged and needy, and erods confidence<br />
throughout business, manufacturing and rural industry. Inflation<br />
is the enemy of any healthy, stable economy, the enemy of<br />
families everywhere.<br />
The fight against inflation is a fight for investment and for jobs.<br />
If a Government neglects chronic inflation and high interest rates,<br />
then the unemployment situation will deteriorate. It is a fact<br />
of life that high inflation and rising interest rates are a deterrent<br />
for investors and that new job opportunities are lost.<br />
There is no alternative in Australia to pressing on with policies<br />
that bear down on inflation and encourage confidence and expansion<br />
in the domestic economy. These same policies are essential for the<br />
improvement of our trading position and thus for further growth at<br />
home generated by trading activity.<br />
Australia is showing the world that we have the will to pursue sound<br />
economic policies. We are determined to place our economy in a<br />
favoured position for a fair share of world investment. Because the<br />
Budget will continue to demonstrate that we are serious about our<br />
determination in overcoming inflation, Australia will1 benefit. 2 </p>
<p>The Government is disappointed at the continuing high level of<br />
unemployment. We have given a good deal of attention to this problem.<br />
However, a number of events have occured which have given less<br />
assistance to the Australian economy than was originally hoped.<br />
There has been less growth in the world economy than one might have<br />
expected a year ago. In some countries inflation has begun to increase<br />
again, which will mean a further tightening of economic policies<br />
overseas. Accordingly, we see no prospect of any dramatic increase in world<br />
trade, or dramatic expansion of world markets. This means Australia<br />
must win a better share of our own domestic markets, and increase<br />
our share of world trade. The latest CPI result is a timely<br />
reminder that while we continue to bring inflation down, we are well<br />
placed to do just this. Whatever the state of world demand or<br />
world trade, countries neect many of Australia's great natural<br />
resources. That is why it is vital that we put ourselves in<br />
a favoured position compared with other supplier countries.<br />
By carrying out responsible economic management policies, by being<br />
active in trade, your Government can create the climate where<br />
permanent job opportunities are made.<br />
However, the Government cannot achieve this alone. We all have<br />
a role to play. We all need to understand that we must work together<br />
to achieve this goal. Grossly excessive and selfish wage demands,<br />
disputes and bans over wage demands these are the kind of<br />
selfish activities that hamper and retard recovery and lead to<br />
continuing high unemployment.<br />
A series of recent disputes show a pattern of trade union activity<br />
which strikes at the economy and at the unemployed. With the support<br />
of the ACTU, trade unions are campaigning for higher wages for<br />
those with jobs at the expense of those without jobs. These union<br />
campaigns contravene the Arbitration Commission indexation<br />
guidelines across a wide range of industries.<br />
Commronwealth Government Shop Stewards in the Department of<br />
productivity have drawn up a log of claims which exceed the<br />
guidelines. So has the Australian, Postal and Telecommunications Union,<br />
which has served a catch-up claim on Australia Post. The Combined<br />
Mining" Unions are reported to have reached an agreement with Utah<br />
which puts at risk indexation guidelines throughout that industry.<br />
Transport and Railway industry unions have decided on a campaign<br />
to overturn Arbitration Commission awards. The Storemen and Packers<br />
Union are pursuing a campaign against chain stores, emptying<br />
supermarket shelves throughout News South Wales. The Vehicle<br />
Builders Employees Federation has imposed national overtime bans at<br />
six motor vehicle plants, despite the difficulties which this<br />
industry is having in its competition with imported cars. There has<br />
been a concerted guerilla campaign of industrial action by the<br />
Builders Labourers Federation, which is halting projects in Victoria<br />
and costing people their jobs. It is preventing project starting.<br />
There are strikes, overtime bans, and work to rule campaigns<br />
in the printing industry in New South Wales.<br />
This wave of industrial action is taking place although earnings have<br />
more than kept pace with inflation. All the figures so far<br />
available show that over the past year, the rise in wages has been<br />
9 percent of higher compared with the latest Consumer Price Index<br />
increase of less than 8 percent. 3 </p>
<p>It is therefore all the more irresponsible that these strikes<br />
and bans are taking place for increases in wages outside the<br />
guidelines with the support of the Australian Council of Trade<br />
Unions. In that respect, the ACTU is supporting higher wages for<br />
those in jobs at the expense of those without jobs.<br />
It is basically supporting a campaign that will maintain high<br />
unemp l oyment.<br />
Because of the importance of these issues, where it is appropriate,<br />
the Government will ask the Prices Justification Tribunal to<br />
inquire into the pricing policies of companies that accept wage<br />
demands outside indexation guidelines.<br />
Unfortunately, because Utah coal is largely exported such an<br />
inquiry is not appropriate in that case. Otherwise, it would have<br />
been announced forthwith, because the Government regards the<br />
settlement that Utah agreed to as outrageous.<br />
Australia today is recovering from the near economic ruin of<br />
the Labor years. Progress is being made in the right direction.<br />
The basic imbalances in the economy that we inherited are being<br />
corrected. Confidence is returning and investors are turning to<br />
Australia. Our next Budget will build on that recovery. It will keep us<br />
on the right path.<br />
It would be a tragedy for Australia if progress were jeopardised<br />
by the self-centered activities of a few union leaders who place<br />
higher wages for those in work ahead of the interests of Australia,<br />
and ahead of the interests of those who are, at the moment,<br />
unemp l oy e d. </p>
