FOPR MEDIA 31 May 1983<br />
Australia will host the 14th Meeting of the South Pacific<br />
Forum in Canberra, from 23-30 August 1983.<br />
This will be the first major international conference hosted<br />
by Australia since my Government came to office. This is<br />
particularly appropriate in view of the great importance<br />
Australia attaches to South Pacific regional co-operation<br />
and its relations with the countries of the. South Pacific.<br />
I look forward to the opportunity that this Meeting will<br />
provide for discussions at Head of Government level on a<br />
range of political and economic issues and particularly on<br />
matters of special concern to Forum member countries.<br />
I am pleased that the Heads of Government of all the Forum<br />
member countries have indicated they will be able to attend.<br />
The member countries are Australia, Cook Islands, Fiji,<br />
Kiribati, Nauru, New Zealand, Niue, Papua New Guinea,<br />
. Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu and Western Samoa.<br />
The Federated States of Micronesia is also an observer<br />
member and will be represented at the Meeting.<br />
The formal Meeting session will take place on 29-30 August<br />
at the Lakeside International Hotel and this will be<br />
preceded by an informal gathering of Forum leaders on<br />
28 August.<br />
Australia has been a member of the Forum since its<br />
foundation in 1971 and hosted the second Forum Meeting<br />
in Canberra in 1972. </p>
