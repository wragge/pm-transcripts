MAfCQUARIE NETWORK WEEKLY BROADCAST 4<br />
BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE RT. HON.<br />
WILLIAM McMAHON, CH, MP. 19 APRIL 1972<br />
D E FE NCE<br />
I want to speak to you now about the defence and<br />
security of Australia. Most of you know that not so many years ago we<br />
relied for our defence on the might of the armed forces of Britain<br />
and America. World War Two and other events, such as the large-scale<br />
British withdrawal East of Suez, and a changed American approach to<br />
its role as world policeman, have changed all that.<br />
There has been another significant change. For<br />
literally hundreds of years the Asian nations remnained unchanged and<br />
unchangeable. In contrast, dramatic changes are now occurring in<br />
Asia. China is becoming a world power. Make no mistake<br />
about that. And there can be no doubt that, as part of her tpolicies,<br />
she is continually promoting insurgency in other countries. For<br />
example, in Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia. These are all close to<br />
US. Even in these conditions, some people argue that we<br />
should not spend so much money on defence because, they say, there<br />
isn't much chance of a direct attack on Australia now.<br />
My answer is that any person who is prepared to take a<br />
risk with the defence of this country is acting in a way that is<br />
completely intColerable. The unexpected can happen, and we have to<br />
prepare for it. In defence you cannot preroare overnight. You cannot<br />
rely on a crash programme. Highly-trained troops with good equipment<br />
are essential. Let mc give you a couple of illustrations of how<br />
quickly conditions can change.<br />
You will remember confrontation between Indonesia and<br />
Malaysia and the possibility that this could spill over into Papua<br />
and New Guinea even closer to us than Indoncsia. You will remember<br />
Communist-inspired insurgency in the North of Malaysia and in Thailand.<br />
You will remember the recent border conflicts between India and Pakistan<br />
and between China and India. And now we have the most serious<br />
invasion of all the blatant and unprovoked attack by the North<br />
Vietnamese against the South Vietnamese. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
We know,. too, of the growing presence of the-Russians<br />
in the Indian Ocean,. and the-assistance'Russia has given to the North_<br />
Vietnamese. We in the Government are not prepared to expose our<br />
own country to similar unexpected attacks. Consequently we must<br />
prepare to meet threats expected or unexpected as they emerge. And<br />
we must be prepared to help our neighbours to the North who are a<br />
shield against attack. There is a further point to be empDhasised. No country<br />
can in all circumstances go it alone. No country can successfully<br />
retreat into isolation. So we have the additional responsibility of<br />
maintaining our treaties and our alliances.<br />
of these the most imp-ortant is with the United States<br />
under the ANZUS Treaty. This Treaty is crucia~ l to our long-term<br />
defence planning because it could be our most important guarantee<br />
in the most critical circumstances. Only a fool or a traitor would<br />
want to throw it away.<br />
It is true that in our defence preparations we must<br />
increasingly strive for self-reliance and self-sufficiency. But we<br />
have to be realists in a world in which no nation c-an stand alone.<br />
The two, that is, our treaties and maximum self-reliance are linked<br />
together. They go together.<br />
Let us go back to ANZUS. Remember it is basically a<br />
military treaty. It would be deadly dangerous to try and turn it into<br />
a human rights declaration, as some people want to do.<br />
ANZUS is also a two-way traffic. We can't expect<br />
everything and give nothing. We must command respect for our own efforts<br />
and willingness to help our friends. That is why we have agreed to have<br />
defence installations at the North-W~ est Cape, at Pine Gap and at Woomera.<br />
I assure you there is nothing sinister or "-nderhand about them. They<br />
are part of our defence -partnership with America. And we are not doing<br />
anything that would make Australia a target in another nation's cause.<br />
We are thinking of our own security and our co-operation with the<br />
United States in mutual defence.<br />
Fina-lly, let me sr~ cak about National Service. This is<br />
the only way at present to keep the Army up to the minimum strength<br />
required to meet our defence needs. So thlis is the question we have<br />
to ask. Whose judgment would you trust : I!--Out the size of our armed<br />
forces? Our military advisers or those who are pledged to abolish<br />
National Service in a bid for political popularity?<br />
To abolish National Service now would upset the w-hole<br />
balance of our forces and would reduce the nation's military strength<br />
to a dangerous degree. We will have none of this.<br />
We, in the Governm~ ent, are realist and national. We<br />
are not adventurers. We have a duty to you and to our allies. So<br />
defence must always be the primary concern of all loyal Australians.<br />
And we in the Government are determined to keen it<br />
that way. </p>
