<p>Good evening. We all know that Australia's farmers are just about</p>
<p> the most efficient and productive in the world - and don't require</p>
<p> subsidies to compete overseas. That's why all Australians have every</p>
<p> right to be deeply angered at the US decision to slap heavy tariffs</p>
<p> on our lamb exports into America.</p>
<p>It has been the can-do attitude of Australian farmers that has created</p>
<p> a market for Australian lamb in the United States without any government</p>
<p> subsidies. When a group of us work hard enough and smart enough to</p>
<p> take on the strongest country in the world only to be punished for</p>
<p> our success, my Government will respond with all means at its disposal.</p>
<p>I expressed our anger and disappointment personally to President Clinton.</p>
<p> I told him that there is no justice in his decision. Our trading partners</p>
<p> can't preach about opening up other markets when they are slamming</p>
<p> the door on Australian lamb producers. I told the President that this</p>
<p> decision helps no one. Consumers in the US will pay higher prices.</p>
<p> American lamb producers will be just as inefficient and Australian</p>
<p> farmers will be slugged for producing a better product.</p>
<p>The Government will stand by Australian lamb producers. We will cut</p>
<p> their costs by effectively cutting in half the transaction levy now</p>
<p> applying to lamb sold in Australia. This arrangement will be for two</p>
<p> years.</p>
<p>We will also establish a Lamb Industry Development Programme worth</p>
<p> up to $3 million per year. This programme will provide grants for</p>
<p> developing infrastructure, building demand for lamb and further boosting</p>
<p> industry productivity and innovation.</p>
<p>On top of this we will take this issue up with the international trade</p>
<p> umpire, the World Trade Organisation.</p>
<p>The Government will not let Australia's farmers down. We will continue</p>
<p> to argue for access to international markets so that the best efforts</p>
<p> and cleverness of Australian farmers can be turned to our national</p>
<p> advantage. Good night.</p>
