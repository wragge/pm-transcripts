COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA<br />
SPEECH BY<br />
The Rt. Hion. SIR ROBERT MENZIES,<br />
M. P.,<br />
ON<br />
INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS<br />
[ From the " Parliamentary Debates," 19th August 1965]<br />
Sir ROBERT MENZIES ( Kooyong-<br />
Prime Minister) Speaker, I must<br />
say that I listened with great interest and<br />
some pleasure to the remarks of the honor-<br />
7j3 ble member for Fremnantle ( Mr. Beazley)<br />
in relation to Malaysia, because I think that<br />
this problem requires a. cool judgment and<br />
a just appreciation of what has been done,<br />
and with what he said on that point I find<br />
myself in complete agreement. We have<br />
hopes-1 hope that they are well foundedfor<br />
a genuine co. operation between<br />
Malaysia and the newly independent State<br />
of Singapore. We have a friendship for both.<br />
We wish them both well, but we do desire<br />
above all things that on those matters on<br />
which co-operation between them is of<br />
great importance they will find it possible<br />
to co-operate in the most effective way. I<br />
do not desire to say any more . tonight about<br />
Malaysia: although it could, lend itself to a<br />
good deal of discussion because this debate<br />
Dohaf s V* iceotnncaemn. t raHteedre , i tsaeglaf ina, roIu fnede l thuen dperr obsolemme<br />
D little embarrassment because several<br />
speeches have been made in the course of<br />
this debate which stale so effectively the<br />
essence of the matter that, coming as I do<br />
tonight, I must feel that I am engaging in<br />
tedious repetition. But, still, this is a matter<br />
of immense controversy. I have been<br />
challenged-I do not know why-more than<br />
once to state the Government's position. I<br />
10143/ 65 thought I had stated it pretty crisply. Therefore,<br />
with great respect to my colleague the<br />
Deputy Prime Minister ( Mr. McEwen) who<br />
made a brilliant exposition of this matter<br />
this afternoon, and others who have spoken,<br />
I will just put it in my own way tonight<br />
in the hope that I can say something reasonably<br />
comprehensive.<br />
The debate began as a debate by the<br />
movement of an amendment by the Leader<br />
of the Opposition ( Mr. Calwell). The terms<br />
of.. the amendment are before honorable<br />
members. I just want to refer to one or two<br />
aspects. The amendment readsthis<br />
House urges the Goverment-<br />
I think this is what might be called -the<br />
operative part of itto<br />
strive for a cease fire now, to be policed<br />
by a United Nations peace-keeping force, and for<br />
a conference of all parties directly involved, including<br />
representatives of both the Government in<br />
Saigon and the Vietcong, to seek a -settlement<br />
which will both end the agony of the Vietnamese<br />
people and establish their right to choose their<br />
own government.<br />
My friend, the honorable member for<br />
Moreton ( Mr. Killen) submitted this to a<br />
somewhat devastating examination, I<br />
thought, this afternoon but I must say<br />
something on my own account. The first<br />
part of the amendment is taken, of course,<br />
from the Prime Minister's Conference. The<br />
honorable gentleman must be aware of the </p>
<p>terms of the resolution carried at the Prime<br />
Minister's Conference, and the setting up<br />
by that conference-matter to which I<br />
shall refer a little later-of a mission<br />
designed to ascertain whether there was<br />
some basis upon which a conference could<br />
be held. To the extent that he adopts that<br />
resolution, of which I was one of the promoters,<br />
I welcome some bipartisan policy<br />
on this vexed matter.<br />
He speaks about the representation of<br />
the Vietcong. I do not want to te dogmatic<br />
about a matter of this kind because,<br />
compared with some other aspects of this<br />
problem, it is not the greatest of matters.<br />
But : I would have thought that there was<br />
some difficulty about having representation<br />
of the Vietcong in such a conference, if<br />
we obtained such a conference, because it<br />
would seem to present difficulties of a kind<br />
that would be inevitab: e in the case of<br />
guerrillas who always work under cover and<br />
are not always susceptible to conference.<br />
Such direct representation would not be<br />
necessary now, strictly speaking, because<br />
what is the Vietcong? It represents<br />
the hands which are ordered by the<br />
voice of Hanoi. Do not let us forget that.<br />
In any conference, if we were lucky enough<br />
to get one, what Hanoi said would go with<br />
the Vietcong. Make no mistake about this.<br />
Therefore, it is with Hanoi, and behind that,<br />
with Peking, that an effective conference<br />
needs to occur.<br />
Then, finally, the Leader of the Opposition<br />
said, I thought rather piously, . that the<br />
Vietnamese ought to be enabled to establish<br />
their right to choose their own<br />
government. That is, in one sense, although<br />
not in every sense, what this war is about<br />
-the right to choose their own government.<br />
They will have no right to choose their<br />
own' government-none whatever-unless<br />
the aggressors are defeated, or unless they<br />
abandon their activities. I would have<br />
thought, that, in famous words, every school<br />
boy would know that to ' be true.<br />
I turn from the terms of the amendment<br />
to offer a few observations on some aspects<br />
of this matter which have given me great<br />
occasion for thought and on which I have<br />
arrived, I think, at clear views, and on<br />
which I think I ought ta state those views.<br />
A lot of people in Australia today-at any<br />
rate, quite a few who write letters, sign<br />
petitions, pass resolutions, or make speeches<br />
somewhere or other-have as their theme: You must negotiate. They have a beautiful<br />
antithesis here. You either negotiate or you<br />
become involved in military operations.<br />
You cannot do both. I have been accused of<br />
over-simplification. About that one, all I can<br />
say is: 0 sancta simplicitas You either<br />
say: " We stand for negotiation", and do<br />
nothing more about it, or you say: " We<br />
want to negotiate but if the condition of<br />
getting to the point of negotiation is to have<br />
some fighting, then the fighting must be<br />
engaged in". Yet these people keep on<br />
writing letters, putting on rather anaemic<br />
looking demonstrations outside Parliament<br />
House and so on. They forget that negotiations<br />
for peace can be usefully engaged in<br />
only by the parties to the conflict.<br />
Honorable members do not suppose, do<br />
they, that two or three countries which have<br />
nothing whatever to do with it are going to<br />
have pleasant little negotiations and say:<br />
" Now we have settled the argument."?<br />
Therefore, the willingness of Hanoi-I use<br />
Hanoi to describe the North Vietnameseto<br />
negotiate is essential. Could anybody with<br />
his five wits, or even with four, deny that<br />
the willingness of Hanoi to negotiate is<br />
essential? If Hanoi is not willing, no negotiation<br />
can occur.<br />
On 10th March of this year, the Commander-<br />
in-Chief of North Vietnam, a very<br />
considerable functionary, after demanding<br />
unconditional withdrawal of American<br />
forces-Hanoi was always putting it up as<br />
a condition for negotiation-said the following<br />
words which I emphasise--<br />
The problem of the peaceful reunification of<br />
Vietnam is the affair of the Vietnamese people.<br />
So far, if I may say so, so good. He then<br />
went on-<br />
It will be settled by the Vietnam Fatherland Front<br />
and the South Vietnamese Liberation Front.<br />
This is brilliant. It would be settled by the<br />
people, meaning the Communists-the<br />
parent Communist organisation and the<br />
son Communist organisation in South Vietnam.<br />
This deserves to go down in history as<br />
a classic of impudence, a classic of the<br />
denial of justice-the kind of democratic<br />
justice to which I would call the attention<br />
of my friends on the opposite benches.<br />
Mr. Michael Stewart, not a member of<br />
my party, but a distinguished Labour<br />
Foreign Minister in Great Britain, has no<br />
ambiguities in his mind on this matter. He </p>
<p>made a speech on 1st April, and I think it is<br />
worthwhile to recall what he said. His<br />
comment was-<br />
The House will notice in that statement-<br />
He referred to the one that I have just<br />
mentionednot only that North Vietnam is not thinking in<br />
terms of conference and negotiation at all but that<br />
the affairs of Vietnam are subsequently to be<br />
settled exclusively by Communist organisations and<br />
that by these principles-<br />
These are Mr. Stewart's words--<br />
no non-Communist in Vietnam would have any<br />
chance of taking part in framing the future of his<br />
country. This view, of course, is confirmed by North<br />
Vietnam itself. When approached by the 17<br />
unaligned countries, several of whom to my<br />
direct knowledge as a result of conferences<br />
are heavily disposed in favour of North<br />
Vietnam, : because they wanted to seek<br />
peace, the reply that . they received from<br />
iNorth Vietnam-I would hate to call it a<br />
dusty answer but it was certainly a dirty<br />
answer-was that the internal affairs of<br />
South Vietnam must be settled by the South<br />
Vietnamese people themselves, in accordance<br />
with the programme of the South<br />
Vietnam National Liberation Front, without<br />
any foreign interference.<br />
I only need remind the House, because<br />
I want to put this fairly comprehensively,<br />
, that the ' National Liberation Front is a<br />
popular Communist technique nowadays. A<br />
National Liberation Front was established in<br />
Thailand. In 1960, by order from Hanoi,<br />
the National Liberation Front, which is<br />
now a subordinate part of the central office<br />
operating from Hanoi was established in<br />
South Vietnam. Yet, in spite of having<br />
received letters-not too many, but somen<br />
spite of having read from occasion to<br />
-, occasion, not too closely, some of the statements<br />
made by various people, some of<br />
them academic and some of them no<br />
doubt intelligent, and in spite of having<br />
cast my eye over these matters I have not,<br />
from first to last, been able to discover any<br />
pressure being put by any of these people<br />
on Hanoi. All the pressure has been put on<br />
the defending -countries like the United<br />
States and ourselves whose great desire is<br />
to achieve a just peace, protecting the<br />
rights of all the people of South Vietnam<br />
to self determination without external or<br />
internal armed threat and, we would hope,<br />
under some form of international guarantee. ' By a singtlar -feat of -mental . gymnastics<br />
some , vocal people -in our own country have<br />
worked -out some astonishing propositions.<br />
I have noted these because I ' have ' been on<br />
the ' receiving end of one or two rather<br />
abusive remarks by people whose works I<br />
had otherwise rather enjoyed. They put up<br />
propositions along these lines: " If you believe<br />
that Communist armed aggression in<br />
and. against South Vietnam should be resisted<br />
in the common interest, including our own,<br />
by arms, then you. are the enemy of peace<br />
All honorable members have heard it stated<br />
that to us-or is it to peace" is<br />
a dirty word. The basis of the statement is<br />
that if you believe in the things that I have<br />
just mentioned you are the enemy of peace.<br />
But you have your choice. You have your<br />
way of escape. If you abandon South Vietnam<br />
and do your best to persuade other<br />
nations, and, in particular the United States,<br />
to do likewise, in the result you leave all of<br />
South East Asia to its fate and then, believe<br />
it or not, you are the friend of peace. This<br />
is the new -series of propositions which a<br />
lot of people, some of whom are well meaning,<br />
! have been advancing. Clearly such<br />
people are prepared to secure peace by<br />
surrender or flight. In other words, they<br />
want peace at any price.<br />
Suppose the people and the Government<br />
of Australia adopted these views. What<br />
would . be . involved? l want to traverse this<br />
with some care because I think that our<br />
people have a right to understand exactly<br />
what is involved. I repeat-what would be<br />
involved? In the first place, we would need<br />
to repudiate our obligations under<br />
S. E. A. T. O. and A. N. Z. U. S. since each of<br />
these pacts involves mutuality of obligations.<br />
We have not heard much for some time<br />
about S. E. A. T. O. . and A. N. Z. U. S. It used<br />
to be rather a kind of parlour game in this<br />
House to argue about S. E. A. T. O. and<br />
A. N. Z. U. S. and what they mean. I hope<br />
honorable members will forgive me if I<br />
remind them and place on record consecutively<br />
what they mean. In 1954 we<br />
passed an Act of Parliament to ratify the<br />
South East Asia Collective Defence Treaty.<br />
The preamble to the Act was challenged<br />
by the then Leader of the Opposition but<br />
the challenge was not carried to a vote.<br />
The challenge was that we had selected<br />
Communism and had not extended the provisions<br />
of the Bill to cover other forms of </p>
<p>activity. In any case, the preamble was carried<br />
unanimously by both parties in this<br />
House with no division being sought The<br />
preamble is in these terms-<br />
Whereas the independence and integrity of the<br />
countries and territories of South East Asia and<br />
the South West Pacific are threatened by the<br />
aggressive policies of international Communism:<br />
And whereas those Communist policies have<br />
already shown themselves in Korea, Indo-China<br />
and elsewhere by armed aggression, by armed<br />
insurrection assisted from without and otherwise:<br />
And whereas those Communist policies represent<br />
a common danger to the security of Australia<br />
and of the world generally and are a violation<br />
of the principles and purposes of the Charter of<br />
the United Nations<br />
I have read sufficient of the preamble to<br />
the Bill which was passed by this House<br />
although, as I have indicated, it was<br />
criticised by the then Leader of the Opposition<br />
because it should have included a reference<br />
to Fascism as well as to Communism.<br />
There it is, now part of an Act of this<br />
Parliament. Now let me turn to the Treaty.<br />
I do not think any honorable member dared<br />
to vote against the Treaty to which not only<br />
Australia but also New Zealand, Great<br />
Britain and Northern Ireland, the United<br />
States, Pakistan, the : Philippines, Thailand<br />
and France were parties. The preamble to<br />
the Treaty is as follows-<br />
Intending to declare publicly and formally their<br />
-sense of unity, so that any potential aggressor will<br />
appreciate that the Parties stand together in the<br />
area. Article II of the Treaty, a very important<br />
article, states-<br />
In order more effectively to achieve the objectives<br />
of this Treaty, the Partie:;, separately and jointly-<br />
Let the House mark those words " separately<br />
and jointly<br />
by means of continuous and effective self-help<br />
and mutual aid will maintain and develop their<br />
individual and collective capacity to resist armed<br />
attack and to prevent and counter subversive<br />
activities directed from without against their territorial<br />
integrity and politioal stability.<br />
Could there have been in anticipation a<br />
better description of what is going on in<br />
South Vietnam and what, as I will show,<br />
the Leader of the Opposition admits is going<br />
on in South Vietnam? I come now to<br />
Article IV of the Treaty. It reads-<br />
Each Party recognises that aggression by means<br />
of armed attack in the treaty area against any of<br />
the Parties or against ar. y State or territory which<br />
the Parties by unanimous agreement may hereafter<br />
designate-South Vietnam was unanimously so designatedwould<br />
endanger its own peace and safety, and<br />
agrees that it-<br />
Meaning each partywill<br />
in that event act to meet the common danger<br />
in accordance with its constitutional processes.<br />
We, like the United States, have regarded<br />
that Treaty as imposing upon us separate as<br />
well as joint responsibilities. That is what<br />
the Treaty provided expressly and clearly.<br />
Later in the Article, of course-and I say<br />
this only to complete the story-it was provided<br />
that no action on the territory of any<br />
such designated State-South Vietnam, to<br />
wit-shall be taken except at the invitation<br />
or with the consent of the Government concerned.<br />
In the case of South Vietnam, of<br />
course, this condition has been fulfilled.<br />
So much for S. E. A. T. O. What is our<br />
position under which was<br />
ratified by an Act of this Parliament in<br />
1952? The treaty itself states in Article IV-"<br />
Each party recognises that an armed attack in<br />
the Pacific area on any of the parties would be<br />
dangerous to its own peace and safety and<br />
declares that it would act to meet the common<br />
danger in accordance with its constitutional processes. 19)<br />
Then there is a very interesting article from<br />
our point of view, Article V, which says-<br />
For the purpose of Article IV an armed attack<br />
on any of the parties is deemed to include an<br />
armed attack on the metropolitan territory of any<br />
of the parties--<br />
That is, on Australia proper, to bring it<br />
right homeor<br />
on the island territories under its jurisdiction<br />
in the Pacific-<br />
In our case, Papua and New Guinea, for<br />
instanceor on its armed forces, public vessels or aircraft<br />
in the Pacific.<br />
As the Pacific clearly means the Pacific<br />
area, an attack on troops, American troops,<br />
Australian troops, New Zealand troops, is<br />
of the highest significance.<br />
I say no more about that answer to the<br />
question of what would be involved. I come'<br />
now to the other answers to the question:<br />
What would be involved if we did what we<br />
are sometimes told we should do? The<br />
second result would be that we would be<br />
adopting a policy of isolation and neutrality.<br />
There is no middle course here, just the<br />
adoption of a policy of isolation and<br />
neutrality, with, as a consequence, the<br />
abandonment of any right to expect any </p>
<p>other nation to aid us in our own defence.<br />
If it is good enough for us to be isolated<br />
or neutral then it is good enough for the<br />
other man, so far as we are concerned, to<br />
be isolated or neutral. It would also involve<br />
the further adoption-and let us face up<br />
to this although it is -a hard choice or a hard<br />
proposition-of a national policy in Australia<br />
of unarmed pacificism or a defence<br />
policy involving a . provi: iion adequate to<br />
secure. our , country,, by our own efforts<br />
against attack by any enemy, however<br />
powerful and however armed.<br />
One has only to state these matters-at<br />
the risk of oversimplification as opposed to<br />
overcomplication-to see that each of these<br />
courses is unthinkable. Each of them would<br />
be tantamount to national siUicide, and we<br />
must therefore face the facts. The facts are<br />
that we must honour our international<br />
obligation, we must refuse to desert our<br />
friends and we must pursue defence policies<br />
: 9) esigned to enable us to make effective contributions<br />
to the common defence against<br />
Communist aggression. This policy, if it<br />
needs explanation, is the one pursued by<br />
my Government.<br />
Of course we would all wish to see a<br />
._ enuine peace conferenc: e, but what has<br />
happened? At the risk of wearying the<br />
House I just want to elaborate what my<br />
colleague stated in admirably summary form<br />
this afternoon. The document tabled by the<br />
Minister for External Affairs ( Mr. Hasluck),<br />
and which I hope will be read by all honorable<br />
members, sets out the efforts that have<br />
been made towards a peaceful settlement.<br />
I say at the very beginning that the Conspicuous<br />
feature of these efforts is that none<br />
of them was made by Peking or Hanoi. Let<br />
this be remembered by every person who<br />
:, ilgoes to some meeting or teach-in or some<br />
' sit-in, as one honorable member described<br />
it-and wants to be gulled by a lot of<br />
theoreticians. None of these efforts was<br />
made by Hanoi or Peking.<br />
When the United States in August 1964<br />
took to the Security Council-and we hear<br />
a lot about the United Nations and why<br />
we should be approaching that organisation<br />
-the Tonkin Gulf incident, Hanoi refused<br />
to attend. The people in Hanoi said that<br />
they had not started the trouble, and in<br />
any event they refused to attend. They said<br />
categorically-and they have stuck to it<br />
ever since-that the matter of Vietnam was not within the competence of the Security<br />
Council. Yet there are some honorable<br />
members who bamboozle themselves into<br />
believing that all you have to do is to take<br />
the matter to the United Nations. Hanoi<br />
had no truck with such ideas, contending<br />
that the Vietnam matter was not within the<br />
competence of the Security Council.<br />
When the greatly respected Secretary-<br />
General of the United Nations, U Thant,<br />
wanted to visit Peking and Hanoi-and he<br />
could not be represented as the humble<br />
obedient servant of the Western bloc-in<br />
April of this year, there was a contemptuous<br />
rejection of any United Nations intervention.<br />
Further approaches were made by the<br />
United States, which also sought to promote<br />
action by the Security Council. Peking<br />
rejected such action in advance. It did not<br />
wait for the action to be taken, but rejected<br />
it in advance. It is very interesting to recall<br />
that the United Kingdom proposed to the<br />
Soviet Union that both countries, having<br />
provided co-chairmen of the 1954 Geneva<br />
Conference-a conference which some<br />
honorable members have been saying should<br />
be resumed-should invite the parties to get<br />
busy and state their views. The Soviet reply<br />
was a condemnation of the United States<br />
and a demand for the withdrawal of the<br />
United States forces from Vietnam, a<br />
demand which I have not yet discovered has<br />
been made by the Opposition, although I<br />
will have something to say about that before<br />
I conclude. Then the greatly respected Patrick<br />
Gordon Walker, whom many of us know,<br />
was sent out by the present British Government,<br />
which is not of my political complexion,<br />
to see whether he might bring the<br />
chance of a conference with him. Both<br />
Peking and Hanoi declined to receive him.<br />
They would have nothing to do with him,<br />
a man of the highest character and with the<br />
most high minded desire to achieve peace if<br />
possible. In April of this year ' President<br />
Johnson said in a famous speech that he was<br />
ready for unconditional discussion. Peking<br />
and Hanoi made a reply in their exquisite<br />
jargon, saying that this was a swindle pure<br />
and simple. In May the Canadian representative<br />
on the International Control<br />
Commission, which some people have been<br />
saying should be brought into function,<br />
wanted to talk with the Peking and Hanoi<br />
Governments. He was rebuffed. </p>
<p>Then at the Commonwealth Prime Ministers'<br />
Conference-and I will say more about<br />
that in a little while-a Commonwealth<br />
mission was proposed and supported. . It -has<br />
not succeeded in making any contact with<br />
any of the Communist countries at all. Then<br />
Mr. Harold Davis, a junior Minister, well<br />
known to be very friendly towards . North<br />
Vietnam and quite receivable, went off to<br />
North Vietnam, having obtained a visa<br />
through the kind instrumentality of some<br />
North Vietnamese journalists. He went to<br />
Hanoi. I have read the report that he made.<br />
He was received quite affably by the people<br />
who were not in charge, but he literally<br />
was not allowed -to see any Minister or any<br />
person in authority in. North Vietnam.<br />
I have already referred ' to the attempt<br />
made by the 17 non-aligned nations, some<br />
of them far from unfriendly towards North<br />
Vietnam and, perhaps, far from friendly<br />
towards the United States. They met the<br />
singular fate, which must have come as a<br />
shock to some of them, of being described<br />
by the Communist authorities as ' the Trojan<br />
-horse of American imperialism. Well, I<br />
have -heard so many , peeches against imperialism<br />
by some of the people who have<br />
now become described as the Trojan horse<br />
that this shocks me; but it further exhibits<br />
the fact that we are dealing with people in<br />
the north who will insult their friends in<br />
other parts of Asia or in Africa so long as<br />
it enables them to maintain their campaign<br />
to overrun, to tyrannis,' and . to destroy.<br />
The President of India-I do not think<br />
anybody would have suggested he was a<br />
war-monger, unlike me--<br />
Mr. James.-How true.<br />
Sir ROBERT MENZIES.-You always<br />
prefer the people of countries other than<br />
your own, therefore I am bound to say that<br />
you will agree he is not a war-monger, because<br />
he is not an Australian. But the President<br />
of India made an approach and<br />
Peking's reply was that this was preposterous<br />
in the extreme. ' When an unexpected<br />
combination got together, India and Yugoslavia-<br />
they are not identical politically,<br />
Tito practicing his own form of detached<br />
Communism-they were both rewarded for<br />
their pains by being described by the people<br />
whom the Opposition thinks it is simple to<br />
get a conference with as the errand boys<br />
of America. Now Sir, all -these events must surely convince<br />
all Australians, who have not been<br />
completely taken in by Communist propaganda,<br />
of three things; first, that all peaceful<br />
approaches to the aggressors are doomed<br />
to failure while the aggressors think they<br />
are ' winning or will win by force of arms;<br />
secondly, that invoking the United Nations<br />
in . this rather febrile way is at present quite<br />
futile; and thirdly, that talk about -the<br />
Geneva Accords or the International ' Control<br />
Commission will be non-productive.<br />
Now Sir, all -that, or most of it, describes<br />
what has gone on elsewhere. But at this<br />
last . Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference<br />
we had something to say and . do<br />
about this matter and I think I ought ' to<br />
put it before the House and the people.<br />
The Prime Minister of Great Britain, at<br />
the very commencement of our meeting,<br />
produced a plan for the setting up of a<br />
mission consisting of Prime Ministers to<br />
make contact on behalf of the Commor<br />
wealth with the parties principally concernea,<br />
with the problem of Vietnam and to ascertain<br />
-whether some basis could be found for<br />
a conference. Just let me remphasise this<br />
point: The mission was not to negotiate. It<br />
would have found negotiation difficult be<br />
cause it contained within itself an immense<br />
variety -of views, some being not dissimilar<br />
from my own and some being not like my<br />
own. They were a mixture. Therefore, the<br />
whole , point was that the mission was to<br />
see whether a basis for conference could<br />
be found. That was an honorable task. The<br />
mission was to go and talk to these people<br />
and, without committing itself to any particular<br />
view as . to the merits, see whether<br />
there was some'basis for a conference.<br />
The Prime Minister of Great Britain took<br />
advantage of a talk that he and I were<br />
having a day or two before to explain<br />
his idea to me. He did that because, no<br />
doubt, I happen to be, nowadays, the senior<br />
Prime Minister. I considered the matter<br />
overnight and, having reflected on it, I<br />
told him that I would strongly support the<br />
proposal. In the result, with some opposition,<br />
but not much, the plan was adopted. The<br />
mission was made up of the Prime Ministers<br />
of Great ' Britain, of Nigeria, and -of Trinidad<br />
and Tobago, and the President of<br />
Ghana. Those men represented a variety<br />
of views. The Prime Minister of Nigeria,<br />
Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa, is a very distinguished,<br />
and in my opinion, a very wise </p>
<p>man. The Prime Minister of Trinidad and<br />
Tobago,, Dr.. Williams, is known, no doubt,<br />
to quite a few of my colleagues, and the<br />
President of Ghana is Dr. Nkrumah. As<br />
the agreed final communique said-<br />
We reviewed the various efforts which had been<br />
made to achieve a peaceful s. olution.<br />
This statement was made on behalf of<br />
all of us-21 Prime Ministers, several of<br />
whom had feelings disposed in favour of<br />
North Vietnam. We had reviewed the<br />
various efforts which had been made to<br />
achieve a peaceful solution and I just<br />
emphasise once more that it is worthy of<br />
note that not one of those efforts ihad been<br />
made either by Peking or Hanoi. It is not<br />
surprising, therefore, that the Commonwealth's<br />
mission has ncot succeeded in<br />
making contact with either of these governments.<br />
Yet, Sir, the statement of guidance<br />
worked out by our conference exhibited a<br />
easonableness which no nation with any<br />
_. al desire for peace could have refused to<br />
examine. I do not want to trench too much on the<br />
time of the House and therefore I shall not<br />
_ read all these passages, but I will take the<br />
&gt; portunity, Sir, with the permission of<br />
, i'e House, to table the communique because<br />
the. document. does contain the guide lines<br />
which were worked out for this mission<br />
-if the mission ever. got to. first base. While<br />
the. aggressors are-conteraptuously rejecting<br />
all peaceful propositions and pressing<br />
on, with their evil activities, there is an<br />
element in Australia which is, whether it<br />
realises it. or not, conducting propaganda<br />
directed. to, the desertion of South Vietnam<br />
by the Americans and by the rest of us, the<br />
grave weakening of South Vietnam's<br />
/--efence, the abandonment of Thailand and<br />
talaysia, victory for Peking and Hanoi and<br />
the dramatic encouragement of Communist<br />
influence and control even nearer to Australian<br />
shores. The propaganda is directed<br />
to these. ends whether people realise it or<br />
I ask the Australian people who fully<br />
realise the dangers involved for our own<br />
country to understand the conscious or unconscious<br />
objectives of muich of the current<br />
agitation for the withdrawal of Australian<br />
troops and therefore, presumably of<br />
American troops, since to urge the withdrawal<br />
of Australian troops and the retention<br />
of American: troops would be a shocking incident in Australia's history. If that<br />
agitation succeeded and South Vietnam were<br />
abandoned, North Vietnam and its Communist<br />
terrorists, the Vietcong, would of<br />
course be vastly encouraged and aided; the<br />
last lingering hope of peace negotiations<br />
except on the basis of surrender to military<br />
conquest would disappear; S. E. A. T. O. would<br />
have failed, since the obligations under it<br />
would, have been repudiated and other South<br />
Asian countries would be left to fend for<br />
themselves against overwhelming odds, and<br />
the defence position of Australia would be<br />
immeasurably weakened.<br />
Dr. J. F. Cairns.-We have still got you.<br />
Sir ROBERT MENZIES.-Yes, but you<br />
almost cancel me out. Two other matters,<br />
Sir, must be remembered. First of all, if<br />
it is wrong for Australia to take an active<br />
part in the defence of South Vietnam against<br />
aggression, I wonder how it can be right<br />
for us to take an active part in the defence<br />
of Malaysia. against aggression. Is there<br />
some lack of virtue in Indonesian aggressors<br />
which does not apply to the Communist<br />
aggressors? Where do the present agitators<br />
stand on that matter? Perhaps they will say<br />
that there is no aggression against South<br />
Vietnam. All I can say-in a homely phrase<br />
-is that they can tell that to the American<br />
Marines. In the second place, victory for Communism<br />
in South East Asia would not only<br />
spell disaster and degradation to the millions<br />
of people in that area who desire to be left<br />
alone to live in peace and, with the aid of<br />
more fortunate countries, develop their resources<br />
and raise their own living standards;<br />
it would,, in world terms, represent an<br />
alteration in the world balance of power in<br />
favour of the Communist powers and it<br />
would so increase the risks of world war.<br />
Sir, this needs great emphasis: As the<br />
democracies have learned, retreat and<br />
appeasement do not produce a true or lasting<br />
peace. They give aid and comfort to<br />
the aggressors. They hasten the day when<br />
the aggressor feels able to strike on the<br />
grand scale successfully. They encourage<br />
future wars. They -do grievous harm to that<br />
cause-the cause of peace-which their<br />
advocates delude themselves into believing<br />
that they are supporting. On any reasoned<br />
view of this grim problem it is of course<br />
not possible ' to attack the presence of Australian<br />
forces without attacking the presence </p>
<p>of the United States and of other non-Vietnamese<br />
forces. But does the Australian<br />
Labour Party attack the United States presence<br />
and actions? This is interesting to me.<br />
It is very difficult to keep up with the Labour<br />
Party because it is-as you might sayhere<br />
today and gone tomorrow on these<br />
matters of policy and, indeed, on all other<br />
matters. But at least, I hope that occasionally<br />
one must be able to read something<br />
that the Labour Party says, and think: This<br />
is it. The honorable member for Bendigo ( Mr.<br />
Beaton) is interjecting. Listen to this; it will<br />
do you the world of good. This may not<br />
have reached you in the fastnesses of<br />
Bendigo. A Labour Party information release<br />
was issued on 18th February 1965. I<br />
have the one I got. Optimistically it says,<br />
on the last page: " Additional copies of this<br />
statement may be obtained from the Australian<br />
Labour Party's Federal Secretariat<br />
on request". If the honorable member has<br />
not had one I will pay the postage to have<br />
it sent to him. I just want to quote what<br />
this Labour Party, now so ambiguous, now<br />
so defeatist, now so unreal, had to say only<br />
in February of this year. I cannot read all<br />
of the document, but it professes to be the<br />
complete text of the resolution unanimously<br />
adopted by the Federal Parliamentary<br />
Labour Party Executive at its meeting in<br />
Sydney on Thursday, ,' 8th February 1965;<br />
and the Federal Parliamentary Labour<br />
Party's Executive had before it the unanimous<br />
recommendation of the Foreign<br />
Affairs Committee of the Parliamentary<br />
Party. When you have unanimity piled on<br />
unanimity ' I suppose one may hope:<br />
Roughly, this is what they believe The<br />
first thing that I want to refer to is this<br />
statement-In its statement to thio Security Council on<br />
February 7th, reporting * he air strikes against<br />
military installations in the south of North Vietnam,<br />
America insisted th: at its object in South<br />
Vietnam, while resisting a: ggression, is to achieve<br />
a peaceful settlement maintained by the presence<br />
of international peacekeeping machinery and that<br />
it would not allow the situation to be changed by<br />
terror and violence.<br />
This statementsaid<br />
this unanimous body-<br />
-of American purposes is unexceptionable and<br />
the case for the American action of recent days,<br />
as based on the aim of shortening the war and<br />
achieving a negotiated settlement, which would<br />
establish and maintain the rights of the South<br />
Vietnamese people, deserves sympathetic Australian<br />
understanding. Nothing could be better. Later in the<br />
course of the same document the same<br />
people, unanimously, I suppose, unless<br />
unanimity had faded away halfway through<br />
the page, say this-and let everybody<br />
remember this, because I think that really<br />
if a lot of this is true we are almost on a<br />
bi-partisan policy-<br />
The demand of the Soviet Government for the<br />
immediate departure of all American and other<br />
foreign forces from South Vietnam would be in<br />
the interests neither of the people of South Vietnam<br />
nor the people of Australia. Its immediate<br />
consequence must be a Communist takeover of<br />
South Vietnam, snuffing out the hope of freedom<br />
and the democratic independence of that country<br />
and extending the area of Communist control<br />
closer to this country.<br />
I say to honorable members opposite: This<br />
is not a lot of reactionary Tories speaking.<br />
This is your crowd speaking-at least, last<br />
February. The document continues-<br />
The presence of those forces is necessary an-4-x<br />
justified as a holding operation provided that<br />
efforts are bent towards the objects set out b)&gt;<br />
the American Government in its message to the<br />
Security Council. In other words, the presence<br />
of these forces is justified as a temporary means<br />
to an end and not an end in itself.<br />
The object must be, at a proper time and in<br />
circumstances enabling the people of South Vie<br />
nam a free choice, to allow them to decide b.,<br />
their own votes on their own government and<br />
to ensure the physical independence of that government.<br />
Sir, this is, I think, remarkable and worthy<br />
of applause. I will undertake to say that it<br />
is in the teeth of the views that will be<br />
heard from one or two honorable members<br />
sitting opposite, if there is any importance<br />
to be placed on consistency. The Leader<br />
of the Opposition who, I know, believes all<br />
that himself-twisted and distorted by<br />
recent events, but in his heait, of course.<br />
he believes those th'ings to be true-earlie-'<br />
this year when we had a debate said two<br />
things that are very accurate and memorable.<br />
He said-<br />
That there has long been and still is aggression<br />
from the north and subversion inspired from the<br />
north, I do not for one moment deny.<br />
( Later on he said-<br />
The object of the Vietcong in the war-this<br />
guerrilla war-is to avoid, as far as possible, direct<br />
entanglement with massed troops in order that<br />
by infiltration, subversion and terrorism, they may<br />
control villages, hamlets, outposts and small communities<br />
wherever these are most vulnerable.<br />
These are brilliant and descriptive words.<br />
I do not know how they disappeared from<br />
the Labour Party's vocabulary, because in </p>
<p>the current debate my: honorable friend<br />
the Leader . of the Opposition, under the<br />
most terrible pressures: undoubtedly: and<br />
obviously, instead of.. repeating these.. statements,<br />
or anything like them, said of my<br />
Government that we. proposed . to send. conscripts<br />
to fight in a foreign land-that sounds<br />
exactly like the, United States of: America<br />
because we' are . defending . certain Vietnamese,<br />
from'. certain other' Vietnamese. . O<br />
what a fall was.-there,' my countrymen,<br />
from . the robust statement -that ' here, was<br />
aggression , from . the North and subversion<br />
in the South, fomenled from : the. North;<br />
to this'watery statement that, after'all, all<br />
we'are doing is to defand some Vietnamese<br />
from other Vietnamese. K<br />
Then he made the most remrkable statement<br />
I have listened to foi years. He said<br />
that we are driving North Vietnam right<br />
into the arms of China because we are<br />
resisting the power of China. Of all the<br />
Spusillanimous statements ever made in the<br />
House, it must be the all time high. I do not<br />
believe he thought of it. I do not believe<br />
-he meant it. No man who said what he said<br />
before could possibly produce such utter<br />
Snonsense. The moral is: Do not resist China<br />
and then you will not drive North Vietnam<br />
into their arms; and do not resist North<br />
Vietnam because it will save you a lot of<br />
trouble, and who are the South Vietnamese<br />
anyway? I suppose this astonishing proposi-<br />
, tion would apply also to the United States<br />
of America. That would be a reasonable<br />
inference. On the basis that we want to<br />
, leave it all to the United States, it would<br />
be a reasonable inference. But the Leader of<br />
the Opposition, coming back from this<br />
excursion into fancy, goes on to say in this<br />
very speech-<br />
S The British presence in Asia is essential to<br />
India, Malaysia, and Au; tralia, just as the United<br />
States presence in this area is essential to the<br />
security of the area.<br />
Where do they stand? What is the policy or<br />
position of this Party?<br />
Before I conclude, I want to say a word<br />
about the position of the United States. I<br />
am satisfied-and I was confirmed in this<br />
in my talks in Washington at one time or<br />
another-that the American approach to<br />
this problem is in reality just the same as<br />
ours. No sane per; on--I emphasise the<br />
word " sane"-could say that American<br />
forces are being used in Vietnam for the<br />
preservation of interests peculiar to<br />
10143/ 65,-2 America. -Does any honorable member<br />
oppositesay that? Speak up. Now is your<br />
chance. Well, you do not say it. So far<br />
we' are in agreement. I repeat: No sane<br />
person could say that American forces are<br />
being used in Vietnam for the preservation<br />
of interests peculiar-to -America; for the<br />
protection 6f American trade, or in pursuance<br />
of some'other sinister' imperialist plot<br />
to take over a'South East Asian' country.<br />
Clearly,' the Ainericans arethere' to defend<br />
a world order, the defence of which is the<br />
prime purpose of the creation of the United<br />
Nations,. and imposes duties upon every<br />
member nation.<br />
In Washington, on the 10th of this<br />
month,' Mr. ' Dean Rusk, the distinguished<br />
Secretary of State, was being interviewed.<br />
He was asked what the commitment was to<br />
South Vietnam. I will not read out in full<br />
what he said. But he began by saying-<br />
We have a very simple commitment to South<br />
Vietnam. The first point he mentioned was-<br />
It derives out of the South East Asia Treaty-<br />
It is exactly the same view, honorable<br />
members will observe, as I have indicated<br />
tonight about the separate as well as joint<br />
responsibilities. Mr. Dean Rusk mentioned<br />
other matters. He went on to say-<br />
Now, there is no need to parse these commitments<br />
in great detail. The fact is that we know<br />
we have a commitment-<br />
This is the United States-<br />
The South Vietnamese know we have a commitment.<br />
The communist world knows we have a<br />
commitment. Mr. Rusk continued-<br />
Now, this means that the integrity of the<br />
American commitment is at the heart of this problem.<br />
I believe that the integrity of the American<br />
commitment is the principal structure of peace<br />
throughout the world.<br />
But, Sir, true as that is, such defence cannot<br />
be left to the United States alone. Let<br />
me remind honorable members that the<br />
American people, living at peace in a vast<br />
and thickly populated country geographically<br />
remote from South East Asia<br />
would probably resent the notion that the<br />
United States of America is the world's<br />
policeman, and that countries like our own<br />
can leave it to the Americans. The free<br />
world has become so accumstomed to massive<br />
aid going out from the United States<br />
of America to. a score of countries that it </p>
<p>may sometimes be tempted to regard it as<br />
commonplace and inevitable. But it is<br />
neither. The United States has had its own<br />
long periods of isolationism, twice shattered<br />
in this century by world wars. It. is to the<br />
immeasurable advantage of world peacepeace<br />
without surrender-that ever since the<br />
Second World War, the United States has<br />
not only been the greatest world power but<br />
also has handsomely accepted the responsibilities<br />
which flow from great power.<br />
The real enemies of world peace are those<br />
who ignore or reject this central truth of<br />
modern history and promnote hatred or<br />
distrust of America at every opportunity.<br />
Sir, there are some such in Australia, who<br />
talk of peace as if the mere wish for. it is<br />
sufficient, and -then attack its active protectors<br />
as if they were the enemies of the very element which many of them are<br />
shedding their blood and expending their<br />
resources to defend.<br />
This does not mean that Governments<br />
like our own, which understand and<br />
appreciate the American policy and action,<br />
are -mere puppets moved by strings under<br />
American control. We occupy a respectable<br />
place in American thinking. We are, and<br />
they so regard us, an adult community<br />
with notable achievements and a great<br />
future. We are quite capable of offering<br />
our views, critical or otherwise, to Washington,<br />
and we do it every week. But we make<br />
no -apologies to our own people for niever<br />
losing sight of the basic truths ' to which I<br />
have referred, or allowing to be clouded the<br />
common elements which lead us, as in<br />
Vietnam, to common action. Km .9<br />
