FOR PRESS: 86/ 1967<br />
DEATH OF LORD BJRUCE.<br />
Tribute from the Prime iEinister,<br />
Harold Holt.<br />
Stanley Bruce died with honours thick upon him from<br />
a long life of eminent achievemrent.<br />
It was an active life that wion him distinction as<br />
a soldier, as a parliamentarian, in public service and in the<br />
academic and sporting fields.<br />
He was an Australian statesman who kept Australia's<br />
name high and respected in whatever he did. But he earned<br />
recognition outside his own country as a statesman of the<br />
world. He will be remembered as one of Australia's most<br />
distinguished Prif.-e M . inisters; as our first President of the<br />
League of Nations; and as our first citizen to be made a<br />
Member of the House of Lords, where he established himself as<br />
a spokesman for Australia's interests.<br />
His wide--ranging vision was always directed to<br />
practical ends. The : V1orld Food Council, the British Finance<br />
Council, the Australian Loan Council and the CSIRO exemplify<br />
the practical bent of his statesmanship.<br />
In mourning his passing, Australia honours the<br />
memory of his many notable services with appreciation and<br />
gratitude. CANBERRA. 29th August, 1967. </p>
