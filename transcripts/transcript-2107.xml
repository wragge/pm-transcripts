Details of Action: On 24 May 1969 Warrant Off icer Payne was serving as a<br />
Company Commander in a Mobile Strike Force Battalion on a search and<br />
clear operation in Kontum Province. Shortly after capturing an undefended<br />
hill, two companies of the battalion were attacked by elements of a welldisciplined<br />
and well-equipped North Vietnamese force using machine guns<br />
and small arms. As the companies broke under heavy mortar and rocket<br />
attack Warrant Officer Payne attempted to encourage his troops to hold<br />
their position. He continually exposed himself to enemy fire while firing<br />
back and throwing grenades at the North Vietnamese. He received<br />
shrapnel wounds to his hands and arms.<br />
Despite his efforts the battalion continued to withdraw in<br />
disorder and the battalion commander decided to fight back to the battalion<br />
base. Warrant Officer Payne and the remnants of his company covered<br />
their withdrawal. He managed to hold together a small number of<br />
indigenous soldiers of the two companies to form a temporary defensive<br />
perimeter in a valley some 350 metres tothe north east of the hill which<br />
the North Vietnamese had retaken.<br />
Warrant Officer Payne then requested permission to attempt<br />
to gather together the wounded and disoriented members of the battalion<br />
left on or near the enemy position. He left the reorganised group and<br />
moved out alone. In a traverse of approximately 800 metres he managed<br />
to gather together forty indigenous soldiers in about three hours. On<br />
return to the temporary defensive perimeter he found that his force had<br />
returned to the battalion base. Leading these forty soldiers he found a<br />
group of advisers who had been left behind with some seriously wounded<br />
soldiers during the battalion withdrawal. Warrant Officer Payne arranged<br />
for the evacuation of the wounded and personally lead the group back over<br />
difficult enemy held terrain to the battalion base arriving in the early hours<br />
of the morning. Mr. Gorton said his leadership and personal bravery<br />
throughout this action were outstanding.<br />
Personal Background: Warrant Officer Payne was born in Ingham, Queensland, on<br />
August 1933 and enlisted on 13 August 1951 after a short period in the<br />
