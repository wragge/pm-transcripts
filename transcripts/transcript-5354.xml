PRIME MINISTER'<br />
FOR MEDIA SUNDAY, 18 IAY, 1980,<br />
ELECTORATE TALKIt<br />
is quite clear that the Soviet Union has no intention of<br />
withdrawing its invading troops from Afghanistan. It is<br />
now almost 5 months since Soviet tanks rolled onto<br />
Afghanistan soil.<br />
It was the first time that Russia had stepped outside its<br />
iron curtain to suppress, with its own forces, a sovereign,<br />
non-aligned Third World country.<br />
Since then, the Soviet Union has steadily increased-its<br />
invading forces, and built up the infrastructure to support<br />
them. The situation for the people of Afghanistan has<br />
worsened in recent weeks.<br />
All this is in complete defiance of international law and<br />
contemptuous of the overwhelming United Nations vote which<br />
soundly condemned the Soviet invasion.<br />
We recognised at the outset, and that recognition has since<br />
been hardened, that boycotting the Moscow Games is the most<br />
effective way of bringing home to the Soviet people, and<br />
their masters, that the invasion of Afghanistan is<br />
internationally condemnod.<br />
We also recognised then, as now, the sacrifice we would<br />
be asking our athletes to make. As I told Federal Parliament<br />
in February, asking the Australian team to s ' tay away from<br />
the Moscow Games is not a step to be taken lightly or<br />
happily, least of all by a country like Australia which<br />
has a distinguished Olympic record.<br />
Australia is a great sporting nation. It is a nation which<br />
remains committed to the Olympic ideal, but it is also a nation<br />
which has a role in international affairs.<br />
We are not, and-cannot be, detached from international events<br />
in a world as tense and inter-dependent as it is now.<br />
Whether we like it or not, the decision on whether or not<br />
Australia goes to Moscow is one that goes far beyond sport.<br />
When the Government first announced its response to the<br />
Soviet invasion, we included a request to the Australian<br />
Olympic Federation that it not send a team to lioscow. In<br />
doing so, Australia was one of the first countries to support<br />
the call of its ally, the United States, for a boycott of the<br />
Moscow Games. / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
Our decision was immediate. It was necessary. It was<br />
right then, and it has been proved right since.<br />
The Australian Olympic Federation has been aware of our<br />
views on the Moscow Games from the start and we have<br />
spoken and written to the Federation on a number of<br />
occasions. I have met with its President and Secretary,<br />
while Mr. Anthony, as Acting Prime Minister, Mr. Peacock<br />
and Mr. Ellicott, spoke to its full Executive last month.<br />
Mr. Anthony also addressed the full Federation meeting<br />
before it considered its position on April 19.<br />
At that meeting, the Australian Olympic Federation took<br />
a most responsible decision which allowed it to continue<br />
to monitor the international situation. It was aware,<br />
when it voted then, that the United States Olympic Committee<br />
had decided against participation in Moscow. I am sure<br />
this fact weighed heavily in the AOF deliberations.<br />
Later this week, the Australian Olympic Executive meets<br />
again to take a decision on whether an Australian team<br />
will go to Moscow. Since its last meeting, there have been<br />
a number of significant events, which I trust the<br />
Australian Olympic Federation will again take into account.<br />
First, the West German Parliament voted by a margin of 446 votes<br />
to 8, with 9 abstentions, that their Olympic team should<br />
not go to Moscow. The West German Olympic Federation<br />
announced just two days ago that it would not go.<br />
The situation is the same in Canada, where the Olympic<br />
Association voted by/ 137 votes to 35 to reject the invitation<br />
to go to Moscow.<br />
So the United States, West Germany and Canada have decided<br />
not to go to Moscow. And when to that is added all the<br />
other countries many from our own region it is clear that<br />
an effective boycott is already in place.<br />
The Japanese Government has made a public announcement favouring<br />
a boycott. In doing so, it noted that the aim of the<br />
Olympic Games is to help build a better and more peaceful<br />
world through sport, thereby creating international goodwill.<br />
It noted that the host Government of the Olympic Games-* is<br />
requ ' ired to observe strictly the Olympic spirit, and has to<br />
bear the heavy responsibility of ensuring an atmosphere which<br />
enables the athletes of participating countries to take part<br />
in the Games with the blessing of the whole world,<br />
The armed intervention into Afghanistan by the Soviet Uni on<br />
evoked a severe condemnation by international public opinion,<br />
to the effect that the Soviet action harmed the spirit of peace<br />
and friendship. The Japanese Government could not be other<br />
than seriously concerned over those facts. </p>
<p>3<br />
In Latin America, in recent days, Argentina has become<br />
the first major nation in that region to reverse its<br />
previous decision and now supports a boycott.<br />
In our own region alone, China, Japan, South Korea,<br />
Thailand, Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, Pakistan and<br />
Bangladesh, the Philippines, Papua New Guinea and Fiji,<br />
have at Government level, and in many cases at Olympic<br />
. Committee level, decided to support a boycott.<br />
The number of teams which will attend gets smaller every day.<br />
It is in these circumstances that the Australian decision<br />
on attendance at the Moscow Olympics must be made.<br />
It is my view, it is the view of the Government, that an<br />
Australian Olympic team should not go to Moscow, that it<br />
should support the effective boycott which is now in place.<br />
I am sure that that is also the view of a great majority<br />
of concerned and responsible people right around Australia.<br />
