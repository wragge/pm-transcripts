FOR MEDIATUESDAY AUGUST 24 1982<br />
EXTENSION OF REPORTING DATE OF ROYAL COMMISSION<br />
INTO THE MEAT INDUSTRY<br />
The Commonwealth, Victorian and Northern Territory Governments<br />
have agreed to extend the reporting date of the Meat Industry<br />
Royal Commission by three weeks to 22 September 1982.<br />
The extension is in response to a request by the Honourable<br />
Mr Justice Woodward OBE for an extension for a maximum period<br />
of three weeks in which to complete his report.<br />
The Royal Commission of Inquiry into certain aspects of the<br />
Meat Industry was set up by the Commonwealth and Victorian<br />
Governments in September 1981.<br />
In November 1981, the Royal Commission was authorised to<br />
inquire into and report separately on the handling of meat<br />
for human consumption in the Northern Territory.<br />
The terms of reference for the Royal Commission remain unchanged. </p>
