SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING<br />
STATE DINNER FOR PRESIDENT KIM YOUNG SAM<br />
PARLIAMENT HOUSE CANBERRA<br />
17 NOVEMBER 1994<br />
Mr President, we meet again.<br />
On this occasion it is here, in Australia, where you and<br />
Mrs Kim are very welcome guests and friends.<br />
For me it is a real and personal pleasure to welcome you<br />
and your distinguished party to our country.<br />
Before I turn to our very healthy bilateral relationship,.<br />
I must say something about our work together on APEC.<br />
In many respects nothing nearly so important would have<br />
come from Bogor Mr President had it not been for your<br />
vision, and persistence.<br />
From its inception there have been APEC doubters and<br />
critics. Korea has never been in that company.<br />
More importantly, you Mr President, have been at the<br />
frontline of our efforts to make something substantial<br />
and significant of APEC.<br />
We have shared a view about what was needed and have<br />
joined our efforts to get the best possible outcome.<br />
Through your efforts you have stamped Korea and yourself<br />
as leaders in the Asia-Pacific.<br />
That we were able at Bogor to agree an historic<br />
declaration for free trade throughout the Asia-Pacific by<br />
2020 is evidence of this.<br />
Our agreement there is, of course, just the start of the<br />
work and effort that is needed to turn this commitment to<br />
reality.<br />
One thing you can be sure of, however, is that we would<br />
never have secured a result as significant as we did had<br />
leaders not had the will to lead. </p>
<p>As we now develop ways of taking forward and acting on<br />
the Bogor declaration I know I will work closely again<br />
with you Mr President.<br />
While APEC is a broad regional body, it also stimulates<br />
the development of bilateral relations. We saw in<br />
Indonesia dozens of meetings between Asia-Pacific leaders<br />
which preceded Bogor all ensuring better understanding<br />
and co-operation between countries in the region.<br />
Mr President, your visit to Australia, like mine to Korea<br />
last year, is a sign that we both believe now in the time<br />
to take the relationship between Australia and Korea to a<br />
new level.<br />
Our ties go back many years and are of the deepest kind.<br />
Between 1950 and 1953, 17,000 Australian men and women<br />
served in Korea to help defend its people from<br />
aggression. More than three hundred died there. I paid<br />
tribute to some of them when I visited the United Nations<br />
cemetery in Pusan during my visit to Korea last year.<br />
I am pleased to announce tonight that the Australian<br />
Government will contribute $ 200,000 towards the<br />
construction of a national monument on Anzac Parade in<br />
Canberra to mark the sacrifice of the Australians who<br />
served in Korea and to commemorate the links between our<br />
two countries.<br />
Australia has been a firm supporter of Korea's security<br />
since that time. We are also conscious that, despite<br />
recent hopeful developments, the security problems of the<br />
peninsula continue to require vigilance and the active<br />
interest of all nations in the region.<br />
While an earlier generation of Australians knew Korea as<br />
a country ravaged by war, the current generation knows a<br />
very different country a strong democracy and one of<br />
the most dynamic economies in the world.<br />
Australia has been a partner in that growth.<br />
In the late 1960s, for example, Australian engineering<br />
support and consultancy helped to build POSCO's Pohang<br />
steelworks. Australia has been proud to be associated<br />
with POSCO and with the development of other Korean<br />
industries.<br />
There is a natural complementarity between our economies<br />
which benefits us both and adds breadth and depth to the<br />
relationship. Over recent years, our economic links have grown at an<br />
astounding rate.<br />
The Republic of Korea is now our third largest export<br />
market and is likely to be our second largest in the next<br />
two years. It is our eighth largest source of imports. </p>
<p>Two way trade grew by 16 per cent in 1993-94 to more<br />
than $ 6.5 billion.<br />
Korea's growing status as a world trading nation is one<br />
of the reasons, in addition to Trade Minister Kim<br />
Chul-Su's long experience and personal qualities, that<br />
Australia is supporting him for the post of Director<br />
General of the World Trade Organisation.<br />
We are also encouraged to see Korean and Australian<br />
companies increasingly working together in a range of<br />
major projects.<br />
I attach real significance to your decision to bring with<br />
you a distinguished group of senior Korean<br />
businesspeople. I have no doubt they will find new<br />
opportunities here for trade and investment, and that<br />
their Australian colleagues will find new opportunities<br />
in Korea.<br />
Investment both ways has lagged behind our trading<br />
relationship and is one area which we should work to<br />
strengthen over the coming years.<br />
Scientific research, industrial technology and energy cooperation<br />
are other fields in which we can do more<br />
together.<br />
Each of us has the sense, I think, Mr President, that<br />
this vital and growing economic relationship needs still<br />
to be matched by greater bonds between our people. We do<br />
not yet know enough about each other although we are both<br />
working hard on this aspect of our relationship.<br />
For Australia's part, we have nominated Korean as one of<br />
the principal Asian languages to be taught in Australian<br />
schools under our national languages strategy.<br />
Nine Australian universities now offer a degree program<br />
in Korean, compared with only one in 1988.<br />
Education and closer human contact, through tourism for<br />
example, will help to reinforce the economic<br />
relationship. But it will do more: it will enrich the<br />
lives and deepen the cultural understanding of those who<br />
take part.<br />
So the President and I have much to talk about tomorrow.<br />
I began by saying that it was a great personal pleasure<br />
to welcome you to Australia, Mr President.<br />
One reason for that is because of my admiration, and the<br />
admiration of Australians, for your deep commitment to<br />
democracy, expressed at times at considerable personal<br />
risk. Throughout your career you have stood unwaveringly and<br />
courageously for civil and political freedom, for </p>
<p>I r4 democratic parliamentary institutions and for the<br />
observance of human rights. Your political life has left<br />
a lasting legacy to your country, and a lasting example<br />
to the world.<br />
For this reason, it is particularly appropriate for me to<br />
welcome you here in our country's Parliament House on<br />
behalf of the Government and people of Australia and to<br />
invite you to speak to us.<br />
I now call on the leader of the National Party,<br />
Mr Fischer, to join me in welcoming you.<br />
ends </p>
