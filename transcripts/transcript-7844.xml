FOR MEDIA 5 DECEMBER 1989<br />
The Commonwealth Government has decided to take further<br />
action to reduce the national road toll and improve the<br />
efficiency of safety regulation of road transport, by<br />
inviting the States to adopt the following uniform<br />
measures on a co-ordinated basis:<br />
national .05 level alcohol limit<br />
national licensing of heavy truck and bus<br />
drivers national uniform speed limits<br />
speed limiters for heavy vehicles.<br />
adopt zero alcohol limits for young drivers<br />
increase enforcement to ensure that 1 in 4<br />
drivers are random breath-tested for alcohol in<br />
a year<br />
implement a graduated licensing system for<br />
young drivers<br />
introduce compulsory bicycle helmet wearing<br />
introduce daylight running lights for<br />
motorcyclists increase enforcement of seat belt and child<br />
restraint wearing.<br />
I trust all States will perceive the benefit to<br />
Australians travelling on our roads from this package.<br />
It's time we stopped pretending that each State has got<br />
the finest road laws imaginable and started catering<br />
effectively for the massive level of inter-State road<br />
transport. Motorists and the trucking industry both<br />
desperately need uniform laws.<br />
I anticipate that Bob Brown will be holding a meeting of<br />
State Ministers before Christmas to initiate this<br />
program. S. </p>
<p>I will be writing to State Premiers this week with the<br />
broad outline of the package.<br />
As evidence of the Commonwealth's genuine desire to<br />
obtain these national benefits for all Australians, we<br />
will also offer to those States and Territories which<br />
give a commitment to implementing this package by 1 July<br />
1990, additional road funding for the purpose of<br />
eliminating known ' black spots' intersections,<br />
bridgeworks or other traffic points noted for involvement<br />
in accidents.<br />
For this purpose, the Commonwealth will make available up<br />
to S110m over the next three financial years for this<br />
purpose. A separate and additional $ 10m will support extra<br />
research into vehicle design and other strategic issues,<br />
Sand public education programs aimed at changing attitudes<br />
and behaviour relating to issues such as drink driving,<br />
speed and aggression.<br />
In particular, there will be continued financial support<br />
for injury prevention programs, such as the Australian<br />
Injury Prevention Program and its associated national<br />
injury surveillance system. $ 250,000 a year will be<br />
provided to improve the collection of injury data.<br />
These actions are in addition to those outlined by<br />
Bob Brown on 26 October.<br />
I pay tribute in the development of this proposal to<br />
Sir Dennis Paterson, President of the International<br />
Society of Orthopaedics and Traumatology. whom I met<br />
earlier this year. As a result of his advocacy of the<br />
need for the Commonwealth to take the lead in this area,<br />
I asked Bob Brown and Neal Blewett to put together this<br />
package. I trust that the States will recognise its value and cooperate<br />
with it. </p>
