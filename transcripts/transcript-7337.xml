Ladies and gentlemen<br />
We are now half-day through our Bicentennial year, and have<br />
witnessed a spectacular series of celebrations, the likes of<br />
which will not be seen again in this country for a very long<br />
time. Some of these events have been the result of years of<br />
careful planning, have a high public profile, attract<br />
significant international participation and generate world<br />
wide attention. Others have been organised at a community<br />
level, built simply on the enthusiasm and commitment to<br />
Australia of its citizens.<br />
world Expo e88 stands out amongst other Bicentennial events<br />
because it exhibits all of these characteristics.<br />
Expo 88 has brought together 36 nations, 2 international<br />
organisations, 150 corporations, as well as all the<br />
Australian States and mainland Territories, to share with us<br />
their lifestyles, their cultures and their technological<br />
achievements. The tremendous public response since the<br />
gates opened shows Expo has clearly struck a chord in the<br />
community. The results of the dedication and energy of Llew Edwards,<br />
Ned Williams, and their staffs are here for all to see.<br />
I was delighted to see Llew's tireless efforts for Expo were<br />
recognised recently with his nomination as Queenslander of<br />
the Year.<br />
Today I pay special tribute to Tom Veivers, the<br />
Commissioner-General of Australia's Pavilion, and all those<br />
who have helped to bring the concept of the Australian<br />
Pavilion to reality. 7223 </p>
<p>The Australian Pavilion celebrates what being an Australian<br />
means, through a kaleidoscope of images of Australian life<br />
and the land drawn from the present day and the past.<br />
Through the Bicentennial celebrations, the Australian<br />
community is increasingly coming to recognise that for more<br />
than 40,000 years before 1788 there existed in this land a<br />
human civilisation of remarkable sophistication and<br />
adaptability. So I am particularly impressed by the Rainbow Serpent<br />
theatre in the Pavilion, which is a stunning interpretation<br />
of the Aboriginal cultural heritage.<br />
It was a tremendous privilege to see at first hand at the<br />
Barunga Festival in the Northern Territory last weekend the<br />
strength and resilience of Aboriginal culture.<br />
World Expo 88 has attracted many visitors from around the<br />
world. As Prime Minister I extend a very warm welcome to<br />
all who are visiting Australia to share this great<br />
celebration of human achievement. Please feel at home<br />
during your stay with us.<br />
We expect two million international visitors to come to<br />
Australia during 1988 twice the number of overseas<br />
tourists who visited Australia in 1983.<br />
The tourism industry's ability to generate employment and<br />
foreign exchange earnings make it an important contributor<br />
to the Australian economy, and one which will play a<br />
significant role in our future prosperity.<br />
Tourism is also significant in a less tangible sense.<br />
While Expo 88 is bringing the world to Australia, it is also<br />
giving Australians the opportunity of showing the world the<br />
qualities of our country and our national character.<br />
On its national day at Expo, Australia is proudly showing<br />
the world what we are capable of: not just our culture, our<br />
lifestyle, our landscape, our sport and leisure activities<br />
but our industry, our political freedoms, our new<br />
technology, our plans for the future.<br />
It is an inestimable pleasure and privilege to be Prime<br />
Minister during our Bicentennial year to know that we are<br />
showing all this to the world not just on a special day like<br />
today, our national day at Expo, but every day of the year.<br />
Millions of overseas tourists, and millions of Australians,<br />
are seeing an enduringly important transition underway in<br />
this country the emergence of a new, competitive, vigorous<br />
economy capable of securing sustainable prosperity for all<br />
its citizens as we enter our third century. 7224 </p>
<p>That is the best message of Australia's National Day and it<br />
is one which I have great pride in passing on to you and in<br />
urging you in turn to pass on to your work colleagues, your<br />
friends and your family when you return home. 7225 </p>
