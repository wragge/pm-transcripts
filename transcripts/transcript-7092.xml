PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF PRESS CONFERENCE, CONGRESS HOUSE, DAVOS,<br />
SWITZERLAND<br />
-3-O-JANUARY--9477--P ROOF-O-LY--<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, what. reactions -have-you . had<br />
so far to yesterday's speech?<br />
PM: It' s been very positive. People have been very<br />
gracious in their comments, but as in all these things<br />
the judgement is to * be made later on. . I meant what<br />
I said at the beginning of the speech that one doesn ' t<br />
feel like coming half way round the world, or right<br />
round the world, if you think you are talking to people<br />
who are just going to say " well, yes that's nice,<br />
yes that's rational, yes that makes-sense", then they're<br />
not going to do something about it, and I have the.<br />
feeling that what we've been able to do is to state<br />
the issue fairly starkly,-point out the very<br />
considerable limits of the danger involved that it's<br />
not just economic but political. And I would hope<br />
from the reactions I've got that people are going<br />
to go away and talk about the-proposals. I just make<br />
this point, which is relevant to a W. hole consideration<br />
of our prsnehere ' Australia ' does not take, the<br />
view that what we have said. represents the last word<br />
that we know exactly what the paths are through to<br />
solving these very considerable problems. But what<br />
we hope we've done is to state the problem pretty<br />
accurately and to make some, as we put it, practicable<br />
suggestions that may very well be that the merit of<br />
what we've done is to set other minds going about<br />
other ways of getting there. If we've done-that,<br />
we will have judged ourselves to be successful.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( Financial Times)<br />
JOURNALIST: He was referring to last night's agreement<br />
between the EC and the US or. that it was. really where<br />
the future lay world was rapidly-moving towards<br />
managed trade<br />
PM: Well, it's too early, it seems to me ' to make<br />
a judgement as to what's going to emerge through the<br />
various avenues available to the U. S. and the Community.<br />
All we know is that from the discussions we've had<br />
myself to some extent but-my Ministers and officials<br />
more particularly, is that at that level of relevant<br />
officialdom, there is an acceptance of, firstly, the<br />
non-viability of the continuation of the existing<br />
practices in the two countries, and in Japan for that </p>
<p>2<br />
matter, the need for change. And thirdly, the<br />
recognition that there is a political hurdle that<br />
has to be overcome. Now, all I can say is that there<br />
is agreement with us on these things, and that your<br />
question, in the end, gets down to making a judgement<br />
me making it, you making a judgement as to what<br />
is the level of political will. Quite clearly, I<br />
can't, with any confidence, say to you that I know<br />
that there will be sufficient political will to get<br />
to the more ideal solution that I've been talking<br />
-a-bout. But---I---ca-n-l--y-hope-t-ha-t-by-a-r-ag-o-I rn-te-res-t-sbeyond<br />
governments that the rational solution, can<br />
get a greater degree of exposure. In the end, the<br />
greatest hope is this that the in ' ternal political<br />
arithmetic of it. By-that I mean-that, whether itbe<br />
in the United -States or within -Europe, the political<br />
arithmetic is entirely opposed to the economic<br />
insanities that are being pursued. In other words,<br />
the majorities in each country are being prejudiced,<br />
and very sorely prejudiced, by policies calculated<br />
to help a minority and in the end, won't be able to<br />
help the minority, so what you're really hoping to<br />
be able to do is to crystallise in the minds of the<br />
decision-makers, the nature of the political arithmetic.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, how much f urther can you take<br />
the line of warning to a country like the United States<br />
that allies like Australia may ' we1 ' d evelop a-totally<br />
negative viewpoint about the alliance?<br />
PM: First you have got to be sure what is the message<br />
that can properly be conveyed,-and once you know what<br />
that message is, then your question becomes relevant<br />
" how far do you take it? just gjoing to the first<br />
part of that analysis. I wasn't trying to convey<br />
last night, nor is it the position, that the point<br />
has been reached in Australia that because of the<br />
action of the United States, Australia has reached<br />
a point of putting into question the elements of the<br />
alliance relationship, because I don't believe that<br />
that is the position. The message that I am trying<br />
to convey to the United States is that we all ought,<br />
sensibly, to take account of the warning signs. For<br />
the sake of some of our friends here from other<br />
countries I'll just mention to them what you know.<br />
We had the remarkable situation last year in our country<br />
of farmers getting in touch with my office, the Prime<br />
Minister's office, and offering -to organise a march<br />
of some thousands of farmers to the-United States<br />
base' in Alice Springs, one of our joint facilities<br />
here, to demonstrate against the existence of the<br />
joint facility. This is, U. S. within our society one<br />
of the most conservative groups, one traditionally<br />
most closely identified with the maintenance of the<br />
U. S./ Australian alliance relationship. But I go to<br />
that to give you an idea of the intensity of the impact </p>
<p>-3<br />
the decisions by the United States Administration<br />
as seen through the eyes of our farmers, one of our<br />
more conservative groups. What I'm trying to say<br />
is, we want to convey the signs to our friends in<br />
the United States of the impact on internal Australian<br />
attitudes to alliance relationships that flow from<br />
their decisions in this area. As I said in the speech<br />
last night, if you attempt to make some judgement<br />
from that experience in Australia, one has got to<br />
imagine that within the countries of Europe, the<br />
attitudes of ordinary people there. Within the United<br />
and-withi: n-Japarvrwh-en-they-see-wh-at-' s-happening<br />
in trade relationships -between their countries,-and<br />
the tensions that are -developing there, you've got<br />
-to ask yourself-the -question-whether there isn't.-a<br />
process of some gradual dissolution of the ties that<br />
are essential to the -broader -political relationships.<br />
I'm really trying to say, and this is what in my<br />
Australian colleague's question, that it is very<br />
short-sighted if we think about this developing trade<br />
war, trade conflict, and just put it in the trade<br />
and economic box and say " that's the beginning and<br />
end of the problem". We really believe and we have<br />
the evidence that behind my friend's question here,<br />
that it does go to these more fundamental questions.<br />
We are continuing to say-to the. United States " look,<br />
this will impose greater and greater strains upon<br />
this area of the relationship". _ But Iam -not-saying,<br />
at this stage, that we are using that as some part<br />
of the bargaining process because, as you know, we<br />
believe those facilities have-an intrinsic merit and<br />
it would be antagonistic to our perceptions about<br />
security interests to put theft as an issue But you<br />
governmentgo on and on like this,-, and if your own<br />
community builds up an antagonism" ' then that's got<br />
to inform the thinking of government.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, the Financial Times reported<br />
yesterday that France was refusing to allow the EC<br />
to put agriculture on the MTN round. Are you aware<br />
of that and is what is your response?<br />
PM: I wasn't aware of it, but let me say two things.<br />
Firstly that in the processes leading up to the<br />
decisions at Punta del Este, which processes included<br />
discussions between Australia and the Group'~ of 14<br />
with the Community, and with the French. There was<br />
agreement at Punta del Este, that the first time<br />
agriculture was seriously would-. be put on the agenda,<br />
and we would regard it as a breach of the understandings<br />
that were reached at that stage, if there was now<br />
an attempt to take agriculture off the agenda.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, have you gaged any feeling<br />
or reaction at all investment in Australia.<br />
trying to round-up investment here? </p>
<p>-4<br />
PM: I wouldn't use the phrase " round-up" But we<br />
certainly in the session I'll be having this morning,<br />
will be wanting to convey what is the reality, and<br />
that is that Australia is a very attractive place<br />
for investment, that the fundamentals are there. And<br />
let -me take this opportunity of saying what those<br />
fundamentals are. Firstly, probably the most<br />
politically stable country in the world, at -least<br />
I don' t think there are any that are more politically<br />
stable, a country of vast resources, of a well-trained<br />
popu~ ation. part-o the fastest_ _ growing economic region____<br />
in the world Asia-Pacific and with good rZe[ 1tions--<br />
in that region, and therefore strategically well-placed<br />
as a base for export into -the region. We only<br />
have a population' of 16 million, ' so we can't put<br />
-Australia up in itself an enormous market. But when<br />
you take those other factors into account relevant,<br />
recent developments with the 35% trade-weighted<br />
depreciation of the dollar, we are now in a very,<br />
very much more competitive position and very<br />
importantly, the attitude of our trade union movement<br />
is extremely cooperative towards further, investment,<br />
prepared under its central leadership to talk in advance<br />
with those who are seeking to establish new ventures<br />
so that there can be, in advance, understanding as<br />
to an industrial relations framework. All these things<br />
make Australia very attractive. And what I'll be<br />
trying to -do in-my brief time here -is to project thosefacts<br />
into the minds of people who are considering<br />
investment decisions and to do that with the overall<br />
knowledge that the Government of Australia welcomes<br />
such investment.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, speaking ab~ jut. the willingness<br />
of the Trade Union movement to talk in advance at<br />
what level and within what sort of framework and<br />
what specifics do you think might come out of that?<br />
PM: I want people to understand that this is not<br />
just an Australian Prime minister saying things that<br />
might sound nice. It comes from specific discussions<br />
I've had with the leadership of the ACTU. . And they<br />
have given me an undertaking that should any foreign<br />
investment proposal be in contemplati. on, that they<br />
at the ACTU central trade union level, are prepared,<br />
and not just prepared, but would want to talk with<br />
those interested in such proposals, that they would<br />
undertake to have the relevant unions who would be<br />
likely to be involved, bring them together and in<br />
advance talk with those who are considering the<br />
proposal, so that they could work out, in advance,<br />
an understanding and a framework of the industrial<br />
relations agreement which would operate so that those<br />
contemplating the investment could have the certain<br />
knowledge about the continuity of operations. And </p>
<p>therefore have much more, or the greatest degree of<br />
confidence about the viability of the operation. So<br />
it's not just a concept that I'm putting, but a specific<br />
undertaking. JOURNALIST: Is that the sort of thing that could lead<br />
you to a direct contract system i. n the Union movement.<br />
PM: It would be an agreement the concept of an<br />
agreement within the overall system that we have<br />
in Australia. In other words, you would still have<br />
_-the--basia rate~ s~ lai. down out of the National Wage<br />
Case decisions and so on, but within the pi_: ni-pPT<br />
of the National Wage decisions, there is absolute<br />
room for the negotiation of conditions and arrangements<br />
* for dispute-settling, which -is -an absolutely critical<br />
point, I think, in the confidence of potential'<br />
investors. What they don't want, and quite<br />
understandably, is I'm going to make the investment,<br />
but we're not sure as to the continuity of operations.<br />
Where I think the most significant part of the<br />
discussions can be is to get an actual dispute-settling<br />
procedure laid down so that in the event of some point<br />
of disagreement arising, there is not just a resort<br />
to direct action, but you'd have lines of communication<br />
and di spute-settlement laid down so that the concept<br />
of direct action is not the thing that's invoked at<br />
an immediate or early stage-and in hopefully, not<br />
a part of the relationship at all. It's those sorts<br />
of things which I think can most sensibly be talked<br />
about and, as I say, the ACTU stands ready to operate<br />
in that way. Now if I can pick up your question,<br />
Mike. I've had the discussions with Simon Crean and<br />
Bill Kelty over a period of some weeks now. I've<br />
been in a couple of ad hoc discussidis'and also, within<br />
the framework of the Australian Labour Advisory Council,<br />
we have talked about it has been the outcome of<br />
a number of discussions.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you expect it to be a formalised<br />
arrangement? PM: Let's say a company wants to come and establish<br />
a new high-tech enterprise. They've got the proposal<br />
in their minds. The normal thing when an enterprise<br />
is contemplating that they talk with Government, they<br />
talk with their bankers or their source of ' finance.<br />
They will in advance have clear in their mind their<br />
finance, what's required to meet Government regulations.<br />
What I've been saying, and what the ACTU agree with,<br />
is it makes sense that in advance, not to wait till<br />
later, but in advance, to get a clear idea of what<br />
the industrial relations framework is going to be<br />
within which you're operating. And to try and negotiate<br />
in advance the circumstances that will apply, including<br />
as I've just said here, sensibly, a sort of </p>
<p>-6<br />
dispute-settlement procedure so that you're not going<br />
to have some idea in mind of saying " well, I wonder<br />
how the dispute arises" so that you know in advance<br />
that you've got undertakings about how these things<br />
will be done.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, you mentioned this sort of<br />
proposal a couple of years ago in China. Have there<br />
been any advances where<br />
PM: I am aware of-circumstances where-proposed<br />
-operat-ion-s-h--ve-bee. n--disr-ussed-inadance with the<br />
ACTU. I'm not, I don't bring to mind something that<br />
arises as a result of just what I've said in regard<br />
to China, but there are examples of this sort of thing<br />
happening, and what I'm really ' wanting to-do now,<br />
is particularly in an environment -like. -this, is to<br />
say to let potential investors know, Michelle, that<br />
the ACTU is in favour, supports the concept that I<br />
have and is prepared to cooperate, to talk in advance<br />
in regard to those with investment proposals. And<br />
there is no question at all about their preparedness<br />
to do that.<br />
JOURNALIST: system goes just about as far as<br />
it can to guarantee that there won't-be strikes?<br />
PM: As f ar as you can. What investors know about<br />
Australia is that it'Is a free, liberal democracy -within<br />
which the right to withdraw labour is an intrinsic<br />
part of our democracy, as it is in Europe, as it is<br />
in the United States. But part of what I'll be saying<br />
is to tell them about our achievements. In the period<br />
since we've been in office we've more than halved,<br />
significantly more than halved, the" Ae~ vel of industrial<br />
disputation. And there's very few of the OECD countries<br />
which has had a rate of reduction of industrial<br />
disputation that anywhere near matches what we've<br />
done, and that hasn't been an accident. It's been<br />
part of the processes of consultation between Government<br />
and unions, and industry within our country. And<br />
what I'm saying is that what we've been able to achieve<br />
is based upon a principle of negotiation and<br />
consultation and I'm saying today is we're contemplating<br />
coming to get the advantage of that in advance, so<br />
that in making your decisions you've got it there<br />
in place. And if the negotiations are undertaken<br />
in good faith, yes, you do virtually guarantee such<br />
an outcome.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, if the future of world trade<br />
is not as you adambralia last night but rather a drift<br />
towards big cartels. Where does that leave our country?<br />
PM: It's not a happy prospect for our country but<br />
I suppose that in one sense, as disconcerting as that </p>
<p>-7<br />
might be, I think it's much more disconcerting if<br />
you want to take an overall view for the really poor<br />
and developing countries of this world. You may recall<br />
one part of my speech last night, although I know<br />
every part's still vibrantly in your mind, that one<br />
part where I said that I regarded as one of the more<br />
grotesque features of the world economic scene is<br />
this way in which the majors either directly or through<br />
the institutions like the IMF and the World Bank,<br />
they preach to the developing nations and the debot<br />
nations say " look, there are rational, tough, hard<br />
economic decisions that you'Ive got . to make and it'Is<br />
only--irr -t-ht-way--t-ha-t--you-wiL priosper". A lot of<br />
the messages that they preach are valid. Buit at the<br />
same time as they preach the need for. rationality<br />
and to release the forces of -competition and<br />
deregulation within these countries to whom they -are<br />
preaching, at the same time they -es-chew, they repudiate,<br />
exactly the same principles in regard to themselvesand<br />
their relations with others, which is bad enough<br />
but particularly bad when you recognise that the very<br />
fact of their refusal, themselves to embrace the same<br />
sort of rationality, imposes almost an impossible<br />
condition upon the people to whom they are preaching<br />
to meet their commitments. And it just strikes me<br />
that that's not just a paradox, but an absurdity which<br />
we've got to understand, and it's so relevant to-your_.<br />
question. Sure, if you get that sort of cartelisation<br />
which may suit the interests of-some of the majors,<br />
it's going to make virtually impossible the meeting<br />
of the commitments of these smaller debtor nations.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, one of the difficulties Australia<br />
may have in attracting foreign investors is that they<br />
high inflation CPI do you think that<br />
Government should look again at re-&amp; adjusting economic<br />
policy to try an get inflation down to<br />
PM: Two or three things to say to that. The f irst<br />
is what are the prospects for inflation, what. are<br />
the reasons for the inflation rate that's emerged.<br />
Now, just a very brief historical analysis. When<br />
we came into of fice inf lation was over as you<br />
know. As the result of the policies that we pursued<br />
and particularly the policy of the Accord, we more<br />
than halved that inflation rate. we've got, it down<br />
to 5% an annual rate of 5% within two years. And<br />
the point I make therefore is that the actual<br />
application of our economic policies that were<br />
autonomously within our own control., had got our<br />
inflation rate back very much towards what was happening<br />
in our OECD and partner countries. Then we got hit<br />
by the turn in the terms of trade in the very<br />
significant depreciation which unleashed forces that<br />
took that inflation rate up again, and which saw, </p>
<p>8-<br />
as a result, this last December quarter f igure coming<br />
in for that twelve months at a bit under 10%. So<br />
the point I'm making, Greg, in regard to those who<br />
are looking at the Australian situation and movements<br />
is as to making a judgement as to whether they come<br />
or not, can see that the sort of policies pursued<br />
by the Government have been successful in bringing<br />
inf lation down. And if you look at 1987, that we've<br />
now, we believe, had the final washing-through of<br />
the depreciation, and that we will be looking in 1987<br />
at a declining inflation rate. -Secondly, the point<br />
to be made is that within those processes that<br />
importantly for their consideration, it also produced<br />
an enormous improvement in our competitive situation.<br />
That 35% depreciation in TWI terms,. which is what<br />
has taken place in the early months of 1985, has made<br />
Australian industry much more competitive than it's<br />
been in memory. So I would suggest that a proper<br />
analysis of those factors, taking into account what<br />
you say, that there's been that upward movement in<br />
inflation, should lead to the total conclusion that<br />
now is the time to come into Australia because our<br />
inflation rates will be coming back through ' 87<br />
the gap between us will be narrowed. But the very<br />
processes which have produced -that temporary spurt<br />
in inflation themselves have also improved our<br />
competitive position.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you think that fiscal, monetary-and<br />
wages policy should be looked at again some sort<br />
of May or June statement?<br />
PM: Greg, as you know, we take the view that you've<br />
always got to be reviewing all.-, the elements of<br />
macro-economic policy. We don't attach any magic<br />
to a particular rate and certainly we've demonstrated<br />
that we are not bound to some almost mystical religious<br />
significance for budget day and that's the one day<br />
of the year you assemble all your tools of<br />
macro-economic policy and get them right on that day.<br />
we've continually adjusted our policies. What has<br />
characterised the more recent period is that we've<br />
tried to ensure that by making the decisions in the<br />
fiscal area and getting our wages policies right,<br />
that we can be moving to a position where we can take<br />
some of the weight off of monetary policy w~ fich had<br />
to bear a fairly heavy part of the burden during 1986,<br />
and we think that we've ' done that. I repeat that<br />
it's our view that as we go through 1987, because<br />
we've got fiscal policy right, budgetary policy, and<br />
because we, I believe, will get a wages policy which<br />
will produce an acceptable outcome in* 1987 that there<br />
will be able to be an easing in monetary -policy during<br />
87, with that being reflected in a lowering interest<br />
rate regimen. The whole purpose of the hard work </p>
<p>9-<br />
that' s going into wages policy is to ensure, as you<br />
know, that we make the depreciation that's taken place,<br />
and the improvement in our competitive position, that<br />
we maintain that by not dissipating it through a<br />
significantly high movement in wages. So, it's a<br />
constant inter-relationship between these elements.<br />
But -what it will mean in my : judgement, through ' 87,.<br />
is that, having taken the hard decisions that we did<br />
in ' 86, that we will have this sort of framework in<br />
1987 a lowering rate of inflation; a declining<br />
interest rate regimen'through ' 87; and a wages outcome<br />
will be in line with what we said in the -last,<br />
-bu-g--t-woulfdbe-requ1 re-d-a-d-a--reai-wages--outcome<br />
which is better than most of our trading partners-'.<br />
JOURNALIST: ZMr-Hawkewhat would-. you-regard as. acceptable<br />
rate of inflation by the end of this year?-<br />
PM: That's an invitation to suicide, almost. In<br />
an election year " Hawke said in Davos inflation will<br />
be it's not x% Advertisements for the Liberal<br />
Party. So I'm not going to satisfy them. But I will<br />
say this, seriously, Kerry, that there will be a<br />
declining rate of inflation. The rate of inflation<br />
at the end of ' 87 will be lower than 86.<br />
Journalist: Have you had . discussions -with the ACTUabout<br />
applying the industrial relations new<br />
~ investment in Australia...<br />
PM: Sure I mean I've consistently said, not just<br />
in recent months, but all the way along my message<br />
has been to business. I can remember speeches in<br />
which I've said look you're tdlking about an investment<br />
in this country you'll have your finance manager and<br />
you'll -spend weeks and months working out how you<br />
are going to raise the finance, how you are going<br />
to service the debts. You'll have your engineers,<br />
you'l11 have every facet of your corporate structure<br />
in. And in advance you work out all those things<br />
but how often have you had your Industrial Relations'<br />
Manager or whoever responsible in advance and working<br />
. out that part of environment. Yet look at the stupidity<br />
of it, you can spend months and months working out<br />
how you are actually going to acquire the money for<br />
a 50 million investment, how you're going to service<br />
it, how you're going to build it and yet the whole<br />
of it can be rendered useless or the value of it reduced<br />
very considerably because once you ' ye done all that,<br />
got the thing going you haven't worked-out in advance<br />
a sensible dispute settlement procedure with the unions.<br />
I said it just is plain dumb and it is. It's plain<br />
stupid to spend all that time with your finance<br />
managers, your engineers what to build an pnterprise<br />
if you haven't in advance done as much as you can<br />
to ensure that that's going to be continuously operating. </p>
<p>10<br />
and it just makes sense in advance to sit down and<br />
talk and get a dispute settlement procedure. This<br />
is how we are going to handle things. I've said that<br />
for years. This is not something that I'm just simply<br />
saying makes sense for people from overseas who are<br />
coming in.<br />
JOURNALIST:.. election<br />
PM: A year is twelve months isn't it? I've got<br />
nothing to add to what I've said before other than<br />
t-e--cl-rif-y--it for-you.-This Go-v m-en--will run its<br />
full term and that means it could. be an election any<br />
time up till April 88. But we'll all be going our<br />
full term and that means an election -either -the endof<br />
' 87 or sometime early I've said that several.<br />
times and I'm not changing it.<br />
JOURNALIST: farmers are aout 2% of the population<br />
( inaudible question)<br />
PM: Let me take the first part of your question.<br />
This time I don't like the analogy of being taking<br />
hostages it conjures up very unpleasant connotations.<br />
But essentially you're right it goes back to answer<br />
I gave earlier about the -political arithmetic. The<br />
political arithmethic just can't be lined up against<br />
the economic decision. It is the case that the large<br />
number, the majority-, -are -being--disadvantaged -beca-use*<br />
of perception of what needs to be done for a very<br />
small minority. That in itself is bad enough if you<br />
like but then as I was trying to say in my speech<br />
last night it doesn't work anyway because in the end<br />
you're not going to be able to protect, in income<br />
maintenance terms, those who most necd. help. A feature<br />
of the system here in Europe is that the minority<br />
of the farmers, the bigger the wealthier farmers,<br />
get the overwhelming proportion of the assistance.<br />
What we're saying is it perfectly proper for governments<br />
to have a concern for the welf are of those most in<br />
need the poor f armers. But it is a lunacy to try<br />
and pretend that you're helping them by an economic<br />
system, which at one and the same time does these<br />
two things directs the great proportion of that<br />
assistance to those withing the farming community<br />
which least need it, but secondly to do it in a way<br />
which imposes a' significantly higher cost and price<br />
structure on the whole community so that here in<br />
Europe the economic growth rates of Europe are lower<br />
than they otherwise would have * been because of this<br />
artificially imposed higher cost and price structure.<br />
That means not only are the growth rates lower but<br />
associated with that the level of unemployment is<br />
higher. And all of that in the name of trying to<br />
protect a very small minority which leads to the<br />
obscenity of people with lower than average incomes </p>
<p>.4 0 amongst the taxpaying group generally paying from<br />
their taxes to look after some farmers with higher<br />
incomes anyway. The whole thing, if you look at it,<br />
is just riddled with economic absurdities. Now your<br />
question is right when it implies that people in<br />
government, your bureacrats,* all of them know the<br />
truth of that. No-one argues that because it's<br />
unarguable. But the political realities are we've<br />
all got to worry about the vote. What needs to be<br />
done is really to mobilise the political arithmetic<br />
of it, to make the ninety percent plus who are paying<br />
-thve-price-under-stand--the--dimens -oin f -t -he-pr ice that's<br />
being paid but not in the process to ignore Ehd-plight<br />
of the poor f armer. The poor farmer is entitled to<br />
have his interest taken into account but it's<br />
infinitely more intelligent to adopt other economic<br />
measures assistance measures which can be targetted<br />
onto the person in need because if you do that, you<br />
will do two things. You will make sure the person<br />
who needs the assistance is getting it and you will<br />
do it at a lower price and in a way which is not<br />
lowering the economic growth of the community as a<br />
whole and increasing the unemployment of the community<br />
as a whole and it's just eminently senseless.<br />
JOURNALIST: clarify -the earlier point have<br />
you received an undertaking form the ACTU..<br />
PM: Yes. Mike it's not something that you should<br />
be very surprised about. It the sort of thing that<br />
has been talked about. It shouldn't ' come as any<br />
surprise to any Australian entrepeuner that if he<br />
were to go to Crean Kelty and ask them to talk about<br />
this and to * get the union involved that Crean and<br />
Kelty and the unions would talk. .; Lt's not a surprise<br />
and they will do it.<br />
JOURNALIST:.. ( inadible question)<br />
PM: I am Michelle because as you'd appreciate, we've<br />
been in Government for four years now and the evidence<br />
is getting through about the changes that have occurred<br />
under this Government the more than halving of<br />
industrial disputation. But I suppose in the literature<br />
and the assumptions there's still something lingering<br />
there about Australian industrial relations. I really<br />
want to tell people here; what we've" achieved<br />
but that hasn't been achieved by accident. It's<br />
happened because we follow a certain. principle and<br />
that that principle is available to them not after<br />
they get there but it is sensible. to take account<br />
of that in advance and to talk and work out to their<br />
* satisfaciton the sought of framework which would be<br />
appropriate for the establishment of their enterprise.<br />
