    <content><![CDATA[<p>  The Australian Parliament will tomorrow host a reception for those associated with the rescue of Brant Webb and Todd Russell from the Beaconsfield gold mine.</p>
<p>The bipartisan reception, to be held in the Great Hall of Parliament House, will provide an opportunity for the Beaconsfield community to celebrate the remarkable rescue operation.</p>
<p> The rescue of Todd and Brant stands as an extraordinary example of Australian mateship and triumph against the steepest of odds.</p>
<p>Tomorrow's event will acknowledge all those directly involved in the rescue and the many groups that supported the operation.</p>
<p>Family members of Larry Knight, who died during the rock fall on Anzac Day, have been invited to attend.</p>
<p>The reception will also include the mine rescue teams, mine management, union representatives, police, fire brigade, ambulance and emergency services, representatives of other companies and organisations who provided personnel and equipment for the operation, local, church and community representatives and medical staff.</p>
<p>   Many of those attending the reception will be flown to Canberra from Launceston. I would like to acknowledge the generosity of Qantas, Virgin Blue and Jetstar who are providing aircraft to help bring many members of the Beaconsfield community to the reception.  </p>
