SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
COMMONWEALTH/ STATE MINISTERS' CONFERENCE<br />
ON THE STATUS OF WOMEN<br />
CANBERRA 14 FEBRUARY 1991<br />
This inaugural meeting of the Comonwealth/ State Ministers'<br />
Conference on the Status of Women marks the beginning of an<br />
important new phase in improving the status of women in<br />
Australia. By opening the channels for formal Ministerial consultation<br />
on status of women issues, this forum will help us towards<br />
our shared goal of raising the status of Australian women<br />
quickly and efficiently.<br />
I announced the establishment of this Forum in March last<br />
year, to allow better sharing of information among<br />
governments ard better co-ordination of policies.<br />
Australian women have come a long way since 1902, when they<br />
won the right to vote in Federal elections.<br />
But the past 20 years have seen particularly dramatic steps<br />
forward.<br />
Women's participation in the workforce has increased from<br />
per cent in 19,72 to 52 per cent in 1990.<br />
The retention rate of girls to Year 12 has risen from 36 per<br />
cent in 1972 to 70 per cent in 1990.<br />
In comparison to other OECD countries, Australia has the<br />
lowest wage differential that is, the difference between<br />
female and male earnings.<br />
And inextricably linked to these improvements has been the<br />
rapid growth in the provision of child care affordable<br />
child care to enable women to wock, trai. n or study and<br />
improve their financial. independence.<br />
Since 1983 the supply of Commonwealth funded child care<br />
places has nore than doubled by 77,500 places to 123,500. I f; 2 </p>
<p>Last March I announced plans t~ o iuncrease the provision of<br />
child care by extending fee relief to commercial and<br />
employer centres to stimulate an increase of about 28,000<br />
new places in these sectors. 1 also announced the planned<br />
estiablishment of 50,000 new community places over the next<br />
fivia years. These developments mean that by 1996, there<br />
shouild be over 250, U000 chil. d care places in Australia.<br />
I am confident that there will be continuing close<br />
collaboration between our governments to implement th~ s<br />
expa~ nsion because all governments have recognised the trend<br />
of growing workforce participation by women and have<br />
cooperated to increase the supply of child care where it is<br />
needed most.<br />
The National Agenda for Women is a prime mechanism for<br />
ensuring that the great surge forward in social and economic<br />
reform for women maintains its momentum.<br />
Australia leads the world with thle National Agenda. We were<br />
the first Government to have developed a comprehensive<br />
policy document based onl the Uni ted Nation'sa Forward L~ ooking<br />
Strategies for Womeit.<br />
More than two years of negotiation and consultation with<br />
somis 25,000 women underpin the National Agenda.<br />
Our reputation in this field is internationally<br />
unchallenged. Our voice is influential.<br />
The 1990s bring an unprecedented opportunity for developing<br />
ac. Loser partnership between our Governments.<br />
The goals are to improve our national efficiency and<br />
intarnational competitiveness, and to improve the delivery<br />
and quality of the services governments provide.<br />
On status of women issues, we can be proud of the level of<br />
consultation and coordination by Commonwealth and State<br />
governments. With Queensland's recent establishment of government<br />
machinery, there is for the first time a specific Minister<br />
in each State and Territory responsible for status of women<br />
issues. I am sure today's Conference and your work in the future<br />
will1 consolidate that structure and enhance the<br />
opportunities for progress to be made in the future.<br />
Today, your discussions will link in with the process and<br />
outcomes of the Special Premiers' Conference on<br />
Intergovernmental Relations.<br />
Your consideration of the paper, ' Women's Interests in the<br />
Commonwealth/ State Relations Review' will give this<br />
ConfEerence an important role in that process.<br />
1 4 </p>
<p>Also of significance today will be your consideration of the<br />
Ottawa Communique from the Third meeting of Commonwealth<br />
Ministers Responsible for Women's Affairs.<br />
This meeting, last October, reached unanimous agreement on<br />
strategies for improving the status of women, specifically<br />
in regard to Economic equality, structural adjustment and<br />
eliminating violence against women.<br />
Finally, I would welcome your consideration of the draft<br />
Declaration on Women and Structural Adjustment. I will be<br />
seeking support for this Declaration at the Commonwealth<br />
Heads of Government meeting later in the year, and I believe<br />
that support will be forthcoming.<br />
So you have a full. agenda before you.<br />
I commend the spirit of co-operation which is evident<br />
already and I wish you a successful inauigural meeting.<br />
I will n~ ow hand you over to the Minister Assisting me on the<br />
Status of Women, Wendy Fatin, who will be chairing your<br />
discussion. </p>
