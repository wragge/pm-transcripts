W AUS ALl A<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA MONDAY, 5 MAY, 1980<br />
ADDRESS TO SECOND NATIONAL CATHOLIC<br />
EDUCATION CONFERENCE, A. N. U.<br />
I am pleased indeed to be invited to open this conference,<br />
particularly-as I recall your last national gathering<br />
of this kind in 1972, when I was then Minister for<br />
Education and Science.<br />
That first conference took place against what was a fairly<br />
difficult background. For three quarters of a century freedom<br />
in education and the rights of church schools, and those who<br />
attended them, had been largely ignored. As a result, the<br />
commitment of Australian families to an education based on<br />
their religious faith provoked bitterncss, sacrifice, and<br />
a very great deal of hard work.<br />
I well recall the education environment at the beginning<br />
of the 1970s. It was a time, or had been a time, through<br />
he 50s and 60s, of great econc-mc expansion. Jobs were<br />
-available for those who wanted them. Because of this<br />
economic environment, insufficient attention was paid to the<br />
educational explosion that was taking place at the same time.<br />
Retention rates in State, indeed in all secondary schools,<br />
had been rising rapidly through the 50s and 60s. Costs of<br />
education were also increasing and the Catholic system was<br />
becoming more reliant on lay teachers, providing an<br />
additional cost burden for the Catholic system.<br />
Moreover, the economic climate enabled greater resources to<br />
go to Government-schools, thereby increasing the physical<br />
and resource pressures that again, were being exerted on<br />
large sections of the independent system.<br />
These pressures threatened the very future of many<br />
independent schools. It was a critical time for education,<br />
for independent schools and also for Government.<br />
We faced a question of whether this country, rich in diversity,<br />
was also to be served by diversity in education. Whether a<br />
right existed for those with particular religious beliefs to<br />
establish their own schools, or whether all education was to<br />
be secular and to be run by the State. / 2<br />
MRS L1j, 111vr,, 5, r0A46 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
~ As Minister then, I believed strongly that freedom, independence<br />
and choice in education were essential and the claims that<br />
Governments should greatly improve their assistance to private<br />
schools had to be answered.<br />
I do not doubt that well-endowed schools would have survived,<br />
no matter what the circumstances. But they are only a small<br />
part of the independent system.<br />
The-parish schools-* pla-ced--increai-ng burdens upon Australian<br />
families to-pay for an education based significantly on their<br />
commitment to a faith.<br />
* We should never lose sight I believe, in this c'ountry, of the<br />
great sacrifice made down through the years by those who believed,.-<br />
often-again-st significant odds, in the value and in the very<br />
exiteneof religious education..-.<br />
-Let us. dismiss now the fallacy that religious education is<br />
synonymous with wealth; that an endorsement of the values<br />
of religious education is an endorsement of the advantages of<br />
wealth. Many Australian families whose incomes are very low make great<br />
sacrifices, are prepared to pursue. difficult'courses, because<br />
of their faith and because of their religious beliefs.<br />
Pleasingly, since that first conference, new and important<br />
developments have taken place within the Catholic education<br />
system; as Governments have abandoned their neglect of<br />
private schools and initiated an active programme to restore<br />
equality and opportunity in education.<br />
From initial support for building programmes to the per capita<br />
grants, and now through increased support based on a right to<br />
education, Governments have demonstrated their recognition of<br />
commitment to a dual system of. education in Australia. It is<br />
worth noting that all Governments and all political parties,<br />
as I understand it, share in that commitment.<br />
My interest in and support for Catholic education is founded<br />
on its indispensable contribution, not only to education itself<br />
in Australia, but also to the moral values of Australian society.<br />
I am convinced that Government has an important role to play in<br />
reducing the inequalities in educational resources and<br />
* opportunities for all children in all schools. To do otherwise<br />
would be to undermine educational fairness and justice. To allow<br />
that to happen would be harmful to the-. vitality and potential<br />
growth of the entire community.<br />
Funds will co ntinue to be made available from the Commonwealth<br />
Bud get to meet the needs of both Government and of non-Government<br />
schools.; We shall continue to co-operate with the States, to<br />
make sure that all Australian children receive an education of<br />
the highest possible quality. </p>
<p>3-<br />
The Commonwealth is now the major source of public funds<br />
-for non-Government schools and currently provides about<br />
two-thirds of. their total public expenditure. But our<br />
commitment goes beyond the provision of funds. It is our<br />
firm belief that the continued existence of the independent<br />
school system in several ways improves the quality of all<br />
Australian-education.<br />
In the first place, it diversifies the educational opportunities,<br />
especially for those who want spiritual values to be part of<br />
the educational process. This leads to a strengthening of<br />
a community's social and moral fabric.<br />
Just as importantly, Government support-of independent schools<br />
underscores its commitment to freedom of choice in education,<br />
and the right of parents to educate their children as they<br />
believe right and proper.<br />
My colleague, the Minister for Education, Wal Fife, will<br />
I am sure be speaking in more detail about the nature of our<br />
involvement in and contribution to non-Government schools,<br />
including this most important componentE; the Catholic system.<br />
* In the meantime, I note that the theme of this conference deals<br />
with commitments for the 1980s. Clearly, the Catholic education<br />
sys. tem, combining application to scholarship with a full regard<br />
for the importance of morality and traditional values, already<br />
accepts a commitment which will be of increasing significance<br />
in the decades ahead.<br />
The last two or three decades have seen far-reaching and sweeping<br />
change in the Australian educational system. In the first place,.<br />
equality of opportunity rightly came to the forefront of<br />
educational objectives. This new emphasis on the importance of<br />
education was welcome. However, against this, methods of teaching<br />
did not always keep pace with the broadening of educational<br />
opportunity. Too many people for a while saw education as<br />
an end in itself, without due regard for its purpose, its<br />
content or its function. The extension of educational<br />
opportunities seemed to breed an acceptance of any sort of<br />
education, without consideration for what might be the best<br />
kind of education. This led to what some would call educational<br />
experimentation, in which needs of students were perhaps<br />
unwittingly sacrificed in a desire for change. Most teachers<br />
I am certain, approached the widening opportunities in education<br />
with dedication, with commitment, and with a very real concern.<br />
But at the same time, there was an increasing community anxiety<br />
that some new courses and untried methods were coming into<br />
operation against growing evidence that they did not advance<br />
the welfare of their students. At the same time as teaching<br />
methods were changing, the emphasis on effort, on -authority, and<br />
on rules, all suffered erosion.<br />
But the community also viewed wi th growing disapproval the fact that new<br />
theories about what education meant were being coupled with<br />
a dwindling regard for excellence in educational achievement. / 14 </p>
<p>-4<br />
We were living in buoyant economic times. This hid the<br />
* fact-that problems were being built into the education<br />
of-many Australian school children. Because school leavers<br />
could, by and large, obtain work without too much difficulty,<br />
because ' employers ware th~ ri 16ss discriminating thAn they<br />
now are,-the role of education in securing rewarding-and<br />
satisfying work was not well understood. However, as<br />
employment became morle difficult for sichool'leavers,<br />
education was increasingly put under the microscope and<br />
in-many instances it has been found wanting.<br />
* When this new perception of education is coupled with the<br />
favourable reduction in pupil-teacher ratios, the realisation<br />
that expenditure in primary and secondary education had<br />
risen phenomenally, community concern about the direction<br />
of education gathered momentum, and so well it might.<br />
In the current financial year, Commnonwealth and State<br />
Government expenditure on schools will approach $ 4,000 million,<br />
of which our share approaches some $ 800 million. Yet these<br />
figures do not include the substantial sums expended each<br />
year on tertiary education, most of which is borne by the<br />
Commonwealth Government. There is a further example of the<br />
massive escalation in expenditure; -the cost of maintaining<br />
children at a Government primary school rose from nearly<br />
$ 650 seven or eight years ago to nearly $ 1,000 in 1977-78.<br />
I have no doiubt it is noticably higher at-the present time.<br />
The increase in real terms is about 50 per cent. At the<br />
secondary level, the cost rose from just over $ 1,100 in<br />
.1972-73, to between $ 1,500 and $ 1,600 in 1977-78. An increase<br />
in real terms of nearly 40 per cent.<br />
Against that background, survival and strength of independent<br />
schools I believe became all the more necessary in the<br />
perception of many people, because the additional resources<br />
going to Government schools had not been seen to be parallel<br />
with an increase and betterment in the quality of education<br />
* that was in fact provided.<br />
Parents responded to the diversity in choice of our dual<br />
education system, and many parents took increasing advantage,<br />
often again at significant sacrifice of the processes at<br />
work in private education and in church schools.<br />
It is not often understood that the resources available to<br />
Government schools are on average far in excess of those<br />
available to the great bulk of private schools. In fact, the<br />
resource targets set by the Schools Commission have been so<br />
rapidly achieved by Government schools that they now average<br />
out very high on a scale established by the Schools Commission<br />
for measuring that function. If we look at independent schools,<br />
we find that 90 per cent of all primary school students and<br />
nearly 56 per cent of secondary students in the non-Government<br />
sector, often schools which are rated on their resources, as<br />
being near the bottom of the scale. Funds now provided by<br />
Government have only brought us therefore to the beginnings of the<br />
move to educational equality at least so far as the provision<br />
of resources goes. </p>
<p>5<br />
There is a fair way to go before we achieve equality<br />
in educational resources for all Australian schoQl children.<br />
There are two ways of guaranteeing Government support in the<br />
drive towards equal opportunity for children in non-Government<br />
schools. I understand that this is one of the matters that<br />
will be discussed amongst you in the hours, or the days,<br />
ahead. One way of course, is to make per capita grants on<br />
the basis of children at schools, on the basis of a right to<br />
a-share -in Government funds in-the educational process. The<br />
other is to provide for schools on the basis of need. I would<br />
suggest that if funds were provided only on the basis of need,<br />
something important in terms of equality of education is lost.<br />
o----Because it--does not-therefore accept-a basic. right for<br />
Governments to support the education of all children in all<br />
schools.<br />
What we in fact do of course is based on both principles. Some<br />
pat of support is based on a basis of-right, on a per capita<br />
basis, but then additional funds are . made available with<br />
*. schools with lesser resources and are in need of greater help.<br />
While few people today would dispute the right of church<br />
schools to their share of public funds, or the validity of<br />
our objective to see that for the poorer schools that share<br />
should be increased, some old ' resentments unfortunately still<br />
remain to Commonwealth or the. State Govarnment funding, causingproblems<br />
not only for Governments but also for the education<br />
system as a whole.<br />
I mentioned over the weekend, in 1973 one group took the<br />
legitimate, but as I believe the extreme course cf bringing the<br />
matter of Government aid to non-Government schools before<br />
theHigh Court.. -The very fact that the case arose has given<br />
concern in some-quarters. The Government, like all litigants,<br />
is hopeful of winning. But if that does not prove to be so,<br />
we will still remain unshaken in our cowm itment to our<br />
policies. We believe them to be important for Australia, for<br />
Australian education, and for Australian youth. We know<br />
they are vital for the survival of independent schools generally.<br />
I mentioned over the weekend that we would do what we could<br />
within the law to enable our policies to be pursued. I also<br />
mentioned that as a last resort, if necessary, we would seek<br />
a constitutional amendment to enable just and proper support<br />
to be given to religious and independent schools. I think we<br />
would all hope that we did not have to take that course. We<br />
would all hope that what is now done would be found to be<br />
proper and within the Constitution. If it were not so, the<br />
nature of any judgement would obviously have to be looked at<br />
very closely to see what was the best way of overcoming a<br />
problem. But if we were left with rules that denied the capacity<br />
of the Commonwealth to provide support to independent schools,<br />
we would immediately have a most serious and difficult crisis<br />
confronting all Australian education. There is no point in us<br />
not being prepared to see that,-examine it, and see what would<br />
have to be done about it. / 6 </p>
<p>6-<br />
What I wanted to make quite plain was that if that<br />
unfortunate circumstance did arise, our commitment to<br />
support for independent schools would remain unshaken and<br />
determined. Since all Governments, and as I believe all political parties,<br />
have a common view and a shared view, I would hope that<br />
the means of overcoming the problem could be achieved without<br />
arousing once again the difficulties and the bitterness<br />
that were caused by this particular debate in past years.<br />
We enter the 198' Os with increasing enrolments . in<br />
the private school system, and especially in Catholic schools,<br />
-indicating that what goes on in your schools is being perceived<br />
by the community as providing an adequate response to the<br />
demands of a modern industrial society and the new educational<br />
requirements. The second community response to the educational problems of<br />
the last two decades is the demand for a return to emphasis<br />
in education on traditional skills, which in some schools<br />
had been put aside. Attention is being focussed on the<br />
capacity of schools to provide competence -in literacy and<br />
numeracy, while developing at the same time attitudes that<br />
enable a student to enter the-adult world with confidence, and<br />
pride in himself and his capacities.<br />
These-qualities are a necessary foundation for all careers, in<br />
all walks of life. But there is still a growing concern that<br />
what students do as part of the educational process ought to<br />
be assessed against fair and tesl-Lig criteria. That necessarily<br />
involves measurement and examination of effort. That is not<br />
to say that measurement is more important than any other aspect<br />
of the learning process. But we need to get examinations into<br />
perspective in education, rather than pretend that they have<br />
no part in what goes on. Admittedly, some growth and<br />
development is easily measured. Other growth is harder to<br />
measure, maybe sometimes even impossible to measure. But to<br />
place all store in quick, visibly measured improvement can<br />
distort the learning task. The measurement of achievement<br />
is important because young people seek achievement from their<br />
educational experiences.<br />
Nonetheless, there are critics of examinations who base their<br />
criticism on the fact that examinations create pressure. At<br />
certain levels, and for certain students, pressure in education<br />
applied too early in life can have negative effects. But one<br />
of the things that the education process needs to do is to<br />
teach people to perform through pressure and gradually expose<br />
them to stresses that would be placed, on them when they<br />
leave school.<br />
The whole learning process, of which examns are a necessary part<br />
as I believe, needs to be designed to enable people to respond<br />
and work well under difficult and challenging circumstances.<br />
It needs to test students so that their own levels of performance<br />
are understood by them, and their capacities are developed as<br />
well and as far as possible. / 7 </p>
<p>-7-<br />
The Williams Report has drawn attention to-many of the<br />
problems faced-in the aftermath of the change of direction<br />
in education that took place over the last two to three<br />
decades. It found that a disturbingly high proportion of<br />
leavers had not achieved a standard of literacy and numeracy<br />
that would enable them to make a satisfactory transition from<br />
school to work. Evidence presented to the committee, for<br />
example,' by the Institute of Personnel-Management, expressed<br />
-deep--concern that after years of primary and secondary<br />
schooling,--and-vast expenditure on education, many school<br />
leavers were inadequately equipped with the essential--skills<br />
*. of literacy, oral fluency, and numneracy. The -Institute<br />
-estimated that up-to 15 per. cent of school leavers were not<br />
able-to -read an employment advertisement, or complete a simple---<br />
application form. Independent studies commissioned by the<br />
Committee found that 15 per cent of 14 year olds were deficient<br />
in-number work and 50 per cent of 14 year olds could not write<br />
-a satisfactory letter of application for employment.<br />
: These-are regrettable legacies of the past, requiring<br />
re-assessment of the aims, the objectives, and the methods<br />
of education.<br />
In particular, they highlight the disturbing reality that<br />
mqny young people have passed through school almost-totally<br />
unsuited to the demands of modern society and to the workforce<br />
of which they would want to be a part.<br />
However, to those who speak about a lost generation,. the<br />
problem needs to be placed very much in perspective. Of the<br />
250,000 young Australian who left school last year, some<br />
60,000 continued with education in tertiary institutions.:<br />
A further 140,000 found employment with relatively little<br />
difficulty, 40,000 of these obtaining apprenticeships which<br />
would equip them with valuable vocational skills.<br />
A further 10,' 000 were unavailable for study or for employment.<br />
That is hardly the picture of a lost generation. But it is<br />
true that about 40,000 young people failed to obtain full-time<br />
employment in the way the community which they, their parents<br />
and schools would have wanted.<br />
-In August of 1979,. the highest percentage rates of unemployment<br />
we know were amongst young school leavers in the 15 to 16 year<br />
old group. It is to these people that the system has failed<br />
and the Government's primary concern in its programme is for<br />
people like these who leave school each year with difficult<br />
employment prospects.<br />
The Government's programmes arc also directed at those students<br />
still at school who are likely to be at risk when it comes<br />
their time to leave.<br />
Late last year the then Minister for Education announced a<br />
comprehensive policy on transition from school to work, which<br />
aims to upgrade skills, attitudes and employment prospects for<br />
young people. Our commitment is that in this year we have made<br />
available about $ 25 million for this important programme, with<br />
a significant commitment over a five year period. </p>
<p>8-<br />
Our hope is that State Governments will join with us<br />
in this programme and themselves contribute to it.<br />
So far, we have had good co-operation from each of the<br />
States in starting this initiative. Nonetheless, in a<br />
sense these measures attack the problem only-after it<br />
has developed.* A good argument could be construed to say<br />
that if schools were all doing the job they need to do and<br />
ought to be doing, this new programme of transition from<br />
school to work would in fact not be necessary. In a sense,<br />
the very fact that these programmes are needed indicate<br />
the failure of the school system to a significant number<br />
of young Australians.<br />
What in-essence has happened is that many young Australians<br />
have paid the price of an insufficient balance between formal<br />
education and practical training. School courses should be<br />
wide enough to respond to people with different talents and<br />
different inclinations. One of the failures of past years<br />
has been that too many people, too many schools, have<br />
concentrated on the academic scene. They have had the view<br />
that those with academic talents were good, could progress, that<br />
those without were not given the different kind of attention<br />
and care and concern that they need just as much as those with<br />
an academic bent of mind.<br />
In the days when people were saying t-hat secondary schooling<br />
was all about academic training, they were forgetting that there<br />
are other students with other talents, with other inclinations,<br />
that may be just as useful, just as constructive, just as<br />
necessary and. sometimes more necessary in Australian society,<br />
but which were not given the attLntion and concern in the<br />
school system. I think, again, these are a part of the<br />
group that the school systems have failed.<br />
Our education system needs to be disciplined enough, diverse<br />
enough, and responsive enough to find for each student something<br />
that that student can do well, s-omething which will give<br />
each student satisfaction, and through this satisfaction<br />
the confidence to face the adult world with a faith in his or<br />
her own ability. If schools do not achieve that for all their<br />
students, I look upon that not as a failure for the student,<br />
but as a failure for the school itself.<br />
In meeting these requirements, the Catholic education system<br />
is an effective partner with the Commonwealth, not only in the<br />
direct education of many young Australians, but also through<br />
a series of special activities and special initiatives.<br />
For some years Catholic schools have participated in joint<br />
programmes of the Sdhools Commission which aimed to help those<br />
recognised as having particularly pressing education needs, such<br />
as those with specific physical and mental handicaps. It has<br />
also been pleasing to note the enthusiasm with which the<br />
Catholic school system have indicated their willingness to<br />
participate in 1980 in the Government school to work transition<br />
policy. These are encouraging. signs. </p>
<p>-9-<br />
Increasingly education is being seen, not just as a preparation<br />
for life, but as a large part of life itself. It must<br />
facilitate understanding of and adjustment to inescapable<br />
and sometimes accelerating and challenging changes.<br />
The Government will continue to make its contribution, but<br />
the real challenge must always be one for people most<br />
intimately involved in the educational process:. . parents,<br />
teachers, staff and students. But above all, young people need<br />
* to avail themselves of the opportunities that lie ahead of them.<br />
Many of these wi-1-l derive from the prospects for the Australian<br />
economy over the whole of the 19.80s. And of all1 the countries<br />
around the world, I know.-of no-country with better prospects<br />
than this.<br />
Over the last twelve months, to March of this year, 180,000<br />
new jobs have been created in Australia. That is a better year<br />
than any for. a very long while. That gives cause for encouragement<br />
in the future. Further, by June of 1980, over half a million<br />
Australians, many of them young Australians, will have been<br />
helped by the various training programmes that-the Commonwealth<br />
has introduced to help give people the kind of jobs skills and<br />
experience which is necessary to gain satisfying and rewarding<br />
work. Young people must be-encouraged to work at these opportunties<br />
and to appreciate that by doing so, they face a future in which<br />
they can be truly free;-free for-work and for leisure, for<br />
being something and well as doing something.<br />
It is the hope of us all in the 1980s that education will teach<br />
our youth a sense of worth and dignity of others, to feel<br />
their debt to others, to have commitments, commitments to causes<br />
and concerns they have thought about and made their own.<br />
We want our young people, because they owe something to the<br />
world, to be prepared for a life of service to something<br />
beyond themselves.<br />
I am sure this conference will provide a stimulating forum<br />
for discussion of the means whereby such education goals of the<br />
can be sustained and realised. * I congratulate you all on<br />
the contribution you have made to the educational development<br />
of Australia, and I welcome your commitment to the chall~ enge of<br />
the decade ahead. I will have pleas ' ure in seeing what conclusions<br />
you come to over the next two or three or four days. It is my<br />
very great pleasure indeed, to declare open this Second<br />
National Catholic Education Conference. 000---</p>
