SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATE BANQUET<br />
SEOUL 30 JANUARY 1989<br />
Mr President,<br />
I am del~ ighted to return once more to Saoul during such an<br />
Important period in the history of the Republic of Korea.<br />
This in my second visit to your country, so I am well able to<br />
appreciate the considerable changes in some cases the<br />
spectacular changes that have been wrought here since my<br />
first visit in 1984.<br />
over those five years the Korean economy has continued to<br />
grow vigorously, providing greater prosperity for its people<br />
through increased domestic production and through increased<br />
exports including, I might add, to Australia. J7ust as<br />
striking, and just as welcome, hau been the emergence of -the<br />
democratic processes in this country.<br />
And most recently, of course, with the hosting of the Olympic<br />
Games, the people of this city and of this nation showed the<br />
whole world what we in this Pacific region already knew -and<br />
understood: that -the Korean nation has. indeed come of age as<br />
a modern, dynamic and sophisticated participant in world<br />
events.<br />
Mr President,<br />
In the past, foreign dignitaries visiting this nation would<br />
almost certainly apend time in the Demilitarized Zone, the<br />
border which tragically bisects the Korean Peninsula and<br />
divides the Ko-reen people.<br />
The DMZ iv a powerful symbol of the iftdomitable tenacity of<br />
the people of this nation, and is a potent reminder of the<br />
sacrifices they made during the Korean War to defend liberty;<br />
Australians too recall with pride the fighting record of our<br />
soldiers under the United Nations banner, and remember with<br />
sadness the Australians who died here.<br />
Today, the DMZ is still a vivid reminder to us of the need<br />
for vigilance. </p>
<p>Yet with all the changes taking place in the Republic of<br />
Korea the growing prosperity, the very real efforts to<br />
fulfil the aspirations of ordinary Koreans and with the<br />
growing evidence of a newly constructive dialogue between the<br />
superpowers, the D'MZ has been eclipsed as the principal focus<br />
of attention for visitors to your country.<br />
I shall not be visiting the DMZ; I shall however, on<br />
Wednesday mnorning, be visiting your splendid Olympic<br />
facilities the focus of activity of the 24th Olympiad and,<br />
I believe, an appropriate symbol of today's Korea:<br />
optimistic, confide'nt and vigorous.<br />
Mr President,<br />
You above all can take real credit for all these positive<br />
developments. The Republic of Korea has, of course, a number<br />
of issues to solve before the process of reform is compiete.<br />
But to the extent that progress is being made and reforms are<br />
being instituted, you can claim very great responsibility for<br />
it.<br />
History will record that you have made every effort to seize'<br />
the opportunities presented by this Year of the Golden Dragon<br />
which, I am told, comes only once every 60 years. I<br />
sincerely hope that the Year of the Snake will see the wise<br />
consolidation and further expansion of your rapid economic<br />
and political progress of recent years.<br />
Four months ago it was my pleasure to welcome you and Mrs Roh<br />
to Australia, when you honoured us by including Australia in<br />
your first visit overseas as President. Our discussions in<br />
Canberra,. which covered so many issues of vital interest -to<br />
both our countries, were of real value in strengthening the<br />
ties between our two countries and did much to inform<br />
Australia's perception of regional developments.<br />
Today, in resuming those discussions, we have further<br />
strengthened the foundations of the Korean-Australian<br />
relationship. The importance of this pattern of dialogue and<br />
consultation between two countries sharing as many common<br />
interests as we do, cannot be overestimated. Lot me add, Mr<br />
President, that I value highly the personal relationship that<br />
has been established in our meetings.<br />
When-we met in Canberra last year, we concluded a memorandum<br />
on science and technology. we agreed to enter negotiations<br />
for a bilateral aviation agreement. We undertook to<br />
establish a joint cultural commission and to explore the<br />
possibilities for an Australia/ Korea Forum to examine the<br />
future direction of our relationship. </p>
<p>3<br />
In the period since those talks, progress has been made in<br />
all these areas of our relationship. I am especially pleased<br />
that, during our talks today, we were able to agree on<br />
further arrangements for the Forum which will, I am sure,<br />
provide a catalyst for a genuine broadening of the<br />
relationship.<br />
These co-operative efforts at the official level are soundly<br />
underpi. nned by the people-to-people links between us. Those<br />
many Australians who visited Korea for the Olympics retain<br />
warm memories of this ' country -as do the millions who<br />
watched the competition on TV.<br />
The Korean community in Australia, numbering some 12,000<br />
people, has made a valued and important contribution to our<br />
country. This growing and diverse community sustains a<br />
number of Korean language community schools in Australia and<br />
holds regular cultural festivals in our major cities. Korean<br />
language courses are also taught at two Australian<br />
universities, and there is an increasing number of Korean<br />
students in Australia.<br />
I want to make it crystal clear before this audience that the<br />
Korean community, and communities of people from other parts<br />
of Asia, are very welcome members of Australia's<br />
multicultural society. Australia has been immeasurably<br />
enriched by the contribution of millions of new citizens from<br />
around the world. We are determined that our immigration<br />
selection procedures will remain free of any taint of<br />
discrimination on grounds of race.<br />
Mr President,<br />
Events over the last few months in your country have been<br />
dramatic and encouraging. Since our last meeting you have<br />
appointed a new Prime Minister, Mr Kang, whom I had the<br />
pleasure of meeting last night, and a new Cabinet. You havel<br />
undertaken further measures to enhance democracy and human<br />
rights in the Republic of'Korea. The road you have chosen<br />
may not be an easy one but it is, I believe, an essential one<br />
and one which will contribute significantly not only to<br />
progress within Korea but to peace and stability in the wider<br />
region. You arn considering the report of the Presidential Commission<br />
on Economic Restructuring, which, if implemented, will<br />
present new challenges and opportunities for our two<br />
countries to develop our economic links further and to expand<br />
our two-way trade, which is now worth almost A$ 3 billion<br />
annually. </p>
<p>You have also announced changes to the financial and service<br />
sectors, and indicated your intention to open up the import<br />
market for agricultural products.<br />
Mr President,<br />
Such mnatters are of real interest-to Australias because in an<br />
increasingly interdependent. world, Australia's economic<br />
well-being is bound up with the economic well-being of our<br />
trading partners.<br />
I am especially pleased to be accompanied on this visit by a<br />
number of leaders of-Australian industry. Their presence<br />
underlines our commitment to building further the already<br />
healthy economic co-operation we enjoy with the Republic of<br />
Korea. It highlights our willingness and ability to continue<br />
to make a contribution to the success of the newly<br />
industrialised economies of the region, and to seize<br />
opportunities for joint activity and co-operation across a<br />
range of areas, including in the manufacturing and services<br />
sectors. Our trading relationship is not without its difficulties. we<br />
have had disagreements about Australia's anti-dumping actionsand<br />
about Korea's ban on the import of beef. It is important<br />
that where such issues arise, we resolve them in a manner<br />
consis'Cent with the growing maturity of our relationship, and<br />
in a framework consistent with our shared commitment to an<br />
open international trading environment.<br />
As we discussed in our talks both in Canberra and today, that<br />
multilateral environment is coming under pressure as never<br />
before in the decades since World War II.. Trading relations<br />
involving the major economies are increasingly characterised<br />
by reciprocity rather than non-discrimination by exclusive<br />
blocs rather than free and fair global competition.<br />
The GATT System is under threat. The Montreal* Mid-Term<br />
Review was profoundly disappointing in that it failed to make<br />
progress in the vital issues it faced and that does not<br />
augur well for resolving other long-standing and important<br />
issues like textiles, clothing and footwear, and the whole<br />
range of non-tariff measures.<br />
It is my firm belief that multilateralism. and an open world<br />
market are worth fighting for.<br />
They are principles that have underpinned the prosperity of<br />
both our countries and indeed that have fostered the<br />
extraordinary economic dynamism of the entire Pacific Rim<br />
region in which we are placed. </p>
<p>We must be vigilant in ensuring that our interests are not<br />
compromised by the emerging trading blocs.<br />
We must reverse current trends and focus on improving the<br />
GATT framework of international trade rules.<br />
Unless we do this, we will lose all semblance of fair play in<br />
the international trading system. Make no mistake, it will<br />
be the ordinary citizens of trading nations like Australia<br />
and the Republic of Korea who will pay the price as consumer<br />
costs increase and as job opportunities are lost.<br />
Mr President,<br />
The friendship between our two countries is one that has<br />
stood the test of time. Since the foundation of the Republic!<br />
of Korea in 1948, Australia's support for the Korean people<br />
has been consistent and principled, and has been expressed in<br />
times of war and of peace.<br />
We continue to support the sovereign rights of the Republic.<br />
Yet for many years Australia has recognised the reality that<br />
there are two states and two governments on the Korean<br />
Peninsula. I have congratulated you in private, during our discussions<br />
in Canberra, and again today, on the forward-looking sweep of<br />
your new ' northern policy'. I take this opportunity to<br />
commend you in public for I believe this approach has the<br />
potential to benefit the whole region. It is particularly<br />
appropriate at this time of increasingly constructive<br />
dialogue between the major powers, the United States, the<br />
Soviet Union and China.<br />
As you are aware, my Government has recently made some<br />
preliminary moves towards re-establishing dialogue with the<br />
Democratic Peoples' Republic of Korea. It is my view, and I<br />
know this is one you share, that few interests are served in<br />
having North Korea standing outside normal international<br />
interaction and dialogue. We must capitalise on the<br />
opportunities before us.<br />
Mr President,<br />
It is our great privilege to lead our countries at a time of<br />
profound and far reaching change in international affairs.<br />
The pace of change and its generally positive direction have,<br />
even over the last twelve months, been sufficient to give us<br />
considerable justification for confidence in our planning for<br />
the future. </p>
<p>6.<br />
We are both allies of the United States. Both our<br />
Governments wish the Bush Administration well as it takes<br />
over the reins. We have both enjoyed the central role that<br />
the great American democracy has played. in enhiancing and<br />
securing our well-being.<br />
We each watch with real interest the changing attitudes of<br />
the Soviet Union in managing its own domestic affairs and in<br />
its foreign policy, particularly as it effects our own<br />
region.<br />
President Gorbachev's-two major policy pronouncements at<br />
Vladivostok in 1906' and Krasnoyarsk last year have, as yet,<br />
had only limited practical impact. This stands in contrast<br />
to the progress that has been achieved in solving outstanding<br />
problems in other parts of the world Afghanistan being a<br />
bold example and in the field of nuclear disarmament.<br />
While Australia shares some of the caution of our regional<br />
partners about the Soviet Union, we firmly believe that our<br />
interests and those of the region as a whole would be<br />
advanced were a Soviet Union different from the one we have<br />
known in the past to enter constructively into the mainstream<br />
of international political, social and economic life. The<br />
possibility now exists. The opportunity is too vital to go<br />
untested.<br />
Mr President,<br />
The challenges facing us in our region and in the<br />
international arena are considerable.<br />
They will require hard work and good will if they are to be<br />
resolved.<br />
Australia and K( orea are well placed to play a creative and<br />
important role in ensuring the continued prosperity of.-our<br />
region, and in fostering its growth towards democracy,<br />
individual freedoms and human rights.<br />
We can better achieve these goals if we remain in close arnd<br />
friendly contact.<br />
it is my very firm belief that the warm and constructive<br />
visits between us over the last few months have indeed<br />
reinforced the already strong foundations for such a<br />
relationship. </p>
<p>7.<br />
Mr President and Mrs Roh, thank you most sincerely for your<br />
hospitality this evening. H~ azel and I have had a most<br />
enjoyable time during this visit. My only regret,<br />
Mr President, is that your winter has prevented us from<br />
engaging in a further round of golf-course diplomacy. But we<br />
won't let that stop us; we will merely substitute the golf<br />
with a bit of tennis diplomacy! I should say for the benefit<br />
of those here tonight that both our golf and tennis are<br />
played in the very best of Seoul's Olympic spirit. </p>
