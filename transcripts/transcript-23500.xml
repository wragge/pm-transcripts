    <content><![CDATA[<p align="LEFT" dir="LTR">Over six years, Labor ran up a $667 billion debt on the nationâs credit card. Every single month this debt is costing us a billion dollars just to cover the interest bill. </p>
<p align="LEFT" dir="LTR">You didnât ask for Laborâs legacy of debt, but you did ask for a government with a plan and the will to fix it. </p>
<p align="LEFT" dir="LTR">So last Tuesday, the Treasurer Joe Hockey handed down our first Budget. </p>
<p align="LEFT" dir="LTR">It is a tough Budget but it is also a visionary Budget. It is a Budget for our future. It is the Governmentâs Action Strategy to fix Laborâs mess and to build a better Australia.</p>
<p align="LEFT" dir="LTR">It lays the foundation for a stronger economy â by reducing projected debt by almost $300 billion over the next decade. </p>
<p align="LEFT" dir="LTR">This means that important safety nets for families, for pensioners and for those that need government assistance can be preserved into the future.</p>
<p align="LEFT" dir="LTR">All Australians are contributing to the Budget repair and by fixing the Budget now, we can start straight away on building a better and more prosperous future. </p>
<p align="LEFT" dir="LTR">Thereâs a $50 billion investment in roads and infrastructure, to create more jobs and to make it easier for you to get around.</p>
<p align="LEFT" dir="LTR">A stronger Budget means that we can make it easier for everyone to get a qualification and for the first time the same government loans that have been available to study at University, will now be made available for people who want to get a diploma at TAFE.</p>
<p align="LEFT" dir="LTR">Weâre also establishing a $20 billion Medical Research Future Fund. This will double our nationâs investment in finding cures for disease and better medical treatments so we can all live healthier and happier lives.</p>
<p align="LEFT" dir="LTR">These nation building initiatives are only possible because weâre all working together.</p>
<p align="LEFT" dir="LTR">By reducing Laborâs debt we can all share in the benefits of a stronger economy, more jobs, greater wealth and a better, brighter future for our country.</p>
