FOR PRESS<br />
STATEMENT BY MR. E, G. WILITLAM, Q. C.<br />
I am informed by the Chief Electoral Officer, Mr. Ley,<br />
that it may well be the end of next week, i. e. Friday,<br />
December, before the counting can be completed in certain<br />
electorates where the voting is close. In the light of this,<br />
it would not seem possible or proper for the Federal<br />
Parliamentary Labor Party to mee-before Monday, 18 December.<br />
There are certain things which I believe must be put<br />
in hand by the incoming government before then.<br />
One example is action on abolishing conscription.<br />
Another is the reference to the Tariff Board covering<br />
colour television. A third is an application to the Commonwealth<br />
Conciliation and Arbitration Commission to reopen the Equal Pay<br />
Case so that the new government can support the claim.<br />
There are also several matters in foreign affairs,<br />
including votes in the United Nations General Assembly.<br />
Each of these is urgent. There are other examples.<br />
Accordingly, consideration has been given to ways in<br />
which administration could be ta'., en up immediately by the<br />
incoming government. Therefore, I have today recommended to His Excellency<br />
the Governor-General that he swear my Deputy, Mr. Lance Barnard,<br />
and me to all existing ministerial offices. His Excellency<br />
has agreed and the swearing will take place this afternoon.<br />
This allocation of portfolios is, of course, temporary.<br />
It will operate only until such time as the full Ministry is<br />
selected and can be sworn. I hive given His Excellency an<br />
assurance on this point.<br />
Attached is a list showing the allocation of portfolios. </p>
<p>Where decisions are to be taken, Mr. Barnard and I<br />
shall, of course, continue to consult with our appropriate<br />
colleagues as necessary.<br />
I have told Mr. McMahon that he and his ministers and<br />
their staffs should feel free to use their present offices and<br />
facilities till the end of next week.<br />
