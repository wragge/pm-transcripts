PRIME MINISTER'S ADDRESS AT THElI9th AUSTRALIAN LEGAL CONVENTION<br />
S Y D N E Y<br />
It is a great pleasure to attend the official opening of this,<br />
the 19th AustraliansLegal Convention.<br />
This morning I wish to say a few words about what I believe to be<br />
the unprecedented programme of law reform which is now being<br />
pursued by the Commonwealth Government.<br />
In the last 18 months, there have been: a restructuring of the<br />
Federal Court system; a fundamental revision of Federal<br />
Administrative law; the introduction of important human rights<br />
legislation; a thoroughgoing review of legislation on trade<br />
practices and consumer protection; references on a wide range of<br />
issues to the Australian Law Reform Commission; and of course<br />
threeConstitutionaJ amendments.<br />
Perhaps we should ponder why it is only now that concerted moves<br />
towards law reform have occurred particularly when one considers<br />
that past Parliaments and Cabinets have been dominated by lawyers,<br />
the very people, one might have thought, who would have beeh most<br />
conscious of deficiencies in the law. Clearly, it required a<br />
Cabinet in which the lawyers are for once outnumbered by the<br />
humble primary producer to give the necessary impetus for law<br />
refor:,. Perhaps the temptation for the farmer to be his own bush<br />
lawyer has again proved irresistable.<br />
But I am pleased to assure you that the guiding hand for this<br />
programme of ref6rm has come from a most distinguished lawyer,<br />
the Attorney General, Bob Ellicott.: I believe it'is already clear<br />
that in Bob Ellicott We are fortunate to have. one of the finest<br />
and most far-sighted attorneys in our history. Under Bob Ellicott,<br />
we have taken quite a new direction in law reform in Australia, a<br />
direction entirely. in keeping with, our traditions.<br />
We have deliberately set about promoting what I might term<br />
" participatory law reform". If the law is to be updated, if<br />
advances of science and technology are to beacknowledged and<br />
accommodated, and if our traditional liberties are to be protected,<br />
it is vitl that the community governed by the law should take part<br />
in helping to frame reforms in. that law.<br />

Government his adopted the practice of allowing Bills to lie on the<br />
table of Parliament for a substantial period of time, to encourage<br />
/ informed </p>
<p>informed public debate and comment, aimed at improving the<br />
legislation. This process can only be to the advantage of the<br />
nation, and the Government has shown its readiness to amend such<br />
Bills in the light of constructive criticisms received.<br />
' ine Australian Law Reform Commission has also-actively-sought to<br />
engender public interest in the tasks assigned to_ it by the<br />
Government. The Commission has held public sittings and seminars<br />
in all parts of the country. . It has distributed-widely tentative<br />
proposals for reform, and it has stimulated much informed discussi-. c<br />
in the media. This process has amply shown that the Australian<br />
community will respond to an invitation to participate in the<br />
process of legal renewal. Public acceptancd of the need for<br />
reform in many areas which have long remained untouched is now<br />
widespread. Perhaps no better example could be provided of the prevailing mooo<br />
for reform than the recent amendments to our Constitution.<br />
In the 76 years before the recent referendums, 32 proposed<br />
amendments had been submitted to the people but only 5 had<br />
been accepted. On May 21 as you all know, 3 of the 4 proposals<br />
that were put to the vote were passed, and the fourth proposal<br />
only failed narrowly. An essential prerequisite for the success<br />
of the three Constitutional changes was the endorsement given to<br />
them,' in principle, at the Hobart session of the Constitutional<br />
Convention last year. I am pleased to be able'to inform you that,<br />
at the Premiers Conference a few days ago, the Commonwealth and<br />
all six states agreed that the valuable work of the Convention<br />
should proceed, and a further session will be held in Perth early<br />
next year.<br />
Perhaps the most important of the reforming measures which we have<br />
introduced are those which bear directly or indirectly upon the<br />
subject of human rights. I am delighted to see that among your<br />
distinguished guests at this Convention, there are many to whom<br />
this subject is very close to the heart, and I would particularP,<br />
mention your next speaker, the Chief Justice of Canada, the Chief<br />
Justice of Nigeria, and the Lord President of the Courts of Malaysia.<br />
We are living in times when there is an increasing recognition of<br />
the need to respect human rights. This recognition transcends<br />
national boundaries, and is, or should be, the active concern of<br />
all liberal democracies. For too long there has been a tendency<br />
for democratic leaders to be on the defensive; to assume that the<br />
values we cherish such as individual liberty, parliamentary<br />
democracy and the rule of law are too obvious to require active<br />
promotion. There is a clear need for all of us, and this need<br />
certainly extends to the legal community, to proclaim and uphold<br />
the virtues and values of our system of government and liberal<br />
traditions.<br />
Today, the 4th of July, seems a most appropriate day to affirm that<br />
the renewed emphasis placed on human rights in internationaL affairs,<br />
and the role played by President Carter in this, are to be welcomed<br />
wholeheartedly. The Commonwealth Government is firmly cormmitted<br />
to the cause of promoting hurma rights.<br />
Accordingly we were particularly pleased at the recent election of<br />
Australia to the United Nations Hum. an Rights Commission. T.-</p>
<p>elections for this Commission were strongly contested and it was<br />
a signal honour for Australia to be selected.<br />
The Commonwealth Government is determined to play its part in<br />
enh-ancing human rights in this country. In the last sittings of the<br />
Commonwealth Par f ament, the Government introduced a Human Rights<br />
Commission Bill.' The purpose of this Bill is to ensure that<br />
Commonwealth and Tetritory laws, acts and practices conform with<br />
the international covenant on civil and political rights.<br />
Significantly, the Bill will give individuals a specific right<br />
to complain to the Commission. The Bill has deliberately been<br />
left to lie on the table of the House during the present Parliamentary<br />
recess to encourage public comment. In the light of comments<br />
received, amendments may be made to the Bill, and I hope that<br />
discussions with state governments will establish a foundation<br />
fo'-Commonwealth-State co-operation ir this.-important field.<br />
Another current Bill of great importance is relation to human rights<br />
is the Criminal Investigation Bill. The basic purpose of this Bill<br />
which is based on a report of the Australian Law Reform Commission,<br />
is to codify and clarify the rights and duties of citizens and<br />
Commonwealth Police when involved in the process of criminal<br />
investigation. This is an area in which there has been much dissatisfaction,<br />
considerable writing, many proposals for reform, but<br />
not much legislative action. With this Bill, as with the Human Rights<br />
Commission Bill, the Government is proceeding in a way that will ensure<br />
adequate opportunity for the views of all interested persons to be<br />
presented and duly considered.<br />
Apart from the-Human Rights Commission Bill and the Criminal<br />
Investigation Bill, the Government has been active in a number of<br />
areas which relate to human rights. Some matters have been referred<br />
by it to the Australian Law Reform Commission for consideration and<br />
report. Others have been the subject of direct legislative action<br />
by the Government.<br />
The matters which the Gove: rnment has referred to the Law Reform<br />
Commission include a reference for a major review of the laws<br />
to protect privacy in the Australian community: a reference to<br />
reform the laws of defamation, so vital for striking the right<br />
balance bet'een freedom of speech and the maintenance of honour<br />
and reputation: a reference relating to the issue of aboriginal<br />
customary laws and whether it is possible and desirable to incorporate<br />
aboriginal tribal laws into the domestic law of Australia:<br />
and finally, perhaps of particular interest to many present here<br />
today, a reference concerning the question of the standing to sue<br />
in Federal Courts and Courts exercising Federal jurisdiction.<br />
It is appropriate that at this point of time, following the<br />
establ'ishment of the Federal Court of Aus. tralia, we should reconsider<br />
the rules which govern the rights of persons to open the doors to the'<br />
Courts. These rules fundamentally affect the relevance and capacity<br />
of the courts and the legal system in providing solutions to the<br />
problems and tensions of our society. / In a </p>
<p>4-<br />
In a number of other matters, the Government is proceeding without<br />
prior references to the Law Reform Commission. In particular I<br />
draw attention here to-a wide range of measures that are designed<br />
to make public administration more responsive to the needs of the<br />
cit. zen. These measures when completed will give the Commonwealth<br />
a s~ stem of administrative law as comprehensive. and as well attuned<br />
to the protection of human rights as exists in any other common law<br />
country. Ma, I refer briefly tq some of these measures: The Administrative<br />
Appeals Tribunal was brought into being on 1 July 1976. The<br />
jurisdiction of the Tribunal has been expanded since then and the<br />
Government is-taking steps to give the Tribunal-jurisdiction in<br />
social security and repatriation matters: The Administrative Review<br />
Council has been appointed. It has already provided advice to the<br />
Attorney-General on a number of aspects of administrative law and<br />
procedures, and will be of considerable value as a " watch-dog" to<br />
cnsure that administrative procedures: provide proper protection<br />
for the rights of individuals: The Ombudsman Act has been enacted<br />
and the first Commonwealth Ombudsman, Professor Jack Richardson,<br />
took up duty last Friday: Parliament recently passed the<br />
Administrative Decisions ( Judicial Review) Act. When it comes<br />
into force it will supercede the old prerogative writs and introduce<br />
simplified procedures for judicial review of administrative decisions<br />
and actions. The Act also gives a person for the first time a<br />
general right to obtain the reasons for administrative decisions<br />
and actions which adversely affect him: The Government proposes<br />
to introduce a Freedom" of Information Bill in the budget sittings<br />
of the Parliament: The Attorney-General is preparing legislation<br />
to establish standard procedures for Commonwealth Administrative<br />
Tribunals along the lines of the recommendations made by the Kerr<br />
Committee in 1971. All of these measures taken together will form<br />
a system intended to provide individuals with adequate means of<br />
obtaining information about decisions of government that affect<br />
them, and effective and impartial investigation of their grievan.<br />
In 1980, Australia will be hosting the sixth United Nations Cong<br />
on the prevention of crime and the treatment of offenders. The<br />
Congress which will be held in this magnificent building, the<br />
Sydney Opera House, will be attended by over 1500 delegates, and<br />
ill, I understand, be the largest United Nations meeting to have<br />
Loen held in this country. The Congress will focus world attention<br />
on Australian criminal justice, laws and practices. A comprehensive<br />
programme for the congress has been launched, involving the<br />
Commonwealth and State Attorneys-General and other Ministers.<br />
Governmental and private agencies have been asked to revise and<br />
update relevant laws and practices and to bring Australian programmes<br />
and achievements in this field to the attention of Congress participants.<br />
I am sure that Australian lawyers will wish to contribute to<br />
the success of the Congress.<br />
Finally, may I mention a recent initiative tak'r by the Government<br />
which could have a significant impact on the profession; s management<br />
techniques. The complexity of the law and increasing volume of<br />
legal business require a search for new methods to enable existing<br />
resources to be deployed with greater efficiency. The Commonwealth<br />
Government has been conscious of the need to meet this challenge<br />
for some time, and has recently decided to establi. &gt; i a computerbased<br />
legal information retrieval system. Cononwealth StaU. tes<br />
passed to the end of 1973 have been placed on magnetic tape ac. arc: </p>
