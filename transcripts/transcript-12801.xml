The Government has endorsed a plan to expand Australia';s Special Forces counter terrorist capability and establish a new Special Operations Command in the Australian Defence Force.<br />
The Chief of the Defence Force will begin work as a matter of urgency to deliver on the framework endorsed by the Government.<br />
The new initiative will further increase Australia';s ability to use non-conventional warfighting means to respond to the threat of terrorism.<br />
It will deliver an additional 310 highly trained combat personnel along with associated support personnel to supplement Australia';s existing Special Forces.<br />
The proposal will involve the raising of an additional commando company with its logistics, heavy weapons and communication support along with the raising of a Special Forces Combat Service Support Team.<br />
The Government will also accelerate the purchase of the Additional Troop Lift Helicopters to enable a squadron of helicopters to be based in Sydney. This would provide a potent addition to Australia';s East Coast Special Forces capabilities.<br />
I have also tasked the CDF with developing a separate proposal for the greater involvement of ADF Reserves in the response to domestic terrorist threats or incidents.  Additional training will be given to some elements of the ADF Reserve to prepare them for short notice employment in domestic protective security roles.<br />
Along with delivering this greater capacity, the Government is committed to ensuring the command of our Special Forces ensures the maximum effectiveness of our response to any terrorist threat or incident.<br />
 To that end a new Special Operations Command will be established as a Joint command with a command status equivalent to Maritime, Land and Air Commands.  The new Command will provide better joint, inter agency and alliance co-operation to defeat terrorism in any form.<br />
I am pleased to announce that Brigadier Duncan Lewis has been promoted to Major General and will command the new organisation.  Major General Lewis brings a wealth of experience from his former role as Commander Special Forces.<br />
The Special Operations Command will comprise a joint Headquarters, the Special Air Service Regiment, 4th Battalion the Royal Australian Regiment (Commando), Tactical Assault Groups (West) and (East), 1 Commando Regiment and the Incident Response Regiment.<br />
These new measures underline the Government';s broader commitment to ensure that Australia has all the tools it requires to combat terrorism and other threats to national security.   </p>
