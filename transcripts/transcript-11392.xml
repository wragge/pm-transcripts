    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE....................................................................................................</p>
<p>Thank you very much, Dr Kennedy; to Mrs Yvonne Boyd and the other</p>
<p> members of the Boyd family; to Kerry Stokes, David Gonski, my colleague,</p>
<p> the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley, Gough Whitlam, ministerial</p>
<p> colleagues, friends of the Boyd family, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p>I do feel particularly privileged to have been asked to make a small</p>
<p> contribution as Prime Minister to this very special gathering that</p>
<p> honours a very great Australian. Those words Âgreat Australian'</p>
<p> are used perhaps a little too freely on occasions but in the case</p>
<p> of Arthur Boyd it hardly does justice to the extraordinary impact</p>
<p> that he had on art in this country and the extraordinary impact he</p>
<p> had on the lives of so many that he touched.</p>
<p>Not only did he succeed in giving generations of Australians a new</p>
<p> and different understanding of the Australian landscape and, therefore,</p>
<p> a freer and different way of interpreting the character of our country,</p>
<p> he was also associated with a very vibrant group of artists who collectively</p>
<p> had an extraordinary impact on the artistic life of our nation. And</p>
<p> he belonged, of course, to a very remarkable artistic family, many</p>
<p> of whose members are here today and in their different capacities</p>
<p> and skills have made such a contribution to our lives. But he was</p>
<p> also more than an extraordinarily gifted and skilful artist, he was</p>
<p> also an incredibly gentle and courteous and sensitive man. And he</p>
<p> was also a lover of the Australia that he knew so well and displayed</p>
<p> so well for so many of his fellow countrymen.</p>
<p>He was also a great philanthropist. In many ways he was a role model</p>
<p> for philanthropy in this country. And the gift of the wonderful Bundanoon</p>
<p> property on the Shoalhaven, he saw that as a natural thing and a natural</p>
<p> obligation that he had to his nation and to the community that loved</p>
<p> him so much and the community that he gave so much too. So not only</p>
<p> do we as a nation today honour and thank Boyd for his remarkable talent,</p>
<p> thank providence that he was given to us, that he was an Australian</p>
<p> and that he made an impact on our nation, but we also warmly and sincerely</p>
<p> thank and honour him for his generous spirit and the generosity that</p>
<p> he has displayed through the Bundanoon Trust to the Australian community.</p>
<p>It is appropriate, it is dignified and it is nice in every sense of</p>
<p> the word that we do have an occasion like this appropriately here</p>
<p> in the National Gallery to pause and remark upon a very remarkable</p>
<p> Australian, a very remarkable artistic life and a person, in every</p>
<p> sense of the word, fully qualifies for that most honourable of all</p>
<p> descriptions that any person can have and that is a great Australian.</p>
