TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON. JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
KEYNOTE SPEECH TO THE AUSTRALIAN FOOD COUNCIL<br />
ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING<br />
" SUPERMARKET TO ASIA"<br />
Thank you very much Mr Murray Rogers for your invitation to speak today and for<br />
those very warm introductory remarks. To my Ministerial and other Parliamentary<br />
colleagues and to all of you, good morning and it's a great pleasure to have the forum<br />
of this Council meeting to launch by far the most important initiative of the new<br />
Coalition Government directed towards the long term benefit and the long term<br />
strengthening of rural and regional Australia. As I look around the room, I am<br />
reminded by the presence of a number of people of those who have made a<br />
contribution to the formulation of the Government's thinking in relation to what I am<br />
to launch today. I think of course of the contribution of the food industry, of<br />
individuals in it, of people like Reg Clairs of Woolworths. I think of the massive<br />
contribution of the National Farmers' Federation, represented here today by its<br />
President, Don MeGauchie. I think of the contribution of quite a number of my<br />
Ministerial and Parliamentary colleagues, of John Anderson, of Neil Andrew and of<br />
many of the others, all of whom have played a very significant role in formulating the<br />
Government's thinking.<br />
I think all Australians believe that our food producers are undoubtedly amongst the<br />
most efficient in the world and that we have the natural advantage of producing<br />
products in a relatively clean environment. And that is a proposition that would draw<br />
no dissent from anybody in this room. I think we are overwhelmingly conscious of the<br />
huge opportunities that day by day are developing for propeily targeted exports from<br />
this country to the Asian Pacific region. Everybody recognises the crucial sIgnificance<br />
of that region to Australia's economic and political fu~ ture. It is for that reason of<br />
course, and incidentally the first major visit I will undertake overseas as Prime Minister<br />
wil be to Indonesia arid Japan next week, haviing last week visited the natioirs of the<br />
Pacific region. So in every sens~ e there is a continuity of the commitment of this<br />
T SJ SZ3ir 96/ 60/ ZI waOJiTj Xed </p>
<p>country of economic and political involvement in the Asian Pacific region, an<br />
association commenced many decades ago and continued without serious interruption<br />
or change by Governments of both political persuasion in this country.<br />
So we have together, if you like, together we have the capacity of this country as an<br />
extremely efficient producer of food. We also have it being produced in an extremely<br />
clean environment. We have a huge and growing potential inarket by its sheer size in<br />
the Asian Pacific region, but added to that of course is the rapid development of an<br />
increasingly wealthy middle class in many of the nations of the Asian Pacific region,<br />
and inevitably that will bring forth demand for a greater variety of food, for greater<br />
sophistication in food and therefore almost in the geometric progression, the market<br />
opportunities are going to increase.<br />
So against that background I think what we need to do is to assess what is the task, the<br />
nature of the task required to achieve an additional breakthrough which will be of such<br />
tremendous importance to rural and regional Australia. We produce the food the<br />
region needs and instead of knocking on doors to markets, it's time we took the hinges<br />
off the doors so that neighbouring consumers benefit, our food producers benefit and<br />
Australia as a whole, particularly rural and regional Australia will also benefit. That is<br />
why today I have very great pleasure in launching the Prime Minister's Supermarket<br />
To Asia Council and I believe the outcome of the deliberations and the work of this<br />
council will provide new opportunities and a real focus for the future for rural and<br />
regional Australia.<br />
The Council will bring together Government and industry and other leaders to work<br />
together on removing barriers to greater exports of food products to the region. The<br />
total Asian food market is estimated to be worth $ 685 billion by the turn of the century<br />
with at least 12%, or over $ 83 billion to be met from imports, and this represents a<br />
significant, indeed, huge opportunity for Australia. Producing quality food on our<br />
farms and properties is of course not enough. We then have to get it to markets at a<br />
good price, we have to add value to our raw products and we have to promote what<br />
we produce.<br />
As a sign to the Government's commitment to this process, four other senior ministers<br />
will also be on the Council the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Tim<br />
Fischer-, the Minister for Primary Industry and Energy, John Anderson, the Minister<br />
for Industry, Science and Tourism, John Moore; and the Minister for Transport and<br />
Regional Development, John Sharp. There are a number of very eminent industry<br />
leaders and representatives on the Council. They are Mr Keg Clairs of the Australian<br />
Supermarket Institute; Mr Murr ay Rogers of the Australian Food Council; Mr Don<br />
Mc~ auchie, the President of the National Farmers' Federation, and in addition, Mr<br />
David Mortimer, the Managing Director of the TNT Group; Mlr Garry Ringwood of<br />
AMCOR Ltd; Mr Malcolm Irving of the Australian Horticultural Corporation; and<br />
Mlr George Kailis of the MG Kaiis Group. I also delighted that Mr Joe De Bruyn, the<br />
National Secretary of the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association has<br />
also agreed to join the Council along with Professor Adrienne Clarke, the Chairman of<br />
the CSIRO. 2<br />

<p>I can't think of a more broadly based and a more representative group of people,<br />
representing all of the interests that will come to bear on the very ambitious task that<br />
we are with this announcement today setting ourselves as a Government. When a<br />
Government invests the personal resources of time and commitment of a Prime<br />
Minister, a Deputy Prime Minister and three other senior-Ministers and is able to enlist<br />
the enthusiastic support of industry and trade union leaders and also other people with<br />
expertise to bring to this exciting challenge, then I believe it sends a message to the<br />
whole community and most particularly a message to rural and regional Australia as to<br />
how important we regard putting down long term proposals and presenting a long ternm<br />
focus which over a period of time can regenerate the fortunes and regenerate the future<br />
of that part of Australia. We almost now accept it as part of the daily routine of<br />
talking about Australia's political and economic future, ladies and gentlemen, to talk<br />
about the association that we have with the Asian Pacific region, and the<br />
announcement of this Council today and the coiluitment that it represents by the<br />
Governiment and the commitment, and that will be spoken of in a few moments by<br />
others, the commitment that it represents from industry is a very, very strong earnest<br />
of the long term commitment we have to further interlocking the economic future of<br />
Australia and most particularly rural and regional Australia with the burgeoning wealth<br />
of the Asian Pacific region.<br />
The Government has already committed $ 6 million over three years to increase efforts<br />
to clear quarantine barriers to Australian exports, and in that connection we have<br />
recently signed an agreement with the Philippines that will allow access of Australian<br />
fr-uit previously banned.<br />
Ini launching this Council today and throwing very much to the future and endorsing<br />
the Government's commitment to the goals of gaining much greater access for fresh<br />
and processed food into the Asian Pacific region, I think it's important to remind<br />
ourselves that it's not just a question of promotion, it's not just a question of efficient<br />
farm produce but it is also a question of removing so many of the barriers and so many<br />
of the imposts which hobble an efficiently produced product with intermediate costs<br />
which price that product out of world markets. Many of you around the room,<br />
particularly those of you who represent our rural industries, are aware of the<br />
disabilities, the cost disabilities, under which rural producers in this country have<br />
operated for so long. The heart breaking frustration of knowing that you are an<br />
efficient farner, that you are an efficient producer and that you can get your produce<br />
out of the farm gate and a world competitive price only to have it mugged on the way<br />
to the final point of sale and consumption by the inefficiencies of middlemen, by the<br />
inefficiencies of processing, by an industrial relations system that is antiquated and an<br />
industrial relations system that has added unnecessary costs.<br />
So in launching this Council today 1, of course, underline the importance not only of<br />
the initiative that it represents and the focus on promotion, the focus of taking<br />
advantage of that huge market, but also the ongoing imperative to reduce the costs of<br />
doing business in this country and the ongoing imperative of further micro economic<br />
reform of industrial relations and transport and communications reform.<br />
Mr Chairman, I am really delighted at this initiative which I first publicly outlined<br />
almost a year ago when I addressed the anniual meeting of the National Farmers' 3<br />
E fid SZ: i'T 96/ 60/ zr WOJJ Xpa </p>
<p>Federation here in Canberra as Leader of the Opposition, a proposal that has been<br />
under very close discussion between myself and senior people in the business<br />
community and in the farming organisations, and I'm delighted to have this<br />
opportunity of launching the Prime Minister's Supermarket to Asia Council, of<br />
personally committing the investment of my own time and energy and that of my senior<br />
ministers to achieving the objectives of the Council to thank those industry leaders who<br />
have joined it, to thank Mr De IBruyn, coming as he does of a union background an<br />
impressive national leader of the union movement, and of Professor Clarke of the<br />
CSIRO. It is a marvellous cross section of people with all the skills and all the inputs<br />
that are needed. It is a sign post of the long term commitment and in the long term<br />
dedication of this Government to search for and find fresh initiatives and fresh ways of<br />
revitatising and giving new hope and new encouragement and new inspiration to rural<br />
and regional Australia in a way that is not a short term gimmick that takes advantage<br />
of emerging market opportunities, builds upon the natural strengths of this country<br />
which are efficient to production, a clean environment matching them in the most<br />
appropriate way with the growing market, particularly of the middle class, in the Asia<br />
Pacific region.<br />
And if we can bring all of that together the opportunities for Australia, and particularly<br />
for Australians who live in the rural and regional areas, are really bright indeed. Thank<br />
you very much.<br />
QUESTION: Perhaps I could kick it off, Ern Pope from Nestle Australia. I've got to say I must<br />
congratulate you Prime Minister on pushing through with this initiative and perhaps I<br />
could comment briefly on discussions we've had within the AFC Board as to what we<br />
see as the really key issues here. I guess previously there seemed to be a focus on<br />
communicating the clean and green image of Australia and while this is very important<br />
it really is just a price of entry to many of these markets. Of course we've got to have<br />
food safety issues covered, of course we've got to have all of the various programmes<br />
like ( inaudible) covered right through the supply chain, but it really is only the basis of<br />
entry into these markets and I think many of our customers in Asia reiterate that to us.<br />
What they really care about, once they have a product that's adapted to their tastes,<br />
what they really care about isn't cost competitive. Will it be delivered when we<br />
ordered it, in the quantities that we ordered it and where we want it to be delivered?<br />
This really gets back into the competitiveness issues and I guess, to some extent, the<br />
market access issues. You've addressed that here, all I can say is, we would like some<br />
reassurance that the competitiveness and market access issues will get priority as<br />
opposed to perhaps just trying to promote the clean green image, because that really is<br />
the basic of just getting there in the first place.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I can certainly tell you very directly that they will and the emphasis that I placed in my<br />
speech on continuing efforts at reducing the cost of doing business in this country,<br />
continued efforts for labour market reform, and transport and communications reform.<br />
There are probably many people in this room who in another context or other cunitextS<br />
have heard me repeat the story of the Sizzler chain that was on the verge of buying the 4<br />
1, d SZ: I. T 96/ 60/ ZT WWDJJ J Xpa </p>
<p>American beef, despite the fact that it was 60 per cent dearer off the hoof. But<br />
because of what happened from the farm gate to the point of final sale and<br />
consumption, it ended up that the American product was 40 cents a kilo cheaper than<br />
the Australian product.<br />
Now, that's a parable, if you like, of the competitive disadvantage, through no fault of<br />
their own, often of efficient primary producers in this country. And of all the things<br />
that we want to do as a government, we really place as much importance, if not more,<br />
on doing something about those sort of cost pressures as we do on anything else. And<br />
I totally agree with you that promotion alone is not enough, the clean and green image<br />
is not enough, efficient farm production is not enough because if you are mugged<br />
along the way to the final point of sale by uncompetitive and costly practices, well you<br />
lose the sale and you lose the whole momentum. The goal of a council like this<br />
operating against the background of the Government's welt known commitment to<br />
industrial relations reform, for example, which is a very topical subject at the moment<br />
and one about which most of you have heard me talk repeatedly over the years, and I<br />
know is very dear to the hearts of a lot of people in this room, but operating against<br />
the background of that, this Council brings together people, not only in the food<br />
industry and in the farming community, but also of course people in the transport<br />
industry, which is so very important to the successful achievement of the goals of this<br />
exercise. QUESTION: I should have also emphasised there that I think probably 80 per cent of the work that<br />
needs to be done on our competitiveness resides within the companies in Australia as<br />
well. I think the Government's role here to help free up the flexibility issues must add<br />
to that and allow us to get on with it. The other issue though that I've got to say,<br />
what my Asian customers talk about a lot at the moment is, ' when is the waterfront<br />
going to be taken care of in Australia and should we order up massive amounts now if<br />
it's going be an issue there?' This obviously has to be tackled in a sensitive way, but<br />
tackled it must be. I'm just wondering if there's any comments you'd make on that?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, yes. We, as you know, and John Sharp has spoken about it quite regularly and<br />
I'm very pleased that he's here today. We are very committed to reform of the<br />
waterfront. It must go sequentially with generic reform of the labour market. The key<br />
to waterfront reform is general labour market reform. It is a sensitive issue. We don't<br />
intend to approach it in a needlessly belligerent or confrontational way, but we<br />
recognise that there will be some fundamental changes needed. The costs of<br />
processing exports through the Australian waterfront and imports too, is too high. It<br />
does make much of Australian industry less competitive than it ought to be and many<br />
of the problems lie with the monopoly practices which are the target of Australia's of<br />
the Government's industrial relations reform package.<br />
We hear a lot in economic debate about the undesirability of monopolies and of course,<br />
they are undesirable in commerce, they're also unde~ sirable in other aicas as well.<br />
Monopoly practices in the labour market are costly and anti-competitive, just as<br />
S : BJd SZ31T 96/ 60/ ZI Wo01JJJX Xed </p>
<p>monopoly practices in other fields such as education produce poorer outcomes than<br />
will otherwise be the case. So I can assure you that our commitment to waterfront<br />
reform is very strong, but it is something that is associated with generic reform to the<br />
labour market and will be tackled by us in a firm fashion but in a fashion that's not<br />
designed to be needlessly belligerent or confrontational.<br />
QUESTION; There's no doubt that Asia is a particularly important market sector for Australian food<br />
industries, but there is also a lot of food that's being exported to other parts of the<br />
world at the present moment. Can we expect that the level of support will still be there<br />
from the Government for continued ( inaudible) exports in those parts of the world?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, yes. It should always be, perhaps, understood and perhaps it should be stated<br />
from time to time that the focus on the association with the region does not indicate<br />
for a moment that this Government, or I hope any future government in this country,<br />
ever has an ' Asia only' policy. It's a question always of seizing market opportunities<br />
wherever they arise and it portrays an inadequate understanding of Australia's export<br />
performance and the investment patterns and the investment flows, both 41 and out of<br />
this country, over the last ten years, not to recognise the tremendous opportunities that<br />
exist elsewhere.<br />
I think it's fair to say that the dynamic of change is much stronger in the region. You<br />
have not only the natural momentum of continuous economic growth, which is much<br />
higher than other regions of the world, but you have the structural change which is<br />
occurring with a rapid emergence of a very large middle-class whose capacity and<br />
resources to purchase. Although, 10 per cent of a country is not a very large middleclass<br />
in relative terms, but given the population sizes, they are enormous markets for<br />
Australia. I mean, countries such as Indonesia and Malaysia and India al represent<br />
fuarther purchasing power of their growing middle-class's enormous market<br />
opportunities, and the diversification of taste and diet and so forth that will naturally<br />
come because of those societal changes that have a sort of a multiplier effect on the<br />
opportunities. But none of that means for a moment that we'll lessen the support for<br />
the commitment toward improving market access in other parts of the world. We'll<br />
never stop trying to improve market access into Europe, difficult though that is, but so<br />
many of us have such long memories about that, we'd feel lonely if we still didn't have<br />
that task ahead of us.<br />
QUESTION: Graeme McDougall, Longerlife Vegetarian Products. Mr Prime Minister, we've<br />
benefited over the years with grants from Austrade and I noticed that you've reined<br />
that in some and I think our experience with Austrade is probably common to a lot of<br />
companies around the table. There are some offices that are absolutely delightful to<br />
deal with and they're go, go, and there are others that are just absolutely hopeless. I<br />
wonder whether your government would ever give thought to a little bit of incentive?<br />
9 Bd SZ: iT 96/ 60/ Zr WGOJJJT Xva </p>
<p>We operate that way. Maybe some of the Austrade offices, if they had an incentive<br />
that if they got the market open for you, could do a better job for us.<br />
PRUIE MINISTER:<br />
It's an interesting suggestion. I'd like to think about it. I don't want that to be<br />
suggesting that there are all sorts of environments in different countries, and when you<br />
mention the word incentive, that can have different connotations. Let me think about<br />
that. I mean, we are adopting a quite interesting incentive-driven approach to job<br />
placement. I mean, our program of privatising the job placement mechanism in this<br />
country I think opens up enormously attractive opportunities there and I think we'll<br />
produce far better outcomes than the present system. But I'd like to sink through the<br />
implications of what you've suggested.<br />
