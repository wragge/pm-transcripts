    <content><![CDATA[<p>AU2TMALIAN INT= OF MANAGEMENT<br />TWELFTH GENERAL MANAGEMENT CONFERENCE<br />Hotel Canberra, Canberra, ACT 29 OCTOBER 1970<br />peeh ythe Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton<br />Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen<br />It is not my intention tonight to dwell on election issues. But rather<br />I will talk about some of the developments and some of the challenges that Australia<br />faces and therefore that you and your Institute face. These are the direct concern of<br />management, whether it be management in government which, in terms of economic<br />management, seems to run in tandem with another organisation outside which<br />sometimes makes things diff icult; or management in private industry. The<br />opportunities ahead will only be fully seized and fully utilised by the proper exercise<br />of management in all spheres.<br />And this year, Sir, is an important year. In a sense it is Year Cne<br />Year One of the decade of the Seventies. Sir, those seventies hold for Auztralia<br />more opportunity if we have t1-will to grasp it if we are prepared to put in the<br />effort required to grasp it than ever before in this country and possibly in any other<br />country. We are getting now the people we need to populate the continent. Indeed<br />the results of twenty-five years of immigration 1policy, uncomfortable as it m~ y have<br />been from time to time because immigration policy is inflationary unless you are<br />going to do it the way the United States did in the 1890' s when they shipped peo,' le in<br />and said " Fend for yourself" and we don't but the results of twenty-five years<br />of immigration policy, population-wise, are beginning to pay off.<br />We have discovered here recently, and are still discovering, and will,<br />I am positive in the future, discover more, deposits of. mineral wealth greater ' than<br />our fathers could never have dreamt of and which could well result in our being<br />the envy of the other nations of the world.<br />And, thirdly, we are still creating and attracting, through good<br />management, both governmental and private, capital to keep our people at work, to<br />bring in still more people and to develop those resources we are discovering. And<br />if you cast your minds, not o~ nly over minerals, but over the new industries, such<br />as wood chips, such as fisheries, such as the manufacturing industries which have<br />expanded so greatly, you will, I am sure, have the same concepts as I have of what<br />this country can be turned into by good management. I don't by that mean that labour<br />is not the basis of all production, because it is. But I do mean that no matter what<br />the labo~ ur force in a particular industry, no matter how well and efficiently that force<br />works, the results and the productions from that force will only be fully effective<br />if proper management is brought to bear. And this is why I think the Lstitute is so<br />important. o. v a / 2</p>
<p>All of these things that have happened in Australia, including, Sir,<br />the new developments in education which you referred to, the advanced training for<br />management which I think was generated when I was Minister for Education and<br />Science. All these things have not come about by chance. They have conie about, I<br />think, by reasonably good management at every level and they will be accelerated<br />by that better management at every levol which is the objective of this gathering<br />here today. And as we get bigger, and as we get stronger, as our responsibilities<br />increase, so the demands on management will grow; for just as a new order of<br />schools is going to be required to deal with the technological revolution going on<br />around us now, so we will need a new order of management, highly specialised and<br />highly trained. For this purpose, to help towards this, this proposal for<br />management training was introduced.<br />I do not know, or pretend to say to this Institute, just how this<br />advanced management training should be coiiducted. Most of the argument at the<br />mome-nt is where it should be conducted whether in New South Vkales or in<br />Victoria. That we can leave to one side. We can have a centre of excellence. We<br />neea-not get rid of other good business training schools We cart have two centres<br />of excellence as we grow. The location is not significant. The curricula and<br />the philosophy of approach are, and it may well be that there should be not postgraduate<br />management following directly on from graduate management, but that<br />there should be required an interval of practical experience in the world of business<br />and of commerce. It may b. 3 that there should be required " sandich courses" where<br />for a while a man works in the business world of commerce and industry and then<br />goes to academia and then comes back. Whatever it may be, I do hope, with you,<br />that we will not see from this Institute turned out the theoretical people of whomyou<br />spoke, but the practical people who will require this additional ability in<br />order to i ke the full use of their management potentials. And this is the objective,<br />and this is what you are concerned with and this is what will be worked out in this<br />country as other things are worked out by discussiDn and by experience.<br />Sir, our population now has passed the 12-4 million mark and,<br />continuing my theme of what is possible in this country, our natural growth and<br />migration being at some two p. er cent a year, we, I think, will see, short of war,<br />which I discount a major war an economic depression which I also discount<br />a doubling of our present population by the end of this century. And that is fairly<br />good going, and that will make us by the end of this century a population of the<br />size of Canada today. Sir, there are great prizes, there are great opportunities<br />for service, not only to one's industry but to the nation in which one lives.<br />And this being so, I think there are two questions posed for the future.<br />What kind of a society will it be as it increases in size? And how, then, will we<br />continue to develop it" I am sure that it has the opportunity again given good<br />management to be a society which will provide, to those citizens who malke it up,<br />a better life than any other society in any other country in the world has yet<br />provided. 3</p>
<p>3.<br />There is an oppo~ rtunity to see that the individuals who make a country and<br />who are the most important components of a country, will be given the oyportun ity<br />to develop their own desires, their own aspirations. whether it be to be a top<br />manager of a great firm, whether it be to be an opera singer, whether to be a farmer,<br />whatever it may be, there will, I think, be an opportunity here because I believe we<br />will have the material resources which will enable governments to divert those<br />resources to give opportunities to the citizens of its nation. And this is the sort of sxmiety<br />that I expect we will see in this country in the years ahead.<br />But how then can we provide those material resources* You, Sir, spoke<br />of the theme of this conference as being the outlook for international business for<br />Australia. The outlook for international business for Australia must, in the ultimate,<br />depend on the capacity for Australian industries of all kinds to produce at a cost<br />which will enable that which is produced to be sold in competition overseas.<br />If this is not able to be done, then there is little outlook for the future of<br />international business. If this is done, then the outlook is almost limitless, except<br />of course, when countries suddenly change trade treaties and put impediments in the<br />way of 6a primary produce.<br />But leaving that to one side, Sir, we have not done badly in this country<br />in this field over the last decade. Our rate of inflation has grown at a slower rate<br />than any other significant trading cuuntry but one. But I am sure you will agree with<br />me that it is essential that it should continue to grow at a slower rate, arAd it would<br />be better if it didn't grow at all, cr grow only very little. And the deciding factor<br />in this matter is not entirely gowernmental action but the action of arbitration courts.<br />What ' world destroy, in my view, the opportunity -Zor international businesos in<br />Australia, would be the introduction at this time of a 35-hour week which must either<br />reduce the amount produced for a given sum of money or, if the irlea is to work<br />hours and have five hours' overtime, must produce the same amount of goods at a<br />much greater cost. This we simply cannot afford to do if we are concerned with<br />international business and growth.<br />But there is also the question of national business to be cons-idered and<br />here, I think Australia faces a priblem which in a sense is new, and certainly is<br />greater than it has ever been before. We have had periods in the past when we have had<br />trade recessions, when we have had depressions. But when that has happened in the<br />past, all sections in the community and all kinds of businesses have been affected by<br />that trade recession or by that depression. But today we face a situation where a great<br />segment of Australia, the rural area is, unlike other sections of industry, hit hard by<br />the fact that the world either will not buy what it produces, or will not pay for what<br />it produces the price that is required to allow production to continue. 4</p>
<p>And this is not a matter which just affects the rural sector..... not at all.<br />Because let that sector be affected and it will not be long before all sections are<br />affected. These are the people who buy the machinery, who buy the refrigerators, the<br />motor cars, the trucks, who keep the demand in the country towns for the manufacturers<br />to fulfil. And what happens in that section of this country will inevitably affect all<br />other sections. And so here too, because, in the case of manufacturing industry, what<br />can be sold internally affects the price of what can be sold externally, and therefore<br />international. business here, too, there is a problem which we as a Government<br />will tackle. I think we must tackle it by seeking to help with long-term finance for<br />those who are, in banking terms, worthy of long-term finance, for reconstruction of<br />properties, and with help for those who have to leave a rural industry to establish<br />themselves in other areas. This we can do. But if on that section of industry which<br />cannot pass on any cost increases there is to be imposed again the additional cost of<br />this 35-hour week, then whatever we may do for that industry will not prevent it going<br />to the wall. And if it does, because of what I said, it will affect all industry and<br />international trade. And these things, Sir, I am sure your Institute would have well in<br />mind. Sir, I would finish on this note. If we can restrain the cost of what<br />we produce, if we can restrain any rises, if management will-see that the increases<br />in productivity which management can bring are shared between those who labour<br />and those who provide the capital, if management can see that with costs stable, prices<br />can drop and this is possible if that can be done, then there is, as I said, an<br />almost unlimited prospect for international business from Australia.<br />We will only do it, I think, by keeping the spirit of competition alive<br />and by that I don't mean by allowing laissez-faire to run rampant, but by keeping the<br />spirit of competition alive. I am sure those of you who are in management will<br />agree with me or some of you will that the spirit of competition is a little<br />uncomfortable sometimes for people in private enterprise. Because it is competition<br />it does require harder work, it does require to go out and sell, it does require to<br />make a better product and it is easier and simpler to avoid this if possible by<br />having a merger or by arranging for price controls applying through an industry. This<br />is not what I mean by keeping the spirit of private enterprise alive. But I think<br />there will always be enough individuals in this country who will see that true<br />competition does remain and if it dGes, and if government can be orevented from<br />intervening too much and just provide guidelines, then, again, Sir, this Institute,<br />if it can see that this happens, will have served a great national cause.<br />One more thing. I have opened my mind to you as to what I think<br />is possible for the future of this country, as to the growth which is attainable, as to<br />the riches which are there. I reiterate something that I said perhaps two and a<br />half years ago or more. I want to see as much Australian control as possible of<br />those riches as they grow, of those resources as they are discovered and developed.<br />I can say this now with more confidence, perhaps, than I could before, because<br />before, at once, I was attacked andpeople said, " If you say this, there will be no</p>
<p>capital inflow from overseas. If you say this, it will dry up and there will be no<br />development. But we said it, we said that was what we wanted, and the overseas<br />companies of significance understood that and have responded to it. And then we<br />said we would put down guidelines for borrowing fixed capital inside Australia,<br />and the more Australian equity there is in an enterprise, the more fixed capital will<br />be able to borrow from abroad. And people said, " If you do that, you will<br />, frighten off overseas capital. It is a very skittish animal. It won't come. But we<br />did it and overseas capital has continued to come.<br />Then we thought it would be helpful to do something about con~ vertible<br />notes so that a class of investor who required an income could invest in Australian<br />equity, could invest in Australian companies and change that to equity when the<br />companies were profitable, and that was another step. And the2n we put up and some<br />of the bankers here still don't like it the AJDC, in order to help to see that if<br />capital was able to be borrowed overseas at fixed interest for Australian development<br />it should be done, and then paid off and the development remain in Australian hands.<br />The capital from abroad is still flowing in, in spite of all these steps. And I say<br />this to you. Sir, quite urepentantly, I think they were good steps, I thin-' they<br />were good management and I think that in a few years' time, people will look<br />back and say so, and that there will be more Australian ownership of Australian<br />resources than there otherwise would have been, which in my view i s good<br />management. But ask me back in a few years and see whether you agree w~ ith me on<br />that. For the moment, I agree with you in your objectives and in the way you are<br />seeking to attain them and I thank you for letting me come and talk to you tonight.</p>
