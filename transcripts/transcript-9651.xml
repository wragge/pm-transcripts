SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER; THE HON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
FAREWELL TO THE AUSTRALIA REMEMBERS PILGRIMAGE TO<br />
PAPUA NEW GUINEA, SYDNEY, THURSDAY, 29 JUNE 1995<br />
It Is my very pleasant duty today to farewell men and women from an heroic<br />
generation of Australians who are embarking on a pilgrimage to some of the<br />
sacred sites of our history.<br />
The names of the places to which they are going Kokoda, Milne Bay, Buna,<br />
Gona, Lao, Shaggy Ridge, Sattef berg, Wau, Bougainville and Wewak have a<br />
meaning for Austraflans which will never fade.<br />
They were the battlefields on which these Australians and others like them fought<br />
to save their country and defend democracy against tyranny and cruelty.<br />
Many had already fought In terrible battles In Europe and the Middle East. Many<br />
were very young and scarcely out of school.<br />
They fought with great courage, They defeated an implacable and ruthless<br />
enemy. They fought and won the battles which saved Australia.<br />
That Is why their place In our history is Immovable and indelible.<br />
They are the names which remind us that they were once a generation of men and<br />
women who were prepared to lay down their lives for Australia.<br />
That Is the most profound thing my generation learned, and it will be as profound<br />
to generations of Australians a hundred years from now.<br />
I am very conscious that at times like this we must choose our words carefully.<br />
We cannot pretend to know what you went through fifty years ago, or what your<br />
thoughts are now as you return to the battlefields. </p>

We were never tested as you were. We don't know if we would have come<br />
through as you did.<br />
But we do know from your example what bravery means.<br />
We know from you what it means to love Australia.<br />
Because of you we know better the value of democracy, peace and freedom.<br />
So today we give thanks to you and all the others you are representing on this<br />
journey. We give thanks not only to the fighting men, but the women who served: those of<br />
the Australian Women's Army Service, those who nursed the wounded, allithose<br />
women who gave their energies to the war effort at home.<br />
And we acknowledge those whose husbands did not return. Some of those<br />
women are making this pilgrimage.<br />
Today we recognise the labours of the Australians who provided the supplies, food<br />
and equipment needed to support the 200,000 Australians who served In New<br />
Guinea and the surrounding Islands.<br />
We pay tribute to the men and women of the Royal Australian Navy and the<br />
Merchant Navy who between them transported over 450,000 people to Papua New<br />
Guinea between 1941 and 1945.<br />
We also recognise the support given to Australians by the people of Papua New<br />
Guinea and the Islands.<br />
Their courage and compassion itself forms a legendary part of our history.<br />
Of the many things to be leamed from World War Two, none was more important<br />
than the need to work closely and harmoniously with our neighbours In the region.<br />
To continue to build a secure and prosperous future with them, and to maintain the<br />
peace and protect the environment we all share, Is a duty we owe to the war-time<br />
generation. So Is building a modem, prosperous, self-reliant Australia our duty to them our<br />
greatest duty.<br />
Because that is what they did. Those who returned took up their lives again and<br />
went back to work. And by their efforts their ambitions for themselves, their<br />
families, their communities, and their country they made Australia stronger. </p>

They made this a place where ambitions could flourish and enterprise be<br />
rewarded. They also made It a place In which the tradition of the fair go lived on,<br />
and the Idea of supporting each other through good times and bad remained a<br />
defining element of the national character.<br />
They made a mighty contribution to Australia, and here today and throughout this<br />
year we pay tribute to them.<br />
We have a lot to thank them for and a lot to live up to.<br />
It is my great privilege, then, on behalf of Australians everywhere, to wish<br />
everyone of you a marvellous and rewarding journey,<br />
Thank you. </p>
