    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE...............................................</p>
<p>  MILNE:</p>
<p>  Prime Minister, thanks for your time. Only hours before Peter Costello</p>
<p>   brought down his Budget, you briefed your MPs to stand by for an</p>
<p>   early election. Why did you do that?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  It's just a normal precaution. You just want them to be ready.</p>
<p>   This has been a very important Budget for the future of Australia</p>
<p>   and I wanted to put the whole thing into proper context.</p>
<p>  MILNE:</p>
<p>  Well, you are obviously happy to fight an election on the Budget...</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  We won't be going to the polls until we've unveiled our</p>
<p>   tax package.</p>
<p>  MILNE:</p>
<p>  But the implication of your remarks is that it could be before the</p>
<p>   end of the year.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Oh, anything's possible after the first of July, but I don't</p>
<p>   think anybody should jump to conclusions just because I say "be</p>
<p>   ready" that it's going to happen tomorrow. It won't</p>
<p>   be happening tomorrow and there'll be quite some time to elapse</p>
<p>   yet before the election takes place.</p>
<p>  MILNE:</p>
<p>  Well, just mentioning the tax package, the Budget's going to</p>
<p>   be through by June hopefully. Does that mean that we can look forward</p>
<p>   to the tax package around July?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  I don't want to get into timing. The Treasurer and I have done</p>
<p>   a lot of work. The broad architecture is there, but we still have</p>
<p>   quite a distance to go and a lot more work to be done. But it will</p>
<p>   be a very good package, a very comprehensive one, it will contain</p>
<p>   significant personal tax cuts for families.</p>
<p>  MILNE:</p>
<p>  You've achieved a surplus in the Budget, but let's look</p>
<p>   at the costs for a second. Cuts to services, cuts to the CES, childcare</p>
<p>   and the like, hospitals. Has the pain been worth the gain?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, look at the enormous gains. Look at the lower interest rates.</p>
<p>   $3,800 a year saving for the average family. $320 off the average</p>
<p>   loan. The equivalent of a $100 a week payrise from the boss. I think</p>
<p>   the gains out of having a surplus are enormous.</p>
<p>  MILNE:</p>
<p>  You've mentioned that your tax package is going to offer big</p>
<p>   personal tax cuts. Will it also do something to re-establish the</p>
<p>   services that have been cut? Will you be using some of the revenue</p>
<p>   to do that?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, that's a separate issue, the question of the social bonus.</p>
<p>   We are yet to make a decision on that, but I don't believe</p>
<p>   that any of the changes that we've made in the first two budgets</p>
<p>   were unreasonable. I think we still retain very high quality services.</p>
<p>   Our health offer to the States involves a 15% real increase over</p>
<p>   five years and we've maintained very strong support for spending</p>
<p>   on schools. They've been completely untouched. So the basics</p>
<p>   have been untouched by our cost cutting.</p>
<p>  MILNE:</p>
<p>  Gareth Evans has now admitted that Labor left you a $10.5 billion</p>
<p>   deficit.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  He's admitted that we were left in debt.</p>
<p>  MILNE:</p>
<p>  The point I wanted to make to you though, is that when you were</p>
<p>   Treasurer, you also left the Hawke Government with the same problem.</p>
<p>   What's the difference?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, there was a difference. And there was an enormous difference</p>
<p>   and in the case of Mr Evans, the significance is that Mr Beazley</p>
<p>   has been denying it for the past two years, and Mr Evans has pulled</p>
<p>   it right from under his feet.</p>
<p>  MILNE:</p>
<p>  There's not much hope for the jobless in this Budget. You're</p>
<p>   forecasting lower growth, but you are also forecasting an increase</p>
<p>   in employment. That's an heroic assumption isn't it?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  I don't think any of the assumptions in the Budget are anything</p>
<p>   other than conservative and the best thing that we can do for the</p>
<p>   jobless is to keep interest rates down and that means a healthy</p>
<p>   surplus and it means not letting Mr Beazley put interest rates up</p>
<p>   again with his spending policies. Business will invest in a climate</p>
<p>   of low interest rates and business will employ people in a climate</p>
<p>   of low interest rates. We have created</p>
<p>  280 000 new jobs in the last two years. That's not a bad achievement.</p>
<p>  MILNE:</p>
<p>  Prime Minister, thank you.</p>
