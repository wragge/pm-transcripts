PhIVIE MINISTER<br />
E. O. E. PROOF ONLY<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW, TERRY WILLESEE, 19 SEPTEMBER 1985<br />
WILLESEE: Well, the tax changes have been quite a bold. move<br />
by the Government. Arid, as we suggested last night, carried<br />
out at a somewhat calculated political risk. But the Hawke<br />
Government has done it. Mr Prime Minister, thanks for joining<br />
US. PM: MY pleasure, Terry.<br />
WILLESEE: Any reservations tonight.<br />
PM: No, no reservations, Terry. I think that we have gone<br />
through a long period now where we have met our commitment to<br />
the Australian people to calk with them, listen to them. And<br />
I think that the tax package that was brought down, Terry, meets<br />
their requirements of fairness. They want a fairer go, arid<br />
they are going to get it. The capacity for government now to<br />
give significant tax cuts back to people comes from getting<br />
. the money from those who have been avoiding and evading. The<br />
only people in Australia tonight who will by happy I will<br />
have to correct myself, who will be unhappy are those who<br />
haven't been paying their share. The fact that we will get<br />
it from them means that your ordinary viewer is going to be<br />
better off.<br />
WILLESEE: What do you think is being said about the Hawke Goverrm. ent<br />
in company boardrooms across Australia?<br />
PM: I think generally there will be good things being said,<br />
because, under the Hawke Government we have restored the profit<br />
level by something like $ 6-7 billion the percentage was 12%<br />
of the national. income that they got. It is now up to historical!,<br />
high levels. Now, that is as a result of our policies. We<br />
are taking very little from them, but at the same time as we<br />
are taking some things from them in the fringe benefits area,<br />
we are giving them somnethinq that 30 years of conservative governrmie',.<br />
never gave them, and which they regarded as intrinsically impor.-tarz<br />
that is full imputation. There is now an end to the double<br />
taxation of dividends. That is very important to them. </p>
<p>WILLESEE: Mr Hawke, there has been some suggestion that the<br />
restaurant trade will suffer as a result of some of the decisions<br />
today. Do you believe that will in fact happen?<br />
PM: Well, I think that some, there may be some adverse impact<br />
in some areas because with the cutting out of the expense allowances,<br />
that means that there probably won't be the same propensity in some<br />
areas. But I think that gradually people will adjust to it to the<br />
extent that companies want to entertain and so on. They will pick<br />
up the expense. But I simply say this, that if you are going to<br />
bring in fairness for the great bulk of Australian taxpayers, I<br />
think they take the view that they, the ordinary taxpayer, shouldn't<br />
be paying for yours and my meal in a restaurant if it has been paid<br />
out of an expense account.<br />
WILLESEE: Also been suggested, Mr Hawke, that jobs will be lost.<br />
Is that a reality in the restaurant trade or do you think that<br />
is just part of the game?<br />
PM: WEll, what I am saying is that I and my Government have a<br />
responsibility for the whole economy. We have produced record<br />
employment growth because we have the right range of economic<br />
policies. Now, a proper taxation policy is part of the whole<br />
range of economic policies, is going to mean more sensible resource<br />
allocation. You haven't had proper investment decisions being made<br />
in this country, Terry, because there have been quite distorted<br />
incentives as to where you invest. Now there is going to be much<br />
more incentive for people to invest in shares.<br />
WILLESEE: Yes, but Mr Hawke, I am talking about the by-product<br />
of your tough decisions. Mightn't there be people who will lose<br />
their jobs as an indirect result of decisions you have taken today.<br />
PM: There could be some loss of employment in the restaurant area,<br />
I have tried to avoid that.<br />
WILLESEE: Have you calculated a percentage of job loss?<br />
PM: There has been no calculation. But what we have calculated<br />
is that a result of the putting of more money into the hands of<br />
a wide range of people, they are going to have the capacity to<br />
spend more, the levels of consumption shoul * d generally rise so<br />
that the overall employment impact of this tax change will be<br />
very positive.<br />
WILLESEE: Mr Hawke, you have promised no capital gains tax, now<br />
we have it. Prior to the last election your government went, and<br />
Mr Keating went very quiet on refusing to confirm or deny there would<br />
be a capital gains tax. Now we have it. Have we been deceived?<br />
PM: Terry, I don't know whether you have been watching another<br />
program earlier this evening, but you seem, you are terribly close<br />
to making the same mistake of another bloke with a similar name to<br />
yourself. I said in 1983, in the election campaign of 1983, no<br />
capital gains tax. And that was for that period of governmnent that<br />
I was going to the people on tl on. And we kc,, t that. We to.<br />
look we are going to have tliis cer t,, 4 ty. We have glot to tje. t<br />
the business of turning this economy around. We did. We introducedl<br />
no capital gains tax. 1 said when I went to the last election, </p>
<p>PM cont: look we have done all these things. We have turned the<br />
economy around to the point where it is the best growing economy<br />
in the western world. We have now got to approach the whole question<br />
of taxation and made it perfectly clear when I went to the people<br />
last time that all elements of tax, including capital gains tax,<br />
would be on the table. And let me say the capital gains tax which<br />
has been introduced is an eminently fair one. It doesn't apply to<br />
any existing asset, no existing asset will attract it. Secondly,<br />
it will only be on real gains.<br />
WILLESEE: Is there not a chance however as a result of that capital<br />
gains tax, that in fact a death duty will come into effect?<br />
PM: Absolutely not. Because the deeming a death proposition which<br />
was contained in the. White Paper has been taken out. There is no<br />
death duty element of this capital gains tax.<br />
WILLESEE: fiNS anyone in your Party said to you that the changes<br />
you have made are so radical that it may cost you votes and even<br />
power at the next election?<br />
PM: There has been some concern earlier, in some quarters. I can<br />
say that now that the people in-the Party have seen the whole of the<br />
package, and they weren't able to see it, there were some elements<br />
of it that you couldn't go to, they just had to be told today before<br />
we went into the Parliament.<br />
WILLESEE: Do you now have complete support?<br />
PM: I think there is complete support. There may be some people<br />
that will have some concerns about particular parts of it and say<br />
that part will need a bit more selling than others. But my impression<br />
is that now that they have seen the whole of it they think it is a<br />
proper and fair and saleable package.<br />
WILLESEE: Do you believe you will get the support of the Democrats<br />
in the Senate on this?<br />
PM: Well, I had the opportunity just before coming into the<br />
studio of looking at the press release put out by Senator Chipp<br />
on behalf of the Democrats and it is a very welcoming statement.<br />
He points to some areas that they will want to talk to us about.<br />
And of course we will want to talk with them.<br />
WILLESEE: You have no doubt made some enemies amongst the<br />
voters in the electorate. Do you think they will still remember<br />
this day come election time?<br />
PM: I hope they do. Because come election time they will see this<br />
as the most sweeping, fairest, most equitable tax reform in their<br />
memory and they will be able to test that decision iri the context<br />
of our whole economic policy which has produced a situation : here<br />
Australia's economic performance is the envy of the rest of -the<br />
world. And that has been translated already into 430,000 new jobs.<br />
By the time we go to the next election, it will be infinite&gt; he.<br />

bc able to keep much more of the extra dollar that they cari.,<br />
that they the ordinary taxpayer are not going to be paying f'or<br />
the free lunch of a whole range of the more privileged peop_,.-<br />
They are going to remember those things. And they are goinl -to<br />
be thankful for them.<br />
WILLESEE: Mr Hawke, thank you very much for talking to us tonight. </p>
<p>4.<br />
WILLESEE: Well as you are aware it wasn't just tax changes that<br />
were announced in Canberra today. It was confirmed we will all<br />
be issued with identity cards, it will be called the Australia<br />
Card. It will come into effect from March 1987. Today we<br />
sought the view of privacy committee, the NSW Privacy Committee<br />
gentleman, Mr Jim Nolan, and we will hear his comments and then<br />
seek the reaction of the Prime Minister who is still with us.<br />
Well, Jim Nolan, like it or not we now have an<br />
ID card, even it is without a photograph on it. Are we about to<br />
enter the era of big brother in Australia.<br />
NOLAN: Well, we think so. We have said 4rom the start that the<br />
issue of an identifying number raises serious privacy implications<br />
and that is why we are concerned that it has come up in the context<br />
of the tax debate. WE think it should have been considered quite<br />
separate and distinct from tax or any one particular other issue.<br />
It requires separate consideration because it is so important an<br />
issue. wiaLL-SE 6-We are now going to be anumber. We are not going to<br />
have a photograph. Where is the real danger? Where do you think<br />
the real danger area lies?<br />
NOLAN: WEll the basic significance of the proposal was always the<br />
number more so than the photograph. The real danger lies now in the<br />
fact that the number facilitates massive computer matching across<br />
a government and private sector records and we have said, again from<br />
the start that that raises serious problems of surveillance of<br />
the population in the absence of appropriate safeguards. In<br />
the United States for example, there is a positive obligation on<br />
the bureaucracy to notify the citizens of the way they are using<br />
personal information with these computer matching programs and the<br />
like. Now on the basis of what is proposed here so far, for the ID<br />
proposal, there is no similar proposal up before the Government as<br />
we understand it. And I would have thought that would have been<br />
at least the bottom line for any consideration of the way the<br />
system would work in practice.<br />
tILLESC-. The thoughts of the NSW Privacy.. Committee. Well Mr<br />
HawKe you heard those comments. What do you have to say about them?<br />
PM: I have this to say, very clearly and specifically. The<br />
question was asked where is the danger in the Australia Card.<br />
And the danger is very clearly identifiable. The danger is for<br />
those who have been into tax fraud and social welfare fraud. Because<br />
the purpose of this card is to stop people rorting the system and<br />
cheating on the system in terms of tax and in terms of those<br />
people who have been getting millions of dollars, hundreds of<br />
millions of dollars for unemployment benefits and other social<br />
welfare payments through fraud. That is where the danger is for<br />
those people. It is calculated that when the system is fully in<br />
operation it will.* mean another $ 540 million going into the rev~ an-z7<br />
frcom peop. le w~ ho 1-a\ C ch' 2, atod. That J-, 4 r Y wl* r<br />
Nr Nolarn ought to what ho is 1--L " bt i ._ tis<br />
danger is. And it will be limited strictly under the legisiation to<br />
the purposes to avoid that fraud that has been taking place onl tbc-.-<br />
revenue and in the outlay side. Now that is thle situation and 1<br />
would suggest if I could put to you the question, don't you think<br />
it is fair to have an Australia Card in this circumstance. </p>
<p>* WILLESEE: Yes. I have no worries at all about the Australia<br />
Card. I think it is a good idea. There are those who don't<br />
think it is a good idea. There are those who think there are<br />
insufficient safeguards. ARe there sufficient safeguards.<br />
PM: Yes, Terry. And I can assure you that in the drawing up<br />
of the decisions in regard to this matter we have very properly<br />
taken into account the concerns of those people who are worried<br />
properly about civil liberties. It will only be relevant to the<br />
areas of employment, certain financial and other transactions<br />
relating to tax and in regard to welfare payments. For those<br />
three areas and nowhere else.<br />
WILLESEE: How do you feel about being given a number?<br />
PM: I have no worries about being given a number because I am<br />
like you and like the overwhelming majority of our fellow Australians.<br />
We are honest. And if the provision of a number is going to mean<br />
that there is $ 540 million of revenue coming from those who have<br />
cheated on the system which means one of two things. Less pressure<br />
upon the honest taxpayers, a greater capacity for government to<br />
look after the community, the honest community. Then if that means<br />
that I have got to have a number, then that is something that Io,-v<br />
not only not worried about, but it is something that I would<br />
positively welcome. As I am glad to say you obviously do.<br />
WILLESEE: Mr Hawke, the Treasurer said in his speech that the<br />
ID card would be needed to perform certain financial transactions.<br />
What sort of financial<br />
PM: Just let me give you an example. One of the great difficulties<br />
in the tax collection area has been a matching up, Terry, between<br />
company returns where they indicate interest payments or<br />
dividend payments and then matching up the name " SMith" or<br />
" Jones" that is on that area of income that is going to someone<br />
and then matching with Mr Smith, Mr Jones. Now under the system<br />
of having the Australia Card, that will mean that that matching<br />
up will be infinitely easier. And so that those people who have<br />
been receiving income but not paying tax on it will now not be<br />
in that privileged position. And I believe that the overwhelming<br />
majority of Australians believe that that is something that ought<br />
to happen.<br />
WILLESEE: Mr Hawke, thanks for talking to us and thanks for staying<br />
for the extra..<br />
PM: My pleasure.<br />
