It is a pleasure to be here for the opening of the 2011 Commonwealth Business Forum in Perth.</p>
<p>This Forum is an important member of the Commonwealth family.</p>
<p>And it's great to be able to welcome you as friends to our country.</p>
<p>We meet at a time of challenge and opportunity.</p>
<p>At a time of transformation as the economic and political weight of our world shifts from West to East.</p>
<p>Over the past two decades alone, China and India have almost tripled their share of the global economy.</p>
<p>This transformation is affecting us all, big and small, poor and wealthy.</p>
<p>It matters for Australia and I am determined our nation makes the most of this, the Asian century.</p>
<p>But other parts of the world are growing quickly too.</p>
<p>Africa is home to one billion people and already has an extraordinary story of growth to tell.</p>
<p>One day perhaps we will talk of an African century too.</p>
<p>Ghana's economy, for example, is over 9 times larger than it was 30 years ago and Botswana's is over 16 times larger.</p>
<p>Both countries have enjoyed average growth rates of 8 to 10 per cent, rivalling those of some of their Asian counterparts.</p>
<p>Sub-Saharan Africa as a whole is expected to grow by 5.3 per cent this year and 5.8 per cent next year, well over twice the pace of the developed world.</p>
<p>I heard something of this story in my meeting yesterday with the Commonwealth Business Council.</p>
<p>They project that Commonwealth investment flows are expected to reach $220 billion in 2015, more than double the level of 1997.</p>
<p>Commonwealth trade is expected to triple in value over the same timeframe.</p>
<p>Our friends in the Business Council call it the "Commonwealth factor", the web of connections, friendships and values that drives opportunity among the 54 nations of our fellowship.</p>
<p>It is a story of growth that resonates so greatly here in this dynamic metropolis of Perth.</p>
<p>This city that looks so optimistically to the nations of Asia and Africa to our north and west.</p>
<p>It is a city where introspection and gloom are seldom entertained.</p>
<p>But it must be admitted that the story of growth I just described is tempered by considerable uncertainty and risk.</p>
<p>As a measure of the challenges we face, consider these facts:</p>
<p>The IMF has spoken of a âdangerous new phaseâ in the global economy.</p>
<p>The Bank of England chief Sir Mervyn King has talked of a decline that could be even worse than the Great Depression if events get out of control.</p>
<p>And the International Labor Organization records a human tragedy of 200 million people without a job around the world.</p>
<p>Uncertain times.</p>
<p>Threatening times.</p>
<p>So we look to the world for action.</p>
<p>We look to the United States to support President Obama's jobs package, while charting a path towards fiscal consolidation in the medium term.</p>
<p>We look to our friends in the big emerging economies, including China, to rebalance their economies towards domestically driven growth and market-driven interest and exchange rates.</p>
<p>But our deepest uncertainty comes from Europe.</p>
<p>All of us as Commonwealth member nations stand to suffer if the correct response is not forthcoming:</p>
<p>Those of us in Commonwealth countries who have worked so hard to maintain prudent financial oversight and balanced growth.</p>
<p>Those of us who have worked so hard, especially in Africa, to boost governance, democracy and the rule of law.</p>
<p>Those of us who rely upon the flow of remittances from our workers abroad to sustain our economies at home.</p>
<p>It's time for Europe to respond.</p>
<p>And yet global financial markets continued to fluctuate as we watch for a convincing plan from the second European leaders' summit on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Yes, we acknowledge the steps Europe has taken and how painful they have been.</p>
<p>But much more needs to be done, and needs to be done fast.</p>
<p>European leaders will need to stabilise the situation by resolving sovereign debt issues and ensure there are adequate safeguards to avoid contagion.</p>
<p>Europe also needs to ensure that its private banks are adequately capitalised to ensure stability and growth.</p>
<p>This is no time for delay.</p>
<p>This is the message I will take to the G20 summit in Cannes in nine days time.</p>
<p>G20 leaders will need to strike the right balance between addressing short-term risks and pledging reforms that promote growth into the future.</p>
<p>Australia has long been a vocal advocate for structural economic reforms on a global scale.</p>
<p>That is why I have written to the French President and 2011 G20 chair, Mr Nicolas Sarkozy, urging decisive action in Cannes.</p>
<p>The G20 Action Plan will need to outline the commitments and measures required to achieve stronger economic growth. </p>
<p>The G20 also needs a strong development agenda, particularly in areas such as food security, infrastructure and remittances.</p>
<p>The crisis in the Horn of Africa reminds us of the urgency of addressing the challenge of global food security, and Australia supports a comprehensive approach.</p>
<p>We need concrete initiatives for improving productivity, market transparency and crisis management.</p>
<p>I will also be advocating strongly for G20 leaders to commit to reducing the costs of sending remittances.</p>
<p>The needs of the developing world must be central to the G20 agenda, not something peripheral or remote.</p>
<p>So friends, for all of you who do business within the Commonwealth  -  and those of us in government who support you  -  these are critical days.</p>
<p>Challenging times for Europe and the world.</p>
<p>Times in which we must prove ourselves equal to the task.</p>
<p>It's a great opportunity for the G20 to once again play a decisive role in shaping our response to the global economic situation.</p>
<p>And remember one-quarter of the G20's members are also Commonwealth members, so we have a real voice.</p>
<p>Like 2008, we face a moment of choice that requires absolute clarity of thought and action to keep the global economy from slipping backwards into a new crisis and to build the foundations of sustainable growth through partnership and reform.</p>
<p>The road to recovery will not be easy but I remain optimistic.</p>
<p>I believe that world leaders have understood the most fundamental lesson of the Global Financial Crisis:</p>
<p>That in this interconnected world, economic problems do not begin and end at national borders.</p>
<p>So we must not only meet our current challenges.</p>
<p>But ensure the next phase of world growth is very different to the last:</p>
<p>Greater balance and less debt.</p>
<p>More investment in the drivers of human capital like skills and health care.</p>
<p>Rebuilding our cities and our infrastructure.</p>
<p>Freer trade and fewer barriers.</p>
<p>Less attention to creating exotic financial products and more to creating the goods and services that sustain real growth.</p>
<p>Above all, making the transition to a clean energy future that is the only way we will avoid the disastrous consequences of global warming.</p>
<p>Of course, you already know all these things: they are the very topics that form the agenda for this Forum.</p>
<p>Now I know you've all come to Perth with your sleeves rolled up, ready to strike deals and form new business partnerships.</p>
<p>And I would simply say: Go for it.</p>
<p>Seize the moment.</p>
<p>With 1200 participants, 16 heads of government and 150 business leaders here in Perth, you'll never have a better time.</p>
<p>As you network and deal, let me just leave you with the assurance that my fellow leaders and I will be fighting for youat the G20 and beyond.</p>
<p>Fighting to build a world where those of you in business, who work hard, innovate and take risks - have the best possible chance to succeed, create wealth  and foster jobs and opportunity for the people of the Commonwealth.</p>
<p>With these thoughts in mind, I wish you every success in your deliberations.</p>
<p>I look forward to meeting with you at tonight's dinner and the roundtable on Thursday.</p>
<p>And I take great pleasure in declaring the 2011 Commonwealth Business Forum open. </p>
