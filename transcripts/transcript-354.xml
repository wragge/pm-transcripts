N SPEECH BY iHE PRIME MINISTEi, THE RT. HON.<br />
R. G. MENZIES AT' MAITLAND TO. IN HALL, ON<br />
TUESAY 8 1 AUGUSL1961<br />
Mr. M1' ayor, Mr. Fairhall, parliamentary colleagues and ladies and<br />
gentlemen: I have spoken in this hall a fair number of times and I<br />
don't remember a meeting like this beKore: on other occasions it<br />
has been rather exciting. ( Laughter) YouI know it usually has<br />
boon at election time and oddly enotgh at election time I<br />
encounter quite a number of people who don't sooeem to care for me<br />
very much. My mind goes back to one time oh, this mooting is<br />
not like it when we wore having a moeting here in Decumber and<br />
it was very hot and we had had a long hot day. I was being<br />
" cartod around" if I may put it that -ay, by Allen Fairhall: we<br />
had mado speeches here and theiro; we had fought with wild<br />
beasts at Ephesus if I may put it in that fashion; and we<br />
ended up with a very spirited meeting here. Uhon it was all over<br />
I was so hot that I was about to melt and I had to get out into a<br />
little economical car that he was driving and be driven to<br />
Newcastle and the choice w-as between being stifled and getting<br />
pneumonia. I opened the window and got pneumonia. ( Laughter)<br />
It's as simole as that. I wasn't able to go on in the campaign<br />
for another four or five days. And the result, I don't need to<br />
.6ell you was that we had a record majority. ( Laughter)<br />
But tonight is something of an experiment ' bcause I<br />
suppose that six months Qgo a great number of people in<br />
Australia had never heard the blessed words " the Coixion Market";<br />
and as I have had something to do with thera over a fai yea. rs now,-<br />
nd as tohe matter now begins to como to a head, I thought that it<br />
night be an extremonly useful thing to say to thos. e who are<br />
affectod by those matters, something of what they are about. So<br />
I warn you this is not . oing to be a very controversial<br />
political spooch. If you foel that it is bocoming a litlo dull,<br />
you have my perfect permission to make a rude interjection.<br />
( Laughter) Then we will got back again.<br />
The words " Conmon 1Marke) t" are now filiar in our mouths.<br />
They are obviously not very oll unde: rstood by e.. verybody because<br />
I have heard in the last wouk or two earnest people 1Jhy<br />
don't we h-vo an Asian Coin'en Mrket?" or " dhy don't we have a<br />
Pacific Common Market?", . s a sort of counter-blast to a<br />
European Common Market. Therofo:. thin, perhaps I ought to<br />
begin by getting ri ght down to brass tacks on this matter ) nd<br />
saying what a European Cnomon Markot neans. Life bucones a little<br />
complex at this point because some people will talk about the<br />
European Coummn Market and s: enc, with equal accuracy, about the<br />
European Economic Comunity, and sone about the Meossina powers,<br />
and some about the Treaty of Rome. All the szeo thins, you will<br />
be happy to know.<br />
that happened was that in March, 1957, six European<br />
nations signed a T1reaty . with each other at Roiie hence the<br />
Treaty of Rome. And the six wero Gnrany, France, Italy and what<br />
we call the Benelux countries, BoiunL the Netherlands and<br />
Luxobourg. A group of fairly small nations on the ust coast of<br />
Europe and France, Ger:. any and Italy. And at that ti. o the<br />
United Kingdor. declined to be in the party. Argunoents woere put<br />
to and fro -s to , rhethe:-perhaps Greunt Britain shi-uldn't be one<br />
of what would then be sjvon; whcther she shouldn't comne in on<br />
the around floor, and negotiate herself for a Troaty whether<br />
that turned out to be the 2reaty of RoEi or not. Å he British<br />
Governo: ont of the clay decidod not to. dell today, soine four<br />
yVars latu four and a half years later, they have decided to<br />
no gtiato to go in. But what I want you to recebor is that at<br />
that time they decided to stay out. </p>
<p>Now what was the object of this Treaty of Romn? It is a<br />
very ronarkable story because at the beoginning of 1957 France was<br />
in very poor shape, ocononically and politically. o, perhaps,<br />
have forgotten that until Dc Gaullo ca: noe long as President and<br />
gave stability to French governomnt they used to change their<br />
Prime Ministers every six weoks or at the outside, every six<br />
months. I know riany of you would think that an admirable idea.<br />
( Laughter) Sometimes I think so myseif. But it wasn't until De<br />
Gaulle came along that they had stability of Government.<br />
xeonomically they were in a very poor way in 1956. Germany was<br />
strong, not as strong as she is now, but had groim strong in the<br />
years that had occurred since the war. And the six of thon got<br />
together for reasons that I want you to have very clearly in<br />
nind, and they made a Treaty about it it's a large thick<br />
docunent. But it repays a lot of exarination. I am just going<br />
to toll you the essence of it.<br />
They decided that they would establish a Common Market,<br />
moaning by that that after a period of years which boean by being<br />
12 and right be a little more, but looks like being a little<br />
less, but over a ' eriod of years, a short period of yoers, they<br />
would achieve, as between thenselves, complete internal free<br />
trade; and as between all of then and the rest of the world a<br />
con.: on external customs barrier.<br />
Now you see what this means? This cmans that the six<br />
nations in Europe were setting out to put themselves in a<br />
position, in relation to Europe, similar to that which is<br />
occupied by the United States of America in its own country:<br />
internal free trade and a common external custor. s barrier. And<br />
the advantages that they saw in this, of course, were very great.<br />
It meant that overy nation, Germany, France, Italy, whatever it<br />
night be, would have unrestricted access to the raw naterials of<br />
the others; it meant that France, which is a great wheat<br />
producing country, could sell wheat into any of the other<br />
countries without duty; it meant that raw materials for<br />
manufacturing could be moved without duty from one country to<br />
another; it meant a completely free interchange of labour, and a<br />
completely free movement of capital. In other words these six<br />
nations, including within themselves, many scors of millions of<br />
people, an enormous industrial and agricultural strength, were to<br />
become, cconorically, one co: nunity.<br />
Now the moi: mnt that happened we became extremely<br />
interested in Australia. I will develop for you, in a moment, the<br />
reasons why. But before I do I just want to elaborate on this<br />
Common Market, this economic corimunity, because if, and when<br />
Great Britain joins it, no doubt the Scandinavian countries would<br />
then join also, and you must realise that this is going to<br />
represent an economic cormmunity of 250 million people, much<br />
greater than the United States, greater than the Soviet Union,<br />
And not a weak coumunity, in economic terms, because it contains<br />
some of the groatest industrial power anywhere in the world.<br />
So the first thing to aim at was a customs union with,<br />
in due course, internal free trade. The second was to try to<br />
have a cmmon agricultural policy. All those are set out in the<br />
Treaty. They haven't yet worked out their comi: mon agricultural<br />
policy. They were cdue to have a meeting about it beforc the end<br />
of this year. And I think that one of the reasons why the<br />
British Government has announced its intention to noeotiate is<br />
that it wants to be in a p: sition to negotiate about the cormon<br />
agricultural policy and I think that is v. y good, very good.<br />
Beoc. use if the six negotiate a common agricultural policy I would<br />
be fearful, myself, as to . what the results night be. In these<br />
European countries, for rasons that one can understand,<br />
historically, reasons of war and threatened starvation in tine of<br />
war, they have adopted a policy of agricultural protectionism, </p>
<p>bolstering up the production from their own soil by subsidies,,<br />
by certain price arrangements, by whatever it nay be, in order<br />
that they ray provide as much of their own foodstuffs as they can<br />
In point of view of world economics, not a very good thing; and<br />
fron our point of view not a vry good thing. But that is what<br />
they were aiming at in the Treaty of Rome when they established<br />
the Conmon Market.<br />
Now as to the present position in Europe let us<br />
consider, for example, the question of wheat. In Germany they<br />
produce wheat in the mst inofficio.. t fashion. You know we are<br />
rather accustomed to think that the Germans are the model of<br />
efficiency for everything. But they are not. They grow wheat<br />
in little plots; their methods of wheat agriculture would make<br />
any wheat farmor in Australia snile. But they do it in order to<br />
produce as much cf their own food as they can. And in France<br />
they have so encouraged the production of wheat that at this very<br />
moment they have an exportable surplus. They look across the<br />
Channel to Great Britain and they see there a market for their<br />
own type of wheat, for their surplus of their own type of wheat.<br />
Again if Great Britain goes into this Common Market, Denmark<br />
will go in and Denmark is a groat producer of dairy products, a<br />
magnificent producer of butter. It would seoo rather ironical,<br />
wouldn't it, if we and Now Zoiland who, under a system of<br />
Commonwealth preference, have had a preferred market in the old<br />
country, found that the position was reversed: that we had to<br />
pay a duty and that Danish butter went in free the complete<br />
reversal of Commonwealth preferences. This is the kind of thing<br />
that exercises our rinds and that exercises yours,<br />
But one of the things in this Treaty of Rome is to work<br />
out a cormmon agricultural policy, aimed at increasing production<br />
that is one of the things said in the Treaty and at the<br />
organisation of markots. I have r. ntioned to you that there is<br />
to be a free movement of workers; I think I have mentioned to<br />
you that there can be a free establishment of capital enterprises<br />
from one of the European countries in another; there is to be<br />
a European Investment Bank. And they have institutions, quite<br />
formidable already, including an assembly of 142 people, a<br />
Council of six, and a Commission which is a sort of executive<br />
body, of nine. On top of all this there is to be a Court of<br />
Justice to deal with the enforcement of the Treaty.<br />
Now, Sir, it will be seen at once that these<br />
arrangements of an economic kind will lead, inevitably, to<br />
closer and closer industrial and economic association between the<br />
European powers. And if Great Britain goes in I'll come later<br />
on to the terms and conditions but if she , oes in, then of<br />
course she will become more and more closely associated with then<br />
in these fields.<br />
Any amendment to the Treaty and this Treaty was nade<br />
in March, 197, and a lot of water has gone under the bridge,<br />
and a lot of advance has been rade in both Germany and France:,<br />
economically, any amendment to the Treaty requires the<br />
unanimous approval of all the Six. If any country wants to join<br />
and Great Britain is now going to negotiate then she must<br />
make an agreement with the Six, not with some of them, not with<br />
most of ther., but with all of thor. Therefore any one European<br />
power out of the Six can, by digging its hels in, insist on<br />
terms completely unacceptable to Great Britain and the matter<br />
will come to an end.<br />
Now that, broadly, is the nature of the Cormm. on Market,<br />
the Treaty of Rome, and it has, in the economic field, succeeded<br />
enormously. I would just like to say to you that before the<br />
Treaty of Rome was ever executed I had the great opportunity of<br />
having long conversations with Chancellor Adonauer in Germany, </p>
<p>and with the then Prine Minister of France and there wore<br />
different views expressed then from the ones that you will hear<br />
now, because at that tir. o France was the weak nation, cconomicay,<br />
and people said, " Oh, you must give France tine to recapture her<br />
strength before you discuss anybody coning into the CDnmon Markct'.<br />
Two years ago talking again to Adonauer, and talking, this time,<br />
to De Gaulle in Paris, I found a conplete change in the<br />
circumstances. Because France had become strong; and so strong<br />
that I rather feel that she is not in a very groat hurry to admit<br />
Groat Britain to this party. I don't know, but that is rather<br />
the impression that I got.<br />
Now there are two aspects of this matter, as to whether<br />
Great Britain, the central nation in our Cormonwealth, the most<br />
significant overseas nation in our economy, should seek to go in?<br />
And if so, on what tcrms? Now I ar not going to endeavour to<br />
answer the question " Should she go in?" I an not here to<br />
pronounce any dogmas; and I'm not here to decide a problem for<br />
Great Britain which Great Britain is immeasurably more competent<br />
to solve for herself. After all people in London are not fools:<br />
they know the people of Great Britain are not fools. They have<br />
an enormous tradition of wisdom and good judgment. And they have<br />
to thrash these matters out. All we can do from our end is to<br />
say what we think, as Australians, and to carry out our simple<br />
duty as a Government, which is to do the best thing that we can<br />
for our own country and for our own people.<br />
Quite obviously there are two aspects of this matter.<br />
One is the economic aspect. What is going to happen to our<br />
overseas trade? What do we suppose will happen to dairy products<br />
and meat, and wheat, and sugar, and dried fruits, the whole gamut<br />
of our primary exports, Uihich, apart from wool, represent of<br />
course, our great contribution to international trade and<br />
Australian solvency. We are concerned to see what happens to<br />
those. That is the economic problem.<br />
But there is another problem which is the political one.<br />
I wonder if I could just say a few words to you about the<br />
political aspect of this matter before I deal a little more<br />
fully with the other.<br />
There is nobody here, and least of all myself, who isn't<br />
a great believer in the British Cormonwealth and in what it<br />
stands for. We want to see it continue, we want to see it<br />
strengthened, we want to see its voice in the world nore<br />
powerful, and more and more respected. But we must face up to<br />
this: that the Treaty of Rome is not just a merchant's bargain,<br />
the Treaty of Rome has enormous political significance. You<br />
can't have six nations trading together with no customs barriers<br />
between then, a cormon external tariff, common industrial rules<br />
existing, a Court to enforce then, you can't have all these<br />
things without those countries becoming more and more united;<br />
and as they become more and more united so they will more and<br />
nore want to have a common foriegn policy to defend their cormon<br />
domestic policy. This seems to me to be simple, and indeed,<br />
almost elementary. That has not yet been fully conceded but I<br />
firly believe it myself.<br />
I was very interested to find that not long after I had<br />
expressed these views in almost these terms to the<br />
representative of the United Kingdom, the heads of State of the<br />
six powers I will call then the Six had a meeting and issued<br />
a communique. This is a rnarkable coranunique in my experience<br />
because it said something. ( Laughter) I am an old hand at<br />
communiques ( Laughter) I have had a finger in the pie about<br />
dozens of then, both here and ovdrseas: this is the first one I<br />
over knew that said something. I only need to tell you that I<br />
had nothing to do with drafting it. But the communique stated, </p>
<p>on the 18th July, that the Heads of States and Governments were<br />
convinced that only a united Europe is in a position, allied with<br />
the United States and other free people, to neet the dangers of<br />
the free world; that they wure deternined to develop their<br />
political co-operation with the aim of European unification, For<br />
this purpose they proposed to have regular meetings in order to<br />
bring their policy into line and reach agreed views.<br />
Now that, I confess, didn't surprise oe. It has always<br />
soomed to ne to be inevitable that a close, intimate, economic<br />
association of this kind must ultimately produce cormon political<br />
institutions and comon political policies. That is tremendously<br />
important. It is probably enormously important for the world.<br />
If you had a united Europe with all these nations in it, with a<br />
cor. mxon policy, a canon voice, and that great European power<br />
stood against the fr-ces of Cor. mLuniJm, this would give a balance<br />
of safety to the world that it now doesn't possess. This would<br />
be of tremendous significance to everybody. Therefore at this<br />
point I make no comnent on it except to say that it would<br />
involve great strength for the free world.<br />
But, Sir, the question then arises as to what happens to<br />
Great Britain in relation to the Cormnonwealth if Groat Britain<br />
goes into that new union? After all, as I have said domestic<br />
policies to which she would become party must be protected by<br />
some comnon external policies. If the old country goes into the<br />
European Cormnon Market, the European Community then I believe<br />
that she will increasingly becone absorbed in the international<br />
politics, the international views, the significance in the world<br />
of this new union or new agglomeration of power in Europe, of<br />
which she would form part.<br />
I wouldn't have you believe that I think that because of<br />
that the matter becomes unthinkable. All I have ever said about<br />
it and I repeat it here is that I will take a lot of<br />
persuading that the Conm onwealth will romain the sane if the<br />
chief country in the Cor. monwealth is . bscroed into a European<br />
political union. It may be a good thing that she should be; but<br />
don't ask me to believe that the Conrm. onwealth will remain the<br />
same. Because what happens now when you have a Cormonwealth<br />
Prime Ministers' Conference? You go along and you agree or<br />
disagree I seemed to have a lot of disagreements on my hands<br />
last time but we meet and we talk to each other and we<br />
represent our countries and the voice of Great Britain is the<br />
voice of Great Britain, uninhibited by anybody else. When it<br />
becomes, in a sense, the voice of Europe, well the position won't<br />
be quite the same, will it?<br />
You know, ladies and gentlemen, it is worth remoembering<br />
that the secret of British history in relation to Europe was for<br />
a long, long time this: she had a small country in the days,<br />
the great days of the first Elizabeth a population of less than<br />
half of what we hove in Australia today; she was a country of<br />
great seafarers, a fertile country, a sober sensible country.<br />
She maintained a position of dominance in the world right through<br />
the 19th century after the Napoleonic wars by pursuing the policy<br />
known as the " balance of power". And what was the " balance of<br />
power"? The " balance of power" involved Great Britain keeping<br />
out of entanglements in Europe, but putting her hand in when<br />
necessary to prevent one nation from becoming overwhoelingly<br />
strong. So she was able to rectify the balance in Europe.<br />
Right through the 19th century, the greatest period of British<br />
expansion in reality, the century of optimism, the century of<br />
imperial growth, the balance of power was the policy.<br />
Now the question has arisen, for decision, as to<br />
whether Great Britain should abandon that policy, abandon it and<br />
go in to Europe herself as one of the factors to be balanced </p>
<p>not as somebody from outside intervening when wise, here or<br />
there, but as one of the Seven, as it would be then, all of thon<br />
working together, arriving at their decisions and pronouncing<br />
cormon conclusions. In the history of British foreign policy this will be<br />
the most historic event for at least a century and a half. It<br />
may be that it is right. I would * ive a lot, myself, to see a<br />
united Europe, strong and cohesive, in the present state of the<br />
world. But when I put to you the political implications you . ill<br />
at once see how right it is for me to say, and feo other people<br />
to say that the decision that will ultimately be taken on this<br />
matter will be the most important decision ever taken by any<br />
British country, except in time of war, a tremendous decision,<br />
with far flung political consequences, international consequences;<br />
and of course the economic consequences to which I propose to<br />
turn. Now before I leave that aspect I ought to say to you we<br />
have a lively interest in having a powerful Europe; we have a<br />
lively interest in doing something to prevent the spread, the<br />
incessant and insidious sproed of communist power in th, world<br />
a very lively interest. All I say about the effoct, -:. o.: tically,<br />
on the Cormmonwealth is that I have never soon any particular<br />
virtue in shutting your eyes to something and protending that it<br />
isn't happening. I am quite certain myself that the B:. itish<br />
Co1mmonwealth will be something different, if this event happens,<br />
from what it is today.<br />
I think at this stage I ought to say this to you. The<br />
other day Mr. Macmillan, announced that the Government of Great<br />
Britain was going to negotiate with a view to entering the<br />
Cormon Market. That negotiation, of course, won't take place<br />
next Tuesday. Things don't happen that way. The most<br />
optimistic ostimate that I have heard as to the amount of tine<br />
that would be occupied in the negotiations was eight ronths; and<br />
when I pulled down out of the shelves the full text and annexuros<br />
of the Treaty of Rome I car. e to the conclusion that negotiating<br />
all of then might take a lot longer than eight months. But<br />
anyhow that means that some tine next year, April, May, whatever<br />
it may be, this matter will fall for decision.<br />
We are interested fron the point of view of negotiation<br />
in twto ways. In the first place a lot of these negotiations must<br />
affect our export industries. There will be negotiations about<br />
whether for example some Australian product is to pay a duty<br />
while a European product runs free. In other words whether the<br />
preferences that we have enjoyed are to be capsized and operated<br />
in favour of a European country. These are great questions. And<br />
we think, in Australia, that we in Australia are the only people<br />
who are competent to argue about them. We know our industries.<br />
And we have made it quite plain that we are not prepared to<br />
leave to somebody else the defence of Australian dairy exports,<br />
or of Australian cereal exports, or of Australian neat exports,<br />
or sugar, or whatever it nay be. They are our lively concern.<br />
The first duty of an Australian Government and it will<br />
certainly be carried out by no is to defend the interests of<br />
our own industries and to preserve the future of our own<br />
country. ( Applause)<br />
Well there will be several phases of this. Officials<br />
have already been in consultation. There will no doubt be<br />
further consultations on that, or some other level, before 1961<br />
is out. There will undoubtedly be interventions by us in the<br />
course of negotiations. Whether we are allowed to get -ito the<br />
in.. or room or not is not something we can determine; but: we<br />
will make an awful noise at the door, I can assure you, And we<br />
will be there with horse fo) ot and artillery, meaning by ' horse"<br />
a Minister or two, moaning by " foot" a couple of Heads of </p>
<p>Departments, and meaning by " artillery", as many competent people<br />
representing industry as we can put our hands on.<br />
But in due course the tine will cone when we will know<br />
what are the best terms on which Great Britain can entor. And I<br />
ronind you again: don't be too surprised about what happens<br />
because unanimity is required on the part of the Six. If any one<br />
of then says " You can't cone in and protect so-and-so's interest",<br />
then Great Britain can't cone in. This is a natter of making a<br />
negotiation with six nations all of whon have to agroe with each<br />
other on everything before the negotiation cones to a happy<br />
conclusion. When the negotiation has finished and Great Britain is<br />
in a position to say " Well we have been able to do this about<br />
neat", or " We have been able to do this about wheat", or " We have<br />
been able to do this about butter" or whatever it iay be, then<br />
no doubt at all, they will call a Conference of Connonwealth<br />
Prime Ministers to come along to say " Yos", or Not that I<br />
suppose if we all said " N1o" it would necessarily conclude the<br />
natter; but I an perfectly certain that the weight of opinion in<br />
Commonwealth countries would then be formidably felt.<br />
Now we in iAustralia are a little rmre fortunate than<br />
some; we have a broader oconomy. We can, in Austrqlia, take a<br />
shock or two occasionally because the econony of this country<br />
stands now, squarely on both fooG and we are really strong in the<br />
economic world. But poor New Zeqland, to whom the export of<br />
butter and dairy products is as important a-the export of wool<br />
to us, stands at enormous risk in these matters; and I an<br />
perfectly certain that Great Britain won't overlook that problem<br />
because it is one of overwhelming importance to our sister<br />
country. In the case of Canada, well Canada exports wheat and<br />
therefore has a lively interest in that natter; Canada also<br />
exports manuf::-ctured goods to the United Kingdon in large<br />
quantities. I don't know what the answer to that problem is<br />
going to be. Because one of the great objects of the European<br />
Common Market is to develop European manufactures in order to<br />
increase the competitive powers that they have in the world.<br />
So fron our direct noint of view, we have interests in<br />
certain export industries. have stated them categorically to<br />
the Government of the United Kingdom; we expounded then to Mr.<br />
Sandys when he was out here representing the Prine Minister for<br />
this purpose; he knows exactly how we feel about these natters;<br />
and he knows that so far as we are concerned we are not giving up<br />
without a powerful struggle the preferential system of Conmonwealth<br />
trade which h,; s meant so much to us, and I venture to<br />
say has neant even r: oro to Great Britain. ( Applause)<br />
But, of course, there is another interest that we have.<br />
Great Britain happens to be a great market for us as you know.<br />
The United Kingdon last year, 1960 I'r putting this in terms of<br />
sterling sold to Australia Å 259m. worth of goods. It is worth<br />
remembering that Australia is at present the greatest market for<br />
British goods outside the United States of America. But in<br />
Co. nonwealth terms we are the greatest customer, Å 259mf worth.<br />
' We too:' 7% of all the United Kingdom sales abroad in 1960. And<br />
the Connonwealth c: untrios, including Australia, took 42% of all<br />
the British sales; and the six countries of the Common Market<br />
took 14%. I will put that into . oro r . nm.. berablo terms: what<br />
Great Britain sold to the Conmonwealth, including Australia, in<br />
1960 was three times w. hat she sold to Germany, France, Italy,<br />
Blgiun, the Netherlands and Luxeobourg the Six. That ! oeans,<br />
of course, and Great Britain well understands this, that she has<br />
enjoyed a Commonwealth iarket inmeasurably more important to her<br />
than the market in Europe has been. </p>
<p>Well, suppose she . oes in. She will go in for one<br />
cornanding oconomic reason and that is that it would give her<br />
access to a hone market without tariffs intervening, a home<br />
narket of 250 nillion people. This I can see quite plainly is<br />
an argunent that has had groat cmpulsion on the ninds of my<br />
friends in London: " To get into this hone market; to be able to<br />
develop our export industry on the basis of this home market:; it<br />
will put us in a position competitive with the United States of<br />
America". But why can the United States of Auerica outsell<br />
people around the world? Because she has a hone market with<br />
internal free trade of 180 million people and access to all -he<br />
raw naterials of a continent. Therefore I am sure they say<br />
" This is the dominating factor; let us have the hone market and<br />
everything will be well. Jo are in great econoric difficulties"<br />
as indeed they are at present, as you know, -" let's get in to<br />
this thing". Jell of course there is another side to the coin. If<br />
they can sell free of duty to Gernany, Germany can sell, free of<br />
duty, to then. That is thj essence of an internal free trade<br />
system. And I have been wondering for r: yself I speak only for<br />
ryself on this natter I have boon wondering whether some of<br />
the industries in the United Kingdo could stand free trade<br />
copetition by sooe of the industries on the continent.<br />
You know, ladies and gentlemen, it is one of the<br />
ironies of life you have all observed them that one of the<br />
ways to get a completely up to date industrial establishment is<br />
to be beaten in a -war. In the case of W. aest Gernany the Ruhr was<br />
devastated, her heavy industries blasted practically out of<br />
existence; and with the rcnarkable skill and enorgy and hard<br />
work of the Gerrans they have cone back and all their iron and<br />
steel works are quite modern, many of them erected with foreign<br />
aid. With an iron and steel industry that is completely modern<br />
I think they are going to be at some competitive advantage with<br />
an iron and steel industry in the old country which is certainly<br />
not modern for the most part, modern only in parts.<br />
Well they have thought about that, I've no doubt. I'm<br />
not going to have you believe for one moment that they are<br />
incompetent to work these problems out for themselves they are<br />
extraordinarily competent; they know far rore about then than I<br />
do. All I want to point out to you is that there must have been<br />
great questions to be answered in their own minds about these<br />
matters before they decided to take the first step and<br />
negotiate. Because if they are right, if the home market does<br />
it, if their industries prosper, if their export capacity grows,<br />
if their purchasing power increases, we will got the benefit<br />
because as European purchasing strength, including that of Great<br />
Britain, improves, we will have a better market than before. But<br />
if they are wrong, well, it is not the kind of thing, I think,<br />
in which you can make one error and then another and then oet<br />
back. This is a tremendous and grave decision that will have<br />
to be taken. One of the things that I want to make clear to you<br />
is that they have not taken it yet. What they have decided to<br />
do is to negotiate, to test out the ground, to see i'hat the<br />
terms and conditions may be, to see how far they can protect<br />
your interests and mine, the interests of Australia, Now Zealand<br />
Canada, the British countries around the world. That is what<br />
they are going to find out. But I thought that it would be very<br />
necessary to tell you that we don't approach this problem, we,<br />
your Government, in some sirple fashion and say, " Well, whatever<br />
you say, that's all right". Jo approach this natter strong in<br />
our omw dofence, strnmg in our own interests, strong to protect<br />
Australia and its growth because if it turned out that some<br />
decision was taken, adversely to our will or our desires, and </p>
<p>this affected one or two or three of our export industries, it<br />
would be Australia that wuld have to pay the price.<br />
I have told you that this is gJing to be quite a time<br />
yet. If I survive the next election and I have already met<br />
three people who think I will ( Laughter) if I survive the<br />
next election and I am in rude health and strength, I nay be<br />
there in the riddle of this argument. I just thought I would<br />
like to let you know that I am not going along to any argunent of<br />
this kind to be a " yes" man; I'm going along carrying the<br />
greatest brief I Jver had in ny life, a brief for the export<br />
industries of Australia. ( Applause)<br />
Sir, while all that goes on we nust continue to do what<br />
we have been doing, more and more actively as tine goes on,<br />
seeking to expand our markets so that we won't have too many of<br />
our eggs in one basket. There are perhaps great markets in the<br />
world to be found, not only for Australian manufacturing, not<br />
only for Australian primary industry, not only for Australian<br />
mining, but for all of them, for every productive activity in the<br />
country. I have a number of reasons for boin happy to come along<br />
to Maitland but one of than was that you represent, in a sense,<br />
a combination of all these matters: you are cheek by jowl with<br />
one of the great stoel works of the world, one of the great basic<br />
industrial undertakings of the world; you are in the middle of a<br />
famous area for the production of primary product; I hope you<br />
remember, from time to time, at dinner tine, that you are<br />
sitting just below the most celebrated wine area in Australia;<br />
and you are sitting alongside one of the great coal measures of<br />
the country. We have been looking at all these matters in order<br />
to stimulate markets. I am very glad to see that my colleague,<br />
the Minister for National Dovelopment, Senator Spooner, is here<br />
because he is all tangled up in this coal business. But the<br />
business of exporting coal from Australia is one, I believe,<br />
that can be developed out of all sight. In fact we know it can<br />
and we are at this very moment in negotiation with the Government<br />
of New South Wales to facilitate this through coal ports.<br />
If it becomes necessary for us to go out nore and more<br />
and to scour the world for people who will buy what we produce,<br />
we shall go out and scour the world. But you know wo are old<br />
fashioned people most of us, we have it in the blood: I would<br />
fool terribly sad if anything happened to prevent us from trading<br />
to that extent, at any rate, with the old country, along the old<br />
preferential routes, to our mutual advantage and to the continued<br />
good of the world. ( Applause) </p>
<p>4 Question Could we sell primary products to Asian countries below<br />
cost by subsidising the producers?<br />
Mr. Menzies Well, Sir, we would get into a great deal of international<br />
trouble if we began to subsidise our exports, whether of<br />
primary products or otherwise. One of our great problems, of<br />
course, as you know is that we strongly suspect that there are<br />
countries that do it now and that some of the goods that we get<br />
into Australia are dumped at prices lower than the cost of<br />
production. We have anti-dumping laws, but it is not always<br />
easy to prove that they have boon dumped at below the cost of<br />
production. But there is no future, if I may say so, in getting<br />
into the copetition in the world for subsidising exports because<br />
the greater the country the more successfully it can play that<br />
game, and the more rapidly will the small one go to the wall.<br />
( Applause).<br />
Question If Groat Britain joined the Common Market adhered to<br />
the Treaty of Rome without reservation, what would be the immediate<br />
effect on our exports?<br />
Mr. Menz es<br />
Now that sounds like a simple question but it isn't<br />
in reality. Where we have no current contract the irmmediate<br />
effect on our exports would be very considerable. We would come<br />
up against the customs barrier which would then extend to the<br />
United Kingdom as well as to Europe and that would tend to damp<br />
dovm the flow of our goods into Great Britain. In one or two<br />
matters, of course we have current contracts. And when you say<br />
" unconditionally" Air, do you mean abandoning current agreements<br />
or allowing them to run out? Do you see what I mean? We have a<br />
neat agreement. Well it has some years to go. It may be<br />
that they would get an unconditional entry provided that that<br />
contract was allowed to work its time. Well the immediate effect<br />
on us then would perhaps not be very great. We have a sugar<br />
agreement in cormmon with other Cormonwealth sugar producers and<br />
that has some time to run. If Great Britain said " Well we will<br />
go in unconditionally, but the sugar agreement must be allowed<br />
to run its course" then for that time our export of sugar might<br />
be maintained, although of course we would know that there was<br />
a bad time coming in the future. We have a trade agreement with<br />
the United Kingdom, but in most respects it can be terminated on<br />
six months' notice. Well they might have to give six monthst<br />
notice. You see what I am getting at is this: that where we have<br />
no benefit of contract an unconditional adheience to the Treaty<br />
of Rome would be immediate and damaging in its impact on our<br />
exports. In certain other cases it might be a postponed impact<br />
while contracts ran out. But although I answered that question<br />
I am bound to tell you this that I do not think for one moment<br />
that Great Britain will adhere to the Treaty of Rome unconditionally.<br />
( Applause)<br />
Question Mr. Prime Minister if B-itain accepts all the implications<br />
of the Coion Market what would happen with the general<br />
agreement on trades and tariff that now exists? </p>
<p>Mr. Menzies Well, Sir, if I may say so it is a very good question<br />
and it is one that we have been putting to ourselves, because it<br />
takes a lot of working out as to how to reconcile the general.<br />
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade GITT, as we call it, in a familiar<br />
fashion it takes a lot of working out to reconcile GATT<br />
with all its rules for international trade with this new complex.<br />
Theref'ore I have no dogmatic answer but it is one of those things<br />
that we are certainly having vory much in mind. There are va~ rious<br />
aspects of this: there is GATT: there is the position of'<br />
sterling and the sterling area: there is the position of our own<br />
sterling holdings. All these things are merely thought about; in<br />
the general at present: that they have to be got down to and<br />
given close study, close examination. We will find in due course,<br />
over the next few months, that there are aspects of this matter<br />
that so far ia have not thought of that ought to be thought of'<br />
and worked out. And you do very well to draw attention to that<br />
one, ( Applause)<br />
Question if Britain accepts all the implications of the Cormon<br />
Market what becomes of the policy of preforential trade within<br />
tUhe &amp;-pire?<br />
Mr. Menzies The question is: ' If Great Britain accept, 3 all the<br />
implications of the Comm. on Market' you mean goes mn unconditionally<br />
? what becomes of preferential trade within the Corironwealth'.*<br />
Well I would thinkc that we would have to talk about it<br />
from then on the in the past tense, because it is quite clear to<br />
me that if our preferences, which have given us our market, for,<br />
our primary products in Great Britain, disappeared and were<br />
converted, on the contrary, into preferences for European countries,<br />
our competitors, then I don't think anybody would suppose<br />
for one moment that the British preferential tariff in our<br />
customs schedule would continue to exist.<br />
2uestion If Britain does eventually join the Common Market could<br />
we join?<br />
Mr. Menzies The question this tim~ i is whether we could join thae<br />
Common Market. Now I just want to say this to you: I asm not un~-<br />
willing to take on a few unpopular causes fromi time to time but<br />
I would hate to have to say to the Australian secondary industries<br />
that I had entered into a Commion Market which gave every<br />
European industrial power free trade entry into Australia with<br />
its manufactured goods. I would not only be kicked out, but I<br />
would have to catch a new ship out of the country as fast as I<br />
could. ( Laughter, applause)..<br />
Question Would a threat by all the members of the Commonwealthi<br />
to withdraw from the sterling area carry any weight with Britain<br />
as a lever to get her to stand by us?<br />
Mr. Menzies Well, frankly, Sir, I don't think so, I don't think so.<br />
It is very, very complex question this question of the relationship<br />
between the sterling area anl the non-sterling area and as<br />
you already know probably, there are quite special rules that </p>
<p>apply to British sterling held in European countries in terms<br />
of convertibility into dollars. It is a very complex problem.<br />
But first I don't think you could get any such general request:<br />
second I an not at all sure that I would be interested in making<br />
one; third I don't think that even the hint of such a thing<br />
would materially affect these negotiations. ( Applause)<br />
2Question If Great Britain went in to the Commaon Market whiat<br />
would be the circumstances that would enable her to withdrawi?<br />
Mr. Menzies I can't really tell you the answer to that off hand. I<br />
htavo been a little puzzled about it myself. But if it takes<br />
unanimity of agreement to become a riember, then it may well be<br />
it would take unanimity of decision for one member to leave. But<br />
I have not worked it out. All I know is that in these great<br />
affairs you ca' go into a great organisation and say to<br />
yourself " Well if I don't like it I'll leave", 9 because in cold<br />
practical fact it is too late to leave then. You have entered'<br />
into a lot of arrangements; you have had your industries adjusted<br />
to the new state of affairs; you have become accustomed to<br />
conducting your trade battles in a certain fashion. It not<br />
very easy to reverse course under those circumstances. But if<br />
you will allow me to say so on that particular point I really<br />
can't give you a definite reply.<br />
2uestion I would like to know whether Britain's entry into the<br />
Common Market would have the effect of speeding up her changeover<br />
to the decimal currency?<br />
Mr. Menzies To bo perfectly frank I hiaven't the slightest idea. But<br />
I don't imagine that it would, I don't imagine that it would.<br />
After all if Britain goes into the Common Market she is going; to<br />
have a nest of problems, matters to accommodate herself to and<br />
I don't imagine that decimal currency would come very high on the<br />
list. We have had a committee looking into it in Australia<br />
everybody is in favour of decimal currency until you tell them<br />
the size of the bill. ( Laughter) Then they say " Well that's<br />
all right; you boys can pay it". And when I say that to the<br />
Treasurer, he faints. ( Laughter) ( Applause)<br />
Qustion What value would be the exports of primary products frorm<br />
Australia to other countries than Great Britain? And what would<br />
be the value of such exports to Great Britain.<br />
Mr. Menzies Well, Sir, I am sorry I don't carry these figures in my<br />
mind as I am sure you wouldn't expect me to. We have of course<br />
substantial exports of primary products to other countries; and<br />
of course very substantial ones to the United Kin[ gdomi. You are<br />
right in saying that in any event we would need to expand our<br />
narket-f for our primary industries around the world. And we will<br />
do that anyhow because there is a limit, having regard to our<br />
growth and development in Australia, there is a limit to the<br />
extent to which we can find armaa2ket in one country and not in<br />
others. We are actively pursuing m~ arkets in other countries. We<br />
have a very elaborate Trade Cormmissionor service which is constantly<br />
looking for markets and, as you know we have had trade<br />
missions of a variety of kinds g~ oing arounl to different countries<br />
in the world, not without success. I here that more and more<br />
we will diversify the markets for our -oods. ( Applause) </p>
