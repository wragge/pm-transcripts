<p>John Howard is set to arrive in Washington tomorrow and is expected</p>
<p> to confront President Clinton on the lamb issue next week. The Prime</p>
<p> Minister told Matt Peacock in Tokyo that Washington is guilty of double</p>
<p> standards.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The United States is constantly encouraging people and exhorting people</p>
<p> to support open trade. They condemn others who don't practise open</p>
<p> trade but when it suits their own convenience, because they are the</p>
<p> strongest country in the world, they just slam on these punitive tariffs.</p>
<p> Now, in the end we can but complain and help our own. We'll take them</p>
<p> to the World Trade Organisation. We'll use all the rules that are</p>
<p> available and we'll invoke all the rules against them, which we have</p>
<p> a perfect right to do, and we'll help our own as best we can. And</p>
<p> I say to the lamb producers, we'll try and help you because you have</p>
<p> been very unfairly treated.</p>
<p>PEACOCK:</p>
<p>At the end of the day the free trade stuff is rhetoric, at the end</p>
<p> of the day might is right.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, on this particular issue common-sense has not prevailed, that</p>
<p> doesn't mean to say you don't keep trying because we are better off</p>
<p> now than we would have been if some of the markets that we have won</p>
<p> over the past few years had not been prized open. And even though</p>
<p> we've suffered a severe setback on this issue, and we have every right</p>
<p> to complain, on other fronts, for example, we are supplying something</p>
<p> like 30 per cent of the beef market here in Japan. Now, that's something</p>
<p> we weren't doing a few years ago and we wouldn't have won that if</p>
<p> we hadn't have campaigned for more liberal trade. So, because we've</p>
<p> had a set back it doesn't mean to say we don't keep trying.</p>
<p>PEACOCK:</p>
<p>Is this compensation package that you're offering the lamb industry</p>
<p> a one-off or would you be prepared to offer it to any other efficient</p>
<p> Australian industry?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I'm not giving any open-ended, on-the-run commitments. That's silly.</p>
<p> I'm dealing with a quite specific situation where this industry won</p>
<p> a market. It's won it without any government help. We're not here</p>
<p> talking about helping a failing, inefficient Australian industry.</p>
<p> We're talking about helping an industry that's played by the rules</p>
<p> of open, vigorous trade, won a market and then been unfairly clobbered.</p>
<p> Now, according to all the understandings of Australian fair play those</p>
<p> people are entitled to a bit of help and that's what we're going to</p>
<p> do.</p>
