. JAU5T1( ALA_,<br />
FOR PRESS 23 OCTOBER 1978<br />
ADDRESS AT<br />
ASEAN TRADE FAIR<br />
I ama delighted to be here today to open the ASEAN Trade Fair,<br />
and to see so many representatives from ASEAN countries.<br />
The idea of a Fair to promote further the development of<br />
economic co-operation between Australia and ASEAN was first<br />
suggested in discussions I had with the ASEAN Heads of Government<br />
in Kuala Lumpur in August 1977. It is a tribute to everyone<br />
involved that the idea has been transformed into such an impressive<br />
reality. It has required hard work and co-operation on the part of the<br />
exhibitors, and the national trade promotion agencies of each<br />
of the ASEAN countries, in conjunction with Australian authorities.<br />
The Fair has been financed by the Australian Government with the<br />
objective of providing companies from ASEAN with an opportunity<br />
to present new products to the Australian market, to promote<br />
existing exports, and to obtain a better appreciation of the<br />
Australian market and its particular requirements.<br />
Australia's economic relationship with ASEAN is healthy and<br />
growing, despite the economic difficulties that we have all<br />
experienced in recent years. Trade between Australia and<br />
ASEAN has grown dramatically. Australian imports from ASEAN<br />
grew from $ 97million in 1971/ 72, to $ 557 million in 1977/ 78.<br />
This represents an average annual growth rate of 34% compared<br />
with a corresponding figure of 19% for total Australian imports.<br />
ASEAN's share of the Australian import market has increased<br />
from 2.4% to 5% in that period. manufactured imports from<br />
ASEAN have increased dramatically. Australia's imports of<br />
manufactures from ASEAN countries grew at an average rate of<br />
47% a year between 1971/ 72 and 1977/ 78 more than twice the<br />
rate of our total imports of manufactures. / 2 </p>
<p>Trade has grown even in sensitive areas, at times at the<br />
expense of Australian industry. For example, Australian imports<br />
of clothing, textiles and footwear from ASEAN have grown<br />
from $ 6.5million in 1971/ 72 to $ 45. lmillion in 1977/ 78 an<br />
annual average growth rate of 38%.<br />
During 1975, on the basis of the latest revised statistics<br />
provided by GATT, Australian imports of these sensitive pr'oducts<br />
amounted to $ 2.14 per head. Comparable imports in that year by<br />
the United States amounted to only 63 cents per head; by the<br />
EEC, Sicents her head; by Canada, 4lcents per head, and by<br />
Japan, 25 cents per head. If these countries had imported from<br />
ASEAN the same value per head as we have, ASEAN exports of<br />
these sensitive items would have been in 1975 around $ 1,000 million<br />
higher. Historically, it is true that Australia has sold more to ASEAN<br />
than it has bought from ASEAN. This situation reflects a number<br />
of factors including the difference in population size between<br />
Australia with 14 million people, and ASEAN with approximately<br />
240 million people.<br />
Nevertheless, this trade gap is narrowing. Last financial year<br />
our exports to ASEAN grew by 29%. Too often,* reports ignore<br />
the growth of our two-way trade, and dwell on the few problems<br />
that are inevitable in a healthy and growing trade relationship.<br />
When these problems do emerge, it is important that they be<br />
tackled in a positive way tha * t we all-make an effort to achieve<br />
a better understanding of the situation each of our countries<br />
faces, and not allow difficulties to distort our total trading<br />
relationship. There is a natural trading relationship between ASEAN and<br />
Australia. Economic development in ASEAN is creating a<br />
demand for Australian raw materials and consumer and capital<br />
goods, and already the ASEAN countries have benefitted from<br />
the general growth in imports into Australia, and from policies<br />
designed to promote imports from developing countries, including<br />
ASEAN. The ASEAN countries now supply some 28% of imports eligible<br />
for preferential treatment under the Australian system of tariff<br />
preferences for developing countries. In fact, approximately<br />
of imports from ASEAN enter Australia duty free, or are<br />
eligible for duty free or preferential treatment under the<br />
developing country preference system. In addition, ASEAN<br />
exporters have been major users of the market advisory<br />
section in the Department of Trade and Resources, which has<br />
coordinated arrangements for this Fair.<br />
That section has assisted ASEAN businessmen through servicing<br />
more than 300 product enquiries, and has facilitated at least<br />
trade missions from ASEAN in recent years; two of those<br />
missions will be in Australia next week. ./ 3 </p>
<p>It may take effort and extensive market research to penetrate<br />
the Australian market in the face of strong competition from<br />
third country suppliers. But the effort is worthwhile and<br />
Australia will continue to assist ASEAN exporters in their<br />
efforts to sell in this country.<br />
Australia and ASEAN both want to see significant and stable<br />
growth in world trade as a whole. This would mrean increased<br />
trade and prosperity for Australia and all its trading partners.<br />
It would help stimulate Australian/ ASEAN trade to our mutual<br />
benefit. With regard to our own exports, Australia has been active in<br />
increasing its sales to numerous parts of the world. A number<br />
of ASEAN nations, particularly China, South Korea, Hong Kong<br />
and Taiwan, have shown strongly growing demand for Australian<br />
products, particularly for agricultural and mineral commodities.<br />
Indeed, China has jumped from being our fifteenth largest<br />
export market in 1976/ 77 to fourth largest in 1977/ 78; while<br />
South Korea has risen from thirteenth position to ninth.<br />
As an indication of the importance we attach to markets in this<br />
region, the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade and<br />
Resources, Mr. Anthony is to visit China this week to seek<br />
further sales for Australian products. Australia also sees<br />
the oil-rich countries of the Middle East as increasingly<br />
important buyers of our products.<br />
We have opened a number of trade cornissions in the area in<br />
the past few years and strengthened existing posts. Our<br />
exports to countries in this region, particularly Iran, Saudi<br />
Arabia and Kuwait, have grown significantly in recent years.<br />
over the last five years our exports to this region have risen<br />
by 400% to over $ 750 million. We are determined to increase<br />
our trade to markets all around the world.<br />
Australia's close involvement with ASEAN is not of course<br />
confined to trade matters. Over recent years, Australian<br />
investment in the region has grown, our aid programme has<br />
steadily built up, and there has been much closer and<br />
more regular consultation and exchange at all levels. What<br />
is particularly pleasing is the development of Australia's<br />
relations with ASEAN as a whole, as well as with its<br />
individual member countries.<br />
Australia has participated in a number of major initiatives<br />
in this field and is proud of this record. Very early on,<br />
in 1974, we established a formal relationship with ASEAN,<br />
and we now hold annual officials' talks known as the ASEAN/ Australia<br />
Forum. The fourth meeting will be held next week and we are<br />
very pleased indeed once again to be able to welcome ASEAN.<br />
officials to Canberra. </p>
<p>Australia was also the first country to establish an economic<br />
cooperation programme with ASEAN. This now represents a commitment<br />
of $ 15 million. It has improved contacts between specialists<br />
in various fields in ASEAN and Australia.<br />
Perhaps the most important landmark in our relationship was the<br />
meeting of the ASEAN Heads of Government, ana Mr. Fukuda,<br />
Mr. Muldoon and myself, in Kuala Lumpur last year. It placed<br />
the relationship between ASEAN and its neighbours on a new<br />
footing and strengthened mutual understanding among all our<br />
countries. In the year since the Kuala Lumnpur summit, much progress has<br />
been made towards developing closer practical forms of cooperation<br />
and consultation. One of the most important of these has been<br />
the proposal to establish ASEAN/ Australian consultative meetings.<br />
The terms of reference have now been agreed between the ASEAN<br />
and Australian Governments.<br />
No one denies that there have been on occasions, some difficulties<br />
and misunderstandings on trade matters. This new consultative<br />
machinery will provide the ASEAN and the Australian Governments<br />
with better opportunities for communicating their interests<br />
and concerns. I trust that it will also provide a better<br />
opportunity for discussing and resolving mutual trade problems<br />
before they become too difficult.<br />
Another event on this year's calendar was the Australia/ ASEAN<br />
Industrial Cooperation Conference in Melbourne. It was<br />
highly successful in bringing together representatives of the<br />
private sector and government from both ASEA14 and Australia.<br />
I am sure that this Trade Fair will be similarly successful.<br />
The Government's hope is that this and future fairs will<br />
increase Australian business awareness of ASEAN and what it has<br />
to offer, and also help ASEAN to improve further its competitive<br />
footing in the Australian market.<br />
These are just some of the areas of cooperation. Others will<br />
have a slightly longer term focus. For instance, the<br />
Australian/ ASEAN Joint Research Project which I announced<br />
last year in Kuala Lumpur will aim at establishing a sound<br />
basis of knowledge from which the long-term relationship can<br />
be developed. I have also indicated Australia's willingness<br />
to assist where possible in the development of the ASEAN<br />
indus trial projects.<br />
The Government fully recognises the importance to Australia<br />
of the future of ASEAN. Gatherings such as these provide<br />
the opportunity to build up both the personal and commercial<br />
contacts which will be so necessary in cementing relations<br />
between Australia and ASEAN. </p>
<p>A very important interest shared by Australia and the countries<br />
of ASEAN is our common concern about world commodity trade. It<br />
is an issue which has been too often set aside by the major<br />
developed countries in important international negotiations.<br />
The Multilateral Trade Negotiations have now been in progress<br />
for a very considerable length of time. If these negotiations<br />
lead to a new Multilateral Trade Agreement, such an agreement<br />
will set the pattern for international trade for the next<br />
few decades. But I may say that the omens for a satisfactory<br />
conclusion of MTN are not all good. The negotiations were<br />
originally due to conclude in July. They were then scheduled<br />
to conclude by the end of this year. even that target<br />
seems unlikely to be achieved. There is evidence that the<br />
negotiations are losing their momentum losing sight of<br />
the prime aim to secure a fairer and stronger world trading<br />
systemL. It is essential that the M4TN succeeds in liberalising<br />
trade in all products, not just those of interest to the<br />
major industrial countries.<br />
Agriculture and other commodities are of vital importance to most<br />
developing countries including ASEAN. Trade in these products<br />
can no longer be left off the agenda of international negotiations.<br />
A better deal must be achieved for commodities.<br />
Unstable commodity prices and markets have harmed the export<br />
earnings and growth prospects of developing countries,' indeed<br />
of all commTodity producing countries. Australia knows this<br />
from its own experience.<br />
For the purchasing countries, boom-then-bust commodity markets<br />
have entailed sudden massive price swings, and often set<br />
off irreversible wage rises and longer term inflationary<br />
pressures. It is in the interests of both producers and<br />
consumers that there be stable commodity trade. The Australian<br />
Government believes that a viable and well-managed Common<br />
Fund can help achieve this goal, and we have made every effort<br />
to assist in bringing about agreement between the developed<br />
and developing nations on this issue.<br />
Australia participated in the CIEC Conference in June last year<br />
where the first agreement in principle was reached, on the<br />
need to establish a Common Fund. We pursued the matter at<br />
the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting in London, and<br />
a technical group was established to look at how such a fund<br />
might be set up.<br />
At the Commonwealth Regional Meeting last February, we announced<br />
our decision to break away from the rather inflexible stance<br />
then being taken by the developed countries, and since then<br />
we have been using all our diplomacy and powers of persuasion<br />
to help in bringing both sides together. In April, at our<br />
initiative, a meeting of Commonwealth ministers was held in<br />
London to consider the report of the technical group, and a<br />
significant degree of consensus was reached. </p>
<p>Later that month I discussed this issue in detail with Mr. Fukuda<br />
and other members of the Japanese ministry, and in June. I<br />
pursued this matter vigorously in the United States and Europe.<br />
At the OECD Ministerial Council f-leeting in Paris, the Minister<br />
for Foreign Affairs, Andrew Peacock, took the initiative in<br />
holding detailed discussions with tMr. Vance on the Common Fund<br />
issue. In our view, this major effort has proven most worthwhile.<br />
Wle have been encourage&amp; by recent signs that some of the major<br />
participants in the gtations are reviewing their positions,<br />
and may be prepare to a= pt a more flexible approach in the<br />
UNCTAD Negot%-iati Conference to be held next month. The U. S.<br />
attitude will critical to the successful conclusion of the<br />
Common Fund gotiations. It was therefore most encouraging<br />
that U. S. ecretary of State Vance affirmed at the U. N.<br />
General Assembly that a soundly designed Common Fund could<br />
play a useful role in alleviating co~ r-mnodity problems and<br />
benefit participating countries. For its part, the Australian<br />
Government will take every oppor' nity to promote a consensus<br />
on the issue from now until the en of the Negotiating Conference.<br />
Two senior Australian officials have just completed talks with*<br />
U. S. officials with a view to further developing the Common Fund<br />
concept. We are hoping to hold similar discussions with other<br />
countries as the opportunity arises in the lead up to the<br />
Negotiating Conference, and in this we would hope to cooperate<br />
with the ASEAN countries.<br />
They have a reputation for good sense and moderation in international<br />
forums, and I believe they will have a most important role to<br />
play in achieving the consensus we hope will emerge. A further<br />
opportunity will arise for us to pursue this matter in December<br />
at the meeting of a group of developed and developing countries<br />
called by the Jamaican Prime Minister, Mr. Manley.. The fact<br />
that a number of Heads of Government have agreed to meet in<br />
the last week of December underscores the movement that is<br />
taking place on this issue, and the significance which many<br />
government leaders are now attaching to it.<br />
In Australia, we have watched ASEAN's development with admiration.<br />
The achievements have been outstanding. The countries of<br />
ASEAN have tackled their problems with vigour and<br />
determination. Through their own efforts the five countries are<br />
steadily bringing greater prosperity and stability to their<br />
region. Each country has better than 6% annual growth rates.<br />
The ASEAN countries are developing close cooperation as an<br />
economic group at both the government and private levels and<br />
building harmonious relationships with their neighbours.<br />
Australia is delighted to have such growing and prosperous<br />
neighbours. I am sure that this Fair will help develop<br />
Australia's relationship with ASEAN. I wish the Fair every<br />
success, and I hope that all our ASEAN exhibitors go home<br />
with full order books. o00000000 </p>
