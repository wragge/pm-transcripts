    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to announce that His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales will visit Australia from 28 February to 5 March 2005, travelling to Perth, Alice Springs, Melbourne, Sydney, and Canberra.</p>
<p>The visit by His Royal Highness will focus on three major themes: environmental sustainability; excellence in public service; and community integration. He will use his visit to support environmental initiatives, sustainable fishing policies and urban regeneration projects.</p>
<p> The Prince will have the opportunity to meet a cross-section of Australians involved in a variety of projects of interest including medical staff, school teachers, sporting coaches, farmers and indigenous Australians. In addition the Prince will also attend a number of formal and informal receptions.  There will also be a number of opportunities for the public to meet His Royal Highness.</p>
<p>Further details of the visit will be released closer to the time.  His Royal Highness will travel on to New Zealand and Fiji from Australia.</p>
<p>This will be the Prince of Wales's thirteenth visit to Australia.  His last visit was in 1994.</p>
<p> I know that Australians will welcome His Royal Highness with the warmth for which they are renowned.</p>
