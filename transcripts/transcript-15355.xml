<p>Good morning,</p>
<p>Yesterday I announced a big increase in funding for disability support services that will help address a growing need in the Australian community; and that is the issue of caring for disabled Australians as their parents and carers age. </p>
<p>This is an area of great need. I've been touched by the many families caring for disabled adult children who are concerned about their ability to provide ongoing care as they themselves grow older.</p>
<p>Under the $1.8 billion program, more than half a billion dollars has been allocated to supported accommodation for disabled adults. Parents over 65 who have been caring for their adult disabled children for many years will have priority access to these new services.</p>
<p>Supported accommodation is traditionally provided by the states and territories, but there is significant unmet demand for places in Australia at present. Our strong economic position has enabled the Commonwealth to move into this area for the first time. I hope the states will increase their funding for services for other disabled Australians.</p>
<p>The disability package will also include a new annual payment of $1000 for disabled children under 16. This will assist about 130,000 Australians and is on top of the one-off bonus provided in the May budget.</p>
<p>Disabled Australians are amongst our most vulnerable citizens and the Government has a responsibility to ensure they are properly treated, particularly as the population ages. The policies I announced yesterday will help and this is yet another example of the social dividend from our current economic prosperity.</p>
