FOR MEDIA SATURDAY, 17 NOVEMBER 1979<br />
ADDRE~ SS TO VICTORIAN STATE COUNCIL<br />
As we approach the end of this decade the Liberal Party in<br />
Victoria and Australia is ex-periencing a sense of history,<br />
optimism and challenge.<br />
Thirty-five years ago last October 13, Robert Menzies brought<br />
fourteen fragmented organisations into one. Modern liberalism<br />
was born on -that day under one banner with one body of ideas.<br />
Little more than five years later, and thirty years ago this<br />
December 10th, the Liberal philosophy won endorsement from<br />
the Alstralian electorate. The appeal made in the policy<br />
speech in 19490 was unqualified and timeless. It asked: " Are we<br />
for the subordination of the individual to the universal<br />
officialdom of governmnent or are we for the ancient British<br />
faith that govcrniments are the servants of the people..."<br />
The spirit of that -time was embodied in the belief that " The<br />
best people in this commnunity are not those who leave it to the<br />
other fellow but those who by thrift and self sacrifice<br />
establish homes, bring up families and add to the national<br />
pool of savings owing nothing to anybody".<br />
It is not surp~ rising that this struck a chord with Australians<br />
in 1949 and began an unbroken run of 23 years of Liberal<br />
government in Australia. But by the end of 1975, the national<br />
splirit had sagged to a demoralising and depressing level.<br />
I appealed then -to Australians to retain their idealism; their<br />
faith in institutions; their sense of reform; their dedication<br />
to democracy. I called upon them for a return of liberal<br />
values. I urged them to recall what they had seemingly forgotten.<br />
That we must " re-ward personal initiative encourage<br />
investment and mobilise the imagination and the resources<br />
of the Australian people...".<br />
In the last -four years Australians have shared in that conviction<br />
and are now sharing in the hard-won successes. And they are<br />
hard-won, simply because the fight to free the spirit of man,<br />
to unhinge him from government control, is an unending one.<br />
In a very real sense the battlefield must never be vacated.<br />
The fight for individual freedom can never be won for all time.<br />
What we must do now is to win that freedom for our time; to hand<br />
on to our children conditions and attitudes in society which allow<br />
for the full expression of individualism and creative spirit.<br />
We must never allow the beliefs which brought us our success<br />
to become corroded. / 2 </p>
<p>We need to remember -that since the War, Labor governments<br />
won decisive mandates from the electorate in 1946 and 1972.<br />
To forget the lessons of the three years following those<br />
victories, is to invite certain failure. The criticisms of<br />
Labor Government leading up to 1949 were as comprehensive and<br />
complete as they were leading up to the election in 1975.<br />
Yet incredible as this may seem now, the behaviour and resolution<br />
of the Labor movement today, demonstrate that those<br />
desires are still Very much part of the A. L. P. passion.<br />
The recent A. L. P. conference in Adelaide resolved to seek<br />
to alter the Constitution to give the Commonwealth powers<br />
to implement the Labor Party's economic and socialist<br />
objectives. One of-these is nationalisation.<br />
Such a resolution demonstrates that the socialist fires<br />
throughout the years have been kepL alight. The stubborness,<br />
inflexibility and unreality of L abor principles are the same now<br />
as they were then.<br />
Still, the Labor emphasis is on government control and<br />
governm~ ent management, still they nurture the view that all<br />
individual security can be independent of individual effort.<br />
These theories have no relevance in the ' 80s. They embody<br />
false va'lues. Yet in 1972, by default, we gave Labor a chance<br />
to put these theories into practice. That this was possible is<br />
a greater indictment of us than it is a reflection of Labor's<br />
capacity -for survival. I caution you st~ rongly to prevent these<br />
doctrines gaining supremacy again.<br />
In 1975 as in 1949, Liberalism was called upon to inject<br />
commonsense and commitment into the Australian nation and its<br />
economy. It summoned -the creative and regenerative capacities<br />
of the nation. It promised a philosophy that would give these<br />
capacities expression.<br />
We' prclaime -the role of the individual after three ycars of<br />
socialism had challenged individual rights; we exalted men and<br />
women after three years in which socialism had exalted government.<br />
For three years Labor had weakened the economy and its capacity<br />
for growth. All our efforts were directed towards securing<br />
sustainable growth without which many of our philosophical<br />
objectives are impossible.<br />
Now we are embarking on a new decade of challenge. As a party and<br />
as a nation we must reassert our pride in individualism, personal<br />
freedom, self-advancement in short, Liberalism. We must<br />
re-kindle the vision of the future; the desire for enterprise;<br />
the excitement of creating and building; the dedication to scale<br />
new heights; the willingness to mobilise the talents of all<br />
Australians. / 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
It is when we take the individual capacities of all Australians<br />
for granted; when we begin to believe that the role of the<br />
government is superior to the role of the individual; then<br />
we begin to move Australians from the responsibilities of<br />
individualism to the excesses of socialism.<br />
The period 1949 to 1972 was a powerful expression of Liberalism.<br />
Activity, production and investment, grew and diversified.<br />
Before the War and up to the 50s, our international trading<br />
reputation was built on our great rural industries. Soon, this<br />
dependence began to change as manufacturing industries, started<br />
in the 40s, expanded and broadened our industrial base.<br />
Acomprehensive migration programme opened up domestic markets.<br />
Foreign investment brought new technology and skills. Suddenly,<br />
Australia was the land of greater opportunity, spawning men and<br />
women of adventure, commitment and achievement.<br />
Then came the mineral boom, for which the figures tell the<br />
best story. In 1948-49 mineral exports represented 6 per cent<br />
of Australia's total exports. By 1970-71, this figure had grown<br />
to 25 per cent. They too, brought new technologies, new markets,<br />
new communities in remote areas, new thrusts to decentralisation.<br />
The Government's job, then as now, was to provide the structure<br />
in which all this could proceed. Because they did the challenges<br />
of the 50' s and 60' s were being accorded the appropriate response.<br />
Somehow, though, success broughtits own temptations in the<br />
Had we lost our nerve? Had our creative drive expired? Had we<br />
continued to believe in our principles, but failed to fight for<br />
them? Were we questioning our own dedication and idealism?<br />
Whatever the case, we developed a short-sightedness about the<br />
effects of Labor Government and the hustings rang with the<br />
emptiness of Labor slogans all through 1972; but this time to<br />
a new, younger and more receptive audience. The presentation<br />
was the same. Here was the superficially-attractive idea that<br />
the Government should meet all individual needs and Labor<br />
promised to do just this.<br />
There was no mention of obligation upon the individual; no<br />
expectations of merit, or excellence, or exertion from all<br />
of us. Whole generations who had grown up with a level of<br />
security and freedom from need, suddenly began to take these<br />
for granted. Liberal achievements in welfare and social reform<br />
invalid pensions; increased child endowment; homes for the aged;<br />
massive advances in education; Commonwealth scholarships; the<br />
building of universities and teaching colleges, science blocks<br />
and school libraries all these were forgotten as the electorate<br />
was persuaded artificially that it was time. Time for what?<br />
The question was soon to be answered. But not as the nation<br />
had expected. / 4 </p>
<p>-4-<br />
Was it the time for increases in p-ersonal income tax to the<br />
tune of 125 per cent in three years? Was it the time for,, in<br />
various 12 month periods, Commronwealth Government expenditure<br />
to rise by 46 per cent? Award wages to increase by 38 per cent?<br />
Government expenditure in health, under Fr. Hayden's management,'<br />
to rise by 113 per cent?<br />
Was it time for government employment to grow by 100,000 while<br />
private sector em * ployment fell by 150,000? Was it time for,<br />
the economy to stagnate after years of impressive economic<br />
growth under Liberal governments? Was it time for us to be<br />
shown that Labor could not afford all its grandiose plans: that<br />
Labor's big spending could not be financed from an economy<br />
crippled by Labor policies? Whether it was time or not, it<br />
happened. in 1975, as in 1949, it befell the Liberal Government to arrest<br />
the drift of socialism. We have been supported in this task by<br />
a nation which prides itself on economic security and the capacity<br />
of its members to work together. We are together learning that<br />
we cannot make greater demands of government than the nation' s<br />
productive capacities can provide.<br />
Yet, in spite of our real success, there are always prophets of<br />
negativism and nihilism; people who opt for the easy task of<br />
tearing down rather than th1-e difficult one of building up.<br />
I am heartened by a current A. L. P. strategy document which says,<br />
and I cuote!<br />
" We live in the best country in the world, rich in<br />
human and natural resources. We produce most of our<br />
own oil. We have abundant supplies of coal and other<br />
minerals. We are -the best-educated society in the<br />
world".<br />
What greater tribute can there be than that to the record of<br />
Coalitrion C~ v ! r n me P,<br />
The last four years have been a significant part of this record<br />
of coalition government. We are placed to enter the 80' s with<br />
a prospect for the future much brighter than most of the<br />
industrialised world. I say to you unapologetically, that<br />
Liberalism stakes its claims to Government in the 80s on its<br />
capacity to secure economic growth.<br />
There is no future for Australia without economic growth.<br />
Without economic growth the aspirations of an advance society<br />
cannot be realised. Without economic growth we cannot as a<br />
nation create more jobs; we cannot as a nation meet our welfare<br />
responsibility; we cannot as a nation support generously the<br />
arts and cultural activities; we cannot as a nation provide<br />
the life which maximises freedom, opportunity and achievement.<br />
The signposts of better economic conditions over the last four<br />
years are easy to read. We have reduced inflation. Our industry<br />
is now competitive. Costs are down and exports are up. Private<br />
capital inflow into Australia in the last financial year was<br />
the highest since 1971-72. Commonwealth Government expenditure<br />
has been severely contained in the last three budgets. </p>
<p>Real investment by business increased by nearly 10 per cent<br />
last year. Civilian employment in the year to'* July grew by<br />
60,000. In this financial year, the gross value of rural.<br />
outpu-t is estimated to increase 60 per cent in 1977-78 levels.<br />
And when we look at what is happening to some economies overseas<br />
with rate! s Of inflation and their interest rates, we h-ave<br />
done well, and let us not be denied our achievements. They<br />
have not come by accident or under sympathetic conditions.<br />
These are -the result of deliberate government policy.<br />
At the end of a decade, our economic machinery is geared to<br />
move us confidently into the future. We have abundant raw<br />
materials, materials the world wants and needs. We have<br />
energy supplies in an energy-scarce world.<br />
Coal, natural gas, crude oil, electricity and uranium<br />
represent an impressive total endowment of energy commodities.<br />
They are high in demand in the world and this demand is likely<br />
to intensify in the 80s. Our response to this privileged<br />
position is one of credibility and consistency. In the first<br />
Place, if any economic system is to achieve growth and stability,<br />
inflation has to be controlled.<br />
In other words, resources themselves cannot generate the<br />
economic growth that is needed. They must be coupled to<br />
realistic and forward-thinking policies. Our willingness as<br />
a Government to harness our energy reserves has earned us<br />
international respect. It is already paying dividends.<br />
With oil, our policy encourages further exploration and<br />
development at a -time when leading commentators were advising<br />
that production from Australian fields would taper off. Only<br />
18 months ago, it had been p-rdicted during the 80' s that our<br />
self-sufficiency in oil would fall to 25%. But our realistic<br />
prici ng policy now means that Australia should be at least<br />
502% sel-F-s,,! fic~ ienjt-in oil, ._ j-til well into the / 6 </p>
<p>6<br />
The position with coal is just as encouraging.<br />
Current coal exports of 38 million tonnes a year are<br />
expected to rise to 200 million tonnes by the year 2000, according<br />
to the estimates of the International Energy Agency. our<br />
massive reserves of coal provide us with unprecedented opportunities<br />
for developing raw materials here in Australia. Coupled with this,<br />
as J apan finds her energy costs mounting, aluminium smelter<br />
projects are moving to Australia with abundant raw materials<br />
and low-cost power. One of the results of this is that, whvile<br />
Australia now has only 1.5% of the world output of aluminium,<br />
if we take account of the new projects firmly committed in<br />
Australia, that share if likely to rise -to over 10% by 1985.<br />
The uranium picture is just as encouraging.<br />
We possess massive reserves. At a time when the requirements of<br />
the Wes-trn world are expected -to triple by ,1990. All of this<br />
requires a government which, in changing circumstances, can<br />
acco-, mmodate these changes and adapt to them.<br />
It: can never be over-stated that these energy achievements<br />
are the result of our policies, our decisions, our encouragement<br />
of the development of our resources. A Labor government would<br />
destroy investment and economic growth by excessive taxation,<br />
e:: cessive regulation and excessive intervention.<br />
The A. L. P.' s decision not to mine uranium is shameful and<br />
selfish, but for the A. L. P. to declare that it would nol honour<br />
existing contracts constitutes a savage threat to our international<br />
trustworthiness.<br />
It represents Labor dogma at its worst. It pays little regard<br />
to reality. These are threats to our international wellbeing.<br />
They must he taken seriouslv.<br />
We must not allow any paralysis of willpower to provide the very<br />
momtentum, that Labor needs. Mr Hayden recently argue-d that,<br />
" There was nothing revolutionary or even. particularly<br />
radical about the Whitlam programmes".<br />
( Chamberlain Lecture, Mlarch 1979, P. 19)<br />
His sympathy for the Whitlam programmes and determination to<br />
implement them again was evident in his recent performance at<br />
the A. L. P. Conference . in Adelaide. The resolutions of that<br />
conference to which a Labor government is bound, express a<br />
commitment to return to extravagance and economic indiscipline.<br />
How else can we interpret the conference ' s resolution that a<br />
Labor government would increase enormously the size of government<br />
and the extent of its activitios, that it would abolish staff<br />
ceilings in the Public Ser-vice. </p>
<p>7-<br />
A Labor government would seek to amend the Cons Litution to give<br />
the Commonwealth Government powers " as are necessary" specifically<br />
to implement the Labor Party's economic and social objectives.<br />
It would seek to amend the Constitution to reduce the power<br />
of the Governor General, to strip the Senate of the power of<br />
to reject: any proposed laws. A Labor government would allow<br />
unionists to strike in the course of their activities, immune<br />
from any pains or penalties thereby placing unions above the law.<br />
It would introduce new taxes a resources tax, a capital gains<br />
tax, a wealth tax and it would increase taxation.<br />
It would monitor the operations of international corporations<br />
and supply information collected in this way to Australian<br />
trade unions and international trade union organisations.<br />
It would uise nationalisation as a means of economic management.<br />
These proM4 sed assaults on a stable and internationally credible<br />
Australia must be taken seriously What kind of credible political<br />
party is it which ignores inflation to such an extent that the<br />
words ' anti-inflationary' were not even included in the<br />
Wages and Tncomes Policy of the A. L. P.<br />
That was the policy that Mr. Hawlke called a gutless sell out to<br />
the left.<br />
It is any wonder that since the Conference Mr. Hayden has<br />
protested, " tha1: considerable suspicion of the Labor Party<br />
and all Labor Party governments remains in<br />
the electorate."<br />
( T.-JITRvan Le Ct.-ure. Octob-er 1079,<br />
This suspicion is well-founded. We must never abandon our<br />
faith in Liberal principles to secure national goals.<br />
Th--history of Liberalism since 1945, has provided a catalogue<br />
of Prosperity, stability and achievement that we must seek<br />
to emulate in the 80s. But, our commitment to Australia can<br />
only have active relevance when our philosophies gain<br />
expression in Government.<br />
Only in Government can we continue to attack inflation,<br />
promote economic growth, and increase job oppo rtunities<br />
for all Australians; can we secure the monarchy, the Parliament<br />
and the Constitution from savage attack; can we secure the<br />
devolution of economic and political power which is the hallmark<br />
of real freedom; can we secure the vital role of the States in<br />
our federal system; can we secure freedom for all individuals<br />
and protection for all people from the intrusion into their<br />
lives of large and complex bureaucracies. These goals have<br />
been n--ached in the past because of Coalition Government.<br />
It would be short--sighlted, to say the least, to allow them to<br />
be placed in jeopardy now. I need not remind any of you that<br />
the waterless desert of Socialism is no breeding ground for<br />
individual freedom. </p>
<p>Let us remember that at no time in the past, did<br />
Sir Robert Menzies possess a majority in his own right<br />
in -the House of Representatives or the Senate.<br />
Had he at any -time denied the coalition, he would have been<br />
effectively denying Liberal Government. What then would have<br />
happened to Australia in the last thirty years?<br />
The success of the coalition in the past has certainly sprung<br />
from commitment and faith by all of us. But is has been<br />
sustained by individual and party * discipline; by -that kind of<br />
restraint that lends strength and dignity to any organisaticn.<br />
We need to remember that what may take years to build, can be<br />
easily destroyed. The very definition of coalition implies<br />
the possibility of differences. I have made the point often.<br />
But I cannot recall any federal policy issues that have been<br />
decided on party lines.<br />
There are no instances where Liberal policy has been hampered<br />
in it execution by the existence of the coalition. These are<br />
testi_-ng times for our party. It is doubtful if ever before,<br />
in Deace time Australia, other than in the immediate post-war<br />
period, has a covernment been handed such a wretched legacy<br />
as -we received in 1975.<br />
Yet iln the last four years we have Come a long way. A sense<br />
of achievement, optimism and faith in our future has been<br />
reborn amongst Australians.<br />
But, this is no time for self-congratulation. Our responsibility<br />
now ~ s more viLtal than ever. The sweeping successes of the<br />
last two elections must not lead us to believe that a Liberal<br />
future is secure and unchallengeable. Our hard-won victories<br />
of the ptwill be hollow,-. if -the~ y lead u, into c -lacenct! in<br />
the future. What we need now is now effort, continuing<br />
co-operation and a commitment to priorities which will benefit<br />
all of us.<br />
If we really value security for our children and our families<br />
in the future; if we understand that the well-being of the<br />
nation rests upon economic stability and growth; if we accept<br />
that, central to true democracy, is the proper functioning<br />
of State Governments, and if we believe that these goals can<br />
only be achieved by putting Liberal principles into work in<br />
Government, then which of us, by our own actions, is prepared<br />
to take a course, to pursue an argument, to make decisions<br />
which will jeopardise these great Liberal objectives and ideals?<br />
The only thing that can damage us is division amongst ourselves.<br />
Make no mistake, the Australian electorate takes a dim view of<br />
political divisiveness. Harmony is an essential ingredient to<br />
political success. The A. L. P. has shown us time and again that<br />
internal political division is political death.<br />
Amongst oureelves we have had some discussions in recent times<br />
about coalition arrangements. Let me say that the criticism<br />
of those arrangements has always come from those who do not<br />
have to be, and have not been part of a coalition.<br />
8 </p>
<p>9<br />
I understand completely the frustrations and difficulties<br />
within our State where the Liberal Party governs in its own right.<br />
I condemn as unconscionable the allocation of preferences to<br />
the Labor Party by an anti-Socialist party. I condemn as<br />
unconscionable the use of open tickets by the National Party.<br />
In years past I was a member of the State Executive and I<br />
understand the State's iewpoint completely. But acknowledging<br />
all that it is not just an accident that through almost<br />
thirty years of federal coalition, Ministers' seats have<br />
not been contested by candidates from the coalition partner.<br />
The art of the successful coalition imposes certin obvious<br />
requirements. We are one Government, with one policy, supported<br />
by all members of the coalition.<br />
There is loyalty amongst the Ministry which enshrines the<br />
notion of collective responsibility. Without this, the<br />
Government and the Ministry would fall apart.<br />
At election time we go to the people as a coalition government<br />
with a common policy and purpose. Together, we defend our record<br />
and proclaim our position for the future. What is the position<br />
then, if a member of our party seeks to stand against a Minister<br />
representing our coalition partner?<br />
This would lead to criticism of the Minister, who would be forced<br />
to respond. Let me take it a step further. What do<br />
Mini sterial colleagues do in this position?<br />
Here is a challenger from their own party. Normally one would<br />
expect that they support their own party colleague. But let me<br />
say that Ministers within a government cannot be on conflicting<br />
sides in an election. There would be no trust around the table<br />
&gt; ii ni.; tcer knew that his coalition ar-ncr with Ministerial<br />
support was seeking to defeat him in an election.<br />
There would be no coalition in this instance.<br />
If a Minister from one party starts campaigning to defeat<br />
a Ministerial colleague, the strains placed on the coalition<br />
would be unbearable. In these circumstances Ministers either<br />
have to support. their Ministerial colleague or support their<br />
own party. They cannot do both.<br />
Either way there would be conflict and division. Such a contest<br />
would not be a mere Jocal matter. It would be national news.<br />
It would be an act which defied all the traditions of three<br />
decades of successful coalition government decades of<br />
achievement unparalleled in Australia's political history. </p>
<p>10<br />
It would place at risk not just the future of the Liberal<br />
Party; not just the future of coalition government; but the<br />
future of all Australians; who seek from political leadership<br />
sound and effective government. This is a risk which, I<br />
believe, no member of the Liberal Party, or the National Party<br />
is entitled to take. No individual, no party, is more<br />
important than Australia and its future.<br />
Over the years many great and important issues have come<br />
before this State Council. Aware of its traditions, and in<br />
a spirit of informed debate, council has passed judgement on<br />
matters of regional, state and national importance. It has a<br />
proud record of acting with a sense of responsibility which<br />
is reflected in the success of the Liberal Party in Victoria<br />
for many years. Matters before us today are of genuine national<br />
importance and I urge you in your considerations to follow our<br />
proud traditions.<br />
A Coalition that seeks a sense of unity and stability from the<br />
nation must demonstrate these qualities itself. The challenge<br />
confronting us now is great. Our response as a party must<br />
demonstrate the measure of our greatness. Now is the time for<br />
all of us, in both coalition parties, to galvanise all our<br />
political and physical resources so that the anti-socialist<br />
forces in Australia can lead this nation productively through<br />
the demanding decade ahead.<br />
As we approach this new decade, we should rightly feel some<br />
exhilaration at what it will provide. We are ready for its<br />
challenges. To our abundance of individual and natural<br />
resources we need to add a sense of unity and purpose.<br />
Our victories in the future will only be equal to the discipline<br />
we apply in search of them.<br />
With this in mind, we need in 1980, to work with every sens<br />
of confidence; and commitment; to see that the mental and<br />
spiritual attitudes which underlie our Liberal movement, become<br />
the driving force behind the efforts of all Australians, in the<br />
next decade and beyond. oooOooo---</p>
