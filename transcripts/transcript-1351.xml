PRIMiE MTINISTER'S VISIT TO U. S. AND U. K.<br />
Press Conference given by the Prime Minister, d<br />
ir. Harold Holt, at Australia House,<br />
London 7th July, 1966.<br />
HOLT: There are several matters which we might cover this<br />
mTorning but 7 thought it might be useful : if I opened up with so;: e<br />
discussion on three topics which are of special interest to us in<br />
Australia and which I know have attracted a good deal of attention<br />
here. First perhaps I should say a word about how I cone to be<br />
here at this time. I have been, thanks to their kind suggestion<br />
to that effect, in fairly frequent direct communication with both<br />
the Prime Minister, Mr. Wilson, and the Presicent, Mr. Johnson.<br />
My predecessor, Sir Robert Menzies, had developed over<br />
the years a basis of intimate consultation with successive United<br />
States Presidents and Prime Ministers of this country and I was<br />
delighted to fiad that both Mir. Wilson and Mr. Johnson proposed<br />
to me when I took office that I continue with them on the same<br />
oasis of direct personal commjunication. But even the most frank<br />
and forthcoming exchanges of correspondence can't be an effective<br />
substitute for personal contact. I had met MLr. A.. ilson ., hen I was<br />
over here last year, as Treasurer, and I had not previously had<br />
the opportunity of meeting President Johnson. So it seemed<br />
important to the three of us that we should get to know each<br />
other better, and this has been the principal purpose of my<br />
journey to Europe this time.<br />
There are several matters in both countries which we<br />
felt we could discuss with advantage to each other. I've already<br />
been to the United States. I m. iust say that the outcome there<br />
exceeded by most hopeful expectations., not only have vwe<br />
developed a closer understanding of each o. her's attitude of mindand<br />
this was not confined to the President but I did have an<br />
opportunity there of close consultation with Mr. McNamara,<br />
Secretary Ball, Mr, Fowler of the Treasury, Mr. Conior of<br />
Commerce and M! r. Averell Harriman, an old friend who has<br />
specialised in the works of South East Asia.<br />
I had the advantage of a very good talk with Dean Rusk,<br />
who was in Canberra for the SEATO Conference and so, having<br />
covered those various leading personalities of the Johnson<br />
Administration, I feel I am not only well informed as to their<br />
thinking but have this right up-to-the-minute. I believe it<br />
will be useful to have soue talk with the Prime Minister based<br />
on what I have gathered to be the views of the Administration of<br />
the United States.<br />
In the case of the United Kingdomi, Mr. Michael Stewart<br />
wa. out in Australia also, of course, for the SEATO Conference<br />
and we had a good talk together there. </p>
<p>2.<br />
I'm looking forward to renewing discussion and<br />
acquaintance with an old friend in Jim Callaghan, who laboured<br />
as I did vith his Treasury problems -, hen we were together in<br />
those respective capacities.<br />
I regret that Denis Healey, with whom we had such<br />
valuable discussions in Australia earlier in the year, will not<br />
be here but perhaps I can catch up with hiffiaer on in the year<br />
at the Prime Minister's Conference when it is held in this country.<br />
Now there are three matters which call for somo better<br />
understanding between our two governments and betwJeen our people<br />
and the people of this country. I don't need to stress to a<br />
British audience the warmth, friendliness, and indeed affcction<br />
on which our relationships are based.<br />
I've nent'oned the names of two other National Leaders<br />
President Johnson, Mr. Harold Wilson even my ovn four-letter<br />
name is an anglo-sacon derivation, and the three of us have come<br />
quite obviously from Anglo-Saxon stock at so, 1ie point of tim<br />
which should assist us to understand each other the better. And<br />
we're not to be discourageu by plain, frank and direct speech<br />
to each other we would feel we had less friendship for each<br />
other than exists were we not to proceed on the basis that we can<br />
speak freely and frankly and informatively about what is happening<br />
in our own counetries and what is shaping our policies.<br />
I possess, as do the rest of the people of my own<br />
country, a sympathetic awareness and indeed understanding of the<br />
major difficulties which the United Kingdom faces at this time<br />
economic difficulties, problems which have carried on, some of<br />
them, since the major effort of expenditure of wealth and huyan<br />
resources in two great world wars where you carried so much of the<br />
brunt of the burden of the fight for freedom. You will not find<br />
my own country either lacking in understanding or sympathy in<br />
the problems which have to be faced here. I come in no<br />
complaining mood, nor, indeed, to ask for anything in particular.<br />
I was able to say that to President Johnson.<br />
, while there are some matters which w'e hope will be<br />
carefully studied by the United Kingdom Govevnnient I have not come<br />
here expecting to go back with some particular changes of policy,<br />
but there are these matters which are worth mentioning and no<br />
doubt others will occur to you. First South Viet Nam.<br />
I suppose the view we bring to this matter is affected<br />
by our geography and our circumstances, but I bring to a<br />
European audience a view from " Down Under" where perhaps<br />
the perspective looks rather different than the view taken from<br />
this point of distance. We see the struggle going on in South<br />
Viet Nam, not merely as one : n resolving an issue in that<br />
disturbed, co-iplex country, but as one affecting South East Asia<br />
generally and, indeed, ultimately Asia as a whole periapg even<br />
finally the peace and economic progress and stabiliti. of the%<br />
world as a whole.<br />
' ie know the arguments about whether this is a Civil War<br />
or whether the particular Administration presently in charge of'<br />
affairs could be relied upon to maintain stability of goverryent. </p>
<p>The fact of the matter is that, for all its difficulty<br />
after the Geneva accords of 195),, South Viet Nan did make steady<br />
progress and, indeed, one of the factors influencing the<br />
uggression from, North Viet Nai., wras the contrast betw , een the<br />
steadily progressive South Viet Nam, with its production rising<br />
usefully, and the failure to sustain production in North Viet Nam.<br />
But it's not the story of a particuilar issue involving South<br />
Viet Nam solely that would be justification enough if we were<br />
to stand by the principles which brought my own country into<br />
two world wars alnd saw us fighting in Korea to protect another<br />
country under threat of coi-umist aggression at that timae. Going<br />
beyond that, is in our judgement the future of the kind of Asia<br />
which we have in South East Asia generally, and throughout the<br />
world as a whole. A" nd so don't be surprised if differences of<br />
view develop between us. de feel very strongly about this.<br />
You will f ind those in my ow. n country who take a<br />
different attitude but I can only point to the expressions of<br />
public opinion, such as we ar-c able to ascertain them, which on<br />
the last two showings have revealed. stronger support for my own.<br />
government whose policies on this matter are so clear a degree<br />
of support ,, hich has reached the highest point we have -known in<br />
the history of my own Party, and this has been confirmed over the<br />
last poll takings.<br />
Well, they are not conclusive, as we know, but certainly<br />
the goverinent is firma as was the govern-ment of -ay predecessor,<br />
Sir Robert Menzies, and three successive Presidents of the United<br />
States. It's worth remembering, that. This is not the policy<br />
of any one man. Three successive Presidents have given support<br />
to the policies which are now in effect in Viet Nan..<br />
So don't find it surprising if there was disappointment<br />
in Australia that it was felt necessary to dissociate this<br />
country from the recent military action, taken principally on<br />
military grounds and with the utmost care, as I know, exercised<br />
to confine civilian damage to the barest minimum. And, surely,<br />
if one is involved in operations of war and there is an item of<br />
supply so basic to transportation and efficient conduct of<br />
hostile operations against your own forces as petrol and oil<br />
installations, that these becomae legitimate military targets.<br />
Now we find it difficult to Lnderstand how at the same<br />
time there can be su3port for the general policies which have<br />
brought our own forces I'm speaking now particularly of the<br />
American forces plus those other friendl-forces supporting<br />
the South Vietnamese who are there in such considerable numberswe<br />
find it difficult to reconcile that expression of support<br />
with the criticism which came at a time when the United States<br />
was feeling that it needed international backing for the<br />
causes it is pursuing.<br />
The United Kingdom has carried a considerable burden<br />
itself in South-East Asia in order to preserve stability,<br />
particularly in relation to Mialaysai and in containing<br />
aggressive conduct on the part of Indonesia. </p>
<p>dvhen I was expressing in America the other day so.-e<br />
critical coni ; ents on the failure of qfestern European countries<br />
to face up to their responsibilities in that area of the world<br />
I did not, of co: rse, have in mind the United Kingdom-which has<br />
contributed in so many ways the military establishment it has<br />
had in the area and the considerable civilian aid that has also<br />
been given through the Colombo Plan and in other ways but I<br />
used the phrase, and I don't run away from it. I used the phrase<br />
in America that in my judgment some of the countries of western<br />
Europe who have most cause to be grateful to the United States<br />
for the reccnstruction of their own economies ' Tde possible by<br />
the Marshall Aid Programme, and who themselves have the interest<br />
that countries have internationally in stability and peace in a<br />
substantial a'rea of the world I said of them that I believed<br />
them to be " coasting" on the United States effort.<br />
If the United States werc not there in its current<br />
strength these other countries, could not afford to have Asia<br />
turned into a coi. ummnist thiefdorm, and I would hope they could<br />
search their minds and their consciences on this issue. It is<br />
entirely unreasonable that this one country should be expected<br />
to carry so much of the burden.<br />
There are altogether, as of the last count that I could<br />
make, some 3-countries in 6outh Viet Nai giving assistance in one<br />
form or another, a few giving military assistance, others giving<br />
some material assistance, and I don't think the United States is<br />
looking for massive assistance, but it is looking for understanding<br />
for recognition that it is carrying out a task that is of benefit<br />
to the free world as a whole, and it would welcome the moral<br />
support, at least, of those who have been grateful for the<br />
strength America has brought to the struggle for freedom in two<br />
European wars. For our own part, I-think this is the first time in the<br />
history of my country that our owrvnorces have been engaged in<br />
military operations in which they have not been fighting in<br />
association with forces of the United Kingdom, and this too is<br />
a matter for regret by us. But we have recognised the substantial<br />
contribution the United Kingdo; m has been required to<br />
make while the confrontation issue persisted.<br />
Now moving from there to the issue which, in shorthand<br />
terms, is referred to as " East of Suez", we have been thinking<br />
not so much in military terns as we have ourselves commentedwith<br />
concern on the growning strength of opinion which seems to<br />
exist on both sides of politics in this country and that the<br />
United Kingdom should reduce its influence, its interest, its<br />
activity in that area of the world.<br />
In the military side the discussions we had with Mr.<br />
Denis Healey, produced a resalt that was satisf: ctory from my<br />
own government s point of view and we had that position<br />
confirmed and clarified, again to our complete satisfaction by<br />
by Harold , ilson quite recently. </p>
<p>But its the growing body of opinion in a country which<br />
throughout its history has felt part of the world scheme of<br />
things, which has been able to play so often a decisive part and,<br />
of course, sofre quently an influential part, because to us it<br />
seems to be turning ones back on a very large part or life.<br />
After all, there are currently 1-biliion people East of Suez<br />
and that about half the total population of the world. Their<br />
proportion of it is tending to grow rapidly as methods of<br />
better hygiene, of public health, increase a life expectancy, and<br />
this aced tI the natural fertility of the countries in the area<br />
will produce, in all probability a doubling of that population<br />
by the end cf the century.<br />
There is no place, as Mr. Denis Healey said, where there<br />
are more dangers of military operations or hostilities breaking<br />
out, but there is no place in the world also where there is more<br />
dynamism, more stir, more potential for growth in a variety of<br />
useful ways. * Ive in Australia recognise the challenges but we also<br />
see the enormous opportunities, and I woader just how far there is<br />
realisation in this country of what is going on and what it can<br />
mean if good fortune holds, if we are able to take advantage of<br />
opportunities for peaceful economic progress in the future.<br />
Let me just mention by way of illustration Australia's<br />
situation with Japan. Since the 1950' s our trade with Japan has<br />
increased 4. times. It runs second to the United Kingdom as an<br />
importer of Australian goods at the moment, but on present trends<br />
in won't be very much longer before Japan becomes the principal<br />
customer in the world for Australian goods.<br />
Our trade in the countries East of Suez has increased<br />
from about 15 per cent in the early 1950' s to something over<br />
33 per cent today and the trend is strongly upward, and so<br />
involved militarily at a number of points involved in various<br />
aid programmes, involved to an increasing degree in tho<br />
organisations which are now er.,. rging in South East Asia.<br />
SEATO, of course, has been in operation for some<br />
considerable time, the civilian aid programies under the Colombo<br />
plan, they have been continuing for quite some time, but we have<br />
new organisations of which the so-named ASPAC is the most recent<br />
example, which held its conference at Seoul with Japan, South<br />
Korea, South Viet Nan, Taiwan, Philippines, M1alaysia, Thailand,<br />
Australia and New Zealand, all present conducting a very useful<br />
and s', ccessful conference together.<br />
How many people are aware that the Asian Development<br />
Bank looks like being successfully launched shortly with an<br />
initial capital of a billion dollars of which the United States<br />
wili have subscribed a couple of hundred million, Japan committed<br />
itself to 200 million, and my own country for 85 million dollars.<br />
Quite recently Japan concluded an arrangement with South Korea<br />
in which 800 million dollars of credits were to be extended to<br />
So. th Korea. In South Vietnam itself, concurrently with the military<br />
operations, there are positive programmes of civic action, rural<br />
development, village development going on as part of the positive,<br />
constructive side of what is happening in South East Asia today. </p>
<p>Ie are ourselves engaged in prograrmmes of road<br />
construction in Borneo, in Thailand, and these are merely<br />
illustrations of the growing volurne of co-operation which is<br />
occurring in that part of the world. And the events are moving<br />
so rapidly that I am coming to the conclusion that we are more<br />
likely to got a disj~ osition to peace on the part of the North<br />
Vietnamese particularly if they are as much subject to influence,<br />
as we believe, from commnunist China than the outcome of the<br />
military ope~ rations themselves because there are intelligent<br />
people in all camps whether behind curtaiis on one side or the<br />
other. W4e can't divide the world sensibly into the " goodies"<br />
and the " badu. ies". I'm convinced that there iiust be thoughtful<br />
people in China who are realising that their programmes have been<br />
failing in other parts of the world, they have had their se. Lious<br />
setbacks in Africa, in Indonosia, and they can see a growing body of<br />
co-operation in South East Asia, in particular, right round the<br />
arc from South Korea through Taiwan, the Philippines, Thailcand.<br />
Malaysia, our own country and New Zealand, strengthening all ' the<br />
time, buildig up an economnic strength, and stimulated to do o<br />
because we feel that together the thlreat of what China, unless<br />
halted, could mean to all of us in the future.<br />
And I think they're close to a cross-road were they've<br />
got to make up their minds that they either join in a growing.<br />
economic society in that part of the world or take the other<br />
path at the cross-roads and stand aloof fro-R these developmerns<br />
with a steady hardening of hostility toward them. Now we would<br />
hope that they woLd have the good sense to see that the time<br />
has come to review existing policies and what we say of communist<br />
China goes for the coimmunist world as a whole.<br />
I was delighted to see the initiative being displayed<br />
by Mr. Harold W-ilson. Earlier in New York this week I was<br />
making the point myself that vwe have to search for ways and mleans<br />
of' making the curtains, iron and banboo, less exclusive, and make<br />
them at least penetrable by various processes which would lead<br />
to personal exchanges, to the development of scrie mutuality of<br />
interest. Trade is, of course, the outstanding example of one<br />
of the ways in which this mutuality of benefit arid interest can<br />
be developed. My own country, despite well-known views against<br />
communist aggression, sees nothing inconsistent in trading with<br />
corimunist China, any more than we felt this when we kept open a<br />
channel of friendship to Indonesia, despite the fact that we had<br />
forces meeting theirs in their confrontation tactics.<br />
Through Trade, tourism, more frequent visits by press<br />
representatives, scientific and cultural exchanges, in the<br />
variety of ways that can build up some lessening of tension<br />
and spirit of conflict, we must take advantage of these<br />
opportunities and I wish the Prime Minister well on his forthcoming<br />
journey. Now the other matter which I thought I might mention<br />
just briefly to you, because I know there is great interest<br />
in it, is that of British capital i nvestment. </p>
<p>7.<br />
British cOapital investment in Australia has been the major element<br />
in our total of overseas investment. ffe don't wait for the<br />
investment to come to us, 90% of fixed capital investment in<br />
Australia derives from Australian sources.<br />
WVe are surpassed, I think, only by Japan in the degree<br />
to which we withhold from consumption a percentage of our gross<br />
national product. Last year this reached 26.7%. the comparable figure<br />
for the United States was 16.7% and for the United Kingdom 16.7%. So<br />
you will gather from that figure that we are doing a great deal to<br />
help ourselves. But it's the remaining 10% that has been of<br />
tremendous importance to us, because it has imainly enabled us to<br />
finance larger projects, new types of enterprise and has contributed<br />
significantly to a more balanced, more highly diversified economy.<br />
Now, over the years since the end of the war, the<br />
United Kingdom has been responsible for nnre than half the rotal<br />
volume of investment the figure would be well in excess of<br />
800,000,000 sterling in that time and although the percentage has<br />
dropped a little relative to dollar investment in recent years, the<br />
United Kingdom is still the largest investor in our country.<br />
One of the questions I will be discussing with the<br />
Prime Minister is the ostimates made here of the length of time which<br />
it is felt that these restraints should operate. I would hope to be<br />
able to show that there is considerable benefit tothe United Kingdom<br />
from the continuance of this investment. Evevlafe 60, C3O, 000<br />
sterling a year contributing to your own balance of payments assets<br />
from outside sources come from profits in Australia, and, as is wellknown,<br />
most of our own earnings overseas, when they end up in the<br />
form of reserves, are held as sterling reserves.<br />
I've never felt it a very useful negotiation myself to<br />
try to ask people just to do som~ ething for you in the absence of a<br />
consideration flowing the other way but I think here, that in this<br />
question of overseas -investment by the United Kingdom in Australia,<br />
there is powerful argument in support of the view that it is in both<br />
the current and long-tern interest of this country to keep that<br />
process going. I want to see it going for a variety of other reasons,<br />
and one of the most important of these is that with the investment<br />
comes the outflow also of executive leadership and personalities<br />
people of quality and character associated with a new enterprise.<br />
ie welcome this as part of our own community life, and I<br />
think of so many outstanding Englishmen who are part of the Australian<br />
community and helping to enrich that community in the quality of<br />
British character and the experience and wisdom that the British<br />
people can bring to others when they associate with them.<br />
' Ve have enjoyed that, we want to go on enjoying it. WNe<br />
think it's important for you as well as for us that the British<br />
influence in our community life be strongly maintained. We've been<br />
welcoming in the post-war years a million migrants from this country<br />
and we would also like to feel that the type oi executive or artisan<br />
who comes to Australia with British enterprise which, in turn,<br />
is in the statistics as an item of capital investment, thatthi. s<br />
would continue and I shall be putting this viewpoint to the<br />
Prime Minister. </p>
<p>I knaow the difficulties of my colleague, the Chancellor,<br />
he has my sympathy. I used to say to him. " I'd much prefer to<br />
have my own problems as Treasurer frof those of the Chancellor<br />
of the United Kingdom." 1<br />
We fortunately have been having a rathcr miore comfortable<br />
experience on our own balance of payments despite the currency<br />
of a quite serious drought, the worst we've had for just on<br />
years, which reduced our sheep population by just on 85,, from<br />
170,000,000 to 157,000,000 and in New S3outh , iales reduced the cattle<br />
population by just on 255.<br />
But fortunately the economy is diversified these days to<br />
a point where we could take almost in stride what would have<br />
been a disastrous experience 10 or 20 years before. And there's<br />
the very considerable mineral projects now in process of coming<br />
to full production and when they bring their export earning to<br />
the total we feel that our position will become even stronger<br />
in the years ahead.<br />
Now the final cormment I want to leave in your minds is<br />
that we believe that there are stirring, exciting thing,: happening<br />
with alrmost dazzling rapidity in an area of the w orld which<br />
contains, T repeat, just on half of the worlds population.<br />
vie are placed geographically and, as a consequence of friendly<br />
relations with so many countries in the area, strongly able to<br />
take advantage of the opportunities which will develop, Ve think<br />
its in the interests of this country to see Australia take<br />
advantage of' those opportunities and if British capital or British<br />
migration would pronote those purposes anid, in turn, lead to the<br />
strengthening of the sterling area generally and the British<br />
position throughout the world, then I'm sure that if we have the<br />
facts and the case to support British action, we won't be<br />
receiving an unsympathetic ear when we come to the Leaders of the<br />
Government in your country.<br />
Now I've taken up a lot of your time. Over to you in<br />
case there are other subjects you would like to develop.<br />
SQUIRE BARRACLOUGH ( DAILY EXPRESS): One of the grouses of<br />
people over here, Mr. Holt is that Australia herself is riot<br />
spending money on defence. Have you any com. mient to make on that?<br />
NR. HOLT: W~ e do have a combined objective of developing a continent<br />
the si7. e of the United States of Amierica with under 1112 million<br />
people at the moment, but we have recognised the need to put<br />
increasing proportion of our resources to defence.<br />
The Treasurer told me just before I left Australia that<br />
over the next year or two our defence expenditure would be close<br />
to 5% of C. N. P. I think your objective is to get yours down<br />
to ) 45 of G. N. P.<br />
le have doubled our defence expenditure over the last<br />
three years and this is not easy when you have the combined<br />
tasks that-I've mientioned and it's part of the explanation<br />
why we hav. to withhold a much larger percentage of our G. N. P.<br />
from consun . tion than is the case in this country.<br />
Our population growth rate is slightly over 2% o cormpared with<br />
.8 of 1% in this country. I </p>
<p>I tried to make some estimate of how many more houses<br />
you would need to build each year if you had a 2% growth rate<br />
instead of .8 of 1% but houses, schools, hospitals and the other<br />
amenities of a modern cor-cmunity, when they have to be provided on<br />
double the scale in one country as against anothcr, clearly have<br />
some bearing on what you can do in other directions at the same time.<br />
MAJOR HIITTERHOFF ( TABLET): You painted a very fascinating picture of<br />
the growing co-operation among the nations of a vast area from Japan<br />
tc New Zealand. You also said that 74 countries are assisting the<br />
United States<br />
HOLT ( intcrjecting): 344. s<br />
MAJOR HINTERHOFF:-3. countries assisting the United States in Viet Nam.<br />
My question is why no advantage could be taken from these forces for<br />
Formosa?<br />
DER. HOLT: \ V4ell, I think the reasoning behind that can be deduced<br />
I'm not speaking with authority or knowledge precisely of what went<br />
on in the minds of those who resolve these things but I imagine<br />
that this would be regarded in their ys by Chin as a highly<br />
provocative act. If you are concerned s to whether China would be<br />
drawn into the conflict I don't think anything would be likely to<br />
bring China in quicker than for them to feel that this was not merely<br />
support by Taiwan but could possibly be converted eventually into an<br />
attack on the mainland of China itself. Certainly the Taiwanese have<br />
been entirely willing to give support.<br />
FISHER ( THO11PSON NE'FSPAPERS): \, hat is your feeling about the refusal of<br />
Chancellor Callaghan to allow conipanies to operate in Australia<br />
to let them have their headquarters in Australia, such as N~ w Broken<br />
Hill?<br />
KilR. HOLT: This is a matter of discussion likely to arise between<br />
us. Possibly the main burden of the discussion will have to be borne<br />
by my colleague, the Treasurer, when he is across a little later in<br />
the year, but we feel that with the activities being carried on in<br />
Australia it's a reasonable thing that taxation should be levied at<br />
that source. But I'm not going to try and pre-judge any particular<br />
case. We are dealing with fair-mird ipeople, and if we have a case,<br />
then we should be able to secure satisfaction from it. I notice that<br />
one decisi'n recently affecting one of the gold-mining companies took<br />
a favourable view from Australia's standpoint.<br />
MURRAY ( LIVERPOOL DAILY POST): You described the attitude of the United<br />
States when you elaborated on point 1. Can we assume that this is<br />
what President Johnson told you?<br />
,1R. HOLT: You can assume that th. s is the assessment I have<br />
gathered in my discussions with IMembers of the Administration, but<br />
I'm not going to discuss individual Members or their views.<br />
I don't think I would need to be a James Bond to convey that<br />
intelligence to the United Kingdom. I'm sure they have assessed<br />
that for thezselves. </p>
<p>LL1E, ( SUN): You seem to have expressed some regret that British<br />
troops aren' t fighting alongside the Australians and Americans<br />
in Viet Nap.. If I read you right, do you think Vhat they should be,<br />
especially as some British troops are go1ig to * be released from their<br />
duties in the Malaysia-Indonesia set-up?<br />
Mt. HOLT: I mentioned as a matter of historical fact that this was<br />
the first occasion tlat there has been a very effective use made of<br />
British troops in the confrontation problem and we have understood<br />
right through the piece that these farces, having been built up<br />
1l: rgely to iieet tlhLc confrontation issue, would be reduced after that<br />
issue had been satisfactorily resolved. It's a little early to say<br />
that it has, as a matter of fact, I think, but developments are moving<br />
in the right direction. I am not aware of any finality of judgenent<br />
to which the United Kingdom has coi~ le as to the disposition of its<br />
forces subsequently. One matter on this which I think might be touched on,<br />
and that is the view which seems to be held in some quarters here,<br />
anyway, about Thailand, that somehow or other Thailand is not<br />
entitled to the same support because the form of government it<br />
possesses doesnt appeal to some people. I've seen a good deal of<br />
the Leaders of the Government of Thailand. This year we had a visit<br />
to Australia from the Prime Minister, Mr. Thanom Kittikachorn, and<br />
Mr. Thanat Khoman his very able Foreign Minister and Pote Sarasin,<br />
who was for some years the Secretary-General of SEATO and then,<br />
having goiie myself to South Viet Nam~, in the course of a journey I<br />
made to adjacent areas, I returned that visit.<br />
It was a symptom of the growing, spirit of cooperation<br />
that I spoke of earlier that I was invited as the first<br />
foreigner in Thai history to sit in the Cabinet with their government,<br />
and from what I have learned personally in my associations with<br />
these men we are fortunate that there is such a capable body of men<br />
at the present time in charge of a Government that is playing such an<br />
increasingly influential role in the area.<br />
You may have noted that the Thais provided the venue<br />
for consultations between Mr. Malik of Indonesia and Tun Razak<br />
of Malaysia, and they were active in this recent conference in<br />
Seoul, in a variety of ways over recent months they've made a very<br />
useful contribution. It may be that they have a form of government<br />
which is a military dictatorship, but if the Prime Minister were to<br />
conduct a general election on the same basis as ourselves I think<br />
he would poll something over 90 per cent of the vote.<br />
He's a-very popular leader in his own country, hi*<br />
owni country is making very good progress, it has greatly<br />
strengthened itself economically, and recently they have decided<br />
upon a degree of military participation in South Viet Nam.<br />
So I wo!_ ld just utter a word of caution against being<br />
critical of the Government or allowing that to become a foundational<br />
aspect of policy determination.<br />
They can make, and will make, I think, a growig<br />
contribution of strength and economic prcgress and stability in<br />
South E~ ast Asia. </p>

STOKES, ( BBC CUR1ENT AFFAIRS): 14r. Prime Minister, you've referred<br />
to the growing size mnd importance of coummunist China, and to<br />
the need to search for ways and means to make the iron and the<br />
bamboo curtains more penetrable. Does this mean that your<br />
government is re-considering its attitude towards the reco. gnition<br />
of China, and its admission to the United Nations?<br />
MR. HOLT: Well, when you say reconsidering it, that matter had been<br />
considered on a number of occasions. My own view has always been<br />
that this qu.-stion is one which ought to be resolved in a wider<br />
settlement, a more gcnieral arrangement it which wie would have . a<br />
clearer view of the future intention of conaiiunist China. There is<br />
the problem of the Taiwanese, Australia would certainly not be<br />
sympathetic towards a-result which abandoned the Taiwanese, and<br />
th~ re are complications which have to be borne in our thinking<br />
and our accounting, but we haven't got a closed mind on this matter.<br />
But while we have people maintaining philosophy in which they are<br />
talking about power growing out of the barrel of a gun and that<br />
wars of national liberation can be the pattern for expansion of<br />
cormxanist influence generally throughout the world, it seems a<br />
little odd that you are embracing them.<br />
STOKES: Not embracing, recognising.<br />
MvIR. HOLT: Recagising aell, we sell them a lot of wheat and<br />
wool, we recognise them to that extent.<br />
MONKS, ( SYDNEY '. t,-1ORNI\ IG HERALD): MP.' r. Prime Minister, Tun Abdul<br />
Razak has been saying today that he and Mr. Healey have agr'eed on<br />
measures for the withdrawal of British troops from Sabah ard<br />
Sarawak. Has Australia been consulted on this, and have you any<br />
coif.!. ents to make on the scale of possible British withdrawals<br />
from this region?<br />
MR. HOLT: Viell, you can take it that Australia is closely<br />
consulted on whatever happens around that area, not only by the<br />
United Kingdom Government, but we are on very friendly and close<br />
terms with the government of Malaysia so you can safely assume<br />
that whatever is going on there you will ae pretty well informed<br />
about but I'm afraid I've not been directly in contact with<br />
the latest developments myself, so I can't give you a precise<br />
answer to your question.<br />
CORBET ( TIMES): Last year, Prime Minister, you took quite a lead<br />
in asserting the right of the less industrialised nations to<br />
be heard on the question of an international liquidity issue.<br />
Could you give us your reactions to the mneeting of cohmion market<br />
ministers in Rom~ e which decided th: t there should be no increase<br />
in the world's monetary resources until the United States ard.<br />
British deficits had been eliminated a view which was<br />
subsequently endorsed by the group of ten deputies meeting<br />
in Frankfurt, and could you more generally give as your views<br />
on how these discussions have been going?<br />
1-2. HOLT: The general views of the Government have not changed<br />
since I expressed them last year. </p>
<p>12.<br />
This question of international liquidity concerns us<br />
all because it seems to me to be unnecessarily fouled up by<br />
these attitudes in Europe arnd elsewhere. In other words you<br />
don't get the feeling that it is being faced in a completely<br />
objective way. Now we have always supported the fund as the<br />
principal source for leadership and guidance on this issue and<br />
ior that reason you do tend to get a broader, more objective<br />
view of requirements than would be taken by some special group<br />
which had its own interests principally and almost exclusively<br />
in its thinking.<br />
CORBET: In short, you would like the whole matter taken out<br />
of the hands of the committee of<br />
MfR. HOLT: We have all along asserted that the final responsibility,<br />
or at least the judgement on this matter, should rest with the<br />
fund rather than with any more limited group, and indeed the<br />
substance of my speech last year at the meeting was that the<br />
countries and there are more than 100 of us altogether<br />
against, say, the ten that you are speaking of they hfAve<br />
interests as well in this question, which can be better<br />
protected by the fund than by any other body we can point to.<br />
Q. Would you mind clarifying your remarks when you said<br />
you thought China was very close to the cross-roads where you<br />
felt it must join the economic society of the area. Do you<br />
envisage it as a member of the Asian Dievelopment Bank or Aspac?<br />
MvlR. HiOLT: No, I didn't say that was the thinking of the Chinese<br />
themselves. What I'm saying is that these co-operative<br />
organisations, the spirit of collaboration in friendly trade<br />
and that. sort of thing this is developing so fast, in the area<br />
and the projections of trade trends tend to confirm this that<br />
the Chinese must surely be giving some thought to whether they<br />
can afford this process to continue in such a way that you have<br />
regional associations from which they are excluded, strengthening<br />
the economies of these other countries and the other<br />
countries having a unity of interest which currently is as much<br />
based on 10: ncn bot.!-rcr.' sao as any other factor.<br />
They could find themselves in ten years' time from now the odd<br />
man looking out against the r. st of Asia.<br />
Q. When you spoke about the Western nations " coasting"<br />
along on America, did you include France especially?<br />
1R. HOLT: Well, I don't think it needs much specification by<br />
me to range over a number of countries and certainly France was<br />
one which greatly benefitted from the marshall aid reconstruction<br />
programme and we very much regretted that France has not been<br />
able to give support to American efforts and has indeed been<br />
hostile to them.<br />
Now I don't know by what process of Gallic logic<br />
this has been decided but the United States is justifiably<br />
disappointed that there has been so little thought given when<br />
in principle they find as we find it hard to distinguish<br />
between the issues which arise in South Vietnam and the issues<br />
which arose in West Berlin and if it was justifiable for my<br />
small country to have nearly half a million casualties in two<br />
world warj to defend countries against aggression in Europe,<br />
and the United States paid hea. vily in those world wars also for<br />
a struggle fought thousands of miles from their shores, we<br />
would have expected a rather more sympathetic understanding.<br />
Wec do not go into these matters lightly nor unless we are<br />
convinced that great issues are at stake and must be defended. </p>
