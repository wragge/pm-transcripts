    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE....................</p>
<p>  Well, thank you very much, Vice Chancellor; to Mrs Terrell; to Lady Wilson;</p>
<p>   to Professor Ross Garnaut, my Parliamentary colleagues, the academic staff</p>
<p>   of the university, Your Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p>  This is an important occasion not only for the university but it's also</p>
<p>   an important Canberra occasion and also an important reflective occasion.</p>
<p>   Because as someone who is now celebrating his 26th year in the</p>
<p>   Federal Parliament the name Sir Roland Wilson first came to my attention</p>
<p>   when, as a fairly enthusiastic follower of politics in Australia in the</p>
<p>   1950s through the well known political names such as Menzies, Fadden, Evatt,</p>
<p>   Casey and others, there occasionally filtered through the names of one or</p>
<p>   two very senior and very influential Canberra based bureaucrats and public</p>
<p>   servants. And the two names, of course, that I first associated with the</p>
<p>   Federal bureaucracy as I gathered my political enthusiasm in the 1950s were,</p>
<p>   of course, the names of Coombs and Wilson who were, sort of, indubitably</p>
<p>   linked in the minds of so many people. Of course, if my memory serves me</p>
<p>   correctly, I think they were probably the last two names to appear on the</p>
<p>   pound note when that formed part of our currency and disappearing in 1966.</p>
<p>   I see Ian Castles nodding so I must be right in that recollection.</p>
<p>  Sir Roland Wilson had an extraordinary career in the public service. He</p>
<p>   was, in the best sense of that word, a dedicated professional servant of</p>
<p>   the Commonwealth. He gave unstintingly of his service and his loyalty to</p>
<p>   governments of both political persuasions. It is no secret that occasionally,</p>
<p>   after the change of government in 1949, the odd supporter of the Liberal</p>
<p>   Party was heard to say, isn't it strange that Menzies retained the services</p>
<p>   of those two bureaucrats, Coombs and Wilson, who served the Chifley government.</p>
<p>   It wasn't strange because they were people of great commitment. Their paths</p>
<p>   followed different directions. They had different views on many issues.</p>
<p>  Sir Roland Wilson's career stretched for a period of over 40 years. He was</p>
<p>   the first Secretary of the Department of Labor and National Service founded</p>
<p>   under the late Harold Holt in 1941. He was, as Professor Terrell has said,</p>
<p>   a person who dedicated himself very much to the operations of the international</p>
<p>   financial mechanism.</p>
<p>  The person who introduced us today, Professor Garnaut, made I thought a</p>
<p>   very intelligent reflection on the Australian economy, historically speaking,</p>
<p>   a few months ago when he said that he thought there had probably been three</p>
<p>   great eras of economic activity and development in the federation of Australia.</p>
<p>   The first of those stretched from federation and ended in the trenches of</p>
<p>   World War I. The second began in the period of post-war reconstruction and</p>
<p>   then the boom and continued until the early 1970s. And he was kind enough</p>
<p>   to say that he thinks we might now be living in the third era but I won't</p>
<p>   dwell on that. But the importance of that recollection, ladies and gentlemen,</p>
<p>   is that for the great bulk of that second period Sir Roland Wilson was,</p>
<p>   of course, the dominant economic adviser to governments. And if you were</p>
<p>   searching for somebody who made a contribution to the economic stability</p>
<p>   and the economic prosperity, the extraordinary high levels of employment</p>
<p>   and the great levels of economic growth that occurred during that period</p>
<p>   of time you couldn't go past the contribution he made, particularly during</p>
<p>   the years that he was the Secretary to the Treasury.</p>
<p>  I only had an opportunity of meeting him on a few occasions because he had</p>
<p>   departed from the bureaucratic scene, the professional public service scene,</p>
<p>   by the time I arrived in Parliament. When I became Treasurer of the Commonwealth</p>
<p>   late in 1977 Sir Frederick Wheeler was then coming towards the end of his</p>
<p>   time as Secretary to the Treasury. So my acquaintance with him was brief.</p>
<p>   I have read a lot of him and I'm conscious, as anybody who's been part of</p>
<p>   the Government of this country in the post World War II period, I am very</p>
<p>   conscious of the immense contribution that he's made to the public life</p>
<p>   of our country and the way in which he has served, loyally, the Commonwealth</p>
<p>   in the best traditions of public service. And it is an occasion for me as</p>
<p>   the current Prime Minister to record on behalf of all governments that were</p>
<p>   served by him how much we are in his debt.</p>
<p>  The school and the building to be named after him, as Professor Terrell</p>
<p>   has said, produces or manifests some very important linkages between the</p>
<p>   University and the Government. The programme that brings so many young people</p>
<p>   in touch with the day to day workings of the Government is a living and</p>
<p>   very contemporary expression of the importance of keeping the university</p>
<p>   and academic life of the country in touch with the workings of government</p>
<p>   and, equally, instilling in those who work in government an understanding</p>
<p>   of the importance and the role of academic life within our community. It's</p>
<p>   also important that there is the Asian regional link as well because even</p>
<p>   more so than in Wilson's time the prosperity of the Asian Pacific region</p>
<p>   is fundamental to the prosperity and strength of the Australian economy.</p>
<p>   And although the Asian Pacific region has gone through difficult times in</p>
<p>   recent years it will forever be important to Australia's future and how</p>
<p>   we relate to that region, how we trade in that region, how we continue to</p>
<p>   be good neighbours and good players and good regional mates in that region</p>
<p>   is very important indeed to our economic future.</p>
<p>  For all of those reasons, Professor, I'm delighted to be here. I thank the</p>
<p>   University for asking me to come. I'm delighted to be here in the presence</p>
<p>   of Lady Wilson because she provides the very visible link with the University,</p>
<p>   this school, and her late husband. And it's an opportunity for me to say</p>
<p>   again how much he is admired in the history of the government of this country</p>
<p>   over the last 50 years and what an immense contribution he's made and just</p>
<p>   how important and appropriate it is that the University should name this</p>
<p>   building after him. Thank you.</p>
