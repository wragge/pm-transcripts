JOINT APPEAL TO THE STATE PRESIDENT OF SOUTH AFRICA<br />
Mr State President<br />
we, the undersigned, call on you most urgently, and in the<br />
name of human compassion, to grant clemency to Mr Mangena<br />
Jeffrey Boesman who is, we understand, sentenced to be<br />
executed on Friday 29 September.<br />
we are strongly and universally opposed to imposition of the<br />
death penalty, which is an inhumane and degrading form of<br />
punishment in violation of the most fundamental of human<br />
rights the right to life. It is because of this that<br />
capital punishment has been abolished Federally and in all<br />
Australian States, and that the Australian Government<br />
regularly raises its concern over the death penalty with<br />
other governments.<br />
Moreover, in the case of Mangena Jeffrey Boesman we are<br />
deeply concerned that his execution would constitute a<br />
particularly severe injustice.<br />
We note that the case was originally heard by a single judge<br />
and leave to appeal was refused. We understand that<br />
Mr Boesman and his fellow accused were also severely<br />
disadvantaged at the start of their trial in November 1986<br />
by their lack of adequate legal representation, that State<br />
witnesses were drawn from among those present in the crowd<br />
and that such evidence might well therefore be tainted by<br />
fear of themselves being charged.<br />
You were able to commute the death sentences of two of his<br />
co-accused, and we urge you to do the same in the case of<br />
Mr Boesman.<br />
if Mr Boesman is executed, it will be seen by the world as<br />
the first political execution authorised by your new<br />
Government. It will also be a major blow to the prospects<br />
for peace and justice in South Africa.<br />
We have noted that in your inauguration statement you<br />
pledged yourself to a quest for peace in South Africa<br />
through fairness and justice. We consider that it would<br />
signal most clearly to the world that you are determined to<br />
pursue this quest if you are able to grant clemency in this<br />
case. We call on you most urgently to do so.<br />
