COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA<br />
SPEECH BY<br />
The Rt Hon. J. G. GORTON, M. P.<br />
ON<br />
GREAT BARRIER REEF<br />
INQUJIRY INTO DRILLING FOR PETROLEUM<br />
( Ministerial Statement)<br />
[ From the ' Parliamentary Debates', 5 May 1970]<br />
Mr GORTON ( Higgins-Prime Minister)<br />
-by leave-I am pleased to announce that<br />
the Premier of Queensland and I have<br />
agreed on the details of establishing Commonwealth<br />
and State royal commissions to<br />
inquire into the risk of damage to the Great<br />
Barrier Reef from drilling for petroleum.<br />
The royal commissions have been established<br />
under the Commonwealth's Royal<br />
Commissions Act 1902-1966 and the<br />
Queensland Commissions of Inquiry Acts<br />
1950 to 1954. The Commissioners and the<br />
terms of reference will be identical for each<br />
royal commission. The Commissioners are:<br />
The Honourable Sir Gordon Wallace,<br />
Sydney, New South Wales, Chairman; Dr<br />
James Eric Smith, Plymouth, England; and<br />
Mr Vincent John Moroney, Calgary,<br />
Canada. The terms of reference for the<br />
royal commissions are:<br />
Taking into account existing world<br />
technology in relation to drilling for<br />
petroleum and safety precautions<br />
relating thereto, what risk is there of<br />
an oil or gas leak in exploratory and<br />
production drilling for petroleum in<br />
the area of the Great Barrier Reef?<br />
What would be the probable effects<br />
of such an oil or gas leak and of the<br />
subsequent remedial measures on-<br />
The coral reefs themselves;<br />
The coastline;<br />
The ecological and biological<br />
aspects of life in the area?<br />
15682/ 70 Are there localities within the area<br />
of the Great Barrier Reef and, if so,<br />
what are their geographical limits,<br />
wherein the eff ects of an oil or gas<br />
leak would cause so little detriment<br />
that drilling there for petroleum<br />
might be permitted?<br />
If exploration or drilling for petroleum<br />
in any locality within the area<br />
of the Great Barrier Reef is permitted,<br />
are existing safety precautions<br />
already prescribed or otherwise<br />
laid down for that locality regarded<br />
as adequate and, if not, what<br />
conditions should be imposed before<br />
such exploration or drilling could<br />
take place?<br />
What are the probable benefits<br />
accruing to the State of Queensland<br />
and other parts of the Commonwealth<br />
from exploration or drilling<br />
for petroleum in the area of the<br />
Great Barrier Reef and the extent of<br />
those benefits?<br />
The area of the Great Barrier Reef referred<br />
to in the above terms of reference includes<br />
the entire area from low watermark on the<br />
mainland of Queensland to the outer line<br />
of the Reef and includes also the area outside<br />
and adjacent to the outer line of reefs.<br />
These agreed terms of reference incorporate<br />
some improvements and changes of<br />
a drafting nature from the agreed terms </p>
<p>announced on 29th January following the<br />
conference on that date between the Premier<br />
and myself.<br />
The Premier and I are pleased that 3<br />
persons of such eminence have agreed to be<br />
the Commissioners. Sir Gordon Wallacc<br />
recently retired as President of the Court of<br />
Appeal of New South Wales. He had<br />
previously been a judge of the Supreme<br />
Court of that State. While at the Bar he<br />
held office as President of the New South<br />
Wales Bar Association in 1957-58 and Vice-<br />
President of the Law Council of Australia<br />
in 1957. Dr Smith is a Doctor of Science,<br />
a Fellow of the Royal Society, Director of<br />
the Plymouth Laboratory of the Marine<br />
Biological Association of the United Kingdom,<br />
Chairman of Trustees of the British<br />
Museum of Natural History and Chairman<br />
of the Indian Ocean Biological Centre Consultative<br />
Committee. He has held teaching<br />
appointments at the Universities of Manchester,<br />
Sheffield and Cambridge and for<br />
some years was Professor of Zoology at the<br />
University of London. He has served on<br />
the Science Research Council of Great<br />
Britain and on the Council and Committees<br />
of the Royal Society of London. As Director<br />
of the Plymoruth Laboratory, he organised<br />
the research undertaken by the Plymouth<br />
staff on the effects of the ' Torrey Canyon' oil pollution on marine life. Mr Moroney<br />
is a consultant petroleum engineer with<br />
experience in problems of off-shore operations.<br />
He has had over 40 years experience<br />
with oil companies in engineering and<br />
managerial positions throughout North and<br />
South America. He graduated from the<br />
Georgetown University and is a member of<br />
the Canadian -Institute of Mining and<br />
Metallurgy and of the American Institute<br />
of Mining and Metallurgical Engineers.<br />
The inquiry would be an open one and<br />
the royal commissioners have sufficient<br />
authority to collect any evidence required.<br />
All interested parties could appear beforc.<br />
the commission and state their views and<br />
adduce evidence to support those views. The<br />
commissioners will make announcements<br />
on arrangements for the hearing of such<br />
evidence. Counsel assisting the royal commissions<br />
will -be Mr A. E. Woodward,<br />
of the Victorian Bar and Mr<br />
C. E. K. Hampson of the Queensland Bar.<br />
I present the following paper:<br />
