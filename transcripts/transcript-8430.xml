TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
DOORSTOP, MELBOURNE<br />
28 FEBRUARY 1992<br />
E OE PROOF COPY<br />
PM: and the States can't do it alone, and that's why<br />
we've had a co-operative discussion with the Premier of<br />
the State of Victoria and the other States to try and<br />
get Victoria going. And it won't happen by taxing your<br />
bread and milk and clothes and your dry-cleaning. That<br />
will only happen with money. That will only happen<br />
with government money brought to where it can be most<br />
effective, rationalisation of facilities like this, to<br />
make Australia a more efficient place. So, can I just<br />
say this, that what I put to our opponents is, do they<br />
oppose these sorts of changes? Do they want reform?<br />
Do they want change of this variety? Are they going to<br />
be in the partnership with Australians, with business<br />
to change? Are they going to be whole-hearted<br />
Australians or only half-hearted Australians? Are they<br />
going to be confident Australians? Are they going to<br />
make Australia different and better? Are we going to<br />
get on with making this an efficient country? Because<br />
if they are, they have got to pass our legislation.<br />
They have got to agree to it, and they have got to<br />
agree, that these are the basic first order issues for<br />
Australia to get a container through a port quickly,<br />
to trade of the world, and of course the world in which<br />
we live: the Asia-Pacific.<br />
So, this is a very graphic example of Governments<br />
working together. Joan ( Kirner) and I have been<br />
working{ on this for some time now, and she has with her<br />
Government for a quite a long time now, as we have with<br />
the Governments of the other States, and with business<br />
which can make these things work.<br />
J: Prime Minister, aren't you backing a loser the Kirner<br />
Government? </p>
<p>PM: I'm backing progress, change for Australians, a<br />
stimulus for the Victorian economy, and a lift in<br />
confidence in Victoria and in other states of<br />
Australia. And if I might say, the Premier has been<br />
able to get more done in a short period in these vacant<br />
areas and get an agenda running which can really make a<br />
great difference and provide to the city of Melbourne<br />
and the State of Victoria a new industry, a new service<br />
industry, a modern efficient freight industry for<br />
Victoria.<br />
J: Is this going to be enough to win the Wills by--<br />
election?<br />
PM: Well, leave' that to one side. The real question is,<br />
what have we got to do make Australia better? What<br />
have we got to do to make Australia more competitive?<br />
These are the things that have to be done. Equipment<br />
which is 20 years old, running at 40 per cent capacity,<br />
it's got to go. Roadways which take a circuitous route<br />
to try to load a container train, it's got to change.<br />
And it can only change with Government support. These<br />
are Government facilities basically. They are not<br />
going to be privately invested in, they will only be<br />
changed if Government spent money on these things.<br />
They will not be changed by taxing some low income<br />
earners' bread and milk.<br />
J: Mr Keating, what measure will you have what will<br />
you say to the ACTU about the real cut in wages? What<br />
can you say to them?<br />
PM: Well, the ACTU know about these things and they are<br />
part of the process of change. On the waterfront this<br />
year, by the end of this year, waterfront employment<br />
will have fallen by nearly 50 per cent in the last two<br />
years. Enormous rationalisation, but now we have got<br />
to rationalise the businesses that those people work<br />
in. So the ACTU is right up to speed on efficiency and<br />
it's up to speed on the other great objectives, the<br />
national inflation rate keeping it low, and keeping<br />
wage claims competitive, so we can run and keep that<br />
core issue in competitiveness, that is a low inflation<br />
rate.<br />
J: can you tell us exactly what is in regarding<br />
the wage claim this year then?<br />
PM: I think, this afternoon, they probably will.<br />
J: not just the tabloid press.., what you said about<br />
British Do you regret the intensity to which you<br />
made your point? </p>
<p>PM: No. The fact of the matter is, this country does over<br />
three quarters of its trade, both in imports and<br />
exports, with the Asia-Pacific area. We are no longer<br />
tied to Europe, and we're certainly not tied to<br />
Britain. Britain gave Australia up when it joined the<br />
European Community. And Ministers got a polite " I'm<br />
sorry" and " no thanks" in the 1960s and the 1970s. I'm<br />
just simply making that point. And I'm making the<br />
point to Australian politicians on the conservative<br />
side who I say are half-heartedly Australian, who want<br />
to keep doffing their lid to an old apparatus which we<br />
have shaken off. We signed the Australia Act in 1986<br />
which cut all of the links with Britain. And while<br />
they will always remain friends of ours, and I'm sure<br />
British people in the Government today don't share the<br />
views, and understand really the world as it is, don't<br />
share the views of Dr Hewson and Mr Howard and all<br />
these other people who want to trek back to the 1950s.<br />
The fact of the matter is, for us the way is clear. We<br />
have to be aggressively Australian, whole-heartedly<br />
Australian, proud of it, and go and trade with our part<br />
of the world and forget this stuff about tugging the<br />
forelock, and be more than about MBEs and Knighthoods.<br />
J: They say you' 1ve got history wrong.<br />
PM: Don't worry about I noticed some Englishman said<br />
oh, Australia wasn't attacked. I noticed that was an<br />
interesting bit of history.<br />
J: Bruce Ruxton calls himself Australian and he says<br />
you're a, in his words, a ' ratbag'.<br />
PM: Well maybe Bruce is still looking for an MBE or a<br />
Knighthood, ' I don't know.<br />
J: So no apologies, Mr Keating?<br />
PM: Just understand this simple point. This is about<br />
Australia calling its own shots in the Asia-Pacific<br />
running its race, living its life, and not having<br />
Australians proposing themselves as leaders of the<br />
Dr Hewson and Mr Howard looking back with<br />
melancholy to the 1950s and all of the imperial bits<br />
and pieces that came with it. It's all over.<br />
J: No apologies?<br />
PM: Absolutely not.<br />
J: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: I'm talking about the old links with Britain, the<br />
Britain of the ' 50s and ' 60s, the thing which Menzies<br />
and the other people tied them to in the past. I'm not<br />
criticising the British Government or modern Britain. </p>
<p>J: You said they sold Australia out during the War.<br />
PM: Well, I'm not going over the history. The fact of the<br />
matter is we were left to defend this place for<br />
ourselves.<br />
J: real issue?<br />
PM: Look, there's only one real issue in Australia to get<br />
a recovery going. To get a recovery going. To do the<br />
things which have to be done, Government and business<br />
together, to get a recovery going. And that's what<br />
this is about, it's about getting a recovery going,<br />
it's about changing the basic infrastructure of the<br />
place, and it's about Australians being whole-heartedly<br />
Australians and coming together one nation to make<br />
the place tick. It's not about regressive policies,<br />
taxing ] ow income people, the food they put in their<br />
mouth and the clothes they put on their backs, calling<br />
it refor3m. It's not reform, it's savage regressive<br />
taxation. The reform has to be in these places, in the<br />
cranes, in the wharves, in the facilities, in the<br />
airlines, the electricity grids, in the technical and<br />
further education, in the inflation rate. These are<br />
the first order issues, not a consumption tax.<br />
ends </p>
