I am delighted that the States have finally seen their<br />
way clear to accept this major initiative by the Australian Government.<br />
The Australian Government has already allocated almost<br />
$ 73 million for projects that were scheduled to commence during<br />
the current financial year. We had intended to spend $ 32 million<br />
during this year but because of delays caused not only in settling<br />
the agreement, but also because of the recent interruption to the<br />
Parliamentary machinery the expenditure will not be anything like that.<br />
This means that Urban travellers will be forced to wait longer before<br />
they start to enjoy the benefits flowing from our program.<br />
Projects already in the program include new rolling stock<br />
for rail, bus and tram services, the provision of additional rail<br />
trackage where necessary, the creation of exclusive bus rights of<br />
way in certain cities and a number of other projects which will<br />
improve the comfort and convenience of our public transport systems.<br />
The final step necessary to get this program under way is<br />
the ratification of the Agreement by the Australian Parliament. The<br />
bill to achieve this final step had been introduced in the previous<br />
Parliament but was not passed before Parliament was disolved. I am<br />
determined to reduce any further delays to the minimum and will ensure<br />
that the necessary legislation obtains priority in the early sitting<br />
of the current Parliament.<br />
We are closely watching our commitments in the immediate<br />
future to ensure that they can be met during the current economic<br />
climate. At the recent Premiers' Conference I stated that we proposed<br />
to press on with the Urban Public Transport Program we have initiated.<br />
As the Treasurer stated in his Budget speech last year, our outlays<br />
in this field will increase rapidly in 1974/ 75 and beyond.<br />
We are fulfilling our commitment to improve a neglected part<br />
of our cities, a part which must be improved if the cities are to<br />
be attractive places in which to live and work. I expect that the<br />
benefits will be flowing to the regular traveller in the near future<br />
as some of the less costly projects that are extremely attractive<br />
are introduced into the transport system. </p>
