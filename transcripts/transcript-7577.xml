PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF AN INTERVIEW/ TALKBACK WITH BOB MAUMILLf RADIO 2UE.<br />
APRIL 1989.<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY.<br />
MAUMILLt We'll get straight into this. Will I get a couple of<br />
the questions over that, sort of, they don't let you become a<br />
member of the AJA, unless you ask?<br />
PM: OK.<br />
MAUMILL: OK. Are you taller than John Howard, and is there<br />
going to be an early election?<br />
PM: Scintillating.<br />
MAUMILL: Everyone seems to ask that. I want my eight cents a<br />
day back because Andrew Olle's one of my idols and I saw you with<br />
him on the ABC the other night on Four Corners and you buried him<br />
in statistics, and the only time he looked comfortable was whon<br />
he said, ' Are you taller than John Howard?'.<br />
PM: Penetrating stuff, wasn't it?<br />
MAUMILLs Yes. Surely, the national debate on ABC TV should go<br />
beyond that. Anyway, let's go to the phones and see what the<br />
people of New South Wales have got to ask you, because I'm not<br />
going to try and be clever like my colleagues. I'll let the<br />
people do it for me. Good day, Roley. How are you this morning?<br />
How are you going, Roley?<br />
CALLERs Well thanks, Bob.<br />
MAUMILL: Where are you calling from, Role?<br />
CALLERs Newcastle.<br />
MAUMILL: Yes. We go loud and clear to Newcastle. What's up,<br />
mate? CALLER: I'd like to talk to the Prime Minister, if I may, over a<br />
few problems on the water<br />
MAUMILLs Hello.<br />
PM: He's got problems all right. </p>
<p>2..<br />
MAUMILLs Yes. Problems from Newcastle# Try and get him back if<br />
we kept his number. we'll go to the next call. Arthur's on<br />
line. Morning, Arthur. You there, Art?<br />
CALLER-. Mr Hawke, I've got a Congratulation and a question for<br />
you. PM: Thanks, Arthur.<br />
CALLER: Well, the congratulation is congratulations on Senator<br />
Richardson and your stand on the Greens and holding up the<br />
forests against predators. Is there anything in the way of<br />
enterprise and land that you wouldn't allow to be sold to<br />
predatory Japan, and will you list all the stuff that's already<br />
been sold?<br />
HAUMILL: Hang up, Arthur, and listen to the answer.<br />
PM: Well, down to what's sold. Basically, this comes into the<br />
area of State regulation and some States keep lists; others<br />
refuse to. So, it's not within our Jurisdiction to keep a list,<br />
Arthur, of acquisitions 4-~ ctV ore CvNc6e. in various States, but on<br />
this question of investment by other countries, not just Japan,<br />
and certainly won't discriminate against any particular country,<br />
we need investment here. We can't simply put a wall around<br />
Australia and say, ' We're not going to trade with or have mutual<br />
investments with other countries'. The distinction between my<br />
Party, my Government, and the other side is that we at least,<br />
keep some oversight on it. We have the Foreign Investment Review<br />
Board and we won't let investment take place in this country<br />
unless it's consistent with the national interest. The Libs have<br />
in their policy the decision to abolish the Foreign Investment<br />
Review Board and just have open slather. That's the difference.<br />
XAUMILLs Let's go back to the phones. Good day, Zara. How are<br />
you doing? Young caller, Prime Minister, to talk to you this<br />
morning. Morning, Zara.<br />
CALLER: Yes?<br />
MAUXILL: Go ahand.<br />
PM: Good day, Zara.<br />
CALLER: Hello. Good morning, mister.<br />
PM: How are you?<br />
CALLERs I'm good, thank you.<br />
PMs Good.<br />
CAILER: Just answer a question I want to ask you all the time. </p>
<p>CALLER ( cont): When you had in Australia, the amnesty for the<br />
overs visitors I call them, but some people call them illegal<br />
migrants, and the last one we had Mr Fraser, he gave the<br />
last one, and he say we didn't have another one, and just, you<br />
know, been wondering why, and if we'going to have another one<br />
soon? MAUMILL: Hang up, Zara. We'll give you the answer. Zara wants<br />
an amnesty for all her relations who are here illegally.<br />
PM: Well, we're not promising another one, Zara. For the very<br />
simple reason that we have about a million people each year<br />
around the world who go through the normal processes, seek and<br />
make application to become immigrants to Australia, and as you<br />
know, we can only have about a hundred and forty thousand a year.<br />
Now, it would be totally unfair to those who go through the<br />
proper legal processes of seeking to come here according to the<br />
laws of this country, to say, ' Well, bad luck you. We'll take<br />
away half the available spaces by allowing to stay here, people<br />
who haven't abided by the law'. That sort of thing is not on.<br />
MAUMILL: Nor it should be.<br />
PM: Thank you, Robert.<br />
MAUMILL: Let us talk to, Roley. Morning, Roley.<br />
CALLER. Hello, Bob.<br />
PMt Good day, Roley. How are you?<br />
MAUMILLs Roley, we lost you from Newcastle before. Say good<br />
morning to the Prime Minister again.<br />
CALLER: Prime Minister, how are youwell?<br />
PM: Good, mate.<br />
CALLER: I've got several queries. I'm an ordinary working chap.<br />
I work on the wharves.<br />
PM: Good on you.<br />
CALLER: And there's a few queries I'd like to get cleared up, if<br />
I may.<br />
PMs Sure.<br />
CALLER: On the thirty-first of January a ship arrived from<br />
Brazil and brought in three and a half thousand tons of<br />
concentrated orange juice. Now, that was consigned to Mildura.<br />
Is that necessary, do you think, Bob?<br />
PM: Well, let me put it to you this way, Roley. As you're a </p>
<p>4. PM ( cont): wharf je you live on the basis on trade, and if you<br />
didn't have trade both into and out of the country, you'd be out<br />
of a job. So, youwvgot a vested interest in trade both ways.<br />
Now, the second thing to say is this. I've been spending years<br />
since I've been Prime Minister personally, and having my Ministers<br />
going around the world, arguing the case for Australian farmers,<br />
producers; that they get a fair deal on world markets. They<br />
don't have barriers put up against them in the United States,<br />
Japan and Europe to stop our products getting in there, and<br />
gradually we're winning that and the more I win that argument on<br />
behalf of Australian producers, the better off we're going to be.<br />
Now, you can't have a double standard. You can't say, ' Well,<br />
we're going to go round and tell the rest of the world that they<br />
can't have barriers against our products', but say, ' Key, prestol<br />
We'll do the same thing ourselves'. We can't live by double<br />
standards, Roley.<br />
MAUMILLt No. With an agricultural hinterland like us, it just<br />
seems to me to be ludicrous that we import something as basic to<br />
the Australian average household, as orange juice.<br />
PM: That's a different point as to whether, in fact, our people<br />
here don't organise themselves better because they've got a<br />
natural advantage. Here they haven't got anyii CLRK-That's a<br />
different proposition, whether they can't organ so themselves<br />
better to make ours so much more financially attractive that<br />
there's no case for bringing in the other.<br />
MAUMILLt Yes, because I draw your attention to the fact that<br />
Roley didn't say, ' Don't bring it in', he just said, ' Why should<br />
we?'. PM: Yes. Well, that's right, but what I'm saying is there's two<br />
ways in which you can stop it. Either by artificial, you know,<br />
tariffs and so on; that's what I'm directing myself to. We're<br />
not going to be a party to that. We want to gradually reduce<br />
protection, but I take Roley's point that if he'. talking about<br />
the inadequacy of our own producers here in seeing that they<br />
market theirs at a competitive price, that's another proposition<br />
and there may be something wrong with the way they go about<br />
their business.<br />
M4AUMILL: Roley, I had a call on talkback radio yesterday from a<br />
couple of wharf iou at Newcastle. You seem to be organising<br />
yourself to talk to the media up there. It cropped up in<br />
conversation on my programme yesterday from one of your mates,<br />
about steel from Spain that was coming in too. You're unloading<br />
three and a half thousand tones of steel rods.. AreYou working on<br />
that boat?<br />
CALLER: We do, Bob.* There' s an article in the Telegraph of<br />
Tuesday April 18, and it cited BHP as a model to industry. Now,<br />
there' s a ship coming in the twenty-eighth with seven thousand<br />
ton of steel from Spain and over the last eighteen months that I </p>
<p>CALLER ( cont); can recall, I can recall six ships that come from<br />
Spain and Brazil. Now, there again, Bob, is that necessary?<br />
PM: well, again I go partly back to the answer I gave before,<br />
but there'sa more to it than that. Firstly, I repeat the point,<br />
we're not going to have a situation in this country where we're<br />
having double standards, : iae we're going around the world and<br />
arguing for free access for our products to the rest of the<br />
world, and putting up barriers against stuff coming into<br />
Australia. That's point one, but the second point is1 I'd just<br />
remind you, Roley, that you'd certainly remember because you<br />
follow these things obviously, that in 1983, when we came to<br />
office, the steel industry was on the verge of extinction. They<br />
were seriously thinki~ ng about closing down the steel industry and<br />
we said, ' Bull to that. That is not on'. We said, ' We're going<br />
to save the steel industry', and we did. We had a steel industry<br />
plan. Established a Steel industry Authority and we saved the<br />
steel industry. it's now very, very much more efficient. so,<br />
one other side of the coin in regard to what you see coming in<br />
here is also, that our steel industry in exporting. We've<br />
increased our exports because we've become more efficient. Now,<br />
under the Steel Industry Authority that we set up, Roley, we<br />
monitored the level of imports so that our industry was basically<br />
able to be operating in a way which had the great muajority of the<br />
Australian market, and I think, it would be the consensus view of<br />
the industry, that is both the unions working in the industry and<br />
BHP itself, that we've struck a pretty fair balance. In other<br />
words, we are providing the overwhelming proportion of Australian<br />
steel requirements out of our own industry. We're also exporting<br />
some of our product and we've got a relatively smal11 level of<br />
imports. It's not a bad mix and it's certainly infinitely better<br />
to the situation that I inherited in 1983 where the industry was<br />
on the way out.<br />
MAUXILLi Many of us applauded the move that John Button made in<br />
revitalising the steel industry, but surely here, when you look<br />
at it, it's difficult for a bloke like Roley, and certainly<br />
someone like myself, to accept that we need to employ steel-<br />
PM: Import. Import steel.<br />
MAUMILLs Import steel, when we've got the technological knowhow.<br />
We've got the raw materials, and there's no question that we've<br />
got the people and the facilities. Yet, the big Aus tralian's<br />
bringing steel in from Spain and Brazil; thousands of tonnes of<br />
it, processed. Now, I've heard you and Paul Keating both say<br />
that we've got to get involved in the manufacturing chain. it's<br />
just not good enough for us to supply the raw materials to the<br />
world. We should be processing the products as well. Well, here<br />
it is, we're importing it from Spain. What's going wrong?<br />
PH: No. No. Get both sides of the story. We are, in fact,<br />
exporting steel products as well, and I think It's arguable, I<br />
don't set myself it's arguable that BHP could have made some </p>
<p>PM ( cont) s its investment decisions earlier, QO* olu Oincrease<br />
its capacity, but they are doing that flow. I was up there the<br />
other day and was involved with commissioning of a new part of<br />
their plant. I think it's arguable that they could have moved<br />
earlier. If they had, then we would be supplying more of our<br />
own, and be able to export more, but I think, that you've got to<br />
take the view, looking at it overall, that we've improved our<br />
position enormously. I mean, they were seriously, in 1982-3,<br />
thinking of shutting down the Australian steel industry<br />
altogether. Now, we' ve converted that. We've now made the.<br />
industry much more competitive and as a result of the decisions<br />
they are making now to create more capacity, we'll be able to<br />
supply more of our~ jnroduct ourselves, and export more, but I<br />
concede that in the meantime, while there's some being imported<br />
that must be a bit frustrating.<br />
MAUMILLt Yesj because I mean, you are exhorting us to buy<br />
Australian products.<br />
PM Too right.<br />
MAUM ILL: And people should be.<br />
PHI Yes.<br />
MAUMILL: But orange juice comes f rom Brazil. I presue it gets<br />
packaged in Australia and then sold as Australian orange juice.<br />
Steel comes from Spain and Brazil. I would presume that it would<br />
be used in Australian manufacturing; probably Australian tins,<br />
too, and would be the most expensive part of an Australian<br />
product. Yet,, so we may buy it with an Australian label on it<br />
but the ingredients, and indeed much of the packaging in steel<br />
cans and things, could come from outside Australia?<br />
PM: No. The overwhelming proportion of the packaging for<br />
Australian products is made in Australia and in that area, I<br />
simply say in regard to orange juice, I think there is somethinguJri<br />
with the industry if they can't overcome the additional transport<br />
costs that there are, that they don't, But I do in the end, come<br />
9 back to the point which you have got to grasp, my dear friend, in<br />
this. We can't put a bloody great fence around Australia and<br />
any, ' We don't trade with the rest of the world'.<br />
MAUMILL: No. We don't.<br />
PM: No, but wait a minute, but you don't want us to import any<br />
orange juice. You don't want us to import any steel. What do<br />
you want us to import?<br />
MAUMILL: I didn't say, ' I don't want you to'. I'm saying, ' Why<br />
should we?'.<br />
PM: Well, I'm saying that as far as possible </p>
<p>MAUMILL: It's your job to fix it up.<br />
PM: Yes, and I've saved the steel industry. It was on the way<br />
out when I came in. That's what the Libs had done af ter seven<br />
years; destroyed the steel industry. We saved it. Now, I also<br />
amr wanting to make sure we get the best possible deals for our<br />
farmers who are getting a rough deal. They are the most<br />
efficient producers in the world and they've been shut put of<br />
Europe. They've been shut of Japan. They've been shut~' bf the<br />
united States. Now, I can'It have my blokes going around the*<br />
world and having myself going around the world arguing to all<br />
these countries saying, ' Cut down your tariff walls. Cut down<br />
your artificial barriers to entries to the products from my<br />
country', and ay, ' But we don't want any of yours'.<br />
MAUMILL: Yes. That's presuming that you're right.<br />
PM: Well, I am on this.<br />
MAUMILLs Are you?<br />
PHI Well, do want our farmers to have free access to these<br />
countries? MAUMILL: Yes.<br />
PM: Good. OK. Well, then I can't go and preach to them; no<br />
tariff barriers, no artificial barriers to the products from<br />
Australia, and at the same time say, ' But I'm sorry, boys. You<br />
shut your eyes while I put"? barrier to yours'<br />
MAUMILL: Yes.<br />
PM: You wouldn't conduct<br />
MAUMILL: No, but I would think there should be some horse<br />
trading. P14: Well, there is some horse trading. ( inaudible).<br />
MAUMILL: ( Inaudible) That's another question. Poverty stricken<br />
talkback radio commentator<br />
PM: ( Inaudible) You're in a good paddock.<br />
MAUMILLs You're good. You are. We'll take a couple of<br />
commercial breaks. I'll. read one. You sip your coffee. We'll<br />
come back in a minute. Have a look at them.<br />
PM; I could read it better than you.<br />
MAtUMIIL: Yes. Go. I mucked it up last time.<br />
PM: Yes. OK. Top class fashion from the top class shopping </p>
<p>Pm ( cont); centre. it's the Top Ryde Shopping Square fashion<br />
parade. Now, I better not read anymore. You take it over from<br />
there.<br />
MAuxiILLs why? Do you think you'll be asked to read all of them?<br />
PM4: Well, I might be asked to read all of them then.<br />
MAUMILL: But as my girlfriend says, you still talk through your<br />
nose. Listen from this, from down in here. I've been to the<br />
John Laws school of elocution.<br />
PM: Yes. You've got plenty to come from there. Plenty to come<br />
from down there, mate. Very resonant.<br />
Commercial break.<br />
MAUMILL: Back to the phones we go. Bill's on line four. That's<br />
it. Good day, Bill.<br />
CALLER: Good morning, Mr Prime Minister.<br />
PM: Good day, Bill.<br />
CALLER: Bob's putting you in a bad mood?<br />
PMi No. Having a great time.<br />
MAUXILL: Nio. I didn't. I can handle him. I always look at<br />
this way, Bill. If I say, ' That's enough Prime Minister. Got<br />
out of my studio'. I make the front pages tomorrow and I stay<br />
there for a week. So, he needs me, and blokes like me.<br />
P14: Bill, I'm in a great mood. He's a great mate of mine.<br />
CALLER: Prime Minister, I'm a supporter of the Labor Party.<br />
Nevertheless, I take issue with the Federal Government's decision<br />
to construct a third runway into Botany Bay.<br />
PM: Where do you live, Bill.<br />
CALLERs I live at Kurnell, on the peninsula.<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
CALLER: You know, for years the Labor Party, both Federal and<br />
State, were opposed to that third runway and that decision's been<br />
changed-now. I certainly hope that the decision will be reversed<br />
when the EIS is put forward.<br />
PM: Well, the Environmental Impact Study will be undertaken and<br />
it'll be a serious one, but Bill, let me say this. When I<br />
started to look at this closely when one had to come up bef ore<br />
Cabinet, I and those around me actually, advising me, we all </p>
<p>PH ( cont) 3 thought that on economic grounds, it was going to be<br />
the sensible decision to go straight out to the Badgery Creek<br />
site but the more I looked at it the more questions I asked.<br />
The more I had the statistics and all the assumptions put up to<br />
me, it was quite clear that the sensible economic decision was to<br />
build the third runway and go out to Badgery's Creek at a slower<br />
rate. Now, it would have been against the economic interest. of<br />
the country as a whole if we hadn't made that decision. So, I<br />
was persuaded on the economics of it. I know that on the<br />
politics of it I take a risk, but some of the people like<br />
yourself, Bill, are going to say, ' Well, the Labor Party had a<br />
different position on this and we in the area think we're going<br />
to be worse off', and that you won't like it. Now, I understand<br />
that there was a political risk in taking that decision, but the<br />
fact is, Bill, that it was the right economic decision, and I'm<br />
not going to make decisions against the economic interests of<br />
this country. if I get the ? acts and the statistics before me<br />
that show that I need to change a position that I've had before,<br />
then I'll change it, because I'm not going to court, you know,<br />
political applause in some areas on the basis of going against<br />
the economic interests of the country as a whole. I'm sorry.<br />
You know, I'd like to be able to give you another answer. I<br />
won' t.<br />
MAUMILL: Is Gary Punch finished politically for bluing with you<br />
over this?<br />
PHt No. I wouldn't think so, and in fact, he's got a great<br />
story to tell to his electorate. The statistics are very simple;<br />
that when the third runway comes In the number of annual<br />
movements over his electorate will decline from seventy-two<br />
thousand to two thousand. Not a bad story.<br />
MATJMILLs Yes. A cynic could say, of course, that Gary resigned<br />
to get an election over with and then you'll reinstate him once<br />
he wins, but he's got to be seen to be opposing you on it. Any<br />
deal been done?<br />
PM No deal.<br />
MAUl4ILLs No deal. Righto. Just thought I'd ask. Good day,<br />
Peter. CALLERt Hello.<br />
MAUMILL: How you doing, Pete?<br />
CALLER; How are you? Bob, please.<br />
PM4 Yes, Peter.<br />
CALLER: Good day. How are you, mate?<br />
PM: Good, mate. </p>
<p>CALLER: I'm a Labor man. I've voted all my life, mate.<br />
PM: Good on you.<br />
CALLER: I think you're doing a great job.<br />
PM: Thanks.<br />
MAUMILL: Well, we don't need to talk to you anymore. Go away.<br />
We want to get someone who will put him on the spot. Go away,<br />
Peter. Call in again later. Let's try Pat. Hello, Pat, how are<br />
you doing?<br />
CALLER: Good thanks.<br />
MAU! 4ILL: None of this backslapping stuff. Let's got heavy.<br />
Will someone ring and get stuck into him? You know, the charisma<br />
can't work on radio as well, surely. Yes. You there, Pat?<br />
CALLER: Yes.<br />
P14: Good day, Pat.<br />
CALLER: Bob Hawke?<br />
PM: Yes, mate.<br />
CALLER: Now, I'm a member of the Five Dock Labor Party and we<br />
passed a resolution at our last meeting asking you to refuse to<br />
sign the Antarctic Agreement. It's got to be signed in the next<br />
couple of months. Now, I heard Senator Richardson on one of the<br />
TV shows one Sunday morning saying that we should sign. it's the<br />
best thing we could do.<br />
P14; Yes.<br />
CALLERs Totally disagree with him, and I hope that the<br />
Government will have the sense and the intelligence not to sign<br />
it because we don't another King William Sound business where the<br />
oil spillage up there....<br />
PM: Sure.<br />
CALLER: What that's done, we don't want that in the Antarctic.<br />
PM: Yes. Pat, this issue's got to come up before the Cabinet.<br />
The argument that<br />
CALLER: Give it serious consideration that it will not be<br />
signed. I think it's better if we don't.<br />
PM: Well, Pat, we'll certainly be giving serious consideration<br />
to the issue, but let me make this point in defence of </p>
<p>11<br />
PM ( cant) t Richardson. I don't think there's anyone in<br />
Australia really, who's more committed to environmental issues in<br />
a constructive way than Graham Richardson. His argument is, and<br />
we've got to, you know, consider this in Cabinet, but I<br />
understand his argument to be that unless there is an actual<br />
regime signed, then the capacity to have any control at all over<br />
activity of this type is nonexistent. in other words, without<br />
some sort of regime, which the various nations of the world have<br />
signed, it's open slather, and anyone can go in and do what they<br />
will. So, his argument is, it's best to have a regime and try<br />
and get as tight and most effective regime as possible under an<br />
agreement, because if you don't do that, then it is open slather.<br />
Now, that's the essence of his argument, but these things will be<br />
considered by Cabinet and the sort of considerations you have in<br />
mind will be very much before us.<br />
MAUMILLs Let's go to the top of the board. Morning, Margaret.<br />
CALLERs Good morning, Bob.<br />
PMs Good day, Margaret.<br />
CALLER: The Prime Minister?<br />
PM: Good day.<br />
CALLER: Good morning, Prime Minister.<br />
PM Good morning.<br />
CALLER: Prime Minister, I've got a problem that I think many<br />
listeners will be very interested in and that is if you could<br />
explain to me in layman's language why it is possible for big<br />
business to borrow money, millions overseas, at a very low rate,<br />
and then claim tax deductions in Australia, at Australia's rate,<br />
when young couples who have to borrow money to buy a home at high<br />
Australian rates, they're not getting any tax deductions? X know<br />
that you're going to say to me, inflation and all this.<br />
PM: No. I ' m not going to say that. I'm going to give you the<br />
answer which is this, Margaret, and that answer is that you see<br />
these stories that are written about. You see a company, one of<br />
the companies in a group that's paid little or no taxation; they<br />
say, ' Isn't that terrible? They've paid no tax'.* What is not<br />
understood and its been put out time after time after time, and<br />
people either don't want to see it or don't want to understand<br />
it. Companies can be in a situation where It's a member of a<br />
group and they will have paid tax in another company and what<br />
happens in the company that you're looking at, has paid no tax,<br />
it is not the operating company. Tax'has already been paid on<br />
what's passed into it but the other companies in the group have<br />
paid the tax. Now, if you look at Just the one company and say,<br />
' That one's paid no tax', you ignore the fact that where the </p>
<p>12. PM ( cont) 4 other company that the come f rom into that<br />
company has paid it. You can't pay it twice, and if you look at<br />
the group as a whole, they are paying a tax. For a simple fact,<br />
Margaret, is that it's under this Government that f or the first<br />
time, all the tax evasions and rorts that were characterised<br />
under the previous regime have been stopped. I mean, let me put<br />
it to you this way. The previous Government set up a Royal<br />
Commuission; it was a Costigan Royal Comm ission, and our own Royal<br />
Commission said in 1983. that the fastest growing industry in this<br />
country was the tax avoidance industry. That was the outcome of<br />
the previous mob who simply wouldn't make people and companies<br />
pay who should pay. Now we've, by broadening a tax base,<br />
tightening up laws, giving the Tax Commissioner, Mr Boucher, more<br />
and more resources, actually putting auditors in the companies.<br />
They go and sit in the major companies now and so from the inside<br />
they see what's happening and they're getting hundreds of<br />
millions of dollars out of companies in tax which was never<br />
obtained before. You ask the business community of this country<br />
which is the Government which has made them pay tax and they'll<br />
tell you, it5the Hawke Government.<br />
MAUMILL: You're making us pay tax. He's heavy as lead that<br />
Boucher. He's got his team going through all the radio stations<br />
at the moment.<br />
PM: But you don't mind that, do you?<br />
MAUMILL: No. I don't mind. No. I don't mind.<br />
PMs Good on you.<br />
MAUMILL: But he's very heavy. Do you think he's too high<br />
profile? Boucher? Do you think he's sort of playing the role<br />
PM: Not on your life.<br />
MAUMILL: Paul Keating's storm troopers?<br />
PM: No. Every Australian taxpayer, every one of your listeners<br />
should have a picture up of him and praise him because it's<br />
because<br />
MAUMILLs ( Inaudible).<br />
PM: Well, but you're a decent bloke. You'll do it. It's<br />
because Boucher's going in and making those who've got the<br />
capacity and the obligation to pay, because they are paying now.<br />
That's enabled us to bring the rates down. When we came to<br />
office, what was the top rate? It was sixty cents.<br />
MAUMILL: Sixty. Yen.<br />
PM: Sixty cents. It's now down to forty-nine and forty-seven in<br />
January and the lowest rate was thirty and that's come down now. </p>
<p>13.<br />
PM ( cont): we've reduced that by a third. Nowt the only way<br />
we've been able to bring tax rates down is because we're making<br />
those blightere pay who didn't pay before.<br />
MAUMILL: The Secretary of the Federal Treasury, Bernie Fraser,<br />
has admitted that Mr Keating's inflation forecast is off beam,<br />
and he predicts 7.3% which is well above Mr Keating's inflation<br />
figure of<br />
PM: Look, there's one problem in what you're saying there. It's<br />
not Mr Fraser saying<br />
MAUXILLs Does this mean you got it wrong?<br />
PM: it's not Mr Fraser saying that Mr Keating's figure is wrong.<br />
It's the Treasury, headed by Mr Fraser, who provide the basic<br />
information upon which the Budget's drawn up and Mr Fraser is<br />
saying of himself. I meanI I'm not having a shot at Bernie.<br />
Bernie's saying, ' We got it wrong'. Most economists had a belief<br />
that you were going to have lover levels of activity af ter the<br />
October ' 87 crash; the level was going to fall down. In fact,<br />
here and around the rest of the world activity boomed, and so it<br />
is right, the estimates that we made then were out. Now we've<br />
got to make the decisions, Bob, to deal with that, and we have.<br />
MAUMILL: Yes, but fifteen billion trade deficit he's talking<br />
about. PM: Yes, and that's right.<br />
MAUMILL: Can we afford that?<br />
PM: Can't go on affording it, that's why we've got high interest<br />
rates. That's why we're bringing down the level of activity.<br />
You can't have it both ways. You can't complain about the high<br />
level of interest rates and the high level of imports and the<br />
current account deficit. The reason why we've got high interest<br />
rates is to bring the level of activity down so as there won't be<br />
so many imports sucked in.<br />
MAUMILLt Yes, but Paul Keating's saying steady as she goes.<br />
We've got to keep the hand on the tiller and remain resolute, but<br />
it hasn't worked so far, has it?_<br />
PM: On the contrary. It has worked.<br />
MAUMILL: But he's got it wrong. He's got the figures wrong.<br />
That's all we can use to go on, Prime Minister.<br />
PM: But Treasury and the Government acting on those advice, like<br />
Treasuries all around the world, got it wrong because every<br />
economist around the world, every Treasury, every Government,<br />
assumed after the October ' 87 crash that the, you know, the </p>
<p>14. PM ( cont) l economy was going to fall flat right around the<br />
world. Now in fact, the level of activity stayed up very much<br />
higher. We've got boom conditions around the world. so, we all<br />
got it wrong in that sense. Now the -thing Is p the secret of<br />
economic management has been to adjust to those changed<br />
circumstances. That's what we're doing. Now, traditionally what<br />
would have happened in Australia in those circumstances, that the<br />
screws would have been turned on that tight that you would have<br />
sent the economy into recession. That was a traditional<br />
conservative way. We haven't done that. We've still got high<br />
employment growth and what we're going to do it bring the level<br />
of activity back, Bob, but not that far that we put it into<br />
recession. MAtUMILLa You told my Mum during the West Australian election<br />
when you were over there,-that interest rates would be down by<br />
Christmas. Is that still going to happen?<br />
PHI Yes. I was asked in January, Bob, did I think that<br />
HAUMILLt It was Mum that yelled the question.<br />
PM: Thanks, Mum. Thanks Mrs Maumill. You've got a lot to<br />
answer for; the son and the question.<br />
MAUMILL: Will they come down?<br />
PM: I've got no reason to change the answer I gave. I1 didn't<br />
raise it myself. Your mother, I didn't know, raised it. She<br />
said, ' Will they be down before the end of the year?' The answer<br />
is ' Yes'# and it's still yes.<br />
MAUMILL: Yes? They'll cone down?<br />
PM&amp; They'll be down before the end of the year.<br />
MAUMILLs All right. OK. Well, there you go. There's the<br />
headline, boys. make sure it's well reported. Let's go back to<br />
the phones. Let's get some sensible questions from our<br />
listeners. why don't we go to line five, Paul; single Mum? Good<br />
day, Robyn. How are you doing?<br />
CALLER: Hi. I've got two questions actually. The first is, how<br />
a single Mum can go on a pension, live in de f acto relationship<br />
and have one, two, even three-children after she's been on the<br />
pension from the beginning?<br />
PM: Well, when you say, ' They're living in a do facto<br />
relationship', we further tightened up the rules in this last<br />
Statement we brought down to avoid a situation where people who<br />
are supposed to be getting the benefit from an actual single<br />
parent relationship are not, in fact, living in that situation.<br />
So, my intention on the part of the Goverznent to allow that sort </p>
<p>PM ( cant): of scene. A single parent's benefit is for a single<br />
parent not living in a de facto relationship and the practice of<br />
the procedures in the Department will be tightened up even<br />
further to ensure that that doesn't happen.<br />
MAUMILLz Let's go to the top of the board. Good day* Bob. How<br />
are you doing?<br />
CALLERs Not too bad at all. Thanks, Bob.<br />
MAUMILLs Go ahead. Ask you( question. Let's get on with it.<br />
CALLER: OK. We've got Bob, Bob and Bob.<br />
PM: Three Bobs.<br />
MAUMILL: Yes. Three Bobs.<br />
CALLER: Look, Bob, I'm an ex-RAN Vietnam veteran and for some<br />
time we weren't recognised for our logistical Support of the<br />
Vietnam War. Now you Government recognised four of the claims<br />
which was basically that it was Now, I thank Senator<br />
Arthur Geitzel and Kim Beazley for that, and yourself, of course.<br />
Now, on the Welcome Home March you may not have noticed when you<br />
were standing on the Sydney Town Hall steps, but we led the navy<br />
contingent of the Welcome Home March and we had a really great<br />
day, but none of us wore any recognition from Australia; that's<br />
in the form of the Australian Vietnam Medal. Now<br />
unfortunately, it would seem that Mr Beazley, and I'm only<br />
reading between the lines here, seems to have come to a blank<br />
wall with the Defence Service Chiefs, and on that basis, I've<br />
tried very hard to talk to the Defence Service Chief involved but<br />
they seem to turn a blind eye to me. I don't exist. Now, what<br />
I'd like to ask you is could you grant this last request,<br />
particularly with ANZAC Day coming up. It means a hell of a lot<br />
to f our thousand servicemen. It's an Australian recognition.<br />
We've got a Return From Active Service Badge, but where did we<br />
return from?<br />
PM: Yes. You're referring to the service, like the<br />
merchant marine, and so on?<br />
CALLER: No. This was the HMAS Sydney.<br />
PM: It was the actual naval-<br />
CALLER: Yes.<br />
PM: The naval people who provided the services going up there<br />
but who weren't in action there?<br />
CALLER: That's right. </p>
<p>16. pm: Yes. Yes. I understand what you're talking about. Well<br />
look, Bob, i would want to talk to Kim Beazley about the details<br />
of this and I give you an undertaking that when I next see him I<br />
will. I mean, I can't say that you'll get the answer you want<br />
but the undertaking I do give you is that I'll talk to Beazley<br />
about it.<br />
MAUMIILt You'll raise the matter?<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
MAUMILL: Let's go down the board. Talk to Ann. Line fourteen.<br />
Morning, Ann.<br />
CALLER: Good morning.<br />
PM: Good morning, Ann.<br />
CALLER: Look, what I want to mostly bring up is that my husband<br />
does wages. Like, he does it each week for employees and a<br />
couple of weeks ago we were out shopping and I was a bit amazed,<br />
as I get all the time, how the cost of living keeps going up and<br />
I was wondering that perhaps when he told me what the actual<br />
basic wage was, he said, ' About three fifteen', and I said,<br />
' Goodness me. How do people live on that?', and he didn't<br />
answer. He said, ' I don't know', but what I was wondering, do<br />
you think it's possible for you to put the wage rise up before<br />
July because I feel that people really, in some casesnot myself,<br />
I'm not ringing for, and what about freezing prices because it<br />
doesn't matter. Can that ever be done again? I know it was<br />
tried to be brought in once becausej Mr Hawke the prices go up<br />
whether the wages go up or not and they keep going up.<br />
PM: well, let me go to the two parts of your question, Ann. In<br />
regard to the people on the lowest level of wages, part of the<br />
arrangement that we've made in the negotiations with the ACTU;<br />
those people at the lowest level are going to benefit in these<br />
ways. Firstly, they are going to get an increase in what's<br />
called their supplementary payments and that will give a<br />
substantial increase at the wages level. The second way in which<br />
they'll be assisted is that where they have kids there are going<br />
to be substantial increases in the Family Allowances and the<br />
Family Allowance Supplement which, if you take the case of a<br />
bloke with a wife and three kids at that low level of income, it<br />
will be equivalent to a wage in crease of over a hundred dollars a<br />
week; what we've done in terms of poingthem with Family<br />
Allowance Supplements for their children, and thirdly, of course,<br />
at the low level of income they pay no tax A bloke on twenty<br />
thousand dollars a year with wife and three kids will in effect<br />
pay no net tax because what he paid in tax is more than offset by<br />
the allowances they get that I've mentioned. So, in these ways<br />
we're conscience, and so is the trade union movement, of the need<br />
of those lower income people and they'll be helped in those<br />
particular ways. Now, to the other part of your question, Anne, </p>
<p>17. PM ( cont): about price control. You can't have price control in<br />
peace time. We haven't got the constitutional power under the<br />
Commonwealth to do it. None of the States want to exercise it.<br />
What we've really got is the next best thing with the Prices<br />
Surveillance Authority which watches particular areas where there<br />
is an opportunity for business to take advantage of semimonopolistic<br />
positions. We watch that and report on it and try<br />
by the pressure of public opinion in that way to stop unnecessary<br />
increases, but we haven't got under the Constitution, Ann, the<br />
power to impose price control.<br />
MAUMILL: i ig story in New South Wales this morning is three<br />
cents a litre on petrol. You take about $ 1.5b in petrol taxes<br />
out . of New South Wales and give about three hundred and fiftyfoiR~<br />
ack a year. There seems to be a disproportionate amount of<br />
money channelled by Treasury into other areas, and roads in New<br />
South Wales, as everyone knows, are really crook and neglected.<br />
The State Government blames you and says you don't give us enough<br />
money back. They've now bunged on the three cent impost. Who'sa<br />
fault is it and will you give them a belt around the ears at the<br />
Premier' s Conference?<br />
PM: There'll be a few words about this at the Premier's<br />
Conference, I can assure youi. Now, on the question of roads,<br />
there has been a significant real increase in expenditure on<br />
roads under this Government. We've completed the Around<br />
Australia National Highway and there's been a very, very<br />
significant Increase in expenditure in real terms and under the<br />
arrangements we've got you'll see that there'll be a further real<br />
increase in funding for roads in the next financial year. So,<br />
that's, you know, the reality. Now, as far as Mr Greiner' s<br />
concerned, he refuses to accept the need for a level of restraint<br />
in activity. The whole point of the exercise that we're about,<br />
Bob, in running the economy is that we've got to bring the level<br />
of activity back somewhat. We were talking about it before.<br />
otherwise, you're just going to have, as I say, a significant<br />
increase in imports, but Mr Greiner seems intent on not<br />
exercising the sort of discipline here that we in the<br />
Commonwealth and other States are going to do, and this slug on<br />
motorists here.... three cent slug on motorists isn't justified,<br />
and it is a matter that will be taken into account in our<br />
discussions at the Premier's Conference.<br />
MAUMILL: But he's saying its the only way we'll get better<br />
roads. You won't give us enough money.<br />
PM: But we have given a significant real increase in funding.<br />
There'll be a further real increase in funding in the year ahead.<br />
So, it's not as though we're not increasing the outlay on roads.<br />
If you want to, you could go on building more and more and more<br />
and more roads; more and more bridges. You could build more and<br />
more schools. You could do more of everything, but in the<br />
process, of course, you'd ruin the country. You just can't keep </p>
<p>18. Pm ( cont): ion spending. If you do keep on spending that way,<br />
you're talking about the current accounts, imports will just go<br />
through the roof the economy comes to a , and I think you're<br />
sensible enough to know you just can't keep on spending on<br />
everything you went to.<br />
MAUXILL; Yes, but try telling that to people who are jammed in<br />
pot holes on Windsor Road trying to get work and they know that<br />
they are getting back only a very, very small proportion of what<br />
they're handing over to the Commonwealth.<br />
PM It's not handing over to the Commonwealth. It's not going<br />
into my pocket, or Keating's pocket. It's being used to do a<br />
whole range of things. They want schools as well. They want<br />
soci al welfare. They want pensions. Historically, motor fuel<br />
has been one of the areas which has provided income to successive<br />
governments, not just for roads. it's not just with what you<br />
raise by way of coming off fuel is just going to roads. it's one<br />
of the sources of revenue which governments use to build schools,<br />
bridges, roads.<br />
MAUMILL: Yes. It seems to me though, like an extra taxation.<br />
PM: Mr Greiner's?<br />
MAUMILL: No, because you're a motorist, we get into your pay<br />
packet and we'll get you through the petrol bowser a. well.<br />
You're saying that consolidated -revenue gains from the petrol<br />
pump and doesn't necessarily give all of that, doesn't give all<br />
of that money<br />
PM I'm saying the motorist is not just a motorist. You don't<br />
live your life sitting in your motor car. You get out of your<br />
motor car. You have kids. You send them to school. You want<br />
defence. You want pensions for your mothers and fathers who are<br />
out of the work force.<br />
MAUMILL: Yes, but non-motoristo don't pay it.<br />
PM: OK. Well, then to the extent that non-motorists don't pay<br />
it, so what? I mean, non-motorists are taxed as well, but<br />
traditionally excise on motor fuel is a source of revenue for<br />
governments for matters not only to do with roads. I mean, does<br />
it follow from that, that when-you go and have a drink and you<br />
pay your tax on it, I mean, you still do have the occasional one,<br />
do you?<br />
MAUMILL: A sip of very good red West Australian wine.<br />
PM Good on you.<br />
MAUMILL: Keep away from the other stuff. </p>
<p>19.<br />
PKI Yes. I see. well, doe. it follow that we governments get<br />
revenue from you as a drinker that we should only spend the<br />
revenue we get from that, what on the hospitals where we're<br />
treating cirrhosis of the liver? You say that that's true?<br />
MAUMILL: No.<br />
P14* Well then, what's the argument that says that in respect<br />
. what you pay as a motorist should only go on roads?<br />
MAUMILL: Yes, but I can make a decision about whether or not I<br />
drink or not, but I can't make a decision whether or not I should<br />
come to work. I've got to get in my car to come to work.<br />
There's no public transport. I've got to get in the car to drive<br />
to work.<br />
PM:. That's right.-<br />
MAUMILL: If I don't want to have drink, I don't have a drink, I<br />
don't pay the tax if I don't like it. But I have got no option<br />
but to travel to get to work to make a living. Now, what you're<br />
really saying is that you get me out of my PAYE pay packet, I pay<br />
as I earn, and because I'm a motorist, to get more money for<br />
consolidated revenue, you get me at the petrol pump as well.<br />
PHI it's not a question of getting you. It's a question of<br />
saying that Bob Maumill, you are as well as being a motorist you<br />
are many other things. You've got kids, you've got parents, you<br />
want us to provide pensions, you want us to provide schools for<br />
your kids. Now, how do we get the money in terms of all these<br />
things other than by a collection of revenue? The important<br />
thing to note that as far as this Government is concerned, what<br />
we have been doing is to keep the revenue that we get as a<br />
constant portion. It hasn't gone up. with all these increased<br />
demands, including increased expenditure on roads which we have<br />
undertaken, infinitely more money on education, infinitely more<br />
money on pensions and so on, we still, our tax take, the<br />
Commonwealth tax take has remained a constant in all the period<br />
we have been in Government.<br />
0MAUMILL: Robyn's on line six. She wants to talk to you and I<br />
promised that she'd get on.<br />
PM: Good on you.<br />
MAUMILLt Let's go down the board. Where is she? Is she still<br />
there? No. She has gone, but Margo is there. Morning, Margo.<br />
CALLER: Hello.<br />
MAUMILL:. How are you Margo?<br />
CALLER: Good morning, Prime Minister </p>
<p>PM: Good day, Margo. How are you?<br />
CALLERs Good, thank you. I believe that everything in Japan<br />
costs much more than here. I'm was told that, for instance, it<br />
costs one thousand, five hundred for three people to have dinner<br />
in a restaurant. Well, that's a thousand per cent more than<br />
here. How high are our interest rates going to go with this<br />
highly inflated money coming into the country and if they keep<br />
buying up Australian businesses and land and everything, we won't<br />
have to worry about trade. They'll own it all. We won't have<br />
anything left to trade.<br />
MAUMILLs Well, that's a statement; not a question. Good on you,<br />
Margo. PMs Margo, I'm not quite -sure I see the connection between how<br />
high costs of living are in Japan and the rest of your question,<br />
but I Just go back to this point. If you want a Government and a<br />
PM that's going to be anti-Japanese, you've got the wrong bloke.<br />
I'm not going to be anti-Japanese, and I'll tell you why I'm<br />
not, because the future velfare of your kids and their kids<br />
depends upon this country having sensible, constructive<br />
relationships with this region. The Asian-Pacific rim of<br />
which we are part, is the fastest growing part of the world's<br />
economy. By well before the end of this century they'll be<br />
producing more than half of everything that is produced in the<br />
world. They will be the biggest entity in world trading and if<br />
Australia adopts this, and I'll be quite direct with you, this<br />
quite stupid and self-defeating attitude of being anti-Japanese,<br />
anti-Asian, then what you are doing as sure as I'm sitting here<br />
next to this slim fellow Maumill, is that you'll be condemning<br />
your kids and their kids to a worse future. The very worst thing<br />
that can be done to Australia's future is to have this anti-<br />
Japanese, anti-Asian attitude because they are growing at an<br />
enormous rate; all this region, the Japanese and the other<br />
countries of this region, they are growing faster than anyone<br />
else in the world, and the future of this country depends upon<br />
having a sensible, constructive trading relationship with them.<br />
If we say to them, ' We don't like you. we don't like the look of<br />
you. we don't like your money. We don't want your investment.'<br />
Then very simply and properly the Japanese and these other<br />
countries will say to us, ' All right, get nicked, Australia', and<br />
they will nick us, and you'll sit back with your children and<br />
you'll say, ' Marvellous. We've been tough and Rambo. we've told<br />
the Japanese we don't like them'-, but what the Japanese and the<br />
rest of these countries will do is say, ' Bye bye, Australia'.<br />
Now, you might want to do that Margo, but I'm telling you, I'm<br />
not going to do it, because I want a country where my kids and my<br />
grandchildren and yours and their grandchildren are going to have<br />
the opportunity of getting all the economic benefits of trading<br />
with the fastest growing part of the world.<br />
MAUMILL: Prime Minister. I'm a Barry Jones fan. I like the way<br />
he conducts himself publicly. Whenever I talk to him on air he's </p>
<p>21.<br />
a verys very easy, f orthcoming bloke. Goes on a bit. You know<br />
what Barry is like; a bit wordy,, but I was<br />
PM: Like a radio bloke.<br />
MAUMILL: Yes. I was a bit distressed to 586 that there was some<br />
friction in Cabinet and that Barry was going to pull the pin. You<br />
had to prevail upon him to stay. what's the basis of it? What<br />
was the blue about?<br />
PM: There's no problem. Barry is very, very intent on ensuring<br />
that there is a f air go f or science in this country. That they<br />
get a good amount of funding and new f unding. He was a bit<br />
worried that they weren't going to get as much as they needed to<br />
help develop science in this country but I had a talk to him, a<br />
very friendly one and there was no suggestion that he was pulling<br />
the plug. He's, still there and will be.<br />
MAUMILL: ( Inaudible). Was there some blue between him and John<br />
Button? PM No. No. No. There's different emphasis between them and<br />
couple of others as to whether this amount of money should go<br />
there and that amount of money should go there but it's good<br />
healthy discussion. He's still there and will be.<br />
MAUMILL: Final call. It's on dual nationalities. It's one that<br />
comes up on this talkback programme all the time. Kevin's down<br />
there on line seventeen. Morning, Kev.<br />
CALLER: -Hello, Bob.<br />
PM How are you, mate?<br />
MAUMILL: How are you down, Key? Make it quick, Kevin, will you?<br />
CALLER: Yes. Listen, I'd like to know is there anyway that<br />
through Parliament that any dual nationalities are not allowed<br />
to hold power such as.... or anything else in Parliament?<br />
PM: Such as what?<br />
CALLER: Such an in Parliament. Like, in here in New South Wales<br />
we've got a Greiner who's Just raping -New South Wales something<br />
terrible and he wasn't even born here and with it he's selling<br />
off all of our heritage.<br />
PM: Well, Kevin, as for as I know, Mr Greiner only has his<br />
Australian nationality. It's not dual nationality and I just<br />
want to simply say to you and be as tough as I was in the answer<br />
to the previous questioner. If you've got a view that you're<br />
against anyone that was born in this country, you're talking to<br />
the wrong bloke, mate. You want to talk to someone else, because<br />
as far as I'm concerned immigration has been the thing which has </p>
<p>22. PM ( cont): enriched this country. At the end of the last War we<br />
were seven million people. Now we're sixteen and half Million<br />
people. We've got people in this country that have come from one<br />
hundred and thirty odd different homelands. As of this very day<br />
that I'm talking to you, Kevin, almost forty percent, about<br />
thirty-nine percent of every person in this country today warn<br />
either born in another country or 18 the child of a parent born<br />
in another country. If you think you can turn the clock back to<br />
have an Australia that consists only of people born in Australia<br />
then you want to do the worst possible thing to this country.<br />
You're talking to the wrong blokes mate. If you want that sort<br />
of thing, go and talk to some Conservatives.<br />
MAUXILL: Prime Minister, you look healthy, you look fit, you<br />
look active. I've never seen you work better. Does that mean<br />
you're going to go on indefinitely?<br />
PM: Well, I'm putting myself up next time for another term and I<br />
feel right. You're absolutely right. Never felt better.<br />
MAUMILL: Have you given Hazel a committment that you'll retire<br />
by a certain time?<br />
PM: No.<br />
MAUMILL: Has it ever been discussed between the two of you?<br />
PM: No. We just want to feel sure that we're both fit and well<br />
and able to keep going. I'll keep going while I feel that I'm at<br />
my peak and that's where I feel at the moment.<br />
MAUMILLs But are there any other horizons that you'd like to<br />
conquer? I mean, everything you've set out to do? I spoke to<br />
you on a plane one time. I interviewed you when you were Chief<br />
of the ACTU. We talked at some length. You said, ' One day I<br />
want to be Prime Minister of Australia. I want to go into<br />
Federal Parliament and one day I hope to be Prime Minister'.<br />
You've done that. You went into Federal Parliament. You became<br />
Prime Minister. Is that the end of the Hawke agenda?<br />
PMt No. No. There's a life after politics, mate. Life after<br />
politics. MAUMILL: Well, after politics, what role do you see yourself in?<br />
What do you do with a Prime Minister? Look at Malcolm, he's<br />
walking around looking for a job-.<br />
PM: Yes, and I'm trying to help him get one.<br />
MAUMILL: You're trying to help him get one. I know you are.<br />
PM: How's that? That's not bad, is it? </p>
<p>23.<br />
MAUMILL: Can't be fairer than that.<br />
PMe Can't be fairer than that.<br />
)( AUMILL# You've always been for full employmento even for ex-<br />
Prime Ministers. What would you do? what would Bob Hawke, ex-<br />
Prime Minister of Australia do?<br />
PM: Well, I've said one of the things I want to do is I'd<br />
love to do a television series which would involve a lot of work<br />
interviewing people who I've had the great privilege of meeting<br />
who I think have made an impact upon the world and have changed<br />
events in a very significant way. I've learnt a lot from meeting<br />
these people. I mean, I've had my imagination and horizons<br />
widened by getting to know them and I would like to share with<br />
millions of other people in this country and around the world, my<br />
knowledge of these people through really reasonably lengthy<br />
interviews with them. So, that's something I'd very much like to<br />
do, and then well, I'd also like to spend a lot of time with my<br />
six grandchildren. Just got the sixth the other day, and I'Id<br />
like to see more of my country and I'd like to see of the world.<br />
KAUMILL: Has your vision for Australia been distorted at all by<br />
the behaviour of Australians during the immigration debate? Are<br />
they the good people, the good blokes, if you like, and this goes<br />
for men and women, using your own words, are they the good blokes<br />
you always thought they were, or do you scratch an Australian and<br />
you find a racist?<br />
PM: No. It's not fair to say, ' Scratch an Australian and you<br />
find a racist'I. There's no doubt there is racism in this<br />
country, and that hurts and disturbs me. The thing that hurts me<br />
is that people are so unintelligent that they can be racist. I<br />
mean, you can't determine, I can't determine, what I was born. I<br />
could have been born black. I could have been born Jewish. I<br />
could have', Iorn anything. I happen to be born a white<br />
Australian. OK. That's what I'm born. It is an obscenity to<br />
have a prejudice against a person because they were born<br />
different to you. That person who is black or Jewish or<br />
Japanese; that's what they were born and they've got the same<br />
mixture of emotions, aspirations, hopes, fears, strengths,<br />
weaknesses, as you and I have. I mean, where I particularly find<br />
it galling as I've said is where so-called Christians, you knov,<br />
they call themselves Christians, have this prejudice, because I<br />
go back to what my father said to me. He said, ' If you believe<br />
in the Fatherhood of God', he-said, ' there's a corollary.....<br />
The Fatherhood of God means the brotherhood of man'. You've got<br />
the same Father, you're brothers, and that's right. I mean, I<br />
don't practice that.... now but that's a truth, I think, which<br />
just seems to me to be overwhelming and I just find it so<br />
repulsive and unintelligent that you have a prejudice against a<br />
person. You could have born an Aborigine. You could have been<br />
born anything. You happen to be born what you are. Now, you<br />
should regard every human being, in my judgment, as a fellow </p>
<p>24.<br />
PM ( cont) h uman being. Not lesser, not greater.<br />
MAUbiILLs What sort of a job's Bill Hayden doing as Governor<br />
General? Are you happy with it?<br />
PKI Yes. I thought he'd be a good Governor-General, and he's<br />
doing it well. I get good reports. I expected him to do well.<br />
MAUMILL: Got any advice for the Libs who are self -destructing in<br />
Victoria, apart from keep on doing it?<br />
Pm: I No. No. I just go on with my colleagues governing the<br />
country and we'll leave them to themselves apart. There's a<br />
truth in politics which we learnt in the Labor Party, and that<br />
is, if you can't govern yourself, the people won't call on you to<br />
govern them.<br />
MAUMILL: Thanks for joining us today, Prime Minister. You do<br />
have other appointmuents now to attend. I appreciate the fact<br />
that you've joined us today anid we look forward to talking to you<br />
again in a talkback context very soon here on 2KY. Thanks for<br />
being PM: It's been great being with you again, mate.<br />
KAUMILL: Good on you, mate. Good to see you again.<br />
end. </p>
