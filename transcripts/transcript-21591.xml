    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to announce that Their Royal Highnesses, Crown Prince Frederik and Crown Princess Mary of Denmark will be visiting Australia next month.</p>
<p> Their official programme will begin in Sydney on 27 February and finish in Hobart on 11 March.</p>
<p>This will be their first official visit to Australia and they are expected to visit Sydney (27 February-8 March), Canberra (8-10 March), Melbourne (10 March) and Hobart (10-11 March).</p>
<p>Their Excellencies the Governor-General and Mrs Jeffery look forward to greeting the Danish Royal couple in Canberra after officially representing Australia at the Royal Wedding in Copenhagen last year.</p>
<p>Whilst details are yet to be finalised, the official programme has been organised so that Their Royal Highnesses can meet as many Australians in both formal and informal settings as possible.</p>
<p> The programme includes a variety of events including celebrations to mark the bicentenary of the birth of Hans Christian Andersen; a number of charity fundraisers for the Australian Red Cross; Mental Health Foundation of Australia; Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute; Australian Cancer Research Foundation; and Save the Children Fund; Danish community events; a hospital visit; and state dinners and formal receptions.</p>
<p>I know that Crown Prince Frederik and Crown Princess Mary will be welcomed on this visit with the warmth for which Australians are renowned.</p>
<p>Further details of the programme will be released once finalised.</p>
