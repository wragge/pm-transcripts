PRIME MINISTER<br />
EMBARGOED UNTIL 8.00 P. M. CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
HEAVY ENGINEERING MANUFACTURER'S ASSOCIATION<br />
CANBERRA 17 SEPTEMBER 1984<br />
I would l ike to thank you, Mr Chairman, arid your<br />
Association, for your kind invitation to me to be quest of<br />
honour at this, your 16th Annual Dinner.<br />
I particularly appreciate this opportunity to renew my<br />
acquaintance with the top management of an industry which<br />
for so long has played such a vital and dynamic role in the<br />
development of Australia's resources and economy.<br />
Your role has notably expanded and diversified with the<br />
great demands associated with the development and<br />
exploitation of the resources discovered particularly in the<br />
last twenty years.<br />
Your industry has also been instrumental in the creation of<br />
the industrial, transport and energy infrastructure which<br />
forms an integral part of Australia's contemporary economic<br />
strength. Through your efforts Australia has been the beneficiary of<br />
some truly great projects. The Snowy Mountains Scheme, the<br />
first phase of the North West Shelf project, and several of<br />
the mining and processing facilities established over the<br />
past two decades rank with any internationally.<br />
They are clear proof of the sophistication of Australian<br />
engineering skills and of the success with which you have<br />
developed techniques and skills appropriate to a harsh and<br />
often unyielding environment.<br />
The entrepreneurial and innovative flair demonstrated by<br />
your industry has been an important part of making Australia<br />
the great nation it is today.<br />
The current difficulties being experienced by the industry<br />
should not obscure its proud record.<br />
fl * tl I </p>
<p>Indeed the present circumstances of the heavy engineering<br />
sector are rather unique. Unlike other parts of the<br />
economy, your sector has yet to reap the benefits of the<br />
domestic and international economic recovery.<br />
This reflects in part the end of the resources development<br />
boom. It also reflects the expansion of capacity the<br />
industry undertook to meet the demands of that boom. As<br />
well, your industry was badly hurt by the major increases in<br />
labour costs associated with the wages explosion of 1981/ 82.<br />
The coincidence of the end of the resource boom construction<br />
phase with the downturn in the international economy was<br />
especially unfortunate. The increases in Australia's<br />
capacity to produce and export our mineral resources came<br />
precisely at the time when demand for thos6e resources fell<br />
away. It also came at a time of increased capacity among<br />
other international producers.<br />
In 1981 the volume of iron ore exports fell over ten per<br />
cent. In 1982 the volume of coal exports fell two per cent.<br />
That decline in international demand and resultant<br />
over-capacity in the international mineral industry quite<br />
radically changed the outlook for new resource developments.<br />
At the same time, new investment in domestically oriented<br />
industries was also declining. In 1982/ 83 non dwelling<br />
private business investment fell 13.8 per cent.<br />
Most recently, however, there have been firm signs that<br />
demand is picking up.<br />
Resource exports have lately performed very strongly. In<br />
the six months to June 1984 the volume of iron ore exports<br />
were 28.9 per cent higher than in the same period in 1983.<br />
Exports of coal have also shown accelerated growth, with the<br />
1983/ 84 volume being almost a third higher than in 1981/ 82.<br />
While this turnaround was in part a reflection of increased<br />
demand associated with the international recovery, it was<br />
also very much a response to international appreciation of<br />
the marked improvement in Australia's reliability and<br />
competitiveness as a supplier.<br />
Australia in the past year has experienced a remarkable<br />
movement towards industrial harmony the last twelve months<br />
saw the lowest number of industrial disputes in sixteen<br />
years. This is now being translated into a willingness on<br />
the part of international buyers to place orders with<br />
Australia. This very satifactory situation is a direct<br />
result of the Government's highly successful. Prices and<br />
Incomes Accord, as well as of the special consultative<br />
arrangements that we have been developing in key resource<br />
industries. </p>
<p>The rapidly increasing utilisation of capacity in some<br />
resource industries ( although not in the foreseeable future<br />
leading to full capacity utilization for the coal industry),<br />
together with the moderation of inflation and interest rates<br />
and the generally more favourable economic outlook, mean<br />
that soon some new resource projects will be joining the<br />
general pick-up in investment activity.<br />
While it does not constitute another resources boom, the<br />
level of activity now ready to commence is high by<br />
historical standards. This obviously presents real<br />
opportunities for the industry.<br />
The industry's own efforts, at both management and union<br />
level, to deal with its problems have been impressive. The<br />
Government, through its trade policies, its macro policies<br />
stimulating growth and stability, and through budgetary<br />
measures, has also contributed significantly to the type of<br />
environment needed by the heavy engineering industry.<br />
There are, nonetheless, currently strong calls for some<br />
measure of more direct Government involvement with the<br />
problems of the industry.<br />
But we should ensure that only well-considered solutions<br />
appropriate to the requirements of the industry and<br />
consistent with wider community interests are adopted.<br />
It is in this spirit that the Government has asked the IAC<br />
to report within three months on measures needed by the<br />
industry in the short term. We shall also be getting later<br />
from the IAC a report on the long-term assistance needs of<br />
the industry.<br />
These reports, together with proposals put by the industry<br />
itself, should provide a basis for any necessary short-term<br />
and long-term action by the Government.<br />
Any such action should be considered within the wider<br />
context of the Government's general approach to industry<br />
policy. We have already demonstrated through the motor<br />
vehicle and steel industry plans how, on the basis of<br />
extensive consultation with all interested parties, policies<br />
can be devised that will make long-term employment secure,<br />
restore profitability and safeguard the contribution of such<br />
crucial sectors for the economy more generally.<br />
At one level EPAC has played a crucial role in this<br />
consultative process. Its consideration of medium and<br />
long-term economic trends represents a critical step in<br />
establishing the framework for necessary sectoral decisions. </p>
<p>EPAC's success in exercising this role is now widely<br />
recognised. This is reflected in the high level of public<br />
interest in its work and in the representations to the<br />
Government regarding the membership of EPAC. Most recently,<br />
when I met representatives of the Australian Chamber of<br />
Commerce in Canberra last week, they reiterated their<br />
request for participation in this consultative body, which<br />
they saw as having a valuable role to play.<br />
At another level the Australian Manufacturing Council is now<br />
making good progress on developing advice on a broad<br />
framework for Australian manufacturing development. I was<br />
particularly pleased that the statement on manufacturing<br />
industry policy that was issued by the Council last Friday,<br />
reflected consensus on an approach which left behind the<br />
sterile old arguments, within which free t'tade and<br />
protection were seen narrowly as the only issues in industry<br />
policy. Consistently with views that John Button and I have<br />
put forward over the past year or so, the Council declared<br />
that Australian manufacturing industry must expand sales<br />
both in international and domestic markets, and that the key<br />
to success in both areas was enhanced competitiveness. The<br />
challenge now for all of us is to identify and nurture the<br />
processes through which we achieve enhanced international<br />
competitiveness. The emergence of this broad consensus on industry policy,<br />
admittedly at a high level of generality at this early<br />
stage, is of great importance. It sets the context within<br />
which we might now, with far greater confidence, address<br />
otherwise seemingly intractable industry development<br />
problems. Perhaps most importantly, it has served to<br />
highlight the futility of narrowly-based, and often<br />
ill-conceived, solutions to the problems of Australian<br />
industry. The sharpened focus on competitiveness raises doubts about<br />
some suggestions that the problems of your industry can be<br />
addressed effectively by increased protection from imports<br />
and higher public sector expenditure on the output of your<br />
industry. Such palliatives could have quite the Opposite impact to<br />
what is intended. They would raise costs faced by other<br />
industries and the community at large. In this way the<br />
national strategy for general economic recovery would be put<br />
at risk.<br />
None of us can afford to ignore the broader inflationary<br />
impact of higher costs at the very start of the production<br />
process. With firms throughout the economy striving to<br />
restrain costs and remain competitive, cost pressures<br />
arising from increased protection for an industry basic to<br />
the economy would be a serious blow to Australian business<br />
confidence. They would also kill off the very resource<br />
projects the industry itself needs for its own growth and<br />
development. 7 </p>
<p>We should also consider the increased costs to exporters of<br />
increased tariff or non-tariff protection from imports.<br />
There is also the possibility of adverse reaction to such<br />
measures from our trading partners.<br />
Indeed any increased imposts on exporters, direct or<br />
indirect, could only impact negatively on an industry such<br />
as yours, being as heavily oriented as it is to resource<br />
development. Obviously import replacement and export expansion are<br />
thoroughly good things if secured through improved<br />
competitiveness. The real task confronting us as a nation,<br />
and industries such as your own in particular, is to remove<br />
impediments to such competitiveness.<br />
The focus for all concerned should be on securing the<br />
conditions of improved competitiv~ ness, and on establishing<br />
fair access to international markets for all Australian<br />
suppliers. It is to these points that the Government, I<br />
believe very successfully, has been directing all its<br />
efforts. Some have suggested that major increases in public spending<br />
are needed if ' the heavy engineering sector is to be<br />
revitalised. There is, however, already a very high level of capital<br />
expenditure in the Government's budget. You would all<br />
appreciate how the positive impact on demand of the high<br />
level of public sector spending on non-dwelling construction<br />
will be of real benefit to the industry.<br />
But I am sure you would all also agree there is no point in<br />
building new capacity for example in electricity<br />
generation in advance of demand for output. More<br />
generally, you would also appreciate that the Government's<br />
economic strategy has required the utmost restraint on<br />
public spending consistent with the Government's social<br />
responsibilities. Increased expenditure could only be financed by some<br />
combination of increased taxes and higher Government<br />
borrowing. Either course would adversely affect private<br />
sector expectations and expenditure and would jeopardise the<br />
economic recovery.<br />
Greater spending would also represent a reversal of the<br />
Government's commitment to ongoing budgetary restraint.<br />
Such restraint is required to lower the public sector's call<br />
on the domestic capital markets to ensure room is made for<br />
private sector investment. Otherwise, there would be the<br />
prospect of a sharp clash between public and private sector<br />
borrowing requirements, which would put upward pressure on<br />
interest rates and the exchange rate. </p>
<p>Either consequence would be disastrous for the investment<br />
and market development interests of the heavy engineering<br />
sector. Indeed the lower levels of the exchange rate in<br />
recent months, which may not have emerged without the<br />
Government's deregulation of financial markets, should be a<br />
major factor in restoring confidence to the sector.<br />
The obvious success of the Government's economic policies in<br />
achieving non-inflationary, sustainable growth in an<br />
atmosphere of declining interest rates is readily apparent.<br />
We are not about to reverse those policies.<br />
Nor, as I have suggested would it be in the best interests<br />
of the Heavy Engineering industry for us to do so.<br />
Neither can the Government hope artificialfly to recreate the<br />
investment conditions of the resources boom.<br />
Nor would we want to.<br />
What we can do, and are doing, is to create the framework in<br />
which a sustained period of investment might be undertaken.<br />
The improved business and consumer sentiment apparent in<br />
recent surveys, and the reduced inflation and interest rates<br />
now achieved, will provide the atmosphere most conducive for<br />
the long-term investment expenditure which your industry<br />
needs. The success of the Accord in reducing the growth of prices<br />
and labour costs has been important in creating these<br />
conditions. We have also provided explicit support to<br />
business investment in the Budget through significant<br />
changes to taxation arrangements. These measures will have<br />
beneficial effects both in 19B4/ 85 and in the years ahead.<br />
In particular, I would point to the increased rate of<br />
depreciation for non-dwelling construction and the<br />
deductibility against income from any source of money spent<br />
on general mining exploration. The extension of eligibility<br />
for the investment allowance to plant and equipment in place<br />
by 30 June 1987, also carries real benefits for the large,<br />
long-term project developments of particular importance to<br />
your industry.<br />
More generally, it is clear that all levels of Government<br />
both Commonwealth and State and the heavy engineering<br />
industry itself need to identify projects in which the<br />
skills and resources of the industry can be used.<br />
In this regard, a special meeting was called on 30 August of<br />
the Australian Industry and Technology Council to discuss<br />
the difficulties facing Australian industry and, in<br />
particular, the heavy engineering sector. I am told that at<br />
that meeting it was agreed that a final appraisal would be<br />
made of the short and medium term outlook for ongoing or<br />
Committed public and private projects, immediately following<br />
presentation of current State Government budgets. </p>
<p>The Machinery and Metal Engineering Council has also<br />
recommended that the Commonwealth establish an industrial<br />
supplies office for the Australian machinery and metal<br />
engineering industry. Innovative approaches of this kind<br />
will be given the closest consideration.<br />
I see much merit in the concept. In co-operation with<br />
industry and the States, such an industrial supplies office<br />
could play an important role in increasing the awareness of<br />
Australian firms of construction opportunities.<br />
I should expect more such opportunities to present<br />
themselves in the months ahead. The fact that the<br />
international economic outlook is now the brightest it has<br />
been for some years, must give grounds for confidence for<br />
the future.<br />
The recovery underway since mid 1983 is broadening and<br />
consolidating. Most relevantly, world steel production has<br />
risen sharply in recent months. OECD steel output in the<br />
five months to May 1984 was up almost 13 per cent on the<br />
comparable period in 1983 and the highest since 1981.<br />
Recent monthly annualised steel production rates in Japan<br />
are the highest for four years.<br />
The improvement in the international economy, and of the<br />
domestic economy under the Labor Government's policies,<br />
bodes well for business confidence and investment in<br />
Australia. The greater predictability and certainty of conditions<br />
associated with the Labor Government's economic policies<br />
present unprecedented opportunities for investment interest<br />
in Australia. Obviously, these opportunities are now being<br />
seized to the great advantage of all Australians.<br />
Amongst very recent developments we can point to the<br />
agreement on the Portland aluminium smelter, the Bunbury<br />
aluminium smelter and power station project, the Channar<br />
iron ore mine in the Pilbara to supply the Chinese market,<br />
the progress on the North West Shelf export phase, and the<br />
range of major investment decisions announced over the last<br />
month or so in both the motor vehicle and steel industries.<br />
The industry itself needs to recognise, however, that in the<br />
near term there is unlikely to be the level of investment<br />
expenditure domestically that will fully employ its<br />
resources. The industry must look overseaS.<br />
The inward looking economic policies of earlier Governments<br />
have tended to shield our industry from the opportunities<br />
as well as the challenges of the international market<br />
place. That has been to our cost and to the detriment of<br />
the industry. </p>
<p>I believe it is now widely understood in the community that<br />
it is to our benefit at the level of the firm and the<br />
nation as a whole to expand our horizons to take advantage<br />
of the rapid changes occurring in the world and our region.<br />
Dynamic growth in the economies to our immediate north and<br />
technological advances in communications have created<br />
opportunities which we can and must exploit.<br />
In this way, the obvious limitations of a relatively small<br />
domestic market can be overcome.<br />
We are well equipped to pursue such a course. The capacity<br />
of Australians and Australian firms to compete successfully<br />
internationally using the lessons and skills learnt at home<br />
is undoubted. There are a multitude of in-stances in fields<br />
as diverse as sport through music to business that show<br />
Australians can excel against the ' toughest opposition.<br />
An industry which has a record of achievement as impressive<br />
as yours should not be backward in pressing its claims<br />
overseas. The recent success of BHP Engineering and Export Development<br />
Australia in getting the contract for the construction of<br />
the Shun Chang cement plant in Fujian Province in China is a<br />
clear demonstration of what is possible. It is also an<br />
obvious example of what is being achieved through the<br />
Government's considerable efforts to build a substantial<br />
trade relationship with China, including in this case direct<br />
representations by Lionel Bowen and myself on our respective<br />
Visits to China this year. I am pleased that many parts of<br />
Australian engineering industry are now recognising and<br />
pursuing the enormous market possibilities now opening up in<br />
China. There is also great opportunity for Australia in the<br />
dynamism and opportunity of the neighbouring Southeast Asian<br />
economies. The recent acceptance by the Malaysian<br />
Government of Leighton's bid for the Telok Intan Hospital<br />
project was a major breakthrough for the Australian<br />
construction industry. Direct Government representations in<br />
support of this bid played an important part in our securing<br />
it as also did the restoration, through my own and Dr<br />
Mahathir's visits to each other's countries, of close,<br />
businesslike relations between Australia and Malaysia.<br />
Another closely related development was the successful<br />
negotiation, also by Leighton's, of a joint venture<br />
arrangement with the Promet Corporation of Malaysia. This<br />
offers yet another instance of the type of initiative that<br />
can only increase the chances of successful off-shore work<br />
for Australian industry and is a pointer to the continuing<br />
validity of the priority attached by the Government to the<br />
development of soundly based trade relationships with the<br />
countries of the region. </p>
<p>Certainly, if Australia's heavy engineering industry can<br />
secure consistently contracts such as these, its future is<br />
assured.<br />
For this, among other reasons, the Government will continue<br />
working hard, both bilaterally and through exercises such as<br />
my regional trade initiative, to consolidate and develop<br />
further Australia's place in the markets of the region.<br />
Credit lines provided by the Export Finance and Insurance<br />
Corporation and the support available through the<br />
Development Import Finance Facility will continue to be<br />
extended to well considered Australian project proposals, as<br />
they were in BHP's bid for Shun Chang and in Leighton's<br />
success with the Telok Intan Hospital project.<br />
The Government intends doing everything il: can to see<br />
Australian enterprise securing its rightful share of the<br />
burgeoning opportunities of our re-gion.<br />
The benefits to be derived from outward looking industries<br />
and trade and economic policies can no longer be ignored.<br />
In an economy like Australia's, such approaches are<br />
absolutely essential if we are to make the most of our<br />
opportunities to provide all Australians productive<br />
employment at high living standards.<br />
To become a richer nation we need a more resilient,<br />
responsive, diversified and competitive, outward-looking<br />
economy. In this regard, production for domestic and foreign markets<br />
should not be seen as competing claims. They are mutually<br />
supportive. It is important that our resources human,<br />
intellectual and physical be directed to where they can be<br />
most usefully employed.<br />
What is required are national policies to promote sustained<br />
economic growth and a flexibility within the industry to<br />
respond to the opportunities both domestic and<br />
international such policies will provide.<br />
There is no answer to the industry's problems either in<br />
trying to close out the rest of the world or in ignoring the<br />
opportunities that our own region is now presenting.<br />
Rather what the industry needs is growth and the reality<br />
is that this is only possible if the industry ( and indeed<br />
all sectors of the Australian economy) adopt an<br />
international orientation.<br />
_ Wow-" mi~.~ </p>
<p>In short, the industry must now seek off-shore opportunities<br />
aggressively. This, together with the enhanced<br />
opportunities that the reversal of fortunes of the domestic<br />
economy will have, even for heavy engineering, as investment<br />
picks up in the year and years ahead, and successful pursuit<br />
of enhanced competitiveness, will bring your industry to a<br />
new stage of achievement and service to Australia.<br />
