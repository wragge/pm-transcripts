FOR MEDIA 5 October 1984<br />
JOINT STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER AND THE PREMIER OF<br />
WESTERN AUSTRALIA, BRIAN BURKE<br />
The Prime Minister, the Federal Minister for Aboriginal Affairs,<br />
Mr Holding, and the Western Australian Premier, Mr Burke, met<br />
this morning to discuss land rights and Aboriginal Affairs issues.<br />
The discussions were extremely productive.<br />
Mr Burke has invited the Federal Government to nominate an officer<br />
of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs to participate in the<br />
drafting of Western Australian land rights legislation.<br />
The Federal Government has accepted this offer and an official<br />
will work with the Western Australian Government on a full-time basis.<br />
Other related issues, including Aboriginal health, welfare and<br />
education were discussed and there will be continuing consultation<br />
and communication between the Prime Minister, Mr Holding and<br />
Mr Burke on all these matters.<br />
The Federal Government in accepting its obligations at a national<br />
level for Aboriginal land rights recognises the interests of Western<br />
Australia in addressing its problems.<br />
The Seaman Commission's report and recommendations, together with<br />
the Western Australian Government's statement of principles, provide<br />
a valuable basis on which to address these issues in that State.<br />
The Federal and State Governments will work together to ensure<br />
that common principles are adopted in the formulation of land<br />
rights legislation.<br />
The Commonwealth remains committed to its constitutional<br />
responsibilities in this area, but in fulfilling these<br />
responsibilities the Federal Government will acknowledge the<br />
particular needs of Western Australia.<br />
The decision to accept the Premier's offer to become involved in<br />
the drafting process acknowledged the particular Western Austral: i -an<br />
situation and the benefit to be obtained by close Commonwealth-<br />
State co-operation in the formulation of these policies.<br />
The Federal Government in developing its leqrislation is concerned<br />
to establish common principles which can also accommodate the<br />
different needs and aspirations of the State! s. </p>
