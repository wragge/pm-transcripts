-FOR PEDIA WEDNESDAY, 10 MARCH 1982<br />
SPEECH AT OPENING OF VICTORIAN ELECTION CA. PAIGN<br />
This is a great night. We all like to be associated with<br />
success, and I can feel success around me tonight. This is<br />
going to be a great Liberal election campaign. A campaign<br />
which will bring victory to the Liberal Party and continued<br />
good government to this great State.<br />
We all know that campaigns can be a mask for the reality which<br />
lies behLind. They can conceal the real political intent<br />
with screen that is all gloss, all facade. How many<br />
campaizns like that have we seen from Labor throughout this<br />
nation and on the occasions when Labor has had the opportunity<br />
to show; its real measure. How the facade has crumbled.<br />
AustraLians have been the losers and we would be far worse losers<br />
under Labor in the world of today. The Liberal campaign which<br />
Lindsay Thompson will launch tonight will be a great one. It<br />
will be built on strong foundations, by good builders, who have<br />
a record of achievement.<br />
It is a campaign built on the foundations of Liberal philosophy.<br />
Victoria is the heartland of Liberalism. And it is the Liberal<br />
Party which allows the initiative of individual men and women<br />
to be the driving force of our society. Liberal Governments<br />
seek to allow full expression of that indi. vidual. initiative.<br />
It is Liberal governments which promote the economic circumstance. z<br />
in which private enterprise can flourish, opportunities can be<br />
taken, and people's standards of living can rise.<br />
Over the last three decades, living standards have virtually doubled<br />
in this country and this State. And it has all been Liberal<br />
achievement. </p>
<p>2.<br />
We believe in freedom, opportunity, and security.. We want a<br />
strong, secure society, firmly based upon the family;<br />
a society in which the family is supported and the needy and<br />
disadvantaged are cared for, according to their needs and<br />
circumstances. These are our values and they are the values<br />
of the vast -majority of Australians. The vast majority of<br />
Victorians. How different are the socialist left values that Labor would<br />
impose on this state. Labor in Victoria today is further away<br />
from the needs and aspirations of the people of this State thain<br />
it has ever been. Liberal governments have built Victoria up.<br />
-Victorians have long been able to take for granted the kind of:<br />
development that is now happening in other States. Arid we must<br />
not let those achievements be thrown away.<br />
For de cades, Victoria has been a great productive centre for the<br />
whole of Australia as a result of the free-enterprise policies<br />
of liberaliSm.<br />
Victorians Enjoy the highest average household income of any<br />
State, and the highest rate of home ownership. This is the rEal<br />
test. How absurd to say Victoria is behind. Where Liberal<br />
governments take Australia ahead we all know the chaos<br />
of Labor in office. In Canberra they failed. In Tasmania the1y have<br />
failed. In S. A. they failed. In N. S. W. they have not met the!<br />
problems of the day.<br />
They cannot manage an economy and they cannot cope with unions; or<br />
strikes. WE! know Mr Wran has been good at public relations but<br />
now t: he tinsel is coming off. And if it wasn't for power coming<br />
out Victoria NSW industry, and homes would already be on short<br />
terms. This; is a vital election for Victoria. The Governent<br />
which holds power in this State has an enormous impact on people's<br />
lives. As Sir Henry Bolte used to say, " You get up in the morning, turn on<br />
switch on the light, send the kids to school, go along the<br />
roads to work... the States are responsible for all this and more".<br />
He was right%.. The powers of the Government in this State are<br />
vastly important for the well-being of Victoria's families.<br />
Wle want Lindsay Thompson to be premier in this-State standing free,<br />
proud and independent. We don't want Cain dominated by the socialist<br />
left as membiaers of his own party have said. We want a man who<br />
can govern in the interests of all Victorians. We want Lindsay<br />
Thompson. Vie want a Liberal government.<br />
