PRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT 4 DECEMBER, 1978<br />
Prime Minister Interviewed on ABC'S<br />
by Paul Davey<br />
Report: Last week we reported on the new Department of<br />
Employment and Youth Affairs, set up after<br />
Mr. Fraser's Cabinet re-shuffle and the comments<br />
by Sir William McMahon that the-Liberal backbench<br />
was looking to the new Ministry for results.<br />
Paul Davey asked the Prime Minister if the Government<br />
would be placing more emphasis on the problem of<br />
youth unemployment in 1979.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Clearly there will be a greater concentration in that particular<br />
issue because a Minister and a Department and a Permanent Head<br />
would have very specific responsibilities in these areas.<br />
I wouldn't want it to be thought that a great deal hasn't<br />
been done in this area because probably not too many people<br />
understand that 300,000 people have already been assisted,<br />
are being assisted, under the various training programmes and<br />
that's a very large number.<br />
Question Does the Government have any new schemes in mind, though,<br />
for the New Year?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
A number of initiatives have been suggested to us. Now what<br />
comes out of this will depend upon the examination, which<br />
the Government will be looking at in a few days time. There<br />
will be no change in economic policy because we believe our<br />
policy, as such, to be right. What we do want to do is to<br />
make quite sure that people, young people particularly, aren't<br />
missing out on opportunities because of some inadequacy<br />
in the various training programmes.<br />
Question Does your creation of this new portfolio in any way reflect<br />
the fact that the Government is now admitting that moves in<br />
this direction should have been undertaken earlier? / 2 </p>
<p>itPM" 1 -2-<br />
Prime Minister<br />
No, I don't think I would put it quite that way because<br />
the work of the Department of Employment and Industrial<br />
Relations had grown enormously. Going back before the<br />
Labor years created unemployment, it was then really an<br />
Industrial Relations Department that had employment<br />
responsibilities. Employment then wasn't a problem.<br />
Industrial relations was a very significant part of the<br />
total workload then. Over recent years the need to<br />
tackle the employment issue in a constructive and productive<br />
way has altered the balance and I believe it had got to<br />
the stage where the division, the split, had become necessary.<br />
You can always argue about whether that should have happened<br />
three months ago or six months ago or two or three months later.<br />
Question So, just briefly, can you explain how the difference is<br />
now going to effect itself. How is youth, for arguments sake,<br />
going to benefit from the split into these two portfolios?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
There will be concentration because you will have one Minister<br />
specifically involved with the general employment issues and<br />
that Minister will be able, by devoting his total time in<br />
that area, keep a closer eye on the various training programmes,<br />
make sure that industry registers the jobs that are available<br />
with the employment service. That by no means happens in<br />
all cases at the moment. Maybe the employment service doesn't get<br />
more than about 50 percent of jobs that are registered,<br />
before it. The Office of Youth Affairs is going to be expanded<br />
very significantly. So it is not only an employment department,<br />
it will be seeking to respond to the needs, the circumstances<br />
and the concerns of young people in Australia. I think Ian Viner<br />
is going to be very busy over the next few months.<br />
Question You have, over the past 12 monthsI very strongly as a<br />
Government pointed out the fact that inflation in the major<br />
problem. In recent times, recent months, you've now put<br />
forward a lot of emphasis on the employment and unemployment<br />
problem. Do you think the electorate is going to accept the<br />
fact that you as a Government are sincere, now that you have<br />
taken over the unemployment position.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I would certainly hope so and I can't see why not because<br />
inflation is still the major problem in getting people back<br />
to long-term productive work in Australian enterprises and<br />
Australian businesses. That can be very simple. If you've<br />
got people in a certain factory and wages go up too much<br />
the goods in that factory will have to be made more<br />
expensive and if the wages go up too much it can have<br />
such an impact on the costs of the factory that whatever it<br />
produces can be just priced out of the market. / 3 </p>
<p>3-<br />
Prime Minister ( continued)<br />
Now it can be priced out of export markets and that's<br />
probably the first result, but it can then be priced out<br />
of the domestic market and if that happens the jobs that<br />
were once provided by that factory no longer exist.<br />
