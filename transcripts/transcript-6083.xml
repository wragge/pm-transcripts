EMBARGOED AGAI'NST DELIVERY<br />
ADDRESS BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON R. J. H': KE, M. P.<br />
TO THE NATIONAL ECONOMIC SU':-IIT CO: NFERENCE<br />
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES CANBERRA<br />
11 APRIL 1983<br />
On behalf of the Australian government, I have the greatest<br />
pleasure in welcoming all participants and observers to this historic National<br />
Economic Summit Conference.<br />
And I make that welcome not only on behalf of the government of<br />
Australia, but on behalf of the people of Australia.<br />
For in a very real sense, we meet here today as the representatives<br />
of the Australian people, in a time of Australia's gravest economic crisis<br />
in fifty years. So it is entirely fitting that this conference should assemble in<br />
the House of Representatives in the national capital.<br />
It is true that we have not been directly elected for the purpose<br />
of this conference. But the conference itself springs from the very clear instruction<br />
of the Australian people, given in the national elections, just over one<br />
month ago. I do not think there can be the slightest doubt that the proposal<br />
for this national economic conference, including its composition, has been<br />
clearly endorsed by the Australian people.<br />
And in that sense going to the very heart of the Australian<br />
democratic tradition we meet here by the express !: ill of the people of<br />
Australia. So we meet not only as the representatives of our respective<br />
governments and organisations, but as the representatives of the Australian<br />
people. And whatever our responsibilities and obllations to any particular<br />
group or interest or organisation, I trust that all of us, throughout this<br />
conference, :; ill keep to the forefront of our concern.-, our wider respon. 3bLlttL.<br />
to the people of Australia.<br />
They have imposed a high trust upon us. We must try our very best<br />
not to let them down.<br />
From the outset I should enpha; L that thii., ccaf crence has a dr,: be<br />
purpose the puriposcs are both of . t specific kLnd and of a synbotlic kind.<br />

<p>The specific purposes of this conference may be better understood by<br />
reference to its origins. Emphatically, this was not a proposal drummed up<br />
for the purposes of the recent election campaign.<br />
The call for it had come from many representative sections of the<br />
community. I myself had long been its advocate and in an address to the<br />
Australian Institute of Political Science Summer School on 30 January this<br />
year a date, you will note, on which certain events were, to say the least,<br />
still unforeseen I had this to say;<br />
" We will convene a national surmmit conference with representatives<br />
from the employers, the ACTJ and the State governments. This will<br />
not be some half-day superficial point-scoring exercise but a<br />
completely honest attempt to expose all of us, together, to the<br />
realities of what is happening in the domestic and international<br />
economic scene and the problems, dangers, opportunities and challenges<br />
of what is involved in those developments.<br />
As a logical extension of that process of knowledge acquisicion and<br />
sharing there would then be in that context an attempt to analyse<br />
the reciprocal implications of movements in wages, profits, patterns<br />
of work and industrial reconstruction. This conference would clearly<br />
occupy several days and provision would be made for an early follow-up<br />
if the parties considered it desirable to have further discussions<br />
after the opportunity to digest and analyse the breadth of information<br />
and views presented to them".<br />
I think it will be acknowledged that the concept and procedures<br />
which I then outlined on 30 January 1983, have been followed faithfully in<br />
the arrangements for this conference.<br />
The results we seek and these must be regarded as only a minimum<br />
measure of our success should be:<br />
. first, a heightened appreciation of the need to work constructively<br />
together to meet the great challenges now confronting our country;<br />
. and second, an increased likelihood of all participants tailoring<br />
their expectations and claims upon the community's resources to the<br />
capacities of the economy, and the urgent need for a reduction in<br />
unemployment and a restoration of growth to an economy now in deep<br />
recession. In pursuit of our specific undertaking to make this an informationsharing<br />
occasion, we have already provided a range of maiterial for the use of<br />
all participants at this conference. 1* 3 </p>
<p>In addition, further background papers will be made available<br />
during the conference.<br />
You will already be aware that a Steering Committee for the Sunmmit<br />
has been established to assist in the conduct of the conference.<br />
Its members are myself, the Premier of New South Wales, Mr Wran,<br />
the Premier of Queensland, Mr Bjelke-Petersen, MI'essrs Dolan, Fitzgibbon a~ nd<br />
Kelty of the ACTU, and Hr Hughes, President of CAI, Mr Bridgland, President<br />
of AIDA, and ' Mr John Utz (' Vormald International Ltd).<br />
You have before you the proposed Agenda for our conference.<br />
But of course, the flow of the Agenda will be determined by the<br />
conference itself. I wholeheartedly accept that this conference should enjoy<br />
the freedom which the Parliament of this nation itself asserts and that is<br />
the principle that this conference is master of its own destinies.<br />
Those are among the specific purposes and procedures of this conference.<br />
But as I have said, it also has a symbolic purpose and value.<br />
This conference itself is part of the process of bringing Australia<br />
together. Behind the concept of the conference lies my long-held belief<br />
a belief I am convinced is now shared by the overwhelming majority of the<br />
Australian people that Australia can no longer afford to go down the path of<br />
confrontation and fragmentation which has embittered and disfigured so many<br />
aspects of the national life, for much of the past decade.<br />
It is not only a question of the need for national reconciliation<br />
in this current economic crisis.<br />
It goes far beyond that. It is a question of the shape of the<br />
future of Australia, as we approach the end of the twentieth century.<br />
4 </p>
<p>-4-<br />
The twenty-first century is only seventeen years away and that<br />
same year, indeed the very same day, the first of January 2001, will see<br />
Australia enter its second century as a united Commonwealth.<br />
And I deeply believe that this conference has a part to play,<br />
not only in the urgent and immediate task of achieving national economic<br />
recovery, but in laying foundations for the whole future of this great<br />
country of ours.<br />
I think it can be said without any exaggeration, that this is part<br />
of a process and an important part in establishing what sort of Australia<br />
our children will inherit for the rest of this century and beyond.<br />
So, in a double sense, this is an historic conference historic<br />
not only in the sense that nothing of this scale and scope has been attempted<br />
before, but as an event of genuine and seminal importance in the life and<br />
history of Australia.<br />
Let me say very firmly, that when I speak of the consensus on<br />
Austali's economic and social problems which I hope will emerge from this<br />
conference, I am not settling and none of us should be prepared to settle<br />
for the lowest common denominator, the barest minimum of agreement on an<br />
approach to a solution of the current crisis.<br />
If a genuine consensus is to emerge, it must mean an understanding<br />
on the part of all sections of the Australian community, of the constraints<br />
they will be called upon to accept and the contribution they will be called<br />
upon to make to the process of national reconciliation, national recovery and<br />
national reconstruction. It will mean a recognition and acceptance of restraint by all sections<br />
of the community. It must mean a recognition a sense of realism of what can<br />
be achieved in the near future.<br />
We must all understand that there are no miracle cures, no overnight<br />
solutions. It calls for a sustained, concerted national effort. This conterence<br />
is only a beginning. </p>
<p>Specifically, the tasks this conference should set itself are:<br />
to secure broad agreement on the role of an incomes and prices policy,<br />
in our efforts to promote employment and to achieve recovery and<br />
growth; and to ensure that the benefits of recovery are not lost<br />
in another round of the wages-prices spiral;<br />
to devise machinery for achieving the necessary restraint, including<br />
methods of wage fixation, influencing non-wage incomes, and price<br />
surveillance; to secure a better and wider understanding of the broad economic<br />
framework, within which we have to operate;<br />
to seek broad agreement on the relationship between a successful<br />
prices and incomes policy and the implementation of policies on<br />
industrial relations, job creation and training, taxation, social<br />
security, health, education, and the other major community services;<br />
to examine the competitiveness and efficiency of the Australian economy;<br />
and finally, to reach agreement on arrangements and machinery to monitor<br />
and continue the work of this conference, especially in regard to<br />
continuing the process of consultation and co-operation between<br />
government, business and unions, initiated by this conference itself.<br />
And of course, i must repeat what I made very clear during the<br />
recent election campaign.<br />
This conference and its outcome can in no way be a substitute for<br />
effective government policies. The governments of Australia, and in particular,<br />
the national government, cannot escape and do not wish to escape their<br />
primary and fundamental responsibility for the economic and social policies<br />
of this nation. But effective policy can not be made in a vacuum.<br />
Decisions that are going to achieve our great national objectives can not<br />
be made in isolation from the economic and social realities.<br />
And the purpose ol this conference is to expose us all, including<br />
those with direct responsibility for government decision-making, to those<br />
realities the realities of the current situation and the realities of what<br />
must be done if there is to be a resolution of Australia's present crisis.<br />
I shall not pre-empt the Treasurer, who will later address you<br />
on the economic position and outlook. .1/ 6 </p>
<p>But, while Mr Keating will outline the serious and complex nature<br />
of the problems, there, can be no doubt that they are encapsulated in the<br />
question of unemployment, and the need for a restoration of sustained<br />
economlic growth which avoids a new bout of destructive inflation.<br />
The first problem is how to arrest the explosion in the unemployment level<br />
and then move towards its steady reduction, with the ultimate goal of<br />
genuine full employment as fundamental national economic policy the<br />
bipartisan goal adopted for the first three decades of the post-war era.<br />
It is easy enough to quote all the grim statistics which show<br />
that we face the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression itself.<br />
But behind the statistics lies an even grimmer human reality.<br />
The raw statistics do not show what unemployment means in terms of<br />
the loss of human dignity and self-respect, what it means in terms of the<br />
break-up of families and the social alienation of one-third of the best and<br />
brightest generation we have ever produced, what it means in terms of the<br />
defeat of human hope and the crushing of the human spirit.<br />
The statistics do not show the special difficulties faced by particular<br />
groups the particular burdens placed on young people, on women in the<br />
workforce, on single parents, on migrants, on aborigines. There are identifiable<br />
groups in this community experiencing unemployment at levels as high as, or<br />
even higher than, any ever experienced in the worst years of the Great Depression<br />
itself. For example, total unemployment in .1932 the worst year reached<br />
29 percent. Unemployment in the 15 to 19 age group is already at least as<br />
high as that. It is true that today we have a social security network far in<br />
advance of any that existed 50 years ago.<br />
But while the material deprivation of unemiployment may not be now<br />
so severe, yet, in another sense, unemployment in the 1980s imposes a burden<br />
more crushing than in the 1930s.<br />
And the reason for that is that the expectations to which the people<br />
are entitled, are now so much higher and so they should be.<br />
This is particularly true for the younger generation which is bearing<br />
the heaviest brunt of the present recession.<br />
And le-t us never forget because it is a me. as ure of our personatl<br />
respons~ bility that it is our generation which taught the new generation to<br />
hold those expoc tat ions, and that sense of Ontitlemocnt oz; what this rich,<br />
Ldvanced nat ic'n of ours should offer them.<br />
;. Je c-innot escape o'ur p, rqo[ wI zro-ponsibi Lit-. y </p>
<p>-7-<br />
This conference gives us all an unprecedented opportunity to<br />
fulfil at least a small part of that responsibility, individually and<br />
collectively, in both the personal sense and the national sense.<br />
When we look around the world today, we can see that those<br />
comparable countries comparable in their political, economic and industrial<br />
systems, comparable in their standards of living, comparable in their<br />
national aspirations which have had most success in surmounting the<br />
present international economic crisis, are those where governments, business<br />
and unions and the community as a whole, have agreed on common goals and<br />
objectives and have co-operated together for their achievement.<br />
we have to remember at all times that Australia, in common with<br />
the rest of the industrialised world, is passing through one of the most<br />
dramatic periods of social, economic and technological changes in recorded<br />
numan history. We have to be prepared for social and economic responses as<br />
innovative and radical as the technological achievements which are creating<br />
this profound revolution in human affairs, in lifestyles, in work patterns<br />
and opportunities. We cannot put the clock back.<br />
This leads me to the very heart of what I believe we must be<br />
about in this conference and the times ahead. So often in our affairs<br />
the emphasis has been put upon the competing struggle between wage and<br />
salary earners and business, and residually, welfare recipients.<br />
I believe we must come to put the emphasis upon the fact that<br />
they all have a common goal and therefore a common interest. They all<br />
seek the same thing the maintenance, and through time, an improvement,<br />
of their standards of living. The indispensable condition fo r the<br />
achievement of this common legitimate goal is real economic growth<br />
an increase in the per capita output of goods and services.<br />
The attitudes, assumptions and expectations of those participants<br />
in the economic and social * processes have been fashioned by the environment<br />
in which they operated. For a generation and a half that environment was<br />
characterised by the conditions of full employment, low inflation and<br />
steady economic growth. SuchI an environment was able, with relative case,<br />
to accommodate the unco-urdinated indeed, adversary-type pursuit of<br />
competing claims. While this proces,; certainly did not provide optimal1<br />
reaL growth, the growti that dIid OCCLIC sustained the process. </p>
<p>For a range of reasons applying not only to our own country<br />
but operating in varying degree throughout the world, those conditions<br />
no longer characterise our economy indeed the opposite conditions of<br />
high unemployment, high inflation and recessed, even negative, growth<br />
are now the predominant characteristics.<br />
In all aspects of human behaviour there is always a time-lag in<br />
the perceptions of change in the rele'vant environment. This has been true<br />
of us here in Australia in the way we have conducted our economic and<br />
social affairs. The attitudes, assumptions and expectations w. hich reflected<br />
a former environment are no longer adequate to meet the changed circumstances<br />
which characterise our more recent and present condition.<br />
Yet the common goal the goal of maintaining and increasing<br />
standards remains legitimate. The very essence of our rmut-lal task<br />
now is to work together to recreate those conditions in which the<br />
achievement of that legitimate, common, goal is possible.<br />
We can restore growth and we can significantly reduce<br />
inflation. The task of restoring full employment as we knew it<br />
will be harder. But we can, if we work together with this sense<br />
of common purpose, also make real progress towards that goal. To move<br />
again towards balance in the field of employ-ment, we must of course<br />
make decisions calculated to produce more jobs. We MuLst also,<br />
I believe, as a concerned society together examine the other side of the<br />
equation the demand for jobs to see whether we may~ be able to<br />
provide fulfilment in life for some of our people alongside the<br />
conventional production system. 9 </p>
<p>-9-<br />
It is of the greatest importance that we should make the right<br />
economic decisions. But that is not enough. There is no single " correct"<br />
decision that can of itself solve our present economic and social problems<br />
any more than a single " wrong" decision was responsible for the present crisis.<br />
While I am confident that this conference will help significantly to create<br />
the framework for better decision-making and a better economic performance<br />
in this nation, that is only a beginning. It will not be enough for any<br />
of us to say at the end of this conference: " So much for that the rest<br />
is up to the government". Both the immediate problems to which we are<br />
addressing ourselves and these more far-reaching challenges to the whole<br />
social, economic and industrial fabric of the nation, require much more than<br />
that. They call for a deep and continuing commitment by governents and<br />
the community alike. They call for the application of those qualities of<br />
innovation, initiative, independence, tolerance and need I say, mateship<br />
the qualities which we like to think are distinctively Australian.<br />
It is not without significance that Australia's unemployment<br />
has now reached the level to which it had risen at the outbreak of the<br />
Second World War, which itself prevented the onset of another Depression.<br />
That is one measure of the magnitude of the task before us.<br />
During the recent campaign, I frequently drew the parallel between<br />
the supreme crisis of the early 1940s; and the present crisis.<br />
Of course, the two are very different in nature and scale.<br />
Survival itself was at stake in 1942. But in one sense, the present crisis<br />
is more complex and at least as challenging to our resourcefulness as a<br />
people. Then, the challenge was clear, identifiable and external. Today,<br />
the chief challenge comes from within.<br />
But now as then every bit as much as in 1942 the essential<br />
requirement for victo ry remains the same the united effort of a united<br />
people working together to achieve agreed goals and common objectives. </p>
<p>More than forty years ago, one of the very greatest of all Australians<br />
stood in this place in this historic chamber to give this message to the<br />
people of Australia. On that occasion, 16 December 1941, John Curtin said:<br />
" Our Australian mode of life, our conditions, our seasons, all<br />
that go to make up the natural conditions of living, make us<br />
better equipped ( for the purpose of meeting this crisis) than<br />
are the peoples of many other countries.., the qualitative capacity<br />
of our population compensates in large measure for the shortage<br />
of our numbers I, like each of you, have seen this country<br />
at work, engaged in pleasure, and experiencing adversity;<br />
I have seen it face good times and evil times, but I have never<br />
known a time in which the inherent quality of Australia has to be<br />
used so unstintingly as at this hour".<br />
, MY fellow Australians, I do not pretend to compare the scale of<br />
the crisis through which John Curtin steered this nation to triumph with<br />
our task today. But I do believe that the essential elements which John Curtin<br />
defined as the key to victory are as relevant in 1983 as they were in 1941.<br />
And by far the most important of all is the quality of our people.<br />
I do not believe for one moment that the essential quality of our people has<br />
in any way declined since 1941. On the contrary, it has been enriched and<br />
strengthened by the contribution of the millions of our fellow citizens drawn<br />
from nearly every country and race around the world.<br />
If we at this conference dedicate ourselves to provide leadership to<br />
this great people, I have absolute confidence that they will respond with a<br />
united effort and a renewed determination to beat this crisis and to build an<br />
even better future for this great nation, Australia. </p>
