SPEECH BY THE PRIN; E MINISTER,<br />
THE HOIN. E. G. WHITLA-Q. C . Hi. P.,<br />
AT NORNINGTON PENISINSULA MUN ICIPALITIES ASSOCIATION,<br />
MORNINGTON, VIC. 12 AUGUST 1975<br />
IT GIVES ME GREAT PLEASURE TO BE HERE WITH<br />
YOU TONIGHT AS A GUEST OF THE QUARTERLY SOCIAL EVENING<br />
ASSEMBLY OF THE MORNINGTON PENINSULA, MUNICIPALITIES<br />
ASSOCIATION. I PAY TRIBUTE TO YOUR VISION IN CHOOSING<br />
TO MEET TOGETHER, IN ASSOCIATION, WITH THE BEST INTERESTS<br />
OF YOUR PENINSULA-AT HEART. WITHOUT SACRIFICING<br />
YOUR DISINCTIVE INDIVIDUAL ELEMENTS, YOU WERE FARSIGHTED<br />
ENOUGH TO REALISE THAT ON SOME MATTERS IT WOULD MAKE MUCH<br />
MORE SENSE TO GO IT TOGETHER RATHER THAN ALONE. I CAN<br />
UNDERSTAND THE INITIAL DIFFICULTIES YOU MIGHT HAVE FACED<br />
IN PERSUADING PEOPLE THAT A QUARTERLY MEETING TOGETHER WAS NOT.<br />
TANTAMOUNT TO SELLING OUT YOUR BIRTHRIGHT, BUT POSSIBLY A<br />
STEP TOWARDS RECOVERING THAT BIRTHRIGHT, PARTICULARLY<br />
IN AN AREA SO ENVIRONMENTALLY SENSITIVE AS THE HIORNINGTON<br />
PENINSULA, / 2 </p>
<p>2..<br />
IAM QUITE SURE THAT EACH MEMBER ORGANISATION<br />
THE CITY OF FRANKSTON AND THE SHIRES OF FLINDERS,<br />
HASTINGS AMD JORNINGTON ITSELF -VALUES THE OPPORTUNITY<br />
OF SHARING PROBLEMS AND WORKING TOGETHER ON SOLUTIONS<br />
WHICH WILL BENEFIT THE QUALITY OF LIFE IN THE WHOLE<br />
OF THE [ iORNINGTON PENINSULA. AND NOT JUST ONE PART OF<br />
IT,. YOU HAVE A GREAT DEAL TO TEACH MANY OTHER DISTRICTS,<br />
MANY OTHER LOCAL GOVERNMENT BODIES WHO MAY BE STILL INCLINED<br />
TO SHY OFF THE IDEA OF ANY KIND OF REGIONALISM FOR FEAR<br />
OF LOSING THEIR " INDIVIDUAL IDENTITIES. YOU HAVE<br />
DEMONSTRATED, WITH YOUR ASSOCIATION, THAT THIS IS AN<br />
UNFOUNDED FEAR. INDEED YOU ALL BELONG, AS WELL, TO<br />
THE WESTERNPORT REG I ONAL ORGANI SATI ON OF COUN'CI LS WHICH<br />
HAS DRAWN SUPPORT FROM THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT'S<br />
. REGIONAL ORGANISATION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM,<br />
IT IS GRATIFYING TO ATTEND GATHERINGS<br />
LIKE THIS, BECAUSE THEY PROVIDE AN EXCELLENT OPPORTUNITY<br />
FOR ME TO HEAR AT FIRST HAND HOW THINGS ARE GOING AT THE<br />
GRASS ROOTS LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT, THE ONE CLOSEST<br />
TO THE PEOPLE, IN THE LAST THREE MONTHS I HAVE ATTENDED<br />
LOCAL GOVERNMENT FUNCTIONS FROM FUMUT To LAUNCESTON.<br />
FROM IPSWICH TO FOF; SES AND IN THE SPRAWLING SUBURBS<br />
OF SYDNEY WHICH FORM MY OWN ELECTORATE. THE ACTUAL,<br />
PROBLEMS DIFFER FROM PLACE TO PLACE, ACCORDING TO<br />
DEMOGRAPHIC SHIFTS, BUT ESSENTIALLY THE CONSTANT ISSUE<br />
IS HOW BEST TO FACILITATE THE DELIVERY OF GOVERNMENT<br />
SERVICES TO PEOPLE WHERE THEY LIVE, BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT<br />
AFFECTS THE QUALITY OF THEIR LIVES, </p>
<p>L2 3.<br />
THERE WAS A TIME, OF COURSE, WHEN PRIME<br />
f "] INISTERS TENDED NOT TO GET INVOLVED IN AN YTHIN', G AS<br />
ORDINARY AND BASIC AND RELEVANT AS LOCAL GOVERNMENT.<br />
IT WAS BENEATH THEIR DIGNITY TO BOTHER THEMSELVES WITH<br />
HOW LOCAL GOVERNMENT COULD POSSIBLY MAKE ENDS MEET,<br />
WITH FIOW ESSENTIAL SERVICES COULD BE MADE AVAILABLE<br />
IN OUTER SUBURBAN' AREAS, WITH WHAT THE QUALITY OF LIFE<br />
WAS GOING TO BE LIKE FOR ANY BUT THE COMFORTABLY<br />
OFF. THAT WAS THE TIME WHEN LOCAL GOVERNMENT WAS<br />
RATHER LESS THAN A POOR RELATION, MORE LIKE A<br />
FOUINDLIN'IG THAT NEITHER PREMIERS NOR PRIME MINISTERS<br />
WANTED TO KNOW ABOUT. BUT THINGS HAVE CHANGED, CHANGED<br />
UTTERLY, ANID IN A REMARKABLY SHORT TIME,<br />
JUST TWO WEEKS AGO, WE ANNOUN CED THIS YEAR'S<br />
GRANTS COMMISSION ALLOCATIONS TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT BODIES,<br />
$ 79,908,000 THROUGHOUT AUSTRALIA, WITH $ 20,21-2,000<br />
COMING TO VICTORIA. IT MAY NOT BE TOO OBVIOUS IF I MIENTION<br />
THAT $/ 410,000 CAME TO THLE INDIVIDUAL SHIRE AND CITY COUNICILS<br />
MAKING UP THE 1': 1ORNINGTON PENINSULA N'UNICIPALITIES ASSOCIATION,<br />
THIS YEAR,) GRANTS REPRESENT AN INCREASE OF 387. FOR<br />
VICTORIA ON LAST YEAR'S GRANTS, AND THE LEVEL OF PER<br />
CAPITA ASSISTANCE HAS RISEN FROM $ 4.07 IN 1974/ 75 TO<br />
$ 5.58 IN 1975/ 76. o,/ a4 </p>
<p>IT'S SO EASY NOW TO TALK ABOUT THIS<br />
YEAR IS AND LAST YEARIS ALLOCATIONS AS THOUGH THEY<br />
HAVE ALWAYS BEEN AROUND. BUT, OF COURSE, THEY HAVEN'T.<br />
REMEMBER WHAT A STRUGGLE WE HAD TO GET THE PRINCIPLE<br />
OF FUNDING ACCEPTED? SOME OF YOU MIGHT RECALL A CERTAIN<br />
SECTION OF MY POLICY SPEECH IN 1972:<br />
" VIE WILL GIVE LOCAL GOVERNMENT FULL<br />
ACCESS TO THE LOAN COUNCIL AND GRANTS COMMISSION<br />
NOT ONLY BECAUSE THE BURDENS BORNE BY TAXPAYERS AS<br />
RATEPAYERS MUST BE REDUCED, BUT BECAUSE THE INEQUALITIES<br />
MUST BE ATTACKED BY THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT ACTING<br />
WITH AND THROUGH LOCAL GOVERNMENT."<br />
IT WASN'T A VERY GLAMOROUS PROMISE BUT<br />
IT WAS AN1 IMPORTANT ONE, AND IT WAS ATTACKED BY OUR<br />
OPPONENTS AT STArE AND FEDERAL LEVELS, IBECAUSE THEY<br />
WERE NOT INTERESTED IN THE RESPONSIBILITIES AND BURDENS<br />
OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT, THEY WERE UNABLE TO RESPOND TO<br />
OUR PLEDGE TO HELP LOCAL GOVERNMENT IN ANY WAY OTHER THAN<br />
TO KICK THE CENTRALIST CAN, BUT AS I POINTED OUT IN<br />
ANOTHER POLICY SPEECH, IN MAY LAST YEAR,<br />
" THE ROLE WE ASSIGN TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT IS THE REAL<br />
ANSWER TO CHARGES OF CENTRALISM. UNDER A VARIETY OF<br />
PROGRAMS WE HAVE PROVIDED LOCAL GOVERNMENT WITH THE FUNDS<br />
TO UNDERTAKE THE RANGE OF ACTIVITIES PREVIOUSLY<br />
INADEQUATELY CARRIED OUT OR TOTALLY NEGLECTED." 1 </p>
<p>I THEN MIENTIONED THE AUS;' RALIANi AssISTANCE<br />
PLAN WHICH IS NOW UNDER CHALLENGE BY YOUR STATE<br />
GOVERNMENT, ALONG WITH SUCH SUBVERSIVE PROGRAMS AS<br />
MEALS ON WHEELS, HANDICAPPED PERSONS' WELFARE, HOME<br />
NURSING SUBSIDIES AND BLOOD TRANSFUSION SERVICES.<br />
THE HIGH COURT CHALLENGE WILL DETERMINE<br />
WHETHER THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT CAN GIVE DIRECT<br />
HELP TO THESE WELFARE SERVICES MANY OF THEM BEGUN<br />
UNDER PREVIOUS PRIME MINISTERS, VICTORIAN PRIME MINISTERS<br />
LIKE HENZIES, AND GORTON AND WHETHER SUCH AID MUST PASS<br />
THROUGH THE DELAYING HANDS OF STATE GOVERNMENTS<br />
OF WHATEVER HUE. BUT ALL THE PEOPLE IN RECEIPT OF<br />
THESE SERVICES CARE ABOUT IS THAT THEY SHOULD BE PROVIDED<br />
WHEN THEY ARE NEEDED. THEY ARE NOT LIKELY TO BE<br />
SPEEDED UP BY PASSING THROUGH ANOTHER BUREAUCRACY.<br />
LOCAL GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES COULD TESTIFY TO THIS,<br />
PARTICULARLY HERE IN THE MORNINGTON PENINSULAR WHERE<br />
YOU HAVE NOT ONLY L12% OF YOUR POPULATION UNDER 21,<br />
BUT ALSO A VERY HIGH PROPORTION OF ELDERLY AND RETIRED<br />
PEOPLE WHO WILL BECOME INCREASINGLY DEPENDENT ON THE<br />
SERVICES UNDER CHALLENGE IN THE HIGH COURT. ALREADY<br />
A REGIONAL COUNCIL FOR: SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN<br />
ESTABLISHED THROUGH THE AUSTRALIAN ASSISTANCE PLAN IN THE<br />
WESTERNPORT REGION, AND IT HAS RECEIVED $ 57,468 IN THE<br />
LAST TWO YEARS. </p>
<p>6,<br />
IN 1975/ 76, DEPENDING ON THE SUCCESS OF THE<br />
VICTORIAN GOVERNMENT'S CHALLENGE, THIS REGIONAL<br />
COUNCIL WILL HAVE ACCESS TO AN ADMINISTRATIVE GRANT<br />
OF $ 10,000 AS WELL AS GRANTS OF $ 12,000 EACH FOR FOUR<br />
COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT OFFICERS. I LEAVE YOU TO<br />
DECIDE WHETHER SUCH ASSISTANCE COULD BE PROVIDED<br />
MORE EFFECTIVELY IF IT HAD TO BE CHANNELLED THROUGH<br />
STATE GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES, HAVING ORIGINATED<br />
WITH AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS,<br />
IT'S DISTRESSING TO SEE HOW OTHER EFFORTS<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT HAS MADE ON BEHALF OF LOCAL<br />
GOVERNMENT HAVE BEEN THWARTED BY STATE GOVERNMENT,<br />
BY STATE PREMIERS. YOU WILL RECALL OUR INSISTENCE THAT<br />
LOCAL GOVERNMENT BE REPRESENTED AT THE CONSTITUTIONAL<br />
CONVENTION. BUT WE PROMISED ALSO TO GIVE YOU ACCESS TO<br />
THE LOAN COUNCIL, AND I THOUGHT THAT I HAD SECURED SOME<br />
SORT OF AGREEMENT FROM THE PREMIERS AT THAT CONVENTION<br />
IN SEPTEMBER 1973. W'HEN TiHEY C'IME TO C/ NBERRA THE NEXT<br />
MONTH, OCTOBER 1973, TO DISCUSS THE PROPOSAL, ALL THE<br />
OLD PREJUDICES WERE ON SHOW AGAIN, ALL THE OLD JEALOUSIES<br />
WERE PARADED, AND THE VOTES OF STATE PREMIERS EXCLUDED<br />
LOCAL GOVERNMENT FROM THE LOAN COUNCIL. So THEN WE TOOK<br />
IT TO A REFERENDUM. THE OFFICIAL CASE FOR NO WAS A<br />
MARVEL OF MISREPRESENTATION, DELIBERATELY CREATING<br />
CONFUSION IN PEOPLE'S MINDS ABOUT THE FUNCTIONS OF THE<br />
LOANS COUNCIL AND THE GRANTS COMMISSION, NEVERTHELESS,<br />
IN VICTORIA 47,383 VOTED YES, BECAUSE ENOUGH PEOPLE<br />
IN VICTORIA REALISED HOW VITALLY THE PROPOSAL COULD AFFECT<br />
THEM AS TAXPAYING, RATEPAYING CITIZENS, </p>
<p>-7-<br />
NOR WERE VICTORIANS IMPRESSED BY THE VIGOUR WITH WHICH<br />
OUR OPPONENTS KICKED T HE CENTRALIST CAN IN THAT WHOLE<br />
CAMPAIGN, As I SAID IN I'IAY LAST YEAR, THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
ASSISTANCE PLAN AND SIMILAR PROGRAMS " ARE ALL ACTIVITIES<br />
WHICH CANNOT BE CLOSELY REGULATED FROM THE CENTRE AND<br />
ARE BEST PLANNED BY LOCAL GOVERNMENT WORK( ING WITH LOCAL<br />
COMMUNITIES." So MUCH FOR OUR CENTRALIST POLICIES,<br />
IWELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY TO CLEAR UP THAT PARTICULAR<br />
MISCONCEPTION, AND I AM GLAD THAT OUR SECOND ANNUAL<br />
GRANTS COMMISSION ALLOCATIONS, LlIKE LAST YEAR'IS), HAVE<br />
NO STRINGS ATTACHED. THAT IS IN LINE WITH THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT'S FAITH IN THE FUNDAMENTAL GOOD<br />
SENSE OF LOCAL GOV/ ERNMENT AND ITS ABILITY TO ORDER<br />
IT-S OWN AFFAIRS AND SET ITS OWN PRIORITIES.<br />
FOR flY PART, I WILL BE PARTICIPATING IN A SPECIAL<br />
MEETING IN CANBERRA TOMORROW OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL<br />
IN 16-<br />
CONVENTION-3 G COMMITTEE DEALING WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENT.<br />
FRESH FROMIS AHRN TONIGHT, I WILL BE ABLET<br />
GIVE PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO THE WORK( ING PARTY REPORTS<br />
ON THE SUBMISSION MADE TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION<br />
BY THE AUSTRALIAN COUNCIL ON LOCAL GOVERNM ENT. WE SHALL<br />
ALSO BE CONSIDERING THE GENERAL QUESTION OF GRANTS TO<br />
LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND THE PROBLEMS INVOLVED IN BORROWING.<br />
BY THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT ON BEHALF OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT.<br />
SO YOU CAN SEE THAT OUR CONCERN FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT DOES<br />
NOT STOP WITH THOSE STRAIGHT OUT., NO-STRINGS ATTACHED<br />
GRANTS COMMISSION ALLOCATIONS. A </p>
<p>-7, ATHE<br />
AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT HAS ALSO MOVED IN<br />
OTHER AREAS TO HELP LIFT THE FINANCIAL BURDENS OF<br />
LOCAL GOVERNMENT, AND TO ENSURE AS MUCH EQUALITY AS<br />
POSSIBLE BETWIEEN REGIONS, ATTEMPTING TO ENSURE THAT<br />
PEOPLE ARE NOT DISADVANTAGED BECAUSE THEY LIVE<br />
IN ONE REGION RATHER THAN ANOTHER, WE ARE ATTEMPTING<br />
TO REDUCE THE GAPS APPARENT IN THE PROVISION OF BASIC<br />
SERVICES LIKE SEWERAGE PROGRAMS, URBAN LOCAL ROADS<br />
AND TRANSPORT, CHILD CARE PROGRAMS, ATTEMPTING TO<br />
REDUCE THE INEQUALITIES BETWEEN REGIONS WHICH HAVE<br />
BEGGARED THE QUALITY OF LIFE IN THIS COUNTRY, </p>
<p>-8-<br />
TAKE SEWERAGE, FOR EXAMPLE, IT IWASN'T A VERY NICE<br />
WORD TC INTRODUCE INTO MY POLICY SPEECH IN 1972, BUT I DEFIED<br />
THE NICETIES AND MENTIONED IT, AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, WE HAVE<br />
DONE SOMETHING ABOUT IT IN THIS AREA. IN CONSULTATION WITH<br />
STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES WE HAVE EMBARKED ON A NATIONAL<br />
TEN YEAR PROGRAM TO CLEAR THE BACKLOG IN SEWERAGE SERVICES,<br />
AND IN 1974/ 75, $ 2 MILLION WAS MADE AVAILABLE TO AUTHORITIES<br />
IN THE MORNINGTON PENINSULA AREA FOR RETICULATION ANDt<br />
TREATMENT IORKS. IT I'S HARD: TO REALISE THAT THIS KIND OF<br />
EXPENDITURE ONLY CAME IN WITH A FEDERAL LABOR GOVERNMENT,<br />
BUT WE ARE PROPERLY PROUD OF IT, I AND TO THINK JHAT JOHN GORTON<br />
ONCE DEROGATIV LY DESCRIBED ME AS TALKING LIKE A SHIRE<br />
PRESIDENT IT IS INTERESTING TO COMPARE THE CENSUS, FIGURES<br />
OF 1947, JUST AFTER THE , AR,: WITH THOSEOF'OUR LAST CENSUS<br />
iN 1971; IN 1947, MORNINGTON HAD 4004 PEOPLE; IN 1971, 14,289.<br />
IrN 1947 FLINDERS HAD, 7,561 PEOPLE; IN 171, 15,481. AND<br />
iN 1947 THEY COUNTED FRANKTON AND HASTINGS TOGETHER WITh<br />
11,672 PEOPLE. IN 1971, HASTINGS HAD GROWN TO 8,927.,<br />
FRANKSTON WAS UP TO 59,410. i<br />
. HILE THE AVERAGE AGE WAS 32.4 AT 1947 CENSUS TIME<br />
IN FRANKSTON/ HASTINGS IT HAD COME DOWN TO 28.7 BY 1971.<br />
THIS HELPS EXPLAIN WHY TODAY, 42 PER CENT OF THE POPULATION<br />
IS UNDER 21, AND. WHY THE CIY OF FRANKSTON ALIONE HAS 18<br />
STATE PRIMARY SCHOOLS, 4 HIGH SCHOOCS, 3 TECHNICAL SCHOOLS,<br />
7 PRIVATE SCHOOLS, 16 PRESCHOOLS AND 10 INFANT WELFARE CENTRES<br />
FOR ITS PRESENT POPULATION, OF 74,000,<br />

<p>REALISING THE EFFECT ON QUALITY OF LIFE OF<br />
INADEQUATE PUBLIC TRANSPORT GENERALLY, AND PARTICULARLY<br />
IN AREAS SUDDENLY SUBJECT TO COMMUTER PRESSURES,<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT IN 1973/ 74 APPROVED<br />
CONSTRUCTION OF A THIRD TRACK BETWEEN CAULFIELD AND<br />
MORDIALLOC, AND AN ADDITIONAL PLATFORM AT INTERMEDIATE<br />
STATIONS UNDER THE URBAN PUBLIC TRANSPORT PROGRAM.<br />
AT JUNJE 30 THIS YEAR, THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT HAD<br />
SPENT $ 1,9 MILLION ON THE PROJECT, WHOSE FIRST<br />
STAGE, ALREADY APPROVED, BETWEEN CAULFIELD AND<br />
CHELTENHAM IS ESTIMATED TO COST $ 6 MILLION,<br />
IN ADDITION TO THIS, $ 424,000 HAS BEEN SPENT ON<br />
URBAN LOCAL ROADS IN THE PENINSULA AREA IN 1974/ 75<br />
AND $ 5,663,500 ON LAND ACQUISITION AND CONSTRUCTION<br />
OF URBAN ARTERIAL ROADS, INCLUDING THE MIORNINGTON<br />
PENINSULA FREEWAY AND THE FRANKSTON FREEWAY,<br />
BUT COMMUNICATIONS DON'T STOP WITH ROADS<br />
AND RAILWAY LINES. LAST MONTH A NEW TELEPHONE EXCHANGE<br />
WAS OPENED AT MORNINGTON, ADDING TO THE 13 SMALL<br />
EXCHANGES OPENED SINCE 1972, AND NEW ONES ARE PLANNED<br />
FOR BAXTER, HASTINGS, LANGWARRrN, SOMERVILLE AND<br />

COME, [ HOISE WHO CAINE EARLY IN SEARCHI OF THE DISTRICT'S<br />
BEAUTY WOULD SURELY APPROVE, / 12 </p>
<p>AND IT IS IN THIS CONTEXT THAT THE URBANi<br />
LAND COUNCILS INVOLVEMENT IN THE PURCHASE OF<br />
HECTARES OF LAND ON THE MIORNINGTON PENINSULA AND 6 ON<br />
PHILLIP ISLAND MUST BE SEEN, THE URBANi LAND COUNCIL<br />
CONTRIBUTED $ IL! MILLION TOWARDS THE TOTAL COST OF.<br />
$ 2.1 MILLION IN 197L4/ 75, THE PENINSULA LAND WILL BE<br />
BROUGHT UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF THE VICTORIAN<br />
NATIONAL PARKS ACT 195 AND THE PHILLIP ISLAND<br />
HOLDING WILL BE ADDED TO EXISTING RESERVES.<br />
UNDER THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT'S INATIONAL<br />
ESTATE PROGRAM, THE IORNINGTON PENINSULA WILL BE<br />
INCLUDED IN A $ 21,000 COASTLINJE STUDY WHICH WILL BE<br />
CARRIED OUT BY THE MINISTRY FOR CONSERVATION AND THE<br />
TOWN AND COUNTRY PLANNING BOARD OF VICTORIA. ANOTHER<br />
GRANT OF $ 119,350 HAS ASSISTED WITH THE ACQUISITION<br />
OF" THE BRIARS" AS AGREED BETWEEN THE AUSTRALIAN AND<br />
VICTORIAN GOVERNMENTS AND THE " IORNINGTON SHIRE,<br />
TOURISM AND RECREATION GRANTS OF $ 80,000 HAVE GONE<br />
TOWARDS THE CONSTRUCTION OF SCENIC WALKWAYS AND AN<br />
INFORMATION BUREAU ON PHILLIP ISLAND,<br />
CLEARLY A GREAT DEAL HAS BEEN DONE ALREADY,<br />
BUT MUCH REMAINS TO BE DONE TO PRESERVE AND PROTECT<br />
THE BEST FEATURES OF THE PENINSULA, AND THIS IS A<br />
CHALLENGE TO THE WHOLE COMMUNITY, NO LESS TO INDIVIDUALS<br />
THAN TO SHIRES AND COUNCILS. EVERY EFFORT SHOULD BE<br />
MADE TO INVOLVE PEOPLE IN CARING ABOUT THE FUTURE BY<br />
ENCOURAGING THEM TO CARE ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS TODAY. </p>
<p>-13-<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN GOVER, N M'ENT HAS PROVIDED ASSISTANCE TO<br />
ENViRONMENTAL PROTECTION GROUPS ANXIOUS TO PREPARE<br />
PROPERLY DOCUMENTED SU. BMISSIONS ON CERTAIN DEVELOPMENTAL<br />
PROJECTS, BOTH THE NiOUNT ELIZA ASSOCIATION FOR<br />
ENVIRONMENTAL CARE AND THE AESTERNPORT AND PENINSULA<br />
PROTECTION COUNCIL HAVE RECEIVED GRANTS 1I THE LAST<br />
TWO YEARS. FINALLY I COME TO THE PARTICULAR PROBLEMS OF<br />
THE SHIRE OF HASTINGS, THE SITE OF A NUMBER OF<br />
DEVELOPMENTAL BATTLES OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS. IT IS<br />
MORE INSTRUCTIVE TO LOOK AT ITS INCOME AND EXPENDITURE<br />
FIGURES THAN ITS CENSUS FIGURES. IN 1961/ 52 THE<br />
INCOME OF THE HASTINGS SHIRE WAS $ 180,580 AND ITS<br />
EXPENDITURE $ 217,960, IN 197'!/ 75 ITS INCOME HAD RISEN<br />
SOMEWHAT: TO $ 2,123,00, To BE PRECISE, AND<br />
EXPENDITURE WAS A MERE $ 2,1! 4,14i. 1 THE REASON OF<br />
COURSE IS THE PHENOMENAL INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT IN THE<br />
AREA. IT MAY BE A CASE OF THE CHICKEN BEFORE THE EGG.<br />
BECAUSE IT ALL SEEMS TO HAVE HAPPENED AFTER THE/ LAID<br />
THE GOLDEN EGG IN SOMERVILLE, THEN CAME BP.' s OIL<br />
REFINERY AND LIQUID FUELS PIER AT CRIB POINT, THE Esso/<br />
BMHP. GAS FRACTIONALISATION PLANT AT LONG ISLAND, THE<br />
CRESCO FERTILIZER PLANT, WHICH WAS THEN REDEVELOPED BY<br />
Esso/ B,!, P, AND FINALLY-JOHN LYSAGHT'S INTEGRATED STEEL<br />
WORKS AT WESTERNPORT BAY, So FAR $ 92 MILLION HAS BEEN<br />
SPENT ON DEVELOPMENT. EVENTUALLY IT WILL COST IN EXCESS<br />
OF $ 1 BILLION AND PROVIDE EMPLOYMENT FOR 2,500 PEOPLE,<br />
850 OF WHOM ARE ALREADY ON THE JOB, ,/ 14 </p>
<p>a 14,<br />
THE FIGURES ARE REALLY QUITE STAGGERING, SO TOO ARE<br />
THE RESPONSIBILITIES IMPOSED ON HASTINGS SHIRE COUNCIL<br />
IN ENSURING THAT ALL THIS DEVELOPMENT, WITH ALL ITS<br />
ACTUAL AND POTENTIAL BENEFITS, SHOULD NOT BE AT THE<br />
EXPENSE OF THE QUALITY OF LIFE IN THE WHOLE M ORNINGTON<br />
PENINSULA AREA, I AM CONFIDENT THAT, ACTING IN CONCERT<br />
WITH THE OTHER MORNINGTON PENINSULA MUNICIPALITIES, AND IN<br />
THIS ASSOCIATION, YOU WILL MEET THAT CHALLENGE.<br />
CERTAINLY THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT WILL BE READY TO HELP. </p>
