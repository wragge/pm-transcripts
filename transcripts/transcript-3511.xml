NOTEI; S FR THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR DIAMOND VALLEY A. LP, IARBECIF<br />
2 D) ECEMBiER 19741<br />
J. I'/ IIAf BETTlIE PLACE TO CILLHIRATE LABHOR'S (&gt; REAT VICTORY TWO<br />
YEARS AGO THAN HElIRE IN DIAMOND VALLE: Y, ONIL OF TillE ECI IVE<br />
SEATS IN OUR DRIVL [ OR I'UowIR. LABOR WOULD STILL HAVE WON IN<br />
1972 WITHOUT ITS GAINS IN DIAMOND VALLEY, HOLT, CASEY AND<br />
LATROBE. IT WOULD STILL HAVE WON IN 19/ L WITHOUT ITS EXTRA<br />
GAINS IN ISAACS AND HENTY. THOSE SEATS, HOWEVER, PROVIDED<br />
THE SUBSTANCE OF OUR MAJORITY, IN 1972 AND AGAIN IN 1974,<br />
ITIS A PLEASANT IRONY THAT WE HAVE TWICE SECURED OUR NATIONAL<br />
MAJORITY THROUGH OUR VOTES IN THE VERY STATE THAT DENIED US<br />
GOVERNMENT FOR SO LONG. IN OUR VICTORY IN 1972 A GENERATION<br />
OF BITTERNESS AND DIVISION WAS PUT BEHIND US , lA<br />
NEW ERA OF HOPE AND CONFIDENCE FOR OUR PARTY, FOR OUR<br />
COUNTRY, WAS BORN. OUR POPULAR BASE IN THIS CITY, AND THIS<br />
STATE, tS NEVER BEEN STRONGER.<br />
2. I MUST SAY THAT I WOULD RATHER BE IN DIA. OND VALLEY THAN MR.<br />
SNEDDEN'S VALLEY. BETTER THIS VALLEY THAN DEATH VALLEY,<br />
;' iD THERE IS NOTHING LIKE A BARBECUE TO RALLY OUR SUPPORTERS<br />
THEY MAY NOT WALK OVER HOT COALS BUT AT LEAST THEY CAN<br />
GRILL In-: R STEAKS OVER THEM., I AM GLAD OF MR. SNEDDEN'S<br />
ACKNOWLEDGEMENT THAT THE HOTTER REGIONS OF THE HEREAFTER ARE<br />
RESERVED FOR HIS PARTY. dIHFM lABOR MEN WALK THROUGH THE<br />
VALLEY OF DEATH I HOPE THEY'LL GO UP INSTEAD OF DOWN.<br />

NEW MEMBERS TO OUR RANKS;, DAVID McKI'NZlII, TONY . AMB, PIACE<br />
MATHEWS, MAX OLDMLADUW, JOAN CHILD, GARElII CLAYTON THIY<br />
ARE ALL FIRST-RATE MLMBIRk';, IXCELLENT AC( UIJI'IIf I1ONS TO THE<br />
PARTY AND THE PARLIAMENT, THEY HAVE PARTICIPATED IN TIIE<br />
DEBATES AND DECISIONS THAT MADE POSSIBLE LABOR'S GREAT<br />
ACIIIEVEMENIS DURING I l I A'; IT WO YEARS,<br />
II, IHOSE YEARS HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT, AS YOU KNOW. IN THE LAST<br />
12 MONTHS, ESPECIALLY, WE HAVE FACED IMMENSELY<br />
COMPLEX ECONOMIC PROBLEMS. IT HAS BEEN A TEST OF OUR<br />
NERVE, OUR FAITH, OUR INGENUITY, WE HAVE HAD TO CONTEND<br />
WITH THE TWIN PROBLEMS OF INFLATION AND UNEMPLOYMENT THAT<br />
AFFL. ICT EVERY WESTERN COUNTRY. WE HAVE HAD TO FIGHT BOTH<br />
THOSE PROBLEMS AT THE SAME TIME, AND WE ARE CARRYING ON THE<br />
FIGHT WITh E'ERY AVAILABLE WEAPON, EVERY CONSTITUTIONAL<br />
POWER WE POSSESS. IF YOU COMPARE OUR PERFORMANCE WITH<br />
OTHERS AROUND THE '" ORLD I THINK YOU '. ILL Fi. D THAT WE ARE<br />
DOIN. G BETTER THAN PRACTICALLY ANY OTHER COUNTRY IN THE<br />
F ' T AGAINST UNEMPLOYMENT AND WE ARE HOLDING 0" OWN IN<br />
THE FIGHT AGAINST INFLATION. HAVE TAKEN ACTION ON r,, iY<br />
FRONTS. W RE READY. TO TAKE FURTHER ACTION WHENEVER IT<br />
IS NEEDED, / 3 </p>
<p>YUJ WOULDN'F BE IILIMAN IF YOU WEl RE NOT Ãµ IHtE' IMES DISPIRITED<br />
AND DISHEARTENED BY THE FRUSTRATIONS OF THE PAST YEAR. I<br />
SYMPATHISE WITH YOU. I SHARE YOUR FEELINGS. YOU COULDN'T<br />
BE HUMAN IF YOU WERE NOT SOMETIMES DISMAYED BY THE BARRAGE<br />
OF PROPAGANDA AGAINST US, BY THE MISREPRESENTATION, BY THE<br />
MALICE, THE OBSTRUCTION OF OUR OPPONENTS, BY THE OMISSIONS<br />
AND DISTORTIONS OF THE MEDIA, BY THE INCESSANT ATTACKS ON<br />
THE GOVERNMENT FROM VESTED INTERESTS WHETHER ITS REG<br />
ANSETT, BJELKE-PETERSEN, THE DOCTORS, THE WEALTHY PRIVATE<br />
SCHOOLS, OR WHOEVER ELSE IT MAY BE WITH A GRUDGE AGAINST<br />
US, THERE MUST BE TIMES WHEN YOU HAVE ASKED YOURSELVES:<br />
ISN'T THERE SOMETHING THE GOVERNMENT HAS DONE TO BE PROUD<br />
OF? ISN'T THERE SOMETHING THAT WILL GIVE THE LIE TO THESE<br />
AYTTACKS? THE TRUTH IS THAT WE HAVE A GREAT STORY TO TELL,<br />
A FI'F RECORD TO OUR CREDIT. I SHALL GIVE YOU SOME<br />
DETAILS f-IT SHORTLY. BUT THERE IS ONE FACT I ASK YOU<br />
TO REMEMBER: FOR ALL THE MOANINq AND GROANING, THE<br />
DOOM-TALK AND GLG,.. M-TALK OF OUR OPPONENS, AU3TRALIAN' 3 ARE<br />
EVERYWHERE BETTER OFF TODAY THAN THEY BEFORE LABOR<br />
C IN. THE REAL PURCHASING POWER OF AVERAGF TEKLY<br />
EARNINGS, ALLOWING FOR INFLATION, INCREASED BY 3 2% ti THE<br />
YEAR TO Jui,. 1973 AND BY A FURTHER 3.9 IN THF YEAR TO<br />
JUNE 1974 THAT'S A -N OF MORE THAN SEVEN PERCENT IN<br />
REAL LIVING STANDARDS UNDER
</p><p>6. J D) ON'T SUGGEST THAT OJR ACHIEVEMENTS SHOULD BE MEASURED<br />
IN MONETARY GAINS ALONE. INDEED, THE PURPOSE OF THE<br />
LABOR GOVERNMENT, ITS CENTRAL AMBITION, HAS BEEN TO OFFSET<br />
THE IMPORTANCE OF WAGES, OF TAKE-HOME PAY, AS THE SOLE<br />
DETERMINATION OF A FAMILY ' S STANDARD OF LIVING, nUR<br />
POLICIES ARE DESIGNED TO IMPROVE THOSE ESSENTIAL<br />
INGREDIENTS OF A CIVILIZED LIFE THAT ONLY GOVERNMENTS<br />
CAN PROVIDE A DECENr EDUCATION, PROPER IIEALTH CARE, ROADS,<br />
URBAN TRANSPORT, ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION, CITIES FIT TO<br />
LIVE IN. To NEGLECT THESE THINGS IS TO UNDERMINE'THE IRUE<br />
BASIS OF PROSPERITY, THE CONDITIONS THAT MAKE FOR GENUINE<br />
SOCIAL ORDER, GENUINE SECURITY, AND GENUINE FULFILMENT FOR<br />
EVERY CITIZEN, WHATEVER HIS PRIVATE MEANS, nUR AIM<br />
HAS BEEN TO WIDEN AND EQUALISE OPPORTUNITIES FOR AUSTRALIANS<br />
lil EVERY FIELD WHERE GOVERNMENT ACTION PLAYS A PART. So<br />
ALL rHi. YEAR WE HAVE PRESSED AHEAD WITH OUR GREAT PROGRAM<br />
OF SOCIAL REFORM AND INNOVATION, WE HAVE NEVER ABANDOt-<br />
THAT PROGRAM OR WATERED IT DOWN SUIT OUR OPPONENTS, j<br />
PEOPLE OF AUSTRALIA HAVE TWICE ENDORSED IT, THEY HAVE TWICE<br />
E[ VCTED US TO CARRY IT OUT, WE WILL GO AHEAD WITH IT. IT<br />
WILL , AKE TIME. IT WILL TAKE PATIENCE. AND 1, J THE FACE OF<br />
OBSTRU.-" P TACTICS AND DELAYS IT WILL TAKE DETERMINATION.<br />
BUT WE WILL 6L_ ON WITH THE JOB YOU ELECTED US .0 DOS </p>
<p>7. 1 HAVE PREPARED A LIST OF SOME OF OUR PRINCIPAL<br />
ACHIEVEMENTS IN 1974. I SHALL READ TO YOU THE HIGHLIGHTS<br />
AS MANY OF THEM AS YOU HAVE TIME TO HEAR. I HAVE BROUGHT<br />
COPIES OF THIS LIST AND YOU ARE WELCOME TO TAKE THEM<br />
AWAY TONIGHT. LATER THIS WEEK I SHALL BE TABLING IN<br />
THE PARLIAMENT AN EVEN LONGER AND MORE COMPREHENSIVE ACCOUNT<br />
OF OUR ACHIEVEMENTS, IT IS ON THIS RECORD THAT WE ASK TO BE<br />
JUDGED. ON THIS RECORD WE ARE PROUD TO BE JUDGED BY<br />
YOU, OUR SUPPORTERS, AND BY FUTURE GENERATIONS, A LABOR<br />
GOVERNMENT IS AN ACTIVE GOVERNMENT OR IT IS NOTHING, A<br />
LABOR GOVERNMENT IS A REFORMING GOVERNMENT OR'. lT IS NOTHING.<br />
8, THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A TIME WHEN LABOR NEEDED A GREATER<br />
UNITY, GREATER SOLIDARITY, GREATER EFFORT. THE BITTER<br />
DIVISIONS AND FRUSTRATIONS AMONG OUR OPPONENTS DO NOT ALLOW<br />
US TO iEL. OURGUARD. THE YEAR AHEAD WILL TEST OUR NERVE<br />
AND OUR SPIRIT AS NEVER BEFORE, WE WILL BE VULNERABLE TO<br />
PANIC TALK,. TO SCARE TACTICS, TO TF. HYSTERIA OF OUR<br />
OPPONENTS. WE WILL BE VULNERABLE TC A CERTAIN IMPATIENCE<br />
AND ,. EWILDERMENT AMONG OUR OWN SUPPORTERS. WE WIL. L WIN<br />
THROUuFH IF WE STICK TOGETHER, IN THE SHOf', T TE. Rii ( OU HAVE<br />
A GUARAITL-OF OUR DETERMINATION TO PROTECT THE WEAK, THE<br />
DISADVANTAGED AI'L,_ THE LOWER PAID AGAINST THE EFFECTS OF<br />
TEMPORARY ECONOMIC AND SOCi. HARDSH! P, IN THE LONG TERM<br />
YOU HAVE A GOVERNMENT PLEDGED TO RAISE OUR SOCIAL AND LIVING<br />
STANDARDS, WIDEN THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL OUR PEOPLE, AND<br />
BUILD A PROUD REPUTATION FOR AUSTRALIA AS ONE OF THE MOST<br />
JUST AND ENLIGHTENED SOCIETIES,<br />
