E. O. E. PROOF ONLY SPEECH BY PRIME MINISTER<br />
WARWICK COMMUNITY DINNER<br />
WARWICK 25 SEPTEMBER 1985<br />
Marianne Beddall, David Beddall, Stan Walsh and Members of<br />
the Queensland Parliament.<br />
Thank you very much for being here and may I say while I am<br />
talking about Members of Parliament from the other side of<br />
politics, I do appreciate you being here. I am also very<br />
pleased to be able to say that an ex-Federal Member of<br />
Parliament, again from the other side of the fence, Syd<br />
Barnes, who was the Minister for Territories and who I knew<br />
very well has sent his apologies and said he would very much<br />
like to have been here. And may I say in welcoming those<br />
distinguished guests, in particular, and you ladies and<br />
gentlemen, that one of the reasons I am so very pleased to be<br />
here with you tonight in Warwick is that I know that this is<br />
a very mixed audience and there is a great number of people<br />
here who have been loyal and steadfast members and supporters<br />
of my Party, the Labor Party. But there are also many here<br />
who are of the other side of politics. I thank you<br />
particularly for being here and I think it is a<br />
characteristic of our great Australian society, particularly<br />
of non-metropolitan Australia, that we can have a gathering<br />
such as this and I do thank you very much for all being here.<br />
Talking about people who have been active in politics, * I<br />
wonder if Andy Young said for those of you who have not been<br />
active and involved in the Labor Party, if I did, however,<br />
pay a particular tribute to two members of the Party who are<br />
here tonight who have given an enormous number of years and<br />
service, almost a hundred years of service between them to<br />
the Party. I refer to Eddie Moyle and Don Mulcahy. I thank<br />
them because all political parties in this country depend </p>
<p>upon loyal hard working members and I have had the<br />
opportunity of meeting both them. And on behalf of our great<br />
Party I do thank you for those years of service. And may I<br />
also in talking about individuals also say thank you to Phil<br />
Doyle for the pleasure of your company here Phil and to say<br />
how pleased we are that you have recovered from a very<br />
serious operation. It is your first night out. I don't know<br />
that your cardiologist would approve of the diet that you had<br />
tonight. You had a lot to eat but that also leads me, if I<br />
could, to say thank you to the ladies out there. I have seen<br />
a lot of big functions where there are hundreds of people<br />
present. Catering for such a big mob is very very difficult<br />
but I can honestly say I have never sat down in such a big<br />
gathering where the meal put in front of me seems as though<br />
it has been personally prepared. Thank you very much indeed.<br />
Now could I give those you who haven't yet heard a good piece<br />
of news. David Beddall has been on my back and on the back of<br />
the Government for a long time and properly on our back about<br />
the needs of this area of Warwick and he said that you really<br />
should have a TAFE here. So earlier this year we set aside<br />
half a million dollars for definition work and following that<br />
the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission has<br />
recommended to the Government that we should make a decision<br />
to go ahead with the TAFE College here. That hasn't yet gone<br />
to Cabinet but if you are Prime Minister and you can't make a<br />
couple of decisions yourself it's not worth being in the job.<br />
So I announce that when that recommendation comes to Cabinet<br />
it will be approved in 1986. There will be half a million<br />
dollars immediately in 1986 to commence the construction of<br />
your TAFE College and the whole amount of $ 6.8 million will<br />
be made available so that you will have your TAFE College in<br />
Warwick. Now I know, my friends, that here in the audience tonight<br />
there are people from a wide range of occupations. There are<br />
those of you who are employed in factories and there are<br />
those of you who work on your own farms. There are people who<br />
have retired. There are young people. You have different ways<br />
of earning your occupation but there is one thing which joins<br />
us all together. Whatever our occupation, whatever our<br />
occupation is going to be or whatever we have done now or in<br />
retirement and that is, I believe, the love of this country<br />
and the hope and the expectation that we are going to be<br />
able, as Australians, to develop the resources of our country<br />
in a way which will mean whatever our occupation we are going<br />
to be able to get fair go. We are gradually going to be able<br />
to have the opportunity of a better standard of living and as<br />
well as those of us who are in occupations that we will also<br />
as a nation properly be able to show compassion to those in<br />
our society who through no fault of their own, either because<br />
they are now elderly or they are disabled, or through reasons<br />
beyond their own fault are unemployed, we share, I believe, a<br />
commitment and a compassion that as we develop as a society </p>
<p>we will do the right thing by those who need the community as<br />
a whole.<br />
Therefore, if I can tonight, Ladies and Gentlemen, to talk<br />
with you about our shared aspirations and hopes. Because I<br />
know that it is a mixed audience, I will not attempt to make<br />
a stark part of this speech, although I know that you will<br />
understand that if I am talking about what I believe we have<br />
been able to achieve since I have had the great honour and<br />
responsibility of being Prime Minister of this country, I<br />
will be talking about our achievements. I will be talking,<br />
however, in terms which I hope all of you will be able to<br />
identify with. Not only in terms of what's happened in the<br />
recent past but I hope that you will be able to share with me<br />
my vision of what this great country is going to be.<br />
Let me talk, therefore, first a little bit about our recent<br />
history and what we have tried to do to bring this great<br />
country of ours which we all love up into the forefront of<br />
the nations of the world.<br />
It is the case and I don't want to go into the details of the<br />
past, but it was the case you know that when we came to<br />
office in the beginning of 1983 that our country was in poor<br />
shape. We had high rising unemployment, high inflation. It<br />
wasn't a country that was pulling together and working<br />
together. There was too much conflict in this country and I<br />
have had a great hope for many years before I got into the<br />
Parliament that we as Australians could do better.<br />
I looked at this country of ours and I saw a country which I<br />
believed almost any other country in the world would pleased<br />
to exchange places with. What country in the world could<br />
match Australia in terms of the resources we have got.<br />
Think about it. A vast country, a vast island continent with<br />
every imaginable resource that you can think of. Land itself,<br />
almost in a sense unlimited land, great resources of mineral<br />
wealth beneath our land, vast oceans around us filled with<br />
marine life and we have a people well trained, a people of<br />
whom the tactic and concept of terrorism is alien. A country<br />
within which the concepts of parliamentary democracy were<br />
well routed.<br />
Now you see if you think of that, very few countries in the<br />
world could match what we have. And it was a matter of great<br />
disappointment-to me as I looked at this country before I<br />
went into the Parliament and I had the responsibility of one<br />
our great institutions to work not only for the working men<br />
and women but to work with business and with governments. It<br />
was a matter of great regret to me that we didn't seem to<br />
have together been sensible enough to realise just how<br />
magnificent those resources were and what we could do with<br />
them. And so I made a pledge to the people of Australia when </p>
<p>I was given the honour of leading my Party in the beginning<br />
of 1983. I made a pledge to the people of Australia that we<br />
would try in government to bring the people of Australia<br />
together to try and see what we could do to end the conflict<br />
that we had experienced, the antagonisms that we had<br />
practiced one upon the other. And neither side in industry<br />
was blameless in that. And to see whether instead of being a<br />
country which had ceased to grow except in terms of growing<br />
unemployment and rising inflation, to see whether we couldn't<br />
together turn that around.<br />
And so you will recall as Australians through our great<br />
organisations we came together in April of 1983 for the<br />
Summit. And I asked you and Australians through your<br />
organisations to join with us in trying to turn the country<br />
around. I said then because I believe that to be true as I do now<br />
that no government, certainly my government, we don't have<br />
the monopoly of wisdom. I believe that we had good quality,<br />
good ideas but we certainly didn't know everything and so we<br />
asked you the people of Australia through your organisations<br />
to join with us, pool our ideas and then set about the task<br />
of reconciliation, reconstruction and recovery.<br />
On the occasion of that Summit we talked together and then we<br />
together went about our business. As a matter of pride to me<br />
to be able to come out into a place like Warwick in nonmetropolitan<br />
Australia where you have such a cross section of<br />
Australians. It is a great pleasure and a matter of pride to<br />
me to be able to come to you now after two and a half years<br />
and say to you that together, not just government, but to say<br />
that together as Australians we have done it.<br />
Let me, without burdening you with a great list of<br />
statistics, tell you what you have done. What we have done<br />
together. Where we had zero growth at the beginning of 1983<br />
we have now had two years of growth of 5% in GDP. We now<br />
enter our third year of 5% growth. That hadn't happened in<br />
any of the previous seven years but together we have done<br />
that and we are now doing that at a higher rate than any<br />
other country in the world. We have now created between us<br />
430,000 new jobs. The highest rate of job creation that was<br />
experienced in this country ever. The OECD came out yesterday<br />
and said that Australia is at the top of the world league.<br />
Our employment growth in 1985 and projected for 1986 is<br />
faster and better than anywhere else in the world. Now that's<br />
what we have done together.<br />
Where before we were spending so much time fighting one<br />
another industrially so often without fundamental reason we<br />
now have a situation where as Australians we are able to<br />
point to the fact that we have got the lowest level of<br />
industrial disputation in this country for 17 years. </p>
<p>We have got a level of inflation which is half what it was<br />
two and a half years ago. We are building more homes now than<br />
we have for a decade. And whatever way you look at it you and<br />
your fellow Australians working with government have produced<br />
an economy which is now not at the bottom of the heap, which<br />
is recognised in the rest of the world as the best performing<br />
economy in the western world. And we are entitled together to<br />
be proud of that.<br />
I want to also say to you that we don't regard, that is<br />
government doesn't regard and I don't think you regard<br />
economic growth, important as it is, as a total end in<br />
itself. What growth is about is to try and provide the means<br />
of happiness and satisfaction to the people in this country.<br />
Of course, those who are in jobs, those who were in jobs and<br />
now those who are in the extra 430,000 jobs that we have<br />
created, they are better off than they were.<br />
But we also recognise that we have got a responsibility to<br />
the less fortunate and therefore I think as a matter of pride<br />
to each one of you, to all of us as concerned and<br />
compassionate Australians, that in this last two and a half<br />
years as well as growing in the way we have and getting to<br />
the top of the world league of growth. At the same time as we<br />
have done that we have been able to give $ 1.5 billion to<br />
those in need in this community beyond that amount which we<br />
were bound to give under indexation. That is an additional<br />
billion so that those most in need have been able to<br />
benefit with us and we grow like that.<br />
Now while I talk in aggregates like that, those aggregates<br />
really break down into the happiness of individuals. Now it<br />
is the case obviously in a country like Australia that not<br />
every sector is going to be able to participate in that<br />
general economic well being.<br />
And I must, of course, in talking in an area like this talk<br />
about our rural economy because the fate, if you like, or<br />
welfare of the rural economy in terms of the incomes that<br />
they enjoy are not simply to determined by what happens<br />
within our Australian economy. Overwhelmingly, what happens<br />
in our rural economy, the health of o. ur rural economy is<br />
determined by the prices that are received by our rural<br />
producers on the international markets of this world. And the<br />
great tragedy for Australian rural producers today is that<br />
they amongst the most efficient highest productivity<br />
producers in the world are getting a raw deal because of the<br />
actions predominantly of the Europeans.<br />
The Europeans are pursuing a common agricultural policy which<br />
involves massive subsidies to relatively uneconomic<br />
producers. They are producing infinitely more than is<br />
necessary to feed their own people and with those great and </p>
<p>growing surpluses that are emerging under that subsidisation<br />
policy they are corrupting international markets. And the<br />
great sufferers are the efficient producers of the world.<br />
The Bureau of Agricultural Economics has just produced a<br />
massive study for us-* which has looked at the impact of the<br />
common agricultural policy of the Europeans and it shows that<br />
Australia over the last five years has been robbed of $ 1<br />
billion per annum as a result of the corruption of<br />
international markets by Europeans.<br />
Now we can't of ourselves change that but I want to say that<br />
I went to Brussels in February of this year. I went there and<br />
I spoke directly and in unqualified terms to the leaders of<br />
the European Commission and told them that what they were<br />
doing was wrong. But not only wrong in terms of what it was<br />
inflicting upon especially Australian producers, it was also<br />
wrong in terms of their own economy because the cost and<br />
price and wages structure of the countries of Europe have<br />
been pushed up because of these perverted policies that they<br />
are pursuing. The prices which their own people pay for rural<br />
products which go into their wages cost and price structure<br />
are much higher than they would be if the didn't have this<br />
policy. So I tried to tell that not only were they hurting us<br />
but they were also hurting themselves. And I hope that in<br />
continuing to put that message to them strongly there and<br />
when they visit us here that we will on behalf of our great<br />
rural industries start gradually to get some sense into the<br />
international marketing mechanisms of our country.<br />
We are pursuing, we of the countries of our region and with<br />
the major countries of the world, the proposal that there<br />
should be a new multilateral trade ground. And that that<br />
shouldn't just concern itself with manufactured goods but it<br />
should also concern itself with agricultural products because<br />
it is appropriate that there should be reasonable sanity in<br />
international marketing arrangements so that producers who<br />
are the most efficient in the world, which are ours, should<br />
not have their incomes corrupted in that way. And I give you<br />
the pledge that we will continue to do that because that is<br />
where the major problem is. We recognise that there are some<br />
things that we can do in the government and I am proud to say<br />
that in terms of the growth of cost faced by rural producers<br />
compared with the 12.6% annual average rate of cost increase<br />
that faced the rural sector in the seven years before we came<br />
to government, we have halved that so that the rate of<br />
increase in costs has come down from 12.5% to 6%.<br />
We have tried to more than just having a sensible economic<br />
policy which has reduced costs and reduced the rate of<br />
inflation. We have recognised that there are specific things<br />
that we should do and in this last Budget we have now given<br />
the complete rebate in regard to diesel fuel so that primary<br />
industry now is the only sector of Australian industry which </p>
<p>has that complete rebate and I believe they should have it<br />
because they deserve it. And as far as that section of rural<br />
industry is concerned which is concerned with grain<br />
harvesting, I think you will approve of the fact that we have<br />
now reduced or removed the tariff on grain harvesters and<br />
replaced that with a bounty which is of importance to you.<br />
That total package is worth in the order of $ 50 million and I<br />
give the pledge to the rural community that despite the fact<br />
that they have expressed in a rather dramatic way their<br />
unhappiness with their lot in the sense of rough things about<br />
us, I can understand that. If you have been hurt in the way<br />
that the rural sector is in these international markets, you<br />
are going to express your concern. I understand that. Despite<br />
that fact I give you the pledge that my government will<br />
continue to pursue economic policies within Australia that<br />
will maintain within measurable and containable bounds the<br />
rate of cost increases and do whatever we can in consultation<br />
with your organisations to do those things which are going to<br />
best meet your needs.<br />
As they say, ultimately the condition of rural Australia is<br />
going to be determined by getting good sense into the<br />
Europeans. And I can tell you it is pretty hard getting good<br />
sense into them. Just try the French, for instance, at the<br />
moment and see where you get.<br />
Now those are the things, my friends, that have happened. I<br />
believe that you will say with me, I would think in a sense<br />
whatever your political persuasion, I think we all know that<br />
Australia is a better country now as we come towards the end<br />
of 1985 than it was two and a half years ago.<br />
Not because simply we are in the top of the league in terms<br />
of economic performance but more fundamentally we are better<br />
as a country because we are working together better as a<br />
country and that is how we have got to the top of the league.<br />
Now it is not enough for us as a people, for me as Prime<br />
Minister heading a government, it is not enough simply to say<br />
well we have got over our immediate problems, we are on the<br />
road again. What we have got to be thinking about is our long<br />
term future. And what I would like to do in conclusion just<br />
for a few minutes is to share with you if I may my vision,<br />
the governments vision of the future of this country.<br />
We are not going to be able to shape the future of this<br />
country and create a country which will be a worthy<br />
inheritance for our children if we try and regard ourselves<br />
as an isolated country here by ourselves, putting a wall<br />
around Australia, some 16 million people and saying to the<br />
other 5 billion, it will be 6 billion by the end of this<br />
century, 6 billion plus as we go into the 21st century. We<br />
are not going to be able with 16 million people to say to 6 </p>
<p>billion we forget you, we put a wall around ourselves, we<br />
will look after ourselves. The world is not like that.<br />
If our children are going to inherit a country which will<br />
make the fullest possible use of these vast resources to<br />
which I have referred. We have to part of the world. And we<br />
are fortunate that physically we are placed in that part of<br />
the world of Asia and West Pacific which is growing faster<br />
than anywhere else. We have the great opportunity now of<br />
making a contribution to and benefitting from the growth of<br />
this part of the world. That is why in looking to this<br />
forward picture for Australia I have attached so much<br />
importance to developing the relations with the countries of<br />
this region and with no country has it been more important to<br />
develop those relations than with China.<br />
What is happening in China today is the single most important<br />
thing that is happening in the world. You have a country<br />
there which approximately a little under one quarter 20% of<br />
the worlds population. It is throwing off the shackles of the<br />
deadening Marxist-Leninist ideology which had confined its<br />
economic performance. It is stimulating enterprise in that<br />
country. It's standards of living are growing. It's opening<br />
its doors to the outside world and because of the<br />
relationship that I have been able to form with the<br />
leadership of China which has been built upon by my Ministers<br />
and by industry that has gone there and by representatives of<br />
our workers Australia now is in a position where it can say<br />
that it has a better relationship with China than any other<br />
country has in the world. And that means that we are opening<br />
up great markets, great opportunities for our rural<br />
producers, for our mineral producers, for our iron and steel<br />
industry, for the wool and textile industry, for our<br />
transport industry and we are going over the years ahead now<br />
with China to develop a relationship which will be of<br />
fundamental importance for the future welfare of our country.<br />
And we are doing that also with the other countries of the<br />
region, the other fast growing countries of the region so<br />
that we will have a relationships which will mean that we<br />
will be able to use our resources, not just dig up iron ore<br />
and coal out of the ground, not just send wool and wheat, as<br />
important as all those things will be. But we will be able to<br />
develop new industrial enterprises which in conjunction with<br />
our friends in China will mean we will be able to diversify,<br />
expand our economy in a way in which will create jobs.<br />
But the other thing that we must think about when we are<br />
thinking of this vision of the future what sort of country<br />
is it going to be for the children to whom we hand over this<br />
country? What sort of education and training are we going to<br />
give to our young people? And that's why in the only national<br />
address to the nation I have made so far since being in<br />
office has been about young people. And that was just before<br />
the Budget and I said we are going to make education and </p>
<p>training and the employment creation opportunities for the<br />
young our Priority One.<br />
Without going into all the details tonight because there<br />
isn't time. I simply want to say to you that on behalf, I<br />
know, of all the parents and the older people in this<br />
country, what we are doing is to create a situation where I<br />
believe by the end of this decade there will be no more<br />
unemployment amongst our 16 and 17 year olds. They will<br />
either be staying in the education system or going on to<br />
university for further technical training or they will be<br />
going into employment or they will be going into our new<br />
traineeship system. So our young people are going to have the<br />
full opportunity to develop and train the talent which each<br />
one of them has. Not each child is going to star academically<br />
in the early stages of education. They may never star in the<br />
education system but there is virtually no child in this<br />
country who hasn't got some talent or other which if given<br />
the opportunity can be developed to give that child the<br />
opportunity of developing into a person which is going to<br />
have the capacity for meaningful occupation and also the<br />
opportunity to make a bulk contribution to this country.<br />
So what we are doing in the field of education and training<br />
is to try and create into the future a workforce of educated<br />
and trained young people who are going to be able use and the<br />
develop the great natural resources we have and to be part of<br />
an outward looking Australia which is going to sell its<br />
products in these fast growing areas of the world with which<br />
we are developing these relations.<br />
So my friends, that is the sort of vision that I have and my<br />
government has and I believe that so many Australians, and I<br />
think the overwhelming majority of Australians, can share<br />
with us. So let me, if I can, in coming to Warwick give you,<br />
as it were, a progress report. Together, I think, we deserve<br />
good marks the people of Australia. We have been sensible,<br />
we have learnt that it's better to work together. If we work<br />
together we can all be winners.<br />
And the second thing I say in giving you that progress report<br />
is to say lets now that we have got the reconciliation, we<br />
have got the recovery, lets work on the reconstruction<br />
together because we have shown the rest of the world and<br />
ourselves that we can turn this economy around in a short<br />
time. Let's go on and prove not only to the rest of the world<br />
but to our young people in particular that we have<br />
discharged, as mature and sensible Australians, the vast<br />
obligation that is imposed upon us as being the inheritants<br />
of this country which has been handed on to us by our elderly<br />
citizens to take advantage of these great resources that are<br />
part of our inheritance.<br />
We have finished our parts as mature Australians, let us be </p>
<p>able to say that we have so worked, we have so co-operated<br />
that the young people of this country will go on into the<br />
21st century with a country which has an economic<br />
infrastructure, a quest to develop those resources, a quest<br />
to be part of this growing world and an Australia which will<br />
have the capacity to make a contribution to the rest of the<br />
world in terms of trying to make that a more peaceful world.<br />
Because ultimately all these things that we will have done<br />
together to turn our economy around, to develop our<br />
resources, to train our young people, ultimately all those<br />
things will have been in vain if we can't live in a world of<br />
peace.<br />
And that is why on your behalf, I and my government are<br />
trying at all the relevant international forums to work for<br />
meaningful disarmament. Not to say unilaterally that<br />
Australia will disarm because that doesn't make sense. We<br />
want both sides to disarm in a meaningful.....<br />
