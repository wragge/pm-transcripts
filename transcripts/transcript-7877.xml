TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCE, PARLIAMENT HOUSE,<br />
JANUARY 1990<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
PM: The Cabinet today considered a report from the<br />
Foreign Minister on developments in Eastern Europe. That<br />
report to, of course, a considerable extent was based on<br />
Gareth Evans' recent visit to two Germanys and to Poland,<br />
Hungary and Czechoslovakia. Out of that report the<br />
Government made a number of decisions which we regard as<br />
constituting at this stage an appropriate response to<br />
those important developments. Gareth Evans will be<br />
putting out a more detailed press release later on this<br />
afternoon. But I'll just refer to some of those<br />
decisions. We will establish an Australian program of<br />
training for Eastern Europe which we'll put at least<br />
That will be some contribution from Australia to meet<br />
what is now an obvious need. But after these something<br />
like two generations of a repressed command economy there<br />
of course has not been an emergence of the sorts of<br />
commercial and economic skills in those countries which<br />
are necessary to enable them to undertake the sort of<br />
market development that they intend to pursue now. It's<br />
been made clear that they would appreciate assistance in<br />
developing those skills. So Australia will adopt this<br />
program and it will involve having people from these<br />
countries coming to Australia to undertake studies in<br />
various areas of business management, environmental<br />
safety, agricultural technology, just to give those<br />
examples. And it would also entail some visits by<br />
experts in these areas to those countries. We also<br />
intend to upgrade our diplomatic representation in the<br />
region. We have embassies now as you know in Moscow,<br />
Warsaw, Budapest and in Belgrade and we intend now to<br />
establish an embassy in Czechoslovakia, in Prague.<br />
Czechoslovakia has a population of some 16 million people<br />
and with its background and traditions we believe it's an<br />
appropriate area to enhance our diplomatic<br />
representation. Austrade will also be keeping its<br />
Eastern European coverage under close review. We'll be<br />
encouraging an increasing range of high level and<br />
parliamentary visits to these countries. We'll be making<br />
a contribution to the stabilisation fund for Poland. It<br />
won't be a large contribution, a large one hasn't been<br />
requested. But it will be indicative of the commitment<br />
that we have and we'll follow on the announcements that I<br />
made in October of last year of our commitment to assist </p>
<p>in the redevelopment of Poland. So without being<br />
exhaustive, those are some of the decisions that we've<br />
taken. As I say, the Foreign Minister will be issuing a<br />
press release on these matters later on today. Alright.<br />
Any questions?<br />
JOURNALIST: When's the mission in Prague likely to open?<br />
PM: I'm not quite sure how long that will take but we'll<br />
process it as quickly as we can. Obviously it will be<br />
this year.<br />
JOURNALIST: What sort of cost would you be looking at?<br />
PM: I think the order of the cost all up will be<br />
something like $ 2.5M<br />
JOURNALIST: Have you considered Bucharest yet?<br />
PM: Not at this stage.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is the Government concerned about the trend<br />
it seems in Eastern Europe of the new governments not<br />
being fully established and particularly in Romania?<br />
PM: Sure. It's always been something that I think<br />
people should've taken into account, that you get the<br />
euphoria and the understandable proper euphoria of change<br />
but not always the understanding of the complex<br />
difficulties that they are in turning around, as I say, a<br />
couple of generations of the imposition of a repressive<br />
command economy, an absence of political freedoms. And<br />
then what has to happen is on two fronts on the<br />
economic and political front fundamental change. In<br />
other words you've got to have the processes emerging<br />
whereby you can have a free democratic election for<br />
parliament and to get those processes underway which will<br />
enable an election to be fairly and properly held is not<br />
easy. Of course in the economic area perhaps the<br />
difficulty is even more profound because you've had, as I<br />
say, two generations of a command economy in which the<br />
opportunities for initiative and decision making, a<br />
proper allocation of resources is entirely absent. And<br />
so it's always going to be the case that the euphoria was<br />
going to be followed by the question marks then as to how<br />
these issues are resolved. I think the important things<br />
are these. Firstly, that there is no doubt about the, in<br />
my judgement, irreversibility of the decisions that have<br />
been taken and the commitment of the peoples of these<br />
countries to pursue these courses in the political and<br />
economic field. And secondly of course, there is an<br />
overwhelming, large commitment on the part of the<br />
countries of the West to cooperate. I've been<br />
particularly pleased I might say, as I think you would've<br />
heard me say before, that in the case of the United<br />
States and the countries of Western Europe it hasn't been<br />
a case of gloating and saying well the system that we've<br />
always despised and said could not last, has crumbled. </p>
<p>I've rather taken the view that we all have the<br />
responsibilities now towards the people of these<br />
countries to do everything we can in a practical way<br />
in rhetoric but in a practical way to facilitate the<br />
processes of political and economic reconstruction. So<br />
I'm not surprised that the difficulties and tensions are<br />
emerging. It would've been remarkable if they hadn't.<br />
The important thing is that I think we have the basis for<br />
optimism for the future.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is this seen as a starting point built<br />
on further in recent years or is level likely to be<br />
maintained with economic assistance?<br />
PM: We have the commitment to act in concert with likeminded<br />
countries, I mean we didn't wait for others. The<br />
announcement I made I think on 15 October indicated our<br />
commitments then. Gareth attended the meeting of the G24<br />
at the end of last year and we will be cooperating fully<br />
with them. To the extent that there needs to be some<br />
perhaps change in emphasis in the things that are to be<br />
done in the light of developments that take place, we<br />
will accommodate to that. We, as I have said in answer<br />
to a previous question, share the commitment of the<br />
countries of the West to being practical and generous in<br />
our assistance and the forms that we've decided upon now<br />
are those that seem appropriate and are a practical<br />
response to specific requests that were put to us. If<br />
those requests change in some form we'll be receptive to<br />
it. JOURNALIST: Further east Mr Hawke, has there been any<br />
indication the difficulties facing the Soviet Union may<br />
cause Mr Rhyzkov to think again of his visit here?<br />
PM: Well I must honestly say that there's obviously some<br />
speculation as to whether the rapidity and gravity in a<br />
sense of some of the changes that are taking place may<br />
cause him to change his timetable visit to Australia.<br />
It has happened before. But we've had no indication to<br />
that effect. I certainly hope it doesn't happen. We<br />
would very, very much welcome a visit from Mr Rhyzkov for<br />
these reasons. Firstly, we have as you know, over a<br />
period of some time been taking practical steps to<br />
improve the relationship between our two countries. It's<br />
important for us, it's important for the Soviet Union and<br />
in our small way it's important that we make that<br />
contribution globally to the improvement of relationships<br />
of the Soviet Union with the rest of the world. Secondly<br />
of course, it will give us a remarkably direct<br />
opportunity to hear at first hand an assessment by Mr<br />
Rhyzkov of both the nature of the changes that are taking<br />
place and his assessment of the implications of those<br />
changes for the future, both for the Soviet Union and for<br />
the immediate region and globally. So we hope he's still<br />
coming and we expect that he is. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Just moving back to domestic issues Mr<br />
Hawke. The negotiations between the Government and the<br />
ACTU for the next wages system will take place soon. Do<br />
you see that as embodying significant steps towards an<br />
enterprise bargaining?<br />
PM: Let me preface my answer to that question Paul, by<br />
saying that of course you must understand that in the<br />
changes that have already taken place in the wages system<br />
there has already been quite a significant move. By<br />
definition, restructuring is not something that you<br />
undertake in negotiations about restructuring not<br />
something that can alone be undertaken at the sectoral<br />
level. They have been increasingly undertaken within<br />
individual enterprises and very successfully in many of<br />
them. So what we will see in this next stage is a<br />
further development of that. But I want to make this<br />
point clear. As far as the Government is concerned in<br />
the negotiations that we'll undertake with the ACTU,<br />
centrally important to that will be ensuring our capacity<br />
to predict and deliver on aggregate national wages<br />
outcomes so that we'll have the combination of the<br />
decisions by the Industrial Relations Commission which<br />
will make the decisions as to general minimum wage<br />
levels. And to the extent that the negotiations do take<br />
place as we would welcome in the individual enterprises,<br />
we will ensure that the mechanisms are in place, both in<br />
terms of relationships with the ACTU and the Commission,<br />
to be able to do as we've done in the past to formulate a<br />
national economic policy on the basis of predictable<br />
national wages aggregates outcomes.<br />
JOURNALIST: Does that mean Mr Hawke therefore that you<br />
wouldn't be too keen on the idea of removing the..<br />
claims provision...<br />
PM: Not in an unqualified way, no.<br />
JOURNALIST: inaudible<br />
PM: Well obviously you've got to understand that we're<br />
at the very, very early stages of negotiations in 1990<br />
for this next year. We will listen to what the ACTU has<br />
got to say. We'll also have discussions with the<br />
employers. We've got some, we'l11 have some ideas about.<br />
this. But our guiding criteria will be two really. One<br />
that I have stressed in the answers that I've already<br />
given, and that is that we have to be able to have a<br />
predictable figure for the national aggregate wages<br />
outcome. I'll have that criterion. But we'll also want<br />
to try and have processes which will enable the<br />
continuation of the flexibility which has already started<br />
to emerge under the restructuring process which has<br />
commenced. The experience to this point shows that it's<br />
possible to do both.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, are you upset that the cost of<br />
health care is rising and if so how does the Government </p>
<p>plan to fund that increase? And in that context do you<br />
endorse Dr Blewett's promise of no increase in the<br />
Medicare levy in the next term of Government if you win<br />
the election?<br />
PM: I endorse that and let me make it quite clear<br />
Laurie, that our future Medicare expenditures are there<br />
in the published forward estimates. Those expenditures<br />
grow according to the special formula, it's understood<br />
which takes account of relevant costs, hospital costs,<br />
and factors which could lead to a blowout. It also has<br />
in that special formula a provision for taking account of<br />
the ageing of the population. So those factors are<br />
there, they are published in the forward estimates and I<br />
would remind you that with those future Medicare outlays<br />
covered, we have outlays as a percentage of GDP falling<br />
steadily to 22% by 1992/ 93. So our position is clear,<br />
it's understood. I must say that that stands in very<br />
stark contrast to the position of the Opposition. I<br />
don't want to take a great deal of time I might say<br />
personally adding to the difficulties that are already<br />
apparent for the Opposition. But let me make this point,<br />
that it's been somewhat compounded even further today, I<br />
understand, by the fact that the Leader of the Opposition<br />
still doesn't seem to be quite sure how he wants to<br />
handle this. Because I understand in the text of a<br />
speech that he was to deliver today that he distributed,<br />
it included the passage this was distributed this<br />
morning and I quote " in any case I give you an ironclad<br />
guarantee that within the context of the reviews of<br />
the present health scheme and any associated changes in<br />
the taxation system, no individual or family will be<br />
worse off". When he came around to delivering the speech<br />
that was deleted. So we have a position as far as the<br />
Opposition is concerned that due to a combination of<br />
obviously incompetence and dishonesty, because they must<br />
have known at least as far back as October of last year<br />
that what they were saying couldn't be delivered. We now<br />
have a part exposure of their fiscal irresponsibility. I<br />
say a part exposure because let me make these points<br />
briefly. They have given the ambit of 0 to $ 2.6B as the<br />
shortfall that will have to be made up as a result of the<br />
loss of the levy. That of course doesn't take account of<br />
the incentive tax rebates for taking out private<br />
insurance. So it's someting there in the order of $ 2.6B<br />
for that. But you should understand too when you're<br />
looking now at the exposed fiscal incompetence of the<br />
Opposition that you have to add -to that $ 2.6B the<br />
undisputed figure of about $ 3B which was put out last<br />
year as the cost to the Coalition of funding the two tier<br />
tax scale. Because that was the calculation that was put<br />
out. It hasn't been disputed. the cost of creating<br />
the two tier tax scale on the basis that no-one would<br />
lose. You now have also in the last two days the<br />
emergence of the commitment of another half a billion<br />
dollars confirmed by their spokesman this morning in<br />
regard to roads. Who's their spokesman there? Mr Sharp.<br />
Mr Sharp has been having a little bit of difficulty </p>
<p>making up his mind about this one but I understand<br />
according to a transcript that was given to me just<br />
recently, he says that he has said that in the first year<br />
of a Coalition government they will undertake that<br />
funding increase in roads which he says is in the order<br />
of half a billion dollars. So if you bring it all<br />
together my friends, you'll see that you've got something<br />
of the order of $ 2.6B in the area of health. You've got<br />
$ 3B to deliver on the tax scale. And you've got half a<br />
billion dollars in roads. At least $ 6B. This great<br />
gaping, fiscal hole. So while the emphasis has been on<br />
the health area just in the last two or three days, it's<br />
only part of their problem.<br />
JOURNALIST: The question of your promise not to raise<br />
the levy. You made an identical promise in 1984 and<br />
then broke it. Why should people believe you now?<br />
PM: Well I think they've seen the way in which now, in<br />
the period since we've made the adjustments, the way it's<br />
worked in which we have in fact as I say been able to<br />
show in the forward estimates, the expenditures and the<br />
formula upon which it's worked. I believe that the<br />
people will have reason on the basis of experience to<br />
believe that we can and will deliver.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, will the Budget surplus remain at<br />
$ 9B over the next couple of years or will you fund tax<br />
cuts and any other spending increases out of a lower<br />
surplus? PM: The range of decisions that we will have to take<br />
will be based upon a continuation of the approach that<br />
we've had in the past and that is that we will be having<br />
a significant Budget surplus. Any decisions that we take<br />
in the near future in regard to additional programs we<br />
will be seeking to fund. We will be making detailed<br />
statements in the weeks ahead now between now and the<br />
election of precisely what additional programs we may<br />
have, how they'll be funded and what implications they<br />
will have for fiscal outcomes. The people will be left<br />
in no doubt as to the way in which we go about will<br />
be on our promises.<br />
JOURNALIST: Spending cuts or tax increases, Mr Hawke?<br />
PM: There won't be an enormous amount of room for<br />
savings. We've been there very substantially but there<br />
will be room for some savings. We'll indicate that at<br />
the appropriate time.<br />
JOURNALIST: Does that mean there'll be no overall<br />
economic statement Mr Hawke? And secondly, do you intend<br />
to make a Cabinet decision on your attitude to the<br />
Garnaut recommendations on tariffs before the election?<br />
PM: Economic statement? Well I really haven't got<br />
anything to add to what I've said before on that, </p>
<p>Michelle. If we regard it as appropriate to have a<br />
larger statement, we will. We'll obviously, out of the<br />
discussions that we'll have with the ACTU and the<br />
employers in the area of wages and the considerations<br />
that are involved in that, there'll be some statement<br />
which reflects the outcome of those discussions. Now we<br />
have a number of on-going reviews in place. Now it<br />
depends upon the assessment that we'll make at the time<br />
as to whether it's appropriate to bring those together<br />
into a larger economic statement and that's what I've<br />
said before I have nothing to add to that. As to the<br />
Garnaut Report, we announced earlier the processes that<br />
we've established and as be done of course through<br />
the Structural Adjustment Committee, to consider all the<br />
range of recommendations that Dr Ross Garnaut has made.<br />
The work is proceeding as decided by the Structural<br />
Adjustment Committee. Now as to the timetable for<br />
specifics of those inquiry processes and decisions, I<br />
can' t at this stage comment to whether on the<br />
particular one you mention that is what he had to say<br />
about tariffs it's being considered. Now what the<br />
timetable of decision on that will be, I'm not in a<br />
position to say.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is Parliament coming back for more than two<br />
weeks on February<br />
PM: I'm not sure at this stage, my dear friend. At<br />
least that's a subtle way of asking.<br />
JOURNALIST: How attractive do you find the idea of going<br />
into an election campaign promising increased petrol<br />
taxes to pay for the improved roads?<br />
PM: Well I would say this about that question. That<br />
part of the background of it is of course against the<br />
very massive campaign of misrepresentation that has taken<br />
place about the declining proportion of revenue that the<br />
Government gets from oil which is allocated to roads. If<br />
you look at the total take of the Government from oil<br />
which is in the components of excise not just excise<br />
which has been referred to you will see that in fact we<br />
have marginally in our period of office allocated more to<br />
roads as a proportion of that take than in the last year<br />
of the previous government. Now in those circumstances<br />
where it's clearly not the case that we have been<br />
niggardly in the allocation of that proportion, I think<br />
if you were to consider this question of an increased<br />
impost for the purpose of increased allocation of roads<br />
it would be seen in a different light than against the<br />
proposition that we have drastically cut our allocation<br />
to roads from the total take from oil.<br />
PM: Now, now I just, Laurie, I just put that background<br />
to say I think the reaction of people to this point has<br />
been on a misapprehension about the allocation of the<br />
Government's decision. Whether in fact we will make a<br />
decision to have such a further impost for the purpose of </p>
<p>additional allocation of roads is something to be<br />
considered. There's certainly been no decision taken<br />
about it.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you saying though that you think you<br />
could persuade them that a new tax in that area would be<br />
a good idea?<br />
PM: Well, what I'm saying is this, that I think it would<br />
be very difficult to persuade the Australian people that<br />
that would be appropriate. If it were the fact that this<br />
Government had significantly reduced from it's total<br />
revenue from oil, it's allocation to roads, that would be<br />
a very, very difficult thing to do and that is the<br />
background which is attempted to be established by a<br />
certain people who are running campaigns. What I'm<br />
saying is that when you look at the facts that is not so,<br />
that in fact we have marginally increased the allocation<br />
to roads from the total oil take compared with the last<br />
year of the other government. So, in that context it may<br />
be not so difficult if it were judged that it were<br />
appropriate to make more funds available for roads and to<br />
fund that, not just to do it out of surplus. It's not<br />
the same position, as some people are trying to<br />
represent, as a massive decline in the proportion of<br />
funds allocated to roads.<br />
JOURNALIST: Have you made your mind up yet Mr Hawke<br />
whether you'll debate Mr Peacock?<br />
PM: I beg your pardon?<br />
JOURNALIST: Have you made your mind up yet whether<br />
you'll debate Mr Peacock on television during the course<br />
of the campaign and when during the course of that<br />
campaign PM: That decision was made ages ago. I forget how long,<br />
ages. I mean, I<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: Well, if it's Mr Peacock who's leading them, yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: support of the invasion of Panama, Mr<br />
Hawke, but despite the fact that Vietnam have withdrawn<br />
their troops from Cambodia, the Australian Government<br />
still hasn't resumed aid to Vietnam, direct aid to<br />
Vietnam. PM: Well, I'm glad you said direct aid, because, as you<br />
appreciate that<br />
JOURNALIST: resume and if not, are we guilty of<br />
double standards?<br />
PM: No, we're not guilty of double standards obviously<br />
because, as I think you appreciate, Milton, because you </p>
<p>did qualify your question, there has been forms of<br />
assistance in other ways through non government<br />
organisations and multilaterally. Now quite clearly the<br />
question of direct resumption of direct aid to Vietnam is<br />
inextricably bound up with the delicate negotiations that<br />
are taking place now in regard to Cambodia and I don't<br />
believe on anyone's part there is any suggestion, in<br />
regard to Australia, that we are acting other than in an<br />
entirely appropriate and entirely constructive way in<br />
regard to the Indo China region. Indeed I'm very proud<br />
of the response, the virtually universal approbation that<br />
has been given to the Australian initiative and, as you<br />
will appreciate, while pursuing that initiative, we are<br />
also adding to it now, as Gareth Evans just announced<br />
very recently, by sending a team there to Cambodia so<br />
that, not only Australia, but the rest of the countries<br />
that are going to be involved in finding a resolution of<br />
that tragic situation there will be better informed about<br />
the practical difficulties and realities that we'll have<br />
to face up to if together we're going to pursue this<br />
concept of United Nations presence there in this period<br />
leading up to elections. So, Milton, I don't think there<br />
is any suggestion on anyone's part that we're acting<br />
other than in a totally constructive and principled<br />
fashion in regard to this region.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: Well, yes, but there is no expectation that we<br />
should inject into this complex situation the difficulty<br />
that may be created in some people's perception by the<br />
resumption of, and I don't think that as far as Vietnam<br />
is concerned itself, that they are pressing this point.<br />
They understand that we are engaged in the very delicate<br />
series of negotiations in which now Australia has assumed<br />
a, you know, a quite pivotal role. So there is really no<br />
expectation about this and there's no reason at all to<br />
run the risk of in any way prejudicing the capacity that<br />
we obviously have generated to get support from all the<br />
players in this complex situation by making a decision<br />
which no-one's really seeking.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, what specific initiatives do you<br />
expect out of your New Zealand trip?<br />
PM: It really will be an exchange of information. I<br />
don't know that there will be any specific initiatives,<br />
but I certainly want to hear directly from Mr Palmer the<br />
results of the fairly extensive review which you would<br />
understand they have undertaken of the South Pacific<br />
region and their relations in that region. Also be<br />
interested to hear how they feel their relations with the<br />
United States are developing. So we're also scheduled to<br />
have discussions in regard to the way the CER is<br />
developing, we're obviously rather pleased with the way<br />
that's going. Certainly one other area which I know that<br />
I know Mr Palmer wants to talk with me about are the<br />
developments in Bougainville because there is a </p>
<p>reasonably New Zealand presence there as well. So<br />
you'll see it will be essentially an exchange of views<br />
and a discussion about issues of importance to us in the<br />
region and in our bilateral relation. There is no<br />
specific decision that we are scheduled, scheduled to<br />
take. JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: Now I think there was one over here<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, when can people with 17 percent<br />
mortgage rates look forward to some home loan relief?<br />
Will it require a further easing of the monetary policy<br />
as the banks are suggesting?<br />
PM: I think that you will recall that the Treasurer in<br />
addressing this issue put it, and I certainly agree with<br />
-him, that this was a limited initial step follow<br />
that the decision in regard to mortgage rates would be a<br />
matter for the banks. It may be, as he said, that for<br />
different banks there would be different points because<br />
of the different composition of their books, but clearly<br />
the impression seems to be amongst the banking industry<br />
that they will require a further move. Now I'm not going<br />
to speculate on when that will be. All I can say is that<br />
there does seem to be a very general acceptance in the<br />
community and in the financial community, the banking<br />
sector, that a) the decision that we took was right, the<br />
timing was right and the conditions have now been created<br />
under which, within the not too distant furure there will<br />
be a reflection of this lowering regimen in the mortgage<br />
market, but I'm not going to speculate as to when that<br />
will be.<br />
JOURNALIST: I just want to follow up Glenn's question,<br />
Prime Minister<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: You're spending a lot more time at the<br />
Commonwealth Games than you are discussing Bougainville<br />
with Mr Palmer. What's your response to the cynics in<br />
talkback radio and elsewhere who've unkindly suggested<br />
you' re mainly going to Auckland to bathe in the reflected<br />
glory of our medal winners?<br />
PM: Yes well, you can't, you can't really win with those<br />
cynics and I don't really try to. The fact is that as<br />
well as the Commonwealth Games being on there, it is the<br />
150th celebration of the Waitangi Treaty. I have been<br />
asked, now going back more than a year, by the New<br />
Zealand Government to go over at this time to combine a<br />
visit which would recognise that celebration, as well as<br />
the Commonwealth Games, and to undertake discussions with<br />
them on a range of issues. Now the cynics will always be<br />
there, Laurie. If I allowed myself to be deflected by<br />
the cynics, you wouldn't do anything. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, the 50 defence force personnel who<br />
are going to Papua New Guinea, will any of them be on<br />
Bougainville and do we actually have any military<br />
PM: We've made it quite clear that our people are going<br />
up there, our military personnel who are going up there<br />
for training purposes will not be involved in<br />
Bougainville. JOURNALIST: We don't have any military personnel on<br />
Bougainville at the moment?<br />
PM: Not to my knowledge and it certainly has been, that<br />
has been the intention of the Government that there<br />
should not be.<br />
JOURNALIST: Will you be discussing Bougainville with Mr<br />
Namaliu at any time in the near future, Mr Hawke?<br />
PM: Well I've just had my Ministers and my senior<br />
Ministers up there who've had discussions with the Prime<br />
Minister there and with other ministers. I've been given<br />
a full report on those discussions. If I were to find it<br />
necessary in the light of any new developments to talk<br />
with Rabbie I would do so.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you envisage any circumstances in which<br />
Australian troops might be directly used on Bougainville?<br />
PM: Not in terms of the dispute between the Government<br />
of Papua New Guinea and the BRA. I've made that quite<br />
clear and I say that unequivocally. Australian troops<br />
are not going to be involved in an internal dispute<br />
within Papua New Guinea. That's proper from our point of<br />
view and obviously from Papua New Guinea's. I mean, let<br />
me make the point again and I'm certainly not saying it's<br />
the case with you, but there seems to be an almost<br />
unstated assumption in some areas when they talk about<br />
Papua New Guinea that, that Papua New Guinea is still a<br />
colony or that it isn't a fully sovereign independent<br />
country, so it's an area in which we have some right or<br />
opportunity to just to go in and act capriciously as in a<br />
non sovereign community. Papua New Guinea is a sovereign<br />
independent country and Australia will not be committing<br />
its troops into that country in terms of a resolution of<br />
some internal problem in that country. The only<br />
situation in which Australian-defence forces could be<br />
involved and would be involved is if we made the<br />
judgement that it was necessary for the purpose of<br />
evacuating and securing the safety of Australian<br />
citizens. In no other circumstance.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, will your Government ensure that<br />
foreigners can earn no more than 20 percent of our<br />
commercial networks as announced by Mr Willis? </p>
<p>PM Well, the Minister is examining this both in terms<br />
of intention of the legislation and in terms of what the<br />
present situation seems to have been. I mean, in other<br />
words, it seems clear from certain statements have<br />
been made by the Receiver for the Channel Seven group<br />
that more than 20 percent has in fact been involved. Now<br />
the Minister is looking at this matter and will be<br />
reporting to the Government in the near future on it.<br />
JOURNALIST: What would you see as the appropriate<br />
maximum level of foreign ownership?<br />
PM: Well, certainly a minority and I will want to I've<br />
just had a very brief discussion with the Minister and he<br />
has undertaken, he's said to me that he's examining this<br />
issue in some detail and will be reporting back. If<br />
there's some decision that needs to be taken to clarify<br />
this, well, then a decision will be made by the Cabinet<br />
at the appropriate time.<br />
JOURNALIST: The Thomastown by-election on Saturday Mr<br />
Hawke, are you expecting a very big swing against Labor?<br />
PM: I haven't been following it closely enough. I'd<br />
expect that a) you would get a normal by-election swing.<br />
You always get some. I guess there'd have to be some<br />
addition to that from some concern about the industrial<br />
relations position in regard to the trams down there.<br />
But I really haven't spent any time addressing what the<br />
magnitude of the swing may be. All I can say is that it<br />
clearly will be something that will be relevant to<br />
Victoria and despite what will no doubt be the frenetic<br />
attempts by some to beat it up as having some federal<br />
implications I will not lose any sleep about it.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, have the Opposition's<br />
problems over health policy tempted you to call an<br />
0election sooner rather than later?<br />
PM: No. No, I mean I think that, as I indicated in an<br />
answer I gave earlier, that it's indicative of their<br />
unfitness. As someone said recently, not only are they<br />
unfit to be in Government, they are unfit to be in<br />
Opposition. And the longer you give them y'know, the<br />
more they show their incompetence, as well as their<br />
dishonesty. Because I think everyone recognises that<br />
they were not telling the truth about this situation for<br />
a period of at least three months. Now the more time<br />
they have the more likely it is that I mean I'm not<br />
saying therefore that the election's going to be on May<br />
12 but I'm simply saying that there are at least as<br />
many arguments coming out of this for giving them longer<br />
to expose their inadequacies than just jumping onto what<br />
has been perhaps the most egregious example of their<br />
incompetence. JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, Mr Peacock says he is telling the<br />
truth about the fact that health costs will balloon in </p>
<p>13<br />
the 90s. Now do you acknowledge in any way that Medicare<br />
will eventually outdo its usefulness?<br />
PM: No, not in its concept it won't outlive its<br />
usefulness. We've shown in the period in Government that<br />
in terms of our own decisions and the sort of<br />
negotiations we're capable of having with the States that<br />
we have the capacity to make adjustments. And you look<br />
at the range of decisions that we've taken. Without<br />
being exhaustive about it decisions we made last year in<br />
regard to new hospital funding arrangements with the<br />
States and decisions that we've taken in regard to<br />
cutting back on the enormous explosion of income that was<br />
occuring in some specialist areas of doctors. We have<br />
shown a capacity to adjust and to the extent that that is<br />
necessary in the future we will. But the underlying<br />
principles will not change and those are simply these, as<br />
you know 1) universality and 2) equity. Those<br />
principles are neither negotiable nor, under us,<br />
changeable. JOURNALIST: you may actually have to spend more in<br />
the future than<br />
PM: Well I've simply said that, in answer to the<br />
question that Laurie put earlier, that our forward<br />
expenditures are there in the forward estimates. They<br />
are published. They are consistent, as I say, with the<br />
position. We're covering what will be required to be<br />
covered under the formula which takes account of<br />
increased costs in areas where there can be a blowout.<br />
Having taken account of those according to the formula we<br />
still have a position where outlays are going to be<br />
declining as a proportion of GDP down to 22% in 1992.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you think the behaviour of our athletes<br />
in Auckland has been an embarrassment at all?.<br />
PM: I think initially it was. I think it probably<br />
embarrassed them. But importantly, and to their great<br />
credit, I congratulate them and I'm sure Australians are<br />
proud of them. After that initial perhaps overexuberance<br />
in behaviour by a few, by a few I emphasise,<br />
they've got down to the serious business of competition<br />
and fair and effective competition and they have got the,<br />
I was going to say the runs on the board, they've got the<br />
medals on the board. That's certainly going to be a<br />
pleasure for me to congratulate them personally on behalf<br />
of the people of Australia in the next couple of days.<br />
ends </p>
