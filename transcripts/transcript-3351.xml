SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON.' WHITLAM4 Mop#$<br />
AT THE OPENING OF THE K. H. BOYKETT BUILDING OF THE CAULFIELD<br />
ILNSTITUT-E OF TECL GY MELBOURNE, FRIDAY, 16 AUGUST 1974<br />
FEW OCCASIONS ARE MORE CONGENIAL TO THE LEADER OF<br />
A GOVERNMENT THAN THE OPENING OF A BUILDING WHOSE PURPOSES<br />
REFLECT AND SYMBOLISE MANY OF THE GOVERNMENT'S CENTRAL<br />
POLICIES AND AMBITIONS. SO IT IS WITH THIS BUILDING AND<br />
THIS INSTITUTE. K. H. BOYKETT'S LONG AND DISTINGUISHED CAREER<br />
AS AN EDUCATOR, AS A BUSINESSMAN, AS AN ADVOCATE, AS A MEMBER<br />
OF THE COUNCIL OF THIS INSTITUTE FOR 16 YEARS, SAW CHANGES OF<br />
GREAT AND LASTING SIGNIFICANCE IN THE-PATTERN OF EDUCATION IN<br />
THIS STATE. HE WAS PRESIDENT OF YOUR COUNCIL WHEN THE<br />
CAULFIELD INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY BECAME AN AUTONOMOUS BODY<br />
AND HE DIED WHILE STILL A SERVING MEMBER OF THE COUNCIL$<br />
HE PARTICIPATED IN A PROCESS OF EVOLUTION AND REFORM WHICH<br />
CULMINATED IN THE ASSUMPTION LAST YEAR BY THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
GOVERNMENT OF FULL FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR TERTIARY<br />
EDUCATION. THIS IS THE FIRST SIGNIFICANT EXTENSION TO A<br />
TERTIARY INSTITUTION TO BE COMPLETED SINCE THAT CHANGE WAS MADE.<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT, I AM PROUD TO SAY, HAS CONTRIBUTED<br />
MORE THAN $ 2 MILLION FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF THIS BUILDING IN<br />
CO-OPERATION WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF VICTORIA. I AM DELIGHTED<br />
THAT IT SHOULD BEAR THE NAME OF SO DISTINGUISHED A SERVANT OF<br />
EDUCATION IN THIS STATES </p>
<p>IL<br />
IT IS EASY FOR THE COMMUNITY TO FORGET THE ESSENTIAL<br />
PART PLAYED BY COLLEGES OF ADVANCED EDUCATION AND INSTITUTES<br />
SUCH AS YOURS IN THE TOTAL EDUCATIONAL PROCESS. YOUR INSTITUTE,<br />
NOW MORE THAN HALF A CENTURY OLD, HAS A PARTICULARLY LONG<br />
AND IMPRESSIVE HISTORY. INDEED, THE LEADING COLLEGES AND<br />
INSTITUTES IN THIS COUNTRY HAVE A LONGER HISTORY THAN ALL BUT<br />
SIX OF THE AUSTRALIAN UNIVERSITIES. YOU HAVE A KEY ROLE IN<br />
TRAINING YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN IN TECHNICAL SKILLS AND DISCIPLINES,<br />
IN THE APPLIED SCIENCES AND INDEED IN THE HUMANITIES, IN A<br />
MANNER ESSENTIAL TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN ADVANCED AND<br />
PROSPEROUS SOCIETY SUCH AS OURS.<br />
IN ITS APPROACH TO EDUCATION, THE GOVERNMENT'S PURPOSE<br />
HAS BEEN TO STRESS THE CONTINUITY AND INTERDEPENDENCE OF ALL ITS<br />
ASPECTS. MANY PEOPLE HAVE THE IMPRESSION THAT THE GOVERNMENT'S<br />
GREAT AND LASTING REFORMS IN EDUCATION HAVE BEEN CONFINED TO<br />
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ALONE. THAT IS NOT SO. IT IS<br />
TRUE THAT OUR FIRST PRIORITY WAS IN THESE AREAS BECAUSE THESE<br />
WERE THE AREAS OF GREATEST NEED, OUR PLANS, HOWEVER, ARE<br />
DIRECTED ACROSS THE WHOLE SPECTRUM OF EDUCATION. WE REGARD<br />
ALL LEVELS AND SEGMENTS OF EDUCATION AS RELATED PARTS OF A CONTINI<br />
AND ALL-EMBRACING PROCESS OF INSTRUCTION AND ENGLIGHTENMENT. </p>
<p>-3-<br />
THE GREAT FAILURE OF OUR PREDECESSORS IF I MAY<br />
SAY SO WAS TO TREAT EDUCATION ON A PIECEMEAL BASIS, PATCHING<br />
UP DEFICIENCIES HERE AND THERE. WE LOST SIGHT OF THE NEEDS<br />
AND PURPOSES OF EDUCATION AS A WHOLE. WE PRODUCED MORE<br />
INEQUALITIES AND ANOMALIES THAN WE REMOVED. ONLY NOW ARE WE<br />
BEGINNING TO SEE THE NEEDS OF EDUCATION AS A WHOLE, AND TO<br />
RECOGNISE THAT THE ROLE AND FUNCTION OF INSTITUTES SUCH AS<br />
THIS ARE EVERY BIT AS IMPORTANT TO THE TOTAL CONCEPT AS SECONDARY<br />
SCHOOLS OR UNIVERSITIES.<br />
THIS HAS MEANT A CONSIDERABLE CHANGE IN MANY OF OUR<br />
ATTITUDES, AND NOT TO PUT TOO FINE A POINT ON IT, IN MANY OF<br />
OUR PREJUDICES. IT HAS ENABLED US, FOR EXAMPLE, TO FREE THE<br />
WHOLE DEBATE ON PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION FROM ITS FORMER<br />
SECTARIAN PREOCCUPATIONS. I BELIEVE THE COMMUNITY NOW ACCEPTS<br />
AS AN UNALTERABLE PROPOSITION THAT THE QUALITY AND EXTENT OF<br />
THE GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY TO OUR CHILDREN'S EDUCATION<br />
HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THEIR RELIGION. IT HAS ENABLED US TO<br />
APPROACH THE WHOLE QUESTION OF PRE-SCHOOL EDUCATION ON THE<br />
BASIS THAT PRE-SCHOOLING IS A RIGHT OF EVERY CHILD AND AN<br />
ESSENTIAL PART OF THE TOTAL EDUCATIONAL PROCESS. IT HAS ENABLED<br />
US TO INAUGURATE A NEW DEAL FOR TECHNICAL AND FURTHER EDUCATION,<br />
FREEING THIS AREA FROM ARTIFICIAL NOTIONS OF SNOBBERY AND<br />
CLASS DISTINCTION. IT HAS ENABLED US TO TREAT INSTITUTES OF<br />
TECHNOLOGY AND COLLEGES OF ADVANCED EDUCATION IN A NEW AND MORE<br />
ENLIGHTENED WAY RECOGNISING THEIR UNIQUE AND INDISPENSABLE<br />
PLACE IN THE EDUCATIONAL CONTINUUM, AND DISPELLING FOREVER<br />
THE IGNORANT AND DESTRUCTIVE IMPRESSION THAT THEY WERE POOR<br />
RELATIONS OF UNIVERSITIES. </p>
<p>I BELIEVE THE ESSENTIAL QUALITY OF A DYNAMIC AND<br />
DEMOCRATIC EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM IS DIVERSITY BUT A DIVERSITY<br />
OF EQUAL AND RELATED PARTS. EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT<br />
TO PARTICIPATE TO THE FULL IN THE TYPE OF EDUCATION THAT SUITS<br />
HIM BEST, EQUAL OPPORTUNITY IN EDUCATION DOES NOT MEAN THAT<br />
EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE THE SAME EDUCATION OR, JUST AS IMPORTANT,<br />
THAT EVERYONE SHOULD WANI THE SAME EDUCATION. ONE OF OUR<br />
MISTAKES HAS BEEN TO PLACE TOO HIGH A SOCIAL PREMIUM ON CERTAIN<br />
KINDS OF EDUCATION AT THE EXPENSE OF THE COMMUNITY'S NEEDS.<br />
EQUAL OPPORTUNITY MEANS THAT THE SAME STANDARDS OF EXCELLENCE,<br />
OF DEDICATION, OF MATERIAL ENDOWMENT, OF TEACHING SKILLS<br />
SHOULD APPLY IN WHATEVER INSTITUTION AN INDIVIDUAL CHOOSES.<br />
OF COURSE PEOPLE SHOULD BE FREE TO CHOOSE THE KIND OF<br />
EDUCATION THEY WANT, BUT THIS CHOICE MUST BE ONE BETWEEN<br />
SYSTEMS AND COURSES; NOT BETWEEN STANDARDS, NOT BETWEEN A<br />
GOOD EDUCATION AND A BAD ONE, AN EXPENSIVE EDUCATION OR A<br />
POOR ONE, A SOCIALLY ESTEEMED EDUCATION OR ONE THAT IS SOCIALLY<br />
DOWNGRADED. THE PURPOSE OF MY GOVERNMENT'S REFORMS HAS BEEN<br />
TO ENTRENCH THIS GENUINE PRINCIPLE OF EQUAL OPPORTUNITY, NOT<br />
IN A NARROW FINANCIAL SENSE, BUT AS A BROAD PHILOSOPHICAL<br />
PRINCIPLE BINDING ON US AND ON ALL FUTURE GOVERNMENTS. </p>
<p>YOUR INSTITUTE REFLECTS THE GOVERNMENT'S CONCERN<br />
THAT EDUCATION SHOULD SERVE, OR AT LEAST RECOGNISE, THE<br />
OVERALL NEEDS OF SOCIETY FOR TRAINING AND SKILLS. NOT ONLY<br />
DO WE REGARD THE DIFFERENT LEVELS AND SEGMENTS OF EDUCATION<br />
AS. PART OF A SINGLE PROCESSS: MORE THAN ANY OTHER GOVERNMENT*<br />
WE ARE ANXIOUS THAT EDUCATION ITSELF SHOULD BE INTEGRAL TO A<br />
TOTAL CONCEPT OF SOCIAL GOALS AND PRIORITIES, As YOUR FIRST<br />
ANNUAL REPORT STATED:<br />
" CI. T. IS DESIGNING ITS FUTURE TO MEET THE DEMANDS<br />
OF A FAST CHANGING TECHNOLOGY, PROVIDING STUDENTS<br />
WITH THE PERSONAL REQUIREMENTS AND THE NECESSARY<br />
SKILLS TO MEET THE NEEDS OF EMPLOYERS, AND KEEPING<br />
CLOSE CONTACT WITH INDUSTRY THROUGH FULL-TIME, PARTTIME<br />
AND SHORT COURSES,"<br />
THAT IS ONLY ONE OF YOUR FUNCTIONS, BUT IT EXEMPLIFIES THE<br />
SENSE OF SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY WHICH MUST GOVERN THE CHOICE<br />
OF COURSES AND PROGRAMS IN INSTITUTES OF THIS. KIND,<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT TODAY IS MORE DEEPLY INVOLVED<br />
IN TERTIARY EDUCATION THAN ANY PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT, FROM THE<br />
BEGINNING OF THIS YEAR WE HAVE ASSUMED TOTAL FUNDING<br />
RESPONSIBILITIES FOR TERTIARY EDUCATION, TUITION AND RELATED<br />
FEES IN COLLEGES OF ADVANCED EDUCATION AND OTHER INSTITUTIONS<br />
OF TERTIARY AND POST-SECONDARY EDUCATION HAVE BEEN ABOLISHED, </p>
<p>-6-<br />
APART FROM FUNDING, THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT IS<br />
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CO-ORDINATION AND BALANCED DEVELOPMENT<br />
OF ADVANCED EDUCATION FACILITIES THROUGHOUT AUSTRALIA,<br />
To THIS END IT LOOKS FOR ADVICE TO THE COMMISSION ON ADVANCED<br />
EDUCATION, THE COMMISSION IS NOW CONSIDERING SUBMISSIONS<br />
FROM ALL COLLEGES FOR DEVELOPMENT AND FUNDING DURING THE<br />
1976-78 TRIENNIUM, AS A RESULT OF THE GOVERNMENT'S ACCEPTANCE<br />
OF THE COMMISSION'S REPORT ON TEACHER EDUCATION, FORMER STATE<br />
TEACHERSI COLLEGES AND PRE-SCHOOL TEACHERSI COLLEGES ARE NOW<br />
ALSO BEING FUNDED UNDER ADVANCED EDUCATION ARRANGEMENTS,<br />
THE GOVERNMENT'S TOTAL FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTION TO ADVANCED<br />
EDUCATION IN THE 1973-75 TRIENNIUM IS MORE THAN $ 600 MILLION,<br />
THIS IS A LARGE SUM BUT IT IS ONLY PART OF OUR<br />
COMMITMENT TO EDUCATION AS A WHOLE. SOME INDICATION OF THE<br />
SCALE OF THE GOVERNMENT'S ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES TO EDUCATION<br />
GENERALLY CAN BE OBTAINED FROM THE COMPARATIVE ANNUAL FIGURES<br />
FOR EXPENDITURE. IN 1972-73 THE TOTAL* AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT<br />
OUTLAY ON EDUCATION AT ALL LEVELS WAS $ 439 MILLION. IN 1973-74<br />
( THE FIRST FULL FINANCIAL YEAR OF THE PRESENT GOVERNMENT) WE<br />
SPENT NEARLY TWICE THAT AMOUNT OVER $ 800 MILLION DESPITE<br />
THE FACT THAT OUR MAJOR NEW PROGRAMS OF FINANCE FOR EDUCATION<br />
WERE NOT OPERATING FOR MORE THAN THE FINAL SIX MONTHS OF THAT<br />
YEAR, NOT UNTIL NEXT YEAR 1974-75 WILL WE SEE ANYTHING<br />
LIKE THE FULL IMPACT OF THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAMS, ( EVEN SO<br />
IT WILL NOT REFLECT THE FULL IMPACT OF NEW PROGRAMS IN THE<br />
PRE-SCHOOLS AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION AREAS), WHILE THE PRECISE<br />
FIGURE OF EXPENDITURE FOR 1974/ 75 IS NOT AS YET KNOWN, IT IS<br />
CLEAR THAT IT WILL BE MORE THAN THREE TIMES THE TOTAL LEVEL OF<br />
EXPENDITURE IN 1972-73, </p>
<p>THE MAJOR ELEMENTS IN THESE MASSIVE INCREASES IN<br />
OUR COMMITMENT TO EDUCATION HAVE OF COURSE BEEN THE<br />
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE KARMEL REPORT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR<br />
SCHOOLS AND OUR ASSUMPTION OF FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCING<br />
TERTIARY EDUCATION. THE EXPENDITURE FIGURES, HOWEVER IMPRESSIVE<br />
AS THEY ARE DO NOT SHOW THE FULL PICTURE. WE ARE CONCERNED<br />
NOT JUST WITH QUANTITY BUT WITH QUALITY. So OUR NEW PROGRAMS<br />
HAVE REFLECTED CONCERN FOR THE NEEDS OF THE INDIVIDUAL<br />
PARTICULARLY THE HANDICAPPED AND OTHER DISADVANTAGED STUDENTS,<br />
AND WITH-THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF INNOVATION.<br />
THIS EMPHASIS ON INNOVATION WILL BE PARTICULARLY MARKED<br />
IN THE AREA OF TECHNICAL AND FURTHER EDUCATION, THE REPORT OF<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN COMMITTEE ON TECHNICAL AND FURTHER EDUCATION<br />
THE KANGAN REPORT WAS TABLED BY THE MINISTER FOR EDUCATION IN<br />
APRIL. IT RECOMMENDED CAPITAL AND RECURRENT GRANTS TO THIS AREA<br />
OF MORE THAN $ 104 MILLION, THE GOVERNMENT PROMPTLY ACCEPTED THE<br />
VALIDITY OF ITS BROAD PROPOSALS, AND BUT FOR THE DOUBLE<br />
DISSOLUTION, THESE PROGRAMS WOULD NOW BE WELL UNDER WAY, </p>
<p>-8-<br />
I HAVE STRESSED THE IMPORTANCE WHICH MY GOVERNMENT<br />
PLACES ON LINKING TOGETHER OUR VARIOUS INITIATIVES IN A<br />
CO-ORDINATED AND INTEGRATED FASHION. WHAT THE KANGAN REPORT<br />
SAYS ABOUT THE CONCEPT OF RECURRENT EDUCATION AND OPENING UP<br />
THE ACCESS GENERALLY OF ADULTS TO EDUCATION IS REFLECTED<br />
ALSO IN THE PROPOSALS RECENTLY PUT FORWARD INTHE DRAFT<br />
REPORT ON OPEN TERTIARY EDUCATION, WHICH HAS BEEN PRODUCED<br />
BY A COMMITTEE OF THE UNIVERSITIES COMMISSION.<br />
SIMILARLY, THERE IS A CLOSE LINK BETWEEN THE KANGAN'REPORT<br />
ON TECHNICAL AND FURTHER EDUCATION AND THE COCHRANE REPORT<br />
ON LABOR MARKET TRAINING WHICH WE RECEIVED LAST MONTH, THE<br />
COCHRANE REPORT OUTLINES PROPOSALS FOR A NATIONAL EMPLOYMENT<br />
AND TRAINING SCHEME WHICH THE GOVERNMENT HAS DECIDED IN<br />
PRINCIPLE TO ADOPT, IT CAN BE EXPECTED TO HAVE AN IMPACT<br />
UPON THE FACILITIES REQUIRED IN TECHNICAL COLLEGES THROUGHOUT<br />
THE COUNTRY, AND THE KANGAN REPORT IS OF OBVIOUS IMPORTANCE<br />
IN RECOMMENDING ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR THOSE COLLEGES,<br />
THE TWO GO TOGETHER, ONCE AGAIN WE SEE THE IMPORTANCE OF A<br />
CO-ORDINATED AND PLANNED APPROACH TO EDUCATION AS A WHOLE, </p>
<p>-9-<br />
WE SEE. OUR NATIONAL EMPLOYMENT AND TRAINING SCHEME<br />
AS A MAJOR COMPONENT OF A MANPOWER POLICY AIMED AT IMPROVING<br />
THE ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND EDUCATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES OF ALL<br />
MEMBERS OF THE WORKFORCE. IT WILL BE NO MERE SHORT-TERM<br />
PALEIATIVE FOR UNEMPLOYMENT. IT WILL BE COMPREHENSIVE AND<br />
FLEXIBLE; IT WILL COVER A WIDE RANGE OF SKILLS; IT WILL<br />
RESPOND TO CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY AND THE NEEDS OF MODERN<br />
INDUSTRY. CLEARLY ITS SUCCESS WILL DEPEND ON CO-OPERATION<br />
WITH IMPORTANT COLLEGES AND INSTITUTES OF TECHNOLOGY SUCH AS<br />
YOURS, LET ME QUOTE SOME REMARKS MY COLLEAGUE MR. BEAZLEY<br />
MADE LAST YEAR TO THE FIRST MEETING OF THE KANGAN COMMITTEE,<br />
THEY INDICATE OUR BROAD APPROACH TO EDUCATION AND ARE RELEVANT<br />
TO THE WIDER PURPOSES OF THIS INSTITUTE MR. BEAZLEY SAID:<br />
" WE ARE NOW IMPLEMENTING A POLICY INVOLVING EXPERT<br />
COMMISSIONS CHARGED WITH THE TASK OF EXAMINING THE<br />
NEEDS OF ALL AUSTRALIAN STUDENTS, THE PRE-SCHOOLS<br />
COMMITTEE IS INVESTIGATING THE DEMAND FOR KINDERGARTENS,<br />
THEIR PLACEMENT AND REQUIREMENTS, WITH THE AIM OF<br />
PROVIDING FACILITIES OF CANBERRA STANDARD TO ALL<br />
AUSTRALIAN PRE-SCHOOLS WITHIN SIX YEARS; THE INTERIM<br />
SCHOOLS COMMITTEE IS WORKING TO DESTROY THE INEQUALITIES<br />
WHICH HAVE PLAGUED AUSTRALIAN EDUCATION FOR TOO LONG<br />
BY ENSURING THAT FEDERAL MONEY GOES FIRST TO THE AREAS<br />
WHERE IT IS NEEDED MOST,,, </p>
<p>" I HOPE THAT YOU WILL DEVELOP FOR AUSTRALIA NOT MERELY<br />
A STRATEGY OF TECHNICAL AND FURTHER EDUCATION, REACTING<br />
TO THE STATES' NEEDS, YOUR GREATEST SERVICE MAY WELL<br />
BE PREVENTING WASTE OF SKILL, WASTE OF MANPOWER, WASTE<br />
OF EFFORT AND FRUSTRATION, BY DEVELOPING A PHILOSOPHY<br />
OF TECHNICAL AND FURTHER EDUCATION, THIS WILL EMBRACE'<br />
PROPER RESPECT FOR CRAFTSMANSHIP, A HAPPY USE OF LEISURE,<br />
AND EFFECTIVE LIVING FOR MANY PEOPLE,"<br />
IT GIVES ME THE GREATEST SATISFACTION THAT VICTORIA'S<br />
INSTITUTES OF TECHNOLOGYI LONG REGARDED AS THE POOR RELATIONS<br />
OF THE TERTIARY SECTOR, ARE NOW EMBARKED ON A COURSE OF-STEADY<br />
GROWTH AND EHANCED PRESTIGE, I BELIEVE YOUR PROPER AND<br />
RIGHTFUL PLACE IN THE HIERARCHY OF THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM HAS<br />
AT LAST BEEN RECOGNISED BY ALL BY GOVERNMENTS AND BY THE<br />
COMMUNITY. A BRIGHT FUTURE LIES BEFORE YOU. </p>
<p>-11-<br />
THIS IS A TIME, AS YOU KNOW, WHEN HEAVY AND<br />
COMPETING CLAIMS ARE MADE ON THE GOVERNMENT'S RESOURCES,<br />
FOR MANY OF US FOR ALL OF US IT IS A TIME OF NECESSARY<br />
FINANCIAL STRINGENCY, I GIVE YOUMY ASSURANCE, HOWEVER,<br />
THAT THE PRIORITY WE ACCORD TO EDUCATION WILL REMAIN AS<br />
HIGH AS BEFORE, FROM THE BEGINNING WE HAVE RECOGNISED<br />
EDUCATION AS A PARAMOUNT RESPONSIBILITY OF THE NATIONAL<br />
GOVERNMENT AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO, THERE WILL BE<br />
NO RETREAT FROM THAT GOAL, THERE WILL BE NO SLACKENING<br />
IN OUR EFFORTS TO REBUILD OUR EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM AND GIVE<br />
THE BEST AND THE BRIGHTEST EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY TO EVERY<br />
AUSTRALIAN CHILD AND TO EVERY AUSTRALIAN STUDENT WHATEVER<br />
HIS MEANS, WHEREVER HE LIVES OR WHATEVER HIS GOAL IN LIFE, </p>
