    <content><![CDATA[<p>Lady Florence Bjelke-Petersen’s legacy as wife, mother, Australian Senator and passionate Queenslander will be remembered and honoured at a State Funeral.</p>
<p>For over a decade, Lady Flo distinguished herself as a passionate advocate for her beloved state of Queensland in the Australian Senate.</p>
<p>Lady Flo gave a strong voice to rural women across the country. She dedicated her life to improving the lives of regional Queenslanders.</p>
<p>But above all Lady Flo was much loved by all her family and our thoughts are with the Bjelke-Petersen family at this time.</p>
<p>Our offer of a State Funeral has been accepted by Lady Flo’s family. It will be held in her home town at the Kingaroy Town Hall at 1:00pm on Thursday 4 January 2018.</p>
