7: 30 REPORT WITH PAUL LYNEHAN, MAY 11 1992<br />
E QE PROOF COPY<br />
PL: Prime Minister, thanks for joining us again. The blow<br />
out in the budget deficit, if a Coalition government<br />
had done this you'd be screaming for their blood<br />
wouldn't you?<br />
Pm: No, the blow out is not because of an expenditure blow<br />
out, it is because receipts have fallen and the<br />
receipts have fallen largely because of our success on<br />
inflation, lower interest payments in the economy and<br />
also because certain categories of provisional tax<br />
payers are assessing themselves with lower returns.<br />
PL: But how come this has only emerged over the lost ten<br />
weeks?<br />
PM; Because this is within the time frame that the<br />
Australian Tax office can make a judgement about<br />
receipts at this time of the budgetary cycle.<br />
PL: And we're not entitled to wonder if your forecasters<br />
are really worth feeding with this sort of performance?<br />
Pm: well it's always better to have the forecasts on<br />
receipts obviously right than not right.<br />
PL: This is very wrong with respect.<br />
PM: It's a two billion extra financing task, but part of<br />
the reason is the better than expected inflation<br />
performance. The low inflation which is, of course, an<br />
enormous bull point for Australia.<br />
PL: And surely the low economic activity.<br />
PM: Yes, but hang on, but breaking that inflationary cycle<br />
of 20 years, one of the first impacts of that, even<br />
though its a beneficial force, one of the first impacts<br />
is actually on receipts In the budget.<br />

PL; Peter Reith says higher interest rates are just around<br />
the corner.<br />
PM: Just when the lowest interest rates in 20 years just<br />
came around the corner last Thursday. on these things<br />
Dr Hewson and Mr Reith are the doom sayers, they're<br />
both saying today interest rates are rising they are<br />
at their lowest level in 20 years. Last week we took<br />
interest rates down to 6 and 1/ 2 per cent.<br />
PL; Yes, but what goes down goes UP.<br />
PM: But it's not going to go up because of this. It's a<br />
two billion extra financing on the Commonwealth's debt.<br />
The Commonwealth's debt is one of the lowest of the<br />
developed countries its 16 per cent of GDP.<br />
PL: But what else In ' One Nation' should we now have a<br />
second look at. What other forecasts there were dodgy?<br />
PM: This is the Budget. It's not to do with ' one Nation'.<br />
PL: But you told us in ' One Nation' you said 6.8 billion<br />
deficit.<br />
PM: That's a forecast for the budgetary outcome. ' One<br />
Nation' is a package of measures to re-start the<br />
economy and today we had a Heads of Government meeting,<br />
a most successful meeting of the Commonwealth and the<br />
States for the implementation of the ' One Nation'<br />
measures and there was more decisions taken at that<br />
meeting, from that package of measures than one used to<br />
see under Coalition governments, more progress there<br />
than you'd see in 10 years of normal progress around<br />
Canberra from Coalition governments. Such things as<br />
adopting the elements of an electricity grid,<br />
separating power generation from distribution a<br />
milestone change, a milestone acceptance by States<br />
establishing a new Council of Australian Governments<br />
today.<br />
PL: HOW Will that work, this council of Australian<br />
Governments?<br />
PM; It will mean that instead of just the Financial<br />
Premiers Conference every June, the Premiers Conference<br />
and Loan Council, we've now got another body to discuss<br />
national agenda issues such as electricity, such as<br />
Technical and Further Education.<br />
PL: And railways and roads?<br />
PM: Yes, railways and roads that's right.<br />
PL: Getting back to your budget problem, you haven't got<br />
much room to manoeuvre in August have you, or indeed at<br />
any time between now and the next election you're </p>
<p>EL: 12. May. 92 17: 24 No. 025 P. 03/ 06'<br />
3<br />
locked in as tight 8s a drum aren't you? Politically<br />
locked in too.<br />
PM: The budget deficit is larger than we forecast but it<br />
will still come in under 3 per cent of GDP.<br />
PL; But you've given away the opportunity for any more<br />
goodies haven't you?<br />
PM; Well we're not intending to be in the goody business.<br />
The ' One Nation' statement was about rebuilding the<br />
rail network, getting the roads program moving again<br />
and the progress reports we are getting from Premiers<br />
today on that package is very, very satisfactory.<br />
PL: Given the fact that your receipts of tax are down so<br />
much now, given the fact that the first instalment of<br />
those tax cuts you've promised if you win the next<br />
election will be coming in in July 1994, can we still<br />
afford those?<br />
PM: Absolutely. I had the pleasure of presiding over 6<br />
marks of the Accord and under 4 of those we provided<br />
tax cuts and they were always provided on time as we<br />
said and they will be again. I know Dr Hewson is<br />
running around saying oh now this is a11 of f, take no<br />
notice of him, he's now trying to grab at straws. It's<br />
been a good news couple of weeks, low inflation, low<br />
interest rates, the good news is nearly suffocating<br />
him, it's more than he can stand.<br />
PL; When do you think there will be a submission before<br />
Cabinet on the flag, what's the timing of that at the<br />
moment?<br />
PM:. The issues I'm on at the moment are jobs and the<br />
economy and growth and this meeting of Heads of<br />
Government today is about driving home all of those<br />
' one Nation' packages and including Technical and<br />
Further Education, we're determined that kids are not<br />
going to come cascading out of secondary education,<br />
those that can't get into university cascading into<br />
milkbars and to railways stations and to shopping mall<br />
plazas, we want them taken up in vocational education<br />
and we're moving today to create those things and it is<br />
to those things I've got the principal focus not the<br />
matter you Just mentioned the flag or similar<br />
matters.<br />
PL., Have you been told you'd be wise to play that one on<br />
the back burner for a while? You clearly don't want to<br />
talk about it tonight.<br />
PM; No, but At's not on the top of my priorities, I'm<br />
entitled to say to you, I've just come within an hour<br />
from one of the most successful meetings of Premiers<br />
and the Commonwealth I think I've attended.<br />

PL: But we haven't had a chance to speak to you for a few<br />
weeks, there's been a few things bubbling around. You<br />
said about the flag that you would take very much into<br />
account the will of the people.<br />
PM; Yes.<br />
PL: 81 per cent of the people in one poll I saw recently<br />
said they want a referendum on this.<br />
PM: That could be true and they may well get one.<br />
PL; may well get one?<br />
PM: Yes, but we'll have Cabinet consider the matter in due<br />
course. Again, issues are ranked. we have the happy<br />
knack, I hope, of ranking issues appropriately and the<br />
big ranking for us at the moment is getting the economy<br />
going. We are In a recovery now, consolidating that<br />
recovery, pushing those low interest rates through and<br />
getting all these ' one Nation' things into place.<br />
PL: On the design, do you favour the idea, just personally,<br />
of throwing it open to a national competition or<br />
commissioning a group of designers to it?<br />
PM: Paul, it is just not worth my while to discuss those<br />
issues with you. That's something that the Cabinet<br />
will have to consider. But, again, I can't tell the<br />
media its priorities, but I will just remind you an<br />
hour ago I was attending one of the most successful<br />
meetings of the Commonwealth and the States we've<br />
probably ever held.<br />
PL: And a few days ago you were advised to play down the<br />
flag issue a bit.<br />
PM: You're sort of waving the flag and asking what the<br />
designs are it's a very interesting subject and an<br />
important one about how we represent ourselves but<br />
there are other important things too.<br />
PL; Let's try another important issue. Have you spoken to<br />
Graham Richardson recently to try to ensure that there<br />
is no more embarrassing revelations in store for the<br />
Governm~ ents?<br />
PM: I spoke to him over the weekend, yes.<br />
PL: Are you happy?<br />
PM; Yes and from what he has told me it is as I said to the<br />
Parliament a relative of his had difficulty, he<br />
intervened to see whether this person could come back<br />
to Australia to prepare their defence -it's as simple<br />
as that. TEL </p>
<p>TEL: 12. May. 92 17: 24 No. 025 P. 05/ 06<br />
PL: Now I know he has not been well, but are you at all<br />
concerned about his grasp of detail and his memory over<br />
this incident?<br />
PM; He has done pretty well through all the years of<br />
travails of public life.<br />
PL: He wouldn't win Pick-a-Box at the moment though would<br />
he on his recent performance?<br />
PM: The opposition is on to it because they had the most<br />
shocking week in Parliament you can imagine. The<br />
conversation now is that the Opposition front bench is<br />
concerned about the QST, they can't market it, Dr<br />
Hewson's lost control of the House of Representatives,<br />
the Government seized that back and now we're seeing<br />
the familiar behaviour, the mafia claims of a couple of<br />
weeks ago chasing Senator Richardson down about<br />
relatives and phone calls. Where does that rank with<br />
putting a new vocational education system in place like<br />
today? Where does it rank with the separation of power<br />
generation from distribution?<br />
[ PL: Are you fully and absolutely satisfied with Senator<br />
Richardson' s integrity?)<br />
PM: They are the things and the low interest rates and the<br />
low inflation are driving Dr Hewson batty. The good<br />
news and he can't stand it so he's out there chasing<br />
Senator Richardson.<br />
PL: Are you fully satisfied with Graham Richardson's<br />
integrity in regard to this matter.<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
PL: But you'd hardly be thanking him though for the way its<br />
been handled would you?<br />
PM: I think, with these things, if the receive notoriety it<br />
means they can and should be handled better.<br />
PL: A lot of people are talking about it across the<br />
country.<br />
PM: I don't know, a lot of Journalists are talking about it<br />
I don't think it's a heart stopper out there.<br />
PL: How much damage do you think it has done to the<br />
Government?<br />
PM: if there are any negatives to It, it camouflages the<br />
fact that the opposition leader and his Party had a<br />
woeful week in Parliament. our front bench hammered<br />
them into the ground like tent stakes on Inflation,<br />
interest rates, superannuation and a whole range of<br />
issues and by Thursday they were looking very, very<br />
poorly. This issue as it turned out arose and they<br />

seized upon it and given the faot that this sort of<br />
stuff is the stock and trade of the Canberra scene they<br />
know they'd get at least a weekends run out of it.<br />
Well, we'll be there waiting for them when they turn up<br />
again.<br />
PL: Paul Keating, thankcs for your time.<br />
Good, thank you Paul.<br />
