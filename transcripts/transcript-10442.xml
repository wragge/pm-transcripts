MEDIA RELEASE<br />
STATEMENT ON T14REDBO TRAGEDY<br />
The removal late last night of threc bodies from the site of the Thredbo landslide marks the<br />
end of a tragic and extraordinary week for Tbredbo and Australians.<br />
While emergency services continue to work on the site, all those people listed as missing in<br />
this natural disaster have been accounted for.<br />
It is a -week that has been marked by great shock and sadness, enormous and unstinting effort<br />
by emergency services personnel involved, gut-wrenching frustration and tension, and of<br />
course the great joy generated by the miraculous recovery of Stuart Diver.<br />
All those involved, and the nation, have run the gamut of emotions in the past seven days.<br />
It is now timc to offer sympathy and prayers to those who have lost family memnbers, to give<br />
thanks that one life could be saved and that loss of lire was not greater and to oter our<br />
deepest appreciation to the hundreds of professionals and volunteers who attended the<br />
disaster. A Coroners' Inquest must now ensue before the famiflies involved and the village of Thrcdbo<br />
can properly begin to recover from this tragedy. I am sure all Australians will give the<br />
families, and the village, continuing support in this period.<br />
I would only add that, while most media representatives conducted themselves properly<br />
during this period, I believe it is appropriate that concerns over media behaviour raised by<br />
Thredbo residents be addressed, through the Australian Press Council.<br />
