    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Australian Government is pleased to participate in Earth Hour 2009.</p>
<p>Earth Hour is a great home-grown Australian initiative.</p>
<p>It began just two years ago.</p>
<p>But it's already a worldwide movement  -  with more than a thousand cities participating in 2009.</p>
<p>Its message is simply this.</p>
<p>Climate change is a challenge for all of us.</p>
<p>And we all need to put our shoulder to the wheel, to tackle this immense challenge.</p>
<p>That message is absolutely vital this year, as the nations of the world work together ahead of the Copenhagen Summit laster this year. </p>
<p>It's crucial that we reach a deal on cutting greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p>This is not only an environmental challenge  -  it's also a massive economic challenge, a political challenge and one of the greatest moral challenges of our age.</p>
<p>Every country must play its part  -  developed countries must take the lead, but developing countries must be a part of the solution.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, we have all been on a carbon-heavy path of economic development.</p>
<p>That must change. </p>
<p>We must transition to the low-carbon path. </p>
<p>We must be able to grow our economies, while reducing carbon pollution.</p>
<p>That will require international cooperation on a level we've never seen before  -  to reduce emissions, to share technologies, and to support those nations who can't make this transition by themselves.</p>
<p>Australia is making its contribution internationally, and at home.</p>
<p>We've committed to reduce our emissions by between 5 and 15 per cent by 2020 compared to 2000 levels.</p>
<p>That's a reduction of between 34 and 41 per cent per head of population.</p>
<p>And by 2050, emissions will be down by 60 per cent.</p>
<p>In recent days the Government has released the draft legislation for a Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, to achieve these targets. That scheme will for the first time put a cost on carbon pollution and create the incentives to reduce emissions, starting from next year.</p>
<p>We've also committed to generating 20 per cent of our electricity supply from renewable sources by 2020. That means our entire household electricity needs will come from renewable sources.</p>
<p>Early this year the Government announced a $42 billion Nation Building and Jobs Plan to help support jobs and growth in the face of the worst global economic recession since the 1930s.</p>
<p>A core part of this Plan is the largest investment in energy efficiency in the nation's history  -  which will pay for insulation or solar hot water for 2.2 million Australian homes.</p>
<p>The Australian Government is taking action globally, and at home.</p>
<p>And all Australians can show their commitment to action on climate change as well  -  by participating in Earth Hour 2009.</p>
<p>Thank you. </p>
