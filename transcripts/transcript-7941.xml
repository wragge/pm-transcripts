PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF LIVE CROSS TO IAN LESLIE, CHANNEL 10 NEWS,<br />
SYDNEY, 6 MARCH 1990<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
LESLIE: Mr Hawke, the greenies have said a Hawke victory<br />
would be better for Australia than a Peacock win. How<br />
good is that news?<br />
PM: Well, it's good news, but it's deserved news, Ian,<br />
because as I said the other night, the facts are that on<br />
every major decision we've made to save the Franklin, to<br />
stop logging in Daintree, to stop mining in Kakadu, to<br />
save the tall forests of Tasmania, they are our decisions<br />
every one of them bitterl~ y opposed by the coalition.<br />
So I'm glad of the news. I think it's deserved news.<br />
LESLIE: In real terms though, can you quantify the<br />
greenies endorsement. What does it mean?<br />
PH~: No, I'd, I'd be misleading your viewers if I tried<br />
to put a figure on it. All I can say is this. It is a<br />
fact that support for environmental candidates has<br />
obviously increased in this country as it has, I think,<br />
in every country in the world. Their vote will be up and<br />
to the extent that their preferences go to us, and<br />
solidly to us, that must be an advantage. I can't put a<br />
figure on it Ian.<br />
LESLIE: Would you say now that already you've won the<br />
election? PM: No I, that would be cocky and undeserved and<br />
improper for me to say that. All I can say is that what<br />
I've tried to do from the start of the campaign, Ian, is<br />
to campaign on issues, on facts and where I make<br />
promises, to fund them. And I think talking about issues<br />
and funding my promises is working for us..<br />
LESLIE: If, as a result of the greenies endorsement,<br />
people might say that Bob Hawke has won the election on<br />
the back of the greenies, not his own merit. That's what<br />
people might say. what would you say to that?<br />
PM: Well I'd say that it would be unfounded. People<br />
have the opportunity of knowing that we have created<br />
record employment in this country, record economic </p>
<p>2<br />
growth, that we are restructuring the economy, making it<br />
more competitive. we are getting into school and<br />
getting them educated and trained, that I've taken the<br />
lead in international issues environmentally, like the<br />
Antarctic, creating an Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation<br />
Council, taking the lead in Cambodia, taking the lead in<br />
chemical weapons. So internationally and domestically<br />
it's been a forward looking Government and we have a<br />
funded plan for the future. We're not relying on the<br />
past, Inn, we have a funded plan for the future. So<br />
we'll get a great deal on our own merit, but 1, I thank<br />
those who are directly environmentally concerned that<br />
they have faced up to the truth, Ian, that if their real<br />
concern is the environment, then it's their second<br />
preference that counts because the environmental<br />
candidates won't form the Government. It's do you want<br />
Labor, whose done all the things for the environment or<br />
the Liberals and National Party who have opposed every<br />
decision. If they were in, the Daintree would been<br />
logged, Kakadu been mined, the Franklin wouldn't be<br />
running free. So<br />
LESLIE: Mr Hawke, one quick question, you've said that<br />
you're not feeling over-confident, not feeling too cocky,<br />
at all in this election campaign have you ever felt a<br />
moment of fright that you might lose, lose this race?<br />
PM: No 1 haven't really, Ian. Simply historically I<br />
think the Australian people have usually got their<br />
Federal vote right and it would be, in my judgement, a<br />
terrible mistake for the future of Australia if you were<br />
to give government to people who can't govern themselves.<br />
If they can't govern themselves, they uan't govern the<br />
country and I, I've never thought that when the chips<br />
were down they'd do that, Ian.<br />
.0 LESLIE: Mr Hawke, we'll have to leave it there. Thank<br />
you very much for joining us.<br />
PM; Thank you very much indeed, Ian.<br />
ends </p>
