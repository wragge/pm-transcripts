TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING, MPD<br />
INTERVIEW WITH DAVE HARRISON, RADIO 4T0 TOWNSVILLE,<br />
WEDNESDAY, 20 JULY 1994<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
PM: the story and the picture was in The Bulletin today, they don't do<br />
colour.<br />
DH: We'll have a little chat to them. Mr Keating, welcome to Townsville. I<br />
hope you have a great stay here. If you can just put on the<br />
headphones, I've got our very first question for you. Certainly a<br />
statement that a lady made and I think you'll like this.<br />
C: I think I'm speaking for the kids, because, look, I consider myself a<br />
dinkum Aussie right back from an Irish convict and an Aboriginal lady.<br />
And look, I think Mr Keating is doing great wonders for this country and<br />
I hate to see people putting him down and honestly, if they vote in a<br />
Pommy, you know who I mean, I think we are all going to be sorry.<br />
You know, I think that Paul is doing a great job, leave him alone and<br />
he'll do even a greater one.<br />
DH: Well what do you reckon about that?<br />
PM: Well it doesn't come any nicer than that, thank you very much indeed<br />
for those sentiments.<br />
DH: Mate, I must ask you, you did mention the good relationship we do<br />
have with Canberra, due to Ted Lindsay, but he hasn't got a Cabinet<br />
post as yet.<br />
PM: Well, Ted is sitting beside me.<br />
DH: Ted you can make a comment there if you want, there's the<br />
microphone.<br />
PM: We've got four Queenslanders in the Cabinet and that in the Ministry is<br />
a pretty substantial number. Ted is a Parliamentary Secretary and H'e<br />
has been sworn in by the Governor-General as the Ministers are sworn<br />
in to administer a certain department or certain departments and he<br />
does that work in fine style. But the most important work, of course, he<br />
has done is respect of Townsville of course is for the people of </p>
<p>Herbert. As I said last night, when one looks back to the things which<br />
Ted has secured for Herbert such as the dam and the pipeline and the<br />
One Nation funding for the port more recently, the tax office, the<br />
Commonwealth buildings, I mean it just goes on and on and on. So as<br />
I said whenever the Finance Department see Ted wondering in the<br />
corridors they always wince because he has cost the Commonwealth<br />
budget so much.<br />
DH: Well, mate, if I could ask you just to put the headphones on just once<br />
more. I asked a couple of kids to call this morning and ask you a<br />
couple of questions.<br />
C: Hello, this is and I would like to know what Paul Keating does with<br />
the taxes and what is his favourite food?<br />
DH: Now I know that is a pretty heavy question, sir, what do you do with the<br />
taxes and your favourite food.<br />
PM: Well what we do with the taxes is we try and do the things, all the<br />
things, first of all the principal thing we do in this country is always to<br />
seek to protect the physical security of Australia through defence, so<br />
we spend money on defence and we spend money then on health and<br />
on education, on schools, on universities, in support for the aged<br />
through pensions, and aged care. These sorts of things are the things<br />
we do. And we do it, I think, well.<br />
DH: Indeed, your favourite food, mate, now that is the important one, the<br />
kids want to know.<br />
PM: My favourite food, well I'm not sure what my favourite food is. I think it<br />
is probably a good rare steak.<br />
DH: Fair enough, Port Hinchenbrook , getting back into the serious thing<br />
again. What will the Feds do if Valentine's report shows there is cause<br />
for action over the famous Oyster Point?<br />
PM: Well I'm not really across the issues here. I know there are<br />
development issues involved here and there will be, as in all these<br />
major environmental things, whether it be the wet tropics or the Great<br />
Barrier Ree or whatever it is, there is due process. And I mean, any<br />
development application will be considered properly and we'll look at<br />
all the environmental aspects.<br />
DH: Right. Now if you would like to ask Mr Keating a question 723777.<br />
OH: Mr Prime Minister, have you ever been to Magnetic Island across the<br />
road here?<br />
PM: I have years ago.<br />
OH: How many years ago. A long time?<br />
PM: Oh yes, about 15 years ago. </p>
<p>DH: Did you like it?<br />
PM: Oh yes, the whole area is lovely.<br />
DH: Changed a little bit.<br />
PM: Yes, well the whole Pacific has changed a lot since. But the coast,<br />
there is a much greater emphasis on the natural values of the coast, I<br />
think, and particularly with tourism growing the way it is. So these are<br />
great assets.<br />
DH: Indeed they are. I notice in the Financial Review this morning, Mr<br />
Downer labelled as Mr Practical and interesting stuff on the detailed<br />
policy.<br />
PM: Well it was very interesting I thought because it said that, about the<br />
policy outline, he says the outline also confirms a statement will avoid<br />
detailed policy. You see, Mr Downer wants to be in the public debate<br />
but not into policy. He said 6TY 4QR in May, he said I think,<br />
" Australians are entitled from the two major political parties to have<br />
reasonably detailed policies." Well now he is telling us he is going to<br />
avoid any detailed policy. He said, they are talking about<br />
Itcommonsense goals including focussing on those things that unite not<br />
divide us, a maintenance and strengthening of the federal system," just<br />
a series, essentially a series, of motherhood statements. So, I think<br />
what we are going to see is just a bunch of cliches sort of wrapped in<br />
the flag. And that is about all we are going to see from Mr Downer.<br />
Yet he has promised policy detail. The Government, of course, when it<br />
announces a White Paper has all the policy forensically displayed for<br />
everybody to read-and-uinderstand and those policies have an impact<br />
on the country and on society. The Liberals now think they can skate<br />
through without policies, they have been so burned, they think, by Dr<br />
Hewson's policy articulation they are going back now to no policies.<br />
Well this is just in contrast, in contr distinction, to what Mr Downer<br />
said, the public were entitled to with detailed policy announcements.<br />
DH: I think we might let a couple of North Queenslanders ask you a couple<br />
of questions. Morning Elizabeth.<br />
C: Hello how are you.<br />
DH: How are you mate?<br />
C: I'm fine.<br />
DH: That's the way, say good morning to Mr Keating.<br />
C: Good morning Mr Keating.<br />
PM: Elizabeth, how are you doing. </p>
<p>C: I'm well thank you. The question I have is my husband and I are<br />
getting the money together for a deposit on our first home but are<br />
concerned with talk of rising home loan interest rates etc. So what are<br />
your plans to ensure interest rates don't skyrocket?<br />
PM: Well, it is not a matter of skyrocketing, they are not going to skyrocket.<br />
The thing that basically governs the price of money is two elements.<br />
One the inflation rate and two, the real rate of lending above the<br />
inflation rate. Now, as you know, we had housing loans at around<br />
or 16 per cent in the latter part of the 80s and they are now down to<br />
somewhere between 7 1/ 2 to 9 1/ 2, that sort of area. But while ever<br />
the inflation rate remains low, interest rates will remain low too.<br />
C: Well I understand how interest rates work, my concern is more so<br />
comments about the Reserve Bank meeting with the banks. I mean,<br />
making it harder to get a home loan. Like will our chance of obtaining<br />
a first home just be shattered now.<br />
PM: Well I think there are two things here, there is the loans for first homes<br />
and those who build them and there are loans that go to the existing<br />
property market. That is, where no houses are being added to the<br />
stock, but the loans potentially just simply driving up the prices make<br />
housing less affordable. At the moment, housing is very affordable on<br />
the basis of price and on repayments through the interest rate. And<br />
we were last, I think housing, you have got to go back a long way to<br />
find housing more affordable than now. And need I say, that the<br />
reduction in interest rates in the last few years has meant a big<br />
increase in disposable income for families because the repayment rate<br />
has come down. I don't think there is going to be a problem about first<br />
homes. I don't think there is going to be a problem at all in fact. But<br />
we don't want to see, if you like, housing institutions, lending<br />
institutions, driving up the price of existing properties which is not<br />
going to help anybody get a house.<br />
C: Okay, thanks for your help.<br />
DH: Thank you very much Elizabeth. Morning Gina.<br />
C: Morning<br />
DH: How are you going on your North Queensland morning, alright?<br />
C: Very well thank you.<br />
DH: Say g'day to the boss.<br />
C: Good morning Mr Prime Minister.<br />
PM: How are you doing?<br />
C: Good thank you. I don't really have that many questions. The one<br />
question that really interests me is how you feel about the commitment </p>
<p>to the UIN in the Rwanda situation. I mean, are we going to do<br />
anything about that do you think?<br />
PM: Well, we have been very firm supporters of the United -Nations<br />
particularly when the Cold War finished and the s6rt of oIr'rity<br />
between the United States and the Soviet Union disappeared. A lot of<br />
regional tensions have emerged as a consequence. And the body that<br />
has, if you like, filled some of the gap is the United Nations so<br />
Australia has been very supportive of the UN in peacekeeping<br />
operations, most famously, of course, for us in Cambodia and Somalia<br />
etc. So we are prepared to participate in peacekeeping operations<br />
providing they are well planned, where the objectives are clearly set<br />
and where we think there is a start, a middle and a finish point. That is<br />
where we understand the environment we are coming into and the one<br />
which we will leave. In Rwanda these things are not yet clear and it<br />
has not been easy to devFo-p a response, although we have been<br />
looking at evaluation on the ground there and we have sent a small<br />
team to do some evaluation. When we get that report, the<br />
Government will make further judgements about it. I mean, the<br />
Foreign Minister hasd this matter under notice, virtually now<br />
permanently because of the difficulties there and the Government will<br />
be considering what it might do in Rwanda in the next few days, to<br />
week.<br />
C: That is excellent to hear. I'd also just like to make a comment, I think<br />
you are doing an excellent job.<br />
PM: Well thanks very much.<br />
C: I hear people bagging you out all the time, you know, like sort of on<br />
unemployment and I just really appreciate the situation that Australia is<br />
in with our social structure, our hospital benefits, I mean you don't<br />
have to suffer with tooth ache, and you look at these poor people over<br />
there and then you look at what we've got and I think a lot of that has<br />
got to do with your stature as a leader.<br />
PM: Well thank you very much. A couple of years we had problems, we<br />
are now growing at 5 per cent. Australia is growing faster than any<br />
Western country. We've got inflation at 1 per cent, we've had 3 per<br />
cent employment growth in the last year. So on growth generally,<br />
inflation and employment growth, we are ahead of the Western world<br />
countries now by a big margin. Now my opponents were telling us in<br />
the last election campaign, Dr Hewson and now Mr Downer at the time,<br />
we were heading for a recession, double dip recession and a<br />
depression. In fact, we are growing faster than any Western economy<br />
and we have done it without tearing to bits that social wage you refer<br />
to. Access and opportunity to health, access and opportunity to<br />
education and all these things.<br />
C: Well, that's right and I just think, you know, it's like Nehemiah said<br />
when those guys went to the War when he was rebuilding the wall to<br />
Jerusalem he said look, don't bother me now, I'm doing a job and I<br />
think that's pretty sad that you should take with your opponents.. </p>
<p>DH: OK, thank you Gina. One more from the kids and what is his favourite<br />
food?<br />
C: Hello.<br />
DH: How are you going?<br />
C: Good thanks.<br />
DH: What's your name?<br />
C: Cameron.<br />
DH: Cameron, what did you want to ask the Prime Minister?<br />
C: Why doesn't he have normal cars?<br />
PM: Well, I do.<br />
DH: Why doesn't he have normal cars? What sort of car could you see the<br />
Prime Minister driving? What sort of car to you reckon? A mini moke.<br />
C: A limo.<br />
DH: Do you reckon he'd look all right in a mini moke or something like that?<br />
C: Yes.<br />
DH: Yes, what do you reckon about a pair of roller blades?<br />
C: Yes.<br />
DH: Well, that's one from the kids too, what do you reckon? What sort of<br />
car do you drive?<br />
PM: Well, I get about in a normal car. That is, a normal coloured car when<br />
I'm in Sydney and Melbourne and Brisbane. In Canberra I have a<br />
white one, but again, it is just a standard Australian made car a<br />
Holden.<br />
DH: Good stuff. I did have a couple of guys ring me up this morning, as<br />
you know we live on the shores of the great Coral Sea, they ask does<br />
he enjoy fishing? Does he go out and ever have a bash at a bit of<br />
proper fishing?<br />
PM: Oh yes, I give fishing a nudge occasionally.<br />
DH: Do you ever get time?<br />
PM: But, they have got to jump on the line quickly. That's the only<br />
insistence I have. That is, if I put the old hook down, I want them to<br />
jump on rather fast. </p>
<p>DH: Speaking of that, the plan for the next 25 years for the Great Barrier<br />
Reef, can you give us a little bit of a hint?<br />
PM: Well, I've got the pleasure this morning of announcing the new<br />
strategic plan for the Great Barrier Reef. I think, we've got a wonderful<br />
asset in this country, but of course, it is a World Heritage item and it's<br />
listed under the World Heritage list and it ought to be because it is part<br />
of the international heritage. But, we are in charge of it and it is<br />
important, therefore, what we do with it and the Great Barrier Reef<br />
Marine Park Authority which has had basically charge of this and the<br />
research programs which have been operating and, of course, now<br />
more in concert with businesses, I think, gives us a really good chance<br />
to think about the Reef and its long term future. The details of that<br />
plan will be released today.<br />
DH: And looking forward it to, we in Townsville so very close to the Reef,<br />
from the trawlers point of view, the fishing point of view, commercial<br />
fishing and, of course diving. Have you ever gone for a little bit of<br />
diving?<br />
PM: Yes, I've been for a little bit of a dive.<br />
DH: What part of our Reef here?<br />
PM: I've been off Port Douglas, north of here and on the Reef south of here<br />
off Gladstone.<br />
DH: All right, mate, I noticed you mentioned last night that regional areas<br />
like Townsville lead the Australian economy, as industrial and<br />
population growth shifts from the cities.<br />
PM: That's right. I think that there is a view that people in regional<br />
Australia think well, they are remote from the centre of the action and<br />
they are not always considered or thought about. In fact I think, it is<br />
worth repeating the point that the growth is greater in many regional<br />
areas of Australia than it is in the capital cities. This is certainly true in<br />
Queensland. I mean, Queensland not only has the, sort of, nature<br />
running for it, a temperate climate, it has also got a shift of population<br />
from the south and it has had despite that, lower levels of<br />
unemployment and faster levels of employment growth because more<br />
is happening here. So, regions such bs Townsville are growing faster<br />
than the cities and the industrial basis of the place, if you like, the<br />
things which Ted has been involved with over the years whether it be<br />
the port or the water supply or the rail system or, you know, the<br />
general facilities provided by the Commonwealth like a regional tax<br />
office, all these things which are encouraging to business and, I think,<br />
a commitment by the community to see the place advance. Local<br />
leadership has mattered a great deal and that's why I think regions are<br />
kicked along.<br />
Anyway what we said in the White Paper is we are out there<br />
supporting regions. We want to help them help themselves. We will </p>
<p>fund them in terms of developing strategic and regional plans and we<br />
will also make infrastructure funding available through infrastructure<br />
bonds for those bits of public infrastructure which are important to<br />
regions at a particular time.<br />
So, I'm very bullish about the regions of Australia and I think the ones<br />
which are engaged in trade with Asia, we've now made such an<br />
enormous leap into Asia, we've been exporting our heads off, and we<br />
need the facilities like the port here at Townsville, but beef, agriculture<br />
generally, minerals, coal, all these sorts of things are important in<br />
trade and, I think, as the business community gets its pecker up about<br />
its capacity and its confidence to do trade and do it well in Asia, I think,<br />
particularly the northern regions of the country are going to really fire.<br />
DH: Not shifting Canberra up here are you?<br />
PM: A bit of that warm weather would do us all a lot of good.<br />
DH: Good morning, Dutchy.<br />
C: How you going mate?<br />
DH: Good mate. Say g'day to the boss.<br />
C: How you going sir?<br />
PM: Good, how are you going?<br />
C: What I'd like to know and, I think, a lot of people ask this question, is<br />
why do the politicians and ex-politicians continuously get lurks and<br />
perks while we're in so many economic problems?<br />
PM: Well, I don't think people get lurks and perks. I mean a back bencher<br />
is paid a salary and an allowance, most of the allowance they spend<br />
and, I think, Government works in this country. If you look at the last<br />
ten years, I mean, Australia has changed more than any western<br />
country. Ten years ago we'd never had, for instance, a major<br />
international tourism industry which has come by virtue of the<br />
deregulation of this economy. We never had an efficient<br />
manufacturing sector as we have today. We never had internationally<br />
traded services like education and health as we have today. And, it is<br />
no accident therefore we are growing at 5 per cent and our inflation<br />
rate is 1 per cent and that we are leading the western world in these<br />
growth rates and in this economic performance.<br />
Now, a lot of that has come from leadership in the political system. A<br />
lot has come from the community joining with those policies and<br />
making it work. So, I think the notion that the public is poorly served<br />
by their system of government is wrong. I think Australia has shown<br />
that its system of government works and it works effectively and it<br />
works well. </p>
<p>C: No, I'm not saying that the government isn't working well. I'm just<br />
saying that back benchers for instance, they've got an annual Ãµ alary of<br />
$ 74, 000. I mean, haven't they just vote on it whenever they want.<br />
PM: No, no, it is set under wage principles. It is set, in the case of Federal<br />
MPs, the Remuneration Tribunal. It is set independently and it has<br />
been now tied to a division of the public service. So, it doesn't move<br />
really until public service salaries move and, of course, public service<br />
salaries move with general movements in salaries across the<br />
economy, across society. So, MPs essentially caught up in, if you like,<br />
community wage shifts and can't simply I mean, technically the<br />
Parliament can vote itself a rise, but it doesn't do that. It has given this<br />
power to a tribunal which gives it then increases under wage<br />
principals.<br />
DH: Ok, Dutchy, thank you very much, good on you mate. Mate, the<br />
Australian Institute of Marine Science is getting a big grant. What's<br />
happening there?<br />
PM: Well, it is I'm very pleased to say and today I'm announcing that too,<br />
but let me tell your listeners that the IBM company an linternational<br />
Business Machine company is giving one of four grants world wide to<br />
the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority for research and, I think,<br />
this is a great feather in the cap of the Authority and a substantial<br />
grant as well. And, again I think, proves the point that we do seriously<br />
manage the Barrier Reef and the authorities we have doing it are<br />
getting international attention and international support.<br />
DH: Well, it's a beautiful spot down there. Have you been down to AIMS,<br />
it's great down there.<br />
PM: Yes, I've been a couple of times in the past. I've had a few looks over<br />
it. Ted and I were down there about a year ago.<br />
DH: And with all the prawns. The aquaculture there is great you get big,<br />
big prawns. Go to the phones once more. Good morning.<br />
C: Good morning.<br />
DH: How are you going?<br />
C: Good, how are you?<br />
DH: What is your name mate? Ok Harry, say g'day to Mr Prime Minister.<br />
C: Hello, Prime Minister, how are you?<br />
PM: Good.<br />
C: I was just wondering why is it necessary for you to be hitting Mr<br />
Downer over the head with a warm lettuce rather than, in fact, what is<br />
required would be a pair of bolt cutters. </p>
<p>PM: Well, look, the public will take care of Mr Downer. We have these<br />
people who shoot onto the scene and they are going to do wonders<br />
with the big stick and then we find that their detailed policies are only<br />
going to be basically what shall I say, not detailed at all but just<br />
rhetoric and some intimation of where their policy directions are going.<br />
Now, public life in this country, the public of this country demand<br />
change and they keep the political system up to it and if you are in the<br />
market place, but you don't have any ideas, you soon get found out<br />
and no amount of, sort of, conservative waffling by Mr Downer is going<br />
to safe him from a harsh judgement at the next election by people who<br />
say well, hang on, we've got competitive disciplines and pressure on<br />
the government, we are going to have it on you too and you are not<br />
going to be exonerated. But, you see, what's happened to the Liberal<br />
party, they had Andrew Peacock in 1984, they've had blanc mange<br />
policies. He lost, so they said we better go to harder policies so we'll<br />
take John Howard. So they went to harder policies and they took John<br />
Howard and he lost. And, they said, well, that's pretty bad, we better<br />
go back to not really standing for much, that way we can't be attacked<br />
so they put Andrew Peacock back in. He lost again. So, they said,<br />
that's no good, we better go to something harder. Let's get us some<br />
real policy definition. So, they took then John Hewson on. And then<br />
he lost. Now they're saying well look, he lost because he had policies,<br />
so we are better now with somebody who doesn't. So, we'll take on Mr<br />
Downer. So, its soft, hard, soft, hard, soft. You see, you get the<br />
sequence soft, hard, soft, hard, soft, so we've got another softie<br />
there.<br />
DH: Ok mate, thank you very much. One more call, good morning.<br />
C: G'day.<br />
DH: How are you mate?<br />
C: Good. I'd just like to ask Mr Keating a question.<br />
DH: Ok, make sure you finish every sentence with an ' ay' you know that.<br />
That's the great North Queensland way.<br />
C: OK. I've just read that the Labor government takes 32 cents in tax in<br />
every litre of fuel, but only about 10 per cent of this goes back into<br />
road funding. Why would this be Mr Keating?<br />
PM: Well, let me just say this about tax generally. You've got to look at tax<br />
across the board. This is the Idwest taxed country in the western<br />
world. Now, that's a big statement, but let me just repeat it again.<br />
According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and<br />
Development, that's the western world, if you like, economic research<br />
secretariat the OECD. Of the 27 member states of the OECD, that's<br />
all the industrialii&amp; d cauntries, Australia has the lowest rate of tax in<br />
the western world and that comes by way of income tax, company tax,<br />
excise, et cetera. Now, all of this goes into a pool and then it is<br />
allocated back to the States by way of financial assistance grants in<br />
part and to Commonwealth functions such as pensions et cetera, </p>
<p>including road works. Now, the Commonwealth does the national<br />
highway and the States do the arterial roads and the city arterials and<br />
the country roads. So, you can't really look at it and say, so many<br />
cents per litre comes here and so much goes there because we don't<br />
hypothecate every dollar that comes in petrol back onto roads because<br />
we pay it to the State. They spend money on roads, they spend it on<br />
hospitals.<br />
C: So, were does the balance of the 90 per cent of all that tax go to?<br />
PM: Well, that figure is not right. The fact is the money goes to<br />
consolidated revenue and when you go down to the doctor and you get<br />
your 85 per cent rebate, you're getting part of it back there. When you<br />
drive on the road, if it's a national highway, you're getting part of it<br />
back there.<br />
C: Ok thanks.<br />
DH: I've got to ask you one thing. The commemoration last year, you<br />
couldn't make it up.<br />
PM: No, because I had functions either side of that.<br />
DH: OK next year year we've got our year celebrations of the peace. Do<br />
you think you could come and say g'day?<br />
PM: Let me just say this, we've got last year we had the well, through<br />
1942 50 years later 1992/ 1993. We had the 50th anniversary of the<br />
Coral Sea battle and the battles of Kokoda and I went to Papua New<br />
Guinea and to Kokoda as I've been in many parts of the pacific to the<br />
Solomon Islands, but you can't do everything and I've just been this<br />
year to D-Day celebrations in Europe, in Britain and France, for the<br />
anniversary of the landing at Normandy and, of course, next year<br />
will be the VE-Day victory in Europe and VP-Day victory in the<br />
Pacific. So, victory in the Pacific, the Government is very committed to<br />
making clear that it was in World War II that Australia was threatened,<br />
that continental Australia was under threat from the forces of Japan in<br />
World War II which was not the case in World War I and we want to<br />
make clear that the battle for Australia and the battle for the Pacific<br />
was something that our nation should never forget and should rejoice<br />
in our victory and appreciate the people who were involved with it.<br />
