PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH PAUL LYNEHARI 7.30 REPORT<br />
3 MARCH 1989<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
LYNEHAM: Welcome to the program.<br />
PM: Thank you Paul.<br />
LYNEHAM: You all agreed at today's conference that there<br />
was no quick fix to the housing problem. The thing is<br />
that's what many families need isn't it?<br />
PM: Yes well you can't give a quick fix. What we've done,<br />
it's a unique thing for the Commonwealth to involve itself<br />
in the housing scene in the way we did today and I think<br />
that was acknowledged because basically these things are a<br />
State responsibility on the supply side. But we just felt<br />
that we had to move in.<br />
LYNEHAM: There has been a bit of whingeing about the land<br />
you have offered. Nick Greiner said some of it is subject<br />
to flooding and some of it is part of an airport and so on.<br />
PM: I must say however in fairness to Nick he might be<br />
saying it outside but he was very cooperative in there. We<br />
said to the States if you can identify parcels of<br />
Commonwealth land which we haven't included which you think<br />
from your point of view may be better, let's talk about<br />
that. LYNEHAM: wouldn't it come onto the market quicker if you<br />
gave it to private enterprise?<br />
PM: Not necessarily but what we've said is we'd like to<br />
talk with the States and if they're not interested in<br />
particular parts well then of course we'll go to the private<br />
sector. I think it may involve a mix.<br />
LYNEHAM: Are we inevitably moving away from the Australia<br />
of the quarter acre block and the Hills Hoist?<br />
PM: No, I don't think in terms of people who want that,<br />
that we will be moving away from it. But in fairness to<br />
Paul I don't think the point he was making was really </p>
<p>-2-<br />
LYNEHAM: He got a bit of a caning for it didn't he?<br />
PM: Yes, and I think it was a bit unfair to him because he<br />
uses language quickly to make a point and I don't think<br />
people understood that what Paul was really saying and what<br />
our position is, that for those who still want and see the<br />
advantages in having the quarter acre block with a hoist and<br />
all that goes with it, beauty. I mean, that still will be<br />
what perhaps a great majority will do. But it clearly is<br />
the case Paul that the preferences of a lot of people would<br />
be to have medium density housing in not only the inner<br />
cities but in other areas which would have them closer to<br />
their place of employment with a whole lot of advantages<br />
which they would put over the concept of the quarter acre<br />
block. But for those who still aspire to that, that's the<br />
way it will be.<br />
LYNEHAM: The Saulwick poll this morning had Labor four<br />
points behind the Coalition across the nation, but ten<br />
points behind in Sydney. Is that the housing crisis?<br />
PM: I think it may be something to do with that. I just<br />
frankly am a little bit sceptical about the extent of change<br />
in a relatively short period, I think there's a bit of an<br />
overstatement there. But in other things in Sydney, I think<br />
in Sydney<br />
LYNEHAM: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: That's partly, but I think also as far as the media is<br />
concerned I must say that the concentration of talkback<br />
radio is a phenomenon in Sydney, it's got something to do<br />
with it. I think we get a bit of a belting on talkback<br />
radio, I think that's got something to do with it.<br />
LYNEHAM: Are you going to do more talkback radio then to<br />
counter this?<br />
PM: Yes, I've already started.<br />
LYNEHAM: The Saulwick poll also suggested that the<br />
Coalition has a 5% lead among women over Labor, the gender<br />
gap, you identified it at the recent ministry meeting.<br />
where does it come from, what's going wrong?<br />
PM: I think we have to accept a good deal of<br />
responsibility. I think there hasn't been the success in<br />
communication of what we've done for women obviously that<br />
there should have been, because it's conceded in the<br />
organisations of women that there's no government that has<br />
done as much for women as we have. It's clear that we<br />
haven't communicated to women, I think, as well as we<br />
should. Why they should view this Government with failure,<br />
that communication will be made in the period between<br />
now and the next election. </p>
<p>LYNEHAM: Someone has said to me that it's a bit patronising<br />
to sort of sharpen up your approach to women with an<br />
election just over the horizon.<br />
PM: It's not intended to be patronising, I can assure women<br />
of that. It's simply a concession, an admission if you like<br />
of some fault on our part. When you've done as much in the<br />
area of importance to women as we have done and where we've<br />
created as I want to point out to the women of Australia<br />
most importantly, not just for them but for their daughters,<br />
the Australia that we have created will be one in which<br />
their daughters will grow up with a much broader range of<br />
opportunities than girls have ever ha&amp; before. Now if we<br />
haven't got that across as we clearly haven't sufficiently<br />
well, then we would be silly if we didn't understand it and<br />
take steps to get the message across. I can assure you<br />
there's no patronising, it's a whack behind the ear for<br />
ourselves. we haven't done as well as we should have with<br />
communication. LYNEHAM: This extraordinary rumpus within the NSW branch<br />
over the Liverpool preselection there. In the Supreme Court<br />
there today you had a demo outside the branch office, the<br />
head office. Does this warrant Federal intervention?<br />
PM: Well, it's not very elegant, I don't like it but let me<br />
say this. If I had to take my choice between the internal<br />
condition of Labor and the coaltion, I go for Labor every<br />
time. Sure it's not elegant, not pleasant that particular<br />
issue you talk about in NSW but how would you like the<br />
situation in the Liberal Party and with the National Party.<br />
I mean, brawling now, brawling now in Victoria, as to<br />
whether they're going to have a joint coalition ticket for<br />
the Senate. The fights that are going on within the Liberal<br />
Party and within the National Party, look I prefer to have<br />
no dispute, no problem at all in the Labor Party, I don't<br />
like what's happening there<br />
LYNEHAM: How are you going to get rid of this problem?<br />
PM: Well it's not my responsibility. It's a matter for the<br />
State organisation in NSW.<br />
LYNEHAM: It's damaging federally isn't it?<br />
PM: I don't think it's damaging federally, but obviously<br />
nothing is helpful politically which reflects some problem<br />
within your show and that's true for the Liberals, true for<br />
the Nationals, true for us. I'd rather it hadn't happened.<br />
LYNEHAM: Clyde Holding says he is going to stand again for<br />
Melbourne Ports at next election. Some members of caucus<br />
think he should think seriously about standing aside in the<br />
interests of allowing some new blood in. is there any<br />
validity </p>
<p>-4-<br />
PM:, Into the Parliament or into the Ministry?<br />
LYNEHAM: Into the Parliament.<br />
PM: Well, I'd seen somewhere It hasn't been put to me.<br />
Clyde obviously is well known in that electorate and well<br />
respected I think he feels. I can understand that feeling<br />
that he's got the best chance of maximising the vote.<br />
LYNEHAM: Do you think he has?<br />
PM: I would think he has. I mean he is well known, I think<br />
he's represented the electorate well.<br />
LYNEHAM: Does Gerry Hand have your unqualified confidence?<br />
PM: Yes. I think that Gerry, more than any Minister that I<br />
can recall in this very very delicate, difficult portfolio,<br />
has shown these characteristics Paul. Absolute commitment.<br />
I don't think there is anyone, including on the Opposition,<br />
who questions his commitment, a sensitivity. I mean I can't<br />
recall anyone who has gone to so much trouble to travel all<br />
over Australia to visit wide range of Aboriginal communities<br />
to listen. Listening is hard in politics. Not many people<br />
are good at it. Gerry Hand is. He has vision and he's<br />
also, importantly he's got toughness and people have tried<br />
to generate some sort of signer about Gerry that he's soft,<br />
that he's a soft touch for the Aborigines. He's not. He<br />
can be as tough as nails when he sees something that he<br />
doesn't believe is right.<br />
LYNEHAM: Do you agree with Kevin Gosper that the Senate<br />
Drugs in Sport Inquiry has damaged the international<br />
reputation of Australian sport?<br />
PM: I can't make a judgement about that. I respect Kevin<br />
Gosper very very much. He's not only a fine athlete but<br />
he's an enormously committed sports administrator. If Kevin<br />
makes that judgement I would be loathe to dispute it.<br />
LYNEHAM: Finally, how does it really feel to be Knight<br />
Special Class of the Most Exulted Order of the White<br />
Elephant? PM: I suppose because of the easy shot at the writers for<br />
cartoonists and others the White Elephant order, one may<br />
have hoped there was another name for it, but having said<br />
that, I just do point out Paul for your listeners it is the<br />
highest order capable of being awarded by the Thai<br />
leadership to any foreigner. To that extent I take it not<br />
only personally, but for this country as a very high honour.<br />
LYNEHAM: Sir Elephant, thanks for your time.<br />
PM: Thank you very much.<br />
