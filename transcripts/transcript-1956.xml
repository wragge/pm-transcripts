OPENING OF THE MA[ T CONROY MEMORIAL POOL 68/ 172<br />
AT MARYMEAD CHILDREN'S CENTlRE<br />
NARRABUNDAH, A. C. T. 16 NOVEMBER 1968<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton<br />
Mr. Chairman, Mrs. Conroy, Ladies and Gentlemen:-<br />
In a very few short moments, I will be opening and naming<br />
this Matt Conroy Wading Pool. I am glad to have been asked to do it for two<br />
reasons. One is a personal reason; and that is that Matt Conroy and his<br />
family lived just across the street from us when we first came to live in<br />
Canberra, and were the first neighbours that we ever got to know in Narrabundah.<br />
During the years that we knew each other, I think the friendship<br />
between our families and between Matt Conroy and myself grew constantly.<br />
Certainly my admiration for him as a man grew constantly. He was all those<br />
things which Mr. Graham has said he was.<br />
He was in addition somebody who got happiness out of each day<br />
of life and put effort into everything he did, whether it was his work as a<br />
public servant, whether it was the time he spent in sporting activities.... I<br />
think he finished up being a pretty good bowler, but he began as a very good<br />
rugby player and as a very good cricketer and as a very good all round sport;<br />
whether it was the time he put into those club activities, those sporting<br />
activities, the endeavours to attain better academic qualifications in order<br />
the better to be able to do his work in the public service, he gave unsparingly<br />
and enjoyed each moment of his life. That is the personal reason why I am<br />
glad to be here and why I am so glad to have this opportunity of saying something<br />
at the opening of the pool dedicated to his memory.<br />
Another reason, of course, and it is perhaps in a sense much<br />
the same sort of reason, is that he was a member of the Lions Club which<br />
constructed this pool, another indication of service to the community. He<br />
belonged to it, I think, for at least four years, and at the time of his death<br />
was Vice-President of it. He gave, as in other fields, during those four<br />
years, unstinted effort in the civic activities of the Lions.<br />
These are by no means negligible. I cannot, of course, call to<br />
mind all the activities in which they engage. This is one example, this pool<br />
from which the children who stay for a short or a long time at Marymead will<br />
continue to get pleasure.<br />
There is a great long list of other civic activities that the Lions<br />
Club has engaged in the provision of equipment to the Red Cross for Meals on<br />
Wheels, the raising of $ 55, 000 in the branch which first started here, quite<br />
irrespective of the individual work which each member of the Lions Club has<br />
put in, for the betterment of the community in which they live, for assistance<br />
to those who needed assistance in that community, and always with a certain<br />
emphasis towards trying to assist the children in the community.<br />
So both because of my own feeling towards him and because of<br />
the work he gave to the Club, which has built this pool and has named it after<br />
him, I have.... I will not say pleasure.... I have satisfaction in being able to<br />
perform this duty this afternoon and to pay this tribute.<br />
I think there is very little more to say on an occasion such as this.<br />
A man's works speak for him. The recognition of his comrades speaks for him.<br />
And the pleasure that future generations will get from this and other activities<br />
will continue to speak for him and his associates in the Lions Club. And so I<br />
open this Pool and name it The Matt Conroy Wading Pool. </p>
