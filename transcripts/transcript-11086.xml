<p>E&amp;OE............................................................................................</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, the CARE workers have been seen by our Ambassador,</p>
<p> what's your reaction to the news?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I am very pleased that at last consular access has been granted</p>
<p> and I am also pleased to hear that both men are in good condition.</p>
<p> Can I say on behalf of the Australian Government to the families of</p>
<p> those two men that we share the relief that you must be feeling at</p>
<p> the present time. We will join you in even greater relief if as should</p>
<p> happen the two men are released. They are caring humanitarian Australians.</p>
<p> They are not soldiers. They are not combatants. They have no quarrel</p>
<p> with the people of Yugoslavia, or the Government of Yugoslavia. They</p>
<p> were in that country as the guest of that country to help the people</p>
<p> of that country. And in those circumstances the decent humanitarian</p>
<p> thing to occur is for the men to be released. Now, I hope that happens</p>
<p> and we all keep our fingers crossed and say a few prayers that it</p>
<p> might happen. I don't know and I think we just have to wait and</p>
<p> see.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser apparently is...has got a visa and</p>
<p> may be able to get there as early as tomorrow, are you encouraged</p>
<p> by that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Jeff, it's one of these situations where it's important</p>
<p> not to, sort of, overstate or understate the situation. What matters</p>
<p> is getting the two men out. That's the only thing that matters</p>
<p> to me and obviously Mr Fraser is doing everything he can and I compliment</p>
<p> him for that as the Chairman of CARE and as former Prime Minister</p>
<p> he has a lot of experience in these things and I wish him well. I</p>
<p> hope that we will see them released and I really am encouraged by</p>
<p> the fact that there has been consular access. But it's a difficult</p>
<p> situation and sometimes the less said at a difficult time the better.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Are you concerned also that they are being held in the [inaudible]</p>
<p> of defence in Belgrade under....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh look, I think it's a bit pointless getting into that micro</p>
<p> comment. I am pleased they have had consular access, I hope they will</p>
<p> be released and I send my good wishes to them and to their families.</p>
<p> And I know that the whole country is hoping and praying that they</p>
<p> will be released and that they are safe and sound. Thank you.</p>
