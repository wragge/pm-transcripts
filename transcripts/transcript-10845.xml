    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am delighted to announce today that the Australian Inland Rail Expressway</p>
<p> System is taking another step towards becoming reality.</p>
<p>Should the Australian Inland Rail Expressway become a reality, it</p>
<p> will deliver new jobs, investment and infrastructure to regional Australia.</p>
<p> It will provide high speed rail links, with potential for adding a</p>
<p> natural gas pipeline, water pipelines in parts of rural Australia</p>
<p> and the laying of fibre optic cable. These additions to the railway</p>
<p> will be developed as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The railway will extend from Melbourne to Darwin, while also providing</p>
<p> high speed links from Brisbane to Melbourne and Sydney to Melbourne.</p>
<p> For the first time, Victorian, New South Wales and Queensland producers</p>
<p> would have access to high speed links to send their produce to the</p>
<p> gateway of the burgeoning Asian market.</p>
<p>Australian Transport and Energy Corridor Pty Ltd (ATEC), which first</p>
<p> proposed this visionary project, has signed an agreement with Abigroup</p>
<p> to take the project through to completion. They will provide a full</p>
<p> feasibility report to the five Governments in about a year, and seek</p>
<p> approval to proceed to detailed planning. ATEC and Abigroup are both</p>
<p> Australian owned companies.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that the network will be finalised by 2004. I congratulate</p>
<p> the private sector on getting behind this visionary project.</p>
<p>The Federal Government stands ready to facilitate this project, with</p>
<p> all Commonwealth processes to be finalised as efficiently as possible.</p>
<p> In addition, the Commonwealth will consider introducing legislation</p>
<p> to facilitate this project if the need can be demonstrated.</p>
<p>A project such as this comes once in a generation. It will open up</p>
<p> new industries and jobs throughout regional Australia, it will cut</p>
<p> the cost of living in regional Australia. It will signal the re-birth</p>
<p> of many regions in Australia. Industry estimates suggest that the</p>
<p> railway network will create tens of thousands of jobs throughout Australia.</p>
<p>Importantly, Australians will also have the opportunity to invest</p>
<p> in this remarkable venture in about two years time. A public company</p>
<p> owning the railway will be floated, allowing ordinary families to</p>
<p> be a part of this nation building project.</p>
<p> The project will build on the significant efforts the Coalition</p>
<p> has made to rebuild regional Australia. These include the Darwin to</p>
<p> Alice Springs railway, the $1.25bn Natural Heritage Trust, the $500m</p>
<p> rural package and reforms to quarantine.</p>
<p>In particular, I pay tribute to the vision of Everald Compton and</p>
<p> his colleagues for developing this vision, as well as the Federal</p>
<p> Member for Longman, Mr Mal Brough, who has given tireless support</p>
<p> to this remarkable venture.</p>
<p> 23 June 1998</p>
