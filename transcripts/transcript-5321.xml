UTRA( A_ LIaq-AY<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA THURSDAY, 10 APRIL, 1980<br />
ZIMBABWE INDEPENDENCE CELEBRATIONS<br />
The Prime Minister, the Right Honourable Malcolm Fraser,<br />
will be attending the Zimbabwe independence celebrations in<br />
Salisbury on 17-18 April. The Prime Minister of Zimbabwe,<br />
Mr. Robert Mugabe, has extended a personal invitation to a small<br />
number of heads of government including Mr. Fraser.<br />
Other heads of government who have indicated they will attend<br />
so far include President Kaunda of Zambia, President Shagari<br />
of Nigeria, and Prime Minister Gandhi of India. A large<br />
number of countries will be represented at the independence<br />
celebrations. The achievement of an independent Zimbabwe is an event of major<br />
significance in the history of Southern Africa. After fifteen.<br />
years of illegality and eight years of a bitter civil war,<br />
Rhodesia was returned to legality as a British colony last<br />
December, and free an'" fair elections were held under<br />
Britishn supervision.<br />
These elections reSulted in a clear victory for Mr. Mugabe's<br />
party, the Zirabab;,, e African National Union ( Patriotic Front).<br />
Mr. Mugabe was appointed Prime Minister on 4 March but the<br />
British Gcvern~ or, Lord Soames, has continued to exercise his<br />
functions in the pre-independence period. At' midnight an<br />
17 April, the British flag will be lowered and the flag of<br />
independent Zimbabwe will be raised. Zimbabwe is expected<br />
to join the Commonwealth on independence.<br />
Australia has contributed to the process leading to Zimbabwe's.<br />
independence in a number of important ways. At the Lusaka<br />
Corz~ onwealth Heads of Government meeting last August, Australia<br />
was a member of the six-nation contact group which drafted the<br />
principles for a Rhodesian settlement which formed the basis<br />
of the subsequent Lancaster House negotiations.<br />
Australia provided a 154-man contingent to the Commonwealth<br />
Ceasefire Monitoring Force. Australia also sent an eightrman.-<br />
national group to observe the election, and an Australian-<br />
Observer, Mr. K. C. O. Shann, served on the Commonwealth<br />
Election Observer Group.<br />
I am looking forward to a close and fruitful relationship between<br />
Australia and the new nation of Zimbabwe. As previously announced,<br />
the Australian liaison office in Salisbury is to become a.<br />
resident High Commission. 00-0---</p>
