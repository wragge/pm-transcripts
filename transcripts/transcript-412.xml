BROADCAST NO. 6.<br />
BROADCAST BY THE PRIME MINISTER ( RT. HON. R. G. LI: ENZIfES<br />
OVER NATIONAL. ST. TIONS AT J_ 175_<br />
MONDAY, 41th DECEBER, 1961.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
In my Policy Speech I made two statements which I will<br />
repeat. The first was:<br />
" After 12 years, the AoLP. can easily make a series<br />
of brand new offers without saying where the new<br />
hundreds of millions are to come from, though they<br />
will, of course, come from you."<br />
This forecast was completely borne out on the following<br />
evening when Mr. Calwell produced a series of promises, the cost of<br />
which on authoritative calculations runs into hundreds of millions;<br />
anywhere between œ 24Cm and œ 390m on his specific offers and many,<br />
many more millions on those which were more vaguely stated. It<br />
has been very interesting for me, going around Australia, to discover<br />
how widespread is the realisation that the people themselves would<br />
have to pay, since governrznts have no money to spend except that<br />
which has bejn earned and paid over by tax or loan by the men and<br />
women of Aurtralia. I gathered the impression from the Labour Policy Speech<br />
that Mr. Calwell thought that it could all be done without increasing<br />
taxeso Mr. Calwell's predecessor, Mr. Chifley, so frequently<br />
quoted by Members of the Labour Party, said quite plainly in<br />
Paliament, with reference to a much smaller proposal:<br />
" It is of no use attempting to fool the people with promises.<br />
These things can be done only by the imposition of additional<br />
taxes,"<br />
But today's Labour men don't quote that remark.<br />
The second statement in the Policy Speech was;<br />
" We offer you good government. The essential quality<br />
of good government is that it should have sound and<br />
intelligible principles, that it should pursue great<br />
national and social objectives with resoluteness, that<br />
it should be able to meet the storms that arise from<br />
time to time with a proper sense of navigation, that<br />
it should have cohesion in its own ranks and a strong<br />
sense of mutual loyalty,"<br />
I stand by that definition. Good government is what<br />
Australians are entitled to, When you vote on December 9 you will,<br />
I know, exercise your judgment as to which side can give you good<br />
government in the sense that I have described.<br />
Do you really think that the present Labour Opposition is<br />
capable of giving it to you? What are its sound and intelligible<br />
principles? I had thought that the major plank in ito platform<br />
involved the nationalisation of industries., The Member for Yarra,<br />
a member of Labour's front bench, an absolute certainty to be a<br />
Minister if Labour won this election, wrote in June this year, only<br />
months ago, that economic power must be transferred " by controls,<br />
by public enterprise and by nationalisation". Mr. Calwell is a<br />
determined advocate of Constitutional amendments which would enable<br />
this objective to be achieved. Yet, for purposes of this election,<br />
he has declared a moratorium on the great socialist principleø He<br />
cays to you, in effect: " Don't worry about our great socialist<br />
principle by which we live and move and have our being; just vote<br />
us into office and we will forget about thct principle for the next<br />
three years" o </p>
<p>Can the deeply divided Federal Labour Party profess to<br />
have cohesion in its own ranks, to say nothing of mutual loyalty?<br />
The very idea is r~ dictlous. For on the great matters which will<br />
determine whether government is good or baa, it is almost impossible<br />
to obtain a concerted view from our opponents0<br />
They profess to be opposed to Communism0 Yet they<br />
resisted our secret ballots law which restored proper democrati~ c<br />
rights to trades unionists, and if they honour the latest instructions<br />
they have had from outside, they will repeal the legislation<br />
and leave the way clear for a great Communist revival.. Where do<br />
they stand on the threats to world peace presented by the bullying<br />
and aggressive tactics of the Communist Powers? That many Labour<br />
members are profoundly opposed to the Cotmunist strategy is, of<br />
course, quite clear, I do not question Mr, Calwell's personal<br />
attitude, But he has sitting close to him prcepective ministers<br />
who are sel,-m heard to voice a criticism of the Communist Powers<br />
but take a good dual of time in attacks upon the United Kingdom<br />
and the United States of America, without whose s%' aunch friendchip<br />
completely re-established by us, Australia's security would be in<br />
danger* Where do-Is the Labour Party stand on such great<br />
associations as those in the ANZUS Pact with America and New<br />
Zealand and in SEATO which includes three Asian powers and is<br />
powerfully backed by the United States, United Kingdom and France?<br />
I remind you that they have never once had a good word<br />
to say about either arran,,, ment.<br />
What are their pDrinciples on defence? Every time the<br />
defence estimates have been before Parliament for years they have<br />
criticised them. it is not long ago that they were proposing that<br />
we should heavily reduce our defence expenditure. All this is<br />
graciously concealed from you in the present election.<br />
Where does the Labour Party stand on the vital principle<br />
of responsible government?<br />
That is a system under which the people elect a Parliament<br />
and may dismiss it at the next election if they think fit, while<br />
the Parliam~ ent produces through the normal processes a Prime Ministel.<br />
and Ministers who must accept responsibilities for their policies<br />
in the course of Parliamen~ tary debate. The Labour Party cannot<br />
possibly pretend to believe in this system for, as I have frequently<br />
pointed out, the Federal Labour Party is absolutely bound by the<br />
decisions on policy of the Federal Conference of the Australian<br />
Labour Party which is, of course, not elected by you and has no<br />
responsibility to you,<br />
It is the simple fact that you could elect Labour on<br />
such policy as it now presents to you, only to find that in the<br />
course of the life of the Parliament this outside body could, as<br />
the isuapreme governing authority and policy making body" give<br />
different orders and compel their performance,<br />
I could go on like this for a long time if I had the time<br />
or you had the patience, but what I have said to you is designed<br />
to emphasise that, with the complete mutual loyalty which has<br />
existed among Ministers and Members on the Government side for the<br />
last 12 years, we can offer you a continuance of good government<br />
with no qualifications, with no reservations, and with a record of<br />
performance to back it. The short survey of the Labour Party's<br />
position which I have put to you will, I think, satisfy you that<br />
labour cannot offer you good government in this sense, It is no<br />
doubt for this reason thrat in this election they have offered you a<br />
series of inducements in cash or credit hoping that if they cannot<br />
persuade your minds they may at any rate have a chance of appealing<br />
to your pockets. </p>
<p>Time after time you have rejected this offensive<br />
approach. You have with sound common sense refused to be<br />
bought with your own money, I am confident that the current<br />
attempt to get you to reverse this judgment and to forget the<br />
essential character of good government will once more fail. </p>
