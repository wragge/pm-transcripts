FOR PRESS* 148RAPF0 PM. NO. 135/ 1967<br />
DEVALUATION: REAFFIRMATION OF GOVERNMEI'WS<br />
DECISION<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr Harold Holt<br />
Since the Commonwealth Government* decided on<br />
November to maintain the value of the Australian Dollar when Britain<br />
devalued the Pount Sterling, the effect on Australian Industries and the<br />
economic outlook in general have been under continuous study.<br />
Nothing has emerged to alter the assessmnents made at the<br />
time of the British devaluation and on which the Government's decision<br />
was based. If anything, subsequent developments have strengthened our<br />
confidence in the wisdom of our decision. The Government was confident,<br />
and remains confident, that in sum, the net direct effects on our balance<br />
of payments and on our economy are not likely to be more than marginal.<br />
We beI eve they will, in the long term, be favourable.<br />
We have recognised, however, that some particular<br />
Industries might be significantly affected in the short term.<br />
Representations on behalf of industries likely to be affeced<br />
have been made to -the Government and are being studied. The Economic<br />
Committee of Cabinet, the, departments directly concerned with trade and<br />
Industry, and the industry groups themselves, are also active in asse~ sing<br />
effects and are in close* consultation.<br />
To ensure -that during this period of adjustment misconceptions<br />
do not arise and thereby distort the decision the Government has taken'and<br />
the reasons for taking that decision,' it seems desirable to restate the<br />
basis on which our judgments have been formed.<br />
My colleague, the Minister for Trade and Industry has<br />
suggested that the decision, as taken, was contrary to the traditional and<br />
technical indicators. Because of his absence abroad at the GATT meetings<br />
In Geneva, my colleague did not have the advantage of participating In the<br />
wide-ranging Cabinet discussions, nor did he have the detail before him<br />
of the latest appreciation of the likely effects of British devaluation on our<br />
own economy. The facts we faced were that, while Sterling was beind devalued<br />
by a moderate percentage, nnst other countries, Including those who haye<br />
the largest share of our overseas trade today, decided not to devalue.<br />
The United States, Ca n ad a and the Common Market countries made<br />
immediate decisions, and we had the benefit of this In forming our own<br />
Judgment. We knew that, of the twelve leading trading nations, including<br />
Australia, only the United Kingdom had devalued.<br />
In the final result, of 107 countries who are members of the<br />
International Monetary Fund, only 16 devalued their currencies. The other<br />
91 countries, which include all major countries of the Western World<br />
except the United Kingdom, decided to adhere to their exchange rates. ./ 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
We had to see things in perspective. Only 13 per cent of our<br />
exports went to the United Kingdom last year and, all told, the countries which<br />
have devalued took only 20 per cent of our total exports. Had we followed<br />
Sterling, we would have been devaluing against the greater part of the Western<br />
World and our principal markets.<br />
Such a step would have been justifiable only If our own domestic<br />
and external relations made it absolutely necessary.<br />
There were no elements In our economic situation to warrant<br />
this. The economy is sound, and we have a steady growth rate.<br />
While our external reserves have fal~ sn to some extent from the<br />
very high level they reached In 1963-64, they are still relatively strong.<br />
Our reserves In gold and foreign exctiange amount to 070<br />
million. Our drawing rights with the International Monetary Fund total<br />
$ 630 million. Therefore, our total first and second line reserves is 700<br />
million. On a longer view, our balance of payments prospects are highly<br />
promising. Our capacity to produce for export is growing rapidly. Developments<br />
In mineral production will add greatly to our export earnings. Our<br />
export capacity is also being enlarged in other directions, and import saving<br />
production is increasing.<br />
We do not foresee any drastic reversal in the general level of<br />
capital inflow from abroad.<br />
It has been said that, by maintaining the value of the Dollar, we<br />
appreciated our currency. The truth is we neither appreciated nor devalued it.<br />
Since 1948, the Pound value of our currency in relation to other<br />
currencies has been established with the International Monetary Fund as<br />
have the Pound values of most other national currencies outside the Communist<br />
world. Most other countries took the same decision. They decided to<br />
stay where they were.<br />
What happened was that the United Kingdom was forced Into a<br />
devaluation of her currency because of a crisis in her balance of payments and<br />
her domestic economy. The leading trading nations of the world, including<br />
Australia, had no substantial reason to change.<br />
There was no crisis in our balance of payments or in our<br />
domestic economy. There is none now.<br />
Devaluation for Australia at this stage would have brought costs<br />
and penalties. It would have meant we would have had to pay more for our<br />
Imports and, in our case, imports mean, very largely, materials for<br />
production and capital equipment. To add to their costs means adding to<br />
costs through industry, Including export industry.<br />
Furthermore, it could have set inflationary forces moving. It<br />
could have provided grounds for higher wage rates and for support to industries<br />
afflicted with excessive costs. / 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
These things we did not want to happen. V" e have a valuable<br />
reputation for stability and for good management of our economic affairs.<br />
have no intention whatever of impairing that reputation.<br />
It has been suggested that we face a massive inflow of cheap<br />
British goods competing with our own manufactures. This does not stand the<br />
test of facts today. There will be changes in Britain which bear directly on her economy<br />
and on the extent of her new ex: port potential. Sterling costs of Britain's<br />
imports will rise. Corporation tax is being increased from 40 per cent to<br />
42 per cent. Export and selective employment tax rebates for most<br />
manufacturers will be abolished. These alone, it is estimated, could add<br />
7 per cent to British costs. There is little doubt too, there will be increases<br />
in wage costs as time goes on.<br />
The United Kingdom does not have a great deal of surplus capacity<br />
for production, and her work-force is more or less constant. To raise export<br />
production, resources will have to be shifted from other industries, and this<br />
will take time. Our assessment here is that the United Kingdom will concentrate<br />
its export drive on North American and continental markets. We take only<br />
about 5 per cent of Britain's total exports, and it is reasonable to expect that,<br />
of any additional exports she builds up, only about that proportion will find<br />
their way into Australia.<br />
In any case, some 70 per cent. of our imports from Britain<br />
come in free of duty, which indicates that largely they represent goods of<br />
various kinds which are not produced here.<br />
There was no sound nor obvious justification for devaluation. Had<br />
we done so we would have struck at the confidence which other countries have<br />
acquired in the stability of Australia, and could have compromised our<br />
prospects of attracting a continuous and increasing capital inflow.<br />
The question has been raised whether the International Monetary<br />
Fund would have approved an Australian devaluation. Under the rules of the<br />
Fund, members must secure approval for any variation in their currency values.<br />
To support a claim for a change, it is necessary to establish a<br />
chronic external imbalance which shows no reasonable prospect of correction<br />
by increased exports or by reduced imports, or by the imposition of tolerable<br />
domestic measures. We were not and -are not in a state of economic ill-health, V7e<br />
did not seek approval from the Fund for devaluation. We had no case to make for<br />
devaluation, but we did have confidence in the strength of our own currency and<br />
the capacity of our economy and the Australian people to adjust to change.<br />
Nevertheless, the Government is conscious that certain industries,<br />
which still depend largely on selling their products in Britain, could be adversely<br />
affected. It was apparent that since the impact would vary from industry to<br />
industry, creating a different set of problems for each, the right course would<br />
be to study their problem intensively and decide what measures would be<br />
necessary in each particular case. / 4, </p>
<p>7<br />
.8 The Government is doing this now. Until results of Its<br />
current industry consultaticas cnnbe weighed, Cabinet will not decide what<br />
new machinery, if any, is necessary to give effect to the Government<br />
policy, already announced, of giving special assistance in those areas<br />
where industry may suffer directly because of the British decision to<br />
devalue. There have been, since the decision on 20th November, a<br />
series of talks with industry groups, departments and marketing boards.<br />
There is a good deal of information coming from overseas which also has<br />
to be weighed in our conclusions am to the future course of action.<br />
What has been done by the Government has been designed<br />
directly and deliberately to protect the strength of the Australian Dollar.<br />
This is fundamental to the soundness of our economy and or prospects for<br />
continued expansion. We are satisfied we made the right decision on every<br />
count.<br />
