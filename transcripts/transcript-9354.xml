    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am very pleased to announce that the Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea, Sir Julius Chan, will be making a working visit to Australia from 13-14 September. It will be Sir Julius's first visit to Australia since being elected Prime Minister on 30 August.</p>
<p>I am delighted that Sir Julius has been able to take up my invitation to visit Australia. That he has chosen to do so so soon after assuming the Prime Ministership reflects the importance he attaches to the bilateral relationship. I will, of course, be reaffirming to him the importance Australia attaches to relations with Papua New Guinea and the warm regard Australians have for his countrymen and women.</p>
<p>Australia has a close and multifaceted relationship with Papua New Guinea and I look forward to discussing with Sir Julius recent developments in the bilateral relationship.</p>
<p>We will also discuss the situation on Bougainville and, in particular, how Australia might assist the peace process. Sir Julius, both in the last few days and before as Foreign Minister, has played a leading role in advancing the cause of a peaceful long-term resolution to the Bougainville conflict and the Australian Government welcomes the leadership he has provided.</p>
<p>I will also be taking the opportunity to discuss with Sir Julius developments on APEC and on the outcomes of the recent South Pacific Forum meeting in Brisbane.</p>
