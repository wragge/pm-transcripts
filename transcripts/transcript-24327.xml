    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Government is today announcing it intends to sign a Memorandum of Understanding on the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), which would allow Australia to participate (as a prospective founding member) in negotiations to set up the bank.</p>
<p>The Government has discussed the AIIB extensively with China and other key partners inside and outside the region.</p>
<p>Good progress has been made on the Bankâs design, governance and transparency over the past few months, but we still have issues that we will address through ongoing consultations.</p>
<p>Key matters to be resolved before Australia considers joining the AIIB include the Bankâs Board of Directors having authority over key investment decisions, and that no one country control the bank.</p>
<p>Recognising the pressing need for infrastructure investment in the Asia-Pacific, Australia made infrastructure a priority during our G20 presidency in 2014.</p>
<p>Working with other key multilateral institutions such as the World Bank and the Asia Development Bank, the AIIB has the potential to play a valuable role in addressing infrastructure needs and boosting economic growth in the region with potential benefits for Australia.</p>
