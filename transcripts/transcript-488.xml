PAKISTANI HONOUR FOR AUSTRALIAN<br />
Statement by the Prin. e Minister, the Rt. Hon, h. G. Menzies<br />
I have much pleasure in announcing that the<br />
President of Pakistan ( Field Marshal Ayub Khan) has<br />
graciously conferred on Mr. B. C. Quayle, Assistant Parliamentary<br />
Draftsman, the high decoration of Sitara-I-Pakistan ( Star of<br />
Pakistan), in recognition of his services as consulting<br />
draftsman in the final revision of the new Constitution of the<br />
Republic of Pakistan.<br />
The Foreign Minister of Pakistan ( Mr. Manzur Qadir)<br />
asked the Attorney-General, Sir Garfield Barwick, in Rawalpindi<br />
a year ago for assistance of this kind, and Mr. Quayle recently<br />
spent some weeks in Pakistan.<br />
Mr. Qadir, who is understood to have been himself a<br />
principal author of the new Constitution, said last week in a<br />
public address that Mr. Quayle had " contributed a great deal in<br />
chiselling and polishing the language of the draft".<br />
The Attorney-General had been delighted to make<br />
Mr. Quayle's services available, in token of the close, ties of<br />
friendship and interest betvween Australia and Pakistan.<br />
ISSUED: CANBERRA,<br />
26th March, 1962. </p>
