STATEMENT FOR THE WERRIWA PRESS:<br />
1 AUS RAIIA1<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
1974 BUDGET LIVERPOOL HOSPITAL<br />
Campbelltown and Liverpool Hospitals should benefit<br />
from the 1974 Budget allocation of $ 28 million for public<br />
hospital facilities in the States.<br />
The Prime Minister and Member for llerriwa,<br />
Mr. Gough Whitlam said today that the Australian<br />
Government had decided to go ahead with a five year program<br />
of capital assistance for the provision, expansion and modernisation<br />
of public hospital facilities.<br />
" I anticipate that Campbelltown and Liverpool Hospitals<br />
will be able to speed up their development programs throucgh<br />
thleir share of the grant for 1974/ 75," he said.<br />
Mr. Whitlam estimated that total fed. eral assistance<br />
to public hospitals would exceed $ 650 million by 1978/ 79,<br />
the end of the five year period.<br />
The Budget allocation is a direct result of the<br />
Australian Government's decision to implement the recommendations<br />
of the Hospitals and Health Services Commission's " Report on<br />
Hospitals in Australia". This was tabled in Parliament on<br />
April 10 this year by the Minister for Health, Dr. Everingharn.<br />
The Report made recommendations on the provision of<br />
hospital facilities in Australia, and emphasised that health<br />
services should be organised on a regional basis so that people<br />
in each region would have access to comprehensive health care.<br />
In the Report, hospital facilities were taken to incluide general<br />
public hospitals, mental hospitals and other institutions<br />
offering alternative accommodation for patients such as<br />
nursing homes and hostels.<br />
Mr. Whitlam said that the Hospitals and Health Services<br />
Commission had as its objective " The provision of high-quality,<br />
readily accessible, reasonably comprehensive co-ordinated and<br />
efficient health and related welfare services at local, regional,<br />
State and national levels." He said that it has been clear for<br />
some years that not enough would be done to overcome deficiencies<br />
in our health services until the national Government assumed<br />
a greater responsibility for the provision of hospital and<br />
medical services throughout the nation. / 2 </p>
