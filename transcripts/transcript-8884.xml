E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
0: What do you want to do from here Mr Keating?<br />
PM: We will reserve our position and go back and think what response there<br />
should be. mhe States have said, Premier Kennett last night when this<br />
debate was proceeding quite well unilaterally told us that he wasn't<br />
having a bar of these points and that he would unilaterally legislate In his<br />
Parliament to validate the titles. I said, well if States believe they can<br />
validate the titles and pay the compensation after all you Issued the<br />
leases, you Issued the grants of Interest in land, If you can validate the<br />
titles and pay the compensation fine, do it.<br />
0: Do you believe they can?<br />
PM: It may be possible, but if you look In our text at page 25 we say the<br />
question needs to be addressed whether the failure to accord such<br />
procedural requirements to native title holders Is In breach of the Racial<br />
Discrimination Act. To validate the titles there are two things which have<br />
to happen. There has to be compensation paid, that is for the title to<br />
have been issued In a non-discriminatory way there had to be<br />
compensation paid and procedural fairness. There can not have been<br />
procedural fairness when no Aboriginal person would have been<br />
engaged largely In the Issue of these grants of Interests say 15, 10, 12<br />
years ago. The question Is whether and I think we have got another<br />
reference at page 48, if this is so then the actions to be taken now to<br />
validate past grants and which affect native title may need to conform<br />
with relevant procedural requirements, and It goes on Commonwealth<br />
legislation would be possible to adjust or remove the procedural<br />
requirement under the Racial Discrimination Act. Premier Kennett told </p>
<p>TEL: 10.3ur,. 93 17: 51 No. 024 P. 02/ 08<br />
2<br />
me last night that he had had legal advice that VIctoria, the Victorian<br />
Parliament could validate Victorian leases and that he would-carry the<br />
comsation, but of course the cost of compensation in Victoria would<br />
be Just miniscule compared to the cost of compensation In Western<br />
Australia or Queensland. So it was a Victoria first policy and everyone<br />
else later.<br />
0: Pri me Minister, how do you view Premier Courts claim that Western<br />
Australia Is a special case given the amount of land that is likely to be<br />
claimed.<br />
PM: A special case in what sense?<br />
0: He argues it Is a special case because of the amount of crown land and<br />
leases thagjpy be subject to Mabo style claims.<br />
PM: I don't follow his point there, special in what respect?<br />
0: For example the difference with Victoria was t the view was that they<br />
have managed to extinguish a lot of the native title should only have<br />
the same level of compensation..<br />
PM: That Is true and that is why I am sure a number of Premiers were<br />
somewhat taken aback by Premier Kennett's insistence that he could<br />
validate titles and pay compensation when they knew the costs of<br />
compensation could be very large.<br />
0: What do you think the effect will be of Mr Kennett's planned ations?<br />
PM: What he says he seeks to do is to validate the titles. Understand this<br />
these grants of Interests In land have been Issued by state land<br />
managers. If the States can validate the titles and pay the<br />
compensation so that the grants In interests have been validly Issued<br />
fine, but you have got to remember that the Commonwealth offered to<br />
pick up all the compensation and to validate the titles.<br />
Q0; Would you now impose on the States through Commonwealth legislation<br />
native title?<br />
PM: I sad in our proposal that the Commonwealth would legislate to<br />
establish a framework for the recognition, protection and management of<br />
native title and that the Commonwealth would establish tribunals which<br />
would operate in the absence of similar appropriate mechanisms In the<br />
States. In other words it a State was prepared to establish its own<br />
tribunal and after all land management is a State Issue so If the States<br />
establish tribunals that operated In accordance with the Commonwealth<br />
framework, that would be fine. But part of the proposal always was that<br />
the Commonwealth would establish a framework. </p>
<p>TEL: 10 Jun. 93 17: 51 No. 024 P. 03/ 08<br />
3<br />
0: could legislate to recognise native title, establish tribunals to award<br />
native tWte In the future?<br />
PM: I think the Commonwealth has that power.<br />
0: Will you use it?<br />
PM: Again, we have got to consider our position again. I know that Premier<br />
Kennett said to you that we were Insisting on a couple of issues what he<br />
calls beyond Mabo such as a national fund for land acquisition. You<br />
have got to understand this It Is only Aboriginal and Torres Strait<br />
Islander people who can demonstrate a connection with the land, a<br />
continuing association with the land who will succeed In a Mabo claim.<br />
For manyAorginal and Torres Strait Islander people they will receive<br />
no benefit frm the Mabo decision therefore for those disposessed of<br />
their land, unable to make a claim there needs to be another social<br />
justice package of land acquisition which has to be part of the spirit of<br />
the Mabo decision. Premiers Kennett and Court and others reject that,<br />
but the argument from them Is I'm sure to you that the Commonwealth<br />
would not agree with their proposals because of our Insistence on these<br />
extra Mabo positions. The reasons there was no agreement today is<br />
they would not accept the core proposition that the mechanisms had to<br />
be established to hear and award native tUte claims. They would not<br />
accept that proposition and so therefore there was no and could be no<br />
agreement.<br />
0: Mr Keating, what does the breakdown of this conference mean to the<br />
nation?<br />
PM: I think as I say in the statement Premiers Court and Kennett have got to<br />
explain to their communities and their business communities how when<br />
the Commonwealth has offered to validate these titles and pick up all the<br />
compensation they rejected the offer and how they believe they can<br />
bring certainty to these titles when in fact it was there and explain to the<br />
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people of this country why they<br />
won't accept the need to give effect to the High Court decision. The<br />
problem Is a number of Premiers take the view that the High Court<br />
doesn't make law and that there Is an executive over-ride on the part of<br />
governments available to us. A part of yesterday's discussion was<br />
about a wholesale extinguishment of native tite across the country, that<br />
States would simply legislate away native title across the whole of their<br />
States.<br />
0: Does the Inability to make any decision today send any message to the<br />
International business community? </p>
<p>JEL: 4<br />
PM: No, these questions of native title ailse In many countries and we have<br />
got a semninal decision here with the High Court made In June 1992 and<br />
we have got to come to termns wthIt I Indcated to the States and this Is<br />
a very key point; there Is nothing stopping a State Issuing a valid lease<br />
meeting the requirements of the Racial Discrimination Act for procedural<br />
fairness and compensation. There is nothing today stopping a State<br />
lands manager issuing a valid lease. What we are talking about is9 the<br />
past leases.<br />
0: Prime Minister when you talk about proposed legislation for a national<br />
framework, Is that to address native land title claims of the future still<br />
leaves a question mark over the 1975 to 1993 validation.<br />
PM: No, the proposition we put was an all encompassing one; to validate<br />
past leases, pick up the compensation, establish a mechanism for<br />
hearing 9T* tawarding native title now and provide a basis within which<br />
States can issue valid leases from here on.<br />
0: But you are talking now about the option of the Commonwealth<br />
legislating on its own.<br />
PM: No, I was asked that and I said we will consider our position but the<br />
Commonwealth was always going to legislate guidelines for the<br />
operation of State tribunals In the heawing and awarding of native title.<br />
Whether the Commonwealth now moves to unilaterally to a regime is a<br />
matter for us to decide.<br />
0: In your statement legislation to set the framework for the awarding<br />
of native title, what exactly does that mean, just a draft..<br />
PM: No, we will start the drafting process of drafting the framework<br />
legislation.<br />
0: Not necessarily legislate?<br />
PM: But not necessaily legislate.<br />
0: When will you continue to discuss this draft legislation?<br />
PM: This Is a matter for Premiers but there Is no point in Premiers telling me<br />
that their State communities don't accept the High Court decision as<br />
though I am supposed to take that as some sort of profound piece of<br />
political advice. Communities in thi's country have to accept the igh<br />
Court decision as I have to accept the High Court decision.<br />
0: Prime Minister, given that there Is no mechanism In place to recognise<br />
native title and the States In your account are refusing to do that how<br />

<p>TEL: 10. Jun. 93 17: 51 No .024 P. 05/ 08<br />
can there be any exploration or mining lease or be issued from this<br />
point on if it doesn't contravene the..<br />
PM: Because If a native title holder Is not established but a State wants to<br />
Issue a grant of Interest In land over a particular locality where native<br />
tWte may be claimed, States can advertise the fact in newspapers that<br />
they are Interested In awarding a grant of interest in land over a<br />
particular locality, they can write directly to a land council or to the<br />
people In the area, the Aboriginal people in the area who may have an<br />
Interest in the matter and advise them that they are considering issuing a<br />
grant and to speak with them about it and then make clear that the<br />
matter of compensation will be paid If and when a native title Is granted.<br />
That way a lease can be validly Issued and that is where the commercial<br />
Interest comes in, a lease can be validly Issued.<br />
0: no one ever establishes native title<br />
PM: No, no what I'm saying Is In the interim where a claim for native tite<br />
hasn't been heard or awarded provided that the State has followed a<br />
non-dIscrimInatory procedurally fair process of notification and is<br />
prepared later to arrange the compensation the two key points of<br />
procedural fairness and compensation are covered and therefore the<br />
grant of Interest In land can be validly issued.<br />
0: What do you think it will do to certainty in Victoria, Western Australia and<br />
perhaps New South Wales to go ahead with their own legislation to do<br />
validate past leases?<br />
PM: What would it do to certit?<br />
0: Yes.<br />
PM: Leasees would need to be certain that the legislation competently<br />
validated the leases.<br />
0: Are you going ahead, can they actually be certain of that?<br />
PM: Not entirely certain of that in termns of the advice the Commonwealth has<br />
had.<br />
0: In that case do you have the option then but to go ahead with your own<br />
legislation to prevent that sort of filleting off of the States?<br />
PM: No, we made It clear that In respect of say pastoral leases that If you<br />
have got a lease of 20 years which Is renewed every twenty years, so It<br />
might have been renewed five or six times over a one hundred year<br />
period that that sort of lease we would take it, that that type of lease<br />
extinguished the native title. But obviously a tease of say 10 or 15 years </p>
<p>TEL: 6<br />
over an alluvial gold deposit shouldn't necessarily extinguish the native<br />
tWte and It should be able to revive. We are looking at the principle of<br />
protection of native title for past leases distinguishing between the<br />
continuing type pastoral lease or the tourism lease from say a mining<br />
[ ewse.<br />
0: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: I don't know it may be If the States have been legally advised that they<br />
can validate the legislation, that they In fact can and pay the<br />
compensation because they Issued the leases and the grants of Interest<br />
In land In the first place; they are the land managers. So if the land<br />
manager can through its Pariament validate the leases and pay the<br />
compensation then I've got no problem with that.<br />
0: Don't youirf4ed accompanying Commonwealth legislation to make that<br />
compatible notwithstanding the Racial Discrimination Act..<br />
PM: Well that Is the Issue under question.<br />
0: Prime Minister, Isn't Mr Kennett virtually challenging the Commonwealth<br />
and all Aborigines to have a go at what he Is proposing now again in the<br />
High Court? He said to us here today that what he is putting up In his<br />
ten points on his legal advice Is within the finding of the High Court.<br />
PM:. State Premiers will say what their advisers tell them in terms of the law,<br />
what they believe to be their legal position anid that is up to Mr Kennett,<br />
but you have got to understand this about Victoria, most of Victoria<br />
native title Is extinguished by freehold title. This Is not true of New<br />
South Wales, Queensland, the Northern Territory and Western Australia<br />
and therefore the number arnd variety of leases which might have had a<br />
native title claim and which might have been issued invalidly to be<br />
validated by compensaion would leave a much smaller compensation<br />
bill in Victoria than any other State. So Mr Kennett's unilateral approach<br />
Is basically a beggar thy neighbour approach as far as the other States<br />
are concerned.<br />
0: Mr Keating, on the more social agenda and the reconciliation process do<br />
you think that some of the rhetoric that Premiers have used are divisive<br />
and does threaten to jeopardise the reconciliation process?<br />
PM: Leave my views about their approach to reconciliation process to one<br />
side. Having discussions about whether the High Court can make law<br />
and whether their States have the option of Ignoring a High Court<br />
decision Is taking us nowhere, absolutely nowhere. How do you deal<br />
with that sort of discussion? T1E0L:. Jun. 93 17: 51 No. 024 P. 06/ 08 </p>
<p>TEL: 7<br />
0: Do you regret you didn't talk with more the Premiers, so that sorm of<br />
them who appear not to have a greed understanding of the Issues might<br />
have had their minds around It..<br />
PM: Everyone understands the Issues, everyone understood the Issues I<br />
think, perfectly because for a start they have had their own advice, they<br />
have had extensive briefing papers, they have had our own paper which<br />
I think Is a very comprehensive and good document which the<br />
Commonwealth Ministenal Group has put much time Into as has our<br />
Officials Working Party and COAG Is an executive body; you come<br />
along to agree things. The reason you have a heads of Government<br />
meeting Is because officials can't agree things, so the Premiers and<br />
Chief Ministers turn up to agree things. The proposals we had said we<br />
will validate the titles, we will unexpectedly in their terms pick up the<br />
compensation which was never on the table, it was an offer from me to<br />
pick up tkheitompensation, but you must agree to a process of hearing<br />
and awarding native title and they say no.<br />
0: How much in compensation would It cost the Commonwealth?<br />
PM; That Is a matter for judgement<br />
0: ( Inaudible)<br />
PM: We will consider our position and I think the States will consider theirs.<br />
Yesterday this meeting went along with a reasonable degree of<br />
bonhomie with people trying to feel their way through the Issues and I<br />
was taking some of the Premiers who I felt were not certain of our<br />
approach through the issues, but as we wore making our way last night<br />
Premier Kennett uniliaterally said we are going our own way we will<br />
legisiate, we can fix the leases, we will extinguish native title and issue a<br />
statutory title where It suits uis arnd what do you think about that? And<br />
we sald we would think about It over night.<br />
0: How much ground had you given..<br />
PM: Nowhere In our proposals was the proposition that we would take up<br />
compensation for the past leases. That Is eighteen years of leases and<br />
as well as that I adjusted the terms under which State tribunals could<br />
operate Interfacing with the Commonwealth guidelines but provided that<br />
we set up tribunals to hear and award native tite then on a number of<br />
other issues I gave substantial ground but they wouldn't give any<br />
ground. That was the point. They w anted the Commonwealth to<br />
validate the leases and pay the money and they would agree to hear and<br />
resolve Issues ralsed by native title and would accept the High Court<br />
judgement In Mabo that there Is native title,<br />
0: Did you give away any particular rights.. T1EL.: Jun. 93 17: 51 No. 024 P. UrfUU </p>
<p>TEL: I0. Jun. 93 17: 51 No. 024 P. 08/ 08<br />
PM: Because we didn't agree to anything we didn't give anything away.<br />
0: But did you offer to the meeting that you already told the Aborigines<br />
there would be no absolute veto and under your proposal and also on<br />
the question of extinguishing you had given ground there to extend most<br />
native title revive after the future..<br />
PM: Most native title wouldn't revive, no, I was taking a contrary view that we<br />
had to protect native title and give it a revival, give It the possibilities of<br />
revival, that is co-existence of title. This was one of the points that they<br />
wouldn't accept.<br />
0: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: Even if a mine lasts sixty years, It Is better that native title reverts to the<br />
native title holder than have It extinguished.<br />
0: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: In the matters of principle I think that is true. I think the other Premiers<br />
and Chief Ministers would have come to the party if a package was<br />
coming together. Now on sort of nuances Maybe they would want some<br />
things corrected, but by and large pertaps other Premiers understood<br />
the Import of the package.<br />
Q: ( inaudible)<br />
PM; I said I was prepared to try and define It and of course that Is a very<br />
large subject, I mean mountain chains, chains of mounts can have<br />
cuitural significance to Aboriginal people so it is a matter which Is very<br />
broad, but there had to be a willingness to embrace the whole package.<br />
It was largely a good natured discussion, but that is beside the point.<br />
The point was that the States would not take any executive decisions.<br />
ends. </p>
