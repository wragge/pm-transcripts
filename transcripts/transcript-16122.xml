    <content><![CDATA[<p>Violence against women is difficult to talk about.</p>
<p>But for those who find it difficult, let us be clear  -  however uncomfortable it is to talk about, it is degrading and damaging to experience.</p>
<p>We often prefer silence to the confronting truth that nearly half a million Australian women have experienced violence from their partner or former partner.</p>
<p>Well, we can be silent no longer.</p>
<p>Because for too long, silence has been seen as tolerance.</p>
<p>This is just plain wrong.</p>
<p>And the time has well and truly come to turn this around.</p>
<p>As a nation, the time has well and truly come to have a national conversation  -  a public national conversation, not a private one  -  about how it could still be the case that in 2008 half a million Australian women could have experienced violence from their partner. </p>
<p>And the objective is to turn this terrible statistic around.</p>
<p>Because each of these statistics is a human face.</p>
<p>And it is my gender  -  it is our gender  -  Australian men  -  </p>
<p>that are responsible. </p>
<p>And so the question is: what are we going to do about it?</p>
<p>Analysis of Bureau of Statistics figures indicates that[1]:</p>
<p>     * In any year, nearly half a million Australian women experience physical or sexual assault by a current or former partner.[2]</p>
<p>     * One in three Australian women have experienced physical violence.</p>
<p>     * One in five Australian women have experienced sexual violence.[3]</p>
<p>     * Less than one third of all physical and sexual violence is reported to police.</p>
<p>     * Approximately 90 per cent of women who experience sexual assault do not access crisis support, legal help or other support services such as telephone helplines.</p>
<p>Violence against women is the great silent crime of our time.</p>
<p>It is the silence that makes it the most insidious.</p>
<p>Because it prefers the darkness. </p>
<p>Because if it stays in the darkness, it cannot be discussed, debated  -  let alone dealt with.</p>
<p>To begin with, we need to change the attitudes of Australian men.</p>
<p>From birth, it must be drilled into the conscious and the subconscious of all men that there are no circumstances  -  no circumstances  -  in which violence against women is acceptable.</p>
<p>There are no circumstances in which the threat of violence against women is acceptable. </p>
<p>There are no circumstances in which the thought of violence against women is acceptable.</p>
<p>That on violence against women, we have simple, clear policy in two words: zero tolerance.</p>
<p>That needs to be heard from every husband, every father, every partner.</p>
<p>From every celebrity. </p>
<p>From every business leader.</p>
<p>From every football player.</p>
<p>From every brick layer.</p>
<p>From every bus driver.</p>
<p>From every factory worker.</p>
<p>From every office worker.</p>
<p>From every lecturer.</p>
<p>From every teacher.</p>
<p>From every student.</p>
<p>And from every politician of every political persuasion.</p>
<p>And it needs to be heard in every place.</p>
<p>In our parliaments.</p>
<p>In our work places.</p>
<p>At our barbeques.</p>
<p>Violence against women needs to move from the great silence to be part of a continuing national conversation. </p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because we need to change the way many men think.</p>
<p>We need to change the way some boys think.</p>
<p>And that cannot be done in silence.</p>
<p>Before coming to office, we said we would implement a national strategy against violence and sexual assault.</p>
<p>That strategy includes three things:</p>
<p>     * supporting women who have been the victims of violence;</p>
<p>     * ensuring that the legal system is effective in handling cases of violence against women; and</p>
<p>     * ending the cycle of violence for future generations.</p>
<p>To develop this strategy, the Government has brought together a group of experts and community leaders - the National Council to Reduce Violence Against Women, chaired by Libby Lloyd, one of the driving forces behind the Australian White Ribbon Foundation.</p>
<p>I was pleased to be able to join the Council in June this year at its first meeting.</p>
<p>And I'm pleased to see so many Council members here tonight.</p>
<p>I'm looking forward to seeing and supporting the National Plan that the Council will be presenting to Tanya Plibersek, the Minister for the Status of Women.</p>
<p>I understand that the Council has now received 370 submissions from organisations and individuals contributing ideas to be included in the Plan.</p>
<p>Once finalised, the plan will allow the Government to pursue the most effective, evidence-based approach that can help prevent violence and assist women who are still its victims. </p>
<p>The truth is, we can't reduce violence against women unless we change the attitudes of future generations.</p>
<p>On their own, all the laws in the world can't stop violence against women unless there is a genuine change in the way that Australian men think.</p>
<p>If we are going to be effective in changing community attitudes we need a better understanding of those attitudes now, and how those attitudes change over time. </p>
<p>We need to understand how those views are formed, so that we can target our efforts towards the most effective measures that cultivate respect for women.</p>
<p>We know that men who tolerate violence towards women are more likely to perpetrate violence than those who do not.[4] </p>
<p>For example, some believe that violence can be excused in certain circumstances; that women sometimes "ask for it" or "deserve" violence; or, that violence is a trivial matter.</p>
<p>According to a Victorian study,[5] almost one in four people believe domestic violence can be excused if the perpetrator genuinely regrets what they have done afterward, or if the violence results from a temporary loss of control.</p>
<p>It's those attitudes that lie behind the continuing high incidence of violence against women.</p>
<p>We need to get to the bottom of those attitudes, and find the best way of changing them.</p>
<p>That's why I am announcing tonight that the Australian Government will invest up to $2 million in research and analysis of Australian community attitudes towards violence against women.</p>
<p>This project will be carried out in partnership with VicHealth, the Social Research Centre[6] and the Australian Institute of Criminology.</p>
<p>This research will help us to track changing community attitudes over time to give us the best evidence base for changing the attitudes of men.</p>
<p>This will help shape the practical recommendations of our National Plan for the future. </p>
<p>To change attitudes, young men need to grow up with positive role models in their communities.</p>
<p>During the election, the Government committed to a comprehensive high school education program to help young men and young women to develop respectful relationships.</p>
<p>I am pleased to announce tonight that at the start of next year, we will be testing several programs to measure their effectiveness in both schools and youth organisations.</p>
<p>One model that the Government is testing is the Victorian Centre Against Sexual Assault's Sexual Assault Prevention Program for Secondary Schools.</p>
<p>This is a program that engages the whole school community and helps all students and teachers to take responsibility for their part in preventing violence against women.</p>
<p>There are a number of very promising educative models operating across Australia that are building positive values and ethical relationships amongst young people.</p>
<p>These programs are a valuable contribution to the development of our National Plan.</p>
<p>The White Ribbon Foundation is also doing great work in providing positive community role models to challenge and change the attitudes of men and boys.</p>
<p>The Government has provided $1 million to extend the reach of White Ribbon Day educational activities into rural and regional communities, particularly in high schools.</p>
<p>One of the unique features of White Ribbon is how it has brought together such a diverse range of male leaders, from judges to football players to academics, media personalities, police and politicians.</p>
<p>Tonight's White Ribbon Ambassador Award is a way of recognising the excellent work of those ambassadors.</p>
<p>There are many people here tonight whom I know have made extraordinary contributions to the White Ribbon campaign.</p>
<p>But there can be only one winner, and he is a very deserving one.</p>
<p>I am pleased tonight to announce that the 2008 Winner of the White Ribbon Ambassador Award is Mark Burgess, CEO Police Federation of Australia.</p>
<p>Mark has been a White Ribbon Ambassador since 2004.</p>
<p>His long career in the NSW Police gave him a deep understanding of the brutal reality of violence.</p>
<p>But it is in his role leading the Police Federation of Australia since 2000 that Mark has provided such strong leadership to promote awareness and understanding of violence against women.</p>
<p>Mark's efforts are making a real difference among the 52,000 police officers who are on the front line in dealing with violence.</p>
<p>Mark has given enormously of his time and energies to this campaign, and he's always willing to help out more.</p>
<p>So I am delighted to be able to present Mark with tonight's Award and to support the excellent efforts of White Ribbon in making a difference to the lives of hundreds of thousands of Australian women.</p>
<p>The White Ribbon Foundation is an outstanding initiative  -  men and women coming together and saying that we cannot tolerate violence any more. </p>
<p>That we will not tolerate violence any more.</p>
<p>That the time has come as a culture, as a country and as a nation to draw a line in the sand, once and for all.</p>
