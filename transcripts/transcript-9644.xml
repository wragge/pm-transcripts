STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
MEMBERSHIP OF THE NATIONAL INFORMATION SERVICES COUNCIL<br />
I am pleased to announce the membership of the National Information Services Council<br />
( NISC). The establishment of the NISC implements a key recommendation contained in<br />
the final report of the Broadband Services Expert Group.<br />
The NISC has been established as a high-level discussion forum for broad policy issues<br />
associated with the development of the so-called ' information superhighway'. Its role<br />
will be to inform the policy debate in government, by encouraging input from members<br />
of the community, industry and relevant experts in the field. As with my Science and<br />
Engineering Council, the NISC will be an important source of non-government views on<br />
key issues.<br />
The new council which I will chair with the Minister for Communications and the Arts<br />
as deputy chair, will provide the Government with access to a range of views on<br />
marketplace developments, technical issues and community views on the opportunities<br />
and challenges that the evolving services and technologies will * present. There is<br />
considerable interest throughout Government on these issues and I expect that a number<br />
of my Ministers will also be involved in the discussions.<br />
The membership of the NISC comes from a broad range of areas community,<br />
industry, academia and government to encourage a comprehensive examination and<br />
wide-ranging discussion on the issues.<br />
A list of members is attached. Each person has been selected because of his or her<br />
expertise on issues associated with information services, and potential contribution to the<br />
discussions.<br />
The first meeting of the NISC will be held on 10 August and will focus on fiimdamental<br />
policy issues such as community access; the evolution of communications services and<br />
technologies; industry development; legal and community standards; and the international<br />
context and implications of new communications services and technologies.<br />
The establishment of the council is an important part of the Governent's plan to<br />
formulate a comprehensive national approach on information and communications<br />
services and technologies. It will play a valuable role by involving Government in<br />
discussion with the community and industry on the implications of the ' information age',<br />
emphasising its relevance to broader economic and social objectives. </p>
<p>The NISC is also a measure of this Government's commitment to the notion that we can<br />
harness the enormous potential of the information age to achieve a fairer, healthier,<br />
better educated and more productive society.<br />
