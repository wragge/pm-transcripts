The functions of the Board of Review, although primarily associated<br />
with income tax, have been extended to matters arising out of sales<br />

ASSESSMENT BILL, 1947-INSTALMENT SCALES.<br />
On 13th June, 1947, Mr. Chifley said-<br />
" Regulations under the Income Tax Assessment Act and the Social<br />
Services Contribution Assessment Act have been gazetted to-day.<br />
These regulations prescribe reduced scales of instalment deductions<br />
to be made by employers from the weekly salary or wages paid to<br />
employees on and after the 1st July, 1947. The reduced scales give<br />
effect to the reductions in income tax and social services contribution<br />
rcnntly paced by Parliament. </p>
<p>As in the past, one scale has been printed by the Taxation Dleparl.-<br />
ment to cover instalments for both income tax and social services contributions.<br />
Copies of this scale will be available to employers before<br />
1st July, 1947.<br />
Some variation has been made in the form of the printed scale to<br />
be used. In cases of employees with dependants, the scale at present in<br />
operation provides for instalments according to the number and class<br />
of. dependants maintained. In the new scale, the instalments for such<br />
empl. yees are varied according to the total amount on which rebate may<br />
be claimed by the employee in respect of dependants. This alteration<br />
will simplify the application of the scale by employers. A copy of the<br />
scale is attached.<br />
The regulations contain provisions which will enable farmers,<br />
businessmen and other taxpayers from whose income instalment deductions<br />
are not made, to obtain the benefit of the reduced incomne tax and<br />
, ocial services contribution rates in the provisional amounts payable by<br />
them in respect of the income of the year ending 30th June, 1948.<br />
" Normally, the provisional tax and contribution payable by such a<br />
taxpayer would be equal to the income tax and social services contribution,<br />
respectively, assessed for the financial year 1946-47. However, in<br />
view of the fact that the rates of income tax and social services contribution<br />
for the financial year 1947-48 will be lower than those for the<br />
financial year 1946-47, the regulations provide for a reduction in the<br />
provisional tax and contribution otherwise payable for the financial<br />
year 1947-48. Broadly, in cases where the taxpayer will be liable to<br />
both income tax and social services contribution, the reduction will le Is.<br />
in the Å 1 for each Å 1 of the taxable income derived by him during the<br />
year ending 30th June, 1947. In other cases, the reduction will be<br />
graduated up to a maximum of Is. in the Å 1 for each Å 1 of the taxable<br />
inconie derived by the taxpayer during the year ending 30th June, 1947.<br />
The regulations also prescribe the metals to which section 23 ( p)<br />
the Act shall apply. Section 23 exempts income derived by a<br />
bona fide prospector from the sale, transfer or assignment by him of his<br />
rights to mine for gold and for such metals and minerals as arc prescribed.<br />
The metals prescribed for the purpose of this provision are<br />
antimony, arsenic, beryllium, bismuth, cobalt, copper, mercury, molybdenuin,<br />
nickel, tin and vanadium."<br />

FISHING INDUSTRY.<br />
WHALING-AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRY.<br />
On 9th June, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br />
" On 20th November, 1945, Cabinet approved of proposals for Australian<br />
participation for whaling in the Southern Hemisphere. Since<br />
then an officer of the Fisheries Division of the Department of<br />
Post-war Reconstruction has attended an International Whaling </p>
<p>Conference. An inter-departmental conunittee, representing the<br />
Departments of the Treasury, Labour, Commerce, Supply and<br />
Shipping, Post-war Reconstruction and Repatriation has considered<br />
the general prospects of the industry. and particularly<br />
in the light of information received from Britain that the delivery<br />
of a factory ship would not ' be made until 1950 at the earliest.<br />
It was considered that Australia's initial entry into the industry<br />
should be through land stations and that, when they had been<br />
established and personnel trained, consideration could be given to<br />
pelagic operations.<br />
The Minister for Commerce ( Mr. Pollard) informed Cabinet to-<br />
( lay that the present position was that the building of a factory ship<br />
could not he completed until 1950 and that the proposal to secure a<br />
factory ship as part of Japanese reparations was being investigated by<br />
the Department of External Affairs but, even if aproved, there would<br />
he delay in delivery. It appeared that the Australian industry should<br />
be developed on shore-based operations from the New South Wales and<br />
Western Australian coasti and by pelagic operations based on Hobartthe<br />
latter being subject to personnel being trained at the land stations<br />
and prospects carefully checked.<br />
Cabinet decided to conmmence negotiations for the cingagcllent of<br />
a whaling expert."<br />
( For earlier references, please see No. 108, page 8; No. 110, page 14.)<br />
CZECHOSLOVAKIA. CREDIT.<br />
On llth June, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br />
" A credit of Å stg. 500,000 has been granted to the Government of<br />
Czechoslovakia through the Commonwealth Bank of Australia for the<br />
purchase of Australian wool. The period of the credit is one year.<br />
Repayment has been guaranteed by the Government of Czechoslovakia.<br />
. It is ! a condition of the agreement that Czechoslovakia will make cash<br />
purchases of Australian wool to a value at least equal to the amount of<br />
the guaranteed credit.<br />
" Before the war, Czechoslovakia was becoming an increasingly<br />
important buyer of Australian wool. It is considered that the credit<br />
will assist in the early re-establishment of the woollen industry in<br />
that country." DEFENCE.<br />
POST-WAR-UNITED STATES CO-OPERATION.<br />
On 11th June, 1947, the Minister for External Affairs ( Dr. Evatt)<br />
and the United States Ambassador ( Mr. Butler) said-<br />
The Commander-in-Chief of the United States Navy, Army and<br />
Air Forces in the Pacific area ( Admiral L. E. Denfeld) has had discussions<br />
with the Australian Government and service authorities on </p>
<p>7<br />
matters of mutual interest in the Pacific. The purpose of his visit was<br />
to ensure the continuance of the close co-operation between the United<br />
States and Australian services which existed through the war period<br />
and which contributed so much to victory in the Pacific.<br />
There is a practical identity of Pacific interests and excellent relationships<br />
existing between the United States and Australia. The discussions<br />
Admiral Denfeld has had with the Prime Minister ( Mr.<br />
Chifley), the MAinister for External Affairs, the Minister for the Navy<br />
( Mr. Riordan), and service authorities have covered mutual interests<br />
of the two countries in the Pacific, and it is natural that such discussions<br />
should be repeated from time to time. They are the natural<br />
outcome of the close association between the two Governments which<br />
characterized the war period and, being purely defensive in character,<br />
are completely in accord with the principles and purposes of the<br />
United Nations. The discussions during the last few days in Australia<br />
have been entirely successful from ail points of view."<br />
DEFENCE SOCIENTIFIC ADVISORY COMMITTEE.<br />
On 31st July, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br />

PRIMARY INDUSTRIES.<br />
EXPORTS TO BRITAIN-BRITISH POLICY.<br />
On 12th . June, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br />
The policy of the British Government on foodstuffs so far . as Austr:<br />
lia is concerned is to import the maximum quantities of basic foodtruffs.<br />
such as dairy products and meat, from us. Britain wants many<br />
othpr product. in addition to these basic lines including-<br />
IT! onlto pur chutney. apple butter, vilegar, bonox, vegemite, fruit juices,<br />
e mined meat and vegetables, canned steak and vegetables, canned rabbit, canned<br />
poultry, fricassee of poultry, fri,;-' nec of rabbit, fricassee of mutton, steak and<br />
kidney pudding. and irish stexx.<br />
: Britain do( s nor want certain foodstuffs in a processed form<br />
Ilc-ausicf sli prefers tine raw iaterials. She does not want plum pudlings,<br />
for instacce, from Australia, if she can obtain the flour, dried<br />
fruits and fats in bulk and use these items to the best advantage.<br />
Australia has been cognizant of the British Government's decision<br />
lto irstrict rlth import of certain processed and semi-luxury foodstuffs.<br />
It li; s beli tl.. policy of the British Ministry of Food to import food<br />
stiifs in pIarticnlar formns so that the Ministry may implement its rationig<br />
seljiinm. Kiinoing the position of Britain, the Australian Governmient<br />
hi,-nei'. and will continue to do, everything possible to shift<br />
the maxirinunl foodstuffs to Britain. The British import policy on food<br />
is the concern of tihe British Government.<br />
Australin has serious problems for tinned plate supplies and does<br />
not always desire to send goods in cans which can be exported in bulk.<br />
Australian exports to Britain of goods which are subject to import<br />
restrictionLs are not appreciable and make very little impression on the<br />
iquantity of foodstuffs required by the British Ministry."<br />
DAIRY INDUSTRY-CONTROL.<br />
On 2nd July, 1947, Mr. Chifley said-<br />
The Australian Dairy Produce Board was set up in October, 1924,<br />
, nil consists of seventeen members appointed under the Dairy Produce<br />
Export Control Act. The members comprise-<br />
Four producers. iine representatives of butter and cheese factories, two<br />
representatives of prdprietary and privately-owned butter and cheese factories,<br />
inc representative of the Australian Council of the Australian Institute of Dairy<br />
Factory Managers and Secretaries, and one representative of the Commonwealth<br />
Government. During the war, the board's activities were curtailed and under<br />
National Security Act regulations, control of . the industry was taken<br />
over in November, 1939, by a small committee vested with wide powers.<br />
Cabinet decided to-day that legislation be prepared to amend the<br />
Dairy Produce Control Act to provide for a board of twelve members,<br />
with a ' Government nominee as chairman; to be vested with such additional<br />
powers and functions as might be necessary in the light of circumstances<br />
now obtaining in the industry. It is proposed that, when<br />
the new legislation operates, National Security Act regulations will be<br />
withdrawn." </p>
<p>DAIRY INDUSTRY-MILK, SUBSIDIES.<br />
On 18th July, 1947, Mr. Chifley said-<br />
" A decision as to the future control of milk will be made by the<br />
Commonwealth Government in September, 1947. The decision to be<br />
made is whether the Commonwealth should take any further interest<br />
and step out, or whether control should be handed to a State or local<br />
authority. If subsidies are discontinued by the Commonwealth, that<br />
will mean substantial increases in milk prices to consumers. One of the<br />
Commonwealth's difficulties is that at places such as Hobart and Launceston<br />
there is no authority to which the Commonwealth can hand<br />
control." AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY-EXPORT CONTROLLED.<br />
On 3rd July, 1947, the Minister for Agriculture ( Mr. Pollard)<br />
announced that controls would be exercised over the export of essential<br />
agricultural machinery to ensure that the greatest possible volume<br />
would be available in Australia. Types involved were--<br />
Tractors, grain and fertilizer cu! tivator drills, and seed drills for cereal crops,<br />
header harvesters. rezaper threshers, reapers and hinders, hay balers, side delivery<br />
rakes, mowers and spare parts.<br />
Token overseas shipments would be permitted as the nucleus of trade<br />
must be preserved.<br />
AGRICULTURAL COUNCIL MEETING-DECISIONS.<br />
On S1st Jily, 1947, Mr. Pollard said that a meeting of Anstralian<br />
Agricultural Council had been held. Decisions were-<br />
3IARKETING O I-I; GS.-At its last meeting. cotincil adopted recotniimei( ldtioiis<br />
embracing the formation of the Australian Egg E. qualization Conmmittee Limited<br />
for the marketing of eggs. The Standing Conmnittee on Agriculture now<br />
reported that unless the neces-iry legislation could be passed in New South<br />
Wales and Victoria to enable the company to operate as from It January,<br />
1S! 48, there would he disorganization in marketing and a fall in prices. Dealing<br />
with the question of surplus funds from Commonwealth egg control, Council<br />
expressed the view that the Commonwealth Government should be informed that<br />
some portion of the fund should be distributed as working capital of tile Australian<br />
Egg Equalization Committee Limited.<br />
BABLEY.--Proposals for the future marketing of barley, previously agreed to<br />
by representatives of Victorian and South Australian Governments and growers,<br />
and trading interests in those States, were adopted by council. The proposals<br />
provide for marketing barley under a pool system operating under State legislation<br />
without any guaraniitee of price: growers in effect receiving the average<br />
return obtained by the pool. Council decided that draft legislation prepared by<br />
the South Australian Government be considered by a conference of Commonwealth.<br />
Victorian and South Australian legal officers and that the draft bill<br />
then be submitted to the Commonwealth Government for approval and preparation<br />
as a Commonwealth Bill. The measure is to cover marketing of barley in<br />
Victoria and South Australia and any other States prepared to participate.<br />
ToBAcco.-Council adopted a tentative outline of Commonwealth and State<br />
legislation embodying principles considered necessary for a tobacco marketing<br />
scheme. The proposals envisaged a central authority charged with appraising<br />
tobacco leaf submitted to it under complementary State legislation. It would be<br />
necessary for the States to invest the central authority with necessary powers to </p>
<p>11<br />
appraise Australian tobacco leaf and allocate leaf to manufacturers. The legislation<br />
would provide for a table of limits which would be used to appraise leaf<br />
and should prohibit transactions except in accordance with the requirements of<br />
State Acts.<br />
POTArOEs.-Council noted that the Commonwealth had decided to continue<br />
the contract system with potatoes to cover the 1947-48 crop. The area desired<br />
was 185,000 acres calculated to give production sufficient to supply the population<br />
of Australia with 2j lb. of potatoes a week throughout the year with a margin<br />
of safety. It was proposed to allocate the area for 1947-48 as follows:-New<br />
South Wales-31,533 acres; Victoria-66,347 acres; Queeneland-17,735 acres;<br />
South Australia-7,880 acres; Western Australia-7,823 acres; Tasmania-<br />
54,149 acres; Total-185,467 acres.<br />
Basic price for best varieties of No. 1 grade was being raised from Å 12<br />
to Å 13 10s. a ton to cover increased costs arising from the removal of the subsidy<br />
on cornsacks and other increases. Council was informed that the existing<br />
scheme would not be extended after the season ending 1948 and stressed the<br />
necessity for all State legislation to be ready for operation before that date.<br />
SOIL CONSERVATION.-Council decided that, recognizing the importance of rye<br />
corn in soil conservation in Australia, immediate steps should be taken to build<br />
up in the Commonwealth a comprehensive collection of the world's rye corn<br />
varieties. Council recommended that a duly stubble mulch farm machine set be<br />
imported and made available to the New South Wales Conservation Service for<br />
testing as to efficiency.<br />
FERTITIzaER.-Council adopted recommendations from the conference of Commonwealth<br />
and State fertilizer officers as follows:-<br />
Sulphate for 1947-48 would be allocated to each State in the same proportion<br />
as in 1946-47.<br />
Nitrate of soda for 1947-48 would be allotted as follows:-New South Wales-<br />
1,100 tons; Victoria-1,100' tons; Queensland-2,000 tons: South Australia-<br />
450 tons: Western Australia-1,000 tons; Tasmania-350 tons; Total--6,000<br />
tons. Superphosphate supplies would be similar to the 1946-47 period-1,250,000<br />
tons. Potash supplies would be ample through commercial channels. Accordingly<br />
, upplies would not be allocated between the States for 1947-48.<br />
INSECT PEST CONTROL.-Council agreed to recommendations by the Standing<br />
Committee on Agriculture that a trial plan against plague locusts be undertaken<br />
in New South Wales.<br />
STocK DlsEASEs.-Recommentdations to council . by a conference of Commonwealth<br />
and State veterinary officers on control of stock diseases were approved<br />
as follows:-In view of the serious position developing in connexion. with ayian tuberculosis,<br />
poultry slaughtering should be subject to inspection under<br />
veterinary control in all States.<br />
Tuberculosis-free herd schemes should be uniform. Schemes in operation<br />
in New South Wales and Victoria, with agreed amendments to be accepted<br />
as a guide.<br />
Disease of Poultry.-Pullorum-free flock schemes were desirable in each<br />
State and those in operation should be used as a basis by States preparing<br />
echemes. An organized investigation into Birdsville and other related diseases of<br />
horses be conducted by the Council for Scientific and Iudustrial Research in<br />
conjunction with the Departments of Agriculture of Queensland, South<br />
Australia and Western Australia and the Northern Territory Administration.<br />
In the event of private institutions preparing living canine distemper<br />
virus vaccine, it should be controlled by requiring it to be issued only to<br />
veterinary surgeons.<br />
As penicillin was widely required for the treatment of bovine mastitis<br />
and other diseases, any restrictions on the issue of penicillin for veterinary<br />
use should be abolished. </p>
<p>VEGETABLE OIL PLA. NTS.-Council was informed by the Standing Committee onl<br />
Agriculture that it had considered the report of the Commonwealth mission<br />
which visited the United States in 1946 to inquire into the soybean industry:<br />
The committee informed council that it had accepted recommendations as<br />
fnllows:-Commonwealth and State Governments should take energetic action to<br />
promote the economic production of vegetable oil plants in Australia.<br />
The Commonwealth and States should set up a Vegetable Oils Committee<br />
to recommend broad policy on vegetable oil production to the council. Funds<br />
should be made available to undertake an intensive programme of plant<br />
breeding and selection and testing of soybeans and the vegetable oil producing<br />
plants appropriate to their environment.<br />
The Council for Scientific and Industrial Research should undertake investigation<br />
into the industrial uses of vegetable oils. To allow manufacturers to<br />
exploit the possibilities of soybean oil, permits be issued for the importation<br />
of soybeans. MIGRATION.<br />

FURTHER AMENDED.<br />
On 13th June, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br />
The Executive Council has approved a further re-organization of<br />

of remuneration at an altered rate where the alteration is consequential<br />
on a reduction in working hours made under any State Act coming into<br />
force after to-day."<br />

THE GOVERNMENT.<br />
POLICY-PRIME MINISTER'S SPEECH, JUNE, 1947.<br />
On 15th June, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said*-<br />
The Labour party is the greatest political party to-day that Australia<br />
has ever known and the only political party that proved, in the<br />
years of war, capable of governing this country. The Labour party at<br />
. uch conferences as this voices its views and discusses not only internal<br />
problems but also gives some thought to international problems associated<br />
with the life of this nation.<br />
I feel that the work of the Labour movement in New South Wales<br />
and in the federal sphere during the past six years is not a story I need<br />
reiterate. .1 do not say that there have not been some shortcomings.<br />
am one, privileged as I have been to lead the Federal Parliamentary<br />
Labour party, who realizes that in the life of a government there are<br />
some things that call for criticism. Criticism is not a bad thing, but I<br />
rhink criticism should be based on facts and should be directed, not<br />
towards individuals particularly, but. generally towards the methods<br />
used. " Now, after six years in which the people have trusted the Labour<br />
party in the federal sphere and in a majority of States, we are faced<br />
with an equally grave responsibility, although not in the atmosphere of<br />
danger and war nor with the same difficulties. But we face a re-orientation<br />
of some of the views on some of the problems. We can fact our<br />
internal problems in an atmosphere of full employment and a better<br />
standard of living than in most countries to-day. We live in a very<br />
troubled world. Grent economic problems face other countries to-day.<br />
Europe is in a very bad way and many persons feel frustrated and disappointed<br />
that leading men of the world cannot find solutions to great<br />
At the inn! conferuce of trhe New S uth W le brh: inich tih A.\ Istrahm;<br />
.; iahour p; ir y. </p>
<p>problems which beset the world and set a road of guidance for the<br />
future. That is because countries hold such widely diverse views of<br />
what should be the methods and what guidance should ' be given.<br />
Australia can look at the problems very clearly. Great opportunities<br />
and the fulfilment or the achievement of the matters that those<br />
opportunities offer rests with the people in Australia-the Government<br />
can legislate and provide machinery.<br />
In the Pacific, Australia is an isolated island continent, but it<br />
c: an no longer stay out of the affairs of the world or for protection in<br />
defence depend on Britain. The economic problems which beset Britain<br />
to-day have left her in a position in which she must look to the<br />
Dominions to play a great part in maintaining stability and security.<br />
' This country, which is young and a country I hope which will grow<br />
to greater proportions offered opportunities and the Labour party is the<br />
only political party capable of governing the people and giving effect<br />
to their wishes.<br />
Those opportunities must not be lost. First, we must face the<br />
problem of bringing here hundreds of thousands of people from other<br />
countries. If British people are available so much the better, hut manpower<br />
in Britain is much needed to-day, so we must turn to Europe<br />
for hundreds to build up this country. We must determine the best<br />
methods to build Australia and fulfil our destiny. Because of isolation.<br />
we are far from the stress and strife in Europe. We ' have sonime reasonable<br />
stability. The efforts of the Government have been able not only<br />
to . meet the effects of war, but also the transition to peace. Some persons<br />
believe that because there is prosperity-because there are more<br />
jobs than people to fill them, because there are high prices from overseas<br />
exports-that that particular state of affairs, particularly in<br />
regard to prices, might last for ever. We must be prepared, in giving<br />
consideration to our economic affairs, for a reduction in those prices. It<br />
is possible that some measure of decline will come in the market before<br />
many years are passed. We must, in planning the economy of this<br />
country, realize that there is . likely to be some recession in the money<br />
coming to this country from our exports.<br />
In the world of interna. tional affairs, Australia has played a great<br />
part. It has participated in all the councils of the nations of the world.<br />
The Minister for External Affairs ( Dr. Evatt), the Australian High<br />
Commissioner in the United Kingdom ( Mr. Beasley), the Australian<br />
Minister at Washington ( Mr. Makin) and the Australian High Commissioner<br />
to Canada ( Mr. Forde)-all representatives of the Labour<br />
movement-have played their part in seeing that Australia has been<br />
heard. We cannot any longer depend on Britain for the defence of this<br />
country. There may be a feeling of frustration that so little has been<br />
achieved so far towards a lasting peace, but there can be no mistake in<br />
the minds of people that there shall be an improved living standard<br />
and their objective is to achieve by some means or other some peace for<br />
the workers of the world. </p>
<p>" Internally, we are living in a period of full employment. That<br />
has been one of the ideals of the Labour movement, but for the first time<br />
in my association with the Labour movement we have achieved that<br />
object. There must be no faltering in the Federal or . State Labour<br />
parties to ensure that that condition of affairs is maintained and, of<br />
course, to maintain the standard of living of the people. That does not<br />
rest with politicians and it does not rest with parliaments; it rests<br />
with the trade unions and the workers of this country. Unless they<br />
are prepared to play their part and give to the nation and to the<br />
community the very best that they can give, those objectives cannot be<br />
achieved. " I say that the trade union movement owes not only a duty to their<br />
own organizations, but a duty to the community in which they live and<br />
the nation to which they belong. I hope that leaders in the trade union<br />
movement will be inspired in their efforts to see that some of the<br />
industrial troubles which arise will be reduced. I understand that<br />
strikes prove a corrective for many injustices. I can understand an<br />
industrial stoppage on principle, but there have been a. number of<br />
stoppages during recent years not connected with such matters. There<br />
have been stoppages in connexion with demarcation disputes-not disputes<br />
with Governments but dispute among the workers. It" is shocking<br />
that trade unions in a matter of demarcation are not prepared<br />
to take it to a judicial authority. They are like a comic opera and<br />
persons working together who create these situations are not working<br />
for the common good.<br />
" I make it very clear that you should take from these conferences<br />
through the country the realization that this is not a movement<br />
organized for the glorification of its leaders or trade union leaders, but<br />
for the benefit of the people and workers of the country. Personal animosities<br />
cannot be avoided, but whatever they are they have to be subjugated<br />
to the great masses of the people. I ask you to infuse the fire<br />
and spirit which characterized the pioneers of the Labour movement<br />
into the hundreds and thousands throughout the country and see that<br />
Labour is returned to power.<br />
There are persoins who try to cling to the coat-tails of the Labour<br />
movement to espouse philosophies which are not philosophies of the<br />
Labour movement. I say that this is a country of freedom of expression<br />
and freedom to establish any political philosophy, but let those persons<br />
preach their philosophy from their own platform. The Labour movement<br />
lives and achieves the ideals and aspirations of the great working<br />
class persons of this country. The working class consists of men<br />
and women who work, whether manually or otherwise, for the country<br />
and give of their best in their daily toil, whatever that may be.<br />
The Labour party is unique among political parties because in<br />
six States it has its organizations. Men come from 4,000 miles apart<br />
who bring to that Federal Parliamentary Labour party many diverse<br />
views. It is no easy matter to cater for the many parts of Australia<br />
in federal policy, and that is done by federal conference and translated </p>
<p>into action by the Federal Labour party. It is a great achievement for<br />
a party to create such solidarity as that. There is only one way to<br />
achieve such things, whatever personal feelings we have, and that is by<br />
solidarity. The history of this and every country shows that the people<br />
will not trust parties who are not able to govern themselves and trust<br />
only parties who have ways and methods of achieving their objective.<br />
T think it does no harm to the Labour party or trade union movement<br />
( which forms the foundation of the Labour party) when criticism is<br />
levelled from time to time provided the criticism is based on facts. We<br />
do not wish to live in a mutual admiration society. I have in my party<br />
over 70 federal members drawn from all parts of Australia. It is not<br />
to be expected that they will agree on every proposal or be able to<br />
: gree with one another always. They always agree on objectives, but<br />
sometimes nor on the methods to achieve those objectives. That doe.<br />
not harm the Labour movement. No party can live unless it is progressive<br />
and pressing forward. It must go onwards or die. The con-<br />
: servative parties of this country, because of the diverse interests and<br />
animositie. which exist between persons opposed to Labour methods,<br />
are not able to survive. The solidarity of this movement, particularly<br />
in the war period, was the solidarity necessary for the welfare and preservation<br />
of this country.<br />
In regard to international affairs, our relations with other countries,<br />
our defence policy and the building up of industries are some<br />
, f the great problems only Labour governments are capable of solving.<br />
Relations with other nations of the world must go through the Federal<br />
Government. The Federal Labour party should know the feelings and<br />
v. iews of the people we represent. Out of these conferences you will<br />
give an indication to the Federal Labour party of your outlook on the<br />
questions of the future. I do not think that some persons in Australia<br />
fully realize the changed order in the world to-day. We have a proud<br />
history, but we must not live in the past. The methods of 20 years<br />
ngo are no good to-day. We live in a troubled world. We must be<br />
prepared to keep to the fundamentals of the Labour party, but always<br />
be prepared to modify the general outlook of our views on the affairs<br />
of the world and, in turn, on our own affairs as the affairs of the world<br />
affect us. We have to prepare to build a stronger nation in the Pacific<br />
than to-day, and try to look into the future. Many think just of to-day<br />
or just a year or two ahead. They feel that some particular features<br />
affect them personally and that they are the only ones that matter.<br />
I ask those persons to give some thought to overseas affairs and the<br />
future of this country. We must keep ourselves in close contact with<br />
the affairs of the world and in close contact with other nations. I<br />
believe that only by close co-operation with the people of Great<br />
Britain and the people of America-indeed, with the English-speaking<br />
peoples of the world-can -we keep world peace in the future.<br />
" It may be that the Australian Government has had differences<br />
with Great Britain on administrative matters. Whatever those differences<br />
and however justifiable, one fact is completely clear-we in the </p>
<p>Pacific must maintain a close co-operation not only with America but<br />
with Great Britain. Regarding Great Britain, apart from sentimental<br />
reasons, a great material factor applies. Great Britain has been the<br />
greatest market for Australian primary product exports, and if only for<br />
material reasons close co-oppration with Great Britain for trade is<br />
essential. " It is a great thing in the Labour movement to feel that we take<br />
in thousands of unions and branches. Men and women are working<br />
for no reward to themselves ' but to give effect to the wishes of the Labour<br />
movement. It is a great thing and a great comfort for any one leading<br />
a party or associated in some task of leadership of a party to know<br />
that these men and women support them. I know that in Australia<br />
hundred. of thousands have been in the Labour movement for 30 or<br />
years without seeking any reward for themselves but for the Labour<br />
movement to be placed in power. The future of this country and the<br />
future of the Labour movement rest with the people themselves. Every<br />
oC e must bhe prepared, whatever be his calling, whatever his duty, in<br />
this timc. of opportunities, to give of his very best. There is only one<br />
way of achieving success and that way is hard work. I ask nothing<br />
more of the movement but to stick solidly together. It has been trusted<br />
lby the peophl to perform the great tasks connected with the problems<br />
of the war and to carry on the tasks associated with the transition into<br />
peace and plan for the years ahead. That is the great trust the people<br />
have placed in us. and I ask the Labour movement to give to those<br />
chosen to lead all the help that cun be given for the needs of the community<br />
and the needs of the nation. By that means can the Labour<br />
movement remain great. If that is done, I have no fear that the<br />
Labour movement will go on growing stronger, and greater, in the<br />
interests of Australia."<br />

CONVERSION LOAN.<br />
NEW YORK OPERATION, JUNE, 1947.<br />
On 15th June, 1947, the Prime 11inister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br />
A Commonwealth loan has been issued in New York for 38,000,000<br />
dollars to pay off a Commonwealth 5 per cent. loan that matures in<br />
1957, but over which an option of redemption is being exercised.<br />
The terms of the new loan provide for a coupon rate of 31 per<br />
cent. for ten years as to 19,000,000 dollars and -a coupon rate of 31 per<br />
cent. for 20 years as to 19,000,000 dollars, the issue price to the public<br />
in both cases being 974 per cent. The yield to the investor in the case<br />
of the 31 per cent. bonds will be Å 3 11s. 1d. and for the 3 per cent.<br />
bonds Å 3 13s. 7d.<br />
The new loan will result in a ; aving of interest to the Commonwealth<br />
and to the Governments of Victoria, Queensland, South Australia,<br />
Western Australia and Tasmania."<br />
NEW YORK OPERATIONS, 1946-47.<br />
On 14th July, 1947, Mr. Chifley said-<br />
In July, 1946, Australia commenced to refinance American loans<br />
for which there was an option of redemption before maturity dates.<br />
Total loans raised by the Commonwealth and the States in respect of<br />
which amounts were outstanding at 30th June, 1946, amounted to<br />
200,000,000 dollars, of which there was an option of redemption by<br />
September, 1947, of 128,000,000 dollars. The summary of operations<br />

" The first three operations were highly successful, the amount<br />
underwritten being promptly absorbed by investors. </p>
<p>" The last operation has not sold as promptly as the previous issues,<br />
due to a variety of reasons, the factors chiefly responsible being the<br />
disturbed international situation. Whereas honds were underwritten<br />
for the full amount, the underwriters were left with 2,000,000 dollars<br />
of the short term and 6,500,000 dollars of the long term when the loan<br />
closed on 8-th July, 1947. Sales of these securities in large parcels<br />
resulted in a heavy fall on the market. At the close of business on 11th<br />
July, 1947. only -2,( iOO, 000 dollars of the long term issue was<br />
unplaced, the whole of the short term having been sold. The short<br />
term arc selling at approximately 96 dollars and the long term at<br />
94 dollars. Total interest saving over aill operations for the abovementioned<br />
loans is about' 2,000.000 dollars a year.<br />
" There will be no further operations by the Commonwealth on<br />
the New York miarket before 1952."<br />
WHEAT STABILIZATION SCHEME.<br />
POST-WAR--FEDERATION PROPOSAL.<br />
On 19th June, 1947, the Minister for Agriculture ( Mr. Pollard),<br />
said that representatives of the Australian Wheat Growers Federation<br />
from New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia had placed<br />
proposals before him for amendments to the Government's five years<br />
wheat stabilization plan. The federation asked that the guaranteed<br />
floor price for wheat be based on the cost of the production, which would<br />
include a remunerative wage for the grower and interest on capital<br />
involved. It asked that the price of wheat for local consumption<br />
as flour should be based on a cost plus principle, subject to immediate<br />
and periodic review and adjustment in accordance with fluctuations in<br />
cost. TJhe federation's request that the plan should not begin until the<br />
marketing of the crop subsequent to its proposed amended plan coming<br />
into effect would mean that the present plan as it affected 1945-46<br />
and 1946-47 crops would be abandoned. It might also require the<br />
abandonment of the stabilization plan in respect of the 1947-48 harvest,<br />
because it was likely that time would not permit the Commonwealth<br />
and the States to pass legislation through the respective Parliaments in<br />
time to make it apply to that harvest.<br />
He had told the deputation that if the Government was to go on<br />
with stabilization it could be expected that when prices for wheat were<br />
high growers should provide some reserves for periods when prices were<br />
low. If they did so. the Government was prepared to back the plan's<br />
operation. It could not exclude from the operation of the plan the<br />
harvest marketed when prices, as at present, were abnormally high.<br />
The Government would be prepared, however, to consider an extension<br />
of the plan be-' yond the 1949-50 harvest. The present Act would enable<br />
that to, be donne provided State Governments were agreeable. He would </p>
<p>consider recommending to the Government that the present plan. be<br />
extended for two years with provision that a review be made during<br />
the period to determine whether it should be extended for a further<br />
three years, making ten years in all.<br />
POST-WAR PRODUCTION COSTS, INQUIRY.<br />
On 4th July, 1947, Mr. Pollard said-<br />
" The chairman of the Wheat Costs of Production Committee<br />
informs me that over 3,000 questionaires were issued at random to<br />
wheat farmers and that only 250 have been completed and returned.<br />
I have informed the committee that I would not ask it to make a<br />
report if it were of the opinion that the facts before it were not sufficient<br />
to give a true picture of the industry. I ask wheat-growers to fill. in<br />
the questionnaires and return them without delay."<br />

ACREAGE-1947-48.<br />
On 29th July, 1947, Mr. Pollard said that Australian wheat sowings,<br />
which had declined heavily during the war, had now appreciated, and<br />
for 1947-48 the acreage sown would be 15,500,000 acres, compared with<br />
: in average of 13,303,000 acres during the 10 years prior to the war.<br />

On 21st June, 1947, the Minister for Labour ( Mr. Holloway) said<br />
that at 23rd May, 1947, 135,648 ex-service personnel had either begun<br />
training, completed training, or had been placed in employment as<br />
per cent. efficient and were completing their training on the job, or<br />
were still carrying on their training in the training centres under the<br />
Commonwealth Reconstruction Training Scheme.<br />
WAR SERVICE MORATORIUM-EXTENSION.<br />
Oni 2nd July, 1047, the Prime Ministf-r ( Mr. Chitley) said-<br />
" National Security ( War Service Moratorium) Regulations give<br />
l&gt; ecial rights and protection in tenancy matters to protected persons'<br />
The most important protection is a provision that a tenant who is a<br />
' protected person cannot be evicted unless the lessor can show that<br />
suitable alternative accommodation Ls or has been available to the tenant.<br />
discharged member of the forces is a protected person<br />
SCabinet decided to-day that the period of p: ruotrion muder the<br />

without the consent of the Attorney-General. Cabinet decided to-day<br />
that the period of protection to discharged member. of the forces he<br />
ixtended from one year to two years." </p>
<p>RETURNED FROM ACTIVE SERVICE BADGE.<br />
On 17th July, 1947, Mr. Chifley said-<br />
" When the badge was introduced in 1941 it \ was laid down<br />
that it would be issued at the time of discharge or, in the cast,<br />
of the Royal Australian Navy, at the cessation of hostilities:<br />
Recently it has been represented that eligible serving members<br />
of the forces who may be permitted to wear civilian clothes were at<br />
a disadvantage by comparison with discharged members because they<br />
were not in possession of the appropriate emblem denoting their having<br />
participated in active service. It has been decided that the authority<br />
under which eligible personnel who are still serving in the Royal<br />
Australian Navy may be issued with the ' Returned from Active<br />
Service' badge shall be extended to apply to eligible serving members<br />
of the Australian Military Forces and the Royal Australian Air Force."<br />
PEACE.<br />
JAPAN-WHALING EXPEDITION.<br />
On 2sird June, 1947, the Minister for External Affairs ( Dr. Evatt<br />
said-On 7th August, 1946, the Japanese Government was authorized<br />
by S. C. A. P. to undertake a whaling expedition to the Antarctic during<br />
the 1946-47 season. Principal reasons given for the authorization were<br />
. hortage of food in Japan and world shortage of oils and fats. There<br />
was no prior consultation with interested Allied Governments, such as<br />
\ nstralia, Britain, New Zealand and Norway.<br />
The Australian Government immediately made strong representations<br />
to the United States on grounds of past prejudicial action by<br />
Japanese ships to Australian security, on earlier violations by the<br />
Japanese cf international whaling regulations, and on the inefficiency<br />
and wastefulness of Japanese methods. It was a matter for special<br />
concern to Australia that decisions of this kind should be made while<br />
the occupation of Japan was still proceeding and in advance of the<br />
peace settlement, and without reference to the overall question of<br />
reparations. The Australian prntest was supported by Norway, Britain<br />
aind New Zealand.<br />
After the Australian representations, it was agreed that an Australian<br />
observer should accompany the expedition; furthermore, that<br />
an international flag should be substituted for Japanese insignia; that<br />
the routes to be taken by the expedition to and from the Antarctic<br />
should be notified to interested governments and that the oil obtained<br />
as a result of the expedition should be subject to allocation by the International<br />
Emergency Food Council. Authorization of the expedition<br />
became operative only for the 1946-47 season, the United States undertalking<br />
that other interested governments would be fully consulted should </p>
<p>: ny further Japanese activities outside Japanese wa. ters be contemplated.<br />
The United States agreed that the future of the Japanese whaling<br />
industry and the disposal of Japanese whaling equipment was a<br />
matter for decision by the Allies.<br />
" The Australian Government is opposed to the re-establishment<br />
of the Japanese whaling industry in Antarctic waters. Such re-establishment,<br />
which in effect means the creation again of naval potential, is<br />
ipposed to a just settlement with Japan and should be strenuously<br />
resisted by every Allied country which contributed to victory in the<br />
Pacific war. When it became apparent recently that, notwithstanding<br />
the undertaking regarding consultation and the adverse report by the<br />
Australian observer with . the first expedition, it was proposed to send a<br />
second Japanese expedition to the Antarctic, the Australian Government<br />
made the positive and practical suggestion to the United States<br />
that a unit of the Japanese whaling fleet be operated by Australia, with<br />
the aid of Britain, New Zealand and Norway. Food, fats and oils<br />
from the expedition would be at the disposal of S. C. A. P. for distribution.<br />
The Australian offer was communicated to the United States<br />
State Department, and while under consideration the announcement of<br />
a second expedition was made.<br />
The decision of 22nd June, 1947, to approve of a second Japanese<br />
whaling expedition for 1947-48, thereby by-passing . the Far Eastern<br />
Commission, which alone is supposed to determine questions of policy<br />
and which actually has this matter on its business sheet for 26th June,<br />
is opposed to the best long-term Allied interests. The Australian<br />
Government intends to press this question in the Far Eastern Commission<br />
to secure a review of the present proposal.<br />
" The ultimate disposition of Japanese whaling facilities and equipmnent,<br />
as well as the question of the future of the Japanese whaling<br />
industry, must be a matter for Allied consultation and decision. The<br />
appropriate place for any decision that may be taken is the peace<br />
table." JAPAN-BRITISH COMMONWEALTH CONFERENCE.<br />
On 23rd June, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br />
The . preliminary conference of British Commonwealth countries<br />
to discuss the peace treaty with Japan will meet in Canberra on 26th<br />
August, 1947." JAPAN-ADVISORY COMMITTEE.<br />
On 8th July, 1947, Dr. Evatt said that he was establishing an<br />
ndvisory committee to examine questions related to the Japanese peace<br />
settlement. The committee would meet under the chairmanship of Sir<br />
Frederic Eggleston, formerly Australian Minister to China and later </p>
<p>to the United States. Sir Frederic had been working on problems<br />
related to the Japanese settlement in conjunction with departmental<br />
officers both at Canberra and abroad. The committee would include<br />
members of Parliament in addition to a representative group of Australians<br />
versed in one aspect or another of the subject.<br />
JAPAN-PROPOSED UNITED STATES MEETING.<br />
On 17th July, 1947, Mr. Chifley said-<br />
Australia is always prepared to take part in any discussions that<br />
will expedite the Pacific peace settlement and ' appreciates the present<br />
proposal of the United States Government to hold a conference of eleven<br />
nations on 19th August, 1947. But the date is entirely unsuitable to<br />
Australia in view of the British Commonwealth conference on 26th<br />
August, 1947."<br />
On 18th July, 1947, Mr. Chifley said-<br />
Australia will attend the coliference convened by the United<br />
States Government on the Japanese peace settlement, but on the date<br />
will depend which Minister will attend, and whether the Minister for<br />
External Affairs ( Dr. Evatt) can fit in his engagements with the<br />
conference." NATIONAL THEATRE.<br />
On 23rd June, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chiflcy) saidpropose<br />
to appoint a committee soon after Parliament reassembles<br />
in September, 1947, to examine the possibility of establishing<br />
a national theatre at Canberra. Some persons believe that the theatre<br />
is for educational purposes but I think it should also have an entertainment<br />
value as well. I believe that it would be possible to have a small<br />
theatre to which leading players in companies from the States could be<br />
hrought to give performances."<br />

MOTOR CAR PRODUCTION.<br />
CAR CHASSIS IMPORTS.<br />
On 24th June, 1947, the Minister for Customs ( Senator Courtice)<br />
; nlnounced that imports of pressed metal body panels, not fabricated<br />
beyond trimming of the edges, would be permitted for use in the manufacture<br />
in Australia of bodies for car and truck chassis, provided the<br />
pane! s were shlipped from the country of origin to Australia on or<br />
before 31st December, 1947. The imports were permitted because of the<br />
present shortage of steel sheets suitable for motor vehicle body manufacture<br />
and to assist in making the maximum number of motor vehicles<br />
available to Australian essential users in the shortest possible time. </p>
<p>JAPAN.<br />
TRADE-PRIVATE TRADING.<br />
On 26th June, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br />
The control authorities in Japan have fixed 15th August, 1947, as<br />
the date on which the resumption of private international commercial<br />
relations with Japan will be authorized. Because of accommodation<br />
difficulties, only 400 private trade representatives will be allowed entry<br />
into Japan in the initial stages and the length of their stay will be<br />
limited to 21 days unless arrangements are made by the Governments<br />
concerned with the control authorities for an extension of this period.<br />
:\ ustralia has been provisionially allotted a quota of 24 representatives.<br />
" An inter-departmental committee is engaged in considering the<br />
priority to be accorded to private traders who desire to visit Japan and<br />
interested persons are invited to submit applications before 5th July,<br />
1947. Traders who desire to arrange for the purchase of Japanese<br />
goods should submit full particulars to the Department of Trade and<br />
C: ustoms, while those interested in selling goods to Japan should furnish<br />
, letails to the Department of Commerce and Agriculture.<br />
" In the early stages private trade will not reach substantial proportions.<br />
Because of prior commitments, the control authorities have<br />
indicated that cotton textiles, raw silk and tea will not be available<br />
immediately for s-ale to private traders. The Commonwealth Government<br />
has arranged for the purchase of 12,000,000 yards of cotton textiles<br />
and quantities of raw silk and will continue these purchases until<br />
private traders are permitted to operate. Purchases on private account<br />
will be governed -by the range and quantity of goods available and the<br />
limitations imposed by the Australian import licensing system.<br />
Australian exports to Japan are likely to be restricted to wool and<br />
a; few minor commodities not subject to international control nor<br />
covered by long-term contracts with other countries."<br />
On 16th July, 1947, Mr. Chifley said-<br />
" A number of applications have been received from businessmen<br />
who desire to send representatives to Japan. A selection has been made<br />
by an inter-departmental committee to determine the limited number<br />
who will comprise the first party to visit Japan. The interests concerned<br />
will be notified of the selections at -an early date.<br />
Priority has been accorded to firms which ' had extensive pre-war<br />
interests in Japanese trade and representatives of associations and<br />
manufacturers who are anxious to obtain supplies of essential commodities<br />
for use in Australian industry.<br />
" An overall consideration has been the class of goods in which it<br />
is desired to trade. In this connexion, when private trade with Japan<br />
is resumed, raw silk and cotton textiles will not be available for purchase<br />
by private traders immediately. Merchant-to-merchant trading will be<br />
permitted in other goods, but imports to Australia will be subject to<br />
licensing control on the basis at present accorded to imports from hard </p>
<p>currency areas. Import licences will be granted only for essential goods<br />
which are not available in adequate quantities from local or sterling<br />
sources of supply. Licences will not be granted for importation of fancy<br />
goods, toys, crockery and other less essential goods that featured in prewar<br />
trade with Japan.<br />
As each party will be allowed to stay in Japan for only a limited<br />
ipriod, further opportunities will occur for visits by Australian business<br />
representatives. Commercial interests not included in the first party<br />
will receive consideration in subsequent parties."<br />
TRADE-WOOL.<br />
On l2nd July, 1947, Mr. Chifley said-<br />
Following negotiations . between the Comnimonwealth Government<br />
and the Supreme Command Allied Powers in Japan, 7,481 bales of particular<br />
types of low grade wool were shipped to Japan in May, 1947.<br />
Arrangements were made for payment in dollars in New York as a<br />
set-off against the purchase price of raw silk obtained in Japan by the<br />
Commonwealth Government.<br />
Following representations by Cabinet decided . to-day that<br />
further negotiations be instituted for the sale of somewhat better types<br />
of wool. The Minister for Commerce ( Mr. Pollard) has been authorized<br />
to take up the negotiations and, if successful, . the Australian Wool<br />
Realization Commission will larrange for the purchase and shipment bf<br />
the wool to Japan."<br />

RECONSTRUCTION.<br />
U. N. R. R. A.-AUSTRALIA'S PART.<br />
On 30th June, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chlifley) said-<br />
" I have to-day received the following message from the Director-<br />
General of U. N. R. R. A. at Washington ( Major-General Lowell W.<br />
Rooks):-" To-day U. N. R. R. A.' s operations substantially come to an end in<br />
Europe. In a public statement I have referred to the results achieved<br />
by this international organization and to the pro. blems which still<br />
confront the world in restoring its economy.<br />
I should like to take this opportunity of extending to the Commonwealth<br />
Government and to the people of Australia the great appreciation<br />
for the generous and effective contribution they have made to the<br />
work of this organization. Those contributions, with similar assistance<br />
from other uninvaded members of the United Nations, have provided<br />
the means of saving the lives of endless millions of people in the war<br />
devastated countries. From its experience, U. N. R. R. A. knows how<br />
much that assistance h'as been appreciated, and there exists to-day in </p>
<p>the hearts of millions of people throughout the world a very real<br />
gratitude to the people of Australia for the supplies and services they<br />
have received through the organization of U. N. R. R. A.<br />
I should like to thank you also for the provision of so many fine and<br />
experienced meu and women to serve with U. N. R. R. A. in many parts<br />
of the world. They have served with distinction and success and have<br />
dlone much to enhance the reputation of their country.<br />
U. N. R. R. A. has done its best to carry out the instructions of the<br />
United Nations in commencing the work of economic recovery in many<br />
parts of the world. U. N. R. R. A. trusts that this work will be carried on<br />
quickly and effectively, realizing that one of the essentials of world<br />
peace is thatr rea. onable economic conditions shall exist in all countries."<br />
WOMEN'S WAR ORGANIZATIONS.<br />
W. A. A. A. F.-CESSATION.<br />
On 30th June, 1947, the Minister for Air ( Mr. Drakeford) said<br />
that the Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force, which had a peak<br />
strength of 26.245, had ceased to function that day.<br />
PRICES.<br />
GOODS DECLARED "-BANANAS, REVOCATION.<br />
On 1st July, 1947, the Minister for Customs ( Senator Courtice)<br />
announced that it had been decided to lift growers' ceilings on bananas.<br />
Retail margins on bananas would continue to be fixed. Wholesale prices<br />
would be kept under notice and control would be re-imposed if there<br />
was any suggestion of exploitation of the market.<br />
GOODS DECLARED "-PINEAPPLES, REVOCATION.<br />
On 1st July, 1947, Senator Courtice announced that it had been<br />
decided to lift growers' ceilings on pineapples. Retail margins on<br />
pineapples would continue to be fixed. If prices rose to a level that<br />
suggested exploitation, consideration would be given to re-imposing<br />
controls. CIVIL AVIATION.<br />
BRITAIN-AUSTRALIA SERVICE-QANTAS LTD.,<br />
AGREEMENT, DIRECTORS.<br />
On 2nd July, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br />
Following the conclusion of the agreement by which Qantas<br />
Empire Airways Ltd., has been taken over by the Commonwealth<br />
Government, Cabinet decided to-day to appoint Mr. W. H. Fysh as<br />
general manager, with the vice-chairman of the Australian National<br />
Airlines Commission ( Mr. W. C. Taylor), the Treasury member of that<br />
commission ( Mr. G. P. N. Watt) and Sir Keith Smith as members<br />
of the boai'd of directors."<br />

<p>POST-WAR-INTERNAL ROUTES, AIRWAYS CHARGES.<br />
On 4th July, 1947, the Minister for Civil Aviation ( Mr. Drakeford)<br />
announced that the Government had decided to introduce charges for the<br />
use by operators of aircraft of airways facilities provided by the<br />
Commonwealth. Modern air transport demanded increasing ground<br />
facilities, aeradio, and navigational aids and meteorological services,<br />
and it had become customary throughout the world for the authority<br />
providing the airways facilities to make charges for their use, designed<br />
to recoup part of the expenditure. It had been" decided that a system<br />
of air route charges should be applied on regular services regardless of<br />
the number of landings involved. Aircraft used for purposes other<br />
than regular airline services would be classified according to the nature<br />
of the use to which they were put, and annual fees would be charged.<br />
Payment of charges would be introduced as from 1st August, 1947.<br />
On 25th July, 1947, Mr. Drakeford announced details of the system<br />
of charges for the use of Commonwealth aerodromes and air route facilities<br />
to he payable as from 1st August, 1947. It was estimated that the<br />
charges would bring in about Å 300,000 a year, but that would recoup<br />
the Commonwealth for only a small portion of its annual expenditure<br />
on maintenance of air ports and airways facilities. Aircraft would be<br />
divided into four classes-<br />
Those used for purely private purposes: tlhoie used fir tle hllim. ris purpo. ses<br />
of the owner: those used for reiumnerative purposes other th: rin n r I,; gilari rline<br />
and those used for the operation of airline services.<br />
The first three classes would pay an annual fee which would be<br />
lowest in the private category and progressively higher in the other two<br />
classes. The fee would be based on the weight of the aircraft and would<br />
cover the use of any aerodromes and airways facilities. Examples of the<br />
annual charges payable by owners of aircraft in eacl of the three classes<br />
were:-SClass 1. Clw 2. Class 3.<br />
t d.<br />
Tiger Moth 3 5 1 0 9 15 0<br />
D. H. 4 ( l) raon) 8 2 ti 17 5 0 25 7 6<br />
Anson 14 12 6 29 5 0 43 17 6<br />
Operators of aircraft used on regular aircraft services would not pay<br />
the annual charges for those aircraft but would pay a charge in respect<br />
of each route unit traversed. To determine the number of units the<br />
routes had been classified having regard to their length, the number of<br />
aerodromes and emergency landing ground and the availability of<br />
navigational aids. The comparatively short Melbourne-Sydney stage<br />
was rated as a two-unit route, while a much longer but less highly<br />
developed route such as the Derby-Kimberley Stations route was classified<br />
as one unit. A basic charge had been fixed for each type of aircraft </p>
<p>a~ nd the amnount payable for c ach flight would be the basic charge<br />
multiplied by the number of units, traversed. Examples of the charges<br />
were: M15esi1. 3 W. u y. Adelaide or Hohart-D. C. 3. Å 4 14S. lid.-D. U. 4.<br />
Adelaide to Pertli-D. C. 3. Å 9 9s.; Å 27 11.<br />

Trans-Australia. Airlines andl Qantas Empire Airways Ltd. would<br />
pay the charges on the Same basis as other airline operators.<br />
The charges did not apply to aircraft used on regular international<br />
nir services. Charges for-those services would be promnulgated later.<br />
I. C. A. O.-AUSTRALJAN REPRESENTATIVE.<br />
On 10th July, 1947, Mr. Drakeford announced that Dr. K. N. . E.<br />
Bradfield had been appointed Australian representative at the International<br />
Civil Aviation Organization's head-quarters at Montreal,<br />
Clanada. INTIERN~ AL ROU't'ES-LICENCES.<br />
On 25th July, 1947, Mr. Drakeford announced that the interdepartmental<br />

NORTHERN AUSTRALIA.<br />
DEVELOPMENT COMMITTEE.<br />
On 2nd July, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br />
" In 1945, the Northern Australia Development Committee -was<br />
appointed comprising representatives of the Commonwealth, Queensland<br />
and Western Australian Governments. Matters of policy are canczidered<br />
by the Minister for the Interior ( Mir. Johnson). the Premiers<br />
, if Queenqland and Western Australia and myself. </p>
<p>" The committee h-as prepared a comprehensive report dealing<br />
specifically with general measures for the relief of disabilities; specific<br />
measures for the development of industries; and measures necessary to<br />
develop specific regions.<br />
Cabinet decided to-day that a sub-committee, comprising the Minister<br />
for the Interior, the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction and<br />
myself as Treasurer and Acting Minister for Defence, should examine<br />
the report -and recommendations of the committee, and report to<br />
Cabinet." EXTERNAL TERRITORIES.<br />
NEW GUINEA-PAPUA-WAR GRATUITY FOR NATIVES.<br />
On 2nd July, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br />
The question of payment of war gratuity for natives of New<br />
Guinea and Papua was considered by the Parliamentary Committee<br />
which furnished a report on the question of war gratuity. The outstanding<br />
service rendered by these natives was fully recognized, but the<br />
Iommittee was not in possession of sufficient information to enable a<br />
recommendation to be made as to the appropriate method of rewarding<br />
their service. The question has been since considered after consultation<br />
with the Departments of External Territories, the Navy and the Army.<br />
" C: abinet to-day approved of a gratuity for natives of New Guinea<br />
and Papua who were enlisted as members of the forces, payment to be<br />
at the rate of 5s. a month for each month of service; the gratuity not<br />
to be paid for any period prior to 7th Pecember, 1941; no qualifying<br />
period to be required; native members who have been discharged for<br />
disciplinary reasons to be ineligible for the gratuity; payment to be<br />
made as early as practicable.<br />
An ex gratia payment has been approved, subject to the conditions<br />
approved for natives enlisted in the forces, for the following classes<br />
of civilian natives-members of the New Guinea Police Force and the<br />
Royal Papuan Constabulary; civilians employed as combatant soldiers<br />
by the Allied Intelligence Bureau prior to their enlistment in the " M<br />
Special Unit Infantry Battalion on 1st February. 1945.'<br />

<p>RATIONING.<br />
SUGAR-REVOCATION.<br />
On 2nd July, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifey) said-<br />
" Cabinet decided to-day that rationing of sugar be abandoned forthwith.<br />
The principal reasons for introducing sugar rationing no longer<br />
; apply. Sugar rationing in Australia does not greatly help Britain. There<br />
is an arrangement whereby the United States, Canada and Britain draw<br />
equal per capita shares from the world's sugar supply. For every<br />
10,000 tons of sugar contributed by Australia to the pool, Britain<br />
draws only about 2,000 tons. Distribution of sugar is decided by the<br />
World Emergency Food Council. World production of sugar showed a<br />
marked increase in the 1946-47 season."<br />
MEAT-CONTINUANCE.<br />
On 2nd July, 1947, Mr. Chifley said-<br />
Cabinet was informed to-day that representatives of the Meat and<br />
Allied Trades Federation had asked the Minister for Comunerce ( Mr.<br />
Pallard) and the Minister for Customs ( Senator Courtice) that rationing<br />
and price control of meat should be removed from 15th August,<br />
1947, that being the period of flush supply.<br />
The meat position in Britain is acute and on : 3th .1 ine, 1947, the<br />
Chancellor of the Exchequer ( Dr. Dalton) announced in the House of<br />
Commons that there would be a further cut in the imeat ration from<br />
is. 4d. worth a week ( including 4d. worth of canned meat) to is. 2d.<br />
worth a week.<br />
Cabinet decided that it was not possible to remove the controls.<br />
It would be very wrong for the Commonwealth Government to permit<br />
unrestricted consumption of meat when the British people are having<br />
their meagre ration further reduced. The matter will be brought before<br />
Cabinet again when there are indications that -upply of meat in Australia<br />
will be sufficient to provide not only an unrestricted Au. l tralian<br />
demand but an adequate amount for export to Brit: liii."<br />
SHIPBUILDING.<br />
IOST-WAR--DE-REQUISIT rONING.<br />
On 2nd July, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br />
Cabinet decided to-day that interstate and intra-state -vessels ( but<br />
not including passenger and other vessels required by and under charter<br />
to the Navy Department) be de-requisitioned at the earliest possible<br />
date and that the Minister for Shipping ( Senator Ashley) de-requisition<br />
individual vessels as they terminate voyages and come into position<br />
for re-delivery at home ports. But the Minister is empowered to defer<br />
the de-requisitioning of particular vessels when such action is regarded<br />
by him as essential to ensure efficient conduct of particular . rvice for<br />
example the services to New Guinea and adjacent islands. </p>
<p>Details associated with the matter will be dealt with by a Cabinet<br />
sub-committee comprising Senator Ashley, the Minister for Customs<br />
( Senator Courtice) and myself."<br />

AUSTRALIAN MILITARY FORCES.<br />
ROYAL MILITARY COLLEGE.<br />
On 2nd July, 1947, the Minister for the Army ( Mr. Chambers)<br />
announced that the intake of cadets into the Royal Military College,<br />
Duntroon. w'ould be increased in 1948 to 60 Australians and ten New<br />
Zealanders. AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING COMMISSION.<br />
APPOINTMENTS.<br />
On 3rd July, 1947, the Postmaster-General ( Senator Cameron)<br />
announced that Mr. J. S. Hanlon and Professor J. D. G. Medley had<br />
been appointed members of the Australian Broadcasting Commission<br />
for three years from 1st July, 1947.<br />
TARIFF.<br />
EXPORTS-STANDARDS.<br />
On ith July, 1947, the Minister for Commerce ( Mr. Pollard) said<br />
that Australian manufacturers must pay greater attention to the sales<br />
of their prodncts overseas if present industrial employment and production<br />
levels were to be maintained. There were no grounds for complacency<br />
in the fact that, despite export restrictions to ensure supplies<br />
for local needs, value of manufactures exported would probably reach<br />
Å 45,000,000. The figures had been achieved at a time when many competitive<br />
European countries had not reached their full export capacity<br />
of manufactures. Once local demand fell to normal, Australian surplus<br />
production would have to be exported, or productive capacity reduced<br />
with consequent unemployment. Manufacturers should remember that<br />
not only Australian production would reduce local demands.<br />
A good deal of Australian secondary industry had been built up<br />
behind protective harriers but a considerable section of it had never<br />
met the full shock of competition from imported goods, nor participated<br />
in the exucting business of overseas trading. Overseas countries had<br />
accepted Australian export methods to date, but would continue to do so<br />
only if the export business procedures practised by many Australian<br />
manufacturers and exporters were radically changed. To gain and<br />
hold thl export markets they would soon require manufacturers and<br />
exporters should conform to trading practices followed by competitor<br />
nations. Goods should be strongly packed, correctly labelled and documented<br />
and of competitive quality. </p>

NETHERLANDS EAST INDIES.<br />
POLICY-MEDIATION.<br />
On 9th July, 1947, the Minister for External Affair. i ( Dr. Evat)<br />
said that the Australian Government welcomed reports that further progress<br />
had been made towards a permanent settlement in Indonesia.<br />
The de facto authority of the republic, on the basis of the Linggadjati<br />
Agreement, which had been recognized by several goveriineiint, including<br />
the British and United States Governments, and which the Australian<br />
Government recognized, implied the acceptance by the Republican<br />
Government of very great responsibility; and the Republican<br />
Government, -as one of the negotiating parties and as a future essential<br />
element in the interim Federal State, had accepted the responsibility.<br />
The Australian Government sent representatives to Indonesia to assist<br />
in solving problems related to the recommencement of trade. The Australian<br />
Government wished both parties to understand that, if, in the<br />
interests of agreement between Dutch and Republican authorities on<br />
economic and political matters, the good offices of the Australian<br />
Government would be helpful, Australia would continue to do anything<br />
in its power to afford both the Netherlands and Indonesian authorities<br />
its assistance. Further, the Australian Government would give to the<br />
interim Federal Government, when established, advice and assistance in<br />
such matters as trade, finance, communications, and rconorni<br />
rehabilitation and development.<br />
POL[ CY-SECRITRTY COUNCIL.<br />
On 30th , July, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br />
" The Australian Government has ilnstricted its representative on<br />
the Security Council to draw the attention of the Security Council to<br />
the situation in Indonesia under Article 39 of the United Nation.<br />
Charter. Australia has taken action ten days after hostilities commenced<br />
in rndonisia, because, in accordance with Article 33 of the<br />
Charter. the parties to any dispute are obliged to seek a solution by<br />
negotiation or mediatics. Strenuous attempts have been made in consultation<br />
wilh other Governments, particularly Britain, United States<br />
and India, to bring ' about a solution in that way. However, it is felt<br />
that further delay is not justified because of the loss of life being<br />
sustained. " The policy Australia has adopted in past disputes has been to<br />
urge an investigation under Article 34 of the Charter before any decisions<br />
are reached. However, the situation in Indonesia differs from<br />
any previously brought before the council. Hostilities are being<br />
carried on. Investigation is not required to establish the crucial fact.<br />
and, before the Council determines further action, it is essential that<br />
hostilities cease. For this reason, Australia has drawn the attention<br />
of the Council to the situation under Article 39 of the Charter and<br />
thereby gives power to the council immediately to order the cessation<br />
of hostilities and subsequently to take such further steps as are necessary<br />
to restore peace. </p>
<p>33<br />
This is the first time that this article has been invoked and it is<br />
the hope of the Government, in taking this section, that not only will<br />
hostilities cease, but that the Council will prove its worth in dealing<br />
quickly and effectively with a situation of this kind.<br />
" In making this move, Australia still maintains the judicial attitude<br />
which it has . always maintained in considering any situation before<br />
the council. No attempt will be made to pre-judge the issue, and discussion<br />
of merits of the case will be avoided. The Australian representative<br />
will ask first that the necessary steps be taken to terminate<br />
hostilities, and, second, without discussing the merits of the situation,<br />
that both parties act upon Article 17 of the Linggadjati Agreement,<br />
which specifically provides that, in the event of disagreement between<br />
the two parties arising out of the agreement, a third party will be<br />
asked to arbitrate, or, failing that, the matter should be referred to<br />
the Chief Justice of the International Court. If the Australian proposal<br />
is given effect to without delay or debate on procedural issues,<br />
and if it is readily admitted by the Council that the situation is one<br />
within its jurisdiction, there should be good prospect of an immediate<br />
cessation of hostilities, and an immediate negotiation between the two<br />
parties with the assistance of a third party of their own choosing.<br />
Members of the Council should not therefore have to arbitrate or to<br />
pass judgment on the merits of the case.<br />
Action along these lines can be taken by the Council only if the<br />
Republican Government, not being a member of the United Nations,<br />
undertakes to observe the obligations and duties of the United Nations<br />
Charter, and in particular undertakes to observe Article 25, which<br />
obliges members to carry out the decisions of the council."<br />

<p>Co mmon wealth Departments and statutory authorities employed only<br />
156,500, the balance of 400,000 being employed by State and local<br />
g~ overnment authorities.<br />
" The latest bulletin issued by the Commonwealth -Statistician shows<br />
that, of the total number of ' government employees, 28 per cent, were<br />
employed by Commonwealth authorities, 62 per cent, by State Governments<br />
and 10 per cent. -by local authorities. Nearly one-third of all<br />
Commonwealth employees are employed in the Postmaster-General's<br />

COMPANIES-ISSUE OF SHARES AT A PREMIUM.<br />
On 21st July, 1947, the Prime Minist&amp; r ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br />
A statement I made in October, 1946, set out that premiums on new<br />
share issues would not necessarily -be insisted upon. In that statement<br />
I requested that, where an issue at par was proposed by a company<br />
whose shares were appreciably above par, the application should include<br />
a statement of the reasons for not requiring a premium. Since then<br />
some companies -had required premiums-others had not.<br />
i" I have reviewed the position and have decided that it is desirable<br />
ithe interests of the Australian economy that a premium should be<br />
required in all cases where there is an -appreciable margin between par<br />
value and market price. I have accordingly requested the Capital<br />
Issues Advisory Committee to give this aspect consideration in future.<br />
The committee will not insist on prohibitive premiums but will allow<br />
reasonable margins."<br />

has been suggested."<br />
