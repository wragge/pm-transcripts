TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH PAUL LYNEHAN, 7.30 REPORT,<br />
27 JUNE 1990<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
LYNEHAM intro<br />
PM: As a nation it's becoming increasingly clear that we<br />
do have to examine, in much more detail and with much<br />
more commitment, the nature of the Federal-State<br />
relationship. Not with a view to the Commonwealth<br />
scoring off the States or vice versa, but to try and<br />
address the issue of how we best deliver services to<br />
people and to look at how best we co-operate to create a<br />
competitive, efficient economy.<br />
LYNEHAM: It was an intriguing comment that passed<br />
without any follow-up as the news conference focussed on<br />
immigration and other issues. But later, in the Prime<br />
Minister's office, I discussed his ideas with him in more<br />
detail. PM: Immediately after my re-election I started to think<br />
about well, we've now been given the great responsibility<br />
and honour of governing this country at the start of the<br />
final decade of this century. We're coming up to the<br />
centenary of federation, January the first, 2001 and I am<br />
a student of history constitutional development of<br />
this country and I remembered and understood that it took<br />
the decade of the 90s in the last century, the full<br />
decade of those colonies talking to one another to work<br />
out what was the institutional and constitutional<br />
framework for the new Australia. It seemed to me that I<br />
had the responsibility now to address this issue in this<br />
last decade of this century as we come up to the<br />
centenary to try and see how best together we can look at<br />
what needs to be done to get Australia in the best<br />
institutional and constitutional shape for the beginning<br />
of that next century. So I've been talking with my<br />
colleagues about it, some ministerial colleagues and with<br />
people on my staff and what I'm planning to do is,<br />
relatively soon, after the Premiers Conference is to make<br />
a major speech which will be an attempt to launch that<br />
process. LYNEHAM: Structural change in the relationship?<br />
PM: Well, it will address the issues, without being<br />
exhaustive and I mean I don't want to give the whole </p>
<p>2<br />
speech now, but, but it's a sensible question and it<br />
warrants an answer. It will address these issues, as I<br />
say, without being exhaustive, Paul. The, the processes<br />
that exist for the delivery of services by Commonwealth<br />
and States and local government and the degree of<br />
duplication and overlapping that exists, how can we look<br />
at more efficiencies there, it will look at the question<br />
of micro economic reform because, by definition in this<br />
country, it's not just a matter for the Commonwealth. I<br />
mean, what struck me as I've been thinking, the thing<br />
that really struck me as much as anything as I started to<br />
think about this, Paul, was that I looked at Europe, I<br />
see what's happening there, the movement to Europe 1992<br />
and what do I see? I see 1992, a Europe of 12 nations<br />
which will have less inhibitions, less barriers to the<br />
free movement of trade and services, to the effective<br />
functioning of that great unit than will exist in this<br />
one nation of Australia. And so I want to look at those<br />
things, but the major concern I have is that the States<br />
shall see this initiative of mine, not as point scoring<br />
for the Commonwealth, there may well indeed be the<br />
conclusion that in some areas it's best for the States to<br />
do more.<br />
LYNEHAM: So you're prepared to shuffle the deck of<br />
powers not only dealing yourself the best hand, but<br />
PM: It's not dealing, there's no question of looking at<br />
the I mean, you know I've historically had this view<br />
which, that talk about States' rights and someone else's<br />
rights and federal rights, that's never appealed to me.<br />
LYNEHAM: You've also suggested though that you think<br />
you said once in a series of lectures you thought we<br />
might be better of f without State Governments at all.<br />
PM: Well that's, I mean, if you what I said then, if<br />
you were now, that was in 1979 in the Boyer Lectures, I<br />
said if as you move towards the end of the 20th century,<br />
you were looking at the institutional and constitutional<br />
framework for the Australia of today it wouldn't be the<br />
same as it was then. But the reality is, as I accept, is<br />
that in my lifetime and quite beyond that we have to work<br />
within a federal framework where there's a Commonwealth<br />
Government and States. The intelligent challenge to me,<br />
to my Government, to the State Premiers and their<br />
Governments, irrespective, I hope, of political<br />
persuasions, the challenge and the responsibility for us<br />
is to say now, let's look at the distribution of<br />
functions not just in a constitutional sense, but the<br />
way, institutionally, it's developed and the way in which<br />
we have responsibilities for transport between us. Now<br />
one of the things that we need to do cooperatively and it<br />
may involve some financial adjustments, I accept that,<br />
but what are the things that together we need to do to<br />
put this country in the best possible shape as we come up<br />
and it will be very quick, as we come up towards that<br />
centenary of federation. It took our predecessors, as I </p>
<p>3<br />
say, a decade. The last decade of the 19th century to<br />
prepare for Australian federation. I think intelligently<br />
and sensibly we can use this last decade of the<br />
century to get Australia into better shape for what's<br />
going to be a very, very tough and competitive 21st<br />
century. LYNEHAM: Well, you can only wish him luck. Being the<br />
Balkans of the South Pacific seems like a very<br />
inefficient way to shape up to the next century. The<br />
other big issue today of course is immigration<br />
following last night's marathon Cabinet meeting Mr Hawke<br />
announced that Chinese nationals who were here on June<br />
last year just after the Beijing massacre will be able<br />
to stay for four years under a special category of<br />
temporary residence permit. After that time their<br />
permanent residence here will depend on the political<br />
climate in China, although ultimately none of them will<br />
be sent home against their will. Now, isn't that a bit<br />
contradictory not according to Bob Hawke.<br />
PM: The first thing which goes to the question of the<br />
four year term, Paul, is this that it would be quite<br />
improper, it would not be a discharge of our humanitarian<br />
responsibilities if we imposed upon these people an<br />
obligation now to make a choice as to whether they claim<br />
to become permanent residents of Australia and repudiate<br />
their Chinese citizenship because, obviously, it is our<br />
belief and on the evidence that the great majority of<br />
these will want to go back to their homeland, but not<br />
make a decision in that respect while the conditions in<br />
China as they are, uncertain. So they have a four year<br />
period now where their time in Australia is secure.<br />
You've got your four years, you needn't commit yourself<br />
to making a decision about cutting or anything like<br />
that. Now it is our hope that at the end of that four<br />
year period, that conditions in China will have improved<br />
and I think it will be their hope so that they can go<br />
back as it was their intention when they came here, to go<br />
back to their country. And we're saying that if<br />
conditions have returned to a position where it's the<br />
judgement of the Government of the day, that the<br />
returnees would be at no risk, then that's what should<br />
happen. But we are saying that you just don't lightly<br />
give this precious thing of Australian permanent<br />
residence, which is the key to citizenship, you just<br />
don't lightly give that and if there's no reason why they<br />
shouldn't go back, then they go. But if a person at that<br />
time says no, we're not going back, we're frightened.<br />
We'll say alright you can do that but you don't then get<br />
the grant of permanent residence which is the key to<br />
citizenship. We'll let you stay here by rolling over<br />
temporary extensions.<br />
LYNEHAM: Stay here forever by rolling over temporary<br />
extensions? </p>
<p>PM: Yes because it's our commitment. We've made the<br />
commitment and it goes right back. We've made the<br />
commitment no-one will be forced back against their<br />
will in this group because there was this cataclysmic<br />
event LYNEHAM: But these things are good if there's a benign<br />
regime in China. Why do we have people then sitting here<br />
for decades after on these rolled over temporary permits?<br />
PM: Well, because you've got to face the situation that<br />
some could say and you they can say well, look, I<br />
come from a part of China, it's all very well for you to<br />
say that generally speaking things are alright and so on,<br />
but I say to you that as a result of people who are in a<br />
position of influence where I come from and because of<br />
something that happened that time, I would be at risk.<br />
Now we are not prepared to take that risk, but we are not<br />
going, as I say, lightly and automatically to give<br />
permanent residence which is the key to citizenship to<br />
this country in circumstances where we think it's not<br />
justified. LYNEHAM: And if they do stay on under these rolled over<br />
temporary permits<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
LYNEHAM: What rights would they have, would they be sort<br />
of second class citizens?<br />
PM: Well, they wouldn't have all the rights of permanent<br />
citizens, but you will notice in the decision that<br />
because there are some complications in just determining<br />
what rights are going to go into this period of the four<br />
year term and the Ministers still have to sort that out.<br />
I can't give you the final answers precisely because<br />
that's got to be determined, that'll come back to Cabinet<br />
very, very soon. But clearly they won't attract all the<br />
rights of full citizenship, full permanent resident.<br />
LYNEHAM: And those who had overstayed their visas here<br />
by the time of the massacre of Beijing<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
LYNEHAM: Some of them, let's face it, have fallen on<br />
their feet haven't they?<br />
PM: Well that can be put, but what we're I mean,<br />
there's two things about that. In a sense, conceptually,<br />
it's fairly difficult to distinguish between those and<br />
those who hadn't overstayed. I mean, here this<br />
cataclysmic event occurred in China at the beginning of<br />
June of last year. In a sense the ramifications of that<br />
and the implications for the people in Australia and in<br />
terms of their reactions, didn't distinguish between<br />
those who were overstayers and who weren't. So there's </p>
<p>that point of view and what the Minister is told also by<br />
his Department that it's also administratively difficult<br />
to sort them out. So for two reasons, I mean, the<br />
distinction isn't made.<br />
LYNEHAM: Of course, in four years Dr Hewson might be<br />
Prime Minister.<br />
PM: Well, depending whether the Liberals have continued<br />
their process of changing leaders pretty regularly, but I<br />
can't bind future Governments, but I would think, and I<br />
say this in respect to the Opposition whether it's led by<br />
Dr Hewson or not, in a hypothetical position they were in<br />
power, I don't believe they will be, but in that<br />
hypothetical position, I would think that they would<br />
regard as reasonable, the balance that we've tried to<br />
strike between our compassionate humanitarian<br />
responsibilities to these people and also the<br />
responsibility we have as a Government to have control of<br />
our migration program. I think we've, I think we've<br />
struck the balance fairly. I'm certain that Australia,<br />
being a country which has per capita more of these people<br />
than any other, I know from what's happened elsewhere,<br />
we've been more generous than anyone else.<br />
LYNEHAM: Thanks for joining us.<br />
PM: It's been a pleasure, Paul, thank you very much.<br />
