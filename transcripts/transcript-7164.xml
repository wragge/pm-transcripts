PRIME MINISTER<br />
CHECKAGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
LAUNCH OF THE AUSTRALIAN NUGGET BULLION COIN<br />
SYDNEY 23 APRIL 1987<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
Today we launch the Australian Nugget gold bullion coins,<br />
marking the culmination of two years of co-operation between<br />
the Federal Government and the Government of Western<br />
Australia.--Many groups deserve recognition for this achievement,<br />
including the West Australian Development Corporation,<br />
trading as Goldcorp Australia, the Perth Mint, the<br />
Commonwealth Treasury and the Royal Australian Mint. While<br />
congratulating them all, I want to pay special tribute to<br />
the initiative and drive of my friend the Premier of Western<br />
Australia, Brian Burke.<br />
Thanks to Brian and to the many other people involved with<br />
this project, a new range of gold bullion coins is entering<br />
the marketplace. Late last year, a limited ed -ition of proof<br />
coins of the Australian Nugget series was released for the<br />
numismatic market. The oversubscription of that edition<br />
suggests a bright future awaits the Australian Nugget series<br />
on the gold bullion market.<br />
The discovery of gold in the last century played a central<br />
role in the development of the Australian nation. Gold<br />
attracted new settlers, it generated new cities and towns,<br />
it helped forge our political traditions and was a great<br />
spur to more diversified economic growth. </p>
<p>2.<br />
It is no accident that the idea for the Australian Nugget<br />
coins should have originated in Western Australia,<br />
Australia's largest gold producing State. And the theme of<br />
these gold coins famous Australian Nuggets signifies the<br />
importance of the discovery of gold in the development of<br />
the Australian nation.<br />
As these coins show, gold has been discovered in many<br />
corners of the Australian continent, from northern Western<br />
Australia to southern Victoria, by prospectors using shovels<br />
in the last century to those using metal detectors in recent<br />
years. The 1 ounce coin depicts the Welcome Stranger, the largest<br />
nugget ever found, which was unearthed in 1869 near Dunolly,<br />
in Victoria. The Hand of Faith Nugget, depicted on the 1/ 2<br />
ounce coin, was also discovered in Victoria, at Wedderburn,<br />
some 111 years later in 1980.<br />
But the Little Hero, shown on the 1/ 10 ounce coin, was<br />
discovered thousands of kilometres away, at Marble Bar, in<br />
Western Australia, while the Golden Eagle on the 1/ 4 ounce<br />
coin was found in 1931 near Norseman.<br />
The 1980s have seen a massive and rapid resurgence of gold<br />
production in Australia.<br />
My Government recently decided not to remove the tax-exempt<br />
status of the gold mining industry. That decision, along<br />
with the high price of gold and the development of new<br />
mining techniques, has helped make gold again a major<br />
contributor to the nation's economic development.<br />
In 1986, Australian gold production grew by 24 per cent to<br />
the highest level recorded since 1913. of the 73,000<br />
kilograms produced last year, 57,000 were exported, earning<br />
Australia $ 955 million in revenue, or nearly 3 per cent of<br />
total exports. In the first three months of 1987 gold<br />
exports have already earned $ 422 million nearly 5 per cent<br />
of export revenue so far this year.<br />
By the end of the year, some 140 gold mines will be<br />
operating in Australia, with more than 200 gold mining<br />
companies actively exploring for gold or producing it.<br />
Australia is now the world's fastest growing gold producer.<br />
So it makes good sense that we should be one of the world's<br />
top producers of bullion coins.<br />
Since gold bullion coins became available in the early<br />
1970s, they have made an important contribution to an<br />
expanding world market for gold. </p>
<p>Like all gold bullion coins the true value of the Australian<br />
Nugget coins will essentially be determined by the world<br />
price of their gold content. However the coins will be<br />
legal tender in Australia, so buyers can be confident of<br />
their quality and standards.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
My Government's policies are aimed at restoring Australia's<br />
economic performance and ensuring the future prosperity of<br />
all Australians.<br />
I believe the gold industry from the mining of gold ores,<br />
to the production and export of refined gold, to the<br />
development of a market for Australian gold coins has an<br />
important part to play in achieving those goals.<br />
The flair and entrepreneurial drive of the organisers of<br />
this project is to be commended. It is therefore with very<br />
great pleasure that I launch the Australian Nugget gold<br />
bullion coins. </p>
