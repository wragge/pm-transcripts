FOR MEDIA 1 July 1983<br />
The Federal Government has honoured its election commitment to<br />
support the construction of the Eurdekin Dam.<br />
Cabinet has decided to match the previous Government's undertaking<br />
to meet the cost of stage one of the dam.<br />
During the election campaign the ALP stated its support for the<br />
project and its belief that the dam could be economically just4-ified.<br />
We are pleased that the Government can now give North Queenslanders<br />
an assurance that this important project will proceed.<br />
As a matter of courtesy I have to~ day informed the Premier and<br />
Deputy Premier of Queensland of the Government's decision. </p>
