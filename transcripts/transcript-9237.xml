PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH CAROLINE TUCKER, 4QR, BRISBANE, QLD<br />
MONDAY 16 MAY, 1994<br />
CT: Now, you were preaching to the converted today, weren't you?<br />
PM: Now, well, I suppose if we are to say that the Queensland education<br />
system is already giving a lead to Australia in the promotion of Asian<br />
languages maybe that's true. Because, the Premier and I had the<br />
pleasure of going to a classroom after the assembly and I must say,<br />
seeing a class full of Australian kids speaking in Chinese with a very<br />
enthusiastic teacher of Chinese, was really a thrill.<br />
CT: Do your children study Asian languages?<br />
PM: No, they don't but as a consequence of this, the Premier bought this<br />
up at the Council of Australian Governments which is, as you know, a<br />
non financial Premiers' meeting and we adopted a policy of developing<br />
a national Asian languages policy. This will focus on the speaking of<br />
Japanese, Chinese, Korean and Indonesian and we announced a $ 48<br />
million dollar program in the Budget for it so we're now starting to see<br />
it move. So, there's a bit of Queensland leadership which has been<br />
very good.<br />
CT: Good to see. On the subject of education still, it appears the<br />
republican debate is set to be rekindled, can you tell us about the<br />
public education campaign which is being designed?<br />
PM: Yes, well, somebody, today, got a story from the bureaucracy about a<br />
matter the Cabinet was considering, or a Cabinet committee, about<br />
some general education about the Constitution. Now, as it turned out,<br />
the Cabinet didn't adopt it that didn't make the story. But, the point<br />
was that one of the things that Malcolm Turnbull's Republican Advisory<br />
Committee found was that the unde rstanding of the Constitution was,<br />
fairly slight. That's in part because it was basically written, as you<br />
know, in the last gasp of the 19th century for the British parliament to </p>
<p>2<br />
keep an eye on Australia. And, so, they had all of these mechanisms<br />
there like the Executive Council the Cabinet isn't mentioned and<br />
so a reader, today, of the Constitution would hardly understand how<br />
Australia works.<br />
So, you know, the Premier was saying as we were coming in in the car<br />
today that we often despair about the fact that kids sort of lose interest<br />
in public life and in politics and lose faith in it; if they don't<br />
understand at least how the Constitution operates then we're a bit of a<br />
loss. Anyway, this was a proposal to talk about the Constitution, not to<br />
put the ' yes' or ' no' case on the republic. And, we didn't even adopt it,<br />
anyway.<br />
CT: So, it's not even on the table?<br />
PM: It's not even on the table. But, it may come back because I think,<br />
probably, Constitutional education or education on constitutional<br />
issues is something we should do. It's a bit like the Asian languages.<br />
CT: So, would you be sticking to the timetable for the republican debate to<br />
go ahead?<br />
PM: Well, in a sense we don't have a timetable. I think this is something<br />
that Australians want to think about and as the public debate filters on<br />
and the work of that committee was very good, it was the first real bit<br />
of text that we've ever had about the quantification of powers and<br />
mode of election and all these other things. As it seeps out in the<br />
debate, generally, there will be a better understanding of it. And the<br />
government will be saying more about it as we move through the next,<br />
you know, year or two.<br />
CT: If we could just go back to Asia, you're going to Jakarta next month?<br />
PM: I am.<br />
CT: That's four times since you've become Prime Minister, is there a<br />
special area that you're interested in over there or do you think it's just<br />
a regional issue?<br />
PM: Well, I'm going on this occasion because of the Austral ia-Indonesia<br />
1994 Exhibition which will be the largest trade exhibition we've ever<br />
mounted in any country, or ever mounted outside of Australia. And,<br />
because Indonesia is so significant as an economy and matters so<br />
much to us as a society and it being such a very large exhibition, I<br />
thought the thing to do was to respond to the invitation to open it. And,<br />
secondly, I'll have a chance to see President Soeharto and talk about<br />
the forthcoming APEC leaders' meeting which is on in November so it's<br />
a natural point to have another conversation with him and the<br />
government. </p>
<p>CT: Do you see Indonesia becoming increasingly important to Australia?<br />
PM: I think it is the country of greatest significance to us in terms of our<br />
foreign, commercial and trade policies. And, therefore, understanding<br />
it, getting to know it better, building trust and confidence between us is<br />
central to Australia's best interests.<br />
CT: Well, with that focus in that particular region and countries like<br />
Indonesia how do you view sending Australian troops to Rwanda?<br />
PM: This falls into the general humanitarian category and our general<br />
support for the United Nations as an institution. I think the UN has<br />
asked a number of countries if they'd be willing to provide military<br />
assistance to assure delivery of humanitarian assistance. They're not<br />
saying, " Come over here and separate the warring parties." But, at<br />
this stage there is no formal Security Council decision about the nature<br />
of the operation and while we've been generally sympathetic to these<br />
sorts of operations in the past, we'll want to see exactly what is being<br />
proposed.<br />
CT: Would you support it without a truce of some sort being in place?<br />
PM: Well, I think I'd let that one go until we see exactly what the UN<br />
intends, itself. And, even after it decides something it doesn't mean to<br />
say that we will necessarily agree, though, on occasions we have.<br />
CT: Alright, on to something else, last week's Budget set aside $ 500<br />
million for Aboriginal health over five years, the AMA doesn't quite<br />
agree with those figures, what's the real picture here?<br />
PM: Well, the AMA, this Brendon Nelson character, this is an organisation<br />
whose general policy is to do Medicare in. I mean, this is an<br />
organisation which is about tramping all over the one health system<br />
that provides lower to middle income Australians with security in<br />
health. And, they're now going on, taking up the cause of Aboriginal<br />
health as a cause celebre for which you would believe they were the<br />
principal protagonists. They never have been. And, we don't believe<br />
that with a massive increment in funding proposed by the government<br />
that you could actually spend more than that and spend it wisely. So,<br />
you know, this is<br />
CT: Is it really a massive increase, though?<br />
PM: Oh, it is, it's a big increase.<br />
CT: To what extent?<br />
PM: Well, it's, I think, at the limits of what we can sensibly program to<br />
spend. And that's, I think, the important point. But, the idea that this is<br />
a betrayal of Aboriginals, if you said to Mr Nelson, " Listen, what about </p>
<p>we start reviewing the common fees for some specialist consultations<br />
and we provide some of those savings for Aboriginal health?", you'd<br />
hear the shout and the hue and cry from AMA headquarters. So, we<br />
could treat a lot of these general protestations with the scepticism,<br />
healthy scepticism, I think they deserve.<br />
CT: There's been a fair bit of discussion about the Aboriginal and Torres<br />
Strait Islander Commission ( ATSIC) having control of those funds as<br />
well. Do you feel that that is really the right decision, to leave those<br />
funds in the control of ATSIC?<br />
PM: Well, health, in respect of Aboriginals, has never been exclusively with<br />
ATSIC. The Commonwealth Department of Health and general<br />
national health delivery has found its way to support of Aboriginal<br />
people. There's always this question of a trade between so-called self<br />
determination in the management of Aboriginal affairs, including<br />
health, and the other general programs of the Commonwealth. I think<br />
we've got the balance pretty right and the notion that we should take it<br />
away from ATSIC and just dispense it all departmentally I don't agree<br />
with. The main thing here is to make sure that Aboriginal people, that<br />
their health environment and the direct help for health in acute terms,<br />
is more effective. That's what has to happen here and we think these<br />
programs can be made to be delivered effectively. But, once you start<br />
pushing the envelope out where you can't be certain you can really<br />
wind the programs up, you've got to wonder about the point of all that.<br />
CT: You must be reasonably pleased, just to finish off, reasonably pleased<br />
with the sort of reception the White Paper and the Budget have had<br />
out there in the community? Jeff Kennett seems to think you could win<br />
another election in the near future, would you give it a go?<br />
PM: Well, I said the other day, elections are too hard to win to give the time<br />
away for nothing. I mean, it's just fifteen months since the last election<br />
and I don't think the public want nor appreciate anyone sort of, at this<br />
point, looking around for an electoral opportunity. They want you to do<br />
what you said you'd do. Now, in the election campaign, we said that<br />
one of the things one of the things I made very clear is we would<br />
pick the unemployed up, we'd bring them along with the rest of us, that<br />
we wouldn't leave them behind. And the White Paper is a serious<br />
attempt, not just in Australian terms but in world terms, to do<br />
something innovative and new in terms of the labour market to<br />
personally case manage and next year we'll be personally case<br />
managing 509,000 Australians to understand their personality, to<br />
understand their aptitudes, their educational standards, their work<br />
experience and to try and design training for them and then place them<br />
into a job with a job subsidy. In doing that, what the White Paper says<br />
is we will remain a society that cares about one another and we will<br />
remain an inclusive society. That is, one where we move along<br />
together and we don't develop an underclass. Now, I think Australians<br />
expected the government to do that, we said we'd do it in the election </p>
<p>and that's the nature of the Paper and, I think, Australians have felt<br />
good about that. They've said, " Good, that's what we think, that's what<br />
we think you should do."<br />
CT: Has business said that?<br />
PM: By and large, yes. The White Paper got a very good response from<br />
I've got some of them with me from the Metal Trades Industry<br />
Association, from the Business Council, from various other, if you like,<br />
business bodies. Because, in this recovery skills formation which<br />
we always have problems with in recoveries, shortages of skills<br />
normally we have recourse to the migration program, on this occasion<br />
we won't be able to have the recourse to it in the volume we've had in<br />
the last recovery phase. So, the skills will have to come from our<br />
domestic labour market, from new entrants to the workforce from<br />
school and by training those three to four hundred thousand people<br />
who've been unemployed for 12 months or more. So, I think business<br />
has said, " Look, we will face some skills bottlenecks here; it's a good<br />
thing the government is doing here." Basically, if we can get these<br />
people and train them and place them and get them back into the<br />
mainstream, not only is it an equitable and decent and fair thing to do,<br />
it's also an efficient thing to do.<br />
CT: Alright, I'm afraid I'm going to have to leave it there once again,<br />
we've run out of time if I want to include anything else in the program<br />
today. Thankyou very much for coming in. Good to see you.<br />
PM: Good Caroline. Thanks for the opportunity.<br />
ends. </p>
