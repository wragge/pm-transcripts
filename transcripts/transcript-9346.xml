PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP,<br />
PRESS CONFERENCE, IMPERIAL HOTEL, TOKYO<br />
I SEPTEMBER 1994<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
J: Prime Minister, can we ask you some questions In relation to the<br />
shooting overnight In Sydney first up, If you don't mind?<br />
PM: Well, that's what I was going to say something about. Well, I was<br />
very naturally I knew John Newman. I was very depressed about it<br />
and, you know, somewhat at a loss for words, I think, about the sort of<br />
impact of this on someone In public life who had served the<br />
community there very well. Of course, he was quite committed to the<br />
community in Cabramatle and was Involved in all facets of it. And as<br />
you know, often quite fearlessly. So, it's a bad day for life In New<br />
South Wales when this sort of thing happens.<br />
We don't know whet the motives are yet, of this, and we don't have<br />
any details of what happened other than the sketchy ones. We know,<br />
that Is, the circumstances, but not any of the background, and the<br />
Australian Federal Police will be co-operating with the Now South<br />
Wales police In the Investigallon,<br />
J: Are you concerned that this may be a case of politically motivated<br />
killing?<br />
PM: Well, I would be concerned if it was politically motivated, yes. But it<br />
may not be. One doesn't know, and I don't think it is really useful to<br />
speculate about it.<br />
J: Mr Newman has been campaigning for more police..( inaudible).. and<br />
an Asian Taskforce. will you move to see if any of those things are<br />
now put in place, given this shooting?<br />
PM. Well, it's not a maeter of me moving. This is a mailer for New South<br />
Wales government, and the New South Wales Police force, and it's<br />
their Investigation it's essentially their matter. But we will certainly<br />
co-operate with them. </p>
<p>J: He was also campaigning for tougher deportation laws, Mr Keating,<br />
do you think that's something that...<br />
PM: All that begs the question about the crime being a political one, and I<br />
Just don't think one should add any credence to that at this point.<br />
J: Do you sympathlse, though, with his arguments that there was a<br />
great...<br />
PM: Well, there's no point in speculating I'm not speculating about it at<br />
all.<br />
J: Have you communicated with Premier Fahey today?<br />
PM: No, I haven't, no.<br />
J: There's some report going around back home that you have been In<br />
contact with the police in New South Wales...<br />
PM. No. no. But the AFP have identified liaison officers in Sydney to co.<br />
operate as a conduit for the NSW investigations, and of course,<br />
naturally any Intelligence holdings which the AFP have, wilch may be<br />
useful to the NSW police, they are welcome to.<br />
J: Are you at all concerned that there might be a backlash against the<br />
Vietnamese community?<br />
PM; No, I think this Is a very mature society In Australia, and I think<br />
Australians will see this killing for what it is that is an unacceptable<br />
act of criminal violence, whatever it's motivations.<br />
Well as you know I've still got a day of meetings to go. but I was very<br />
pleased with discussions I had yesterday with Prime Minister<br />
Murayama and his colleagues. They covered Issues of Importance to<br />
Australia-Japan relations. such as changes in the Japanese political<br />
system, social policy in each country, resource issues In the South<br />
Pacific, and Japan's global role. Including membership of the ( UN)<br />
Security Council. But the main focus was on regional development,<br />
especially on APEC<br />
I was able to explain to the Prime Minister why I thought APEC was<br />
so important to Australia, and we think the rest of the region.<br />
including Japan It was a very encouraging conversation In all.<br />
Japan is a great supporter of both APEC and trade liberalisation in<br />
the region, so I'm sure this will help our discussions will help in the<br />
run up to Bogor. It will for mo to know the Prime Minister, to have run<br />
across these issues with him so that when I soo him In Bogor of<br />
course, we'll know one another and have some solid background in<br />
the issues beforo us. I think I'll leave It at that and invite questions. </p>
<p>J: Prime Minister, last night we were told that you were pleased to see<br />
that the Japanese Prime Minister was committed to a " good outcome"<br />
in Bogor can you explain what that means? What's a good<br />
outcome?<br />
PM: Well, I think they want to see a commitment to trade liberalisation in<br />
the region. But, I didn't have a technical discussion with the Prime<br />
Minister, I mean, I have been in and out of the APEC issue now for<br />
so long and all the little nuances and eddy currents and the rest, one<br />
can't expect a Prime Minister just appointed to have an Infrastructure<br />
of knowledge meetings past and all the events and the nuances of it,<br />
and I didn't press him on it. Just the general political Issues I mean,<br />
what we're looking for in Bogor Is political authority there are<br />
enough people particularly after the Uruguay Round experience just<br />
behind them there are enough people now quite export In trade<br />
matters and In trade liberalisation matters. As always, as in Uruguay,<br />
the problem was political authority anld it was that which I was<br />
speaking of, and seeking, rather than any other, if you like, detailed<br />
response.<br />
J: Did you hear anything from the Japanese Prime Minister that might<br />
discourage you from pursuing any agenda that you have In mind for<br />
Bogor?<br />
PM: No, no. I mean. I think that the Prime Minister was quite remarkably<br />
cross all the principle issues. I say quite remarkably, I mean, with a<br />
fair degree of sophistication.<br />
J: Did he put the traditional Japanese position for preference for some<br />
sort of MFN process?<br />
PM: No, The acronym MFN was never mentioned.<br />
J: Were timetables mentioned, Prime Minister?<br />
PM: No,<br />
J: So did you seek in any way to get some sort of commitment from him<br />
to a specific date?<br />
PM: No.<br />
J: Without debating the actual date?<br />
PM: No. No, because these things are all about starts, they're not about<br />
finishes. They're all about starts, and it's like our own tariff changes<br />
in Australia. I mean, we started the tariff reduction program in 1988<br />
and we put the second phase in 1991 and 1997.. but by 1991, </p>
<p>everyone understood what the game was. And most people have<br />
adjusted to it much earlier than 1997.<br />
J: Did he Indicate he's prepared to look at an earlier start than perhaps<br />
the EPG group...<br />
PM: I didn't press him on those sorts of details. I mean, I had the chance<br />
to go to those sort of details with other people.<br />
J: Mr Keeling, APEC has been described as a potential catalyst for a<br />
fresh round of International trade negotiations did you get any sense<br />
of the Prime Minister of Japan's..( inaudible),.. arguments?<br />
PM: Oh, I think that the Japanese see... I mean, remember this that the<br />
Prime Minister was at the Naples Summit the G-7 the open<br />
markets 2000 Initiative didn't travel so well there, and I think he<br />
understood right up close what the trade liberalisetion international<br />
discussion is like. I'm sure Japan understands very clearly that<br />
APEC is half the world's production and half the world's population.<br />
So, what APEC does matters simply because of its size.<br />
J: Did he Indicate that the Japanese have preference for negotiating tho<br />
details of how free Irade will continue before committing to a date of<br />
some sort?<br />
PM: I don't think so. Japan is worldly wise about this stuff. I mean, they<br />
have been in the Uruguay debate now for years, and they see, I think,<br />
the value of APEC. The G-7 is very much an elite thing, trying to sort<br />
of. you know, kick off or direct some sort of trade liberaliselion<br />
beyond the GATT, whereas APEC Is a broadly based bottom-up<br />
thing. I mean, it's something where the countries all understand the<br />
debate, they all talk to one another, you get that sonso of a<br />
community view being brought to it. Which is not the case with the G-<br />
7, and I think Japan understands that well.<br />
J: Are there any countries In APEC that you feel might be... not want to<br />
join any consensus on moving it forward?<br />
PM: Not that I know of.<br />
J: Are you confident that you can win China's support to some sort of<br />
specific timetable?<br />
PM: Well, the Chinese are pragmatists. I mean, there was always -some<br />
doubt that they would come to Seattle. There was no doubt In my<br />
mind that they would come. I mean. they are pragmatic, and they do<br />
see the value, I think, in opening up markets In the Asia-Pacific for<br />
their products. </p>
<p>J: On the domestic side, are you confident that you could win support<br />
for an export tariff regime In Australia by the year 2000, for example?<br />
PM: Well, we're almost there ourselves. That's the point. I mean, one of<br />
the things in the EPG report about staggering the stuff Is for the<br />
developing countries first, and the developed countries later, Is that<br />
we will be down to a level of 5% of general manufacturing protection<br />
by 1997, and the plant areas are around 15% in terms of tariffs but<br />
this is going to be more than about tariffs. It's going to be about nontariff<br />
barriers, and It's going to be about services. I mean, It's going to<br />
about trade in the broader sense, not simply tariffs.<br />
J: For example, on the auto makers have they been consulted at all on<br />
this question of bringing their 15% tariff further down?<br />
PM; No, but we haven't said either that it would necessarily come below<br />
that. See again, what happens in any of these rounds Is that<br />
countries give offers you remember the Uruguay Round offers<br />
people try end look at their sectors which are difficult for them and<br />
they provide offers. They have got to be acceptable In the general<br />
round and we're a long way from any of that.<br />
J: Did the Prime Minister lest night outline what Japan actually wants<br />
from the Bogor meetings? Any specific outcomes?<br />
PM: No; only in the sense In agreeing with me that it's a great opportunity<br />
to advance the velocity of trade and investment in the Asia-Pacific,<br />
and it shouldn't be missed.<br />
J: Mr Keating, on security did the Prime Minister outline Japan's<br />
current thinking on UN Security Council seats there seems to havo<br />
been a bit of movement on that recently?<br />
PM: Well yes. I said Australia maintains the position we have had that we<br />
thoughl it was an anachronism that Japan the second largest<br />
economy In the world, a large nation of 130 million people were not<br />
represented in the Security Council, end you couldn't adequately<br />
reflect on world opinion without that being represented, and I put the<br />
view to him that I thought there was a consistency between Security<br />
Council membership and, well certainly, let me put it in the negative<br />
no inconsistency in Security Council membership and Japan needing<br />
to play a military role. I didn't think these things.. one necessarily<br />
followed the other, and that Japan could play a role in this world body<br />
because it's consulted always on major issues even if it isn't part of<br />
the security council.<br />
J: What was his view? </p>
<p>6<br />
PM: Well, I think he was probably a bit more interested in my view at the<br />
time and Uhere lias obviously been a difference of view in Japan<br />
about this, obviously c6ming from it's long constitutional history, and<br />
the impediments to military engagement, and military involvement.<br />
But I think Japan is sorting Its way through this. I mean, it's a very<br />
great change going on In Japan at the moment I mean, you can see<br />
that with the changes at the last election, and the Hosakawa<br />
Government, the rise of Shinselto these things are, I think, straws In<br />
the wind of a greater change, and that change has been about Japan<br />
playing a role commensurate with its size. This is just another<br />
manifestation of that debate.<br />
J: Did he give any indlcation of his assessment of security Issues on the<br />
Korean peninsula?<br />
PM: No.<br />
J: Just one last question what did he say about the South Pacific<br />
issues?<br />
PM: Well, I raised these Issues with him. I said that I thought that, as<br />
Chairmen of the South Pacific Forum, I should tell the Prime Minister<br />
what had transpired. I thanked him for Japan's continuing Interest in<br />
the Forum, and where Vice Minister Yanaglsawa came, and for it's<br />
aid to the region, but said there were specific difficulties In forestry<br />
and fisheries, and particularly In fisheries where the Pacific fishery Is<br />
the principal source of fish stocks to Japan, that it had an Interest in<br />
seeing that the fishery was well conducted, that there was adequate<br />
research about replenishment and that the member states were<br />
assisted, at least, in the first instance by getting an adequate return,<br />
and the returns historically have been low. And that In everyone's<br />
long-term interests, we should Iry and make the fishery a viable thing,<br />
over a long period of lime. and that Australia would play its role In<br />
fisheries research and I look forward to Japan playing a collaborative<br />
role with us.<br />
J: Finally Prime Minister, would you clarify there's been some<br />
confusion back in Australia in regards to your comments yesterday<br />
about an early election?<br />
PM: I gave you the answer, I gave it as soon as I was asked, so if you're<br />
confused, you're easily confused.<br />
J: Is an early election on the timetable?<br />
PM: No. No. With a capital and a big nought behind It.<br />
ends. </p>
