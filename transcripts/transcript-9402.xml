** CHECK AGAINST DELI VERY"*<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING, MP<br />
AUSTRALIAN QUALITY AWARDS<br />
SYDNEY, 3 NOVEMBER 1994<br />
Well, it's a great pleasure to be speaking to you all right across Australia.<br />
The involvement of so many people in these National Quality Awards is as<br />
good an indicator as any of just how far Australian business has come since<br />
the Awards were first initiated in 1988.<br />
Australian business has well and truly made the leap to international best<br />
practice and quality is now a central plank of Australian business culture.<br />
Of course, the Australian Quality Council has played a critical role in all this.<br />
And I congratulate the Council for all it has done to build a quality culture, to<br />
create a culture of excellence throughout Australia.<br />
I think Australian business should also take great comfort in knowing that it<br />
has the wherewithal to match it with the best in the world and, in many cases,<br />
to be the best in the world.<br />
Of course, Government too has played its part.<br />
The many reforms we have introduced, and with which you are no doubt<br />
familiar, have opened Australia to the world and provided an environment in<br />
which business could flourish.<br />
As indeed it has.<br />
We've seen manufacturing exports grow by an average 15 per cent a year<br />
over the last decade.<br />
We've seen our exports of services, which place a premium on quality, grow<br />
by more than 10 per cent a year to now account for one fifth of our total<br />
exports. </p>
<p>2<br />
And, over the same period, we've seen our exports increase their total share<br />
of GDP from 14 to 22 per cent.<br />
These are all big achievements for which both business and government can<br />
take credit.<br />
Ten years ago, most would have seen achievements like these well beyond<br />
our grasp.<br />
And events like this one tonight would have been equally unthinkable.<br />
Back then, you would have been more likely to assemble these sorts of<br />
numbers for a national debate on how high the tariff wall should be.<br />
And the overwhelming majority would have argued the higher the better.<br />
Thankfully, that debate is now well behind us but it does have important<br />
lessons. I think one of the most important lessons it has taught us, and it's borne out in<br />
our export performance, is that we are right to have faith in ourselves in<br />
one sense, that's what tonight's awards are about.<br />
When we have faith in ourselves, we feel more optimistic about the future.<br />
And feeling optimistic, having a sense of the possibility of a better world,<br />
leads you to build that world.<br />
Whereas if you don't share the optimism, you won't see any point in making<br />
an effort.<br />
That's why when people are confronted by big changes, like the opening up<br />
of the Australian economy, they quickly fall into two camps.<br />
There are those who don't have faith in our ability to meet the new<br />
challenges. They fall back to supporting the status quo, or worse still, they advocate a<br />
retrograde return to a supposedly glorious past.<br />
These are the ones who once we start to grow strongly ask not " How can we<br />
sustain the growth?" but " When will it end?"<br />
These are the ones who when we have low inflation ask not " How can we<br />
keep it low?" but " How high will it go?" </p>
<p>And then there are the people, like those associated with the Australian<br />
quality movement, who believe in our capacity to ride the waves of change<br />
and to ride them well with excellence.<br />
These people realise that in an increasingly competitive world you are more<br />
likely to provide for those who come after you if you embrace the future not<br />
with fear and loathing but with confidence.<br />
And it's into this second camp that the majority of Australians are flooding<br />
there's a real sense of confidence about the place.<br />
It's a sense of confidence that we haven't had for a while.<br />
And, in terms of our place in the world, it's a sense of confidence that we've<br />
never had before.<br />
You can certainly feel it among the business community, and particularly on<br />
nights like this.<br />
And it's not a sense of confidence that is boastful or short-sighted.<br />
Nor is it of the sort paraded by the buffoons of the 1980s.<br />
Rather it is a quiet confidence, a quiet confidence in business's ability to<br />
produce world class products and services and the government's ability to<br />
run a low inflation economy.<br />
It's the sort of quiet confidence that leaves me feeling very optimistic about<br />
the country's future.<br />
And you can see it in the new class of business leaders that have emerged in<br />
recent times.<br />
You can see it in the leaders of small to medium sized firms identified in the<br />
McKinsey Emerging Exporters report and the LEK Intelligent Exports report<br />
leaders who had a vision of their companies as global exporters, who<br />
searched out new markets and who then set their companies on the path to<br />
winning those markets.<br />
You can also see it in the leaders in the big firms like Tubmemakers, Toyota<br />
and BHP Steel, firms that have picked up Australian Quality Awards in recent<br />
years.<br />
Tonight we honour all these leaders.<br />
But by " leaders" I don't mean just the chief executives, just those who come<br />
up to accept the awards, I mean those people that are committed to quality<br />
and excellence right throughout an organisation. 1 </p>
<p>It doesn't matter whether you are a CEO, a line manager or a stores assistant<br />
or for that matter a Prime Minister it's what you bring to the position<br />
rather than the position itself that really counts.<br />
Great organisations have great people throughout the organisation from<br />
the bottom to the top.<br />
And that's one reason why these Awards are so important they<br />
acknowledge excellence right across an organisation.<br />
Great organisations, be they firms or governments, will always welcome new<br />
challenges.<br />
And this is where APEC comes in we have to ensure that our world class<br />
products and services aren't denied access, particularly in the booming Asian<br />
markets.<br />
There's no point in having a quality product if you've got nowhere to sell it.<br />
What we are seeking to do with APEC will deliver significant long term<br />
benefits to many generations of Australians.<br />
We are looking to the forthcoming APEC Leaders' meeting in Bogor to make<br />
a commitment to free trade in the region by a particular date.<br />
Once the political will is expressed, business will factor it into their<br />
calculations and the export success of businesses like the ones we honour<br />
tonight will depend not on the extent of their access to the world's fastest<br />
growing markets but rather on the quality of their products and that's as it<br />
should be.<br />
Harmonised standards are a smaller part of the picture and, through APEC,<br />
we are already working to harmonise product standards and to secure mutual<br />
recognition of standards and conformance arrangements throughout the<br />
region.<br />
And as we seek to improve our external environment, we continue to do the<br />
same at home because we know that economic reform is a process of<br />
continuous improvement.<br />
That's why, in partnership with the States, we are putting in place a national<br />
competition policy that will create a single market for Australian goods and<br />
services. It's something that will be of major benefit to business and I hope those of you<br />
in business keep up the pressure on your State political leaders to embrace<br />
national competition. </p>
<p>Together with the reforms in electricity and gas, already well underway, the<br />
new national competition policy will give a huge boost to our international<br />
competitiveness. Let me finish up.<br />
Two weeks ago, when I launched our cultural policy statement, Creative<br />
Nation, I referred to the raw energy, skills and ambition of Australians as<br />
sources of great riches.<br />
From them flow the creativity, innovation and dedication needed to bring the<br />
value and quality of our products and services up to standards competitive<br />
with the best the world has to offer.<br />
Underlying Creative Nation and all the other government initiatives I have<br />
referred to tonight is one thing confidence in our ability to excel at what we<br />
do. It's as simple as that.<br />
There are few other developed countries that can match present day<br />
Australia. But we shouldn't be content with that, there's no excellence in parity.<br />
As I see it, the goal of this Labor Government is to ensure that in the 21st<br />
Century there is no better place in the world to live and do business than<br />
Australia. This is a highly ambitious goal but it is achievable.<br />
What's reassuring about the Australian Quality Awards is that they show we<br />
are a nation rich in excellence, that Australians have the ability to deliver on<br />
quality. Tonight's awards should give us every reason for approaching the new<br />
century with a quiet but deep-seated confidence.<br />
Thank you. </p>
