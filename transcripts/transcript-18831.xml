    <content><![CDATA[<p>Canberra</p>
<p>I congratulate Labor MP Anna Burke on her election tonight as Speaker of the House of Representatives.</p>
<p>Ms Burke has been dutifully presiding over the chamber in recent months, and has performed her role with extraordinary strength and grace in the most challenging of circumstances.</p>
<p>Ms Burke will be the second female Speaker of the House of Representatives, following in the footsteps of Joan Child who served as Speaker from 1986 to 1989.</p>
<p>Her appointment represents a historic day, with women now filling the roles of Speaker, Prime Minister and Governor-General.</p>
<p>I also commend Nationals MP Bruce Scott on his election as Deputy Speaker.</p>
