FOR PRESS : 1 a<br />
PM. No. 16, 1969<br />
APPOINTMENT OF GOVERNOR-GENERAL<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr John Gorton<br />
Her Majesty The Queen has graciously approved the<br />
appointment of a distinguished Australian, the Rt. Hon. Paul<br />
Hasluck, to be her Governor-General of, and representative in,<br />
Australia. He will take up the appointment when Lord Casey<br />
relinquishes his appointment at the end of April this year.<br />
In announcing this Her Majesty has also been graciously<br />
pleased to appoint Lord Casey to be a Knight of the Most Noble<br />
Order of the Garter and the Rt. Hon. Paul Hasluck to be a Knight<br />
Grand Cross of the Most Distinguished Order of St. Michael and<br />
St. George. Sir Paul Hasluck, a second generation Australian, has<br />
given long and devoted service to Australia in many fields of<br />
public endeavour. As a public servant he wats the first Australian<br />
permanent representative at the United Nations, as an historian<br />
he was entrusted with the task of writing the volumes of the<br />
governmental history of World War 11, and as a Minister of State<br />
he has carried out his duties with distinction. It is doubtful whether<br />
any other Australian is as well and favourably known to the Governments<br />
of overseas countries, particularly those countries nearest<br />
to our north. Lady Hasluck, a fifth generation Australian, is in her own<br />
right a distinguished Australian author whose books disclose<br />
painstaking research into, and understanding of, facets of Australia's<br />
early history. On behalf of the Government, I offer warm congratulations<br />
to Sir Paul and Lady Hasluck on his appointment which he will carry<br />
out with great dignity and honour.<br />
