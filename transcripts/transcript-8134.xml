TRANSCRIPT OF JOINT NEWS CONFERENCE WITH KEVAN GOSPER AND<br />
JOHN RALPH, NEW TAKANAWA PRINCE HOTEL, TOKYO<br />
18 SEPTEMBER 1990<br />
E OE PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, you must be bitterly<br />
disappointed. PM: Yes I am. Particularly for John Ralph, Kevan Gosper<br />
and all the team who've put so much work into it. They<br />
are the people up front. A marvellous team. There was<br />
an enormous amount of work done by hundreds and thousands<br />
of people behind the scenes. We honestly believed we had<br />
the best bid. We honestly believed that on merits, and<br />
given that the Games have only once in the history of the<br />
Games been in the Southern Hemisphere, we really thought<br />
that we could do it best and it was. the Southern<br />
Hemisphere's turn. But the people with the votes thought<br />
otherwise. JOURNALIST: Fair competition Mr Hawke?<br />
PM: of course you've got to accept it's a fair result.<br />
JOURNALIST: The Greeks are very upset and say the people<br />
with the money have won the Games.<br />
PM: Well the Greeks can speak for themselves. I don't<br />
know whether John Ralph or Kevan have got anything else<br />
to say, but that's-<br />
GOSPER: I think the Greeks would be very disappointed,<br />
like we are. But it was a five round vote and it was a<br />
clear majority eventually for Atlanta, and we must be<br />
good losers. I agree with the Prime Minister. We had<br />
first class leadership in John Ralph. We had enormous<br />
support and we had a Very good team. We could never have<br />
asked more from the Prime Minister. Now we're managing<br />
disappointment. We're disappointed for our colleagues in<br />
Melbourne. But we did our best. We had a very good bid<br />
and we had a very good argument. The decision I think<br />
finally rested on whether the members felt that Athens<br />
could confidently put on a Centennial Games. And their<br />
answer was no and therefore the United States looked the<br />
most secure option. That's the best conclusion I can<br />
come to. </p>
<p>2<br />
JOURNALIST: How did we go in the voting?<br />
G OSPER: We stayed in until the third round. In the<br />
second round we were actually coming second. But an<br />
astonishing thing happened in the third round. We fell<br />
back and were separated by one vote between ourselves and<br />
Toronto. Had we survived that round it may have been a<br />
different outcome, but I doubt it. I think finally what<br />
showed out was that Athens held in there until finally<br />
the members decided it wasn't a secure enough decision.<br />
They must have believed that the Americans could deliver<br />
a That's all I can conclude. But I mean there will<br />
be a lot of analysis going on. we're just disappointed<br />
for everybody who supported us.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, will we be having a go just like<br />
this for the year 2000?<br />
PM: That's for the Australian Olympic Federation to<br />
consider.<br />
GOSPER: And tonight's not to answer that. Thanks Prime<br />
Minister.<br />
JOURNALIST: So what have you got to say to all those<br />
people in Melbourne who've gathered tonight in the<br />
squares and Flinders Street Station?<br />
PM: Thanks for your support and your enthusiasm. All we<br />
can say together is we did our best and we're sorry we<br />
couldn't deliver.<br />
GOSPER: Absolutely. And I hope we can be good losers.<br />
We mustn't take anything away from Atlanta.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Ralph, can we get your reaction?<br />
RALPH: We have to abide by the decision of the members<br />
of the International Olympic Committee. We're all very<br />
disappointed. I'm disappointed for those people back<br />
home because so many, you know, thousands of people have<br />
put their backs behind this. We did our best. I think<br />
the bid itself was a strong bid. Our presentation today<br />
was clearly it got a great reception. But it didn't<br />
come through in the votes.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, would you like to see this great<br />
spirit that was shown today by the Australians in some of<br />
the other endeavours that we're seeking like<br />
PM: Well Australians when they do pull together they are<br />
marvellous. It was great to see the spirit today. I'd<br />
like to see it as often as possible. But you can't<br />
expect that Australians are always going to be united on<br />
everything. We couldn't even get some of the people we<br />
thought should've supported us supporting us. </p>
<p>49 1 3<br />
GOSPER: I'd just like to say that Australia was in one<br />
of the biggest world competitions in history. That's not<br />
bad to be in there for three rounds out of five. We<br />
wanted to win. We believed we'd win. We didn't win.<br />
But we were in the world competition.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you going back for 2000?<br />
GOSPER: I wouldn't dare to answer that tonight. This is<br />
not the time to answer it. I think we just deal with the<br />
result today. We've got time to think about that later.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is any city in Australia big enough to host<br />
the Olympic Games?<br />
GOSPER: Melbourne. Sydney.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Gosper, what's the attraction of the<br />
American television networks? Was that an important<br />
factor in the votes?<br />
GOSPER: I can't account for the other members' minds on<br />
this. I suppose financial strengths and administrative<br />
capacity and organisation of people was what finally<br />
counted in the Americans' favour versus Athens. But I<br />
believe that we were every bit as good in organisation<br />
ability and in terms of the team and the capacity<br />
But we can't detract from the result.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, have you got anything to say to<br />
Senator Peter Walsh tonight?<br />
PM: I guess he'll be celebrating.<br />
JOURNALIST: What will you be doing this evening sir?<br />
PM: As I say, I'll be hitting the mineral water hard.<br />
GOSPER: We'll be alright. We just want to handle it<br />
with dignity. OK.<br />
ends </p>
