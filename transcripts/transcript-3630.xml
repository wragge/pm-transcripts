SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER,<br />
THE HON, E. G, WHITLAM, 0, C. M. P.<br />
TO THE TASMANIAN STATE A, L. P CONFERENCE<br />
I_ AUNCESTON, 23 FE3,. PUARY L975<br />
JUST OVER TWO WEEKS AGO WE ENDED A SUCCESSFUL<br />
NATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE PARTY IN TERRIGAL. THAT<br />
CONFERENCE REKINDLED OUR SPIRITS AND STRENGTHENED OUR<br />
DETERMINATION TO CARRY ON WITH LABOR'S PROGRAM AND PUT<br />
US BACK ON THE ROAD TO VICTORY. YOU WILL REMEMBER THAT<br />
OUR OPPONENTS PREDICTED ALL SORTS OF DISUNITY AND<br />
DISSENSION IN TERRIGAL. IT WAS TO BE A CONFERENCE<br />
STEEPED IN GLOOM AND WRACKED BY CRISIS. AND OF COURSE<br />
IT WAS NOTHING OF THE SORT, AT TERRIGAL WE RALLIED<br />
OUR STRENGTH AND GATHERED OUR RESOURCES TO MEET WHATEVER<br />
CHALLENGES, WHATEVER THREATS, WHATEVER OBSTACLES MAY<br />
FACE US . IN THE MONTHS AND YEARS AHEAD. FOR WE CAN NO<br />
LONGER HAVE ANY ILLUSIONS ABOUT OUR OPPONENTS. THE<br />
EVENTS IN THE TWO SHORT WEEKS SINCE TERRIGAL HAVE SHOWN<br />
ONCE AGAIN HOW DESPERATE AND UNSCRUPULOUS THEY ARE. THEY<br />
WILL NOT ACCEPT THE UMPIRE'S VERDICT AND THEY WILL NOT<br />
ABIDE BY THE RULES OF THE GAME. ./ 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
I TOLD THE DELEGATES AT TERRIGAL:<br />
" WE NOW KNOW THAT OUR OPPONENTS WILL TEAR UIP THE<br />
RULE BOOK AND WRITE NEW RULES WHENEVER THEY THINK IT<br />
SUITS THEM." I HOW TRUE THOSE WORDS WERE SHOWN TO BE,<br />
WITHIN DAYS THE LIBERAL PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH WALES<br />
HAD TORN ANOTHER PAGE FROM THE RULE BOOK. WE SAW THE<br />
LENGTHS TO WHICH THE LIBERALS WOOLD GO TO OVERTHROW AN.<br />
ELECTED GOVERNMENT, TO FRUSTRATE ITS PROGRAM, TO OBSTRUCT<br />
THE PEOPLE IS WILL. WE KNOW THIS, AND IN EVERYTHING WE<br />
DO, IN EVERYTHING WE SAY, WE MUST KEEP THIS. FACT , IN MIND.<br />
OUR OPPONENTS ARE OUT TO DESTROY US BY ANY MEANS THEY<br />
CAN. THE COMING YEAR WILL PUT ENORMOUS STRAINS ON OUR<br />
RESOURCES, OUR ORGANISATION, OUR LOYALTY AND OUR VIGILANCE.<br />
THIS TASMANIAN CONFERENCE IS THE FIRST STATE<br />
CONFERENCE SINCE WE GATHERED OUR FORCES AND REDEDICATED<br />
OUR EFFORTS'IN TERRIGAL. IT WILL CARRY FORWARD THE<br />
MOMENTUM AND THE GREAT SPIRIT OF RESOLVE WHICH TERRIGAL<br />
SET IN TRAIN.-OUR PARTY HAS A I) NIlAcqtRFITh IN<br />
TASMANIA AND A REMARKABLE HOLD ON THE CO) NFIDENCE OF<br />
TASMANIAN VOTERS. WIE HOLD ALL FIVE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVE<br />
SEATS IN THI. S STATE. WE HAVE FIVE LABOR SENATORS. WE HAVE<br />
A VIGOROUS STATE LABOR GOVERNMENT. ALL THESE ARE'TREMENDOUS<br />
ASSETS AND A GREAT SOURCE OF STRENGTH AND CONFIDENCE FOR<br />
THE PARTY AT THE STATE AND NATIONAL LEVELS. WE MUST'<br />
DEFEND IT RESOLUTELY. I WANT THIS CONFERENCE FOR THE GOOD<br />
OF THE WHOLE LABOR MOVEMENT -TO'CONSOLIDATE OUR UNITY AND<br />
SAFEGUARD AND STRENGTHEN OUR DOMINANCE IN THIS STATE. ia/ 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
LET'S BE QUITE CLEAR WHAT OUR OPPONENTS<br />
ARE TRYING TO DO. THEY WANT TO DRAG THIS COUNTRY BACK<br />
BACK TO THE STAGNATION AND COMPLACENCY THAT WE BROUGHT<br />
TO AN-END AFTER 23 YEARS OF CONSERVATIVE RULE. THEY WANT<br />
TO MAKE AUSTRALIA SAFE FOR THE FANATICS, THE STATES<br />
RIGHTERS, THE REACTIONARIES, THE VESTED INTERESTS, THE<br />
OVERSEAS COMPANIES WHO HAD IT SO GOOD FOR SO LONG.<br />
THEY WANT TO TEAR DOWN OUR PLANS FOR BETTER SCHOOLS, OUR<br />
PLANS FOR CHILDREN, MIGRANTS, WIDOWS, MOTHERS, ABORIGINES<br />
OUR PLANS FOR UNIVERSAL HEALTH INSURANCE, FOR NATIONAL<br />
COMPENSATION, FOR DECENT CITIES WITH DECENT TRANSPORT,<br />
THE CLOSER THESE GOALS COME TO FRUITION THE. MORE DESPERATE<br />
THEY ARE TO DESTROy THEM, THE NEARER WE GET TO MEDIBANK<br />
OR A PROPER LEGAL AID SERVICE, OR AN EFFECTIVE' PETROLEUM<br />
AND MINERALS AUTHORITY, THE MORE FRANTIC AND RUTHLESS ARE<br />
THEIR METHODS. ANY TACTICS WILL DO FROM OBSTRUCTION<br />
IN THE SENATE TO Oi1STRUCTION I,'' THE COJRT3<br />
OF COURSE THEY ARE COY ABOUT WHAT THEY<br />
WOULD DO THEMSELVES. ONLY LAST WEEK, IN AN UNGUARDED<br />
MOMENTMR. SNEDDEN LET SLIP ONE OF THE LIBERALS.' LESS<br />
ATTRACTIVE PROMISES THE RESTORATION OF FEES FOR<br />
TERTIARY EDUCATION AND A CUTBACK IN STUDENT ALLOWANCES.<br />
THAT'S THE SORT OF LIBERAL ECONOMY MEASURE THE YOUTH OF<br />
AUSTRALIA COULD EXPECT. BUT THE LIBERAL AXE WOULD FALL<br />
MUCH WIDER THAN THAT. IT WOULD CHOP RUTHLESSLY INTO THE<br />
CONSUMPTION AND LIVING STANDARDS OF THE POOR AND<br />
UNORGANISED. WE KNOW WHO WOULD PAY THE PRICE FOR THE<br />
RESTORATION OF SO-CALLED LIBERAL ' PROSPERITY' EVERY WAGE<br />
EARNER, EVERY EMPLOYEE, EVERY PENSIONER, EVERY WORKING MAN<br />
AND HIS FAMILY. </p>
<p>-4-<br />
HERE IN TASMANIA YOU HAVE HAD VIVID EVIDENCE IN<br />
RECENT WEEKS OF THE CONTEMPT WITH WHICH OUR OPPONENTS<br />
TREAT THIS STATE, TASMANIA HAS BECOME THE LATEST<br />
COCKPIT FOR COALITION SQUABBLES AND PERSONAL FEUDS, THE<br />
HAI-RED AND BITTERNESS AMONG THE FORCES OF THE RIGHT IS<br />
NEVER SO EVIDENT AS WHEN THEY FIGHT AMONG THEMSELVES.<br />
FIRST WE HAD .' ENATOR TOWNLEY SHEDDING HIS THREADBARE<br />
MAiNTLE OF INDEPENDENCE AND EMERGING IN HIS OLD LIBERAL<br />
COLOURS. FOR THIS. IT SEEMS, HE WILL BE REWARDED WITH<br />
FIRST PLACE ON THE NEXT LIBERAL SENATE TICKET, I CAN<br />
ONLY SAY THAT HE HAS MANAGED 1O CONCEAL HIS INDEPENDENCE<br />
VERY WELL IN RECENF MONTHS.<br />
THEN WE HAD THE CELEBRATED VISIT BY BJELKE-PETERSEN<br />
TO TASMANIA IN AN ATTEMPT TO RESUSCITATE THE NATIONAL<br />
PARTY. HE AND , R A'ITHONY MADE IT A TWO-NAN CRUSADE.<br />
THEY HAD A DUSTY RECEPTION FROM THE LIBERAL LEADER IN THIS<br />
STATE, WHO ACCUSED THE COUNTRY PARTY OF " EMPIRE-BUILDING" lei<br />
AND WENT ON AT LENGTH ABOUT ITS " UNSAVOURY PAST".<br />
BJELKE-PETERSEN SPENT SEVERAL DAYS IN TASMANIA PROCLAIMING<br />
THE BENEFITS HIS PARTY WOULD BRING. TifEI HE RETURNED TO<br />
QUEENSLAND AND THREATENED THE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT WITH<br />
REPRISALS UNLESS THEY STOPPED. BUYING BEEF FROM TASMANIA,<br />
YOU WILL REMEMBER HIS WORDS ON AN INTERVIEW ON THE ABC<br />
LAST MONDAY: " JAPAN SHOULD THINK IN TERMS OF THEIR GOOD<br />
FRIENDS AND GOOD CUSTOMERS IN THIS AREA WHERE THEY BUY<br />
THESE VAST QUANTITIES OF COAL THAT IS SO VITAL TO THEM<br />
THEY SHOULD THINK OF US TO BUY THEIR MEAT, NOT NEW<br />
ZEALAND AND NOT TASMANIA. THAT IS THE MESSAGE I'M<br />
TRYING TO GET OVER TO THEM.", </p>
<p>AND THAT'S THE BJELKE-PETERSEN MESSAGE TO<br />
TASMANIA: JAPAN SHOULDN'T BUY BEEF FROM FOREIGN<br />
COUNTRIES LIKE TASMANIA AND NEW ZEALAND: I MUST SAY<br />
I WAS RELIEVED WHEN IR SNEDDEN CONDEMNED THE 9UEENSLAND<br />
PREMIER IN THE SAME, BRAVE FORTHRIGHT AND PRINCIPLED FASHION<br />
THAT HE CONDEMNED THE LEWIS TACTICS IN NEW SOUTH ' JALES.<br />
SO THESE ARE THE MEN WHO OPPOSE US. WE ARE<br />
DEALING WITH MEN WHO WILL SCRAP THE RULES WHEN IT<br />
SUITS THEM, MEN WHO WILL CHEERFULLY THREATEN THE WHOLE BASIS<br />
OF OUR DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM, MEN WHO CARE NOTHING FOR THE<br />
SENSITIVE CONVENTIONS OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE., MEN WHO WILL<br />
JEOPARDISE AUSTRALIA'S STANDING ABROAD FOR<br />
A QUICK POLITICAL ADVANTAGE, MEN TOO WEAK TO BRING THEIR<br />
FOLLOWERS INTO LINE OR DEFEND A COURSE OF ACTION WHICH<br />
THEY KNOW IS RIGHT.<br />
WIE HAVE HAD ANOTHER GOOD EXAMPLE OF THEIR DESPERATION1<br />
IN RECENT WEEKS. THE LIBERAL GOVERNMENT OF VICTORIA,<br />
CASTING OFF THE TRENDY IMAGE WHICH ONCE SERVED ITS<br />
PURPOSES, HAS MOUNTED A HIGH COURT CHALLENGE TO TWO OF<br />
OUR CURREHI PROGRAMS THE REGIONAL EMPLOYMENT DFVELOPMENT<br />
SCHEME AND THE AUSTRALIAN ASSISTANCE PLAN. l OF COURSE<br />
THESE PROGRAMS ARE OF GREAT IMPORTANCE IN THEMSELVES,<br />
AS PIONEER ATTEMPTS TO INVOLVE LOCAL COMMUNITIES IN<br />
EFFORTS TO IMPROVE THEIR WELFARE. BUT THE VICTORIAN<br />
CHALLENGE, SUPPORTED BY OTHER LIBERAL STATES, DOESN'T JUST<br />
JEOPARDISE LABOR'S PROGRAMS: IT THREATENS LEGISLATION ON<br />
A RANGE OF MATTERS WHICH HAS STOOD FOR 22 YEARS OR MORE. </p>
<p>IT WILL JEOPARDISE SCHEMES WHICH WERE ORIGINALLY<br />
AUTHORISED BY THE PREVIOUS LIBERAL-COUNTRY PARTY GOVERNMENTSGRANTS<br />
TO THE BLOOD TRANSFUSION SERVICE, PROJECTS IN THE<br />
FIELD OF MEDICAL RESEARCH AND CHILD CARE, PAYMENTS UNDER<br />
THE NATIONAL APPRENTICESHIP SCHEME, GRANTS TO THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN COUNCIL OF SOCIAL SERVICE.<br />
IT'S WOR-DiLISTING THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT<br />
INITIATIVES WHOSE EXISTENCE OF LEGAL STANDING ARE<br />
THREATENED BY THIS CHALLENGE. THEY INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING:<br />
ASSISTANCE FOR ISOLATED CHILDREN, PRE-SCHOOL TEACHER<br />
EDUCATION ALLOWANCE 1 COMMONWEALTH TECHNICAL SCHOLARSHIPS,'<br />
GRANTS UNDER THE NEW PROGRAM FOR CHILD CARE AND PRE-SCHOOL<br />
EDUCATION, NATIONAL APPRENTICESHIP SCHEMES, GRANTS TO<br />
COMMUNITY-AGENCIES INVOLVED IN MIGRAN'T WELFARE, LOCAL AID<br />
FOR ABORIGINALCOMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT, PROTECTION OF<br />
ABORIGINAL SACRED SITES, ABORIGINAL COMMUNITY ENTERPR-ISES1<br />
AGED PERSONS' HOMES AND HOSTELS, SHELTERED EMPLOYMENT<br />
ASSISTANCE, HANDICAPPED CHILDREN'I S ASSISTANCE, HOMELESS<br />
PERSONS' ASSISTANCE, MEALS ON WHEELS, HOME NURSING<br />
SUBSIDIES, NURSING HOMES IASSISTANCE AND MANY MORE.<br />
IN ALL, SOME 56 SEPARATE PROGRAMS OF ASSISTANCE FROM THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT COULD BE AFFECTED IF THE CHALLENGE<br />
SUCCEEDS. IN THE'LONG HISTORY OF LIBERAL OBSTRUCTION,<br />
THERE COULD BE NO BETTER EXAMPLE OF FANATICISM AND<br />
BLOODYMINDEDNESS THAN A LEGAL CHALLENGE WHICH THREATENS,<br />
NOT ONLY LABOR PROGRAMS, BUT MANY OF THE THINGS THE LIBERALS<br />
STARTED THEMSELVES. </p>
<p>WHEN WE LOOK BACK ON THE MANY REFORMS AND<br />
ACHIEVEMENTS UNDER A LABOR GOVERNMENT, THERE IS ONE<br />
THING WE CAN LOOK TO WITH THE GREATEST PRIDE. WE HAVE<br />
BROUGHT ABOUT A MARKED SHIFT IN THE WEALTH OF THIS<br />
COUNTRY. REAL LIVING STANDARDS FOR THE WAGE-EARNERESPECIALLY<br />
THOSE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCALE -HAVE BEEN<br />
RAISED AS NEVER BEFORE. THIS FACT MORE THAN ANYTHING<br />
ELSE THIS RAPID INCREASE IN THE SHARE OF GNP GOING<br />
TO WAGES AND SALARIES 15 INTOLERABLE TO OUR OPPONENTS.<br />
IN OUR FIRST TWO YEARS IN OFFICE AVERAGE WEEKLY EARNINGS<br />
INCREASED By 40% 7 AGAINST AN INCREASE IN THE CONSUMER PRICE<br />
INDEX OF 30%. MINIMUM AWARD RATES FOR MEN-INCREASED BY<br />
47% AND FOR WOMEN BY NO LESS THAN 70%. REAL AVERAGE<br />
WEEKLY EARNINGS AFTER TAX HAVE GONE UP<br />
ISHALL HAVE MORE TO SAY ABOUT THE LONG-TERM<br />
IMPLICATION8 Of THIS TREND, BUT THE FACT REMAINS THAT* THE<br />
LABOR GOVERNMENT HAS LOOKED AFTER THE OPLE W'HO NEED Us.<br />
AND THERE IS ANOTHER THING; WE HAVE LOOKED AFTER THOSE WHO<br />
CAN'T SPEAK UP FOR THEMSELVES. KNOW THE MIDDLE CLASS<br />
AND THE LABOUR UNIONS CAN PROTECT. THEIR INTERESTS BECAUSE,<br />
IN THE LAST RESORT, THEY CAN ORGANISEi THEIR STRENGTHS AND<br />
ARTICULATE THEIR DEMANDS. THE ABORIGINES, THE MIGRANTS"<br />
THE WIDOWS, THE DESERTED CHILDREN, THE PENSIONERS, ARE<br />
NOT SO FORTUNATE. THEY ARE NOT SO VOCAL. THEY ARE NOT<br />
SO ORGANISED. THEY NEED A GOVERNMENT THAT WILL HEED<br />
THEIR PROBLEMS AND SAFEGUARD THEIR NEEDS. AND IT IS BECAUSE<br />
WE HAVE DONE SO THAT VAST NUMBERS OF FORGOTTEN'PEOPLE,<br />
NEGLECTED AND UNDERPRIVILEGED PEOPLE, HAVE HAD A BETTER DEAL. </p>
<p>-8-<br />
THE LIBERALS KNOW THIS. AND THEY KNOW WHEN<br />
PEOPLE FEEL THE BENEFITS OF OUR PROGRAMS, THE REA\ L GAINS<br />
IN THEIR LIVING STANDARDS, ALL THE LIBERAL TALK ABOUT<br />
CENTRALISM, STATE RIGHTS AND THE CONSTITUTION WILL BE<br />
REVEALED FOR THE CLAPTRAP IT IS. YOU HEAR A LOT ABOUT<br />
LABOR ATTACKS ON THE FEDERAL SYSTEM.* HERE IN TASMANIA<br />
THE SMALLEST STATE, YOU HAVE A SPECIAL PLACE IN THE<br />
FEDERAL SYSTEM, A SPECIAL CONCERN TO ENSURE THAT THE<br />
SYSTEM OPERATES TO YOUR ADVANTAGE. IASK: WHO IS<br />
MORE CONCERNED TO MAKE THE SYSTEM WORK THOSE.: WHO WANT<br />
TO PRESERVE ITS MANIFEST INADEQUACIES OR THOSE WHO WORK TO<br />
IMPROVE IT? IHAVE NO DOUBT THAT THE FEDERAL SYSTEM<br />
CAN WORK BUT IKNOW IT WILL WORK BEST WHEN WE ESTABLISH<br />
THE RIGHT BALANCE BETWEEN THE THREE TIERS OF GOVERNMENTLOCAL1<br />
STATE AND NATIONAL. THAT IS WHAT WE ARE DOING.<br />
THE LESSON OF THE PAST DECADE THE LESSON TO BE DRAWN<br />
FROM OUR OWN'ELECTORAL SUCCESSES -, IS THAT MANY OF OUR'<br />
PRESSING PROBLEMS DEPEND ON A GREATER INVOLVEMENT BY THE<br />
NATIONAL GOVERNMENT.-I HAVE POINTED OUR THAT IN THE TWO<br />
AUSTRALIAN STATES WITH THE LARGEST POPULATIONS, IT WAS<br />
OBVIOUS THAT ONLY THROUGH THE INVOLVEMENT OF THE NATIONAL<br />
GOVERNMENT COULD THE PEOPLE BE PROVIDED WITH ESSENTIAL PUBLIC<br />
SERVICES LIKE. HEALTH, TRANSPORT AND EDUCATION. INIHE<br />
STATES WITH THE LARGEST AREAS ONLY THE. NATIONAL GOVERNMENT<br />
COULD SAFEGUARD AUSTRALIAN CONTROL. OF. THE VAST NEW NATURAL<br />
RESOURCES DISCOVERED IN THE LAST 10 YEARS. 841/ 9 </p>
<p>-9-<br />
IN TASMANIA, WHO BUT THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENJT COULD DO<br />
ANYTHING ABOUT YOUR SHIPPING AND RAILWAYS? ONLY AN<br />
A\ USTR~ ALIAN LABoi? GOVLRiimiFNT HAS THE WILL, THlE RESOURCES,<br />
f 1-IE AUTH~ OiRITY TO-DEVELOP THF: A. N. L. ArmIF THE_ NATIONAL<br />
RAILWAYS. ONLY THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT CA N RELIEVE YOUR<br />
STATE GOVERNMENT OF THE CRIPPLING COSTS-OF ITS RAILWAY<br />
SERVICES. AND WE HAVE MADE GREAT PROGRESS TOWARDS THAT<br />
GOAL-IN THE PAST FEW DAYS.<br />
LABOR HAS-A GOOD RECORD IN TASMANIA -A RECORD OF<br />
POSITIVE ACHIEVEMENT AND WE SHOULD MAKE-SURE THE PEOPLE<br />
ARE AWARE OF IT. CERTAINLY WE HAVE A S PECIAL PROBLEM<br />
WITH UNEMPLOYMENT WHICH IS HIGHER THAN THE NATIONAL<br />
-AVERAGE. BUT OUR MEASURES HAVE BEEN DESIGNED TO TACKLE<br />
UNEMPLOYMENT NATr 0ONALLY AS WELL AS REGIONALLY. THE<br />
GOVERNMENT HAS DONE MORE FOR TASMANIA THAN ANY GOVERNMENT<br />
BEFORE US. WE HAVE BEEN UNSTINTINGLY GENEROUS IN OUR<br />
FINANCIAL PAYMENTS. OUR GENERAL PURPOSE REVENUE4<br />
ASSISTANCE To TASMANIA-AMOUNTED TO $ 131 MILLION IN OUR<br />
LAST BUDGET 31.6% MORE THAN 1973-74, SPECIAL PURPOSE<br />
PAYMENTS FOR UNIVERSITIES, HOSPITALS AND THE LIKE HAVE<br />
SHOW4N AN EVEN MORE SPECTACULAR RISE. THEY AMOUNTED TO<br />
$ 109 MILLION IN OUR LAST BUDGET 80% MORE THAN THE YEAR<br />
BEFORE. AND BEAR IN MIND THAT OUR PAYMENTS IN rHE<br />
PREVIOLUS BUDGET WERE THEMSELVES FAR IN. EXCESS OF ANYTHING<br />
PROVIDED BY OUR PREDECESSORS. SO WE HAVE NOTHING TO<br />
APOLOGISE FOR IN OUR FINANCIAL TREATMENT OF TASMANIA.<br />
EVERY MAN, WOMAN AND CHILD IN THIS STATE RECEIVES AN<br />
ESTIMATED $ 790 PER HEAD FROM THiE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT<br />
COMPARED WITH $ q66 PER HEAD FOP. THE SIX STATES COMBINED. </p>
<p>Ah) THESE FIGURES TAKE NO ACCOUNT OF THFI ADDITIONAL<br />
FUNDS GRANTED TO [ ASMANIA AT THE PREMIER'S CONFERENCE<br />
LAST FRIDAY WEEK,<br />
THE MESSAGE WE MUST KEEP IN MIND IS -THIS: WE MUST<br />
NEVER ALLOW THE THUGS AND WRECKERS IN THE OPPOSITION TO<br />
RATTLE US OR SHAKE OUR NERVE, THERE IS A CONSTANT ATTEMPT<br />
TO DO SO IN THE MEDIA, FROM THE MORE STRIDENT VESTED<br />
INTERESTS, FROM THEIR SUPPORTERS IN PARLIAMENT, I KNOW WITH<br />
OUR PROBLEMS OFINFLATION AND UNEMPLOYMENT, AND WITH<br />
THESE CONSTANT THREATS OF AN ELECTION, WE CAN EASILY LOSE<br />
HEART. BUT THE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE KNOW THAT WE ARE NOT<br />
ALONE WITH INFLATION AND UNEMPLOYMENT THEY KNOW THAT ALL<br />
THE WORLD'S MIXED ECONOMIES, ALL THE WORLD'S INDUSTRIALISED<br />
COUNTRIES, ALL OUR TRADING PARTNERS ARE SHARING THE SAME<br />
EXPERIENCE. MANY OF THEM ARE MUCH WORSE OFF THAN WE ARE.<br />
INDEED, ON MY RECENT VISIT TO EUROPE I CONCLUDED THATAUSTRALIA'S<br />
ECONOMY IS BASICALLY MUCH SOUNDER THAN THOSE<br />
OF MOST OF THE COUNTRIES I VISITED, 1lO SENSIBLE PERSON,<br />
IN AUSTRALIA OR ABROAD, IMAGINES FOR A MOMENT THAT<br />
UNFMPLOYMENT OR INFLATIO14 WOULD 12E ANY iETTIER IN AUSTRAL! A<br />
TODAM UNDER A SNEDDEN-/\ N[ HONY GOVERNMENT. THEY WOULD<br />
ALMOST CERTAINLY BE WORSE, MR ANTHONY WOULD SEE THAT PETROL<br />
PRICES WERE A GOOD DEAL HIGHER FOR A START. MANY OF OUR<br />
MEASURES TO RELIEVE UNEMPLOYMENT AND RESTRAIN PRICES<br />
THE THE R. ED. S. SCHEME, WAGE IJDEXATION WOULD<br />
BE SCRAPPED OUT OF HAND, .,/ ii1 </p>
<p>Il-<br />
THELRE I S GOOD R FASOH TO H OPE TIHAT OUR ECONOMI C<br />
CONDITIONS WILL SOON BEGIN TO IMPROVE. lIN SAYING THIS<br />
I DONAl WANT TO RAISE UNDUE HOPES OR GENER~ ATE COMPLACENCY.<br />
WIE LIVE IN. TIMES OF RAPID AND SOMETIMES UNPREDICTABLE<br />
CHANGCE, BUT I AM CONFID: ENT THAT OUR RECENT CCONOMIC<br />
MEASURES WILL SHORTLY SHOW THEIR EFFECTS. LATER THIS<br />
YEAR WE CAN EXPECT SOME MARKED IMPROVEMENT IN THE<br />
LACOUJR MARKET. THE IMPORTANT THING FOR US AND OUR PARTY<br />
SUPPORTERS TO BEAR IN MMII) ISA HAT THIS IMPROVEMENT CAN<br />
ONLY BE SUSTAINED IF WAGE-EARNERS EXERCISE RESPONSIBILITY<br />
INJ THEIR PAY CLAIMS. IKNOW THERE ARE SECTIONS OF THE<br />
LABOR MOVEMENT WHO ARE RELUCTANT TO FACE THIS FACT.<br />
THEY ARE QUITE OBSTINATE IN IGNORING IT. I SHALL NJOT<br />
MINCE WORDS. THE TRUTH IS THAT WE CANNOT AFFORD WAGE<br />
GAINS IN THE YEAR AHEAD LIK( E THOSE IN THE YEAR JUST PAST.<br />
IDON'T TAKE ANY PLEASURE IN POINTING THIS OUT, ISTATE<br />
IT AS A FACT. WAGE EARNERS HAVE MADE UNPRECENDENTED GAINS<br />
IN THE PAST YEAR. IF WE WANT TO PRESERVE THE REAL<br />
VAL. UE OF THOSE GAINS, IF WE WANT TO BUIlD ON THE<br />
ACHIEVEMENTS WE HAVE MADE TOGETHER, IF WE WANT TO PREPARE<br />
THE GOUND FOR FURTIIER GAINS IN FUTURE YEARS, WE CANNOT<br />
PUSH THlE SYSTEM TOO FAR TOO FAST. IF &amp; I OVERLOAD<br />
OUR DEMANDS AT PRESENT WE RUN THE RISK OF CANCELLING<br />
OUT OUR GAINS. WE WILL CERTAINLY POSE A THREAT TO<br />
THE GOhVERNMENT'S SURVIVAL WHENEVER THE IJEXT ELECTION<br />
COMES. </p>
<p>-12-<br />
DON'T FORGET THAT OUR TAX CUTS ARE MAKING IT<br />
MUCH EASIER FOR THE WORKING MAN AND GIVING THE GREATEST<br />
BENEFIT TO WAGE EARNERS WHO NEED IT MOST. OUR OPPONENTS HAVE<br />
BEEN IN A LATHER OF INDIGNATION ABOUT SOME OF THE LURKS<br />
AND CONCESSIONS WE HAVE CUT. TAKE OUR REDUCTION IN EDUCATION<br />
EXPENSES, A DEDUCTION OF $ 400 BENEFITS A MINORITY OF PEOPLE<br />
WHO LEAST NEED HELP. ALWAYS WITH SUCH CONCESSIONS THE<br />
MAN ON THE HIGHEST INCOME RECEIVES THE GREATEST BENEFIT.<br />
I SUPPOSE THAT OF ALL THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM I WOULD HAVE<br />
THE HIGHEST SALARY. I COULD -AFFORD TO SPEND MORE ON MY<br />
CHILDREN'S EDUCATION THAN ANYONE ELSE. WOULD ANYONE<br />
CONSIDER IT JUST AND PROPER ON THAT ACCOUNT THAT I SHOULD<br />
ALSO GET THE GREATEST BENEFIT IN TAX CONCESSIONS FROM<br />
MY EDUCATION EXPENSES?<br />
TASMANIA HAS HAD AMPLE PROOF OF THE GOVERNMENT'S<br />
CONCERN FOR ITS PEOPLE. WE HAVE GIVE! J SPECIA. L IFLP TO<br />
IASIANIA'S AGRICU! LTURAL INDUSTRIES AND MADE SPECIAL EFFORTS<br />
TO IMPROVE TRANSPORT LINKS WITH THE MAINLAND. OUR RESPONSE<br />
TO THE TASMAN BRIDGE DISASTER WAS PROMPT, EFFICIENT AND<br />
GENEROUS. THE OBJECT OF ALL OUR REFOPMS, ALL OUR<br />
PROGRAMS, . IS TO ENSURE THAT THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR AUSTRALIANS<br />
TO LEAD RICH AND FULFILLING LIVES ARE MADE MORE ABUNDANT<br />
AhD MORE EQUAL. IN TASMANIA YOU FACE SPECIAL PROBLEMS<br />
BECAUSE OF YOUR STATE'S SIZE AND ISOLATION. NO ONE IN<br />
TASMANIA Si OUIlD SUFFER ON THAT ACCOUNF. I BE IFVE ', OUR<br />
CONFEREI. CE W; L, BRING ; S CLOSER in THE ACHIEVEMENT OF OUR<br />
GOALS, AND ENA. BLE OUR TWO LABOR ' iOVEPr'MEN i S IN HOBART AND<br />
CANDERRA TO CO-OPERATE IN FURTHER EFFORTS FOR THE oENEFIT<br />
OF TiE PEOi'L. E OF TASMANIA AND OUR NATION.<br />
