PRIME MINISTER<br />
EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
CONFEDERATION OF AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRY<br />
CANBERRA 27 NOVEMBER 1986<br />
Ladies and gentlemen.<br />
I must start by thanking you, Ken, for your words of welcome<br />
tonight. Since this is your last official function before<br />
handing over the presidency, it's appropriate that I place<br />
on record my Government's profound respect for and<br />
appreciation of your work for the CAI. Under your<br />
, presidency, the Confederation of Australian Industry has<br />
made a significant contribution to the economic debate in<br />
this country.<br />
And let me add a personal note, since Ken and I go back a<br />
long way. In fact we shared a memorable Duke of Edinburgh<br />
award which took us to Canada in 1962. So, Ken, 24 years<br />
on: thank you and good luck.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
We're now in the last week of November, and with the end of<br />
the year in sight this seemed a good time and an excellent<br />
audience for a review of the economy and a look forward to<br />
the prospects awaiting us in 1987.<br />
This is no ordinary end-of-year stocktake because 1986 has<br />
been no ordinary year.<br />
For all of us, those of us in industry, those of us in<br />
business, those of us in government, it has been a year of<br />
very great difficulty certainly, in terms of economic<br />
management, in terms of international adversity, in terms of<br />
adjustment to changed circumstances, perhaps the most<br />
difficult and turbulent for many years.<br />
And to the ordinary Australian citizen in the workplace, in<br />
the home, on the farm, some of the events of the year must<br />
have seemed strange and even threatening because so much<br />
of what has been happening has no recent precedent in<br />
Australian experience.<br />
Unfamiliar forces have flowed in from overseas one after the<br />
other in a turbulent procession which dramatically speeded<br />
up the.-process of economic change in Australia. </p>
<p>1986 was the year in which the trans-Atlantic agricultural<br />
trade war turned white-hot at the expense of Australian<br />
farmers. It was the year in which OPEC's discipline finally cracked<br />
and oil prices plummeted to their lowest levels in 13 years<br />
bringing prices of related commodities important to<br />
Australia down with them.<br />
It was the year in which the great international currency<br />
battle being waged between the United States and Japan moved<br />
sharply further against Japanese producers turning the<br />
screws still tighter on our exporters of coal and iron ore.<br />
These, and other international forces together produced a<br />
sharp fall in Australia's terms of trade, after an already<br />
bad year in 1985.<br />
It has to be conceded too that the ability of the community<br />
to grasp the nature of the changes we were undergoing was<br />
probably hampered by the unfamiliar nature of the technical<br />
language used to explain it.<br />
Complex economic notions like current account deficits and<br />
terms of trade and J-curves hardly come trippingly off the<br />
tongue. But the result of all these external factors was all too<br />
clear: our nation's real income dropped by about $ 6<br />
billion. No economy could emerge unscathed from such a battering.<br />
And no responsible government could step aside and avoid the<br />
need for tough decisions imposed upon a country and an<br />
economy such as ours by so massive a loss of national<br />
income.<br />
As a Government we accepted the unpalatable but necessary<br />
disciplines in wage fixing, monetary policy and in the<br />
Budget. Most importantly of all, with a determination unmatched in<br />
Australia's peace-time history, we set about the task of<br />
reorienting the nation's economic institutions and fostering<br />
the growth of dynamic, outward-looking industries which can<br />
take on the world's best and win.<br />
But let me emphasise that this has not been a task we set<br />
about, only in 1986.<br />
From Day One from March 1983 we recognised that the only<br />
path which could guarantee the future prosperity, stability<br />
and competitiveness of the Australian economy was to open<br />
ourselves to the opportunities and the pressures of a<br />
deregulated trading and financial environment. </p>
<p>So over the past three and a half years we have set<br />
ourselves the task of reforming and restructuring<br />
Australia's economic institutions and the framework within<br />
which they operate.<br />
As we draw near to the close of 1986, we have real cause for<br />
pride that these great tasks of reform we set ourselves have<br />
begun to bear fruit.<br />
We had our difficulties in 1986, but we also recorded<br />
something of a triumph.<br />
We had our economic problems, but the Australian people<br />
responded magnificently to them.<br />
In short, the sacrifices that were forced on the nation have<br />
not been in vain. I believe there is a new spirit abroad in<br />
Australia. A new determination to look critically at the way we<br />
have done things in the past, so as to find ways of<br />
doing them better;<br />
A new willingness to seize opportunities and make the<br />
most of them for Australia; and<br />
Most hearteningly, a new recognition that all of us<br />
business, governments, wage earners have to do with<br />
less for a time in order to spread fairly the burden of<br />
adjustment now and to set the best basis for secure<br />
economic growth.<br />
And that is why I say tonight that we can enter 1987 with<br />
cautious optimism.<br />
The foundations have been laid over the past three and a<br />
half years. Now with the sharp realignment of the currency,<br />
we are able to emerge from a period of turbulence into a<br />
period of renewed competitiveness. Barring unforeseen<br />
external factors, and, I must stress, given continued<br />
restraint, Australia can restore its long term economic<br />
stability and prosperity.<br />
Let me share with you some of our specific assessments for<br />
the future which underlie this cautious optimism.<br />
High interest rates and budgetary restraint have been<br />
necessary for some 18 months now to slow the pace of<br />
domestic demand and thus the demand for imports and to<br />
support the currency.<br />
As a consequence we have throttled back what was the main<br />
engine for economic growth in our first three years<br />
domestic investment and, particularly, consumption.<br />
Although it will pick up as time passes, domestic demand<br />
overall is likely to remain subdued until well into 1987. </p>
<p>In its place the external sector is likely to take over as<br />
the main generator of growth in the coming year.<br />
It is widely anticipated in financial markets that, barring<br />
a further and unforeseen collapse in commodity prices or<br />
world trade, our monthly balance of payments deficit has<br />
peaked at the $ 1.7 billion October figure.<br />
of course that is not to say that a dramatic improvement is<br />
expected overnight. Indeed, a major reduction in the<br />
external deficit is likely to require a prolonged period<br />
possibly some years if commodity prices remain adverse.<br />
And, of course, there will be the usual monthly variations<br />
for seasonal and other transient reasons.<br />
The important thing, however, is that the process of<br />
adjustment has certainly begun and definite progress is<br />
expected by mid-1987.<br />
one symptom is the balance of payments statistics. I won't<br />
burden you with a mass of numbers but some of the indicators<br />
are instructive. For example:<br />
excluding imports of civil aircraft which will fall<br />
substantially in 1987 and fuel, there has been a<br />
significant fall in the volume of imported goods in the<br />
September quarter for the third quarter in a row; a<br />
further fall seems to have occurred in October;<br />
Total manufacturing exports in th~ e September quarter<br />
were 7.2 per cent higher than last quarter;<br />
Tourist visas to Australia issued in the September<br />
quarter were 27 per cent up on a year earlier. No<br />
wonder, therefore, that our deficit on tourism so far<br />
this financial year is some 30 per cent less than a year<br />
earlier.<br />
Just as powerful a pointer to the future, however, is the<br />
anecdotal evidence which is starting to accumulate.<br />
Surveys of manufacturers in both NSW and Victoria report<br />
significantly improved prospects for exports and for import<br />
replacement. And I can confirm from my own experience in<br />
talking to a wide range of business people in large and<br />
small concerns alike that there is a growing recognition<br />
of those prospects and a growing willingness to take<br />
advantage of them.<br />
The Financial Review carried a front page story two weeks<br />
ago reporting an upsurge in inquiries in both Sydney and<br />
Melbourne for industrial sites to be used not for<br />
warehousing, as has so often been the case in the past, but<br />
for new manufacturing activity including, it is said, by<br />
enterprises which had previously located their production<br />
offshore. </p>
<p>Other reports have attested to the unprecedented<br />
competitiveness of Australian consultancy services and<br />
computer software industry, among others.<br />
Investment by the manufacturing sector rose by almost one<br />
third in real terms over the last two financial years and,<br />
according to survey data, seems likely to be broadly<br />
maintained in real terms this financial year and I note<br />
that MTIA members in particular are quite optimistic about<br />
the investment outlook.<br />
That upsurge, together with the use of previously excess<br />
capacity, is underpinning manufacturing exports for the<br />
immediate future.<br />
Beyond that, however, Australia will need more entrepreneurs<br />
willing to chance their arm on investment to produce and<br />
market quality products. The Australian economy has attained<br />
an unprecedented competitiveness; investors have thus been<br />
presented with an unprecedented incentive to convert these<br />
favourable circumstances into sales contracts.<br />
I know that many businesses, including a significant number<br />
represented here tonight, are planning increased investment.<br />
You must of course evaluate those plans responsibly. But let<br />
me say simply that the times demand, and will reward, a<br />
little risk-taking and flair and confidence in the economic<br />
future of Australia.<br />
Of course interest rates are an important element of the<br />
investment calculus especially for smaller firms.<br />
For some time now monetary policy has had to remain tight so<br />
as to support the currency and keep the lid on domestic<br />
demand. A firm monetary policy will remain a central element of our<br />
policy stance for as long as it takes to achieve the<br />
necessary adjustments. A premature easing of monetary policy<br />
which would bring renewed pressure on the currency and all<br />
that that entails for business confidence, inflation and,<br />
ultimately, interest rates cannot responsibly be<br />
entertained. But, nonetheless, our overall policy has been pitched so as<br />
to allow interest rates to decline, over time, from their<br />
recent high levels.<br />
There are three central reasons for that.<br />
First, the 1986-87 Budget dramatically continues the<br />
consistent efforts by this government, realised in each of<br />
our four Budgets, progressively to cut the deficit as a<br />
proportion of GDP.<br />
In this Budget it is 1.4 per cent, compared with the 5 per<br />
cent inherited from our predecessors and the OECD's<br />
projection of 3.4 per cent for the United States. </p>
<p>This is an indispensable element in our strategy to reduce<br />
Australia's need to supplement domestic saving with funds<br />
from abroad.<br />
Importantly also, the Budget has sharply reduced the<br />
Commonwealth's need to borrow and can thus ease interest<br />
rate pressures directly.<br />
Second, these policies, overall, will give a breathing space<br />
for the current account deficit to improve. The less we<br />
need to borrow abroad, each month, to fund this deficit, the<br />
smaller the premium above world interest rates we will need<br />
to offer potential lenders.<br />
Third is the outlook for inflation. The increase in the CPI<br />
in the September quarter, at 2.6 per cent, was the highest<br />
in the history of this Government. It reflected the<br />
conjunction of a number of disparate events: the lagged<br />
impact on the prices of imports following earlier<br />
depreciations; unseasonally higher fresh food prices related<br />
to floods and other disasters; and the irregular impact of<br />
higher government charges.<br />
Similar forces will be at work in the December quarter to<br />
keep the CPI increase again at an above average level. But,<br />
with the currency stronger, and with continued wage<br />
moderation, inflation is likely to moderate in 1987.<br />
While the Government has created the conditions conducive to<br />
lower interest rates, the timing of these movements will<br />
depend on a complex of market forces, expectations and<br />
sentiment and, particularly, on the pace at which the<br />
current account improves. Some downward adjustments have<br />
occurred already. But it would be irresponsible and<br />
possibly counterproductive for me to speculate in any<br />
detail on when further falls might happen.<br />
Let me turn now to wages, which will also will be an<br />
important determinant of how quickly inflation moderates.<br />
The Government remains committed to seeking labor cost<br />
outcomes for 1986-87 which are in line with our budgetary<br />
forecast and which are broadly comparable to those of our<br />
trading partners subsequently.<br />
Crucial to the delivery of such outcomes will be a realistic<br />
system of industrial relations and wage fixing one which<br />
is fair, flexible, predictable and capable of respecting<br />
both the public interest and the private interest of the<br />
parties to any dispute.<br />
In this context we have this week argued before the<br />
Conciliation and Arbitration Commission that the system of<br />
wage fixing determined in the last national wage case should<br />
be revamped. </p>
<p>We believe the two-tiered framework will provide scope for<br />
protection for lower income groups, incentives for skills<br />
and training, restructuring for improved efficiency and a<br />
degree of enterprise or industry bargaining.<br />
But, most importantly, it will also give Australia its best<br />
chance both to preserve its new competitiveness by continued<br />
wage restraint and to bring inflation gradually back down in<br />
line with our trading partners.<br />
of course the Commonwealth is insisting the Commission's<br />
procedures ensure the new system works as intended. In<br />
particular the Commonwealth wants a commitment by unions to<br />
no extra claims. The Commission must also ensure that<br />
access to the second tier is governed by clearly defined<br />
principles and is subject to Commission oversight.<br />
we have also made it clear to the Commission that the<br />
arrangements laid down by the last National Wage Case<br />
decision on superannuation have not worked well. We argue<br />
in this case for the superannuation campaign to cease. In<br />
its place we believe superannuation should be gradually<br />
phased-in under an award, consistent with the capacity of<br />
the economy to pay. The likely impact of the progress of<br />
superannuation should also be taken into account by the<br />
Commission in determining the total labour costs outcome<br />
under the new system.<br />
The overall package we believe offers new life to<br />
centralised wage fixing.<br />
We are pleased that the Government and the Confederation of<br />
Australian Industry see eye to eye on the role of the<br />
centralised system.<br />
I heartily endorse the recent remarks of David Nolan,<br />
Director of the CAI Industrial Council, when he castigated<br />
those critics of the industrial relations system who<br />
" believe that the mere existence of industrial tribunals<br />
makes things worse rather than improves them"<br />
The CAI's comment, tellingly entitled " Escapist Fantasies",<br />
said it was a positive danger for these critics to conjure<br />
up imaginary industrial relations systems that have little<br />
resemblance to reality but that are promoted to employers as<br />
solutions to their problems.<br />
According to the CAI, these critics of our industrial<br />
relations system<br />
" advocate massive change with its commensurate risk of<br />
massive dislocation, without providing any clear idea as<br />
to how this change will be brought about nor any<br />
evidence that it will in the end be better for<br />
employers" " The likelihood" the CAI says is that to attempt the<br />
changes our would-be reformers would plunge employers<br />
into an industrial morass of unknown depth." </p>
<p>That is not the path chosen by this Government. We accept<br />
that our present system can do with improvement and we<br />
will be announcing refinements to the legislative structure<br />
early in the New Year in response to the recommendations of<br />
the Hancock Report. These will be positive and constructive<br />
reforms which will win widespread community support.<br />
That is a far cry from suggesting that the entire framework<br />
should be dismantled immediately, which is what our<br />
political opponents claim they will do. They say they will<br />
' unshackle' Australia's workers a policy which would in<br />
fact destabilise the partners to Australia's tried and true<br />
system of industrial relations, and would have dire<br />
consequences for the entire economy.<br />
But what can you expect from inflexible ideologues who lack<br />
the practical experience of the real world of industrial<br />
relations? Our approach, by contrast, seeks the co-operation of all the<br />
industrial relations partners. It was in this spirit that<br />
last September I called a special meeting of the CAI, the<br />
BCA and the ACTU to discuss ways to give greater momentum to<br />
the search to improve work and management practices.<br />
For ultimately we need not just wage restraint but better<br />
productivity if we are to preserve the improvement in our<br />
competitive position made possible by the substantial real<br />
depreciation of the currency.<br />
The CAI was a willing and effective participant at that<br />
meeting, which was notable for the co-operative spirit in<br />
which all parties addressed the issues. Let me take this<br />
opportunity to thank you, Ken, and your organisation, for<br />
the substantial contribution you made.<br />
The work begun at that meeting is being carried forward by a<br />
working party of the Advisory Committee on Prices and<br />
Incomes. But of course, the success of the initiative will<br />
be determined at the work place and industry levels.<br />
All Australians will be the poorer if these opportunities<br />
are lost.<br />
On a related matter let me also commend CAI for the very<br />
practical support it has given to the Australian Traineeship<br />
Scheme. Progress so far has been slower than expected,<br />
principally because we want to get it right before it is<br />
finally implemented.<br />
But this scheme presents the exciting possibility that the<br />
young of this country will at last begin to receive,<br />
systematically, the kind of training they so richly deserve<br />
and so sorely need if we are fully to realise our national<br />
potential. </p>
<p>The CAI has also made valuable contributions of its wisdom<br />
and resources to the Business Regulation Review Unit, which<br />
we set up as part of our continuing effort to eliminate<br />
unnecessary red tape.<br />
Finally, on a night on which I have again outlined both the<br />
need for and the community's acceptance of restraint, I must<br />
also remind price setters of their corresponding obligation<br />
to exercise restraint.<br />
The Government's approach to prices surveillance to date has<br />
been selective, focusing on areas where effective<br />
competitive disciplines are absent or where pricing<br />
behaviour has pervasive effects. In these cases the PSA Act<br />
requires it to bear in mind profitability, investment and<br />
employment. But, more generally, business needs to consider carefully<br />
its pricing behaviour. Workers, quite legitimately, find it<br />
difficult to accept the need for wage restraint if prices<br />
increase faster than costs. I repeat my call for all firms<br />
to adhere to the PSA's voluntary pricing guidelines.<br />
Blatant breaches carry with them the risk that such<br />
behaviour will become the subject of public scrutiny.<br />
In the same context I repeat the Government's earlier call,<br />
in response to the real wage cuts accepted by employees, for<br />
restraint in executive remuneration.<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen<br />
The essence of this Government's approach has been to engage<br />
all sections of the Australian community in a co-operative<br />
venture to set this country on the road to prosperity.<br />
That approach proved invaluable in our first three years and<br />
has now steered us through the turbulence of 1986.<br />
As a Government we are confident that we have the means to<br />
achieve stability, to restore economic growth, to enhance<br />
incentive and to share the burdens and the benefits of<br />
restructuring.<br />
We are confident too that our approach stands in the<br />
sharpest contrast to that of our political opponents. Their<br />
policies or at least those that they have agreed to share<br />
with the rest of the nation promise a return to the<br />
instability and disharmony which characterised their years<br />
in office before 1983.<br />
Their best offer seems to be self-interested tax policies,<br />
short-sighted industrial doctrines, and another round of<br />
massive unemployment increases which the community simply<br />
cannot afford.<br />
I have a deep conviction that the Australian people will<br />
refuse to squander the achievements which we have made<br />
together, by returning to the instability and disruption<br />
offered by our opponents. </p>
<p>And I especially invite this business audience to consider<br />
carefully the real consequences of their proposals.<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen,<br />
The resolution of the tremendous difficulties imposed on us<br />
by the eVents of 1986 will be a slow and at times<br />
painful process. We will be hampered by the continuing slow<br />
deterioration of some commodity prices and the natural lags<br />
as an economy gears up to meet a radically different set of<br />
business circumstances.<br />
And I stress that the cautiously optimistic assessment I<br />
have given tonight still involves further sacrifices and<br />
further effort from the entire Australian community.<br />
We are determined as I have said to restrict our growth<br />
in labour costs in line with our diminished economic<br />
capacity. Interest rates and unemployment, though they are likely<br />
to improve in time, are still likely to remain a matter<br />
of concern for the Government.<br />
The process of restructuring, wherein lies Australia's<br />
ultimate hope for economic prosperity and stability,<br />
will be a task for our nation well into the next decade.<br />
In my address to you at your last annual dinner, I concluded<br />
with these words:<br />
" Let there be no doubt of this Government's determination to<br />
continue to manage the Australian economy to enable all<br />
Australians to prosper and realise their aspirations in the<br />
1980s, the 1990s and beyond."<br />
I re-affirm that determination tonight.<br />
For the events of 1986 have served only to reinforce my<br />
conviction that Australia will attain the prosperity we<br />
seek.<br />
Australians have worked hard in 1986 for the cause of<br />
economic reconstruction.<br />
They made sacrifices in the interests of building secure<br />
economic growth.<br />
In short they displayed their maturity and their willingness<br />
to readjust, and it is those qualities which provide the<br />
firmest possible foundations for my confidence tonight in<br />
reaffirming to you that we will prevail in our task. </p>
