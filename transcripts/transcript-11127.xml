    <content><![CDATA[<p>Subjects: republic referendum; Olympic-ticketing.</p>
<p>E&amp;OE..........</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  The latest republic poll, is it a set back for the monarchists?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Look I'm not going to respond to every poll. The people will decide this.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  It's showing more decisively though that people are leaning towards yes</p>
<p>   don't you think?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  The contributions that I make to this debate will not be by way of response</p>
<p>   to polls whichever direction they go.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  If the referendum gets up, will the President or Prime Minister be opening</p>
<p>   the Olympics?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  That's already been resolved. In any event if the republic is carried it</p>
<p>   won't start till the 1st of January 2001.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Should there be an inquiry of some sorts into the Olympic-ticketing situation?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, I guess the Australian public will be waiting to hear from SOCOG this</p>
<p>   morning with some explanation for what on the surface of it does seem to</p>
<p>   be an extraordinary thing, an absolutely extraordinary thing, and I can</p>
<p>   understand the anger of the community. And I think we ought to wait and</p>
<p>   see what the explanation is and presumably the public will react in a very</p>
<p>   predictable fashion.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Do you think that this has come about because it's become a bit too political,</p>
<p>   that there are too many from the one side in running SOCOG at this moment?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well let's wait and see what the explanation is. I have tried from the very</p>
<p>   beginning, and I continue to try to keep politics out of the Olympic Games.</p>
<p>   The Olympic Games are meant for the whole community. They're not Labor games</p>
<p>   or Liberal games, they're the Australian Olympic Games and I want them to</p>
<p>   be as accessible, as open, as available, and as widely watched by as many</p>
<p>   Australians as possible. And please keep politics out of it. Let's just</p>
<p>   have them as Games that will showcase our country to the world, will showcase</p>
<p>   the beautiful city of Sydney, but most importantly the spirit and the mood</p>
<p>   and attitudes of the Australian people to the rest of the world.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Well would you like to be SOCOG having to explain this to...?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well look, let's hear the explanation.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Do you think the Australian public has been duped in the ballot process?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well on the face of it they appear to have been misled, to say the least.</p>
<p>   And I can understand their anger and I think they're entitled to an explanation.</p>
<p>   These things should have been put on display, should have been revealed</p>
<p>   at the beginning. That's the concern that people naturally have.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Should SOCOG now make more tickets available?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Look, I've given you a reaction. I'm not going to give you a running commentary.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Is Tony Abbott right in saying that a 'yes' vote to the republic would reflect</p>
<p>   on you personally?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, I don't know that he said that. But we have a free vote and as far</p>
<p>   as I'm concerned members of the Liberal Party, Parliamentary Party, have</p>
<p>   a free and open capacity to advocate whatever side of the debate they wish</p>
<p>   to and each of them should do it free of any concern about any impact on</p>
<p>   them or any impact on me. As far as I'm concerned I will accept the result.</p>
<p>   I have a view and I'll be saying something more about my view closer to</p>
<p>   the vote. But I do want to make it clear that members of the Liberal Party</p>
<p>   are free to advocate either side of the argument. I made that clear at the</p>
<p>   beginning of last year because it's one of those issues that really shouldn't</p>
<p>   be the subject of a party line or a party whip. It's a pity the Labor Party</p>
<p>   doesn't allow a free vote to its Parliamentary members. We have a free vote.</p>
<p>   We have a range of views. I respect the views of my colleagues who support</p>
<p>   a republic, and they respect the views of people like me who think we should</p>
<p>   stay with a system that works so well. So as far as I'm concerned I will</p>
<p>   accept the result and the Government will go on, I will go on, and the people</p>
<p>   will have resolved the issue. But people should not think for a moment that</p>
<p>   as they debate this issue that it's a question of one vote being for or</p>
<p>   against me or anybody else because we're allowing a free vote. But I'll</p>
<p>   certainly be giving the reasons why I support a 'no' vote and why I wouldn't</p>
<p>   change the present system which is so workable and stable.</p>
