LIBERAL PARTY RALLY<br />
B Town Hall, Sydney, NSW FEBRUARY, 1967<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, Mr John Gorton<br />
Mr President, Mr Osborne, Mr Premier, all those gathered behind<br />
me and all those in this hall<br />
I begin to make the first speech that I have made as Prime<br />
Minister, dealing with political affairs. The speech that I am going to make<br />
to you is the first of many because there seem to be elections coming thick<br />
and fast in the immediate future. Firstly we have the election to choose once<br />
again Mr Askin as the Premier of New South Wales, then on the same day<br />
we have an election which, I sincerely hope, will choose me as the Member<br />
for Higgins. Early in March, there is an election in South Australia, and<br />
soon after that one in Western Australia.<br />
It is my hope and my belief that you here will see that on February<br />
24, this Stat e sets an ex ample for the rest of Australia to follow by choosing<br />
once again that man, whom I think you will agree, has led this State since<br />
19.65 with distinction, with vitality and with success. Certainly it is an h-rtour<br />
and a pleasure for me to stand here with him on this platform today supp'i.. ing<br />
him at the time of his election, not only because of what he has done in tl_-' s<br />
State, but also because of the meetings I have had with him in the last mco . th<br />
or so, meetings where it became perfectly clear that what he ha(, done he<br />
had done against difficulties, in that he had to take over the running of this<br />
State at a time when one of the greatest droughts Australia has Iknown hit the<br />
capacity of this State to look after itself as it has hit the capacity of other<br />
Eastern States, and that in spite of that handicap, he has been able to do what<br />
he has done. I can assure you of this, ladies and gentlemen, that he has proved<br />
himself to me to be a most persuasive and a most dedicated advocate for the<br />
State which he represents and has provided all the arguments concerning<br />
drought and other disabilities which could be put on behalf of this part of<br />
Australia. Therefore it is a happy augury and a rieasure for me to be with<br />
him, beginning what I hope will be a continuing partnership with ourselves in<br />
the Federal sphere and Mr Askin in the State sphere and other Liberals in<br />
other State spheres, so that together we can, each according to our fashion,<br />
each according to the Constitution, see that Australia is developed as a whole,<br />
and that each part of it is run by those nearest. to the people in that part of it.<br />
I don't mean by this, ladies and gentlemen, that in such a partnership<br />
and it will be, I know, a close partnership there will not be from<br />
time to time differences of opinion as to priorities, differences of opinionas<br />
to proposals. This is inevitable in any partnership if it is to run properly, it<br />
is inevitable in any Federal system, and particularly inevitable in a Federal<br />
system in which one or two States have much greater development, much<br />
greater population resources than have the other States of a nation. But while<br />
these matters in the future can be the subject of discussion, can be the subject<br />
of initial disagreement and then of resolution I would go on to say this that<br />
if those discussions are family discussions, as they would be between us in<br />
the Commonwealth and Mr Askin in New South Wales, if they are discussions I2 </p>
<p>between governments having the samye ' general eamplexion-and the same general<br />
approach as to the place of the individuial Jn. s ociety, then those matters will be<br />
more susceptible of resolution, more susceptible of amicable arrangement than<br />
could be possible were there to be a different complexion of government in this<br />
State, or indeed in others.<br />
I have spoken of possible differences of opinion not to emphasise<br />
it but as a lead-in to problems which face both a Commonwealth Government and<br />
a State Government in the years ahead, for this much is certain. Neither a<br />
Commonwealth Government nor a State Government in the years immediately<br />
ahead will have the resources to do all that they would like to do, or to do it as<br />
quickly as they would like to do it, because consider what it is that people in<br />
Aua tralia really want.<br />
Imagine yourself on the top of some high hill, looking out over a<br />
populated valley where the lights twinkle below you at night, and thinking each<br />
one of those lights is a light in the home of an Australian family. What is it<br />
they seek to build their country into; what is it they wish for them selves, and<br />
how best can we try to achieve what they wish for themselves and what they<br />
wish for their nation. You can imagine yourself in that position. You would<br />
answer your question in what is perhaps a contradictory way.<br />
You would say, I think, or I would say for yo6u: What Australians<br />
w ant is to see that the aged needy, the ill needy, those really suffering from<br />
unfortunate circumstances through no fault of their own, should be adequately<br />
proAded for by the nation, but that this should be done without destroying the<br />
incentive to save, and without destroying the incentive to self-reliance. r~ his,<br />
in itself, requires I think, some rethinking of our policies in these matters,<br />
and requires some significant effort from Governments and from the people<br />
from whom Governments gain their revenue.<br />
And they would say, we want in this nation the capacity for every<br />
individual to be able to develop to the utmost his own inherent capacitijes<br />
through education, whether it be conventional, or technical, or whatever it<br />
may be. And that requires enormous resources.<br />
And they would say we want defence for this country, we want<br />
defence sufficient to make sure that we are true allies of those whom in the<br />
ultimate our future may depend, our future existence may depend, that we can<br />
help those countries nearest to us towards stability, that we can save In our<br />
own country sufficient in the future to take the first shock of any attack that<br />
might ever be made upon us in the future, until such time as the allies whom<br />
we have supported and helped could come to our help, as I am sure they would.<br />
And that requires enormous resources from the people.<br />
And they would say we want development of this nation. We want<br />
to see resources which now lie unused be utilised so that throughout the whole<br />
of this country we will have not only employment opportunities, not only new<br />
industries, but the new industrial muscl'es which they will bring to us, and which<br />
in their turn will build us into a great material nation, and help, in their turn,<br />
the development of ourselves towards the future which is possible if we reach out<br />
to grasp it with sufficient effort. And this requires enormous resources.<br />
And they would say, and rightly say, while we want these things,<br />
we also wish that the burden of taxation upon individuals in this nation should<br />
not be raised to such heights that the incentive to produce, that the incentive<br />
to strive, that the incentive to save is removed from those individuals in the<br />
private sector, upon whom' " in the last resource, the final growth of this nation<br />
s. 3 </p>
<p>must depend. wish t, 6 see not only-tkiAÃ± hese -national<br />
objectives I have outlined are -t tT-VZ&amp;. us parts of Australia those<br />
Governments more directly in touch with the peoplo-should have resources<br />
to carry out the responsibilities directly laid upon them by the Constitution.<br />
I could go on, I could go on expanding this list of that which you<br />
r equire, of that which our nation requires, but I thinkc I have said enough,<br />
have I not to indicate that all these things cannot at once be done, that they<br />
are to some extent contradictory, and that therefore th~ ere must be a choosing<br />
of priorities, a decision as to which of these progranres it is that will most<br />
advance this nation and most provide a happy existence lor the inhabitants of<br />
it. And so if there is to be a choosing of priorities in'these fields, as there<br />
must be, then that will be a choosing of priorities taker I hope and believe,<br />
by a Commonwealth Government which is a Liberal/ Country Party Government,<br />
by a State Government which is a Liberal/ Country Party Government, and<br />
while there may be discussions as to the relative importance of particular<br />
priorities, at least it will be a ' s I have said before, a famiiy discussion, and<br />
one between people with the same ultimate objectives.<br />
And these objectives, apart from those goals which I sketched,<br />
and sketched so briefly to you this afternoon, are objectives which we feel<br />
that we must reach within a certain framework. We do not think that we can<br />
attain those aims I have set beforeq you by handing everything over to a<br />
government and to officials and say: " You attain this. We will bow out as<br />
individuals". We feel, and it is undoubtedly true, that a government must<br />
create the climate for the achievement by individuals of which I have spoken,<br />
that in many fields the government must take social action for the good of the<br />
community as a whole.<br />
~ let me expand a little on that social action because we hear a<br />
lot, and sometimes an unthought lot, I think, about socialism and how bad<br />
socialism is, but we have got to define what, we mean by this before we come<br />
to any meaningful conclusion. After all, it is not so long ago since the<br />
participation of government in any field was classified as socialism, and yet<br />
who here would object to the Governme~ at entering into the field of providing<br />
railways or roads or electricity. or Water supply for irrigation, or water<br />
supply for a city, or many of t fiese other public utilities. So while<br />
governments must enter these fields, it rhust~ always be the aim of a Liberal<br />
Government to see that they enter only thote lields where it is necessary,<br />
that they leave within the framework they lay down the greatest amount of<br />
possible area for individual achievement, unhampered by bureaucratic<br />
intervention. PAnd that having done that, having cre ated that climate, they<br />
can then look with confidence, as I believe they cqn, to the men and women<br />
of Australia, to make use of the opportunities provided by the Government<br />
according to their own bent, according to their own iiate) igence, according<br />
to their own effort, according to their own will, and that if men and women<br />
do that, they deserve any reward they get as a result of what they have done.<br />
This is a common approach, and this is an approach upon which, I think, will<br />
be built a great nation.<br />
We have got facing us at the moment grievous and hetavy burdens<br />
in overseas affairs. You will have seen sorre thing that I have said in relation<br />
to Viet Nam, perhaps the most grievous burden we now have to bear. You<br />
will perhaps have noticed that I said we feel that we as a nation of 12 million,<br />
a small nation, a nation with a population of Greater London or Greater<br />
New York, and with enormous calls upon us in these other fields I have<br />
mentioned, are doing all that can reasonably be requized from us. I want to </p>
<p>-4<br />
elaborate on that. I want to make this.-clear. You will forgive me, I hope,<br />
if at this point I read a little, so that what * I say to you will be what I have<br />
written to say to you and to others outside this-ball.'<br />
On this problem, one which is the heaviest facing Australia,<br />
our own policy is clear. We believe that the late President Kennedy sent<br />
United States troops to South Viet Nam to help the Government of that country<br />
to resist armed attacks upon it and that those attacks were instigated, controlled,<br />
supplied and maintained by the North Vietnamese Government which supplied<br />
regular troops to assist and command the insurgents.<br />
Since that time more and more North Vietnamese regular army<br />
troops have been deployed in the South and the fighting has assumed the<br />
character of an invasion of South Viet Nam by the Government of North Viet<br />
Nam. We believe the United States, under President Kennedy, was right<br />
to take, and is right to persist in its resistance to this aggression not<br />
because it is communist aggression but because it is aggression, and such<br />
aggression, whatever the reason for it anywhere in the world, is a threat to<br />
the ultimate peace of the world. If it is successful, it is likely to be repeated<br />
again and again until, as we have seen in our own lifetime, it eventually must<br />
be stopped at a cost of pain and blood' and treasure infinitely greater than if<br />
it were stopped at the beginning.<br />
Because of that belief, and because of our adherence to and<br />
reliance on the United States alliance, we are pla~ ng our full part in assisting<br />
the military resistance to that aggression not only by providing ground<br />
troops, tanks, aircraft and naval vessels, but by bearing the full cost of<br />
arming, maintaining, munitioning, supplying and provisioning all those forces<br />
which we send to assist the alliance.<br />
We shall continue to do this for as long as is necessary to attain<br />
our objective of preventing aggression's success. At the same time, we have<br />
always realised that the military effort in Viet Nam is, although absolutely<br />
necessary, only one of the components required to win this kind of war.<br />
The other component is the raising of standards of everyday living<br />
in the areas where military forces provide a shield for the civilian population.<br />
And so, from the beginning, one of the tasks of our Army has been to provide<br />
civil aid in the area in which they serve to provide not only money -and<br />
materials but man power to assist in the villages in providing grass roots<br />
assistance medical aservices of a medic kind, schoolrooms, wells, small<br />
bridges and culverts, and matters of that nature.<br />
To sum up, our objective is to prevent, or to make increasingly<br />
difficult and costly, the operation of enemy troops whether regular or guerrila<br />
and steadily to improve the living conditions of the villagers and townspeople<br />
in the area. Whether this is successful or not will depend on the will of those<br />
engaged. But it can be successful, and our will to play our part towards this<br />
objective is firm,. continuing and will not be changed. But wit h such a mighty<br />
choice befcre our country, with that being what your Government seeks to do,<br />
I believe the time has come when an alternative policy ought to be advanced, if<br />
it is going to be advanced, by an Opposition.<br />
What the Opposition' s alternative policy is I do not know, and I<br />
doubt if anybody knows. The governing body of the Labor Party has laid down<br />
a policy which requires specifically </p>
<p>That all bombing of supply routes from the North. should immediately<br />
and unconditionally be stopped.<br />
That allied troops in Viet Nam should remain in their present<br />
positions and cease fighting except to repel attacks upon<br />
themselves and this was described as a holding operation; and<br />
That if the United States or the South Vietnamese will not agree<br />
to these conditions, then we must immediately abandon the United<br />
States alliance and withdraw Australian troops from Viet Nam.<br />
That is the official policy of the Opposition, and one I believe they are bound<br />
at present to carry out. But it is one which the Leader of the Opposition has<br />
sought to blur, and to conceal from Australians so that we hear vague talk<br />
and unspecific suggestions from the Leader which appear to slither away from<br />
the policy by which he is constrained.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, don't you think the time has come when<br />
Australians have the right to know exactly what the Opposition policy on Viet<br />
Nam is, and the Opposition have a clear duty to explain specifically what it<br />
is, that there should be no more attempts to deny or conceal or misrepresent<br />
it, nor further examples of different spokesmen advancing different policies.<br />
We have a right to know what the alternative choice is, and we have a right to<br />
know now, and I ask that we should be told now on this matter of such great<br />
importance. Lord knows, ladies and gentlemen, the one thing that I find grievous<br />
is that we should, at this point of time, according to our own judgment of what<br />
is right, be rcquired to expend so much upon an insuranc~ e policy, upon defence,<br />
when there is so much required to be done for our own people and in our own<br />
country. Don't think because I have spent some time on this matter that I<br />
regard it as of more importance than our own growth and our own development,<br />
and the care of our own citizens. I do it because it is a matter which strikes<br />
to the root of Australia's survival, and we ' Ought to know what alternate parties<br />
think. Having thought that, then we hope that having achieved peace there, we<br />
can turn to an examination of these other matters I have raised with you, and<br />
that having made this exami,~ ation, not we, the Federal Government, not Mr<br />
Askin the State Government, but our Governments with you. We, in that sense,<br />
can attack and overcome our internal problems, and together build that nation<br />
which I know it is in our capacity to build and which I know it is in our destiny<br />
to achieve. </p>
