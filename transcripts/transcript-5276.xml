PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA WEDNESDAY, 27 F' 3AR,-. 98~ 7<br />
VISIT. BY PRINCESS ALEXANDRA<br />
It will be announced in London today that Princess Alexandra<br />
and her husband the Hon. Angus Ogilvy will visit Australia in<br />
late September/ early October 1980 and that Her Royal Highness<br />
will be in Melbourne on Wednesday, 1 October, 1980 to open<br />
the new wing of the Melbourne Exhibition Buildings.<br />
The announcement arises from an invitation which I discussed<br />
with Princess Alexandra and her husband during my visit<br />
there at the beginning of this month.<br />
At an earlier date the Premier of Victoria, Mr. Hamer on behalf<br />
of the Government of Victoria had proposed to the Commonwealth<br />
Government that a member of theRoyal Family visit Melbourne<br />
in early October to participate in the one hundredth anniversary<br />
celebrations of the Melbourne Exhibition Buildings. I was<br />
pleased to support the proposal and to see whether such a visit<br />
for that purpose could be arranged.<br />
Actual dates for Princess Alexandra's visit have yet to be<br />
decided. These details, including other States to be visited,<br />
will be announced as soon as practicable.<br />
Background note:<br />
This will be Princess Alexandra's fourth visit to Australia.<br />
The first occasion was in August/ September 1959 for Queensland's<br />
centenary of responsible Government. Her itinerary began in<br />
Canberra and after three weeks in Queensland there were<br />
shorter visits to New South Wales and Victoria.<br />
In February/ March 1967 Princess Alexandra and her husband<br />
visited Canberra and Sydney privately.<br />
Their last visit was in September/ October 1978 when Her Royal<br />
Highness visited Canberra, Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland<br />
and the Northern Territory in that sequence.<br />
