Prime Minister Julia Gillard and Minister for Innovation Senator Kim Carr today announced the appointment of Professor Ian Chubb AC as Australia's new Chief Scientist.</p>
<p>Professor Chubb has had a distinguished career in higher education and research.</p>
<p>Starting out as a talented neuroscientist, he then took on leadership roles in university administration and sector advocacy bodies. </p>
<p>Professor Chubb recently retired after a decade as vice-chancellor of the Australian National University.</p>
<p>He will work closely with the Gillard Government to provide advice on science and technology issues that impact on Australia and the world. </p>
<p>The Prime Minister said as a past advocate in the university sector Professor Chubb would effectively engage with industry, researchers and the wider community as part of important scientific debates</p>
<p>Senator Carr said a lifetime of work in the research community was recently recognised in Canberra when Professor Chubb was named the ACT's Australian of the Year for his contribution to higher education. </p>
<p>âHe also understands that government needs frank and objective advice and communities need strong advocates. Professor Chubb is an outstanding leader. I congratulate him on his appointment and look forward to working with him.â</p>
<p>We would also like to acknowledge the work of outgoing Chief Scientist, Professor Penny Sackett, and thank her for her contribution over the past two-and-a-half years. </p>
