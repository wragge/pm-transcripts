ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE VICTORIAN WOMEN'S<br />
SECTION OF THE LIBERAL PARTY OF AUSTRALIA<br />
Melbourne, Vic. 26 OCTOBER 1970<br />
a~ ech by the Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton<br />
Madam Chairman, Distinguished Guests and all those present here:<br />
We are meeting on the eve of a Se.-, ate election. We have far too many<br />
elections, I know. That is not my fault: You will have to look further back than that.<br />
We have far too many, but this is one, and I think a very important significant one,<br />
particularly in the State of Victoria. Because the results of this Senate election caci ld<br />
they could, I don't think they will, but they could result in Labor being able to obtain a<br />
blocking half of the Senate 30 Members, and if they did, then they would be able to<br />
do nothing constructive, but they would be able to do everything obstructive to frustrate,<br />
to delay, on occasions to throw out measures brought in by the Government to fulfil the<br />
promises it made for a three-year period only a year ago. And it could frustrate the<br />
Government achieving the objectives which it has over and above the specific promises<br />
made.... objectives of which I hope to say something to you a little later.<br />
It would be a tragedy for Australia if this election were to result in such<br />
capacity for obstruction and frustration and delay, and that is why it is of such<br />
importance that we should, particularly in Victoria where we can win a seat from<br />
Labor, do everything in our power to see that in fact we do so win.<br />
Let me tell you some of the reasons necessarily briefly why I think<br />
this is so. There is a vast gap between the approach of the Government and the approach<br />
of the Opposition in the fields of defence and Australia's security; i the fields of the<br />
need to see that any gains made by the community are real gains and not merely illusory<br />
monetary gains which buy no mnore; in the attempt to approach the tasks before us<br />
responsibly and not to make a myriad of irresponsible, undocumented promises Vhich<br />
can't be carried out.<br />
Let me advert to those few headings for a start. I believe that a good deal<br />
of discussion at the election will centre on the question of whether Australia and<br />
Australian troops should or should not remain in Vietnam, and wie -, 7ill be called<br />
immoral because we are in Vietnam, and we will be told it is feutile to be in Vietnam,<br />
and we will be told we should at once withdraw. May I examilne in tha light of history<br />
and of present events those matters?<br />
There was a time, after the Geneva Conference to 1954 or thereabouts, when<br />
the people of North Vietnam had their Government and lived under it cand the people of<br />
South Vietnam had theirs. There were no incursions by the Governent or people of<br />
South Vietnam into the North. There were, during that period, no significant incursion<br />
from the North to the South. Both those peoples could have lived in peace. Both of them<br />
2 </p>
<p>2.<br />
could have lived with independence. One of them at least, South Vietnam, could have<br />
chosen the kind of government under which it wished to live anid that was the situation.<br />
But then there was incursion from the North, there was invasion of a country which wished<br />
to be left alone. There were kidnappings and murders of the people of S,, outh Vietnam.<br />
And if I may paraphrase a former great statesman, the people there were living in peace<br />
but the North was prepared to resort to war rather than to leave the people of the South<br />
to choose their own government, and the Soi'th was prepared to accept war rather than<br />
to have a government imposed on it by force -from the North, arnd sothe war came, and<br />
so South Vietnam asked for help. And President Kennedy, no great reactionary, provided<br />
that help, and we had an alliance, and we also provided that help. But who is immoral<br />
in that situation? Those who are prepared to wiage war rather than let a country live in<br />
independence or those who are prepared to accept war rather than let the independence<br />
of a country be overthrown? Let us think of that.<br />
And then, over the long years, we have had a growing crescendo of attacks,<br />
on South Vietnam, and America, and ourselves. We have had allegations of immorality<br />
lovellbd against us; allegations of immorality for what we have done, but over those<br />
years too, the situation has dramatically improved. We have grown us-ed to hearing 1h e<br />
spokesmen for the Labor Party saying " This isa dirty war" of course it is, all wars are<br />
dirty. We have grown used to them saying " This is an unwinrnable war". Yet, as I<br />
hope to show, it is being won. We have grown used tothemsaying that " There Is no<br />
chance of deciding this matter by military meas". But during all that long period, it is<br />
only the spokesmen of the Labor Party and their friends who have said this. You have<br />
never heard the spokesmen for North Vietnam or the NLF saying there is no chance of<br />
deciding this matter by military means because they know there is, andae they are seeking<br />
to continue and always have been using military means to gain their political ends, and<br />
they will go on doing so until our use of military means convinces them that they are<br />
destined to failure. And so just recently, because we had stayed. in South Vietnam, and the<br />
United States had stayed in South Vietnam while the Sauto. Vietnamese built up their own<br />
capacity to look after themselves, to a point wh~ ere we could begin to withdraw<br />
and that point would not have been reached had we not stayed but because we have done<br />
that President Nixon has been able to offer a cease-fire so that thelkilling can stop,<br />
and negotiation-s so that the objective of the South Vietnamese choosing their government<br />
can be attained. We've offered that. And the cease-fire has been reJected by the North<br />
Vietnamese and the negotiations have been rejected, and yet we who oi~ fered that ceasefire<br />
are held to be immoral while those who rejected it and wanted the killing to continue<br />
presumably are moral. I don't think that Australians will accept that.<br />
And I don't believe, having reached this point where that offer can be ma de,<br />
where the South Vietnamese have so built up their own strength and their own capacity<br />
that Australians would want now to betray those people to whose help we went, to render<br />
useless the sacrifice already made, to render in the future the position of Australia<br />
more vulnerable. Rather do I believe that they would have the resolution to finish what<br />
they have started now that the light at the end of the tunnel grows brighter and would<br />
wish to see that that which was begun was finished and that those people of South Vietnam<br />
had the right to choose their own government, with communists standing for election<br />
if they want to. This will be a matter, I think of significance im this Senate campaign<br />
and it is a matter, I know, of great significance to Australia and to its -future. 3 </p>
<p>That's only one aspect of the defence and security of Australia which is likely<br />
to come up, because if Australia were to ado-ot the Opposition's policy in Vietnam, then<br />
there would be no credibility at all to any offers of help to arty other nation in South-East<br />
Asia and we would see threatened not only Laos and Cambodia, whomn we now find being<br />
overrun, but Thailand threatened and probably invaded and the tide moving closer to the<br />
borders of Malaysia.<br />
And having done that, for that wuuld be the result of a Labor policy, it NO uld be<br />
compounded by withdrawing all Australian military assistance to the Five-Power Pact<br />
a Pact designed to try and help those countries even nearer to us Mvalaysia and Singapore.<br />
Having inzreased the threat, the next step wie are told is to withdraw assistance to the<br />
newly threatened areas. Surely all can see whatfeffect that wiould hava on the security<br />
of Australia, we having taken up a position at the request of Malaysia and Singapore and<br />
as a result of' us taking up that position, Britain having come back to t'his area of the<br />
world, we turn our backs upon it and say " Sorry, you can go away. We won't help you.<br />
We are -retreating to our own boundaries alone And Mr. Whitlam can't even pretend<br />
to justify this by " conscience" unless he argues that his conscience will allow him to<br />
have air and naval forces in the area but not ground forces.<br />
Havir g done that, the next step we are told, is then to abolish National<br />
Service Training altogether and reduce the size of a standing Army vie would need far<br />
more in those circumstances than we have ever before needed a standing army in<br />
Australia's history. These are not insignificant matters for a Senate election to<br />
affect. But then I turn to the home front. Here, I think I can say that in the period<br />
we have been in Government, we have made promises and we have carried out more<br />
of those promises in that period than any government has carried in a like period<br />
before. We have heard much lately on the subject of pensions, but on the subject of<br />
pensions generally, ladies, the payment of the pension has increased by 50 wh ile I<br />
have been Prime Minister, and the cost of living increased by 7Th3re has been a<br />
steady improvement in the buying power of the pension in that time, but this is only one<br />
fraction of what has been done in the field of social services. Let me from this bulky<br />
tome of things we have done in all kinds of areas, tell you some of the other matters<br />
that we have done in this particular field.<br />
We have, as you know, provided subsidies to the Meals on Wheels Scheme<br />
ten cents to one dollar and for many living alone, unable perhaps to get out to shop,<br />
if they can get out to shop, paying more for food than is paid by the Meals on Wheels<br />
people who can buy it in bulk and cook it finding it difficult to cooic these Meals<br />
on Wheels cheap, hot, nutritious, are of great benefit indeed, and I am happy that<br />
we have been able greatly to assist this particular organisation because there we have<br />
a marrying of governmental finance and private work which ia this field should never<br />
be lost. 4 </p>
<p>We have I speak of some relatively minor things first set up an employment<br />
training scheme for assistance to married and single women previously restricted by<br />
domestic responsibilities. We have had quite a significant number of applications for<br />
training under this scheme, and one of them, I think, you might find of interest. There<br />
was an application sent in to us by a woman and she said to the person she was writing<br />
to " I am forty-two years of age, but when you read that, don't think ' ah, an " oldie".'<br />
Think, by George, this woman is the same age as Liz Taylor, Sophia Loren and the<br />
astronauts. She was accepted.'<br />
We have brought in the increases in pensions generally of which I have spoken,<br />
brought in, as you know, a tapered means test, provided capital for homes for handicapped<br />
children, brought in hearing aids for pensioners, helped the FlyiIlg Doctor Service,<br />
provided help for nursing homes from $ 2 a bed to $ 5 a bed for people requiring heavy<br />
care, given greater assistance to homes for the aged, increased tuberculosis<br />
allowance, helped in the case of deserted wives, increased grants to the Australian<br />
Council for the Ageing, increased the age allowance which is the level at which<br />
taxation begins on old people's salaries, advanced vocational training for widows, helped<br />
widows . idowed overseas, paid pensions to persons absent from Australia, increased<br />
unemployment aid sickness benefits. We have introduced a Health Scheme which costs<br />
the patient less and provides the patient with more than the discredited Labor Scheme.<br />
I don't want to go on, there are too many things here. I believe there are thirty new<br />
approaches which have been made in this one field, and of that no one of us needs to be<br />
in any way ashamed.<br />
But this area this area of social help is the other great area to vh ich I think<br />
we must direct our own attention. There are still some promises to be fulfilled.<br />
We stated, just a year ago, that we would provide more help for low-income earners<br />
with large families. This we will do. But there are other objectives not yet clearly<br />
stated, not yet clearly put in the form of promises, but objectives which we have before us.<br />
One of these is to further help those who have long-term illnesses, not in<br />
hospitals because we have helped them, but long-term illnesses in nursing homes. Some<br />
help has been given, but yet there is still a great and unsolved problem which is a<br />
weight, I knovw, on many families.<br />
Another of them, another real objective, must be to set up throughout<br />
Australia, or to help with the States to set up throughout Australia kindergarten-cumchild-<br />
minding centres, because now so many families are both working and so many<br />
children do not have areas to mh ich they can go and be properly cared for an perhaps<br />
be taught a little while their r -s are away. This I would regard as of very high<br />
priority. </p>
<p>May I touch very briefly on twio other great<br />
objectives because I think perhaps I have spoken long enough already. But there are<br />
new problems now which are not yet solved but are crying for solution. I think indeed<br />
that in the last two and a half to three years there have been more new problems, and<br />
more old problems, greatly exacerbated than has occured in any similar time. Some<br />
of them in the Defence field I have touched on~, but one of the really sgiicant<br />
problems for us all whereever we live is the problem faced by many a! our rural<br />
industries, problems brought on because tne world either will not buy what they produce<br />
in the quantities in which they produce it, or 4-f they will buy it, are not prepared<br />
to pay for it sufficient to enable it to continue to be produced. There is no simple<br />
answer to this. But that it is a problem of immense significance, I am sure you will<br />
agree. My Government believes it is and believes that it is one of the great tasks<br />
before it in the ensuing period of its office. And I know this that the problems of<br />
the rural industries, the difficulties which they face, will be greatly exacerbated and<br />
their economic position will greatly deteriorate if the Opposition and Mr Hawke, with<br />
whom ' the Leader of the Opposition works so closely, can bring in a 35-hour week in<br />
the rest of industry, and can unrestrictedly increase wages in the rest of industry<br />
without any regard for the productivity of the economy as a vhole. This will hit<br />
rural industries more than anything else, for this will raise the costs to them which<br />
they cannot pass on. And this is what we seek to avoid. We want to see insofar as it<br />
is possible, that all those working in this country in whatever jobs, get wages as high<br />
as they can be, provided they are real wages which will buy real things and not<br />
merely figures on a sheet of paper which will not improve their real wages oxtheir<br />
living standards at all.<br />
After all, what is earned by an individual, or what is earned by the companies<br />
for which those individuals work is not the end of the story. ' That is take-home pay, if<br />
you like, for the worker take-to-investors pay, for the company. But then out of that<br />
there must come all the requirements that the community wanits. Cut of the company<br />
profits must come half or virtually half, at once, for the schools vie need and the<br />
hospitals and the social benefits I have been talking about. And out of the pay packet<br />
taken home must also come some of the cost of these amenities which, looked at<br />
properly, are in fact part of the take-home pay for all people in AuStralia. Ncw, if we<br />
are to develop as we can, provide the things wie need, one of the es senitials should be<br />
that we do it genuinely, that we do it without so inflating prices that what looks as though<br />
it is going to be done is not done, that we work with real money and not fool's gold,<br />
and this is the other great objective before this Government. That's what I meant,<br />
when I spoke of a responsible approach instead of an irresponsible string of glittering<br />
promises. So this is important, this election. The matters which can be affected by<br />
it are important. There are many others I can't touch on now, but I thank you for<br />
having given me the time to touch on those I have, and I look to you all to see that in<br />
Victoria our three Senators are elected for the good of Victoria and -for the good of<br />
Australia. </p>
