<p> CARLTON: </p>
<p> On the line from Canberra, the nation's number one cricket</p>
<p>   fan. Good afternoon. </p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p> Hello, Mike, how are you? </p>
<p> CARLTON: </p>
<p> Good. Thanks for your time, Prime Minister. You don't often</p>
<p>   get introduced like that, do you? </p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p> No, I was scratching my head as to how you might ease into this</p>
<p>   and, you know, it was not bad. </p>
<p> CARLTON: </p>
<p> It's all right. </p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p> Not bad, not bad. I agree with you, he's been a great captain</p>
<p>   and the question, I guess, different people would like, in different</p>
<p>   ways, to mark his departure from the captaincy and, well, I heard</p>
<p>   what you had to say. </p>
<p> CARLTON: </p>
<p> Do you like the idea of a more formal, fitting farewell for Mark</p>
<p>   Taylor? </p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p> Well, I think always with these things you really ought to know</p>
<p>   the feelings of the person concerned. </p>
<p> CARLTON: </p>
<p> Well, he tends to be a bit modest about these things. He'll</p>
<p>   scratch his head and say Âoh well'. </p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p> I think any person, though, would have been chuffed at the send</p>
<p>   off he got from the nation's press both on Tuesday evening</p>
<p>   and Wednesday morning. It was very, very strong and there's</p>
<p>   not much doubt that of all the sporting positions occupied in this</p>
<p>   country, the captaincy of the cricket team brings forth a level</p>
<p>   of acclaim and accolades that are denied to others Â that's</p>
<p>   not meant ...... </p>
<p> CARLTON: </p>
<p> Particularly politicians. </p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p> Well, no, I'll leave us out of it at the present time. I</p>
<p>   am but a humble lover and spectator of the game of cricket and,</p>
<p>   indeed, many other sports. </p>
<p> CARLTON: </p>
<p> You're a cricket tragic he calls you. </p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p> Yes, that's right. He's called me that, with a good</p>
<p>   sense of humour. And he has endeared himself to the public in a</p>
<p>   way that few people have been able to do. I think what people liked</p>
<p>   is that he kept his humour and his balance and he didn't get</p>
<p>   vindictive and splenetic when he was doing poorly. He didn't</p>
<p>   turn around and blame the administrators or his team or the opponents</p>
<p>   and so forth. He was quite upfront about it. He kept going on to</p>
<p>   press conferences and acknowledging, to use the political parlance,</p>
<p>   that the polls were going badly. But he bounced back and he did</p>
<p>   it very well and I think people liked that. And he has been very</p>
<p>   successful, when you look at the other post war captains, I think</p>
<p>   he's been marvellously successful. </p>
<p> CARLTON: </p>
<p> I thought true character showed in a number of ways but particularly</p>
<p>   when they said to him, look, you're no longer going to be the</p>
<p>   one-day captain and he didn't complain. There was no whinging,</p>
<p>   he took it on the chin. </p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p> Mmm, he did. I mean, he, in a polite but firm way, he made it</p>
<p>   known on a number of occasions that he didn't agree with the</p>
<p>   decision but he didn't complain about. And he didn't spit</p>
<p>   the dummy and throw his bat in the corner and say, well, this is</p>
<p>   ridiculous, maybe I won't be the test captain if they don't</p>
<p>   want me for the one-day game. And I think he did show it and the</p>
<p>   manner of his departure was very nicely done. And I'm sure</p>
<p>   he's taken the right decision. There comes a time, when you've</p>
<p>   been at the top of sport, to go. And it's always better to</p>
<p>   go when you're right at the top and everybody is saying that</p>
<p>   you're at the top than to go a year or two later when people</p>
<p>   then mutter, well, he should have really gone 12 or 18 months earlier.</p>
<p>   And I'm absolutely certain his timing was impeccable. </p>
<p> CARLTON: </p>
<p> The same thing applies to politics, doesn't it? </p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p> It does indeed. </p>
<p> CARLTON: </p>
<p> It does indeed. Back to cricket. Why not then, perhaps - I don't</p>
<p>   know, I'm just floating these ideas Â the Prime Minister's</p>
<p>   testimonial dinner or maybe a Prime Minister's IX versus the</p>
<p>   rest of the world? I don't know, just a farewell, are you attracted</p>
<p>   to that? </p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p> Well, I'm interested to hear that. I'm always attracted</p>
<p>   to any event that focuses on cricket. Let me think about your proposal.</p>
<p>   I will. I hadn't had something specifically planned of that</p>
<p>   kind. You've sprung it on me but as always I take constructive</p>
<p>   suggestions from high quality journalists seriously. </p>
<p> CARLTON: </p>
<p> Sometimes, sometimes. </p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p> Well, I don't get the ball that often. </p>
<p> CARLTON: </p>
<p> Oh, okay, all right. What about, perhaps, I don't know, a</p>
<p>   dinner at Parliament House, a game at Manuka Oval, very nice, and</p>
<p>   dinner at Parliament House? </p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p> Well, we had a game at Manuka Oval, the Prime Minister's</p>
<p>   XI, involving him as captain of that just in December. Anyway, look,</p>
<p>   Mike, you've made a suggestion and let me think about it. </p>
<p> CARLTON: </p>
<p> One more thing Â a couple more things, still on the same</p>
<p>   subject. He said at his press conference that his wife, Judy, had</p>
<p>   told you that politics, a political career, was just not on. Did</p>
<p>   you suggest one to him? </p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p> No, I didn't specifically suggest it but I suppose in the</p>
<p>   course of conversation - you have all sorts of rambling conversations,</p>
<p>   I about my political career and experiences and he about his sporting</p>
<p>   career and experiences. And I guess perhaps at some stage in one</p>
<p>   of those conversations Judy would have said, heaven's above,</p>
<p>   you know, I'll shoot him if he goes into politics or something</p>
<p>   like that. </p>
<p> CARLTON: </p>
<p> You never said, look Mark, we could find you a safe seat if you</p>
<p>   want it mate. </p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p> No, I haven't done that. I think the captaincy of the Australia</p>
<p>   Cricket Team is above party politics. He doesn't just belong...</p>
<p> CARLTON: </p>
<p> Much, much superior. It would be a demotion to become Prime Minister.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p> No, I wouldn't agree with that. But clearly there are Â</p>
<p>   the affection for cricket stradles the political divide in this</p>
<p>   country as it always has and it always will. So our association</p>
<p>   has been very friendly. I admire the man. I think he's been</p>
<p>   a great cricketer but if he wants to express his views on politic</p>
<p>   issues, that's a matter for him. It's not something that</p>
<p>   I've sought to elicit from him. </p>
<p> CARLTON: </p>
<p> One last cricket question. Who would you like to see perhaps as</p>
<p>   the next captain Â Steve Waugh, Shane Warne? </p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p> Well, I've got a view on it but I don't think it's</p>
<p>   fair to the selectors or to the board for me to express it. I really</p>
<p>   don't. I'm not trying to run cricket in this country.</p>
<p>   It's run by the cricket board and the selectors. They'll</p>
<p>   make their decision and whoever it is, I'll welcome it and</p>
<p>   I'll be very happy to, as it were, interact with that successor</p>
<p>   in the same way as I have with Mark. </p>
<p> CARLTON: </p>
<p> Moving on, a bit of business if we can and a couple of questions</p>
<p>   on the economy, if you don't mind. To coin a phrase, this is</p>
<p>   about as good as it gets. These are a beautiful set of numbers.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p> Well, these are a beautiful set of numbers. That expression incidentally</p>
<p>   was used about some quarterly growth figures which showed that we</p>
<p>   were going into negative growth. That's what made the expression</p>
<p>   quite remarkable, used all those years ago by my predecessor. But</p>
<p>   the Australian economy now is stronger than it's been for 25</p>
<p>   or 30 years and it is very strong. It's much stronger than</p>
<p>   most people thought, say, five or six months ago and stronger than</p>
<p>   most of the advice that we received then. Not that they thought</p>
<p>   it would be weak at this time but it really has performed quite</p>
<p>   magnificently and we have come through the Asian downturn. And in</p>
<p>   some parts of Asia there are tentative signs that countries previously</p>
<p>   in recession might have a bit of growth - Korea's an example.</p>
<p>   So it does look very good at the present time. </p>
<p> CARLTON: </p>
<p> Say we've come through the Asian crisis Â I mean, there</p>
<p>   are some economists, and I think John Hewson's one of them,</p>
<p>   who'd argue we haven't, that the Asian crisis is still</p>
<p>   waiting around the corner to give us a big whack as we come past.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p> Well, that's not my view. </p>
