PRII1 INISTER'S VISIT TO U. S. ATND U. K<br />
__ Prme SSr ta arod olt<br />
at ' fscotA irport on his return from overseas 17th July, 1966.<br />
It is very good to be back in this crips air of Australia<br />
once more and to feel that I can say " mission accomplished" with<br />
a full heart. I think you've had a very good cover of all that's<br />
been happening with me, from what I gather from the papers that<br />
have reached me. Perhaps the only . matterw hich w: ouldn't have<br />
been dealt with in any detail up till no-by the press was my<br />
visit yesterday to the headquarters of the Commander-in-Chief,<br />
Pacific Comimand, Admiral Sharp, in Honolulu, where I had quite<br />
the most comprehensive briefing on the military operations, the<br />
build up of military strength and the conduct of operations that<br />
I've had in the course of the whole tour. And this rounded off<br />
in a most valuable way the discussions I've been having at the<br />
political level.<br />
The main purpose of my journey was, as you know, to try to<br />
establish a warmer and closer personal working relationship with<br />
the Prime Minister of Great Britain and the President of the 4<br />
United States. From the time I took office, both of them had of<br />
their own initiative suggested to me that I continue with them<br />
the same close and intimate cor. munication which had developed<br />
between each of them and Sir Robert ' enzies. So that when<br />
I came to meet them, I met them as one who had got quite close to<br />
them by way of this exchange of correspondence. But there is no<br />
substitute for the personal contact. Each of them had in turn<br />
suggested that I make a visit in order that ve might get to know<br />
each other better, and I was able to do this of course with the<br />
two of them. And I can say without reservation that as a result<br />
of this there has developed between myself, Prime Minister Wilson<br />
and President Johnson a working relationship and an intimacy of<br />
personal knowledge which, I think, will make for a T; r1, uos eful<br />
and advantageous exchange in the future, and which will benefit<br />
our respective countries in the closeness of our co-operation.<br />
I an rather sorry that the concluding reports I saw in<br />
one or two of the papers, covering my remarks in Uashington,<br />
implied a good deal of criticism on my part of the British<br />
Government. That read more into w. hat I said than I certainly<br />
intended. Indeed, I believe that, having regard to his own<br />
political difficulties and the problems he faces in the United<br />
Kingdom, that Prime Minister 1ilson has shown great courage and<br />
purpose in the line he has taken in relation to South Viet Nam.<br />
It's true that he did not see the bombing episode in the same<br />
way that the United States and ourselves did, but he made it<br />
clear that he was still supporting American purposes and presence<br />
in South Viet Nam.<br />
He and I had a very close exchange. I think the night<br />
at Chequers in which we spent three hours alone together and<br />
covered a great deal of ground was foundational to continuing<br />
good relations in the future and we were able to follow that up<br />
with -talks at No. 10 Downing Street the next day. I mention this<br />
because I think rather less has been made of the talks in London,<br />
although they were certainly no less extensive than the talks we<br />
had i. n '-ashington betwcon the President and -yself and his advisers.<br />
In eohch case I was able to talk, not only with the leaders of<br />
the governments concerned, but with their most senior colleagues,<br />
and this has given me a very rounded and quite full picture of<br />
what -each administration is doing in respect of a lot of matters<br />
in which we are interested. </p>
<p>2.<br />
Now-tomorrow; I meet the National Preos Club in Canberra<br />
and I shall try there to survey the contacts and discussions in<br />
rather more depth. But I hope you won't expect that of me so<br />
early in the morning after so long a journey.<br />
All I w: ould add by v. ay of conclusion is that all the<br />
objectives which I set out to achieve w: ere fully accomplished,<br />
and a groat deal more that went beyond my most sanguine<br />
expectations. Some problems have been revealed. But<br />
it is interesting to note that the concept I advanced at the<br />
outset of an Asia which, under the protection of the might and<br />
power of the United States, had been able to expand and extend<br />
econom: ically and in co-operation.-has boon seized on with<br />
enthusiasm by President Johnson and his colleagues. It doesn't,<br />
of course, state anything new but at least it states publicly<br />
some of the developments and puts them together in a co-ordinated<br />
ay Jwhich, I thirr, had not been done effectively before. So<br />
this ws a valuable contribution which Australia was able to imke<br />
and, certainly, it was appreciated.<br />
I, for my part, was very glad to have the second opportunity<br />
of seeing the President and his colleagues and a good deal of<br />
value was gathered from the second visit, supplementing the first.<br />
I shall long remember and treasure these cxperiences as the<br />
representative of this country, feeling the warmth that radiates<br />
to us in these two great democracies. They value us as a<br />
partner, as friend, as colleague in the purposes we share in<br />
common. And Australia must fee]. proud that our place( in this<br />
area of the world is recognised as an important one by tw: o of the<br />
powerful leaders of the democratic countries of the world.<br />
Thank you. </p>
