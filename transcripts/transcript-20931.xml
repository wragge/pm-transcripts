    <content><![CDATA[<p>  BARTLETT:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, good morning to you.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good morning, Liam.</p>
<p>BARTLETT:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, how did you manage to keep a reshuffle of this size so secret?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Because my senior colleagues work as a very united committed team.  They know that things like this should desirably be carried out as they were carried out on this occasion and we';re all working together and ticking in the one direction - that';s why nothing leaked out.</p>
<p>BARTLETT:</p>
<p>When did you come to the conclusion that you needed to freshen up your line up?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh, I guess a week or two ago.  I';ve been thinking about it for a while, but very particularly over the last couple of weeks.</p>
<p>BARTLETT:</p>
<p>And that';s a decision that you alone came to?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh, yes, once I decided to make changes I consulted my very senior colleagues, the Deputy Prime Minister and the Deputy Leader of the Party and the Leader of the Government in the Senate.  But in our system, in the end, the decision is the Prime Minister';s, the Party leader';s to make, but I always consult my very senior colleagues.  I';m always interested in their views. I don';t take the rather arrogant position that I';m the only repository of wisdom on these matters.  I do talk to others, but in the end it';s my responsibility and I took all of the decisions.</p>
<p>BARTLETT:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, Tony Abbott - new Health Minister that will fix some long running problems or an attack dog that will wield a big stick?  Which is he?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, he is not an attack dog - that is a very inaccurate superficial description.  Tony is certainly a strong performer but he';s also highly intelligent and he has a very well developed social conscience.  He will bring some lateral thinking to the health portfolio, he will reinforce the two pillars of the Government';s approach to health policy - that is the maintenance and strengthening of Medicare.  And also, the maintenance of the private health insurance rebate, which of course the Labor Party will take an axe to if it were to win the next election.</p>
<p>BARTLETT:</p>
<p>The Premier here in WA, Geoff Gallop, is saying this morning that Tony Abbott';s appointment will achieve nothing unless it';s followed by a substantial shift in federal health policy.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, Labor Premiers, I know they are automatically negative and I suppose that';s the script they feel they should read from.  I just point out to Dr Gallop who joined that ludicrous walkout to put on a football jersey rather than to discuss the state of the nation';s health at the last Premiers'; conference in Canberra, a real gimmick.  I mean, as somebody who loves football as much as the next person, that was a real gimmick, a stunt, which didn';t do any of the Premiers any credit.  We are providing 17 per cent more in real terms under the hospital agreement that commenced on the 1st of July. We';re actually still providing more money for public hospitals than the states, even though we don';t control them.  We don';t run the public hospital system of this country, they';re run by the states and all the states do is complain that we should give more money when we still give more than they do now.</p>
<p>BARTLETT:</p>
<p>But look, you';ll have Tony Abbott in health, Amanda Vanstone, immigration.  Both people not renowned for a compassionate image at least that';s the perception.  Is that deliberate on behalf of the Government to look tough in those areas?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I certainly have no desire to look tough, to use your expression, in health.  I have a desire in health to reassure the Australian public that we are very strong supporters of Medicare, but also that we';re strong supporters of private health insurance.  One of the things that I expect will happen is that the Labor Party';s unwillingness to guarantee the maintenance of the private health insurance rebate will become more and more apparent.</p>
<p>BARTLETT:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, your, by your own admission, your foolish outgoing Minister Wilson Tuckey is maintaining his exit was his decision.  Is that right?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Wilson and I talked about his future.  He indicated to me that he had no expectation of being reappointed after the next election if we were to be successful at that election and it was agreed between us that in the light of that, as there was a reshuffle taking place, it would be appropriate not to include him.</p>
<p>  BARTLETT:</p>
<p>He';s lucky you didn';t sack him a couple of months ago, isn';t he?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I';ve explained what';s occurred and I don';t really have anything to add on that.</p>
<p>BARTLETT:</p>
<p>You don';t think he';s fortunate he';s lasted a couple more months?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don';t have anything to add to what I';ve already said.</p>
<p>BARTLETT:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, the latest Newspoll has your party neck and neck with the ALP on a two party preferred basis, 50/50.  Are you hoping this reshuffle recaptures public support?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, it doesn';t surprise me if people are saying that the next election is going to be a tough fight for the Government.  That';s been my view for a long time.  I haven';t done this reshuffle to win some transient support in an opinion poll, you have opinion polls all the time.  But the point to make is that we have a small majority, there';s only eight seats separating the Government from electoral oblivion and people who are supporters of the Government around the country should not fall for this line that we are some kind of unbackable favourite at the next election - we';re not.  It';s going to be very tough.  We';ll be seeking a fourth election victory and that is always very hard.  The longer you are in power, inevitably, there is a tendency for people to look for an alternative, no matter how well the Government might be doing.</p>
<p>BARTLETT:</p>
<p>But look, your opposite number, as you well know, everyone does, is running at historical lows for his personal popularity and yet on this two party preferred basis you';re neck and neck 50/50.  I mean, doesn';t that tell you something about the fact that your Government';s on the nose a little bit?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, it tells me what I';ve been saying and that is that it';s going to be very hard for us to win the next election.  I acknowledge that.</p>
<p>BARTLETT:</p>
<p>But all parties like to paint themselves as the underdog.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, no, well you';ve asked me a question, I can only answer it.  You';re asking me whether I think the Government will have a tough fight to win the next election and I';m agreeing with you, it will.</p>
<p>BARTLETT:</p>
<p>Simon Crean is still banging on President Megawati';s door.  Now, given that she';s been reluctant to take your telephone calls in the past, are you surprised at the no show for the Opposition Leader?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I hope he gets to see her.  I see no meritâ€¦ I see no benefit for Australia in the Opposition Leader not having an opportunity to talk to the President of Indonesia, I don';t seek to score any political point out of that.  I hope he gets to see her and I have a good relationship with President Megawati and I want the Leader of the Opposition to be able to see her when he goes to Indonesia.  But as to the arrangements, well that';s a matter for him and the President.  But I just make the point that I derive no satisfaction out of the fact that he hasn';t been able to see her and I hope the issue is sorted out, I hope he is able to see her.</p>
<p>BARTLETT:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, do you expect the strategy, the tactics from the Opposition to change as a result of your reshuffle?  Do you think they will try and match you in some way?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I think that';s a matter you have to pursue with them.  We have made big changes, it will make a strong Government stronger but what the Opposition does in response is really a matter for the Opposition.</p>
<p>BARTLETT:</p>
<p>But would you expect it in terms of strategy?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well that';s a matter for the commentators, I';m not going to give a commentary.  I look after the composition of the Government';s frontbench, I';ve made some very good changes, I think they';re very important.  It added a Minister to the representation from Western Australia, bringing in two new Western Australian Ministers in Ian Campbell and Julie Bishop.  I think that will be welcomed in Western Australia and I believe I';ve got an even stronger team, but what the Opposition does is really a matter for it.</p>
<p>BARTLETT:</p>
<p>Richard Alston stepping down, will you miss him?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, I will.  I thought Richard was a good Minister.  He was not only a good Minister in his portfolio but he was also a strong contributor to Cabinet.  I didn';t want him to go, but he clearly made up his mind to go and we had quite a long talk about it and I understood.  But I will miss him.  He';s been a great colleague and I';m sorry that he';s departing.</p>
<p>BARTLETT:</p>
<p>Do you think my bosses in Sydney at the ABC will be breathing a sigh of relief this morning?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don';t know,  I haven';t spoken to them.  I wouldn';t presume to inquire.</p>
<p>  BARTLETT:</p>
<p>Glad you haven';t got an answer for that one.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>BARTLETT:</p>
<p>And just finally, Prime Minister, does this signal any other intention on your behalf in terms of the timing of the next election?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, it doesn';t, Liam.  I, at this stage, would expect the next election to be held some time in the second half of next year unless there is some big unexpected development on a public policy front which would justify having an earlier election, I wouldn';t plan to have one.  Whether I will have an ordinary House of Reps and half Senate or a double dissolution, I haven';t made up my mind about and I don';t need to for quite a while yet.  The election is due what around September, October, November of next year.  The three years will be up on the 10th of November.  Any election held after the 30th of June next year can hardly be regarded as an early election, but exactly when it will be held, I don';t know.</p>
<p>BARTLETT:</p>
<p>You wouldn';t regard an election after June 30 next year as an early election?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I think once you get into the second half of next year, you can hardly say it';s early.  I mean, early is when you go 9-12 months before your term is out.  If you happen to go a couple of months before your term's out, I don';t think that';s early.  But I';m not suggesting that';s when it';s going to be, I';m just making the point that once you get into the last six months of next year you are in a normal election timing territory - that';s the point I';m making.</p>
<p>BARTLETT:</p>
<p>Well, you';re full of surprises, as you';ve shown us yesterday.  I can';t help thinking about those lovely wedding photographs over the weekend in the weekend';s press.  Now I';ve cast my mind back I know that while you were giving away your daughter you had a bombshell tucked up your sleeve for the Cabinet.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, but it was very much out of my mind while the wedding was taking place, I can assure you.  That was far more important to me, much in all as the reshuffle was important, the wedding was even more important.</p>
<p>  BARTLETT:</p>
<p>I can appreciate that.  Was it a great day?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It was a wonderful day and we';re a very happy family and it was a great family occasion and it';s nice of you to inquire.</p>
<p>BARTLETT:</p>
<p>Good on ya.  Prime Minister, thanks for your time this morning.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>BARTLETT:</p>
<p>Good to talk to you.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
