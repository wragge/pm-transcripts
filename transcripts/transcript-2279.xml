COMMONWEALTH TO LEGISLATE OIN<br />
GENERAL INSURANCE<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, _ Mr. Joh-i Gorton<br />
The Government has given close consideration, ' in the light of recent<br />
developments in the insurance industry, to the broad question of supervision of the<br />
affairs of general ( non-life) insurance companies. I have received letters on the<br />
subject fram the Premier of New South VWales and Sir Arthur Rylah when Acting<br />
Premier of Victoria and we have also~ had the benefit o views conveyed to the<br />
Government by a number of organisations in the insurance field.<br />
We have reached the conclusion that there is a need for better supervision oi<br />
general insurance companies coniducting business in Australia. At present, Qujeensland<br />
is the only State which exercises a comprehensive form of supervision, and<br />
existing Commonwealth legislation the Insurance Act 1932-1966 is very limited in<br />
scope. While the deposit requirements of the Linsurance Act have served a useful<br />
purpose over the years, recent devehbpments have sho-, mn that deposit requirements<br />
on their own do not provide adequate protection a; T the interests of policy-owners.<br />
They need to be supplemented by a system of stripervision under which companies are<br />
required to meet specified standards before they are authlorised to begin carrying<br />
on general insurance business and in the conduct of their affairs thereafter.<br />
The Government has given careful thought to the question whether supervision<br />
should be a Commonwealth responsibility or whether it is best regarded as a matter<br />
for the States. For various reasons, it seems to us that Commonwealth legislation<br />
is the preferable co3urse.<br />
The fact that the Commonwealth has powers in respect of insurance under the<br />
Constitution is itself a very relevant consideration. The Commonwealth has already<br />
legislated for supervision of life insurance ai~ d since its, enactment in 1945 that<br />
legislation has been successful in ensuring sound and stable conduct of life insurance<br />
business in Australia. As in the case of life offices, many general insurance companies<br />
operate in a number of States and in the interests of the smooth running of their<br />
businesses it seems desirable that they should deal with one supervisory authority.<br />
In the representations they have made the main insurance organisations in Australia<br />
have all accepted the need for greater supervision of general insurance and have<br />
expressed a strong belief that it should be conducted by the Commonwealth. </p>
<p>At the same time, we recognise that the State Governments have a close and<br />
practical interest in irsurance in a number of ways. Queensland is involved in<br />
general insurance over the whole field, both irn an overall regulatory capacity and<br />
through the operations of its State insurance off-Lce. Most of the other States are<br />
engaged in insurance business through their government insurance offices and they<br />
all have statutory provisions covering the licenSing of insurers for workers'<br />
compensation and compulsory third party insurance pur-poses.<br />
In these circumstances vie feel it would be most helpful if, before proceeding<br />
further, we could have the benefit of the views of State Governments as to the kind<br />
of provisions they think it would be desirable for Commonwealth legislation to<br />
contain. Accordingly, I have written to the Premiers o~ f all the States inviting<br />
their -idvice and comments and indicating that, if they so desire, we would be<br />
happy to have discussions with representatives of State Governments.<br />
The Government regards the subject as one of urgency and we will press<br />
ahead with it with all possible speed. I should perhaps say, however, that the<br />
preparation of a comprehensive legislative scheme will be a large and complex<br />
operation, and I am unable at this stage to indicate a lilhely timetable for the<br />
introduction of legislation.<br />
