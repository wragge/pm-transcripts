<p>The Australian Government has today announced funding of $14.4 million over four years for Reconciliation Australia's work to promote reconciliation and build stronger relationships between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians.</p>
<p>Reconciliation Australia helps businesses and organisations develop Reconciliation Action Plans (RAPs) which include practical steps to build understanding and create opportunities for Indigenous Australians.</p>
<p>So far more than 350 organisations have developed a Reconciliation Action Plan. Approximately 1.7 million Australians work or study in an organisation with a RAP. </p>
<p>The plans have helped to secure almost 20,000 jobs for Indigenous Australians, more than $15 million for educational scholarships for Indigenous students and about $58 million in transactions with Indigenous businesses.</p>
<p>Recent research conducted by Auspoll for Reconciliation Australia indicates that trust is significantly higher between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians in RAP organisations, when compared to the wider community, and that prejudice is much lower.</p>
<p>In July 2012, the Australian Government also provided $10 million to Reconciliation Australia over two years to promote public awareness and community support for Indigenous constitutional recognition.</p>
<p>This Government is committed to recognising Indigenous people in Australia's Constitution and we want meaningful reform that reflects the hopes and aspirations of Indigenous people.</p>
<p>Constitutional recognition of Indigenous Australians will be a significant step towards reconciliation and building a nation based on strong relations and mutual respect, which recognises the unique and special place of our first peoples.</p>
<p>We encourage all Australians to become involved in the reconciliation process.  Visit <a href="http://www.reconciliation.org.aufor">www.reconciliation.org.aufor</a> more information.</p>
