0AUSTRALIAN PRODUCTIVITY COUNCIL<br />
MELBOURNE<br />
8th February, 1961<br />
Speech by the prime Minister, the Rt. Hon. R. G. Menzies<br />
Sir and ladies and gentlemen:<br />
I was very interested in your reference to the<br />
presence here of the Leader of the Opposition, and of myself.<br />
le conceals, publicly, his personal regard for me ( Laughter); and<br />
I reciprocate in kind. ( Laughter)<br />
As a matter of fact I want to toll you this, hoping<br />
that it will go no further that he and I are both rather<br />
lovers of Dickens. I am at present directing my studies to<br />
Bleak House, and he is reading, avidly, GJeat Expectations!<br />
( Laughter, applause)<br />
I always like to have two preliminary remarks and<br />
perhaps, therefore, I ought to make another. This isn't the<br />
first time that I have spoken in this Lecture Theatre. I once<br />
was one of the adjudicators, many years ago, in a debate between<br />
the Oxford Debaters and the Mclbourne University Debaters the<br />
Oxford Debaters being witty, but inaccurate; and the Melbourne<br />
Debaters being dull, but, on the , ahole, rig! 2t.<br />
On another occasion I committed myself to making a<br />
political speech in here great fun: I was counted out, not<br />
once but many times! Of course, tonight, the audience is of a<br />
different quality. But I am bound to say that it is the first time that<br />
I have been sitting on this most costly looking dais. In the<br />
old days there was a sort of counter that ran along. Ono<br />
looked around to see where the Bunsen Burners wore. ( Laughter)<br />
But this is now, of course, completely scientific. I haven't<br />
had time to study it I should have been given a chance. There<br />
are switches here; all sorts of gadgets here. It is like<br />
making a speech after dinner in America whore there are buttons,<br />
and if you press one inadvertently you are electrocuted, much to<br />
the relief of the audience ( Laughter); and if you press the<br />
other one, inadvertently, and you are leaning forward at the<br />
time, you have your neck broken. ( Laughter) None of these<br />
adventitious aids to good cheer on the part of the audience seem<br />
to be available tonight.<br />
I really don't quite know what I ought to be saying to<br />
you. I was told first of all, in a disarming way, that the<br />
Managers would like me to make a speech, of sorts, on<br />
productivity and the standard of living. And then, after a<br />
discreet interval, they told me that my friend, Mr. Calwoll,<br />
would be speaking on the same subject. Now * that should have<br />
happened of course w. as that we should have got together on<br />
this matter. But perhaps by the time we finish tonight we will<br />
find that we iave a :, reat deal in common. Bec: 2use I am sure,<br />
and you are sure, that it requires only a few minutes thought to<br />
establish the proposition that productivity is at the very basis<br />
of all national and individual material development in our<br />
country. And I myself was delighted when the Productivity<br />
Council was established. It may still be regarded, and perhaps<br />
is, as a little tentative, a little speculative. There may be<br />
those in the community who feel a little cautious about<br />
associating themselves with it. But all I need to do is to<br />
remind you that in Eiany countries in the world, great countries, 7 </p>
<p>2.<br />
countries with irmmense problems, productivity councils are<br />
becoming a commonplace.<br />
It has been realised, for example in Great Britain,<br />
with remarkable success, that to have a productivity council in<br />
which a great variety of experiences, and of personalities, can<br />
cone together, is of the essence. The tine has gone by when we<br />
can just sit down and wait for the wind to change, wait for<br />
something to turn up.<br />
Now, if we are going to talk about productivity and<br />
the standard of living, I suppose the first thing to do is to<br />
say to ourselves, " What is the standard of living?". Because<br />
that deserves thought.<br />
We have been, on the whole, rather accustomed to<br />
thinking of the standard of living in terms of something like<br />
the Series Index; as something which is measured in<br />
relation to a certain number of cornodities, in relation to<br />
house rent; in relation to this, that, and the other. This is<br />
a narrow conception of the standard of livii. Because the true<br />
standard of living in our country is the level at which we ha ve,<br />
and enjoy, at least three groups of things, sone of which are<br />
occasionally overlooked.<br />
The first group is the iroup that we instinctively<br />
think of the level at which we have and e ' joy a hone, modern<br />
labour-saving amenities in a home, good and doquate food, good<br />
and adequate clothing. These are things, tangible, easily<br />
understood, and they are perhaps the first things that we think<br />
about when we think of the standard of living.<br />
But there is another group coming into the standard<br />
of living: good schools, good Universities, good technological<br />
institutions, good organisations which bear on the creation of<br />
skill and the encouragement of the mind. Proper leisure: this<br />
too has some relation to the standard of living. Not perhaps so<br />
much as some people occasionally think it depends on the use<br />
of leisure. But proper leisure and recreation, and adequate<br />
transport, all these things still speaking within that broad<br />
compass are part of the standard of living.<br />
But if we are to be judged by the mind of history some<br />
day, as perhaps we shall be, then we cannot omit the third<br />
group, because this also relates to the standard of living the<br />
level at which we have a sense of community, a consciousness of<br />
mutual interests, a developed sense and a developing sense of<br />
social duty and a spiritual and intellectual existence.<br />
We might, by some means or another, turn out to be the<br />
best fed and the best housed, and the best clothed persons in<br />
the world, and yet we might, in the eye of history be barbarians.<br />
All these things form part of the standard of living,<br />
and I refer to thema not just to state the obvious, or to dwell<br />
in the abstract, but to remind you of this: that behind all<br />
of these things we have a problem of productivity. tt may seem<br />
odd, nay it not, to talk about the problem of productivity in<br />
relation to these rather general intellectual and spiritual<br />
conceptions. But of course there is a problem of productivity,<br />
if we agree, as I am going to suggest to you we should, that<br />
the whole problem of productivity has been too long looked at in<br />
a narrow, compartnented sense, and has not been adequately seen<br />
as requiring an entire joint connunity effort.<br />
Now to achieve the things that I have been talking<br />
about, particularly in the earlier brackets, we need, -f<br />
course, national development. National development produced </p>
<p>3.<br />
itself by increasing population this is one of the great<br />
phenomena of our time. And it is a phenomenon honourably<br />
associated with the name of r. y friend and opponent who began this<br />
great irmigration movement, postwar, into Australia.<br />
We need increasing population, and we need the<br />
exploitation of resources. Indeed I should have said, " We need<br />
the discovery of resources", and than their oxploitation and<br />
their developont. I hope that there are fewer people now who suffer from<br />
the illusion that I suffered from as a school boy that there was<br />
a certain amount of fertile country around the eastern and<br />
southern seaboard of Australia and that all beyond that was a<br />
wilderness. I hope that conception has gone.<br />
If we are to have national development then we must<br />
have full employment because we cannot afford to waste the<br />
resources ofnanpower that we have, or that we attract. We nust<br />
have savings to produce capital, so far as we can cvrsalvcs and<br />
we nust attract capital fron people who have confideonc: us.<br />
We nust have encouragement to enterprise. I don't say in<br />
sone partisan political sense. Jhat we need to do is to oncJurage<br />
in the ninds of people the enterprising s . irit, the willingness<br />
to take a risk. This has nothing to do with politics.<br />
But it has everything to do wit;' huan beings. We must have<br />
enterprise because enterprise, vigorous an.. imaginative, is one<br />
of the great productive agents in our world. And we rust have<br />
imaginative leadership which doesn't morely nean in the field of<br />
politics. Yes, we must have it on both sides in Parliament.<br />
But we must have it in anagenmnt; we must have it in the trade<br />
unions; we ust have it in all of those organisations which<br />
have a part to play in the development of Australian production.<br />
Now all I an getting at when I say these things is<br />
that national productivity does not depend upon any one of these<br />
thin6s. It depends on all of these things. And the great<br />
beauty of having a Council representing widely groups of<br />
competent and-interested people, is that it gives emphasis to<br />
the fact that weo cannot afford just to think about one element.<br />
We nust think about all, because this is our great coumunity tae.<br />
Now, Sir, once we see that productivity is the whole<br />
condition of national growth and inproved individual living we<br />
will see that it has a challenge for all of us. The totality of<br />
our individual efforts I repeat that the totality of our<br />
individual efforts, not only those who are here tonight, but all<br />
of those around Australia, will determine our national<br />
productivity; and, of course, will determine, not only the<br />
volume of production, but what we take out. When you have<br />
discovered what we put in, then you may begin to talk about what<br />
we take out. Now what are the various elements in this mattor? I<br />
know that there are sooe old-fashioned people who, when they talk<br />
about productivity, think instantly of the man who is working at<br />
the bench, for exanmle. " Now, if he did more our problem would<br />
bo solved" they say. And perhaps, on occasions, he ought to do<br />
more. But he is only one element in this rattor. The plant<br />
will, in many cases, deterine how much he does, how much he can<br />
do. The availability of power and we have gone through<br />
periods of a shocking shortage of power is a real factor.<br />
Fortunately, in every State and in the Conmonwealth, tremendous<br />
efforts have been put forward to increase the supply of power at<br />
the elbow of the man who works. Buildings, naterials, the skill<br />
of management these too, are factors. I a-very glad to see<br />
here tonight one or two representatives of the Institute of<br />
Management, because ranageomnt has an enormous part to play if we </p>
<p>0 i4.<br />
are to reach, and ultimately surpass, the visible maximum of<br />
production. The skill of the nanagement, the skill of the<br />
operative, are complementary.<br />
I don't like the idea of thinking of a nan, for<br />
exanple, who works in a factory, as being the nere servant of<br />
his machine because we, in Australia, happen to belong to a race<br />
of people who have innense resourcefulness and ingenity. And<br />
many contributions have been nade by ordinary operatives at a<br />
bench for the inprovement of procedures, and the improvement of<br />
machines. Their skill is something tremendously to be<br />
required. And above all, , f course, we must have in all<br />
productive activity a mutual desire for success, a mutual desire.<br />
It is a very great pity that in the bad old days and most of<br />
them were, looking at then justly, bad old days there was so<br />
much division of mind between the nan who managod, the ran who<br />
employed, the nan who owned, and the ran who worked in some<br />
enterprise as an employee as if there were hostility between<br />
them. All too frequently there was.<br />
We will never achieve national production on the g-rnd<br />
scale until we all gain mutual confidence, pr.. ctise mutual fair<br />
play, bend every effort to understanding, until we learn that<br />
the interests of everybody from the Chairnan of Directors right<br />
through the processes of nan~ e1. ent, to the nost newly joined<br />
boy, in a factory, are common and those interests are that their<br />
enterprise should succeed and should sustain then all.<br />
And of course if we are to have that, then the other<br />
thing that has to be put in to any productivity drive is<br />
inagination yes, of course and pride.<br />
I constantly wonder at the misuse of language that<br />
occurs. Pride is a grand word, too frequently interpreted as if<br />
it neant vanity or conceit or something cheap and silly. Why<br />
are we here tonight? Why are you, ladies and gentlemen,<br />
concerned in the affairs of this productivity council, so<br />
interested in it, so willing to contribute your minds to it? It<br />
is because you have a pride in this country and an even greater<br />
pride in the kind of country it is going to be by the time your<br />
grandchildren have lived in it.<br />
And therefore all of these things that I have<br />
mentioned are theelements. I may have omitted half a dozen.<br />
It doesn't matter, for this purpose. But every one of them is<br />
an essential constituent. And when I recite these things it is<br />
perfectly clear that there is a common nature in this task a<br />
cormon nature which requires that a Productivity Council should<br />
be all-embracing in membership and in interests.<br />
I hope I say this with great respect and with no<br />
desire to be nisunderstood that the Trade Union movement will<br />
more and more identify itself with your work as it has in<br />
Great Britain. It won't if it feels that what Joes on is a<br />
series of discussions to discover how much more work you can get<br />
out of Bill Snith. Bill Smith is not unwilling to work we<br />
cannot have much complaint about that in our country, We have<br />
only to look around and see what has happened in this country<br />
over the last 40 or 50 years to be vastly proud of the fact that<br />
somebody, some thousands, some millions of people have been<br />
doing a great deal of work. But the worker does not want to be<br />
told that he is the one element. Let it be made clear to him<br />
that he is one of a dozen elements, all of which have to be<br />
brought totgther in the cormon interest. Once that is understood,<br />
I venture to say, subject to correction that he will<br />
cone. Because he will see that this is a reat national task. </p>
<p>Now, Sir, I just go on fron that to say this.<br />
Domestically in Australia, we know that the standard of living<br />
as I have endeavoured to describe it cannot be raised by the<br />
noro force of an Act of Parliament. If all you had to do was to<br />
pass an Act of Parliament to say the standard of living is<br />
raised 25% I think that is a natter on which both parties Iight<br />
be at one at an election. And in order to be different one<br />
would have tj nove an amend&amp; ont to make it 50% and not 25. But<br />
of course you cannot do it by putting down some words on a piece<br />
of paper and calling it an Act of Parliament and getting<br />
Parliament to vote for it.<br />
Governments can, of course, facilitate expansion. Some<br />
people have been rude unough to say that Governments can<br />
facilitate recessions and falls. But have it your own way. A<br />
Governnont can do that. A Government can directly, or indirectly,<br />
affect the supply of roney; it can directly or indirectly,<br />
chiefly directly, affect the tax structure and the tariff<br />
structure. These are all, of course, ir. iensely controversial<br />
elements in the work of governmont. But the government th<br />
country cannot in any real sense spend money of value wh: i i. the<br />
people have not earned and paid to it. Or, as I once said, :-nd<br />
I still stick to it, governments, contrary to the public<br />
impression, have no money of their own. This is something to be<br />
remembered at all times.<br />
A Governr nt can make laws about goods and services.<br />
But they will be goods and services which the people have<br />
laboured to produce. A Government cannot, to take a current<br />
example, solve the recurring problem of the balance of payments<br />
except by stinulating the productivity, including the export<br />
productivity of the nation, or doing something artificial<br />
about the volume of imports into the country.<br />
But whatever the views may be on these things, the<br />
point is that everything the Government does directs itself to<br />
the products of individual and corporate effort in the country.<br />
Now what I have just said about the balance of<br />
payments particularly applies to Australia. Would you mind if<br />
I sort of made a prolonged interjection to myself by saying<br />
something about that? Because once nore we know but little of<br />
our own country and its problems.<br />
Australia happens to be intrinsically not relatively<br />
but intrinsically a great trading nation. Not per capita, but<br />
in total terms this is a great trading nation one of the first<br />
eight or nine in the world and has been for a long time. We<br />
have a volume of export trade in Australia which represents a<br />
greater proportion of our total trading than does the external<br />
trade of Japan or of the United States. This, of course,<br />
presents great problens to us. We may say, if we are foolish,<br />
" Well the right way to get rid of all those problems is to<br />
insulate your economy from the rest of the world". I don't<br />
believe that anybody, sensibly, believes that. Because you can't<br />
insulate our economy, if you think about it for ten minutes,<br />
from the rest of the world and at the same time have great<br />
national growth and developnent.<br />
Why do we have balance of payrents problems? Why do<br />
we have them coming with almost monotonous and painful<br />
regularity? And the answer, if you think about it is simple<br />
enough. The croat bulk of our export trade is in the products of<br />
the soil, or of the pasture wool, meat and the rest of our<br />
primary exports with manufacturing as yet a small fraction,<br />
though a growing one, of our exports. fAnd because our exports </p>
<p>4 6.<br />
are in this primary field they are subject to all the chances<br />
of wind and weather in the world. If the price of wool falls<br />
there is not much we can do to prevent it. If the price of<br />
meat falls there is not much we can do to prevent it. We may<br />
go on increasing our actual production in these fields as<br />
indeed Australia has but in the long run the cheque for the<br />
export income will fluctuate violently from year to year. More<br />
Sol I venture to say, than in the case of any other major<br />
country. Now, how arc we going to deal with this? Because the<br />
price of wool may fall, because there may be a drought that<br />
reduces the quantity of wheat available to be sold, prices rise<br />
and fall in the world's markets. But at home, provided we have<br />
a state of affairs in which people are employed and well paid<br />
and willing to spend money, then our demand on the rest of the<br />
world for imports will achieve an almost appalling stability at<br />
the very moment when our export income, year by year, is, in<br />
the homely phrase, going up and down like a ye ye.<br />
Now what is the answer to all that? I don't wnnt to<br />
trench on these matters, but I have heard it said that the<br />
answer is to cut your imports appropriately. Now I ask xci<br />
just to think about that. Here you have an export incom-l-,<br />
which may vary by a hundred or two hundred millions as bct-, t; , cn<br />
two years. Are you to follow it up and down by a series of<br />
fluctuating controls, physical controls over your imports? It<br />
is very difficult, I would think, vastly frustrating I would<br />
think. I myself don't believe tflat there is much hope in the<br />
long run along those lines. On the contrary I believe that what<br />
we. must aim at in Australia is to dov,; lop the character and<br />
quality of our export income. Because when it is so varied and<br />
depends on so many particular commodities and circumstances that..<br />
it assumes a higher degree of stability from year to year than<br />
it has now, then we may find and I bolieve we would find that<br />
our balance of payments problem, so peculiarly acute in the case<br />
of Australia, will tend to settle itsolf, the curve will become<br />
a little flatter. And how are we to do that? That brings me back to<br />
where I began. d~ e are to do that by doing everything we can to<br />
ensure that a much groater proportion of our export business is<br />
done in commodities and in fields in which the fluctuation of<br />
the world market does not produce such violent results. In<br />
other words we are to reduce the fluctuation in our export<br />
income so far as we can and this is not to be done overnight<br />
by developing new markets, by expanding old markets, and by<br />
selling in those miarkets not only the products of the field, but<br />
the manufactured commodities of Australia. Is this hopeless?<br />
Does anybody want to tell me that in Australia, with our native<br />
wit and our native skill, with the rising levels of competence<br />
in management, with the development of plant, with the<br />
increasing use of power and of miodern machinery we cannot<br />
compete in a whole lot of markets in the world? I don't<br />
believe it. This to me is defeatism. But it will involve in<br />
Australia a conception of production, a devotion to the idea of<br />
productivity which so far we have not reached. But if we do<br />
reach it we will find that markets that now seemi to be quite<br />
closed to us are open to us, just as much as they are to other<br />
industrialised nations in the world.<br />
Therefore it all comes back, whatever we talk about,<br />
whatever we think about, to production. It is no use getting-a<br />
market overseas if you have no production to back it. It is no<br />
use starting off in a market overseas and doing frightfully well<br />
with the first orders unless all the production is coming up<br />
behind it to supply it that is the right way to lose a market,<br />
not to rain it. </p>
<p>141 7.<br />
And so the accent all the tine is on production, on<br />
productivity both externally and domestically. We know, do we<br />
not, that domestically if we had none of those complications of<br />
overseas balances to think about at all, the right way to<br />
stabilise the value of money would be to increase the production<br />
that we achieve in Australia, matching it, and more than matching<br />
it with the growing demand of an increasing population. And<br />
externally, without a great conception of production we will<br />
have a chronic balance of payments problem which will load to<br />
widely varying applications of policy from time to time, intense<br />
irritation, and a good deal of avoidable loss.<br />
So Sir in this great task we must all take a hand<br />
because we are all in it. ' hether it has something to do with a<br />
spiritual excitement, whether it has something to do with an<br />
intellectual contribution to the growth of civilisation in<br />
Australia, whether it is producing nuts and bolts in a factory,<br />
whether it is managing something here or there, wherever it r. iay<br />
be, whether it is teaching in a school, or teaching in a<br />
university we are all in this task. Because this tasi-of<br />
productivity is, I believe, the greatest task that conf:-': . tq the<br />
nation. If we realise that it is a task for all of us, rt to be<br />
pushed off on to somebody else, a responsibility not to be<br />
dodged by any individual so that somebody else will carry more<br />
than his share of the burden, if we can realise that, then I<br />
believe that we will achieve, not only the most temondous<br />
national growth, in Australia, our c. untry, our heritage, but we<br />
will achieve a community spirit which will be infinitely more<br />
important than half the things we talk about. </p>
