E. O. E. PROOF ONLY<br />
INTERVIEW FOR SUNDAY PROGRAM 1 OCTOBER 1984<br />
JOURNALIST: Thank you for joining us Prime Minister.<br />
HAWKE: My pleasure, Robert.<br />
JOtJRANLIST: Every time we open a newspaper or turn on the<br />
radio or televi SiJon these days it seems we get new information<br />
about crime. How bad is crime and corruption in Australia?<br />
HAWKE: Let me say two things about that, Robert. You say<br />
every time you open up the papers you get new information abcout<br />
crime. It seems to me it is rather more accurate to say we get<br />
a mixture of information and innuendo. Having said that, let<br />
me say to you that I believe that organised crime in this<br />
country is a problem a significant problem, particularly in<br />
regard to that aspect of it dealing with drugs and it is because<br />
I have that view that in my early meeting with Royal Commissioner<br />
Costigan last year I indicated to him that in the time available<br />
I wanted him to concentrate on the question of the Painters and<br />
Dockers Union, but particularly on the question of drugs.<br />
Now, I think that anyone in this country who under.-estimates the<br />
dimension of this problem is stupid. It is a tragedy of very<br />
very significant proportions.<br />
JOURNALIST: It would appear that: the polls are showing thait<br />
about 83% of Australians, Mr HawkE!, are now very concerned abzout<br />
the problem of crime and corruption. Are those concerns<br />
justified? Does that make it probably al: the moment the most<br />
important political issue in this country?<br />
HAWKE: No, no, there are two different things. It doesn't make<br />
it the most important political issue. I am surprised that it<br />
is only 83%. 1 would have hoped it was 1.00% who were concerned<br />
about crime and corruption. I can't understand anyone not<br />
being concerned of it, but it doesn't make it the biggest<br />
political issue. The extent that our political opponenits w.. ant<br />
to divert attention from economic matters, then we wil'<br />
accommodate them because their record in this area is appalling.<br />
After all, for the last 35 years in this country at the<br />
Federal level government has been in the hands of the<br />
conservatives. It is under their government that these things<br />
have developed and it is only under my / 2 LD </p>
<p>Government that a significant and consistent attack is-being<br />
mounted on all aspects of organised crime. So if they want<br />
to talk about this we will welcome it. But it doesn't make<br />
it the number one issue, nor does all the research show it.<br />
We have undertaken our research, as we do consistently as a<br />
Party, and no doubt the opposition have, and the research<br />
doesn't show it as the major issue by any means. Still, in<br />
political life, George, and I think you've been around long<br />
enough that you'd'agree with me, that there is a tendency for<br />
some of us intimately involved in politics whether it's on<br />
the floor of the Houses of Parliament or in the galleries or<br />
in programs such as this to talk about issues which have a<br />
particular vibrance about them. But the realities remain for<br />
the ordinary Australians for whom I'm concerned, what's<br />
happening to the economy, what's hap-pening the prospect of<br />
jobs, what increased chances do their children have of<br />
getting jobs, what's happening to the rates of inflation,<br />
what's happening to interest rates t~ hese things remain<br />
fundamental as they should.<br />
JOURNALIST: on this question of crime? and corruption, if<br />
they are as endemic in our society as they appear to be, why<br />
should we think that the Hawke Government or a Costigai Royal<br />
Commission or a National Crime Authority can do anything to<br />
stop it.<br />
HAWK( E: Well if we as a community adopt that throw up our<br />
hands in hopelessness attitude then there's probably nothing<br />
that will be done. The important thing, and I think this is<br />
where Commissioner Costigan has with Commissioner Stewart in<br />
his Royal Commission work and others have been helpful, is in<br />
highlighting a problem. But the thing that has to be done<br />
now is with the problem highlighted, we have as a community<br />
to adopt mechanisms and an appartus, George, which will<br />
translate from making a community aware to having workable<br />
apparatuses which will start to bring people concerned to<br />
justice and that's where the National Crime Authority is so<br />
important. And I think the whole community should be<br />
indebted to Mr Justice Stewart and Mr Bingham and </p>
<p>HAWKE cont Mr Dwyer for what they've said this week,<br />
that what they are about now is having received all the<br />
material from Commissioner Costigan, some of which will be<br />
able to be used, other parts of it which will not, that the<br />
task of the National Crime Authority is now to get hard<br />
admissable evidence so that these people who are engaged in<br />
the abominations of organised crime in this country can be<br />
brought to trial on the basis of admissable evidence and fair<br />
trial.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, of the evidence against David<br />
Combe you said that we had to look at the total mosaic.<br />
HAWKE: Yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: If you take the total mosaic in New South Wales<br />
you see this two top police officers retired under a cloud,<br />
a former Chief Magistrate facing trial, a former Prisons<br />
Minister facing trial, a District Court Judge stood down<br />
pending investigation all these matters concern the<br />
administration of justice. Does that total mosaic concern<br />
you? HAWKE: Well you are saying that about New South Wales,<br />
Robert?<br />
JOURNALIST: Yes.<br />
HAWKE: Wherever that sort of thing occurs it concerns me and<br />
what I want to say to you and I think that you know and<br />
appreciate that wherever in regard to any of these matters,<br />
and not all of them come into this category, but in regard to<br />
any of those areas where Federal law or jurisdiction is<br />
involved then this Gover jrnent in the period we have been in<br />
office have moved immediately to refer such matters to the<br />
appropriate authorities and have received their<br />
recommendations for action and have moved accordingly. Now I<br />
want to make it clear that I don't play favourites. I said<br />
the other day in a press conference that wherever the cards<br />
may fall, and you will recall that that observation was made<br />
in respect of the Costigan Commission and the National Crime<br />
Authority, but I make that statement broadly and without<br />
exception where out of any inquiries, Robert, whether they be<br />
out of say Costigan, the National Crime! Authority, Senate<br />
Committees of Inquiry, out of any appropriate form of<br />
investigation, whoever may be involved then that should be<br />
pursued relentlessly and it will be.<br />
JOURNALIST: Have you made that point clear to your N. S. W.<br />
colleagues in the Federal Parliament and in the N. S. W.<br />
Government. </p>
<p>4.<br />
HAWKE: Yes, it's been made clear to everyone because my<br />
position on these things has been crystal clear always. I<br />
will be never involved in the position of protecting anyone<br />
from the proper processes of the law where anyone should be<br />
subject to those processes for the prosecution of criminal<br />
activity. And it doesn't matter whether it's N. S. W.,<br />
Victoria, Queensland, Tasmania wherever it: is whether I<br />
know people or I don't know people there can be no room. And<br />
that is not a proposition which allows itself a<br />
qualification. There can be no room for protection of anyone<br />
from the proper due processes of the law.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, on the point of the political impact<br />
of this whole issue of crime, organised crime and corruption,<br />
it's now regarded as a fact of life in N. S. W. that Neville<br />
Wran's drop in popularity and approval has been due almost<br />
entirely to that issue. If it keeps-rolling at the federal<br />
level the way it is, could you see it affecting in a negative<br />
way your own Government's standing and your standing for that<br />
matter? HAWKE: No, because there is no suggestion, and as far as I'm<br />
concerned there never will be able to be any suggestion,<br />
about any improper activities on the part of this Government<br />
or of anyone under its control. Wherever anything is raised<br />
which requires investigation, and out of investigation<br />
prosecution that will be done. And there has been no<br />
suggestion to this point that this Government of mine would<br />
follow anything other than that course. And it will not<br />
happen while I'm Prime Minister.<br />
JOURNALIST: In the NSW election campaign you stood 100%, if<br />
it was possible 110%, behind Neville Wran. Do you have any<br />
reservations about that now?<br />
HAWKE: I have no reason whatsoever to qualify my support for<br />
Neville Wran. I am not aware of one single piece of evidence<br />
which questions the integrity of Neville Wran.. I am in no<br />
possession of any such evidence. If I had any evidence then<br />
of course I would not have adopted that position, nor would<br />
Neville Wran have expected me to. But let me make this clear<br />
and I have made it clear in the Parliament, I have mIWAQ it<br />
clear throughout my public life I am not going to be a<br />
party to assassination by innuendo or guilt by assocation. I<br />
have never been part of that and I am not going to be. Now<br />
that doesn't mean that if evidence emerges about anyone<br />
whoever it may be, whatever my associations with them may be,<br />
that they will receive any protection from me. But it is<br />
terribly important, not merely in regard to Neville Wran, who<br />
you mentione, but I suggest in regard to anyone that we have<br />
in this country to avoid the processes of conde-: mnation and<br />
guilt by smear and innuendo. What we mnIst have is the proper<br />
processes of trial. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, we have come to quite a pass in<br />
the smear and innuendo department with the person code-named<br />
as the goanna in the press. Mr Kerry Packer has now come<br />
forward and issued a statement in which he answers those<br />
allegations., In this statement he says arid I have it here<br />
" we face a situation where public figures be they in<br />
' politics, the judiciary, the public service, or like myself<br />
in the business community, are regularly being accused of<br />
every imaginable crime without any evidence being proferred<br />
for those allegat-ions." Do you accept that: as a reasonable<br />
and fair summary of the situation and how can this particular<br />
state of affairs concerning Mr Packer be resolved?<br />
HAWKE: Well let me say this, and I think you have made it<br />
clear, or will do that this is a Friday afte'Tnoon interview.<br />
I haven't yet had the opportunity of seeing the statement<br />
released by Mr Packer. But addressing myself to that<br />
question I think yes, that it is a problem where people are<br />
being found guilty by smear and innuendo. Let me just give<br />
you two examples from the recent events of the Federal<br />
Parliament which will give you some indication of how this<br />
can be done. Mr Steel Hall was involved in both occasions<br />
arid with the full connivance of Mr Peacock. Hie got up in the<br />
Parliament and made an innuendo that I had attempted to<br />
muzzle the Age newspaper that I had sent Mr Barron from my<br />
personal staff to muzzle the Age newspaper arid stop a story.<br />
Now that is a terrible thing to say, but it was put there on<br />
the Parliament without any basis at all and fortunately it<br />
didn't just depend upon my repudiation, but within a matter<br />
of hours Mr Creighton Burns to his credit the editor of<br />
the Age, completely demolished that. Now, there is a<br />
situation in which with the editor the Age being the one<br />
alleged to be involved irn this, he was able to demolish it.<br />
Now that sort of thing is terrible. It was putting out<br />
without any justification whatsoever a proposition that I was<br />
trying to use my Prime Ministerial influence to stop the Age<br />
publishing a story. Now it just wasn't done. Now the second<br />
thing in which the two same people were involved in Mr<br />
Steel Hall and Mr Peacock putting a smear into the<br />
Parliament on Mr Keating, insinuating that he was prepared to<br />
accept some terrible offer from Nugan Hand. Now that will be<br />
dealt with and will be shown to be in 1: he same category. Now<br />
may I just make this point and it is important: that I do so<br />
at a little length, but I have nearly come to the end of this<br />
part of my answer, Robert. I mean, I want to make the point<br />
why is it that your opposition your Peacocks, your Steel<br />
Halls and so on are engaging in this totally unfounded<br />
sewer sort of politics which is baseless. it is becali'-<br />
they know that under my government we have ia<br />
from the economic disaster which we inhe,<br />
seven years of adminstration, from a poir-WLvu-Le this economy<br />
had stalled, where unemployment had risen by a quarter of a<br />
million in the last year, where inflation was at 11 1/ 2 per<br />
cent, where interest rates had risen to record high levels. </p>
<p>6.<br />
We have reversed all that and then just in terms of the<br />
economy in our first year we have produced Australia as the<br />
highest rate of economic growth in the world. Now on these<br />
things that matter to the Australian people, turning the<br />
economy round to the highest growing in the world,<br />
substituting a growth of unemployment of a quarter of a<br />
million under them to an increase of a quarter of a million<br />
new jobs under us, halving the inflation rate, bringing down<br />
interest rates they can't bear to talk about these issues<br />
which really concern the well-being of the Australian people,<br />
so they get down into the sewer.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, you are not suggesting though, are you<br />
that over the years that the Labor Party hasspent in office<br />
that it wasn't also guilty of the same kind of politics of<br />
innuendo and insinuation that you are referring to now.<br />
HAWKE: Let me say that there were some things that the<br />
Labor Party did when in Opposition of which I didn't approve.<br />
And I don't have to say that after thE event. I made it<br />
clear at the timed, before I was in the Parliament and while<br />
I was in there. I have never believed that you should find<br />
someone guilty by association or that you should make charges<br />
if you haven't got the evidence and certainly I believe that<br />
when the processes of the law are underway in respect of<br />
anyone then those processes should be left to go ahead<br />
unimpeded. Of course in the past the Labor Party has not<br />
been guiltless, but what I am saying is that that while I<br />
am Prime Minister, I am not getting down in the sewer with<br />
these people.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, no doubt with the best. motives, over<br />
the last few days or a week or so, you and Mrs Hawke have<br />
rightly or wrongly turned your own family affairs into a<br />
political issue. Do you see that as being the case?<br />
HAWKE: Well that is your assertion, that we have turned<br />
our family into a political issue. Now I want to make it<br />
clear, and very very clear, that what Hazel did earlier this<br />
week was at the specific request of my daughter and my sonin-<br />
law and there was a family agreement that they having<br />
asked that that be done, for reasons that they found<br />
compelling and for reasons that I admire them beyond measure,<br />
that that would be it. Hazel would make the statement on<br />
their behalf and that is the end of it.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is it the case that even though it is a family<br />
affair from your point of view, that the media are going to<br />
continue discussing it, the opposition is going to continue<br />
discussing it, and the electorate, no doubt, is discussing<br />
it. So even though you saw it as a family mat~ ter, it has<br />
become very public and political. </p>
<p>7.<br />
HAWKE: It became a public issue when the family, at the<br />
request of the children, for what as I say were<br />
courageous reasons on their part, once Hazel made the public,<br />
statement it follows as a matter of logic that that issues<br />
became public. I mean that is a truism. But what I am<br />
saying is that I can't stop, Hazel can't stop, and my<br />
children can't stop now what speculation will be. But let<br />
me say this, George that on the basis of reaction that<br />
there has been, there has been an overwhelming respect amongst<br />
the public that that is it. People don't want to talk any<br />
further with me or with Hazel about it. I have had an<br />
overwhelming response of respect. Now if you, and I don't say<br />
this rudely to you, or others want to puirsue it, or attempt<br />
to pursue it, that is your decision, George. But you will not<br />
get any support from Hazel or myrself or my children.<br />
JOURNALIST: What Hazel has done, Prime Minister, is to<br />
acknowledge in a very brave way that your daughter and son-in-law<br />
were for a lengthy period of time in breach of the law. As a<br />
concerned parent you ' would have wanted to know two things.<br />
How were they getting the money for this expensive habit and<br />
where were the drugs coming from? Have you enquired as to that?<br />
HAWKE: The situation in regard to the t~ ime of my knowledge<br />
about the extent of this problem is something that has been<br />
canvassed by Hazel. I am not going in to the private aspects of<br />
this at all. If there is anyone within the law who wants to<br />
speak to me or to Hazel or to the children, I would expect t. kicrn<br />
to do that. Those are the proper processes. If those in<br />
authority wish to ask questions which they regard as relevant,<br />
that is what they should do. I will not break the compact with<br />
my family about entering into rio further public discussion,<br />
Robert. JOURNALIST: But is it a fact though, Mr Hawke, that if there<br />
is information available to the law officers of this country<br />
that could come from your family, that that should be offered<br />
rather than asked for?<br />
HAWKE: I don't know how many times I have to say this, Georg e.<br />
I have found in previous interviews with you that you find<br />
it difficult to accept an answer given straight and for proper<br />
reasons. I say it again in the hope that you will understand<br />
it. And that is this that if the relevant law authorities<br />
wish to direct any questions to my children or to me, then I<br />
hope they will. There will be no attempt to deflect that. It<br />
would be the last thing. But I simply want to say this, that<br />
as I understand the situation in this country where you have<br />
institutions like Odyssey and other institutions which are<br />
dealing compassionately and constructively with the victims<br />
of this abomination of drugs, that what the society concentrates<br />
on is trying to save the lives of those people. Now I believe<br />
that that is what is important. But, and I repeat, if there<br />
are any questions that noed to be asked, I hope they will be<br />
asked. Now I say to you again, George, I object strongly if I<br />
having made those things clear, abundantly and without<br />
equivocation, you seek to pursue the matter because I will noct<br />
say anything more than I have said and I have said it very clearly. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Can I ask you this and I understand if you don't<br />
want to answer it. Do you think that getting to the roots of<br />
the problems faced by you daughter and her husband in other<br />
words the source of the drug involved that we would also be<br />
getting close to the source and cause of the problems that so<br />
many people<br />
HAWKE: That is a matter, George. You do. test one's patience,<br />
but I have to accept that you have difficulties. I repeat agai~ n<br />
that if those whose responsibility it is within the law to<br />
follow these matters, if they believe there would be help in this<br />
matter by speaking to my children or to myself and my wife, the~ n<br />
I hope they will do that. That is a matter for them. I am not.<br />
going publicly in any way to pursue this matter further. Now I<br />
hope, George, that you will understand that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, we will take a short break and we<br />
will be back in a moment.<br />
JOURNALIST: And with us is the Prime Minister. Prime Minister,<br />
during your ACTU, your'political and Prime Ministerial careers<br />
you've found that that put great stress on your family and on<br />
yourself. If the price is that high, why do it?<br />
HAWKE: It's a fair question Robert, and at times I've had to<br />
address it and I hope you will understand the answer. It is<br />
that I believe that I have been blessed with certain<br />
cap~ acities, I don't want to list them. I think my public<br />
record allows others to make a judgement about: those<br />
capacities. And I deeply believe that I have been given<br />
through life the opportunity to help my fellow Australians.<br />
I deeply believe that as Prime Minister of this country I've<br />
been given the opportunity to produce a better Australia in<br />
co-operation with my fellow Australians, not just in the<br />
Government, but in the business community and in the trade<br />
unions and in organisations around this country. And I am<br />
confirmed in that belief by the remarkable transformation<br />
that's taken place in Australia in the period since March<br />
1983. This is not only a country now which has reversed the<br />
economic disaster that we inherited where we, as I say, have<br />
the fastest growing economy in the world with a quarter of a<br />
million more of our fellow Australians in new jobs and with<br />
inflation halved, and so on. But it's not those things. The<br />
important thing is that we've been able to get that economic<br />
transformation because I have delivered the promise that I<br />
made to the people of Australia in the election of February<br />
and March. I said to them that I was going to end the<br />
divisions in this country, to end the hatreds, to end the<br />
confrontation where Australian was pitted against Australian,<br />
where group was pitted against group. And it's on the basis<br />
of that national reconciliation that we've been able to<br />
achieve the economic transformation. Australia at the end of<br />
1984 is a better country. There is a better sp irit in this<br />
place. We are much closer to beginning to be able to take<br />
the great advantages that we as Australians have of this<br />
incomparably good country. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: And yet the price is high, the personal price.<br />
Is it too high?<br />
HAWKE: Well at times I suppose you feel it might be, but never<br />
do I have that feeling in any lasting sense. There are<br />
obviously moments in your life, as there were in 1971, for<br />
instance, Robert, when I led this country in its opposition to<br />
the Springbok tour, perhaps ahead of public opinion. But I<br />
give thanks that now that is a well accepted position. At that<br />
time when my -children were made to suffer grievously in their<br />
school because of their father's positioDn it certainly made<br />
you wonder. In my early days in the ACTU presidency, and again<br />
recently, I mean, you get a little bit depressed, but at the end<br />
I feel that I have been given in life capacities which I am<br />
morally bound to use and if in the use of those and the<br />
development of those in high office there are times of unhap-Diness<br />
for my family, I deeply regret that. No-one could more deeply<br />
regret it, but I have the belief that I don't want to overstate<br />
myself personally, but as leader of this country I do believe I<br />
have the opportunity of making it a better Australia for millions<br />
and millions of Australians and I believe it would be a<br />
dereliction-of my opportunities. It would be a repudiation of my<br />
capacities if for the sake of personal unhappiness at times<br />
was to say alright, I am going to deny for purposes of my own<br />
satisfaction or the satisfaction or happiness of my family, that<br />
I was going to deny the opportunity of doing those things which<br />
my whole belief through life, Robert, has been that you have a<br />
responsibility to use your talents and to use them to make for<br />
a happier and better life for others. That is what,-has<br />
motivated me all my life and that is whiat I am going to continuc<br />
to do. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, would you say, as you acknowledge that<br />
you have put yourself and your family through a lot for those<br />
* political objectives that you have. Would you say that the<br />
last couple of weeks have been the roughest of your adult<br />
life?<br />
HAWKE: In some senses, yes, George, in some senses. But<br />
let me say this and I know that Hazel and my kids would want<br />
me to say this because they have always said it themselves<br />
there have been the tough times, George, some very tough<br />
ones as you have nominated. There have also been some great<br />
times for us that wouldn't have arisen other than through my<br />
involvement in public life. We have had an opportunity<br />
all of us, myself, my wife, my children to grow in many<br />
ways, to have experiences that we wouldn't otherwise have<br />
been able to have. So we have in many ways as a family and<br />
as individuals been enriched and enlarged. So it is not just<br />
a one-sided balance sheet, George.<br />
JOURNALIST: But you have in the past also, as I say,<br />
denigrated yourself as a parent because of the other<br />
responsibilities you have taken upon yourself.<br />
HAWKE: Yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you in the ultimate analysis, for instance,<br />
blame yourself for some of the predicaments that your family<br />
has found themselves in, including the present one?<br />
II~ ME: Of course I have an element of blame. Of course if I<br />
had been a nine to five worker, had been able to spend mare<br />
time, perhaps life would in some respects have been better<br />
for my children. Of course I have, as an honest human being,<br />
some sense of guilt. I mean I hope that in all of my life,<br />
even if people haven't agreed with all I have done, they have<br />
never questioned my honesty and sincerity of purpose and I<br />
must honestly say that of course I have! some sense of guilt,<br />
but I also want to enter the observation, if I may, and my<br />
family have been good enough themselves even at some of the<br />
darker moment, if I can put it that way, have been honest<br />
enough to say well, Dad, there have been a lot of good<br />
things too. </p>
<p>11.<br />
JOURNALIST: They would have seen the emotional side of Bob<br />
Hiawke probably more often than the rest of us. The question<br />
of this fine line between the person expressing their<br />
emotions as openly as you do and emotional : instability has<br />
been raised recently again. What do you see the fine line as<br />
being between an emotional person and an emotionally unstable<br />
person?<br />
HAWKE: Well I don't think it exists in my case. I have<br />
always thought, right from the time I have been in public<br />
life, of issues not in dessicated terms where you are making<br />
a decision about taxes or if you are making a decision about<br />
a resolution of an industrial dispute that there it is just<br />
to be looked at as a set of numbers or figures. I have<br />
always at the end thought of it as dealing with people, as<br />
with human beings, and so I tend in my vision of an issue to<br />
see people there and that means perh-as on some occasions and<br />
some aspects that the feelings I have come through. I have<br />
expressed the fact that I would like -it would be more<br />
comfortable for me, George, if I were physiologically<br />
manufactured in a way which meant that perhaps at time there<br />
wasn't so obvious emotion. that I feel, but I have also<br />
continuously through my life had the view that one of the<br />
greatest wastes that a person can engage in is to try and<br />
change something that is not capable of chang e. It is much<br />
better to concentrate your time and your talents, George, on<br />
trying to change those things in this world t~ hat you may be<br />
able to change for the better and go about doing it.<br />
JOURNALIST: What, you don't see your emotionalism as being<br />
a politically disadvantage?<br />
HAWKE: Well look, let me put it this way. Since I have<br />
bcen President of the ACTU, but let's put that behind us<br />
since I have been Prime Minister of this country, since March<br />
of ' 83, day after day I have been faced with having to make<br />
hard decisions, some of which I would rather have not to have<br />
to take, but I have never flinched from taking those<br />
decisions and may I say, and I believe that the overwhelming<br />
majority of your viewers, whether they happen to have voted<br />
for me or not in the past, would recognise that in the period<br />
since 5 March 1983-that if you try and make the judgement,<br />
George, about looking at Australia now at the end of ' 84 and<br />
asking is it a better country since the change of government<br />
not merely in economic terms but in the spircit that is<br />
abroad in this country. I think they would say yes, it is r<br />
much better country. Now that hasn't happened by accident.<br />
Obviously there are a lot of things which have happened since<br />
then for which we don't claim credit the breaking of the<br />
drought and so on, but the fundamentals of economic policy<br />
which have transformed this country, which have placed the<br />
concept of consensus and co-operation and consultation at the<br />
forefront of government, rather than confrontation I have<br />
been involved in those. They have been my ideas. I have </p>
<p>12.<br />
brought them to fruition. I have made them work and in the<br />
process there and in the process of our international<br />
relationships day after day I have to make hard decisions.<br />
There are pressure groups that you cannot satisfy and who get<br />
upset. I don't flinch from hard decisions. I never have and<br />
I never will.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, one decision that you will have<br />
to take fairly soon is the election date. When will you<br />
announce it and will the Parliament sit the full two weeks<br />
coming up as scheduled?<br />
HAWKE: I would expect they would, Robert. I adhere to what<br />
I said some time before that I will announce the election<br />
date earlier than any of my predecessors haVe done. I am not<br />
going to play around up to the last minute like my<br />
predecessors. And there are very gaod reasons for that.<br />
People in the business community who have urged me to go to<br />
a-n election and to go early have made the point that it can<br />
be de-stabilising for the business community if this issue is<br />
played around with up to the last moment. It won't be.<br />
People in Australia will ' have more notice from me than they<br />
have had from my predecessors. And most importantly, Robert,<br />
as I think you appreciate, we will be having a situation<br />
where as a result of the decision I take we will be having<br />
one less election than we otherwise would have to do.<br />
JOURNALIST: You are a betting man, Prime Minister. Can I<br />
get a bet on fro December 1?<br />
HAWKE: Not with me. I'm not a bookmaker, but that is a<br />
very cunning way of trying to get a scoop, for Sunday.<br />
JOURNALIST: You can't blame us.<br />
HAWKE: I can't. I don't blame you Robert. I think, as you<br />
know, I have a profound admiration for this program, but as<br />
profound as it is, I'm not going to give you that scoop.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, thanks very much for joining us.<br />
HAWKE: Thank you'. Thank you very much. </p>
