PRIME MINISTER<br />
S1989<br />
i&amp; ta 0 P= WOOGmLY 7, ASUJIDI, 22<br />
S JOUJNALST: Can I ask you first, are you concerned that Mr<br />
xeating has said, or do you agree with him that the pilots"<br />
dispute effect on tourism is being overestimated, that<br />
tourism leaders are in danger of talking down their<br />
business? PN: I don't think I agree with Paul in this sense that I<br />
think he was trying to say that if you talk gloom and doom<br />
in any long term sense that doesn't recognise that the<br />
fundamental attractiveness of Australia as a tourism<br />
destination for overseas visitors and for Australians to<br />
travel themselves all over the place, is not changed by the<br />
pilots dispute. We have a greater diversity of scenery,<br />
geography and attractions than anywhere else, I think. We<br />
have the most stable political environment, friendly people,<br />
a congenial environment. So those fundamentals are not<br />
going to change. Nov Paul doesn't feel and certainly I've<br />
said that we recognise that in the interim period of this<br />
dispute of course there is a problem for some, there is<br />
suffering and that's why I've done two things. Firstly, I<br />
have personally written to the banking industry and to the<br />
finance industry to say to them, now if there are people who<br />
clearly as a result of the pilots dispute, not sow<br />
pre-existing condition, if they are suffering then I would<br />
ask that they be accommodated, temporarily. And the second<br />
thing is I've undertaken that in the post-dispute situation<br />
we will look with the tourism industry at helping with an<br />
advertising campaign to say well things are back to normal.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you agree that the tourism industry's not<br />
really hurting at this stage?<br />
PK: Oh listen Just read the transcript will you of what<br />
I've just said. I've given a detailed answer to that<br />
question. CHAN= L </p>
<p>-2-<br />
JOURNALIST: prime Minister, you said yesterday YOU Were<br />
fairly hopeful home loan interest rates wouldn't rise to<br />
1Sg Are you still confident today that they won't go<br />
PK: Its still hopeful that they won't. We vant the<br />
community to understand, including the banking industry. As<br />
I've just been saying in a link-up to an investment seminar<br />
in Japan, that we have said at the time of the Budget that<br />
the first six months of this financial year, that is you<br />
know July to December, would be months in which we would<br />
expect to see pretty tough figure. but then in the second<br />
half of the financial year we would be expecting an<br />
improvement. I went people to understand that much of the<br />
actual economic facts that are represented in these figures<br />
show that there in a strenqthening of the infrastructure.<br />
For instance, two of the big lumpy items in last month's<br />
figures were buying aircraft for Qantas and one of the LNG<br />
ships which will be taking LNG from Australia to Japan. Now<br />
that's an adverse figure now in the current account figures<br />
but they will imdi at. ly be turned into exor earners so<br />
we will keep the tight monetary wages an~ d fiseal policy to<br />
try and reduce somewhat the level of economic activity so<br />
that we can still have economic growth and employment growth<br />
but at a slightly lover level so that we can sustain the<br />
level of imports associated with that level of activity.<br />
It's a slightly long answer but I do want to make what I<br />
think is this important pointi that we're not complacent<br />
about these figure., they do represent same problem,, but the<br />
stance of policy is there to ensure that we will go into the<br />
immediate, medium term, and longer term future with essential<br />
restructuring of our Australian economy which is going to<br />
transfoarm the position. Let so just give you the example<br />
which I just did into Japan via satellite. an Tuesday of<br />
this week I was over in Wetern Australia f or the opening of<br />
the North West Shelf Project. Now that's a project which<br />
represents som, in total represents some $ 1211 in<br />
investment. a lot of that would've been reflected in<br />
equipment coming into Australia which would've appeared as a<br />
minus in our current account figures. But as ve go into the<br />
that Project is going to be generating export income of<br />
the order of $ 2B per annum. That's the sort of thing I'm<br />
referring to.<br />
JOURALI1': In your link-up with Japan this morning, vas<br />
there much concern expressed from Tokyo about the state of<br />
Australiats economy and part iculary the current problem of<br />
the pilots dispute? </p>
<p>-3-<br />
PM: No concern expressed about the state of the Australian<br />
economy. There were questions that went to some of the<br />
things that you've been talking about, of debt and the<br />
current account issues. But it's interesting that the<br />
seminar up there is organised by the Melbourne fira, John<br />
nMontosh, with which I've been associated in these saeinars<br />
in London and New York and Tokyo, usually by satellite I<br />
night say, but that is indicative of the confidence that<br />
they as investment houses and their audience in these major<br />
centras have in the future of Australia. It's not<br />
surprising that they should because if you look at the<br />
fundamentals of this country and I just hope that people<br />
will understand them, the oanormous advantages that<br />
Australia has, we are a population of paradox that we have<br />
in term of ethnic origins, one of the most hetrogeneous<br />
* populations and yet politically very homogeneous, a very<br />
stable population, a highly trained workforce, increasingly<br />
skilled, great resources and a proximity to the fastest<br />
growing regions of the world. Those are the things which<br />
will determine and are deteraing the future growth and<br />
welfare of this country and that's what was recognised up<br />
there. Finally, on the question of the pilots dispute, I<br />
was able to sake clear to that audience just what this<br />
dispute is about. They were asking that this presage some<br />
new sort of approach to industrial relations. The answer is<br />
no. That under the accord we have seen in this country<br />
these things, and let them be clearly understood. When we<br />
cae to office, the worst recession in 50 years, that's what<br />
we inherited, unemployment, which had increased by a quarter<br />
of a million in the previous 12 months. Now what have we<br />
done under the accord? You've had the trade union movement<br />
and the Government agreeing that there would be restraint in<br />
wages. In the event we've had one and half million new<br />
jobs, we've had a rate of employment growth which is five<br />
Stimes faster than under our conservative predecessors, a<br />
rate of employment growth more than twice as fast as the<br />
rest of the world and a move from wages to profits which the<br />
trade union movement has involved itself in so that you can<br />
have the inorease in investent and mployment. Now the<br />
pilots are saying, or their Federation is saying, ' to hell<br />
with that, we are going to operate differently. We'll grab<br />
by using our power', and the Government and the trade<br />
union movement has said that's not on. That's why their<br />
outrageous claim cannot be allowed and will not be allowed<br />
to succeed because the interests of all Australians are<br />
bound up with the continuation of responsible restraint<br />
which allows growth and improvement in the social wage,<br />
education, health and so on. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, earlier this year you said you<br />
were confident interest rates would begin to ease by the end<br />
of the calendar year. DO you stand by that after<br />
yesterday's balance of payments?<br />
pM: I hope it will be the case and all I can may is what<br />
I've also continually said through the year. As a Prim<br />
Kinister I don't want interests rates to be higher for one<br />
day longer than is economically necessary. But I also have<br />
said and will continue to may that w won't reduce them one<br />
day earlier than is economically responsible. Nov you<br />
could, you know if you wanted to, say alright you will<br />
artificially confect monet~ ary policy and reduce interest<br />
rates earlier than would bq economically responsible. we're<br />
not going to do that but we vil continue in the area of<br />
wages policy and monetary policy and fiscal policy the sort<br />
of restraint that's necessary to keep this economy on<br />
course. In the past what you've had is a blowout of wages<br />
which has meant interest rates going higher than they are at<br />
the momnt and the econoW collapsing. We're not going to<br />
allow that to occur.<br />
JUOUNIST: Prime Ministar, with the current pressure on<br />
ianctceorseasttia trea tteosu, r iysomu ' vpee opwrlei twtheon tmoi gthht e bbe aunknsd ear spkirensgs utrhee ma tto<br />
this stoe because of the pilots dispute. Doesn't this make<br />
it unlikely that the banks will be able to offer any kind of<br />
help to tourism operators who need financial assistance?<br />
Pl: It's really not saying that we vant then to be<br />
massively reducing their interest or anything like that but<br />
obviously z think there could be some accommodation where<br />
because their cash flow has diminished as a result of the<br />
decline in patronage during the dispute and where it's<br />
legitimately and identifyably concerned there as a result of<br />
the dispute, well I vould say to the banks and the finance<br />
compani sej ust, you know be a little bit more patient and<br />
accmmodating and I think that can be done.<br />
JOURNALIST: Your tip for the rugby league grand final in<br />
Sydney?<br />
FS: Well as the number one supporter, in the official<br />
sense, of the Raiders I an tipping the Raiders and that in<br />
many senses would be very good for rugby, for the first time<br />
in a country side you could have the Raiders getting up. I<br />
must say as a betting man you would have to say I think, and<br />
I think the Raiders might acknowledge this, if you were<br />
looking at it in strict punting term probahly Balnmin<br />
should start favourites. All I hope is that in the event it<br />
will be a great, close, tough game and may the best side on<br />
the day win. </p>
<p>I JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, one more quick question. The<br />
Opposition has told the conference in Japan that they will<br />
looking at having 15% Japanese ownership of qovrnaent<br />
enterprises, such as Qantas, Australian Airlines,<br />
Commmonwealth Bank. Is that sothing you would be looking<br />
at? PM: well it's very interesting to hear what Mr John Moore,<br />
who was described in the introduction as a Minister in our<br />
Cabinet. Firstly, I would say about Mr John Moore he's not<br />
and would never get within a bull's roar of being a member<br />
of my Cabinet. Secondly, I would say that if the coup<br />
against Kr Peacock comes oft, which is being contemplated<br />
now to restore Hr Howard, he won't oome within a bull's roar<br />
of being in the Opposition's shadow cabinet.<br />
JOuRNALST: Nhat about the idea?<br />
PM: Nov wait a minute. This is very, very, very, very<br />
serious for someone in Australian politics, it's very<br />
serious indeed. Mr John Moore, not in my Cabinet. e's<br />
in Mr Peacock's shadow cabinet but more than half the<br />
Liberal Party wants to get rid of Mr Peacock and if that<br />
happened Mr Moore wouldn't even be in the shadow cabinet.<br />
So what Hr Moore says about anything in Australia is you<br />
know really not very relevant. I nean it has been suggested<br />
in regard to Mr Moore that he should return to Queensland.<br />
I nean if he can't sort out in Queensland the politibs of<br />
his own Liberal Party there, where they have Mr Innes, the<br />
Leader of the Liberal Party, being undermined to duap him, I<br />
mean they are dumping Mr Ahern in the National Party. Now<br />
the other part of the coalition, they are going to dump Mr<br />
innes for Sally-Anne Atkinson. Nov here's a man who's the<br />
State President of the Liberal Party up in Tokyo having the<br />
temerity where he's in danger hiaself of getting turfed<br />
out of his own shadow cabinet to talk about Australian<br />
Government policy, now really.<br />
JORALIST: Is it a feasible idea though?<br />
PM: Anything that comes out of the mind of Moore is not<br />
very feasible.<br />
