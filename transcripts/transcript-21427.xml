    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to announce today that the Australian Government will provide funding of  $4.29 million towards four projects in the Shire of Ravensthorpe.</p>
<p> These four infrastructure projects, supporting the investment of BHP Billiton in the Ravensthorpe Nickel development, include: a new Hopetoun Community Centre  ($2.75 million), a new Collocated Emergency Services facility in Hopetoun ($660,000), new services at the Ravensthorpe Entertainment Centre ($660,000) and a new Rural Transaction Centre in Hopetoun ($220,000).</p>
<p> The Ravensthorpe Nickel development will involve a total estimated investment of  $1.8 billion.  BHP Billiton is contributing $38 million for housing and infrastructure costs, and the Western Australian government has also contributed funding.</p>
<p>The Australian Government funding will help construct a new Hopetoun Community Centre to house consulting rooms for visiting health professionals, provide access to Shire services, banking facilities and a much needed meeting and community hall.</p>
<p> This funding will also help to construct a new Collocated Emergency Services facility to house firefighting, ambulance, sea search and rescue agencies in Hopetoun.</p>
<p>The Regional Partnerships funding will also contribute to new facilities at the Ravensthorpe Entertainment Centre including a gallery and formal reception area for community functions and events, a creche, child minding facility, mothers room, additional ablutions block, a fully equipped functions catering area, two smaller meeting rooms and a floor to ceiling glassed viewing gallery.</p>
<p>The Shire of Ravensthorpe will also receive funding to establish a Rural Transaction Centre to provide access to a range of business, government and other services in Hopetoun.</p>
<p>I congratulate all of the local community partners, including the Goldfields Esperance ACC, who have worked together to make these projects possible.  </p>
