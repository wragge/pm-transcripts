FOR PRESS PM No. 83/ 1972<br />
TERRORISTS ATTACK AT MUNICH<br />
Statement by the Prime Plinister, the Rt Hon. William McMahon,<br />
M. P.<br />
The Prime Minister said today that the Australian<br />
Government condemned the outrage by the terrorists at the<br />
Munich Olympic Games.<br />
The attack was reckless, barbarous, and horrible.<br />
Such attacks shocked the conscience of the entire civilised<br />
world. The Prime Minister extended his sympathy and the<br />
sympathy of the Australian people to the families of those<br />
Israelis who had been the victims of these murders.<br />
The fact that such an attack had occurred at the<br />
Olympic Games which were designed to promote the brotherhood<br />
of man added a dimension of horrible cynicism to the<br />
savagery of the attack.<br />
CANBERRA 6 September, 1972.. </p>
