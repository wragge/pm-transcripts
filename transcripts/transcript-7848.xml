PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCE, SMITH FAMILY-TRADESMEN'S<br />
UNION CLUB, WODEN, 6 DECEMBER 1989<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, what do you think of the ACT<br />
Government? PM: It's not as good as the last one.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, another election.<br />
PM: Look I'm not intervening in those affairs. They've<br />
got to follow their own processes, make up their own<br />
minds. JOURNALIST: Isn't the whole system a farce though, given<br />
that this could happen?<br />
PM: Well I don't think you'd call the whole system a<br />
farce. What you'd have to ask about some of the<br />
participants, for instance, those who run on the basis of<br />
No Self Government and then grab the seats of office.<br />
You know, there are some questions about them I suppose.<br />
JOURNALIST: inaudible<br />
PM: Let me say as far as the question of the ACT and<br />
what's going on there, it's not a matter that I'm giving<br />
any of my thinking to. There are others who will be<br />
fully involved in that. I'm not really thinking very<br />
much about it so you won't get much from me of interest.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, the NSW Government has had a<br />
fairly lukewarm reception to the road plan, saying<br />
putting conditions on the road funding is like pork<br />
barrelling. What do you think of that?<br />
PM: This isolated Government, the only non-Labor<br />
Government now amongst the Australian States, I don't<br />
regard as very representative. Mr Greiner seems to find<br />
it impossible not to play politics on issues of<br />
fundamental importance. I believe that the responses<br />
from the States generally will be as it should be. That<br />
is positive and constructive.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, is the latest intelligence from<br />
Manila causing any concern about the safety of the<br />
Ambassador or any of the Australians caught there? </p>
<p>PM: I'm being kept constantly informed. As soon as I go<br />
back this morning I'll get another update of the<br />
position. We are monitoring it very, very closely and<br />
obviously you must have some concern.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, Clyde Holding commented this<br />
morning that it's just a matter of bums on seats, this<br />
new alliance and that in fact they might hang together<br />
purely based on self interest. Would you support that<br />
view? PM: Well I've really nothing to add to what I've said<br />
before on this. I've exhausted my observations on the<br />
matter of the ACT.<br />
JOURNALIST: That $ 7M, is that still going ahead as<br />
promised or is that just pork barrelling under the<br />
previous Labor Government.<br />
PM: No, if there's a commitment been made to a<br />
government it will go ahead.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, how did last night's strategy<br />
meeting of Cabinet go?<br />
PM: Very, very well. If I could describe it briefly I<br />
would say it was one of constructive but not complacent<br />
optimism and commitment.<br />
JOURNALIST: Have the Ministers come up with lots of<br />
suggestions? PM: I mean, look you don't want to get your mind set in<br />
terms of some of your colleagues in the media's<br />
misunderstanding of things who say, ' Hawke begging for<br />
new ideas'. This is just a process which I've gone<br />
through in all lead-ups to elections that I've been<br />
associated with. It just makes sense to have a review<br />
with your Ministers of the way issues have been<br />
developing within their portfolios, how they see them<br />
being developed and presented at the next election,<br />
there's nothing unusual about that. That's what we did,<br />
as I say, in a very constructive way.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, there's been suggestions that they<br />
may not be able to get the tourists out of the business<br />
district in Manila at once, it might be a three or four<br />
stage withdrawal and that some people may be held<br />
hostage. JOURNALIST: Well of course we would be terribly<br />
concerned if it were to develop in that way. All I can<br />
say is that we will be constantly and I mean<br />
constantly monitoring the situation. Reports are<br />
coming in with regular consistency and that we will, as a<br />
Government, take whatever steps are necessary in terms of </p>
<p>3<br />
trying to ensure the safety of those for whom we have a<br />
responsibility. JOURNALIST: Do you have any idea of how many tourists,<br />
Australian tourists, are caught up in it apart from the<br />
Embassy officials?<br />
PM: No, I don't at this stage but I have an arrangement<br />
for another full briefing this morning and I'll be in a<br />
better position to answer that question then.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, if NSW refuses to go along with<br />
your road safety package does that mean there'd be more<br />
money available for the States that do go along with it?<br />
PM: I don't believe that in the end that NSW will adopt<br />
that position. I mean they have demonstrated a capacity<br />
for very silly attitudes in the past but then they, under<br />
the light of reasoning, tend to change. I mean that<br />
happened in the case of what they were doing about<br />
charging for hospital beds, for instance. I think that<br />
they will see that they would be in very bad odour if on<br />
an issue like this where the offer of the Commonwealth is<br />
direct and related to a matter of fundamental public<br />
concern and it's calculated to try and improve the<br />
terrible carnage on our roads, that's not an area where<br />
you should be playing politics. I think that they will<br />
become more sensible on it.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, there's been that the two<br />
labour officials for that damning report in NSW be<br />
sacked. Would you support those calls?<br />
PM: Read the transcript of yesterday's press conference<br />
will you.<br />
