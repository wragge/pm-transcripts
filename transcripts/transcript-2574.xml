LIBERAL PARTY DINNER<br />
BENDIGO, VIC. M AY 1972<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon.<br />
William IcMahon, C'E, PiP<br />
Mr Mayor and Mrs Elliott, Ladies and Gentlemen<br />
I am delighted to be back in Dendigo for one<br />
vitally important reason. I am here to help and to make absolutely<br />
certain that John Bourchier will take his place as the next Member<br />
for Bendigo in the National Parliament.<br />
I share your enthusiasm Fand confidence that<br />
when the numbers go up he is going to be sitting in Canberra with<br />
me on the Government benches. You can count on that.<br />
To achieve this, we are going to need your help;<br />
we are going to need your energies; we are going to need your<br />
donations. But most of all, we are going to need what I call the<br />
influence of key Liberals in this community and in every electorate<br />
throughout this nation those men and women in every community,<br />
large or small, whose opinions are worth having, and whose judgments<br />
are respected and sought by others.<br />
They are people like you. People who understand<br />
the fundamental qualities of the Australian way of life. They<br />
understand, just as we in the Parliamentary Liberal Party understand,<br />
that today we are at a crossroads of our national life.<br />
For many years, the Liberal and Country Party<br />
coalition has governed this country steadily and effectively. It<br />
has served the people well. Today there are elements in our<br />
community who want not just change, not just an alternative, but a<br />
complete upheaval of our whole pattern of living.<br />
Until recently, it looked as thotghthis viewpoint<br />
may have been gaining unthinking adherents. But now there are signs<br />
that these elements are beginning to take a harder look at the changes<br />
that might confront them under the regime of the Labor Party. / 2 </p>
<p>2<br />
There are signs that many Australians are gdng<br />
to think much more carefully before they throw away a whole and<br />
wholesome way of life and before they vote to downgrade individual<br />
freedom, and replace the rewards of individual initiative with a<br />
stereotyped society. It is up to us as Liberals to get out into the<br />
community in the coming months and make our opinions. felt. We have<br />
had the support of the majority in. this State for many years. The<br />
basic reasons for that.. support are simple and clear.<br />
There was the appeal of our own policies and<br />
people in creating the climate for the unprecedented growth and<br />
development of this nation, and there-was the disunity-of the Labor<br />
Party, especially in Victoria.<br />
Mr Chairman, we all know that very little has<br />
changed. There-are plenty of brave words and idle visions put before<br />
you but-nothing has come of them. Remember the great reforms<br />
that were going to take place in the Victorian Labor Party. All<br />
Australians now know what a sham they were. That was shown the other<br />
day in the cynical and coldblooded support of the North Vietnamese<br />
invasion. Need I say more? In Victoria, our opponents condemn<br />
themselves. I think it is also appropriate, here in Bendigo,<br />
to say something about our educatbn policy and achievements. In that<br />
context, I question the attitude of the Victorian Labor Party to<br />
education policy an attitude that was exoressed so stridently in<br />
recent weeks by the Labor Member for Bendigo. That is, until the<br />
Leader of the Opposition had a talk to him. This was an episode<br />
which I believe could justifiably be called a story of pride and<br />
prejudice. We inthe Government are proud of the record of<br />
the Commonwealth in education over the last ten years. Particularly,<br />
we are proud of our unsha'eable commitment to freedom of choice, of<br />
schools for individuals and groups within the community. I will<br />
give you an outline of what we have done in education, and of our<br />
guidelines for the future, in a moment. But before that, I want to<br />
turn to the other side of the story.....<br />
I am not sure whether or not the Member for<br />
Bendigo regards himself as the Oppositbn's spokesman on education<br />
matters. They have three or four people who seem to claim the<br />
title. But at any rate, the Member for Bendigo is the one who<br />
goes along with the Victorian Labor Party in its opposition to the<br />
principle of aid to independent schools. This was shown by his<br />
recent most intemperate and prejudiced statemeatson the subject of<br />
aid to independent schools and the Governments actions in accordance<br />
with that policy. I will give you a sample to indicate the feeling<br />
of the honourable member on the subject. These are quotations<br />
from his newspaper interviews: / 3 </p>
<p>3<br />
He says the Government has " become crazed with<br />
the madness of a mindless State aid system." That we were<br />
" Drunk with the mania of State aid", and that a grant we made to a<br />
school in Canberra was, and I quote " The last word in the insanity<br />
of Liberal State aid". Here ends the quote.<br />
I think people can be left to mrke their own<br />
judgments about anyone who makes such absurd exaggerations as a<br />
substitute for genuine political debate. Australians in general<br />
and Victorians in particular have never had much time for extremism<br />
and bigotry, the more particularly in this time on questions of<br />
education policy. That has been shown by the results of elections<br />
here for many years. These recent events give me confidence<br />
that Victorians will continue to reject unrepresentative and<br />
extreme views as well as the men who enunciate them.<br />
But before I leave the honourable member<br />
for Bendigo to his melancholy future, I want to complete the story<br />
of his assault on the policy of Commonwealth aid to independent<br />
schools as it operates in Canberra.<br />
My own Minister for Education, Malcolm Fraser,<br />
gave a very good answer in Parliament to his extreme allegations.<br />
A few days later, a leading churchman described the honourable<br />
member's approach as misleading and distasteful. He wanted to<br />
know whether the Leader of he Opposition agreed with those statements.<br />
We have not heard a peep out of the Labor Party since.<br />
The honourable member did, of course, receive<br />
a severe caucus rebuke from a very senior Labor man and is also<br />
reputed to have been carpeted by his leader. In public, the<br />
question has been hushed up.<br />
I invite you to contrast that sorry story with<br />
the record of Commonwealth involvement in education, which I<br />
believe we can justifiably point to with pride. Later this week,<br />
' e will be releasing a booklet which sets out with great clarity<br />
the objectives of the Liberal Party's education policy and the<br />
record of the Government's achievements. I recommend it to you<br />
strongly. It will set straight these recent attempts to mislead<br />
the public about what the Commonwealth is doing in education.<br />
There is one central fact that is very hard for<br />
anyone to ignore. It is this. The Liberal Country Party Government<br />
was the first and only Federal Covernment to act on aid to<br />
independent schools and to give extensive direct Commonwealth<br />
assistance to all schools. We began with a policy of aid to independent<br />
schools in the Australian Capital Territory many years ago.<br />
Successive Liberal and Country Party Governments have carried on<br />
and expanded the Commonwealth's involvement. We are the only<br />
major political Party that has wholeheartedly accepted the challenge<br />
of the plural society to help educate children outside the State<br />
system. At the same time, it is grossly wrong to imply<br />
that we do not have a significant and great concern for Government<br />
schools. This is shown by the fact that our opponents have very<br />
little on which to hang an education campaign. </p>
<p>4<br />
Of all the capital assistance going directly<br />
to schools from the Commonwealth, 83.5 per cent goes to the<br />
State schools which educate 78 per cent of the schoolchildren. On<br />
that basis, our support is weighted in favour of the Government<br />
schools. Our teacher training assistance is helping to<br />
produce new teachers at a much faster rate than the growth of new<br />
enrolments. In the past ten years, the Commonwealth's direct<br />
spending on education has gone up more than six times, from<br />
million to $ 357 million. Equally indicative of our growing interest are<br />
the increasing numbers of new areas of education support which we<br />
have moved into. I mention, particularly, programmes which are<br />
helping migrant children with language problems. And the aboriginal<br />
study grants schemes which are training some thousands of aborigines.<br />
Then, of course, there have been our science facilities and our<br />
libraries programmes. In providing this support, we do not arbitrarily<br />
decide that one school shall receive some assistance and another<br />
shall not. We have publicly stated the standards which are to<br />
apply. And as we havc said, many many times, if a school exceeds<br />
these standards, it will not get a cent out of the Commonwealth.<br />
But we do not make these decisions ourselves.<br />
In the case of independent schools, we have Advisory Committees<br />
from outside the Government. And in the case of Government schools,<br />
the States themselves decide their own priorities. So they should.<br />
That is the system we operate for capital grants.<br />
It is lump sums for the establishment of new facilities. In the<br />
case of our help with day to day running costs, we apply a policy<br />
of across-the-board payments without any means test. And this<br />
is where we find the fundamental and vital difference between Labor<br />
and Liberal policies. They want the power to say which school shall<br />
grow and which shall wither, whether it be a Government or a non-<br />
Government school. This is the essence of Labor's Schools<br />
Commission Plan. They want the power to reach into any one or all<br />
of Australia's 10,000 schools and determine each school' policies<br />
by giving or withholding finance. They even want the power to act<br />
from Canberra in the movement of teachers from one school to another.<br />
Turn now to our own policies. From the<br />
beginning of 1970, we provided per capita grants to independent<br />
schools at the rate of $ 35 per primary pupil and $ 50 per secondary<br />
pupil. If we had not done this, significant numbers of independent<br />
schools would have closed down. And the State system would have<br />
been compelled to take over the extra burdens.<br />
From the beginning of this year, we increased<br />
these grants to $ 50 per primary pupil and $ 58 per secondary pupil.<br />
But the Labor Party moved a motion in the Senate which, if<br />
successful, would have stopped those increases. </p>
<p>5<br />
It was a clear indication how some substantial<br />
elements of the Labor Party interpret their policy. It is a policy<br />
which is supported by the Member for Bendigo, by the Victorian<br />
Labor Party, and by very significant sections of the Labor Party in<br />
Canberra. It is a oolicy which will deny diversity and end experimentation.<br />
It will inevitably lead to a centralised monolithic system of<br />
enforced uniformity and conformity.<br />
We repudiate it utterly. Labor's policies, based<br />
on the South Australian model, would put a penalty on dedicated<br />
parents. The harder they work for their child's school, the less<br />
money that school will get from a Labor Government. They would<br />
have a means test on education, but no means test on pensions.<br />
This is comnletelY unacceptable. We will provide<br />
the maximum Commonwealth support for both Government and non-Government<br />
schools with the minimum of Comm-onwealth control.<br />
Parents wh(-send their children tc non-Government<br />
schools are saving the taxpayer hundreds of millions of dollars.<br />
At the same time, they are exercising their right to freedom of choice<br />
to which we as Liberals are dedicated.<br />
We will fight to maintain that freedom of choice. </p>
