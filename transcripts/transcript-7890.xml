I a OB PO any<br />
JOURNALIST: What's your response to the employment figures<br />
today, 6.2% for January?<br />
PF: Oh, I'm reasonably satisfied with the outcome. I think<br />
it's broadly in line with what we expected and still further<br />
rise in employment, but the increase in the participation<br />
rate has meant a slight increase in the unemployment rate.<br />
And in total it brings the creation of jobs under this<br />
Government to over 1.6 million, an average annual rate of<br />
growth of about 3 An important thing to remember for<br />
people as they are coming up towards an election at some<br />
stage in the first part of this year, if they want to think<br />
about employment, just understand this basic fact, that<br />
those figures show that under my Government in 7 years we've<br />
created jobs in this country five times faster than the<br />
conservatives did in their 7 years, that's the important<br />
point. JOURNALIST: Would you support a Royal Comlssion into WA<br />
Inc.?<br />
PK: That* s not my decision. That's a matter for the State<br />
Government and I don't intervene in the affairs of States.<br />
JOURNALIST: Would you welcome this.<br />
PN: I would say that's a quite hypothetical matter. It's<br />
for the State Government to decide these things.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you going to be meeting with Mr Dowding at<br />
all today?<br />
PN: Well, I haven't got any plans to meet with Peter. I<br />
don't know whether he wanted to see m but I've got a full<br />
program of federal campaigning.<br />
JOURNALIST: ill you be seeing Carmen Lawrence before you<br />
go? I </p>
<p>PN: Not that I know of.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, in Melbourne today there's supposed<br />
to be details being worked out for the compensation to be<br />
paid to the airlines by the pilots. Will you still be<br />
pushing the airlines to waive that compensation payment?<br />
PM: Yes, my position is quite clear and unchanged from what<br />
I said before. They needed to take the action they did<br />
because of the position of the pilots and the total<br />
isrepresentation of the pilots about what was in issue.<br />
But I don't believe in them collecting damages against the<br />
pilots. I said that before, I believe it still.<br />
JOOURALZST: Mr Hawke, the Pacific Highway inquiry the<br />
Coroner has said some fairly nasty things about the Highway<br />
itself. Is that going to become a political issue on the<br />
Bast Coast, the upgrading of that Highway?<br />
PM: Well, I suppose its a political issue already to some<br />
extent. I think that the State and the Federal Governments<br />
together need to look at these issues. we have already, as<br />
you know, brought in a package of $ 110 million which we will<br />
offer to the States and that's to look at what we call the<br />
black spots where there has been a concentration of<br />
accidents. And the availability of that very substantial<br />
amount of money is dependent upon the States picking up<br />
proposals which would give national standards of road safety<br />
and I hope that the states will, in the light of all the<br />
evidence that's becoming available, respond to that so that<br />
this very substantial increase in funding fro us can take<br />
place. Whether more needs to be done in particular areas is<br />
a matter that we ought to have serious and I think nonpartisan<br />
discussion about with the relevant State<br />
Governments. JOAW LIST: Prime Minister what's your reaction to the High<br />
Court decision on the companies legislation?<br />
PM: eWll, Peter, I haven't had the opportunity of being<br />
briefed on that. I'm told that there's a 6-1 decision I<br />
think against the Commonwealth on that and I've asked for<br />
briefing to be supplied to me. But until I get that I can't<br />
really make a useful comment.<br />
JOURNALIST: Thanks very much.<br />
PU: Good on you. </p>
