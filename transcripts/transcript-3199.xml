SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER,#<br />
THE [ ION, E. G. WHITLAV1, M. Pe.,<br />
TO THE 43RD CONFERENCE OF THE<br />
INTERNATIONAL WOOL TEXTILE ORGANISATION,<br />
SOUTHERN CROSS HOTEL, MELBOURNE,<br />
MONDAY, 1 APRIL 1974<br />
I AM DELIGHTED THAT AUSTRALIA IS HOST FOR<br />
THE FIRST TIME TO A MEETING OF THE INTERNATIONAL WOOL<br />
TEXTILE ORGANISATION. IN AN INDUSTRY RENOWNED FOR<br />
ITS INTERNATIONAL LINKS AND ORGANISATIONS INDEEDI<br />
CAN THINK OF NO INDUSTRY THAT SURPASSES YOURS IN<br />
THIS RESPECT THE I. W. T. O. IS THE LARGEST AND MOST<br />
IMPORTANT ORGANISATION OF WOOL TRADERS, PROCESSORS<br />
AND TEXTILE MANUFACTURERS IN THE WORLD. YOU REPRESENT<br />
26 NATIONS IN EVERY HEMISPHERE, IN EVERY CONTINENT.<br />
IT IS APPROPRIATE THAT AUSTRALIA, AS THE WORLD'S<br />
LARGEST PRODUCER OF WOOL, SHOULD BE THE VENUE FOR<br />
YOUR CONFERENCE. YOUR ORGANISATION HAS BEEN IN<br />
EXISTENCE FOR NEARLY HALF A CENTURY, YET IT WAS ONLY<br />
IN THE LATE 1950' S THAT AUSTRALIA BECAME A FIRM MEMBER.<br />
SO WE HAVE NORMALIZED OUR RELATIONS WITH THE I. W. T. O.<br />
I AM GLAD WE HAVE; AND IF I MAY SAY SO, IT IS HIGH<br />
TIME YOU WERE HERE AS OUR GUESTS, ON BEHALF OF THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT I WELCOME YOU ALL MOST CORDIALLY. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
THERE IS ANOTHER REASON WHY THIS CONFERENCE<br />
SHOULD BRING SPECIAL SATISFACTION TO THE WOOL INDUSTRY IN<br />
AUSTRALIA, NOTHING COULD SYMBOLIZE MORE VIVIDLY THE VITALITY<br />
AND RESILIENCE OF THIS GREAT INDUSTRY IN ALL ITS PHASES,<br />
PRODUCTION, MANUFACTURING AND MARKETING, I HARDLY NEED<br />
REMIND YOU OF THE GLOOM AND FOREBODING IN THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
WOOL INDUSTRY ONLY TWO OR THREE YEARS AGO, MANY WOOLGROWERS<br />
WERE LEAVING THE LAND, MANY OF THE HISTORIC NAMES, PLACES<br />
AND COMPANIES IN THE INDUSTRY WERE IN JEOPARDY, DECLINING<br />
PRICES, COMBINED WITH THE EVER-PRESENT HAZARD OF DROUGHT,<br />
WERE TAKING THEIR TOLL, TODAY THE PROSPECTS ARE MUCH<br />
BRIGHTER; THE INDUSTRY HAS RECOVERED ITS TRADITIONAL<br />
CONFIDENCE, I BELIEVE YOUR CONFERENCE WILL REFLECT AND<br />
STIMULATE THE NEW MOOD OF BUOYANCY AND OPTIMISM IN THE<br />
INDUSTRY, IT WILL REMIND US THAT NATURAL WOOL REMAINS THE<br />
SUPREME FIBRE, AND WHATEVER THE PROBLEMS AND FLUCTUATIONS<br />
YOUR INDUSTRY MUST FACE, ITS UNDERLYING STRENGTH IS BEYOND<br />
QUESTION. P/ 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
You ARE ALL AWARE OF THE SUPREME IMPORTANCE<br />
OF WOOL IN THE HISTORY AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF THIS<br />
COUNTRY, DESPITE A GREATER DIVERSITY IN AUSTRALIA'S EXPORTS<br />
AND A GREATER DIVERSITY OF PRODUCTION WITHIN PRIMARY INDUSTRY<br />
ITSELF, WOOL STILL HOLDS ITS PLACE AS A COMMODITY OF<br />
ENORMOUS IMPORTANCE, ALTHOUGH SHEEP NUMBERS HAVE DECLINED<br />
MARKEDLY IN RECENT YEARS, AUSTRALIA PRODUCES ABOUT ONE-THIRD<br />
OF ALL THE WORLD'S WOOL AND ABOUT HALF OF THE SUPPLIES<br />
ENTERING WORLD TRADE, OUR OWN WOOL TEXTILE INDUSTRY IS<br />
OF CONSIDERABLE SIGNIFICANCE, THEWOOL YARN AND<br />
BROADWOVEN FABRIC INDUSTRY PRODUCES GOODS WORTH $ 129 MILLION<br />
A YEAR AND EMPLOYS MORE THAN 12,000 PEOPLE, NEVERTHELESS,<br />
ABOUT 90% OF OUR WOOL IS EXPORTED, CLEARLY WE HAVE A<br />
VITAL INTEREST IN THE PROSPERITY OF THE WOOL TEXTILE<br />
INDUSTRY OVERSEAS, WOOL PRODUCERS AND WOOL USERS HAVE A<br />
COMMON INTEREST, THEY HAVE THE SAME ULTIMATE CONCERN FOR<br />
THE SUPREMACY OF THEIR BASIC RAW MATERIAL AND THE GROWTH<br />
OF WORLD MARKETS, I BELIEVE THIS CONFERENCE WILL GIVE<br />
ALL OF US SUPPLIERS, PROCESSORS, MANUFACTURERS AN<br />
OPPORTUNITY FOR DIRECT AND VALUABLE PERSONAL CONTACTS<br />
WHICH WILL BENEFIT THE INDUSTRY AS A WHOLE, / 4 </p>
<p>-4-<br />
WHAT I FIND ENCOURAGING IN THE AIMS AND<br />
FUNCTIONS OF YOUR ORGANISATION IS THE EMPHASIS YOU GIVE<br />
TO ORDERLY MARKETING, YOU SEEK TO BRING A PLANNED AND<br />
RATIONAL APPROACH TO THE WORLD TRADE IN WOOL, YOU<br />
PROVIDE A COMMON MEETING POINT FOR COMMERCIAL WOOL<br />
INTERESTS AND ENCOURAGE UNIFORM COMMERCIAL PRACTICES<br />
IN THE WOOL TRADE, THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT SHARES<br />
THOSE AMBITIONS AND APPLAUDS THEM, WE RECOGNISE<br />
YOUR NATURAL INTEREST IN THE WAY RAW WOOL IS MARKETED<br />
HERE IN AUSTRALIA, FOR THAT REASON WE HAVE MADE USE<br />
OF MEETINGS OF YOUR ORGANISATION TO EXPLAIN THE GOVERNMENT'S<br />
WOOL RESERVE PRICE POLICY TO THE INTERNATIONAL WOOL TRADE,<br />
WE INTEND ALSO, AS YOU KNOW, TO ESTABLISH A NATIONAL<br />
AUSTRALIAN WOOL STANDARDS MONITORING UNIT; AND THE<br />
VALUE AND PURPOSE OF THAT UNIT HAS BEEN EXPLAINED AT<br />
SESSIONS OF YOUR ORGANISATION, </p>
<p>IT WILL HELP YOU IF I SAY SOMETHING MORE ABOUT<br />
OUR PLANS FOR WOOL MARKETING IN AUSTRALIA, FOR YEARS THE<br />
WOOL INDUSTRY HAS BEEN SUBJECT TO FLUCTUATING MARKETS AND<br />
UNCERTAIN PRICES, OUR PREDECESSORS REQUESTED THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN WOOL CORPORATION TO REPORT ON THE WOOL<br />
MARKETING SYSTEM, WE RECEIVED THEIR REPORT IN FEBRUARY<br />
AND IMMEDIATELY'MADE IT PUBLIC, THE OPPORTUNITY NOW<br />
EXISTS FOR A FULL AND OPEN PUBLIC DISCUSSION OF THE<br />
REPORT BY ALL INTERESTED PARTIES, BRIEFLY, AS MANY OF<br />
YOU WILL KNOW, THE REPORT RECOMMENDED THAT THE. lWOOL<br />
CORPORATION ACQUIRE ALL EXPORT WOOL AND SELL IT IN<br />
THE WAY IT THINKS BEST EITHER AT AUCTION OR UNDER<br />
CONTRACT; THAT THE CORPORATION HAVE POWER TO ALLOCATE<br />
AMOUNTS OF WOOL TO BE SOLD; AND THAT IT SHOULD STABILIZE<br />
THE PRICE OF WOOL BY ESTABLISHING A FLOOR PRICE OR EVEN<br />
A CEILING PRICE WHERE NECESSARY, THESE RECOMMENDATIONS<br />
ARE BROADLY CONSISTENT WITH THE POLICY OF THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN LABOR PARTY, WHICH STATES THAT THE WOOL<br />
CORPORATION " WILL BE EMPOWERED TO ACQUIRE AND/ OR<br />
MARKET THE AUSTRALIAN WOOL CLIP," </p>
<p>-6-<br />
THE CORPORATION'S REPORT IS NATURALLY A<br />
CONTROVERSIAL ONE, MANY PEOPLE HAVE CONGRATULATED<br />
THE CORPORATION ON THE WORK IT HAS DONE; OTHERS<br />
HAVE BEEN HIGHLY CRITICAL, IT WOULD NOT BE<br />
APPROPRIATE FOR ME TO DISCUSS THE DETAILS OF THE<br />
REPORT TODAY, IT IS CLEARLY RECOGNISED THAT ITS<br />
IMPLICATIONS ARE FAR REACHING AND IF IMPLEMENTED<br />
WOULD CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY THE TRADITIONAL<br />
AUSTRALIAN WOOL MARKETING SYSTEM, THE RECOMMENDATIONS<br />
ARE BEING CLOSELY EXAMINED BY MY COLLEAGUE, THE<br />
MINISTER FOR PRIMARY INDUSTRY, SENATOR WRIEDT, AND<br />
INTERESTED PARTIES CONCERNED WITH WOOL MARKETING,<br />
SENATOR WRIEDT HAS MADE IT CLEAR THAT, JUST AS HE HAD<br />
NO INTENTION OF HURRYING THE CORPORATION INTO COMPLETING<br />
ITS REPORT, HE HAS NO INTENTION OF HURRYING A DECISION<br />
UPON IT UNTIL EVERYONE HAS STUDIED IT CAREFULLY, s17 </p>
<p>-7-<br />
SENATOR WRIEDT HAS ALREADY DISCUSSED THE<br />
REPORT WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF WOOLGROWERS, WOOLBUYERS<br />
AND WOOLBROKERS. HE WILL BE KEEN TO LEARN OF THE<br />
REACTION OF YOUR ORGANISATION AS AN INTERNATIONAL BODY<br />
REPRESENTING THE WOOL INDUSTRY. I EXPECT THE GOVERNMENT<br />
TO DECIDE ITS POLICY ON THE REPORT LATER THIS YEAR AFTER<br />
SENATOR WRIEDT BRINGS PROPOSALS BEFORE THE CABINET,<br />
WE HOPE THE NEW ARRANGEMENTS WILL OPERATE FROM THE MIDDLE<br />
OF NEXT YEAR. I AM SURE SENATOR WRIEDT'S SUBMISSIONS<br />
WILL TAKE ACCOUNT OF THE VIEWS OF ALL THOSE WHO HAVE<br />
DISCUSSIONS WITH HIM. I URGE YOU TO ENSURE THAT HE<br />
RECEIVES YOUR REACTIONS, AT THE SAME TIME, I HOPE<br />
THE DEBATE ON THE MOST APPROPRIATE WOOL MARKETING SYSTEM<br />
WILL NOT BE BASED ON THE SELF-INTEREST OF INDUSTRY GROUPS<br />
BUT WILL BE DIRECTED AT ENSURING THE FUTURE ECONOMIC<br />
STABILITY OF ALL CONCERNED, FROM WOOLGROWERS TO FINAL<br />
PROCESSORS. / 8 </p>
<p>-8-<br />
THERE IS ANOTHER WAY IN WHICH THE GOVERNMENT<br />
CAN ASSIST THE LONG-TERM WELFARE OF THIS GREAT INDUSTRY,<br />
THAT IS BY ENCOURAGING WOOL RESEARCH AND PROMOTION,<br />
MY GOVERNMENT HAS ANNOUNCED A THREE-YEAR SCHEME FOR<br />
THIS PURPOSE BEGINNING IN 1974-75 WE WILL CONTRIBUTE<br />
$ 61,400,000 OVER THE THREE YEARS, I AM GLAD TO SAY<br />
THAT LEGISLATION FOR THIS PROGRAM WAS INTRODUCED IN<br />
THE PARLIAMENT LAST MONTH, BROADLY OUR PURPOSE IS<br />
THAT THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD ASSUME GREATER FINANCIAL<br />
RESPONSIBILITY FOR RESEARCH, WHICH BENEFITS THE NATION<br />
TO'T<br />
AS A WHOLE) AND T44E GROWERS FUNDS, COLLECTED THROUGH<br />
THE WOOL TAX, WILL BE DIRECTED MORE TOWARDS PROMOTION,<br />
THE BUDGETS FOR PROGRAMS OF RESEARCH AND PROMOTION FOR<br />
EACH OF THE 3 YEARS COMMENCING IN 1974-75 HAVE BEEN<br />
DEVELOPED IN CONSULTATION WITH THE AUSTRALIAN WOOL<br />
CORPORATION AND, THROUGH THE CORPORATION, WITH THE<br />
INTERNATIONAL WOOL SECRETARIAT, WITH THE COMMONWEALTH<br />
SCIENTIFIC AND INDUSTRIAL RESEARCH ORGANISATION, AND<br />
WITH THE BUREAU OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS, </p>
<p>-9-<br />
WE BELIEVE THAT WHILE RURAL PRODUCERS BENEFIT<br />
DIRECTLY FROM MANY OF THE RESULTS OF RURAL RESEARCH, THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN COMMUNITY IN GENERAL ALSO BENEFITS IN MANY<br />
WAYS, BENEFITS ACCRUE, FOR EXAMPLE, THROUGH MORE<br />
ASSURED FOOD AND FIBRE SUPPLIES AS A RESULT OF<br />
PRODUCTIVITY INCREASES IN THE RURAL SECTOR, FURTHER,<br />
RESEARCH PROGRAMS IN AGRICULTURAL AND BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES<br />
OFTEN HAVE BROAD IMPLICATIONS FOR THE QUALITY OF THE<br />
ENVIRONMENT GENERALLY, AND FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF THE<br />
PRODUCTIVE CAPACITY OF RENEWABLE RESOURCES,<br />
RECOGNISING THAT THE BENEFITS OF RESEARCH ARE SO<br />
WIDELY DISTRIBUTED, THE GOVERNMENT HAS DECIDED THAT IT WOULD<br />
BE APPROPRIATE FOR A GREATER SHARE OF THE COST TO BE BORNE<br />
BY A CONTRIBUTION FROM PUBLIC FUNDS THAN HAS BEEN THE<br />
CASE IN THE PAST, IN OTHER WORDS, THE GOVERNMENT HAS<br />
DECIDED TO INCREASE ITS SHARE OF THE COST OF THE RESEARCH<br />
PROGRAMS FINANCED FROM THE WOOL RESEARCH TRUST FUND,<br />
ACCORDINGLY, THE GOVERNMENT WILL CONTRIBUTE THREE QUARTERS<br />
OF THE COST OF APPROVED PROGRAMS OF WOOL RESEARCH, TO BE<br />
FINANCED THROUGH THE. WOOL RESEARCH TRUST FUND, DURING THE<br />
SECOND AND THIRD YEARS OF THE FORTHCOMING TRIENNIUM,<br />
WOOL PRODUCERS WILL BE ASKED TO FINANCE THE REMAINING ONE<br />
QUARTER, IN ORDER THAT THERE IS ADEQUATE WARNING OF<br />
THESE CHANGED ARRANGEMENTS, THE PRESENT COST SHARING<br />
ARRANGEMENT WILL BE CONTINUED FOR 1974-75, .1./ 10 </p>
<p>10<br />
WITH REGARD TO WOOL PROMOTION, THE GOVERNMENT HAS<br />
CAREFULLY STUDIED THE PROMOTION ACTIVITIES OF THE<br />
INTERNATIONAL WOOL SECRETARIAT AND THE AUSTRALIAN WOOL<br />
CORPORATION, IT IS AGREED THAT THERE ARE STRONG ECONOMIC<br />
ARGUMENTS IN FAVOUR OF WOOL PROMOTION EXPENDITURE AND THE<br />
BENEFITS OF PROMOTION DO SPREAD TO GROUPS OTHER THAN<br />
WOOL GROWERS, IN ADDITION, THE GOVERNMENT RECOGNISES<br />
THE NEED FOR CONTINUAL DEVELOPMENT AND IMPROVEMENT OF<br />
THE TECHNICAL PROCESSING PROPERTIES OF WOOL AS A FIBRE AND<br />
THE PROMOTION OF THESE ADVANTAGES AT ALL STAGES IN THE<br />
MARKETING CHAIN, IN THIS WAY THE DEMAND FOR WOOL IS<br />
INFLUENCED, BOTH ABSOLUTELY AND IN RELATION TO COMPEToING<br />
FIBRES, WE BELIEVE, HOWEVER, THAT THE BENEFITS FROM<br />
PROMOTION ACCRUE MORE DIRECTLY TO PRODUCERS THAN TO<br />
OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, AND ACCORDINGLY WOOL<br />
GROWERS THEMSELVES SHOULD MAKE THE MAJOR FINANCIAL<br />
COMMITMENT TO PROMOTION EXPENDITURE, ON THIS BASIS<br />
THE GOVERNMENT HAS DECIDED TO FINANCE ONE QUARTER OF<br />
THE PROJECTED WOOL PROMOTION BUDGETS, LEAVING TO WOOL<br />
GROWERS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF FINANCING THE BALANCE,<br />
AGAIN, IN ORDER TO ENSURE ADEQUATE ADVANCE NOTICE OF<br />
THE CHANGED ARRANGEMENTS FOR FINANCING THE PROMOTION<br />
PROGRAMS, THE GOVERNMENT HAS AGREED TO DEFER IMPLEMENTATION<br />
OF THE NEW FUNDING BASIS UNTIL 1975-76, ACCORDINGLY, FOR<br />
1974-75 THE GOVERNMENT WILL CONTINUE TO CONTRIBUTE ON AN<br />
EQUAL BASIS WITH WOOL GROWERS TOWARDS THE COST OF BOTH<br />
RESEARCH AND PROMOTION, I ./ 11 </p>
<p>11<br />
AUSTRALIA IS FULLY COMMITTED TO THE GROWTH AND<br />
PROSPERITY OF THE WOOL INDUSTRY, WE WANT TO REMAIN A<br />
DEPENDABLE SUPPLIER OF WOOL TO THE MARKETS OF THE WORLD,<br />
WE WANT FAIR PRICES FOR OUR WOOL AND A STABLE SYSTEM<br />
OF MARKETING, THIS INDEED IS OUR POLICY FOR THE SUPPLY<br />
OF ALL BASIC RAW MATERIALS TO OUR CUSTOMERS OVERSEAS,<br />
WE BELIEVE THAT THE AUSTRALIAN WOOL INDUSTRY WILL<br />
PROSPER BEST IN THE CONTEXT OF STRONG RURAL INDUSTRIES<br />
GENERALLY, ALL OUR POLICIES HAVE BEEN DIRECTED TO THAT<br />
PURPOSE, OUR CURRENCY REVALUATIONS AND TARIFF POLICIES<br />
HAVE, I BELIEVE, HELPED TO RESTRAIN INCREASES IN THE COST<br />
OF FARM EQUIPMENT, OUR INDUSTRIES ASSISTANCE COMMISSION<br />
HAS BEEN SET UP TO EXAMINE CLAIMS FOR ASSISTANCE FROM<br />
ALL INDUSTRIES PRIMARY AND SECONDARY, WE WANT RURAL<br />
INDUSTRIES THAT CAN STAND ON THEIR OWN FEET, THAT ARE<br />
STRONG AND ADAPTABLE, THAT ARE BUSINESSLIKE AND<br />
EFFICIENT, THAT CAN MEET THE CHALLENGE OF UNCERTAIN<br />
MARKETS AND FLUCTUATING PRICES WITHOUT RELYING<br />
EXCESSIVELY ON GOVERNMENT HANDOUTS AND TAXPAYERS'<br />
SUBSIDIES, ONLY IN THIS WAY CAN WE CREATE GENUINELY<br />
STRONG AND EFFICIENT RURAL INDUSTRIES, A1 </p>
<p>11A<br />
PERHAPS I CAN SUM UP MY GOVERNMENT'S<br />
BROAD INTENTIONS BY QUOTING A STATEMENT BY THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN WOOLGROWERS' AND GRAZIERS' COUNCIL,<br />
THE COUNCIL HAS SAID THIS: " THE MOST IMPORTANT<br />
LONG-TERM STEP THE GOVERNMENT CAN TAKE IS TO IMPROVE<br />
THE EFFICIENCY OF NATIONAL RESOURCE ALLOCATION BY<br />
ENCOURAGING THE EXPANSION OF LESS PROTECTED INDUSTRIES<br />
IN THE ECONOMY ( WHETHER PRIMARY OR SECONDARY) AND<br />
DISCOURAGING THE GROWTH OF THOSE INDUSTRIES WHICH<br />
CAN ONLY PRODUCE WITH THE HELP OF MASSIVE LEVELS<br />
OF ASSISTANCE EITHER SUBSIDY OR TARIFF, THIS WILL<br />
INCREASE THE LEVEL OF REAL ECONOMIC GROWTH FOR THE<br />
BETTERMENT OF THE WHOLE COMMUNITY,. I SUGGEST<br />
THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS DOING JUST WHAT THE WOOLGROWERS'<br />
AND GRAZIERS' COUNCIL SUGGESTED, I BELIEVE OUR<br />
POLICIES WILL BENEFIT THE GREAT RURAL INDUSTRIES<br />
OF THIS COUNTRY AND THE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE AS A WHOLE, / 12 </p>
<p>12<br />
WE HAVE GREAT FAITH IN THE FUTURE OF THE WOOL<br />
INDUSTRY, WE ARE DELIGHTED THAT SO MANY OF ITS<br />
LEADING MEMBERS AUSTRALIA'S GREATEST CUSTOMERS<br />
ARE WITH US THIS WEEK, GOVERNMENTS AND ECONOMISTS<br />
ALONE CANNOT SOLVE THE PROBLEMS OF AN INDUSTRY OR<br />
UNDERSTAND THEM AS WELL AS THE MEN AND WOMEN<br />
DIRECTLY INVOLVED, THERE IS NO SUBSTITUTE FOR<br />
PERSONAL CONTACTS BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS IN REACHING<br />
UNDERSTANDINGS AND CREATING THE CONDITIONS FOR<br />
GENUINE AND LASTING PROGRESS, I WISH YOU EVERY<br />
SUCCESS IN YOUR IMPORTANT DISCUSSIONS AND HAVE GREAT<br />
PLEASURE IN DECLARING OPEN THE 43RD INTERNATIONAL<br />
CONFERENCE OF THE INTERNATIONAL WOOL TEXTILE ORGANISATION, </p>
