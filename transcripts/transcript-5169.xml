PRIME MINISTER TUESDAY, 16 OCTOBER 1979<br />
From the Press Office<br />
SUMMARY OF ABC'S<br />
" PM" found itself in the middle of a heated debate today in<br />
Federal Parliament over the Government's controversial<br />
proposals to change the Conciliation and Arbitration Act.<br />
Last Thursday they were first to reveal the details of a letter<br />
which had been written by Mr. Justice Staples to his fellow<br />
Commissioners criticising the amendments. The crucial issue<br />
in the debate now seems to be who actually leaked the details<br />
of the letter. The Leader of the Opposition, Mr. Hayden, accused<br />
the Minister for Industrial Relations, Mr. Tony Street, of<br />
leaking the letter to the press. However, Mr. Street, while<br />
admitting that members of his staff distributed copies of the<br />
letter to members of the Canberra Press Gallery said it was<br />
only done after the " PM" broadcast on the grounds that it had<br />
now become a matter of public record. Mr. Street and the<br />
Opposition Spokesman on Industrial Relations, Mr. Mick Young,<br />
in Canberra studio:<br />
Question Mr. Street, how do you respond to allegations that your office<br />
leaked that document?<br />
Mr. Street<br />
Well they didn't. My office checked with " PM" to ensure that<br />
the document had in fact become public before I did anything<br />
about it at all. It had been sent to me without comment,<br />
incidentally, by Mr. Justice Staples, a couple of days before.<br />
Question Mr. Street, if I can just put the record straight. " PM" did<br />
cite a copy of that letter, but as you would no doubt would be<br />
aware, we didn't use any specific quotes. We simply wanted to<br />
mention that the letter existed.<br />
Mr. Street<br />
Yes I know. We checked with " PM" to find whether they had in<br />
fact got the letter and they had.<br />
Question But do you think in your office releasing copies of this letter<br />
later to the press that you perhaps acted improperly?<br />
Mr. Street<br />
No I don't. I think that charge could have been laid if I had<br />
been the first to make any comment or release of the document,<br />
but I wasn't. </p>
<p>-2<br />
Question But you do agree that your office did distribute copies<br />
of the letter?<br />
Mr. Street<br />
After we checked that " PM" had had it, yes.<br />
Question Well, Mr. Young, what is wrong with that?<br />
Mr.. Young<br />
I think if you look at the whole episode both of the Minister<br />
releasing a document sent to him by Deputy President Staples,<br />
and added to that that a senior officer of the Minister's<br />
Department actually briefed a journalist from the Press Gallery,<br />
I think it is absolutely outrageous behaviour by the Office of<br />
the Minister, both by the Senior Officer who did it and by the<br />
Minister's decision to release that document. I don't think there<br />
could be any excuse for it. . As you said in your introduction,<br />
" PM" admitted to citing the document. If you look at the<br />
transcript of " PM" of last Thursday night, there are now quotes<br />
from the letter and the Minister was bulldozed into making a<br />
very, very bad decision, and it brings into question anybody<br />
in future who wants to sent correspondence to this Minister, or<br />
to other Ministers. Because recently we had the example of<br />
Mr. Viner getting hold of a personal letter that was sent from<br />
Dr. Everingham, the Shadow Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, to<br />
Gulluwruy Yunupingu, and Mr. Viner produced that letter in<br />
Parliament under privilege, which was a personal letter.<br />
Question But Mr. Street has said of course that once it was revealed on<br />
" PM" that the letter existed it was therefore a matter of public<br />
record. Isn't that fair enough?<br />
Mr. Young<br />
If someone leaked the document to and they hadn't done<br />
that " PM" said they had cited it, but didn't quote it, that<br />
doesn't relieve the minister or release the Minister to any<br />
unethical conduct, which is as I believe that's what it was in<br />
the end, because the document had been sent to Mr. Street and<br />
the originator of the document didn't have in mind that the<br />
Minister was going to sit down and give it out to all the press<br />
and then have a Senior officer of his Department actually brief<br />
someone.<br />
Question Mr. Street, how do you respond to that? / 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
Mr. Street<br />
Well, as I say, I never intended or thought of releasing it<br />
to the press until it became a public document.<br />
Question Mr. Young, if Mr. Street's actions are improper, what do you<br />
want him to do. Should he resign?<br />
Mr. Young<br />
It's not so much Mr. Street, it's the whole Government. If you<br />
have a look at all the scandals we have had in this Governmentand<br />
they usually throw their hands up in the air and say " look,<br />
we didn't know". The whole excuse for this Government when<br />
they make a mess of anything, and at the moment the Government<br />
is making a mess of industrial relations, is to plead ignorance.<br />
Well nobody in Australia believes any longer that this<br />
Government can plead ignornance when they make these mistakes.<br />
The fact is Mr. Fraser has taken over industrial relations in<br />
this country and he intends to make an unholy mess of it.<br />
Question If I cou ' ld just come in there. Mr. Young, you mentioned earlier,<br />
I don't think Mr. Street knows, that Mr. Young, just, before<br />
he came to air, put out a statement in which he said that it<br />
was understood, Mr. Street, that a senior officer of your<br />
Department gave a detailed briefing on the Staples letter to<br />
a newspaper journalist. Is that true?<br />
Mr. Street<br />
I wasn't aware of it. But as I say, if the document had by<br />
then become a public one, I can see nothing wrong in that.<br />
And as I say<br />
Question There would be nothing ( inaudible)<br />
Mr. Street<br />
Not if it was a public document at the time.<br />
Question Specifically, though, Mr. Young, what do you think should be<br />
Mr. Young<br />
I mean the Minister must obviously be joking. Firstly he says<br />
he doesn't know whether the Senior Officer did this. But I mean<br />
no-one can do anything in his Department surely, without the<br />
Minister knowing and getting approval. I mean what are we<br />
running here. We are not running a cakeshop. You can't have<br />
senior Ministers of the Department running around saying " look,<br />
the Minister doesn't know, but I think I will hop up to the<br />
Press Gallery and give someone a briefing about a confidential<br />
document". I mean who else is going to write to the Minister </p>
<p>-4<br />
Mr. Young ( continued)<br />
for Industrial Relations. What happens if Sir John Moore,<br />
the President of the Bench, writes to Mr. Street. Does a<br />
senior officer go running up to the Press Gallery and say<br />
I will give a further explanation of this because it is for<br />
the benefit of the Government that I do it. I mean obviously<br />
there has got to be confidence, and there has got to be<br />
ethical conduct between the parties.<br />
Question Do you concede that, Mr. Street though, that there does have<br />
to be confidence between well, particularly in this case<br />
senior Judges and a Minister like yourself.<br />
M4r. Street<br />
Of course, but this document was not prepared for me. It was,<br />
as I understand.' it, prepared by Mr. Justice Staples for his<br />
Conciliation and Arbitration Commission colleagues. It was<br />
distributed to them and a copy came to me with a " with compliments"<br />
slip. As: I say, * 1 wouldn't have intended to make it public<br />
had it not become so by some other means.<br />
Question<br />
Mr. Street, if I could just look at the whole substance of<br />
this legislation which has created, as you know, somewhat of<br />
a storm. Last night on our programme, Mr. Hawke said that<br />
the legislation itself is now opposed by the. ACTU, the Labor<br />
Party, senior Judges, a former President of the Commission,<br />
and indeed, some Senators within your own Party. Are you still<br />
going to persist with the legislation?<br />
Mr. Street<br />
Yes we will, because for four reasons really: there is a<br />
need to get the greatest degree of consistency internally in<br />
the Commission in its wages decisions and the requirement<br />
for Commissioners to consult it doesn't take away their right<br />
to make an ultimate decision, but is designed to get greater<br />
consistency; there is a need for the President to be able to<br />
take over a dispute at any time, or any of the parties or the<br />
Minister to seek a Full Bench--that need has been demonstrated<br />
in recent days--not having it made a great deal of industrial<br />
disruption; and there is finally, a need to protect the<br />
public interest where the safety, health and welfare<br />
of the community is involved. So, yes, we intend to go ahead<br />
with it for all those reasons.<br />
Question But given the resistance that has grown just in the last few<br />
days for the legislation, does it now mean that there going to<br />
be open warfare between you and the Commission?<br />
Mr. Street<br />
No I wouldn'It thiLnk so. </p>
<p>Question Could it be avoided?<br />
Mr. Street<br />
Yes, of course it can, because the institutions which are<br />
set up by the Parliament and the legislation that they<br />
operate under are required to operate in accordance with the<br />
law, and that applies to a range of institutions, including<br />
this one, so long as the constitutional requirements are met<br />
and our advice is that they have been.<br />
Question<br />
Mr. Young, a final word from you. You, the Opposition, have<br />
said much about the legislation. But do you see that it is<br />
going to go through, that there is nothing that can be done?<br />
Mr. Young<br />
Well, the Opposition would have said a lot more except the<br />
Government steamrolled the legislation through the House of<br />
Reps. The gag was used continuously for two days so we couldn't<br />
explain our point of view fully and we didn't get an explanation<br />
or an interpretation from the Government. What Mr. Street<br />
says on behalf of the Government is absolutely nonsense. We've<br />
got 25 Commissioners for the first time in the history of the<br />
Commission have got together and said: " look, we are concerned<br />
about the operation of this Bill once the laws are implemented.<br />
We don't know how it is going to interfere with the traditional<br />
relationship between ourselves and the Government, the parties<br />
that come before us, ourselves and the Presidential members."<br />
There is a new de-registration order which can only be described<br />
as Draconian, and it is just another example of a wholesale<br />
mess as far as legislation is-concerned and a desire by the<br />
Prime Minister of Australia to bring about a wholesale confrontation<br />
with the trade union movement in order to win some political<br />
advantage.. Everybody in Australia should understand that now<br />
we have the most unpopular Prime Minister in the history of<br />
Australia and that's the way he hopes to get out of the mess<br />
that he has created for himself.<br />
Mr.' Street<br />
It is important to recognise that what the Government proposes<br />
is to protect the public interest and the welfare of the<br />
Australian community. If other parties care to oppose it,<br />
well that is their business. We don't intend to abdicate<br />
our responsibility of the Australian community.<br />

In Western Australia the State Minister for Labour and<br />
Industry foreshadowed tough new legislation to deal with<br />
the trade unions in Western Australia. The Bill will be<br />
introduced into the West Australian Parliament tonight.<br />
Little was known about the Western Australian Government's<br />
intentions until a rally was held outside Parliament this<br />
afternoon. About 350 people attended the demonstration in<br />
support of the Government organised by a group called<br />
" People Against Union Dictatorship".<br />
The Australian Opera Company is under criticism at the<br />
moment for being too expensive, too elitist and plagued with<br />
managerial infighting. It was reported at the weekend that<br />
the Australia Council is preparing an inquiry into opera in<br />
Australia, particularly into the Board of the Australian Opera<br />
Company. Interview with George Dreyfus..<br />
After several months of speculation, N. S. W. finally has a new<br />
Police Conumissioner. The Premier announced today that Acting<br />
Commissioner Lees has been appointed: interviewed.<br />
Queensland Parliament came down to earth today from the more<br />
spectacular heights of allegations of bribery and corruption<br />
to the lowly and serious question of whether a lavatory door<br />
should swing inwards or outwards. Interview with Mr. Lester,<br />
Member forPink Downs 000---</p>
