PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING, MP,<br />
DOORSTOP INTERVIEW, RAAF FAIRBAIRN, SEPTEMBER 20,1992.<br />
E OE PROOF COPY<br />
J: ( inaudible).. result in Quecnsland?<br />
PM: Well, let's say I think it's an important result for the Queensland Labor<br />
Party, for Wayne Goss, and I think a bad result for the Liberal Party because they<br />
spent just on a million dollars there, trying to berate the Federal Labor<br />
Government. So there's no comfort for the Liberal Party in this. And, also, their<br />
claim that this is the end of the decade of Labor, I think that's just a bit premature.<br />
J: ( The conservatives) are claiming a swing of about four per cent against<br />
Labor in marginal federal seats.<br />
PM: Well, that's what they're down to. Next thing they'll be down to two and<br />
three per cent swings in municipal wards. I mean, they're flat out finding some<br />
comfort in this, and even that we'd need to analyse. The fact of the matter is, the<br />
Federal Liberal Party spent a lot of money here trying to say that this should be<br />
fought on Federal issues and, basically, I'm afraid, Dr Hewson and Mr Robb have<br />
taken a big loss, a big L. O. S. S.<br />

<p>1: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: , Well, I'm going to J apan,. and to Singapore and to Cambodia but to<br />
Japan and Singapore, not,-on any initiative or to address particular things but to take<br />
the opportunity of a general discussion about development in the region, about the<br />
bilateral relationship between Australia and Japan, about trade trends generally in<br />
the world, and doing the same thing in Singapore. Now, I'm quite sure Japan has<br />
not been pleased by the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition, but they are a<br />
mature country, they're used to other countries arguing with them about particular<br />
things, and that's why I won't have any problems, I don't think, making it clear that<br />
Labor will maintain a good, working, friendly relationship with Japan and, of<br />
course, absolutely, with Singapore.<br />
J-( inaudible)<br />
PM: Well, I said something about that yesterday. Thk motor industry is arguing<br />
with the stridency of Dr Hewson. The fact is that with zero tariffs they'd basically<br />
be wiped out. The Government's made the right judgment about tariffs, we've<br />
brought tariffs down but not to the point where we won't have an industry.<br />
Thank you.<br />
