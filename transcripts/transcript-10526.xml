    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to announce the appointment of Mr Hiroshi Saito, Chairman of Nippon Steel Corporation, as an Honorary Companion in the General Division of the Order of Australia in recognition of his outstanding contribution to Australia-Japan business relations.</p>
<p>Mr Saito has played a leading role in the development of Australia's raw materials export trade to Japan and in the promotion of Japanese investment in major Australian investment links. These trade and investment links have been vitally important to the prosperity of both countries and underpin our contemporary partnership with Japan. Mr Saito's contribution to the Japan-Australia Business Cooperation Committee as a long-serving member and chairman typifies the genuine warmth and commitment on both sides of our bilateral economic relationship.</p>
<p>On behalf of the Australian Government I warmly congratulate Mr Saito.</p>
<p>14 October 1997</p>
