Twenty-one organisations across Australia will share $60 million to help build community-based accommodation for adults with severe or profound disability.</p>
<p>People with disability need access to a range of supported accommodation models that will allow them, and their carers, to participate as valued members of their communities.</p>
<p>The Supported Accommodation Innovation Fund will help address a shortfall in supported accommodation and respite for people with disability.</p>
<p>It will encourage innovation and drive change in the way supported accommodation services are provided.</p>
<p>Negotiations for funding agreements are in progress with the successful 21 organisations, which will be responsible for 27 projects, providing 169 new supported accommodation and respite places across the country.</p>
<p>This is 19 more places than we originally committed to delivering.   </p>
<p>The new places will be available to people with severe or profound disability.</p>
<p>Some of the places will be provided for people with ageing carers or people in rural and remote communities, and there are specific projects that will be provided for Indigenous communities.</p>
<p>The new innovative accommodation includes a vertical village with an accessible gym, and homes designed with leading edge technologies based on world's best practice in sustainable housing, including home automation with motion detected lighting, and electronic devices to enhance hearing and speech difficulties.</p>
<p>This initiative will also help reduce the number of young people with disability who are cared for in nursing homes, or those at risk of placement in residential aged care.</p>
<p>These projects, which are to be completed by June 2014, build on the Australian Government's $100 million capital injection in 2008 to build more than 300 supported accommodation places, which are on track to be delivered this year.</p>
