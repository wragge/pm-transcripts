PRESS, RADIO AND TELEVISION CONFERENCE<br />
GIVEN BY THE FRIME MINISTER THE RT. HON.<br />
SIR ROBERT MENZIES _ AT CANBERRA ON SUNDAY,<br />
19th JULY, 1964.<br />
PRIME MINISTER Subject to your concurrence, I think the best thing<br />
for me to do would be to make so-me general statements of my own<br />
about this conference. Those statements may cover some of uhe<br />
questions that you have in mind, but it will make, I think, for<br />
coherence if I just say scmething on my own account first.<br />
There are two things to be said about this<br />
conference which is the ninth consecutive Prime Ministers' conference<br />
that I have attended, The first is that there were eighteen Prime<br />
Ministers or Presidents in attendance, There was a great variety<br />
of views and, of course, that meant that the work of the Chair was<br />
uncommonly difficult because there were eighteen of us all not<br />
unwilling to say something about one p.: oblem or another and if we<br />
were to get through, -chis required great patience on the part of<br />
the Chairman, Sir Alec Home, and he certainly exhibited that<br />
patience in a remarkable fashion. He was tactful5 he enlivened<br />
the proceedings from time to tim3 with a little humour if things<br />
threatened to become a little tense and he was, whenever firmness<br />
was required on the part of the United Kingdom, admirably firm,<br />
Everybody, I think, at the conference regarded his contribution<br />
to the conference and to the result as quite outstanding. I think<br />
it is very proper that that should be said.<br />
Well, in comparing this conference with those<br />
that have taken place in the past I am able of course to look<br />
back over a fairly long period would say that the debates on<br />
this occasion were more active, more forceful, perhaps in some<br />
respects more assertive, than in the paste That was inevitable,<br />
and not a bad thing. There was also, particularly on the part of<br />
the newer members of the conference, a tendency to look for<br />
majo*-ities. Every now and then, somebody would say, " I would like<br />
to move such and such" and he would need to be cold that we don't<br />
have resolutions or votes or majorities or minorities in a Prime<br />
Ministers' conference. We meet to exchange our views with frankness<br />
and to learn something from each other.<br />
There is a disposition, and I pointed it out<br />
myself more than once, to regard the Commonwealth Prime Ministers'<br />
meeting as a sort of a sub-committee of the United Nations that<br />
brings in all these United Nations techniques. Now that in my<br />
opinion is no good. This is something quite different from the<br />
United Nations and I think ultimately that view came to be accepted.<br />
Now it would be foolish to pretend that there were<br />
not periods in this conference which were periods of tension, where<br />
sharp disagreement might have resulted in some sort of deadlock,<br />
but these were surmounted. I don't know whether you surmount a<br />
turning point, but still, don't hold me to a precision of language,<br />
The first related to the problem of. Malaysia.<br />
Now this, of course, has tremendous importance for us and I made a<br />
number of contributions on this point, emphasising the importance<br />
of Malaysia and emphasising the fact, which I said was beyond<br />
question, that Malaysia was not only recognised by the Prime<br />
Ministers themselves, because we had done that at the earlier<br />
meeting, but had been recognised by and admitted to the United </p>
<p>Nations, and that Malaysia was therefore an independent country<br />
within the Commonwealth, as entitled to the preservation of its<br />
own political integrity and physical integrity as any other member<br />
of the Commonwealth, or indeed as any other free nation in the<br />
United Nations, and that we ought to say so, but above all things,<br />
we ought to make it clear that the aggression against Malaysia was<br />
to be condemned and that we supported Malaysia in her resistance<br />
to it. Now that may seem simple enough but there was some<br />
difficulty over it because some of those represented believed that<br />
much might be done by negotiation with Soekarno or by negotiation<br />
of a general kind. What I was emphasising was that although only<br />
some members of the Commonwealth would find it within their power<br />
to give military aid to Malaysia, at least everybody should give<br />
moral aid to Malaysia, not only inside the United Nations but<br />
round the world in the posts in which they were represented.<br />
ltimately, we got a result or that which I -hcught pretty good<br />
because after a good deal of discussion, it was agreed in t. u<br />
communique not only and I am looking at the words of it that<br />
efforts would be maintained to resist aggression from without or<br />
subversion from within, but the conmunique then went on to say<br />
" In this connection they ( that! s the Prime Ministers, all of<br />
them) assured the Prime Minister of Malaysia of their sympathy<br />
and support in his efforts to preserve the sovereign independence<br />
ana integrity of his country,"<br />
There was a good deal of discussion about the word " support" to<br />
which there was opposition originally in some quarters. It was<br />
made clear that support didn't necessarily mean kil. tary supporG,<br />
of course. It might mean moral support for some people might<br />
give their support diplomatically, others in other ways. Finally,<br />
without labouring the matter, we had a unanimous agreement on the<br />
words I have lust quoted and I am sure that this sent the Tunku<br />
Abdul Rahman away with a good deal more comfore in his mind about<br />
the attitude of the Commonwealth.<br />
The other problem was the problem of Southern Rhodesia<br />
and that perhaps is worth a little explanation. It was agreed<br />
from the very beginning, and indeed it had to be, that the problem<br />
of Southern Rhodesia and the accession to independence of Southern<br />
Rhodesia was one to be handled by the Government of the United<br />
Kingdom. It is, for this purpose, the colonial power and it must<br />
deal with that problem in discussion with the Government of Southern<br />
Rhodesia and any other groups in Sohthern Rhodesia who may be<br />
brought into conference. Now that was important. This was a<br />
problem for the United Kingdom. Well then, of course, there was<br />
at once a division of view. I maintain what is apparently the<br />
old-fashioned view that if Great Britain is accepted as the<br />
negotiating power and the only one at the table competent to carry<br />
on the negotiations, she ought not to be handicapped by a lot of<br />
advice or as I put it myself riding instructions. Certainly<br />
not to receive orders from a number of governments without the<br />
responsibility or authority to deal with the matter.<br />
The African countries, broadly, most of them took the<br />
view that this was so important that they ought to have their<br />
views recorded. Well, a very curious thing happened about that.<br />
~ h had a little discussion as to whether these things ought to<br />
be done in formal meeting, as if we were laying down the rules, or<br />
in an informal meeting. So we had an informal meeting on Southern<br />
Rhodesia. You must understand that there is a mystique about<br />
things. If you sit in the big room and you have microphones in<br />
front of you that's a formal meeting, and if you move into the<br />
next room and you don't have microphones, that's an informal / 3<br />
I </p>
<p>meting. These are things not to be understood readily by the<br />
laity, So we went into the small room just the Prime Ministers<br />
with one adviser, and we had a discussion about Southern Rhodesia<br />
and views were expressed. One of them was that there ought to<br />
be no independence on the part of Southern Rhodesia until there<br />
was a provision for majority rule. In other words, until the<br />
African had a vote as well as the European. The answer to that,<br />
very simply, was that the United Kingdom Government had made that<br />
clear long since and indeed it is implicit in the pesEit<br />
Constitution of Southern Rhodesia. However, it never prevents<br />
us from hammering away at a point to discover that it has been<br />
conceded before we start, and the communique ultimately recorded<br />
the fact that the United Kingdom had made this statement and that<br />
it was received with approval.<br />
In the second place, it was said that there ought to be<br />
a constitutional conference. Well, no doubt, that is a very<br />
sensible thing to have and it has usually occurred in the past<br />
when territories or colonies have received their independence,<br />
but whether we should say so in a communique is a different matter<br />
because that might look liie an instruction, and I saw no reason<br />
why we should be giving instructions to the only Government that<br />
had to handle the problem. A very delicate problem because<br />
there are very strong feelings in Southern Rhodesia which one<br />
can understand and I am no great believer myself in giving what<br />
may appear to be instructions to a negotiating party wiLich has<br />
a very delicate negotiation on its plate. However, that is a<br />
difference of approach. Ultimately in the communique., it was<br />
set out as the view of some of the Prime Ministers and I would<br />
say that it wasn't the view of every Prime Minister in substance<br />
but some required that it should be stated in the communique<br />
for their own good local reasons,<br />
Then it was also said that the political p2isoners<br />
because there are one or two of them who are in gaol or held<br />
incommunicado in some way ought to be released. Now, of<br />
course, that's an interesting matter. I woiJd think that if<br />
you are going to have a negotiation with somebody he ought to be<br />
out of gaol when you have it, but the question was whether the<br />
communique should say that these people should be released.<br />
Well, they are in prison under the order of the Government of<br />
Southern Rhodesia. The British Government can't release them<br />
because Southern Rhodesia is in full control of all these<br />
matters herself and has been for a long time. All the British<br />
Government could do would be to try to persuade the Southern<br />
Rhodesian Government to let them out, at any rate for the<br />
purposes of a conference. But that again seemed to me to be<br />
a matter for the United Kingdom itself, depending on how their<br />
negotiations with Southern Rhodesia were going.<br />
I got into a little trouble over this. I was going<br />
to say " I'm sorry to say" but I'm not sure that I am sorry to<br />
say because I said thC.-' in the communique it ought to be made<br />
clear that this was not a unanimous statement by Prime Ministers<br />
because I did not believe in giving instructions or advice<br />
publicly in a communique to the British Government on a matter<br />
which was the British Government's business and not mine. Some<br />
people present thought and offered to say that I was advocating<br />
the imprisonment of political opponents. I regret to tell you<br />
I took the opportunity of saying that I was one of the few at<br />
the table who didn't imprison his political opponents.<br />
Therefore my position was not to be misrepresented. However,<br />
as you have seen in the communique, these particular views were<br />
stated and as there was perhaps some attempt to misrepresent<br />
my position, I have stated it here. I don't advocate the a e / 4 </p>
<p>imprisonment of political opponents. I don't advocate not holding<br />
a conference on a matter of this kind but above allthings) I do<br />
advocate not cruelling the pitch for the man who hi: s to do the<br />
batting on it in negotiations. However, the commuunique very<br />
fairly states that that view was expressed. I just indicate that<br />
it wasn't a unanimous one.<br />
That took an awful lot of thrashing out, particularly<br />
when we got to the communique because, very understandably, a lot<br />
of the new African countries have commitments at home and they<br />
have strong views in their ovmn countries and I, myself, had no<br />
objection to them stating those because they needed to be understood<br />
in their own countries, but I don't want my position to be<br />
misunderstood either.<br />
That reminds me that there was an interesting aspect of<br />
this conference, You know, Prime Ministersf conferences are held<br />
in private and all the papers th-at you receive~ and all the re cords<br />
of the proceedings are heavily marked. " Private and Confidential",<br />
but I found that in a great number of cases the speeches that were<br />
being made were written and handed out even before they were<br />
delivered which no doubt was very convenient from the point of view<br />
of the London Press but seemed -to me to be a little difficul;* to<br />
reconcile with having a private meeting, and as I don't read my<br />
speeches at these conferences, there was nothing to hand out. Sc<br />
if you read the London Press, you wou~ ld be hard put to find out<br />
if I had said anything, but I said a good deal, but in private, in<br />
a private conference.<br />
Again, I don't com,, pILain about this. I think what we<br />
have to understand is that this is a very different Commonwealth.<br />
This is now a meeting of a large nuimber of communities axnd governmenL<br />
s which have different histories and different ideras about<br />
how these things ought to be done. We can't -impose our somewhat<br />
old-fashioned views on these matters on new people. We have to<br />
remember that the agitation about political independence these<br />
emerging colonies has been hard and strong, that it continues after<br />
they hav! e received their independence, and that political factors<br />
persist to a degree which would be impossible for us to understand<br />
because we have been accustomed to political independence for many<br />
years and we realise that our main business relates to matters<br />
other than the securing of independence from some colonial control,<br />
but the newer ones are very much taken up with this matter still<br />
and the result is that in a group of eighteen people, seventeen<br />
of whom represent what were once colonial territories, we still<br />
hear about colonialism and imperialism. W-yell, of course, everybody<br />
who was there was there because in his particular case colonialism<br />
had ended, and from a reasonable point of view, I didn't find it<br />
necessary to discuss colonialism very much. It seemed to me to be<br />
a matter of past history, but it still exists not only in their<br />
vocabulary but in their minds.<br />
The first thing that a Prime Minister of the old Commonwealth<br />
has to adjust himself to is that although this is not his<br />
vocabulary and these are not his ideas, they do exist and they must<br />
be received and understood. Indeed it was one of the fascinating<br />
things about this conference that although these matters give rise<br />
to great passion in some of the countries concerned, and although<br />
the debate was extremely vigorous in London, there was at no time<br />
any personal conflict at all. The personal relations between all<br />
representatives were extraordinarily good.<br />
Another matter perhaps I ought to mention, because it<br />
concerns us here. You will have seen in the communique that there<br />
is a somewhat brief reference to China. Two or three of us had<br />
devoted a good deal of attention to explaining the outward thrust<br />
a 1 </p>
<p>of China and the aggressive nature of Chinese communism and its<br />
impact on South-East Asia. There was a tendency to brush this<br />
aside, particularly on the part of the Africa-n countries because<br />
it was-said that was cold wa-r talk and the cold war was an irrelevant<br />
thing to the Commonwealth and Commonwealth considerations. This<br />
is based upon some idea that the cold war is a sort c' domestic<br />
conflict between the United States and Communist powers. Well, I<br />
did my best to explain that matter; I am afraid not with very much<br />
success. I even venture to say that if the Western powers had<br />
not been successful in the cold war so far, we might not have been<br />
sitting there having a conference. But I wouldn't have you take<br />
that as the universal view. In fact, the reference, ' he nature of<br />
the reference to China in the communique rather reflects -' Vhe<br />
predominance, for this purpose, of the view that the cold war ought<br />
not to be brought int-o our statem: nt and ought not -to be referred<br />
to as a live issue. Well, that is not a matter that one argues<br />
about forever bec ause I am pecrfectly free to state my views on the<br />
cold war whether they are in the communique or not, and of course<br />
the same goes for a number of the other Prime Ministers who -, e: e<br />
there. Well, now, so far I have spoken to you about some of the<br />
turning points in the conference, all of them happily resolved so<br />
that we were able to get an agreed-upon document at the end which<br />
was very good, but beyond that, I think that the Conference produced<br />
some positive results.<br />
Now take the Commonwealth Secretariat. It is quite true<br />
that the form of the Secretariat isnit yet determined. The official<br />
committees are to go to work to discover how you set up the<br />
Secretariat. its functions are very broadly described in one<br />
passage that some of you may have in your minds. I have it here;<br />
" They therefore instructed officials to consider the best<br />
basis for establishing a Commonwealth Secretariat which<br />
would be available, inter Iaj. ia, to disseminate factual<br />
information to all imember countries on matters of common<br />
conceirn, to assist existing agencies ir the promotion of<br />
Coninonwealth links in all fields, and to help to co-ordinate<br />
the preparation of future meetings of Commonwealth heads of<br />
government."<br />
Now this was a very interesting thing because back before the war,<br />
I suggested a Commonwealth Se. retariat and later on, during the<br />
war and shortly afterwards, this received no support. I felt that<br />
we ought to have a small central body which could help to prepare<br />
these meetings and see that we were well informed about each otherrs<br />
problems before we met, There is nothing more exasperating than<br />
to have somebody raise a problem in relation to his own country,<br />
a country of which you know nothing and therefore you are in no<br />
position to assess the significance of the problem. If all this<br />
were done ahead and circulated, I think we would have better results<br />
and perhaps better results in a shorter time.<br />
On this occasion, this proposal was put forward by the<br />
African countries themselves and received general approval, with the<br />
result that work is being done to establish a Commonwealth Secretariat,,<br />
When I look back and I recall that in a week or two before the<br />
meeting there were gloomy prophecies that the whole thing would<br />
break up, this meeting would be the last meeting indeed I was<br />
very conscious of its difficulties -and dangers myself it is<br />
very interesting to realise that one of the things that has come<br />
out of the meeting is that for the first time in the history of the<br />
Cor~ onwealth thqre is to be established a Secretariat whicha is based<br />
on the proposition that the Commonwealth is a continuing thing<br />
an enduring thing and that the machinery ought to be made available<br />
9 9 a 9 */ 6 </p>
<p>-6-<br />
to enable it to continue more effectively. That, I think, was quite<br />
a remarkable achievement and a very powerful answer to the pessimists.<br />
And in the second place, the Government of the United<br />
Kingdom put forward a series of concrete proposals for mutual aid<br />
in development, for a Commonwealth Foundation, for a medical<br />
conference for a variety of matters of that kind, and these were,<br />
in principle, completely accepted by the conference. I suppose<br />
that if there hadn't been so much debate on Southern Rhodesia<br />
and matters of that kind, a good deal mere discussion might have<br />
occurred on these points, but at least it is interesting to note<br />
that they were in principle accepted all round the table and that<br />
machinery is in course of being established to work out these<br />
matters so as to reduce them to sonme sort of concrete form. At<br />
the present time, some of them are a little vague of necessity.<br />
But I believe myself that a great deal of good will come<br />
out of these positive proposals. That is anuther positive achievement<br />
of the conference. I would like it, myself, to have pernaps<br />
gone on further, but you know, in the present year of grace, if a<br />
couple of Ministers come along as they did Mr. Heath came along<br />
and Mr. Maudling the Chancellor of the Exchequer and they talked<br />
about economic aid and economic development most of us had a<br />
tendency to assume the posture of a fellow who is on the receiving<br />
line which, as we were reminded once or twice, makes it a little<br />
difficult for the United Kingdom which has its own problems of a<br />
financial order. But at the same time, I think that when these<br />
matters have been analysed and some of them go into effect, wo<br />
will find that this has been a real step forward in having inside<br />
the Commonwealth something that doesn't necessarily apply to other<br />
people, some joint undertaking, some practice, some e:: peLience in<br />
co-operative work between Commonwealth countries as such, which<br />
can do nothing but good for the future.<br />
Well, now, I am sorry to be talking so long on this<br />
matter, but I think that if you don't mind I would like to tell<br />
you that there are one or two things that are to be learned from<br />
a conference of this kind. I know that I am in process of learning<br />
them and I think that we will all have to learn them.<br />
The first is that we must become accustomed to the fact,<br />
for some little time, that the newer countries will continue to<br />
hammer at matters which we regard as closed issues. I will just<br />
mention one of them, this question of colonialism and imperialism.<br />
I made an innocent enquiry at one stage as to whether it<br />
might be thought fit the next time somebody passed a resolution<br />
about imperialism if they said this means Russian imperialism,<br />
Chinese imperialism and Indonesian imperialism. I think this<br />
jeu d'esprit of mine wasn't altogether successful. But these<br />
things will go on and I don't mind, and I hope nobody will mind;<br />
they are the aftermath of what h. s been in some cases very<br />
painful experiences and therefore one musn't be surprised to find<br />
them manifesting themselves at a time when you and I would have<br />
thought the issue had been concluded in favour of freedom.<br />
And the second thing is this: That words don't always<br />
mean the same thing. Well, we are familiar with that aren't we,<br />
in some ways? But it comes as a little bit of a shock to realise<br />
occasionally that a lot of expressions that are with us almost<br />
cliches are completely misunderstood or understood in a different<br />
sense. Fro example, in the communique you will see a reference to<br />
" representative institutions" in Southern Rhodesia. The United<br />
Kingdom Government had said that they would not grent independence<br />
until fully representative institutions had been established. I<br />
9. */ 7 </p>
<p>-7<br />
think I can put my finger on that<br />
" They welcomed the decision already announced by the<br />
British Government that as in the case of other territories,<br />
the existence of sufficiently representative institutions<br />
would be a condition of the grant of independence to<br />
Southern Rhodesia."<br />
Well, one or two of my colleagues said, " But, we don't understand<br />
that. We dcn't have institutions." You know, as if one were talking<br />
about the Institution of Manlagement or something of this kind. This<br />
is a simple illustration of how you can &amp; o wrong. And therefore,<br />
what's the use of talking about " rerresentative institutions?"<br />
" Do you want institutions that will be represented?" You see?<br />
And it had to be explained fromn our point of view that the<br />
representative institution of a nation is parliament and that this<br />
meant an elected body which would be concerned with the government<br />
of the country. Well, it's wor~ h just tucking that away in tri3<br />
corner of the mind.<br />
And then it wan~ without its amusing aspects there<br />
was a constant demand that in Southern Rhodesia there should be<br />
one man one vote. And. I said, " Well that is, of course, an<br />
expression with which we are very familiar in my country one man<br />
one vote. This of course is the very d'-finition of democracy,<br />
but with us i~ t means one free man, one free vote with a choice.<br />
You can't have one man one vote in a one-party State." This<br />
proposition of mine was reCeiv~ ed with horror, naturally, by one or<br />
two or three people who hiave one-party States and to whom one man<br />
one vcte if it means anything, means something quite different<br />
from what we have in mind. I was hoping, as I told them, that this<br />
might be cleared up so that Southern Rhodesia would know in which<br />
interpretation the phrase was to be employed. But there again, we<br />
must just accommodate ourselves to this.<br />
It is very foolish to imagine that you are dealing with<br />
eighteen democracies at this conference because you are not Tf<br />
you were to say to us in Australia, " Let all parties except one be<br />
prohibited," you would say, " Well no longer are we a emocracy" l and<br />
yet that is the rule in some of the countries represented around<br />
the conference table, and I always hiave to say to myself as I say<br />
to you, it is not for us when we have granted freedom to a country<br />
to determine what system of government it will employ. It will<br />
adopt the system it likes best, and in the early days, particularly<br />
of new countries, there is a greater tendency to authoritarian<br />
control, to a strong central administration than there is in a<br />
politically older country with an older experience of political<br />
affairs. So that there are these things to be learned and to be<br />
obtained out of the conference.<br />
But going back to where I started, I would say that taking<br />
it on the whole, taking the difficulties with the results, taking<br />
above all the personal atmosphere that existed at the conference,<br />
this conference was a success and although it of course doesn't<br />
guarantee the future of the Commonwealth, it I believe, makes a<br />
very strong contribution to the continuance of the Commonwealth and<br />
I believe that as time goes on, Prime Ministers' Conferences will<br />
be able to direct more and more of their time to matters of material<br />
substance in relation to the well-being of the countries and<br />
perhaps a little less time to these problems of political independence<br />
which attracted a good deal of our attention on this occasion. e / 8 </p>
<p>8-<br />
Well, I am sorry to have taken so long over that. I am<br />
now in your hands.<br />
Q, Sir Robert how do you feel about the future of the<br />
Commonwealth? There have been a lot of reports that the<br />
Commonwealth won't succeed.<br />
A. But this is what I've been saying. I think that the<br />
Commornwealth has come out of this conference stronger than<br />
a great number of people expected when the conference<br />
met and I think that the omens are good but as I said at<br />
the end of my remarks, the real test will come when we<br />
concentrate more of our attention on matters of current<br />
economic substance, for example, than we were able to do<br />
on this occasion.<br />
Q. Sir Robert Sir Alec Douglas Home has said that when the<br />
Commonwealth Prime Ministers expressed sympathy and support<br />
for Malaysia they were unanimous, but you hava been quoted<br />
as saying that we got a pretty fair degree of agreement on<br />
this subject, does this mean that you disagree with Sir<br />
Alec?<br />
A. Of course not. I don't see any inconsistency between. us.<br />
What is stated here is unanimous. What is stated in the<br />
communique is unanimous. I just went to the length of<br />
pointing out that there were arguments on the journey,,<br />
There was a little different emphasis on my part from what<br />
there might be on somebody else's, differences of method,<br />
but in the long run, yes, we got unanimity.<br />
Q, Sir Robert, do you consider that you have reason to be<br />
optimistic about the future peaceful relationships between<br />
the coloured and white races in the world?<br />
A, Yes, I saw no reason in this conferenco to become pessimistic<br />
about that. I think that you put your finger on this<br />
point and I think it i~ s worth emphasising that if we are<br />
to avoid conflict " avoid" is perhaps not the right word<br />
because it suggests that it is a liability I don't know.<br />
But if there is not to be conflict inside the Commonwealth<br />
for a start between the white races and the coloured races,<br />
we will all need to get to understand the other man's<br />
point of view a good deal better. That is one of the<br />
values of these conferences. We will also need not to<br />
assume that when we speak about certain matters in a certain<br />
way that they are understood in the same sense by the other<br />
man, There is a tremendous exercise in tolerance and<br />
understanding to be engaged in here and I think we saw a<br />
good example of it in this conference. Now I do' feel<br />
at all pessimistic about that problem.<br />
Q, Sir, you described the result of discussions on Malaysia<br />
as pretty good but would you say that you were completely<br />
satisfied yourself or that the Tunku was satisfied at<br />
the expression of sympathy and support and no additional<br />
material aid?<br />
A. Oh, I didn't anticipate that there would be material aid<br />
promised by everybody. What I was after was to get beyond<br />
the point of mere sympathy to a positive expression of<br />
support. That support, as was said at the time, might<br />
in the case of Australia and the United Kingdom and New<br />
Zealand, be military and financial. In the case of somebody<br />
else, it might take a financial form. In the case of<br />
most, it might take the form of being active in and around<br />
the United Nations in presenting the case for Malaysia.<br />
In other caces. it r4iht be don. e thln. ugh diplomatic action<br />
to try to persuiade Soeka':: no, for example, to pull his<br />
troops off. Each one is to employ his own method. </p>
<p>-9-<br />
Qo Has the fresh supply of Soviet arms, the Soviet arms<br />
agreement altered this picture at all, Sir, in your mind?<br />
A, No. That picture is as I have just stated and I wouldn't<br />
want to alter it.<br />
Q. Did any countries in addition to Britain, Australia and<br />
New Zealand indicate that they would assist Malaysia<br />
materially.....<br />
A. I would prefer not to answer that one.<br />
Qo As a European nation close to Asia, is Australia satisfied<br />
that Britain and the United States still suppor-our<br />
general Asian policy?<br />
A. Yes, I am, we are, and I am told that at the ANZUS meeting<br />
this was confirmed, I don't lknow, at first hand.<br />
Q. Did you seek from President Jchnson the declaration that<br />
I understand has cone from ANZUS of support for Malaysia?<br />
A. Look, when I was there, in discussions with both the<br />
President and Secretary of State, Dean Rusk, I was at<br />
pains,.... I wasn't anticipating the ANZUS meeting oecause<br />
my colle ague was going to that, but I did want to know<br />
first whether C, s; atment on the ANZUS pact in the<br />
Parliament, which was one made with great care oas accepted<br />
by them, and the answer was yes, it was accepted by them<br />
completely and so far as tne State Department was concerned,<br />
it had circulated it aml ong its people as a definitive<br />
statement of the position, There is no ambiguivt between<br />
us at all,<br />
Q. Does the Australian Government intend any representations,<br />
diplomatic or otherwise, to the Russians in protest againist<br />
their intervention in this Malaysian dispute?<br />
A. I don't know, I have only just got back home. I have not<br />
even had a chance to discuss that matter.<br />
Q. Sir, speaking of President Johnson, does his probable<br />
visit to this country depend on his re-election in November<br />
or upon some other issue?<br />
Ao Well, let me make a profound remark. He won't come before<br />
November, I think that's certain. If he does win the<br />
election, I think he'll come during his new term. If he<br />
doesn't win the election then he will not come as<br />
President of the United States. ( Laughter)<br />
Q. Sir Robert, in your discussions with President Johnson,<br />
was there any mention made at all of greater Australian<br />
participation in South Vietnam?<br />
A. No.<br />
Q. Were you hoping there would be some censure of Dr.<br />
Soekarno's actions in Borneo and against Malaysia<br />
generally? That there would be criticism as well as<br />
support for the Tunku? That they would criticise Dr.<br />
Soekarno?<br />
A. Well, I'm a bit of an optimist but I knew that that might<br />
be playing it a little hard and therefore what 1 wanted<br />
to get as far as I was concerned and speaking also for<br />
the Tunku was a positive statement of support for him and<br />
what he is doing. I think that involves a criticism 0 </p>
<p>10<br />
because you can't uphold the defence against aggression<br />
without condemning the aggression by implication. But<br />
there are people who are a little nervous about defining it.<br />
I am always satisfied with the substance.<br />
Q. Sir, as a result of these past arduous few weeks, can you<br />
see any prospect of any political settlement appertaining<br />
to Indonesia, Vietnam, Laos, end the Indo-China region in<br />
general?<br />
A. That's a question I don't think can be answered. I don't<br />
despair of it. I think it is intensely difficult, I think<br />
it is going to take a long time and it will be affected,<br />
of course, by a number of other circumstances, including<br />
some of the military factors in Vietnam. But I wouldn't<br />
want to make a pronuncJ. amento on that one,<br />
Q. In a military sense,~ would you describe it now as grave, Sir?<br />
A. Well, that's your word. I think it is serious. Yes,<br />
seri9us.<br />
Q. Did you form an assessment, Sir, of the degree of lamerican<br />
determination in Vietnam? How determined are they to<br />
maintain their position there?<br />
A. I think they are very determined to maintain it. Of course,<br />
all this is on the assumption that the President remains<br />
President. I don't uimow what will happen in the alternative.<br />
I'm still reading the papers.<br />
Q. Would you say that these declarations of lamerican and<br />
British Commonwealth support for Malaysia were the principal<br />
objectives of your trip overseas, Sir?<br />
A, Not necessarily the principal, but it was one matter that<br />
was very prominent in my mind and about which I spoke<br />
perhaps more than on any other single topic. If that's<br />
what you have in mind, I feel very strongly about it.<br />
Q. Are your talks with the Tunku, Sir, likely to result in a<br />
consideration of further material aid by this country for<br />
Malaysia?<br />
A. I didn't have any discussion with him about that, As a<br />
matter of fact, we were all due to have a talk in London<br />
on the afternoon of the Thursday, but we went on talking<br />
instead in the conference. We were supposed to finish our<br />
communique by one o'clock on Thursday and then I was to have<br />
some further talks on other matters, but we sat until nine<br />
o'clock at night, after which none of us was fit to talk<br />
to anybody about anything.<br />
Q. You were reported, Sir, to have forecast a pretty sharp<br />
increase, I think of the order of fifty per cent., in<br />
Australian defence spending. Does this imply any new<br />
defence projects or is this the cost of<br />
A, Oh this was the ultimate mount-up of the current programme.<br />
Buof course, past experience has shown that defence<br />
programmes are by no means static and these last changes<br />
we made were quite massive and I daresay there will be<br />
others in future. a / 11 </p>
<p>11<br />
Q. Sir, will there be further consultations with the Tunku on<br />
material aid for Malaysia, following his visits to Washington<br />
and Canada?<br />
A. You mean on the Prime Minister<br />
Q. I mean more on the Government level.<br />
A. Well, I can't tell you that. The officials are in constant<br />
touch with each other. It usually comes up from the official<br />
level.<br />
Q. Would you be happy ' o see more moves towards another summit<br />
meeting, Sir?<br />
A. A summit meeting about Malaysia?<br />
Q. Yes sir.<br />
A. Well, you know, a summit meeting which takes place between the<br />
President of Indonesia who doesn't admit that Malaysip exists<br />
'. out who, strangely enough, then offers to crush it, and at the<br />
same time maintains active trooos on Malaysian territory, seems<br />
to me to be a funry kind of summit meeting. If a summit<br />
meeting could be preceded by a statement that his military<br />
aggression would cease in fact and that his forces wo-uld be<br />
withdrawn and that Malaysia would be recognised by him as it<br />
is by every other country in the world could be a very useful<br />
one. Not that the Tanku has anything lo withdraw. I don't<br />
know what he would take to a summit meeting, but if it led<br />
to a better mutual understanding, some element of friendship<br />
with each other and with the Philippines, well, yes, a summit<br />
meeting would be good. I very largely share the Tunku's views.<br />
To be asked to go to a summit meeting when your territory is<br />
under active military attack by the other parties, who persist<br />
in it and who continue in it while the meeting is on. this is<br />
a contradic. ion in terms. This is no kind of conference.<br />
This would be only a kind of appeasement.<br />
Q. Is it your impressicn, Sir, that Philippines support for<br />
Indonesia has drifted away somewhat from its former position?<br />
A. Well, I haven't been in the Philippines, except the other night<br />
on the airport, so I wouldn't know.<br />
Q, Sir Robert, did you feel that there was a fee ing of sympathy<br />
by the African leaders on the Malaysian question or were they<br />
too preoccupied with their own problems?<br />
A. Oh, no, they sympathised with it. They know that independence,<br />
the preservation of your owm integrity is just as much essential<br />
in Asia as it is in Africa. I'm sure they know that because<br />
I took the opportunity of saying it a few times. But I think<br />
that's quite right. They vary of course.<br />
Q. Sir Robert, getting away from the Commonwealth Prime Ministers'<br />
discussions and Malaysia for a moment, did you take an<br />
opportunity in London to discuss the possibility of another<br />
Royal Visit next year?<br />
A. No. You mean a visit by The Queen?<br />
Q. By The Queen.<br />
A. No. </p>
<p>,12<br />
Q. Sir Robert, did the Common Market raise its collective head<br />
at the conference at all?<br />
A. No. Ted Heath attended the conference but I think lie got<br />
out unscathed without any discussion on the Common Market.<br />
Q. Would you say that Britain's entry into the Common Market<br />
is dead?<br />
A. No, out I think it sleeps.<br />
Q. Sir, did you raise the question of a visit by some important<br />
personage for Anzac Jubilee next year?<br />
Yes, I have had that under discussion but there is nothing I<br />
can say about it yet, but we will have one.<br />
Q. Did any of your Commonwealth colleagues, Sir, make any<br />
overt or covert cracks about Australia's immigration laws or<br />
policy?<br />
A. No.<br />
Q. Have you, Sir, examined the position of a successor to<br />
Lord De L'Isle?<br />
A. Oh no, that's a long way off. No discussion of any kind,<br />
directly or indirectly. That matter doesn't arise yet.<br />
There is only one fellow who is out cf the picture and that<br />
is myself.<br />
Q. How do you feel about the Republicans' choice of a<br />
Presidential candidate?<br />
A. I have no comment to make. That's their business.<br />
Q. Sir Robert, has there been any request from the South<br />
Vietramese Government for bodies of troops rather than<br />
military advisers?<br />
A, Not that I know of, but you must remember that I've been<br />
away for a month. I know of none.<br />
Q. Some of Dr. Nyrere's Ministers are rather pro-Dr. Soekarno,<br />
aren't they? Did he have anything to say about this?<br />
A. Well, look, I don't want to be quoting what Nyrere had to<br />
say on this. You have to remember that Tanganyika has now<br />
entered into holy matrimony with Zanzibar and that Zanzibar<br />
is very largely controlled by people who, if not communist,<br />
are very much in that direction and therefore Nyrere is in<br />
a position of some complica. tion, shall I sny, in this<br />
matter. I found nothing unsatisfactory about his views<br />
and when you ask me about his other Ministers, I don't know.<br />
I didn't meet them.<br />
