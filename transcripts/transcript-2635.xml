MACQUARIENETWORK WEEKLY BROADCAST<br />
BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE RT. HON. WILLIAM McMAHON<br />
CH, MP 28 JUNE 1972<br />
COM1MONWEALTH/ STATE RELATIONS<br />
Good Evening You will remember that last week we had a meeting<br />
in Canberra between the State Premiers and the Commonweath. This<br />
was a very important meeting because it was the first step in setting<br />
the course for the Commonwealth and the State Budgets for the new<br />
financial year which begins on Saturday.<br />
It was my fourth meeting with the Premiers as Prime<br />
Minister. Once again, as in other meetings, the discussions were<br />
really good. Three Libezral/ Country Party and three Labor Premiers<br />
sat around the table with the Commonwealth. And we got down to<br />
business in a spirit of' goodwill and co-operation.<br />
Frankly, I don't think it could be much better.<br />
Certainly it's a lot better than it has ever been before.<br />
As you know,: the Commonwealth collects most of the<br />
taxes you pay, . and a sizeable part is paid to the States to allow<br />
them to finance their various activities.<br />
The balance is used by the Commonwealth itselZ for<br />
national needs like Defece and Social Services and to meet the<br />
cost of running the nationAl Government.<br />
One of the Commonwealth's objectives was to do<br />
hat we could to make sure the States did not have to substantially<br />
ncrease taxation. And I t4ink we gave a great deal of help.<br />
his is what Sir Robert Aski-of New South Wales said:-<br />
" I hope to avoid any increase in taxation altogether." / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
And this is what the VictoriaiPrenier, Sir Henry Bolte, said:<br />
" I think the most important thing is that there will not<br />
be any increase in State taxation."<br />
The Premiers' Conference and the Loan Council decide<br />
the level of financial assistance g~ rants to the States and the<br />
borrowing programmes for works and housing.<br />
Incidentally, the Commonwealth has for many years<br />
underwritten the State Government works and housing programmes to<br />
thae extent that borrowings approved cannot be raised on the market.<br />
Now you hear a lot of talk about haggling and about<br />
the States coming " cap-in-hand" to the Commonwealt-h. -This hasn't<br />
been the case in my Administration.<br />
We have given new taxing powers to the States by<br />
handing over the pay-roll tax t-o them, and the Premiers'now, tell<br />
us their problems and give us an assessment of their needs before<br />
we meet. So we are all pretty well informed when we sit down<br />
together. Now let me sum up briefly the main results of the<br />
Conference. First the Comimonwealth will provide the States in<br />
1972/ 73 with $ 128 million more in revenue grants than they received<br />
before. This will take the t~ otal amount the States will get from<br />
us in the new financial year to over sixteen hundred million dollars.<br />
In addition, the Commonwea'lth will provide as grants<br />
nearly $ 250 million of the States' programme for works and housing<br />
which we agreed will be $ 982 million and we guarantee that they<br />
will receive the remaining part of the prograimme if it cannot be<br />
borrowed. These are pretty big sums. In total the State<br />
Governments and their authorities will have available from<br />
Commonwealth sources and from borrowing approved by the Loan<br />
Council something over $ 3,000 million in the next year. That.,<br />
I believe, spells progress.<br />
I mention two other matters.<br />
We are still keeping a very watchful eye on<br />
unemployment. As you know, we have already acted promptly to get<br />
the numbers down. At the Premiers' Conference we decided to do<br />
more. The Commonwealth agreed to increase the money to be<br />
spent up to the end of 1972 from four and a half million dollars a<br />
month to six mil~ lion dollars a month for the relief of nonmetropolitan<br />
unemployment. The States will, of course, decide<br />
for themselves in what non-metropolitan areas and in what way<br />
they will spend this money. </p>
<p>S-3-<br />
They, like us, are pledged to a policy of full<br />
employment.. S. We also talked about urban problems..<br />
The Commonwealth shares the concern of the States<br />
Sat the plight of some of our cities andtheir services. How can we<br />
ease the traffic snarls-and the congestion in our cities.. and the<br />
sprawl., that is taking place in our suburbs?<br />
Under the Australian Constitution, of. course, these<br />
are basically problems for-State Governments, as only they have<br />
the power to act within their own borders. But the Commonwealth<br />
takes . a deep interest in all this, because, after-all,--we are<br />
one people, living in one continent.<br />
The increased funds I have been talking about give<br />
the States the opportunity to tackle the problems directly in the<br />
way they know best. We have been-doing-mre -tban--iny peopl. e eali. I<br />
for housing--and for-roads, for example.<br />
So I repeat, the overall result of the Premiers'<br />
Conference was good. It will do much to help our growth and<br />
development, and promote more of the things you need to improve<br />
the quality of our national life.<br />
Goodnight. </p>
