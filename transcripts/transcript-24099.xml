    <content><![CDATA[<p>In our family, Christmas is a time for the generations to gather, to give gifts, share stories and give thanks for everything we have.</p>
<p>Mostly Christmas is a joyous time â but it can be a sad time too and this year we are thinking of those families who have lost loved ones.</p>
<p>The last fortnight has been a heartbreaking time for our country. The thoughts and prayers of everyone are with those who are grieving this Christmas.</p>
<p>This is a time to reach out â to those who have had a difficult year, as well as those who, for whatever reason, are doing it tough and we thank the charities and their supporters who are reaching out this Christmas and living out the true ideals of the season.</p>
<p>We pay tribute to our Defence Force personnel, especially those serving far from home this Christmas. They put themselves in harm's way to protect others and we thank them for their service.</p>
<p>We are also thinking of farmers in drought whose futures and homes depend on good rains.</p>
<p>The community Christmas lunches, the wishing trees and the hampers remind us that true joy at Christmas comes from giving. Christmas brings us all together â and is unchanging.</p>
<p>Christmas is a time to relax and recharge; to reflect and resolve; to count our blessings and to make the most of our opportunities.</p>
<p>So from our family to yours: Merry Christmas.</p>
<p>25 December 2014</p>
