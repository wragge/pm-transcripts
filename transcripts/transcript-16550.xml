    <content><![CDATA[<p>BlueScope Steel, an Australian company, has been confirmed as a major supplier to Australia's Air Warfare Destroyer (AWD) Program, winning a contract to supply steel for the first of the advanced vessels. </p>
<p>As announced in the Defence White Paper last week, the $8 billion Air Warfare Destroyer (AWD) Program will deliver three Australian-built Hobart Class air warfare destroyers  -  the most advanced ships to be operated by the Royal Australian Navy. They will form a key part of Force 2030, which will strengthen Australia's defence for the next generation.</p>
<p>The contract to supply the steel will be worth up to $20 million over six years and will see BlueScope Steel produce around 3,000 tonnes of steel per ship.</p>
<p>The steel will be provided in âship sets' with the initial production run being for the first AWD, HMAS Hobart. The ships will be commissioned between 2014 and 2017.</p>
<p>BlueScope Steel has outclassed an international field to win this contract, demonstrating their ability to beat global competition. Through this new contract, they will support jobs for Australian workers and flow-on economic benefits for their communities.</p>
<p>Australian jobs for Australian steel for Australian defence.</p>
<p>This is good news for BlueScope Steel, good news for Defence, and good news for the people of the Illawarra. </p>
