VISIT BY VICE-PRESIDENT HU1MPHREY<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr. Harold Holt<br />
Advice has been received that the Vice-President<br />
of the United OStates, 11r. Hibert Humphrey, and other senior<br />
American officials, will arrive in Canberra late on Friday<br />
afternoon. It will be the most high-ranking U. S. delegation<br />
ever to visit Australia. In addition to the Vice-President,<br />
the party will include the U. 3 Ambassador-at-large,<br />
Governor iverell Harriman, a Special Presidential Assistant,<br />
Mr. Jack Valenti and eight other officials. Mrs. Humphrey<br />
will also be accompanying the Vice-President on his Australian<br />
visit. Mr. Humphrey and his party will be flying from<br />
Delhi via Darwin, and will remain in Canberra until Sup-day<br />
morning. The Vice-President will have talks with the Foreign<br />
Affairs and Defence ( ommittee of Cabinet on Saturday morning.<br />
This will be followed by a Government Luncheon, and a press<br />
conference will be held in the afternoon.<br />
There will be a dinner in his honour at Government<br />
House on Saturday evening. The Vice-President is expected<br />
to leave Canberra at 10 a. m. on Sunday.<br />
As I said earlier, Mr. Humphrey will be most<br />
welcome and I am sure that these direct discussions will be<br />
of considerable mutual value.<br />
