OVERSEAS VISIT BY SPECIAL MINISTER OF STATE<br />
The Special Minister of State, Senator Willesee, will<br />
leave Australia early next month to visit a number of African<br />
Scountries. Announcing this today, the Prime Minister and Minister<br />
for Foreign Affairs, Mr Whitlam, said that Senator Willesee would<br />
be travelling as his nersonal emissary and would be making the<br />
first contact by a Minister of the new Australian Government with<br />
political leaders in those countries.<br />
Senator Willesee will arrive in Ghana on 13 June and then<br />
visit Nigeria, Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, Zambia and Mauritius. He<br />
will travel to Africa via Brussels, where be will preside at a<br />
meeting of Australian Ambassadors to member countries of the EEC.<br />
He will also pay brief private visits to Rome, London and Dublin.<br />
Mr V hitlm said he hoped that Senator Willesee's visit<br />
would help consolidate the improvement in Australia's standing<br />
with African countries resulting from the Government's new policies<br />
against racism and colonialism.<br />
This is the first time in ten years that an Australian<br />
Minister has undertaken a tour of East and West Africa.<br />
Mr Whitlam said: " The Australian Government believes<br />
that Australian Ministers have in the past paid insufficient<br />
attention to the more than 200 million black Africans on the<br />
continent of Africa. / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
" The 35 black African countries comprise more than one<br />
quarter of the membership of the United Nations and twelve of them<br />
are members of the Commonwealth. They will continue to constitute<br />
an important and at times vocal influence in world affairs."<br />
The Prime Minister said that the Government believed it<br />
was time to show a more positive interest in African affairs. By<br />
its voting on various resolutions in the UN, the Government had<br />
already shown its sympathy with and understanding for the aspirations<br />
of all black Africans for racial equality, majority rule and<br />
indenendence. By its program of self-government and independence for S<br />
Papua New Guinea, its determination to improve the welfare of its<br />
own Aborigines, and its signature and forthcoming ratification of<br />
various UN conventions on human rights and the elimination of<br />
racial discrimination, Australia was showing her adherence to these<br />
orinciples. Equally Australia gave her ready support to countries<br />
sharing these views.<br />
Mr Whitlam said that during his visit Senator Willesee<br />
would also seek views on questions likely to arise at the<br />
Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting in Ottawa in August.<br />
Senator Willesee will be accomnanied by Mrs Willesee, as 0<br />
well as by Dr J. W. C. Cumes, of the Department of Foreign Affairs,<br />
and his Private Secretary, Mr G. Briot. </p>
