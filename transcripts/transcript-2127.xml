    <content><![CDATA[<p><br /><strong>Interviewer: </strong>Mr. Patrick Tennison</p>
<p>13 OctoberÂ 1969</p>
<p><strong>Question:Â </strong>. Prime Minister, a first impression from your policyÂ speech was that you were offering us two kinds of soups one lot wasÂ clear, the other had a lot of good ingredients though was less clear.Â For instance, you gave a figure of $ 3 million to set up the InstituteÂ of Marine Science at Townsville but you didn't say what would be spentÂ to set up the atomic energy plant at Jervis Bay. Is there a figure?</p>
<p><strong>PM.</strong> Yes, I think the figure is estimated at $ 120-$ 130 millionÂ for the atomic plant, but it can only be an estimate at this stage, andÂ of course it would be spread over quite a number of years sevenÂ years.</p>
<p><strong>Q. </strong>Why Jervis Bay for this? I am thinking this is so closeÂ to the Snowy Hydro-Electric Scheme which is a major power sourceÂ now.</p>
<p><strong>PM. </strong>Well, for a variety of reasons. This is a pilot plant,Â as it were the first plant that is coming into Australia and we wantedÂ it to be on Commonwealth Territory so there was no question ofÂ ConstitutionalÂ problems about its control, or its safety, or anythingÂ of that kind. We wanted to have it on territory which belonged to us.Â The site was recommended by the experts as being a very good oneÂ because of its proximity to water which apparently is required in largeÂ quantities, and because it was close to a large electrical consumingÂ public which would enable the electricity it generated to be fed intoÂ that grid, and at the same time, of course, take care of the expansionÂ of Canberra as it grows.</p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> Coming closer to the voters' hip-pocket nerve, whichÂ as one of your predecessors said was the most sensitive, there areÂ some unclear points about your taxation reform proposals. Now, atÂ what point does a middle income-earner stop being a middle-incomeÂ earner?Â </p>
<p><strong>PM.</strong> Well, we haven't given any benchmarks on this. IfÂ you read the policy speech you will see that we said that we are studyingÂ it and it requires more study, but as a very rough guide at this stageÂ and only as a very rough guide at this stage, I would say it would startÂ at the $2,000-$3, 000 a year mark, probably something over $2000Â or $2000, very roughly, and would cut out at the middle income range,Â at say $15,000-$ 16, 000 a year. That would be a very rough andÂ ready guide.</p>
<p><strong>Q. </strong>Now, these people are going to be saved $ 200 millionÂ a year eventually. Where is this money eventually going to come from?</p>
<p><strong>PM.</strong> How do you mean. ,. thr will be a lack of collectionÂ of that amount of money, we hope. That is our aim and our objectiveÂ in three years' time. Now it can come from a variety of sources. ItÂ could come from not spending all the amounts that have at leastÂ promised to be spent by our opponents leaving it in the hands of theÂ people themselves to decide whether they should insure themselves orÂ whether they should be compulsorily insured. Or it could come as aÂ result of expansion in revenue in other areas. There are a numberÂ of ways it could come.</p>
<p><strong>Q. </strong>But will the people on the higher brackets of incomeÂ be more heavily taxed to make up at least some of this anyway?</p>
<p><strong>PM.</strong> Well, we haven't suggested that that would happen, andÂ indeed, the people on the higher levels of income tax are comparativelyÂ few and there would be comparatively little return from increasingÂ the revenue there. You couldn't by increasing taxation on higherÂ levels of income make up for what revenue you would lose on theÂ lower to middle levels of income.</p>
<p><strong>Q. </strong>You also gave the figure of $ 16 million as theÂ Government's estimate of its cost to bring medical benefit refundsÂ closer to actual medical costs. Now this is less than 50 a yearÂ for every person in the community. It will take more than that IÂ would imagine. Will people have to pay higher premiums?</p>
<p><strong>PM. </strong>Yes, the Funds.... . this is the cost to the Commonwealth,$ 16 million. The Funds will have to pay more, and in order to bringÂ the scheme fully into operation, we believe that people will probablyÂ have to pay something like 5 cents a week more in their contributions.Â For that, they will get complete protection, except for the againstÂ the really costly illnesses which must be the most worrying thingsÂ they have to face.</p>
<p><strong>Q. </strong>Well, we are really getting closer to a national healthÂ scheme, such as Labor has proposed, except this is a contributoryÂ one?Â </p>
<p><strong>PM. </strong>Well, we have had a contributory health scheme forÂ quite a long time. What we are doing is making the contributoryÂ health scheme work far better. We are leaving it as a voluntaryÂ scheme. We are allowing people to continue to have the right of Â choice as to where they wish to insure themselves, as to where theyÂ think they will get the best service, rather than make them go to justÂ one Government Department. We are taking care of the very heavyÂ costs which surgery could cause to people. After all, what a healthÂ scheme should do is take care primarily of the worries of peopleÂ about heavy medical expenses, and medium-sized expenses but itÂ isn't necessary for it to buy every bottle of aspirins or something ofÂ that kind.</p>
<p><strong>Q. </strong>Would you agree that this seems to epitomise the wholeÂ policy? There is no sign of any overall tax relief. I don't thinkÂ Government is going to get any cheaper, apparently, but this moneyÂ will go out to the areas where you feel it is most needed, or mostÂ deserving?</p>
<p><strong>PM.</strong> Yes, all our revenue, of course, has got to be splitÂ up, and divided between the requirements of the State GovernmentsÂ which we have got to pay a lot of attention to. Our opponents, ofÂ course, are paying no attention to them at all, apparently. But weÂ have got to take into account requirements of that, requirements ofÂ the demands of defence, of national development projects, of socialÂ welfare, of a whole variety of fields. And in the social welfare fieldÂ itself, it is necessary to pick where the money and resources availableÂ will bring the best results for the people of Australia.</p>
<p><strong>Q. </strong>On defence which you just mentioned, the GovernmentÂ has pledged in your speech to progressively increase defence spending.Â This is just two months after a Budget which cut defence expenditureÂ by 5 per cent. Isn't this rather a switch in attitude towards defence?</p>
<p><strong>PM.</strong> Not at all. The very first Governor -General's SpeechÂ that was made from The Throne when I became Prime Minister saidÂ that we would, year by year, expect to increase the amount of moneyÂ that was to be spent on defence, though not necessarily the amount ofÂ GNP. And this therefore is no switch whatsoever from the policy whichÂ we then enunciated and which we still believe to be the right one. InÂ this particular year, the proposals put before us by the DefenceÂ Department were only enough to require the amount of money whichÂ we provided for them. But they are working in a new cost-benefitÂ analysis, if I can put it that way, of a lot of the propositions thatÂ come up, and I have no doubt at all that these will be coming in toÂ us in the next year.</p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> You stressed the importance of the American allianceÂ and the ANZUS Treaty in your policy speech, but unlike the LaborÂ policy, you still won't agree to signing the Nuclear Non-ProliferationÂ Treaty, though I notice you leave the pen within reach, as it were.</p>
<p><strong>PM. </strong>Well, we won't agree to signing it until we are sureÂ that it is an effective Treaty, that it really is going to do what it setsÂ out to do and that its signature which in our case we would expect to beÂ followed by ratification we wouldn't want to sign it unless we ratifiedÂ it that its signature would not endanger Australia's future security.Â We do need to be satisfied on those that we have full protection.Â And we are not satisfied on those.</p>
<p><strong>Q. </strong>Paradoxically in this age of prosperity, poverty is anÂ important issue in this election. Now, basically, where does yourÂ policy disagree with the Labor Party' s in tackling areas of poverty?</p>
<p><strong>PM. </strong>Well, there are only a certain amount of resourcesÂ which you can t'ake from people in order to help the less well off, inÂ order to help the needy and the sick. You must leave the wage-earnerÂ and the salaried man with his own family with his own incentives to liveÂ a better life and be able to afford more, so there is only a certainÂ amount that you can take. One great difference is that we do not believeÂ it right and proper to spend say, $ 370 million on abolishing theÂ old-age means test alone. This is a proposition that Labor puts forward.Â It would cost $370 million to abolish the old-age means test withoutÂ one cent going to help the less well-off. Now we believe that resourcesÂ should first be devoted to such areas as handicapped children, to theÂ handicapped and invalids, to improving the base pension as and whenÂ we can do it and make sure that what we do is of real benefit and notÂ an illusory benefit; to co-operating with voluntary institutions, andÂ above all to helping the needs of the children of needy families. WeÂ would sooner devote our resources there than to abolishing the meansÂ test for old age and pay pensions to the rich.</p>
<p>Thank you, Prime Minister.</p>
