COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA.<br />
SPEECH BY<br />
The Rt. Hon. R. G. MENZIES, M. P.,<br />
MINISTERS OF STATE BILL<br />

[ From the Parliamentary Debates," 14th April, 1959.1<br />
Mr. MENZIES ( Kooyong-Prime Minister)<br />

That the bill be now read a second time.<br />

not to confine my remarks to the one<br />
bill, but to discuss the whole of the matters<br />
covered by the three bills which have been<br />
referred to. And that, I am sure, is desirable,<br />
because they all arise from the one<br />
investigation, the one report, and the one<br />
series of determinations by the Government.<br />
It is not, Sir, for the first time that the<br />
Parliament has had to consider its own<br />
emoluments, its salaries, its allowances and<br />
3006/ 59. its superannuation benefits, because, of<br />
course, under the Constitution of this country<br />
as it still stands, the salaries of members<br />
of the Parliament-then called allowances<br />
-were fixed at an amount of Å 400 per<br />
annum. But they were fixed until Parliament<br />
otherwise determined, and, as everybody<br />
here knows, that means that Parliament<br />
can from time to time, as it thinks<br />
appropriate, determine these matters. On<br />
this occasion, as on two prior occasions, it<br />
was decided that a committee quite outside<br />
of Parliament-but a knowledgeable committee-<br />
should investigate these matters<br />
and make recommendations to the Parliament<br />
through the Government. This is the<br />
third occasion on which that has happened<br />
and, as on every prior occasion on which </p>
<p>there has been a change of salary or allowances-<br />
going back for over half a century<br />
-there has been a remarkable uproar,<br />
largely fermented, as I will indicate later,<br />
by sections of the press, and, to a large<br />
extent, based upon an unwillingness or an<br />
inability to understand what the duties of<br />
members of Parliament are and what the<br />
duties of Ministers are. This, after all, tonight,<br />
is an opportunity, which I would not<br />
willingly have missed, to enable at least<br />
some hundreds of thousands of people in<br />
Australia to learn that there are two sides to<br />
this question, and I regard my responsibility<br />
this evening as a responsibility to see that<br />
. the Parliament's side of this matter becomes<br />
known to thoughtful people who, in our<br />
experience, will always come down with a<br />
sensible judgment if they have the materials<br />
before them.<br />
In order to begin this exercise, Sir, I<br />
think I should point out something that<br />
most honorable members are familiar with<br />
-that this, of course, is not the first occasion<br />
on which this kind of thing has<br />
happened. When this Parliament began,<br />
58 years ago, the payment to members of<br />
the Parliament was Å 400 a year. That was<br />
in 1901. In 1907, it was increased to Å 600)<br />
a year, and there was an enormous press<br />
agitation. I think it was at that very time<br />
that some talented writer coined the great<br />
phrase about a salary grab, to which, * of<br />
course, people of even greater -genius have<br />
since added such expressions of raiding<br />
the Treasury The payment to members<br />
was increased to Å-600 a year in 1907, and<br />
that increase was violently opposed by,<br />
amion g other people, the very newspapers<br />
that have fermented and led the agitation<br />
against the increases now proposed. The<br />
payment fixed in 1907 stood until 1920-<br />
after the first world war. There had been<br />
a great world war, with all its economic<br />
consequences. There had been all the<br />
inevitable inflationary pressures of a great<br />
war. Yet, in 1920, when a proposal was<br />
brought forward by the then government to<br />
raise the amount to Å 1,000, the agitation<br />
surpassed even that of 1907. That agitalion<br />
came from the same people, the same<br />
very wealthy interests. and was directed to<br />
the same object.<br />
In 1932 -the depression was on, and this<br />
Parliament reduced the Å 1,000 in accordance<br />
with the Premiers' plan. I think it must go on record that that was the first<br />
and only time when these great newspaper<br />
interests approved of what Parliament was<br />
doing. Between 1932 and 1938, as the<br />
depression lifted, certain gradual restorations<br />
were made by Parliament until, by<br />
1938, the sum of Å 1,000 had been completely<br />
restored. That was greated with a<br />
volley of abuse, of course.<br />
In 1947 the amount was, by legislation,<br />
raised to Å E1,500. We had a very spirited<br />
argument in this House on that occasion,<br />
which I have taken the opportunity to reread<br />
in order to refresh my mind on it.<br />
Once more there was a violent press campaign,<br />
directed not to one point that exercized<br />
my mind and those of some other<br />
people in this House at that time-that<br />
wage pegging was still in existence-bu,<br />
directed to the eternal proposition that you<br />
must never increase the salaries of members<br />
of the Federal Parliament becauselet<br />
us face it-we are not worth it.)<br />
In 1952, following a report, further im<br />
provements were made. There were<br />
improvements again in 1956, and now we<br />
have the current proposals. There may be<br />
some honorable members in this House-<br />
I am sure there are-who have never previously<br />
encountered these somewhat wintry<br />
blasts, but I can assure them that they are<br />
no colder to-day than they were in the<br />
past, that they go * on and on, and if anybody<br />
took the trouble to investigate the<br />
nature and source of the press campaign<br />
since 1907, he would be irresistibly driven<br />
to t ' he conclusion that if these gentlemnen<br />
had had their way, members of the Federal<br />
Parliament would still be paid Å 400 a year,<br />
because no improvement of their salaries<br />
has even been lucky enough to secure the<br />
benediction of the press.<br />
I refer to that matter of history becaust)<br />
it is very important that we should under'<br />
stand the existence of this classical contes,<br />
that has gone on between the members of<br />
Parliament who, if I may say so on behalf<br />
of all honorable members, have been<br />
elected by the people to sit in Parliament<br />
and to administer the government of the<br />
country, and those who, elected by nobody<br />
but themselves, undertake to assume control<br />
of the affairs of the country. It is a<br />
classical contest.<br />
On this occasion I have followed the<br />
press campaign with great interest. I can </p>
<p>assure, all honorable members that I have<br />
not lost much sleep over it, but I have<br />
followed it with a certain academic interest.<br />
I have become accustomed. now-well, I did<br />
many years ago-to all those rather con-<br />
. temptuous expressions that are used by<br />
some newspaper critics. But on this occasion<br />
an unbridled attack-I should refer to<br />
it at once-has been led in Sydney by the<br />
Sydney Morning Herald" and its somewhat<br />
curious satellites-I think that is a<br />
courteous term-and in Melbourne by the<br />
" Herald". I want to make an attempt to<br />
assist public thought to achieve a balanced<br />
judgment in this matter. I know that from<br />
the point of view of the press that will be a<br />
futile attempt, but I hope that I will be<br />
u nderstood by a good number of people in<br />
this country.<br />
In the main, what people have learnt<br />
about this matter has been derived from<br />
newspapers such as the ones that I have<br />
mentioned, and I want to say something<br />
about the campaign of each of those two<br />
newspapers in plain terms and, I hope, with<br />
that restraint which characterizes me. I<br />
have a clear duty to my fellow members in<br />
this Parliament, and I am not unwilling to<br />
discharge it. I have a clear duty to the<br />
whole institution of Parliament to put this<br />
matter in its right perspective. Sir, I have<br />
referred to the classical contest between the<br />
press and Parliament. Who interprets public<br />
opinion? Who influences public opinion?<br />
Who gives effect to public opinion? Is it<br />
Parliament, freely elected, known man by<br />
C man and woman by woman, and representative<br />
of the people? Or is it the press, selfelected,<br />
anonymous, and in some cases<br />
representative only of the wealth and whims<br />
of a few? In that contest Parliament must<br />
win if parliamentary government is to be<br />
preserved. Those are preliminary remarks, and I<br />
hope that they will be regarded as by no<br />
means irrational. I believe that they go to<br />
the root of this matter. So now I shall<br />
look at this campaign, which has influenced<br />
so many people and, for all I know, has<br />
influenced so many honorable members<br />
The line adopted by the Melbourne<br />
" Herald" has been almost impossible to<br />
follow, although on the whole it has done<br />
its utmost to whip up feeling against private<br />
members of the Federal Parliament. It has<br />
been almost friendly at times to the improvements<br />
now advised by the Martin committee<br />
3006/ 59.-2 in Victoria but, of course, they were made<br />
in reference to the Parliament of one State,<br />
and therefore they have much more appeal<br />
to the Melbourne " Herald" than recommendatiohs<br />
made with respect to the much<br />
more important Parliament of the nation.<br />
It was, I think, on 18th January that I<br />
announced the appointment of. a committee<br />
to inquire into parliamentary salaries and<br />
allowances. On 19th January, following the<br />
announcement of the appointment of that<br />
committee-an independent committee<br />
appointed to examine parliamentary salaries<br />
and allowances, -a committee against which,<br />
and against any member of which, no<br />
word has been spoken or could be spoken<br />
to impugn their independence or their<br />
probity-the Melbourne " Herald" published<br />
a leading article. I am sure that<br />
honorable members would be grateful if I<br />
recalled the terms of that article to their<br />
minds. The Melbourne Herald stated-<br />
In announcing the appointment of an independent<br />
committee to report on Parliamentary salaries<br />
and allowances, Mr. Menzies is choosing the fairest<br />
way of answering those members of the two Federal<br />
Houses who have been suggesting that another<br />
increase in their pay is merited. The principle<br />
of periodic and independent reviews is sound.<br />
If rates are to be reviewed early in the threeyear<br />
life of each Parliament, as Mr. Menzies suggests,<br />
it should follow that the findings of the<br />
committee are followed throughout this term, and<br />
are applied in their entirety.<br />
Mr. Clyde Cameron.-Who said that?<br />
Mr. MENZIES. The Melbourne<br />
" Herald" on 19th January, 1959. Then<br />
it concluded by saying-<br />
It is right that parliamentary service should be<br />
adequately rewarded, and that its expenses should<br />
be periodically reviewed. But restraint in demands<br />
for privileges, and a lead in accepting the umpire's<br />
decision, are expected from the nation's elected<br />
spokesmen. These, Sir, were the words-on the whole,<br />
rather pious words. But who gave the lead<br />
in rejecting the umpire's decision? The<br />
same newspaper! When the report of the<br />
umpire was made, this very newspaper became<br />
highly critical and indeed almost<br />
vitriolic. So far from recommending that<br />
the umpire's decision should be taken, this<br />
very newspaper argued that there should<br />
not only be frank debate, which everybody<br />
welcomed, but far-reaching amendment.<br />
Oddly enough, the newspaper still said on<br />
30th March of this year-<br />
Sir Frank Richardson and his colleagues<br />
examined the whole question of parliamentary </p>
<p>rewards very closely. The higher rates they reconimend<br />
for the Prime Minister, senior Ministers.<br />
and the Leader of the Opposition might well be<br />
justified.. There is good reason to question some<br />
of the other increases.<br />
When I read that, it was one of the few<br />
occasions in my life when I felt that I<br />
almost had a pat on the back-it was high<br />
time my emoluments were increased. I<br />
began to feel almost like the managing<br />
editor of a newspaper.<br />
The statement would convey to any<br />
reader the impression that those who control<br />
the Melbourne " Herald" had a<br />
quarrel in particular with the salaries of<br />
private members and that there was no<br />
quarrel really with what was proposed for<br />
people like myself. But in the great campaign<br />
to lower the prestige of Parliament,<br />
and correspondingly to increase the<br />
authority of the press, this newspaper<br />
succeeeded in contradicting its own attack.<br />
It has a representative at Canberra, who<br />
wrote and published, not only in the Melbourne<br />
Herald" but in the " Courier-<br />
Mail" in Queensland, an article about the<br />
recommendations concerning myself,<br />
which up to that time I had thought were<br />
being rather pleasantly received. For complete<br />
dishonesty, this article will take a lot<br />
of beating. I want to say this quite plainly:<br />
It is high time" that it-was understood by<br />
some of these people that those who live<br />
by the sword are liable to perish by. the<br />
sword.. . I<br />
This : man. made two points in particular.<br />
The first was. that, under the recommendations,<br />
the Prime Minister is to be given a<br />
total . salary, of Å 10,000, but that as he will<br />
get an additional Å 4,000 odd in special<br />
allowances,: he will be receiving more than<br />
the Prime Minister of Great Britain. This<br />
was put in headlines. As the writer well<br />
knew,: that story was completely untrue.<br />
The Prime Minister of Great Britain does,<br />
I believe, get a net salary of Å 10,000 sterling,<br />
which I would have thought was a very<br />
modest salary for a man carrying his responsibilities<br />
in the world. But does the<br />
" Herald" suppose that he maintains No.<br />
Downing-street and Chequers and discharges<br />
all his representational duties out<br />
of that salary? Of course not! Every<br />
child knows that other financial arrangements<br />
are made about these places and that<br />
substantial entertainment expenses are met<br />
on behalf of the Prime Minister of Great Britain. However, it was thought fit, in<br />
order to stir up public opinion, to pretend,<br />
quite dishonestly, that by comparing my<br />
salary-or my projected salary, because I<br />
have not got it yet-and allowances with<br />
somebody else's salary, omitting his allowances,<br />
passion would be aroused.<br />
A second aspect was developed by the<br />
same gentleman. It was a second fantastic<br />
untruth. He offered to drop a crocodile<br />
tear over the Governor-General. Sir,<br />
I am sorry to have to refer to this and I<br />
do so with the greatest goodwill to the<br />
distinguished Governor-General of Australia.<br />
This man dropped a crocodile tear.<br />
He said, Isn't this terrible; the Prime<br />
Minister of Australia is -to be given<br />
Å 10,000; that is all the Governor-General<br />
gets, and that is what he was getting in<br />
1901 He even achieved the great skill<br />
of referring to it as a unique industrial<br />
anomaly. I do not need to tell my distinguished<br />
friend, the Leader of the Opposition<br />
( Dr. Evatt), or anybody else who has<br />
been in office in this country, that it is<br />
quite true that the salary of the Governor-<br />
General has stood at Å 10,000 since 1901.<br />
It is equally true, though this writer suppressed<br />
it, that that salary is free of tax,<br />
whereas the Prime Minister's salary is, of<br />
course, like anybody else's, taxable.<br />
It is also true that ever since 1901, instead<br />
of changing the salary itself, every<br />
government in succession has accommodated<br />
the Governor-General's office to the<br />
changes that occur by carrying on the<br />
Estimates more and more of the expenditure<br />
that the Governor-General has to<br />
incur. The total vote to-day of that kind<br />
is just on Å 50,000. I do not object to it;<br />
I think it is quite right. For the comparable<br />
items which might be related to the<br />
Prime Minister's allowance, the total would<br />
be certainly not less than Å 17,000 or<br />
Å 18,000. But the newspaper, so desperate<br />
to create a false impression in the public<br />
mind, set out to tell these two absolutely<br />
cracking lies in order to stir up public<br />
opinion. Having said that-I hope with great<br />
moderation and restraint-I will turn to<br />
the other champion dealing with us-the<br />
Sydney Morning Herald Judging by<br />
recent experience, this newspaper understands<br />
the art of monopoly better than,<br />
perhaps, anybody else in the country. I </p>
<p>say -this quite plainly and I hope that many<br />
thousands'of its readers may hear or read<br />
what* 1 say about it: It has conducted a<br />
compl * etely * vicious and misleading campaign.<br />
admit that its reputation for accuracy<br />
has steadily declined in recent yearscertainly<br />
whenever I have had the misfortune<br />
to be in the way. Its antipathy-I<br />
was going to say to my Government, but I<br />
think I should say to any government that<br />
happens po be in office-is well known.<br />
But, day after day, it has published leading<br />
articles on this matter. These articles have<br />
a singularly undergraduate quality in their<br />
thinking and expression, but at any rate<br />
they lose no opportunity to cry down the<br />
quality of the Federal Parliament. Sir, I<br />
hope I will be allowed to say this, and I<br />
hope that people will ponder over it: I have<br />
not observed that any of the rich men who<br />
control this newspaper have offered themselves<br />
for parliamentary service or have<br />
Ccome out of their comfortable anonymity so<br />
that the people may see them and judge<br />
them. One of the most unctuous opinions repeatedly<br />
expressed by this journal is that<br />
we should not seek to attract able men to<br />
Parliament by increasing salaries, since parliamentary<br />
service is a vocation to which<br />
men and women should not be lured by<br />
money. Sir, perhaps I can speak with some<br />
authority about this matter because I do not<br />
think my worst enemy would think I did<br />
not have some sense of vocation in this<br />
matter. My six years as Opposition Leader<br />
\.-with a parliamentary salary of Å 1,000 for<br />
the most part and an Opposition leader's<br />
Å 400 a year with no travelling allowance or<br />
electorate expenses, cost me a substantial<br />
proportion of my savings-with the complete<br />
approval of this newspaper. Sir, I<br />
Qbelieve in Parliament as a vocation which<br />
involves sacrifices, somdtimes of money,<br />
almost always of family life and of the helping<br />
of the future of children. The present<br />
recommendations for members will make<br />
none of them rich. They mean simply that<br />
they will not be or become so financially<br />
embarrassed as to have their public capacity<br />
affected.<br />
But, Sir, I have always heard-I have<br />
been credibly informed if that is the right<br />
phrase-that the leaders of the press had a<br />
sense of vocation themselves sufficient to<br />
make them regard themselves as the Fourth Estate. How do those gentlemen of the.<br />
" Sydney Morning Herald" regard their<br />
own vocation? There is a quite simple test.-<br />
by which the general public can determine<br />
the good' faith and merit of the " Sydney*<br />
Morning Herald's opinion. Let that new Ispaper<br />
publish on its front page in respect'<br />
of its managing director-whose name I<br />
think is Henderson-his salary, -the expenses<br />
of all kinds paid on his behalf by<br />
his company, a short summary of the benefits<br />
by way of concessional shareboldings<br />
which have come to him, and a precise<br />
amount of his superannuation benefits,. both<br />
in terms of capital and income. Let them<br />
not weary in well-doing. So that comparisons<br />
may be fair and assist -the judgment<br />
of their readers, let them also publish similar<br />
details in respect of their next two most<br />
highly paid executive or editorial officers.<br />
Then let them publish on the same pageand<br />
without benefit of interlarded comment<br />
-t-he corresponding figures with which, if<br />
they have read the Richardson report, they<br />
are quite familiar, for the Prime Minister,<br />
the Treasurer and the Minister for Trade<br />
of the National Government. The readers<br />
of the Sydney Morning Herald would<br />
then, Sir, have an opportunity of addressing<br />
themselves to the important question somewhat<br />
overlooked in this context: Whbich trio<br />
has the more responsible task in this nation?<br />
Now, Sir, having said that, I want to turn<br />
to one or two other aspects of this matter.<br />
First of all, it has been said-and said by<br />
people of repute whose opinions I respect<br />
-that the time for these proposals is not<br />
opportune; that it may lead to some impact<br />
on the basic wage, or inflation or something<br />
of that sort. I respect that view. It is; a<br />
circumstance which the Cabinet itself discussed<br />
very elaborately before we appointed<br />
a committee. All I want to say about it is.<br />
this: The proposal to which effect is now<br />
being given is a proposal that the salary and<br />
allowances of members of this Parliament<br />
should be dealt with every three years, at<br />
the beginning of each Parliament, and that<br />
the decision should endure, except for some<br />
quite phenomenal or catastrophic circumstances,<br />
for the whole of the period of three<br />
years. Perhaps it is overlooked that in some<br />
States the basic wage is adjusted on the cost<br />
of living every quarter, but in the Commonwealth<br />
jurisdiction there has, in effect, now </p>
<p>developed a practice of an annual review of<br />
the basic wage. Therefore, the basic wage<br />
or some aspect-some material aspect-of<br />
wages will be under examination every year,<br />
and therefore every year will be a year in<br />
which it is the wrong time to deal with the<br />
salaries and allowances of members of Parliament.<br />
We do not do it this year, but we<br />
do it next year. But next year, the same<br />
business is on. Honorable members will<br />
understand quite plainly that if you are to<br />
refuse to have parliamentary salaries and<br />
allowances dealt with because in the same<br />
year there are wage investigations, then parliamentary<br />
salaries and allowances will not<br />
be dealt with at all for many years to come.<br />
That is my answer to those who, quite<br />
honestly, feel that this is untimely. It always<br />
was untimely, by the way. I do not remember<br />
any occasion on which somebody did<br />
not find it possible to say that the time was<br />
not ripe. But a matter of this kind cannot<br />
be left indefinitely. It is not decent to say<br />
to members of this Parliament that year<br />
after year, whatever comes or goes, they are<br />
not to have their emoluments and their<br />
expenses adjusted. It would be a monstrosity.<br />
Indeed, Sir, I think I ought to permit<br />
myself this remark: There are still a few<br />
people in'Australia who look back to what<br />
they believe to be the good old days when<br />
members of Parliament were not paid at all.<br />
I say this as somebody who, I would have<br />
hoped, was notoriously not greedy on these<br />
niatters:' Unless there were payment of<br />
member's of Parliament and that payment<br />
was adjusted from time to time in the light<br />
of the ' demands of members of Parliament<br />
-if we' went back to the old days-there<br />
would be no Labour Party except by great<br />
sacrifices on the part of trade unions and<br />
People outside to enable them to come here.<br />
Payment of members of Parliament was<br />
one of the earliest reforms advocated in the<br />
nineteenth century, and a very good reform<br />
it was since it enables Parliament to be made<br />
up of a general cross-section of the country<br />
and not of people who are the paid representatives<br />
of some group and of people so<br />
well off that they do not need to be paid at<br />
all. That is not true parliamentary representation.<br />
We have in this House representation<br />
of every kind and class of activity in<br />
the country, and it is a good thing for Australia<br />
that that is so. I apologize for being so long, but the time<br />
must not be begrudged that will enable the<br />
other side of this controversy to, be. made<br />
known. Let me say something about the salaries<br />
and allowances that have been recommended<br />
for members. The committee has<br />
recommended an increase of Å 400 a year<br />
in the salaries. Now Sir, whether that<br />
figure is right or wrong is, after all, a matter<br />
of judgment after consideration of the<br />
facts. It is not a matter of prejudice. It<br />
is not a matter of guesswork. It ought to<br />
be a matter of judgment on the facts. It<br />
has nothing to do with principle; it has<br />
nothing to do with conscience. What the<br />
increase ought to be is a matter than can be<br />
determined only with a knowledge of the<br />
evidence on which the committee acted.<br />
How can we know what the evidence was?<br />
Honorable members of this House, of all<br />
parties, laid material before the committee<br />
and gave confidential information. They<br />
are not going to have that information published<br />
to the world.<br />
Mr. Clyde Cameron.-I do not mind if<br />
my overdraft is published.<br />
Mr. MENZIES.-No. but that'iS because<br />
your bank manager is familiar with it<br />
already. These things are not to be made<br />
matters of public notoriety. I have not<br />
seen the material put forward by any<br />
honorable member, nor has any newspaper<br />
writer. The committee saw this evidence,<br />
and the committee formed its judgment on<br />
it. Somebody might have said that the<br />
increase should be Å 200. I would have<br />
thought that in all the circumstances nobody<br />
could decently have suggested less<br />
than Å 200, having regard to the events<br />
that have occurred. Somebody might say<br />
Å 200; somebody else might Say Å 250, and',<br />
indeed, somebody might say Å 500. The<br />
committee has formed its judgment and has<br />
said Å 400-and this is the recommendation,<br />
mark you, which has brought down the<br />
major volley of abuse, the recommendation<br />
for the increase for private members. It<br />
has been said, " I do not mind about the<br />
Ministers", and " Of course the Prime<br />
Minister ought to be paid more", but<br />
private members? No!<br />
Somebody had the impertinence to say<br />
that this committee had sat secretly, that<br />
there was something furtive about the whole </p>
<p>business. Furtive! The commitee was appointed<br />
and a public announcement made.<br />
The committee then sat. It advertised to<br />
the public that it would be glad to receive<br />
evidence from members of the public,<br />
either orally or in writing, and it invited<br />
every member of both houses of this<br />
Parliament, by circular, to offer such information<br />
as they cared to. Not only were<br />
various members of the public interviewed,<br />
at their own request, by the committee, but<br />
-and I state a conservative figure-no less<br />
than 1,500 written communications were<br />
received by the committee from persons<br />
other than members of Parliament. Every<br />
one of those communications was read;<br />
every one of them was laid before the<br />
committee. Therefore the committee had<br />
the material before it on which it could<br />
apply its mind to the decision. What it<br />
did was to set out to establish a standard<br />
which would enable men of ability and<br />
without private means to offer themselves<br />
S to Parliament and to remain in Parliament.<br />
Does anybody quarrel with that as<br />
a standard? Does anybody in Australia<br />
want to have a national Parliamentremember<br />
that this is the great Parliament<br />
of the country-from which men of ability<br />
without private means will be excluded for<br />
financial reasons? The question has only<br />
to be put to answer itself.<br />
Now,. Sir, I have stated the position as<br />
regards salaries. Of course it has been<br />
said, not here but elsewhere, " The federal<br />
committee was hand-picked Well, I sup-<br />
C pose it was. I suppose every committee<br />
that is appointed, without being elected by<br />
somebody, is hand-picked. I suppose the<br />
newspaper editors and their right-hand men<br />
are hand-picked, since I have no reason to<br />
believe that they are elected by anybody.<br />
Therefore, if hand-picked means chosen, we<br />
plead guilty-they were chosen. But, as I<br />
said before, I have not read or heard of<br />
anybody sufficiently bold to accuse the three<br />
prominent citizens who sat on the committee<br />
of dishonesty or of indirect motives<br />
or of intellectual incompetence.<br />
It is very interesting that the Victorian<br />
Government appointed a committee which<br />
recently made a report. I do not think<br />
there was one man on the committee who<br />
could be accused of being-what is the expression-<br />
a great business tycoon. They<br />
seemed to me to be well known, highly regarded, respectable, normal citizens, and<br />
they made a report. The interesting point<br />
is that, despite the material difference in<br />
responsibilities between the Parliament of<br />
the nation and a parliament of one State,<br />
that committee made recommendations certainly<br />
no less adequate than the ones that<br />
we are considering, and in some respects<br />
even more so. But I have not so far read<br />
any attack either on the membership or on<br />
the report of that committee.<br />
Now, Sir, apart altogether from salaries,<br />
the Richardson committee made recommendations<br />
regarding increases in the electorate<br />
allowances of members. There has been an<br />
enormous amount of misleading comment<br />
on this matter. I just want to make one<br />
or two remarks about this aspect. I know<br />
that every honorable member is aware of<br />
these facts, but I am sure that many people<br />
are not. Of course this practice of publishing<br />
members' salaries and allowances, adding<br />
the two together and calling the result<br />
the salary, is a clever little trick.<br />
Mr. Luchetti.-Dishonest.<br />
Mr. MENZIES.-It is quite dishonest,<br />
quite fraudulent, but I find'that people are<br />
misled by it. I wonder what would happen<br />
of some of the people who: practice this<br />
little trick had their own expenses added on<br />
to their salaries and the totals published as<br />
their salaries. Dear me, I can hardly imagine<br />
the consequences of it! Of course,<br />
electorate expenses are granted in order to<br />
cover electorate expenses.. They are granted<br />
to recoup a member of Parliament for the<br />
expenditure which he must incur if he is<br />
going to be a conscientious and competent<br />
representative of his electorate.-Of course,<br />
the expenses vary from place to place. How<br />
can you do more than establish a : sensible<br />
average in matters such as this? I will<br />
undertake to say that there are honorable<br />
members in this House, with large, rambling<br />
country electorates, who spend far more in<br />
attending to their electorates, going from<br />
place to place, driving their cars, paying<br />
their hotel bills, attending to their corre-<br />
Rpondence and paying postages, than they<br />
get under the existing allowances.<br />
I thought the committee did a very sensible<br />
thing in regard to this matter. Realizing<br />
that all this argument about allowances<br />
was grossly misunderstood, it set out to </p>
<p>classify some of the items on which members<br />
have to spend money. It mentioned<br />
dona -tions, subscriptions, accommodation,<br />
travelling expenses, postages and other<br />
matters. I am not going to take up time<br />
in reading that part of the report. I only<br />
hope that most people will ultimately read<br />
it. But, having looked at it and considered<br />
it, who are we to say that the sum that is<br />
calculated is wrong? How would I know?<br />
Take my own case, as Prime Minister, with<br />
a major responsibility for Cabinet decisions.<br />
How on earth would I know what the<br />
honorable member for Darling ( Mr. Clark)<br />
has to spend, or the honorable member for<br />
Macquarie ( Mr. Luchetti), or the honorable<br />
member for Kalgoorlie ( Mr. Browne), in<br />
the course of a year in representing their<br />
particular electorates. The committee, I<br />
think, directed its mind to that with the<br />
greatest possible care, and it has made<br />
recommendations. Apparently, we are invited<br />
to reject these recommendations, not<br />
in favour of a carefully calculated sum<br />
but in favour of a mere guess, a mere<br />
uninformed guess, as to what the amount<br />
should be.<br />
Now. Sir, the next point that I want to<br />
mention-it also has a bearing on this<br />
matter-was mentioned by the Richardson<br />
Committee in its report for, I think, the<br />
first time. It is very well for people to<br />
affect to sneer at members of Parliament<br />
-the * very ones whom they elected to this<br />
place as the-best available candidates not so<br />
long ago! But most members of Parliament<br />
have the great privilege of possessing<br />
a wife, and everybody who has sat in Parliament<br />
for any time at all knows that his<br />
wife works as hard as he does in the representation<br />
of the people. I marvel from<br />
time to time at the labours that are undertaken<br />
by our wives, some cynic may say<br />
in our interests, but I prefer to say in the<br />
interests of the discharge of our public<br />
duties. The committee has pointed this<br />
out. Is the point of view that that does<br />
not matter? How can the wife of a member<br />
of Parliament or a Minister discharge<br />
her public responsibilities and at the same<br />
time do what she would like to do about the<br />
bringing up and educating of her family?<br />
This is a matter of far more than money.<br />
This is the sacrifice that is made by people<br />
who go into Parliament, and the whole<br />
future, of the sons and daughters of very<br />
many members of Parliament has been affected by the fact that there has' been no<br />
opportunity to give them the close parental<br />
consideration that would normally be given<br />
in the ordinary household. I do not want<br />
to be like some of these critics and convert<br />
everything into cash. I will content myself<br />
by saying that I think a parliamentary wife<br />
is worth something, and that it would be<br />
a great pity if a member of Parliament did'<br />
not receive a degree of remuneration which<br />
enabled his wife to do these things in the<br />
public field while, at the same time, discharging<br />
her duties as a wife and as a<br />
mother. I turn now to members' pensions. This<br />
committee did a valuable service in this respect<br />
because it pointed out-many honorable<br />
members more familiar with the<br />
details than I am may have realized it<br />
already, but it certainly pointed out to me,<br />
among others-that this parliamentary pensions<br />
scheme, so far from being something<br />
for which the taxpayer assumes complete<br />
responsibility is, in an uncommonly hig'* i<br />
degree contributory. You know how people<br />
are so willing to sneer about these things,<br />
saying, Oh, yes, they have pensions and<br />
they pay practically nothing for them<br />
That is a lot of nonsense. I have yet to<br />
hear of any superannuation scheme outside<br />
Parliament under which an employee, if<br />
we may so describe ourselves for that<br />
purpose, pays 10 per cent, of his salary<br />
into the superannuation fund. The committee<br />
pointed this out, and said-I am sure<br />
that nobody could seriously disagree with it<br />
-that therefore these pension benefits<br />
ought to be improved, that a slight increase<br />
in the payments by members would enable<br />
that improvement to be made, and that<br />
under anything short of abnormal circumstances,<br />
the fund would be, as it is to-day,<br />
extraordinarily solvent. I do not think it is<br />
very good English to say that something is<br />
" 1extraordinarily solvent but it means,<br />
presumably, that there is a pretty substantial<br />
credit balance, thanks to members<br />
contributions. The present recommendations<br />
will still leave the parliamentary pensions<br />
scheme much more onerous to contributors<br />
than any outside scheme of which<br />
we have knowledge. But I do urge that the<br />
people should understand that although<br />
there has been a whipping up of opinion on<br />
this matter, the parliamentary pensions<br />
scheme is in. fact one for which members<br />
themselves carry a degree of responsibility </p>
<p>greater than that which people in superannuation<br />
schemes in any other walk of life<br />
that I know of are called upon to carry.<br />
One question that arises at once is<br />
whether the pension benefits should be<br />
made retrospective. I use the word rather<br />
loosely. The question is whether those<br />
who,, having gone out of Parliament, are<br />
already drawing parliamentary pensions,<br />
should have the benefit of these improvements.<br />
There is no recomm endation on<br />
that point by the commitee. The Cabinet<br />
is of opinion that in these circumstances,<br />
as there will be additional contributions and<br />
additional benefits in future, the contributory<br />
pensions now being paid ought to<br />
remain on their existing footing and that<br />
the increased pensions ought to have only<br />
a future operation.<br />
Now, Sir,, having said that, I turn to the<br />
great problem of Ministers' salaries. I do<br />
Qmnoatn p riosp omseu ctho osafy avne rya dmvouccaht ea bionu th iist. oNwon<br />
cause; I very much prefer to do what I have<br />
been doing so far, that is, to advocate the<br />
cause of members of this Parliament. But,<br />
of course, Ministers' salaries were bound<br />
to be reviewed. I hope that everybody in<br />
Australia. will understand that when thc<br />
first Richardson committee was appointed<br />
and made its report in 1955 the Cabinet<br />
expressly excluded from its terms of<br />
reference the salaries of Ministers and parliamentary<br />
officers, because we felt that at<br />
that time in some particular circumstances<br />
Cwme a tthear, d wtoi thsohuot wd ean yliinttgle tor esmtreaminbt erosn thtehiirs<br />
right to a review. In the result, seven years<br />
of great economic changes and stresses and<br />
all kinds of circumstances have gone by<br />
since the! salaries of Ministers in this Parliament<br />
were looked at, and I would think<br />
( Lthmat ean soAmuesbtordalyi anw outold cnoemede taol obneg a atp rethttiys<br />
stage and say that they ought not to be<br />
reviewed on this occasion.<br />
Sir, in the -result, the committee has<br />
looked at this matter. It has recommended<br />
two things about Ministers, one an increase<br />
in salaries and the other a series of<br />
non-contributory pensions for Ministers<br />
with a minimum period of six years of service<br />
as Ministers and a maximum period<br />
of ten years or more. We have given a great deal of thought to this. We shrewdly<br />
suspect that the committee regarded thesc<br />
two things as being in parallel and recommended<br />
them both, thinking that they<br />
supplemented, each other. But we had<br />
many discussions and we quite freely<br />
reached the conclusion that to introduce<br />
these pension payments for people other<br />
than the one exception, that was originally<br />
established years ago in regard to a Prime<br />
Minister, would be wrong. We thought<br />
that it would be a good thing if, instead of<br />
having non-contributory pensions for<br />
Ministers, we applied ourselves to the task<br />
of seeing whether some suitable contributory<br />
scheme, quite distinct from the members'<br />
fund, could be worked out. Of course,<br />
that will take time. Therefore we say<br />
nothing more about it except this, that we<br />
are not legislating for non-contributory<br />
pensions for Ministers on this occasion.<br />
Sir, I had no idea, when I stood up, that<br />
I was going to speak for an hour, and it<br />
seems fantastic to have to refer, before I<br />
sit down, to one magnificient item-motor<br />
cars-because the committee made a recommendation.<br />
I do not know why; it is not a<br />
very great matter. But it was to the effect<br />
that anybody who had been Prime Minister,<br />
Deputy Prime Minister, Leader of the<br />
Opposition or Deputy Leader of the Opposition<br />
in this House for five long, weary<br />
years was to have for three years after he<br />
left Parliament the benefit of an Official car,<br />
no doubt for public and official functions.<br />
Well, it is one of those little things that<br />
have attracted so much attention from some<br />
people that one would think it was almost<br />
earth-shaking. In fact, there has been so<br />
much argument about it that anybody who<br />
stands a chance of being a beneficiary from<br />
it would, if he is like me, sooner be without.<br />
Therefore, we drop it. It flutters to the<br />
ground like a dead leaf. It is gone. I hope<br />
that that knowledge will give everybody<br />
great comfort, and I part with * it, myself,<br />
with no sorrow at all.<br />
Mr. Speaker, I conclude with the hope<br />
that the Australian public, now having<br />
heard, in an imperfect way and by no means<br />
exhaustively, the case for their elected<br />
representatives in Parliament, will consider<br />
that case with care and will determine it<br />
with their usual judgment.<br />
