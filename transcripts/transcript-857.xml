STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER THE RT. HON.<br />
SIR ROBKRT MENZIiS<br />
The Prime Minister* Sir Robert Menzies, said<br />
today that his Goverment regarded the defence issue as one<br />
of the most important in the current election campaign.<br />
The Government's defence planning based on the<br />
advice of the senior officers of the three defence services,<br />
envisaged the highest possible degree of mobility for the<br />
forces. With this in view the Royal Australian Air Force<br />
was now equipped with the Aercules, the finest transport<br />
aircraft in service anywhere in the world, which was capable<br />
of shifting well-equipped army units to any threatened area<br />
within a few hours.<br />
Mobility of forces, the Prime Minister said,<br />
answered Australia's special problems of area and distance far<br />
better than the sort of static defene, with small units<br />
scattered all over the continent, which was the essence of<br />
Mr. CalwllIs thinking.<br />
The government was also providing the RAF with the<br />
Mirage fighter and the TFX bomber each the best of its kind<br />
in the world and each eapable of reaching any part of Australia<br />
in a few hours. Guided missile destroyers which would come into<br />
service before very long and a submarine force would help to<br />
make the Royal Australian Navy the most modern and effective<br />
for its size in the world.<br />
Sir Robert Menzies said that in an attempt to<br />
" buy" votes in the New South Wales electorate of Cowper, which<br />
Labour unexpectedly won in 1961, Mr. Calwell had last week<br />
promised to station a battle aroup in the town of Grafton.<br />
Perhaps it was the same battle group he had already promised<br />
to Western Australia. In any case, It was the sort of<br />
irresponsible promise which carried to its logical conclusion,<br />
would result in the ineffectual dispersal of our forces all<br />
around Australia, particularly in doubtful electorates and<br />
an inability to concentrate our strength where it might be<br />
most needed. The splitting of our forces into small widely<br />
separated groups destroyed completely the concept of concentrated<br />
training and quick movement on which the whole of the planning<br />
of our military experts depended.<br />
Mobility, on the other hand, would allow us to<br />
bring to bear In the minimum of time considerable concentrated<br />
power at a point of attack. It also would allow us to move<br />
our forces to points outside Australia. It seemed to be the<br />
labour Party's view that any war should preferably be fought<br />
on Australian soil. This was not the present Government's idea.<br />
The Labour Party's amxlety for power had led it<br />
into making many promises which in defence matters especially,<br />
ran counter to oxpert advice, It was strange, for example,<br />
to read Mr. Calwell's proposal to build a naval base in<br />
Western Australia in the same speech in which he declared his<br />
intention to " re-negotiate" the agreement with the United States<br />
for a naval communications station at North West Cape. / 2 </p>
<p>2.<br />
Re-negotiation on Mr. Calvell's terms could<br />
well lead to United States withdrawal from the area just<br />
as Dr. Evatt's " r-negotiation" over Manus Island after the<br />
last war had led to United States abandonment of plans to<br />
establish a base there which could have made a tremendous<br />
difference to Australia's security. Withdrawal of the United<br />
States fro the North. West Cawp could administer to Australian<br />
defence plans an irreparable setback.<br />
The present Government's friendly co-operation<br />
with our United States ally in the North West Cape agreement<br />
was the best assurunce of the defence of the western and<br />
north-western areas of Australia. The Government would stand<br />
firm on its agreement beoause it meant so much to our future<br />
security. PERTH, 17th November, 1963. </p>
