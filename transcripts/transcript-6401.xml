E. O. E. -PROOF ONLY<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF PRESS CONFERENCE, 1 JUNE 1984, ON THE REPORT<br />
OF THE PANEL OF REVIEW OF PROPOSED INCOME AND ASSETS TEST<br />
PM: At the outset I would like to sent -two thank yousone<br />
of course to the panel under Professor Gruen for the work<br />
that they have done in assisting the Government and the<br />
community in a better understanding of these complex issues<br />
and I would here in this context directly like to pay tribut~ e<br />
to the work of my two colleagues Senator Grimes and Senator-.<br />
Gietzelt who have throughout co-operated very very closely with<br />
me as we have come to the final stage of the decision making<br />
in this area.<br />
Now, what I want to say on behalf of the Government is that<br />
we believe that we have done what the great majority of the<br />
Australian community would seek to have achieved and that is<br />
to create a capacityi not only in this Government, but in any<br />
successive Government to be able better to provide for those<br />
who are most in need.<br />
You will recall that when we first addressed ourselves to this<br />
issue last year we indicated that our major concern was to<br />
bring to an end that totally inequitable situation under which<br />
pensioners who were very asset-rich and so able to arrange<br />
their assets that they received the whole or part of the pension,<br />
while people significantly less well placed than they were in a<br />
position where they did not receive the pension.<br />
This was an inequity which had been recognised increasingly<br />
within the Australian welfare community and amongst economists<br />
generally. And the scheme that we have brought in now is<br />
fair and reasonable and ensures that that inequity has been<br />
removed. The value of the scheme, therefore, is to be adjudged not<br />
merely in terms of the revenue that wil~ l be obtained from<br />
1985/ 6 of at least 45 million, we believe, and in growing<br />
amounts after that, but also in terms of the removal of that<br />
substantial inequity.<br />
The great thing that we see is that the overwhelming majorit~ y<br />
of pensioners are not only not going to be disadvantaged, but<br />
very importantly and I am sure that they will increasingly<br />
come to understand this, that they will be advantaged, because,<br />
as I say, this Government and successive Governments are going<br />
to be better placed financially to ensure that limited resources<br />
are going to be available in greater amounts to look after<br />
those who are most in need. </p>
<p>-7-2.<br />
I would make the point here in this conference, as I did<br />
quite openly in the House in my speech, and that is that we<br />
can see that in addressing ourselves to the problem that I<br />
have outlined here, that the first proposal we brought down<br />
on examination can be seen to have been inadequate. I<br />
recognise that and I believe it is to the credit of the<br />
Government that we have not been pig-headed about this, but<br />
we have sat down, tried to get a representative panel to<br />
assist us in our consideration. Quite clearly their work<br />
shows the relative inequities of that standard against other<br />
alternatives.<br />
We believe it is right that we should have taket more time on<br />
this and, as I have said, the Australian community is now<br />
better off because we have been prepared to acknowledge the<br />
inadequacy of the first decision and come to this one.<br />
The Australian community would have been worse off, as I put<br />
it, if we had remained rigid and wrong.<br />
Let me just briefly address myself to the question of the<br />
exclusion of the home. This has been a centrally important<br />
issue of concern with the panel in their thinking and with<br />
ours and with very many people in the community. There is,<br />
as the panel says, no perfect answer, but we believe that in<br />
this area there is a feeling, not merely in Sydney which tenets<br />
to get highlighted, but throughout the community there is some<br />
special significance tttached to the home. People don't like<br />
to feel that that is'something which is included in some sort<br />
of testing in their rightfs in regard to the pension. And we<br />
have recognised that and have moved therefore to exclude the<br />
home, as it was indeed excluded in the first proposals.<br />
I would again make the point here that -1 did in the House and<br />
that is, I suppose, that it may have been easier for this<br />
Government just to wash its hands of all this and say, look,<br />
there is some actual or potential political flak out there<br />
if you move on the question of an assets test. But, as I said<br />
in the House, the Leader of the opposition was right when in<br />
his capacity as a Government backbencher in September 1981 he<br />
addressed himself to this issue and said that Governments<br />
needed to show courage if they were going to get right<br />
priorities in the area of social welfare expenditure.<br />
I believe we have shown that courage and I would hope that<br />
that will be reflected by people in the opposition, not only<br />
those who have indicated by previous statements that they<br />
agree with it, such as the Deputy Leader of the opposition<br />
and Senator Chaney, but more widely.<br />
GRIMES: NO, I would just echo what Bob has said. I think it<br />
ifair and equitable and it will be conceived as such by the<br />
community. / 3<br />
t, 1 17 1. 1, 1 </p>
<p>3.<br />
If I could just correct one furphy which has featured<br />
prominently in both Mr. Peacock and Senator Messner' s<br />
speech today which I think is worth cutting off before<br />
people get too agitated about it.<br />
If people do take the option of a loan or a lien on the<br />
estate, what both those gentlemen have done is to have<br />
calculated the amount that that would total up to if they<br />
live to be 85 or 95 and come to some extraordinary figures.<br />
The one mistake they are making, of course, is that once<br />
people take a loan of that type the amount that they owe<br />
comes off their assets, comes off their estate, in a very<br />
few years, they would very quickly become eligible for the<br />
pension without any need for that loan or lien. The only<br />
person who could reach that level would be a multi<br />
millionaire and they are not going to want to buy a pension<br />
or get a pension anyway.<br />
GIETZELT: I think, ladies and gentlemen, that the final<br />
decision that we have made has been a very equitable one<br />
and it has taken a very firm step in establishing a welfare<br />
system based on need which is an important strategy that the<br />
Government has adopted overall. And that the sort of savings<br />
that we set out to establish will be realised, but probably<br />
on a more fairer basis as a result of the decision that the<br />
Government and the Caucus have adopted today.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr. Hawke, you have said the system of<br />
admini-stration depends heyily on self-declaration. What are<br />
the safeguards that you a ze including to prevent the avoidance<br />
which you say is occurring in the income test?<br />
PM: Well, it is simply in the absence of assets being counted.<br />
aind being arranged in a way that there is only income that is<br />
involved, then that basic fact of itself meant avoidance. Once<br />
assets are in as well as income tests, then that means that<br />
you move substantially to avoidance. It must be understood,<br />
and it is relevant to your question, Warwick, that now with<br />
an incomes and an assets test in existence, both don't apply<br />
and I-think that is appreciated that if you were trying to<br />
bear both in that would not be appropriate, but the situation<br />
is that if their-pension would not be reduced as a result'of<br />
the assets test then they are not affected by this. So it<br />
really means that what you will be substantially getting at<br />
is people with very substantial assets and little income. Thai:<br />
is really the area of those who have substantially been<br />
avoiding the income test.<br />
JOURNALIST: Yes, but aren't they the very same people who have,<br />
as you say, been avoiding in the past and have been avoiding in<br />
the taxation area too? / 4 </p>
<p>GRIMES: Can I just add to that that I think what you are<br />
asking was how in a self-declaration system you get people<br />
to comply.<br />
PM: The mechanics of it, I'm sorry.<br />
JOURNALIST: The safeguards of it.<br />
GRIMES: There are two ways. The first way we do it is that<br />
the penalties already in the Social Security Act and we have<br />
got no reason to change them, for people who give false<br />
information the vast majority of people are honest, the<br />
vast majority of people won't be affected anyhdw. The second<br />
one is that obviously there will be a spot check on people who<br />
make outrageous understatements who outrageously understate<br />
their assets. NOw, of course there will be some slippage.<br />
There always is. But as for the people who are already<br />
avoiding it, they are avoiding it by getting into artificial<br />
schemes which provide an income which is termed capital but<br />
not income. They will be picked up and they will also be picked<br />
up in any taxation review. -1. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Are farmers going to be hardest hit Prime Minis-ter.<br />
As I understand it curtilage only covers the home paddock. It<br />
means farmers clearing their farms or in retirement would be<br />
0. much higher assets than ordinary pensioners?<br />
Well of course it depends to some extent where it is.<br />
But there will be available to farmers if they so wish to do it<br />
the proposition about the lien. So that if they really are<br />
in a situation where they need the pension they can pursue that<br />
course. And they-will have, as far as the home is concerned,<br />
exactly the same right as-everyone else.<br />
JOUPRIALIST: Prime Minister you~ acknowledged in the Parliament<br />
some responsibility on the part of your Goverxtient for, I think<br />
the word was confusion that has occurred '. 4ith pensioners. 0<br />
That's right because we recognised the problem and we<br />
sought to reintroduce an assets test in some sense like the<br />
previous one which had existed up until 1976 and then as as<br />
certain suggestions were made about particular sorts of difficulties,<br />
for example the holiday home, the package was adapted. But in a<br />
way which meant that you were in a sense quite arbitrarily<br />
differentiating between different lifestyles and different ways<br />
in which people had accumulated assets. And in that situation<br />
you had a few problems.-one of intrinsic inequities between<br />
different sorts of collections of assets and secondly, an<br />
uncertainty as to whether this or that item would be in.<br />
Now I don't think I could have been more straightforward in<br />
sayring well, when wei looked at it and t# 6' listened to people<br />
we did see that there were problems and I don't seek to avoid<br />
that. But I simply say ( to the people of Australia I believe<br />
that they would much prefer to have governments such as ours<br />
which once we've looked at something and see that we have made<br />
a mistake or could do something better, that we're prepared to<br />
acknowledge that and move to something which we believe more<br />
obviously completely meets the requirements of efficiency an.' d<br />
equity. JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, in this case though hasn't consensus<br />
itself created uncertainty and fear in a sensitive section<br />
of the community? I don't see how you say consensus has created fear.<br />
JOURNALIST: The open debate, open changes, the discussion on<br />
the assets test has been in the media for nearly 12 months,<br />
first put forward in the Budget last year and there's been an<br />
immense amount of debate, admittedly changed, but the debate<br />
hasn't that caused the.-f ear itself;<br />
It's the nature of the interjections into the debate<br />
and I made the point in my speech in the House, as Don did in<br />
delivering the same speech in the Senate.-that there has been<br />
a deliberate attempt to misrepresent and distort the whole<br />
range of this debate, not least in respect of the area of the lien,<br />
as though this was something which was being forced on people ./ 6 </p>
<p>P. M. cont.: whereas in fact, as I put to you, only simply you<br />
have to ask yourself the question: are people going to be<br />
better off or not by having that available to exercise if they<br />
wish to do so. Now there has been a gross distortion by thE!<br />
Opposition about this, whereas we've been I believe straightforward.<br />
We' 1ve said there in February, we announced look there are<br />
problems about this, we're going to have another look at it.<br />
I just make the point, if you look at the composition of the<br />
panel, because what the Opposition in the Parliament is sayingno<br />
assets test that this is not right, that pensioners don't<br />
want it. Well I just remind you of the sort of people that<br />
were on the panel apart from if you like the academic leadership<br />
of Professor Gruen and the financial representation of Mr Mark<br />
Johnson of the bank, we have Sir William Keys for returned<br />
servicemen, we have McKenzie of ACOSSh~ and'you have Mr Priest<br />
from the Australian Pensioners Federation,-and you have<br />
Mrs Thurgood of the Civilian Widows' Association. Now what we've<br />
done is to have these people and I believe that they are going<br />
to be able to say fairly effectively whether in a situation<br />
of limited capacities on governments and financial terms, whether<br />
it's .: appropriate to have an assets test or not. So they've<br />
said that and obviously-once you go to an area that concerns<br />
peoples' income and also i. taffects.. their perceptions of their<br />
place in society in their latter years, there are going to<br />
be emotions and I think the great disservice that' õ .. been done<br />
in this debate in this : period is that there has been this<br />
pursuit of perceived political self-interest by trying to show<br />
that there should be no assets test at all. That really is<br />
wrong. JOURNALIST: Prime Minip ter, considering the potential for<br />
political backlash. in dstablishing th-is as a social precedent,<br />
was it worth it.<br />
Of course it's worth it because if the principle is<br />
right then I think you proceed with-it. You talk about po]. itical<br />
backlash. I don't believe that there will be because the<br />
arithmetic of it ultimately is very simple. It should be<br />
understood that the overwhelming majority of pensioners are<br />
not:.-going to be affected. It's a very small proportion'. that<br />
will. Now by introducing equity into it, in respect of that<br />
small proportion, you are going to increase your capacity<br />
as government to do more for the great majority of those who<br />
need help. The arithmetic of it, when understood, will not<br />
involve backlash..<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister you said that the great majority<br />
of people would not be affected. How many do you estimate<br />
will be hit by the test?<br />
Well'I think it's a question best answered by my colleagues<br />
because there are two separate sets within the Social Security<br />
Department and in Veterans' Affairs. Don what's your latest<br />
estimate, I know what I think the answer is. / 7 </p>
<p>7.<br />
GRIMES: The panel, you will remember, Suiggested it wassom. ething<br />
like 28,000 on the figures they had that would be affected.<br />
We believe the number affected will be a bit more than that,<br />
but that they will be each individually affected less<br />
maybe 40,000 in Social Security, but probably less than that.<br />
But they will be each individually affected less.<br />
GIETZELT: It would be the estimate of the Department of<br />
Veterans' Affairs-approximately 5,000 will be affected.<br />
That's out of 200,000 veterans. So your percentage is<br />
very very low. And can I perhaps just amplify what the<br />
Prime Minister has just said about backlash. We '' ve had<br />
the figures taken out. When we established the first test<br />
in the Budget my Department in its six State branches had'<br />
1844 complaints or enquiries in the first four days after<br />
that. In respect to the Gruen Report which was published<br />
last week, in the first four days after that we.' ve had<br />
242. So I don't think that backlash is nearly as strong<br />
as perhaps has been suggested.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister the report made particular<br />
reference to Australia's ethnic and migrant groups and<br />
all sorts of difficulties with refugees with. assets overseas,<br />
people who are living overseas and receiving portability<br />
all those questions. It does say that there hasn't been<br />
time or resources to address the problems. What specifically<br />
are you going to do..<br />
I want to mike a comment about that and because you<br />
get into administrativr areas.-perhaps my colleagues would<br />
like to go to some details. A couple of general comments<br />
I would wish to make firstly, we recognise that there is<br />
a responsibility-upon Government to communicate our position<br />
and the implications of it other than just in the English<br />
language and we will do that. And there is no reason, therefore,<br />
that there will be any-lack of understanding or knowledge of<br />
what is involved. The second point that I would make is -that<br />
the hardship provisions that were involved in the first<br />
test and which. have been endorsed by the Gruenreport will<br />
be available to everyone. And if there are some particular<br />
problems that may apply, whether it's to particular ethnic<br />
groups or others, then those hardship provisions are available.<br />
There will be no way-as a result of the application of the<br />
decisibons of the Government that any particular group will<br />
because of the nature of that group be disadvantaged. But<br />
it may be because there are administrative aspects of this<br />
involved that either Don or Arthur would like to add to that.<br />
GRIMES: The Department of Social Security pays many thousands<br />
of pensions overseas. We have offices overseas-and we administer<br />
an incomes test overseas now. It's not easy but we do so and<br />
we do so quite effectively. The second salutary addition<br />
of an assets test to that, sure adds some complications but not<br />
much. The second thing is that we are negotiating at the moment<br />
with Italy, and once that's settled we will with other countries,<br />
for reciprocal social security agreements. We have*' been<br />
progressing quite rapidly with. that in the last year or so,<br />
so that once that's established, that problem will be much<br />
more easily overcome that it is now.<br />
V 7-</p>
<p>8.<br />
GIETZELT: There's no particular area if people are qualified<br />
for the service pension they must be residlents of Australia.<br />
I mean if they go for a six months' trip, of course, there's<br />
no problem, but they must be legally resident in Australia in<br />
order to qualify. So it's not an issue.<br />
JOURNALIST: for a needs based welfare system. Do you think<br />
the introduction of this assets test, coupled with the lump<br />
sum super decision and its mini-budget decision on the<br />
pension is sufficient to give us a needs based welfare system<br />
or additional measures-are necessary and if so what other<br />
additional measures will you be looking at?<br />
I don'. t go to any particular measures but this Government<br />
will be consistently-looking at ways in which we can introduce more<br />
equity into our whole system. And you've got to understand if<br />
you're going to address this question it's not simply a matter<br />
of social welfare and expenditure outlays, it's a question of<br />
taxation as well and we have made it clear in a number of<br />
statements in the Parliament and elsewhere that we will, wita. 1<br />
the commuunity, through EPAC, and in other ways, be looking at<br />
these issues. The business community of Australia has urged<br />
us that we do this, obviously the Australian Council of Trade<br />
Unions has urged that we-do this and community welfare organisations<br />
have urged that we do this. And we will in consultation we . can<br />
do it. But I can't say at this stage what those community<br />
co-operative consultations and examinations will lead to.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, given that are-you able to give<br />
guarantees that the assets test will continue for some<br />
considerable time in its present form<br />
Yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: Or are you likely to review it again?<br />
No it will continue. We have indicated that it will<br />
indexed, the threshholds will be indexed, and we believe<br />
that we've invested a lot of time and energy and emotion, if<br />
you like, into this-and we're not now, having introduced it<br />
going to be tampering with it.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke you've pointed before to the very<br />
distinguished and representative nature of the Gruen panel.<br />
Wasn't there, therefore, a strong case in adcepting what was<br />
their unanimous recommendation for an all inclusive threshhold.<br />
No, not a case for accepting it. We were not about the<br />
business of handing over the ultimate responsibility of government<br />
to any group and in establishing it we made that-quite clear.<br />
We wanted to be assisted: and I think in our speeches we'd made<br />
it clear that there is involved a very large degree-of acceptance<br />
of what.-the Gruen Committee has done and I think you don't argue<br />
with that. But certainly on the question of the inclusion or<br />
not of the home there are arguments both ways. But I remind you<br />
on that point, that if you read the Gruen committee report closely,<br />
you will see that in coming down as they do for their Option. 2,<br />
as it is in their Report, as against option 3 which excluded the<br />
house up to 150,000, a very large element of their reasoning<br />
was their concern for the position of the non-home owner and<br />
that is a legitimate concern. So we have gone to that in two ways. </p>
<p>P. M. cont...: We've included the home, but said yes we'll 9<br />
recognise their concern, it's a legitimate concern that we have.<br />
There are two ways you'll appreciate in which we've addressed it.<br />
Firstly, that under our scheme for non-home owners there is an<br />
additonal $ 50,000 for both single and married couples at the ' Level<br />
of non-home owner assets that they can have exempt and that's not<br />
to be desctibed as cosmetic because it will be of assistance<br />
in a number of areas. The second is that we've given a<br />
commnitment that in the Budget there will be an increase in<br />
assistance for that category and so I don't think when you<br />
examine it in that light that you can say that we haven't<br />
really substantially accepted the thrust and the concern of the<br />
Gruen Committee. We did have a discussion with them earlier<br />
this week and we explained the situation to them. It will<br />
be for them to make their statements.<br />
JOURNALIST: So Prime Minister, pensioners who pay rent can<br />
expect worthwhile assistance in the August Budget?<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: How will non exempt values by established,<br />
Senator Grimes, and will there be Social Security valuers<br />
or will you be accepting the valuation of the Valuer-General's.<br />
Department valuations?<br />
GRIMES: Up to $ 10,000 people can claim the normal content<br />
of the home. Some people will say they haven't got that<br />
amount and they will claim less and that will be largely by<br />
self-declaration. We are certainly not going to go counting<br />
sheets and things like that. No-one is going to go into<br />
houses and do that sort of thing. Over that people will be<br />
asked an assessment of their assets over that. And again it<br />
will be largely self-dleclaration because most people are<br />
honest and are aware of the non-compliance penalties in the<br />
Act and of course there wf'll be spot checks. If valuations<br />
have to be done in general, they will be done by the Taxation<br />
Department valuers.<br />
JOURNALIST: What are the non-compliance penalties?<br />
GRIMES: Oh dear, I will have to get the Social Security Act.<br />
They are substantial substantial fines etc. but they are<br />
there now. We don't have to put them in. They are already<br />
there.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, will the exclusion of the family<br />
home remain an enduring principle in any future assets test.<br />
For instance, can you give an assurance that after the next orC<br />
future elections the house will remain an exclusion?<br />
PM: I can only speak for the next about three or four elections.<br />
But that theory, yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: And in the capital gains tax, too, Prime Minister?<br />
PM: The capital gains tax has got nothing to do with it.<br />
JOURNALIST: No, no, but the principle of the exclusion of<br />
the family home? </p>
<p>PM: I'm not addressing myself to that issue in this conference.<br />
The position of the Government in respect of what we will be<br />
putting to the people in the next election whenever Don<br />
decides to call it is that we will put our position very<br />
clearly to the people of Australia and on this occasion we will<br />
know the facts as distinct from having them hidden from us by<br />
the other mob.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, you refer to a net saving<br />
of about $ 45 million in the first full year. Can you<br />
tell us what the on-going or recurrent costs of the<br />
scheme will be and also you refer to a net cost of $ 30 million<br />
to start the scheme up after March next year. Can you<br />
tell us who much you will be saving in those few months?<br />
PM: Well, the position is that you are going to have a<br />
very substantial number of people involved in the first<br />
year. It is my understanding, and again my colleague can<br />
talk about this, my understanding is that that-will be reduced<br />
to about roughly, I think, Don, about a quarter of the<br />
establishment number and the actual on-going administrative<br />
costs I think would be in the order of $ 13 million.<br />
GRIMES: The establishment cost is the high cost setting the<br />
thing up, so that in the first year there won't be the savings,<br />
as you say. It is from then on. The savings are of two types.<br />
There are the ones you can quite clearly, as well as you can<br />
in this area, calculate now. The sort of 35 million we are<br />
talking about. But the other saving, whiich is what we are<br />
about really, and which is just not quantifiable is the saving<br />
which will result from the non-proliferation of the schemes<br />
which have existed since 1976, that have proliferated to the<br />
extent, and got pretty cheeky I must say, because in last<br />
Sunday's press on the page with all the controversy about th . e<br />
assets test there was an ad Join our scheme and you can ge~ t<br />
your means test free pi~ ch.<br />
The initial I will have to check the figures the initial.<br />
establishment cost is about 30 million. We will need something<br />
like a staff of about 1500 in Social Security going down to<br />
just over 300 very quickly.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr. Hawke, I understand Sir * William McMahon ha~ s<br />
endorsed this assets test package. Have you considered enlisting<br />
the support of Australia's number one pensioner in promoting it?<br />
PM: No, I'm endebted to Sir William that once again he has -come<br />
out and indicated the segacity of this Government in matters<br />
economic and social. He is a continuing source of support and<br />
is welcomed, as indeed I would simply hope that his successor<br />
in areas of economic spokesmanship in the Liberal Party, Mr.<br />
Howard, who clearly supports us in this, will follow Sir<br />
William McMahon.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you expect Sir William to be the first<br />
pensioner to give up his pension?<br />
PM: Well, have you arranged the ceremony?<br />
1.1 </p>
<p>11.<br />
JOURNALIST: How will the Government go about selling<br />
the test given the confusion which was generated by the<br />
first test?<br />
PM: In a number of ways. Again, Don and Arthur may wish to<br />
aidd to this. But there will be these sorts of levels and<br />
obviously we will discharge our political responsibility,<br />
speaking about it wherever we can in the Parliament and<br />
public forums. Then, I believe that my colleagues will be<br />
very quickly getting information to the pensioner groups and<br />
our very competent and professional friends in the media, I<br />
am sure, will be doing an excellent job. When these things<br />
together are done, I have no fear about the understanding.<br />
JOURNALIST: While the political process has been on the<br />
assets test and we tend to overlook that the incomes test<br />
does bit quite severely, and given the assets test that will<br />
now apply, there seems to be minimum room to start juggling<br />
income and shifting it over to assets in that case, wouldn't<br />
you say that the incomes test, of itself, will bite very<br />
severely? PM: No.<br />
GRIMES: They both don't apply together.<br />
JOURNALIST: No, but whichever one is the most you pay, the<br />
income so, you'vS cut out what $ 30 and $ 50. Well, let's<br />
face it, that's a pretty 1evere. Someone getting 150 a week<br />
as income, I mean, they Are gonners, aren't they?<br />
GRIMES: Our capacity to improve the ease the severity of<br />
the incomes test and our capacity to increase the base rate of<br />
pensions which is what we are really worried about will be<br />
increased by measures which can prevent the avoidance of such a<br />
test. And this is only one measure to try and get rid of that<br />
sort of<br />
PM: I just want to emphasise the great inequity was that you<br />
h-ad a situation it took two people and you really wanted<br />
assess in terms of welfare, it's better off. You had so many<br />
situations where this one who was very much better off had so0<br />
arranged their assets income wise that they iWere getting the<br />
full pension where a person much less well off was not getting<br />
the pension, or a diminished one and it is that sort of<br />
inequity which increase of the assets -test means.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, The Gruen Committee raises or<br />
suggested that fringe benefits be extended to all age persons.<br />
Can you, in fact, refute that suggestion or is that suggestion<br />
still open?<br />
PM: No, we are not including that part of the Gruen Committee ' s<br />
recommendation because the costing of it would not be, in our<br />
judgement, at this stage of our priorities and our economic<br />
constraints, an appropriate priority.<br />

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, I expect we will all be<br />
asking the Professor ourselves, but have you spoken to him<br />
about the Government's decision, and does he generally<br />
accept it?<br />
PM: I think it is right that you should ask him. We meta<br />
matter of knowledge to you, we met with the panel on<br />
Tuesday. JOURNALIST: Full panel?<br />
PM: Full panel.<br />
GRIMES: One person was overseas.<br />
PM: The full available panel.<br />
JOURNALIST: YOur decision wasn't taken at that stage,<br />
though, was it?<br />
PM: It was not finalised. It was shaping up. 1. 1 </p>
