    <content><![CDATA[<p>I announced today the membership of the Australian National Council on Drugs (ANCD) for the next three years.  The Council is a key advisory body to the Commonwealth Government on drug policy and plays a critical role in ensuring the voice of the community is heard in relation to drug related policies and strategies.</p>
<p>Major Brian Watters of the Salvation Army will continue as Chairman of the ANCD, with the membership continuing to represent a wide range of views and expertise.  This diversity has been one of the strengths of the Council over its previous three years.  The new membership (attached) will support the changing role and focus of the ANCD, ensuring that the Government's attack on illicit drugs maintains its momentum and that fresh views continue to be represented on the Council.  The importance of the family in fighting and preventing drug abuse has also been recognised in the make up of the Council, with strengthened family representation.  Overall, the Council is made up of people with a wide range of experience and expertise on various aspects of drug policy, covering treatment, rehabilitation, education, family counselling, law enforcement, research and work at the coalface in community organisations.</p>
<p>I have greatly valued the role played by Major Watters and the Council over the last three years.  The ANCD has added a new dimension to government policy making in the difficult area of drug abuse, based on the front line commitment, experience and other expertise of its members.</p>
<p>In particular, the ANCD has made an important contribution to the development and implementation of the National Illicit Drug Strategy and the Council of Australian Governments' diversion initiative, which sees drug users diverted to compulsory education or treatment.</p>
<p>The independent and evidence-based advice provided by the ANCD will help inform the Government's strategy in its future fight against the damage that drugs cause to individuals and the community.</p>
