TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
DOORSTOP, INTER-CONTINENTAL HOTEL, ADELAIDE, 16 MAY 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
PM: As you know, I am in Adelaide to talk about the Budget and the value<br />
of the changes it brings to the economy and also to make a couple of<br />
important announcements for Australia. One is the building of the<br />
road, the Mount Barker road, and the other is the extension of<br />
Adelaide airport. Now, you know that the Mount Barker road has been<br />
a real problem for people travelling in this state, particularly travelling<br />
to Victoria. It is a problem, of course, for heavy vehicles, it is a<br />
problem for safety and the Commonwealth under its capital programs,<br />
that is the National Highway funding program, in the Budget we<br />
extended it by $ 835 million a year for three years or $ 2.5 billion. That<br />
is what gives us the capacity to do this and we will build a $ 130 million<br />
road through the hills with a tunnel about half a kilometre long, a six<br />
lane dual carriageway highway back out to, I think is it around the<br />
periphery of the city there. This will come just as in two weeks time we<br />
will be launching the One Nation train. This is in the One Nation<br />
project where we built the standard gauge railway across from<br />
Melbourne to Adelaide, so there will be a time soon where you will be<br />
able to travel from Brisbane to Perth via Melbourne and Adelaide on a<br />
single standard gauge. That will be important for the transport corridor<br />
of South Australia coming through into Victoria.<br />
So, you will have these two things. A better road corridor between<br />
South Australia and Victoria and the rest of the country and for the first<br />
time ever an historic change to the rail system where that transport<br />
corridor will be improved in rail as well as road.<br />
The other thing that I am announcing today is that, you know that I<br />
have had quite long and detailed discussions with Mike Rann about<br />
the extension of Adelaide airport and you will recall the motion he<br />
sponsored at the Labor Party Conference. The Government is giving<br />
expression to that commitment at the Conference today, by<br />
announcing that we will begin the site preparation, that is the<br />
engineering design work, and the environmental assessments to begin </p>
<p>the extension of Adelaide airport. In other words, we will build the<br />
extension of Adelaide airport before the Government sells the airport<br />
because we think it is important to get it down and this too will join the<br />
road and rail corridor as an important improvement to the transport<br />
access to South Australia by air, both domestically and internationally.<br />
So, these are very big changes which, in a sense, could only be done<br />
by the National Government and, I think, they will be important for<br />
South Australia in terms of air carriage, air transport, linkages into Asia<br />
and domestically and that important national linkage by road and by<br />
rail back to South Australia and to the rest of the country.<br />
Can I say, this comes as part of the Budget and the Budget is good for<br />
Australia in many respects, but it is particularly good for South<br />
Australia.<br />
J: Mr Keating, you mentioned that you would like to start these projects<br />
( inaudible)...<br />
PM: The Mount Barker road, they will start buying land immediately for that.<br />
We will probably turn the first sod sometime next year and about two<br />
and a half years after that, it should be completed. But, it is going to<br />
be a six lane dual carriageway highway and those six lanes will run<br />
through a half mile tunnel, through the hills. So, it will be quite a<br />
dramatic change.<br />
J: Mr Keating, you said that these are big changes for South Australia.<br />
and in fact changes which South Australians have been asking for for<br />
many years, why have you decided to announce it at this particular<br />
time?<br />
PM: Well, they have come up, the One Nation change comes up from 1992<br />
with the standard gauge. The National Highway program is something<br />
that has come up in the development of the extension of that program.<br />
We have these national projects be they in Queensland or New South<br />
Wales or South Australia set at particular times. In the past we used<br />
to provide this money to the States which was then fragmented and, I<br />
think, under that road program South Australia used to receive<br />
something like $ 50 million. Well, you can't do this with $ 50 million. It<br />
needs a much bigger amount of money, so it needs a national program<br />
and it has come up in this cycle now. But, the same with the airport,<br />
you know that we discussed this at our national conference. I have<br />
had a number of discussions with Mike Rann about it, I have had some<br />
discussions with the Premier about it. I had a long discussion today<br />
with Mike Rann about both projects and again we think this is the time,<br />
given the interest in Asia in South Australia, these potential linkages<br />
between South Australia and the rest of the country in Asia, now is the<br />
time. So, they have come up and I won't say in a routine way, but they<br />
have come up in a way which certainly suits South Australia.<br />
J: election promises ( inaudible) </p>
<p>PM: Yes, but only a silly person would say that because they have been in<br />
the pipe for months and in the case of the train a couple of years. So,<br />
let's not trivialise things. You get this argument sometimes in South<br />
Australia ' well, we don't have enough done for us' and when something<br />
happens you say ' oh, it is only a gift because of an election'. I mean,<br />
look, I spent $ 600 million here, Commonwealth money, trying to relieve<br />
the State Bank problem on the people of South Australia and now we<br />
are doing these major projects that have got nothing to do what so<br />
ever with elections which are not in offer anyway.<br />
J: Prime Minister, what have you done for students considering that two<br />
months ago you said to me at GleneIg ' go and get a job'. I would like<br />
you to justify if you are going to cut $ 1.2 billion from Working Nation,<br />
you have also<br />
PM: Do you want a question or give a speech?<br />
J: I want to ask you a question. Mr Keating, you never once addressed<br />
the issue of post graduate spending to students on the cap<br />
PM: Ok, the complaint was against HECS and undergraduate fees and I<br />
made it very clear.<br />
J: ( inaudible)..<br />
PM: It was against full fees and I said very clearly at the time, the Labor<br />
party would not support fees and we haven't supported fees in the<br />
Budget. All the huffing and puffing turned to nothing because in the<br />
Budget there were no fees.<br />
J: ( inaudible)...<br />
PM: Hang on, excuse me, you have asked a question and I will answer it.<br />
The other thing is with HECS we have got the most democratic and<br />
useful scheme where we ask students now to subscribe 23 per cent<br />
only of the cost of a course. We recover it from them only when they<br />
start to earn at average weekly earnings and every dollar, every cent,<br />
goes back into university places. The Commonwealth spent $ 3 billion<br />
on extra university places for Australian students in the last five years,<br />
$ 1500 million of that has come from the returns from HECS. So, there<br />
is about 100,000 students out there now who wouldn't have a<br />
university place without HECS. Now, the Government does not<br />
support full fees and I have made that clear and the Budget, of course,<br />
makes it clear. As far as post graduate fees are concerned, we are<br />
keeping an eye on post graduate fees. But again, this is a matter<br />
which goes to the autonomous administration of universities and there<br />
is now much greater autonomy in university administration than in the<br />
past. So, the only party in this country that wants to impose full fees<br />
on undergraduates is the Liberal party. At the last election the Liberal </p>
<p>party was running around saying it is full fees and if your parents are<br />
strong enough, financially, to be able to cover full fees that's fine. If<br />
not, well then, of course, a person with a lot of educational attainments<br />
and capacity just wouldn't be in that position.<br />
J: Prime Minister, speaking about the Liberal party, what is your reaction<br />
to Senator Alston's claims in the question of Conrad Black?<br />
PM: That is a complete furPhy and why are they saying it today? They are<br />
saying it today because Mr Connolly has spat the dummy. He is very<br />
unhappy about having been dropped for an opportunist, he is now<br />
saying that Senator Watson, the other person interested in<br />
superannuation, is under threat from Mr Gray, the former Premier Gray<br />
and Dr Shephard were both supporters of the Joh for Canberra<br />
campaign. John Howard believes they cost him the 1987 election. So<br />
there is a great schism at the moment inside the Liberal party about<br />
the fact that Mr Filing in Western Australia had been removed, Mr<br />
Rocher, now Mr Connolly, Mr Watson is under threat and the day's<br />
smoke screen is some conversation I'm supposed to have had with<br />
John Fairfax and Sons. The only party that offered Mr Black 50 per<br />
cent ownership of the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age is the<br />
Liberal party. John Hewson offered it to him about two years ago. I<br />
have never discussed any such thing with him.<br />
J: The Opposition has ( inaudible)<br />
PM: Who cares whether ( inaudible)<br />
J: Richard Alston has three different sources...<br />
PM: Oh God! they are as silly as a piece of string the three of them. You<br />
couldn't trust them out of your sight. Poor old Howard, his nerves are<br />
going. The Budget has cracked him. He is in a terrible state, he is<br />
following me around radio stations, he must sit in his office dialling<br />
them up as I leave them.<br />
J: Have you been defamed by Senator Alston?<br />
PM: I don't think he has defamed me, he just made another unsubstantiated<br />
allegation.<br />
J: Prime Minister, there has also been a group of pregnant mums<br />
downstairs, stay at home mums who say they have been<br />
disadvantaged by the budget.<br />
PM: No, that is not true. We pay the home child care allowance to women<br />
at home, but we pay support for child care for expenses incurred. In<br />
other words if you have a child or two children in child care we will<br />
refund you about, an upper limit of $ 60 a week. But, you have got to<br />
incur the expense, do you understand. Whereas we pay the home </p>
<p>child care allowance without any expense. We pay that as a right to<br />
women at home therefore that this idea that we are paying twice as<br />
much to women with children in child care as we pay to women at<br />
home is just not true because the payment to the women at home is<br />
not in satisfaction of any expense. The other payment is the payment<br />
in satisfaction of the expense. So, if you have one child in child care<br />
you get $ 30 support from the Commonwealth, but you have got to have<br />
the expense. But, if you are at home with children, you get the<br />
regardless of the expense.<br />
J: inaudible<br />
PM: But, it is not just pregnant mothers. It is mothers who have a<br />
particularly ideological view of the world and we are the only party<br />
supporting through the home child care allowance and the parenting<br />
allowance direct payments to women and they are getting those<br />
payments, but so too are women who have the expense of child care.<br />
J: Mr Keating, did you make that call complaining about<br />
PM: No, I said the answer to that is no.<br />
J: But did you complain?<br />
PM: Look, the inventions that the Liberal party make up are just<br />
unbelievable. Go and ask them what Mr Connolly has got to think<br />
about Mr Nelson. I made the point yesterday, the Liberal party is like a<br />
club, you join at the door, if you want a safe seat they just let you in.<br />
And Mr Nelson's great claim to fame, Dr Nelson, was that he was in<br />
the Labor party for 17 years and there was that letter in today's press<br />
which I thought was quite interesting that came from John Valder who<br />
was a former President of the Liberal party saying, It is not every<br />
day the Liberal party preselection winner has proclaimed, by loudhailer,<br />
no less, that he has never voted Liberal in his life only to turn<br />
around and say that was just a convenient lie at the time. Help! One<br />
thing I thought Liberal party MPs still had was a bit of personal<br />
integrity. David Connolly may not have known when it was his time to<br />
go, but this is almost enough to make an old Liberal party president<br />
vote Labor'. Signed John Valder. Thank you.<br />
ends </p>
