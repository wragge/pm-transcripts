PRIME MINISTER549<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING, MP<br />
John Fahey and his Government have by their decision to retain the Cahill<br />
Expressw . ay the eyesore that mars the most significant precinct in SYdny--<br />
demonstrated again the unfitness of their stewardship of the fortunes of this<br />
great city.<br />
The Harbour Tunnel provides the first and only opportunity to remove the<br />
expressway and get it down before the Olympics.<br />
The Commonwealth Government offered to help with the expressway<br />
Mr Fahey made the decision without further reference to the Commonwealth.<br />
Mr Fahey and his government are without any vision for Sydney and are run by<br />
the various authorities. The authorities are too strong for the Cabinet.<br />
Obviously the State Rail Authority and the Roads and Traffic Authority have<br />
decided this issue for the government.<br />
Money is deciding another great issue for Sydney. The Fahey government<br />
decision to build a casino in P yrmont will destroy the opportunity to return<br />
Pyrmont to the attractive compass of the city.<br />
The hideous proposal for the casino will be a blot on the landscape of the city<br />
and flies in the face of what the Commonwealth Government is seeking to<br />
achieve with the Better Cities Program for Pyrmont. The fine textured<br />
redevelopment of Pyrmont is to be sacrificed to a budget subvention and an<br />
architectural proposal dominated by lowest common denominator guidelines.<br />
Between the activities of the State government in its quest for money and the<br />
Roads and Traffic Authority, Pyrmont is being destroyed.<br />
By the time Sydney gets an Olympic's Chief there will be no opportunity left to<br />
bring Sydney up to the potential of its beauty for the world to see in the year<br />
2000. Sydney is in the hands of a government focused solely on money without the<br />
slightest idea of the vision and sense of grandeur that Sydney now needs.<br />
God help Sydney because John Fahey and his government won't.<br />
