<p>Good morning,</p>
<p>Australian action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions since 1990, led by my government, will prevent about 87 million tonnes of climate changing carbon a year entering the atmosphere by 2010.</p>
<p>That's a massive reduction and a tangible example of the Coalition's commitment to the climate change challenge.</p>
<p>Today I am announcing a further $627 million in practical new measures to tackle global warming, bringing total spending on climate change initiative since 1996 to about $3.4 billion. </p>
<p>This will include $336 million for green vouchers for schools to improve energy and water efficiency.</p>
<p>Every school in Australia will be eligible for a voucher of up $50,000 to help install solar hot water systems and rainwater tanks.</p>
<p>Not only will this help reduce energy and conserve water, but it will provide students and our school communities with a first-hand lesson in how we can act locally to preserve the environment.</p>
<p>I will also be announcing a 'cap and trade' emissions trading system that will help Australia substantially lower our domestic greenhouse gas emissions at the lowest cost.</p>
<p>Stabilising atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases will be difficult, but not impossible. We do not have to sacrifice our economic prosperity to tackle the problem.</p>
<p>Australia will more than play its part to address climate change, but we will do it in a practical and balanced way, in full knowledge of the economic consequences for our nation.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>  Australia's Climate Change Policy - our economy, our environment, our future</p>
