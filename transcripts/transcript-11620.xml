    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE...................................................................................................</p>
<p>Thank you very much Tony, and to the Mayor, Gerry Peacocke, ladies and</p>
<p> gentlemen.</p>
<p>As Tony said I am on a week long visit to rural and regional areas of</p>
<p> Australia although I have to confess that I took a few hours off last</p>
<p> night to fly back to Melbourne to participate in the inaugural Allan Border</p>
<p> Medal Dinner but I am sure I will absolve myself from any sort of (inaudible)</p>
<p> in conduct in relation to that by telling this audience that the recipient</p>
<p> of the honour, of course, is a Narromine boy, Glenn McGrath. So that,</p>
<p> sort of, completely excuses any culpable behaviour or any suggestion that</p>
<p> I was resting on my oars or taking it easy.</p>
<p>But it is a valuable way of spending, if I can put it in this fashion,</p>
<p> prime ministerial time. There is no substitute for coming out to the bush,</p>
<p> to regional areas of Australia and actually talking face-to-face to understand</p>
<p> both the challenges and the opportunities to be reminded of the difficulty</p>
<p> that low commodity prices imposes on wool growers. To be reminded of how</p>
<p> important basic government services, be they Commonwealth or State, are</p>
<p> to rural communities. I have made some remarks about government services</p>
<p> and I want to make the point to you today that we are not only concerned</p>
<p> to ensure that there is no further reduction in Commonwealth Government</p>
<p> services affecting the country areas of Australia yet we are also anxious</p>
<p> where possible to rebuild the service levels and create some new service</p>
<p> levels.</p>
<p>For example, one of the beneficial offshoots of the new employment network</p>
<p> system criticised by some but, in fact, delivering 50 per cent better</p>
<p> outcomes than the old Commonwealth employment service. One of the beneficiaries</p>
<p> of that new system is, in fact, the regional area of Australia because</p>
<p> the latest tender round produced 50 per cent more providers in regional</p>
<p> Australia and indeed provided the 300 call centres throughout regional</p>
<p> Australia provided where they didn't exist before.</p>
<p>So we are not only in the business of trying to maintain existing service</p>
<p> levels but we recognise that we have an obligation to try and rebuild</p>
<p> some others. Now, I don't pretend for a moment that we can control</p>
<p> commodity prices, I don't pretend for a moment that we can control</p>
<p> the vagaries of world trade as they affect people but we can have an influence</p>
<p> on the overall economic climate. And I believe that over the last three</p>
<p> or four years we can legitimately claim to have got the national economy</p>
<p> performing better than it was.</p>
<p>That doesn't mean it's perfect, it doesn't mean that the</p>
<p> benefit of that national economic strength is being evenly shared around</p>
<p> the country. And one of our obligations is to try and ensure that once</p>
<p> again as far as reasonable those benefits are fairly shared around Australia.</p>
<p> But we have been successful in getting the economy going better, we have</p>
<p> been willing to embrace change and reform that we think will be beneficial.</p>
<p>And, of course, that leads me inevitably and properly to the issue of</p>
<p> taxation reform. Taxation reform, the new tax system starts on the 1st</p>
<p> of July. It is an aggregate and fundamental change for the better to our</p>
<p> taxation system. It will provide, can I say perhaps first and foremost</p>
<p> to a rural audience, it will provide significantly cheaper fuel than applies</p>
<p> under the present dispensation. It will provide effectively lower export</p>
<p> costs and it will provide lower business operating costs all around. It</p>
<p> will provide a $12 billion personal tax cut, it will include adjustments</p>
<p> for pensions and benefits and other additional compensation for self-funded</p>
<p> retirees. The business tax part will provide a reduction by approximately</p>
<p> one half in the level of capital gains tax and will contain also reductions</p>
<p> in business tax.</p>
<p>Now, of course, the focus is on the GST, that is inevitable and easy</p>
<p> for those who seek to destroy tax reform but it is only part of a whole.</p>
<p> And we'll be regaled with stories between now and the 30th</p>
<p> of June and beyond on the GST on this or that item. Now, of course, if</p>
<p> you want to be negative you can run that sort of campaign and we'll</p>
<p> reply, we'll respond, we'll deal with people's queries,</p>
<p> we'll acknowledge that our original idea was not to have any exemptions</p>
<p> effectively but the only way we could get it through the Parliament was</p>
<p> to accept the changes that were sought by the Australian Democrats. We</p>
<p> had no alternative. That was not our original idea. But it was better</p>
<p> to get 85 to 90 per cent of the reforms than to let the whole thing go.</p>
<p> And that was the pragmatic, sensible judgement that we made.</p>
<p>But I predict now there'll be plenty of talk about individual items</p>
<p> and there'll be an attempt particularity in the tabloid newspapers</p>
<p> to run a scare story a day. But in the end what we are about is trying</p>
<p> to produce a tax system that is beneficial to the whole country. And there's</p>
<p> really not much point in being in Government, there's not much point</p>
<p> being Prime Minister unless you are willing to do things that you believe</p>
<p> are good for the whole country.</p>
<p>And having a better tax system will not only over time, but I believe</p>
<p> over a relatively short period of time begin to produce a real improvement</p>
<p> to the dividend. And that's why we ran to the last election with</p>
<p> it. There was a lot of pain involved in that. It was difficult and we</p>
<p> are going to be subject to easy criticisms from the Labor Party and from</p>
<p> others but we are going to continue to persevere because we think it is</p>
<p> in the long-term interest of Australia. And I know that there are many</p>
<p> people around Australia who share our commitment to the cause of taxation</p>
<p> reform. But I am certainly absolutely convinced that it is going to be</p>
<p> of enormous benefit to rural Australia.</p>
<p>And we recognise there are transitional challenges and we want to work</p>
<p> with people, provide information and facilitate the resolution of any</p>
<p> of the questions and problems that arise as a result of that.</p>
<p>There are many other things that I could talk about but I think one of</p>
<p> the values at a gathering like this and I want to have the opportunity</p>
<p> after this gathering of going for a bit of a streetwalk and saying hello</p>
<p> in an impromptu fashion to some of the shopkeepers and others. And then</p>
<p> I have got an interview with Statewide and then Gerry's got</p>
<p> one or two things he wants to say to me in his normal retiring unassuming</p>
<p> style and give me a few ideas and then I'm off to the Tweed to continue</p>
<p> the journey.</p>
<p>The last thing I want to say is that I have found it very encouraging</p>
<p> in the past few days that every community I have visited that I have been</p>
<p> able to meet a cross-section of people. I said at a local news conference</p>
<p> today when I was asked why I hadn't met a particular group or a particular</p>
<p> person I said I haven't sought to meet individual groups, what I</p>
<p> have sought to do is to meet a cross-section of the community and not</p>
<p> just get a particular point of view. And I am very pleased to have been</p>
<p> able to meet aboriginal leaders, leaders of the farm communities, leaders</p>
<p> of the business community as well as the elected representatives. And</p>
<p> it's very important that we see our challenges particularly in regional</p>
<p> Australia as being community challenges and not a question of sort of</p>
<p> bargaining a slice of the action between this or that different interest</p>
<p> group. Because in the end we solve problems as a nation by working together</p>
<p> and in the end we solve problems of the community by working together.</p>
<p> And I've certainly seen in Bourke which has had its share of difficulties</p>
<p> over the last decade or so I saw a spirit of communitarianism and a spirit</p>
<p> of cooperation amongst communities which was extremely encouraging.</p>
<p>Finally, can I say I always enjoy getting out of Canberra and Sydney</p>
<p> and going around the regions. This is not the first time I have undertaken</p>
<p> a prolonged visit to regional Australia, it certainly won't be the</p>
<p> last time.</p>
<p>I know that there are difficulties. I understand the reason why people</p>
<p> want a fair share. I know that people have been hurt through no fault</p>
<p> of their own and I feel very deeply for people who through from generation</p>
<p> to generation have produced the export wealth of this nation that have</p>
<p> now found it very, very difficult.</p>
<p>I can't promise that we can solve all of their difficulties, I can</p>
<p> promise that in so far as the Government's behaviour makes things</p>
<p> worse we won't make things worse and where we can make them better</p>
<p> we'll endeavour to do so. I thank you for your courtesy of having</p>
<p> me here. It's great to be back in Dubbo. I commend your new federal</p>
<p> member, Tony Lawler, to you, he's been very energetic and very effective</p>
<p> on your behalf and I am very pleased to be his guest here today and I'd</p>
<p> be very happy to respond to any of your questions. Thank you.</p>
<p>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</p>
<p>QUESTION:</p>
<p>[Inaudible]</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I've just had a very lively discussion, not a deep discussion, but</p>
<p> a very lively discussion about that. The principle is that it applies</p>
<p> to livestock but not something for human consumption. Now, the proposition</p>
<p> was put to me about, you know, the price is determined at the time of</p>
<p> the dead weight but I was making the point that the contract is formed</p>
<p> when the stock is sold. And when the stock is sold it's not dead</p>
<p> weight.</p>
<p>QUESTION:</p>
<p>[Inaudible]</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>On the basis of that the saleyard should not be concerned but I have</p>
<p> arranged for the Chairman of our Tax Advisory Board, Chris Jordan, to</p>
<p> be in touch with the NSW stock and station agents this afternoon I hope</p>
<p> or tomorrow morning and if, you know, I'll be chased out of town</p>
<p> if I am wrong.</p>
<p>QUESTION:</p>
<p>[Inaudible]</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, but that's a form of income is it? The income is not subject</p>
<p> to the GST.</p>
<p>QUESTION:</p>
<p>[Inaudible]</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>But if you are paying somebody, if it's some type of...</p>
<p>QUESTION:</p>
<p>[Inaudible]</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, that kind of, if the community information centre is a not for</p>
<p> profit organisation that wouldn't be subject, no.</p>
<p>[ends]</p>
