HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES<br />
INCOME TAX BILL 1967<br />
NOTES FOR THE MINISTER'S SECOND READING SPEECH.<br />
This Bill will declare the general rates of tax for the<br />
current financial year 1967-60'.<br />
The rates to be declared do not differ from those that<br />
applied for the preceding financial year. As anniounced in the<br />
Budget Speech, however, there are to be two changes in the income<br />
tax allowance for men aged 65 years or more, and women of 60 years<br />
or more, who are residents of Australia.<br />
One of these changes will increase the exemption levels<br />
of the age allowance by $ 126. This will preserve the long-standing<br />
relationship between the age allowance and the amount represented<br />
by the sum of the full age pension and the maximum other income a<br />
pensioner may receive without affecting his pension entitlement.<br />
Honourable members will recall that the age pension means<br />
test was increased last April by $ 156. Legislation enacted shortly<br />
afterwards increased the amount of the age allowance for 1966/ 67 by<br />
on a simple pro-rata time basis. For 1967/ 68 the allowance is<br />
to be increased by the balance of $ 126. This will mean that the<br />
exemption levels for 1967/ 68 will be $ 1,196 for a single person and<br />
$ 2,106 for a married couple as against $ 1,070 and l, 98O, respectively,<br />
last financial year. A measure of tax relief will continue to be<br />
provided on a range of incomes somewhat in excess of these points.<br />
The new limits for this purpose will be $ 1,451 for single persons and<br />
$ 3,287 for married couples.<br />
The other change in the age allowance will simplify the<br />
way in which it is calculated. For many years the allowance has<br />
been related to an aged person's net income fromall sources, as<br />
distinguished from his taxable income. While this is justifiable<br />
in principle, it has, without the slightest do-ubt, caused a great<br />
deal of misunderstanding of the allowance in the minds of aged<br />
people and complicated not only the preparation of their income tax<br />
returns but also the general administration of the taxation law.<br />
The Commonwealth Committee on Taxation headed by<br />
Sir George Ligertwood recommended that the allowance be simplified<br />
by relating it to taxable income instead of net income and this is<br />
now being done. This change will not only simplify procedures;<br />
it will also enhance the value of the allowance in the numerous<br />
cases where aged persons receive income such as war pensions which<br />
are exempt from tax, or incur medical and other expenses which are<br />
deductible in calculating taxable income.<br />
The technical provisions of the Bill are explained in<br />
greater detail in a memorandum to be circulated for the information<br />
of honourable members and . nothink I need go further into it<br />
at this stage. I commend the Bill to the House. </p>
