M. I. T. E. R. S. GRANT<br />
Cabramatta will benefit from a $ 41,000 grant for<br />
new traffic signals and modifications to channelisation<br />
at the intersection of the Hume Highway and Cabramatta<br />
Road East. The Prime Minister and Member for Werriwa, Mr Gough<br />
Whitlam, announced that the funds would be made availalbe<br />
through the Minor Traffic Engineering and Road Safety<br />
Improvements category of the Roads Grants Act. He said<br />
that it was known that correction of known hazardous<br />
locations was an effective and low-cost method of<br />
improving road safety, and the Cabramatta grant was part<br />
of the Australian Government's comprehensive policy<br />
for the improvement of all aspects of the road transport system,<br />
especially in relation to road safety.<br />
Mr Whitlam said that the Cabramatta grant was part<br />
of the $ 2,600,000 being made available to New South Wales<br />
under MITERS during the current financial year. The<br />
State will receive a total of $ 8,080,000 for such works<br />
over the period 1974/ 75 to 1976/ 77.<br />
