<p>PRESENTER:</p>
<p>Joining us in the studio this morning is the man who can answer</p>
<p>   these questions and more, Prime Minister, John Howard. Mr Howard,</p>
<p>   good morning.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good morning Tracy.</p>
<p>PRESENTER:</p>
<p>Most experts are describing Pauline Hanson's extraordinary</p>
<p>   showing in Queensland as a wake-up call to the major parties. Have</p>
<p>   you heard the call?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>There is a message in it. I think both major parties, and I'll</p>
<p>   speak for the Liberal Party, would be foolish to ignore it. There</p>
<p>   is a battle weariness within the electorate, perhaps with some of</p>
<p>   the tactics of major parties and the ambience of national politics.</p>
<p>   We all should take some heed of that. There are a lot of reasons</p>
<p>   why the Hanson Party did well. The major reason in my view is the</p>
<p>   sense of vulnerability that many people, particularly in regional</p>
<p>   Australia feel at a time of economic and social change and it's</p>
<p>   very easy when you are not in power to come along and say, well</p>
<p>   look I can fix it. But now, interestingly enough that Mrs Hanson's</p>
<p>   Party has won seats, she'll have to be accountable for the</p>
<p>   practical implications of her policies in the same way that I am.</p>
<p>PRESENTER:</p>
<p>You said on Friday that the Queensland election result didn't</p>
<p>   have federal implications but you can't still believe that,</p>
<p>   surely?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I didn't say that. What I said yesterday was that you</p>
<p>   can't automatically do a full translation of State to Federal</p>
<p>   and that is true. You have got to remember that in the last South</p>
<p>   Australian State election, from recollection, the Democrats polled</p>
<p>   between 14 and 16 per cent. So there is some history throughout</p>
<p>   Australia of political parties, minority parties doing well in State</p>
<p>   elections. But I don't want to suggest that there isn't</p>
<p>   something different about what happened on Saturday and I do believe</p>
<p>   that it has to be analysed. But most importantly, now that Mrs Hanson's</p>
<p>   team is on the field, they have to play the game according to the</p>
<p>   same rules as the rest of us and that means that their policies,</p>
<p>   like offering people two per cent interest rates, I mean, who is</p>
<p>   going to lend a bank money at one and a half per cent so it can</p>
<p>   lend at two per cent. I mean it's those sorts of things now</p>
<p>   in my view will come under much greater scrutiny.</p>
<p>PRESENTER:</p>
<p>The fact is that their policies seem to have struck a chord and</p>
<p>   there policies are not necessarily in alignment with yours.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't think so much their policies have struck a chord,</p>
<p>   I think there is a discontent out there and the rhetoric has exploited</p>
<p>   that discontent and now the hard part for the party is ahead and</p>
<p>   that is translating a rhetoric into hard and fast alternatives that</p>
<p>   won't do more damage. They, for example, are against imports.</p>
<p>   Well that's fine, but if you stop other countries sending goods</p>
<p>   to Australia other countries will not take our goods so we will</p>
<p>   end up being worse off as a result of that and I think these sorts</p>
<p>   of things over time will be examined. And the people who followed</p>
<p>   the clarion call on Saturday will start over time to see that there</p>
<p>   are no simple solutions in today's complex world. If there</p>
<p>   had been, I tell you what, politicians before Mrs Hanson would have</p>
<p>   implemented them.</p>
<p>PRESENTER:</p>
<p>Well Mrs Hanson seems to be promising simple solutions and people</p>
<p>   seem to be embracing them. They are also opposed to a GST, they</p>
<p>   are also opposed to the final sell-off of Telstra. Are you going</p>
<p>   to change those policies?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well we're not in favour of a GST on its own. I have never</p>
<p>   been in favour of putting a GST on top of the existing tax system.</p>
<p>   I am in favour of a taxation reform and that, of course, could easily</p>
<p>   involve a GST replacing a whole swag of existing indirect taxes</p>
<p>   and, of course, reductions in personal income taxes.</p>
<p>PRESENTER:</p>
<p>Will you have to back away from that now?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't want to back away and I don't intend to back</p>
<p>   away and I want to make that very clear, from taxation reform. And</p>
<p>   the reason I won't back away from it is that it is good for</p>
<p>   Australia and my responsibility as a political leader is to make</p>
<p>   changes that help the country, not make changes that satisfy some</p>
<p>   kind of ideology.</p>
<p>PRESENTER:</p>
<p>But Australians have voted in Queensland saying that they don't</p>
<p>   believe that this will be good for them. I mean, One Nation has</p>
<p>   campaigned on federal issues predominantly, hasn't it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't think the GST was an issue in the Queensland election.</p>
<p>   I don't remember it being mentioned until Saturday night and</p>
<p>   I followed the election pretty closely.</p>
<p>PRESENTER:</p>
<p>So you are not going to back away from a GST?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I am not going to back away from tax reform. I am certainly not</p>
<p>   going to back away from tax reform. I mean, what is the point of</p>
<p>   being Prime Minister unless you do things that you believe are good</p>
<p>   for the country?</p>
<p>PRESENTER:</p>
<p>If the country doesn't believe it's going to be good</p>
<p>   for it.....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well that is a judgement that is made in the ballot box. I mean</p>
<p>   at the end of the day I accept the verdict of the people. 23 per</p>
<p>   cent of the Queensland electorate voted for One Nation on Saturday</p>
<p>   and they weren't all, as some people have suggested, racist.</p>
<p>   A great bulk of them, as I said some time ago, are ordinary people</p>
<p>   who feel vulnerable and feel adversely affected and think on occasions</p>
<p>   that the bulk of the community has not been, that the major political</p>
<p>   parties have not been listening. Now we all have to take a message</p>
<p>   from that. I am not dismissive of the result, nor am I overwhelmed</p>
<p>   by it. It's a question of giving a sensible, measured, intelligent</p>
<p>   response and that is what I am doing. I mean the last thing I am</p>
<p>   going to do is get knocked off course for things that I believe</p>
<p>   are good for Australia. I mean, once I start doing that I am of</p>
<p>   no use to my Party or to my country. I hold this job in trust for</p>
<p>   the Australian people and I want to use the authority of the office</p>
<p>   to do good things for Australia. Now if the people don't agree</p>
<p>   with me that they are good things well, they'll vote me out,</p>
<p>   that's the way the process works.</p>
<p>PRESENTER:</p>
<p>What about the sell-off of the rest of Telstra?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I believe in that and that's our policy.</p>
<p>PRESENTER:</p>
<p>One Nation doesn't.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well all right, we'll sort of campaign on it. I mean there</p>
<p>   are benefits. If we can complete the sale of Telstra and the men</p>
<p>   and women of Australia own all of it, what we will have is essentially</p>
<p>   a debt free 21st Century. Now surely the people who feel economically</p>
<p>   and socially vulnerable would like Australia to be free of debt</p>
<p>   in the 21st Century. Now that is why we are committed to the sale</p>
<p>   of the remaining two thirds of Telstra and I would say to any of</p>
<p>   Mrs Hanson's supporters who think it's a good thing to</p>
<p>   oppose that, think of the benefit of our country and our children's</p>
<p>   country in the 21st Century being essentially debt free.</p>
<p>PRESENTER:</p>
<p>If you go to a double dissolution on Wik election analysts are</p>
<p>   predicting that One Nation could get three Senate seats in Queensland</p>
<p>   and up to nine Senate seats nationally with a handful of lower house</p>
<p>   seats. Does that frighten you?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I don't believe that would ultimately happen but the</p>
<p>   reason that I contemplate a double dissolution, and I haven't</p>
<p>   decided yet, my position has not changed on that for months, I can</p>
<p>   have a double dissolution if I want to, is that it seems, unless</p>
<p>   the minor parties and the Labor Party change their position in the</p>
<p>   Senate it's the only way I can get the Native Title legislation</p>
<p>   through, through a double dissolution and a joint sitting following</p>
<p>   that double dissolution. So, that's the reason. I mean people,</p>
<p>   including the Labor Party and Senator Harradine and the Australian</p>
<p>   Democrats, don't want One Nation Senators well, they can act</p>
<p>   very decisively and pass our Native Title legislation. I mean, they</p>
<p>   are the people who are holding it up not the Coalition. I mean,</p>
<p>   we have to get this Native Title problem sorted out and let me assure</p>
<p>   the people of rural Australia that I am not going to compromise</p>
<p>   on my Native Title Amendment Bill. I have fought hard for a fair</p>
<p>   plan, I have already compromised, I am not going to compromise any</p>
<p>   further and I am not going to give in to those who really want to</p>
<p>   sell out the interests of the farming community of Australia and</p>
<p>   I won't do that.</p>
<p>PRESENTER:</p>
<p>Are you counting on the notion that the spectre of a double dissolution</p>
<p>   given the Queensland result is probably as frightening to the Labor</p>
<p>   Party and to people like Senator Harradine as it might be to you</p>
<p>   and that they may come to heel now on Wik?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I am not counting on any new notion because my position has</p>
<p>   not altered. It is in Australia's interests, remember to get</p>
<p>   this native title mess cleaned up. There are many projects that</p>
<p>   are held up, there is a lot of uncertainty. There are a lot of new</p>
<p>   jobs that could be generated once the problem is resolved. And it's</p>
<p>   in Australia's interests that we get it resolved, not in my</p>
<p>   interests or the Liberal Party's interests. The reason I am</p>
<p>   amending the Native Title Act is it's in Australia's interests</p>
<p>   and that's why it ought to go through. So in the national interest</p>
<p>   they wouldn't let it go through.</p>
<p>PRESENTER: </p>
<p>But you don't want a double dissolution do you?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p>I want to do what is good for the country and what is good for</p>
<p>   the country is fixing the native title mess and at the moment the</p>
<p>   only way that that can be done is through a joint sitting following</p>
<p>   a double dissolution. I have never set out to have a double dissolution</p>
<p>   a such. I would just like to have a normal three years and have</p>
<p>   a half Senate election and get re-elected and do the same thing</p>
<p>   again, of course. But I am faced with the dilemma that I cannot</p>
<p>   get essential legislation through the Senate despite the fact that</p>
<p>   I have a majority of 44 in the House of Representatives. And part</p>
<p>   of the anger of those people who voted for Hanson on Saturday is</p>
<p>   the sense of frustration that, okay they changed Government after</p>
<p>   13 years of Labor and perhaps things are not changing quickly enough</p>
<p>   for their liking and one of the reasons....</p>
<p>PRESENTER: </p>
<p>Or maybe things are changing too quickly?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p>Well in some cases that is right. In other cases perhaps they had</p>
<p>   the unreal expectation that the world would be overnight better</p>
<p>   as a result of the change of Government. Now there are no simple</p>
<p>   solutions. If there had have been, as I have said before, a politician</p>
<p>   before Mrs Hanson would have implemented them.</p>
<p>PRESENTER:</p>
<p>Will Coalition preferences go to the One Nation Party in a Federal</p>
<p>   poll?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well that'll be decided by our various State branches. My</p>
<p>   suspicion is that there'll be probably some different approaches</p>
<p>   adopted in different parts of the country.</p>
<p>PRESENTER:</p>
<p>What would be your preference?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well that is something that I will be discussing with my State</p>
<p>   organisations over the next few days. I'd rather talk to them</p>
<p>   about that first.</p>
<p>PRESENTER:</p>
<p>Do you accept suggestions that if the Coalition in Queensland had</p>
<p>   not directed preferences to Pauline Hanson then she would probably</p>
<p>   only have picked up three seats?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I think you need to analyse the outcomes a little more closely</p>
<p>   than that. But you've got to remember, Tracy, and I think one</p>
<p>   thing is forgotten in this preference debate is that the great majority</p>
<p>   of, not all, but a significant majority of the people who voted</p>
<p>   for One Nation on Saturday were former Coalition voters. Now my</p>
<p>   responsibility as the head of the Coalition is to talk to those</p>
<p>   people, to listen to them, to point out where I disagree with Mrs</p>
<p>   Hanson and her policies and where those policies would be damaging</p>
<p>   to Australia but ultimately to get those people at future elections</p>
<p>   to vote for the Coalition because many of them are former Coalition</p>
<p>   voters. Now the Labor Party is claiming morality on the preference</p>
<p>   issue. The reasons that the Labor Party decided to put the Hanson</p>
<p>   Party last was that it made the calculation quite correctly, of</p>
<p>   course, that the great bulk of the people who were going to follow</p>
<p>   One Nation were, in fact, Coalition voters. So there's really</p>
<p>   no morality on the part of the Labor Party. If there had been, why</p>
<p>   did they direct preferences to the Australia First Party whose policies</p>
<p>   are the same as One Nation on the sensitive issues like immigration,</p>
<p>   in 12 seats in the Queensland election. If they're really consistent</p>
<p>   they wouldn't have given their preferences to that Party because</p>
<p>   those policies that they despise in One Nation are identically held</p>
<p>   by the Australia First Party.</p>
<p>PRESENTER:</p>
<p>It's probably legitimate in a sense for you to draw the line</p>
<p>   and to say that there would be some sort of crossover in beliefs</p>
<p>   between One Nation supporters and traditional Coalition supporters.....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>In some areas but in other areas, I mean my party, the Liberal</p>
<p>   Party in particular is a party which varies across the country.</p>
<p>   It has elements in rural Australia that would be closer to the views</p>
<p>   of some One Nation supporters but in the cities that would be different</p>
<p>   again. So when you lead a diverse party you have to have a range</p>
<p>   of responses.</p>
<p>PRESENTER:</p>
<p>But you don't want to leave yourself open to the sort of thumping</p>
<p>   that the Coalition took in Queensland do you?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well the way you avoid that is to talk in a civil fashion to the</p>
<p>   people who voted for One Nation. You certainly don't brand</p>
<p>   them with pejorative labels which many people.....</p>
<p>PRESENTER:</p>
<p>Like deranged?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well that was a remark about a section of the speech rather than</p>
<p>   the person and the allegation that I was referring to was the claim</p>
<p>   in the speech that my approach to native title was designed to create</p>
<p>   a separate Aboriginal State in Australia. Well having copped over</p>
<p>   the last two and a quarter years bucket fulls of criticism from</p>
<p>   Aboriginal leaders in Australia I'd have thought I was the</p>
<p>   last politician who could be legitimately accused of trying to establish</p>
<p>   an Aboriginal state in Australia.</p>
<p>PRESENTER:</p>
<p>Okay, Prime Minister, thank you for your time.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It's a pleasure.</p>
<p>ENDS</p>
