    <content><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and Member for Braddon Sid Sidebottom today announced the 23rd Community Cabinet meeting would be held in Burnie next month.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister said the May meeting would be a great opportunity for members of the local community to meet directly with their government leaders.</p>
<p>"Community Cabinet is my commitment to ensure close consultation with the Australian people on the things that concern them at a national level and at a local level," Mr Rudd said.</p>
<p>"I would really like to encourage all people living in the North West and West Coasts to come along and utilise this opportunity to meet directly with the Australian Government and put forward your ideas or ask us questions.</p>
<p>"My Ministry and I look forward to hearing from people of the region when we visit in May."</p>
<p>Mr Sidebottom said this was a wonderful opportunity to talk directly with the Prime Minister and the cabinet about the issues of importance for the region.</p>
<p>"I'm delighted to welcome Community Cabinet to Burnie for the first time," he said.</p>
<p>"The evening begins with a Welcome to Country and the National Anthem, followed by a public forum, then one-one-one meetings with individuals or groups.</p>
<p>"I encourage all members of my local community with issues they want to raise with the Rudd Ministry to register for this event."</p>
<p>Mr Sidebottom also said the occasion would be an historic first.</p>
<p>"For the first time our region will have the ear of the whole Australian Government."</p>
<p>"This is the third Community Cabinet the Rudd Government has held in Tasmania and it's an honour for our area to be chosen."</p>
<p>"From prior experience at other Community Cabinets, the places fill up fast - so I urge people to get in quickly when registration opens up to avoid disappointment," said Mr Sidebottom.</p>
<p>The meeting starts with a public forum which involves a question and answer session between attendees and Rudd Government Cabinet Ministers. </p>
<p>Following the forum, there is an opportunity for people to request a private meeting with a Minister.</p>
<p>Further details will be released in coming days about how to register to attend Community Cabinet.</p>
<p>Community Cabinet meetings occur every four to five weeks in metropolitan and regional Australia and are proving popular with communities who enjoy the opportunity to meet with, hear from and ask questions of their government.</p>
<p>To date, more than 10,000 people have attended Community Cabinet meetings around the country. From communities such as Yirrkala in the Northern Territory's East Arnhem Land to Campbelltown in Sydney's west - Community Cabinet meetings have become an integral way in which the Rudd Government communicates with communities around the nation.</p>
<p>Additionally, over 1,200 Australians have had an opportunity to meet with their Prime Minister or a Cabinet minister to discuss topics of their choice. The Rudd Government takes seriously its opportunity to meet with constituents.</p>
