STATE AND NORTHERN TERRITORY OFFSHORE POWERS TO BE PROCLAIMED<br />
The Coastal Waters ( State Powers) Act 1980, the Coastal Waters<br />
( Northern Territory Powers) Act 1980 and the -Seas and Submerged<br />
Lands Amendment Act 1.980 are to be proclaimed to come into<br />
operation on 1 January 1982.<br />
This step follows the introduction by all the States and the<br />
Northern Territory of complementary legislation to implement<br />
the Offshore Constitutional Settlement agreed at the Premiers<br />
Conference in June 1979.<br />
The Offshore Settlement followed on the High Court's decision<br />
in the Seas and Submerged Lands Case in 1.915, which upheld<br />
the sovereign rights and the sovereignty of the Commonwealth,<br />
not only over the'continental shelf, but also over the<br />
territorial sea.<br />
As I noted when introducing the Bill into the Commonwealth<br />
Parliament in April 1980, the State Powers Act is the<br />
cornerstone of the Offshore Settlement. It provides for the<br />
extension of State legislative powers in the territorial sea.<br />
The Northern Territory is being treated as a State for<br />
these purposes. The amendments made by the Seas and Submerged<br />
Lands Amendment Act are consequential on the Powers Acts.<br />
The Acts have been passed by the Commonwealth on the basis<br />
that the territorial sea is an area which has traditionally been<br />
a State responsibility and is best left for local jurisdiction<br />
except on matters of over-riding national or international<br />
importance.<br />
For instance, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act will<br />
continue to apply throughout the Great Barrier Reef Region<br />
and traditional Commonwealth legislation such as Customs<br />
legislation will, of course, still remain in force in the<br />
territorial sea.<br />
The complementary State legislation is to give effect to the<br />
new fisheries and petroleum arrangements that are to apply<br />
in the offshore area, both within and beyond the territorial<br />
sea. These arrangements include the establishment by<br />
Commonwealth legislation of joint Commonwealth/ State<br />
authorities for some purposes. / 2 </p>
<p>2-<br />
Commonwealth fisheries and petroleum legislation has already<br />
been passed. All States and the Northern Territory have<br />
introduced complementary legislation.<br />
When the Powers Acts come into operation on 1 January 1982,<br />
State and Northern Territory Parliaments can proceed to complete<br />
the passage of their fisheries and petroletun legislation.<br />
The Commonwealth Government hopes that the final step in<br />
implementing the basic elements of the Offshore Settlement<br />
would follow shortly after.. ards. This will involve proclaiming<br />
the Coastal Waters ( State Title) Act 1.980 and the Coastal<br />
Waters ( Northern Territory Title) Act 1980 and the commencement--<br />
of the new fisheries and petroleum arrangements. The Tit]. e<br />
Acts will give the States and the Nori-Jhern Territory title to<br />
the seabed in the territorial sea in accordance with the terms<br />
laid down in the Acts.<br />
The Commonwealth has also passed other legislation as part of the<br />
offshore package, including legislation for offshore minerals<br />
other than petroleum and for the protection of the sea from ship<br />
sourced pollution and dumping. The States and Northern Territory<br />
have complementary legislation in trai. n. It i s hoped that<br />
this legislation will be in place also at an early date. </p>
