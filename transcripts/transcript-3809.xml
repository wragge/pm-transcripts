P RI M IF. MNST Press Statement No. 527<br />
I. July 1975<br />
ADMINISTRATIVE ARRANGEMENTS<br />
The Prime Minister today announced that a revised<br />
Administrative Arrangements Order had been approved by the<br />
Executive Council this morning.<br />
The order incorporates new legislation passed during<br />
the recent sittings of Parliament and brings up to date the<br />
citations of Acts which were amended during those sittings.<br />
The Order also consolidates the variou s amendments<br />
which have been approved and gazetted since the last<br />
consolidated Order was issued on 10 February 1975.<br />
These amendments include those made on 6 June last<br />
concerning the minerals and solar energy research activities<br />
of the C. S. I. R. O. The Prime Minister said that he wished to<br />
make it clear that the fact that the Minister for Minerals<br />
and Energy was responsible for those aspects of the C. S. I. R. O.' s<br />
research work did not entail the transfer of the C. S. I. R. O. staff<br />
S concerned to the Public Service. These staff would remain<br />
employed under the Science and Industry Research Act, and<br />
it is not proposed that they should be transferred.<br />
S Both the Postal Commission and the Telecommunications<br />
Commission commence full-scale operations today. These two<br />
separate statutory commissions are . responsible to the<br />
Postmaster-General, Senator R. Bishop, and have taken over<br />
almost all of the functions previously exercised by the<br />
Postmaster-General's Department, which will be responsible to<br />
the Postmaster-General.<br />
The consolidated Order also includes some other changes<br />
which have been in the course of preparation for some time as<br />
a result of decisions and actions previously taken, particularly<br />
as a result of the abolition'' in 1974 of the Department of<br />
Supply. A number of functions of-the Department of Manufacturing<br />
Industry ( which absorbed many of the functions of the former<br />
Department of Supply) have been reallocated.<br />
As previously announced on 1 July 1974 administrative<br />
control of the'Research and Development Division of that<br />
Department, and the associated Government establishments concerned<br />
with defence science, were transferred to the Minister and<br />
Department of Defence. The transfer of control was formally<br />
effected under the order approved today. / 2 </p>

The Go% 7ernment has also previously announced the transfer<br />
of the purc I and disposals function from the Department<br />
of Manufacturing Industry. The purchasing and disposals<br />
function has today been transferred to the Department of<br />
Services and Property, which already has responsibility for<br />
Australian Government purchasing policy. The Stores and<br />
Transport function has also been transferred to the Department<br />
of Services and Property.<br />
The other functions of the Department of Manufacturing<br />
Industry which the Government has decided are more<br />
appropriately located within other departments are Defence Aid,<br />
Defence Standardisation, the Defence Printing Establishment<br />
and the Guided~ Weapons and Electronics Support Facility all of<br />
which ha re bs en transferred to the Department of Defence.<br />
The Prime Minister also said that the Patent, Trade<br />
Marks and Designs Offices had been transferred from the<br />
administration of the Minister for Science and Consumer Affairs<br />
to the Attorney-General.<br />
