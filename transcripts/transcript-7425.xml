    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong> 4 November 1988</strong></p>
<p>I have today taken action under the Public Service Act to recommend to the Governor General the unattachment of Mr Charles Perkins, AO from his position of Secretary of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs.</p>
<p>I very much regret the need to take this action. Charles Perkins has dedicated many years of his life to the advancement of the Aboriginal people.</p>
<p>It has become clear that the Minister, Mr Gerry Hand, no longer enjoys a basis of confidence in the Secretary of his Department. In these circumstances it is no longer possible for Mr Perkins to continue in his post. </p>
