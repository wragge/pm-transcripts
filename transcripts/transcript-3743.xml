NOTES FOR THE PRIME MINISTER,<br />
ON THE OPENING OF LACHLAN VINTAGE VILLAGE,<br />
FORBES, N. SXW 17 MAY 1975<br />
1. SOMEONE HAS GOT THE IDEA THAT I'M INTERESTED IN<br />
HISTORIC SITES AND OLD RUINS, THESE ARE THE BEST<br />
SIMULATED RUINS I'VE SEEN IN AUSTRALIA, AFTER MY<br />
LAST VISIT To EUROPE, I OPENED OLD SYDNEY TOWN AT<br />
GoSFORD; AFTER MY. VISIT TO. JAMAICA I'M OPENING<br />
LACHLAN VINTAGE VILLAGE.<br />
2. I'M SORRY THERE AREN'T MORE STATE GOVERNMENT MINISTERS<br />
AT THIS OPENING CEREMONY; AT LEAST ONE STATE MINISTER<br />
DECIDED TO BOYCOTT THE OCCASION. ISUPPOSE THE<br />
STATES ARE USED TO LIVING IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY<br />
ANYWAY. BOB HAWKE WANTED TO COME.. HE THOUGHT A<br />
VINTAGE VILLAGE HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH WINE TASTING.<br />
3. THIS IS OUR BIGGEST TOWN PLANNING PROJECT SINCE<br />
ALBURY-WODONGA. TOME UREN IS COMPLAINING THAT WE ARE<br />
BUILDING MORE OLD TOWNS THAN NEW ONES.<br />
1 MUST CONFESS THAT WHEN I WAS INVITED TO OPEN<br />
" AUSTRALIA'S LIVING MUSEUM" I IMMEDIATELY THOUGHT OF<br />
THE SENATE. I KNOW BEN HALL CAME FROM FORBES, BUT<br />
THERE ARE QUITE A FEW BUSHRANGERS IN MY OWN<br />
PROFESSION. </p>
<p>CERTAINLY THE PEOPLE OF FORBES AND ALL AUSTRALIANS<br />
CAN BE PROUD OF THIS SPLENDID AND IMAGINATIVE PROJECT,<br />
IT WILL BRING GREAT DELIGHT TO TOURISTS, THE<br />
COLONIAL HISTORY OF NEW SOUTH WALES IS RICH IN<br />
INCIDENT AND ADVENTURE, THE OLD LACHLAN DIGGINGS,<br />
THE ORIGINS OF AUSTRALIAN AGRICULTURE AND THE<br />
DEVELOPMENT OF RURAL TRANSPORT HAVE ALL BEEN<br />
PAINSTAKINGLY RECREATED IN THIS DISPLAY, THE RESULT<br />
IS A TRIBUTE TO THE SKILL OF BUILDERS, DESIGNERS,<br />
WORKMEN, CRAFTSMEN AND TECHNICIANS OF THE DISTRICT,<br />
6, THE COMPLETED VILLAGE WILL CONSIST OF 30 TO 40 HOUSES<br />
MUSEUMS, PUBLIC BUILDINGS, SHOPS, BANKS INSURANCE<br />
OFFICES, PERHAPS? IF COUNTRY PARTY MINISTERS WON'T<br />
ATTEND AT LEAST THE AiMYLP, SHOULD BE HERE,<br />
7, THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT HAS CONTRIBUTED $ 100,000<br />
TO THIS PROJECT, IN ADDITION THE GOVERNMENT HAS<br />
CONTRIBUTED $ 105,504 TO THE SCHEME THROUGH<br />
GRANTS UNDER THE REDS SCHEME, THEREBY PROVIDING<br />
ADDITONAL WORK IN THE FORBES DISTRICT,<br />
8, I WISH THIS PROJECT EVERY SUCCESS, I KNOW IT WILL<br />
ATTRACT MANY THOUSANDS OF VISITORS AND MAKE AN<br />
IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTION TO THE ECONOMY AND PROSPERITY<br />
OF THIS DISTRICT, IT WILL ALSO PRESERVE AN AUTHENTIC<br />
FOLK TRADITION AND REMIND US OF THE ARCHITECTURE,<br />
THE TRADITIONS AND THE LIFE-STYLES OF AN EARLIER<br />
AGE, </p>
