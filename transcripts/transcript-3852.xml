GOVERNMENT AIR TRAVEL<br />
The Prime Minister announced today the<br />
Government's decision that as a special measure of expenditure<br />
restraint persons travelling at Government expense on internal<br />
domestic airlines will, in future do so at economy class rates.<br />
This decision will apply to Senators and Members of<br />
Parliament, members of the Australian Public Service, members<br />
of Australian Government Statutory and non-Statutory bodies<br />
and members of the Defence Forces. This decision will take<br />
effect from 1 September 1975.<br />
The Prime Minister said that the announcement was<br />
being made at this stage to enable the appropriate<br />
Australian Government bodies and the airlines to make the<br />
required administrative arrangements ahead of the formal<br />
implementation of the Government's decision. The Prime Minister<br />
stressed that until the decision was implemented, the Government<br />
expected all persons covered by the decision to observe its<br />
spirit by travelling economy class.<br />
