EMBARGO: 8.50 p. m. THURSDAY 16 OCTOBER PARTY TV INTERVIEW NO. 2<br />
1969 FEDERAL ELECTION.<br />
TELEVISION INTERVIEW GIVEN BY THE PRIME<br />
MINISTER, MR. JOHN GORTON, OVER ABC<br />
TELEVISION NETWORK<br />
Interviewer: Mr. George Wilson 16 OCTOBER 1969<br />
Q. Mr. Prime Minister, there has been a lot of rattling<br />
and roaring about this Naval Base at Cockburn Sound. Even Mr.<br />
Caiwell, the former Opposition Leader has said the Labor Party would<br />
have built it ten years ago. Is the building of this Naval Base a real<br />
election issue or a part of the defence mechanism of this country?<br />
PM. It's part of the defence mechanism of this country, but<br />
it wouldn't have been ten years ago. We have now reached a stage<br />
where our fleet is growing, and we have also reached a stage where<br />
the British are withdrawing from the Indian Ocean, and it is therefore<br />
time to begin to construct a base in Western Australia. It will take<br />
some years to complete it but, clearly, in the new situation in which<br />
we find ourselves, in the growth to which we can look forward, this<br />
will be a necessity and therefore this will be started. We set up<br />
consultants, Maunsell Partners, a couple of years ago to advise<br />
us on this, and the report has been with Navy and Defence and the<br />
recommendation is that this should happen. We agree with the<br />
recommendation. I don't know whether it is an election issue because<br />
I haven't heard any indication from the Labor Party that they would<br />
build such a base. They have spoken of " maritime facilities"<br />
Q. Well, so much for the Naval Base. Can we talk about<br />
Vietnam?<br />
PM. Sure.<br />
Q. According to your policy speech you are now prepared<br />
to admit for the first time that if America continues to withdraw troops<br />
from Vietnam, then Australia also will phase down its involvement?<br />
PM. I don't know that I would phrase it that way: " I am<br />
prepared to admit for the first time", but quite clearly and I have<br />
stated this if there were to be a continuing programme of United<br />
States withdrawal, if they were to have a plan that there would be so<br />
many troops getting out in such and such a time, and others at another<br />
9 / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
time and so on, and that were to be implemented, then we wouldn't<br />
stay there until last. We would expect to be phased In to such a<br />
withdrawal plan and at a stage which would be the subject of discussion<br />
between us. But we wouldn't unilaterally withdraw just by ourselves<br />
and leave the United States and South Vietnamese in the lurch. We<br />
would, if such an eventuality as I have spoken of occurred and I<br />
don't think it will, but if it did, if there were such contingency plans<br />
then we would expect to be phased into them, and indeed, we would<br />
see that we were phased into them.<br />
Q. These taxation reforms in your policy speech has<br />
the Federal Treasurer, Mr. McMahon, been a party to discussion<br />
about taxation reforms?<br />
PM. Oh, yes, he has been in fact he has been speaking<br />
about them quite frequently around the country, about the need for<br />
trying to do something about the inequities which have developed in<br />
the taxation law. One of the first things I did when I became Prime<br />
Minister was to ask him to look into this and ask the Treasury to look<br />
into this. It is a very very complex matter.<br />
Q. We will come back to your record as a government in<br />
a moment, if we may. But you are virtually offering a dollar a week<br />
to the lower and middle income wage-earners during the life of the<br />
next Parliament, providing, of course, your Government gets back in.<br />
PM. Oh, I don't think you can work it out that way. I<br />
wouldn't work it out that way.<br />
Q. Well, in your policy speech you have said you are<br />
prepared to give $ 200 million back to Australians in taxation concessions,<br />
on a year by year basis, admittedly, during the life of that next<br />
Parliament. Well, with a workforce of 2 million people in Australia,<br />
perhaps in this category of lower to middle income group earners,<br />
this is going to work out between $ 1 and $ 2 a head.<br />
PM. No, this would only work out that way if everybody were<br />
earning the same income and everybody got the same tax rebates and<br />
so on, and they don't. Rates are different for different classes of<br />
income and the whole matter would be far too complex to try and say<br />
it would be a dollar a week for everybody. It would be relief for<br />
everybody. But at this stage, and until studies are completed, you....<br />
I would like to agree with what you suggest, but I am afraid I couldn't.<br />
Q. Any taxation concessions that come, they would not be<br />
until the Government brought down its next Budget?<br />
PM. They would be starting in the next Budget, yes. 9 / 3 </p>
<p>3-<br />
Q. I see. Right. Is the Government really offering<br />
substantial benefits for pensioners? After all, the Labor Party,<br />
with its policy speech a couple of weeks back, offered a dollar a week<br />
rise to pensioners.<br />
PM. We have given it is not a matter of promising we<br />
have given very substantial assistance to pensioners of all kinds.<br />
Indeed in the last two Budgets, which is just a little over a year, the<br />
base rate pension has been raised by a total of This we have<br />
already done and this is old age pensions I am talking of. And we<br />
have paid particular attention to widows with children and to the<br />
handicapped. We have given a whole range of very, very significant<br />
benefits and we have brought in the tapered means test which is an<br />
incentive to thrift, so that people just don't get cut out of a pension<br />
altogether because they have got some kind of superannutation income.<br />
So this we have already done. What we think is that what we have done<br />
will be accepted by the Australian people as an earnest of what we<br />
propose to do as soon as it is responsible to do so. We want to see<br />
that the benefits they get are real benefits and not illusory.<br />
Q. And you have singled out organisations, such as the<br />
Meals on Wheels organisation, to give Government aid to?<br />
PM. Well, we think this is a very, very good, voluntary<br />
organisation, and that its expansion would be of benefit to people<br />
they serve and to the organisations themselves.<br />
Q. Mr. Prime Minister, country viewers who saw your<br />
policy speech on television, will be interested to know that you are<br />
going to find $ 100 million over five years to help water some of<br />
Australia's distant farms. Would you like to expand on this one?<br />
PM. Yes, it's not merely f inding water for.. it's not<br />
merely conserving water in dams. The money is to be made available<br />
for conservation of water, yes, but also for flood prevention and<br />
mitigation, which is quite an important matter in various parts of<br />
Australia. And it is also to be available for surveying our underground<br />
water resources, so that we may have a much better idea of where<br />
artesian water is and what quantity we have got and what opportunities<br />
for development it will give to us. Water is one of the major factors<br />
limiting the growth of Australia and this is why we have made a<br />
significant attack on it.<br />
Q. The name of Chips Rafferty is probably one that is<br />
known to perhaps every person that is watching this telecast this<br />
evening.<br />
PM. It's known to me, yes. / 4 </p>
<p>4-<br />
Q. Chips Rafferty has been urging the Government for<br />
several years to try and find some sort of subsidy for the production<br />
of Australian films and Australian television. Now I understand that<br />
you would like to do something about this?<br />
PM. Well, we would like to do something about it and we<br />
are going to do something about it. We are proposing to set up a<br />
corporation which will invest in films with a significant Australian<br />
content, made in Australia, or lend money to the producers of such<br />
films. It will have an initial capital of $ 1 million and it will have that<br />
capital replenished so that at the beginning of each year it would still<br />
have $ 1 million. And the profits which we hope it will make, and<br />
the returns we hope it will get from its successful films would then<br />
be paid to it in the hope that it would be able to be self-supporting<br />
after a while.<br />
Q. Well, let's ask you a curly one for the last one. You<br />
have talked about an 8. 7 per cent growth in the economy. You have<br />
talked about a record number of houses being built by your Government.<br />
You have talked about more migrants more this and more that.<br />
Well, do you want to go to the public on your record, or do you want<br />
to go to the public on what you propose to do for the benefit of Australia?<br />
PM. I think we would like to do three things. We would like<br />
to go to the public on our record, on our record of achievements which<br />
is really quite great; on the preservation of the present state of the<br />
economy, the preservation of the present prosperity; the avoidance<br />
of inflation; the continuance of growth and immigration and all<br />
those things of which you spoke. In other words on our record, on<br />
the results our record has achieved, and also on the new proposals<br />
which we are making for the future and which we are sure we can keep<br />
without inflation, or without increasing taxation. The new proposals<br />
you've mentioned some of them the relief in income tax, for example,<br />
bringing Australia into the atomic age, paying particular attention to<br />
the children's needs and needy families, continuing on those paths, but<br />
retaining the present full employment and state of economy we have<br />
got.<br />
Q. Thank you very much for answering these questions<br />
tonight, Mr. Prime Minister. </p>
