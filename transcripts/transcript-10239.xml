13 February 1997 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
PRESS CONFERENCE PARLIAMENT HOUSE<br />
E 0<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to announce that I've appointed Senator Chris Ellison, a<br />
Senator from Western Australia, to replace Senator Bob Woods as Parliamentary<br />
Secretary to the Minister for Health, Senator Ellison will also assist the Attorney-<br />
General and Minister for Justice in certain selected areas.<br />
He's been a Western Australian Senator since 1993. He played a particularly active<br />
role on behalf of the then opposition in the debate on the then government's native title<br />
legislation in ' 93. 1 think he'll do a very energetic and effective way a job in his new<br />
responsibilities and I congratulate him.<br />
Can I also say that the employment figures today are pleasing although in accordance<br />
with my past practice, irrespective of how the figures have gone, I'm not reading too<br />
much into one months' figures, but it does mean that we've had an employment<br />
growth of 158 000 since the election of the Government in March of last year. The<br />
unemployment rate remains the same because the participation rate has risen. But a<br />
rise predominantly in the female part-time area of close to 35 000 jobs in the month is<br />
pleasing. I don't want to put it any higher than that. But it is pleasing and obviously<br />
more welcome than if the trends had been or the direction had been otherwise. And I<br />
think the trend in the employment growth and unemployment is the trend growth<br />
gives some cause for optimism but I have never sought to overstate these figures and I<br />
don't overstate them today. But it's fair to note the rise and to note that that is a<br />
pleasing development.<br />
They're the only two specific announcements that I have to make but you may want to<br />
ask me a question or two and I'd be very happy in my normal fashion to try and<br />
respond. Fa rom13/ 02/ 97 14: 56 Pg: 1 </p>
<p>Fax from QUESTION: Prime Minister, on the employment rates other than what you've said, unemployment<br />
is actually 21 800 higher than the same month last year, how soon do you expect your<br />
Government's policies to actually start flowing through to reducing that amount?<br />
PRIM MINISTER:<br />
I can't and I won't try to put a month or a particular time on it. I am not going to<br />
make predictions about particular targets by particular times. I repeat what I've said<br />
before and that is that we will muster atom of every policy activity towards improving<br />
the employment situation. There's been strong evidence of that this week in relation to<br />
the announcement on the ' work for the dole' approach. But I'm simply not going to<br />
start talking about things being achieved by particular months. And there's always<br />
deficiencies in comparing a particular month with another particular month just as<br />
there are deficiencies and ill wisdom in if you have a good month saying, you know,<br />
eureka! the problem has been solved. I mean, that is simply not something P'm going<br />
to do. It remains a very difficult challenge. It will take time. The former government<br />
had 13 years and left us with 8.5% unemployment having pushed it to a postdepression<br />
high in the early 1990s. We have had just on a year, and I'll say again and<br />
I'T keep on saying it, that it really is absurd and impertinent and lacking in any<br />
credibility for a government that had 13 years to fix a problem and leaves it in large<br />
dimensions, then thumping the table after a year saying how outrageous and how<br />
shocking, you haven't fixed the problem.<br />
QUESTION: Prime Minister, if these figures are pleasing you'd have to admit that most of the<br />
figures beforehand have been less than pleasing, could you therefore say that you've<br />
now reached a turning point on employment?<br />
PRIME MUISTER:<br />
No, I'm not prepared to say that. All I'm prepared say is soberly and sensibly<br />
comment as accurately as I can on the monthly figures as they come out. But this is<br />
too serious a problem to sort of became the captive of fancy rhetoric. It is too serious<br />
a problem for that. And you all know that these figures can bounce around. All I can<br />
do is react to a given set of figures. If they're disappointing, they're disappointing. If<br />
they're pleasing, they're pleasing. But I'm not going to get into this game of saying<br />
well, you know, we've just turned the corner or this or that. I don't know. All I can<br />
say is that we've had a growth in employment of 158 000 since I became Prime<br />
Minister. Now, I hope that growth goes on. I really do. And we will do everything<br />
we humanly can to ensure that that growth does go on. But I can't be certain it will<br />
but I hope that the policy changes that we made in the area of industrial relations,<br />
many of which incidentally won't begi to bite, until the I1st of March they won't come<br />
in to force. The workplace agreement of the JR legislation doesn't come in to force<br />
until the 1st of March. The unfair dismissal law was only changed from the 1st of<br />
January. Many other provisions of the Act have only been in operation with the other<br />
provisions since the 1st of January. And some of the measures we've taken to help<br />
Fa rom13/ 02/ 97 14: 56 Pg: 2 </p>
<p>Fax from small business. The very, very generous and I think major incentive involved in the<br />
capital gains tax change doesn't start until the I1st of July. So I don't want to overstate<br />
it and I won't and it should not become the captive of fancy, transient, political<br />
rhetoric. QUESTION: Prime Minister, did John Sharp mislead the Parliament yesterday when he said that he<br />
hadn't discussed consultancies with any member of the CASA board?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I think you could well be referring to Mrs Pollock. I think that's about the worst kept<br />
secret around this building today that Lindsay Tanner is going to raise Mrs Pollock.<br />
QUFSTION: John Sharp admitted on AM this morning that he had discussed consultancies.<br />
PRIME MINSTER:<br />
I don't believe he misled the Parliament. I think the implication behind that suggestion<br />
is that he had promised consultancies to people whereas the situation as explained to<br />
me by John, and I have no reason at all to disbelieve it, is that what John did was to say<br />
to the lady in question that if you were to resign that would not of itself disentitle you<br />
to consultancy work with the Government in future. It is my understanding, based on<br />
what he's told me, that she had in fact done consultancy work before. So what he was<br />
really doing was not, as I understand it, was not saying, look, if you resign I'll<br />
guarantee you consultancies. What he was saying was that if you resign that will not<br />
prevent you on the merits getting consultancy work in the future. And against the<br />
background of her having had it in the past, which I am told was the situation, that is a<br />
very different thing.<br />
QUESTION: Can you explain exactly what the rules of this Government are in relation to offering<br />
one job on the basis of resignation from another?<br />
PRIMIE MNISTER:<br />
Well the rules are rules of probity and commonsense and this is not an argument about<br />
probity. This is an argument about safe skies. We have never disguised the fact, nor<br />
has Sharp ever disguised the fact that he wanted a new board because of many of the<br />
things that have happened under the former Government, the obvious lack of aviation<br />
experience of the existing board, and can I say, I think John Sharp has adopted a<br />
commonsense approach. If you want a better board you are a new government isn't<br />
it sensible to talk to people? I mean, he has been criticised for trying to do the right<br />
and courteous thing by a particular person and not in any way to call into doubt or<br />
question her credentials in other areas and I don't think he's lacked any probity at all<br />
Fafrri13/ 02/ 97 14: 56 Pg: 3 </p>
<p>Fax from and you say, what are the rules? You act with probity but you also act with<br />
commnonsense and the commonsense of this situation is that his behaviour, so far from<br />
being suspicious or tawdry or corrupt, his behaviour has been the commnonsense<br />
behaviour of a Minister endeavouring to implement a policy change in an area where<br />
there was disaster and failure and tragic loss of life under the former Government. I<br />
mean, this is about safer skies, not about corruption. If you want safer skies you will<br />
understand that what John Sharp has endeavoured to do is absolutely right.<br />
QUESTION: Mr Howard, when you were elected you promised very exacting standards of<br />
Government. In the light of the ( inaudible) this week can you be said to be delivering<br />
on those promises?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I don't think for a moment the developments this week have compromised that<br />
promnise at all. I mean, there has been no lack of honesty or candour or probity by<br />
Sharp or by Henron, In relation to the Woods matter, Senator Woods of course is<br />
resigning from the Parliament. The criticism that was made of me in relation to the<br />
Woods matter was that I had not recalled, which I hadn't and which I acknowledge I<br />
had not recalled a reference to it made by the Attorney General five or six months ago.<br />
Now you can choose to believe or disbelieve that and I know that some of you have<br />
written in disbelief of it. I know that. Well can I say that your disbelief is not well<br />
founded. I didn't remember that conversation when I made, when I gave the answer to<br />
Ray Martin and that's regrettable but I didn't. And when you bear in mind that I had<br />
in the space of two weeks, I had had a conversation with Bob Woods, the first<br />
convseration I had had with him abotu the issue and a conversation on the same day I<br />
think within the space of half an hour perhaps, or an hour with the Attorney General<br />
about the same matter and that I had subsequently had a discussion with Bob Woods<br />
when parliament resumed only last week in which he told me he was going to resign<br />
and fujrther spoke about this matter. I think it is understandable perhaps the rather<br />
transient reference to it five or six months earlier had escaped mny attention but that<br />
doesn't represent any lack of probity or dishonesty unless you are claiming that what I<br />
should have done when I was told by the Attorney General in, I think it was August or<br />
September of last year, or perhaps a little later. The exact date we haven't been able to<br />
fix, unless you are saying to me I should have dragged the bloke in and said look, the<br />
federal cappers are going to have a look at you, thereby warning him, and I am going<br />
to stand you down while they're having a look at you. Now that has been put to me.<br />
Can I say I don't accept that. Now those who have put that will continue to put it but<br />
I don't believe that suggests a lack of probity, You can criticise the fact that I didn't<br />
remember it. Go ahead and do that but don't suggest that that is a lack of standards<br />
because standards go to things such as probity and honesty. They don't suggest that<br />
you will, on every single occasion have an immaculately infallible memory. I don't.<br />
QUESTION:<br />
But Prime Minister yesterday you told the Parliament that your Department informed<br />
you that the President of the Senate supported the salaly arrangement for Senator<br />
Farrri13/ 02/ 97 14: 56 Pg: 4 </p>
<p>Fax from Colston but the correspondence would suggest otherwise, that the President of the<br />
Senate didn't support that.<br />
PRIME MINISTR:<br />
Well my Department did say to me that Senator Reid supports his views in principle<br />
but is seeking supplementation for the increased salary. Now the correspondence to<br />
which you are referring, I think, I can't be certain because you're referring to it, the<br />
correspondence is correspondence that passed between Senator Reid and Senator<br />
Colston before Senator Colston wrote to me and on the information that's been given<br />
to me by my Department, Senator Reid did not allude to that correspondence when she<br />
wrote to me. So when I made that statement to the Parliament, and I repeat it to you<br />
today, I was relying on what I had been told by my Department.<br />
QUESTION: Prime Minister, when did Mr Sharp refer to ( inaudible) in the discussions between Mr<br />
Sharp and yourself; when did Mr Sharp refer to the ( inaudible) situation?<br />
PRIM MINISTER:<br />
No it was mentioned by him yesterday. Exactly when within the half an hour I can't<br />
tell you but, and we would have, it would have been discussed again today.<br />
QUESTION: Why didn't you refer that matter to the Chief General Counsel?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Because I was satisfied that the explanation that he gave me did not represent any valid<br />
grounds for doing that,<br />
QUESTION: Mr Howard, last night Justice Bishop had a different explanation of the..<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
He was pretty busy on the phone I gather.<br />
QUESTION: No, not really...<br />
PRIME MINISTER;<br />
Yes he was. Fa om13/ 02/ 97 14: 56 Pg: </p>
<p>Fax from PIM3E MINISTER:<br />
What he said was that if Mr Sharp had said to Dr Pollock if she was not on the board<br />
there could be consultancy work with..<br />
PRIME MINISTER;<br />
Look, I am not going to respond to something that is put by somebody who wasn't<br />
involved as a principle in the original conversation. I've been in this game long enough<br />
not to get into that. I can only repeat to you the explanation that John Sharp who was<br />
a principle in the original conversation, Bill Fisher wasn't a principle in the original<br />
conversation, I can only repeat what John Sharp has said to me and I have no reason at<br />
all to doubt what he has told me. I have always found John Sharp to be both<br />
competent and candid.<br />
] PRIME MINISTER:<br />
That problem with the probity and honesty of the arrangement with Ms Hollows, why<br />
is it that Senator Herron chose to read all but three lines of the letter yesterday to the<br />
Senate, the three likes being those relating to John Sharp? ( Inaudible) giving people<br />
fuill information about what was going on?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well you will have to ask him that. I mean I can't put myself in, much in all as I<br />
respect and have affection for my colleagues, I cannot put my mind, put myself inside<br />
the mind of each and every one of my colleagues. I really think that is verging on the<br />
pedantic. Well, you'll have to ask him. I don't know.<br />
QUESTION: ( inaudible)<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I'm sorry Laura. The letter was tabled by me. I mean, if we'd held the letter<br />
back you might have a point but I mean, I tabled the letter yesterday with Burmnester's<br />
opinion.<br />
QUESTION: Prime Minister do you believe that Gabi Hollows representing, membership of the<br />
CASA board as a consumer representative is somehow compromising air safety in<br />
Australia? PRIME AMISTER:<br />
I'm not going to personalise the comments I have made because I had quite a regard<br />
for Gabi Hollows but the fact is that of all of the people on the board, Molloy is the<br />
Faro m13/' 82/ 97 14: 56 Pg: 6 </p>
<p>Fax from only person who has any civil aviation background or experience and given the history<br />
of it and given that one of the reports that camne out last year was into the Seaview<br />
Report in fact cited lack of effective supervision as one of the causes of the problems<br />
in the industry. I think Sharp's case is very powerfu~ l, I mean, Gabi Hollows is<br />
associated with many great causes in Australia and she obviously has expertise in many<br />
areas and that was clearly in the minds of both John Sharp and Senator Herron and..<br />
QUESTION: Do you understand her seeing that letter as an inducement to step down from the<br />
CASA board?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, if it were, why was there a gap of 11 months between the date the letter was<br />
written, or not 11, perhaps 10 months, and I mean, that letter was written in May and<br />
this matter has arisen in the last couple of days. Now if in fact people felt that his<br />
behaviour had been so outrageous I mean, I just make that point.<br />
QUESTION: Mrs Hollows thought that Mr Sharp had not acted appropriately, that she was upset<br />
after the conversation. Apparently that's what she's put in, I understand that's what<br />
she's put in the letter or a fax to you.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Look I'm not going to talk about I mean, that's her letter to me. I don't, I mean,<br />
what she does with that letter is her business.<br />
QUESTIONShould you not have referred that letter and her view and her concerns to legal counsel<br />
before clearing your Ministers?<br />
PRIME ] MINISTER:<br />
That particular letter was a communication from Gabi Hollows to me and I don't think<br />
it really had anything, it didn't bear upon the allegation. You see the question that was<br />
asked of me was asked of me by Tanner and he said : Herron delivers this letter.<br />
Doesn't this represent a breach of the Crimes Act?<br />
QUESTION: Why didn't you report to the Chief Counsel the matter surrounding the letter?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well they were in the sense John that the material that was before the Chief General<br />
Fa rom13/ 02/ 97 14: 56 Pg: 7 </p>
<p>Fax from Counsel included the answers that had been given by both Herron and by Sharp in the<br />
House. QUESTION: ( inaudible) if she was not on the board there could be consultancy work.. ( inaudible)...<br />
PREME MINISTER:<br />
The allegation was that the letter represented an inducement. That was the allegation<br />
and that is the allegation that I've had investigated and I am satisfied that there was no<br />
attempt to in any way limit the investigation.<br />
QIJEST[ ON:<br />
You talk about commonsense, and then you talked about the safety problems... do you<br />
believe Gabi Hollows compromises air safety ( inaudible). Are you saying that..<br />
PRIME MNISTER:<br />
What P'm saying to...<br />
QUESTION: on a slightly case by case basis..<br />
PREWME MINISTER:<br />
No I'm just, no I'm not saying that. I'm just saying that people ought to have a<br />
commonsense approach to these things. This has got nothing to do with bribery or<br />
corruption or dishonest dealing. You have a plain, simple situation where John Sharp<br />
wanted to bring about a change in the personnel of the board, not because he had<br />
anything against Gabi Hollows. You have a Chairman of the Board who obviously,<br />
you know, is an old Labor warrior, I don't criticise him for that but I mean, let's just<br />
exercise a little bit of commonsense about it. He wanted these changes to the board.<br />
He recognised that Gabi Hollows had skills in other areas. He doesn't want to do her<br />
in the eye but he wants to bring about a change in the composition of the Board<br />
because there has been a long record of failures in this area. I mean, you've had two<br />
major disasters, absolute disasters in this area and you have an inquiry at the end of last<br />
year that underlines that point and he set out to achieve the objectives of the<br />
Government and I think in the circumstances, I mean if you want to, you can have a<br />
pedantic, you know, view about it, or you can take the view that there has been, which<br />
I do, there has been absolutely no lack of probity. I mean, if he had sort of suggested<br />
that somebody occupy a position to which that person had no dernostrable skills. After<br />
all, this lady is associated with the Hollows Foundation. She has a clear interest in<br />
matters relating to Aboriginal health. If the proposal had involved something in which<br />
she had no demonstrable skills, I think that would have been an entirely different<br />
matter. Fa rom13/ 02/ 97 14: 56 Pg: 8 </p>
<p>Fax from QUESTION: . this principle that members of a board should have expertise in the area, hands on<br />
experience in the area that they are governing...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
It depends on the circumstances. Where you've had an appalling record of death and<br />
disaster and safety falure I think you ought to apply more rigidly than you might in<br />
areas where there hasn't been demonstrable failure.<br />
QUESTION. Prime Minister, when Senator Colston got in contact with your office seeking the pay<br />
rise, did it then follow any discussions among your staff or perhaps even involving you<br />
that it might be warranted to not necessarily make the Senator happy but to make sure<br />
he wasn't unhappy given the text of the Telstra vote?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I had a discussion with my Chief of Staff about it. I had a brief discussion with her<br />
about it. I had to approve it under the MOPS Act that is why I was involved. And, I<br />
said that she raised it with me and she briefly discussed it. I had a minute from my<br />
Department about it and the minute from my Department recommended that I approve<br />
it. But the cost of it be sought within the Senate's budget.<br />
QUESTION: . at no stage was the possibility of Senator Colston's vote raised in your discussion<br />
with your Chief of Staff or anybody...<br />
PRIME MINSTER:<br />
I don't remember that being discussed. Btur in mind it was a couple of weeks actually<br />
before the final vote on Teistra.<br />
QUESTION:<br />
Prime Minister, you told the Partyroom on Tuesday that you wanted..<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Did I?<br />
QUESTIONto focus on the three core issues ( inaudible)... the three core issues of<br />
unemployment. You spent all this week fending off questions on a number of other<br />
issues. Fa om13/ 02/ 97 14: 56 Pg: 9 </p>
<p>Fax from PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well that happens.<br />
QUESTION: I mean, does it worry you though?<br />
PRIE AMSTER;<br />
No. QUESTION:<br />
Mr Howard, given the controversy surrounding the CASA Board do you think that Mr<br />
Sharp in terms of any appointments to that Board should ensure that he does not want<br />
any people who may have done work or supported the Coalition during the election<br />
campaign and/ or people he has close mix to, personal mix to?<br />
PRIME MNISTER:<br />
It depends on their ability and their qualifications. I mean, my well I know who<br />
you're talking about and why didn't you name him? Well Dick Smith has an enormous<br />
amount of skill in this area, an enormous amount of skill in this area, but who gets<br />
appointed to the Board is a matter for the Cabinet to decide when there are vacancies.<br />
But let me state my policy I don't believe that a close personal association or a clear<br />
identified public support for one side of politics is of itself a disqualification. It<br />
depends on whether you have merit in its own right for the particular position. I mean,<br />
surely nobody criticised our appointment of Donald McDonald as Chairman of the<br />
ABC. He had clear and evident skills for the job, Of course he's a close personal<br />
friend of mine. I didn't criticise many of the appointments made by the former<br />
government where they were clearly made on ability. I didn't criticise the appointment<br />
of people like Michael McHugh despite his clear association to the High Court of<br />
Australia. I didn't criticise the appointment of Doug McClelland as High Commission<br />
to London. I have left in place people like Kerry Sibraa and Neal fllewett and Oceoff<br />
Walsh in their respective positions since we took office. You've always got to look at<br />
whether the person has merit. I mean, if we're ever to get into a situation where you<br />
can never appoint somebody who's supported the Coalition it's a question of whether<br />
they can cut the mustard in the job, that's got to be the principle. If they can't cut the<br />
mustard in the job it clearly is a job for the boy or the girl, but where they can identify<br />
particular skills I think it's utterly justified.<br />
QUESTION: Prime Minister, Justice Fisher was working the pretty busily last night. Do you<br />
think he's behind a campaign to trip Mr Sharp up? Fa rom13/ 02/ 97 14: 56 Pg: to </p>
<p>Fax from PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I don't think he's, sort of, trying to help him. And I think there's been a far<br />
amount of beating of the tribal drum on it. But look, I understand that. I've known<br />
Bill Fisher for a long time. But I mecan, let's just understand where Bill's coming from<br />
he does have strong Labor affliation, I don't criticise him for that. I've enjoyed his<br />
company at social occasions on a number of times in the past. I mean, once again<br />
please exercise some common sense about this and the common sense of it is that<br />
you've got a new Minister with a clear mandate to fix up a disaster area inherited from<br />
the former government, you have a board presided over by somebody and with the<br />
exception of one they have no experience at all in aviation safety. Sharp sets about<br />
trying to bring about changes in the Board and one of those approaches is to say to a<br />
very respected person who doesn't have civil aviation experience but has a lot of other<br />
experience in another area hey we'd like you to help in this as part of the discussion<br />
we'd like you to help in this other area, Now in my book that is a common sense<br />
vigorous action on behalf of the Minister and it's as far away from shonky behaviour as<br />
you can possibly get.<br />
QUESTION: Given the weight that you were placing on established guides given that the Board<br />
members say that there is now no way that they will resign, they have six months to go<br />
and they chose longer, are you going to act to try to remove them from the Board?<br />
PRIME MINISTER;<br />
Look, I will act in accordance with the law. The law confers upon them under the<br />
relevant Act certain entitlements and it also has certain provisions in relation to the<br />
circumstances in which they may cease to be members of the Board. I mean, I will<br />
observe the law. I can do no more than that. Obviously the Chairman is encouraging<br />
them not to resign. I mean, he's made that perfectly clear in discussions with the<br />
Minister. I mean, you've got a clear case here where the Chairman appointed by the<br />
former government has dug his heels in and is encouraging everybody else not to go<br />
and the Minister has tried to bring about changes and we're talking about events that<br />
happened in May of last year.<br />
QUESTION: try and explain Mr Sharp's memory loss in the Parliament yesterday?<br />
PRIM1E MINISTER:<br />
What memory loss is that?<br />
QUESTION: Well he was asked on a couple of occasions about other offers he may have made to<br />
CASA Board members... Fa om13/ 02/ 97 14: 56 Pg: 11 </p>
<p>Fax from PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well you'd have to ask him that, Mike.<br />
QUESTION; Surely there comes a point doesn't there of which memory loss of his and now it's<br />
misleading the Parliament?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well are you alleging that be did?<br />
QUESTION: I'm not alleging that at all, I'm asking..<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I don't believe he has, but as for his own particular recollections he's obviously<br />
better qualified to answer to those than anybody else.<br />
QUESTION: Prime Minister, were you relying on the wrong legal advice yesterday when you told<br />
Parliament that the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs was not<br />
in a position to authorise the construction of the Hindmarsh Island bridge?<br />
PRIME MINISTER.<br />
NO, QUESTION:<br />
Given that in November Mr Burrnester and Senator Herron both said in estimates<br />
committees that that was the case-..<br />
PRIME MINSTER:<br />
Well the Burmester opinion of that time has been rather selectively quoted. The advice<br />
that the Government had and the advice on which the decision to proceed with the<br />
legislation was based was advice because there was an outstanding application. it was<br />
necessary for the Government to appoint another reporter and if you appoint another<br />
reporter you've then got to have another report and the danger that we were advised<br />
could arise was that if we went ahead with the construction of the bridge there could<br />
be an application made to the court for an injunction to stop the bridge going ahead<br />
and the court could then turn around and say to us, you've got to go back and deal<br />
with the outstanding application. So not only would you still have the cost of the<br />

<p>Fax from application. Now that was the legal advice that was available on which we acted.<br />
That was the legal advice to which I referred.<br />
QUESTION:<br />
Mr Howard, do you think Mr Fisher's behaviour in terms of asking for members of<br />
the CASA Board going to resign, do you think that My Fisher's behaviour is<br />
appropriate given government policy?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I understand where he's comning from. I'm not going to say it's appropriate or<br />
inappropriate. I just want I made those comments to put the whole thing into<br />
context. I'm not going to say it's inappropriate.<br />
QUESTION:<br />
Is it appropriate?<br />
PRIME MINISTE&amp;<br />
I beg your pardon?<br />
QUESTION: Is it appropriate?<br />
PRI[ ME MIINISTER:<br />
Well I've given you an answer to that. You're asking me I'm not going to say<br />
whether it is appropriate or inappropriate, that is a matter for him.<br />
QUESTION: Have you sought to talk to Giabi Hollows to...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No. Well I did, hang on, we tried to reach her yesterday before either I or somebody<br />
on my staff, I didn't, somebody on my staff tried to reach her yesterday. I wanted to<br />
let her know that I was going to table the Herron letter. But that was the only reason<br />
I thought I owed her that courtesy. John Herron, in fact, sent her a fax indicating that<br />
we were going to do that. But I haven't, I mean, I will reply to her letter but I haven't<br />
tried you don't think I would have tried to ring her and talk about the matter? I think<br />
I would have copped a question or two if I had have done that. Fafrft13/ 02/ 97 14: 56 Pg: 13 </p>
<p>Fax from QUESTION, Have you* taken steps to ensure that all MWs are abiding by travel and other<br />
parliamentary entitlements?<br />
] PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I th~ ink my colleagues are aware at all times that I expect them to be above board<br />
in relation to those matters and can I remind you Michael that there has been, there has<br />
been no concrete evidence that anybody is other than above board.<br />
QUESTION: Except.. PRIE MINISTEIL<br />
Well I've answered the question. I can't I mean, they are constantly aware from me<br />
that they have to be very careful about these things and I am I've certainly reminded<br />
my colleagues from time to time of the need to do that.<br />
QUESTION: When do you expect the police investigation to end and why has it taken so long?<br />
PRIE MNISTER:<br />
Well, I don't know. I would like these police investigations to come to an end, yes.<br />
But I think that's a matter that really...<br />
QUESTION: Have you made any inquiries why it would take 6 months...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yes, well, I have asked the Attorney General to inquire of the Australian Federal<br />
Police as to when the investigations will be completed, but I asked him to do so with<br />
out in any way conveying any suggestion that we wanted other than a completely<br />
thorough investigation and I just hope that they will be complete.<br />
QUESTION: Has there been any reply?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, the reply has been generally to the effect that they hope they will be completed<br />
soon, and I can't... Fa om13/ 02/ 97 14: 56 PS: 14 </p>
<p>Fax from QUESTION: It seems a long time.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, I think it is too, Michelle, but I've got to be careful here. If I say anymore than<br />
that somebody midght say I'm putting pressure on the Federal Police. I mean that quite<br />
seriously. I mean, it is a longstanding practice that Prime Ministers, Attorneys-General<br />
and other responsible Ministers don't give running commentaries on security<br />
intelligence and police matters. Now, I would, obviously I would like these inquiries<br />
to be completed, whatever the outcome is, and I have raised that matter with the<br />
Attorney-General but I say here on the public record, not in the context of wanting the<br />
police in anyway to truncate or shorten or cut across proper lines of inquiry.<br />
QUESTION: Are you aware of any other inquiries into other M~ s apart from Senator Woods and<br />
MAr Cobb?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, I've been asked that before. I don't want you to get excited about the answer<br />
that I'm about to give but I can't really observe the code of neither confirming or<br />
denying if I try and answer that.<br />
QUESTION: On the work for the dole scheme, you said the other day that it may be extended to up<br />
to 30 year olds.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yes, but I think in the early stages that's unlikely but that's the sort of ceiling.., what I<br />
was endeavouring to convey with that was that we obviously don't expect people in<br />
the older age bracket I still regard 30 as extremely young people in the older age<br />
bracket to sort of feel as though they are going to be drawn into it...<br />
QUESTION: Given the fact that there are differing rates of unemployment benefit for people if they<br />
live at home or away from home. If they were doing the same job, somebody living<br />
away from home would be required to work longer hours than somebody living at<br />
home... PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, that could arise, that could arise, but the principle will be strictly observed that<br />
Fa rom13/ 02/ 97 14: S6 Pg: </p>
<p>Fax from you won't be required to work more than the number of hours that will work out your<br />
dole payment.<br />
QUESTION:<br />
How close to the mark was Gareth Evans when he described the work for the dole<br />
scheme as the Bob Woods' memorial rock painting programme?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:~<br />
Well given that we started discussing it in December of last year in the Employment<br />
Commrittee, he was a country mile away.<br />
QUESTION;<br />
Why didn't you announce it in the election if you were so confident it was such a<br />
popular policy?<br />
PRIM MIINISTER:<br />
We didn't announce it in the election campaign because we had a determination during<br />
that campaign to focus on particular policies and we did, and I think we've been over<br />
the question of what was said about it in the campaign. The policy documents were<br />
silent on the issue. They didn't say, the two policy documents, and I've had them<br />
checked again, the two policy documents the one :' P~ athways to Jobs" and the other<br />
the Social Security policy, those two documents were silent on the subject. Now, it is<br />
true as I acknowledge that in response to the questionnaires certain words were used<br />
and I've explained the circumstances of that, and people have taken a bit of a swipe at<br />
that which is fair enough, but the fact remains that my own views on the thing, my own<br />
personal views are that conceptually it is not something that I've opposed but I've<br />
always sort of understood that it is something that would need to be piloted, it would<br />
need to be trialed and I think the silence in the two documents on the subject was a fair<br />
reflection. Could I also add Malcolm that the popularity of it is not the driving force behind my<br />
support of it. I mean, I never mind, I'll be quite honest with you, I never mind if a<br />
policy I support on policy grounds always turns out to be popular, I mean, all Prime<br />
Ministers like their announcements to be popular and I wouldn't pretend that I'm any<br />
different to any other Prime Minister in that sense but..<br />
QUESTION: Do you think there might be a risk that it was misconstrued by the Labor Party...<br />
PRIE MINSTER:<br />
Well, can I say it was not something that was really talked about very much in the lead<br />
up to the campaign and that perhaps explains the fact that certain statements were<br />
made in that material prepared the Party. Fa om13/ 02/ 97 14: 56 Pg: 16 </p>
<p>Fax from QUESTION: . so convinced of what the policy was, especially when they have said that their<br />
statement was made in conjunction with the Minister's office. They were obviously<br />
quite unequivocal about the position of the...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, Michelle, that's already been.. I can't really add to anything that's been said on<br />
that and you will understand better than most that in the heat and burden of an election<br />
campaign there are quite literally hundreds of questions that pour into campaign<br />
headquarters and that particular question was not referred to me or to my office.<br />
QUESTION: ( inaudible)...<br />
PRIMEf MINISTER:<br />
It was, I know that, and..<br />
QUESTION: an unequivocal statement by the Party. Now surely they would not get something so<br />
simple, so confused?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well they obviously took certain steps in preparing that answer and those steps have<br />
been explained. I can only repeat what I have said to Malcolm that it was not in either<br />
of the policy documents either way that we supported it or we opposed it.<br />
QUESTION:<br />
But from what you've said today Mr Howard it was clearly in your minds that this was<br />
a possibility because you've said that you only wanted to focus on some policy issues<br />
in the campaign which implies that this was something that was in your mind, you<br />
didn't wish to focus on it during the campaign?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I don't I think I've said to you before and I've said publicly before that I had no<br />
recollection of having personally ruled it out during the election campaign and I've<br />
asked my office to go through all of the transcripts of what I said and I have been not<br />
able to find any reference to it having been ruled out and that was the basis of the<br />
statement that I made on the Sunday programme. Fa om13/ 02/ 97 14: 56 Pg: 17 </p>
<p>Fax from QUESTION: In that search have you found any references to you not ruling it out I think it was<br />
Sunday...<br />
PRIME MMNISTER:<br />
Well, when you say you're careflul not to rule something out... I mean, I haven't found<br />
any reference to it being ruled out...<br />
QUESTION: But you made a point of saying that you during the campaign made a point of not<br />
ruling it out. Given the circumstance...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
That was a description of my state of mind.<br />
QUESTION: If the Commonwealth Bank can cut home loan interest rates, do you think they should<br />
be cutting rates for small business and credit cards?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, I wish they could but of course the competitive conditions in that area are<br />
nowhere near as great because except for the rather small intervention of Aussie Home<br />
loans announced earlier this week you don't have the same amount of competition in<br />
the small business area as you have in the home loan area. But I would hope that in<br />
the fuzllness of time there would be more competition. I'll take one more question.<br />
QUESTION: Would say Mr Howard that the past two weeks have been the Government's worst<br />
since the election and what share of the blame do you carry?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Randall, after my career you call the last two weeks difficult!<br />
