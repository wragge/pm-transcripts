THE COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA</p>
<p>THE STATE OF NEW SOUTH WALESTHE STATE OF VICTORIA</p>
<p>THE STATE OF QUEENSLAND</p>
<p>THE STATE OF WESTERN AUSTRALIA</p>
<p>THE STATE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA</p>
<p>THE STATE OF TASMANIA</p>
<p>THE AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY, AND</p>
<p>THE NORTHERN TERRITORY OF AUSTRALIA</p>
<p>WHEREAS</p>
<p>   (1) the Special Premiers' Conference on 13 November 1998 developed</p>
<p> principles for the reform of Commonwealth-State financial relations;</p>
<p>(2)  the Commonwealth, States and Territories are in agreement</p>
<p> that the current financial relationship between levels of government</p>
<p> must be reformed to facilitate a stronger and more productive federal</p>
<p> system for the new millennium;</p>
<p>(3) while a majority of the States and Territories support the introduction</p>
<p> of the Goods and Services Tax (GST), the agreement of New South Wales,</p>
<p> Queensland and Tasmania to the reform of Commonwealth-State financial</p>
<p> relations does not imply their in-principle endorsement of the GST;</p>
<p>(4) an Agreement was reached between the Commonwealth and the States</p>
<p> and Territories on the reform of Commonwealth-State financial relations</p>
<p> on 9 April 1999;</p>
<p>(5) this revised Agreement was made necessary by the changes to the</p>
<p> Commonwealth Government's A New Tax System (ANTS) package</p>
<p> announced by the Prime Minister on 28 May 1999; and</p>
<p>(6) this revised Agreement supersedes the previous Agreement of 9</p>
<p> April 1999:</p>
<p>IT IS HEREBY AGREED:</p>
<p>PART 1  PRELIMINARY</p>
<p>Commencement Clause</p>
<p>  * This Agreement will commence between the Commonwealth, the States</p>
<p> and the Territories on 1 July 1999 unless otherwise</p>
<p> agreed by the Parties. </p>
<p>Objectives</p>
<p>  * The objectives of the reforms set down in this agreement include:</p>
<p>  (i) the achievement of a new national tax system, including</p>
<p>   the elimination of a number of existing inefficient taxes which</p>
<p>   are impeding economic activity;</p>
<p>  (ii) the provision to State and Territory Governments of revenue</p>
<p>   from a more robust tax base that can be expected to grow over</p>
<p>   time; and</p>
<p>  (iii) an improvement in the financial position of all State</p>
<p>   and Territory Governments, once the transitional changes have</p>
<p>   been completed, relative to that which would have existed had</p>
<p>   the current arrangements continued.</p>
<p> * All Parties to the Agreement acknowledge the need to pursue</p>
<p> on-going reform of Commonwealth-State financial relations.</p>
<p>Acknowledgement of Agreement</p>
<p>  * The Commonwealth will attach the Agreement as a schedule to</p>
<p> the A New Tax System (Commonwealth-State Financial Arrangements)</p>
<p> Act 1999. The Commonwealth will use its best endeavours to</p>
<p> ensure the Act will require compliance with the Agreement. The</p>
<p> States and Territories will attach the Agreement as a schedule</p>
<p> to relevant State and Territory legislation. The States and Territories</p>
<p> will use their best endeavours to ensure their legislation will</p>
<p> require compliance with the Agreement. </p>
<p>PART 2  Commonwealth-State Financial reform</p>
<p>Reform Measures</p>
<p> * The Parties will undertake all necessary steps to have appropriate</p>
<p> legislation enacted to give effect to the following reform measures.</p>
<p>   * The Commonwealth will legislate to provide all of the revenue</p>
<p>   from the GST to the States and Territories and will legislate to</p>
<p>   maintain the rate and base of the GST in accordance with this Agreement.</p>
<p> * The Commonwealth will cease to apply the Wholesale Sales Tax from</p>
<p>   1 July 2000 and will not reintroduce it or a similar tax in the</p>
<p>   future. </p>
<p> * The temporary arrangements for the taxation of petrol, liquor</p>
<p>   and tobacco under the safety net arrangements announced by the Commonwealth</p>
<p>   on 6 August 1997 will cease on 1 July 2000.</p>
<p> * The payment of Financial Assistance Grants will cease on 1 July</p>
<p>   2000.</p>
<p> * The Commonwealth will continue to provide Specific Purpose Payments</p>
<p>   (SPPs) to the States and Territories and has no intention of cutting</p>
<p>   aggregate SPPs as part of the reform process set out in this Agreement,</p>
<p>   consistent with the objective of the State and Territory Governments</p>
<p>   being financially better off under the new arrangements.</p>
<p> * The States and Territories will cease to apply the taxes referred</p>
<p>   to in Appendix A from the dates</p>
<p>   outlined below and will not reintroduce them or similar taxes in</p>
<p>   the future</p>
<p>   * Bed taxes, from 1 July 2000; </p>
<p>   * Financial Institutions Duty, from 1 July 2001; </p>
<p>   * Stamp duties on quoted marketable securities from 1 July 2001;</p>
<p>   * Debits tax by 1 July 2005, subject to review by the Ministerial</p>
<p> Council;</p>
<p> * The Ministerial Council will by 2005 review the need for retention</p>
<p>   of stamp duty on non-residential conveyances; leases; mortgages,</p>
<p>   debentures, bonds and other loan securities; credit arrangements,</p>
<p>   installment purchase arrangements and rental arrangements; and on</p>
<p>   cheques, bills of exchange, promissory notes; and unquoted marketable</p>
<p>   securities.</p>
<p> * The States and Territories will adjust their gambling tax arrangements</p>
<p>   to take account of the impact of the GST on gambling operators.</p>
<p> * Following negotiations under the CSHA, the States and Territories</p>
<p>   will ensure that increases in pensions and allowances specified</p>
<p>   in the tax reform package will not flow through to increased public</p>
<p>   housing rents where these rents are linked to the level of pensions.</p>
<p> * Nothing in this clause will prevent any Party from introducing</p>
<p>   anti-avoidance measures that are reasonably necessary to protect</p>
<p>   its remaining tax base or liabilities accrued prior to the date</p>
<p>   the tax ceases to apply.</p>
<p>GST Legislation</p>
<p>  * All Parties agree to reconsider this Agreement should the Commonwealth</p>
<p> Parliament pass the GST legislation in a way that significantly</p>
<p> affects this Agreement.</p>
<p>Distribution of GST Revenue</p>
<p> * The Commonwealth will make GST revenue grants to the States</p>
<p> and Territories equivalent to the revenue from the GST subject</p>
<p> to the arrangements in this Agreement. GST revenue grants will</p>
<p> be freely available for use by the States and Territories for</p>
<p> any purpose.</p>
<p>   * The Commonwealth will distribute GST revenue grants among the</p>
<p> States and Territories in accordance with horizontal fiscal equalisation</p>
<p> (HFE) principles subject to the transitional arrangements set</p>
<p> out below and other relevant provisions of this Agreement. </p>
<p>   * Details of the payment arrangements are contained in Appendix</p>
<p> B to this Agreement.</p>
<p>Transitional Arrangements</p>
<p> * In each of the transitional years following the</p>
<p> introduction of the GST, the Commonwealth guarantees that the</p>
<p> budgetary position of each individual State and Territory will</p>
<p> be no worse off than it would have been had the reforms set out</p>
<p> in this Agreement not been implemented. </p>
<p>   * The Commonwealth will extend the transitional period by Regulation</p>
<p> (as provided for in the A New Tax System (Commonwealth-State</p>
<p> Financial Arrangements) Act 1999) to give effect to the commitments</p>
<p> in clause 10 in the event that transitional assistance is required</p>
<p> by any State or Territory after 30 June 2003.</p>
<p>   * To meet this guarantee, the Commonwealth will make transitional</p>
<p> assistance payments to each State and Territory, as necessary,</p>
<p> over this period. These payments will take the form of interest</p>
<p> free loans and grants in July 2000-01 and grants paid quarterly</p>
<p> in subsequent years and will be freely available for use by the</p>
<p> States and Territories for any purpose. Any payments or repayments</p>
<p> made by way of loans or grants under the Commonwealth's guarantee</p>
<p> will be excluded from assessments of per capita relativities recommended</p>
<p> by the Commonwealth Grants Commission (CGC). </p>
<p>   * The amounts of any additional assistance under the guarantee</p>
<p> will be determined in accordance with the processes set out in</p>
<p> Appendix C to this Agreement.</p>
<p>   * After the second year following the introduction of the GST,</p>
<p> GST revenue grants will be determined on the basis of HFE principles.</p>
<p> That is, after the first two years, any State or Territory which</p>
<p> is receiving more than would have been received under the current</p>
<p> arrangements will retain that excess. </p>
<p>First Home Owners Scheme</p>
<p> * To offset the impact of the introduction of a GST, the States</p>
<p> and Territories will assist first homebuyers through the funding</p>
<p> and administration of a new uniform First Home Owners Scheme.</p>
<p>   * This assistance will be provided to first home owners consistent</p>
<p> with Appendix D to this Agreement.</p>
<p>Application of the GST to Government</p>
<p> * The Parties intend that the Commonwealth, States, Territories</p>
<p> and local government and their statutory corporations and authorities</p>
<p> will operate as if they were subject to the GST legislation. They</p>
<p> will be entitled to register, will pay GST or make voluntary or</p>
<p> notional payments where necessary and will be entitled to claim</p>
<p> input tax credits in the same way as non-Government organisations.</p>
<p> All such payments will be included in GST revenue.</p>
<p>   * The Commonwealth will legislate to require the States and the</p>
<p> Northern Territory to withhold from any local government authority</p>
<p> being in breach of Clause 17 a sum representing the amount of</p>
<p> unpaid voluntary or notional GST payments. Amounts withheld will</p>
<p> form part of the GST revenue pool. Detailed arrangements will</p>
<p> be agreed by the Ministerial Council on advice from Heads of Treasuries.</p>
<p>Government Taxes and Charges</p>
<p> * The Commonwealth, States and Territories agree that the GST</p>
<p> does not apply to the payment of some taxes and compulsory charges.</p>
<p>   * The Parties will agree a list of taxes and compulsory charges</p>
<p> that are outside the scope of the GST. This list will be promulgated</p>
<p> by a determination by the Commonwealth Treasurer as set out in</p>
<p> Division 81-5 of the A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax)</p>
<p> Act 1999 (the GST Act).</p>
<p>   * In agreeing the list, the Commonwealth, States and Territories</p>
<p> will have regard to the following principles:</p>
<p>(i) taxes that are in the nature of a compulsory impost for general</p>
<p> purposes and compulsory charges by the way of fines or penalties</p>
<p> should not be subject to GST as these will not relate to any specific</p>
<p> supply of goods or services;</p>
<p>(ii) similarly, those regulatory charges that do not relate to</p>
<p> particular goods or services should be outside the scope of the</p>
<p> GST; and</p>
<p>(iii) the inclusion of any other charge in the Commonwealth Treasurer's</p>
<p> determination notwithstanding that it may relate to the supply</p>
<p> of a particular good or service will require the unanimous agreement</p>
<p> of the Commonwealth, States and Territories.</p>
<p>   * The agreed list of taxes and other compulsory charges that are</p>
<p> outside the scope of the GST will be subject to on-going review</p>
<p> and adjustment as necessary in consultation with the Ministerial</p>
<p> Council. The Parties will notify any objections to changes to</p>
<p> the list within a period to be specified by the Ministerial Council.</p>
<p>Reciprocal Taxation</p>
<p> * Reciprocal taxation will be progressed on a revenue neutral</p>
<p> basis, through the negotiation of a Reciprocal Taxation Agreement</p>
<p> with the objectives of:</p>
<p>* improving the transparency of tax arrangements between all</p>
<p>   levels of government;</p>
<p> * ensuring tax neutrality; and </p>
<p> * replacing the Statement of Policy Intent (SOPI) for the taxation</p>
<p>   treatment of Government Business Enterprises with tax arrangements</p>
<p>   which are broader in scope. </p>
<p> * It is the intention of the Parties to this Agreement that a</p>
<p> National Tax Equivalent Regime (NTER) for income tax will be operational</p>
<p> for State and Territory government business enterprises from 1 July</p>
<p> 2000. It is also intended that the reciprocal application of other</p>
<p> Commonwealth, State and Territory taxes will be subsequently implemented</p>
<p> as soon as practicable. </p>
<p>   * Local government organisations will be consulted with a view</p>
<p> to making the NTER for income tax operational for wholly owned</p>
<p> local government business enterprises from 1 July 2000 and</p>
<p> including local government in the Reciprocal Tax Agreement at</p>
<p> a later date.</p>
<p>   * Where the application of full indirect reciprocal tax arrangements</p>
<p> is prevented by the Constitution, jurisdictions have agreed to</p>
<p> work cooperatively to introduce voluntary payment arrangements</p>
<p> in these circumstances.</p>
<p>   * All governments have agreed that no further compensation payments</p>
<p> will be payable by any jurisdiction under the SOPI.</p>
<p>Monitoring of Prices</p>
<p> * In accordance with the Trade Practices Act 1974, as amended,</p>
<p> the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission will formally</p>
<p> monitor prices and take action against businesses that take pricing</p>
<p> decisions in a manner inconsistent with tax reform. </p>
<p>   * In order to ensure that these measures apply to the whole economy,</p>
<p> the States and Territories will adopt the Schedule version of</p>
<p> Part VB of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (part XIAA of the</p>
<p> New Tax System Price Exploitation Code) to extend the measures</p>
<p> in Part VB to cover those areas outside the Commonwealth's</p>
<p> constitutional power. All Parties will work towards having any</p>
<p> necessary legislation in place by 1 July 1999.</p>
<p>   * The monitoring and prohibition on unreasonable pricing decisions</p>
<p> will commence on 1 July 1999 and continue until 30 June 2002.</p>
<p>PART 3 - ADMINISTRATION OF THE GST</p>
<p>Management of the GST Rate</p>
<p> * After the introduction of the GST, a proposal to vary the 10</p>
<p> per cent rate of the GST will require:</p>
<p>  (i) the unanimous support of the State and Territory Governments;</p>
<p>  (ii) the endorsement by the Commonwealth Government of the day;</p>
<p>   and</p>
<p>  (iii) the passage of relevant legislation by both Houses of the</p>
<p>   Commonwealth Parliament.</p>
<p>Management of the GST Base</p>
<p> * Subject to clauses 34, 35 and 36 of this Agreement, after the</p>
<p> introduction of the GST, any proposal to vary the GST base will</p>
<p> require:</p>
<p>(i) the unanimous support of the State and Territory Governments;</p>
<p>(ii) the endorsement by the Commonwealth Government of the day;</p>
<p> and</p>
<p>(iii) the passage of relevant legislation by both Houses of the</p>
<p> Commonwealth Parliament.</p>
<p>   * All future changes to the GST base should be consistent with:</p>
<p>(i) the maintenance of the integrity of the tax base;</p>
<p>(ii) simplicity of administration; and</p>
<p>(iii) minimising compliance costs for taxpayers.</p>
<p>   * A proposal to vary the GST base by way of a Ministerial determination</p>
<p> under the GST Act and the GST Transition Act will require the</p>
<p> unanimous agreement of the Ministerial Council established under</p>
<p> clause 40. The Ministerial Council will develop practical arrangements</p>
<p> to ensure timely consideration of proposed Ministerial determinations.</p>
<p>   * During the first 12 months following the implementation of the</p>
<p> GST, the Commonwealth Government will retain the discretion to</p>
<p> make changes unilaterally to the GST base where such changes:</p>
<p>(i) are of an administrative nature (as defined in Appendix</p>
<p> E to this Agreement);</p>
<p>(ii) are necessary to facilitate the implementation of the new</p>
<p> tax; and</p>
<p>(iii) have regard to the need to protect the revenue of the States</p>
<p> and Territories.</p>
<p>   * From July 2001, changes to the GST base of an administrative</p>
<p> nature (as defined in Appendix E)</p>
<p> would require the majority support of the Commonwealth, the States</p>
<p> and the Territories.</p>
<p>Australian Taxation Office</p>
<p>  * The States and Territories will compensate the Commonwealth</p>
<p> for the agreed costs incurred by the Australian Taxation</p>
<p> Office (ATO) in administering the GST. </p>
<p>   * Accountability and performance arrangements will be established</p>
<p> between the ATO and the State and Territory Governments consistent</p>
<p> with Appendix F to this</p>
<p> Agreement. These arrangements will include maximising compliance,</p>
<p> cost efficiency, simplicity for taxpayers and administrative transparency.</p>
<p>   * The ATO and State and Territory Governments will collaborate</p>
<p> to explore options for the States and Territories to benefit from</p>
<p> the use of the Australian Business Number system.</p>
<p>Part 4  institutional arrangements</p>
<p>Establishment of Ministerial Council</p>
<p> * A Ministerial Council comprising the Commonwealth, the States</p>
<p> and the Territories will be established from 1 July 1999 to oversee</p>
<p> the operation of this Agreement.</p>
<p>   * The membership of the Ministerial Council will comprise the</p>
<p> Treasurer of the Commonwealth and the Treasurers of the States</p>
<p> and Territories (or designated representatives). </p>
<p>   * The functions of the Ministerial Council will include:</p>
<p>   * the oversight of the operation of the GST; </p>
<p>   * the oversight and coordination of the implementation of</p>
<p> this Agreement;</p>
<p>   * the review of matters of operational significance raised</p>
<p> through the GST Administration Sub-Committee;</p>
<p>   * discussion of CGC recommendations regarding relativities</p>
<p> prior to the Commonwealth Treasurer making a determination;</p>
<p>   * monitoring compliance with the conditions governing the</p>
<p> provision of assistance to first home owners set out in Appendix D</p>
<p> to this Agreement; </p>
<p>   * monitoring compliance with the Commonwealth's undertaking</p>
<p> with respect to SPPs;</p>
<p>   * considering reports of the GST Administration Sub-Committee</p>
<p> on the performance of the ATO in GST administration;</p>
<p>   * reviewing the operation of the Agreement over time and considering</p>
<p> any amendments which may be proposed as a consequence of such</p>
<p> review;</p>
<p>   * making recommendations to the Commonwealth Treasurer on</p>
<p> the Guaranteed Minimum Amount applying to each State and Territory</p>
<p> under the Transitional Arrangements;</p>
<p>   * approving changes to the GST base which require the support</p>
<p> of a majority of Commonwealth, State and Territory Governments;</p>
<p>   * considering on-going reform of Commonwealth-State financial</p>
<p> relations; and</p>
<p>   * considering other matters covered in this Agreement.</p>
<p> * The Treasurer of the Commonwealth will convene the Ministerial</p>
<p> Council in consultation with the other members of the Council</p>
<p> not less than once each financial year. If the Commonwealth Treasurer</p>
<p> receives a request from a member of the Council, he will consult</p>
<p> with the other members concerning convening a meeting. The Treasurer</p>
<p> of the Commonwealth will be the chair of the Council. The Council</p>
<p> may also conduct its business by correspondence. </p>
<p>   * All questions arising in the Ministerial Council will be determined</p>
<p> by unanimous agreement unless otherwise specified in this Agreement.</p>
<p>   * While it is envisaged that the Ministerial Council will take</p>
<p> decisions on most business arising from the operation of this</p>
<p> Agreement, major issues will be referred by the Ministerial Council</p>
<p> to Heads of Government for consideration, including under the</p>
<p> auspices of the Council of Australian Governments. </p>
<p>   * The Ministerial Council will establish a GST Administration</p>
<p> Sub-Committee comprised of Commonwealth, State and Territory officials</p>
<p> to monitor the operation of the GST, make recommendations</p>
<p> regarding possible changes to the GST base and rate and to monitor</p>
<p> the ATO's performance in GST administration. The GST Administration</p>
<p> Sub-Committee will function in accordance with the arrangements</p>
<p> set out in Appendix E to</p>
<p> this Agreement.</p>
