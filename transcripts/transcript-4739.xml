PRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT 1 UE17<br />
INTERVIEW WITH LAURIE WILSON<br />
/ saying QUESTION: Has it really been a worthwhile trip? People<br />
probably expected you to come back with something positive,<br />
some achievement, but are you able to say what that is and<br />
have you in fact achieved anything of any importance?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I think something of great importance has<br />
been achieved,-yes. Australia's view is known and Australia's<br />
view is understood in areas where it counts, where it is<br />
quite essential that our point of view be tdken into<br />
consideration. Wle have the circumstance in which the United<br />
States has guaranteed that it will walk away from the<br />
Multilateral Trade Negotiations unless agriculture is part<br />
of the final result. If agriculture is part of the final<br />
result;. as we of course argue that it must be, then that will<br />
be a major victory, because in all the major trade negotiations<br />
since the war, agriculture has been pushed aside into the<br />
" too hard" basket leaving it open to other countries to use<br />
whatever restrictive and unreasonable practices they like..<br />
inhibiting, preventing, trade in agricultural goods.<br />
QUESTION: How do you respond to the picture that's being<br />
increasingly painted of the trip of it being hastily<br />
convened and ill-conceived to a large extent?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I just don't think that's correct in any<br />
sense and I would have thought that all Australians would<br />
want Australia's view to be put with strength in these<br />
particular matters. You know, Britain entered the European<br />
commnunity a considerable time ago and we finally got excluded<br />
from European markets 1973, 1974, about that time, and my<br />
Government is the first Australian government to argue with<br />
. strength for Australia's right to export to Europe. Now<br />
some people say well don't worry about that because there's<br />
Asia. Alright, our ecports in the Asian area, the Western<br />
Pacific area have been expanding very greatly and I've got<br />
no doubt they'll continije to grow, but it happens to be in<br />
Europe that we've been up against non-tariff barriers,<br />
discriminatory trade practices of one kind or another which<br />
have not only denied us the possibility of expanding trade,<br />
it's greatly reduced trade that we had out on a traditional<br />
basis and if anyone is going to say it's alright to ignore<br />
the most affluent technologically advanced market of well<br />
over 200 million people . then they are/ something of great<br />
seriousness for many Australian industries because there are<br />
a number of industries that need access to the affluent<br />
markets of the world for their own prosperity in Australia<br />
and my Government is just not prepared to say alright we<br />
won't bother, we won't try. We are determined to press<br />
Australia's view because it is important for Australia's<br />
well being. / 2 -7 ) T<br />

<p>INTERVIEW WITH LAURIE WILSON. 19 JUNE 1978<br />

QUESTION: You've been painted as taking something of a bull<br />
at a gate approach to the Europeans and yet it certainly<br />
doesn't seem like you have achieved very much at all, if<br />
anything. Do you think perhaps, if anything, you may have<br />
forced them to dig their heels in even more?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't think so. A number of people<br />
in Europe have said that, for heavens sake, don't give up,<br />
you've got to keep pressing and they've made thp't perfectly<br />
plain. We-knew two or three days before Mr. Garland had<br />
his final meeting that the result was going to be quite<br />
unsatisfactory as far as Australia was concerned. A number<br />
of individual Community countries made it perfectly plain<br />
that they expected a very sharp response and that we will<br />
need to keep pressing. They also believe so long as we<br />
did, ultimately we would gain some kind of access. Now the<br />
support we have achieved from the United States in saying<br />
that they will walk away from the Multilateral -Trade Negotiations<br />
unless agriculture is included is obviously very important.<br />
They weren't prepared to say that during the Kennedy round<br />
and I think the prospects of some success are better than they've<br />
been. Mr. Jenkins, Presiden~ t of the Commission, told me that<br />
he knew quite well that whatever came out of MTN would mean<br />
nothing to Australia unless there was the reality and prospect<br />
of Australia being able to sell beef, for example, to the<br />
European Community. Now, that's an advance. I haven't heard<br />
Mr. ' Jenkins speaking in those terms before. The final<br />
result at Geneva comes out, or is meant to come out, in a<br />
relatively few weeks time. Many people are pressing for a<br />
final result in July. So if that happens, we'll kniow and<br />
if not, if it's an adverse result, well we will continue to<br />
press our view. But, now let me make the point again, our<br />
trade with Asia has been expanding enormously, it will continue<br />
to expand. It's not in Asia that we're up against the non-tariff<br />
barriers, the discriminatory trading practicesand if they are<br />
allowed to be pursued without any restraint, it's going to be<br />
very serious indeed for Australia. I don't think many Australians<br />
in fact understand that there are moves to break down the<br />
most-favoured nation principle in trade which means . that countries<br />
would have the right to be utterly discriminatory in what they<br />
do, and it's the most-favoured nation principle that's of<br />
enormous importance to the middle ranking coun * tries such as<br />
Australia, for the developing world countries * and as a result<br />
of my visit many more people will be aware of the dangers of<br />
what's happening and will be trying, I believe, to do something<br />
about it.<br />
QUESTION: Prime Minister, how did you feel about the coverage<br />
ot your trip. The press has been nothing if not critical,<br />
if not sceptical, of the validity of your overseas visit?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I think you put it right yourself in your<br />
own question. I think that there was too much attention on<br />
periphexa1 -matters, not enough attention on the major matters.<br />
It' s important to have the circumstances in which as an<br />
Australian Prime Minister can go overseas without being expected<br />
on each occasion to bring back a basket full of goodies. / 3 </p>
<p>INTERVIEW WITH LAURIE WILSON.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: ( continued). That's not the way in which<br />
international discussions, negotiations, are undertaken.<br />
It's important for a Prime Minister to be able to put a<br />
point of view and I believe in particular, over these last<br />
two or three weeks, if I'd not been putting Australia's<br />
view I would have been failing in a duty and obligation to<br />
all the Australian people because our well-being as a<br />
trading nationwith a very significant part of our total<br />
income dependent upon trade our well-being as a nation<br />
is going to depend whathappens as an outcome of these<br />
negotiations in Geneva. The standard of life of every<br />
Australi nwill be affected by that outcome. If people<br />
want to say that in these circumstances Australia should<br />
not press her view with all the strength and vigour at her<br />
command, then that's not a view that I can embrace.<br />
