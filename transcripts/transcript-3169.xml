SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, MR. E. G. WHITLAM, M. P.<br />
FOR THE OPENING OF THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT CENTRE, HOBART,<br />
FRIDAY$ 22 FEBRUARY 1974<br />
THIS IS THE FIRST MAJOR ADMINlISTRATIVE BUILDING<br />
ERECTED IN TASMANIA BY ANY AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT SINCE<br />
FEDERATION. THE NEED FOR THE BUILDING AROSE IN THE LATE<br />
1960s WHEN THE LACK OF SUITABLE PREMISES AVAILABLE FOR<br />
LEASING FORCED THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT TO BUY LAND<br />
AND PLAN THE BUILDING. ITS CONSTRUCTION IS VERY MUCH<br />
IN ACCORD WITH THE PRESENT GOVERNMENT'S POLICY ON OFFICIAL<br />
BUILDINGS$ THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN FAF. D WITH<br />
AN INCREASING RENT BILL WHEREVER IT 0AINTAINS OFFICES.<br />
IN MANY AREAS I. EASING HAS RESULTED IN ITS OFFICES BiNCG<br />
UNDULY SCATTERED. THE GOVERNMENT HAS THERZFORE SiATED<br />
THAT ITS FUTURE POLICY WILL FAVOUR GOVERNMENT OWNERSHIP,<br />
THE SITE FOR THE NEW AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT CENTRE<br />
IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT AS IT IS ON THE FRINGE OF HOBART'S<br />
RETAIL BUSINESS CENTRE, YET NEAR ITS EXPANDING<br />
ADMINISTRATIVE AND PROFESSIONAL CENTRE. IT IS READILY<br />
ACCESSIBLE TO THE PUBLIC USING EITtIIR PRIVATE CARS OR PUBLIC<br />
TRANSPORT$ THUS, IN THIS ONE BUILDING, THE GREATER PORTION<br />
OF THE COMMONWEALTH'S ADMINISTRATIVE AND W8LFARE SERVICES<br />
IN HOBART WILL BE EASILY AVAILABLE TO THE CITIZENS OF THE CITY.<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS TO BE HOUSED IN THE<br />
BUILDING INCLUDE SOCIAL SECURITY, IMMIGRATION AND LABOUR AND<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN TAXATION OFFICE. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
THE GOVERNMENT CENTRE, BUILT AT A COST OF $ 5,2 MILLION,<br />
IS ONE OF SEVERAL BUILDING PROJECTS PLANNED FOR HOBART BY<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT, A MULTI-STORY BUILDING IS<br />
PROPOSED ON THE SITE ADJACENT TO THE EXISTING HOBART CENTRAL<br />
TELEPHONE EXCHANGE, THE GROWTH OF THE NUMBER OF TELEPHONE<br />
SUBSCRIBERS IN THE HOBART AREA HAS PUT GREAT PRESSURE ON<br />
EXISTING FACILITIES, A MAIL EXCHANGE AND TRANSPORT COMPLEX<br />
IS ALSO PROPOSED FOR THE CITY,<br />
THE MINISTER FOR SCIENCE ANNOUNCED ON 25 JANUARY THAT<br />
THE ANTARCTIC DIVISION OF HIS DEPARTMENT WILL MOVE ITS<br />
HEADQUARTERS TO HOBART. THE DIVISION IS NOW DISPERSED OVER<br />
SIX LOCATIONS IN MELBOURNE AND HOBART, A NEW UNIFIED COMPLEX<br />
TO COST ABOUT $ 3 MILLION IS EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED IN 1977,<br />
THIS IS NOT JUST A MATTER OF MOVING BUILDINGS NOROF THEEXPENDITURE<br />
OF ABOUT $ 3 MILLION ON THE HEADQUARTERS,<br />
YOUR EXCELLENT PORT FACILITIES WILL BENEFIT FROM MOUNTING<br />
THE ANNUAL EXPEDITIONS TO THE ANTARCTIC, THE UNIVERSITY<br />
OF TASMANIA WHICH HAS HAD A LONG ASSOCIATION WITH THE DIVISION<br />
IN RESEARCH WORK ON COSMIC RAYS WILL BE IN A POSITION TO<br />
CO-OPERATE MORE CLOSELY IN OTHER AREAS OF RESEARCH AND<br />
BUILD UP ITS SCIENTIFIC REPUTATION, T; IE ENTHUSIASTIC RESPONSE<br />
OF THE VICE-CHANCELLOR, SIR GEORGE CATLAND, AND THE ACADEMIC<br />
STAFF OF THE UNIVERSITY TO THE TRANSFER OF THL DIVISION<br />
UNDERLINES THE LONG-TERM IMPORTANCE THAT THEY SEE IN MY<br />
GOVERNMENT'S DECISION, </p>
<p>WE WILL BE CO-OPERATING CLOSELY WITH THE TASMANIAN GOVERNMENT<br />
AND THE HOBART COUNCIL AND OTHER AUTHORITIES IN THE SITING<br />
AND CONSTRUCTION OF THE HEADQUARTERS, WE ARE ANXIOUS TO ADD<br />
TO AND NOT DETRACT FROM THE GREAT CHARM OF YOUR CAPITAL,<br />
IN ADDITION, A NEW MULTI-STORY BUILDING; DUE TO BE<br />
COMPLETED IN SEPTEMBER 1975, IS BEING CONSTRUCTED AT THE<br />
REPATRIATION GENERAL HOSPITAL, HOBART, AT A COST OF<br />
MILLION, THIS BUILDING WILL CONTAIN TWO THIRTY-BED<br />
WARDS PREVIOUSLY HOUSED IN 50 YEAR OLD PREMISES, PARAMEDICAL<br />
FACILITIES AND NURSING STAFF ACCOMMODATION. NURSING AIDE<br />
TRAINING WILL BE UNDERTAKEN FOR THE FIRST TIME IN TASMANIA<br />
AT TIHIS HOSPITAL. THIS TRAINING IS AT PRESENT BEING<br />
UNDERTAKEN IN VICTORIA AND, AS THIS RESULTS IN HIGH WASTAGE,<br />
THE NEW ARRANGEMENTS ARE EXPECTED TO HELP RETAIN THESE. SKILLS<br />
LOCALLY, IN LINE WITH PRESENT POLICY, ANY SPARE BED CAPACITY<br />
AT THE HOSPITAL WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE TO MEMBERS OF THE<br />
COMMUNITY GENERALLY,<br />
THE NEW BUILDING ACTIVITY IS IN LINE WITH A GENERALLY<br />
GREATER AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT EMPHASIS ON TASMANIA, IT HAS<br />
SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED ITS EXPENDITURE IN HOBART AND THE<br />
REST OF TASMANIA IN THE LAST YEAR, TOTAL PAYMENTS TO THE<br />
TASMANIAN GOVERNMENT IN 1973/ 74, FOR ALL PURPOSES AND INCLUDING<br />
THE STATE'S LOAN COUNCIL PROGRAM, ARE ESTIMATED TO TOTAL ABOUT<br />
$ 228 MILLION, </p>
<p>THIS IS AN INCREASE OF ABOUT $ 32 MILLION OR 16 PER CENT<br />
OVER PAYMENTS IN 1972/ 73, IT REPRESENTS MORE THAN $ 570<br />
PER HEAD OF POPULATION IN TASMANIA, COMPARED TO AVERAGE<br />
PAYMENTS TO ALL STATES OF ABOUT $ 337 PER HEAD. THIS IS<br />
ONE INDICATOR OF THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT'S RECOGNITION<br />
OF THE SPECIAL NEEDS AND PROBLEMS OF TASMANIA.<br />
TWO AREAS THAT HAVE BENEFITED PARTICULARLY FROM A<br />
MUCH GREATER INFUSION OF AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT FUNDS ARE<br />
HOUSING AND EDUCATION, ADVANCES TOTALLING $ 16.3 MILLION<br />
WILL BE MADE TO TASMANIA IN 1973/ 74 UNDER THE NEW HOUSING<br />
AGREEMENT WITH THE STATES. THIS IS AN INCREASE OF NO LESS<br />
THAN 82 PER CENT OVER THE CORRESPONDIN, ALLOCATION IN<br />
1972/ 73, THE PURPOSE OF THE HOUSING AGREEMENT IS TO ASSIST<br />
TASMANIA AND OTHER STATES TO PROVIDE MORE HOUSING FOR NEEDY<br />
PERSONS. FOR EDUCATION, TASMANIA IS EXPEC: TED TO RECEIVE GRpi'iFS<br />
TOTALLING ALMOST $ 19 MILLION IN 1973/ 74. THIS IS AN INCREASE<br />
OF 111 PER CENT OVER THE PRECEDING YEAR. IN 1972/ 73 THE<br />
COMPARABLE INCREASE WAS ONLY 12 PER CEN1, THIS MASSIVE<br />
INCREASE WILL PROVIDE MORE MONEY FOR UNIVERSITIES, COLLEGES<br />
OF ADVANCED EDUCATION, TEACHERS' COLLFGES, TECHNICAL COLLEGES,<br />
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOLS AND PRE-SCHOOLS, iN THE SPECIFIC<br />
FIELDS OF PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION TASMANIA WILL<br />
RECEIVE A TOTAL OF $ 20 MILLION IN 1974 AND 197j, FOLLOWING<br />
THE GENERAL ACCEPTANCE BY THE AUSTRALIAN GOVCRN I[ WNI OF THE<br />
RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE KARMEL COMMITTEE. THE FIRST PAYMENT<br />
UNDER THE STATES GRANTS ( SCHOOLS) ACT 1973 $ 962,000 FOR THE<br />
FIRST QUARTER OF 1974 HAS ALREADY BEEN MADE. </p>
<p>THIS BUILDING IS A TANGIBLE SYMBOL OF THE EXPANDED<br />
ACTIVITY OF THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT IN TASMANIA. WE HAVE<br />
DIRECTED OUR POLICIES IN THE LAST 15 MONTHS TO ENSURING<br />
THAT THIS STATE SHARES IN THE BENEFITS OF THE NEW<br />
INITIATIVES WHICH WE ARE TAKING THROUGHOUT AUSTRALIA.<br />
WE WILL CONTINUE TO DIRECT OUR POLICIES TO THAT. END.<br />
