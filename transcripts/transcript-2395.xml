COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA<br />
SPEECH BY<br />
The Rt Hon. W. McMAHON, M. P.<br />
ON<br />
CROWN OF THORNS STARFISH<br />
MiniM* sterial Statement<br />
[ From the ' Parliamentary Debates', 30 March 1971]<br />
Mr McMAHON ( Lowe-Prime Minister)<br />
-by leave-On 7th April 1970 the Government<br />
announced to the House the membership<br />
of a joint committee established<br />
by the Commonwealth and Queensland to<br />
investigate the problem of the Crown of<br />
Thorns Starfish on the Great Barrier Reef.<br />
The committee comprised:<br />
Commonwealth Nominees<br />
Professor R. J. Walsh, Professor<br />
of Human Genetics at the University of<br />
New South Wales ( Chairman).<br />
Professor W. G. Maxwell, Associate<br />
Professor of Geology at the University of<br />
Sydney. Mr D. J. Tranter, Senior Research<br />
Scientist, Division of Fisheries and<br />
Oceanography, Commonwealth Scientific<br />
and Industrial Research Organisation.<br />
Queensland Nominees<br />
Dr J. M. Harvey, Director-General of<br />
Primary Industries.<br />
Professor J. M. Thomson, Professor of<br />
Zoology at the Queensland University.<br />
Mr C. L. Harris, of the Department of<br />
Primary Industries.<br />
The announcement of the committee's<br />
membership followed agreement reached<br />
on 29th January 1970 by both Governments<br />
that such a committee be established<br />
and that it should be financed on a dollar<br />
for dollar basis by each Government.<br />
11942/ 71 I am pleased to be able to tell the House<br />
that on last Thursday, 25th March, the<br />
Chairman of the Committee, Professor<br />
Walsh, reported to me on the results of<br />
the committee's work. In view of the<br />
importance of the report and of the widespread<br />
interest which has been taken in its<br />
progress I arranged for Cabinet to consider<br />
the report today and for the report to be<br />
tabled so that honourable members will be<br />
able to inform themselves fully of its conclusions,<br />
and of the reasons underlying<br />
these conclusions. Honourable members will<br />
be aware of the very deep concern which is<br />
felt by many about the possibility of<br />
destruction to the Great Barrier Reef by<br />
the crown of thorns starfish. This concern<br />
has been deepened for many by the belief<br />
that perhaps complete destruction of the<br />
Reef was inevitable unless early Government<br />
action was taken. Some have suggested<br />
that it may now be too late to save the<br />
Reef. It is therefore pertinent to draw to<br />
honourable members' attention a reference<br />
in the Committee's report to articles in the<br />
Press and in semi-technical journals on the<br />
starfish as being either repetitive presentations<br />
of eye-catching speculations or<br />
exaggerations of the limited facts available.<br />
Some of the confusion appears to have<br />
occurred because the available methods of<br />
estimating population densities of the starfish<br />
are rather crude. Extrapolations from<br />
these results are not reliable and are of<br />
doubtful value. Also overlooked has been </p>
<p>the fact that the published figures of the<br />
proportion of dead coral on reefs attacked<br />
by the starfish have included an estimated<br />
to 50 per cent of corals kiled by other<br />
means-such deaths being a normal state<br />
of affairs. Analogies have been drawn<br />
between the action which had been taken<br />
on Guam and the situation in the Great<br />
Barrier Reef. On Guam, teams of divers<br />
were used to combat the starfish. Some felt<br />
that a similar operation should be mounted<br />
on the Great Barrier Reef. Such suggestions<br />
overlooked the fact that Guam has a<br />
comparatively simple reef surrounding it,<br />
around which the starfish were said to<br />
move, limited on one side by the island<br />
beach and on the other by the sea proper,<br />
whereas the Great Barrier Reef is of a<br />
size and a complexity which makes similar<br />
generalised action to that taken on Guam<br />
ineffective. In the light of the wide differences of<br />
authoritative opinion as to the threat, if<br />
any, which the starfish posed to the Great<br />
Barrier Reef the Commonwealth considered<br />
it necessary to obtain more facts before any<br />
further action was taken to deal with the<br />
starfish beyond that already set in train by<br />
the Queensland Government and to which<br />
reference is made in the Committee's<br />
report. The Great Barrier Reef is perhaps<br />
the most complex eco-system known to<br />
man and many experts considered that it<br />
would have been irresponsible for<br />
generalised action to be taken before knowing<br />
the likely consequences of such action<br />
upon the chain of life which comprises the<br />
Reef as we know it. As to the results of<br />
the Committee's investigations the Committee<br />
has found that:<br />
the crown of thorns starfish does not<br />
constitute a threat to the Great Barrier<br />
Reef as a whole;<br />
there is no danger of substantial erosion<br />
of the physical structure of the reef; and<br />
there is no threat to the Queensland<br />
coastline or ports.<br />
The entire living cover, or even a large<br />
proportion of the coral cover, of the Reef<br />
will not disappear as a result of the crown<br />
of thorns starfish. Whilst there has been<br />
extensive damage to coral because of the<br />
starfish, serious damage is limited. Recolonisation<br />
and regeneration of coral have<br />
occurred on all reefs examined by the<br />
Committee. The Committee has not been able to determine whether the high density<br />
of starfish in some areas is a unique or a<br />
cyclical phenomenon but it appears more<br />
likely to be an episodic event which may<br />
have occurred previously.<br />
The Committee refers to the fact that the<br />
feeding by the crown of thorns on living<br />
coral constitutes, in the long term, part of<br />
the reef building process, whereby dead<br />
material is consolidated in order to provide<br />
the platforrm necessary for the Reef's continued<br />
growth. Tourist activity has not<br />
declined as a result of the starfish damage.<br />
The Committee cannot give the reason for<br />
the population increase of crown of thorns<br />
starfish in some areas. It reports that the<br />
hypothesis that local collection of triton<br />
shells has reduced predator pressure on the<br />
starfish has not been substantiated nor has<br />
the hypothesis that pesticides and other<br />
organic chemicals may have -been causal.<br />
The Committee believes that there is no need<br />
to attempt to reduce the population of the<br />
crown of thorns starfish throughout the<br />
whole of the Great Barrier Reef at the<br />
present time. It does not dispute that certain<br />
reefs or portions of reefs having social or<br />
commercial importance may be protected<br />
by manual destruction of accessible starfish.<br />
The Committee finds that present knowledge<br />
of reef ecology is inadequate to assess<br />
fully present and future problems concerning<br />
the crown of thorns starfish and related<br />
matters. It therefore suggests a programme<br />
of research involving continued monitoring 7<br />
of starfish population; research into reef<br />
ecology, with particular attention to the<br />
biology of the starfish and corals; and experiments<br />
in local control of the starfish. To<br />
achieve this program-me it recommends that<br />
a sum of money of the order of $ 90,000 to<br />
$ 120,000 be provided in the first year to<br />
allow such research and that the sum provided<br />
be increased progressively in each of<br />
the second and third years at which time<br />
there would be a review in the light of the<br />
operation of the Australian Institute of<br />
Marine Science. As I have already mentioned,<br />
Cabinet has considered the recommendations<br />
of the Committee. I am pleased<br />
to be able to say that -the Government agrees<br />
with the recommendations of the Committee.<br />
I have been in touch with the<br />
Queensland Premier and we have agreed<br />
that $ 45,000 be allocated on a matching<br />
basis by each Government for research </p>
<p>projects recommended in its first year by<br />
an advisory committee. The advisory committee<br />
would report to the Minister for<br />
Education and Science, who will act on<br />
behalf of both Governments. This amount<br />
will be increased by $ 10,000 by each<br />
Government in each of the second and<br />
third years. Each Government is prepared<br />
to increase its grant on a matching basis to the upper limits recommended by the report<br />
if the advisory committee finds in practice<br />
that it has sufficiently good research projects<br />
to warrant this. I shall announce the membership<br />
of the advisory committee as soon<br />
as possible.<br />
I present the following paper:<br />
