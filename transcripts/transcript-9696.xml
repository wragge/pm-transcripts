PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
TWO MINUTES SILENCE<br />
I urge all Australians to observe two minutes silence at midday ( Eastern<br />
Standard Time) next Tuesday August 15 to mark the 50th Anniversary of<br />
Victory in the Pacific Day.<br />
By observing the two minute silence in capital cities, regional centres, country<br />
towns and in the suburbs, we will all express our gratitude to those men and<br />
women who defended freedom and democracy, and delivered peace to<br />
Australia. Together, during those two minutes, we can reflect on the achievements of<br />
the men and women between 1939 and 1945 who united in this great cause.<br />
Approximately 40,000 names of Australians who died during the war are<br />
recorded on the Roll of Honour at the Australian War Memorial. About one<br />
million people were under arms and many more people worked tirelessly to<br />
sustain the war effort at home and bring up-families.<br />
Many communities around Australia have already incorporated two minutes<br />
of silence at midday in their VP-Day calendar. I understand some<br />
communities have decided to sound air raid sirens before the two minute<br />
silence as a gesture to mark those war years.<br />
I hope State and Territory Governments, Local Governments, the business<br />
community, church leaders and the union movement will support the two<br />
minute silence and encourage the people of Australia to unite again for this<br />
important 50th anniversary of the end of World War II.<br />
CANBERRA 11 AUGUST 1995 </p>
