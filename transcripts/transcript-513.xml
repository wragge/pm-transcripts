The Prime Minister, Mro Menzies, announced today that<br />
the Minister for Immigration, Mr. Downer, would leave on Tuesday,<br />
22nd May, for a quick visit to Britain and Europe.<br />
Mr. Downer would study the problems of migration at<br />
first hand and discuss future prospects and arrangements in a<br />
number of countries with which Australia has migration<br />
agreements, now due for revision.<br />
En route, Mr. Downer would visit ' lashington briefly to<br />
discuss general migration problems with United States authorities<br />
preparatory to visiting the Geneva headquarters of the Inter-<br />

Nations High Commission for Refugees.<br />
His itinerary would include London, The Hague, Paris,<br />
Cologne, Rome and Madrid. In Madrid, Mr. Downer would discuss<br />
the operations of Australia's first migration mission in Spain<br />
and investigate the likelihood of attracting a stream of suitable<br />
Spanish migrants to this country in the coming years.<br />
" Since Mr. Downer's last visit three years ago, there<br />
have been considerable changes in the countries from which most<br />
of our migrants come", Mr. Menzias said.<br />
" These changes, which include the return of prosperity<br />
to Europe and the development of the Common Market aims, are<br />
altering the character of Australian immigration and demand<br />
immediate attention in formulating our future plans.<br />
" For, whatevertho changes ovcrs3as, Australia must<br />
continue to maintain a steady flow of migrants at a satisfactory<br />
level" Mr. Menzies said.<br />
Mr. Downer would leave Sydney by Qantas at 7 p. m. on<br />
Tuesday. The Ministo2 for Air, Mr. Bury, would act as Minis--, ei<br />
