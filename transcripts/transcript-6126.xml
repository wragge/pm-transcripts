A1f THE STATE DINNER GIVEN BY THE RIGHT HONOURABLE<br />
MICHAEL T. SOMARE, CHP MPP PRIME MINISTER OF<br />
PAPUA NEW GUINEA<br />
2 June 1983<br />
I THINK IT SHOULD BE SAID THAT THE DECISION TO MAKE PAPUA NEW GUINEA THE<br />
FIRST PRIORITY IN ANY OVERSEAS VISIT I SHOULD UNDERTAKE AS PRIME MINISTER OF<br />
AUSTRALIA WAS THE FIRST DECISION OF ANY INTERNATIONAL IMPORTANCE WE MADE AS<br />
A GOVERNMENT. IN FACTP IT WAS A DECISION TAKEN IN PRINCIPLE EVEN BEFORE WE FORMED<br />
A GOVERNMENT. ON THE AUSTRALIAN ELECTION NIGHT OF THE FIFTH OF MARCH,-PRIME<br />
MINISTER SOMARE WAS THE FIRST HEAD OF GOVERNMENT TO MAKE PERSONAL CONTACT AND<br />
CONGRATULATE THE AUSTRALIAN LABOR PARTY ON OUR VICTORY.<br />
IN A NIGHT CROWDED WITH RICH MlEMORIES, THERE IS NOTHING I VALUE MORE<br />
HIGHLY. WE BOTH AGREED THEN TO EXCHANGE VISITS AT THE EARLIEST OPPORTUNITY.<br />
ACCORDINGLY THIS IS MY FIRST PORT-OF-CALL, ON MY FIRST OFFICIAL VISIT OVERSEAS<br />
AS PRIME MINISTER OF AUSTRALIA.<br />
BUT THIS VISIT HAS A PERSONAL SIGNIFICANCE AND MEANING FOR ME AND AISO<br />
ITS<br />
MOR MY WIFE WHICH GOES BEYOND/ FORMAL AND OFFICIAL ASPECTSP FUNDAMENTALLY<br />
IMPORTANT TO BOTH OUR COUNTRIES AS THEY ARE.<br />
WE BOTH VALUE MORE THAN WORDS CAN SAY THE CLOSE ASSOCIATIONS' AMD<br />
FRIENDSHIPS WE HAVE DEVELOPED OVER MANY YEARS IN PAPUA NEW GUINEA NOT THE<br />
LEAST OF COURSE.-WITH PRIME MINISTER SOMARE HIMSELF.<br />
IT IS AN ASSOCIATION WHICH GOES BACK NEARLY SEVENTEEN YEARS AND ONE<br />
WHICH, IN EVERY SENSE.-HAS CONTINUED TO RIPEN AND DEEPEN YEAR BY YEAR.<br />
REFERENCES ARE FREQUENTLY MADE TO THE HISTORIC PUBLIC SERVICE<br />
ASSOCIATION CASE OF 1966-67.<br />
AND IT IS TRUE THAT THE LOCAL OFFICERS CASE WAS OF SEMINAL IMPORTANCE<br />
-THAT SEEDS WERE SOWN WHICH ULTIMATELY FLOWERED IN THE ACHIEVEMENT OF INDEPENDENCE<br />
FOR PAPUA NEW GUINEA. </p>
<p>BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT I WAS PRIVILEGED TO BE INVOLVED AS AN ADVOCATE IN<br />
THAT CASE, THE LEARNING PROCLSS THE PROCESS OF ACQUIRING KNOWLEDGE AND SHARING.<br />
KNOWLEDGE WAS VERY MUCH A TWO-WAY AWAIR.<br />
I THINK EVERYONE ASSOCIATED WITH THE CASE SHARED IN A HEIGHTENING OF<br />
CONSCIOUSNESS AND, FOR SOME AUSTRALIANS AT LEAST, AN AWAKENING OF CONSCIENCE<br />
ABOUT THE TRUE NATURE OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN AUSTRALIAN AND PAPUA NEW GUINEA,<br />
AS IT THEN EXISTED, AND THE GREAT HUMAN, SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC PROBLEMS INVOLVED<br />
IN THAT RELATIONSHIP. SPEAKING FOR MYSELF, I CAN ONLY SAY THAT I LEARNT MUCH MORE,' FROM THAT<br />
EXPERIENCE THAN I WAS EVER ABLE TO IMPART TO OTHERS. I AM FOREVER GRATEFUL TO<br />
THOSE MEN AND WOMEN IN PAPUA NEW GUINEA AT THAT TIME WHO TAUGHT ME SO MUCH.<br />
WE MAY ACKNOWLEDGE, IN RETROSPECT, THAT THE LOCAL OFFICERS CASE WASTECHNICALLY<br />
A FAILURE: AND WITH THE WISDOM OF HINDSIGHT-BY WHICH EVERYONE CAN<br />
BE COUNTED WISE THE SETBACK WAS FOR THE BEST, IN TERMS OF THE STABILITY AND<br />
VIABILITY OF AN INDEPENDENT PAPUA NEW GUINEA.<br />
BUT FAILURE OR NOT, ITS CONSEQUENCES WERE TO BE OF TREMENDOUS SIGNIFICANCE.<br />
IT IS NO COINCIDENCE THAT SO MANY OF THOSE INVOLVED IN THE CASE ON<br />
BOTH SIDES-HAVE BECOME THE LEADERS OF AN INDEPENDENT PAPUA NEW GUINEA. THE<br />
LIST OF WITNESSES IS A VERITABLE WHO'S WHO OF PNG INDEPENDENCE.<br />
NOR WAS IT A COINCIDENCE THAT PANGU WAS FORMED SOON AFTER A POLITICAL<br />
DEVELOPMENT WHICH HAS A PARALLEL IN THE FORMATION OF THE AUSTRALIAN LABOR PARTY<br />
S A DIRECT RESULT OF ANOTHER INDUSTRIAL FAILURE THE FAILURE OF THE GREAT STRIKES<br />
OF j3O BUT PERHAPS ITS MOST IMPORTANT CONSEQUENCE WAS THE REAPPRAISAL IT FORCED<br />
AUSTRALIANS SOME AUSTRALIANS AT LEAST TO MAKE ABOUT OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH PAPUA<br />
NEW GUINEA AND OUR ROLE IN PAPUA NEW GUINEA.<br />
FOR SOME, IT WAS AN AGONISING REAPPRAISAL.<br />
BUT FROM 1967 ON, WE SAW, IN AUSTRALIA, AND IN THE AUSTRALIAN PARLIAMENT,<br />
THE FIRST CRACKS APPEARING IN THE WALL OF WHAT WAS CALLED 81-PARTISANSHIP WITH REGARD<br />
TO AUSTRALIA'S ROLE IN PAPUA NEW GUINEA AN ESSENTIALLY SPURIOUS BI-PARTISANSHIP,<br />
A BI-PARTISA! NSAIPOF SILENCE, A BI-PARISA'SHIP OF INDIFFERENCE.<br />
THIS PHONEY E3-PARTISANSHIP SERVED MAINLY TO ENTRENCH EXISTING<br />
ATTITUDES AND INTERESTS. </p>
<p>F -3-<br />
FOR THE FIRST TIME AFTER 1967, AUSTRALIANS BEGAN TO QUESTION WHAT<br />
II-L<br />
THE POLITICIANS AND/ ADMINISTRATORS WERE DOING IN THEIR NAME IN THIS COUNTRY.<br />
AND ONCE THAT QUESTIONING BEGAN BOTH HERE AND IN AUSTRALIA<br />
THE MOVE rOMUM INDEPENDENCE TOOK ON AN IRRESISTIBLE MOMENTUM A MOMENTUM<br />
WHICH WAS GIVEN SHAPE.-SUBSTANCE AND DIRECTION BY LEADERS LIKE MICHAEL SOMARE<br />
HERE, AND, IN AUSTRALIAo LIKE GOUGH WHITLAM.<br />
I SAID JUST NOW THAT THE BIPARTISANSHIP WHICH EXISTED IN,-AUSTRALIA<br />
PRIOR TO 1967 WAS ESSENTIALLY PHONEY AND SPURIOUS. IT WAS CERTAINL fY A NEGATIVE<br />
SORT O-f BIPARTISANSHIP THE BIPARTISANSHIP OF APATHY, INDIFFERENCE AND TO A LARGE<br />
EXTENT., IGNORANCE. BUT THERE IS NOW A NEW AND POSITIVE BIPARTISANSHIP IN AUSTRALIAA<br />
BIPARTISANSHIP FIRMLY BASED ON A COMMON RECOGNITION OF THE PRIMARY IMPORTANCE<br />
OF THE CLOSE AND ENDURING RELATIONS BETWEEN OUR TWO INDEPENDENT NATIONS, AS<br />
EQUAL PARTNERS IN OUR REG-LON.<br />
THE PRESENT LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION IN AUSTRALIA, ANDREW PEACOCK,<br />
HIMSEL F PLAYED A VITAL ROLE IN THE PROCESS WHICH LED TO INDEPENDENCE; AND FOR 1THE<br />
MOST OF THE LIFE OF THE PREVIOUS AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT, THE PIVOTAL ROLE IN<br />
ESTABLISHING AND CEMENTING THE RELATIONSHIP WHICH NOW EXISTS BETWEEN US AS TWO<br />
INDEPENDENT NATIONS, PARTNERS AND NEIGHBOURS.<br />
SO AT THE PERSONAL AND POLITICAL LEVEL, THERE IS NOTHING AT ALL SPURIOUS<br />
ABOUT THE NEW BIPARTISAN RELATIONSHIP TOWARDS PAPUA NEW GUINEA. IT IS DEEP. IT<br />
IS GENUINE. IT WILL ENDURE.<br />
SO IN A VERY REAL SENSE, I CAN SPEAK IN PORT MORESBY NOT ONLY ON BEHALF<br />
OF THE GOVERNMENT OF AUSTRALIA BUT ON BEHALF OF THE PARLIAMENT OF AUSTRALIA AND<br />
ALL THE PEOPLE OF AUSTRALIA.<br />
BUT SPEAKING SPECIFICALLY FOR THE GOVERNMENT, WE HAVE ALREADY ESTABLISHED<br />
A PATTERN OF CONSULTATION AND CO-OPERATION AND PERSONAL CONTACT WHICH I AM<br />
CONFIDENT WILL CONTINUE TO CHARACTERISE OUR RELATIONSHIP FOR MANY YEARS TO COME.<br />
MY FOREIGN MIN4ISTER, MR HAYDENP HAS ALREADY VISITED PAPUA NEW GUINEA.<br />
HIS VISIT ALSO WAS MADE THE MORE FRUITFUL THROUGH HIS LONG AND CLOSE PERSONAL<br />
ASSOCIATION WITH PAPUA NEW GUINEA. t ' wan-~ v.' ir~ </p>
<p>A VISIT BY THE DEFENCE MINISTER.-MR SCiO. LES IS PLANNED FOR LATER THIS MONTH.<br />
I LOOK FORWARD IN PARTICULAR TO WELCOMING MR SOMARE TO CANBERRA FOR THE<br />
SOUTH PACIFIC FORUM MEETING IN AUGUST.<br />
I WOULD BE UNWILLING TO CHARACTERISE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PAPUA NEW<br />
GUINEA AND AUSTRALIA AS A" SPECIAL" RELATIONSHIP. SUCH DESCRIPTIONS TEND TOO<br />
OFTEN TO CONVEY OVERTONES OF PATRONAGE OR CONDESCENSION,, AND THE EXPERIENCE<br />
OF ' SPECIAL RELATIONSHIPS" AROUND THE WORLD HAS NOT BEEN ALTOGETHER HAPPY.<br />
RATHER, I WOULD SAY THAT THE RANGE OF OUR COMMON INTERESTS -ECONOMIC.-<br />
STRATEGIC, POLITICAL, SOCIAL AND REGIONAL, AS WELL AS THE ASSOCIATIONS OF HISTORY<br />
AND GEOGRAPHY DO MAKE OUR RELATIONSHIP EXCEPTIONAL, AND EXCEPTIONALLY IMPORTANT,<br />
OR BOTH OUR COUNTRIES.<br />
A PRINCIPAL FEATURE OF THIS EXCEPTIONAL RELATIONSHIP IS THE PLACE WE SHARE<br />
IN TWO OF THE WORLD'S REGIONS OF TREMENDOUS EMERGING SIGNIFICANCE.<br />
WE BOTH BELONG TO THE SOUTH PACIFIC REGION. WE BOTH BELONG TO THE WEST<br />
PACIFIC REGION THE FASTEST GROWING ECONOMIC REGION IN THE WORLD TODAY.<br />
IN THIS CONTEXT.-I WV-TO STRESS THE IMPORTANCE MY NEW GOVERNMENT<br />
PLACES ON THE SOUJ11H PACIFIC FORUM NOT ONLY THE FORUM WHICH IS TO HAVE ITS<br />
FOURTEENTH MEETING IN CANBERRA IN AUGUST.-BUT WHAT THE FORUM REPRESENTS.<br />
IT REPRESENTS OUR RIGHT THE RIGHT OF THE PEOPLES OF THE SOUTH PACIFICHAVE<br />
OUR VOICE HEARD IN MATTERS VITALLY AFFECTING OUR FATE AND FUTURE, AND THE<br />
FUTURE, THE VERY LIVES, OF OUR CHILDREN.<br />
OUR VOICE THE VOICE OF THE PEOPLES OF TH4E SOUTH PACIFIC DEMANDS<br />
TO BE HEARD ON PRESSING POLITICAL ISSUES LIKE THE FUTURE OF NEW CALEDONIA.<br />
WE DEMAND TO BE HEARD ON QUESTIONS CONCERNING NUCLEAR TESTING AND THE<br />
DUMPING OF NUCLEAR WASTE QUESTIONS THAT ARE LITERALLY A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH<br />
FOR THIS GENERATION AND FOR GENERATIONS YET UNBORN.<br />
4 OF COURSE, THE IMPORTANCE OF THE FORUM GOES FURTHER, TO A WIDE RANGE OF<br />
PRACTICAL MATTERS. IT H4AS MADE SIGNIFICANT ADVANCES IN AREAS OF IMPORTANCE TO </p>
<p>THE REGION's DEVELOPMENT FISHERIkS.-TRADE.-SHIPPING AND AVIATION.<br />
AUSTRALIA IS CLOSELY INVOLVED IN CO-OPERATION IN THE REGION IN THE<br />
MATTERS OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT.-TRADE PROMOTION,, AND DEFENCE.<br />
MY GOVERNMENT HAS REAFFIRMED THE PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT'S DECISION TO<br />
INTRODUCE A NEW FIVE-YEAR $ 300 MILLION AID PROGRAM FOR THE SOUTH PACIFIC REGION.<br />
THE IMPORTANCE AUSTRALIA ATTACHES TO THE ROLE THAT IT CAN'PLAY IN THE<br />
SOUTH PACIFIC SHOULD IN NO WAY BE THOUGHT TO REPRESENT ANY IDEA OF OUR SELF-IMPORTANCE.<br />
WE OPPOSE THE IDEA OF HEGEMONY ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD: AND WE ARE CERTAINLY NOT IN THE<br />
BUSINESS OF SEEKING IT FOR OURSELVES IN OUR OWN REGION.<br />
WE SEEK A RELATIONSHIP BASED ON MUTUAL CONFIDENCE, CONSULTATION AND<br />
CO-OPERATION AS BETWEEN EQUAL PARTNERS IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC.<br />
AND OUR APPROACH TO OUR WIDER RELATIONSHIP WITH THE SOUTH PACIFIC<br />
CERTAINLY APPLIES TO OUR BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP WITH PAPUA NEW GUINEA.<br />
I I SHOULD BRIEFLY MENTION TWO IMPORTANT BILATERAL MATTERS TORRES<br />
STRAIT: AND AID.<br />
THE TREATY RELATING TO THE TORRES STRAIT, WHICH WAS SIGNED IN DECEMBER<br />
1978, WAS THE OUTCOME OF DETAILED AND COMPLEX NEGOTIATIONSP AND IN ITSELF<br />
REFLECTS THE CLOSE CO-OPERATIVE SPIRIT BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES.<br />
I AM HOWEVERP CONSCIOUS OF THE FACT THAT THE TREATY HAS YET TO BE RATIFIED.<br />
I WISH TONIGHT TO AFFIRM MY GOVERNMENT'S DETERMINATION TO RATIFY THE TREATY<br />
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.<br />
SECOND.-I THINK<br />
AID TO PAPUA NEW GUINEA<br />
RELATIONSHIP SYMBOLISES<br />
RESPONSIBILITY WHICH HAVE IT CAN BE FAIRLY SAID THAT THE NATURE OF AUSTRALIA'S<br />
BETTER THAN ANY OTHER ASPECT OF OUR MANY-SIDED<br />
THE MUTUAL TRUST.-CONFIDENCE AND SENSE OF MUTUAL<br />
CHARACTERISED OUR RELATIONSHIP SINCE INDEPENDENCE.<br />
WE APPRECIATE THE ECONOMIC DIFFICULTIES THAT HAVE LED PAPUA NEW GUINEA<br />
* TO REQUEST A VARIATION IN THE CURRENT ARRANGEMENTS. A DECISIOIN,, ANNOUNCED<br />
IBY BILL HAYDEN ] DRING HIS VISIT.-TO MAKE AN ADDITIONAL $ 10 MILLION AVAILABLE<br />
AS AN UNTIED CASH GRANT FOR 1982-83 REFLECTS THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT'S<br />
CONCERN TO HELP THE GOVERNMENT OF PAPUA NEW GUINEA SUSTAIN A SOUND PROGRAM OF ECONOMIC<br />
MANAGEMENT AND STABILITY, UNTIL THE TERMS OF AUSTRALIA'S RESPONSE TO PAPUA NEW / 6<br />
li </p>
<p>GUINEA'S REQUEST COULD BE FULLY CONSIDERED.<br />
MR SOMARE AND I DISCUSSED THE AID ARRANGEMENTS THIS AFTERNOON. WE AGREED<br />
ON IMPORTANT CHANGES FOR THE REMAINING THREE YEARS OF THE FIVE-YEAR AGREEMENT.<br />
THE ARRANGEMENTS ESTABLISHED BY THE FRASER AND CHAN GOVERNMENTS IN 1980 WERE<br />
SOUND IN PRINCIPLE.-AND SATISFACTORY FOR THE CIRCUMSTANCES AS THEY THEN APPEARED.<br />
THEY PROVIDED FOR UNTIED CASH GRANTS TO BE MADE AVAILABLE UNDER A FORMULA THAT<br />
IN RECOGNITION OF THE HUGE CHANGE IN PAPUA NEW GUINEA'S CIRCUMSTANCESt AND OF<br />
PAPUA NEW GUINEA'S OWN EFFORTS TO COMBAT THE EFFECTS OF INTERNATIOkAL RECESSION<br />
WITH DOMESTIC RESTRAINTP THE RATE OF REDUCTION OF AID OVER THE REMAINING THREE<br />
YEARSM~ ILL BE 1 PER CENT, 2 PER CENT.-AND 3 PER CENT.<br />
IN RECOGNITION OF AUSTRALIA'S OWN BUDGETARY PROBLEMS, WE HAVE AGREED<br />
THAT THE REDUCTION IN4 THE RATE OF AID SHOULD BE INCREASED AGAIN SHOULD IMPROVEMENTS<br />
1IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN PAPUA NEW GUINEA MAKE THIS POSSIBLE WITHOUT THREATENING<br />
THE RESTORATION OF ECONOMIC STABILITY AND GROWTH. THESE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE NEWLY<br />
AGREED RATES OF DECLINE IN AID WILL BE MADE AUTOMATICALLY IF PAPUA NEW GUINEA'S<br />
MINERAL REVENUES EXCEED SPECIFIED LEVELS OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS.<br />
MR PRIME MINISTER, DISTINGUISHED GUESTSt FRIENDS ALL, I THANK YOU AGAIN<br />
FOR YOUR WELCOME TO PAPUA NEW GUINEA, AND THE WARMTH OF THE FRIENDSHIP AND<br />
HOSPITALITY SHOWN TO ME, MY WIFE AND MY PARTY.<br />
BECAUSE OF THE LONG ASSOCIATIONS I MENTIONED EARLIER, AND THE MANY CLOSE<br />
FRIENDSHIPS WE HAVE FORMED OVER THE YEARSP IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT I SHOULD MAKE<br />
ANY VISIT TO PORT MORESBY AND PAPUA NEW GUINEA WITHOUT SOME GLOW OF NOSTALGIA.<br />
AND REMEMBRANCES OF THINGS PASTt ON OCCASIONS LIKE THISt ARE OF COURSE MADE<br />
RATHER THE WARMER WHEN WE REFLECT ON THE CHANGE IN POLITICAL AND PERSONAL FORTUNES<br />
WHICH HAVE BROUGHT MICHAEL AND MYSELF TOGETHER IN THIS PLACE IN OUR RESPECTIVE<br />
POSITIONS. FOR BOTH OF US, AT THE VERY LEAST, IT HAS BEEN AN INTERESTING TWELVE<br />
MONTHS. BUT IT IS NOT REALLY TO THE PAST THAT EITHER OF US LOOK -IN PERSONAL TERMS OR<br />
POLITICAL TERMS, OR IN TERMS OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES. WE<br />
LOOK TO THE FUTURE. AND DESPITE THE MANY DIFFICULTIES WHICH BOTH OUR COUNTRIES<br />
ARE NOW EXPERIENCING, WH] ICH BOTH OUR COUNTRIES AND GOVERNMENTS ARE TACKLING IN A<br />
BOLD AND POSITIVE WAY, WE CAN HAVE EVERY CONFIDENCE -I CERTAINLY HAVETHAT<br />
THE FUTURE HOLDS TREMENDOUS PROMISE FOR THE WELLBEING, PROGRESS AND STABILITY<br />
OF THESE TWO GREAT COUNTRIES PAPUA NEW GUINEA AND AUSTRALIA, SO DIFFERENT IN SO<br />
MANY WAYS, BUT SHARING IN SO MANY IMPORTANT ASSOCIATIONS, HISTORICAL.-GEOGRAPHICAL,<br />
REGIONAL, INSTITUTIONAL -SO MUCH IN COMMON.<br />
