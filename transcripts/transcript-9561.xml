PRIME MINISTER 38/ 95<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
VISIT TO JAPAN<br />
I am pleased to announce that I will make my first official visit to Japan from 24 to 28<br />
May. I will meet their Majesties, the Emperor and Empress, and renew my productive<br />
working relationship with Prime Minister Murayama and other senior members of the<br />
Japanese Government. I will also have discussions with key Japanese business leaders.<br />
This important anniversary year of the end of World War 11 provides an opportunity to<br />
reflect on the unique partnership we have forged together over the past fifty years and<br />
where we might take it in the 21 st century.<br />
Japan is by far our largest trading partner as well as a major source of technology and<br />
investment. In 1994 two-way trade between us was worth $ 28 billion. Through years<br />
of human contact at all levels, our two countries have developed a genuine spirit of<br />
friendship. Our relationship has become a significant and positive force in regional<br />
and global affairs.<br />
With Prime Minister Murayama I will be discussing ways of ensuring the relationship<br />
between Australia and Japan maintains its vitality. We will also discuss our important<br />
common interests in the region, particularly AiPEC which Japan chairs this year. Both<br />
our governments are strongly committed to a substantive outcome at the Osaka<br />
Leaders' meeting in November.<br />
During my visit I will open an Australian Business Centre, bringing representative and<br />
tourist offices of the Australian states together with Austrade into one commercial hub.<br />
In the spirit of the Australia Remembers commemorative year, I will attend a special<br />
ceremony at Hodogaya Cemetery and pay tribute to those Australian and other<br />
Commonwealth servicemen and women who are buried there.<br />
