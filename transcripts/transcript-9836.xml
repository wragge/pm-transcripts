TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
DOORSTOP, MILLBROOK RESORT, QUEENSTOWN,<br />
12 NOVEMBER 1995<br />
ElOE PROOF COPY<br />
J: Prime Minister, what concrete acton Is Australia going to take over tihe<br />
Nigerian Issue?<br />
PM: In the first Instance, we will be withdrawing our Ambassador to show<br />
our anger and our objection to this sort of behaviour, the denial of<br />
human rights and human values In Nigeria and, of course, I have been<br />
part of the majority here the overwhelming majority of<br />
Commonwealth Leaders which has made clear that Nigeria will be<br />
suspended from the Commontwealth until it demonstrates that It has<br />
had a change of heart and a change In the way in which the country<br />
Operates and is moving back towards civilian government.<br />
J, What impact does suspension have, I mean, how does this hurt<br />
Nigeria?<br />
PM: There are two things, I think. This was a test of the Commonweafth's<br />
moral authority. The Commonwealth's moral authority has been<br />
Important in Zimbabwe. It has been important in removing the racially<br />
based government of South Africa, the policy of apartheid. On that<br />
occasion It introduced economic sanctions which were completely<br />
effective. I might just say John Howard today on television, said that he<br />
doesn't regret not Supporting economic sanctions against South Africa.<br />
Let me record that, had those sanctions not been used,<br />
Nelson Mandela would not be at this meeting today. He would not be<br />
at this meeting as the President of South Africa, but for the fact that the<br />
Labor Government in Australia and other like-minded governments<br />
around the world employed economic sanctions against South Africa.<br />
Now, these opions always exist for other countries. The<br />
Commonwealth has no constitutional authority over sovereign<br />
countries, but it is a very large representative group of countries and It<br />
does have moral authority. Its moral authority would not have been </p>
<p>maintained were it to be, In a sense, scrubbed, defied by the<br />
Government of Nigeria in executing these nine people. The fact that<br />
they were executed means, I think, that the Commonwealth had to act<br />
and the Commonwealth has acted.<br />
J: What sort of a push was there for expulsion?<br />
PM; Not very much, in fact none. Because with expulsion there Is no<br />
Incentive to return and there Is no continuing link withl the country.<br />
Whereas with suspension, we can keep that pressure on. That<br />
pressure has been kept on a number of Countries in the past and most<br />
obviously, of course, South Africa.<br />
J. Any indication from the Nigerian Foreign Minister as to whether they will<br />
take up any of that Incentive as you say?<br />
PM: Well, I think, thy wil1 have to think about their position and no doubt,<br />
I think, probably today, we will think further about what might be done.<br />
But we did adopt yesterday a set of principles around the H~ arare<br />
Declaration which will be applied now, I think, consistently over time to<br />
any Countries that break the conventions of decent behaviour In<br />
government or human rights.<br />
J: Will we be expelling Nigeria's legation from Australia?<br />
PMV: We are withdrawing our Ambassador tor consultations and we will<br />
consider where we go from there, but this Is very strong action by the<br />
Commonwealth in suspending Nigeria and it wes unanimous bar two<br />
countries.<br />
J: What countries were they Prime Minister?<br />
PM: The Solomon Islands and Gambia.<br />
J: What further actions would you like to see taken against Nigeria to give<br />
some efec to what you ame hoping to achieve?<br />
PM: The problem here is the question again of the nation state. Countries<br />
which are calWe nations are often a Collection of regional areas or tribal<br />
regions and politics in many countries of Africa have been organised<br />
tribally. It remains to be aeon whether a poltical party structure of the<br />
kind we have In Australia can actually apply effectively wtiere there Is<br />
good government and justice for all. I think these are some of the<br />
Issues, but one thing Is certain, a return to ciiian government is the<br />
key ingredient for Nigeria.<br />
J: Just one lest question on Nigeria If I may, there was talk last night of<br />
setting up a time frame for possible expulsion, what Is your view of<br />
that? </p>
<p>ILL-3<br />
PM: I think probably the time frame should be between now and the next<br />
meeting of the Commonwealth Heads of Government, which Is two<br />
years. Some may argue for it earlier than that, but I think to have the<br />
sort of plenary force of the Commonwealth, there really needs to be a<br />
Head of Government Meeting. And I don't think that, if you like, further<br />
solid action can be taken without a meeting of the Heads of<br />
Government. So I think that is probably the way it might go.<br />
J: By having to confront issues such as Nigeria and nuclear testing, do<br />
you believe this has strengthened the Commonwealth. or CHOGM, as<br />
a forum?<br />
PM. Well one of the things I said yesterday was that if the United Nations<br />
didn't exist, we would have to invent it. If the Commonwealth didn't<br />
exist, we wouldn't have to invent it. But it does exist and it exists<br />
because of the linkage we have all had with Britain at one point or<br />
another. So it Is a trans-regional body that runs across the world's<br />
regions and it has been effective in speaking about democracy, the rule<br />
of law, justice, human rights and development issues end I think it can<br />
continue to do that. Yesterday was a test of that and I think It passed<br />
that test.<br />
J: You would be aware of Mr Howard on the Sunday Program today,<br />
Prime Minister. What would you like to say about his comments?<br />
PM: Well he said today, he gave us this pat line again that he Is in favour of<br />
families, arrogantly, as if the rest of us don't come from families, or we<br />
are not in favour of them. But what he said is he was in favour of<br />
orthodox family arrangements. What he means Is he is not in favour of<br />
the unorthodox. In other words, he is only in favour of the nuclear<br />
family and the picket fence, he is not in favour of single parent families<br />
and he said, I thought rather ominously, that " a Government under him<br />
will not be a society where the Government picks up the pieces of<br />
families". In other words, they won't be supporting giving income<br />
support to families, income support per child for children, as the<br />
Government does. You see Mr Howard says he believes in families,<br />
but he doesn't believe In family support. He believes in families, but he<br />
doesn't believe in decent wages for them. He believes in families, but<br />
he doesn't believe In overtime rates. He believes in families, but he<br />
doesn't believe in Medicare. I mean, and what he made clear today,<br />
when pressed about the orthodox families that he is supporting and<br />
as, I think, every Australian knows the so-called nuclear. orthodox family<br />
is but a minority of families in Australia he said he was not going to<br />
debate in 1995 the definition of the family. In other words, what he Is<br />
telling us it's the same old John Howard with the picket fence. If you<br />
are, you know, mum and dad and three kids with a comfortable<br />
bungalow and a car in the driveway, well you will be supported. If you<br />
are a single parent with children, you won't be. If you are any other<br />
category of family, you will be called into question. That was one of the<br />
things he said. SL . I 14W V J L. .0 IU I </p>
<p>The other thing he said was about integrity in Government. He said we<br />
need Integrity in Government and Mr Oakes asked him the question,<br />
" Well why, Mr Howard, did you say coming up to the 1983 election that<br />
the Budget deficit was $ 6 billion, when you know it was $ 9.6 billion?"<br />
Hie then told a lie. He said, " I found out about it the night before the<br />
election." That is untrue. He found out about it about the Tuesday<br />
before the election and he sat on it for tour days. In a key matter, in a<br />
key election, and then he has got the gall to talk about Integrity In office<br />
and honesty in policies. He was asked, also, this question: did he<br />
regret his non-support of economic sanctions in South Africa? And he<br />
said, no he didn't. The point was made, well Nelson Mandela wouldn't<br />
be at this meeting of the Commonwoetth had your view obtained. Now<br />
Nelson Mandela wouldn't be here had John Howard's view obtained.<br />
This is the same John Howard who said be very careful of<br />
Mikhail Gorbachev and perestroika, he Is essentially leading you on, it<br />
is just the old sort of communist bogey, giving us another misleading<br />
line. in the meantime, of course, the Soviet Union has fallen apart, the<br />
Berlin wall has come down. On every foreign policy issue he has ever<br />
touched, he has been wrong and he was wrong a month ago when he<br />
said we have got to be suspicious of Asia, It Is a threat, we want<br />
security from Asia and not In Asia. But the thing about him Is, he never<br />
learns. He is out there today beating his breast about his policies on<br />
South Africa. In fact, they were dead wrong and he was in a minority<br />
against the rest of the world.<br />
