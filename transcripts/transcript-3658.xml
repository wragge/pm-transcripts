The Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam, today announced<br />
that President Suharto of Indonesia would pay an informal<br />

place in North Queensland. The Prime Minister and<br />
President Suharto will have informal discussions. The<br />
program will include a visit by the President to a<br />
cattle station. President Suharto will be accompanied by two<br />
ministers, the Minister for Agriculture, Mr Thojib Hadiwidjaja,<br />
the State Secretary and Minister of State Lieutenant General<br />

The visit is a continuation of the informal round<br />
