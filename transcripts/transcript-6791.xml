PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT or PRIME MINISTER ON 2SM 27 November 1985,<br />
8.2Oam E 0 r Proof only<br />
JOURNALIST: The Federal Government have recently started<br />
a Campaign to help unemployed youith called Priority One<br />
and an Sunday, 8 December, 2SM in association with the<br />
Australian Rock Company and the Human Rights Commission<br />
will present the Priority One Summer Rock Concert at<br />
the Domain. And to talk about it, the Prime Minister of<br />
Australia, the Mon. Bob Hawke. Prime Minister, how are<br />
you doing?<br />
PH: Very well thanks Leon.<br />
aOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, the concert I just mentioned will<br />
feature the Cockroaches, Gangajang, George Smilovic,<br />
Moving Pictures,,. Pseudo Echo, Dynamic Hypnotics, the<br />
Machinations, Australian Crawl I just wonder would I<br />
be likely to find any of those bands in your record<br />
collection or would i be more likely to find maybe<br />
Vera Lynn's Hits of the Blitz.<br />
PM: Oh, well you wouldn't find Vera Lynn's Hits of the<br />
81itz And I must honestly say you'd more likely to find<br />
records of the groups you referred to in my daughter's<br />
records. But I'm catholic in my tastes, I enjoy a lot<br />
of modern music, but my preference is for classical music.<br />
aOURNALISTt Would you have any idea just how many people<br />
in the age group we're talking about are going to be able<br />
to get permanent jobs as a result of Priority one.<br />
PH. Well let me put it this way if we look at the<br />
16 and 17 year olds for a start, we believe that as a<br />
result of the combined things that we'll be doing in<br />
increasing the incentive to stay in education, the<br />
traineeship scheme, plus more job creation should mean<br />
that by the end of this decade we should have eliminated<br />
virtually unemployment amongst 16 and 17 year olds. We<br />
ought to have created a situation by the end of the decade<br />
where all 16 and 17 year olds will be able to be staying<br />
in the education system, be in employment or training,-or<br />
a combination of those things that's for 16 and 17 year<br />
olds. And that as far as the next group of 18/ 19 year olds, we<br />
should also have been substantially able to reduce the<br />
level of unemployment in that area. in other words we have </p>
<p>IA PM cont... s made a significant inroad into youth unemployment<br />
nince we've been office and the Priority One concepts are<br />
direCted'towards very significantly further reducing that<br />
unemployment level by the end of the decade.<br />
HOURNALIST; Prime Minister, I note that you're very<br />
enthugiastic to Cet people to stay at sphool longer and<br />
I know that you, yourself, some years ago werA a damn<br />
hardworking academic, hence you're a Rhodes scholar. You'd<br />
probably be aware that something like 80,000 students that<br />
sat for an English paper recently haA a situation where<br />
be-aune of markers who were on strike, they didn't get<br />
of their paper marked. How would you feel about<br />
something like that.<br />
PM. I'd feel very annoyed. You'll appreciate that that<br />
is and I'm not trying to avoid the thrust of your<br />
question hut as ynu appreciate that is a State matter.<br />
The question of education is basically a State one although<br />
we are involved in a funding sense. And all I can say is<br />
in direct answer to your question, if I was one of the kids.:<br />
involved, I'd be bloody annoyed-<br />
JOURNALIST: I've heard a rumour that you and Molly Meldrum<br />
may get together to organise a deficit-aid concert to help<br />
fix our balance of payment, problems. Is that true.<br />
PM: No, but let me say this in regard to Geldorf lnternationall'<br />
and Molly here. I do appreciate very much the way in which<br />
they have-' used their Qreat talents to try and help those<br />
in the world who are significantly less fortunate thah<br />
ourselves. I think they are deserving of great commendation.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, I'm sure that those of all<br />
political persuasions would wish you well over the comina<br />
festive season alonct with your family and I trust that<br />
your questtOor all things reasonble continues successfully<br />
in the New Year.<br />
PM: Leon thank you very much and I want to thank you and<br />
the station for your preparedness to be involved in what<br />
really is Australia's greatest-challenae, and that is<br />
to ensure that we use the great resources of this<br />
country to ensure that for our young people there is<br />
a future of hope.<br />
ENDS </p>
