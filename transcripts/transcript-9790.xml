SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
OPENING OF THE EAST PERTH REDEVELOPMENT PROJECT<br />
CLAISEBROOK COVE, PERTH 10 OCTOBER 1995<br />
( CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY)<br />
We all tend to take our urban environments for granted, and as they change,<br />
we bend our minds to accommodate them.<br />
It is not usual for Governments to encourage protest and opposition to the<br />
status quo.<br />
But when it comes to the environments in which we live, we have a duty to<br />
stand up and be counted a duty and a perfect right.<br />
Just as Australians have grown fiercely protective of the natural environment,<br />
they must protect the best of the urban environment and insist on having a<br />
say in the direction of development.<br />
" Protect and direct" might not be a bad slogan. We have done some awful<br />
things to our cities and we are still doing them. We are doing them to our<br />
suburbs and to country towns.<br />
We live in an era in which protection of the natural environment is paramount<br />
in almost every Australian mind. I think we need to marry that with a concern<br />
for what we build on it, for what will reflect the sense of place which by now<br />
we have developed.<br />
I think the time has come to recognise that what we build on this landscape,<br />
what we build-forother-Australians-to live in and look upon is an essential<br />
measure of our care and responsibility, a measure of how we feel about<br />
Australia and the sort of country we want it to be.<br />
I think it is vital that we preserve our built heritage. Vital that we build living<br />
and working environments which are functional, aesthetically pleasing and<br />
compatible with the Australian natural habitat. </p>
<p>Environments which will last and age gracefully. Environments not only for<br />
now, but for future generations of Australians.<br />
And I think this is the responsibility of every government, every city and<br />
municipal council, every authority with a say in urban development and town<br />
planning, and of course every developer and every architect.<br />
And as I said, it is up to every one of us to demand it.<br />
That is why we began the Better Cities program and why I am so happy to be<br />
here today and to open the Claisebrook Cove Development.<br />
It's a pleasure to be here today to open the Claisebrook Cove development<br />
perhaps the most scenic element of the East Perth Better Cities Area<br />
Strategy. Not so long ago, the Claisebrook inlet was unsightly, unused and unloved.<br />
I'm told this was pretty much Perth's main drain contaminated and fairly<br />
unpleasant.<br />
Today, of course, it's an urban waterway on a Venetian scale one of Perth's<br />
most important public spaces. The inlet and cove has been reconstructed,<br />
power lines and fibre optic cables placed underground, a new pedestrian and<br />
cycle bridge built and the whole area landscaped.<br />
It hasn't looked this nice for a century or more. Some very attractive housing<br />
has already begun on Constitution Hill which will eventually flow down to the<br />
rim of the Cove. This is now an area of Perth crying out to be displayed<br />
rather than one demanding to be hidden.<br />
Through the East Perth Better Cities Area Strategy, this part of inner Perth<br />
next to the Swan is being rejuvenated. The Federal Government has<br />
invested $ 32 million of Better Cities funds to transform East Perth from<br />
disused industrial land into a lively urban village.<br />
The Strategy includes the rehabilitation of the old gas works, the<br />
establishment of several parks and the Advanced Manufacturing Technology<br />
Centre, the building of a new railway station and river jetties, and the<br />
construction of medium density housing and a commercial district.<br />
.1 am. especial ly-plIeased . to . confirm. that-this. redevelopment project will be<br />
accessible to Australians of varying incomes. The Commonwealth Minister<br />
for Housing and Urban Development Brian Howe, and the State Minister for<br />
Planning Richard Lewis, are finalising the Heads of Agreement on ' Affordable<br />
Housing'. Significant public funds have gone into East Perth and it would be<br />
unfair if lower income Australians were excluded from living here.<br />
Claisebrook Cove and East Perth are good examples of what is being<br />
achieved around Australia under the rubric of the Better Cities program. </p>
<p>Better Cities was initially an $ 816 million scheme and with the extra funds<br />
from the last Budget, the Federal Government investment is more than $ 1<br />
billion. The Government has allocated $ 78 million for Better Cities in Western<br />
Australia to projects in Bunbury, Stirling, Fremantle and throughout Perth.<br />
Better Cities is about regenerating urban areas unlocking them and making<br />
them more pleasant, livable and efficient. The quality of Australia's cities is<br />
one of our great comparative advantages. It feeds into our international<br />
competitiveness as well as the happiness of our people.<br />
The Federal Government believes that investing in our people and the cities<br />
in which they live is a good idea. I am very pleased that all governments<br />
have had the wit to work together to renovate East Perth and I congratulate<br />
everyone involved.<br />
I'm very happy to open Claisebrook Cove. </p>
