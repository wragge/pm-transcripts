-1,, AUSTRALIA<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
POLITICAL ACTIVITY BY VIETNAMESE REFUGEES<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam, today described as<br />
false and misleading suggestions made by the opposition<br />
during Question Time that the Australian Government had<br />
proscribed the right of domestic political activity of<br />
Vietnamese refugees who have entered this country.<br />
Mr Whitlam said that only nine of the nearly 1000<br />
Vietnamese who have so far come to Australia had been asked<br />
to provide an undertaking that they would eschew political<br />
activity. These nine persons were all admitted as special<br />
cases because of the high risks to their security caused by<br />
the change of Government. Each had been politically active<br />
and involved in the policies of the previous Government.<br />
Mr Whitlam recalled that such undertakings were<br />
not novel. The policy was first developed by previous<br />
Liberal/ Country Party Governments. He had been informed<br />
that Mr Mikis Theodorakis had been requested to give a similar<br />
undertaking, All Colombo Plan students were required by<br />
previous Governments to sign a guarantee that they would not<br />
engage in political activity during the period of their<br />
residence in this country.<br />
" It is to be expected", said Mr Whitlam, " that<br />
refugees who were forced to leave their homeland will resent<br />
the fact and long remember it. But it cannot be accepted<br />
that this is justification for using Australia as a base<br />
for futile political activity intended to change political<br />
arrangements in their native land", he said. " For too long<br />
now Australians and Australia have had to suffer the violence<br />
and lawlessness of some emigre political groups who, in fantasy<br />
fashion, believe that by their efforts they can alter these<br />
political facts."<br />
Mr Whitlam said that the Australian Government did<br />
not discriminate between refugees in its requirement for such<br />
undertakings. If Australian officials thought it possible<br />
that certain refugees could cause dissension, disruption or<br />
strife within ethnic groups, then they would be asked for such<br />
an undertaking whether, for instance, they were Chilean or<br />
Vietnamese. No discrimination between ethnic groups has been<br />
practised or will be practised. The requirement will continue<br />
to be put whenever it is justified and whatever the ethnic<br />
origin of the refugees. / 2 </p>

Mr Whitlam said the Opposition charges were<br />
designed to mask its guilt over Australia's intervention<br />
in Vietnam. Mr Whitlam said that, unlike previous<br />
Governments, the present Australian Government granted<br />
citizenship to applicants irrespective of their political<br />
views. Quite obviously, he said, a written undertaking<br />
could not diminish the rights conferred by Australian<br />
citizenship which all of the refugees were now entitled<br />
-to seek under Government policies. The reqUirement . is<br />
justified by the need to maintain peace and order in the<br />
community. It is, he said, clear that upon becoming<br />
citizens they could ignore that undertaking as no such<br />
requirement can be made of an Australian citizen.<br />
Mr Whitlam said no Government could tolerate its<br />
-territory being used as a base for action designed to<br />
overthrow the recognised Government of another country.<br />
Whatever the Australian people or Government might think<br />
of another Government's policies, there is no choice but<br />
to prevent persons in Australia from taking action to<br />
remove such a Government. This is the only reason for<br />
such an undertaking being required. Its need is regrettably<br />
apparent because of events in certain of the migrant<br />
communities. As I have said before about other places, it<br />
is no kindness and in fact a delusion to suggest to refugees<br />
that there is any prospect of altering the political<br />
arrangements in their former homelands. Unfortunately,<br />
as we have seen often, such suggestions are promoted by<br />
the disaffected within ethnic communities, generally to<br />
the detriment of those communities and the wider Australian<br />
community", Mr Whitlam said.<br />
0 Mr Whitlam said that he would like to assure<br />
any person who had been required to give an undertaking by<br />
the present or previous Governments, that, they were entitled<br />
to all rights of political activity in the Australian<br />
community provided by Australian law. He said he regretted<br />
that yet again, by its deliberate tactics, the Opposition<br />
had set out to confuse migrants.<br />
