STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
TIMBER INDUSTRY<br />
Cabinet met tonight to discuss the woodchip issue.<br />
As I said last week, the Government is determined to find<br />
a means by which the timber industry a vital part of<br />
Australia's economic future and the economic foundation<br />
of many Australian communities will be supported and<br />
encouraged in its growth and progress towards ecological<br />
sustainability. As I also said, we are determined to see that our forests<br />
are adequately protected for this and future generations.<br />
This is a major national issue, and a complex and<br />
passionate one. There is no simple answer which will<br />
satisfy the demands of those on the extremes of the<br />
debate.<br />
The Government is in no doubt that the vast majority of<br />
Australians wish to see the issue resolved in a way which<br />
will enable an Australian timber industry and its workers<br />
to prosper while our native forests are preserved.<br />
Without qualification, the Government believes its<br />
responsibility is to find such a solution in the<br />
interests of both our timber industry and our<br />
environment. A solution, in other words, which is in the national<br />
interest. Accordingly, Cabinet has tonight decided that the<br />
following assessment process will apply in relation to<br />
509 coupes identified as requiring further consideration<br />
before logging should proceed:<br />
priority attention will be given to resolving the<br />
status of those coupes which meet all three of the<br />
following conditions<br />
are currently being logged in accordance with<br />
their licence conditions ( ie following<br />
correct forest practice, preserving identified<br />
endangered species etc);<br />
have licences which were renewed in 1994 ( ie<br />
were originally issued earlier than 1994); and </p>
<p>are not registered as part of the National<br />
Estate.<br />
Following consideration by officials from the Departments<br />
of DEST, DPIE and PM&amp; C, and consultation with the<br />
relevant State Departments, next week Cabinet will<br />
consider the status of these coupes, with a view to the<br />
statutory decision maker, the Minister for Resources,<br />
making a final decision on them.<br />
As to all the remaining coupes, the following<br />
assessment process will be followed:<br />
a preliminary assessment of the conservation<br />
value of each coupe will be made in<br />
accordance with the criteria laid down in the<br />
National Forest Policy Statement by a team of<br />
officials from DEST, DPIE and PM&amp; C working with<br />
relevant State Departments;<br />
these assessments shall then be the subject of<br />
consultation with representatives of the forest<br />
industry and unions, and the environmental<br />
movement; Cabinet will then consider the appropriate<br />
status of all these coupes in the light of this<br />
advice; and<br />
the Minister for Resources, as statutory<br />
decision-maker, will decide the final status of<br />
the coupes, taking into account this<br />
consultative process and Cabinet's<br />
deliberations.<br />
In order to reduce uncertainty as much as possible, it is<br />
proposed that this process be completed within eight<br />
weeks. This week in Canberra has provided ample and reassuring<br />
evidence that Australia remains a robust and tolerant<br />
democracy. By their demonstration outside the national Parliament<br />
people engaged in the timber industry have been able to<br />
express their concerns, but nothing will be gained by<br />
continuing the action.<br />
Certainly, the Government will not allow its decisions to<br />
be influenced or enacted in an atmosphere of<br />
intimidation.<br />
Cabinet's resolutions will be acted upon immediately and<br />
I urge those involved to return to their communities so<br />
that this issue can be resolved in their interests and in<br />
the interest of Australia.<br />
