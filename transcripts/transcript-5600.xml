FOR MEDIA TUESDAY, 2 JUNE, 1981<br />
MR. LINDSAY THOMPSON<br />
I would like to congrulate Lindsay Thompson on his<br />
election as Leader of the Liberal Party in Victoria, and<br />
Bill Borthwick on his election as Deputy.<br />
I have every confidence that Mr. Thompson will be an<br />
excellent Premier of Victoria, as he has been an<br />
excellent Minister.<br />
Mr. Thompson and Mr. Borthwick will have the full support<br />
of-all Liberals, and I have no doubt that Victoria will<br />
continue to move ahead strongly under their leadership.<br />
000---</p>
