SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
LAUNCH OF THE 1991 AUSTRALIAN MADE CAMPAIGN<br />
POWERHOUSE MUSEUM<br />
SYDNEY 28 AUGUST 1991<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
I am very pleased to be here at the Powerhouse Museum to<br />
launch the 1991 Australian Made campaign.<br />
There are plenty of examplets of Australian ingenuity<br />
on display here already, arid if what is in the new campaign<br />
is any guide, there will be plenty more products of the<br />
clever country looking for display space in the future.<br />
This is the fifth anniversary of Australian Made and the<br />
green and gold kangaroo has3 become the symbol of Australian<br />
excellence. There has been a perceptible change in the way we look at<br />
home grown goods and services. Where once, perhaps, we<br />
automatically thought that imported was always better, now<br />
we have second thoughts. Now we know that in many areas<br />
Australian is just as good, if not better.<br />
In manufactured goods, in particular, I believe quality has<br />
improved substantially which is reflected in what we think<br />
in Australia, but equally in what buyers think overseas, as<br />
reflected in the substantial increase in manufactured<br />
exports. Buying Australian is certainly better value. Every time we<br />
buy Australian we do something for our fellow Australians.<br />
In a recession or a boom, buying Australian has a direct<br />
impact on jobs.<br />
What I say is: Be Australian, buy Australian.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, few things we can do as individuals,<br />
as businesses or as governments are more important to<br />
the future of Australia than buying Australian.<br />
For every $ 1 million used to replace imports 35 jobs are<br />
created in industry. </p>
<p>Import replacement buying Australian is one of the ways<br />
we will create sustainable jobs as part of our long term<br />
sustained economic recovery. And the key word<br />
is " sustained". Sustained and sustainable recovery is the<br />
only answer to the present thoroughly unacceptable level of<br />
unemployment. It was part of last week's Budget, it was part of my March<br />
economic statement it has been part of the overall<br />
economic of the Government economic strategy that we been<br />
putting in place, not simply with the Budget, but with a<br />
whole range of activity through 1991 including the March<br />
Statement and the Special Premiers Conference process.<br />
For a Labor Government, nothing is more distressing than<br />
high unemployment. Ladies and gentlemen, we could have<br />
artificially changed the economic climate and created<br />
hothouse jobs.<br />
But there is nothing more cruel than creating the hope of<br />
secure employment and then seeing it fade away like a<br />
hothouse plant dumped out in the cold.<br />
We are not prepared to allow the economy to fall back into<br />
the cyclical boom and bust habit which has characterised it<br />
for too long.<br />
We are about reforming the structure of the economy which<br />
means that some hard decisions have been taken, and will<br />
continue to be taken.<br />
Take tariff reform. You might think that the quickest way to<br />
get people to buy Australian would be to tax imports so that<br />
the Australian products can compete on price.<br />
But protection is like the banning of books. It doesn't<br />
prevent the new ideas competing with the old, and it doesn't<br />
do anything for the efficiency or security of industry<br />
either. Just the opposite.<br />
We cannot and will not simply rely on tariff protection for<br />
Australian products. We will create an internationally<br />
competitive economy. We will help them become more<br />
competitive in Australia and overseas.<br />
Part of that help is the S2 million provided to continue the<br />
Australian Made campaign in my March Statement.<br />
Then, I said, it was because " reducing our reliance on<br />
imports is totally complementary, in economic terms, to<br />
expanding our performance in exports." And we have made some<br />
great strides toward improving our export performance<br />
especially in the crucial area of manufactured exports.<br />
In the seven years, 1983 1990, the value of manufactured<br />
exports increased at an annual average rate of 17%, rising<br />
from 2.9 billion in 1983/ 4 to S7.6 billion in 1989/ 90.<br />
lOon </p>
<p>The volume of goods and services exports, rose by 13% in<br />
1990-91 with manufactured exports rising by 25.5%<br />
That is a demonstration of the fundamental changes in the<br />
economy working through. In the Budget the balance of goods<br />
and services is forecast to be in surplus in 1991-2 for the<br />
first time since 1979-80.<br />
Australians can compete on world markets, provided we work<br />
harder, and we think smarter.<br />
But Government can only create the conditions for economic<br />
success and a high qual: lty of life. At the end of the day<br />
it comes down to individuals-to make it happen.<br />
The Australian Made Campaign's efforts since 1986 to licence<br />
Australian Made products~ is a good example of self-help in<br />
action. Before earning the right to display the Australian Made<br />
certification mark on their products, local industries are<br />
assisted by the Campaign to put their own house in order in<br />
terms of the quality and local content of their goods.<br />
In return, Australian Mlade licensees derive considerable<br />
advantage from the right to display what is undoubtedly one<br />
of Australia's most familiar symbols the distinctive green<br />
and gold kangaroo.<br />
With the Campaign's encouragement, more and more local<br />
producers have realise the benefit to be gained from the<br />
marketing edge offered by a clearly identifiable national<br />
product. The Campaign now plans to supplement its licensing<br />
activities with two important new initiatives, both of which<br />
extend the self-help concept.<br />
The first initiative is the Australian Made Product<br />
Directory, a copy of which I was pleased to receive some<br />
weeks ago.<br />
The Directory is the first ever comprehensive guide to<br />
Australian Made licensees and their products, and it goes a<br />
long way toward informing both the public and private<br />
sectors of the wide range of quality Australian goods on<br />
offer. The Campaign's new iniLtiatives offers Australian Made<br />
licensees the chance improve the quality of their<br />
products in order to enter export markets.<br />
The Advance Australia Foundation has arranged for the<br />
National Industry Extension Service and the Industrial<br />
Supplies Office to assess the quality of licensees' products<br />
for export quality, and advise on how quality can be<br />
improved. </p>
<p>I am pleased to see that the public and private sectors are<br />
collaborating to help Australian producers improve the<br />
export quality of their products.<br />
Self-improvement initiatives of this sort help our local<br />
industries and therefore Australia meet the challenges<br />
of a tough and increasingly competitive world.<br />
The Government is also playing its part.<br />
We have even, believe it or not, developed a kind of<br />
portable igloo that we are selling to Eskimos and other<br />
North Americans.<br />
It was developed as a result of a deliberate purchasing and<br />
specification decision by the Commonwealth Government's<br />
Antarctic Division. They required a new kind of shelter for<br />
scientists who had to stay away from their main base. The<br />
result was an innovation that fitted our requirements in the<br />
Antarctic, and could be exported to the Arctic too.<br />
That is an example of a simple purchasing and specification<br />
decision creating a new export product.<br />
The total Government market is huge.<br />
The Commonwealth alone spends some S10 billion each year,<br />
and the States and Territories an additional $ 20 billion<br />
We are not in the business of having some central command<br />
system to compel all the agencies and departments of nine<br />
governments on how to purchase that way of operating iLs<br />
well and truly in the dustbin of history.<br />
But we have launched the Purchase Australian campaign aimed<br />
to promote the purchase of Australian ( and New Zealand)<br />
goods and services by Government. It has raised the<br />
awareness of government buyers to the advantages of local<br />
goods and services, and is maximising local suppliers<br />
opportunities. In addition, I launched the Environmental Futures Group,<br />
headed by George Negus, earlier this year. One of the aims<br />
of this group is to promote the use of Australian<br />
environmentally suitable goods and services by the<br />
government. In many areas Australian know-how is already a world beater.<br />
You will see some of it in the new television commercials,<br />
which celebrate our achievements in solar technology, boat<br />
design, and the bionic ear, but every day, it seems to me,<br />
we find out about something new that Australians have<br />
invented or discovered.<br />
Australia is a clever country.<br />
But as you watch the television commercials over the next:<br />
few months, I hope you don't say about the bionic ear, " I<br />
didn't know we invented that!" I hope you already knew.<br />
10029 </p>
<p>What I do hope is that you will make Australia a definite<br />
part of the decision making process when you are next<br />
purchasing something anything. Food, technology, clothes<br />
Ask yourself whether the imported product is as good as the<br />
Australian alternative.<br />
Ask yourself Where was it made? Who made it? Who benefits<br />
from your purchase?<br />
Have a look for the green and gold kangaroo that tells you<br />
it is Australian Made.<br />
But don't buy something just because it is Australian.<br />
Buy it because it is betcer. 03 </p>
