PRIME MINISTER<br />
CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
CWA NATIONAL CONFERENCE<br />
BRISBANE 18 JULY 1988<br />
Your Excellency Lady Stephen,<br />
Dorothy Ross,<br />
Members of the Country Women's Association.<br />
In '. 1922, the Bushwomen's Conference was held at the Royal<br />
Easter Show in Sydney.<br />
From those small beginnings, the Country Women's Association<br />
has grown to become the largest women's organisation in<br />
Australia, with 56,000 members in all States and<br />
Territories. Through its wide network of regional branches,<br />
the CWA has worked tirelessly over more than 60 years to<br />
improve the welfare of women and their families, especially<br />
those living in isolated rural areas.<br />
Country women have always by necessity been self reliant and<br />
resourceful. They know what it means to make do, and to get<br />
things done. They have coped with floods, drought,<br />
recession and, now, they are coping with the impact of<br />
changing international economic conditions.<br />
Any study of Australia's rural development would be<br />
incomplete without recognition of the vital contribution<br />
made by the Country Women's Association by setting up<br />
maternity hospitals and baby health centres, by working over<br />
decades for Aboriginal welfare, by seeking better<br />
educational opportunities for rural women.<br />
In these and other ways the CWA has always worked, and is<br />
still working to ensure country and rural women can<br />
participate fully and effectively in all spheres of<br />
Australian life.<br />
Nor has the CWA ignored the changes in the Australian<br />
economy which are making it necessary for us to become more<br />
outward-looking, more competitive in what we do, more<br />
diverse in what we produce.<br />
It's a transition which is affecting life in every part of<br />
Australia and posing challenges to all Australians.<br />
394 </p>
<p>2.<br />
Advances in agricultural technology mean that farmers now<br />
need more sophisticated training to manage their businesses.<br />
Changes in communication have also brought the city and<br />
country closer together, and have quickened the pace of<br />
country life. International tourism is making a rapid and<br />
welcome impact on our cities and towns.<br />
Rural women, have been steadily moving to adapt to these<br />
changes and they have been greatly assisted in their efforts<br />
by the Country Women's Association.<br />
The CWA has shown an active interest in international issues<br />
through its affiliation with the Associated Country Women of<br />
the World. I have noticed your increasing interest in our<br />
Pacific region which was reflected in the Seventh South<br />
Pacific Area Conference of the Associated Country Women of<br />
the World held earlier this year in South Australia.<br />
For all these reasons I was very pleased to accept your<br />
invitation to address this Conference.<br />
Late last year my good friend Dorothy Ross wrote to me about<br />
the world Heritage Listing of the Wet Tropics of North-east<br />
Queensland. Dorothy pointed out that the CWA is very<br />
conscious of the environment and is anxious that the land is<br />
cared for. But she expressed the CWA's very understandable<br />
concerns about the effect on families in the area of World<br />
Heritage Listing.<br />
Australian women and I think country women in particular<br />
have shown a special concern for our natural environment.<br />
Country women have an especially close relationship with<br />
Australia's natural heritage, as many of your families<br />
derive their livelihood from the earth. You have a natural<br />
respect for the abundance of nature, and an appreciation of<br />
the fragility that our natural environment often displays<br />
with, for example, soil degradation, salinity and drought.<br />
Your awareness of and concern for our natural environment is<br />
something my Government shares.<br />
I have responded to Dorothy, and I want to assure you all<br />
here today, that through our package of assistance measures<br />
my Government will do everything it can to ease any economic<br />
hardship faced by families in. the region of the world<br />
Heritage Listing.<br />
We will create up to 600 jobs this financial year and will<br />
be making available up to about $ 75 million in assistance<br />
over three years. The area is one of unsurpassed<br />
environmental magnificence and I am sure that World Heritage<br />
Listing will contribute to the tourist potential of the<br />
region which will of course itself create additional job<br />
opportunities. 395 </p>
<p>A second important environmental matter is the Government's C(<br />
recent decision to control substances harmful to the ozone H<br />
layer. Just last week Cabinet decided to give effect to the c(<br />
Montreal Protocol on ozone layer protection in fact we are<br />
prepared to go further. For example, agreement has been S<br />
reached with industry to stop using chlorofluorocarbons in c<br />
aerosol sprays, for all but limited essential purposes, by<br />
the end of next year. We will be consulting with the States V<br />
and other interested parties on details of the necessary P<br />
legislation. c<br />
Muriel Pagliano, your State President here in Queensland, aa]<br />
has written to me expressing the Queensland CWA's support<br />
for our moves to protect the ozone layer, and I want to. say A<br />
that your support is most welcome and most heartening. u<br />
I want to say a little today specifically about the m<br />
Government'Is programs directed specifically at women i<br />
because it is a record of achievement of which I am proud w<br />
and because it is a record of achievement in which the CWA<br />
has itself played a significant role. Ri<br />
In Queensland, it's particularly appropriate I should make f<br />
mention too of the Federal Minister whose responsibility it W(<br />
iosf wtoo means sistQ uemee nsilna ntdh e Sdeenavteolro pmMeanrtg arofe t pRoelyincoiledss . o n the status. PS<br />
As you would be aware, the Government is continuing to work cf(<br />
on the National Agenda for Women the most detailed,<br />
practical and comprehensive strategy ever produced by am H<br />
Australian Government to achieve equality of opportunity for we<br />
Australian women.<br />
In keeping with the goals of the National Agenda, the tF(<br />
Government set out two years ago to ask rural women what are a(<br />
their major concerns and priorities. 1:<br />
That decision was prompted by a suggestion from Do rothy that T1<br />
we survey the special needs of rural women. w fe<br />
The CWA, in conjunction with the Office'of the Status of 0<br />
Women, conducted the survey which resulted in the report<br />
" Life Has Never Been Easy". Dorothy and I launched this 4 Re<br />
report in Bathurst last February. a' Ht<br />
The survey reveals health, education and training, childt1<br />
care and transport which are basic needs in any community<br />
as specially important~ for rural women endeavouring to T1<br />
bring up a family without ready access to support services. He<br />
Let me today speak briefly on the way the Government is l<br />
endeavouring to respond to the needs that were identified in<br />
the survey. A<br />
I have asked departments to develop programs to implement t<br />
the Action Plans outlined in the National Agenda for women, e<br />
taking into account the findings of the Rural Women's Survey P<br />
and the community consultations that followed it.<br />
396 </p>
<p>4.<br />
Many women identified health care as a priority. The<br />
Commonwealth is currently developing a National Women's<br />
Health Policy, as part of which the Commonwealth, in<br />
co-operation with the States, is funding a three year<br />
million program to evaluate and co-ordinate breast<br />
screening trials, and to establish and evaluate cervical<br />
cancer screening services, especially in rural areas.<br />
violence against women and children has been a deplorable<br />
part of life that we can no longer tolerate if we are to<br />
consider ourselves a civilised nation. Several States-have<br />
already taken steps to lessen the incidence of this crime,<br />
and to assist the victims.<br />
A three year campaign against domestic violence is now<br />
underway. A Commonwealth/ State Task Force will work<br />
together on this complex problem. One aspect will involve<br />
making community and women's health workers more aware of<br />
the threat such violence poses, and the ways it can be dealt<br />
with. Rural women ~ who responded to the survey identified the need<br />
for information as a significant issue for them.<br />
We have responded-with the establishment of the Commonwealth<br />
Services Information Program, through the Department of<br />
Primary Industries and Energy, to provide information to<br />
country people about the services and programs available<br />
from the Federal Government.<br />
Housing has emerged as another important concern for rural<br />
women. For the aged, and for those on low incomes, particularly if<br />
they are sole parents, access to suitable and affordable<br />
accommodation can mean the difference between poverty and a<br />
life with dignity.<br />
The action plans on housing in the National Agenda for Women<br />
will ensure that women are included in housing policy<br />
formulation and when considering options for the development<br />
of public housing.<br />
Research is now being undertaken on housing needs in rural<br />
areas. We will continue to support the work of the Women's<br />
Housing' Issues Working Party, and to monitor and evaluate<br />
the Commonwealth/ State Housing Agreement.<br />
Through such programs as the Local Government and Community<br />
Housing Program, we will encourage new forms of public<br />
ownership through co-operatives and other types of community<br />
managed housing.<br />
A common theme which emerges from consultation with women<br />
throughout Australia is the critical importance of access to<br />
education and training in the achievement of full<br />
participation by women in our economic and social life. 397 </p>
<p>Since its election in 1983 this Government has made<br />
expansion of educational opportunities a priority.<br />
It was a national disgrace that when we came to office only<br />
about one-third of our students were staying on at secondary<br />
school to Year 12.<br />
As a result of our policies, that proportion is now over one<br />
half. By the early 1990s, we hope that two-thirds of our<br />
students will be completing their schooling, opening the<br />
door to a fuller and more satisfying adult life.<br />
The expansion of the Technical and Further Education system<br />
has provided improved access for thousands of Australians<br />
living in rural areas. New campuses have been built, others<br />
have been refurbished, and the range of courses has been<br />
expanded.<br />
AS well, the National Policy for the Education of Girls is<br />
encouraging recognition of the special needs of girls in<br />
rural communities where the range of work and training is<br />
restricted. In the area of child care, which has been a particular<br />
priority of my Government, special funding has been made<br />
available to family day care schemes serving large rural and<br />
remote areas.<br />
I don't think its necessary to list exhaustively every<br />
initiative we are taking to respond to the needs rural women<br />
have told us they feel.<br />
I don't want to pretend that every problem has been solved<br />
or indeed that every problem can be easily solved.<br />
And I especially want to avoid the suggestion . that policies<br />
which help rural women are somehow separate from the broader<br />
policies we are pursuing for economic progress nation-wide.<br />
Those broader policies have produced one million new jobs.<br />
They are reducing inflation. They have allowed the<br />
achievement of historic welfare reforms such as the Family<br />
Allowance Supplement and the Child Support Scheme.<br />
All Australians are better off for these achievementsincluding<br />
rural women and their. families.<br />
So in closing I thank you for the support and the<br />
constructive criticism you have provided.<br />
I am confident the CWA will continue, as it has in the past,<br />
to alert the Government to needs that are current and<br />
problems that await resolution.<br />
Together we can continue the task of making a better and a<br />
stronger Australia for our children.<br />
