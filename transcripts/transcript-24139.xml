    <content><![CDATA[<p>This afternoon I spoke with Prime Minister Abe to convey Australiaâs solidarity and support for Japan.</p>
<p>Australia utterly condemns the actions of Daesh and its threat to murder two Japanese citizens.</p>
<p>It is an outrage for Japan to have the lives of two citizens threatened by this murderous group.</p>
<p>Australia stands with Japan as it faces this horrifying situation and calls on the captors to release these men and all other hostages.</p>
<p>I re-affirmed Australiaâs commitment to contribute to the international effort to disrupt and degrade Daesh.</p>
<p>Australia and Japan will never sacrifice our values and our freedom in the face of terrorism.</p>
<p>22 January 2015</p>
