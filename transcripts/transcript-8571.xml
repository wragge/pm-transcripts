TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
DEPARTURE DOORSTOP, FAIRBAIRN RAAF BASE, CANBERRA<br />
7 JULY 1992<br />
E &amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
PM: You know that the practice of Australian leaders is when they leave<br />
Australia they don't comment on domestic affairs, but as I'm leaving I can<br />
comment and I want to just put a few things on the record about Dr<br />
Hewson and Mr Howard.<br />
What Dr Hewson showed over the weekend with his heartless policy<br />
towards young eople, leaving them in a deadendjob without training is<br />
that he's not a Liberal leader with traditional Liberal values he's simply a<br />
clinical technician. A clinical technician who wants to make everybody<br />
wear a penalty, the young wear a penalty and now Mr Howard has let the<br />
cat out of the bag by telling us that adult wages will also be slashed and<br />
he'll be announcing a new low wage structure for adults. The wage share in<br />
our economy this year is at 1960s levels, how much lower do these people<br />
want it to go? For the 90 per cent of Australians in work, how much<br />
greater penalty does Dr Hewson and Mr Howard want them to wear?<br />
Everything that Dr Hewson does is about a penalty, a penalty for young<br />
people on wages, leaving them in deadend jobs without training, a penalty<br />
on middle aged workers, a penalty on the community with a 15 per cnt<br />
Goods and Services Tax, everything is about wearing a penalty.<br />
I know Australia has got its troubles at the moment and the recession has<br />
been a problem and we've got to work our~ way out of it, but this<br />
Government will not abandon Australia's social values Australian<br />
values. To take the 90 per cent of people in work and slash their wages or<br />
to leave our young people destitute of an education and without hope in the<br />
future of a decent job and training. </p>
<p>I said in the past that Dr Hewson was a wolf in sheeps clothing and I think<br />
on the weekend he reveals himself to be just that a clinical technician<br />
without any understanding of the human equation or Australian social<br />
values.<br />
J: What figure are you looking at for a youth-? age<br />
PM: We've got a different approach all together. We're saying that mostly those<br />
in the 15 to 19 year age bracket have largely unskilled jobs, and they've<br />
largely disappeared and that 15 to 19 ought to be a period a period of<br />
vocational preparation. We're the Government that got the retention rates<br />
up in school, we're the Government that made the places available in<br />
universities, and we're now the Government trying to reconstruct the<br />
technical and further education system to give young Australians jobs and<br />
hope in the future and not leave them and say we're not training them, we'll<br />
leave them in a deadend job and we'll pretend we can expand the number<br />
of jobs by cutting the price of their labour.<br />
J: Will your plan ensure that older workers, experienced workers don't get<br />
sacked for younger workers in training?<br />
PM: Interestingly I notice Mr Howard today refused to confirm that they would<br />
be protecting older workers from displacement by younger more<br />
inexpensively paid workers a la the Liberal proposal. The fact is that<br />
per cent of Australians are still in work and Dr Hewson and Mr Howard<br />
want to savagely cut their wages. As I say the wage share in GDP, the<br />
wage share in the economy this year at that 1960s level. What do they<br />
want to do to the public of Australia? Make them destitute? Why must<br />
they wear penalties? Why is Dr Hewson so penalty prone? Penalties for<br />
young people, penalties for middle age workers, penalties for the<br />
community with the GST, penalties, pain, sacrifice. What about some joy?<br />
Growth, jobs, rise in living standards and jobs for young and older people<br />
alike.<br />
J: Mr Keating, what do you hope to achieve from this Forum?<br />
PM: It is a chance for the leaders of the South Pacific, the Pacific area to talk<br />
about problems of the area. I think what I'd like to achieve, I don't go there<br />
with any particular agenda, just to participate in the discussions on<br />
development and environmental issues in the Pacific. I've got a few<br />
bilateral meetings arranged with Mr Bolger and the Prime Minister of Fiji<br />
Mr Rabuka and I expect it will be a vexr' interesting meeting.<br />
J: Will you be talking with Mr Carlot about the crisis with Vanuatu? </p>
<p>3<br />
PM: I will be talking about it I think yes. Senator Evans met him, Senator<br />
Evans told me that they still intend that they should expel our diplomat,<br />
we've made it clear we don't take very kindly to that so we've cancelled our<br />
ships visit for this week. I'll be taking the opportunity to discuss this with<br />
Mr Carlot while I'm there.<br />
J: Mr Keating, do you think a drop in interest rates would be enough to<br />
stimulate the economy?<br />
PM: At a doorstop or a fencestop I don't think we should go through macro<br />
economic settings. Thank you.<br />
