ADDRESS 10 THE NATIOIN.<br />
BY THE PRIME 1 INISTER,<br />
MR, EG. W11r -LAM, m. P.,<br />
SUNDAY, 16 FEBRUARY 1975<br />
I want to speak tonight about some distrubing<br />
developments in Australia's parliamentary system which<br />
I am bound to say post as werious a threat to its<br />
strenght and stability as we have ever encouintered in<br />
our history. It's time to stop the rot. And that can really<br />
be done only by the Australian people<br />
Let me begin by stating a very general principle<br />
about the working of our democracy. Our syster, depends very<br />
heavily on custom, tradition, the unwritten rul~ es of the*<br />
game. True, we have a written Constitution bul: the<br />
Constitution itself is silent on many of the most important<br />
and fundamental aspects of the working of our democracy.<br />
The Constitution says nothing about rule by popular majority.<br />
It says nothing about political parties. It says nothing about<br />
freec'om of speech. Yet these are basic to how we govern<br />
ourselves. The basis of our system the rule of law is<br />
commion consent and comimonsense. In the ultimate, these are<br />
the only guarantees against the fule of force.<br />
When violence is done to an improtant convention,<br />
a well-established custom, then violence is done to<br />
demtocracy itself.<br />
Last April, we had the unprecedented attempt by the<br />
Opposition in the Senate to refuse Supply to the elected<br />
Government that is, to deny the Government the money<br />
it needs to carry out its duties. At the election which<br />
followed, you were able to pass judgement on this -action.<br />
You re-elected my Government for a further 3 years and<br />
repudiated the action of the Opposition in the Senate.<br />
That should have been the end of the matter. Yet almost<br />
from the time the numbers we-: t up, the opposition has made no<br />
secret of its intention to repeat the exercise if it can,<br />
whenever it can. It confronts Australia with the prospect of<br />
6-monthly national elections an impossible basis for<br />
sound effective government.<br />
This is a generalised threat to set aside the verdict<br />
you recorded only last May. Now, only last week, we have a<br />
clear specific threat to set aside a clear specific decision<br />
made by the people of New South Wales.<br />
In May. the people of the largest State voted in favour<br />
of the Government team of the Senate candidates by a majority<br />
of 50% as against 41.7% of the votes for the Opposition<br />
candidates. / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
The Senator who headed the successful Senate team, Senator<br />
L. K. Murphy I--as now been a-Fpoln., ted a Justice of the<br />
High Court, the sixth Australi. an Attorney-General to be made<br />
a judge by the Australian Government.-Mr. Justice<br />
Hliggins, Mr. Justice Isaacs, Chief Justice Latham, Chief Judge<br />
SpicE-r-and Chief Justice Barwick. incidentally, so far<br />
this century 12 English Attorney-General have been appointed<br />
Lords Chancellor, Lords Chief Justice or a Lord Justice of<br />
Appeal.$ This is the 26th casual bacancy in the Senate<br />
since proportional representation was introduced in 1949.<br />
hitherto the States have filled every vacancy with a.<br />
Senator who belongs to the smae political party as his<br />
predecessor. In 10 of the 25 cases the new Senator for the<br />
State was a political opponent of the government of the State.<br />
The first casual vac * ancy was caused by the death of a<br />
Labor senator for Western Australia in 1951. Th,. Liberal<br />
Premi er of Western Australia, after consulting the Liberal<br />
Prime Minister, Mr. Menzies and the other Premiers, sponsored a<br />
Labor man to replace him. This practice has sence been scrupulously<br />
followed in every State by every Premier, Liberal, Labor and<br />
Country Party. In 1959 the Constitutional Review Committee, composed of<br />
8 M. H. R. s and 4 Senators, 6 of them Labor, 4 Liberal and<br />
2 Country Party, recorded that they were all strongly of the<br />
view that, if the Senator for a State whose place has become vacant<br />
was a member of a political party, the Parliament of the<br />
State or the Governor of the State should be rqquired, in<br />
filling the vacancy, to choose a person who was a member of<br />
the same political party as the vacating senator.<br />
Last rThursday the Senate unanimously carried this<br />
resol ution: The Senate cornmends to the Parliaments of all<br />
the States the practice which has prevailed since 1949 whereby<br />
the States, when casual vacancies have occured, have<br />
chosen a Senator front the same political party as the<br />
senator who died or resigned.<br />
This a good and very proper ruJle good in principle<br />
and soun~ d in practice. Yet now the Premier of Ne wSouth<br />
Wales proposed to scrap it. But it's not just a<br />
convention, a custom he's throwing on the scrap-heap; it's the<br />
wishes of the people of New South Wales, recorded only 9<br />
months ago. The New South Wales proposal would make the senate<br />
as a whole even less representative of the opinion of the<br />
electors recorded in May. Instead of a Senate elected with<br />
Twenty-nine Labor senators, twenty-nine Liberal and<br />
Country Party senators and two Independent senatcrs there would<br />
be only twenty-eight Labor senators. / 3 </p>
<p>I believe AutwIralians of all political persuasions<br />
should be deeply concerned about these events and should<br />
express their concern. Certainly the voters of New South<br />
Wales who are about to be defrauded of their proper representation<br />
have very right to be aggrieved. But it's not<br />
only the majority who voted Labor who should feel<br />
incensed. I've always believed Liberal supporters have a<br />
deep commitmcnt to the prOper workings oE the Parliamentary<br />
system. Certainly any other commitment should be<br />
unthinkable for the party founded and led by Sir Robert<br />
Menzies. It is to all those thus committed that I make my appeal<br />
to express in whatever way you can to your mem srs of<br />
Parliament to ensure that our parliamentary system shall be<br />
given a chance to work.<br />
I've mentioned to you many times over the past<br />
year the unprecedented stresses that democracies and<br />
parliaments everywhere are now experiencing. The real<br />
difficulties are great enough without deliberate sabotage.<br />
I leave you with this very earnest question: If men in<br />
positions of power feel free to break the rules with<br />
impunity, how long will those who feel disadvantaged or<br />
deprived or denied of power play. to the rules? </p>
