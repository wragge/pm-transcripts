TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
-SPEECH TO THE AUSTRALIA REMEMBERS NATIONAL YOUTH FORUM,<br />
BRISBANE GIRLS' GRAMMAR SCHOOL, BRISBANE, 15 AUGUST 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
Can I say I am delighted to be at Brisbane Girls' Grammar School and to say<br />
how pleased I am that so many young Australians have taken up the theme of<br />
Australia Remembers and have engaged themselves with it.<br />
I think it is apparent to you, if it wasn't earlier, that most of the things we<br />
celebrate and the people we remember were young Australians in the main,<br />
young Australians as you are today young Australians and that they had all<br />
the hopes and aspirations that you have. They were very much at the point<br />
in their own lives, as many of you are at today, and yet at this level of the<br />
emotional development they carried the brute force of an assault upon<br />
themselves, upon their life, upon Australia and it was belief in this country, a<br />
belief in what we have created here, of what have we represented and faith in<br />
themselves and those around them that let them fight the fight against<br />
tyranny and oppression to a hard won victory which has given us all liberty<br />
and peace. I mean that is what we remember. Remember that faith and<br />
remember that belief.<br />
Perhaps it came home to me most when I was in Kokoda in 1992 on that<br />
same little green square that exists today, that existed then, where the first<br />
shots by Australian combatants against the Japanese marines in defence of<br />
Australia were fired. And that morning at 6.00 am, with the mist low over the<br />
village as it started to clear, young Australian men in shorts and singlets<br />
some 18 years of age, fought the best the Japanese Imperial Army could<br />
throw at them.<br />
Now that is people at Year 12 age, or approaching Year 12, to be sitting there<br />
in that tropical environment facing the strongest and the best combat troops<br />
the Japanese could throw at our country. So you had to believe in something<br />
and you had to have faith in something to carry on and they did and they<br />
fought a valiant fight for Australia and the rest is the history we know. </p>
<p>2<br />
That is who we are remembering and we see the diggers, now in their<br />
late 60s or their 70s or even the First World War diggers older than that, and<br />
you are prone to think about them, but you must think about them as young<br />
people because it was their young lives which were disrupted and it was the<br />
younger lives, the lives of even younger people, who were lost.<br />
I remember walking through the cemetery at Kanchanaburi in Thailand, not<br />
far from the Burma railway, looking at the number of young men, young<br />
Australians who died, the day that I was born 18 January 1944. And you<br />
know that it makes the point poignantly to you, they died so that your life<br />
could be complete and I said in the speech for the Unknown Soldier, when we<br />
buried the Unknown Soldier, that he was all of them, one of them, but one of<br />
us. And they all of them were one of us.<br />
I know we think today that we being the people of democracy and liberty, that<br />
of course we would have won the war. We will back it up that the right side<br />
won, the good people won, the good guys won. But it didn't necessarily have<br />
to go that way and in the war in Europe which is so inextricably linked to the<br />
war in the Pacific, that had Hitler made an assault on Britain in 1940, had he<br />
not attacked the Soviet Union in 1941, had the Russian people not held out<br />
Leningrad from 1941-1944, then we might have faced a completely different<br />
world. With a successful Nazi Germany, with the Russians not in the war, where we<br />
faced the Japanese with the United States, and the toe-hold in Normandy<br />
might just simply have been that a toe-hold and been simply as we<br />
remember Gallipoli from the First World War.<br />
The fact that we succeeded and had we not it would have been a race<br />
between Hitler and the United States to develop the nuclear weapon and it<br />
might not have been Hiroshima and Nagasaki, but it could have also been<br />
British cities and American cities. So it was close and I have no doubt that<br />
the United States once that great machine finally wound itself up, under the<br />
leadership of Franklin Roosevelt, that we would have defeated the Japanese<br />
in the Pacific. But it might have been a different war. The whole environment<br />
may have been different. But notwithstanding our sense of democracy and<br />
liberty in our righteousness we may not have been at least the early victors.<br />
So Australia was a more innocent country then and a small country.<br />
A smaller much more innocent place than today, where we are perhaps less<br />
naive and more worldly and so the assault and the affront was greater and<br />
one had to have that deep sense of democracy and that clear installation of<br />
the values to actually run a fight like this and to win. And so when we see our<br />
relatives, our dead relatives, laying around the battlefields of East Asia and<br />
Europe, we know that they were there confronting with some substantial<br />
uncertainty that period in their lives which may have seen a different world for<br />
them and for us.<br />
So it had to mean something. 50 years on, we can't say oh well that was just<br />
something in the past. This sort of stoicism, this sort of bravery, heroism, </p>
<p>belief in Australia, belief in what we created here, belief in our values, had to<br />
mean something. And so I am exceptionally pleased that so many<br />
Australians remember and so many young Australians remember and have<br />
learned about the period.<br />
Now today the Prime Minister of Japan made a statement and one that I think<br />
will bring substantial pleasure to many of us in this country and many of you<br />
I think all of you. And I will read some of it because I think it is a testimony to<br />
the battle that we fought. And he said, and I am reading part of it, " our task is<br />
to convey to younger generations the horrors of war so that we never repeat<br />
the errors in our history." This is what we have always asked of the<br />
Japanese. That they teach their children what happened. And he is saying<br />
that " our task is to convey to younger generations the horrors of war so that<br />
we never repeat the errors in our history. Furthermore I will continue in all<br />
sincerity to do my utmost in efforts being made on the issues arisen from the<br />
war, in order to further strengthen the relations of trust between Japan and<br />
those other countries. Now upon this historic occasion, the 50th anniversary<br />
of the war's end, we should bear in mind that we must look into the past to<br />
learn from the lessons of history and ensure that we do not stray from the<br />
path to peace and prosperity of human society in the future. We do not<br />
stray," he says. " During a certain period, in the not too distant past, Japan<br />
followed a mistaken national policy. Advanced on the road to war only to<br />
ensnare the Japanese people in a fateful crisis and through it colonial rule<br />
and aggression caused tremendous damage and suffering to the people of<br />
many countries, particularly those of Asian nations. In the hope that no such<br />
mistake be made in the future, I regard in the spirit of humility, these<br />
irrefutable facts of history and express here, once again, my feelings of deep<br />
remorse and state my heartfelt apology. Allow me also to express my<br />
feelings of profound mourning to all victims, both at home and abroad, of that<br />
history. Building from our deep remorse on this occasion of the<br />
anniversary of the end of the war, Japan must eliminate self-righteous<br />
nationalism, promote international coordination as a responsible member of<br />
the international community, and thereby advance these principles of peace<br />
and democracy." He finishes, amongst other things, by saying " it is my<br />
conviction that in this way alone can Japan atone for its past and lay to rest<br />
the spirits of those who perished. It is said that one can rely on good faith<br />
and so, in this time of remembrance, I declare to the people of Japan and<br />
abroad my intention to make good faith the foundations of our Government<br />
policy and this is my vow.'<br />
Now that is a powerful statement and one that acknowledges for many<br />
Australians the hurt that happened, the wrong that was done, the nationalism<br />
which was invested wrongly, mistakenly and the sorrow that it expressed.<br />
( tape break)<br />
We should never be at any stage sanguine about liberty and democracy.<br />
Those of you who are studying modem history will know that probably one of<br />
the shots that started the First World War was in Sarajevo in 1914 where a<br />
member of the then ruling royal family was assassinated and yet now, in </p>
<p>Sarajevo 80 years later we saw the force last week of 2700 people machine<br />
gunned and buried in mass graves, the sort of numbers that we as a country<br />
lost on the death march in Sandakan, which we now remember the detail. I<br />
think all that means to us is that we must be eternally vigilant about<br />
democracy and liberty and about the value of each human person and about<br />
human rights and it underlies again why we should remember, if not simply to<br />
remember the fight for liberty and democracy by those young Australians<br />
years ago. But, to remember how we need to be vigilant to preserve those<br />
liberties today. Thank you for being interested in this remembrance program.<br />
