TRANSCRIPT OF PRESS CONFERENCE, BURSWOOD ISLAND RESORT,<br />
PERTH 27 JANUARY 1989<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Inaudible<br />
PM* It is proceeding at a glacial pace, only one wicket<br />
down, it was one for twenty nine when I left I spoke to<br />
Allan Border last night and congratulated him and it would<br />
be a fair understatement to say he was somewhat elated.<br />
JOURNALIST: PM you predicted last night that interest rates<br />
would fall by the end of the year. Would you elaborate on<br />
that today, would you tell us do you mean housing rates?<br />
PM: elaborate on it in the sense that I was asked<br />
a simple question, did I think housing rates, interest rates<br />
would fall this year. It's January. The answer is obvious,<br />
housing rates included I believe, within the interest rate<br />
structure will fall sometime this year. It was not<br />
something that I profferred. I mean I was asked the<br />
question. I think it's obvious to say that at some stage<br />
this year they will fall, but the important point to make is<br />
this. That this Government has the responsibility to<br />
conduct overall economic policy in a way which is in -the<br />
best interests of this country. The economic situation,<br />
problem, if you like to put it that way, that we have at<br />
this time and over recent months is not a weak economy but a<br />
strong economy. one which is operating somewhat too<br />
strongly in the light of our external account problem.<br />
Therefore to ensure that we don't have an unsustainable<br />
level of imports, we've had to tighten monetary policy for<br />
that purpose. That policy that we have implemented will, we<br />
believe, in the weeks ahead have the affect of somewhat<br />
lowering the level of activity. That will occur in the<br />
context of a lowering of the inflation rate. Now when those<br />
things occur, as I believe they will, it's those sorts of<br />
circumstances which will produce the environment within<br />
which interest rates can fall. It would be quite improper<br />
for me and I don't purport to do it, certainly not for<br />
political reasons here where we have a State election just<br />
to say to the people of Western Australia, ' yes interest<br />
rates are going to fall'. I haven't come and said that, I<br />
haven't offered that observation as some sort of election<br />
bribe or bait but I honestly give that exposition as what I<br />
believe will be the situation in Australia this year. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Is there a chance the rates might rise before<br />
they fall?<br />
PM: No I don't believe so. I think that the level of rates<br />
now and the stance of monetary policy I believe it's<br />
appropriate for the purposes I've just expressed.<br />
JOURNALIST: Inaudible<br />
PM: No, I simply say what I said before and it may be<br />
useful to expound it here in the context of the<br />
considerations of the State election. What is certain is<br />
that the tax cuts for the lower and middle incomes will come<br />
in from 1 July as promised. And may I just say there as I<br />
said earlier today, these people in Australia, the people in<br />
those categories have in my judgement responded<br />
magnificently and responsibly to the requirements of the<br />
national economic policy over the last two or three years<br />
where the loss in our national income has demanded<br />
restraint. I am very conscious of the contribution that has<br />
been made and I've made the promise that as soon as we<br />
believe that responsibly we could give relief by way of tax<br />
cuts we would. That is why we have the stance of policy<br />
that we have now, to ensure that we will, with<br />
responsibility be able to bring the tax cuts in for those<br />
people from 1 July. So lower and middle income earners,<br />
here in Western Australia as in the rest of Australia, are<br />
going to get that benefit. Now as far as the top rates<br />
concerned, I don't give that unequivocal promise. We will<br />
have to consider whether in the overall framework of policy<br />
and in terms of equity considerations as well as economic<br />
considerations it is more appropriate for those of us in the<br />
highest rate to wait some time. We will have to, through<br />
time, bring that top rate down. You cannot responsibly<br />
maintain a gap between the or any significant gap<br />
between the corporate rate of 39 cents in the dollar and the<br />
top personal rate because if for any significant period of<br />
time, you maintain a large gap there is unquestionably an<br />
incentive to incorporate and to engage in tax minimisation<br />
or avoidance schemes. So the judgement will be, and I<br />
couldn't be more frank with the people of Australia on this,<br />
the judgement will be, will you need to make some adjustment<br />
at the same time on 1 July of the top rate and perhaps a<br />
later one, or can you delay it for some time and bring in<br />
the reductions later on. So those are the considerations, I<br />
couldn't put them more directly and more frankly. So our<br />
overwhelming responsibility and concern for is those lower<br />
and middle income ranges and they will be adjusted, as<br />
promised, from 1 July.<br />
JOURNALIST: Can you put a figure on the maximum weekly<br />
wage which will be given the tax cuts?<br />
PM: No I can't responsibly do that at this stage. You've<br />
got to understand that in these times when you talk about<br />
lower and middle income figures you go quite a way up the<br />
scale, you are talking over $ 30,000. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke is the decision to delay the top rate<br />
reductions a unanimous position of Cabinet due to<br />
Senator Walsh not come down at all?<br />
PM: Now be fair to Senator Walsh. I think you may be<br />
putting words in his mouth. I don't accept that of Senator<br />
Walsh's position, in the light of all considerations, that<br />
we will undertake, that there should be no reduction in the<br />
top rate. If you want to characterise my Government's<br />
approach to economic policy may I say in a moment by way of<br />
contrast to our opponents it's this. That we have<br />
demonstrated over our period of Government that when we come<br />
to a consideration of economic issues, people may go in<br />
there with some particular position. But there is an<br />
enormous responsibility and sense of responsibility in that<br />
Cabinet. They come in, they might have different prima<br />
facie positions, but they listen to the arguments and to the<br />
discussions and overwhelmingly we emerge from economic<br />
debate in the ERC and in the Cabinet with a unified position<br />
and that's one of the reasons why we've had such successful<br />
economic policy making under my Government. I think it is<br />
appropriate, without trying to make great political capital<br />
out of it, but it is the fact. That if you look at<br />
political and economic management in this country today,<br />
it's that which distinguishes Labor from our conservative<br />
opponents. They have an intrinsic incapacity to arrive at<br />
relevant policy decisions. They are wracked in Opposition<br />
by internal division and if you look at this State election<br />
campaign we're in now, you have the position where at the<br />
Federal level they are saying you shouldn't have tax cuts or<br />
if you should do something about tax cuts what you should do<br />
is to give tax deductions to those who are earning interest.<br />
That's what they've said federally. Now what's happened<br />
over here, Mr McKinnon has been faced with questions about<br />
that and one's not sure whether he's in favour of tax cuts<br />
or not, but you'd have to draw the conclusion that he'd a<br />
very considerable doubts about whether he would support tax<br />
cuts. But they have no doubts that they'd support tax cuts<br />
0 for those earning interest, which is another example of the<br />
way in which intrinsically the conservative parties in this<br />
country are still the same as they always were on the<br />
question of tax. For the conservative parties at a State<br />
and Federal levels, tax has never been an instrument of<br />
economics and equity. It's been a question of privilege for<br />
the most advantaged in this country. It's what<br />
characterised them in office. Remember this, that when they<br />
walked out of Government in March of 1983 they walked out of<br />
office with just about the most inefficient and inequitable<br />
tax system in the history of this country. Top rate of<br />
cents in the dollar, a great burden on the lower and middle<br />
income people because they had a tax system which ensured<br />
that those in this country with the greatest capacity to<br />
make a contribution to the public revenue were given the<br />
opportunity of avoiding that obligation. So everyone else<br />
had to pay more. Now that's where they've been, that's<br />
where they are now and the electors of Western Australia<br />
should remember that on this fundamental issue of standards,<br />
of welfare and of equity, that the Libs and the National </p>
<p>( PM cont): Party, tax is about propping up the privileged<br />
and putting more burden on the lower and middle income<br />
people. That's what distinguishes them from us.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, on the family allowance<br />
raucous, will you act to ensure that no-one is suffering as<br />
a result of the operating of payments system?<br />
PM: Let me say this raucous that is referred to is more<br />
properly described as an unmitigated beat-up by those who've<br />
written it. There is no substance in it at all and in fact<br />
the changes have meant a net cost to revenue to the<br />
Government. I have been so assured.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, do you share the concerns of<br />
some of your backbenchers about the Japanese<br />
investing in property<br />
PM: I do not make any racialist or nationalist<br />
discrimination in any area of policy. So you asked the<br />
question in regard to Japanese investment. The concept of<br />
discrimination against any race in any area of policy is<br />
anathema to me. Whether it be in immigration or investment,<br />
anathema to me on moral grounds, but it's also anathema I<br />
may say on economic grounds. If you wanted to think of<br />
something which would be profoundly against the interests of<br />
the Australian people it would be to say ' ho ho Mr Japan,<br />
Mrs Japan, now we like having you as our major trading<br />
partner, we do dearly want you to come and bring your most<br />
modern technology to assist us in developing our<br />
manufacturing and service industries, but Mr Mrs Japan<br />
we're going to distinguish against you'. Now if you really<br />
want to work out something that's against the interests of<br />
this, and the future generations of Australians, that's it.<br />
Now there may be a separate question as to whether in regard<br />
to foreign investment as a whole, you want to have certain<br />
capacities to monitor and that's why we have the Foreign<br />
Investment Review Board. That's why, in regard to<br />
residential acquisitions, we have previously bought in<br />
limitations there. But that has been on general<br />
macro-economic and investment grounds but while you have<br />
this Government you will never have discrimination on the<br />
basis of race or nationalism, in any area of our policies.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you need to look at the tightening of<br />
guidelines PM: I don't believe at this stage it is necessary.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, Peter Morris, Industrial Relations<br />
Minister, spoke about wage breakout are you worried<br />
about the possibility of a wages explosion and have you had<br />
special meetings with your Cabinet Ministers on this<br />
subject? </p>
<p>PM: special meeting, I mean I called a few of the<br />
ministers in and the reason I did this is was because I was<br />
going overseas. It's quite clear with the National wages<br />
Conference coming up in early February, I wanted to put in<br />
the minds of my relevant Ministers what I believed was the<br />
appropriate sort of considerations which shape our policy.<br />
I wasn't going to go overseas for a fortnight and leave them<br />
unaware of my thinking on this matter and they wanted to<br />
know exactly what I thought. -I made it clear what I thought<br />
should happen and I of course won't go into the details -of<br />
those discussions. It wasn't in any sense a secret meeting<br />
it was just what a Prime Minister essentially should do<br />
when he is going away for about a fortnight to pursue our<br />
international interests. I wanted to make sure that the<br />
increment of my thinking was on what was happening in the<br />
economic and the wages sphere and I have done that.<br />
Essentially, what it is about is what I've publicly<br />
expressed. We've got to have a situation in the wages area<br />
where the sorts of principles that have been enunciated are<br />
in fact given effect to. What are those principles? They<br />
are these. That we are about to engage in one of the most<br />
exciting and important changes in wage fixation in this<br />
country's history where wage increases will not simply be<br />
judged in terms of the financial benefit to employees as<br />
important and continually relevant to criterion that that<br />
is, but for the first time in a considered and structured<br />
way, wage movements are going to be related to the<br />
restructuring of the awards in this country. It's<br />
impossible to overstate in my judgement the importance of<br />
this development because what we are going to have now is a<br />
process whereby the awards of this country which represent<br />
an historical mishmash of development in outdated<br />
considerations, where, as you know in the metal trade, 360<br />
classifications reflecting outdated process of destruction<br />
are going to be swept aside and you are going to have<br />
reduced classifications which will facilitate the use of<br />
labour according to modern technologies and processes which<br />
is going to relate it-to relevant training programs and<br />
which is going to lead to more appropriate remuneration and<br />
more satisfying jobs. Now that's nothing less than that's<br />
what we're about so what I have been saying to my Ministers<br />
and what I want to say to the trade union and to the<br />
employers. Go into these wage processes now knowing that<br />
there must be wage increases, but that they must be<br />
associated with those objectives of award restructuring and<br />
that the aggregate outcome must be consistent with<br />
responsible economic policy. Now, that's what my<br />
ministers, they share my views and so I know that in the<br />
discussions which will start to occur with the trade unions<br />
while I'm away, there may even also in that period be some<br />
discussions with employers, that those principles will be<br />
uppermost in what they do. It was nothing more or less than<br />
that, that's what it was about. We must avoid, just to pick<br />
up one part of your question Amanda, we must avoid a wages<br />
explosion. I don't think it's going to happen, but it would<br />
be the height of futility for the trade union and indeed for<br />
the nation as a whole after the magnificent restraint that<br />
has been exercised which has produced, let me remind you, a<br />
rate of job creation four times higher than under our </p>
<p>6.<br />
( PM cont): conservative predecessors, more than twice as<br />
fast as the rest of the world. It would be the height of<br />
futility to throw that away now and I believe that they will<br />
have enough sense to see that that doesn't happen.<br />
JOURNALIST: Inaudible<br />
PM: well I see it as a reference to a shop steward's<br />
meeting. I had the opportunity of talking with some leaders<br />
of the trade union movement,-including leaders of the metal<br />
Trades. I'm confident the sort of considerations that I've<br />
talked about will be the ones that operate.<br />
JOURNALIST: Inaudible<br />
PM: No, but the other day when I was in Sydney, the metal<br />
trades leaders were there, there was a general discussion<br />
about the wages policy. You heard me in their presence<br />
addressing this issue and congratulating them on the way<br />
they'd approached in the past. There was no dissent from<br />
the general propositions I was putting. I've been in the<br />
trade union movement a fair while myself and I know you have<br />
claims and you have outcomes.<br />
JOURNALIST: And ambit claims?<br />
PM: Well I don't want to say just ambit claims, but I<br />
repeat you have claims and you have outcomes.<br />
JOURNALIST: Inaudible<br />
PM: Well I don't want to sound overly complacent or overly<br />
proud, but I simply say that my six years as Prime Minister<br />
leading this Labor Government has been characterised by a<br />
responsible and intimate relationship with both business and<br />
the trade union movement. In that respect we have a record<br />
which is envied around the world. I don't know whether over<br />
here you would have caught up with it, but the most<br />
impressive, and I don't say that in any derogatory way,<br />
because the gentleman in question wasn't here, he didn't<br />
come to Western Australia, that's the only reason that : 1 say<br />
it, but the Executive Director of the International Monetary<br />
Fund, Mr Michael Camdessus, who was in Australia last year.<br />
I had discussions with him and he had a press conference and<br />
was talking at various meetings and so on and he made the<br />
point that my Government's model of economic management<br />
including the question of relationships with business and<br />
the trade unions should serve as a model for the rest of' the<br />
world. So I go to that in response to your question as to<br />
whether I need to learn lessons from anyone. All I'm saying<br />
is that what's been said about the way I conduct with my<br />
Ministers, relations with business and with the trade union<br />
movement has been put up as a model for the rest of the<br />
world. So I don't think I have to learn lessons from<br />
anyone. JOURNALIST: Do you think it's unwise for the WA Government<br />
to get so closely involved with business people? </p>
<p>PM: I think in retrospect you could say that perhaps some<br />
things that might have been done differently.<br />
JOURNALIST: Such as?<br />
PM: Well, in regard to your general question about the<br />
relationship between Government and business here, but<br />
having said that, and don't go getting excited, Hawke says<br />
perhaps some things could have-been done differently<br />
Let me make the point, in the end what Government is about<br />
as far as the citizens under whom that Government operate<br />
and for whom that Government is relevant, the important<br />
thing is what is the impact of the relationships which<br />
Government has with business and the trade union movement<br />
upon the outcomes which affect their daily lives. I remind<br />
you of this fact. That under Labor in this State you have<br />
an outstanding economic achievement in terms of the<br />
interests of the citizens of this State. Let me remind you<br />
employment, unemployment, that's about the best employment<br />
record in Australia, of any State, the best record in the<br />
reduction of youth unemployment in regard to Government<br />
charges in the last twelve months, zero, and consistently<br />
below the rate of inflation, highest rate of economic<br />
growth. Now all these sorts of things that have occurred in<br />
this State, in the one and a quarter million jobs that have<br />
been created and a few would have been in Government, about<br />
158,000 of those occurred in this State,...... of its<br />
population, an enormous achievement. So when you look at<br />
all those things that this State Government has achieved,<br />
that in part has been a function of its capacity to relate<br />
to the business commmunity and the trade union movement. So<br />
if you look at the totality of what this Government has been<br />
about, it has a record and an outcome which is virtually<br />
second to none in this country.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime minister, has this Government made<br />
mistakes? PM: There is no Government, no Government anywhere in the<br />
democratic world that hasn't made mistakes, even mine.<br />
JOURNALIST: In this particular context?<br />
PM: Wait a minute. I would think that Mr Dowding has by<br />
his actions, I mean he's not a man whose said ' oh well a<br />
mistake has been made', he's gone about ensuring that in<br />
this area the proper processes in light of anything that's<br />
emerged will now be followed and that's a credit to Mr<br />
Dowding and to his Government<br />
JOURNALIST: Inaudible<br />
PM: Just a minute, I'm answering a question here, you want<br />
to have a debate do you? Do you think it's reasonable that<br />
I should finish answering this question? Now, what I'm<br />
saying is that there have been steps taken to create a new<br />
situation and I believe that they will be effective. while<br />
still retaining the capacity of this Government to deal with </p>
<p>( PM cont): properly with the business community and the<br />
trade unions. I don't think that one has to come unduly<br />
critical, I mean has a new Premier faced up to the situation<br />
and taken the appropriate steps. I get down to the point.,<br />
let me say that as a Government has made mistakes, if you<br />
want to get to the question in terms of any suggestion of:<br />
finality or corruption, no suggestion in regard to Labor in<br />
this State. There is only one side of politics in this<br />
country where that occurs. Th-at is where you have a Liberal<br />
National Party coalition, Queensland and now the emerging<br />
scene in New South Wales.<br />
JOURNALIST: I'm just wondering whether you thought the<br />
critical of the Government, taxpayers money into the<br />
Teachers Society bailout, which comes under Government<br />
jurisdiction and also the $ 135m investment in the<br />
Petrochemicals Plant which wasn't an objective sufficient. on<br />
its own. It was done to extricate the original<br />
guarantee Rothwells......<br />
PM: what I have said on this issue, apart from a question<br />
about it, I don't pretend from the position of my Government<br />
to be able to be across all the details, considerations,<br />
that were involved in the rescue of teachers credit union.<br />
It is well known that there were valid considerations in<br />
terms of equity that were involved in protecting interests<br />
of small people that motivated the Government then. I<br />
wasn't and can't be across all these details and<br />
considerations that were involved there, but there were<br />
certainly valid considerations involved and as far as the<br />
Petro Chemical industry is concerned, it is quite clear that<br />
there is a distinct possibility for State of the<br />
establishment of a significant industry, both in terms of<br />
output and this employment. So it would be wrong, all I can<br />
say, it would be wrong to analyse those two considerations<br />
in terms only of some suggestion of a relationship with the<br />
business community that you mightn't like. There were<br />
certain valid considerations in both cases. I think the<br />
Premier, Mr Dowding, has been open about those issues and<br />
the whole question of the relationship between Government<br />
and business. He is proceeding along lines which are<br />
appropriate and which are open and which overall, as I go<br />
back to a previous answer I have given, are dominated by one<br />
consideration and one consideration only. What's going tc) be<br />
in the best interests of this State and let me say of<br />
Premier Dowding, I've been around in Australian politics for<br />
a long, long time now and I find it difficult to recall ai<br />
Premier who in such a short time has imprinted such a<br />
significant personal and responsible stamp of authority on<br />
Government as is Peter Dowding.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, Alan Bond said of Dowding, said he is<br />
the same mould as leaders like Greiner, Bush, Thatcher. Do<br />
you agree with that? </p>
<p>PM: It's not quite how I would have expressed it. Let me<br />
say this, at least about Thatcher and Reagan because I don't<br />
think anyone would be holding Mr Greiner up as a model at<br />
the moment. But I have had my differences with Margaret<br />
Thatcher and President Reagan but there are elements in<br />
their leadership, which are to be admired. Indeed, in the<br />
case of President Reagan, I say as I've said publicly in the<br />
United States and here, I think that when the history books<br />
are written President Reagan will go down as one of the<br />
great Presidents of the United States.<br />
JOURNALIST: What is your summation of Barry McKinnon?<br />
PM: Well, as you know I'm one of the more charitable<br />
characters in Australian politics and I don't know Mr<br />
McKinnon very well. I think I've met him once, but I would<br />
have to say, I think the fairest thing I can say is that<br />
I would share the apparent judgement of the West Australian<br />
people who know him much better. By a margin of two or<br />
three to one, they prefer Peter Dowding as Premier and I<br />
reckon they are right.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, how will history judge Brian Burkes's<br />
PM: That's a good question, I think you have to say this<br />
about history. History has a changing perspective. I would<br />
think if the historian were writing the book now it would be<br />
a little bit jaundiced because the highlight, the focus<br />
would be on aspects of the Premiership, about relationships<br />
with business, which certainly at the moment are not heavily<br />
coloured in Brian Burke's favour, but if you are going to do<br />
a full assessment of Brian Burke's Premiership I think you<br />
would emerge well because these sorts of achievements that I<br />
have talked about, of the western Australian Labor<br />
Government in the period since ' 83 mark it down as an<br />
outstandingly successful Government in Perth of the<br />
interests of the people of this State. Economic growth,<br />
just about the best employment record, about the best record<br />
in regard to Government services and charges, reduction of<br />
youth unemployment. Now all those are the things which<br />
determine on a day to day sense the welfare of the citizens<br />
of Western Australia and Brian Burke was very much<br />
associated with all of that.<br />
JOURNALIST: comments on Brian Burke meaning that you<br />
would still welcome him in Canberra working if he decided to<br />
go there after his stint in Dublin?<br />
PM: Well that's a real hypothetical one isn't it? A real<br />
hypothetical one. I have made it clear that I think Brian<br />
Burke had outstanding political attributes, but the question<br />
you ask is quite hypothetical. it's not fair to him or to<br />
anyone else to answer it I don't think.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, have you discussed with Mr Dowding<br />
the reports of funding requests for the Party from South<br />
African Airways? </p>
<p>PM: South African Airways? No I've had no discussions with<br />
him about that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Inaudible<br />
PM: I would think it was probably a slip. I can't imagine<br />
seriously I think I saw a report, the Secretary of the<br />
Party, Stephen Smith said that if any donation were to be<br />
forthcoming it would be sent back. I think I saw that<br />
report. Certainly it would be my position.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, is Alan Bond a big financial backer<br />
of Labor Party?<br />
PM: I don't know whether he's a big financial<br />
JOURNALIST: Has he made any campaign contributions<br />
O PM: I don't know. I mean, there are people here you could<br />
ask. Whether they'd answer you or not I don't know.<br />
0 III </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Do you expect to see Simon Crean in Federal<br />
Parliament after the next election and if you do, and,<br />
you're in a position<br />
PM: That's a double hypothetical, that's a beauty. As far<br />
as I know, what Simon Crean is saying is that he has at this<br />
point no intention of making that move. There are<br />
precedents for this, for people in that position to move.<br />
Whether he will or not, Simon-will make the decision. He's<br />
certainly an excellent President of the ACTU though we'd<br />
miss him if he did make the move. But that's the answer so<br />
therefore I've got no thinking in my mind of, if he were to<br />
do it, what his role would be.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, have you made any assessment of what<br />
the likely outcome of the West Australian election will be?<br />
PM: I've talked to people, I've seen research, I've seen<br />
today's poll in the West Australian which has Labor winning,<br />
I saw the Morgan poll on Wednesday which had Labor winning,<br />
and I've done my own poll talking to people I meet in shops<br />
and drivers and things like that. They seem to think<br />
Labor's going to win. But I'm never complacent about<br />
elections. I think the best way of saying it is it's going<br />
to be a fairly tight election and I'm certain that Labor<br />
deserves to win and I think it will.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is it also true that your own Party polling is<br />
still showing Labor behind?<br />
PM: I don't go into any details of what our polling shows.<br />
JOURNALIST: Including deny.<br />
PM: I neither confirm nor deny appropriate policy at<br />
certain times.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke it is a fact that it will be a close<br />
* election fallout in WA Inc and the goings on here?<br />
PM: I don't think there's any doubt that all the publicity<br />
around that issue has been adverse to the Party. I've said<br />
that.<br />
JOURNALIST: what do you think of the argument that<br />
interest rate rises we've had recently will cancel out the<br />
tax cuts?<br />
PM: Well, it's invalid because the calculation will in fact<br />
show that in overall terms, taking into account movements in<br />
the cost of living into which interest rates are factors I<br />
mean, it's not as though you have calculations which<br />
ignore interest rates. That's taken into cost of living<br />
calculations and it's combination of movements in the cost<br />
of living, wages and tax cuts will involve an improvement in<br />
the standards of living and the people of Western Australia<br />
can be certain of that. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, an ALP poll indicates that the<br />
independent and minor party candidates are attracting 12--15%<br />
of votes in marginal seats.<br />
PM: know more about ALP polling than I do. Is that<br />
right?<br />
JOURNALIST: That's what Mr Cameron is saying.<br />
PM: I see.<br />
JOURNALIST: Does that worry you Labor Party on Federal<br />
indicators and also does it indicate a disatisfaction with<br />
the two major parties in this State?<br />
PM: No, I think if you look at politics around the western<br />
world, not just in Australia, that you are seeing as a<br />
feature of the western political scene in the most<br />
recent period present, that you are seeing the emergence<br />
of more minor parties. It's not just something that is<br />
exclusive to Australia. In the end the Australian people<br />
may move some of their votes away from the major parties but<br />
under our system of voting there's got to be a final<br />
allocation of preferences and I have no doubt that when the<br />
people, either directly or indirectly by a vote for a minor<br />
party, have to make a decision between Labor with its<br />
magnificent achievements and the coalition, they'll come our<br />
way. Let's be particular about this State. You've got a<br />
Government, a Labor Government here in this State led by an<br />
outstanding Premier which has produced just about the best<br />
results on the economic and social front of any government<br />
in Australia. You've got that on one hand and on the other<br />
what have you got? You've got the Liberals and the National<br />
Party. If there's one feature about the West Australian<br />
political scene which stands out more than anything else,<br />
it's the disarray, the disaffection, the bitterness, the<br />
lack of correlation of policies between the Libs and the<br />
National Party. They can't govern themselves, they can't<br />
govern the State.<br />
JOURNALIST: But Mr Hawke, the Labor Government could have<br />
done a lot better if it hadn't put money into TCS, Rothwells<br />
and Petrochemicals.<br />
PM: I've answered all those questions and I've put it in<br />
aggregate as achievements. And the aggregate of achievement<br />
is that the record of Labor in this State is one of the<br />
outstanding records of achievement of any government in<br />
Australia over this period. whether you look at the issue<br />
of employment, unemployment, prices, economic growth,<br />
government charges, they stand out as the best in Australia.<br />
You journalists sitting around here might want to say and<br />
I'm not saying that critically you might want to write<br />
your story about WA Inc and if I was in your position I'd<br />
probably do some writing about it too. But don't delude.<br />
yourselves that as far as Mr and Mrs voter are concerned </p>
<p>13<br />
PM ( cont): that they disregard the question of achievement<br />
in the areas of employment, unemployment, prices, housing<br />
the lowest housing cost of any Australian state. Now all<br />
these things are the achievements of Labor and when Mr and<br />
Mrs and Miss Western Australia have to go into that ballot<br />
box on 4 February they are going to be making a decision as<br />
to whether a Labor government which has produced the best<br />
result of any government in Australia is going to be or<br />
whether you're going to put irr-the Libs and the National<br />
Party who can't agree on anything, who detest one another<br />
and who contradict one another on everything, who, as I say,<br />
can't govern themselves but yet ask to govern the state.<br />
And in the end that's the sharp, hard decision that the<br />
electors of Western Australia have to take. I believe that<br />
in their own self interest it's clear that those interests<br />
will be significantly better served by voting for Labor.<br />
