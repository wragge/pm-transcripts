PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMENT TO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES BY THE<br />
PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING, 2 FEBRUARY 1995<br />
BEATIFICATION OF MARY MACKILLOP<br />
On behalf of the Leader of the House, I move that this House:<br />
Acknowledges the Beatification by His Holiness, Pope John<br />
Paul 11o, f Mother Mary MacKillop, founder of Australia's first<br />
religious order, the Congregation of the Sisters of St Joseph;<br />
and Recognises the contribution to the people and society of<br />
Australia by Blessed Mary MacKillop and the beneficent and<br />
enduring work of the Congregation of the Sisters of St Joseph<br />
Mr Speaker<br />
The recent beatification of Mother MacKillop by His Holiness the Pope<br />
bestowed a great honour on a great Australian.<br />
Mary MacKillop's aid for the poor, particularly the rural poor, and her<br />
creation of the Order of the Sisters of St Joseph to spread and<br />
maintain her vision and her work is now, of course, a part of the<br />
Australian legend.<br />
I hope that hereafter it will form a much larger part.<br />
I say this in the first place because the qualities of charity, sacrifice,<br />
courage and perseverance are qualities for a nation to live by and<br />
ideals to encourage in future generations of Australians.<br />
We would all hope to see them inform the lives of Australians,<br />
including the lives of governments those whose privilege and<br />
responsibility it is to make policy. </p>
<p>Mary MacKillop's sympathies were with those of the underdogs of<br />
society, the people on the margins and that is where, traditionally,<br />
Australian sympathies have lied.<br />
We should never lose, I think, those sympathies or lose sight of them.<br />
We should be guided by them. They are as relevant now as they were<br />
c 6L1 , i y aego.<br />
That seems to me the great contemporary lesson of Mary MacKillop, to<br />
look after those on the margins, to care for them, to bring them in, and<br />
to give them hope.<br />
I hope Mary MacKillop becomes a prominent figure in our history and<br />
our consciousness also for another reason. And that is because she<br />
was a woman.<br />
As I said on the arrival of the Pope in Australia, while women<br />
pioneered this country as much as men, the contribution of women has<br />
not always been adequately acknowledged.<br />
Women brought their labour and courage and moral strength to the<br />
frontier of Australia, which in earlier times needed some moral<br />
strength, and they continue to bring it to the modern Australian<br />
community. They have been defining forces in our economic and social<br />
development and in our national character.<br />
That is why I say that, in honouring Mary MacKillop, his Holiness has<br />
honoured all Australian women and I believe he has honoured us all.<br />
Indeed, in moving this motion today, I want to stress the broad appeal<br />
and significance of Mary MacKillop.<br />
In a sectarian age, she was avowedly non-sectarian.<br />
She drew support from Catholics and non-Catholics alike. Protestants<br />
and Jews were her friends and supporters.<br />
Years before the federation of the nation, her view was national. She<br />
thought as an Australian in Australian terms. Born into a Gaelicspeaking<br />
Scottish family, she spoke as an Australian. She began in a<br />
letter to the Vatican, and one has to remember it a century ago, with<br />
the words: " It is an Australian who speaks."<br />
For a century ago, though most people would refer to themselves as<br />
Australians, the notion of writing as an Australian would, I think, have<br />
been somewhat unusual. She said as an " Australian who speaks." </p>
<p>I trust honourable members will see what I mean when I say that the<br />
beatification of Mother Mary MacKillop rings with significance for all<br />
Australians. The qualities she embodied openness and tolerance, courage,<br />
persistence, faith, care for others are quajiiies for individuais,<br />
'-UIii II LIC6 dI1t. J ( N2iauuiS 1U IIVe LUy.<br />
The Josephites continue to practice these virtues in their work for the<br />
poor in Australia, New Zealand and, increasingly, in the countries of<br />
the Third World.<br />
I think all honourable members will agree that we will serve Australia<br />
well, and future generations of Australians well, if we allow the values<br />
which inspired and guided Mary MacKillop's work to inspire and guide<br />
our own.<br />
There is nothing to be gained from pretending that religious faith and<br />
the place of the church in our communities has not declined since<br />
Mary MacKillop's day.<br />
Yet the message of her life easily translates to our much more<br />
sceptical and secular society.<br />
And it would bring a blessing on Australia and on future generations if,<br />
as a result of the beatification of Mary MacKillop, that message spread.<br />
Societies, I think, always need faith, they certainly need hope and<br />
charity and they are the things which Mary MacKillop had in<br />
abundance. Our children will always need a spiritual dimension to their<br />
lives. A point His Holiness made very poignantly during his visit to<br />
Australia and one I'm sure everyone in this House endorses.<br />
I happen to think that in the traditions of this country and the quality of<br />
our people and institutions there is fertile grounds for these ideals to<br />
flourish. I think people are looking for guidance and a spiritual<br />
dimension to their lives and the lessons which we take from that great<br />
strength that Mary Mackillop had is something, I'm sure, the country<br />
can emulate into the future.<br />
I commend the motion to the House.<br />
ends </p>
