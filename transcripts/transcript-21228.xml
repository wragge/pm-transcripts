    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to announce new medals which will be awarded for service in the Iraq and Afghanistan campaigns.  Her Majesty The Queen has approved the establishment of specific campaign medals for members of the Australian Defence Force who have been deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan.  These medals will be known as the Iraq Medal and the Afghanistan Medal.</p>
<p>Australia has made a significant contribution in both Iraq and Afghanistan in pursuing the cause of freedom and stability.  These campaigns have not only been in the international interest but have also been in Australia';s national interest.  Our military forces are defending and representing the values of Australia.</p>
<p> Personnel who serve in relevant operational areas for 30 days or more will qualify for the campaign medals.  These medals are in addition to the award of the Australian Active Service Medal.</p>
<p>  The Government believes that two medals are warranted to adequately recognise the sustained contribution made by the Australian Defence Force in these two operational theatres.  Our servicemen and women have been at the forefront of combat fighting in very difficult circumstances and are also making a significant contribution to the rehabilitation and future of Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>
<p>There are also many civilians who have made a notable contribution to the rehabilitation of Iraq and to meeting the humanitarian needs of the people of Iraq.</p>
<p>I am therefore very pleased to announce that the Governor-General has recently approved the Iraq clasp for the Humanitarian Overseas Service Medal (HOSM).  This award recognises that spirit of generosity in many of our fellow Australians who willingly go to areas of great humanitarian need, at some risk to themselves, to offer assistance.</p>
<p>Civilians working with our coalition partners in the Coalition Provisional Authority are taking a central role in the rehabilitation of the agricultural sector.  Others are working with United Nations bodies and Australian NGOs such as Care Australia and World Vision Australia providing much needed assistance in the areas of water, sanitation, education and health.  Civilians who serve in the declared operational area undertaking humanitarian work for an eligible organisation for 30 days or more will qualify for this award.</p>
<p>On behalf of the nation I thank all those members of the Australian Defence Force and our  Australian civilians who have served with such distinction in Iraq and Afghanistan  </p>
