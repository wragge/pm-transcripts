    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am attending the Anzac Day commemoration service today with Australian troops and diplomatic staff in Baghdad.</p>
<p>Together with the Minister assisting the Minister for Defence, Mr Mal Brough and the Chief of the Defence Force, General Peter Cosgrove, I am in Iraq for the dawn service at Baghdad airport.</p>
<p>  Before departing for Iraq I met defence personnel in the Middle East engaged in providing military transport services to the region.</p>
<p>The trip to Iraq is in recognition of the great sacrifice and contribution Australian personnel are making there in challenging conditions.  They are following in the footsteps of countless other Australians who have served the nation in many other parts of the globe.</p>
<p>I am certain that all Australians will join me in expressing heartfelt thanks for their efforts. They continue a great tradition of commitment and sacrifice by Australian service personnel.</p>
<p> In remembering those who in the past have given their lives defending our freedoms and way of life, we should also honour those who today put their lives at risk in the service of Australia.  </p>
