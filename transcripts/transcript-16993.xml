    <content><![CDATA[<p>2009 has been an extraordinary year for the world.</p>
<p>2009 has also been an extraordinary year for Australia.</p>
<p>We saw the inauguration of the first African-American President of the United States, an historic moment that was unimaginable just a generation ago.</p>
<p>We saw the world grapple with its most serious financial and economic crisis since the Great Depression, three quarters of a century ago.</p>
<p>We saw Australia take its permanent place at the table of the G20, the world body now charged with steering the way through the current global economic crisis, and finding a better way to manage our economies in the future- to ensure such a meltdown never happens again. </p>
<p>2009 also saw all the countries of the world grappling with climate change, this common threat to us all.</p>
<p>We saw more than 90% of world leaders supporting the Copenhagen Accord on climate change- by no means a perfect agreement, Australia wanted much more.</p>
<p>But an agreement nonetheless, where the alternative was complete collapse, and total inaction.</p>
<p>Globally, we've agreed for the first time that temperature increases must be kept within two degrees Centigrade.</p>
<p>Globally, we've agreed for the first time that both rich and poor countries will act to bring down their carbon emissions in order to contain increases in global temperatures.</p>
<p>As one of the hottest and driest continents on earth, Australia is experiencing the impact of climate change first, and hardest.</p>
<p>We therefore have a deep national interest in global and national action on climate change.</p>
<p>If we do not act at home and abroad, we betray both our children's future, and their ability to enjoy our natural wonders, including the Barrier Reef.</p>
<p>In 2009, the Government also honoured its commitment to bring our combat troops home from Iraq- but our troops remain in the field in Afghanistan, the Middle East, the Solomons, East Timor and elsewhere.</p>
<p>And we thank them for their service, their sacrifice, and their professionalism.</p>
<p>On the sporting field, we lost the Ashes.</p>
<p>But our opportunity for revenge against the old enemy starts at the end of next year, and with a vengeance.</p>
<p>And I'm sure all Australians will get behind our Olympians and Paralympians, this February and March in Vancouver.</p>
<p>For many Australians, 2009 was a very difficult year. </p>
<p>The impacts of the devastating Black Saturday bushfires in Victoria are still being felt, as are the after effects of the floods in North Queensland and Northern New South Wales, and the cyclones which struck Western Australia.</p>
<p>The global financial crisis has put families and small businesses around Australia under great stress.</p>
<p>The Government took early and decisive action to cushion Australia from the worst impacts of this global meltdown.</p>
<p>And across the nation, the building of infrastructure projects that will continue to support jobs and small businesses, are taking shape.</p>
<p>Throughout 2010, new halls, new libraries, new language and science centres will be built at schools right across Australia, supporting the needs of the next generation of children- while providing work for local small businesses, and jobs for local tradies.</p>
<p>Solar panels are being installed in houses and schools.</p>
<p>Houses are being insulated.</p>
<p>Local community projects, from better parks, better stormwater and drainage systems, and better sporting facilities, are all under way.</p>
<p>Some are completed, many more are in progress.</p>
<p>Roads are being upgraded.</p>
<p>Railway crossings are being made safer.</p>
<p>Ports are being expanded.</p>
<p>And we are building a national high-speed broadband network for the future.</p>
<p>We are all now engaged in nation-building for recovery, nation-building for the future.</p>
<p>Supporting jobs, apprenticeships and small businesses today, while building the infrastructure we all need for tomorrow.</p>
<p>So far, in large part because of the early decisive actions we've all taken, Australia has escaped the worst impacts of the global meltdown.</p>
<p>We've outperformed other advanced economies during the global recession.</p>
<p>We are the only one of the thirty three advanced economies to have positive economic growth in the last year.</p>
<p>We have the second lowest unemployment of the major advanced economies, and we have the lowest debt, and the lowest budget deficit.</p>
<p>And we are the only one not to have gone into recession.</p>
<p>We've all been encouraged by the determination of employers to keep as many of their staff on as possible.</p>
<p>And by the willingness of workers and unions to cooperate with employers, to find innovative ways around this crisis.</p>
<p>The Government is determined to do everything in its power to support Australian families, Australian jobs, and Australian small businesses, as we move slowly into the recovery phase.</p>
<p>The great message from 2009 is that because we've been all in this together, we've all worked together. And together we are seeing Australia through this crisis, which has devastated so much of the rest of the world.</p>
<p>And that, my fellow Australians, is the message that we must take into 2010.</p>
<p>Australians are a resilient lot, we're a tough lot.</p>
<p>And we are practical about what needs to be done.</p>
<p>And we come together to meet a common challenge.</p>
<p>And there'll be plenty of those in 2010.</p>
<p>So to all Australians, whether you're at the beach or in the bush, in our great cities, or in our country towns, in the suburbs or in the outback, I'd like to wish each and every one of you a safe, healthy, happy and prosperous new year.</p>
