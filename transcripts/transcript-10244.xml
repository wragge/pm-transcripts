TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MIN4STER, THE HON. JOHN HOWARD<br />
AND THE PRIME MINISTER OF NEW ZEALAND,<br />
THE HON. JIM BOLGER<br />
PARLIAMENT BUILDING, WELLINGTON<br />
E O E<br />
BOLGER: Good morning. I was just advising Prime Minister John Howard that the cricket was<br />
looking reasonably well according to my staff as I came out of Cabinet. Can I just<br />
begin this joint press conference by welcoming Prime Minister John Howard to it,<br />
thank him for the opportunity that his visit has provided for both of us to have a range<br />
of discussions both informally and this morning more formally on a variety of issues.<br />
There are the ones that have been identified in various commentaries and media<br />
comment but we have ranged wider than that in terms of the informal discussions we<br />
have had and the structure of the visit enabling us to spend considerably more time<br />
together, I have found immensely valuable. We have just talked through issues as<br />
Trans Tasman neighbours and Trans Tasman friends and I just want to say at this time,<br />
from our perspective, the relationship with the new Australian Government and with<br />
the policies that have an impact on Trans Tasman relationship, I don't think have ever<br />
been better. I mean, obviously there are issues we have to work through and you will<br />
want to raise some of those, but if you talk about the totality of the relationship and the<br />
common approach and the common principles that are driving various policy initiatives<br />
and policy developments in the two countries, there is a very, very broad base of<br />
commonality. So John, thank you for coming, thank you for the warm friendship you<br />
have displayed in terms of the discussions we have had. The understanding you have<br />
had for the New Zealand position on various issues. Your officials have been<br />
constructive and helpfuil and I might add, as well as working through issues, so thank<br />
you very much and I will just hand it over to you and then I have no doubt that the </p>
<p>journalists from New Zealand and Australia will one of ask one or two easier<br />
questions. HOWARD: Well thank you very much Jim, I would like ladies and gentlemen to echo everything<br />
that the New Zealand Prime Minister has said. I came here for a number of reasons,<br />
not least was to get an idea of the priorities of the newly established Coalition<br />
Government in New Zealand. The visit has been a very strong reminder to me of how<br />
much the two countries mean to each other and the easy informality which comes of a<br />
naturally close friendship and it's a friendship that like all close friendships, should be<br />
kept in good repair and I have seen the last couple of days as an exercise in keeping a<br />
close friendship in good repair and certainly there is no relationship between two<br />
countries which has a stronger history than the relationship between our two countries,<br />
but it is not a relationship that is steeped in the past, it is a very contemporary<br />
relationship. We have been able to compare notes on economic reform. The Liberal<br />
party of Australia and the Nationals in New Zealand have quite a lot in common<br />
philosophically and we have watched many of the changes that have been undertaken<br />
in New Zealand over the past very years, economic changes, with a great deal of<br />
interest and in some areas, quite a lot of areas, a good deal of admiration. I have<br />
especially valued the opportunity of furthering the close personal association that the<br />
New Zealand Prime Minister and I have had for a number of years. I have appreciated<br />
the fact that he was the first overseas leader to speak to me after the election last<br />
March. We met very earlier in Sydney, we have met on a number of occasions at<br />
meetings, the South Pacific Forum, the A. PEC meeting, and we have kept in regular<br />
contact on the telephone. I certainly would agree with the Prime Minister that the<br />
relationship has never been better. I would like to believe as I know he would, that the<br />
good and easy personal relationship that we have established, and I am sure we will<br />
maintain, has played no small part in that very happy state of affairs. Thank you.<br />
BOLGER: Thanks, thanks John. All right who wants to be first.<br />
JOURNALIST: Michael Gordon from the Australian newspaper. Did you discuss New Zealand's<br />
defence spending and did you discuss the question of the outstanding two frigates<br />
where New Zealand will exercise its options ( inaudible)?<br />
HOWARD:<br />
Well, let me say that the issue of defence was certainly discussed yes and I explained<br />
the very high priority that Australia places on defence. The fact that in the first budget<br />
of my Government defence expenditure was quarantined from expenditure cuts, I made<br />
it clear, as I will be at the luncheon today, that the same will obtain in the forthcoming<br />
budget. Defence in Australia will be quarantined from further cuts in the forthcoming<br />
budget. We see defence, the defence investment as being a very important element of<br />
our projection and influence in the region. We also see it as a essential concomitant of </p>
<p>the relationship with the United States. We place, as does New Zealand, a great deal<br />
of emphasis on the CDR and I have made very clear what the position of the Australian<br />
Government is on defence matters.<br />
JOURNALIST: Fleur Bitcon Channel 9. What is that position?<br />
HOWARD: Well I have just explained the great importance that Australia<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you saying then you have encouraged New Zealand to take..<br />
HOWARD: Of look, the question of how much New Zealand spends on defence or social security<br />
or indeed anything else is a matter for New Zealand. As I said yesterday, I haven't<br />
come here to give public lectures. I don't go to any country giving public lectures.<br />
BOLGER: Can I just pick it up. Thank you John. We certainly have discussed the issue of<br />
defence amongst many other issues and we had a chat this morning in the meeting in<br />
the Cabinet room, where the Minister of Defence was in attendance as well. Our<br />
approach is very clear, and it is documented in part in the decision we made as a new<br />
Government to get a defence assessment produced by officials, to determine the<br />
priorities and the options that the Coalition Government has in terms of defence<br />
spending, and will make judgement calls from that. We have also in the Coalition<br />
document identified the need to maintain a professional well-equipped defence force,<br />
to meet both our close security arrangements and also the security arrangements we<br />
have in the region and sometimes on an international basis. Central to this issue, from<br />
a New Zealand perspective, is a closer defence relationship we have with Australia, we<br />
make no bones about that, that is very important to us, and we thank the Australian<br />
Governments, successive Australian Governments for the input they have made for<br />
that closer defence relationship. Now you will all want to ask have we made decisions<br />
on the frigates, so I might as well say that and deal with that in advance. The answer is<br />
no we haven't, because we don't have to make decisions on the frigates until nearly the<br />
end of this year. Clearly, in the assessment that is coming through from officials over<br />
the next few weeks, that will be there on the agenda item with many, many other items<br />
of capital expenditure that the New Zealand Government will have to address. The<br />
first of those, of course, are the replacement helicopters, we advanced that issue<br />
substantially before the election. At that stage the Australian Government had not<br />
advanced its decision making process to quite the same degree. It seems sensible and I<br />
think constitutionally correct not to enter into that final decision until the election was<br />
held and the Government was formed, and we anticipate to be in a position to make<br />
that decision, possibly by the end of next month, thereabouts. So that one will move </p>
<p>ahead of all the other proposals that will come forward for capital equipment and the<br />
like for the defence forces.<br />
JOURNALIST: Louise Dodson, Financial Review. Were you able to win any concession on New<br />
Zealand apples and also getting a commitment from Mr Howard on lowing tariffs on<br />
cars? BOLGER: Tariffs on cars was not an issue that we discussed, formally or informally. On the<br />
question on those sanitary arrangements, there are two issues there, of course, apples<br />
and salmon from New Zealand. Both of which are going through due process in the<br />
Australian system. The one on apples is further advanced than the one on salmon.<br />
Naturally we hope from our side that the analysis made by the officials, the appropriate<br />
officials will come out positively in terms on New Zealand's exports to Australia. But<br />
it wasn't a question of pressuring the Prime Minister on that, he was able to advise that<br />
the process is proceeding as understood by us, and they will produce a<br />
recommendation in due course.<br />
JOURNALIST: Linda Clark What logic would convince you that New Zealand did indeed need two<br />
extra frigates?<br />
BOLGER: I wouldn't answer that in the way you put that at the moment Linda, we have got to<br />
get all the options in front of us and you say what logic would convince us on that.<br />
What we have to do is determine the overall defence investment that we have to make<br />
in capital equipment, replacement equipment, and the like, and then establish priorities<br />
for that. The first two frigates are well on track. We will have the first one Te Kaha<br />
transferred or officially handed over to the New Zealand Navy in the next few weeks,<br />
that is not that far away and we will just progressively work our way forward from<br />
that. When the last Labor Government in 1989 when did they do it, 1989, signed the<br />
agreement with the then Australian Government on the purchase of frigates, under a<br />
joint arrangement, it was on the basis that we would review the circumstances in New<br />
Zealand by the end of this year, and make a decision on the next stage, and that it<br />
exactly would, we would do. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: David Barber, National Business Review. Would you like to see New Zealand, back<br />
into ALNZUS or do you regard New Zealand's membership as ANZUS as a now a dead<br />
letter that AUSMIN has replaced it as far as you are concerned?<br />
HOWARD: Well certainly, the AUSM[ N association is a very effective and a very close one, but<br />
you will be aware that what Australia has endeavoured to do since the ANZUS<br />
relationship changed somewhat in the 1980s, Australia has endeavoured to on the one<br />
hand maintain a close defence and security relationship with New Zealand and also<br />
with the United States. The question of how New Zealand behaviours vis a vis the<br />
United States, is a matter for New Zealand. You are aware and I think all here aware<br />
and the Australian public are aware, of the great importance my Government places on<br />
the close security relationship with the United States and we are very close to New<br />
Zealand as well. It is not for me to say to New Zealand what New Zealand should do.<br />
That is a matter for the New Zealand people and for the New Zealand Government. I<br />
have made it clear on all these defence issues, my views and that of my Government's<br />
and the importance we place on the defence investment for Australia, but I am simply<br />
not going to get into the business of public lecturing or advising another Government,<br />
that, that is not the role of a friend and close ally.<br />
BOLGER: Can I for the benefit of the Australian media, just say in case there is any view in your<br />
mind that New Zealand and the United States do not have any defence contracts, the<br />
Minister of Defence has just arrived back in New Zealand this weekend from<br />
discussions with the Americans in Hawaii and he tells is that he was extraordinarily<br />
well received up there as well. So while the relationship between New Zealand and the<br />
United States on defence issues changed under David Lange's Government of some<br />
years ago, I think it is proper and fair to observe that we have been successfuil in reestablishing<br />
much better relationships with the United States on defence and security<br />
matters now than we had in the past as evidence, as 1 say, by the very recent visit of<br />
the Minister of Defence to discuss issues with the United States.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
Are you concerned about the Australian criticism of New Zealand stance ( inaudible) of<br />
East Timor as irreversible, were you surprised by Foreign Affairs cable suggesting that<br />
position resulted by New Zealand created a foreign policy... for Australia did you<br />
discuss the issue with Mr Howard at all? </p>
<p>BOLGER: John Howard and I have discussed the issue of Indonesia and East Timor, and again<br />
there is broadly comparable policies between the two countries, but I think there is the<br />
distinct that has been there for a long time. In terms of the word irreversible that<br />
seems to have excited people that was a decision taken the Minister of Foreign Affairs<br />
in New Zealand on the advice of our Foreign Ministry, that given we are talking about<br />
the internal arrangements of another country, including those arrangements were<br />
somewhat controversial in that country, was wrong for us, that was the advice given to<br />
my Foreign Minister, wrong for us to presume what was or was not irreversible in that<br />
country but in terms of the approach that New Zealand has adopted, it has not<br />
changed, and that's really where it is at, and I don't know whether it created a<br />
headache for the Australian Foreign Ministry or not, John, I don't know.<br />
HOWARD: Well, I haven't reached for the Panadol!<br />
BOLGER:<br />
No, so I don't know about that, but that was the logic behind the decision to drop that<br />
which was considered to be presumptuous as to what may or may not occur in<br />
Indonesia. JOURNALIST: Dennis Grant from the Seven Network. Prime Minister Howard's government has the<br />
proposal to extend the waiting time for social security benefits for New Zealanders<br />
living in Australia from the present six months to two years. What's your view on that<br />
and to what extent could you reverse his thinking?<br />
BOLGER: Well the relationship on benefit entitlements Australians and New Zealanders and<br />
New Zealanders and Australians it is conducted under agreed protocols and<br />
agreements that were brought together and we've noted the decision of the Australian<br />
Government. We've discussed it with Prime Minister Howard this morning to extend<br />
the waiting time for some defined benefits predominantly I think the unemployment<br />
benefit some defined, but I think that is the dominant one, for two years. What we<br />
will do now, is the New Zealand side of the agreement, bilateral agreement we have<br />
with Australia is to sit down and talk to the Australians as to the implications that has<br />
for the bilateral understanding. Clearly it is a significant shift by Australia, it also, if<br />
New Zealand follows that shift, we will have to look at the relationship in terms of our<br />
benefit entitlement relationships and regimes from other countries that have people<br />
come over to New Zealand. So we will now calmly work our way forward, that's<br />
been agreed to. The officials and the relevant Ministers will work their way forward<br />
from that.<br />
JOURNALIST: </p>
<p>Prime Minister Howard, are you sticking to that rigid formula or were you persuaded<br />
by Mr Bolger's arguments in the reverse and..<br />
BOLGER: I'll just pause you there Dennis. We didn't seek to persuade the Australian<br />
government in the reverse. We didn't say Australia you've got this all wrong, please<br />
listen to us. We noted the Australian Government's position, noted that that has<br />
implications for the bilateral arrangements that we have between the two countries and<br />
we will take it forward from there.<br />
HOWARD: Our position is that the law has been changed in Australia and the policy decision was<br />
taken by the Coalition before the last election. In fact this was one of our<br />
commitments in the document ' Meeting our Commitments' and the policy must, as I<br />
explained, be applied in a non-discriminatory fashion however there are extant<br />
recripocal social service agreements with a number of countries including New Zealand<br />
and naturally Australia will honour the terms of existing social service agreements<br />
which require the giving of notice and discussions and negotiations and so forth, but<br />
the policy which has been adopted by us has to be applied for reasons I think people<br />
will understand in a non-discriminatory fashion but we are not going to do other than<br />
honour the processes laid down in agreements. We'll honour those fully and I'm quite<br />
certain the thing can be worked through in an intelligent fashion.<br />
JOURNALIST: Craig McMurtrie from the ABC. How was your meeting with Winston Peters and<br />
what did you talk about?<br />
HOWARD: Well, very good. I was very interested to meet the new deputy Prime Minister of New<br />
Zealand. What did we talk about? We talked about overwhelmingly economic issues.<br />
I was interested to learn that New Zealand is quite active in considering the<br />
introduction of work-for-the-dole schemes and we agreed that our officials and New<br />
Zealand officials should be in touch. I talked about the size of the New Zealand<br />
surplus. We talked a little bit about immigration policy and the different experiences of<br />
the two countries on that, and very briefly about the experience of Coalition. His<br />
experience has been briefer than mine and the history of the two is different, but can I<br />
say I found a very enthusiastic committed Deputy Prime Minister who spoke very<br />
warmly of what had been achieved in the time the Coalition Government had been in<br />
place here in New Zealand and I certainly if I may say so, I sensed an optimistic<br />
positive ' it's a different era but it's a new era' atmosphere in the relationship in the<br />
Cabinet room which of course included Ministers from both National and New Zealand<br />
First and certainly I found my meeting with Mr Peters interesting. I'd not met him<br />
before, I'd read a lot about him and he's a great personality in New Zealand politics. I<br />
think they will be a formidable combination. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Were you impressed by the depth of Mr Peters' knowledge of economics?<br />
HOWARD: I thought he was totally.., very very informed and very sensitive to the balance of<br />
economic and social policy which any successful Treasurer must be.<br />
JOURNALIST: Did you discuss at all access for New Zealand programme makers to the Australian<br />
market vis a vis the quota, and the shipping of nuclear waste through common waters,<br />
through the Tasman Sea?<br />
BOLGER: On the issue of New Zealand programmes being able to be shown on Australian TV it<br />
is my firm and committed view that Australians should see those programmes, it has<br />
been my view for some time and I've re-expressed it to John Howard.<br />
HOWARD: He has!<br />
BOLGER: And I see no reason why when we have to watch it dare I say John some of your<br />
programmes that you shouldn't watch some of ours. The matter on a more official<br />
basis is of course going through the court process in Australia. The New Zealand<br />
proponent ' Blue Sky' have had some success in the courts, they've had some lack of<br />
success in the courts and it is back before the courts. But I hope it can be resolved. I<br />
think there is benefit personally on here, and on a facetious basis there is benefit in the<br />
opportunities that that would provide both ways. On the question of the shipment of<br />
nuclear waste, not we haven't discussed that. It would be I think both countries<br />
expectation but given that there is an opportunity for that ship to go up outside the<br />
exclusive zones of both countries that barring some compelling reason for it do<br />
otherwise, that's what it will do.<br />
JOURNALIST: Have you made any progress on the Trans Tasman Aviation Agreements, is there<br />
anything to report from this meeting? </p>
<p>BOLGER: This morning at the Cabinet table and I'll invite John to make comment in a moment<br />
at the Cabinet table we discussed this, because Transport Minister Jenny Shipley has<br />
just been over talking to her Australian counterpart John Sharp on the whole question<br />
of a further extension of ' beyond' rights to Air New Zealand, the basic message Mrs<br />
Shipley took to Australia was that there were benefits to both countries from that<br />
extension of ' beyond' rights in terms of opening up a wider range of route<br />
configurations for visitors to both our countries, not just to New Zealand, but to New<br />
Zealand and Australia and for trade opportunities in both directions as well. And the<br />
argument based on the common sense approach that to make progress here both<br />
countries have to benefit, and Mrs Shipley put material in front of Mr Sharp to suggest<br />
that both countries would benefit from some additional on rights being made available<br />
to Air New Zealand.<br />
HOWARD: Could I just say on that subject that I agree completely with what Jim has said about<br />
the discussion between Mrs Shipley and Mr Sharp. They are to meet again before the<br />
Australasian Transport Ministers' meeting in Cairns in May and the material that Mrs<br />
Shipley presented is to be displayed before the Australian carriers. The ' beyond' rights<br />
issue is very important in New Zealand. I've understood that from the beginning.<br />
Equally it is fair to say that it is always been seen by us as having a degree of difficulty<br />
which is greater than the original negotiations involving the single aviation market. It's<br />
something that has to be worked through and we are trying to do that in an intelligent<br />
way and in a way that benefits.., respects the interests of both countries and the<br />
carriers concerned but we are certainly happy that the discussion is going on and it will<br />
be interesting to see what arises out of the meeting in May.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you have a time frame for when you may be able to make a decision one way or<br />
another on that issue?<br />
HOWARD: Is that directed to me? No, I don't.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Bolger?<br />
BOLGER:<br />
Well, what we agreed as John Howard said a moment ago is that officials will continue<br />
their work over the next many weeks and that the two Ministers are scheduled to meet<br />
again some time in May.<br />
JOURNALIST: </p>
<p>At lunch today you are both proposing a toast to the Queen. I just wonder at this<br />
stage in our respective countries' history whether you feel it might be more meaningful<br />
in toasting each other rather than the Queen?<br />
HOWARD: That would offend all the Labor voters.<br />
BOLGER: I don't think John I actually want to toast to ourselves but I think you were probably<br />
saying should both countries pick up a suggestion I believe Prime Minister Howard has<br />
made in recent days that in fact the toast should be to Australia rather then to the Head<br />
of State, well, that's something we haven't addressed in New Zealand yet I have to<br />
say. Interesting concept.<br />
JOURNALIST: Ben Fordham from 2UE. I just wanted to ask apart from making your warm<br />
relationship warmer with Mr Bolger and the New Zealand Government, what's been<br />
the greatest achievement of this trip? Is there anything out of your meetings which you<br />
can say has been a great achievement?<br />
HOWARD: Well, reinforcing and keeping in good repair a fundamentally close and intimate<br />
relationship is always an important thing to do and you should never take close<br />
relationships for granted. It's dangerous, both at a diplomatic level and at a personal<br />
level. So you should never do that. I've learnt a lot more about the goals and<br />
priorities and aims of the new Coalition Government in New Zealand. It is an<br />
interesting path down which New Zealand has decided to go in relation to MIIMP and<br />
the new Coalition arrangement the change to a mixed system and as a student of<br />
political science as well as a fraternal political colleague in a philosophical sense it is<br />
interesting for me to see it more first hand in operation. And New Zealand's done<br />
some very significant things in the area of economic reform over the last ten years, and<br />
the opportunity at a Prime Ministerial level to talk about these things is very important.<br />
BOLGER: Could I just add thirty seconds to that, because I would endorse the remark that it is<br />
important that friends and close colleagues and countries that are close both in history<br />
and at the present time don't ignore each other. I think most New Zealanders would<br />
understand that Australia is New Zealand's largest export market, perhaps not all<br />
Australians understand that New Zealand is Australia's third largest export market. So<br />
there is straight commercial grounds, leaving sentiment to one side, there is very strong<br />
and compelling arguments why we should make certain that we have our thinking clear<br />
on all issues that might affect Trans Tasman relationship. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Is it your view that Australia is running the risk of becoming increasingly<br />
diplomatically isolated over its opposition to legally binding greenhouse gas<br />
emission targets and have you discussed that issue at all with Mr Howard on recent<br />
days? BOLGER: A very short discussion I've got to say because we were running out of time in<br />
Cabinet, with my Minister for the Environment Simon Upton, but nobody suggested to<br />
me that Australia is going to be isolated out there somewhere, that certainly didn't<br />
come up. We didn't have time to develop the respective approaches of the two<br />
countries in any detail. We acknowledge that the issue was mobile in terms of the<br />
positions that were being adopted internationally. I think if you followed us through<br />
from the Rio conference when there was a very high level of participation and<br />
optimism, what I would describe it as now is down to a more realistic assessment of<br />
what the world can achieve in terms of greenhouse gases and how they might be<br />
achieved and we are talking about tradeable rights, putting that into the international<br />
debate, whether that is something that should be given considerable weight to. The<br />
Americans have developed a different concept and so on. So my interpretation of that<br />
is not that anybody is isolated in one corner. I think the world is seeking the best way<br />
forward without imposing very substantial and perhaps unenforceable costs on certain<br />
economies if we just take a very simplistic approach to this. It is a complex issue and I<br />
think that's now better understood by some of the protagonists out in the world<br />
community, than perhaps it was in the enthusiasm of the Rio conference.<br />
HOWARD: Could I just add to that that I don't see Australia as being isolated or in danger of<br />
being isolated. I do however see the position of the Australian government as one that<br />
promotes the Australian national interest. Australia is a net exporter of energy, a very<br />
big net exporter of energy and we are naturally seeking an understanding, we're<br />
seeking I think the diplomatic expression is ' differentiation' we are seeking an<br />
acceptance by countries that are not net-exporters of energy of our position and I think<br />
if you look given our status as a net-exporter of energy, you look at what Australia has<br />
achieved in terms of voluntary greenhouse targets over the past few years, we've done<br />
pretty well, but we did, as Jim said, we discussed it briefly and I think Robert Hill and<br />
Simon are going to have a discussion about it and certainly we want to keep working<br />
closely with New Zealand on the subject.<br />
Thank you. </p>
