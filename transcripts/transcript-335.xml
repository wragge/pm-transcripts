SPEECH BY THE PRIM MINISTER9 THE RT. HON. R. G.<br />
I4ENZIES9 TO STUDENTS OF TOW'NSVILLE UNIVERSITY<br />
COLLEGE$ ON 20TH J NE 1961<br />
Mr, Warden, and ladies and gentlemen:<br />
I would like to relieve your mind at once this is not to<br />
be a long, heavy, political speech; nor do I propose to make a<br />
speech to you of any comprehensive kind about universities and what<br />
they do. All I do -want to say to you is that after the last war one<br />
of the remarkable things that occurred in Australia was that there was<br />
a tremendously increased demand for university training. The number<br />
of students qualified for and desiring university training grew<br />
phenomenally. It became quite clear that the task of providing for<br />
them, the task of keeping the universities going and growing, was<br />
going to be beyond the capacity of the Governments of the States and<br />
could not be brought within their capacity by extraordinary increases<br />
in fees because that would have the effect of depriving people, too<br />
many people, of the opportunity of study,<br />
So I went on a sort of frolic of my own. I got hold of Sir<br />
Keith Murray when I was in England, the Chairman of the Universities<br />
Grants Commission, and I asked him whether he would become the<br />
Chairman of a Committee to Investigate the universities position in<br />
Australia. Hie said that he would provided that his Chancellor of the<br />
Exchequer for whom he worked was agreeable. The Chancellor was Mr,<br />
Hai-old Macmillan, an old friend of mine, and I was able to cope with<br />
him. And so we got Sir Keith Murray.<br />
4e got together a very, very fine committee, partly people<br />
from overseas, partly very eminent men in Australia. And the result<br />
of their report, I believe, was phenomenal. It was regarded as quite<br />
shocking I know, by people in the Treasury because it presented us<br />
with a 13111 which we speedily accepted I did a little more<br />
dragooning on my own account and which increased the Commonwealth' s<br />
outlay on universities from a figure that it had stood at of about a<br />
little over œ CLm. a year to a total of œ 21m. in three years what we<br />
call the first triennium. This was accepted by the Govrxe nt. It<br />
imposed not only great obligations on the Commonwealth, but it<br />
imposed even greater ones on the States. One must always remember<br />
that the development of the university structure in Australia<br />
represents a remarkable piece of co-operation between the Commonwealth<br />
Goveirnment and the State Governments, each of which has accepted large<br />
burdens, financially, in relation to the matter.<br />
Then we adopted another recommendation of the Murray Committee<br />
and we appointed a Universities Commission which is presided over by<br />
Sir Leslie Martin, the eminent scientist. Not to be outdone by Sir<br />
Keith Murray and his myrmidons, they brought in a B3ill, the other day,<br />
which increased the œ 21in. over the first three years to over<br />
the second three years. I haven't yet begun to think of u~ hat the<br />
third triennium may bring forth. But it remains true that in<br />
Australia among us all, we are spending now sums of money on<br />
university development which would have been regarded as simply<br />
fabulous and absurd., before the war. This I believe is a Lreat thing.<br />
And one of the things that has happened is what is happening<br />
here. You can't Just create a new University, so to speak, fully<br />
fledged, because it is a very expensive operation. I would hate to<br />
tell you what it would cost to establish, in the full sense, a full<br />
univorsity, with all the equipment that goes with it. It runs into<br />
many millions of pounds.<br />
But in various places in Australia the first stCep has been<br />
taken some of them were taken before the war; some of them taken<br />
after it the first steps have been taken by creating a university<br />
college and attaching it to one of the established universities, In<br />
Canberra., for example we have had for many, many, years a Canbe rra<br />
University College which was attached to the University of Melbourne </p>
<p>and the degrees that were ,, ranted, though they were earned in<br />
Canberra in the University College, wore &amp; ranted in the University of<br />
Melbourne. Recently I brought about a marriage between the National<br />
University, essentially, at that time, a post-graduate research<br />
institute, and the University College. So that they are now all part<br />
of the Australian National University and a student may start in<br />
First Year, go through to post-graduate work, to hiigher degree, and if<br />
lie is of the right kind, and has the right feeling for it, move into<br />
higher realms of research work.<br />
The University College which was established at Armidale a<br />
good number of years ago has now become a fall University.<br />
I look forward Wiself to the idea that this so prom~ isingly<br />
beun ' University College will, somne day don't be in too much of a<br />
hurry; these things take a good deal of doing will some day<br />
develop into a University for the northern part of Australia. But that<br />
is on the knees of tile gods or rather, to be more precise, if less<br />
theological, on the knees of' the University Commission which itself<br />
will advise us on these matters from time to time,<br />
But I mention these matters merely to indicate and I am<br />
talking particularly to the students that you have the jroat<br />
priviloc; e really of being the firsL students in a place wihich will,<br />
in duo course, whether here or in expanded form across the riger, or<br />
whatever may come,, develop into a matter of immense import-ance to the<br />
north o f Australia, and thorefore to Australia as a whole. This I<br />
think, is a great privilege. I permit myself to envy you a lithle<br />
because you are at the beginning of your studies; and I occasionally<br />
feel that I must be getting perilously near the end of mine,<br />
I was very pleased to notice, among other things, warden, that<br />
you have already, wisely, if I may say so, aimed at developing even<br />
though in a small way at this point of time, all tile aspects of student<br />
life, A University Collerge which has an ambition some day, to be a<br />
full University, must be able to cater, in my opinion not merely for<br />
the work done at a desk but for the whole life of a iniversity: the<br />
life on the playing field, the life in a social way, the life of the<br />
common room; in due course, I trust, the life of residential colleges.<br />
All these things build up into something that distinguishes a<br />
University from any other institute of learning because it oncourages<br />
freedom, it encourages the ability to meet people? to get to understand<br />
people, which is after all, one of the great problems of life and &amp; no<br />
of the problems that requires a great deal of work, and a great deal of<br />
experience. When I came in I saw an eminently respectable young man who<br />
turned out to be the President of the Union, thle Students' PI-esiddnt.<br />
I uant to confess to you this may discourage you a lot I used to<br />
be that myself. That, perhaps, was the beginning of the end with me.<br />
It marked the beginning of my downfall which ultimately took me into<br />
political affairs.<br />
But it is a fine thing for students in a University to feel<br />
that they have not only an individual existence but a corporate<br />
existence, that they are part of a body and that as the University<br />
College goes on, as the University goes on, more and more they are<br />
part of a continuing body each of the years, each of the drafts of<br />
new students learning something from those who have gone before them<br />
and translating into terms of the future their own inafluence, and<br />
their own work and their own knowledge. It is a wonderful thing to<br />
belong to a continuing body. I want you to have that firmly in your<br />
mind. If you just came along here and were told " Well, you are<br />
going to do a year's work, and then disappear and the whole t11iad<br />
over", that would be a rather depressing thought, wouldn't it? But to </p>
<p>be members of something that will : o on and on and on if' we are left<br />
alone, for a century, for twocenturies, that will ultimately build up<br />
its own immense tradition, its own marvellous moral and spiritual and<br />
intellectual compulsions on the mind, this is a great thing. So<br />
that people some day will be able to say, " Oh, yos, I know so-and-so,<br />
he's a Townsville man", jus' as they might say, " He's an Oxford man",<br />
" He's a Cambridge man". Getting something and giving something all<br />
the 1ime. I could talk to you for a long time about this; it is a<br />
ma ter very close to my hort. I sometimes pormit rayself the unworthy<br />
hope that when I have departed from politics, voluntarily or<br />
involuntarily, when I have departed from public lifo and somebody sits<br />
do wa, as somebodyill, perhaps rather unpleasantly to say, " ell what<br />
did lie do, anyhow, what did it all amount to?" I hope No. 1 in my<br />
credit list, which will be a short one I hope the deficit will be on<br />
the next page so that you have to turn over to reach it will be,<br />
" Well he understood the need for Universities in this land; he understood<br />
something of the need for the highest intellectual and<br />
scientific training that can be given in this country".<br />
Ours is a new country crying out for first-class -eople; and<br />
first class people, trained people, are always, as the economists say,<br />
" in short supply". It is very true; it is very true that rhen I<br />
survey the whole of the university structure in Australia and discuss<br />
it ith the Universities Commission tre are naturally influenced in our<br />
minds made a little fearful, when we contemplate the enormoue'inancial<br />
demands that will arise. But much more important than the financial<br />
demands will be the demands for first-class people. You can't have a<br />
first-class University with second-class University teachers. We must<br />
maintain the standard of the Professor, the standard of the lecturer,<br />
the standard of the demonstrator, if we are going to be satisfied that<br />
we are going to produce graduates whose degrees will be honourably<br />
recognised around the world* and who, themselves, vill be able to make<br />
a powerful contribution to their own country, or, indeed, to other<br />
countries outside Australia.<br />
That, Sir, is one of the _ reat problems that we have in the<br />
future: the problem of keeping up the supply. -Je can't hope to get toc<br />
many teachers from overseas because they, themselves, have a growing<br />
demand no less than ours. There are new countries around thd world<br />
which are bound to help if we can and they certainly w-on't be able<br />
to help us much in the field of teaching and of scholarship. So we<br />
have the responsibility of doing it ourselves to the utmost of our<br />
capacity, to concentrate our minds on it, to seek to achieve the<br />
ultimate in excellence because if we do we will be able to furnish the<br />
universities of the future, and the university students of the future,<br />
with the high level of teaching that they require. It is because I<br />
have been able to do a little about this matter that I not onl]. wish<br />
you well and envy you this opportunity, but would like to have that<br />
little credit entry in the book of my life that I did something about it.<br />
But chiefly, thismorning looking at you, I hope you will allow<br />
me to say that I do envy you a little<br />
" Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive;<br />
Buat to be young, ttwas very heaven."<br />
That is the way to look at this thing and you will create a new heaven<br />
on earth. ( Applause) </p>
