FOR PRESS 655.<br />
Extract from opening address to the annual<br />
conference of the Australian Country Party June<br />
23, at Wagga by the Rt. Hon. J. McEwen, Acting Prime<br />
Minister, Minister for Trade and Industry, Leader of the<br />
Australian Country Party<br />
VIETNAM There 13 controversy as to whether Australian<br />
troops should be in South Vietnam.<br />
This is a free, independent country recognised<br />
by the United Nations.<br />
Australia had hoped that the United Nations<br />
would be an organis'tion cxpable and willing to protect free<br />
countries at least small free countries.<br />
We will work towards the United Nations becoming<br />
such an Authority, but at this stage we have to face the fact<br />
that it has no such power or will at present.<br />
Today the United Nations is unable, and many<br />
of its member States unwilling, to protect South Vietnam from<br />
falling victim to the Communists of North Vietnam and<br />
Communist China. The United States is not engaged in South<br />
Vietnam to protect American soil or American interests.<br />
She is there to defend the freedom of a small<br />
nation freedom from domina. tion by Communism.<br />
For Australia, far more so than for the United<br />
States, this is not just a conflict of ideologies.<br />
Vietnam is the only fighting front in the<br />
world today where the forces of freedom are actually fighting<br />
the Communists. Every Australi. n must note that this, the only<br />
fighting front, is dangerously close to our front door.<br />
Some assert that this is a war wvich can't be won.<br />
The argument goes that even if the United States<br />
wants to persevere in this struggle, Australia should not<br />
become militarily involved.<br />
To me, this line of argument ignores the plain,<br />
hard facts of our defence situation.<br />
There are too many episodes of recent history,<br />
to justify any confidence that any country with a small<br />
population can safely work on the principle that if we mind<br />
our own business, the rest of the world v; ill let us dwell in<br />
peace. Incident after incident shows this to be<br />
a completely unreal and dangerous approach to our defence<br />
, nd security. </p>
<p>Nor can a country with our limited population<br />
and present resources, geogro
realisticilly think that vie can, by our own enceavours, take<br />
care of all contingencies which might arise, invrlving our<br />
security. In a1n age when v. a. ons and military equipment<br />
require great resources, and higLhly-developed technology,<br />
only the greatest of industrial powers, can alo 1e really<br />
indeprenlent military powcre in their own right.<br />
Unable to depend on the United Nations, what<br />
is the courseof safety to us?<br />
There is only one. The crea. tion and maintenance<br />
of alliances wiith po erful and reliable friendos.<br />
This must be the simile basis of our ap. roach<br />
to defence. We have forimed alliances.<br />
f course, v. with Britain, and New Zealand, with<br />
whom we have a long and, proud history of standing together<br />
in military affairs, for better or for worse.<br />
And also w-ith t1e createst military and industrial<br />
power there is the United States.<br />
The United States, under ANZUS, is pledged to<br />
defend us to safeguard our security.<br />
But like any alliance, ours with the United<br />
States must also be a two-ay alliance, for bettcr rr for worse.<br />
You can't make alliances, you certainly can't<br />
keep them, if you are going to take the view that:<br />
" We want to be looked after in any event, but<br />
wve'll pick aznd chloose when we'll support our<br />
partner. Te won't esupport him unless we are<br />
sure he's . ign to win.<br />
This is the answer to those who say we should<br />
not be in Vietnam because they think that in the circumstances<br />
the United States can't win a clear-cu. t victory in that<br />
troubled country. To merit thle NiJ re ty commitment of the<br />
United States, vital to Australia not -uet for today or<br />
tomorrow, but for years, pCerhapr generations in the future,<br />
, ustralia must support our great and powverful ally in the task<br />
she has assumed, of prcvcntinc further encroachment by the<br />
ommunists in South :' ast Asia.<br />
This is a stru-gle which could affect the<br />
safety, even the survival, of our own country.<br />
If Vietnam fall, . hat are the prospects for<br />
peace, and for freedom, in Le in Thailand in alayysia?<br />
What are the prospeats for utrl1ia 11 million<br />
eople holding an i-mmense countr, with tremendous resources<br />
nly now beginning to be e-ploitel, </p>
<p>A country in Australia's position cannot<br />
afford the luxury of doing only uwhat is comfortable? doing<br />
only that which does not involvo rieks.<br />
Our conduct today must ansure we merit the<br />
unhesitating support of our a. llies wen their support is<br />
needed. Of course, we detest r: ar, but notso much as<br />
we detest the thought of lms of our froedom to Communism.<br />
Of course, we w: o ul---! ork with the British and<br />
Americans to restore peace.<br />
But I mean peace which preserves the freedom<br />
of South Vietnam not a Deace which le-.~ s to Communist<br />
victory by Treaty. As I said before, Vietnam is the only fighting<br />
front in the world today " here the forces of freedom are<br />
actually fighting the ComiLiunists.<br />
Every Australian must note that this, the only<br />
fighting front, is dangerously close to our front door.<br />
Australia hel-ped the British, New, Zealanders<br />
and . Malayans to stamp out the Communist terrorists in Malaya.<br />
Today they are finished there.<br />
We put them out by fighting them not by<br />
signing a treaty with them.<br />
Co .: mun-ism is here in Australia. I believe that<br />
never before have Australians had such real ~ round to<br />
recognise the da4nger to our freedom from Communisrm.<br />
The Country Party w, as the first, and for a<br />
time, the ONLY political Party in Australia declaring that<br />
ommunism should be banned.<br />
Let us again lead the fight against this<br />
pernicious menace,<br />
7, V A year ago Australia held reserves in foreign<br />
exchange of Å 854 million next week at the end of this<br />
Einancial year our reserves jwill have fillen to Å 680 million.<br />
Having re~.: rd to all of the factors which<br />
nfluence Australia's balance of payments, it would not be<br />
n unreasonabl-guesstiimate that in a year's time our<br />
eserves may have fallen by as much ag. in.<br />
' Phis estimate pays some regoard, but not an<br />
unduly pessimistic regard, to the U. S. A. U. K. policies of<br />
minimising capital outflow.<br />
So one of Australia's greatest needs xIill<br />
ontinue to be, to increase export earnings to pay for the<br />
mports of capital equipment : and raw mnterials, which provides<br />
he , iuscles and sinews for the industry 3so essential for our<br />
rowth. </p>
<p>-4<br />
This year Australia will buy no less than Å 1,400<br />
illion worth of imports, Å 500 million more than 5 years ago<br />
hen imports were controlled at somewhere about Å 900 million a<br />
ear. There is nothing wrong with dipping into reserves<br />
to pay for these imports. That is what reserves are for.<br />
But neither a business nor a country can go on<br />
iving on its savings.<br />
If Australia is to maintain continuously a high<br />
evel of imports, then more anid more foreign exchange, must<br />
e earned by our exports, by exporting more, by exporting<br />
ifferent products, by getting better prices for our exports.<br />
If prices had remained at the levels of 1963-64 on<br />
hese 3 commodities alone, Australia would have earned an<br />
additional Å 135 million export income in the financial year<br />
nor closing. If prices of ALL export commodities had returned<br />
to the more reasonable levels of 1952-53, Australia's export<br />
i come would have been Å 300 million higher this financial<br />
y ar. There must be fought a constant battle to improve<br />
A stralia's earnings from exports. More in quantity! better<br />
p ices. Australia has now entered a new phase of export<br />
o gigantic quantities of crude minerals iron ore, coal, and<br />
b uxit e. It is a. matter of great interest that, to date,<br />
t ese sales and prospects of sale are almost in their entirety<br />
td Japan. The historic Australia-Japan Trade Treaty of 1957<br />
h -4s transformed the trading relationship between Australia and<br />
J pan and, perhaps more important, transformed relationships<br />
b tween the governments and the people of our two countries<br />
alel counts this is good beyond c ofculation.<br />
However, I have said on earlier occasions that<br />
A1 stralia is not to be exploited only as a quarry. It is time<br />
nn for us to see a growing development of the sale of these<br />
ra materials after somie processing.<br />
WAH A T Australia knows that historically wheat has been<br />
pr duced in surplus to the co. mnercial market.<br />
In recent years most of this surplus has been taken<br />
of the commercial market and disposed of on concessional<br />
te ms to the needy countries.<br />
Part of the Australian proposal now is to deal with<br />
wh at, surplus to commercial demand.<br />
We concede that the country which produces wheat<br />
su'plus to its commercial opportunities ought to be prepared<br />
to sell some of that wheat at less than the commercial price<br />
to the needy ought not to be the responsibility only of those<br />
couhtries which produce wheat in export quantities. </p>
<p>That, in short, all the more affluent countries<br />
whether wheat exporters or wheat importers should make a<br />
money contribution to a fund which would be used to buy surplus<br />
wheat at less than the going commercial price, and provide it<br />
on concessional -terms to the needy.<br />
That, in broad terms, is the Australijn approach.<br />
DROUGHT It is proper that governments should concern<br />
themselves with the problems of drought. The industries<br />
affected by drought are essential to the national well-being,<br />
and much that could be done to alleviate the consequences of<br />
drought can be done only by governments.<br />
In the livestock industries, drought is primarily<br />
i problem of feed and water, but in practical terms transport<br />
acilities and transport costs become a major part of the<br />
roblem. I am hopeful that the present drought may bring all<br />
Australian Governments collectively to face the fact that<br />
irought is a recurring phenomenon of the Australian environment.<br />
Not only does great personal hardship occur with tremendous<br />
uffering to livestock, but the whole economy of a country sunh<br />
as Australia is set back when a major drought occurs.<br />
Clearly there is opportunity for more water<br />
conservation by governments and, in very many cases, need for<br />
more water conservation by the landowner.<br />
It is quite practicable to-day to hold reserve<br />
tocks of grain for feed without the risks that applied in<br />
arlier times, of destruction by pests.<br />
I believe there should be special consideration of<br />
redit policies to enable farmers to hlve better reserves of<br />
ater and of fodder.<br />
In drought transport needs to be adequate and<br />
inexpensive. It is not easy to mitigate the consequences of<br />
drought for the grain grower, but the certainty that he will<br />
have recurring experiences of loss of production through<br />
drought and indeed, recurring experiences of failure to be<br />
able to plant his crop in many districts through excess rain<br />
must be sufficiently taken into account in assessing his costs<br />
for the purpose of stabilisation schemes.<br />
Over the whole field of drought consideration, the<br />
assistance of the scientist and the extension worker must be<br />
fally invoked. Most important work in relation to the drought<br />
f eding of sheep has been done, but I very much doubt whether<br />
tae result of this work has penetrated all sheepowners'<br />
uaderstanding. In a comprehensively organised approach to mitigation<br />
oC drought consequences, I believe the Commonwealth Government<br />
w uld co-operate with State Governments.<br />
This whole subject of drought is one on which the<br />
c) untry voice must be heard. 4 5/ 6 </p>
