lj&gt; A U S L IA<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 20 AUGUST 1978<br />
ELECTORATE TALK<br />
The Government's Budget is the right Budget for Australiathe<br />
only Budget for Australia. The Budget had one major<br />
objective to build on the foundations already set for<br />
the long term economic stability and prosperity of Australia.<br />
We met that objective without quibble, without pretence.<br />
That Budget has been exceptionally well-received by<br />
Australians. I have spoken to many Australians over the last<br />
few days and almost without exception they said we had<br />
produced a good Budget.<br />
Of course there are moans about cigarette prices, and beer<br />
prices and petrol prices but people understand why we had<br />
to take these decisions. They understand that there is<br />
no easy way out of economic problems. There are still no<br />
quick fixes.<br />
The people I spoke with farmers, factory workers, Australians<br />
from all walks of life all recognised that we had to keep<br />
on with the firm policies and with our policy of restraint.<br />
Even though this Budget had some so-called " unpopular" news,<br />
people have received it far better, I believe, than our<br />
previous two Budgets. That says a great deal about the<br />
intelligence, commonsense and fair-mindedness of Australians.<br />
I don't believe the kind of newspaper headlines we saw after<br />
the Budget reflect in any way the real feeling and real<br />
spirit in Australia.<br />
One of the reasons the Budget has been accepted is that<br />
Australians can see that inflation is being beaten a 5 percent<br />
inflation rate within ten months is a reality.<br />
Australians remember all too vividly that when we took office<br />
inflation was in excess of 15 or 16 percent. That was hitting<br />
hard and direct at the needy, the poor, the disadvantaged, the<br />
pensioner, the farmer, the family and business.<br />
Our policies have slashed inflation and have created conditions<br />
where interest rates can continue to fall. As interest rates<br />
keep coming down in a steady and in a sustainable way<br />
that gets to the heart of Australian life. / 2 </p>

The level of interest rates affects every Australian,<br />
every buying decision. Lower interest rates really benefit<br />
young couples buying a home or improving an existing home;<br />
it helps farmers who rely so heavily on borrowed money to<br />
finance expensive equipment; it helps someone buying a new<br />
car or borrowing money from a bank or a building society<br />
for any reason at all; and it helps business, large and small.<br />
Reducing inflation and reducing interest rates will do more<br />
to help every Australian than any other act of Government.<br />
In fact the real stimulus to the Australian economy will come<br />
from lower inflation and lower interest rates and not from<br />
some Government induced spending programme that pumps money<br />
out of ever-turning printing presses.<br />
of course lower inflation and lower interest rates wgill make<br />
our great industries more competitive in Australia and in<br />
world markets. You all know what this will mean for jobs,<br />
for confidence and for growth.<br />
Significantly, of course, it means that as a resource-rich<br />
nation we will become a favoured nation for investment.<br />
Countries will be looking to Australia with our lower inflation<br />
and with a sound and stable economy for years ahead.<br />
Australia now has a high reputation in the great finance<br />
markets of the world. Countries know we are pursuing the right<br />
policies, they know we mean business.<br />
Countries look also to Australia not only as a nation with a<br />
sound economy but as a country with continuing policitical<br />
stability. Investors still remember the damage caused to Australia to<br />
Australian industry and jobs--by the political instability of<br />
the three Labor years.<br />
They now look to Australia with sound, responsible and sensible<br />
economic policies and to an Australia with stable, united and<br />
determined Government. We will not fail on either account.<br />
