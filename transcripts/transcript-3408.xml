PRIME MINISTER'S SPEECH, SOUTH PACIFIC CONFERENCE, RAROTONGA,<br />
26 SEPTEMBER 1974<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen: thank<br />
you very much indeed for allowing me to say a few words to<br />
you at your conference. This is my first visit to the Cook<br />
Islands and I am making this visit because of the hospitality,<br />
the very good personal relations which Sir Albert Henry has<br />
been able to establish with so many people over the years at<br />
various conferences. I have attended, as a member, the South<br />
Pacific Forum. I did so shortly after becoming Prime Minister<br />
in April last year. The conference was held in western Samoa,<br />
and the conference was held a few months earlier than had<br />
originally been arranged because there had been brand new governments<br />
in New Zealand as well as in Australia in December 1972. On that<br />
occasion, as a full member of a South Pacific body, I was able<br />
to learn more closely than ever before many of the things which<br />
concerned us jointly as well as individually. The South Pacific<br />
Commission is the first of these bodies to be created it was<br />
created under the Canberra Agreement named after Australia's<br />
capital in 1947. It seems now very much an. archaic and fraternal<br />
body. It was composed entirely of metropolitan powers. It became<br />
clear for many years past that that was not enough to satisfy<br />
the aspirations of the people of the South Pacific and thereupon<br />
theSouth Pacific Conference emerged. It * was composed of all the<br />
territories in the South Seas. Those who were independent, those<br />
that were associated with metropolitan powers, but they were all<br />
represented there. And eventually the South Pacific Conference<br />
came to discuss matters of great substance, matters which concerned<br />
all the people whatever their language, whatever their political<br />
arrangements and now the position of the Commission and the<br />
Conference has been very largely transposed. Now, I am happy<br />
that last year my country was very anxious that the conference<br />
should become even more significant and the Commission should<br />
become a Commission of the Commonwealth. As I understand it my<br />
country is not entitled to be a member of the conference except<br />
in so far as it has responsibilities for Norfolk Island and still<br />
for Papua New Guinea. By the time of the next South Pacific<br />
Conference I would expect that Papua New Guinea, in international<br />
terms, will be an independent country as, from Australia's point<br />
of view, we are already happy to regard. But as head of government<br />
in my country I am able to attend meetings of the South Pacific<br />
Forum and I find it a very interesting and significant body.<br />
At the conference, over the next few days, my Government<br />
will be represented by Mr. Bill Morrison who was a member of the<br />
Australian diplomatic service for about 20 years before he became<br />
a minister in my government. As a member of the diplomatic service<br />
he has served in Singapore and Malaysia and had responsibilities<br />
on behalf of Australia in many programs thatAustralia was engaged<br />
in in some parts of Malaysia. He therefore comes to this conference<br />
with twenty years or more experience of international arrangements<br />
and particularly in developing countries; countries developing<br />
not only economically but politically. When I formed my government<br />
I made him the last minister in charge of External Territories,<br />
in effect Papua New Guinea. When last December Papua New Guinea </p>
<p>-2-<br />
bdcame self-governing, we in Australia no longer regarded it<br />
as appropriate to have a minister responsible for it, so he<br />
retained the position of Minister for Science but we have<br />
wanted him to continue as Minister Assisting the Foreign<br />
Minister in respect of the affairs of the South Pacific.<br />
So, my Foreign Minister who is at the General Assembly of<br />
the United Nations ( and I am bound there in the next couple<br />
of days) has been very anxious that he should participate<br />
on behalf of Australia in so far as Australia's participation<br />
is appropriate in the affairs of this continent. Mr. Morrison<br />
can participate on all the matters of substance which are on<br />
your agenda. In addition, to indicate the interest which<br />
we place in Australia in this representative body we have<br />
brought with us two representatives of the Australian Parliament,<br />
Senator Primmer and Senator Bonner. In Australia we believe<br />
that representative institutions are extraordinarily important.<br />
We are the last to deny that there are very great deficiencies<br />
and shortcomings in Australia's representative institutions.<br />
I could scarcely urge any country in the South Pacific to copy<br />
Australia's political institutions a federal system or a<br />
bicameral system. I don't urge this plan but naturally we still<br />
have the idea that representative government is quite basic if<br />
one is to involve the people in the affairs of government<br />
if government is to be soundly based. We are in population<br />
and also in area a very large country in South Pacific terms.<br />
We therefore are aware that many people might believe us to be<br />
unconcerned or remote or indifferent. We don't want you to<br />
believe that we are indifferent or unconcerned. We have had<br />
experience of very many problems which must concern you. Some<br />
are matters which have arisen only in the last few years.<br />
In the South Pacific the ratio of sea to land is greater than<br />
any other part of the world. Accordingly, there are very many<br />
international matters of navigation and resources which concern<br />
all of us. It is just as important to Australia as it is to<br />
any other country in the South Pacific that there should be<br />
proper international standards set as for the rights of access<br />
by surface or by air or underwater, whether it is for strategic,<br />
political or economic purposes. You are very much aware that<br />
in the South Pacific the law of the sea is quite basic if all<br />
are concerned. There is no difference of interests between<br />
Australia and archipelagos in the south seas. There are also<br />
again many matters in the economic field where our concerns<br />
in Australia may be different in degree but not in time from<br />
those of all the other countries in the South Pacific. All<br />
of us, Australia and all the other countries in the South Pacific,<br />
have been concerned with the price that their products get elsewhere<br />
in the world, the degree to which their products are processesed<br />
in our own countries, the degree to which the products, the<br />
resources of our countries are discovered or developed or marketed<br />
by ourselves or by organisations in which we have a fair share<br />
of the responsibility. And, in these days when inflation<br />
affects so many countries and certainly all the countries with<br />
which the South Pacific countries are trading or with which<br />
they have relations relating to transport and the like, it<br />
is very important that we should all understand the economic<br />
opportunities properly. We want to ensure that even if we depend<br />
on a very few products we can get a fair return from them as<br />
we get a fair share in development. </p>
<p>Well, ladies and gentlemen, the deliberations of the South<br />
Pacific Conference are of concern to Australia not just because<br />
we are all geographically so close but also because as far as<br />
the rest of the world is concerned there are very many things<br />
which concern us just as muclin Australia as they concern people<br />
in the South Pacific. My minister, Mr. Morrison, will be<br />
participating in the conference I am happy to say and will be<br />
reporting to me and our other colleagues on the matters you raise<br />
here. Looking over the last 25 or more years, we can take<br />
quite a deal of satisfaction in the way that this very large<br />
tract of the world's surface has come together, by the way<br />
it has developed its appropriate institutions, the institutions<br />
have changed as the needs have changed and it would seem to us<br />
that this conference is the one which you can not only make<br />
wider representation but it is the only comprehensive one and<br />
despite all the political diversions, the differences, you must<br />
confess, have been largely introduced in political terms in the<br />
last 150 years. Despite all this we are coming to see in the<br />
South Pacific how much we have in common and how much the things<br />
which we each individually want to achieve can be more fully and<br />
promptly achieved if we can consult together. Allow me to conclude<br />
by saying how much more our deliberations will be promoted, how<br />
much more harmonious as well as fruitful they will be because<br />
we are meeting in this beautiful hall, on this beautiful island,<br />
in this benine and benevolent regime. Well, I have only the<br />
opportunity with my senior officials, my Treasurer and our wives<br />
to thank you for your hospitality on our way to North America.<br />
On the way back we will be calling into Fiji for the Centenary<br />
of its association with Britain and at Norfolk Island to commemorate<br />
the 200th anniversary of Captain Cook's landing at that then<br />
uninhabited island, so our way between Australia and North America,<br />
the United Nations, new President Ford, re-elected Prime Minister<br />
Trudeau, will be made all the more interesting, we will be<br />
fortified on our way, refreshed on our way back by going to the<br />
islands of the South Pacific, our neighbours. And for those<br />
who are fortunate enough to be spending weeks instead of days<br />
on this island in this arghipelago, on behalf of the Australian<br />
Government I wish you-/ 8HIy a happy but a very fruitful conference<br />
believing that it will mark another big step in our associations<br />
with the people of the South Pacific. </p>
