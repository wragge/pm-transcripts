Nominations open today for the Prime Minister's Prizes for Science - Australia's most prestigious science awards.</p>
<p>The Prizes honour Australians who have made significant contributions to building a more prosperous and progressive society through scientific achievements and science education.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Julia Gillard and Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Science and Research Chris Evans today encouraged the science community to nominate outstanding colleagues for the Prizes.</p>
<p>The Prizes are part of the Australian Government's Inspiring Australia strategy to foster greater scientific engagement.</p>
<p>Science and innovation are key drivers to improve Australia's living standards, health, productivity and environment.</p>
<p>The Gillard Labor Government highly regards our scientific community for the tremendous contribution it makes to build a richer, fairer, cleaner and safer nation.</p>
<p>In the past, the Prizes have been awarded for Australian discoveries such as wireless LAN technology and the bionic ear and for achievements in areas like immunology, quantum technology and astronomy.</p>
<p>Past Prime Minister's Prizes for Science recipients Elizabeth Blackburn AC and Brian Schmidt went on to be awarded Nobel Prizes in 2009 and 2011 respectively.</p>
<p>Other past recipients include Ezio Rizzardo and David Solomon, John Shine AO, John O'Sullivan, Ian Frazer, Graeme Clark AC and the late Frank Fenner AC.</p>
<p>The prizes are awarded in five categories:</p>
<p> * 	Prime Minister's Prize for Science ($300,000);<br />
 * 	Malcolm McIntosh Prize for Physical Scientist of the Year ($50,000);<br />
 * 	Science Minister's Prize for Life Scientist of the Year ($50,000);<br />
 * 	Prime Minister's Prize for Excellence in Science Teaching in Secondary Schools ($50,000); and<br />
 * 	Prime Minister's Prize for Excellence in Science Teaching in Primary Schools ($50,000).</p>
<p>As well as the cash component, each of the five Prime Minister's Prizes for Science comprise a gold or silver medallion and a lapel pin similar to that presented to recipients of Australian Honours like the AO.</p>
<p>Nominations close on 27 April and the Prizes will be announced later in the year.</p>
