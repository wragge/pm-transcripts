PRIME MINISTER<br />
CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMARGOED-UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTR OF AUSTRALIA,<br />
THE HON R J L BAN" E AC MP<br />
DINNER HOSTED BY THE LORD MAYOR OF LONDON<br />
MANSION HOUSE, LONDON 21 JUNE 1989<br />
My Lord Mayor,<br />
Your Royal Highnesses,<br />
Your Excellencies,<br />
My Lords,<br />
Aldermen, Sheriffs, Ladies and Gentlemen<br />
That great citizen of London, Dr Johnson, declared more than<br />
two hundred years ago that the man who was tired of London<br />
was tired of life itself.<br />
I have visited London on many occasions as a student on my<br />
way through Oxford, as a trade unionist, and as Prime<br />
Minister and I have never tired of it, nor failed to be<br />
fascinated by some new discovery in it.<br />
But perhaps this is not so surprising in a city which, as<br />
you have said, Lord Mayor, this year celebrates the 800th<br />
anniversary of the appointment of the first Lord Mayor of<br />
London by King Richard I.<br />
May I say there is something very fitting about that the<br />
historic association of Richard the Lion Heart with this<br />
lion-hearted city.<br />
I congratulate you, Lord Mayor, on this very notabl e<br />
anniversary, and I thank you for this opportunity to address<br />
such a distinguished gathering in this historic house.<br />
Last year we in Australia, of course, celebrated our<br />
Bicentenary. Australia was-settled in the era of the great<br />
revolution in America and indeed as a direct result of it;<br />
and at the time of the revolution in Prance. But, our local<br />
dramas of Vinegar Hill, the so-called Rum Rebellion, and the<br />
Eureka Stockade notwithstanding, there was never going to be<br />
a revolution of the Australian colonies. 0 I( </p>
<p>2.<br />
There was instead an evolution the gradual attainment by<br />
Australians of political and judicial authority over our own<br />
affairs; an irresistible emergence of an independent, self<br />
confident Australia from beneath the protective cloak of our<br />
British founders; an ungrudging and peaceful disengagement,<br />
characterised by a shared commitment to democratic and<br />
constitutional government, and to the supremacy of<br />
individual freedoms within the rule of law.<br />
There are some commentators, in both our countries, who seen<br />
to think that the history, heritage and traditions we share<br />
are mere anachronisms.<br />
They see that Britons have claimed their future as part of a<br />
large and integrated Europe, while we Australians have moved<br />
to enmesh ourselves with the dynamism of Asia and the<br />
Pacific; and they wrongly conclude that Australians and<br />
Britons are irreversibly drifting apart.<br />
But the truth is that we still need each other as we enter<br />
the 1990s together. For today it is our privilege and our<br />
profound challenge to be living in a rapidly changing<br />
world one in which the values of individual liberty we<br />
uphold, the democratic freedoms we champion, the so 1Q<br />
justice we enjoy, the commitment to the path of peace and<br />
the rule of law, that we share, have never been so relevant.<br />
My Lord Mayor,<br />
There is no city in the world to which the cause of<br />
democratic freedom owes so much. For 800 years London has<br />
been in the vanguard in establishing the rights of citizens.<br />
of no other city in the world could it have been said, as<br />
was so truly said of London just on fifty years ago, that<br />
upon its survival depended the survival of freedom in Europe<br />
and far beyond.<br />
And not least because of the steadfastness and sacrifice of<br />
that generation of Londoners in 1940, we as free men and<br />
women in the democratic West are now privileged to be<br />
witnesses to the drama of democracy extending its influence<br />
in societies previously marked by the untrammeled imposition<br />
of centralised power.<br />
Whether we look to the creative and, indeed, courageous<br />
programs of Glasnost and Perestroika being implemented by<br />
President Gorbachev, the positive nature of which was, to<br />
her credit, identified at an early stage by Prime Minister<br />
Thatcher; or to the emerging pluralism in other parts of<br />
Eastern Europe; or to the dramatic demonstrations for<br />
democracy in Beijing and their tragic supression; what we<br />
are seeing is a political and economic system a system<br />
predicated on a fundamental fraud on human aspirations<br />
being strained to breaking point. </p>
<p>we may look briefly at just a few of the astonishing<br />
specifics of this process of change.<br />
In the Soviet Union, we have seen political bosses rejected<br />
in humiliating circumstances by the people; we have heard<br />
genuine debate for the first time in living memory in<br />
political institutions where sterile unanimity has been the<br />
norm, we are witnessing the open expression of views which<br />
were once the preserve only of a courageous and persecuted<br />
minority. In Poland, Solidarity has achieved an overwhelming election<br />
victory. The new direction in Hungarian politics was given powerful<br />
symbolism by the reburial last Friday of Imre Nagy. We are<br />
seeing there the emergence of genuinely independent<br />
political organisations sanctioned by a once monolithic<br />
party.<br />
we see, apparently, a new tolerance of diversity in a Warsaw<br />
Pact alliance once marked by iron conformity.<br />
The question we naturally ask is whether these developments<br />
are superficial, or are they fundamental?<br />
This much is clear. The ideology based on the centralised<br />
command economy has not only failed it is being abandoned,<br />
scuttled by its own disillusioned disciples. To be sure,<br />
not yet everywhere; but in enough countries for us truly to<br />
be able to talk of this as one of the most profound trends<br />
of the late twentieth century.<br />
I believe we are seeing not merely temporary setbacks to an<br />
otherwise viable system, but profound failures in the system<br />
itself, failure at its very heart.<br />
In Chiina, the ruthless and repugnant supression of<br />
democratic aspirations may succeed in the short term in<br />
securing the power of an isolated few. But let there be no<br />
doubt in anyone's mind that the massacre in Tiananmen Square<br />
is a supreme expression of the failure of a system.<br />
The democratic aspirations of the Chinese people are certain<br />
to re-assert themselves. The Chinese leaders will have to<br />
adapt in time to that reality or be swept aside by it.<br />
The developments I have referred to are all symptoms of<br />
far-reaching change which is shaking the foundations of<br />
Marxism/ LeniisI. As an experiment which began in the early<br />
years of this century, we know, in its closing years, that<br />
i. t is an experiment which has failed. </p>
<p>My Lord Mayor, ladies and gentlemen,<br />
As democrats, we must develop a response to these historic<br />
developments more sophisticated and more far-sighted than<br />
mere gloating.<br />
Those communist countries which recognise the need for<br />
change face a very difficult transition.<br />
And we ourselves should never forget that the West has<br />
reached its present position of hope by many paths, often<br />
tortuous and difficult.<br />
we cannot deny the trauma of our own history in trying to<br />
adapt our political processes to the imperatives of economic<br />
change. There was no easy or inevitable symmetry between<br />
the evolution of the competitive mnarket economy and the<br />
development of parliamentary democracy and social justice.<br />
As an inheritor a proud standard-bearer of the great<br />
Australian Labor tradition, as a life-long unionist, I know<br />
that social democracy and trade unionism have had to<br />
struggle and sacrifice to make their immeasurable<br />
contribution to the social justice which characterises<br />
western societies.<br />
But there has never been a single recipe for success.<br />
Within our own political and economic system, no side can<br />
claim a monopoly of wisdom. Indeed, the contest of ideas is<br />
the very essence of democracy.<br />
It is precisely because, as a result of long, hard struggle,<br />
we have as Western societies achieved the conjunction of<br />
democracy, economic progress, and social justice, that we<br />
can stand at the bar of history and call on others to<br />
accomplish that same conjunction. Moreover, because we<br />
achieved it, we can help them to do so too, albeit within<br />
the framework of their own traditions and cultures.<br />
So we must not merely cheer the failure of an ideology which<br />
was always objectionable to those who cherished the liberty<br />
of the individual. wie must, more positively, make the most<br />
of the opportunities offered by the success of an idea the<br />
idea of openness and diversity which is the hallmark of the<br />
free society.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
The western policy of detente of the early 1970s failed,<br />
because, in seeking to moderate Soviet international<br />
behaviour, it made no demands for reform or the extension of<br />
human rights in the Soviet system itself. That policy<br />
effectively only allowed the old Soviet rulers to delay the<br />
inevitable reforms that Mr Gorbachev has now undertaken. </p>
<p>But I believe that we should continue the current policies<br />
of the West towards the Soviet union, which are bringing<br />
about what I see as a genuine detente. Ref ormns are occuring<br />
inside the Warsaw Pact. Human rights are being extended to<br />
the peoples of Eastern Europe. And at the same time, after<br />
At ganistan, after INF, after Namibia, who can deny that<br />
Soviet behaviour is moderating?<br />
So the first thing'we must do is to be prepared to recognise<br />
progress in Eastern Europe, to do what we can to encourage<br />
it, to take the initiative in ars control as President Bush<br />
has so outstandingly in recent days.<br />
Further, we must ensure that our own behaviour in supporting<br />
the values which have made our society strong remains a<br />
model. We must ensure that we do not fail, in the standards<br />
we set ourselves, to uphold and advance those elements of<br />
our system on which our own prosperity and political<br />
freedoms are based.<br />
on many occasions, I have commented elsewhere on what I<br />
consider the ultimate paradox of our times: the paradox<br />
that at the very time the centralised command economies are<br />
attempting to move towards greater competitiveness and<br />
openness, the market economies continue to close up in key<br />
areas of trade. Thus, at a time of optimism, based on the<br />
increasingly intelligent political relations between the<br />
superpowers, the vision of a saner world is distorted by a<br />
shortsighted reluctance to liberalise the world trading<br />
system on which the prosperity of the market economies has<br />
been built and on which the prosperity of the world as a<br />
whole depends.<br />
The economic integration of Western Europe has been one of<br />
the most bold, creative and positive developments of this<br />
century, enhancing the living standards of its peoples in a<br />
dramatic fashion.<br />
In 1992, you will be moving to a new stage of your<br />
evolution, creating a single market of vast proportions<br />
320 million people which will further enhance the economic<br />
opportunities and efficiency of Western Europe.<br />
This development sends the most powerful signal possible to<br />
the EAst that if they wish to advance they will need to<br />
continue their own process of economic reconstruction.<br />
I cannot say too strongly, however, that this powerful<br />
message of efficiency and competition is blurred and muted<br />
by Europe's equivocation on the issue of protectionism. </p>
<p>6.<br />
With what effectiveness and credibility can we encourage the<br />
emulation by, and foster the 7lobal integration of, the<br />
so-called command economies, if we do not continue to<br />
practice the trading rules on which our own prosperity is<br />
built?<br />
Now this is not the place for a technical dissertation on<br />
the world trading system, or for detailed representations on<br />
features of the European Community which cause concern to<br />
Australia. But I do make the point that the West is itself capable of<br />
economic irrationality for which, if it continues, we will<br />
pay dearly. In agriculture, you have in Europe created a<br />
monster that not only hurts us but hurts you.<br />
Let me tell you now hurtful and how wasteful, is this<br />
monster. Last year the Common Agricultural Policy accounted for<br />
around two thirds of EC budget expenditures, or some<br />
17.5 billion pounds.<br />
Do Europeans realise that their agricultural producers are<br />
receiving on average nearly 40 per cent of their total<br />
income in subsidies from the taxpayer?<br />
European consumers are paying two to three times world price<br />
for many basic foods.<br />
Let me put it even more simply: Do Europeans realise that<br />
for every cow in their dairy farms, they are paying, in the<br />
form of subsidies and higher prices, some 555 pounds per<br />
cowl Let me give another example. Australia is an efficient coal<br />
producer. But the subsidies and other support measures in<br />
Japan and the European community especially, I point out,<br />
in the United Kingdom and in West Germany are costing our<br />
producers billions of. dollars in lost export opportunities.<br />
Subsidised British coal prices are some 180% of the price of<br />
imported coals; again, it is consumers who bear the brunt of<br />
this inefficiency. Throughout the EC, in 1986 they<br />
subs idised every employee in the coal industry to the tune<br />
of some 17,000 pounds.<br />
so, as Europe approaches the critical transformation of<br />
1992, Australia will not simply be an uninterested<br />
bystander. We can't afford to be.<br />
I </p>
<p>Let me make it clear. We don't seek anything like a return<br />
to the pre-Common Market days when Australian agricultural<br />
products had preferred access to British markets.<br />
We don't seek favours or special deals.<br />
All we seek is fair access and the ability to compete on an<br />
equal basis. A single integrated European market will<br />
create tremendous opportunities for us, for you, and for the<br />
world. It is in the interests of no-one if, at this crucial stage,<br />
access is restricted and if efficiency is retarded, by the<br />
creation of a fortress Europe after 1992.<br />
But, ladies and gentlemen, my comments tonight are not meant<br />
to have purely an economic perspective.<br />
Because the European quest for integration was never, in the<br />
minod fthevisionary architects of the European community<br />
in the early post-war years, simply a narrow, technical<br />
economic exercise. They knew it had a wider potential and<br />
so, in practice, it has proved.<br />
Europe is acquiring the habits, and creating the<br />
institutions, of co-operation and that constitutes a truly<br />
remarkable historical change.<br />
After centuries of shifting alliances and, too often<br />
including twice in this century bitter arnd debilitating<br />
war, you have, together, ushered in an era of peaceful<br />
collaboration, and of ever deepening commitment to democracy<br />
by all the peoples of Western Europe.<br />
I appreciate, of course, that 1992 will not provide a recipe<br />
for political unity or even for a united European position<br />
on international political and security questions. But I do<br />
believe it symbolises and expresses the trend towards West<br />
European co-operation which simply must in the future make<br />
western Europe a more influential voice in the world. we<br />
welcome that, without reservation.<br />
My Lord Mayor, ladies and gentlemen,<br />
The west must do more than set an example of an efficient<br />
economic model at work,, important though that is. We must<br />
continue to be responsive to the demands of our people, and<br />
we must continue to be prepared to shape the international<br />
agenda for change. </p>
<p>Perhaps nowhere is this more pressing than in the need to<br />
ensure we bequeath to future generations not only a planet<br />
free of the threat of nuclear holocaust but one not<br />
despoiled by our own shortsighted habits of pollution.<br />
Already, the roll call of environmental disaster is<br />
appalling: Bhopal, Chernobyl, the Exxon Val~ dez, the Amazon<br />
basin, acid rain, the depletion of the ozone layer, the<br />
greenhouse effect.<br />
We can't solve these by ourselves but we must solve then<br />
together. I know your Prime Minister, Mrs Thatcher, has demonstrated<br />
her commitment to the environment and recently, showed the<br />
way by hosting a very important conference on the ozone<br />
layer. I look forward to an era when Governments around the<br />
world will be working to avoid the catastrophe we would<br />
otherwise face.<br />
Let me draw your attention in particular to one initiative<br />
Australia has taken. Antarctica is the last of the world's<br />
pristine continents and wildernesses. It must be protected.<br />
it must not be mined.<br />
Australia has refused to sign the Antarctic Minerals<br />
convention because we believe a tighter safeguard is needed<br />
a comprehensive environment protection regime, creating an<br />
international wilderness Reserve.<br />
Britons, from Cook on, played a leading role in the<br />
discovery and charting of the Antarctic. I was delighted to<br />
receive recently a letter from Sir Peter Scott son of<br />
Scott of the Antarctic. He has, it might almost be said, an<br />
hereditary right to speak on this issue and Sir Peter very<br />
forcefully supports our stand.<br />
To all people I say: join us in this vital quest to<br />
safeguard the earth's last continental wilderness.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
in this world, it is very much in the interests of both of<br />
us that Australia and Britain work closely together to<br />
achieve our goals.<br />
Don't let anybody pretend that Australia and Britain have no<br />
further use for each other.<br />
our relationship is too close, too valuable, too mutually<br />
beneficial, to be easily put aside. </p>
<p>Australians and Britons have met on many occasions and in<br />
many circumstances. We have met always as comrades on the<br />
battlefield; always as rivals on the cricket pitch. we have<br />
met as friends and relatives, as tourists in each other's<br />
countries, as partners and competitors in business.<br />
Surely, as Australian businesses continue to look to Britain<br />
as a doorway into Europe, and as British businesses continue<br />
to assess Australia, rightly, to be a powerful springboard<br />
into the vast opportunities of the Asian markets, our<br />
commercial ties can only increase.<br />
Tomorrow, some 300 executives of British and Australian<br />
companies will gather in a Trade and Investment Conference<br />
which will explore the prospects for enlarged cooperation.<br />
Let me express my thanks to the British Government for its<br />
active support for this very important conference.<br />
I acknowledge, in particular, the personal commitment<br />
Mrs Thatcher made towards the re-invigoration and<br />
modernisation of the British-Australian relationship.<br />
In the united Kingdom we see a strong friend, vital both to<br />
the economic well-being and the physical security of the<br />
world a nation with whom we can talk as partners, a<br />
society devoted to the freedoms we believe in and an~ economy<br />
of great opportunity.<br />
our shared language and culture, the strong bonds of history<br />
and of kinship, our familiar institutions of political,<br />
economic, legal and academic life all these mean that<br />
though Australians now arrive here as foreigniers, we can<br />
never arrive as strangers.<br />
Tonight I want to add one further strand to the web of our<br />
associations. The British-Australian Bicentennial Trust<br />
excists because of British generosity. The Australian<br />
Government will match the British contribution with a grant<br />
of $ 300,000 for a Scholarship and Fellowship fund to<br />
encourage the two-way novement of young students between our<br />
countries. My Lord Mayor,<br />
Your Royal 1ighnesses,<br />
Ladies and gentlemn<br />
In this historic room, in the heart of London this citadel<br />
of freedom the memory of all those famous names who have<br />
been here before us forms an almost palpable presence. </p>
<p>it was here in this very place in 1943, that Winston<br />
Churchill was able to describe the full extent of our<br />
victory at El Aleiuein the turning point in the war in<br />
which the Australian 9th Division had played so crucial a<br />
role. It was then and here that Churchill delivered the<br />
prophecy that has passed into history that El Alemein was<br />
not the end or even the beginning of the end, but the end of<br />
the beginning.<br />
Today, we can look to new beginnings in that same spirit of<br />
firm confidence and hope, informed by a watchful caution.<br />
We can and must make new beginnings towards fairer and freer<br />
world trade.<br />
We can and must make new beginnings in the relations between<br />
East and West.<br />
We can and must make new beginnings to save the earth from<br />
environmental disaster.<br />
And our two countries, Britain and Australia, can work as<br />
we are working for new beginnings and new opportunities to<br />
build on the grand partnership we have had for two hundred<br />
years. And each of those tasks, however different, however<br />
difficult, call for special qualities of energy and<br />
enterprise, of will and intellect. It will call, at times,<br />
for courageous decisions; and, above all, it will crall. for<br />
the application of the values of human dignity and human<br />
freedom.<br />
My Lord mayor,<br />
I mean no idle compliment when I say that those are<br />
precisely the qualities and values which have progressively<br />
enriched, generation after generation, for eight hundred<br />
years the life, the splendour and the-achievement of the<br />
city of London.<br />
it is with great pleasure that I reciprocate your toast.<br />
I give you, the Lord Mayor and corporation of London. </p>
