PRIME MINISTER'S WEEKLY BROADCAST A FAIR GO FOR INDEXATION<br />
Sunday 14 September 1975<br />
The vast majority of us earn our living as employeesas<br />
wage and salary earners. So we have a natural concern to see 0<br />
that our wages keep pace with movements in the cost of living.<br />
No Government has done more than mine to protect and indeed,<br />
improve the real value of workers' incomes. With the support<br />
of the trade union movement we have fought a long, successful<br />
battle to bring in wage indexation. If it succeeds wage<br />
indexation will be counted among our principal achievements.<br />
It not only safeguards employees' living standards; it is an<br />
essential part of the Government's battle against inflation.<br />
I want every Australian worker to understand the<br />
real benefits of wage indexation. Indexation is a new word:<br />
some people may not be quite sure what it means. It means that<br />
if the cost of living goes up by a certain percentage, wages<br />
and salarieslare increased by the same percentage. So it's<br />
basically a very simple idea; but it took us a great deal of<br />
argument and persuasion to get the Conciliation and Arbitration<br />
Commission to'agree to it. Indexation is not something we can<br />
introduce on our own, though certainly we have done what we<br />
can for our own employees in the public service. We had to<br />
convince the Commission that indexation would work. We had<br />
to convince the Commission that it wouldn't push wages ahead too<br />
fast and add to inflationary pressures in the economy. We had<br />
to show that by safeguarding workers' living standards, indexation<br />
would discourage excessive wage claims by unions at a time when<br />
the nation couldn't afford them.<br />
6 The Coamission accepted our arguments. It decided<br />
to give indexation a try. It insisted that if indexation were<br />
granted, unions should not claim wage rises in excess of the<br />
cost-of-living adjustments and the increases that flow to all<br />
workers from national wage cases based on national productivity.<br />
This doesn't mean that workers' living standards are frozen.<br />
It means that, so long as inflation remains a serious problem any<br />
rises apart from those for cost-of-living or productivity should<br />
be granted only on the basis of changing work values. The<br />
Commission also agreed that some rises may be needed to help<br />
certain unions catch up with other workers if their members were<br />
seriously disadvantaged. This seemed to us like a pretty fair arrangement.<br />
It meant that all workers would be protected against inflation,<br />
no matter how strong or weak their unions were, no matter what<br />
their bargaining power. We are the first Government to give<br />
this real protection to the wage earner. You may remember that<br />
there was a system of quarterly adjustments for workers in the<br />
late 1940s and early 1950s. The Liberals abolished these<br />
adjustments and left workers completely at the mercy of cost<br />
of living rises. Mind you, the old system wasn't anything like<br />
as good as the present system of indexation. Adjustments were<br />
applied to the basic wage only;-our system applies to the total<br />
award wage and we have asked the Commission to apply it to<br />
over-award payments as well. It gives genuine, total protection<br />
to the worker. Together with the tax reforms announced in our<br />
Budget last month, Australian workers will be better off than<br />
ever before better off in their take-home pay, better off in their<br />
protection against inflation, better off in their real living standards. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
I make the point strongly that we don't regard<br />
indexation on its own as an adequate protection for the worker.<br />
It must be ta: ken in conjunction with our new tax system a<br />
system that is fair to all, and will put another $ 5 a week and<br />
more in the pay packets of the average wage earner. And remember<br />
this: under-the Labor Government the wage earner is benefiting<br />
in other important ways. He is saving on his mortgage payments,<br />
he is saving on his health insurance. Medibank alone saves the<br />
family man $ 2 to $ 3 a week in medical benefit payments..<br />
Still, indexation is the basic protection for the<br />
wage earner and his family; his key to security in difficult<br />
times. With indexation, no worker need fear the effects of<br />
inflation. OfL course the fight against inflation will continueit<br />
must continue. Our whole Budget has been framed for that<br />
purpose, and indexation itself willehelp keep inflation down.<br />
There are signs that it is doing so already. Certainly the<br />
number of industrial disputes has fallen dramatically since<br />
indexation was introduced. So we're building up a new climate<br />
of stability and security for the worker secure wages, stable<br />
industrial coi~ ditions. We have to work hard to ensure that this<br />
climate is maintained.<br />
S I have to say frankly -that despite all our efforts<br />
indexation is under attack. Not surprisingly, it's under attack<br />
from some employers. These employers don't like the idea of<br />
regular increases in their wages bill, even when these increases<br />
discourage much bigger and more costly rises. But there is<br />
a much more dangerous attack on indexation from another quarter.-<br />
It comes from a handful of powerful unions. These unions are<br />
seeking rises from their members far above the indexation<br />
formula. If these rises are granted rises of $ 35 a week in<br />
some cases the whole indexation system will be in jeopardy.<br />
All our efforts to protect the worker from inflation, to establish<br />
secure and stable industrial conditions, to create the right<br />
climate for a national anti-inflation drive, will be destroyed.<br />
That must not happen. You may say that it's the job of any union to secure<br />
the-highest possible wages for its members. That's certainly<br />
been the rule in the past, but in today's conditions it ignores<br />
two things. It ignores the fact that some unions are much<br />
stronger than others, and can win bigger rises for their members<br />
where other unions can't. It leaves the weak and unorganised<br />
worker at a disadvantage. And it ignores the fact that unions<br />
in key industries, by using any tactic they choose to win higher<br />
wages, will force employers to sack workers so they can meet<br />
the higher wages bill. In other words, any increase in wages<br />
outside the indexation system must be gained at.. the expense of<br />
fellow workers, and ultimately at the cost of their jobs. Workers<br />
who accept indexation are inevitably the victims of those who won't.<br />
Their jobs are threatened by a minority of workers in key industries.<br />
We can see examples of these tactics right now in the oil and<br />
petrochemical industries in New'South Wales and Victoria. / 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
I want to make it quite clear that the Australian<br />
Government will stand firm on indexation. We don't regard<br />
the present system as perfect; we'll keep looking for ways to<br />
improve it. We'll do everything to see that the ordinary worker<br />
gets the protection and security he needs. I ask every wage<br />
and salary earner to play his part in making indexation work.<br />
It's a struggle for the entire trade union movement. Decent<br />
and responsible unions must not be cheated out of the benefits<br />
of indexation by the selfish actions of a minority.<br />
Indexation has been given a trial by the Commission<br />
but the battle is far from won. The Commission still has to decide<br />
whether indexation should continue. Everything will depend on<br />
the willingness of unions to co-operate. The alternative to<br />
indexation is not just higher pay for some workers and lower pay<br />
for others. The alternative is industrial chaos and inflation<br />
on a scale that we have never seen before. </p>
