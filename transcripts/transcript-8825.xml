ADDRESS BY THE PRIME MINISTER THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
MEDICARE: KEEPING HEALTH CARE AFFORDABLE FOR AUSTRALIANS<br />
Brisbane, 22 February, 1993<br />
What a shame that we once again find ourselvcs fighting to preserve Medicare.<br />
And let there be no mistake. Medicare is under attack.<br />
If Dr Hcwson and his Coalition were to get their hands on our health system you know<br />
what would happen.<br />
They would dismantle it.<br />
Don't isten to their " promises" to preserve Medicare. Just look at their track record and<br />
the fine print of their policies.<br />
Remember it happened once beforel<br />
In the 1975 election campaign Malcolm Fraser said he would not dismantle Medibank.<br />
And look what happened. Seven years later, when the Fraser Government was thrown out<br />
of office, Medibank had gone and more than two million Australians had no health cover.<br />
Do we want that to happen again?<br />
I don't think so.<br />
Do we want an Am. ican-stylc health system where public hospitals turn you away if you<br />
don't have a Blue Cross card in your wallet?<br />
I don't think so.<br />
6058 </p>
<p>I<br />

Do we want our health costs to skyrocket by giving doctors the power to set their own fees<br />
while the rest of us will have to accept lower wages under Dr Hewson's individual<br />
contracta? I don't think so.<br />
Do you want to see bulk-billing abolished for more than 13 million Australians? Do you<br />
want the Medicare relate for bul-billing to drop from 85 per cent to 75 per cent, thus<br />
reducing the incentive for doctors to bulkbill even pensioners?<br />
If doctors set their own fees, they are likely to increase by around 30 per cent.<br />
This means having a baby would cost $ 1170 instead of $ 475 today.<br />
A visit to the family doctor will increase from S24 to $ 32 with only $ 18 of it claimable.<br />
This means every trip to the doctor would cost $ 14. If families wanted to bring this down<br />
to only $ 5 they could take out gap insurance but that would cost $ 6 a week!<br />
Does this sound fair?<br />
I don't think so and rm sure you don't either.<br />
Yet, make no mistake, this is what Dr Hewson has in store for you.<br />
He may not be spelling out the details of what he has in mind.<br />
He's a bit like Jeff Kcnnt in that respect. He hopes to get through the election ca= paign<br />
without telqlingvW0iiaU the nastiea. He's refuaing to even release many of his policies.<br />
He won't tell us the details of his industrial relationfolicy for instance.<br />
Just like Jeff Kennctt. He didn't tell the people of Victoria either and look what<br />
happened there.<br />
Next Monday the award system in Victoria will come to an end and the working men and<br />
women of that satc will be on their own.<br />
Dr Hewson is just the same on a whole range of policies including Medicare.<br />
He tries to make his plan sound a lot better than it really is. He docmsn't want us to read the<br />
fin print and discover how much worse off most of us would be.<br />
He says, for instance, that he'll give tax credits for private health insurance.<br />
He implies theze will cover the cost of private health insurance. 658k </p>
<p>What he dga^ tell you is that 60 per cent of families with children will get no tax credits<br />
at all.<br />
The few families who wiLbenefit will only get around $ 200 to $ 300 a year a long way<br />
from the $ 1600 that pnvate insurance costs a family.<br />
And Dr Hewson has the nerve to claim that families will be better off under the Coalition's<br />
health care scheme.<br />
This is simply not the case.<br />
And you don't just have to take my word for it.<br />
Listen to what the experts have to say:<br />
Dr John Deebic, a health economist from the Australian National University, and one of<br />
the original architects of Medicare, has estimated that doctors' private incomes would<br />
increase on average by 60 per cent under Fightback!<br />
And Professor Jeffrey Richardson, the Professor of Health Economics at Monash<br />
University says the Coalition's health policy will lead to " major inflation in hospital costs<br />
and medical incomes".<br />
The Deptenigt of Finance estimates that health costs for the average family will increase<br />
by $ 22 a week if Dr Hewson puts his plan into effect.<br />
Why on earth would he want to do this when we presently enjoy one of the best health<br />
care systems in the world!<br />
We have a simple, affordable system of universal health care.<br />
It means no one is denied medical treatment because they can't afford to pay.<br />
And the government is doing what it can to improve Medicare.<br />
We have committed an additional $ 1.6 billion over the next five years to increase patients'<br />
access to public hospitals. And we are providing $ 70 million to reduce waiting lists for<br />
surgery. What would Dr Hewson do instead?<br />
He wants to take $ 13 billion out of the public hospital system. This would mean that<br />
over 10,000 public hospital beds would Have tobe closed an estimated 1.730 of them<br />
here in Queensland.<br />
It wil mean 450,000 fewer people would be treated in public hospitals.<br />
6590 </p>
<p>This is totally unfair.<br />
It would force thousands of people into costly priyate P nrac Families would have to<br />
find an extra $ 400 to S600 a year just to purchase h cover that is, Just to get cover as<br />
a private patient in a qg= hospital.<br />
This would not give them access to private hospitalsl<br />
Nor would Dr Hewon's health scheme cover people with cancer or other pre-existing<br />
conditions. The private health funds simply won't give insurance to people with Multiple Sclerosis or<br />
-I1V or other conditions that require continuous and often costly treatment.<br />
What is supposed to happen to these people?<br />
How will they fund their treatment?<br />
Do we really want to become the sort of society that abandons its sick and its weak?<br />
I don't think we do.<br />
The kind of society we cherish, and which the Labor Goverment has worked hard for a<br />
decad to consolidate, is one which cares for all its citizens on the basis of their needs<br />
not on the buis of their incomes.<br />
I doubt if anyone he= today wants to put those values in jeopardy.<br />
I am sure that you, as hospital employees, as dedicated medical professionals, do not want<br />
to be in the hideous position of having to turn away seriously ill or injured people because<br />
the= arm no beds for them or because they can't afford to pay.<br />
Dr Hewson also claims that health services will be zero rated under the GST.<br />
But why should we believe him?<br />
The Cole Committee, which was set up to advise Dr Hewson on which items should be<br />
included under the GST, has rcommended that health be taxed.<br />
Just like it is in New Zealand.<br />
But the Cole Committee knew how unpopular this recommendation would be. So they<br />
advocated the Jeff Kennett option keep quiet about it until after the lewiont<br />
Tax heaith. they said to Dr Hcwson. but only " when in Government". 6591 </p>
<p>In other words, don't come clean with the voters. Don't tell them what<br />
new and nasty taxes you've got in mind.<br />
Promiae them anything and then " when in Government' scatter the GST<br />
around on every item you can.<br />
Look at non-prescripton drugs for Instance.<br />
Will the GST apply to aspirin and cold tablets and asthma puffers?<br />
It will if the Cole Committee recommendations are taken up. They say<br />
that only prescription drugs under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Schema<br />
should be zero-rated. All other medical produaIiive a 15 per cent<br />
GST. And that inciudes women's sanitary products like tampons items which<br />
presently attract no tax at all.<br />
Dr HawEon would make it more expensive to be a woman.<br />
You can't get much more unfair than that.<br />
When it comes to other areas of health services, he just won't let on<br />
what he has in mind.<br />
Will chiropractors be taxed? Speech therapsts? Midwives? Akmbulance<br />
services? And what about medical products.<br />
WhIch medicine will be zero-rated?<br />
Dr Hewson has got to tell us.<br />
He can't run around the country telling people they will be better off<br />
under Fightback. when he secretly plans to tax every aspect of our<br />
daily livas. He just won't get away with it.<br />
I believe the Australian people value and appreciate Medicare.<br />
I do not believe they want to return to the bad old days of a new<br />
health scheme practically every year.<br />
Remember during the seven years of the Fraser government there were<br />
five different health schemes.<br />
How many schemes would Dr Hewsn give us before the people said<br />
Enough Is Enough! and demanded the return of Medicare?<br />
6592 </p>
<p>6<br />
I sbuddcr to think<br />
All I know is that it's too big a risk.<br />
Our health is too important to us to risk having it tinkered with in this fashion by an<br />
Opposition which won't even come clean about what they want to do.<br />
We have a system which works. Which is fair. Which we are committed to improving so<br />
it meets the needs of all Australians. Let's make sure we stay healthy under Medxicare.<br />
And the way to do that is to keep Medicare healthy! 6593 </p>
