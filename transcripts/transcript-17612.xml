Prime Minister Julia Gillard and Attorney-General Robert McClelland today announced further Commonwealth assistance for Victorian communities impacted by recent severe flooding.</p>
<p>The Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payment (AGDRP) has been activated which will provide those eligible with a one-off payment of $1,000 for adults and $400 for each child.</p>
<p>This payment will go some way to helping people get back on their feet as they get on with the job of rebuilding their lives and cleaning up.</p>
<p>In addition, the Gillard Government has also activated the â€˜Category C' Community Recovery Package under the Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements (NDRRA).</p>
<p>The package includes:</p>
<p> * 	$4 million Community Recovery Fund to help restore community facilities; and<br />
 * 	$25,000 clean up and restoration grants for small businesses and primary producers. </p>
<p>This package will help flood affected communities recover as well as minimise the economic impact of the floods and allow people to get back to business as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>This announcement is in addition to Commonwealth assistance already being provided across 27 local government areas under the Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements, including:</p>
<p> * 	personal hardship and distress assistance;<br />
 * 	restoration of essential public infrastructure; and<br />
 * 	counter disaster operations.</p>
<p>Through the Disaster Income Recovery Subsidy, the Government is also providing additional support for employees, small businesses and farmers who have lost income as a direct result of the floods.</p>
<p>The Australian Government will continue to work with Victoria to ensure affected communities get the support they need.</p>
<p>Information about the AGDRP and the Disaster Income Recovery Subsidy can be obtained through the Australian Government Emergency Information Line on 180 2266. The line will be open from 8am to 8pm local time, seven days a week. </p>
<p>Enquiries in relation to the Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements (NDRRA) should be directed to the Victorian Department of Human Services on 1300 650 172 or visit <a href="http://www.dhs.vic.gov.au/emergency">www.dhs.vic.gov.au/emergency</a></p>
