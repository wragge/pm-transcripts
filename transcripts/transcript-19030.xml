<p>Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payments (AGDRP) have now been extended to people severely affected by flooding in the Lockyer Valley and North Burnett local government areas in Queensland.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister visited North Burnett yesterday and it's clear  these destructive storms and flooding have had a devastating impact on the community. With residents now looking towards recovery, individuals who have been impacted by the severe weather and associated flooding can claim AGDRP payments of $1,000 for each eligible adult and $400 for each eligible child from the Australian Government.</p>
<p>People can lodge a claim online at humanservices.gov.au/disaster, by calling the Australian Government Emergency Information Line on 180 22 66 from 8am to 8pm local time, seven days a week, or in person at recovery centres or any Centrelink Service Centre during their usual business hours.</p>
<p>Extra staff are being deployed to the Department of Human Service's service centres in the region  -  as well as in some recovery centres  -  where they can assist people with their claims. Outreach services are also being provided to some impacted areas and the Australian Government Mobile Service Centre is delivering services in Bundaberg.</p>
<p>The payments are designed to assist individuals severely affected by the floods to get back on their feet. The AGDRP is already being provided to individuals who have been severely impacted in the local government areas of Bundaberg, Gladstone, Gympie and Fraser Coast.</p>
