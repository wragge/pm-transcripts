    <subjects>National Memorial Service for the Australasian Fire and Emergency Service Authorities Council,  Indonesian Ambassador,  executions of Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran. </subjects>
    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>It’s good to be here at the Fire and Emergency Services Memorial here by the side of Lake Burley Griffin to pay tribute to all who serve our community in the fire and emergency services and in particular to say thank you to the families of those men who have recently lost their lives in the service of our community in our various fire and emergency services.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong></p>
<p>Can we get your reaction to the Indonesian Ambassador’s statement expressing sympathy to the families of Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran? Is that too little too late?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>It's a sign that decent people in Indonesia appreciate the anger that Australians feel at these cruel and unnecessary deaths and it’s a sign that, in time, the good and strong friendship between Australia and Indonesia can be resumed.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong></p>
<p>Prime Minister, what about the fact that Prabowo, Widodo’s opponent, [inaudible] that he had political cover or agreement, if you like, if he wanted to give clemency or at least put off these executions, is that even more galling?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Look, obviously, it’s disappointing that the various representations that were made from this country, indeed from around the world, were not heeded and the point I've made all along is that I don't believe that those executions represented Indonesia at its best. I know Indonesia well. I have had the honour of meeting a number of very senior Indonesians over the years. I have great affection for Indonesia. I have great respect for the leadership of Indonesia, and this was not Indonesia at its best.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong></p>
<p>[inaudible] an email suggesting more action under way than we might have known about re the governance in the Liberal Party. You initially dismissed this as a storm in a teacup. Do you still believe that’s the case?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Well, it’s actually a zephyr in a thimble because the only thing that matters is that he signed off on the Liberal Party’s accounts.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong></p>
<p>Did the Government ask General Prabowo to intervene on behalf of Australia to spare the lives of the Bali 9 pair?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>We made every effort – through official channels, through unofficial channels, publicly and privately – to appeal to the better angels of their natures. That's what we did. We deeply regret that those representations at every level weren’t successful.</p>
<p>Yes, this is a difficult moment in the relationship between Australia and Indonesia, but I am confident that decent people in both countries will now pause, take stock, and do what is necessary to restore the relationship because despite the difficulties of the last few days, despite the very understandable anger that so many Australians feel, in the end, it is in everyone’s best interests that this relationship can be restored as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
