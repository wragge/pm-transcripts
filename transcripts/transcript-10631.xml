    <content><![CDATA[<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Welcome to Mr John Howard, the Prime Minister of Australia. Mr</p>
<p>   Howard, welcome to the studio.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It's very nice to be here Philip.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>The dollar, it's the story on everyone's lips. I sometimes</p>
<p>   think it's a national sporting event isn't it, as we sort</p>
<p>   of barrack it up or barrack it down. I mean there are two sides</p>
<p>   to every currency story for the dollar going down it helps exporters</p>
<p>   in the country, of course. It's become a national obsession,</p>
<p>   almost a sign of our national well-being whether it's up or</p>
<p>   down. This morning I note Professor Ross Garnaut was commenting</p>
<p>   that the dollar's relationship with the United States dollar</p>
<p>   was overly measured and we should be concerned about what's</p>
<p>   happening to the rest of the world. Are you worried about it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I am obviously following what has happened very carefully.</p>
<p>   The Prime Minister or the Treasurer or, indeed, other senior Ministers</p>
<p>   never comment on the level of the dollar. The comments that Ross</p>
<p>   Garnaut has made is accurate to this extent that it is not just</p>
<p>   the relationship of the Australian dollar to the US dollar but also</p>
<p>   to a whole basket of currencies with which Australia, the countries</p>
<p>   with which Australia trades, and the point I'd make is that</p>
<p>   the fundamentals of the Australian economy are very strong. We have</p>
<p>   very low inflation. We've turned a $10.5 billion budget deficit</p>
<p>   into a surplus of $2.7 billion. We have quite strong business investment.</p>
<p>   We've made a lot of other reforms to improve the competitiveness</p>
<p>   of the Australian economy and when you look around our region the</p>
<p>   things that really count in the medium to longer term are very strong</p>
<p>   in Australia, and they are the sorts of things that in the medium</p>
<p>   to longer term really count.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Are you concerned that in Asia at least the message about the strength</p>
<p>   of the Australian economy, and elsewhere too for that matter, amongst</p>
<p>   currency traders may get mixed up unnecessarily with.......</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I don't really want to get, Philip, into a, and I'm</p>
<p>   not trying to be uncooperative to you, or indeed, to anybody else,</p>
<p>   but it's just not sensible for Prime Ministers to get into</p>
<p>   detailed technical discussions about currency trading. They are</p>
<p>   part of the market system. I am not going to talk about the level</p>
<p>   and I don't think anybody else senior in the Government is</p>
<p>   going to either.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, I was keen to talk to you and I have been for a while</p>
<p>   about issues of Sydney. I want to talk about that, the issues of</p>
<p>   Sydney life. We will return, if you don't mind, a bit later</p>
<p>   to some of the other issues, the Queensland election and so on.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Please do. I'd be surprised if you didn't.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Let's have a talk about Sydney. You are the first Prime Minister,</p>
<p>   for as long as anyone can remember, to make their home in Sydney,</p>
<p>   to live here rather than live in Canberra. </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I really divide my time.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Of course. But those in Canberra, of course, say well that's</p>
<p>   a slight to them. </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well Sydney is part of Australia. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It's not the only part, it's a lovely part of Australia.</p>
<p>   I've lived in Sydney all my life and I am very fond of it as</p>
<p>   a city. I chose to spend more time as part of my family groups with</p>
<p>   my wife and three children in Sydney than in Canberra because that</p>
<p>   seemed to me the overwhelmingly sensible thing to do both from a</p>
<p>   family point of view and also as a means of keeping in touch with</p>
<p>   attitudes and views in the largest city in Australia. Now that's</p>
<p>   not disrespectful to Canberra. I spend, I guess, almost as much</p>
<p>   time, if you measure it by nights spent in particular cities, almost</p>
<p>   as much time in Canberra as I do in Sydney. But my family home is</p>
<p>   in Sydney, it doesn't cost the taxpayer any more and therefore</p>
<p>   it's a sensible arrangement all round. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Is it something you would recommend to future Prime Ministers?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>That's a matter for them. It just depends entirely on where</p>
<p>   they come from. I don't seek to establish it as a norm. It</p>
<p>   just suits me and it hasn't in any way interfered with the</p>
<p>   processes of Government and it hasn't added to expense. I think</p>
<p>   it is an eminently sensible arrangement. Which I might say most</p>
<p>   people around Australia understand.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Can we look at some of the things around Sydney. It's your</p>
<p>   home city, you grew up here, spent your life here, you live here</p>
<p>   as Prime Minister. Can we look at some of the issues around Sydney</p>
<p>   and starting with the Opera House, the most famous building in Sydney,</p>
<p>   the most famous building in Australia, one of the great buildings</p>
<p>   of the world. There are a number of people have been critical, or</p>
<p>   failed to understand why the Federal Government hasn't been</p>
<p>   keen to list the Opera House on the World Heritage list. Why is</p>
<p>   that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I don't think there is any particular reason for or</p>
<p>   against it. I mean, how shall I put it, it's not going to sort</p>
<p>   of alter the status of the Opera House. It is not going to alter</p>
<p>   it as a focal point of tourist attraction. You asked me: Â‘why</p>
<p>   haven't we done it?' It's not because we have any</p>
<p>   less regard for the Opera House. Some people might argue that there's</p>
<p>   a bit of a difference between listing a building like that and listing</p>
<p>   a national park on the World Heritage list. I am not ruling it out</p>
<p>   forever but I guess my answer to that is that you don't automatically</p>
<p>   list every single thing on the World Heritage list.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>But this is not every single thing?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, no, no, but there is an argument for saying that a building</p>
<p>   of that kind is not necessarily something that ought to be listed.</p>
<p>   But I don't rule it out.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>So it might happen?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well as I say, I don't rule it out.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Cabinet has made a decision not to proceed at the moment?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, but things can change.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Would you personally support it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I must say I don't have a strong view about the need</p>
<p>   to do it I must say, but equally it is one of those things you don't</p>
<p>   rule out forever.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>If it was listed on the World Heritage list, of course, it would</p>
<p>   give the Federal Government some control over what happens to the</p>
<p>   building and at the moment they don't.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I realise that but once again if we are to have a Federal system</p>
<p>   of Government in this country we can't sort of have the federation</p>
<p>   of convenience. In other words, if it's convenient to leave</p>
<p>   something to State or Federal responsibility then you do so but</p>
<p>   if it's not you just override the differences between Federal</p>
<p>   and State Government. Now I don't really think that you should</p>
<p>   have a situation in this country where even buildings as great as</p>
<p>   the Opera House, are being effectively run and controlled by the</p>
<p>   Federal Government. I mean it's not owned by the Federal Government,</p>
<p>   it's owned, as I understand it, by a trust. It was originally</p>
<p>   built under the aegis of the then New South Wales Government. It</p>
<p>   was, from recollection, partly funded through special lotteries.</p>
<p>   It was never in its construction phases, and in its concept and</p>
<p>   in its design, it was never a creature of the then Federal Government.</p>
<p>   Now, we have a Federal structure in this country. We might as well,</p>
<p>   while we have it, we might as well use it and - I'm not advocating</p>
<p>   that we should get rid of it incidentally - I think a Federal structure</p>
<p>   is a good structure for a geographically large country. Therefore</p>
<p>   there are some things that are the responsibility of State governments</p>
<p>   and there are some things that are the responsibility of Federal</p>
<p>   governments. And, if State governments get things wrong in their</p>
<p>   area of responsibility they should wear the odium for it but just</p>
<p>   as if a Federal Government gets something wrong in its area of responsibility,</p>
<p>   it should wear the odium for that as well.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>There are some suggestions by some who fail to understand the Government's</p>
<p>   decision that perhaps the Federal Government's concerned that</p>
<p>   it might end up carrying the can for the cost of the Opera House</p>
<p>   whether it be future renovations or additions or whatever.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, some people might argue that, but others may simply take</p>
<p>   the view that this is overwhelmingly something within the sphere</p>
<p>   of responsibility of State governments.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>It kind of leads us inevitably walking back from the Opera House</p>
<p>   down to the East Circular Quay development ...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It's properly called the "Toaster".</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>...doesn't it, which a lot of people in Sydney hate. What</p>
<p>   do you think about it? </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I don't think it's very attractive. But if you are</p>
<p>   saying to me should we find several hundred million dollars to tear</p>
<p>   it down and not spend that several hundred million dollars on needed</p>
<p>   community services say in the western suburbs of Sydney. I would</p>
<p>   find it very hard to stare the people - of say Penrith, or the outer</p>
<p>   western suburbs of Sydney - in the eye and say look it is more important</p>
<p>   that we tear this down and pay for the mistake of a State government,</p>
<p>   and it is the State government's responsibility. I mean, I</p>
<p>   don't want to get necessarily into a sort of....</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>... and now this...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>....you're to blame, I'm not to blame sort of situation.</p>
<p>   I don't want to have that negative tit-for-tat interview, but</p>
<p>   the decision to build it was made by Mr Carr when he was the Minister</p>
<p>   for Planning or whatever in the former Labor government. It is overwhelmingly,</p>
<p>   totally, completely, and comprehensively a State Government responsibility.</p>
<p>   I will carry the responsibility for the Federal sphere of government.</p>
<p>   I will cooperate with the NSW government but to ask us to take $200</p>
<p>   or $300 million or whatever it might be, and there are a whole range</p>
<p>   of estimates, to take that away from something else, say from, I</p>
<p>   mean, we've been told at the same time they want us to put</p>
<p>   money into this, that we've got to put even more money into</p>
<p>   hospitals - take it away from those things, to say to the people</p>
<p>   of the western suburbs of Sydney for example, the battlers out there</p>
<p>   who pay their taxes, we're going to spend several hundred million</p>
<p>   on this, I don't think, much an all as from an aesthetic point</p>
<p>   of view it is an ugly building. There is no doubt about that, it</p>
<p>   is. And it is a pity that the decision was ever made to give it</p>
<p>   planning approval, but in a democracy, governments take decisions</p>
<p>   and they have to, in the end, be accountable for those decisions</p>
<p>   in the bar of public opinion and that is what is happening on this</p>
<p>   issue, and I would find it hard in exercising my responsibilities</p>
<p>   conscientiously to say that making it an undoubtedly pleasing decision</p>
<p>   to many of your listeners and I'm quite certain as I speak</p>
<p>   this morning, many of the people who listen to this programme will</p>
<p>   say "oh gee Prime Minister, or gee John, we'd like you</p>
<p>   to have a different view", because they would like it and in</p>
<p>   a sense I empathise with that personally, but I've got to put</p>
<p>   myself outside that personal view. I mean, I would rather that building</p>
<p>   weren't there as somebody who looks at it on a very regular</p>
<p>   basis.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>It's right across the water from you. Well, actually not quite.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, not entirely no, but as I drive along the Cahill expressway</p>
<p>   and I do that on a very regular basis, of course I as a citizen</p>
<p>   of Sydney would like to see it disappear but I've got to ask</p>
<p>   myself, should I really divert money that I could otherwise spend</p>
<p>   on facilities for people who need them, and heaven knows, no matter</p>
<p>   who is in power, there is always need in society, there's always</p>
<p>   need in a big city. Later on this morning I'm going to go an</p>
<p>   launch a report on youth homelessness, so I am very seized of those</p>
<p>   sorts of responsibilities. I just don't think I can justify</p>
<p>   switching funds from those sorts of things into this.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>So it's ruled out then is it? No federal...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I can't. That is how I feel at the present time. I ....</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Have you had a recent discussion about it with the ....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The Premier and the Lord Mayor want to talk to me about it and</p>
<p>   of course I will talk to them. I will always deal courteously with</p>
<p>   the head of the NSW Government, whoever he or she may be, and the</p>
<p>   Lord Mayor of Sydney. I will talk to them, but you will, and your</p>
<p>   listeners will have gathered from what I've said, how I'm</p>
<p>   thinking at present.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Thinking about your own city and speaking in a personal sense,</p>
<p>   does it distress you that East Circular Quay is symptomatic of planning</p>
<p>   decisions in Sydney, which as you look around there are other examples</p>
<p>   too of things that just should never have been. Does it distress</p>
<p>   you that..</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes it does....</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>That in a city as beautiful as this, that that's the best</p>
<p>   that as a city, as a community that we can come up with?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>As an individual, as a private citizen to the extent that I can</p>
<p>   be one, of course some planning decisions disappoint me, dismay</p>
<p>   me. However planning decisions are often in the eye of the beholder.</p>
<p>   Sydney is a beautiful city. I haven't seen a more beautiful</p>
<p>   city in the world, when you look at its heart and centre, which</p>
<p>   is of course the harbour and all the nooks and crannies that run</p>
<p>   off the harbour, I think it is undoubtedly a stunning city and a</p>
<p>   wonderful place to live, not for everybody, it's tough for</p>
<p>   some people. Like all big cities there are a lot of lonely people</p>
<p>   in Sydney and one of the problems of large city life increasingly</p>
<p>   is that there are more and more people on their own and as a community</p>
<p>   we have to try and find in our mechanisms, in our institutions,</p>
<p>   in our approaches, we've got to find some way of providing</p>
<p>   people in big cities with company. I think it's the most distressing</p>
<p>   thing about city life. There are so many people, not just older</p>
<p>   people, although there are a lot of them in that category but also</p>
<p>   younger people who are very lonely. I mean youth homelessness again,</p>
<p>   if I can return to that subject, is an awful manifestation of individual</p>
<p>   loneliness. But despite all of that, it is, for most of its citizens,</p>
<p>   it's a great place in which to live. I don't like some</p>
<p>   of the planning decisions. I guess there are some that I like that</p>
<p>   others don't.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>There will always be some. My guest is the Prime Minister, Mr Howard.</p>
<p>   It's fourteen to nine. Mr Howard, the Harbour foreshores, an</p>
<p>   issue which I know you had a lot of discussions with your Cabinet</p>
<p>   colleagues too and the Defence Minister, Mr McLachlan, in the past</p>
<p>   as well about this. Has there been a decision made yet......</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We are working towards a final decision on that which will be a</p>
<p>   good decision for, not just the people of Sydney, but the people</p>
<p>   of Australia.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>There is some suggestion that there be a federal trust set up but</p>
<p>   the money available come from the Federation Fund and that.....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>That's one of the suggestions that is around. And one of the</p>
<p>   reasons for that is that if more land is made available for open</p>
<p>   space and therefore for use by the public as a result of moving</p>
<p>   defence installations from one part of the country to the other,</p>
<p>   there is a cost involved in that relocation. And it is legitimate</p>
<p>   to argue that a proper use of the Federation Fund, or part of it,</p>
<p>   would be to underwrite the cost of moving it otherwise you would</p>
<p>   never be able to consider additional open space as part of a Federation</p>
<p>   project.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Can you understand the logic of somebody to say: Â‘hey, what's</p>
<p>   going on, this is Government land which I as a taxpayer am buying</p>
<p>   from myself again, we are just shifting money around'.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I am talking more about the cost of relocating people to one</p>
<p>   part of the country to the other. If you shift defence personnel</p>
<p>   from a harbour foreshore area to North Queensland or to the Northern</p>
<p>   Territory or to Victoria or Western Australia, there is a cost involved</p>
<p>   in that. That's the sort of thing I am talking about. And also</p>
<p>   one of the other proposals that is around is the remediation and</p>
<p>   cleaning up of some of the foreshore assets. Now if that occurs</p>
<p>   there is a cost involved in that and I don't think anybody</p>
<p>   can legitimately argue that that isn't a fair and proper and</p>
<p>   orthodox use of the Federation Fund. We are moving closer to a decision</p>
<p>   on this. There are further discussions that must be undertaken with</p>
<p>   the New South Wales Government. The idea of linking open space on</p>
<p>   the Sydney Harbour foreshores with the Centenary of Federation,</p>
<p>   it does catch my imagination, it catches the imagination of many</p>
<p>   Australians living, not only in and around Sydney, but all around</p>
<p>   the country. It is interesting when we discuss this matter inside</p>
<p>   the Government, without giving away too many Cabinet secrets, many</p>
<p>   of my colleagues from other States almost instantaneously said:</p>
<p>   doing something big about the Harbour foreshores in Sydney would</p>
<p>   be about as appropriate a way to mark the Centenary of Federation</p>
<p>   as a gift to the people of Sydney, or a substantial gift to the</p>
<p>   people of Sydney and the people of Australia as any project they</p>
<p>   could think of. It fired the imagination and interest of colleagues</p>
<p>   from Queensland and South Australia as well as from Sydney.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>I am sure many people would be encouraged by that. The second airport.</p>
<p>   It is one of those issues which, if you are in Canberra, you are</p>
<p>   going to have to deal with over the years. I mean they are rebuilding</p>
<p>   hugely out at Kingsford Smith, there's a heavy rail line going</p>
<p>   in and no-one in their right mind would be looking at that airport</p>
<p>   and thinking well that's going to go away. You go to Badgery's</p>
<p>   Creek nothing is happening at all, is it ever going to be built?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well our policy is to build a second airport at Badgery's</p>
<p>   Creek....</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Still?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, that's still our policy. Subject to, and this is very</p>
<p>   important, the proper processes of an environmental impact statement.</p>
<p>   I mean that is our policy. It's very hard to please - no it's</p>
<p>   not very hard to please everybody on this - it's impossible</p>
<p>   to please everybody on a second airport. If you live near Kingsford</p>
<p>   Smith you naturally want to, it's our policy to keep the curfew.</p>
<p>   You want the noise spread around a bit, and I think we have been</p>
<p>   successful in that, we have achieved a more fair distribution of</p>
<p>   the noise. If you live near Badgery's Creek, you are not too</p>
<p>   thrilled about the idea of a second airport being built there. It</p>
<p>   is very difficult for any government anywhere in the industrialised</p>
<p>   world to build a second airport without there being strong community</p>
<p>   opposition from some or other groups.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Well you are in favour of it you say, well not in favour of it</p>
<p>   but that's your policy, you say but almost nobody else is,</p>
<p>   the councils aren't, the Opposition aren't in favour of</p>
<p>   a new airport.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well the Opposition was in favour of it federally, that was there</p>
<p>   policy.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>And now they are not in favour of it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I don't know, it depends who you speak to.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Beazley certainly said he is not very keen on having it.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well that's not the official position of the Federal Opposition.</p>
<p>   As I understand, the official position of the Federal Opposition,</p>
<p>   I mean they do flip flop on a lot of these things according to whether</p>
<p>   they are in Government or Opposition....</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>They support a second airport for the Sydney basin...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I mean that sort of the 30 year cop-out for the airport problem</p>
<p>   of Sydney. I mean there comes a point where if somebody who claims</p>
<p>   to be an alternative government has got to go a bit further than</p>
<p>   that and say well we support one here.. Now it was a policy of the</p>
<p>   former Government, the Keating Government, to build an airport at</p>
<p>   Badgery's Creek subject to an EIS. That was their policy and</p>
<p>   that is our policy. Now we haven't got the final EIS process</p>
<p>   completed yet and when we do you'll hear more from us but that</p>
<p>   is our position.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Okay, the Olympics.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Are you happy with the way it is being run from a federal point</p>
<p>   of view?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well generally speaking my policy has been to try and avoid any</p>
<p>   kind of political, making any kind of political context out of the</p>
<p>   Olympic Games. It is a great Australian event and it's a tribute</p>
<p>   to the people of Australia and it's a tribute to the city of</p>
<p>   Sydney that the games are coming here and I try and avoid anything</p>
<p>   that suggests that I am sniping at the organisation of it because</p>
<p>   it is something being run by the New South Wales local government.</p>
<p>   As far as I am concerned, I want to cooperate with whoever the Government</p>
<p>   of New South Wales is, and it may be a different government. And</p>
<p>   obviously from a political point of view, I would not be unhappy</p>
<p>   if there were a different Government in New South Wales but I won't</p>
<p>   go into that.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Would you like to open it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I said before I was Leader of the Opposition, about four years</p>
<p>   ago, I was merely the Shadow Minister for Industrial Relations and</p>
<p>   had no real prospect of ever being Opposition Leader, let alone</p>
<p>   Prime Minister. I said that I thought the Prime Minister of the</p>
<p>   day ought to open it whoever that may be. So it's not a question</p>
<p>   of John Howard wanting to open the Olympic Games, it's never</p>
<p>   been a personal pitch.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Yeah, but your view is that the Prime Minister should....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think the Prime Minister of the day, whoever he or she may be,</p>
<p>   ought to open it. That is the appropriate person to do so.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>It's seven to nine. Mr Howard is my guest this morning on</p>
<p>   the Breakfast Show, Wednesday morning the 10th of June. Can we return</p>
<p>   to a few of the other national issues around?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>The rise of One Nation. In retrospect do you think the way you</p>
<p>   handled Pauline Hanson's maiden speech was the right way?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes I do.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>You get a lot of wisdom with hindsight I know.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't think anything would have been different if I'd</p>
<p>   of reacted differently. What needs to be done in relation to this</p>
<p>   issue more than anything else is, the political leaders want to</p>
<p>   listen to and talk to the people who are attracted to her, in my</p>
<p>   view, falling to several groups. The great bulk of the people who</p>
<p>   are attracted to her are people who have been affected by economic</p>
<p>   and social change. They feel vulnerable. Many of them live in rural</p>
<p>   areas of Australia. Many of them are over 50, they've lost</p>
<p>   their jobs or they feel they might lose their jobs and they are</p>
<p>   attracted by simplistic, apparently easy, overnight solutions, and</p>
<p>   they are also sometimes attracted by a view of life that tries to</p>
<p>   blame one or other group for their difficulties. Now what I believe</p>
<p>   one should do is to try and talk to those people. The job of a political</p>
<p>   leader is to enlist support, community support for a set of policies,</p>
<p>   a set of values and a set of attitudes and the last thing that any</p>
<p>   political leader should do is to in a blanket way dismiss a group</p>
<p>   of one's fellow citizens. So what I want to do is to engage</p>
<p>   these people. Now I won't agree with them on a lot of things.</p>
<p>   I might agree with them on some things but I will say to them that</p>
<p>   if you think there is an overnight solution to Australia's</p>
<p>   economic challenges then you are wrong. You can't restore employment</p>
<p>   in the bush, for example, by locking out imports because if we lock</p>
<p>   imports out of Australia other countries will lock out our exports</p>
<p>   and we will end up being a lot worse off.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>If they do take a lot of the Coalition vote away, and some are</p>
<p>   suggesting that they might, if you believe the polls. And we will</p>
<p>   have to see on Saturday whether, of course, that, in fact, in practice</p>
<p>   works out. But if that's the case you are going to be forced</p>
<p>   to end up doing preference deals with them aren't you to get</p>
<p>   the vote back?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p>Well I don't want to talk about preferences in advance of</p>
<p>   the election at the weekend. No doubt, we'll get asked questions</p>
<p>   about that after the weekend whatever the outcome is. The more important</p>
<p>   thing in the long-term is one of communicating with them. You must</p>
<p>   always, as a political leader, listen to what people say and then</p>
<p>   respond. My attitude is that those people who are attracted to One</p>
<p>   Nation because they feel economically vulnerable and because they</p>
<p>   feel as though they are getting a raw deal out of the major parties</p>
<p>   and particularly out of the Coalition because I lead the Coalition.</p>
<p>   I want to talk to them, I want to explain where we stand on some</p>
<p>   of these issues to the extent that I agree with them on some issues</p>
<p>   I will say so, to the extent that I don't, I will also say</p>
<p>   so. Now there are some supporters of One Nation who do so because</p>
<p>   of their attitudes on things like gun control. Now I have to say</p>
<p>   to those people that I am not going to alter my view on gun control.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>It's mad stuff isn't it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well the idea of rolling back the national gun laws is absolutely</p>
<p>   wrong and against the interests of people in the country as well</p>
<p>   as in the city. There are a lot of quiet, strong female supporters,</p>
<p>   in particular, of gun control legislation in the country areas.</p>
<p>   And there are also some people attracted to the party because of</p>
<p>   their attitudes of bigotry and a sense of discrimination against</p>
<p>   sections of the population. Now, I'd have to say to them, and</p>
<p>   I do say to them repeatedly, that I'll have no truck of that.</p>
<p>   This is a tolerant, open community where people are entitled to</p>
<p>   be treated on their merit and on the contribution they make to our</p>
<p>   society without reference to their colour, their race or their religion.</p>
<p>   Now that is an absolute in Australian society but it is very important</p>
<p>   in having said that, not to brand every supporter of the One Nation</p>
<p>   party or, indeed, of any other fringe party as being a bigot or</p>
<p>   a racist. That's not accurate. And if you inaccurately describe</p>
<p>   people or label people, you won't ever engage their attention.</p>
<p>   And if you've got a concern about something and you are trying</p>
<p>   to make it known. And somebody says you are something that you are</p>
<p>   not, you turn off, you don't get engaged. You can't establish</p>
<p>   communication with a person who brands you something that you are</p>
<p>   not.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Tax, Mr Howard. The Housing Industry Association this morning came</p>
<p>   out against a GST so they don't like it, they don't like</p>
<p>   its effect on housing. The longer it bubbles on the more everyone</p>
<p>   thinks you are going to introduce the GST, of course, you never</p>
<p>   said you actually will. I think although you have said you are attracted</p>
<p>   to the idea, when will we see the details?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well quite soon.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>This year?</p>
