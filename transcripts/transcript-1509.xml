FOR PRESS P. M. No. 31/ 1967<br />
SOUTH AUSTRALIAN GAS PIPELINE FINANCING SCHEME<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr. Harold Holt<br />
As a result of discussions that have been going on for some<br />
time between the Commonwealth and the Government of South Australia,<br />
followed by a decision at the Loan Council meeting today, agreement has<br />
been reached between the Commonwealth and South Australia on a scheme<br />
to finance the construction of a pipeline to carry natural gas from Gidgealpa<br />
in the North-East of SQ~ th Australia to Adelaide.<br />
On present estimates, the amount of finance required for<br />
the project is $ 35 million spread over a period extending to mid-1972.<br />
Expenditure will be heavily concentrated in the financial years 1967-68<br />
and 1968-69. South Australia is to arrange semi -governmental borrowings<br />
for the purpose of the pipeline authority which is to be established up to a<br />
total of $ 20 million. The Loan Council agreed today to a special addition of<br />
million being made to the semi -governmental borrowing programme of<br />
South Australia for the period to 1971 -72. The purpose of this is to cover<br />
the proposed borrowings for the pipeline authority.<br />
Over the same period the Commonwealth will make loans<br />
to South Australia to an amount of $ 15 million.<br />
These loans will be repaid by South Australia over the<br />
years 1972-73 to 1979-80G. It is expected that for this purpose finance<br />
will be sought by way of further semi -governmental borrowings by the<br />
pipeline authority.<br />
