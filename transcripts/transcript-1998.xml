FOR PRESSP. M. No. 17,1969<br />
NEW MINISTER FOR AIR<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr John Gort<br />
His Excellency the Governor-General has authorised me<br />
to announce that Mr G. D. Erwinj M. Member for Ballaarat, who<br />
is the Government Whip, will be appointed Minister for Air. He<br />
will be sworn in on Thursday, 13 February.<br />
Mr Erwin's promotion is well earned and he will be a<br />
welcome addition to the Ministry. The new Minister for Air will<br />
also carry out the responsibilities of Leader of the House of<br />
Representatives. The Departmental responsibilities of the previous Leader<br />
of the House of Representatives, Mr Snedden, have been steadily<br />
increasing as evidenced by the record flow of migrants to Australia<br />
aud by the countries with which new migrant agreements have been<br />
made. Because of this, and because of the key importance of<br />
migration to Australia's growth, Mr Snedden' s time needs to be fully<br />
occupied with his portfolio. It will be generally agreed that he has<br />
been a successful and tactful Leader of the House.<br />
Mr Max Fox, the Member for Henty, has been appointed<br />
Government Whip in succession to Mr Erwin.<br />
