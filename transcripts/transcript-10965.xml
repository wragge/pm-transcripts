<p>Well thank you very much John. Thank you very much Bob. To the</p>
<p>   Consul General for Italy in Sydney, to Peter Collins, the Leader</p>
<p>   of the Opposition in NSW, to my very good colleague and friend,</p>
<p>   Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel, Bronwyn Bishop.</p>
<p>   And I've only allocated myself three or four minutes because</p>
<p>   I don't believe in long speeches at these gatherings so I won't</p>
<p>   welcome all the other dignitaries but simply say friends all.</p>
<p>And I start by saying what an absolutely fantastic military band</p>
<p>   that was. And whoever organised it deserves the credit and thanks</p>
<p>   of us all. Ladies and gentlemen, as many of you know this is not</p>
<p>   the first Italian National Day celebration that I have had the privilege</p>
<p>   of addressing. And it is for me an immense pleasure as Prime Minister</p>
<p>   of our great country to express on behalf of all of your fellow</p>
<p>   Australians our simple and deep gratitude to the Australians of</p>
<p>   Italian desent for all that you have given to our country over such</p>
<p>   a long period of time.</p>
<p>More than a billion people have left different parts of Italy,</p>
<p>   most of them over the last half a century to come and make their</p>
<p>   home in Australia. And they have brought their values, they have</p>
<p>   brought their passion, they've brought their commitment, they've</p>
<p>   brought their brains, they've brought their song, they've</p>
<p>   brought their laughter, they've brought all of their emotions</p>
<p>   and they have contributed to every part of Australian life. Wherever</p>
<p>   you go, be it in politics, be it in business, be it in medicine,</p>
<p>   be it in the other professions, be it in the arts, be it in business,</p>
<p>   you find Australians of Italian desent. And you find, if you look</p>
<p>   back over the last 50 years, a very special way in which Italians</p>
<p>   have changed for the better the way of life in our country. And</p>
<p>   I thank you for that.</p>
<p>I think Australia has done better than any other country on earth</p>
<p>   in bringing together people of different ethnic and cultural and</p>
<p>   linguistic backgrounds and producing a unified cohesive blend yet</p>
<p>   allowing each individual part of that process to preserve a special</p>
<p>   affection and love of the country of their birth and the country</p>
<p>   of their cultural heritage. And one of the most moving experiences</p>
<p>   I have as Prime Minister, wherever I go in Australia is to come</p>
<p>   across men and women who have come from Italy, many of them 30 or</p>
<p>   40 years ago and they speak with pride and love and emotion of what</p>
<p>   it meant to come to Australia but they also retain a very fierce</p>
<p>   and understandable pride and love for the country of their birth.</p>
<p>   And it really does make me feel immensely proud and humble as Prime</p>
<p>   Minister of this country that we've been able to receive people</p>
<p>   who have given so much to Australia and if they feel consistent</p>
<p>   with that and at ease with that love of Australia, a great retentive</p>
<p>   love for the country of their birth. And I think that's something</p>
<p>   that all of us should feel particular pride in.</p>
<p>I know, ladies and gentlemen, that at this time there are many</p>
<p>   of us who feel sorrow and sadness that the mudslide tragedy in the</p>
<p>   Campania area of Italy and I know that the Consul General's</p>
<p>   spoken for all of us in making a reference to that.</p>
<p>Can I say two other things and that is that I want to honour the</p>
<p>   modern contribution of the Italian Republic to the family of the</p>
<p>   world. Many of us not only know that Italian desent look with great</p>
<p>   pride on the economic and social success and development of Italy</p>
<p>   particularly over the last 20 or 30 years. Italy has a great and</p>
<p>   beneficial influence particularly, but not only, on the family of</p>
<p>   Europe and in the wider council of the world Italy is greatly and</p>
<p>   justifiably respected.</p>
<p>And finally can I say to you that I am about to initiate arrangements</p>
<p>   that will lead to a formal invitation to his excellency the President</p>
<p>   of the Italian Republic, Signor Scalfaro to visit Australia</p>
<p>   at the end of the year.</p>
<p>So to all of you my friends, thank you for what you have done for</p>
<p>   Australia. Go on being part of this great nation of ours and thank</p>
<p>   you very warmly for having me with you. Thank you.</p>
