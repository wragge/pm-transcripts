    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Turnbull and Berejiklian governments and eight Western Sydney councils have today agreed a landmark Western Sydney City Deal - a co-ordinated plan designed to deliver long-term prosperity for the region.</p>
<p>This deal will deliver for Western Sydney:</p>
<ul><li>A North South Rail Link from St Marys to Badgerys Creek Aerotropolis via Western Sydney Airport</li>
<li>A world-class Aerotropolis including Commonwealth-owned land at North Bringelly</li>
<li>An Investment Attraction Office to attract investment to the Western Parkland City</li>
<li>New planning regime for Western Sydney to cut development costs and boost housing supply</li>
<li>A $150m Western Parkland City Liveability Program to deliver community facilities</li>
<li>New STEM-focussed education facilities to train skilled workers needed for the Aerotropolis</li>
<li>A plan to embed smart digital technology in the Western City</li>
</ul><p style="margin-left:11.0pt;"><strong>Rail</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left:11.0pt;">The Turnbull and Berejiklian Governments have jointly committed to the first stage of the North South Rail Link from St Marys to Badgerys Creek Aerotropolis via Western Sydney Airport.</p>
<p style="margin-left:11.0pt;">The Turnbull and Berejiklian Governments have a joint objective of having rail connected to the Western Sydney Airport in time for the opening of the airport.</p>
<p style="margin-left:11.0pt;">The two governments have agreed that they will construct the North South Rail Link as equal partners, each contributing 50 per cent of the funding.</p>
<p style="margin-left:11.0pt;">Both governments will each commit $50 million for a business case on the full North South rail line to finalise a route and station locations, building on the evidence base of the joint Rail Needs Scoping Study, also released today. A market sounding process will test private sector interest in station developments and explore innovative financing solutions.</p>
<p style="margin-left:11.0pt;">The North South rail line will help shape Western Sydney’s growth and support thousands of new jobs and homes for Western Sydney. It delivers on our commitment to build the Western Parkland City into Sydney’s third economic centre, adding much-needed rail capacity that will improve access to employment, education and services, including at the new Badgerys Creek Aerotropolis.</p>
<p style="margin-left:11.0pt;">The NSW Government will also establish rapid bus services from the metropolitan centres of Penrith, Liverpool and Campbelltown to the Badgerys Creek Aerotropolis and to Western Sydney Airport before it opens.</p>
<p style="margin-left:11.0pt;"><strong>Aerotropolis</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left:11.0pt;">The parties commit to delivering a world-class Badgerys Creek Aerotropolis to become Western Sydney’s advanced manufacturing, research, medical, education and commercial hub, benefiting from access to the Western Sydney Airport.</p>
<p style="margin-left:11.0pt;">This will drive new investment and attract high value jobs to the region. Land owned by the Commonwealth at North Bringelly will form part of the Aerotropolis.</p>
<p style="margin-left:11.0pt;">To enable development of the Aerotropolis an Aerotropolis Development Authority will be established with NSW and Commonwealth representation on the board.</p>
<p style="margin-left:11.0pt;"><strong>Investment Attraction</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left:11.0pt;">The NSW Government will establish an Investment Attraction office to coordinate the attraction of national and international investment to the Western Parkland City and the Badgerys Creek Aerotropolis. The Investment Attraction Office will be located in Liverpool.</p>
<p style="margin-left:11.0pt;"><strong>Planning</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left:11.0pt;">There will be a new streamlined planning regime for Western Sydney, to be led by councils through a new Planning Partnership.  Accelerated planning and uniform standards will reduce cost for development, boost housing supply and protect airport operations.</p>
<p style="margin-left:11.0pt;"><strong>Liveability</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left:11.0pt;">A new Western Parkland City Liveability Program will provide grant funding to local governments to deliver community facilities and amenities that will enable new housing supply. The Turnbull and Berejiklian Governments will each contribute $60m and local councils will contribute $30m.</p>
<p style="margin-left:11.0pt;"><strong>Education</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left:11.0pt;">New STEM-focussed secondary, vocational and tertiary education facilities will be established around Western Sydney Airport to train the skilled workers needed for the high-tech sectors to be established at the Aerotropolis, as well as to construct the airport and other major projects.</p>
<p style="margin-left:11.0pt;"><strong>Technology</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left:11.0pt;">A 5G strategy for the Western City will be developed, with plans to implement a trial to be led by a telecommunications carrier.</p>
<p style="margin-left:11.0pt;"><strong>Agribusiness Precinct </strong></p>
<p style="margin-left:11.0pt;">The NSW Government will commission a feasibility study into an agribusiness precinct for the Western Parkland City.</p>
<p style="margin-left:11.0pt;">These City Deal commitments will help realise the aspiration of a 30-minute city for Western Sydney, bringing people closer to jobs, education and services to ensure this growing region, its economy and its residents thrive.</p>
<p style="margin-left:11.0pt;">The City Deal sets out a comprehensive plan to seize the once-in-a-generation opportunity created by the Turnbull Government’s delivery of the $5.3 billion Western Sydney Airport. It will ensure that the people of Western Sydney see clear and tangible benefits as Western Sydney develops into an economic powerhouse.</p>
<p style="margin-left:11.0pt;">This landmark deal will deliver investment, transport and jobs for Western Sydney.</p>
<p style="margin-left:11.0pt;">The Western Sydney City Deal is a ground-breaking partnership between the Turnbull and Berejiklian Governments and local governments of Camden, Campbelltown, Liverpool, Penrith, Wollondilly, the Blue Mountains, Hawkesbury and Fairfield.</p>
