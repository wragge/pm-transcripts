PRIME MINISTER
E. O. E. -PROOF ONLY<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF PRIME MINISTER ON BBC WORLD AT ONE<br />
JOURNALIST:.........( inaudible) South fr ica could well become the<br />
major issue at the Commonwealth con erence. We reckon it will be<br />
the dominating issue.<br />
PM: I would think it would be.<br />
JOURNALIST: Nothing else can really match this in importance?<br />
PM: I wouldn't have thought so. This doesn't mean that there<br />
are not other important issues. Obviously the questions of<br />
international economic concern and the developing trends towards<br />
increasing proctectionism around the world by any standards of<br />
relevant judgment, those are important issues. But I adhere to<br />
my first observation, I believe that this issue that you mention<br />
will be the dominant one.-<br />
JOURNALIST: You have already imposed some fairly limited sanctions.<br />
You have closed down your Trade Commission offLice and you have<br />
banned the export of petroleum products and so on. Do you think tLhe<br />
Commonwealth countries generally will be looking for a much tougher<br />
package of sanctions?<br />
PM: I would think that the Commonwealth Heads of Government will<br />
be a approaching it in this way. Firstly, that we would all, I<br />
believe, rather see the obscenity of apartheid come to an end as<br />
a result'of a realisation on the part of the South African regime<br />
that they must take action to bring about this result. Speaking<br />
for myself, and I would think that this would be the view of<br />
other Commonwealth countries, rather than South Africa being<br />
forced to that position by the application of general economic<br />
sanctions. It would be more preferable if they would understand<br />
the growing force of world opinion. So speaking for myself, we<br />
will be doing two things. We will certainly be urging the<br />
Commonwealth to prepare itself and to take to the United Nations<br />
a position in favour of widespread mandatory sanctions. But at<br />
the same time as doing that to develop a set of proposals to put<br />
to the Sout~ h African regime requesting them to take observable<br />
and meaningful action according to an acceptable timetable to<br />
produce a result that will indicate their intention to abolish<br />
apartheid. Now in that sense it is a two pronged approach. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: I think everybody would agree with you. It would be far<br />
better to see South Africa changing of its own free will but it<br />
doesn't seem to be in Mr Botha's mind the wish to make the statement<br />
of intent that Chief Buthelezi says is necessary, that Bishop Tutu<br />
says is necessary, that Oliver Tambo above all says is necessary.<br />
Has there been any sign, do you think, that the limited sanctions<br />
that you and other countries have imposed, the EEC countries also,<br />
have had any effect in persuading Mr Botha that the time has come to<br />
change his mind?<br />
PM: Well, you have to look at indirect effect as well as direct and<br />
I think you would have to say that the growth in not merely feeling<br />
around the world but also the growth in the indication of the<br />
preparedness to take action including the more recent position of<br />
the United States has had an impact upon the business community within<br />
South Africa. They have now done specifically two things. They have<br />
met with the ANC and they have also within South Africa by public<br />
advertisement made their position clear that fundamental<br />
changes must be made. Now I believe that one can attribute that change<br />
of position and demonstrable change of position on the part of South<br />
African business to a reaction on their part to what is being said<br />
and done in the rest of the world. That in turn, it seems to me, must<br />
begin to have some impact upon the South African regime.<br />
JOURNALIST: Well Sonny Ramphal was talking about the possibility of<br />
things like an end to international air links with South Africa,<br />
a ban on the import in Commonwealth countries of South African<br />
agriculture products generally and that kind of thing. Do you think<br />
that it can come to that or do you have to go further to a general<br />
trade embargo?<br />
PM: Well I in a sense go back to the previous answer I gave. The<br />
Commonwealth can move to a statement that it's prepared to do those<br />
sorts of things. I think it will need not only to come to that sort<br />
of decision itself but on that basis go into the United Nations<br />
and seek the support of non-Commonwealth countries because you will<br />
appreciate if you look at the composition of South African trade that<br />
that is effected very largely by a number of non-Commonwealth countries<br />
as well as Britain. So I think you need the two stages, the Commonw, ea lth<br />
and the United Nations but I still make the point that one would hope<br />
that on the basis of an indication that the world is prepared to move<br />
in this way, the South African regime would come to its senses and<br />
realise it is infinitely better that it should take action itself.<br />
JOURNALIST: Yes, but if it doesn't and you have to go to the United<br />
Nations PM: If it doesn't, of course, the world in our judgment should be<br />
prepared to take this action.<br />
JOURNALIST: But it looks rather as if you have to go to the United<br />
Nations and look for mandatory sanctions, as if Britain will stand out<br />
against and will veto and so on and so forth. The Prime Minister and<br />
Foreign Secretary have made it very plain that they don't believe that<br />
ecoflnaCm sanctions crc the </p>
<p>PM: Could I just make this point th at Britain may have to come to<br />
thp realisation that we live in 1985 Britannia no longer rules the I<br />
JOURNALIST: And do you think that if Britain persists in their present<br />
position at the Commonwealth conference that the British govern ment<br />
is going to be isolated?<br />
PM: I believe so.<br />
JOURNALIST: And what effect would that have on the Commonwealth if<br />
Britain were to be isolated......<br />
PM: Well we all attach the utmost importance to our links with<br />
Britain, after all so much of our structures sprang from there. The<br />
Commonwealth's future existence does not depend upon a situation where<br />
we have to have the agreement of Britain to every decision that we<br />
in the rest of the Commonwealth believe is demanded by the morality<br />
of the situation. Now it is an unfortunate fact, unavoidable, that<br />
the decision and the attitude of the British attitude is determined<br />
to a very considerable extent by its perception of its economic<br />
interests in terms of the very substantial investment it has in<br />
South Africa. I can understand its concern about these matters but it<br />
is my firm view and I believe it will be the firm view of the<br />
overwhelming majority of those represented at the Commonwealth.<br />
We are here dealing with issues which transcend an assessment of a<br />
commercial balance sheet.<br />
JOURNALIST: What about your own problems with South African,<br />
Prime Minister, what is the position at the moment about this<br />
unofficial rebel cricket tour that is supposed to be going?<br />
PM: Well unfortunately the position at the moment seems to be that<br />
they intend to go ahead. I and my Government couldn't have done more<br />
publicly within Australia to indicate our rejection of this concept.<br />
We, however, do not follow a policy here of refusing passports.<br />
If they go they know they will be going without the support of the<br />
Australian Government. They know they will be going against our<br />
commitment under the Gleneagles Agreement. We could not have done<br />
more to make our position clear on this issue.<br />
JOURNALIST: Well you have, as you call use of the<br />
shameful. One would expect the players who go to suffer the same kind<br />
of punishment as the-British players who went.<br />
PM: Well the Australian Cricket Board of control here has made it<br />
clear that there will be sanctions, if I can use that word in this<br />
context, imposed upon the players. They will not be able to<br />
represent their country for a number of years and within the States<br />
and even at the level beneath that actions have been taken. So they<br />
will be paying a price. Unfortunately, at this stage, it seems a price<br />
they are prepared to pay.<br />
JOURNALIST: As you say, it will be directly against the Gleneagles<br />
Agreement. Do you think that if it goes ahead the Commonwealth Ga-ec<br />
2 fl next. v~ n~ 2rcc' morej~. c~: t<br />
a Ir ca dv a r? </p>
<p>4. I<br />
PM: Not because of our rebel tour, because the African countries<br />
have been fulisome in their acknowledgement of the appropriateness<br />
of the position of my Governmient.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister I wonder if we could talk for a little<br />
now about the ANZUS Treaty?<br />
PM: Certainly.<br />
JOURNALIST: Which you say or were saying in March exists in name<br />
only. Does it exist in anything more than that now?<br />
PM: As far as the Unitej1 States and Australia is concerned it, of<br />
course, does. Our relationship under the ANZUS Treaty continues<br />
as fully and as effectively as they always have. It is the case, of<br />
course, that as far as the relationship between the United States<br />
and New Zealand under the Treaty that that relationship has been<br />
very very substantially diminished.<br />
JOURNALIST: But it does sound, therefore, as if you are talking more<br />
now about, if I may say so, an AUS Treaty than an ANZUS Treaty. Do you<br />
think New Zealand can be persuaded to come back in?<br />
PM: At the moment, the position of the New Zealand Government in<br />
regard to the visits of the United States' ships which may be nuclear<br />
capable stands as a barrier to the participation of New Zealand in<br />
the ANZUS Treaty. That is the case and I cannot say on the evidence<br />
available to me that the New Zealand Government appears to be about<br />
to change their position on that matter. So while they maintain that<br />
position then there is, as far as the United States and New Zealand<br />
is concerned, a stalemate.<br />
JOURNALIST: Now that sounds very much as if you would like New Zealand<br />
to reverse the decision<br />
PM: Well, let me make the position clear. We said to the New Zealand<br />
Government soon after their election what our position was. We said<br />
that we regard ANZUS as of fundamental importance to Australia,<br />
that we accept as a significant and unavoidable, and appropriate<br />
part of that ANZUS relationship, the right of the ships of our<br />
American ally to visit Australiarnports. That's our position. We<br />
explained it to the New Zealanders. We said to them and we said to<br />
the Americans we are not going to be here to tell an independent<br />
sovereign nation New Zealand what its policy should be. We~ have<br />
a policy which is different from theirs. We will adhere to ours.<br />
It is their business as to what they do.<br />
JOURNALIST: I wonder if you could clarify my thought on one thing then.<br />
Just under a couple of years ago the British ship ' Invincible' wasn't<br />
allowed to come into an Australian port to repair because there was<br />
some doubt as to whether she was carrying nuclear weapons and the<br />
British Government wouldn't say ' y.' or ' nay' on it. What is the<br />
Australian position now if there<br />
PM: The position is quite clear. Firstly, in regard to vessels fr=-<br />
aL1~ LC' LY~.' i<br />
dry-docking raised a different consideration because it m-ayv . w\<br />
the off-loading in those circumstances of nuclear capacities. . o<br />
we made it quite clear at the time that in regard to hypothetical<br />
situations into the future, we would, of course, do nothing to<br />
endanger the safety of the vessel and those upon it. We would deal. </p>
<p>with such a circumstance, if it were to arise in the future, on<br />
a case by case basis with a clear understanding that we would not<br />
do anything to endanger the vessel or the lives of those upon it.<br />
We are not dealing with a day to day occurrence. When that situation<br />
arose as I recall was the first time that had for tens of years.<br />
So it is not appropriate to in any sense speculate beyond what I<br />
have just said there in regard to what is an entirely hypothetical<br />
situation other than to repeat the two things that I have said.<br />
One, that the normal operations of vessels of the Royal Navy will<br />
continue to be one of accommodation by us.. ipi our ports when they<br />
visit. The hypothetical situation of themi ' wry-docking facilities<br />
in the case of some emergency we have stated our policy on that<br />
which I have repeated to you.<br />
JOURNALIST: What about the hypothetical consideration of an American<br />
Navy ship which might be nuclear needing dry-docking?<br />
PM: Well, the hypothetical situation would be handled by exactly<br />
the same formula that I pu. t to you. I have discovered in a long period<br />
of public life, and my grandmother warned me don't spend too much<br />
time worrying about hypothetical situations.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, it is clear that David Lange in New<br />
Zealand would dearly love for the whole area including Australia and<br />
New Zealand and the South Pacific generally to be a nuclear-free area.<br />
Have you any sympathy with that ambition?<br />
PM: Well you really should catch up with events a bit more. There is<br />
such a thing as the South Pacific Nuclearij'ree Zone4 ~ tis not<br />
David Lange but a fellow called Bob HawkeAinitiatedA.&amp; e South Pacific<br />
Forum meeting here in Canberra in July of 1983. As a result of the<br />
initiative that I took then, just a few weeks ago in Raratonga eight<br />
nations signed that South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone and the ninth,<br />
Papua New Guinea, signed it just three weekends ago when I was in<br />
Port Moresby.<br />
JOURNALIST: In that case, what about Australian/ French relations,<br />
in view of Francds determination to carry on with testing in<br />
Mururoa Atoll?<br />
PM: We came to Government in March of 1983. I had the pleasure of<br />
meeting President Mitterand in June of 1983 in Paris. I conveyed<br />
directly to him the opposition of my Government and the overwhelming<br />
majority of the Australian people at the continuation of French<br />
nuclear testing in the Pacific. We have continued to put that position<br />
to them, we will continue to do it.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is there anything more at all though. You can protest<br />
and protest and protest but President Mitter'and seems to be unconvinced<br />
by the protest.<br />
PM: Well , thbt Is the thing frmPeietMteadWe don't contemplate<br />
the blowing up of any vessels in any of his harbours.<br />
JOURNALIST: Going onto another topic, do you expect the Commonwealth<br />
conference, which as you say will be mainly dominated by san~ ctions,<br />
to be considering the Gorbachc'. 7/ T~ ea-i sum ltdi' x'at raaLcrs o-.<br />
defence might be raised there? </p>
<p>6.<br />
PM: I would think in the considerations that are given by the<br />
heads of government to the general internatio! situation that there<br />
would be some consideration of the issues likely to arise at that<br />
summit meeting. And certainly the areas of concern to Commonwealth<br />
countries and, of course, nothing is more important to us than that<br />
the reduction of armaments in the world generally and,
nuclear in particular. They.. ave an enormous obligation or<br />
responsibility resting upon~ and I would imagine without presuming<br />
in advance to pre-empt what the decision of the CHOGM conference<br />
would bep I would be very surprised if out of the communique there<br />
did not come paragraphs which expressed the hope of the Commonwealth<br />
countries directed to leaders of the super powers that they should<br />
bend their best endeavours to producing that result.<br />
JOURNALIST: The Commonwealth is a very loose and very desperate<br />
collection of States and widely spread. Is it, do you think, still<br />
an important factor in world affairs?<br />
PM: Yes, I believe it is. I think at all levels of political<br />
activity it is very salutary that you never overstate significance<br />
and importance and certainly therefore as far as Australia is<br />
concerned while we believe we have a worthwhile and significant<br />
contribution to make to the affairs of the region and also generally<br />
in the international sphere, we don't delude ourselves that we have<br />
capacities and influence beyond those that, in fact, we have. Now<br />
I think that sort of salutory reminder that we always give ourselves<br />
is one that the Commonwealth should also give itself. But nevertheless<br />
when you are talking about the Commonwealth you are talking about<br />
a very large number of nations representing a very significant<br />
proportion of the world's population. And I think we are able to take<br />
positions, do things to some extent which can be helpful in producing<br />
better more equitable resolutions to problems. For instance, I think<br />
in regard to our last meeting in 1983 we were able, in regard to the<br />
Grenada question, to play a useful conciliatory role that had some<br />
effect there. In regard to the 1985 CHOGM, I believe, I certainly<br />
hope that the sorts of things that we will be able -say constructively<br />
as well as in terms of looking at developing sanctions possibly,<br />
that what we will be able to say and do in regard to South Africa<br />
will be useful in giving a lead to the rest of the world.<br />
JOURNALIST: It certainly seems that the black and white Comrmonwealth<br />
generally is going to be in Iway more cohesive on the issue of sanctions<br />
than it has been on pretty well anything else for quite a long time.<br />
Do you see at the end of this conference that the Commonwealth could<br />
be seen as even more strong, with Britain as it were,, painted into a<br />
corner? PM: Well I certainly am not going to CHOGM on the basis of Itrying to<br />
paint Britain into a corner. That is neither politically sensible<br />
nor in terms of achieving results a very sensi ble to do. But I will,<br />
for one, be about trying to explain to the meeting-and if that means<br />
particularly to Britain, therefore let it be so to Britain, that<br />
there are certain moral considerations here which I believe transcelld<br />
everything else. And that a proper analysis and consideration of thosrc<br />
1~ c 3i: t, o~ : icvc rta.'. c-ncll.. O. si M Y. 2<br />
woulQ lead Britain to see tnat in thosc ~ n: isi<br />
the whole of the rest of the Commonwealth is right and that they ar<br />
not right on this issue. I mean, it would be quite remarkabl" if<br />
you had a situation in the Commonwealth where everyone else had a </p>
<p>7.<br />
particular point of view and Britain had another. It would be a<br />
pretty remarkable exercise in logic to think that everyone else<br />
was wrong and that they were right.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, thank you very much indeed.<br />
PM: Thank you very much. </p>
