TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP PARLIAMENT HOUSE 22 DECEMBER 1986<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, can we talk to you for a moment or<br />
two about the cricket?<br />
PM: Why not?<br />
JOURNALIST: All the fortunes for a great day tomorrow.<br />
PM: Yes indeed.<br />
JOURNALIST: And we should be flattered I guess that the English<br />
have picked something like a full strength side?<br />
PM: well, that is not entirely an accident. I told them they<br />
would be deported if they didn't.<br />
JOURNALIST: And we gather that a bit of Prime ministerial muscle<br />
has been brought to bear in the selection of Ian Botham tomorrow?<br />
PM: Well, I just told Ian that I am sure he enjoyed his time out<br />
here and that if he wanted to stay for the remainder of the tour<br />
that he and the selectors had better make sure he was playing and<br />
they have done that. But seriously I am very glad that Ian and<br />
David Gower and Mike Gatting are playing because this is a very<br />
important match for many reasons. Important for all the young<br />
fellows that I have chosen. They want to feel that they are<br />
playing against the best side. It is important for Australian<br />
cricket that we have the opportunity of seeing whether these<br />
young fellows have got what it takes. I am sure they have. It is<br />
just a question of whether they show it tomorrow. And also from<br />
the Englishmen's point of view in the lead up to the next test it<br />
is important for them. And then finally and very importantly for<br />
the people of the ACT and this region it has become a very<br />
important fixture. we have been fortunate for the first two games<br />
in 84 and 85 with the West Indies. We had two great games there.<br />
Unfortunately the last one against New Zealand was washed out and<br />
so I was very keen that this be a good game so that the people<br />
who did miss out last time get their moneys worth in 1986.<br />
JOURNALIST: The weather looks absolutely superb.<br />
PM: It is working out great.<br />
JOURNALIST: We do hear that ticket sales are a wee bit-down.<br />
Any message for employers tomorrow?<br />
PM: I am sure it should be a full house by the time it starts<br />
tomorrow.<br />
