PRIME MINISTER<br />
ADDRESS BY THE PLUME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP,<br />
TO THE NEW SOUTH WALES AUSTRALIA DAY COUNCIL LUNCH,<br />
JANUARY 1993, DARLING HARBOUR CONVENTION CENTRE<br />
I am very glad to be here, and particularly to welcome our guests from overseas.<br />
This very large gathering is a measure both of your patriotism and your support for<br />
A'd ney~ O01" ic bid.<br />
For it is an Australia Day celebration and a great sporting occasion.<br />
There is nothing unusual about that of course. Sport and patriotism have long been<br />
virtually synonymous in Australia, and any Prli i-mMinister who does not know his sport<br />
cannot expect to lead a happy life for long.<br />
I won't boast. I will let my record this year speak for itself: I have addressed audiences<br />
drawn from a wide and eccentric range of sports, including Australian Rules Football, and<br />
I did it without causing the slightest embarrassment to anyone.<br />
In fact Alan Border and Richie Richardson seemed genuinely startled by my knowledge of<br />
cricket perhaps because they had adin the English press that I was Irish.<br />
The fact remains that if Australians cannot bc fairly described as sports-mad, they most<br />
certainly can be unfairly described that way.<br />
For our overseas guests I should perhaps explain that our avid devotion to sport is believed<br />
to derive from a long and intense contest with nature.<br />
In the pioneering phase of our national life we were in perpetual competition with the<br />
elements, and it is said that this translated culturally into an almost universal admiration<br />
for physical prowess.<br />
It is also said that our fascination with gambling has its origins in the game of chance<br />
which the duel with nature always is.<br />
That is how the story goes. In the great enpty spaces in Australia, men and women and<br />
children had room to run and jump, and race their horscs, and kick balls around and<br />
between gum-trees, and throw bags of wheat over fences and buildings. </p>

It was a physical culture and, of course, a healthy one which made our athletes all the<br />
more formidable.<br />
It is also suspected that our urge to compete derived in part from our status at first as a<br />
colony, and then as a somewhat subordinate partner in the British Empire.<br />
Such peoples thc New Zealanders provide another example are generally determined<br />
to prove themsclves on playing fields. And battlefields. And throughout this century<br />
Australians did just that,<br />
Down here at the bottom of the world we're susceptible to feelings of inadequacy and<br />
neglect. It is important to raise our self-esteem by beating the best in thc world.<br />
So we have always made a great deal of what we do best: and it has long been said that<br />
what we do bcst is sport.<br />
That there is still some truth in this is undeniable.<br />
Last year we watched with great pride as, in Barcelona, Australian athlctes won a swag of<br />
medals quite out of proportion to the size of our population. But we reckoned it was about<br />
the right number.<br />
In the previous three or four Olympics we thought we did adequately when we did as well<br />
or better than othcr comparable countrics.<br />
In sport we expect nothing less than to be above the avcrage.<br />
There were other sporting triumphs, the rugby union team among them. Like all other<br />
Prime Ministers before me, I could stand here on Australia Day 1993 and read out a long<br />
list of our sporting succcsscs in the past twelve months.<br />
But I won't do that.<br />
Instead let me mention a few other medals won by Australians in the past year. Medals<br />
and awards in fields of endeavour for which we are less well known in the world. Fields<br />
in which usually we have taken somewhat less pride than wc might.<br />
But year after year Australian artists writcrs, dancers, musicians, film makers, actors<br />
take on thc world and win.<br />
Last year, for instance, a young Australian ballet danicer, Simone Goldsmith, won the gold<br />
medal at the Royal Academy of Dance Gence Awards in London.<br />
Another Australiani, Holly Smart, won it the year beforc. In fact Australians took all gold,<br />
silvcr and bronze miedals in both years.<br />
Last year a 26 year old Australian viol inist, Ben Lea, became one of the very few<br />
forcigners to be appointed to wvhat many, people will tell you is the greatest orchestra in<br />
the world the Vienna Philharmonic. Bcn's twin brother, Toby, is principal solo viola<br />
with La Scala.<br />
Last year an Australian, Jackie Farkas, won thc world's laT~ est prize of $ 250,000 for a<br />
student film at the International Cincma Students Festival in Tokyo. While another<br />
young Australian, Stavros Efthymiou was naincd Young Film-maker of the Year at the<br />
Edinburgh Film Festival. TEL </p>
<p>TEL .3<br />
In the United States, Judy Davis won a Golden Globe Award, the Los Angeles Film<br />
Critics Award and the National Board of Review Award for best supporting actres.<br />
And last year a young Australian, Baz Luhrrnann, won the Prix de la Jeunesse at the<br />
Cannes Film Festival for his film Strictly Ballroom.<br />
Strictly Ballroom won a number of other prizes and many standing ovations around<br />
the world. It also won thcrm here. And it was a huge box office success.<br />
That, perhaps, is the most important thing not how much we impressed the world, but<br />
the degree to which with our music, literature, opera, theatre, dance and sport we<br />
inspired and amused ourselves.<br />
I think all Australians should see Strictly Ballroom, including Australians who prefer sport<br />
to art.<br />
They will like it if only because Strictly Ballroomn is about competition, and sport the<br />
most eccentric of sports ballroom dancing.<br />
It is also about all those pioncering virtues of perseverance, and faith, and hope, and rising<br />
above adversity.<br />
The film is about thc need for things to change, the triumph of youth over age, of freedom<br />
and self-expression over stifling conservatism, and of course the triumph of truth and<br />
justice over villainy.<br />
It reminds me of my own life, fighting those conservatives.<br />
" Strictly Ballroom" is a film for our times. Or any other timcs.<br />
It is an Australian fairy talc, both on the Screen and off it. The making of Strictly<br />
Ballroom required those same virtucs of perseverance and courage as the film describes.<br />
It is one of the curious things about patriotism that we all take credit for the success of a<br />
few remarkable individuals. When our athletes won at Barelona we would say that " we"<br />
won them.<br />
When our artists perform brilliantly overseas we say that they are " ours".<br />
Of course, we didn't win those medals. Our athletes did. And it was not our talent or our<br />
perseverance which got their success in Barcelona or in Vienna.<br />
Yet we did wvin. We won in the sensc that their triumphs strengthen our faith in Ourselves.<br />
We also won in that their success was in some measure a return on the kind of society we<br />
have ceated here. A society which does not stifle hope or excellence, but encourages it:<br />
encourages it through the creation of institutions like the Australian Institute of<br />
Sport, the National Institute of Dramatic Art, or the Australian Film and Television<br />
school.<br />
encourages it through a comnmitnmcnt to cquality of opportunity. T2EL5: . Jan. 93 12: 09 No. 006 P. 03/ 06 </p>

encourages it through commitment to the principles of cultural pluralism which we<br />
have followed in the past 20 years. For while Strictly Ballroom is unambiguously<br />
Australian, the cast and crew and themes of the film arc nothing if not<br />
multicultural.<br />
T'here will, no doubt, be people here who say that we do not do enough to encourage<br />
excellence. There will be some who say we do not do enough to raise the level of<br />
equality. I can only say we do our best by both, and most Australians are agreed that this is at least<br />
the proper ambition.<br />
So I'm inclincd to think that, so long as we foster talent and ambition, when Australian<br />
athletes or artists win we have a right to say that " we" won too.<br />
And, ladies and gcntlcmen, I would also say that if today we considered what all of us<br />
have achieved in recent years, we might begin to feel even morc pride in ourselves.<br />
Becausc what Australians have been engaged in for the past few years, and what will<br />
engage us for the rest of this dccade, is a contest at least as great as our forebears' contest<br />
with nature, and much greater than anything which happens on a sporting field.<br />
It is a contcst, in one sense, with the rest of the world; in another, with ourselves.<br />
It is the effort to transform our economy into one which is modern and competitive. It is<br />
an effort to rc-direct our priorities. It is an effort to make an historic shift to Asia and the<br />
Pacific. All this means transforming ourselves our habits of mind and work; the way we se<br />
ourselves, and the way we sec the rest of the world.<br />
We will nccd those qualities which great athlctes and artists have.<br />
It will requirc confidence in ourselves, our institutions, our abilitics and our strength of<br />
purpose. It will require a miatufe sense of identity.<br />
I am one of thosc who is certain that the great transformation of Australia will occur.<br />
I am confident becausc I know what changes have already been made. I know what we<br />
have already achieved.<br />
Therc has been a revolution in our thinking, and an irrcvcrsible re-casting of our<br />
economy. Few countries, in fact, have moved so dramatically to restructure and rebuild.<br />
Fcwer still have determined oni doing this without sacrif icing those principles of fairness<br />
and equity which have always guided Australian democracy.<br />
My point today is not to argue about who is most fit to lead Australia through thc change.<br />
My point is that Australians have proved themsclves capable of making it. </p>
<p>T2EL5:. Jan. 93 12: 09 No. 006 P. 05/ 06<br />
Today I could quote to you at great length the irrefutable evidence for this:<br />
thc rise in manufacturing exports.<br />
the increase in those exports as a proportion of GDP;<br />
the increase in the proportion of exports going to Asia.<br />
the number of Australian firms who have in the past few ycars achieved<br />
international best practice.<br />
the enterprise agreements which are transforming our workplaces.<br />
This is not the place to make a speech on the economy.<br />
But it is the place to talk about thc Australian people, and I mention these things as a<br />
tribute to thcir achievements in recent years.<br />
We are going through bard times. More difficulties inevitably face us. But I am in no<br />
doubt that sometime in this decade the peoplc of Australia will be able to look back and<br />
say that, confronted with the challenge of securing their future, they rose to meet that<br />
challenge, And I say that because have seen it happening.<br />
On Australia Day 1993 Australians need look no further than their own recent history to<br />
find their inspiration and their pride.<br />
We will need help, and no doubt our sports men and women will continue to lift our<br />
spirits. And we will continue to see in them an image of what we would like ourselves to<br />
be even an image of what we imiagine We are.<br />
We do see in our hcroes an idealiscd reflection of ourselves, or at least a modcl for<br />
imitating. I<br />
An earlier gencration saw it in the likes of Donald Bradman. At other times people like<br />
Dawn Fraser and Betty Cuthbert and Shirley Strickland have provided the inspiration.<br />
Or Jon Konrads, or Rod Layer or Alan Border.<br />
Or, ladies and gentlemen, Evonne Goolagong, or Lionel Rose or Mark Ella or Mal<br />
Meninga.<br />
That last list could be turned into a very long one the list of Aboriginal Australians who<br />
have excelled in the field by which Australians so frcqucntly judgc themselves.<br />
As it is, the l~ ist of four includes two world chamnpions and two national captains.<br />
Four measures of our national achievement.<br />
In this United Nations International Year of the World's Indigenous People we might look<br />
harder at the idealised reflection of ourselves.<br />

And we might draw, perhaps, this conclusion: if we can share the inspiration, the pride<br />
and the patriotism of Aboriginal champions, surely we can share the feelings of those<br />
Aboriginal Australians whosc inspiration and pridc has been shattered, and who have no<br />
reason to feel patriotic.<br />
If we can take pride in what the champions have achieved, surely the same pride requires<br />
us to take sympathetic understanding to their people.<br />
If we can share the triumphs we can share the responsibility.<br />
It seems to me that all great achievemients begin with an act of imagination.<br />
Out there at Bowial in the twenties youn Donald Bradmani must * have imagined himself<br />
making centuries at the Sydney Cricket Ground and somewhere else in New South<br />
Wales the young Bill O'Reilly probably imagined himself getting him out.<br />
I don't know whether Ben Lea cvcr imagined he'd play in the Vienna Philharmonic, but I<br />
suspcct he did.<br />
And against all the odds, thc young Lionel Rose no doubt imagined himself one day a<br />
world champion and a national hero.<br />
If thcy can do it, we can.<br />
I have a feeling that thc solution to one of our great problems is, essentially, that act of<br />
imagination. if sport can teach us that, I amn even more for sport.<br />
If the arts can teach it, I am even more for the arts.<br />
If this bid for the Olympics in the year 2000 can teach uis, I am even more for thc bid.<br />
And if the personal triumphis of the past year, and this bid for thc Olympics in thc year<br />
2000, help Australians imagine a modern, strong, competitive and fair society, those<br />
people will have done their country a great service.<br />
I see the Sydney bid playing a substantial role in the grcat challenges which face Australia<br />
in 1990s.<br />
Whether it succeeds or tails might, in the end, be judged less important than the<br />
inspiration and confidence it gives us.<br />
But like all Australians, I dearly hope that it succccds and sincerely bclicvc that it<br />
should. Thank you all for coming and for the support you are giving this great project. ' V F . UV' L'V<br />
