    <content><![CDATA[<p>A giant of modern Australian politics has sadly passed away overnight.</p>
<p>He was a master parliamentarian, policy maker and politician.</p>
<p>John Button was a policy reformer in the truest sense.</p>
<p>John committed his life to Labor politics, improving the lives of those who needed it most and the progression of Australia.</p>
<p>For a man who was often described as diminutive, he was a towering figure in Victorian Labor politics.</p>
<p>From his time as a student at the University of Melbourne and prominent young lawyer, John was a leader and one of the great thinkers of his generation.</p>
<p>As Minister for Industry for a decade during the Hawke and Keating Governments, John played a determined hand in modernising the Australia economy, equipping it for the 21st century.</p>
<p>It buoys me at this very sad time that John's last year allowed him to witness two great personal events: seeing the Labor Party return to Government, and seeing his beloved Geelong Football Club win its first Premiership in 44 years.</p>
<p>John's sharp wit, powerful mind and kind nature will be missed by all who had the privilege of knowing and working with him.</p>
<p>My condolences go to John's family and all of his many loved ones.</p>
<p>The Australian Government will be offering John's family a State Funeral.</p>
