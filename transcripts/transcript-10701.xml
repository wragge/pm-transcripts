<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Sir, good morning.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good morning Jeremy. Good to be with you again.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Happy anniversary. This is the, what? The anniversary of 24 years.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, I was elected to Federal Parliament 24 years ago today, of</p>
<p>   the election held on May the 18th, 1974. That was an election in</p>
<p>   which Gough Whitlam was the Prime Minister and he was returned.</p>
<p>   The late Bill Sneddon was the Leader of the Opposition, and it was</p>
<p>   pouring with rain in Sydney. It was a very wet polling day and it</p>
<p>   was pouring with rain. A lot has happened in that 24 years, a lot</p>
<p>   has changed. A lot has not changed. I remember only a few months</p>
<p>   after I was elected to Parliament there was a report brought down,</p>
<p>   commissioned by the former Coalition Government, the previous coalition</p>
<p>   Government, and it recommended fundamental reform of Australia's</p>
<p>   taxation system as being in the long-term interest of the Australian</p>
<p>   economy. And interestingly enough, not much has changed with the</p>
<p>   Australian taxation system since that was introduced. Now while</p>
<p>   during that, almost a generation of political and social activity,</p>
<p>   an enormous amount has changed. For example there were hardly any</p>
<p>   women at all. I think there was only one or two in the House of</p>
<p>   Representatives when I entered it in 1974. Now thankfully, there</p>
<p>   are a very large number of women, particularly on our side as a</p>
<p>   result of the last election and there have been numerous other changes.</p>
<p>   One thing we haven't really come to terms with and come to</p>
<p>   grips with in this country is the need to fundamentally reform our</p>
<p>   tax system. That is a big issue now as it was 24 years ago.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Well, one year later in Â‘75 and all that kafuffle about the</p>
<p>   Senate overruling the authority of the House of Representatives</p>
<p>   and yet Kim Beazley is really predicting the same sort of thing.</p>
<p>   That if you get re-elected, he is going to oppose that tax package</p>
<p>   in the Senate.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well it's a mixed - the metaphor is he really wants to make</p>
<p>   the unrepresentative swill the cock of the walk, he really does.</p>
<p>   I mean this is the group of people that his predecessor and him,</p>
<p>   by implication, derided. But what he's really saying, and incidentally</p>
<p>   I don't deride the Senate, it's a legitimate important,</p>
<p>   fundamental part of our political system. It was the Labor Party</p>
<p>   who derided the Senate. But he's really saying is it doesn't</p>
<p>   matter what the Australian people decide at the next election, we</p>
<p>   the Labor Party are more important and we the Labor Party know better</p>
<p>   than the Australian people. We will going to the next election with</p>
<p>   a set of policies and if those policies are part of what we put</p>
<p>   to the Australian people and the Australian people vote for us and</p>
<p>   vote for those policies, we are entitled as a result of that, if</p>
<p>   we win, to have those policies put through the Parliament. But no,</p>
<p>   that's not good enough for Mr Beazley. He's arrogantly</p>
<p>   saying to the Australian people, I don't care what you say,</p>
<p>   I will have my way whether you like it or not. Now this is arrogance,</p>
<p>   this is really born to rule mentality.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>But it seems like such a funny position to take. </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well it's a crazy position to take and it's quite opposite</p>
<p>   to what he said a few months ago he was going to take. Perhaps he'll</p>
<p>   change again if he doesn't win the election.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Well, it was said this morning that the tactic was probably to</p>
<p>   smoke you out with the tax package a little bit early.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No no, we smoked ourselves out. We said we were going to go to</p>
<p>   the election with a tax package. We will unveil it and that tax</p>
<p>   package will contain significant personal income tax cuts. There</p>
<p>   are a lot of reasons why we should have a comprehensive reform.</p>
<p>   One of the great arguments in favour of a broad based indirect tax</p>
<p>   or a GST, call it what you may, is that it makes it much harder</p>
<p>   for the cheats to avoid paying their fair share. People resent the</p>
<p>   present system. Because a lot of people don't pay their fair</p>
<p>   share. If you have a broad based indirect tax instead of the existing,</p>
<p>   lumpy, very discriminatory wholesale sales tax, you catch a lot</p>
<p>   of the cheats. A lot of money now that now slips through the net,</p>
<p>   under the fence. It doesn't do so under a broad based indirect</p>
<p>   tax regime. The black economy is smaller under an indirect tax regime.</p>
<p>   The cheats don't like the sort of reform that we have in mind</p>
<p>   yet Mr Beazley apparently is trying block it. </p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Would you agree that the key thing is going to be in selling it.</p>
<p>   I see that there's a poll out this morning, not a terribly</p>
<p>   big one, but there is a poll. It says that most people, over 50%</p>
<p>   believe that they'll be paying more under a GST. </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look, Jeremy, could I stop you for a minute by saying, if you put</p>
<p>   a GST on top of the existing system, of course you're paying</p>
<p>   more. But we're not going to do that. I mean nobody's</p>
<p>   going to do that. If we bring in a broad based indirect tax, or</p>
<p>   GST, we will abolish existing indirect taxes. Of course we will.</p>
<p>   We're not going to put a GST on top of the existing system.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>So again....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It depends on the question that gets asked. If somebody says to</p>
<p>   me "Are you in favour of a GST on top of the present system"</p>
<p>   my answer would be no.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>No, and the other thing is that you made the point last week about</p>
<p>   those people who are battlers, or people who are disadvantaged...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>They're not going to be hurt. Now I did not come down in the</p>
<p>   last shower politically nor am I insensitive to the need to look</p>
<p>   after the under-privileged. And there is no way that we're</p>
<p>   going to produce a package that hurts the poor. We're not going</p>
<p>   to produce a package that isn't balanced, and we're certainly</p>
<p>   not going to produce a package that does not contain significant</p>
<p>   personal tax cuts for people in the low and middle income brackets.</p>
<p>   But this country is crying aloud for tax reform and all the Leader</p>
<p>   of the Opposition can do is to say no, no, no. I mean, we know what</p>
<p>   he's against, we don't know what he's for. Is he</p>
<p>   for anything? Is he just a carping negative whingeing opportunistic</p>
<p>   Opposition Leader. </p>
<p>Now I have waited for more than two years to sort of speak in these</p>
<p>   direct terms about his policy position. I accept that when you first</p>
<p>   go into Opposition after you've been in power for a long time</p>
<p>   it takes a while to sort things out and it's a bit unreasonable</p>
<p>   to ask a Party that's been in power for a long time to remake</p>
<p>   itself within the space of a year or 18 months. But he's now</p>
<p>   had more than two years as the Opposition Leader and its about time</p>
<p>   Mr Beazley told the Australian public what he believes in, what</p>
<p>   he stands for, what he wants to do, as distinct from saying that</p>
<p>   all he believes in is what we, is opposing what we stand for. All</p>
<p>   he wants to do is to stop, is to hinder and obstruct. And I think</p>
<p>   the Australian public are fed up with that. They want to know what</p>
<p>   he believes in and then they can make an informed choice.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>I suppose the problem is that, four o'clock in the morning</p>
<p>   or something like that, when you're waking up and your mind</p>
<p>   goes back to 1993, I mean it would be understandable to be very</p>
<p>   nervous about this considering the difficulty that some people seem</p>
<p>   to have in explaining or selling the advantages.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>But Jeremy, in a sense that's all the more credit that we</p>
<p>   should receive for having the courage to undertake it. </p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Well, you know where I stand. I mean, I think shortly after you</p>
<p>   became the leader of the Party, I was saying when you do get into</p>
<p>   office, you will be reforming the tax system.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well we have to reform the tax system.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>I agree with you.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I mean, we fixed the financial system, and we're trying to</p>
<p>   reform the industrial relations system, we got the Budget under</p>
<p>   control, we've given the country the lowest interest rates</p>
<p>   for 30 years, we've essentially fire-proofed the Australian</p>
<p>   economy against the Asian down turn, but there's one great</p>
<p>   piece of unfinished economic business and that is we need a modern</p>
<p>   competitive tax system. Because that's in Australia's</p>
<p>   interests. It will help our exporters, it will make us more competitive,</p>
<p>   it will take the burden off low and middle income workers, and it</p>
<p>   will stop the cheats. Now there's an overwhelming case. Now</p>
<p>   I know it's difficult. And I know people can run fear campaigns</p>
<p>   and I know people can be negative and say, oh no some time but not</p>
<p>   now. If we are ever going to do it it's now. We have low inflation.</p>
<p>   We have the clear evidence of the need to be competitive in our</p>
<p>   part of the world. We have a greater maturity within thinking circles</p>
<p>   in the Australian community about the need for it. We even have</p>
<p>   the welfare sector talking in quite a constructive fashion. I'm</p>
<p>   not discouraged by what ACOSS is saying. ACOSS is concerned about</p>
<p>   the core.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Well, if you could just get the ABC on side, I think you'd</p>
<p>   have the whole thing licked. </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look, let's just say, I'll have another drink of tea.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Let me say this though, that with that mandate that you acquired</p>
<p>   when you were elected, I think it was a mandate for change. Now</p>
<p>   what happened in the earlier stages was a certain amount of frustration</p>
<p>   that not enough was happening. I mean if you go back to the people</p>
<p>   with a demand for the right, and even if you've got to do it</p>
<p>   a couple times I suppose, the right to reform the tax system, the</p>
<p>   industrial relations system, and all the rest, I think you will</p>
<p>   have them standing in the aisles clapping.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well Jeremy, I hope so but that ultimately is for the Australian</p>
<p>   people to decide, not for me.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>But if you didn't get the Senate and it looked like everything</p>
<p>   would just be stalled, you know you'd been given the job but</p>
<p>   you haven't been given the right to do the job, you would keep</p>
<p>   going back I take it.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well look, I don't want to start speculating about when the</p>
<p>   election after the next election is going to be held. That's</p>
<p>   a bit silly. I'm focused on winning the next election whenever</p>
<p>   it is held. But I just simply make the point that if you have a</p>
<p>   situation where a Government goes to the people with a clear detailed</p>
<p>   policy. A policy which people might see as being in the long term</p>
<p>   interest but they recognise is politically difficult and a bit risky</p>
<p>   and we win that election, but not withstanding that, the Labor Party</p>
<p>   says unless we control the numbers in the Senate, we're going</p>
<p>   to stop you implementing what you said you were going to do. I just</p>
<p>   think that is thumbing your nose at democracy. That is saying to</p>
<p>   the Australian people, we know better than you. We in the Labor</p>
<p>   Party arrogantly believe that our view is superior to the view of</p>
<p>   the majority of the Australian people. Now I can't think of</p>
<p>   anything which is a greater denial of popular democracy than that.</p>
<p>   I mean after all we are meant in a democracy to listen. Governments</p>
<p>   lose office when they don't listen to the people. Can I say</p>
<p>   to Mr Beazley, Oppositions lose respect when they don't listen</p>
<p>   to the people.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX</p>
<p>Prime Minister, we're looking at the death throes of the Soeharto</p>
<p>   regime pretty obviously. Are you at all worried about what may come</p>
<p>   afterwards?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I am worried overall about what is occurring in Indonesia. Indonesia</p>
<p>   is a very important country for Australia. Very important indeed</p>
<p>   and our links with Indonesia go beyond our links with any particular</p>
<p>   regime or any particular government and my concern is that restraint</p>
<p>   be exercised. I do want to see more democracy. I also recognise</p>
<p>   that you're not going to get an overnight transfer from one</p>
<p>   political system to another without an enormous amount of upheaval</p>
<p>   which may involve a great deal more grief and a great deal more</p>
<p>   social dislocation than what we have already seen. I just hope that</p>
<p>   the situation in Indonesia can be managed in a way that there is</p>
<p>   maximum preservation of life and maximum economic stability but</p>
<p>   Indonesian people are going through a hard time and Australia should</p>
<p>   be, as it has always been, a very good friend and a country that</p>
<p>   is willing to help, a country that is willing, if asked for, to</p>
<p>   give advice and a country which is willing all the time to be arguing</p>
<p>   for change but arguing in a way that our arguments are listened</p>
<p>   to. </p>
<p>I noticed at the weekend that we were being given a bit of advice</p>
<p>   by the Opposition. Now, it's very easy when you are in Opposition</p>
<p>   to give that sort of advice. I suppose all Oppositions give that</p>
<p>   sort of advice, but I don't think anybody suggests that when</p>
<p>   the Labor Party was in power that Mr Keating was other than very</p>
<p>   close to President Soeharto, in fact, probably of all Australian</p>
<p>   Prime Ministers, most would say he was even closer to him than his</p>
<p>   predecessors. I don't think it's a question of whether</p>
<p>   you are close or not close to Soeharto. It's a question of</p>
<p>   whether you care about Indonesia's future or whether you care</p>
<p>   about the relationship between the two countries, and I do, and</p>
<p>   my aim is to have a relationship with Indonesia which is irrespective</p>
<p>   of whether somebody or other is in power in that country.</p>
<p> CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Would you be tempted to link aid and support to perhaps a rethink</p>
<p>   on the part of the Indonesians with regard to East Timor?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We have taken the view up until now, and so indeed did the former</p>
<p>   Government, that the best way that we can bring about change in</p>
<p>   Indonesia's attitude towards East Timor is to encourage and</p>
<p>   persuade and to use the close relationship we have to bring about</p>
<p>   gradual change. Indonesians in the past have been reluctant to take</p>
<p>   kindly to public advice and public hectoring in relation to East</p>
<p>   Timor and those countries that have tried to do it have been monumentally</p>
<p>   unsuccessful in bringing about change. I mean, I don't notice</p>
<p>   any evidence over the past few years that those that have said to</p>
<p>   Soeharto and others, you do this or you do that in relation to East</p>
<p>   Timor and have done it publicly I...</p>
<p> CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>But you don't think it might be a good time to urge a rethink?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I would have thought that at the moment there are things higher</p>
<p>   on the list of priorities of the Indonesian Government than East</p>
<p>   Timor.</p>
<p> CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>They've got their plans to defend the Australian dollar. I</p>
<p>   see this morning they're talking about a 60 cent dollar.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't talk about the level of the dollar except I will make</p>
<p>   this point, that people seem to have overlooked the fact that the</p>
<p>   Australian dollar against the trade weighted index, that's</p>
<p>   the basket of all of the currencies with which you compare the Australian</p>
<p>   dollar and it has not really gone down much at all in value. It's</p>
<p>   a fall, it's not actually a fall against the American dollar,</p>
<p>   it's just that the American dollar as a result partly of what</p>
<p>   is happening in Asia, the American dollar has gone up. So when you</p>
<p>   look at the Australian dollar versus the yen, the deutschmark, the</p>
<p>   pound and all the other currencies that are in the basket of currencies</p>
<p>   with which our currency is measured, the Australian dollar is doing</p>
<p>   very well indeed. Our economy may be geographically in Asia but</p>
<p>   economically, it's a thousand miles away because it's</p>
<p>   much stronger.</p>
<p> CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>The interest rates, what steady?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The interest rates in Australia are the lowest they have been for</p>
<p>   30 years. </p>
<p> CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Yes but in real terms with inflation so low, they are still pretty</p>
<p>   high, aren't they?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes but gee, they are much lower.We haven't had these interest</p>
<p>   rates for small business and homebuyers for 30 years which is a</p>
<p>   tremendous achievement.</p>
<p> CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Yes but do you see interest rates coming down a bit, steady as she</p>
<p>   goes?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't want, once again, I don't really want to speculate</p>
<p>   about their future development. I notice that the Governor of the</p>
<p>   Reserve Bank made some remarks about interest rates a couple of</p>
<p>   weeks ago, suggesting that in his view they were likely to remain</p>
<p>   virtually where they are for some time. Now I simply draw people's</p>
<p>   attention to that. I will neither endorse it nor dissociate myself</p>
<p>   from it. </p>
<p> CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, have you seen this story about, I've got no</p>
<p>   idea who gave them permission, but the Royal Australian Mint in</p>
<p>   Canberra is already working on new designs for a currency change</p>
<p>   to coincide with the republic?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I saw the story. I don't know what the source of the authority</p>
<p>   is if it occurred and I have got to say that it's a little</p>
<p>   premature.</p>
<p> CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Will you be inquiring?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I will actually. I'm not here to make a big deal about it and</p>
<p>   if the explanation is look, we plan years ahead and we have all</p>
<p>   sorts of contingencies and so forth, and why shouldn't we,</p>
<p>   maybe that's reasonable. But I simply make the point that this</p>
<p>   is for the Australian people to decide. I am a little surprised</p>
<p>   but I am not, at this stage, prepared to be critical unless I know</p>
<p>   what the background is. People are often accused in Government of</p>
<p>   not preparing for the future and when they do, even though that</p>
<p>   particular future may not occur, it's a bit rough to sort of</p>
<p>   come down on them like a tonne of bricks.</p>
<p> CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Yes, it sort of looks a little partisan on the side of the issue</p>
<p>   though?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>This issue will go to the Australian public and it will be resolved</p>
<p>   at a referendum next year and until then, obviously the present</p>
<p>   system remains and it may well be that as a result of the vote at</p>
<p>   the referendum next year, the present system will be endorsed.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Now the networks are already jockeying to get the right to do the</p>
<p>   election debate. It seems Channel Nine is in the front running for</p>
<p>   that and it seems that, you don't seem to have a lot of confidence</p>
<p>   in the ABC's ability to be unbiased. Is that putting too sharp</p>
<p>   a point on it?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I said the other day when I was asked about this that I would allow</p>
<p>   the Federal Director of the Liberal Party, Lynton Crosby, to do</p>
<p>   all the negotiations on this. If there is to be one of these debates,</p>
<p>   we want it to be fair and balanced. I thought Channel Nine ran the</p>
<p>   debates before the last election pretty well. It doesn't mean</p>
<p>   to say that they are going to get it this year. I will leave that</p>
<p>   to Lynton Crosby. I am not going to spend the next three or four</p>
<p>   months, or whatever the period of time is, or six or eight or two</p>
<p>   weeks or whatever, don't take any notice of that, but debating</p>
<p>   the format of the election debate.</p>
<p> CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Yes, yes but it just strikes me as strange that the national broadcaster,</p>
<p>   the national broadcaster should absolutely be unbiased and if the</p>
<p>   government of the day doesn't have faith in that position,</p>
<p>   I guess it begs the question, why don't you do something about</p>
<p>   it?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The ABC operates under a charter and if the Government has a problem</p>
<p>   with anything that the ABC does, the Government puts its view to</p>
<p>   the ABC. Now I have a lot of respect for the ABC. It think it's</p>
<p>   a great Australian institution. I also have views on occasions about</p>
<p>   the breadth of its objectivity or its vision when it comes to the</p>
<p>   coverage of certain political events. Now that's no secret</p>
<p>   and I am not reluctant to express my view publicly and privately</p>
<p>   but we had views that we put at the time of the discussion concerning</p>
<p>   the debates before the last election and those views were soundly</p>
<p>   based but what happens for the next election is something that,</p>
<p>   so far as the Liberal Party is concerned, I will leave in the hands</p>
<p>   of Lynton Crosby. I am sure he will do it very well.</p>
<p> CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, could we take a couple of calls. Trevor.</p>
<p>CALLER TREVOR:</p>
<p>Yes. Good morning Prime Minister. Thank you very much for allowing</p>
<p>   me to speak to you. You may have just partially answered a couple</p>
<p>   of questions that I had wished to ask but before I ask those questions</p>
<p>   I have to actually give a bit of background to frame them so I can</p>
<p>   put them in the proper context.</p>
<p> CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Be quick, Trevor.</p>
<p>TREVOR:</p>
<p>Right. The Australian savings have fallen dramatically since 1972</p>
<p>   which is inversely proportional to inflationary policies pursued</p>
