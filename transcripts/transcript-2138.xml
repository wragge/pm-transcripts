FOR PRESS: P. M. No. 80/ 1969<br />
PREMIERS' CONFERENCE ON RECEIPTS DUTY TAX<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton<br />
The purpose of today's meeting was to discuss the<br />
problem posed by the recent decision of the High Court regarding<br />
the validity of the receipts duty tax levied by the States.<br />
It is the intention of the States, in order to obtain a<br />
definite and final decision, to take another case to the High Court<br />
to decide whether this tax is still held to be invalid in some or all<br />
circumstances. Both the States and the Commonwealth hope that in<br />
this important matter a final decision can be arrived at as soon as<br />
possible. Further, at the request of all the State Premiers, the<br />
Prime Minister and Treasurer agreed to put to Cabinet a proposal<br />
that, in the event of the present taxes being found invalid in some or<br />
all respects, the Commonwealth should pass legislation, on a uniform<br />
basis, imposing a like tax and enabling the States to receive it. This<br />
would prevent the loss of revenue to the States which would otherwise<br />
occur during the present financial year.<br />
If this were done, it would be sought to make the<br />
Commonwealth legislation retrospective to the date of this statement.<br />
