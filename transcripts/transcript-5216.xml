Thoso election deat~ a vai at a cy-itical timeU in Australia' s<br />
history. Tho conotnt. lesson of Australia~ n politics had to ba<br />
learnt; that politivial c6iviskon eq~ uals political deiath. ' The<br />

Labor had aciird massive power in war timte; the temptations<br />
for thom to use it to aohi.' vc Socialist ocbjootives in pencet4ine<br />
were now at hand. rlon sensed thbst tho values for which those<br />
in our party stood were under severe threat, He ) Xnew that if he<br />
wanteO a froo and vigorous AustraliAa he woeld have to marshaill<br />

In 1944, at a meeting ip Canberra, Men2ies brought 14 organisations<br />
under the one bannter wIth on.-body of ideas, H~ e gave them a<br />
united, nntional perspLootive. Hie turnecl his attention to policie3<br />
doigned to free the spiiit of Australian mien and womcon. But<br />
above all~ he Sought for tho new Party, a national-Organisation<br />
and he achlovecl it.<br />
Yet, by 1946 tho meomory of dvision was ntill t00 clozo in the<br />
public's mind. Tile viutory coDu14 not b~ e ' expooted XtI11. tho<br />

Yet In thatt short space of timo, something hnad happened to<br />
the Liberal Party. HPnd we begun to tak~ e otir cleotoral success<br />

on our lack of percoptionr our apathy; our absence of strength<br />
inl holdiang to Outcw pWt1rinciples. Australi ans had been persuaded<br />
that it was time.~<br />
TiniO for What? ' Xho quiestiorn was scion to be answered, but not as<br />
tho nation had expected. Wns it dmne for oppressivo intreases in<br />
taxcationl, mafssive oonltion in government exponditure, Crippling<br />
ndcelerittion in wages? Was Jt time for governntefit growth to strangle<br />
the privatc sector, for the cconfrny to stagnato? Was it time for<br />
us to bo shown that Labor c~ ould not ilfforcl all itS cjrandioso plrnus<br />

crippled by Lab3ox policoies? Was it time for Iracditiorual </p>
<p>-3-<br />
values to be tbreitceoi by th~ e intriison of government? Whethor<br />
is was time or not, it heippelledl<br />
In 1974, we wore presented with 9aiother opportutnity to preventK<br />
the damage beini. done by Labor. DB had forgotten earlier<br />
hftor tho defeat of 1972 wo wont into o-pposition as<br />
two Parties 110 aS a coalition. AP~ in 1.946, we noccled to persuado<br />

This, I beliovc, is our xicheszt a : It we. CMU to this,<br />
the spirit of entcrpriso that rnakcs froedom wortbwh&amp;*). e, then we<br />
can have every confidenco thatt grcat nobievemorts . are at hand.<br />
* Tho lesIson of t-he 140s, mid incleed tho ' 70s, is that once we<br />
unite in vivion and in piirposc, sJTnif. icant victories are<br />
ftmtiwe~ s, Anth'L iwidst of with e aod largeo3t<br />
majority since F'ederation, ~ It iin very difiictit to i~ mmber<br />
the dicipl. ine an elf-xeatraint which are essontial to<br />
victory. Thoe. cp%) alitios have speoial Mcaninj for us. The ' Liberal Party<br />
lo not so~ othincj dcaigned to advance our indilvdua! interests.<br />
It Isnot : l'u~ st somethin. gI hcnod tO lIdV~ lIce om-i Parlty's<br />
itero8ts ox evenl tlloze of t-lic Calitio~ n. Its justification<br />
for existance Ss' that its~ polloles. ore tdesignncl for all Allstrallans.<br />
Yet these plioce are~ an em~ pty tVei v remain onsupportod<br />
by our capacity to put them Into effect. Oulr PartYV was born<br />
out of a co-antitnment by ono paroon, working with many other dedicated<br />
Atistra. iane., to advanc( e the Oauseo of freedom and1 individualism<br />
in Atra3. ia. This ii a con) tinuing and demnanding task. It will<br />
always rtleet with. re~ zistnno;, Theteo re those of. no faith Who<br />
want polsitival power An order to 11S. it A-or thlemselves<br />
Thewo are thoso who bel ievo that Canberxa sho-uld dominate<br />
Australian po]. itics; that the States should be abolishatli<br />
that the powers* of the Senate should be dramnatically redliced.<br />
TPhis higlilights the essential differenos between Liberalism.<br />
and Sooialism.<br />
We want people to decide for thomse3. veoi; others. believe that<br />
big and powerful. centralist govarnmont knows boo~ t what is right<br />
for you and me. This view ist repmgnant to the individuaality of<br />
all Australiano. The threa~ t to our values and pxeinoiplcs is<br />
ni~ ways precnt. Tho excosseo of the Whitlapi years aro<br />
well documented, They have been decisively rojecte4.<br />
Yet, agninst the jxdgoment of the Aurtralian peopler L~ abor~<br />
only rcoently protevted aonfident3y that, " Therc, was nothing<br />
rvoletionary or particularly radical about the Whitl&amp;' m years".<br />
So that while w~ e celebrate an anverraary this' evening, this is<br />
) lot tho time for scelf-vongratolation. Rather it is tS-re for<br />
omflitrncnt aniO doCtC) riniat, lot. </p>

to fxc~ o tho spirit of men na women is constant and UflE1flcV1flg.<br />
Tho battlefCiold ITAmst never be vacatod. Wlint we oan dlo now<br />
is to win that fCcedom for our tArno; to hand on to our children,<br />
