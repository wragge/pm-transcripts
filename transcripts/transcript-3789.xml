ZbTKLA Press Statement No. 519<br />
June 1975<br />
JOINT PRESS STATEM4ENT ON WAGE FIXATION<br />
The Premiers' Conference discussed future approaches<br />
to wage fixation in Australia in the light of the existing high<br />
levels of inflation. In a statement issued after the<br />
Conference, the Prime Minister and Premiers said that,<br />
following the historic National Wage Case decision of April<br />
when the Australian-Conciliation and Arbitration Commission<br />
conditionally accepted the principle of wage indexation,<br />
there is a definite opportunity for the recent explosion in<br />
wages and prices to be brought under control. The Governments<br />
unanimously supported the guidelines handed down in the<br />
decision for future wage claims. They said that it was<br />
encouraging that the gu'delinet had received such widespread<br />
acceptance and endorsemnent by other tribunals and by a wide<br />
cross section of the Australian community, including the<br />
executive of the ACTU and other influential spokesmen<br />
from the union movement.<br />
They appealed to all sections of the industrial<br />
community to play their part by co-operating to achieve an<br />
orderly and just system of wage fixing based on economic<br />
realism and industrial sanity. They warned that unless this<br />
co-operation is forthcoming Australia faced a situation in<br />
which accelerating inflation would reach crippling heights,<br />
imperilling our economic future and causing hardship to<br />
ever increasing numbers and groups throughout the community.<br />
In this situation the Prime Minister and the Premiers<br />
were in common accord on the need to take action to uphold the<br />
guidelines set down in the National Wage Case decision.<br />
This would include:.<br />
* Working toward a uniform approach in the hearings<br />
on indexation before the Australian Conciliation<br />
and Arbitration Commission in July/ August;<br />
* Support by Governments for the guidelines in<br />
appropriate industry cases;<br />
Action to ensure compliance with the guidelines<br />
in public employment within the control of Governments;<br />
A meeting of bodies responsible for wage-fixing<br />
in government employment;<br />
Appropriate measures so that tribunals, however<br />
constituted, act in accordancd. with the guidelines;<br />
A meeting of Australian and State Ministers for Labor<br />
will be convened as soon as possible to discuss action.<br />
