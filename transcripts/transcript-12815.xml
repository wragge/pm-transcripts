    <content><![CDATA[<p>As Chairman in Office of the Commonwealth I have decided to convene a second meeting of the Commonwealth leadersâ€™ troika on Zimbabwe. Preparations are proceeding for a meeting of the troika in Abuja, Nigeria, on 23 September 2002 to consider developments in Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>I have taken this decision following consultation with Commonwealth leaders. My fellow Commonwealth troika leaders President Obasanjo of Nigeria and President Mbeki of South Africa have confirmed their availability for the meeting, assisted by the Commonwealth Secretary-General Don McKinnon. We have agreed to meet in Abuja at the invitation of President Obasanjo. Given the importance of the Zimbabwe issue for Africa, it is of course particularly appropriate that our meeting be held on the African continent.</p>
<p>Working under a mandate from the Coolum Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM), the troika last met on 19 March 2002 in London. On that occasion, we issued the Marlborough House statement, containing a series of clear steps to address the situation in Zimbabwe. It is a matter of regret that six months after our London meeting, little substantive progress has yet been made in implementing these steps. Instead, conditions in Zimbabwe have continued to deteriorate. All troika members are anxious to see progress in Zimbabwe and its earliest possible return to full protection of Commonwealth democratic values. I know that all three leaders comprising the troika will be working together with determination to achieve this.</p>
