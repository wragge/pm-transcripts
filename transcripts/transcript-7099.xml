V F ROOFONLY<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF PRESS CONFERENCE,.. TAHIRA PALACE, CAIRO<br />
iF_ EUARY 1987<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, are you worried about the way the<br />
America's Cup-is-going?-<br />
-Yes. I--hope I get home in-time; to-turn-it ar6und...<br />
JOURNALIST: Have you spoken to anybody at home at about<br />
PM: About the America's Cup. No, I haven't. I made one phone<br />
call to see how it was going. But I haven't issued any<br />
instructions.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you still think we will win?<br />
PM: I hope so.<br />
JOURNALIST: Have you bought Mr Reagan's hat yet?<br />
PM: I am not by nature a pessimist, you know that Gregory.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you think your presence back home will have a<br />
significant effect on Australia-s chances?<br />
PM: I hope I will be there in time for . it to be relevant.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, have you raised in your talks with<br />
the Prime Minister here, your brief that the Israel and the PLO<br />
should PM: I alluded to it today Peter. But I will be having detailed<br />
discussions tomorrow with Dr Meguid, the Foreign Minister, who<br />
was there today and with President Mubarak and I will go into<br />
more detail then. But I did go to it briefly today.<br />
JOURNALIST: You mentioned in the speech that you are giving<br />
tonight that you encountered an emerging and important view that<br />
the confederation of Jordan was the most likely outcome. Where<br />
have you encountered that emerging and important view and does<br />
that include<br />
PM: The language of that section is deliberate I t says, as I<br />
recall, in some of the talks I have had, that refers to the talks<br />
I had in Jordan and the talks I had in Israel with some of the<br />
Palestinians. Bringing all those talks together, there was that<br />
view. And I must say that in the brief-discussions I have had<br />
today, I mean I have had discussions for three hours, but they<br />
were reasonably brief on this aspect, and I got the impression<br />
that same view was shared here. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: What is your personal view about that sort of<br />
outcome? pm: my view is, first, that it's for the outcome to arise from<br />
the discussions between the parties. It's what the parties<br />
arrive at is the agreement which I regard as the most<br />
appropriate. Looking at it from the outside, as not a party<br />
principal, it seems to me that something-like that is theappropriate<br />
outcome because I share the judgement that is made by<br />
the people who have expressed that view to me, that there is novt-<br />
ab-le-a it e-rn-a-tiye-i n-pot-i-t-i-c a c onomi-c-t-e-r-m-s. z-<br />
JOURNALIST: Have your Egyptian counterparts filled you in at all<br />
on the reported-improv-ed -relati-bnsihig-bLt etl Egytandrdthe-r-est<br />
-of the Ara-b world?<br />
PM: There was a brief reference to that. I repeat but just let<br />
me make it clear we had three hour discussions this afternoon.<br />
Firstly, myself and the Prime Minister for something like three<br />
quarters of an hour. And then we went into the meeting where he<br />
had many of his ministers and so the day's discussions weren't<br />
dominated by the regional issues. There was discussion about it<br />
and I'll develop that more in the discussions tomorrow with the<br />
Foreign Minister and with the President. But to the extent that<br />
we did discuss it, there was-satisfaction on the part of my<br />
Egyptian friends at the fact that they were involved once again<br />
in the Arab Summit, and satisfaction with the significant role<br />
that was played-by. President-Mubar And there -was. a judgement<br />
expressed to me that it was a positive summit. And particularly<br />
they expressed with me their concern about the Iran-Iraq war and<br />
the hope that out of the Kuwait Summit there may be, as a result<br />
of a declaration made on this issue there, some moves towards a<br />
resolution of this issue.-<br />
JOURNALIST: What was the dominant theme of the talks with the<br />
theme? PM: The order of events in the major meeting was the Israel-Arab<br />
dispute and the peace processes. That was the first thing that<br />
was talked about. Then there was reference to the Iran-Iraq war,<br />
reference to terrorism and the commitment of Egypt to do<br />
everything it can, not only itself but in within an international<br />
context, to try and stamp out terrorism. And then there was-also<br />
reference to the co-operation between Australia in the<br />
non-proliferation field. They particularly referred, with<br />
gratitude, to the stance of Australia on aparthei And then<br />
from those matters we moved to bilateral issues arnd we spent a<br />
good deal of time on those. There was the view expressed by the<br />
Prime Minister and his Ministers and to which I totally acceded<br />
that we should do all that-we can between Us to build the level<br />
of relationships, not only in the economic field. But I will go<br />
to that first. They referred to the very significant imbalance<br />
in trade between us and it is a gross imbalance in our favour.<br />
And I said that we would do everything we could to increase the<br />
opportunity for Egypt to expand its exports to Australia. We<br />
already finance exhibitions in our trade centres in Melbourne and<br />
Sydney. We will attempt to do more in that regard. I made the<br />
point that it would-be-my-hope that the expansion of economic </p>
<p>relationships between us should as far as possible be directed to<br />
trying to see how we from Australia could assist Egypt in meeting<br />
the enormous challenges that they face in economic and social<br />
development in this country. Within that framework we agreed<br />
that we should look at the possibilities of establishing an<br />
overall joint committee between Egypt and Australia which would<br />
supervise developments in economic relations between us but also<br />
in the area of scientific-and technological co-operation and in<br />
cultural and educational exchanges. In particular also, there<br />
was the suggestion made that we could see-whether there could be<br />
e-stab-lished--a--joint--Aus-t-r al-i-a-n---ypt-b sine-ss-ot-su-1-t-a-t-ive<br />
council. I believe that that's a good idea. And there has<br />
already been some preliminary discussions with the Confederation<br />
of Australian In-db try abdutth-a t6ibiity.---And-weal stalked<br />
about the possible involvement of Egypt-in thebicentenary.<br />
So you can See that there was dlsciussion about-a-_<br />
wide range of matters. But perhaps I should also mention in the<br />
broad economic area the interest of Egypt in getting a greater<br />
degree of Australian involvement in the area of dry land farming<br />
and irrigation. And I indicated that we would certainly be<br />
prepared to seek to increase our involvement with them there.<br />
There was also some discussion about the possibility of an<br />
Australian initiative in the idea of building and supplying a<br />
coal-fired power station here at Zafarana, and they asked for<br />
some Australian involvement in the preparation of specifications<br />
for that project, which will have to be considered by the World<br />
Bank. And I would hope that as a result of the discussions that<br />
I have had, that when that process is d. eveloped that an<br />
Australian tender would have a good opportunity of being<br />
successful. But as they pointed out they would be required to<br />
call for international tenders that is correct. But as I say, I<br />
hope that with initial Australian involvement we would have a<br />
very good opportunity of being successful in that area.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, did you get the impression that Australian<br />
wheat sales to Egypt are secure from the US/ EC trade war in that<br />
area? PM: Let me say this, that they expressed satisfaction with the<br />
relations between us on that. They referred to the recent<br />
signing of an agreement for 2 million tonnes of wheat. They<br />
expressed their gratitude also for the increase from 40,000 to<br />
50,000 tonnes in the wheat aid supplied plus the agreement by us<br />
to build wheat silos in Egypt. So it is very clear that they<br />
have an excellent relationship with us and with our authorities<br />
in the area of wheat sales. we didn't go to the question of<br />
subsidised sales by other countries, but I formed the distinct<br />
impression that they like the relationship they have got with us<br />
in this area.<br />
JOURNALIST: On the confederation, are you satisfied that there<br />
is a majority of support amongst the Palestinians<br />
PM: I can't say on the basis of any poll that I have done or<br />
that has been done. All I can do, Mike, is to listen to a fairly<br />
wide range of people who have much closer associations with the<br />
Palestinians than I do. And the judgements, impressions I have<br />
formed are from people who obviously do have very close </p>
<p>associations with them.<br />
JOURNALIST: confederation do you see, for example, a<br />
power-sharing arrangement between the Palestinians and King<br />
Hussein.. PM: It is far too early for me to try and put myself into aposition<br />
which at this stage, for instance, His Majesty hasn'-t<br />
moved into. He hasn't gone -to the detail. You have gtto<br />
handle these things in stages. You move from concept to<br />
ne got iatio fie nht~ oi details. TWTt--w6ii7I-d be pr esump tuou fr-xto<br />
purport to lay down some detailed concept of the mechanics of<br />
confdeWratito'. s imprtat t saat_ this stage is that<br />
those that I have spoken to who are di rectliy-involved see thatconcept<br />
as the most-likely -outcome of-thq-proZesses of---<br />
negotiation. JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, in one of your interviews last night<br />
you said that you had undertaken to make personal representations<br />
to the Government of China about the position in the Middle East.<br />
Can you elaborate on that?<br />
PM: I don't want to go into all the details, but I can give you<br />
a general outline. What was put is that if the concept of the<br />
five permanent members of the Security Council's idea for a<br />
conference is to be pursued then that involves China. And it<br />
would be sensible to acquaint China with the thinking of those<br />
involved on this subject. And I -am more than happy--to-conve-ythat<br />
thinking to the Government of China.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do they want China to re-open diplomatic relations?<br />
PM: Israel would like to see diplomatic relations, yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: But was it a specific request by the Israelis..<br />
PM: Yes they wanted me to put the position to China, yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: If China were to re-open diplomatic relations<br />
PM: You are not quite sure who would follow who, are you?<br />
JOURNALIST: Has the visit of Mr-Sheverdnadze been confirmed-yet?<br />
PM: No, not to my knowledge.<br />
JOURNALIST: Would you be raising that with..<br />
PM: Of course I would raise the question with him.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, are you encouraged by the recent<br />
apparent thaw in relations between Israel and the Soviet Union<br />
evidenced by the meeting in Washington between the Soviet and<br />
Israeli ambassadors?<br />
PM: Yes I am. Any development in the relations between the<br />
Soviet Union and Israel is t o be welcomed because it seems to me<br />
so obvious that if there were a resumption o-f diplomatic-</p>
<p>relations, and particularly in a context where there was an<br />
improvement in the treatment by the Soviet of Soviet Jewry, must<br />
be a plus not only for the relations between Israel and the<br />
Soviet Union but for the region, and not only for the region<br />
because any improvement in the stability and the processes<br />
towards peace in this region are a plus for the whole world.<br />
JOURNALIST: Does that committee that you mentioned economic<br />
relations a ministerial committee<br />
JOURNALIST: What is the value of the pwrventure?__<br />
PM: What is the value.,_ the-dollar-value?<br />
JOURNALIST: Yes.<br />
PM: There hasn't been any figure-<br />
JOURNALIST: The magnitude?<br />
PM: The magnitude of the generation is they are talking about<br />
2,400 megawatts. So you can see from that you are talking about<br />
a considerable operation. I also add,-Michelle, that it's-not<br />
only the question of the construction of and supply of coal for<br />
that very substantial station but there could be also the<br />
question of the construction. aof -associated-port. f acili-ties.-I<br />
don't want to leave the impression that we have done a deal on<br />
this. All I am saying is that there's been an Australian<br />
interest, there has been discussions and visits about this. And<br />
there was a quite extensive discussion between us today and very<br />
frank and direct in the sense tIhat they wanted Australian<br />
co-operation in the initial stages of,. developing the<br />
specifications but pointed out that under the requirements of the<br />
world Bank which they hope would be involved in the financing of<br />
the project, under those processes, there i. s properly a<br />
requirement for international tendering. So there will be people<br />
other than Australia who will would be interested. I am simply<br />
saying that I think as a result of these things there are some<br />
chance for Australia. Firstly, the undoubted competence that<br />
Australia has in the area of the construction of coal fired power<br />
stations, the competence we have in the development of port<br />
facilities. And secondly, the obvious cordial relations that<br />
already exist between our two countries which I have no doubt are<br />
going to be strengthened as a result of this visit. Now in the<br />
end, Australia will have to win our honest merits but I believe<br />
those merits are considerable.<br />
JOURNALIST: Which Australian companies are involved?<br />
PM: There is a group, the name I don't know, I haven't been told<br />
at this stage what particular companies are involved in it. So I<br />
can't convey it to you because I don't know what specific<br />
companies are involved. I could probably find out.<br />
JOUNALST: Prime minister, could I ask you how you have had<br />
confirmed that the PLO, however reluctantly, has come to the </p>
<p>6<br />
conclusion that Israel is here to stay?<br />
PM: I guess one obvious part of the answer to that is that the<br />
year long process that occurred between King Hussein and Mr<br />
Arafat. That year long discussion, going from February 85 to<br />
February 86, was clearly based upon that assumption. I mean<br />
there was no argument about the reality-of Israel and the<br />
continued reality in Israel.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, what difference of did you find in<br />
your talks today<br />
PM: A very considerable identity.--Let me-make-this point,-tha-t<br />
the Foreign Minister said that it was not realistic to expect<br />
that Jord-an -could g_. into the di. rectneg-otiati. onswithsrael by<br />
itself. That is precisely the point that King Hussein has made<br />
to me. There is an identity on the question of the need as they<br />
saw it for an international conference. An identity on the view<br />
that such an international conference would not impose solutions<br />
but would provide a framework within which there would be direct<br />
negotiations between the parties involved. On all these<br />
fundamental issues what I saw is a virtual identity of view.<br />
JOURNALIST: Would Syria be involved in these talks?<br />
PM: In the processes of direct negotiations within the framework<br />
of an international conference of course Syria would be involved.<br />
Without the presence of Syria-you-couldn't-have a total<br />
conclusion of the peace processes.<br />
JOURNALIST: But it appears that Syria is very hostile to the<br />
idea?<br />
PM: You would have to deal with ther, sorts of things step by<br />
step. If you look at the past what has happened is you have got<br />
part of the problem resolved as a result of the 1978 Camp David<br />
Accord and the 1979 Peace Agreement which involved Egypt and<br />
Israel. The emphasis at this time is upon Jordan how Jordan is<br />
going to be involved in the processes. Now quite clearly at some<br />
stage if you are going to have a total resolution of this matter<br />
there is going to have to be a situation in which Syria is also<br />
at the table. But I don't speak with confidence in that area at<br />
this stage. I have not had the opportunity of discussions in<br />
that area and I don't seek to complicate it as far as I am<br />
concerned by addressing myself to an aspect of the issue which as<br />
I say I don't have a particular confidence.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke did the Egyptians give you any indication<br />
that they thought the inernal politics of Jordan were stable<br />
enough to cope with King Hussein doing a-deal with Israel<br />
PM: There was no indication to me of any doubt on their part on<br />
this point.<br />
JOURNALIST: Did you glean anything from your discussions today<br />
to suggest that the PLO might resume some sort of discussions<br />
with Jordan. </p>
<p>A. 7<br />
PM: With Jordan? There was nothing in the discussion today<br />
which lead me to believe the Egyptians saw that as a great<br />
obstacle. Mr Arafat was at the Kuwait Conference and there was<br />
reference to the fact that the King and Mr Arafat spoke, so there<br />
was-nothing said in the discussions today which put that as a<br />
problem, as an obstacle.<br />
JOURNALIST: Can you give us any indication as to how the<br />
Iran-Iraq war is actually going?<br />
PM: All I can say on that is that in the discussions that I<br />
have had today there is no discussion in detail about how the war<br />
_._ was going other-. than i-t wasput as a matter of very serious<br />
concern both in terms of the size of the casualties and seemingly<br />
endless nature of the conflict. And there was some perception on<br />
the part of Egypt as on the part of Jordan as to the dangers that<br />
would be involved in the hypothetical situation if Iran were to<br />
win that conflict. But no discussion as to actual progress of<br />
the war. It may be that in the discussions that I have tomorrow<br />
the Foreign Minister and the President that there may be some<br />
aggression of that issue.<br />
JOURNALIST: were the Egyptians pleased with the outcome of<br />
the Kuwait conference and<br />
PM: Yes, to the first part of the question that they were<br />
pleased with the conference. They said they regarded it as<br />
positive conference.----And while they didn't directly comment<br />
upon the second point about building their position it was quite<br />
clear that they were pleased to be back in the conference part of<br />
the Summit. I made the observation that I believe that it was<br />
appropriate that they were back and they agreed with that. And<br />
that was the extent to the coverage of that point.<br />
ends I </p>
