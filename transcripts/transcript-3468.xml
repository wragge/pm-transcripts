PRESS RELhEASEL 18 November 1974<br />
REGIONAL E1. PLOYvL1, NT DEVE~ LOPM4ENT SCHEME ( REDS)<br />
The Prime Minister today released a list of Gold Coast<br />
projects approved by the REYDS Committee of ministers at their<br />
last meeting in Canberra on 13SNoiember. Mr Whitlam was<br />
holding a press conference at Suri ers Paradise.<br />
The Regional Employment Development Scheme is designed<br />
to improve employment opportunities in areas of high unemployment<br />
by encouraging local initiative in these areas to develop<br />
suitable work programs.<br />
Projects with a high proportion of funds allotted for<br />
wages are generally preferred. Recruitment of labour for<br />
projects under the Scheme will be administered by the localin<br />
this case, SIouthport office of the Commonwealth Employment<br />
Service. . excluding supervisory and specialist personnel, all<br />
labour requirements will be drawn from persons eligible for<br />
unemployment benefits.<br />
In selecting the labour required, preference will be<br />
given to persons with dependents who have been unemployed the<br />
longest. Married persons working part-time or on short time<br />
will not necessarily be disqualified from employment on projects.<br />
All persons employed under the scheme will be " worktested"<br />
for suitable employment at not less than monthly<br />
intervals and their continued employment on a project at<br />
Australian Government expense will be conditional on there being<br />
no such alternative employment.<br />
This will ensure that projects do not compete for labour<br />
with regular employers.<br />
Proposals for projects that may receive assistance<br />
may emanate from such bodies as local government authorities,<br />
community groups, special purpose groups, business enterprises,<br />
or State Departments. They should receive the endorsement of<br />
the appropriate local government authority.<br />
The approved Gold Coast Projects, which will be<br />
administered through the Southport District Employment Office<br />
are: </p>
