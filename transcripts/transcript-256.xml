SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE RT. HON. R. G.<br />
MENZIES, AT KING'S SCHOOL, SYDNEY, ON WEDNESDAY<br />
14+ TH DECEMBER. 1960<br />
This kind of speech is much the hardest kind of<br />
speech to make. Do you realise that, all of you who suffer from<br />
speeches and don't make them? ( Laughter) It's much the hardest<br />
of the lot. When I arrived I looked around. I had no idea how<br />
many political characters I knew masquerading today as Old Boys<br />
of the King's School. This in itself is a most embarrassing<br />
affair. Some of them, no doubt, have every right to be here.<br />
( Laughter) Then the place is fall of parents who regard a Speech<br />
Day as their annual penance and celebrate their penance for the<br />
next three d. ays as Christmas virtue.<br />
Then there are the poor unhappy boys of the School who<br />
have to sit around, as I used to in my time, and listen to some<br />
ponde. rous old politician make a boring speech, saying to themselves,<br />
as some of them are already, " I wish he'd cut it down<br />
and make it short". ( Laughter)<br />
But there are just one or two things that I really<br />
ought to say by way of self-excuse at the beginning.<br />
The Headmaster, I thought, went to some pains to<br />
demonstrate that John Pascoe Fawkner wasn't it John Pascoe?<br />
Batman? Oh, well, both good Melbourne fellows ( Laughter) But<br />
when he pointed out that Batman started here, and I gathered,<br />
from what he said, steadily went down in life ( Laughter) by<br />
going to Tasmania, and then establishing Victoria, he made me<br />
feel that I was really sp caking as a representative of a quite<br />
parvenu city. ( Laughter)<br />
But I retort to him that I am not here speaking for the<br />
parvenu city, but I am here as Prime Minister of Parramatta.<br />
( Laughter, applause)<br />
Then when I was looking through the book of the words<br />
because you boys ought to realise that before somebody like<br />
myself is asked to come to make a speech, the school authorities<br />
give him the book of the words, containing all sorts of strange<br />
information about the school I realised, with that eagle eye<br />
that characterises a politician that the Headmaster and I became<br />
Head masters ourselves in the same year. He became Headmaster<br />
of King's;. and I became Headmaster of Australia -in the same<br />
year, in 1939. But what gives him that almost unconscious air of<br />
authority as he speaks to us today derives from the fact that<br />
he's never been found out, and his term of service has been<br />
continuous. ( Laughter)<br />
Sir, I just want to take off one thing that you have<br />
said which has been very mauch in my own mind.<br />
It isn't easy for a school that has history, for a<br />
school that has Old boys who think back to the Old School, and<br />
the old school buildings, to make a departure and to move to some<br />
other area. You mentioned Scotch College in Melbourne) cramped<br />
in to about half a city block with a cricket ground two milbs<br />
away. It was an adventure when it was finally decided to move<br />
it out into a big expanding site.<br />
I remember at another school in Melbourne gping along<br />
to lay a foundation stone, which I do occasionally, but not too </p>
<p>frequently, And I said, because I knew-this school very well,<br />
" I have never undorstood why you have a cricket ground and a<br />
half hero, in this place. Did you over own more land?"~. The<br />
answer was, " O0h, yes! W! o owned all1 the land for about two<br />
blocks. But some prudent Council at som~ e stage where there was<br />
a littic difficulty, said that we night as well " cash in"' on<br />
the extra land". The result was that they cramped, and almost<br />
crippled, the School that they wore supposed to govern.<br />
There are plenty of examples of this and I think that<br />
one of the reasons for this kind of thing wias that although our<br />
forefathers were great men, and laid profound foundations in<br />
Australia, there was a disposition perhaps it's net entirely<br />
gone yet to have wide geographical horizons in Australia, but<br />
somewhat narrow mental ones. This is something that we must<br />
beware of. If somebody today in a city like Canberra, for example,<br />
says, " WellI obviously this is going to be a University city,<br />
we must have plenty of space for buildings of the future" somebody<br />
is bound to say that this is extravagant.<br />
I don't believe that any provision of land for a great<br />
school or a great university was ever extravagant.<br />
Here I must say that I feel, as you do, tremendously<br />
excited to think that this most ancient of public schools in<br />
Australia should have taken this decision to move out where it<br />
will have elbow room, where it will have everything in the long<br />
run that goes with a groat school, not forgetting beauty and<br />
setting and illimitable prospects for the future. This I<br />
think, is a notable event, though I'm perfectly certain 1hat if<br />
I were an old King's School man I would have felt a little pang<br />
about the prospect; but I am sure that this has been a great<br />
thing. It is a very interesting matter to remember that just<br />
as the war was ending and taxation was very high much higher<br />
than it is now-but just at the end of the war when taxation was,<br />
really still on the war time level, I used to become troubled<br />
about the future of what we called the Great Public Schools, the<br />
great Church Schools, here and in my own State, and olsewhtere,<br />
because I believe in thenmost passionately.<br />
I believe that they contribute something which is the<br />
very reverse of snobbery which some of their critics like us to<br />
believe they contribute a superb spirit of humility, of<br />
understanding, of some of the relations between God and man.<br />
These great Church schools have a part to play in Australia that<br />
nothing else can play.<br />
And I thought, " Well, it's not going to be easy for<br />
people to send their sons to their own old schools, or to send<br />
the son to one of these foundations, because of the high level of<br />
taxation". Of course taxation has never g,' ne back to anything<br />
remotely resembling pro-war conditions. Yet the fact is that in<br />
these last 10 or 15 years we have seen the greatest era of<br />
development in schools of this kind that Australia ever saw.<br />
This proves what? I think that it proves that more and<br />
more we have people in Australia who see the value of this, and<br />
who are determined that their children are g-oing to secure some<br />
benefit from it.<br />
I think it is not for nothing that this property owns a<br />
Scots name. This argues a decent ambition on the part of the<br />
Church of England which I am3 happy to record. ( Laughter) Here<br />
is a Scots name, even though I learned, with regret, that the<br />
Captain of the School was called Dalzidl, when obviously he was<br />
" De-ell". ( Laughter) </p>
<p>May I say something about the Scots? You will permit<br />
reoa little bilotry. uronl't you on this rrz--GQ cots<br />
always had a groat notion of 1) tiL They had a great .11,<br />
that each generation in a family, however humble should have<br />
some opportunity that the previous generation didn't have. So<br />
that the son of the ploughman went to a secondary school and got<br />
a little better educated, and learned a little bit of Latin in<br />
those good days when people had to learn Latin and the grandson<br />
went to Edinburgh and took a degree.<br />
This was a passionate belief in education. And I'm as<br />
proud as Lucifer to think that in this post-war period which<br />
could have been, in some ways has been, materialist, we have<br />
seen this passion for education grow in Australia in the most<br />
remarkable fashion. What we are doing today is to celebrate one<br />
manifestation of it.<br />
Now I wonder if, with your kind permission I might<br />
address a few brief words to my fellow students. The rest of you<br />
are under no obligation to listen to this; though I regret that,<br />
because if this were a political meeting 90% of you wouldn't be<br />
here. ( Laughter) The Headmaster has said some good and memorable things<br />
to all of us about courage, the groat virtue. Courage which is<br />
not only the courage of the hand, but the courage of the heart<br />
and the courage of the mind. It is very easy to agree with<br />
everybody else, it is very easy to have your thinking done at<br />
second hand so that you wait until somebody writes what his<br />
thoughts may be and then you say, " There you are, those are my<br />
thoughts". Thinking is frightfully hard work. But it is the most<br />
rewarding work in the world. Thinking with all the hard work that<br />
goes with it, preceding it, preceding the point of judgment, to<br />
narrow the facts, to be prepared to look them in the eye, not to<br />
be led away by some cheap argument on the sidb but to hammer it<br />
out for youself. This is one of the great qualities of man.<br />
I strongly recommend it to myself as well as to my follow student.<br />
My old school in Melbourne had a motto, " Dare to be<br />
wise" and when I was a boy I thought, " What an odd proverb that<br />
is". I've come to know how true it is. Because to be wise, that<br />
is to say to be able to form a judgment, and stand to it, requires<br />
courage. It requires daring though many people perhaps<br />
don't always appreciate it.<br />
The second thing I want to say to you is this. We are<br />
very clever nowadays it's a very clever generation. People<br />
fire things off into the air, and one of them is credibly<br />
reported to have hit the moon though what the moon ever did to<br />
deserve this, I've never been able, quite, to discover. But it's<br />
a very clever period of life, and we must be a little careful<br />
that we don't become overwhelmed by our own cleverness. Because<br />
wisdom is more than cleverness.<br />
One of the troubles about this clever period of life<br />
is that we have a tendency all of us, to think that we know so<br />
much better than anybody else, and we are the cleverest generation<br />
over to live in Australia though I don't think we are, but<br />
we occasionally think we are that we fall into error, we become<br />
a little brash, we brush aside other people's views. We fall<br />
into bad manners, to put it simply.<br />
I'm not at all sure that the standard of manners, of<br />
courtesy, has improved so much in the last twenty years as the<br />
standard of objective knowledge. </p>
<p>Therefore, I want to say that no man was ever an inferior man<br />
bccause he had good manners because he had the courtesy which<br />
recognises that there are o~ her people in the world and that<br />
those other people may have other views.<br />
That doesn't mean that you are not to fight hard to<br />
convince then. That doesn't mean that you are to avoid conflict<br />
about ideas. You can't avoid conf'lict unless you run away.<br />
Therefore right through your lives you may be engaged in the<br />
clash of ideas, in the clash of personalities. But above all<br />
things, let us have that deg-ree of tolerance which is eribodied in<br />
the idea of courtesy and 200od rnanners. It will be a very much<br />
happier world if we can all corie up to that.<br />
In the third place I would just like to say this. I<br />
said it somewhere else the other day but Dean Pitt has given me<br />
express permission to repeat it.<br />
Good speech, clear speech, speech which pays a just<br />
attention to the meaning, of words is tremendously important.<br />
There are men here this afternoon I've seen a few if them who<br />
run, or have run vast concerns in Australia. They know<br />
perfectly well that if they didn't have the faculty of conveying<br />
their ideas justly, and clearly to those who work under them,<br />
they could not be effuctive in Lheir positions.<br />
In the modern period of life some of the very greatest<br />
Generals and Cormmanders have become groat Generals and<br />
Commanders, not only because they had a certain genius for the<br />
military art, but because they were advocates, theyod explain<br />
ideas and do them clearly with economy and Aith justice.<br />
Therefore, nothing annoys me more than to hear people<br />
who ought to know bettor I'm now still talking to the boys<br />
say, " Well, you know what I mean, you know what I mean", when<br />
I really don't know what they mean.<br />
In quarters not frightfully far removed from me I have<br />
had occasionally to say, " I'm sorry I've not had the advantage of<br />
studying Hottentot, would you mind speaking ordinary English".<br />
Now, Sir, I think the Girls' Schools : live us an<br />
example on this matter, because I do think, so far as I have<br />
been able to see, that they pay some attention to it.<br />
What I want to' say to the boys is this. This is a<br />
wonderful language of ours. There is no language in the world<br />
that has such flexibility, that has such -, reat literary stores<br />
in it, the greatest language of poetry that man has ever known,<br />
the great language of proseo. It raay lack some of the kick of<br />
French prose, but it is a marvellous language. It has contained<br />
some of the greatest writing, and somie of the greatest speech<br />
in history. Let us respectthis languag-e. Don't let us have it<br />
broken down by all sorts of cheap importations there are bound<br />
to be one or two. Let us respect this langua 7e. Because, I<br />
tell you that as you go through life, whether you are a lawyer,<br />
or a chemist, or a doctor, or a soldier, or whatever it may be,<br />
som~ e element of your success, some aspect of your capacity to<br />
give expression to what you know, will depend upon your respect<br />
for the English lang3uage and your quiet cor. u. mand over it. Not<br />
long words long words are pretty silly: they are used as a<br />
rule only by people who don't understand them.<br />
Aima at simple, clear speech, and if you aim at that<br />
and achieve it, you will find that this will make a very great<br />
difference right through your lives. </p>
<p>Now Sir, it's quite clear, as is already obvious, that<br />
I an talking too long and I an therefore * ping to bring this<br />
lanentablo lucubration long wrords boys ( Laughter) to an end.<br />
But I do want to say that I wias delighted to be given the<br />
opportunity of coning here. I know what a jreat event this is<br />
in the history of this fanous school, and it is a very great<br />
honour to have been allowed to share it. ( Applause) </p>
