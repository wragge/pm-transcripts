FOR PRESS Pi. m No. 21/ 1964<br />
SOUTHERN RHODESIA<br />
Satementb_ yth e PriJme Minjstej tbe t. Hon. Sir LQbert Menzies<br />
The Prime Minister, Sir Robert Menzies, said<br />
today that he had sent to the British Prime Minister, Mr,<br />
Harold Wilson, a message assuring him of Aus-ralia's full<br />
support for the British Government's recent statement warning<br />
Southern Rhodesia of the serious consequences that would<br />
follow a unilateral declaration of independence, and for the<br />
British Government's efforts to bring the most difficult<br />
problem of Southern Rhodesia to a successful outcome.<br />
He very much hoped that it would be possible<br />
to avoid a unilateral declaration of independence by the<br />
Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesia, which would precipitate<br />
various undesirable consequences that Commonwealth leaders<br />
had all striven to avoid.<br />
CANBERRA, October, 1964.<br />
