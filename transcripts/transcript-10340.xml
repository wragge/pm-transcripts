14 May 1997 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
RADIO INTERVIEW WiTH MIK( E JEFFRIES 2GB<br />
E O E<br />
JEFFRIES: Now, the Premier Bob Carr says you are letting down the people of the Hunter region<br />
by not coming to the party with $ 10 million worth of federal money. What do you<br />
say? PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, he's wrong. And he wasn't properly advised about what I said in the Parliament<br />
this afternoon. What I said was that I didn't agree with how he wanted to spend the<br />
money but that the federal government would provide the same resources, that's at<br />
least $ 10 million towards a programme of easing the transitional impact of the BE?<br />
decision on the Hunter Valley. At no stage did I say we weren't prepared to help. I<br />
merely said that we weren't going to automatically endorse with commonwealth<br />
money Mr Carr's particular proposal and I would ask Mr Carr to sort of stop any<br />
political point scoring. If he were really interested in the welfare of the people of<br />
Newcastle he would have rung me before going public and said precisely what has<br />
happened. Now, we are prepared to help. We don't think what Mr Carr has proposed<br />
is the most efficient way of spending either the money under his control or the money<br />
under my control and we also think BUP should make a bigger contribution. Now, I'll<br />
be talking to the company about that but this is not something where Mrt Carr as the<br />
Labor Premier of NSW and John Howard as the Liberal Prime Minister of Australia<br />
should be pitted against each other, we should be working together. He came to see<br />
me the other day, I listened to what he had to say, I said I'd consider it, I took an<br />
answer in the Parliament today, I said we would mnatch the commitment of the NSW<br />
government but we wanted to do it in a different way and I wanted to discuss that<br />
matter with him.<br />

JEFFRIES: At this stage now according to the AAP stories I've seen on it this afternoon, you are<br />
saying that his plan is not clear cut, but you don't have a clear cut plan either do you?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, the important thing I wanted to clear up is his allegation that we are not prepared<br />
to make any resources available and the second thing I'd say is that it will be two years<br />
before the main impact of the retrenchments in Newcastle is felt, and if we are sensible<br />
we will take a few weeks, talk to each other and work out the most intelligent and<br />
efficient way of spending the monley that is going to be made available.<br />
JEFFR[ ES:<br />
Well, how much money will you make available?<br />
PRIME MINISTER;<br />
Well, we have said we will match the $ 10 million.<br />
JEFFRLES: Right, so you'll definitely make that 10 million?<br />
PRIME MINSTER:<br />
I said that, I made that clear in the Parliament and Mr Carr has either been badly<br />
advised or he has deliberately misrepresented my position. Now, I understand the<br />
problem, it's not an easy thing and it shouldn't be something for a whole lot of wild<br />
political point scoring so we don't agree with the proposal that Mr Carr has. We<br />
believe in talking to each other we can develop a better way of doing it, I have eight<br />
available.., my major projects facilitator to see if there are some major projects that<br />
could benefit the Hunter Valley, it will take a few weeks to work out the most<br />
intelligent way of spending the resources that are going to be made available but it<br />
shouldn't be something where Mr Carr and I try and score points off each other, that<br />
really is quite unintelligent and not something that the people of Newcastle would<br />
appreciate. JEFFRIES: Well of course several of Mr Carr's senior colleagues do have constituencies in that<br />
area so they are probably applying a bit of pressure. </p>

PRIME MINISTER:<br />
But there is a Liberal Senator based in Newcastle Senator Tierney, and Liberal Party<br />
holds a seat in the Hunter Valley, but it is not a question of whether they are Liberal or<br />
Labor Members, we are talking about the fu~ ture of Australians and that's what I am<br />
interested in, and it can't be something that is just a knee-jerk political exercise. Mr<br />
Carr camne to me with a proposal. Before he announced it, he didn't consult me before<br />
he announced it, he just wanted me to sign up with his proposal. I've had a look at his<br />
proposal, I don't think it is the most intelligent way to spend 25 or $ 30 million. And<br />
what I've said is that wevwili match the NSW government but we want to do it in a<br />
different way, we want to talk to them about how it is done and we want to encourage<br />
BHIP to put in more. Now, that is a sensible response and I reject completely Mr<br />
Carr's attempt to say that we are disinterested.<br />
JEFFRIES: Mr Howard, I do appreciate your time today, I do have the Premier on the line, so I'll<br />
get his response.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Thank you. </p>
