THE PRIM4E MINISTER'S PRESS CONFERENCE<br />
PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA<br />
TUESDAY, 19 JUNE 1973<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Ladies and gentlemen: There has been no<br />
Cabinet committee meetings this week. Yesterday, today and<br />
tomorrow we are holding these economic consultations with industry.<br />
I thought it might suit you if I were to have this press conference<br />
at noon, well before lunch, so that the afternoon papers could<br />
get their turn. I have no announcements to give you. Last week<br />
Mr. Jack Fingleton asked me about the cost of cable communications<br />
between India and Australia and I said I would find out what was<br />
the basis for it. I haven't yet got the information I want.<br />
Are there any questions?<br />
Q. Now that you have finally got the invitation to Washington,<br />
can you tell us just what you hope to raise in your talks with<br />
Mr. Nixon and what you hope to achieve while you are over there?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I have no further information to give you on<br />
thismatter.<br />
Q. Two of your most senior ministers, over the last couple of<br />
days, have had differing views on tax increases. Dr. Cairns<br />
says he will press in the Cabinet Budget talks for tax increases<br />
to correct any inequality in education and health. Yesterday<br />
Mr. Crean said that Labor's major electoral promises will be<br />
honoured and he would not increase taxes to pay for the promises.<br />
Will you give unequivocal support to Mr. Crean's declaration about<br />
tax increases?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: What I said in the policy speech stands.<br />
Q. I would like to bring up the question of Cuba which we<br />
discussed at the press conference last week. I questioned<br />
Marshall Green about this the new United States Ambassador<br />
at the National Press Club and he said: " We and others should<br />
expand dialogue and negotiations with other powers". And then<br />
specifically on Cuba he said: " I don't see from my remarks<br />
that I have just made now that there would be any intimation<br />
that we are protesting against any other country opening dialogue<br />
with each other; on the contrary it seems to me that was the<br />
very point I was making". In view of these remarks might<br />
deference to America still be a factor in our relations with Cuba<br />
or absence of relations with Cuba or diplomatic or consular<br />
representation? PRIME MINISTER: Australia and Cuba have always recognised each<br />
other. There is no diplomatic or consular representations<br />
by either country in the other country. But it is all a question<br />
of priorities and the Caribbean has not hitherto been an area<br />
of great diplomatic or consular priorities as far as Australia<br />
is concerned. We will be getting some representations there.<br />
All the countries in the Caribbean belong either to the<br />
Commonwealth or the organisation of American States and I would<br />
expect that in my visits to Mexico and the United States and<br />
Canada, I might discuss the augmentation of our diplomatic or<br />
consular representations in the Caribbean. That is the context<br />
in which you have to regard Cuba. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
Q. Did you think that Mr. Hamer and Sir Robert Askin are<br />
justified in claiming a victory in London? Do you feel that a<br />
referendum may be necessary to solve this question?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: You are referring to the abolition of appeals<br />
to the PrivyCouncil? Well, I would be happy to know what their<br />
attitudes are to this question of abolishing appeals to the<br />
Privy Council. I don't believe that any contemporary political<br />
leader in Australia would resist the abolition of appeals to the<br />
Privy Council. How it is done is not so important, as the fact<br />
that it be done.<br />
Q. When you say " how it is done is not as important as it be<br />
done". Well they don't like the way that you are doing it.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well, what do they suggest?<br />
Q. Well, do you have any alternatives?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well, I would be happy to consider any alternative<br />
that they propose. The fact is that the Labor Party has been<br />
committed to the abolition of appeals to the Privy Council since<br />
1908. This is a very long-standing political commitment, and I<br />
suppose the Liberals might claim one of their paragons as Prime<br />
Minister was Alfred Deakin. Alfred Deakin was against continuing<br />
appeals to the Privy Council back at the end of last century.<br />
You remember the discussions that he and other Australian<br />
leaders had with Joe Chamberlain the one of two generations ago,<br />
not the present one on this very question. That is, I would<br />
imagine that since before the first World War every significant<br />
political leader in Australia has been in favour of abolishing<br />
appeals to the Privy Council. Now I am quite happy to discuss<br />
any alternatives that Mr. Hamer and Sir Robert Askin suggest.<br />
Q. When would you do this?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Whenever they like. Whenever they suggest.<br />
Q. Next week, Sir?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: If they like to suggest to discuss it at the<br />
Premiers' Conference, I would be very happy to do it. It is<br />
really an absurd anomalv that we should still have the possibility<br />
of appeals or petitions to the British Privy Council and this has<br />
been a matter of great diversion over the last couple of weeks<br />
here and over in Britain.<br />
Q. Can I take it from that that you are quite prepared to<br />
reconsider the approach which you outlined to us in London?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well, let us see what suggestions they make<br />
about it. A lot of suggestions are made about referendums on<br />
this question. I would have thought anybody following British<br />
politics in the last couple of years would have noticed that Mr.<br />
Heat1N in particular, asserts the responsibility of Government to<br />
make up their minds in these matters not to seek the referendum<br />
to decide issues. That was the whole issue on which he was so<br />
resolute, you remember, on Britain's joining the Common Market.<br />
Governments ought to make decisions on this matter. </p>
<p>-3-Association<br />
Q. Sir, the Associated Chambers of Manufacturers/ yesterday<br />
made some very dire forecaslt about the expected rate of inflation.<br />
Have you any comments on their forecasts and have you had any<br />
alternatives on forecasts from the Treasury of the rate of increase<br />
of the consumer index maybe?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, and no.<br />
Q. I understand that you recently had a letter from the acting<br />
Queensland Premier, Mr. Gordon Chalk, asking in effect how<br />
Aboriginals will be better off under federal control than State<br />
control. Could you say what is the core of the disagreement<br />
between the federal and State Governments on this matter?<br />
If the Queensland Government won't co-operate with the federal<br />
Government, are you going to need enabling legislation?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The Queensland Government takes a paternal<br />
attitude. The Australian Government takes a fraternal attitude<br />
on this matter. Six years ago, overwhelmingly the Australian<br />
people at a referendum gave the Australian Parliament the<br />
authority to pass laws concerning the Aboriginal people, the<br />
people of the Aboriginal race. My Government proposes to introduce<br />
appropriate legislation in the Australian Parliament to promote<br />
the welfare of people of the Aboriginal race. There is one matter<br />
on which neither Mr. Bjelke Petersen or Mr. Gordon Chalk have yet<br />
replied to in correspondence. It is now over six months old.<br />
It concerns the repeal of the discriminatory provisions of the<br />
Aboriginal and island affairs legislation of the Queensland<br />
parliament. The view is, and it is a view expressed by our<br />
predecessors as well as by us, that this legislation is in<br />
conflict with the 1965 international convention for the<br />
elimination of racial discrimination. We propose,-. in the<br />
Budget session, to bring in legislation to implement that<br />
convention and this will enable us to override the Queensland<br />
legislation. In other words, we will be carrying out another<br />
undertaking Mr. Gorton made over three years ago.<br />
Q. In answer to an earlier question, I understood you to say<br />
there would be no increase in taxation in the next Budget.<br />
In reply to a question from Tony Thomas, you said'no" in both<br />
cases. The second part of his question, as I understood it,<br />
was about....<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Whether there was a Treasury estimate as to the<br />
rate of increase in the consumer price index? And, I said " no" to<br />
that question.<br />
Q. Well, I was just wondering in this context if you haven't<br />
got any forecasts of the economy, how can you at this stage make a<br />
promise about no increase in taxatio n? Does this mean that<br />
irrespective of the rate of inflation or rate of inflation<br />
forecast, that there will not be any increase in taxation?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Will I read what I said in my policy speech?<br />
I said it stands.<br />
Q. Given that there may be high levels of economic inefficiency<br />
in the expansion of Australian defence industries, will you see that<br />
any proposals to expand Australian defence industries are first<br />
referred to the Protection Commission? </p>
<p>-4-<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No. You've asked questions and I have given<br />
you an answer.<br />
Q. I am asking you a second question. Why not?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I gave an undertaking that we will develop<br />
certain basic industries in Australia and among those I think<br />
mentic ned was light aricraft, fighter aircraft, rolling stock,<br />
pipelines and so on. These are commitments we want to establishbasic<br />
industries in Australia for which we know there will always<br />
be a demand by Australian Governments or Australian companies.<br />
Q. Sir, Why is it<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I am not going to assume that Australian<br />
defence industries are inefficient.<br />
Q. Why not look at it and see if they are?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well they have not, in general, been given a<br />
ch~ ance. I don't think for instance, one could say that the<br />
Mirage program was inefficient.<br />
Q. Why is the additional production of Nomad been limited to<br />
aircraft when as Dr. Cairns said yesterday<br />
PRIME MINISTER: There has been no decision on the Nomad aircraft.<br />
Q. So it may not be 50 aircraft?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: There has been no decision on the Nomad aircraft.<br />
Q. Mr. Ducker, the New South Wales President of the branch of<br />
your party has some rather strongly worded remarks today to make<br />
about a group within your branch. Do you agree with his statement?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't comment on organisational matters.<br />
Q. Do you have a particular view on this matter a personal view<br />
on this matter?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No.<br />
Q. Could you tell us why not, Sir?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I will deal with this within the organs of the<br />
party if it arises.<br />
Q. Do you have any comment on the current dispute in the motor<br />
industry, and do you see a role for the Commonwealth Government<br />
in bringing the dispute to an end?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I am considering this just at the moment. It is<br />
a bit premature for me to say anything about this.<br />
Q. Will you be recalling Mr. Cameron from overseas?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Certainly not.<br />
Q. In the context of your proposed visit to America, are you<br />
embarrassed at all about the remarks made by Senator Wheeldon<br />
belittling the ANZUB pact? </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: I don't comment gentlemen on reports or<br />
interviews that my colleagues give or opponents give. You<br />
know this.<br />
Q. What action could the Federal Government give if any<br />
in the Ford dispute?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I am not sure.<br />
Q. At the special Premiers' Conference last month, you sent<br />
a joint Commonwealth/ State committee to investigate ways to<br />
solve the problem of inflation. Could you tell us whether<br />
that committee would be in a position to present a final<br />
report to the Premiers Conference?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I expect so.<br />
Q. Two issues. When could you expect an announcement by the<br />
Federal Government on the future of the export incentives<br />
scheme?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: In about 9 months.<br />
Q. This would be about three months before it expires?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The decision has been made and announced.<br />
Q. Yes, to continue to June 1974.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes that is right. To continue the present<br />
one until -theen d of next financial year.<br />
Q. Yes, I was talking about...<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No. I am only guessing when we will make a<br />
statement, but I would not imagine we would resolve this matter<br />
before the end of 1973.<br />
Q. The other one. Have you seen the report of Sir John Crawford?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No.<br />
Q. When do you expect to do so?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I think next week.<br />
Q. How soon after will it be published?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: All reports in the normal course are released<br />
very promptly.<br />
Q. Will the Coombs Task Force...<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, that's in a Budget context. I hope that that<br />
will be published with the Budget papers. No, but you can understand<br />
you don't expect us to...<br />
0. You answered it. If ever it was going to be published and<br />
you've said you hoped it will be published.. </p>
<p>-6<br />
PRIME MINISTER: My present inclination would be to table<br />
the Task Force report with the Budget papers on the 21st<br />
of August. But we wouldn't publish that before the Budget.<br />
Q. On the question of the export incentives which Mr.<br />
Hawke raised. Have you changed the position you adopted in<br />
Cabinet when this matter was discussed earlier this year?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No.<br />
Q. That the export incentives should be phased out?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Phased out?<br />
A. Phased out.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I thought that they should have been ended.<br />
Tha-t is the present scheme. I mean I am not committed against<br />
forms of export incentives. What I don't like is the present<br />
one which is the atrociously expensive one. An export incentive<br />
scheme shouldn't be a perennial. Certainly we ought to encourage<br />
Australians to export their resources, their skills, or to establish<br />
a foothold for them overseas, particularly in our region. There<br />
is a very good case to establish export links but there can be<br />
very little case for keeping on a scheme for ever. The present<br />
one is too unimaginative, too rigid, no longer relevant. But the<br />
situation we inherited, as you realise, was that the scheme was<br />
expiring at the end of this month and while the Australian Labor<br />
Party had never committed itself to continue the scheme, by the<br />
time we got around to considering it that's about three months<br />
ago it would have been rather short notice to let it expire<br />
at the end of June. I wouldn't have minded it going to the end<br />
of December. In fact it has been extended until the end of June<br />
next year. There was a proposal, which our predecessors made at<br />
the 11th hour, that it should be extended for another five years.<br />
That didn't get much shrift. We will hope to review this matter<br />
but you can't really review it until the Budget has been, brought<br />
in.<br />
Q. When you spoke in Adelaide the other day you said that,<br />
quite rightly, we were subsidising motor vehicle exports to<br />
South Africa. Do you have any figure to the extent to which<br />
we are subsidising exports to South Africa under the incentive<br />
scheme?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No I haven't. There is difficulty. I think<br />
the law in fact prevents the publication of taxation figures such<br />
as this.<br />
Q. But that would only be for individuals. You can aggregate.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes, but a company is an individual.<br />
Q. Yes, but I mean aggregate of exports to South Africa.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: You are asking me to ascertain and to state how<br />
much the Australian taxpayer subsidises the export of Holdens<br />
and Fords and Chryslers and Leylands to South Africa. I suppose<br />
you are right there. You could if there were several makes being<br />
exported to South Africa. I suppose one could ascertain the sum<br />
total of the subsidies the taxpayer makes on thoseexports. </p>
<p>-7-<br />
One could not of course, under the law, disclose what the<br />
subsidies by the taxpayer are for any individual motor company.<br />
I don't know how many motor car companies do export to South Africa.<br />
But as it is we pay the taxpayer pays about $ 100,000,000<br />
a year for various forms of export incentives, market development<br />
overseas and there are very great competing claims on the taxpayer<br />
and the present scheme, in my view, my strong view, does not<br />
deserve $ 100,000,000 a year at the expense of competing claims<br />
on the taxpayer.<br />
Q. Have you any clear agenda items for the Premiers' Conference<br />
at the end of next week. Apart from the important financial<br />
dispersement and Loan Council matters. For example, is it clear<br />
yet whether, apart from the question of the Privy Council raised<br />
earlier and perhaps inflation, would city transport, railways,<br />
off-shore resources constitute any...<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't think off-shore I don't think<br />
off-shore resources is listed. I haven't got the list in front<br />
of me. Nobody has so far asked for abolition of Privy Council<br />
appeals or off-shore resources legislation to be listed. I think<br />
I'm right in saying that. And the other matters you mentioned:<br />
they're listed if my memory is but in particular we will be<br />
wanting to discuss welfare, housing and education.<br />
Q. The Torres Strait islanders who were down here last week<br />
are very concerned that there should be no drilling for oil in<br />
the Torres Strait...<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes.<br />
Q. Have you a view on this and have you a view on their other<br />
concern about no movement of the border?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't believe that drilling in the Torres<br />
Strait shouldc be permitted until it is quite established that it<br />
can be done with safety that there can be no harm to the<br />
environment. I was able to remind the visitors from the Torres<br />
Strait islands that it w-4s the Queensland Government that was<br />
in favour of drilling in Torres Strait and the vicinity of the<br />
Great Barrier Reef. It was the Australian Government that<br />
successfully resisted and frustrated those proposals. It was<br />
the Gorton Government which prevailed on the Queensland Government<br />
to establish Royal Commissions, which are still sitting, into<br />
this matter. It was the Australian Government which safeguarded<br />
the Torres Strait and the Great Barrier Reef environments. The<br />
Queensland Government would have run the risk of spoiling the<br />
environment. The question of the border is a matter which I hope<br />
the Torres Strait islanders will discuss with the Papua New Guineans.<br />
I am not too sure to what extent I should say what we discussed<br />
because I believe it was a private gathering. I am quite hopeful<br />
that there will now at last be discussions. I pointed out<br />
that the Australian Government could only help to bring such<br />
discussions about until the end of November, because after that<br />
Papua New Guinea will be self-governing. </p>
<p>-8-<br />
Q. Is the Government still happy with the rigid nexus between<br />
the Australian and American dollars? It seems to be producing<br />
some arbitrary result if the American dollar...<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I'm not going to speculate on the currency.<br />
When we change the parity it will come as a great surprise, and<br />
it will be a very well kept secret until we change it.<br />
Q. Is breaking the link....<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I am not going to speculate on things like that,<br />
pl-ease.<br />
Q. The General Motors Holden appointment of an American to<br />
run their Australian operations. Do you have any views on this?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes.<br />
Q. What are they?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I think the appointment was very ill-timed.<br />
And I have no doubt that their sales will suffer as a consequence.<br />
Q. It seems that the first French explosion is immenent. Is<br />
there any decision on when the Australian ship may leave for that<br />
area? PRIME MINISTER: No. There has been no change in the decision<br />
which was already announced on that matter.<br />
Q. You must wait for the New Zealand move first?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well, there is no change in what~ we announced.<br />
Q. Will the Commonwealth Government see that G. M. H. does suffer<br />
through this appointment?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No. The Australian public will draw their own<br />
conclusions about this.<br />
Q. But in the purchase of cars for the Australian Government?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, will we buy I should imagine the present<br />
rules apply. We'll buy the car on which we get the best deal.<br />
Q. On this question of the dispute in New South Wales, you<br />
said... PRIME MINISTER: No, well I'm not going to comment at this<br />
press conference on this. I'm not going to promote....<br />
Q. Unclear.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well if you don't mind, I'm not going to<br />
pursue it.<br />
Q. After we have gained control of North West Cape, should<br />
the United States seek permission to send a signal to fire<br />
nuclear weapons. Will you always say no?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: This is hypothetical, isn't it? </p>
