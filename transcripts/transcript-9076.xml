ADDRESS AT INFORMAL LUNCH FOR THE -WORK FOR AUSTRALIA!<br />
TASK FORCE, THE LODGE, SUNDAY, 12 DECEMBER 1993<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
Distinguished guests, first of all could I say that Annita and I are delighted to<br />
have you here and thanks very much for coming. We wanted to record two<br />
things; one, the fact that so much effort and so much goodwill was invested in<br />
the jobs program coming through 1992 and 1993 from the jobs summit of last<br />
year and to thank each of every one of you and those not here who were<br />
involved in the success of making so many of these programs work.... and to<br />
focus now on the questions of regional development and the Task Force<br />
report which Bill Keity has chaired and which he will present next Thursday.<br />
In the last year, of course, during 1992 when we held the jobs summit it was<br />
probably at the depths of one's hopes and aspirations for the economy and<br />
for the labour market, and particularly for young people, And, we've sought to<br />
find ways to make that transition from school to work, for young people, via a<br />
program of enhanced training. Not just higher retention rates in schools<br />
and that itself, I think, is very important because it needs to be remembered<br />
that just ten years ago just under three -kids in ten completed secondary<br />
school and that's now just under nine in ten... and that's a revolution in<br />
education. And we've now added the equivalent of about 15 universities to<br />
the system since 1986 and we're streaming those kids 40% of the output of<br />
our secondary education system goes through into the universitites and now,<br />
in 1992 at the time of One Nation, we also focused upon the development of<br />
the thing we've probably lacked most in Australian education and that was an<br />
expanded and revamped technical and further education system; a<br />
comprehensive system of national vocational education for those kids who<br />
are not going to qualify themselves for a tertiary institution but who wish to<br />
get vocational qualifications which stand and will stand them in good stead<br />
and which will be recognised across Australia.<br />
And, so, with those two things the higher participation rate, the streaming<br />
through university and also for those who drop out earlier than the<br />

2<br />
completion of secondary school to take them through a school-to-work<br />
training transition. And for that, of course, we've had great support from not<br />
just employers but from the ACTU and the constituent unions in trying to build<br />
the institutional arrangements to let that happen. led like to pay tribute here to<br />
Bill. Kelty for his work, but more than that, his great view of the country and his<br />
commitment to working people and particularly young people, into the<br />
bargain. And also to Lindsay Fox who joined with him in going around talking<br />
to regional Australia and seeing if they could find the jobs which we know,<br />
basically, are there, and where we could exploit the labour market programs<br />
which the Commonwealth had set up in 1988-89 and in 1990 and in the One<br />
Nation statement of 1992.<br />
It's one thing having these programs, it's another thing having them used,<br />
having them taken up so that people understand they're there and that<br />
acutally, particularly for small business, we can do so much with them. It's<br />
been a fact of this period of recession that we've been through a productivity<br />
surge; and that's another way of saying we've got more output from fewer<br />
people. And we've seen very large lay-offs in industrial companies and that<br />
had, of course, a debilitating effect upon the labour market<br />
As we are now starting to see the economy pick up, I think this is something<br />
really to rejoice in because we do have growth now running at about 3.25 per<br />
cent, we are growing as fast as any other OECD economy, we have 100,000<br />
job growth in the last three months and we are starting to see some of the<br />
hints of the kind of recovery we had in 1983-84 in the labour market. That is,<br />
we are starting to see some of that stronger job growth coming through. And<br />
as you know, those of you who have been involved in these programs, it<br />
makes all the world of difference in being able to leaven up the labour market<br />
with some really new employment there and despite the efforts of people like<br />
yourselves who have put young people on and give them training and work<br />
experience to make that transition to permanent work and already you have<br />
told me, so many of you today, that a high proportion of those who have gone<br />
into the programs have actually found permanent work, they have been good<br />
employees. It makes it so much easier with labour markets that much<br />
stronger. And so I think that is happening now and there is no substitute for<br />
growth. In which ever way one looks at employment, there is no substitute for<br />
growth. And the essence of the Accord which Bill Kelly and I had so much to do with<br />
from ten years ago was in fact an implicit deal, wage restraint for employment<br />
and the wage restraint of the ' 80$ was taken up in more employment so that<br />
today even with the unemployment we've had Australia has 26 per cent<br />
growth in the work force over 1983 which is still quite a spectacular figure.<br />
So it means that more people in households are in work than would have<br />
been without Government policy focussing explicitly on growth.<br />
I know that people say that all governments are in favour of growth, well yes<br />
they are, but they don't set up the policies for growth. Most of the European<br />
economies have not been in favour of growth, they have been in favour of<br />

<p>TEL 1. e 9 : 2N. 0 .8<br />
3<br />
firstly of low inflation and growth has been secondary and employment has<br />
come way behind and they have now got 17 million unemployed people in<br />
Europe. Now, we never took this policy in Australia. We actually went for<br />
growth until we couldn't procure it particularly with the recession and the<br />
International recession which was built around it.<br />
But, always we have been about growing the economy faster and we are now<br />
starting to see the economy accelerate and as it accelerates the link between<br />
growth and jobs which has always been there is reappearing again. But, that<br />
Is not to say that that will deal with those who are lo ng-term unemployed,<br />
those who have fallen to the bottom of the labour market or who have been<br />
unemployed for twelve months or more, that have lost their self esteem, that<br />
have lost their skills, they have lost their place and they are the people we<br />
said in the election campaign we wouldn't forget and a day before Bill<br />
presents his report we'll have the Employment Task Force report, the first<br />
such major inquiry since the Second World War into the labour market which<br />
we hope will focus some new directions on how we can bring the long-term<br />
unemployed back up and back into the mainstream of Australian society.<br />
Because we want to avoid things that happened In Europe and in countries<br />
like Britain where there is 10 or 11 per cent unemployment, but wage rates<br />
continue to rocket and you say; well, how can wage rates rocket when you<br />
have got a pool of unemployment and the answer is because they are<br />
sidelined they are out never to come back and the labour markets<br />
requirements are then met with new entrants to the work force, from schools,<br />
new people joining the labour market.<br />
So, we don't want that to happen and we do want to focus on those long-term<br />
unemployed and to bring them back into the main culture of Australian<br />
society, the economy and the labour market and that Is why the jobs<br />
programs are important, that's why the labour market programs are important,<br />
they are not in themselves job creation programs as much as they are things<br />
that find people who have been disadvantaged In the labour market or longterm<br />
unemployed and give them a chance to get work experience, self<br />
esteem and a permanent job.<br />
Now, In the ones which Bill . and Lindsay ( Fox) and you are focussed on are<br />
mainly for those who are young people those in that sort of 16 to 20 area<br />
who have never had the joy of being in employment and having that kind of<br />
independence. So, it was a problem of particular size and dimension and we<br />
have attacked that and Bill gave you the figures a moment ago that there are<br />
50,000 jobs there committed and 31,000 in place and that is a tremendous<br />
effort and I think that we should, while there is a lot of corporate effort here in<br />
the doing of that, just record the fact that Bill Kelty and Lindsay Fox were the<br />
prime movers in this coming from that jobs summit last year and they are to<br />
be congratulated for the hope and the joy they have given so many young<br />
people. The future now is how do we get the labour market moving again? How do<br />
we bring those who have been disadvantaged back into it? How do we build<br />

on the skills that we have? Because don't doubt for a moment that Australia<br />
has been through an absolute revolution in the way this economy is set up in<br />
the last ten years. We are more now outward looking, we are more confident,<br />
we now recognise what our strengths are more than we have ever done and<br />
as a consequence we are now building on those skills and those advantages<br />
and whien often the advantages are right under our nose we can't see them.<br />
But I think Australians now appreciate the particular advantages which we<br />
have and that we are out there to build upon them and to make them work<br />
and that is why we can see, I think, a greater future for regional areas in this<br />
country and regional Australia is so well represented here today and it has to<br />
be I think, to build on our comparative advantage; first of all to recognise it, to<br />
understand it, to build on it and to see where the regions of this country can<br />
find themselves in the national and international economy of the Asia-Pacific<br />
In particular. This we are doing and we are doing it not as successfully as we<br />
would like, but we have started I think, to understand that there are many<br />
diverse advantages and skills in regional Australia and that that is something<br />
to build upon.<br />
I look forward to the receipt of Bill's report next week to give us a chance to<br />
even up employment and business opportunities across Australia and to let<br />
the regions of Australia know that they are also part of the great economic<br />
change of the last ten years and the benefits will not simply be the preserve<br />
of the cities, but also of the regional areas.<br />
There is a new co-operative ethic In Australia, a productive and co-operative<br />
ethic which has come out of this, There is a sea change in business, I mean<br />
ten years ago what business wanted was more tariff protection, but when you<br />
look at the business environment today it something that hardly anybody in<br />
business ten years ago would have imagined. That was, we are 30 per cent<br />
more competitive than ten years ago; we have got an inflation rate of 2 per<br />
cent instead of 10 per cent; we have got a competitive exchange rate<br />
mechanism in place; we have got a 33 per cent corporate tax rate instead of<br />
46 per cent; we have got removal of the double tax on dividends so dividends<br />
are taxed only once, where in the ' 70s and early ' 80s we had debt taxed once<br />
and equity taxed twice now we have got debt taxed once and equity taxed<br />
once so we are really set up a good depreciation schedule and a very high<br />
profit share in the economy.<br />
So, all these things are there basically now to power investment along in a<br />
sustainable way and particularly now with the banking sector somewhat more<br />
experienced and more mature coming from the early days of financial market<br />
deregulation. We are going to see scarce national assets put in the right<br />
places this time rather than simply chasing inflation in property and other<br />
things and so when you look at the whole of that together, that tremendous<br />
mix and the fact that we are also not just set up for growth and investment<br />
and employment, but we are sitting in the area of the world that is growing<br />
most rapidly in the Asia-Pacific. And in that the Government in the last ten<br />
years has pursued the GATT Round which is now coming to a successful<br />
conclusion; where there will be about a $ 2.5 billion advantage for Australian<br />

<p>TEL: 13. Dec. 93 7: 12 No<br />
producers in world markets as a consequence of the GATT and then in the<br />
things the GA77 can't do In our immediate area we are setting up APEC<br />
Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation into an economic community-which will<br />
see Australia integrated for the first time in its commercial history truly<br />
integrated outside of empire preference which was a thing that powered us<br />
along in the late 19th Century and early 20th Century will be set up in the<br />
Asia-Pacific as an integral part, as a country integrated into it as never<br />
before. So, you took at the big market of the Asia-Pacific, our integration with it a<br />
really good fine texture in the GATT rules for agriculture, intellectual property,<br />
services and goods that gives us a good set of rules and dispute settling<br />
mechanisms to really power trade along and then look at our own economy<br />
per cent more competitive, low inflation, the lowest interest rates for<br />
years, a good fiscal scene; all of these things I think mean that Australia<br />
really can participate and the Australian economy can continue to change as<br />
it has been changing.<br />
This must spread through to the regions of this country and that this is an<br />
Inclusive change which involves the whole of the community and that means<br />
that nobody gets left out and that means particularly the young people, those<br />
who are young and unemployed, the long-term mature aged unemployed and<br />
the regions of Australia which have felt the pinch of the recession and<br />
unemployment even more cruelly than other parts of the country.<br />
So, we wanted to just record with you today, firstly our thanks for what you<br />
have done in dedicating yourselves to the work and happiness of so many<br />
young people who might not have otherwise found themselves in employment<br />
and the esteem which comes with it, for focussing on the problems of regional<br />
Australia and co-operating with Bill and Lindsay Fox in trying to articulate<br />
what they are, in articulating to the task force the problems and being able to<br />
communicate those to us so that as we focus on this coming Budget we can<br />
look at the reception of the Employment Task Force and the Regional<br />
Development Task Force reports, consider them in policy as a whole, as a<br />
totality at a time when the economy has got some natural lift in it and where<br />
the labour market is responding.<br />
So these are, I think, cause for hope that we can really do much better across<br />
the country, but particularly in regional terms next year and in the next couple<br />
of years as the economy really gets a spurt on.<br />
So could I again just thank you for coming. Annita and I are pleased to see<br />
you here at The Lodge to share this day with us and as I say to record our<br />
thanks for your commitment to young people, for the effort you made and to<br />
awaken employers who didn't know about the labour market programs, that<br />
they do exist and there Is real complement to them in terms of labour that Is<br />
available under these Commonwealth labour market programs. And, can I<br />
say again finally to Bill Kelty thank you Bill for your very unselfish efforts<br />
over the last 18 months on the road so many days in each week and so many .001 P. 10/ 11 </p>

6<br />
nights into regional Australia and with Lindsay who is not here at the moment,<br />
but may arrive later there are some great people on Australian business and<br />
they have stuck their neck out and they have made a great effort and I want<br />
to thank them too. But to those of you who are representing regional<br />
councils, regional institutions, companies, the CES, radio, television and<br />
other important areas of the regional economy, thank you ever so much for<br />
coming, we hope you enjoy the day and you will give me an enhanced<br />
opportunity to talk to you because while I get around the regions quite a bit,<br />
you can never get so many regions crowded into one place at one time as<br />
today and that is something I am looking forward to.<br />
Thank you. We will now complete our official speeches and we can go and<br />
have a lunch and have a pleasant talk together, thank you one and all. </p>
