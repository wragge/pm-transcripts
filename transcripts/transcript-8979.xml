TRANSCRIPT OF PRIME MINISTER, TEE HON. P. J. KEATING, MP., AT<br />
SYDNEY 2000 BID PRESS CONFERENCE<br />
MONTE CARLO, MONACO<br />
23 SEPTEMBER, 1993<br />
PM: Well, thank you John. Well, I think my congratulations go to the Bid team on<br />
the effort that they have established over a considerable period of time. And<br />
now, finally, the presentation which I think was an effective one, displaying as<br />
it has, Sydney as a very natural site for the Olympics with all the facilities<br />
largely complete, a great stock of hotel rooms and, of course, the great city<br />
itself. And, I think, also the fact that it portrayed that Australia is a sports<br />
loving country; and that people naturally participate in sports; and that the<br />
various elements of our presentation covered the breadth of the culture of<br />
Sydney and in a generic sense, Australia. Because in many respects here,<br />
while we are proposing the city of Sydney we really are proposing Australia as<br />
a nation as the host.<br />
So, I was delighted to be part of this presentation, as was Annita, and I can<br />
only sincerely hope that the presentation has been as effective as we hope it<br />
was. I said to some journalists earlier, its now in the ballot box and well wait<br />
and me what happens.<br />
J: Prime M'inster the big guns are really here in Monte Carlo today. It's fantastic<br />
to see so many famous people in one place. Could you spell out to me why this<br />
is so important to you, that you, like John Major, have to come here to Monte<br />
Carlo to sell Sydney to the International Olympic Committee.?<br />
PM: Well, I think, as I said in my opening remarks we're selling Sydney but also<br />
Australia in very much a national sense. And I think if one is serious about that<br />
fbr such an International sportin. pageant which the Olympics are, I think it's<br />
entirely appropriate that the headof government come and say that. And also<br />
make clear as we have, our financial support, etcetera, for the bid. I think this<br />
rounds out the confidence with which IOC members view any bid on a national<br />
bals. So, i'm not surprised that John Major is here, as I am. I just think he's<br />
got a tougher job of it than I have, that's all.<br />
Ends. 24. Sep. 93 7: 49 No. 00 </p>
