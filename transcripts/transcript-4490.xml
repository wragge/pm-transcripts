PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 13 SEPTEMBER 1977<br />
PRIME. MINISTER'SADDRESS AT. LUNCHEON FOR CHINESE PARLIAMENTARIANS<br />
I am very pleased to join with the President of the Senate and the<br />
Speaker of the House in welcoming our distinguished guests from<br />
the Peoples Republic of China.<br />
This visit marks an important step in the development of the<br />
history of relations between our two countries.<br />
This is the most senior delegation to visit Australia from the<br />
Peoples Republic of China, and this is the first time we have<br />
been visited by a member of the Politburo. This visit indicates<br />
the degree to which contacts are now developing between the Peoples<br />
Republic of China and the international community. For far too<br />
long a number of forces had arrested these contacts. This makes<br />
it even more important that we work to develop them now, and both<br />
our countries are doing so.<br />
The Peoples Republic of China is now Australia's fourth largest<br />
export market and our countries are exploring ways of expanding<br />
trading relationships further.<br />
Alongside this expanding trade relationship, there is growing<br />
contact across a broad range of interests. In recent months, there<br />
have been reciprocal visits by senior officials and Ministers.<br />
Mr. Hunt, the Minister for Health, visited China in June, and we<br />
have recently welcomed China's Vice Minister for Foreign Trade<br />
to Australia. Chinese journalists have visited Australia and<br />
arrangements have been made for a party of our journalists to<br />
visit China. A delegation from our Academy of Science has visited<br />
China your Academia Sinica has sent a delegation here and the<br />
Academies have established most beneficial contacts with one another.<br />
The Chinese Archeological Exhibition, so generously mounted by the<br />
Peoples Republic of China, has been seen by over 600,000 Australians<br />
and contributed to our understanding of the splendour of Chinese<br />
civilisation and the talent of its craftsmen and artists.<br />
It is important that there be frequent contacts at all levels<br />
between people of different histories and cultures, and the<br />
Australian Government has before it a series of important proposals<br />
aimed at promoting non-official contacts between our two<br />
nations in cultural and other areas. </p>
<p>-2<br />
Australia's former Ambassador to Peking, Dr. Stephen Fitzgerald,<br />
has been heading a task force to advise the Government on this<br />
matter. Frequent contacts at Government level are also vital because<br />
they serve to highlight our common interests and shared assessments<br />
of world affairs. By beingr prepared to speak plainly and<br />
directly with each other, we can work together for peace and<br />
stability in the world and in our region.<br />
The talks I had with Chairman Hua whenI visited China, and the<br />
communications I have had with him since, indicate that we can speak<br />
plainly with one another on issues that concern both our nations.<br />
I was very pleased to receive the assurance Premier Hua gave me<br />
during my visit to China last year, that the Peoples Republic of<br />
China would not allow party to party contacts to interfere with<br />
state to state relations with neighbouring countries in the South<br />
East Asian region.<br />
Against that background, we are conscious, Mr. Vice Chairman, that<br />
your country is taking positive steps to develop relations with<br />
other countries of the region, and that while ideological<br />
differences exist, China does wish for peace and stability in<br />
South East Asia.<br />
Mr. Vice Chairman, I was very pleased to see that the official<br />
Chinese News--Agency,-Hsinhua, a few days ago expressed support<br />
for ASEAN's Kuala Lumpur Declaration, and for ASEAN's plan to<br />
develop economic relations with Japan, Australia, New Zealand<br />
and the EEC. Both our countries have a common interest in the<br />
peace, security and economic development of the region.<br />
Distinguished delegates, we hope that your stay in Australia,<br />
brief that it will be, provides you with the opportunity to<br />
observe our Parliamentary process, and the friendship of the<br />
Australian people and Government towards China. </p>
