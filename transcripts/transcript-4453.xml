ADDRESS AT OPENING OF KANANDA DISTRICT COUNCIL YOUNG FARMERS<br />
CONFERENCE : WARRNAMBOOL<br />
It is a great pleasure to be invited to open your Annual Conference.<br />
You could not have picked a better electorate in which to hold it.<br />
It has been quite a wrench for me to spend so much time away from<br />
my property over the past few years. Still, there are so many<br />
other farmers in the present Cabinet, I almost feel at home in<br />
Canberra these days.<br />
It is now just over eighteen months since the Liberal and National<br />
Country Party coalition was elected to Government. This seems<br />
therefore an appropriate occasion for me to review with you what<br />
we have been able to do in tackling the problems of our primary<br />
industries during the first half of our first term.<br />
We came to office with the strong conviction that Australian rural<br />
industries must continue to play a significant role in Australia's<br />
development. We saw and continue to believe that the fortunes<br />
of the rural sector and those of the rest of the economy are closely<br />
bound together. We viewed with deep concern the division which was<br />
developing between city and country. One of our major challenges in<br />
Government has been to halt and repair that rift, and to promote a<br />
better understanding by those in urban areas of the problems of<br />
country people and of the mutual inter-dependence of the rural<br />
and urban communities.<br />
It has been our aim to encourage the sound development of existing<br />
and new primary industries and to foster the most efficient and<br />
effective utilisation of our agricultural resources. Great<br />
emphasis has been placed in our agricultural policy upon measures<br />
to promote stability and confidence in the rural sector and on<br />
the development of existing and new markets for agricultural<br />
commodities. We are totally committed to retaining a viable rural sector which<br />
will continue to contribute significantly to export revenue and<br />
provide high quality food and fibre for consumers. We further<br />
believe that our agricultural policy should form an integral part<br />
of our overall national economic and social policies.<br />
our first objective has been to attain general economic recovery.<br />
When we came to office, the economy was in very bad shape. The<br />
budget deficit was running out of control at around $ 4 billion<br />
a year; inflation was running at an annual rate of 16% of more;<br />
and a large number of our industries, including most of our rural<br />
industries, were facing serious financial difficulties. / Against<br />
F77/ 161 </p>
<p>-2<br />
Against this background, the task of the Government was clear to<br />
reduce inflation. It was essential that a climate of stability<br />
should be created in which economic growth and development could<br />
once again be generated throughout the private sector. Confidence<br />
about our economic future had to be restored. Nowhere was this<br />
more vital than in the rural community. The situation has been<br />
so serious as to raise doubts in the mind of many primary<br />
producers about the long-term viability of some industries,<br />
which for a long time have contributed to the wealth of this<br />
country and the welfare of its people.<br />
These doubts were basically the result of reduced access to markets<br />
for many rural commodities, and decreasing competitiveness<br />
because of our higher inflation rates than those of other exporters.<br />
In short, our farm costs rose more rapidly than farm prices. Despite.<br />
significant increases in productivity, the real incomes of primary<br />
producers declined dramatically. Such movements in farm incomes<br />
have made it increasingly difficult for many farmers with marginal<br />
properties to maintain satisfactory incomes. Some have had to quit<br />
farming altogether, and many families have had to supplement their<br />
income from off-farm sources. In addition, low farm incomes have<br />
affected investment plans with perhaps serious long-term implications.<br />
Most major Australian agricultural industries rely heavily on export<br />
sales. Some 90% of the wool clip, 75% of the sugar, 65% of wheat,<br />
and 55% of beef and veal production are exported. In these<br />
circumstances, Australian agriculture is very vulnerable to<br />
fluctuations in world market conditions and to protectionist<br />
policies adopted by importing countries. The Government has been<br />
endeavouring in every possible way to secure improved access to<br />
overseas markets for our primary products.<br />
The Ministers for Primary Industry and Overseas Trade and myself<br />
have devoted considerable time on this matter, and I am glad to<br />
say that our efforts are bearing fruit. In respect of beef we<br />
have succeeded in securing increased access to the United States'<br />
market and have maintained access to the Japanese market in the<br />
face of adverse demand conditions there. Substantial sales of<br />
beef to Russia and Eastern Europe have been helpful.<br />
There has been good news also for other commodities. The recent<br />
sale of 3 million tonnes of wheat to China is the largest ever<br />
negotiated. Australia has further penetrated the Middle East<br />
market for lamb and live sheep, and the volume of cheese sold to<br />
Japan has continued to increase.<br />
our trade with the European Economic Community, however, is far<br />
from satisfactory. Their Common Agricultural Policy has created<br />
grave problems for agricultural exporting countries such as<br />
Australia. Under this policy, domestic agricultural production<br />
is artificially stimulated by high prices supported by restrictive<br />
import policies, and this greatly inhibits access by other more<br />
efficient producers to the large European market.<br />
But even worse, the EEC subsidises the export of surpluses<br />
generated by the Common Agricultural Policy which seriously<br />
disrupts our other traditional markets around the world. My<br />
Government places a high value on our relationships with the<br />
European Economic Community and its individual members. During<br />
my recent visit to Europe I was glad to be able to have warm and<br />
/ constructive </p>
<p>-3<br />
discussions about these matters. Indeed, at times they were<br />
very warm.<br />
To those European leaders who showed interest in Australia's<br />
uranium, I made the point that, should Australia decide to enter<br />
the export field in this commodity, both buyers and sellers would<br />
regard stability of supply and access as an important consideration.<br />
I stressed that this principle was equally applicable to trade in<br />
other items. Press reaction overseas suggested that this point<br />
was noted and understood.<br />
As a result of my discussions, it had been agreed that there will<br />
be further major bilateral talks between the Community and Australia<br />
on our trade problems. We would be mistaken to expect rapid and<br />
major changes in the Common Agricultural Policy, but I would hope<br />
that this dialogue will point the way to solutions of some of the<br />
more important problems that the Common Agricultural Policy has<br />
created for our primary industry exports.<br />
In recognising the importance of these discussions for Australia,<br />
the Government has decided to appoint a member of the ministry,<br />
John Howard, as Minister for Special Trade Negotiations with the<br />
European Economic Community. He will lead discussions with the<br />
Governments of the nine member states of the EEC and the Commission<br />
in Brussels on all bilateral and multilateral economic and trade<br />
matters in which we are involved.<br />
The Government has also been seeking to improve the marketing of<br />
our products by reviewing the functions, composition and powers of<br />
existing commodity boards. You will all be aware of the reconstruction<br />
of the Australian Meat Board as an Australian Meat and<br />
Livestock Corporation, which, by virtue of its composition,<br />
powers and financial arrangements will be adequately equipped<br />
to oversee and promote Australian meat and livestock exports.<br />
Despite the need for Government expenditure cuts to help curb<br />
inflation and restore our confidence in the private sector, the<br />
Government has recognised the serious financial difficulties<br />
facing many of our rural industries, and we have established<br />
a wide range of assistance measures to help them ride out their<br />
difficulties. Some of these measures have been designed to provide essential<br />
short-term assistance. They include such measures as: carry-on<br />
loans at concessional rates of interest to beef and dairy<br />
producers; abolition of the meat export levy; underwriting of<br />
prices for certain dairy products; assistance with drought and<br />
other natural disaster relief; fertiliser subsidies; relaxation<br />
of eligibility criteria for unemployment benefits to include<br />
primary producers; and the extension of stabilisation schemes<br />
for apples and pears and dried vine fruits.<br />
Other assistance measures undertaken by the Government were<br />
designed to aid longer-term structural adjustments. We have<br />
introduced a new rural adjustment scheme replacing the old rural<br />
reconstruction scheme with improved provisions. Assistance is<br />
now provided not only for farm build-up, debt reconstruction and<br />
rehabilitation, but also for farm improvements, carry-on finance<br />
( currently for beef and dairy producers) and for household support.<br />
/ Another </p>
<p>-4<br />
Another important measure in this category has been the<br />
introduction of,--the Income Equalisation Deposit Scheme. We<br />
see this scheme as a significant means of helping farmers cope<br />
with the problems of fluctuating incomes. In addition to these<br />
assistance measures which relate specifically to the rural sector,<br />
we have taken a number of other initiatives which have general<br />
application, but which are nonetheless important forms of<br />
assistance to the farming community.<br />
I refer to such schemes as tax indexation, increased probate<br />
exemption, the investment allowance, trading stock valuation<br />
adjustments and family allowances.<br />
Looking back to our first eighteen months in office, it can fairly<br />
be said that we have made considerable progress. The great majority<br />
of our rural election policy commitments have been met. None of<br />
them have been abandoned. one initiative which is still to be<br />
implemented is the establishment of a National Rural Bank.<br />
Agriculture is a capital-intensive industry.<br />
The technological innovations of the post-war period accompanied<br />
by the sharply rising cost of labour have produced a steady<br />
increase in new capital investment. This trend of substituting<br />
capital for labour has had important consequences for the structure<br />
of farm enterprises. The average size of farms, for example, has<br />
increased to enable exploitation of economies of size.<br />
of major-importance has been the need by farmers to resort<br />
increasingly to borrowed funds to finance their capital needs<br />
and operating expenditure. The Government believes that access<br />
to finance on suitable terms and conditions has become an<br />
increasingly serious problem for the farmer. Too often he has<br />
had to use short-term funds to finance what is essentially a longterm<br />
investment. Consequently, the coalition parties undertook at<br />
the 1975 elections to establish a National Rural Bank to provide<br />
more flexibility to cater for the special needs of individual<br />
rural producers. A considerable amount 6f work has been done<br />
on this proposal. We have received many submissions from<br />
interested bodies and individuals. A sub-committee of the<br />
Government members Rural Committee has conducted an investigation<br />
into the matter, and we have also received a report from the Bureau<br />
of Agricultural Economics reviewing the rural credit market. The<br />
Government is now considering the best form which the Bank might<br />
take. Whatever form that may be, primary producers will be<br />
assured of better access to finance on terms which meet their<br />
specific requirements.<br />
Finally, may I mention that young farmers, as well as other young<br />
Australians, will be beneficiaries of the Queen's Silver Jubilee<br />
Appeal for Young Australians, which is being conducted at the<br />
present time. The Government has contributed $ 2 million to this<br />
appeal and I * hope it will be generously supported by the whole<br />
community. Funds raised through this appeal will be available for<br />
a number of purposes including projects or activities of organisations<br />
of benefit to young people, and scholarships for young<br />
people to promote standards of excellence and achievement in<br />
their chosen vocations. / The Government </p>
<p>5<br />
The Government is very sympathetic to the problems of the<br />
rural sector and will continue to provide assistance to<br />
ensure its future viability. I believe that the current<br />
problems of the rural sector must receive the widest possible<br />
publicity so that better understanding will result between<br />
city and country people.<br />
It is important for all Australians that we maintain a<br />
viable and efficient rural sector with potential expansion<br />
to take advantage of opportunities as they arise.<br />
I now have much pleasure in declaring the Annual State<br />
Conference of the Victorian Young Farmers open. </p>
