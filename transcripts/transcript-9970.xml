    <content><![CDATA[<p>It is with considerable regret that I learned of Mick Young's death early today at the relatively young age of 59. </p>
<p>Mick Young was one of the nation's most coloourful parliamentary performers. </p>
<p>He was also one of the most significant Labor Party figures of his era.</p>
<p>He and I entered Parliament on the same day in 1974. </p>
<p>From a traditional Labor background the former shearer played a major<br />
role as National Secretary in the Labor Party's election to power under<br />
Gough Whitlam in 1972. </p>
<p>He was subsequently to play a key role in Labor's restructuring after its defeat in 1975. </p>
<p>He will be well remembered as a colourful and powerful figure in the<br />
Parliament. He made his mark ks a Minister and particularly as Leader of the House where he performed with wit, humour and strong debating skills. </p>
<p>I extend the sympathy of all Coalition members to his wife Mary and to his children Janine and Michael. </p>
<p>8 April 1996 </p>
