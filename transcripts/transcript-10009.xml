    <content><![CDATA[<p>VISIT TO JAPAN AND INDONESIA </p>
<p>I am pleased to announce that I will visit Japan from 7 to 10 August and Indonesia from 11 to 13 August.</p>
<p>This visit to Japan and Indonesia two of Australia's most important partners is an expression of the Government's deep commitment to our region. </p>
<p>In Tokyo I shall reafflum the enduring strength of the long standing relationship between Australia and Japan. We have an economic and political partnership which is important for each of us and for the region as a whole.</p>
<p>I look forward very much to meeting the Japanese Prime Minister, Mr Hashimoto, and other senior members of his government, and to hearing their views, I hope to discuss with them how we can further strengthen our partnership and pursue our common interests in the region. </p>
<p>The visit to Jakarta will allow me to confirm personally to President Soeharto the value the Government attaches to Australia's relationship with Indonesia. </p>
<p>Economic links with Indonesia are expanding rapidly, as are contacts between Australians and Indonesians generally through education and tourism. Along with the shared interests of our countries in regional stability, these are foundations of our increasingly strong and resilient relationship. </p>
<p>I am particularly keen to hear President Soeharto ' s views on how we can cooperate in the region, including in achieving progress at this year's APEC leaders meeting towards the Bogor objectives of free trade and investment. </p>
