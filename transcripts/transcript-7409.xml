SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
PARLIAMENTARY LUNCHEON IN HONOUR oF<br />
PRESIDENT COSSIGA OF ITALY<br />
CANBERRA 11 OCTOBER 1988<br />
Mr President,<br />
Mr Andreotti,<br />
Distinguished Guests,<br />
a Ladies and Gentlemen.<br />
od, Italians and Australians have much in common and a visit<br />
from such as yours, Mr President, confirms the friendly and<br />
enduring nature of those ties.<br />
am At the formal Government level, Italy and Australia have<br />
enjoyed the best of relations for many years.<br />
Of even greater importance, the bonds between our two<br />
: an peoples are already strong and are daily strengthened<br />
it because of the powerful links of kinship between our two<br />
th peoples. In particular, Australians are happy to acknowledge the<br />
great historical debt we owe to those Italian people who for<br />
the generations have come to this country to build a new home.<br />
As you travel around Australia, Mr President, you will be<br />
not impressed by the evidence that will present itself<br />
ids everywhere of the great contribution made to our community<br />
by Australians of Italian origin.<br />
a Indeed, it is true that a large part of what we take for<br />
real granted in Australian life today is Italian in origin, from<br />
food to fashion.<br />
The hard work and ingenuity of thousands upon thousands of<br />
Italian Australians have enriched our society beyond<br />
to measure. So it is a pleasure to welcome you to Australia today; by<br />
doing so we honour all Australians of Italian origin.<br />
a It is certainly appropriate that we should welcome you here<br />
in our newly completed Parliament House not only because<br />
this great building represents in tangible form the enduring<br />
commitment of Australians to democratic government, but also<br />
because of its Italian aspects. 2591 </p>

Melbourne, of course, has just played host to one of the manufac<br />
great cultural events of our calendar, the Spoleto Festival<br />
under the patronage of maestro Gian Carlo Menotti.<br />
But the cultural travel is not all one way. The landscape<br />
and atmosphere of your home country have always exercised a<br />
fascination for artists seeking inspiration.<br />
And to this day the hills of Tuscany provide a second home<br />
to an influential band of Australian artists including the<br />
writer, David Malouf, and the artist, Jeffrey Smart.<br />
2592 </p>
<p>In the same vein, we are very pleased now to have our own<br />
pavilion at the Venice Biennale, providing our artists with<br />
a means of regular exhibition at what is one of the world's<br />
most prestigious art events.<br />
I am also pleased to note the progress being made towards<br />
the establishment in Rome of the Arthur Boyd Australian<br />
Centre.<br />
Thanks to the generosity of Arthur Boyd, one of Australia's<br />
most distinguished artists, serious work can now be done<br />
towards providing an institutional base for Australian<br />
artists and scholars working in Italy and for Italians<br />
eager to learn more about Australia.<br />
Mr President,<br />
As you move around this country, you will meet a great many<br />
representatives of the Italian community.<br />
Even after their immigration to a new home, Italian<br />
Australians have retained a warm affection for their country<br />
of birth.<br />
By nurturing their own customs and traditions, Italian<br />
Australians have succeeded not only in becoming valued<br />
builders of Australian society but also in sharing the<br />
generous spirit of Italian culture with other Australians.<br />
This sort of participation is the very essence of<br />
multiculturalism, and my Government is very proud of the<br />
contribution of Italian Australians to the development of<br />
our multicultural society.<br />
Mr President,<br />
I have mentioned some of the cultural and human links<br />
between our two countries.<br />
But I would also like to welcome you here specifically as<br />
the head of one of the world's leading economic powers.<br />
Your visit serves to remind us of Italy's outstanding<br />
achievements in industrial and technological development.<br />
The Italian pavilion at Expo ' 88 has been most successful in<br />
demonstrating this aspect of modern Italy to its thousands<br />
of interested visitors.<br />
Traditionally our trade relationship has involved Australian<br />
raw materials, notably wool, as inputs to Italian<br />
manufactures. 2593 </p>
<p>But as our economies change, and in particular as the<br />
spectacular growth of the Asia-Pacific region continues, I<br />
would encourage Italian businesspeople to pay regard to the<br />
Investment potential of Australia. We have much to offer,<br />
both in our own right and as an entry to the markets of our<br />
region: our stable political environment, our efficient<br />
financial system, our abundant natural resources, our well<br />
qualified reservoir of technical and professional expertise,<br />
and our highly favourable tax structure.<br />
The potential Australia provides for European countries<br />
looking for a springboard into the lucrative and developing<br />
financial and trading centres of this region cannot be<br />
overemphasised. The economic relationship between Australia and Italy is<br />
particularly important at the moment because of the movement<br />
towards a single European market in 1992.<br />
The Australian Government is keenly interested in this<br />
process. Already, the European Community, taken as a whole,<br />
ranks as our second largest export market and our largest<br />
source of imports.<br />
The development of a single market with 320 million<br />
inhabitants a market larger than any other in the<br />
industrialised world will surely have a profound impact on<br />
global economic and trading relationships.<br />
I would like to reiterate that Australia strongly believes<br />
that the positive rewards of the single market will not be<br />
reaped If an inward looking, " fortress-Europe' approach is<br />
allowed to develop.<br />
We look, in particular, to further progress being made in<br />
winding back inefficient agricultural subsidies under the<br />
Common Agricultural Policy.<br />
We hope that recognition of the benefits likely to flow from<br />
a strong and open European economy will prevail over any<br />
concerns about competition from outside.<br />
Already Australia's most successful and innovative companies<br />
are developing strategies for new operations in Europe,<br />
taking account of the opportunities which should arise from<br />
the single market.<br />
Mr President,<br />
This year, as you know Australia is celebrating two hundred<br />
years of European settlement.<br />
Your own visit and visits by many other world leaders to<br />
share our Bicentennial have added inestimably to our<br />
enjoyment of these celebrations.<br />
I was delighted to see the " iancris" amongst the Tall Ships<br />
in Sydney Harbor earlier this year and to learn that she had<br />
been sponsored by the Italian community in Australia.<br />
2594-</p>
<p>Among a number of Italian contributions to the Bicentennial,<br />
let me single out one, Mr President, for special thanks.<br />
Your Government has most generously sponsored " Italy on<br />
Stage", a brilliant and exciting program of events which<br />
I make a fitting tribute to Italy's place in Australian<br />
history.<br />
Mr President,<br />
I have spoken of a range of areas where Australian and<br />
Italian interests intersect. Our advancement of mutual<br />
interests in all these areas is ultimately and crucially<br />
based on the warmth and closeness in the relationships<br />
between the people of our two countries.<br />
I know that your visit will give a special boost to our<br />
relationship. I again welcome you and your most<br />
distinguished party to Australia and wish you a most<br />
enjoyable visit. 2595 </p>
