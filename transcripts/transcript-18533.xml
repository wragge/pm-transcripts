They landed on this day in a land âancient and implacableâ.</p>
<p>They were young and raw.</p>
<p>Few were professionals, most new to battle.</p>
<p>They were called the Australian Imperial Force.</p>
<p>But before these 240 days of hell were over, they owned a name among the immortals  -  the Anzacs.</p>
<p>Unlike their French and British comrades, who held aloft battle honours like Austerlitz and Waterloo, the Anzacs had no tradition to rely on or defend.</p>
<p>They did something greater  -  they created one.</p>
<p>A new story for a new nation.</p>
<p>It is the story of us all and it belongs to us all because they were men of every background and belief.</p>
<p>But in this they were united  -  they were volunteers, every single one.</p>
<p>And so their presence here in Turkey was not only a manifestation of duty but an expression of citizenship.</p>
<p>Free citizens from a free land.</p>
<p>That is why Charles Bean was moved to say that âit was on the 25th of April, 1915, that the consciousness of Australian nationhood was born.â</p>
<p>Here, on these shores.</p>
<p>So rocky, so harsh  -  and so very far from home.</p>
<p>Our federal bond was young when the Anzacs came to this place.</p>
<p>The laws and institutions of our nation were laid down in 1901.</p>
<p>But here, in 1915, its spirit and ethos were sealed.</p>
<p>This was our first act of nationhood in the eyes of a watching world, an act authored not by statesmen or diplomats, but by simple soldiers.</p>
<p>The Anzacs.</p>
<p>The boys of Federation who became the men of Gallipoli.</p>
<p>This campaign claimed 8700 Australian lives.</p>
<p>From the most senior  -  Sir William Bridges  -  our first general to be killed in war to the youngest, James Martin who died at just 14, waiting to receive a letter from his mother that never came.</p>
<p>Almost one in ten of all Australia's losses in wartime occurred in the narrow confines of this peninsula.</p>
<p>And no portion of this landscape was fought more fiercely than Lone Pine.</p>
<p>Three days of vicious fighting soaked this ground in blood.</p>
<p>Of the nine VCs awarded at Gallipoli, seven were won here.</p>
<p>Like the campaign as a whole, it was a story of occasional success but ultimate frustration.</p>
<p>So today we come here not in triumph.</p>
<p>We come here in honour of qualities that defined the Anzacs and, we hope however faintly, might also define ourselves:</p>
<p>Reckless daring under fire.</p>
<p>Larrikin good humour.</p>
<p>A genius for improvisation.</p>
<p>And the unbroken bond of mateship.</p>
<p>Qualities that a swift victory might not have so easily revealed.</p>
<p>But qualities tempered and disclosed over nine months spent in the mud and filth of these treacherous gullies and unyielding cliffs.</p>
<p>Victory was not gained here, but meaning was won in this place and a harsh learning.</p>
<p>From here, the Anzacs went to the Western Front and Palestine where they found triumph.</p>
<p>And it is over this entire continuum from Anzac Day 1915 to Armistice Day 1918 upon which, in the final analysis, our judgement must be made.</p>
<p>That is the tradition of arms that gave us Tobruk and Kokoda, Kapyong and Long Tan.</p>
<p>And that is the tradition of arms passed down unbroken over a century to more recent conflicts, as the presence of Ben Roberts-Smith so powerfully attests today.</p>
<p>Victory was unlikely on these shores; a test the Anzacs were never going to pass.</p>
<p>They passed a greater and more enduring test.</p>
<p>So when Lieutenant Noel McShane of the AIF's 1stBattalion, asked of posterity:</p>
<p>âI hope you in Australia are not ashamed of us; we have done our bit and no blame can fall on usâ, our answer rings unanimous down the decades.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No, we are not ashamed of you.</p>
<p>Because no shame can exist in this place.</p>
<p>We are proud.</p>
<p>We are thankful.</p>
<p>And we will never, ever forget. </p>
