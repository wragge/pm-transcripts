PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 20 August 1985<br />
EMBARGOED UNTIL 8.00 PM<br />
The 1985-86 Budget again reflects the Government's<br />
continuing commitment to enhancing the status of women.<br />
All Departments were required to ensure that decisions<br />
made in the Budget were made with full knowledge of<br />
their impact on women. This role was complemented by<br />
the close involvement of the Office of the Status of<br />
Women in the Budget process.<br />
In brief, women will benefit from the following Budget<br />
initiatives: the expenditure of $ 149.4 million on child care,<br />
including $ 4.9 million towards the planned<br />
implementation over three years of an additional<br />
20,000 child care places.<br />
a package of social security benefit increases from<br />
which low income women will be major beneficiaries.<br />
the extension of measures for the care of the aged<br />
and handicapped, women being the larger group of<br />
both carers and beneficiaries.<br />
increases in student allowances, and the provision<br />
of a new integrated range of youth policies; both<br />
particularly important in view of young women's<br />
lower participation in post-school education and<br />
higher unemployment rates.<br />
In the House of Representatives tonight I tabled this<br />
year's edition of the Women's Budget Program document.<br />
That document lists fully the details of the initiatives<br />
in the Budget which will benefit women. Also, for the<br />
first time, it provides a comprehensive assessment of<br />
the programs and activities of all Departments, and many<br />
other Commonwealth agencies, from the viewpoint of their<br />
impact on women. </p>
