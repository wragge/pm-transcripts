TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW ON THE TODAY SHOW 16 JANUARY 1987<br />
JOURNALIST: We have something like more than 120,000 young<br />
-people between 15 and 19 years of age out of-work. What do you<br />
say to them?<br />
PM: Well, you say these things. Firstly, that there has been a<br />
significant improvement in the period since we have been in<br />
office. Since 1983 we have created something like 700,000 new<br />
jobs which is a record in terms of new job creation. I say to<br />
them that we are not only getting the economy right so that there<br />
will be a basis for stronger growth in the future but we are also<br />
undertaking significant changes in the education and training<br />
area. There has been an enormous increase in the participation<br />
rate. More kids are staying in the education system. When we came<br />
in there was only a 36% retention rate. That is up to 46% now.<br />
There are more training and retraining programs available for<br />
young people. So my message to young people basically is to the<br />
extent possible make sure you stay in the education system<br />
because this is an increasingly complex and difficult world so<br />
get as much education and training as-you--possibly can.-It is<br />
going to be better.<br />
JOURNALIST: Can you say you will get a job?<br />
PM: No, because that would be untruthful if I said to every<br />
young person you can get a job.<br />
JOURNALIST: Well, what do you think the major problems for<br />
Australia will be in 1987?<br />
PM: The basic task will be to ensure that we retain the very<br />
significant improvement in our competitiveness that has been<br />
provided by the significant devaluation that occurred during the<br />
latter part of ' 85 and ' 86. That has put Australian industry and<br />
Australian services in a more competitive position than they have<br />
been in memory. Now we mustn't dissipate that competitiveness by<br />
unnecessarily high wage increases. we have got to make sure that<br />
we increase Australia's competitiveness in manufactures and<br />
services because if we do that we will providing the sound long<br />
term basis for our children.<br />
JOURNALIST: The tax proposals put forward by the Opposition<br />
I I </p>
<p>PM: Which ones. I mean there are so many of them. It is Mr<br />
Sinclair's which says give the taxing powers back-to the States<br />
which makes the rest of Liberals and a lot of the Nationals<br />
horrified. Is it Sir Joh's who is repudiated by some his own<br />
National Party. Which opposition tax proposals do you mean?<br />
JOURNALIST: Any of them seem to be slightly confusing for a<br />
member of the publ. ic.<br />
PM: They are all confusing.<br />
JOURNALIST: But at the samew~ fhi Te ttheseib<br />
seem to be more attractive to the average person in the street.<br />
PM: On the contrary. The average man in the street is-appalled<br />
by them because the average man in the street<br />
JOURNALIST: Is he though?<br />
PM: The average man in the street is much more intelligent than<br />
the commentator give him credit for being because he knows that<br />
if you look at Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen and he treats the Federal<br />
opposition with contempt and that is fair enough because that's<br />
basically how I suppose they should be treated and are by most.<br />
And Sir Joh certainly has that attitude. Now his proposal for a<br />
flat tax will mean that the average bloke in the street is<br />
going to pay more tax. So he is not enamoured of that. We will<br />
win the election and one of the reasons-why we will win an<br />
election is because we are dinkum about tax reform and we are<br />
dinkum about ensuring that there is fairness, that the wealthy,<br />
privileged minority can't avoid tax and impose a greater burden<br />
on your average viewer. It is your average viewer I am concerned<br />
about. JOURNALIST: The New Right. What role will that play in politics<br />
this year?<br />
PM: They will be devastating for the formal conservative parties<br />
in this country. They are already doing this. Their spokesmen are<br />
saying look, that Liberal Member of Parliament, that Liberal<br />
Member of Parliament, those Liberal Members of Parliament, we are<br />
going to shoot them down. Just saying it quite like that, they<br />
are out. Now that is creating consternation and havoc and<br />
bitterness, factionalism and hatred in the opposition parties.<br />
They are disintegrating.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you pleased to see that?<br />
PM: Well, I would be less than honest if I didn't say as leader<br />
of the Government that I saw some satisfaction in it if I didn't<br />
see satisfaction in what was happening.<br />
JOURNALIST: You are off to the Middle East?<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: What is the purpose of that visit? </p>
<p>PM: Well, for a long time now I have had invitations from<br />
Jordan, Israel and Egypt to visit. And it hasn't been opportune<br />
for me to do it before now. It is important to do that I think<br />
not simply because I have got the invitations but for these two<br />
reasons. Australia had important bilateral relations with these<br />
countries and I want to do what I can to improve them. it is also<br />
the case that that is a region which is volatile, which could be<br />
a flash point for a wider international conflict. Now I go there<br />
not with any assumption or presumption that I am a mediator or<br />
console things. But I think it is important that a nation like<br />
Australia which is respected by those three nations should have<br />
th-e opportuni-t-y -of-1istening to what they have got to say and<br />
being as aware as we can directly of the events there.<br />
JOURNALIST: You have been-in-of-fice--for four -yea-rs.---Has--i-t -beenworth<br />
it?<br />
PM: Too right. It's been challenging, stimulating, rewarding,<br />
exciting and importantly I think objectively it can be said it<br />
has been constructive. I feel certain that Australia is a better<br />
place now four years later than it was at the beginning of 1983.<br />
JOURNALIST: Has it been four good years for you Mrs Hawke?<br />
MRS HAWKE: Yes, extremely good. I have felt a great deal of<br />
pleasure in the fact that this Government has tackled a lot of<br />
the hard things. A lot of things in Australia have just grown<br />
like topsy and they have looked at some of the hard things and<br />
really given them the once over. And I think it is good to<br />
observe that sort of thing. This last year, 1986, was a really<br />
tough year in that respect of tackling the hard ones but it is<br />
fascinating, it is interesting and-satisfying. All those ithi'ngsthat<br />
Bob said.<br />
JOURNALIST: It obviously takes its toll though. What sort of<br />
toll does it have on you personally and your family?<br />
PM: Oh well, I don't want to overstate the toll. I mean I can<br />
honestly say to you Elizabeth, that physically I feel better now<br />
than I have ever felt in my life. I feel fit. I am mentally alert<br />
and that hasn't happened by accident. while I work very long<br />
hours I can turn off when I need to. when I put my head down I go<br />
to sleep and do turn off. Hazel has got me on the Pritikin diet<br />
and I am eating better than I ever have before. I get a good<br />
quota of exercise so when you ask about toll I don't feel a<br />
physical toll. There is a deprivation of privacy but I knew that<br />
would be the case. So again that is not a toll.<br />
JOURNALIST: Does it take away the ordinary day life for you<br />
though Mrs Hawke? Do you find that you have lost touch with those<br />
day to day things that you perhaps enjoyed doing before?<br />
MRS HAWKE: Well, it is just different. I do different things. I<br />
first I missed, strangely enough the thing I missed most was my<br />
garden. But one gets used to just doing and life fills up so<br />
quickly and easily and interestingly. I am not at all bored. I </p>
<p>don't feel at all deprived. on the contrary, I regard it as a<br />
privilege to have this sort of experience for this phase of our<br />
lives. It is an interesting one for me and I will put as much<br />
into it as I can and I am getting a great deal out of it in many<br />
respects. PM: I mean obviously if you are going to do the job of leading<br />
this nation that is not a part time job. It is not a thing you<br />
can do eight hours a day or five days a week and I tried hard to<br />
get the job. I saw it as something that was a challenge,<br />
I ______ something I thought -I could _' do * well and -some<br />
coul1d-n'_ t do weil unless I just poured the whole of myself into<br />
it. JOURNALIST: But were you as prepared Mrs Hawke?<br />
MRS HAWKE: Well, I didn't pl-an--for -it-but-i-t-is nut -a--mat-ter--ofpreparation.<br />
I mean I suppose you can say life experiences are<br />
preparation for what comes next and that is how I regard it and<br />
we have had many different experiences and phases during our<br />
getting on for forty years together. It is a long haul. And we<br />
have adapted in each of the phases and situations that we have<br />
either found ourselves in or worked towards putting ourselves in.<br />
JOURNALIST: Why do you think the public has lost confidence to<br />
a certain degree in politicians?<br />
PM: Well, it is part of the Australian ethos of knocking tall<br />
poppies. I mean that is a thing that has grown up in this country<br />
and it is fair game in the sense that we have an enormous number<br />
of politicians. we are a country of 16 million people and we have<br />
a national Parliament and six State Parliaments and the<br />
quasi-Parliament of the Northern Territory. There is an enormous<br />
number of them and so I think they are more -sort of exposed<br />
because there are so many. People are always seeing politicians.<br />
But as I say it is also part of the Australian approach of<br />
knocking tall poppies and politicians are tall poppies. But again<br />
I don't get terribly upset about that. I mean I think it is good<br />
not to think that you are too far away from and different from<br />
ordinary Australians and I like to think that one of the reasons<br />
why I have had a fairly successful public life is that I am close<br />
to Australians. So if they are sort of reminding you every now<br />
and again now don't think you are too different from us. That is<br />
pretty health I reckon. You know we can't really go anywhere in<br />
Australia and just be Bob and Hazel, private citizens and not<br />
noticed. But there are so many pluses about the job*. I mean it is<br />
an indescribable honour to be Prime minister of a country which I<br />
think is the greatest country in the world and the people I think<br />
are the greatest people in the world. I mean to have that honour<br />
of being Prime Minister of this country, you can't describe just<br />
what that entails.<br />
JOURNALIST: OK, well how do you relax? How does a Prime Minister<br />
and his wife relax from the day to day chores?<br />
MRS HAWKE: Lots of things. Tennis, golf, yoga, music, friends.<br />
PM: No yoga here. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Are you not partaking in yoga?<br />
PM: No. You have got to say this for her, she is persistent. No,<br />
she is very persistent. You know on the diet, the Pritikin, she<br />
talked about and then she went on to it herself but she didn't<br />
you know yak, yak, yak and say come on get on the diet, get on<br />
the diet but she did it herself and the sort of scepticism that I<br />
originally had melted as I saw the good sense of it. Now, it<br />
worked that tactic with Pritikin. In a subtle way she is trying<br />
___ the same thing with<br />
JOURNALIST: Will we see you with your legs tangled up around<br />
your head some time in the future do you think?<br />
PM: Well, the only person who might get me tangled up is Hazel<br />
-and the yoga.<br />
MRS HAWKE: And his daughter is a very keen advocate for yoga<br />
too. She is working on him.<br />
JOURNALIST: Golf of course is your biggest pastime and I notice<br />
out the back there is a practice net for driving.<br />
MRS HAWKE: That was his Christmas present, a practice net.<br />
PM: Combined Birthday/ Christmas present. It has been my fate<br />
since I was born to get combined Birthday-and Christmas presents.<br />
JOURNALIST: That is a terrible misfortune.<br />
PM: Yes, it is awful.<br />
JOURNALIST: What is your handicap?<br />
PM: Well, I have got it down to 17 now. I have been playing for<br />
12 months and they have got me on 17.<br />
MRS HAWKE: Have you got your card in?<br />
PM: Yes, and I played to it at Royal Sydney a couple of days. I<br />
am going to get it down further too.<br />
JOURNALIST: When it is all said and done I understand that<br />
television isn't a bad area.<br />
PM: Oh you are talking about the swapping seats. Well, I don't<br />
want to overstate this. People have asked me what are the things<br />
I would like to do. I have got a whole range of things I would<br />
like to do after this stage of my existence. And I have just had<br />
the idea that I would like to do a series of television<br />
interviews with people that I have had the opportunity of meeting<br />
in Australia and internationally. I would certainly find it<br />
interesting but more importantly I think a lot of bther people<br />
would. JOURNALIST: Not keen on George Negus' role at all are you?<br />
Take a seat on the Today Show?<br />
11 </p>
<p>6<br />
PM: No. With all due respect my dear beloved George I was<br />
thinking of something in rather greater depth.<br />
JOURNALIST: I didn't hear you say that.<br />
PM: Didn't you? Oh I see. George will recognise and love my<br />
observation and the spirit in which it is said.<br />
