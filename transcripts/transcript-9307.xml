PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
1995 PAPAL VISIT<br />
His Holiness Pope John Paul 11h as approved a program for the Papal Visit to<br />
Sydney In January 1995 to commemorate the Beat ification of Mary MacKillop<br />
as Australia's first saint.<br />
The ceremony of Beatification, which will take place at an open air Mass at<br />
Randwick Racecourse on Thursday, 19 January, 1995, will mark the<br />
achievements of an Australian woman who displayed a rare appreciation of<br />
Australia as a nation. She encouraged thousands of young women to follow<br />
her example of creating a better standard of living for all Australians,<br />
especially the dispossessed.<br />
His Holiness has the following engagements in Sydney:<br />
0A public Ecumenical Welcome on the Festival of Sydney stage in the<br />
Sydney Domain, will be held shortly after his arrival at Sydney Airport<br />
during the early evening of Wednesday, 18 January, 1995.<br />
0 On Thursday 19, January, His Holiness will meet members and<br />
associates of the Josephite Order at a service at St Mary's Cathedral.<br />
a His Holiness will also visit the Josephite Convent Chapel in North Sydney<br />
where he will pray at the MacKillop Tomb before the Mass at Randwick<br />
later that day.<br />
Pope John Paul will leave Sydney Airport early on Friday, 20 January.<br />
I hope all Australians would join in welcoming the Pope to Sydney for this<br />
historic occasion.<br />
