FOR PRESS 27 February 1976<br />
SUPPORT FOR WORLD HARVEST FOR HUMANITY<br />
I want to place on record my wholehearted support for World<br />
Harvest for Humanity Day to be observed in Australia this<br />
gunday, February 29.<br />
The day should serve as a reminder to all AustrF. lians that<br />
460 million people-on this planet exist on, or close to,<br />
starvation level. They live in constant fear of famine and<br />
malnutrition. This special leap year the first of its ki1nd will help make<br />
Australians more aware of the problems facing the ' have nots'.<br />
It will also allow them means of showing their concern in a<br />
practical way-<br />
I understand that all money received from this day will be used<br />
for self help projects around the world nominated by the donor.<br />
I warmly commend the Australian Freedom From Hunger Campaign<br />
for its efforts in promoting this special day. It is a cause<br />
worth-of thought and support from all Australian families.<br />
