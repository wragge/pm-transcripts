AUSTRALIA DAY AND CITIZENSHIP<br />
Many of us spend the Australia Day long weekend with our<br />
friends and families in sport and recreation. But we also<br />
all recognise that Australia Day is much more than just.<br />
another summer holiday.<br />
Some time ago the* Government established a national Austr alia<br />
Day Committee designed to foster amongst all Australians an<br />
awareness of what Australia Day stands for, and of its.<br />
significance to us as a growing and prospering nation.<br />
Australia Day is an appropriate occasion to reflect on<br />
what being a citizen of Australia means the privileges<br />
it confers, the sense of Australian identity and of<br />
our aspirations.<br />
Australia is the best place in the world to bring up a<br />
family; Australia is one of the freest and most open<br />
societies in the world.<br />
Until the Second World War, which is already beyond the<br />
personal memory of the majority of living Australians,<br />
Australia was largely an Anglo-Saxon society. Most<br />
Australian settlers had come from the United Kingdom or<br />
from Ireland.<br />
On reflection, I think we were sometimes n, arrow and<br />
inward looking. Since the last war, all that has changed.<br />
Australia is now a multicultural society. Tens upon tens<br />
of thousands of new settlers have come as refugees from war,<br />
or displaced from Eastern Europe as their homelands were<br />
overrun by Communism. There has been a great economic<br />
migration; many families from Europe came because they<br />
believe Australia offers a bett,-er life, a fuller life, for<br />
themselves and for their children.<br />
All this has changed the face of Australia. Our factories<br />
could not have grown, our mining industries could not have been<br />
established, our standard of living could not have risen<br />
without the help, the energy, the initiatIve of people<br />
from overseas. But that is only part of the story. </p>
<p>-2<br />
New settlers have brought with them their own sense<br />
of history and their own culture from different<br />
backgrounds. They have made this a part of modern<br />
Australia. As a result, we have become a more tolerant, and I hope<br />
a wiser people. In the last few years we have taken in<br />
many refugees from South East Asia, from Vietnam and<br />
Kampuchea. In this respect Australia has been one of the<br />
more generous nations in the post-war world and I strongly<br />
believe that we should continue to be so.<br />
That is the kind of Australia we are all. building. These<br />
are the hopes we have for the future.<br />
But what are the privileges, what are the responsibilities,<br />
of Australian citizenship?<br />
There are simple but important rights the right to vote<br />
for the political party and for the candidate of one's chOiCc-!<br />
in State and Federal elections, the right to stand for, and<br />
enter, Parliament.<br />
Accordingly, I would urge all those who have comte to this<br />
country from other lands to participate as fully as possible<br />
in Australia's national life.<br />
Taking out Australian citizenship does not mean casting aside<br />
affection and love for the land of one's birth. It does not<br />
mean casting aside the history, the culture or the language<br />
of one's country of origin. I believe people are good<br />
Australians and able to love this country best, if they also<br />
maintain their l~ inks and their affection for their land<br />
of origin..<br />
All people who choose to lead their life in Australia have a<br />
responsibility which I believe is the highest responsibility<br />
of citizenship. That is to contribute to making Australia a<br />
better, more tolerant society, and a more prosperous one, in<br />
which, out of the varied pasts of citizens, Something<br />
distinctive and uniquely Australian can continue to grow<br />
and develop.<br />
Australia is not something remote and untouchable. It is the<br />
sum of all the actions of all the citizens and all the residents<br />
of Australia.<br />
We might think that individually what we do cannot have much<br />
impact, but I believe that is not so. Australia is the sum<br />
of the actions of 14 million Australians.<br />
It is the cumulative effect of those actions that determines<br />
the nature of the society and the kind of life we can give<br />
our children. So what you do is important, not just for<br />
yourself and your own family, but for Australia. </p>
<p>3<br />
Citizenship in its broadest sense involves a knowledge<br />
and an understanding of that.<br />
There are a million people living here in Australia who<br />
are eligible to become Australian citizens but have chosen<br />
not to do so. If they intend to lead out their lives in<br />
Australia, I would urge them to consider sharing our<br />
Australian citizenship.<br />
Those who do not, can still participate in much of our<br />
national life. But there are important responsibilities<br />
and duties which are denied to them unless they become<br />
Australian citizens.<br />
They are not being asked to forget their past, or to forget<br />
their heritage, but build upon that, and to be a part<br />
of Australia. 7000---<br />
