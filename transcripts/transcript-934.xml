FOR JERESS P -M 35/ 2.6-<br />
ANZAC JUBILEE PILGRIMAGE TO GALLIPOLI<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon. Sir Robert Menzies<br />
The Prime Minister ( Sir Robert Menzies) announced<br />
today that the Government had decided to make a grant of<br />
œ C20,000 to the Returned Servicemen's League to assist the<br />
League with its plans to mark the Jubilee of Anzac, which<br />
falls next year, with a pilgrimage to Gallipoli,<br />
" This is an enterprise in which every Australian<br />
can take pride" said Sir Robert. " The Commonwealth Government<br />
is pleased to endorse the plans of the Returned Servicemen's<br />
LTeague for a pilgrimage of the original Anzacs",<br />
The Government believed that those taking part<br />
in the pilgrimage should be in a position to meet their own<br />
fares and other expenses. It was recognised, however, that<br />
there were some Who should obviously be included in the party,<br />
but who would bc unable to do so without some financial<br />
assistance. It had therefore been decided to make a grant<br />
of œ C20,000 to the R. S. L. so that it could assist such people.<br />
The Prime MinistQr said that the Government<br />
believed that it was very appropriate for the Returned<br />
Servicemen's League to attend to the arrangemonts for the<br />
pilgrimage. All enquiries regarding this matter should<br />
therefore be addressed to the R. S. L.<br />
CANBERRA, 22nd May, 1964. </p>
