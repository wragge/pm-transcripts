<p>The Prime Minister of the Solomon Islands, Sir Peter Kenilorea,Â is visiting Australia from 11 to 18 September as a guestÂ of the Australian Government.</p>
<p>During his visit Sir Peter will have discussion with World VisionÂ Australia to advance consideration of World Vision'sÂ rehabilitation program in the Solomon Islands after Cyclone NamuÂ and attend the First National Prayer Breakfast being organised byÂ the Australian Parliamentary Christian Fellowship. Sir Peter willÂ hold discussions with the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, the MinisterÂ for Foreign Affairs, Mr Hayden, and the Minister for Defence, MrÂ Beazley. He will also call on the Chairman of the Foreign AffairsÂ and Defence Committee, Senator Sibraa, the Chairman of theÂ Australian Parliamentary Christian Fellowship, Senator Tate, andÂ the Director-General of the Â Australian Development AssistanceÂ Bureau,Â Dr Dun.</p>
<p>The PrimeÂ Minister said that Sir Peter's visit will furtherÂ strengthen the goodwill and friendship between Australia and theÂ Solomon islands. It would also provide an opportunity for Sir Â Peter to tell the Australian Government personally of theÂ progress being made by the Solomon Islands in reconstructionÂ following Cyclone Namu in May. Australia provided emergencyÂ relief assistance to the Solomon Islands after Cyclone NamuÂ amountingÂ to over $ 4 million and is one of the countriesÂ assisting with post-cyclone reconstruction.</p>
