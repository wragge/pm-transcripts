TELEVISION INTERVIEW WITH MR. NORMAN BANKS<br />
ON CHANNEL GTV9 MELBOURNE<br />
ON 5TH AUGUT, 1963<br />
MR. BANKS: How do you do ladies and gentlemen. On your behalf,<br />
I would like to extend a cordial welcome home to the<br />
Right Honourable the Prine Minister of Australia,<br />
Sir Robert Menzies. How do you do, Sir Robert?<br />
PRIME<br />
MINISTER: Thank you,<br />
QUESTIONER: I would like to suggest at the very outset of this<br />
programme that we at least keep on the subject of<br />
Robert Gordon Menzies as a person instead of Sir<br />
Robert Menzies, Prime Minister, Could we do that?<br />
P. M. Well, it is not a matter on which I am particularly<br />
well-informed.<br />
QO Sir Robert$ talking of names, have you ever had any<br />
nicknames conferred upon you?<br />
P. M. Oh, one or two.<br />
Q. I remember one unsavoury one,.. but in your earlier days.<br />
PM. In my earlier I remember at the old<br />
Grenville College at Ballarat I acquired the nickname<br />
of " Judkins" because I was even then, as a small boy,<br />
given to making speeches in a shelter shed or somewhere,<br />
There was then a famous social reformer<br />
called Judkins, you know. So I became Juddy to my<br />
particular generation at that time. Once when I got<br />
into a cricket team by accident and caught somebody<br />
in slips by accident and the scorer called out,<br />
" Name of the fieldsman, please" the answer was<br />
" Judkins" and that's how it went down.<br />
Q. And how old were you then when you made that first<br />
public speech in the shelter shed?<br />
P. MO Oh, about thirteen or fourteen. I got over it later on.<br />
Q* What, speechmaking?<br />
P. M, Yes. It only came back on to me again years afterwards.<br />
Q. Do you find it difficult making speeches, preparing<br />
speeches or thinking off the cuff?<br />
P. M. Oh, it's not so difficult thinking about it, but it's<br />
a nerve-racking business because every speech is<br />
another task. People think one has no nerves about<br />
speech-aking. I'm as nervous as a cat before I have<br />
to make an important speech. I get over it. First<br />
hint of opposition and I cheer up.<br />
Q, Of course, people viewing Channel 9 network throughout<br />
Australia will be wondering how you feel about televiskn<br />
appearances&amp;<br />
PM. I detest it.<br />
Q. Yes I thought you did. How do you keep so amazingly<br />
fit? You used to hike, didn't you? </p>
<p>-2<br />
P. MO Yes, a lot, but I do very little of it now. I think<br />
the reason for my tolerable state of health is that I<br />
selected my parents well, There is no better reason<br />
than that,<br />
Q* We have a picture of Canberra here. You used to be<br />
seen walking around the streets of Canberra quite a<br />
deal even at night. You seem to have given that away<br />
nows<br />
P. M. Well when I first went to Canberra, the population was<br />
6,006 odd and you could walk around the whole place in<br />
two hours, Now it is 70,000 and so it has got beyond<br />
my scope.<br />
Q. And do you fLind people asking you how to get from A to<br />
B and C to D and so on?<br />
POM. Oh, Itve had a bit of fun on thiat in the old days, yes.<br />
Q. I suppose you gave it away partially because of this<br />
re co gnit ion?<br />
PM. Oh, no. When I used to walk in and out of town from<br />
Kew and came out in the dusk as the hotels came out, I<br />
had some very amusing conversations. In fact, I was<br />
wearing a black homburg hat for some reason or other and<br />
I was addressed as " Your Reverence" three times coming<br />
through Victoria Street. A novel experience for me,<br />
Q9 Sir Robert, what is a normal day for you in Canberra?<br />
What time do you rise, for instance?<br />
P. M, Oh, I rise as late as I conveniently can,-I read the<br />
newspapers when I am in bed. I make my first appointment<br />
at about 10 o'clock in the office and I get home, as a<br />
rule, somewhere between 11 o'clock and midnight.<br />
Q9 Do you work when you get home?<br />
P. M, No.<br />
Q. Do you read?<br />
P. M. I read.<br />
Q. And what do you read?<br />
P. M. Oh, a mixture. All the way from detective stories to<br />
the last historical study written by somebody or other,<br />
I do a lot of reading* I read a lot of poetry, Keeps<br />
the m ind in order,<br />
QO Have you any fLavourite poets?<br />
P. M, You mean Australian poets?<br />
Q 4 Yes.<br />
POM, Yes, well, I think my favourite poets are Juditht Wright<br />
and Douglas Stewart and Kenneth Slessor,<br />
QO What about CJ. Dennis? / 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
P. M, Oh, yes. Oh, well. I was thinking in a different<br />
order, C. J. Dennis, oh yes. It was only the other<br />
day when I went abroad that I took a copy of " The<br />
Sentimental Bloke" with me to give to a friend in<br />
New York.<br />
Q. Do you have time for music?<br />
P. M. You mean as a performer? Noe<br />
Q, Not as a performer but as a listener.<br />
P. M. Very little, but I am very fond of orchestral music.<br />
Chamber music is a little beyond me. I am not musically<br />
educated enough, but I like an orchestra.<br />
Q. Playing what type of music? Opera? Symphony?<br />
P. M" Symphony. Yes.<br />
Q. Sir Robert, do you share Dame Pattie's passion for<br />
camellia s?<br />
P. M, No I like the look of them very much but as she would<br />
tell you if she were here, I am not to be trusted to<br />
distinguish one flower from another. I am pretty<br />
good on roses. I can tell a violet when I see it,<br />
I think I can tell a geranium but sometimes I am wrong,<br />
but really I am not in any sense an expert. When I open<br />
a flower show as I have occasionally, it is a case of<br />
the blind leading the seeing so far as I am concerned,<br />
My wife's a good gardener. She knows all about them.<br />
Q. Do you have any favourite flowers at all? Which would<br />
you prefer in the way of flowers?<br />
P. M. I share her admiration for camellias I assure you.<br />
I think they have beauty and distinchion.<br />
Q6 Looking back on your life, we have two pictures we would<br />
like you to see. One was taken at the age of<br />
POMI Good Heavensl I wasn't bad-looking then.<br />
Q&amp; You've always been very distinguished-looking, Sir<br />
Robert. The other one at 41, You might have noticed<br />
that in each one you are wearing a single-breasted suit.<br />
PIM. I can't tell from here.<br />
QO Well you are. You can take my word for it.<br />
P. M. Well, you must put that down to the eccentricities of<br />
youth.<br />
QO Is this the answer?<br />
POM. D Yes.<br />
Q. But you have been under fire, haven't you., for a<br />
considerable time about your clothing. Only this week<br />
there was a poem written by somebody dedicated to you<br />
about your clothing.<br />
P. M. I thought it was very good.<br />
Q* So did I. I liked the last line particularly. Who does<br />
buy your clothing? Do you always buy it yourself? </p>
<p>P. M. Yes.<br />
Always?<br />
P. M. Yes.<br />
Q. That tie wasn't bought, of course?<br />
P. M, Ye s.<br />
Q* It's a club tie, isn't it?<br />
P. M. Ye s.<br />
Q Most of your ties are club ties?<br />
P. M. 1 W1<br />
ell, a lot of them. That happens to be an M. C. C, tie<br />
London, of which I am a life member, but when you want<br />
a tie, you don't just go along to the Secretary and<br />
say, " Give me one." You go into Jermyn Street into the<br />
appropriate shop and you buy it.<br />
QO Your son, Ken,' was telling me that you have a talent for<br />
picking clothing for other people and I notice that his<br />
inflexion was rather interesting. He said, for instance,<br />
for his children, you can go into a London store and with<br />
great certainty pick the right colours and the right<br />
size for his little children 12,000 miles away.<br />
PIM. Well, I think I am not bad at it, you know. I have had<br />
some success with it. But it is even more difficult to<br />
buy a frock for your wife or for your daughter, and on<br />
that I think' I have had a lot of successi strangely<br />
enough.<br />
Q. You stayed at Chequers for a weekend, didntt you on<br />
this last trip?<br />
Pam* Yes.<br />
QO I wonder We have a picture of Chequers we would<br />
like you to see you don't need to see it, of course,<br />
to remember what it was like but what is the history<br />
of this building? Did Mr. Harold Macmillan tell you<br />
anything about it or did you know in advance?<br />
Pam*. Oh, I've known a good deal about Chequers for a long<br />
time because the first time I visited Chequers was in<br />
the Prime Ministership of Ramnsay MacDonald and that is<br />
going back a fair way. It is a very early 17th<br />
century house around 1600 you can say and at one<br />
stage it was in the possession of the Cromwell familyt<br />
and up in the big gallery at the back of the house, the<br />
long gallery, they have some very interesting Cromwell<br />
souvenirs, including the original of the famous letter<br />
he wrote do you remember, saying, " The Lord made them<br />
like stutble to our swords." 1 It's there, under a velvet<br />
coveriLng.,<br />
Q. I suppose there are some rather wonderful paintings in<br />
there, too.<br />
P. M. Oh, yes. </p>
<p>Q. You are interested in art, aren't you?<br />
P. M. Yes, I am,<br />
Q. In fact haven't you, in your private collection at the<br />
Lodge, a picture by Sir Winston Churchill?<br />
P. M. Yes, well to be precise, we have two. One belongs to<br />
me. It took me eight years to get it. And one belongs<br />
to my wife. She got it without asking for it. That's the<br />
difference between feminine persuasion and masculine.<br />
Q@ What's the subject of the one given to you?<br />
PoM. Oft It's painted in the South of France around Cap<br />
d'ntibes or round there. A fishing boat tied up, a<br />
lighthouse in the background, It's been on exhibition<br />
in Australia, Quite gay colours.<br />
QO Sir Winston had time for hobbies, I think he laid a few<br />
bricks in his time.<br />
P. M. Oh yes, there are two or three cottages at Chertwell<br />
built by him. At least he did the brickwork. Some brick<br />
walls he did, He became a member of the BricklayersT<br />
Union and, of course, as a painter, well, he began have<br />
you read his little book about thaZ?<br />
Q. No,<br />
P. M. He began comparatively late in life, He had been a<br />
prominent politician and he was out of office. Sir John<br />
Lavery the President at that time of the Academy said,<br />
" Why dontt you take up painting for a hobby?" As Winston<br />
had said to me, " I'd never been in a gallery, I wasn't<br />
interested in pictures," but he took it up as a hobby, and<br />
he has turned out to be an extraordinarily good painter<br />
and gets great pleasure out of doing it.<br />
Q6 You've never taken on painting as a hobby?<br />
P. M. No nt since I was a very small boy in the country doing<br />
litle watercolour things at the top of the prize homework<br />
book, you know. That kind of thing.<br />
Q, Of course, your friends who know you well qould probably<br />
say you have laid one or two bricks.<br />
P. M* Dropped them, you mean?<br />
Q9 Well, it's the same thing.<br />
P. M. Oh, no. " Laid" is too polite. " Dropped" is the word,<br />
Q. In this Chequers that we were looking at a moment<br />
Incidentally, can you recall any brick that you did drop<br />
that you have laughed about since? Or worried about since?<br />
P. M, Oh, I'm not a great worrier.<br />
Q0 Aren't you? You don't worry at all?<br />
P. Me Very little, a as e / 6 </p>
<p>6<br />
Q9 Thatprobably accounts for your fitness. But in this<br />
collection at Chequers, was there any painting of unusual<br />
interest that impressed you?<br />
P. M. Yes, there is a very large canvas of the Lion and the<br />
Mouse and the Rat, you know. All of heroic proportions,<br />
and here is the lion struggling with the cords. Winston<br />
looked at this for a long time and then finally decided<br />
that there was no sign of a mouse, so he got a stepladder<br />
and painted one in,<br />
Q0 And is it there to this day?<br />
P. M. It is there to this day.<br />
Q. This is hanging in the main gallery of Chequers?<br />
P. M. Yes, in the main central hall,<br />
Q. Was Mr. Macmillan depressed when you were there?<br />
P. M. I think he was and I don't wonder with all this Profumo<br />
business going on. Some of the most hysterical comments<br />
were being made even by normally dull and respectable<br />
newspapers, and he was worried, of course, because he,<br />
himself is a man of the highest integrity, not to be<br />
associated with any dirty business like this other<br />
business, and so he was undoubtedly worried, When be<br />
spoke in the House I was there and I heard him. He was<br />
obviously a little depressed by what had gone on, but<br />
the next weekend at Chequers, talking up in the gallery,<br />
he was in the top of his form. I've never know~ n him<br />
better more vivid, cheerful, full of wit, full of<br />
historical allusionas because he's a very good historian,<br />
And therefore I saw two men one in the House looking<br />
pretty sad, as I think I would have myself and the other<br />
one out of it, bright, frightfully well-informed, all the<br />
qualities that we know Harold Macmillan to possess.<br />
Q. Do you think that this, nevertheless, could have an<br />
untoward effect on his political career, without being<br />
political here because I don't want to talk politics, on<br />
the party itself?<br />
P. M. Well, frankly, I don't think that the effect of this<br />
business will be permanent. In fact, I was quite sure<br />
that so extravagant wore some of the remarks made that<br />
there would be a reaction in Harold Macmillan's favour<br />
and I think there was in a personal sense. But the<br />
Government itself had apparently been losing ground,<br />
politically, before this Profumo affair ever occurred,<br />
I don't think that in the wash-up, as we would say, the<br />
Profumo case will have any permanent result, though<br />
perhaps it might have caused delay in the recovery of their<br />
stocks that the Government might have been hoping for.<br />
But I am an outsider, I don't know.<br />
Q. Yes, I was just asking for a personal opinion there, Sir<br />
Robert. When you were in London, you spoke, I believe,<br />
with Mr. Selwyn Lloyd about the possibility of the<br />
formation of some economic or trade agreement among<br />
Commonwealth nations which hant come out in the press<br />
so far as I can see in the news. Is there anything you<br />
can say about it? </p>
<p>-7<br />
P. M. Well~ Selwyn came around to see me. He's an old friend<br />
of mine. Hets been very troubled by some of the implications<br />
for the Commonwealth of the Common Market moves and<br />
he had been very impressed by the fact that although<br />
there is an export council operating into America and I<br />
think some form of export council operating into Europe,<br />
there is no body, no export council which is concerned<br />
with improving Commonwealth trade and he told me that this<br />
was the general idea in his mind and did I like it and I<br />
said, " lYes I did", that I would be prepared to encourage<br />
him al~ ong that line. It has to happen in Great Britain,<br />
of course, but the idea of consciously promoting Commonwealth<br />
trade is, of course, a very good one,<br />
Q. Now, we are going to take you up to Edinburgh because<br />
this has been a very rewarding yo~ ar and to my mind, Sir<br />
Robert, there are two highlights from the Australians'<br />
point of view first the admission of you to the Order<br />
of the Thistle and the wonderful honour conferred on you<br />
by the United States of America in inviting you to give<br />
the Jefferson Oration. But can we go to Edinburgh and<br />
see you in the monitor, now Sir Robert? This is how you<br />
were arrayed for the big occasion.<br />
P. M. Gives me a rather sinister appearance, don't you think?<br />
Q. It looks as though you could have been a real Scot. How<br />
did you feel on this occasion? Do you remember the thoughts<br />
that went through your mind? You look pretty grim there.<br />
P. M. Well, you know, I realised for once in my life what it's<br />
like to be somebody who is being looked at on some<br />
ceremonial occasion. ' We don't go in for it much here.<br />
And you go along you are really a mass of self-consciousness.<br />
If you look around and you smile at your friends,<br />
you appear to be smirking you know, taking it all very<br />
lightly. If you go along, looking as no doubt I did , very<br />
grim, people say, " Whatts wrong with the poor fellow?"<br />
It is very difficult but of course, it was an exciting<br />
event, no doubt about that.<br />
Q. Where did you stay in Edinburgh?<br />
P. M* At Holyrood House. The Queen was good enough to invite<br />
my wife and my oldest son and myself to stay there<br />
overnight,<br />
Q. That was very good.<br />
P. M, Yes, particularly for my son who had the op ) ortunity that<br />
otherwise he wouldn't have had of having quite long<br />
conversations with The Queen and with Prince Philip.<br />
Q. He said you were dressed well in advance of the actual<br />
occasion and that you resembled a man padded up, who had<br />
been padded up, for some considerable time to go out to<br />
the batting crease.<br />
P. M. That describes it perfectly, I sympathised with, you<br />
knowr Bill Lawry and people like that. There I was<br />
sitting in the pavilion calling the " pavilion" Holyrood<br />
House, you see all dressed up and nowhere to go,<br />
waiting, wondering whether I would fluff my lines. I<br />
suppose you never have that feeling. e a 9 e 9 / 8 </p>
<p>= 8<br />
Not muchi Sir Robert you went from Holyrood House<br />
then to Signet House. That's alongside the Cathedral<br />
isn't it?<br />
PIM. Yes, Signet Library is across from the front of St. Giles.<br />
You robe there, or you are robed. It's a very complicated<br />
business and each Knight of the Thistle has a man who<br />
robes him and ties all the bows in the right places.<br />
All that kind of thing.<br />
Q, You are trying to make that robe a double-breaster.<br />
P. M* And then you march into the Cathedral where they had<br />
a full house, A lot of school-children singing hymns<br />
as we went into the Chapel of the Thistle which is up<br />
in the far corner, and allowed into the Chapel are The<br />
Queen, of course, the Prince, the Knights of the Thistle,<br />
the Lord Lyon King at Arms who is the great man on these<br />
matters in Scotland, the Green Stick as they ca] 4 himhe's<br />
a very distinguished man the Lean and the.<br />
Minister of St. G. Lles. And when we had gone in there,<br />
the doors were s hut behind us with a clang and the<br />
curtains drawn. Very exclusive, you see. I thought<br />
it was tremendously exclusive until I found out afterwards<br />
that all the proceedings had been broadcast<br />
through the Cathedral. But anyhow, it was a great day,<br />
a great event.<br />
Q. May I ask what was your reaction when you realised that<br />
Hor Majesty The Queen was going to confer this great<br />
honour upon you?<br />
P. M* Well, I don't mind telling you that I didn't know whether<br />
I was coming or going. This was in Canberra. This was<br />
the last thing that I had had in my mind and I probably<br />
wasn't frightfully coherent about it. I know that when<br />
I left her, I struck her Private Secretary in the<br />
corridor and he said to me, it being a suitable time of<br />
day, " Would you like a drink?" I said, " Not only would<br />
I like one, my boy, I need one." That perhaps describes<br />
it.<br />
Q. Did you tell Tho Queen that?<br />
P. M* Oh, yes.<br />
Q4 Did you find her well?<br />
P. M. Very well, I think she is in the top of her form and<br />
that's a great deal.<br />
Q. Well then, you went across the Atlantic and you met<br />
President Kennedy. I think we have a picture of the<br />
President, I felt, looking at the movies that I have<br />
seen on that you were very impressed with this<br />
young President of the United States of America.<br />
P. M. Yes, I am. I know a lot of staunch Republicans in New<br />
York because we do financial business with them, and<br />
therefore I see something of them, but I never make any<br />
secret to them of the fact that I admire President<br />
1Lennedy very much. He's made mistakes, no doubt but he<br />
has learned from them and each time I encounter him, I<br />
find him more and more forthcoming, more and more mature,<br />
clear-minded, not afraid to say what he thinks. I think<br />
this is a very good man. I dont want to appear 0006 001-9 </p>
<p>9-<br />
P. M. patronising about it, He's immeasurably more<br />
( Contd,) significant than any of us, but he is, I think, a<br />
man of' character clear-mrincednoss, conviction sounds.<br />
like an alliteration doesntt it but all those things<br />
are true about him.<br />
Q. Do you think in view of the " winds of change" as Mr.<br />
Macmillan would say, that our destiny maybe is more<br />
with America than the Old Country?<br />
P N. 1 I don't think that's the choice. I can't, myself,<br />
imagine any state of affairs that would produce a<br />
separation botween Australia and the United Kingdom.<br />
Oh no. The blood is too strong for that and feelings<br />
anJ history are too deep for that1 but I am quite<br />
certain that as time goess on, we will become more and<br />
more associated with the United States in matters of<br />
security, in matters of putting out assistance of<br />
various kinds to Asian countries, playing our own<br />
destiny in this part of the world. We will have a<br />
great deal moro and more to do with the United States<br />
but it will be an alliance of friends, not one of those<br />
instinctive, intimate associations that we have with<br />
the Old Country. The two things are not mutually<br />
exclusivee A lot of people seem to make the mistake<br />
of thinking that they are. You can't get on to terms<br />
with the U~ nited States without turning your back on<br />
the Mother Country, they say. Well this is all wrong.<br />
Q, I like to think of the Motherland as the Motherland<br />
and America as a Brotherland,.....<br />
P. M, That's right.<br />
Q. Now, you went to Monticello. This is a tremendous<br />
honour and I am quite sure you felt that way about it<br />
when you gave this oration. Did you keep strictly to<br />
the script which you had prepared in the way of a<br />
speech for this oration?<br />
PGM0 No, I've been struggling for years, Norman, to confine<br />
these special lectures, or whatever they call them,<br />
to about one a year because although I am supposed to<br />
get up and talk out of the top of my head1 I find that<br />
I have to start preparing one of these about three<br />
months ahead and putting in a few hours every now and<br />
then at a weekend in research, in looking up this and<br />
that and in making a few notes, and in the result I<br />
produced this Jefferson Oration as they call it, though<br />
I hate the word. And then when the morning came at<br />
Monticello lovely morning standing on the steps<br />
of Monticello itself and looking at a battery of<br />
microphones.,,.,,<br />
Q6 This is the old Jefferson house?<br />
PM. would interlard my written words by a few<br />
asides you see? Itts an extraordinary thing how<br />
if you look around am audience in broad daylight and<br />
you see half a dozen people you know, they provoke<br />
some observation in your mind and you practically say<br />
something to them immediately between two carefullyprepared<br />
sentences. It brightens it up. I find it<br />
is much better to have an audience laugh occasionally<br />
than sleep all the time. 000 0 .0/ 10 </p>
<p>10<br />
Q You were very impressed, weren't you, with the University<br />
at Charlottesville?<br />
P. M. Tremendously, It is a lovely piece of Palladian architecture<br />
designed, all the old parts, by Jefferson himself.<br />
He was a very remarkable man, Terrific fellow. Architect,<br />
farmer lawyer a very good lawyer a great statesman,<br />
twice hecretary of State under George W~ ashington and Vice-<br />
President, then twice President of the United Statos.<br />
He was a phenomenal man. A bit of an inventor in htig own<br />
way. In fact, I quoted that day something that might<br />
interest you and those who are listening to us. President<br />
Kennedy gave a dinner at the Wdhite House to all the Nobel<br />
Prizewinners and a lot of other high-powered people<br />
great scientists, great humanists a variety of people<br />
in the White House, And he began his speech of wel. come to<br />
them by saying, " Well, gentlemen, I venture to beljeve that<br />
this is the greatest assem~ blage of talent, of human talent<br />
brought together in this room since Thomas Jefferson dined<br />
alone."<br />
Q, Fantastic,<br />
PM. That was a marvellous thing to say. When I had refreshed<br />
my mind about Jefferson about his work I knew a-good<br />
deal but I had to improve on that knowledge I came to<br />
the conclusion that President Kennedy was probably right.<br />
Q. I an sure you did. Sir Robert, it has been wonder fully<br />
kind of you to give us this strictly informal interview<br />
or ya5? n about your recent experiences. I have deliberately<br />
kept off politics and I an sure that met with your approval.<br />
P. M. Well, as a matter of fact, Norman, you see you and I<br />
happen to be old friends. I hope that will do you no harm.<br />
Itts a long time now since you first interviewed me on a<br />
