PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
DOORSTOP, CHARLEVILLE, QUEENSLAND, 29 NOVEMBER 1994<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
J: ( inaudible) What do you think the significant strategy is for other<br />
areas in western NSW and Sunraysia?<br />
PM: Well, let me say I was disappointed about the NSW Premier who didn't<br />
join us in this. We thought that NSW would join us in this strategy and<br />
they didn't. They said they have left it up to the market, but as we<br />
know the market doesn't work in this way, it does need this assistance<br />
and that is why, I think, the enlightened approach from Queensland<br />
and, I hope, the Commonwealth is going to make the strategy work.<br />
But, this has important implications, I think, for the Murray-Darling<br />
system as a co-operative approach. So, some good, I think, will come<br />
of it beyond here.<br />
J: ( inaudible)..<br />
PM: I think that these drought conditions lead to such financial. hardship<br />
that it is often better for people to leave because they will not be able<br />
to recover. But, they need some financial assistance to leave and they<br />
need support after they do leave, but then they leave behind a<br />
property which may then be viable in the hands of another owner, as<br />
an amalgamation. So, that's in part what it is about that is giving<br />
people the counselling, giving them the support, giving them some<br />
financial assistance and caring about them as they make the<br />
transition.<br />
J: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: Well, that is all central to it, I think.<br />
J: ( inaudible)..<br />
PM: Exactly, people won't leave unless of their own free will.<br />
J: Prime Minister, the package that goes before Cabinet next week is<br />
critical for the long term, are you confident that it will get through? </p>
<p>PM: It is a matter of what we want to get through, that is, how we think<br />
these measures ought best be designed to fulfil their purpose and we<br />
are speaking of, certainly from the Commonwealth's point of view, in<br />
terms of the tax system and these other things, how we can do things<br />
which help in the long run. In other words we put into place a system<br />
of policy, a background in policy that will be there in the good times, in<br />
the bad times and the in between times and these are some of the<br />
matters we discussed with the peak farm organisations in the course of<br />
the development of the drought relief policy.<br />
J: There is no point in only half doing it right with these sorts of changes<br />
to the tax system.<br />
PM: Well, when you say half doing it right, there is some sort of implied<br />
implication that the Commonwealth is only half doing it right. I mean,<br />
we have had all of this century to get it right and the irony is that this<br />
will be up to a couple of Labor governments to try to get it right for<br />
rural Australia. But, we will be getting it more right than anyone else<br />
because, I think, we are concerned for the people and we are prepared<br />
to put our heart into it.<br />
J: How long ago was Treasury and Finance..<br />
PM: I've worked pretty well to the Treasury for nearly a decade, so I think<br />
we can handle them.<br />
J: ( inaudible)..<br />
PM: Well, if the Opposition has said it is a stunt, well it is an awfully time<br />
consuming and expensive stunt, but they are now so out of the general<br />
game of the Australian community to be, essentially, a political rump. I<br />
mean, if Bob Menzies didn't vote for them in 1972 and 1975 what<br />
would he think of them now?<br />
GOSS Can I just supplement that. The Queensland Primary Industry Minister<br />
and the Government have been working on this for a couple of years.<br />
There has been a lot of work go into it. Anybody who says that it is a<br />
stunt is not having a go just at the Government, they are having a go at<br />
also a lot of industry people who have worked very hard to get this<br />
together and to get it up today and the other thing that has brought it<br />
together is our approach to the Federal Government which has been<br />
positively received in terms of their support, their financial support.<br />
So, you have got a lot of work by two Governments to try to deal with a<br />
long term problem and you have got a lot of work by local producers<br />
and industry groups and a lot of money. That is not a stunt. It is a lot<br />
of work.<br />
J: ( inaudible)..<br />
PM: It is just that the conditions are so harsh and the financial problems<br />
that come with them focus peoples minds about longer term<br />
approaches and solutions. I think, this is probably as the Premier said,<br />
this strategy was being put together well before the drought started,<br />
but it is probably the fact that the drought has been with us has </p>
<p>accelerated the thinking of governments and communities about how<br />
these things will be done. This wouldn't be the first time that difficult or<br />
catastrophic conditions have created a large community change or a<br />
change in government thinking.<br />
J: Prime Minister, are you looking for other communities to give similar<br />
packages and work out similar strategies?<br />
PM: We think that wherever I mean the comprehensive study we have of<br />
regional Australia, wherever you see regional leadership you see<br />
progress economic and social progress. What would give us heart<br />
from this is that there has been regional and community leadership<br />
here and if that happens governments have got something to work with<br />
and you can work with people who want to refashion their lives and<br />
refashion their communities. So, I think, the message from this is<br />
regional progress is all about regional leadership and that is what we<br />
are seeing here.<br />
J: ( inaudible)...<br />
PM: Providing they work, we have had these lED schemes, variations of<br />
them, over the years and for some people they have been attractive,<br />
they have probably been more attractive for the higher income<br />
earners, that is farmers and graziers with larger properties. The main<br />
thing with any of these income averaging instruments is to get them<br />
right and I think we will try to do that.<br />
J: Prime Minister, we have got the threat of double dissolution<br />
PM: I get asked that question at every press conference and I always give<br />
them the stock answer and that is that we are not intending to have an<br />
election, but nor will we see our important legislation trodden into the<br />
ground by idealogical nonsense. But, as I have said, the Government<br />
is working and working productively and we don't want to see that<br />
interrupted at this stage by a poll.<br />
J: So, no election before 1996?<br />
PM: Well, Prime Ministers would be complete fools to tell journalists about<br />
their options about elections or to give them away. Now, I am not a<br />
complete fool and so I am not giving you anything.<br />
