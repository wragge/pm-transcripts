FOR MEDIA WEDNESDAY, 23 AUGUST 1979.<br />
ADDRESS TO VICTORIAN CHAMBER OF MANUFACTURERS, MELBOURNE<br />
Mr. President, Your Excellency, the Lord Mayor, my Ministerial<br />
colleauges from Canberra and also from the State Government,<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen. Thank you very much Mr. President for<br />
asking me to be with you on this day. I welcome the opportunity<br />
of being able to say one or two things about the Budget and<br />
to be able to talk to you about the way in which the Government<br />
sees the Australian economy moving.<br />
I would first like to compliment you on a sign that is behind<br />
my head, because the reserve forces can't really operate unless<br />
there is co-operation by employers all over Australia.<br />
Members of the reserve forces, I believe, play a very importah.<br />
role in Australia's overall national life and in providing<br />
a reserve capacity significantly to strengthen Australia's<br />
defence. But it can't work, and won't work, without the<br />
co-operation of employer organisations, of individual companies.<br />
Therefore, I was particularly pleased to see your own gentle<br />
advertisement and support for the reserve forces. On behalf of<br />
the Government thank you for that.<br />
Mr. President, I believe that the Budget that John Howard<br />
introduced a couple of nights ago is a particularly good<br />
document because it maintains the strength of the Government's<br />
anti-inflationary policies. I haven't ret anyone saying the deficit<br />
should have been lower. It is an anti-inflationary as anyone<br />
wants. But at the same time, it has been able to provide SOME!<br />
important incentives, concessions, to different elements of<br />
business and to take one or two major initiatives in realising;<br />
our general objectives and goals in social reform. Being able<br />
to do that within overall responsible Budget perameters, having<br />
in mind our first obligation to the health of this economy, is<br />
I think a pleasing one and I hope you can all share in that.<br />
The Budget does have three major objectives: to strengthen the<br />
economic health of Australia; to advance on the progress we<br />
have already made; to encourage further growth and development<br />
in Australian industry; and also to meet some important social<br />
objectives.<br />
The strategy that we have adopted over the last three and a half<br />
years has, I believe, been very very strongly vindicated by<br />
events that have occurred and by the improvements in important<br />
elements of the economy. That is why, of course, the broad<br />
Budget strategy is maintained and if anything, strengthened. / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
For the first time in a number of years civilian employees<br />
and employees in manufacturing industry over the last 12 months<br />
has started to grow quite strongly. While not yet enough to<br />
make any significant dent in the numbers unemployed, civilian<br />
employees over the last 12 months has grown by something over'<br />
60,000. The first time for a number of years when that has<br />
occurred.<br />
Factory production is up in the last year. Over 4 per cent in<br />
real terms. Profitability is also up. I know that you would<br />
alwavs be able to say that profits could be even higher, but<br />
profitability, as I hope you will agree, is improving and in<br />
many cases quite significantly.<br />
Because of improvements in productivity, because of growth within<br />
the economy, and because of the broad thrust of our wages policy,<br />
the real labour costs per unit of output have in fact been<br />
reduced and that has been highly signficant in re-establishing<br />
the competitive base of Australian industry. It is not so long<br />
when in the year to March 1975 and I think a lot of us might<br />
have forg~ otten this award wages rose by 38 per cent in one year<br />
and the Consumer-Price Index rose by about 14 per cent or<br />
per cent in that same year. No wonder there were some imbalances<br />
and difficulties to be overcome against that kind of onslaught.<br />
But over the last period, the annual average growth in award<br />
wages has been about 8 per cent a year. That again, has indicated<br />
a zreasonable degree of restraint and much more than has been<br />
found in manv countries overseas. Again, in spite of the<br />
industrial trouble over the last few months, the movement outside<br />
indexation has been minimal and much less than many people<br />
feared as we approached the Autumn.<br />
As a result of our policies, and despite present pressures,<br />
inflation is down substantially from what it was. But I think<br />
it is worth comparing Australia's performance with what has<br />
happened in a number of other countries. On an annual basis,<br />
inflation to six months in the United States, now stands at<br />
14 per cent. The United Kingdom at 16 per cent. OECD countries<br />
generally by 11.8 per cent and Australia at 9 per cent.<br />
While we can keep our inflation below that of those major countries<br />
Australia becomes more competitive instead of less competitive.<br />
Putting it another around, if you wanted to compare the acceleration<br />
rates, on Australia's inflation and that overseas, in the<br />
United States inflation has accelerated by 28 per cent, the<br />
United Kingdom by 38 per cent, OECD countries generally by<br />
per cent, Japan admittedly from a low base by 66 per cent<br />
and in Germany from a low base by over 90 per cent, Australia<br />
by 2 per cent. A much better performance in maintaining and<br />
containing inflationary pressures than in all of those countries.<br />
As a result of these policies of course the dollar has greatly<br />
strengthened and we are seeing the benefits of that. Competitiveness<br />
has been greatly restored and some Australian manufacturers<br />
are now moving out into export markets in a most enterprising and<br />
imaginative manner. / 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
The volume of manufacturing-. exports in the 9 months to<br />
March was up nearly 20 per cent over the previous period.<br />
Mining and manufacturing investment on projects ready to go<br />
and in the final feasibility stage, stands at about $ 12 billion.<br />
But I note there has been a detailed research by W. D. Scott<br />
which indicates that the sum should be nearly $ 30 billion<br />
over the next five years. I don't make any claims to that<br />
figure. It is a very large figure of prospective investment<br />
and development but that is the figure from W. D. Scott.<br />
There has been international praise for Australia's economic<br />
policies, for a steadfastness-in pursuing those policies and<br />
in responding to the renewed inflationary pressures arising<br />
from results in the Middle East and also from beef prices.<br />
The OECD complements Australia's economic policy. GATT noted<br />
in its last annual report that Australia is the only country<br />
to succeed in achieving a sustained improvement in international<br />
competitive position over the last few years. That, I think,<br />
is a compliment indeed.<br />
There are clearly some undesirable aspects. There are clearly<br />
dangers ahead. Inflationary pressures are rising and we have<br />
had to do something about that. Unemployment remains as a<br />
continuing problem.<br />
The new dangers have largely been introduced by international<br />
pressures on oil and on beef. over the next few months our<br />
inflation will be higher than we anticipated at the time of<br />
the last Budget. But with oil and beef out of it, inflation<br />
to June would have been pretty much on with the Budget estimate<br />
of last year. If we hadn't acted decisively in May, I think<br />
we could then have been justifiably criticised as not<br />
responding to new pressures which had emerged since the time<br />
of the last Budget.<br />
But the Budget itself builds on existing achievements.<br />
It responds to new pressures that have emerged. We don't sit<br />
back and blame what has happened overseas and say we can't<br />
do anything about it. We respond to it appropriately so that<br />
the Australian economy can be put in the strongest possible<br />
position, maybe even more competitive so that we can do better<br />
than North America, as we are, do better than the United<br />
Kingdom and France and many other countries, as we are.<br />
I don't want to hark on the past, but I do want to quote<br />
one or two statistics to show how we are doing better than<br />
countries overseas. But in 1972 inflation was about 5 per cent<br />
and it was below the OECD average. When we took office<br />
inflation was about 17 per cent and 5 percentage points<br />
above the OECD average. In the last six months our inflation<br />
rate has been down to about 9 per cent, nearly 3 percentage<br />
points below the OECD average. So long as we can maintain<br />
that performance, Australian manufacturers, employers, can<br />
have confidence in being able to do better in the Australian<br />
market and being able to get out further into export markets. </p>
<p>-4<br />
There are a number of reasons of course, why our performance<br />
is better: restraint in expenditure, restraint in wages<br />
policy, and responsibility in our overall approach to Government<br />
policy. The Government has restrained expenditure I think much more<br />
than many people realise. Expenditure reached 30.3 per cent<br />
of gross domestic product in 1975-76, and if we compare the<br />
figures on the same basis you have to make an adjustment<br />
for family allowances it is now a little over 27 per cent,<br />
a substantial reduction over the three and a half year period.<br />
I thi4nk it is not generally understood that Commonwealth<br />
Budget outlays in real terms in the three years to 1972, that<br />
is under a former Coalition Government, grew by nearly<br />
per cent a year by 4 3/ 4 per cent a year. Too much.<br />
In the three years subsequent to that they grew by a massive<br />
per cent a year in real terms. That was much too much.<br />
In the last three years, in-spite of some pressures where you<br />
need additional expenditure, real expenditure has been about<br />
static, has grown less than 1 per cent a year. No Government<br />
in the history of Australia, State or Federal, has exercised<br />
that degree of restraint in its own expenditures.<br />
We have rigid ceilings on the Public Service. The number now<br />
is about 12,000 or 13,000 less than when we took office.<br />
If the recruiting programs of our predecessors had remained<br />
in force, there would have been 70,000 public servants more<br />
costing untold sums; more to pay and to house and to provide<br />
the Programs that would keep them partly occupied..<br />
This achievement is all the more notable when you consider the<br />
very real need. for expenditure on social welfare, defence<br />
and if I may say it in scne aspects of support for industry<br />
itself. In social welfare how many of us understand that due to<br />
demographic changes, due to an ageing population, due to the<br />
fact that many returned servicemen from the last world war<br />
are now approaching 60 and therefore qualify for the service<br />
pension, for many reasons, in 1968 there were 176 welfare<br />
recipients for every 1,000 people in the workforce. In 1978<br />
that number had grown in 276 for every 1,000 people in the<br />
workforce. When everyone says to us restrain expenditure, cut out welfare<br />
payments, cut out payments for education, cut out payments<br />
for health, does anyone really mean that we should knock off<br />
or reduce payments to repatriation pensioners. Does anyone<br />
really believe that we should reduce payments or make life harder<br />
for people who are in old age groups and who are receiving the<br />
pension, or invalid pensioners, or to incapacitated people,<br />
because that's where those funds are going in income support<br />
payments to a large part of a slightly ageing Australian population. </p>
<p>Quite obviously those figures 176 for evpry 1,000 in the<br />
workforce to 276 for every 1,000 spell out in stark terms<br />
the additional calls on a Commonwealth Budget. They are not<br />
calls, I may say so, that fall on State Governments and<br />
their Budgets, because it is we who have the responsibilityfor<br />
income support payments for those in the Australian community<br />
who need it. If people say we should cut into this<br />
expenditure let them be very particular about it and say<br />
precisely which income support payments they want reduced, cut<br />
out or abandoned. Nobody advocates cutting those particular<br />
paymentI--s. Wie haven't done it.<br />
But then let's look at defence. This year we are providing<br />
over $ 280 million more, nearly 11 per cent over last year,<br />
because we believe there is a very real defence need and we<br />
believe it would be wrong if we didn't spend additional<br />
sums on defence.<br />
Also, much greater sums are being spent on support for industry,<br />
export incentives in particular $ 20 million to $ 170 million<br />
in a year. Admittedly some back payments being caught up, but<br />
a much more expensive program than we envisaged when it was<br />
introduced because it has been much more successful than any<br />
one dared to predict when it was first introduced. That is a<br />
good thing. I hope it is more successful in the future.<br />
That has just been a larger charge on the Commonwealth<br />
Budget in future years if that is what has happened. But we<br />
won't cry about that. We will be glad because that is the<br />
purpose of that particular proposal.<br />
But in defence, we have been able to lift the sum spent<br />
on capital equipment from 7 per cent to 15 per cent of<br />
the Budget. We have been able to reduce the amount spent on<br />
wages from 60% to about 50% of the defence budget, getting<br />
better value for dollar, putting more money into hardware<br />
and infrastructure where it permanently improves the quality<br />
of Australian defence. We try and spend as much as we can<br />
on Australian equipment. There is a defence industrial<br />
committee. It maintains close links with industry. The<br />
Government has very particular programs designed to make sure!<br />
that defence dollars are spent in Australian industries wherever<br />
that is possible. We do that for all dollars spent by the<br />
Commonwealth Government in its purchasing programs.<br />
Jim Killen,' in 15 or 20 minutes time will be making a statement<br />
on defence in the Federal Parliament. One element of that<br />
is a particularly pleasing one and I hope you also will be<br />
pleased with it. Two years ago we had a Cabinet submission<br />
which would have involved giving a contract to a French firm,<br />
I think French but certainly overseas, for the construction of<br />
a major supply ship for the Australian defence forces. Vic Garland<br />
will correct if I am wrong but I think the contract was<br />
something like $ 70 million or $ 80 million. We said: " Look, this<br />
isn't good enough. we think Australian industry has not been<br />
given an adequate opportunity to compete. We want you to go<br />
back to Australian industry, back to Australian firms and<br />
see if we can't place this contract in Australia. Even if that<br />
does mean some delay in getting the new vessel into defence<br />
service" / 6 </p>
<p>-6<br />
My colleague, the Minister, will be announcing that that<br />
contract has now been placed with an Australian firm and<br />
we haven't had to give any preference. We would have it we<br />
had had to. But we haven't had to give any preference in<br />
terms of dollars and price for the Australian contractor<br />
because they have beaten the overseas contractor by many<br />
millions of dollars in their final tender.<br />
That is an area where people said Australians can't do it,<br />
Australian industry can't do it. Well they can and they have<br />
and it is time, I believe, that we began to take a greater<br />
pride in the capacity to perform, of Australians, of Australian<br />
workmen and of Australian industry and entrepeneurs.<br />
I think there is a capacity of many of us who could well<br />
exhibit that Dride in Australian workmanship.<br />
How many people now drive expensive imported cars because<br />
they are expensive imported cars, instead of buying a<br />
world-class home made product. One of the things you might<br />
have noticed in the Budget, there is a gentle inducement<br />
to buy the home made product instead of the expensive<br />
imported cars.<br />
Mr. President, the Budget reduces the deficit very very<br />
substantialy indeed, from nearly $ 3 billion to $ 2.193 million,<br />
a reduction from 3.4% of gross domestic product to 1.9% of<br />
gross domestic product. That is a most significant change,<br />
a most significant advance in this Budget. The estimated<br />
deficit is a lower percentage of the gross domestic product<br />
than would occur in Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom and<br />
Canada and many other countries. We have done better than<br />
most OECD countries in getting the burden of over-large deficit<br />
down in this Budget.<br />
In particular the estimated domestic deficit this year will be<br />
just under $ 900 million, much less than half that of last year.<br />
This is important, because it leaves room within the markets<br />
for private sector demands. It assists very greatly in the<br />
conduct of -monetary policy, especially given the containment<br />
of capital raising programs of semi and local governments,<br />
a decision which we came in for a mild degree of criticism<br />
about over the course of last June. Of course, it means that<br />
there can be greater funds for business investment and generally<br />
for housing.<br />
It obviously exerts a further downward pressure on inflation<br />
which was sorely needed, but obviously further strengthens<br />
the Australian dollar and thus helps create the conditions<br />
for continued expansion and confidence in business.<br />
As I believe there are some hard-headed people who have been<br />
making those very judgements over the last two days. I don't<br />
believe people invest on the share market just to boost the<br />
Government's confidence or to make other people feel that the<br />
Budget was a good one. They spend their dollars in a hard-headed<br />
way. A few people on the share markets have been voting a vote<br />
of confidence in Australia over the last couple of days. </p>
<p>7<br />
There is an odd argument going on at the moment. Some people<br />
are saying that a tax cut is not a tax cut. Well, if anyone<br />
wants to say that a tax cut is not a tax cut, let them volunteer<br />
now to give the tax cut from the 1st of December back<br />
to the Federal Treasury. I don't think there will be too many<br />
volunteers for that.<br />
But if people want to argue that there should have been tax<br />
indexation instead of a tax cut, that is a fair enough argument<br />
and I can understand it. But if people want to argue that an<br />
an income rises, they should not pay income tax on those greater<br />
dollars that they earn, I think that is the greatest piece of<br />
humbug and nonsense that I have ever heardin my life. If<br />
people have a larger income, obviously they expect to pay tax<br />
on the additional dollars they earn. But there is a tax cut.<br />
I could understand it if people say it should be greater. I<br />
can understand it if they said it should have been tax<br />
indexation instead of the tax cut.<br />
Last May, John Howard said we could not afford both. He didn't<br />
even say we could afford one. But we have been able to afford<br />
one of them and we remain just as firmly committed as we ever<br />
did to tax indexation, but only when we can do it financially<br />
and responsibly. We are also looking for some assistance to<br />
the wages tribunals in being able to establish those<br />
responsible conditions by an exhibition of some restraint in<br />
wage decisions.<br />
The Budget re-emphasises our commitment to monetary and<br />
fiscal responsibility, to the reduction of inflation and<br />
to an environment which will encourage growth and development.<br />
It is a Budget in which income taxes have been lowered<br />
in which there is a degree of smaller government and an<br />
increased role for private enterprise and for private<br />
initiative without which the wealth and prosperity of any nation<br />
will wither and die.<br />
There are policies in the Budget which promote growth, promote<br />
development. It does embody some special policies for<br />
business, for the rural community, for a further amplication<br />
of our energy programs. It builds on past policies. You well<br />
know what we have done with the investment allowance, with the<br />
expanded charter for the Development Bank, now being able<br />
to lend to all business sectors. The changes to the Industries<br />
Assitance Act-amended to take account of Government policy<br />
and employment and social consequences of its recommendations,<br />
something which it doesn't seem to do entirely even with those<br />
causes in the legislation.<br />
The Government has established preference for Australian<br />
products for all its own purchases, and in some cases a very<br />
substantial preference.<br />
In 1978 we reduced the sales tax on new motor cars and now<br />
there are some new initiatives designed to encourage development<br />
of more efficient, export-oriented and competitive industries.<br />
Division 7 tax which I suspect some of you have heard of<br />
the first Budget increased the retention allowance from 50% to<br />
That is now increased to 70%. That is a help for small<br />
businesses.../ </p>
<p>8-<br />
Export expansion grants have vastly increased fromn $ 20 million to<br />
$ 170 million through the course of this year. Some of that<br />
is picking up a backlog in payments, but the final demand<br />
through this year would even be to an extent higher than that<br />
if the program continues to expand as it has up to the<br />
present time.<br />
Export market development grants are up very substantially.<br />
Industrial research and development, under Ian Macphee's<br />
guidance, came to $ 24 million last year, $ 24 to $ 32 million<br />
this year, aiding initiative and enterprise throughout<br />
Australian industry. A depreciation allowance for<br />
tax purposes on buildings providing traveller accommodation,<br />
encouraging people to pay more attention to the development<br />
and expansion, the great opportunities open to Australia<br />
through an expanded tourist industry.<br />
For the rural community, the special depreciation allowance<br />
reappears for special storage facilities, for grain, hay or<br />
fodder. I imagine that would put a gleam in some primary<br />
producers eyes.<br />
The national water resources program has been expanded by<br />
The main elements of our energy program is designed<br />
to promote conservation of a scarce resource, designed to<br />
encourage people to move into alternative supplies of energy,<br />
designed to encourage exploration and development.,<br />
Import parity pricing for oil is an essential part, an<br />
essential wea; pon in pursuing those three basic and vitally<br />
important objectives.<br />
But there are other policies to encourage the use of L. P. G.<br />
Commonwealth cars are going to be LPG fired wherever that<br />
is possible, for the future. We have removed sales tax on<br />
conversion kits. The Budget continues this thrust. The<br />
conversion cost from oil-fired industrial equipment there<br />
will be a 40% investment allowance if it is new equipment<br />
and it will be written off immediately if it is a question<br />
of conversion of existing equipment away from oil.<br />
In addition to that, the advantages and encouragement for<br />
offshore exploration for oil is now being extended to onshore<br />
exploration for oil. That again, I would hope, will encourage<br />
greater exploration. I also hope greater exploration by<br />
Australian firms who might better be able to meet the costs and<br />
obligations of the search onshore than offshore.<br />
In terms of our broad social objectives, the decisions we<br />
have made have been fair and they advance the cause of social<br />
reform. Because inflation, for reasons that we all knfow, is<br />
higher than we envisaged at the time of the last Budget, pensions<br />
are indexed twice a year and not once.<br />
But other things I think have been overlooked. Over three years<br />
we have provided funds for 15,000 beds for aged and disabled<br />
people through the programs of this Government. Through a<br />
period of financial stringency we haven't forgotten obligations<br />
to people who need assistance. / 9 </p>
<p>I 9<br />
Over the last three years there has been a tremendous<br />
expansion of assistance for disabled people through<br />
sheltered workshops and special programs to assist them.<br />
The Budget continues and builds on those programs. The<br />
eligibility for pensioner health cards is going to be ext6nded<br />
to supporting parent beneficiaries and their are extensive<br />
changes in assistance in the repatriation area.<br />
The Budget is not just an economic docient. It is also a<br />
broad social document and one of important social consequence.<br />
Ultimately our capacity to advance in a social sense, depends<br />
upon the strength of the Australian economy, what we can do<br />
for ourselves and the kind of world we are living in.<br />
I would like to conclude by just talking for a moment or<br />
two about the kind of trading world we find now and which<br />
I expect to see into the 1980s.<br />
It is not a particularly encouraging one, but that doesn't<br />
make me gloomy or pessimistic about Australia's prospects.<br />
Far to the contrary. For a whole number of reasons inflation<br />
is too high and growth in world trade is too low. Growth in<br />
trade over the last 7 or 8 years has been about 4 per cent<br />
year. Not enough to reduce the numbers of unemployed in the<br />
advanced western countries. In the previous 20 years it ran<br />
at about 8 per cent a year, through the years of low inflation.<br />
Unless the major countries can reduce their inflation, growth<br />
in world trade is likely to be low and unemployment around the<br />
world is likely to stay high.<br />
I think -the greatest prospects for being able to achieve<br />
a breakthrough on the world inflation front is if after they<br />
get through their present time of difficulties the United Kingdom<br />
can join Germany and Japan and the three of them persuade<br />
other major industrialised countries, and North America, that<br />
they have to pay much greater attention to the inflation problem<br />
than they have over recent years.<br />
But even if that doesn't happen where. does Australia stand?<br />
I believe we can have confidence in ourselves. Even if the<br />
world see it as a difficult one and a sluggish one, there is<br />
no need for us to be timid about our own future, because we<br />
have many advantages and it is up to us to develop those<br />
advantages and explore them to the full.<br />
Our inflation is under that of many other countries. It is<br />
our intention that it stay that way, so Australian industries<br />
will become more competitive, will get out further into<br />
overseas markets exports to new countries and that will<br />
provide more jobs, more work, more opportunties for Australians.<br />
But also, if we maintain economic and political stability,<br />
maintain a tightly run ship in economic terms, we have a great<br />
capacity to attract investment to this country, as indeed we<br />
have over the last year or two. Approvals made<br />
by the Foreign Investment Review Board in the June Quarter were<br />
running at an all time high about $ 1,400 million worth of<br />
approvals in that particular quarter. $ 2,000 million worth of<br />
new development and investment in the coal industry. </p>
<p>$ 2,000 million worth in thealuminium-bauxite industry.<br />
That is because Australia possesses resources, provides<br />
a stable environment and economic policies that are<br />
encouraging growth and investment and development.<br />
Therefore, because we can run our economy well, because<br />
we are a resource-rich nation and we are attractive and<br />
have policies that are attractive to overseas investment,<br />
there are greater opportunities for people to work in<br />
partnership with Australia, help develop those resources<br />
and provide greater opportunities and work for Australians.<br />
Government policies reinforce that.<br />
The infrastructure financing proposals agreed to with the<br />
States involve the expenditure for something approaching<br />
$ 2,000 million over the next few years $ 450 million this<br />
year on great infrastructure developments that will reinforce<br />
the resource projects undertaken by private enterprise.<br />
So, even if world trade is sluggish, with the right policies<br />
we can, if you like, a larger share than we otherwise would,<br />
maintain Australia in a securer position, provide more<br />
activity and opportunities for Australians than would otherwise<br />
be the case. But it is up to us to capture the opportunities,<br />
to have confidence in ourselves and if we do that, there is<br />
nothing that we can't achieve. 000---</p>
