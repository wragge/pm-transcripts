PRESS STATEM. ENT NO. 165<br />
19 December 1973<br />
INDUSTRIES ASSISTANCE COMMISSION<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr. Whitlam, announced today<br />
that all reports of the new Industries Assistance Commission<br />
which would not cause damaging speculation would be made public<br />
as soon as they were printed. The new Industries Assistance<br />
Commission will come into operation on 1 January. The Prime<br />
' l1inister also said that he would honour his promise that the<br />
Government should deal with reports from the Commission within<br />
3 months of the Government receiving the reports. This would<br />
eliminate the excessive delays which industries suffered under<br />
the previous Government when in some cases Tariff Board reports<br />
were not dealt w. 4th for periods greater than a year. l. n<br />
undertaking to make public as many reports as possible, as<br />
soon as possible, Mr. Whitlam said the Government had decided<br />
to ask the Commission to indicate in each report whether its<br />
release would be likely to cause speculation. Only in special<br />
cases such as those involving negotiations with State<br />
Governments. would action by the Australian Government in.<br />
dealing with reports from the Commission be delayed, M4r. Whitlam<br />
said. Mr. WAhitlam. announced the names of the seven<br />
Commissioners appointed to the Industries Assistance Commission.<br />
The Chairman will be Mr. G. A. Rattigan, Chairman of the Tariff<br />
Board. The other Commissioners will be Messrs. D. J. Pekin,<br />
N. y. Watson, R. Boyer, G. Johnson, C. Conron and D. McBride.<br />
Mr. Watson's appointment extends to June 1974.<br />
He will be appointed to the temporary Advisory Authority from<br />
1 January and will remain with the Industries Assistance<br />
Commission only until inquiries commenced by the division<br />
of the Tariff Board of wh:; ch he is the presiding member are<br />
completed. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
Mr. Whitlam said the Industries Assistance<br />
Commission Act provided for the appointment of associate<br />
Commissioners to help with Commission inquiries. Appointments<br />
of associate Commissioners would be made as future needs arose.<br />
Members of the Tariff Board who are not being appointed as<br />
members of the Commission, have been offered appointment<br />
as associate Commissioners for the remaining period of their<br />
terms as members of the Board.<br />
Mr. Whitlam said that the new Industries<br />
Assistance Commission would cover not only manufacturing<br />
industry as the Tariff Board did, but would advise this and<br />
future Governments on assistance for industries in all sectors<br />
of the economy. He believed that as far: as possible, the<br />
processes whereby public policies were determined should be<br />
open to public scrutiny. In the interests of open government, Mr.<br />
Whitlam stressed there should be the widest participation<br />
in the public inquiries conducted by the Commission.<br />
There should also, when possible, be full and informed public<br />
discussion of the Commission's report D the Government. </p>
