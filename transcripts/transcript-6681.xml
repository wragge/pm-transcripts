CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
OPENING OF NEW SURGICAL OPERATING SUITES REPATRIATION<br />
GENERAL HOSPITAL DAW PARK<br />
ADELAIDE 1 AUGUST 1985<br />
Senator Gietzelt, Mr Cornwall, representatives of<br />
ex-service organisations, ladies and gentlemen<br />
It gives me considerable pleasure to be here today on<br />
the occasion of the offical opening of the new Daw Park<br />
surgical operating suites.<br />
It is particularly pleasing to be part of such a<br />
wide-ranging gathering with representation from the<br />
ex-service community; the State C'overnment; the<br />
-Flinders Medical Centre and others concerned with the<br />
provision of health and hospital services; the staff of<br />
this hospital and the Department of Veterans' Affairs;<br />
and those who have been involved with the design and<br />
construction of this important and high-standard<br />
facility. The presence of all of you here today is<br />
clear proof that the facilities available and the<br />
services provided at Daw Park have an importance<br />
extending well beyond the ' Teterans community into the<br />
wider Adelaide and South Australian health care network.<br />
The project recently completed here at Daw Park, which<br />
includes the refurbishment of existing wards as well as<br />
the new surgical operating complex, is not unique.<br />
The Australian Labor Government has given a very high<br />
priority to refurbishment and construction work<br />
throughout the Repatriation General Hospital network in<br />
Australia. Spending on Repatriation General Hospitals has increased<br />
by $ 43 million in the past two Budgets. This is in no<br />
small measure due to the persistent advocacy of the<br />
Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Senator Gietzelt. </p>
<p>He quickly alerted the Government to the state of the<br />
repatriation hospitals when he was appointed Minister in<br />
March 1983. He made it clear that years of neglect had<br />
le3t staffing levels inadequate, morale low and the<br />
standard, of equipment and facilities poor.<br />
Senator Gietzelt sought quickly to remedy the problems<br />
and commissioned a review of the Repatriation Hospital<br />
system by a committee led by Doctor Ian Brand. That<br />
committee's report has now been received and its<br />
wide-ranging recommendations warrant, and will receive,<br />
careful consideration by the Minister and the<br />
Government. They will be addressed against the background of the<br />
commitment I gave in the national policy speech before<br />
last year's election " to continue upgrading repatriation<br />
hospitals to meet the needs of an ageing veterans<br />
community." That was a firm, unequivocal pledge and one<br />
which, as you can see here today, we are intent on<br />
implementing. I should like to take this opportunity to clear the air<br />
on one aspect of the Brand Review Report. Contrary to<br />
media suggestions, the Review did not say that<br />
Repatriation Hospitals should be " dumped" on the states.<br />
What the Review observed was the inevitability of<br />
ultimate integration of the Repatriation General<br />
Hospitals with State health systems. Clearly what is<br />
needed is careful planning for any such eventuality.<br />
Integration simply means working closely with the State<br />
system to guarantee the best possible treatment without<br />
duplicating services.<br />
The precise form the integration process will take in<br />
the future is still to be determined. But it will mean<br />
that closer co-ordination and consultation will be<br />
required between State authorities and the Repatriation<br />
General Hospitals. It will also mean, especially with<br />
an ageing veteran population, that a particular effort<br />
shouldbe made to provide services, including hospital<br />
services, closer to home.<br />
That said, I can assure you that there will continue to<br />
be Repatriation Hospitals operating as an important and<br />
visible element in the overall treatment system for<br />
Veterans and war widows for many years to come.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, my Government is spending more on<br />
Veterans' Affairs than any previous Government. In<br />
fact, in the two and a half years we have been in office<br />
spending on Veterans' Affairs has increased by more than<br />
per cent. </p>
<p>The Government is committed to the care of Veterans and<br />
war widows and that commitment is visible in the<br />
development of the Daw Park surgical facilities.<br />
All South Australians will benefit from this development<br />
because Daw Park is a teaching-hospital associated with<br />
the Flinders University of South Australia and the<br />
Flinders medical Centre.<br />
most of all, it will benefit Veterans and war widows<br />
whose efforts for their country in its hour of need<br />
deserve the best of facilities and services.<br />
I know that many of you have a keen interest in the<br />
Veterans' Entitlement Bill which is now being developed<br />
through a process of intense consultation with all<br />
affected parties. In this regard, I should particularly<br />
like to mention the involvement and invaluable advice<br />
provided by the RSEJ National President, Sir William<br />
Keys. The services of Judge Paul Toose have also been<br />
retained to advise the RSL and other ex-service<br />
organisations. This will assist greatly in preparing a i<br />
bill which will be acceptable to the ex-service<br />
community and to the Government. A good deal of<br />
progress is being made and we can all appreciate that<br />
there is now a constructive and ccoerative approach to<br />
this task.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, on this important day in the<br />
history of this Repatriation General Hospital, I could<br />
not conclude without expressing my thanks to all<br />
concerned at Daw Park for their work in providing care<br />
to our Veteran community; particularly the visiting<br />
Medical Officers, the Visiting Medical Specialists and<br />
the staff doctors, nurses, allied health<br />
professionals, ward staff, orderlies and domestic<br />
services staff and clinical teams.<br />
The work you do is important and is appreciated not only<br />
by your patients, but by the community at large. I<br />
should expect that the facilities I shall now proceed to<br />
open, will make your task easier and more satisfying.<br />
They certainly add a qualitatively new dimension to this<br />
important hospital. 1.; </p>
