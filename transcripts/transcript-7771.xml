PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH STEVE RAYMOND, RADIO 2WS<br />
OCTOBER 1989<br />
E OE PROOF ONLY<br />
RAYMOND: Prime Minister, thank you for your time.<br />
PM: My pleasure Steve.<br />
RAYMOND: The dynamics of setting an election date. I'm<br />
just curious to know the factors preventing you from<br />
completely ruling out December here and now.<br />
PM: It's what I've been saying is that overwhelmingly I<br />
think the election will be next year. I guess no Prime<br />
Minister is ever going to say that there isn't some<br />
circumstance that might arise but to all intents and<br />
purposes I'm talking about what I've been talking all along.<br />
That's 1990 Steve.<br />
RAYMOND: So the bottom line is you go when you've got your<br />
best chance of winning?<br />
PM: I'd be the first Prime minister in all of recorded<br />
history I think who wouldn't regard it as a relevant<br />
consideration to try and maximise your chances. I mean it'd<br />
be peculiar if you didn't do that. But essentially what's<br />
happened since I've been elected in ' 83 is I went in ' 84<br />
then to get the coincidence of the Senate and the House of<br />
Representatives. was ' 84, it was three years to ' 87.1<br />
went in ' 87. 1990 would be the normal thing to do.<br />
RAYMOND: would a December date be an admission on your part<br />
that you can't get interest rates in sync with your<br />
re-election timetable?<br />
PM: No it wouldn't be. I've said on interest rates that<br />
they will two related things about that. Firstly I'm<br />
not an idiot. I don't like interest rates being high.<br />
They're not up there for fun. They won't be up there, high,<br />
for a day longer than is economically responsible. But I<br />
won't take them off a day earlier than is appropriate. We<br />
believe that the tight settings we've got Steve, fiscal<br />
policy, wages and monetary policy, are going to produce a<br />
gradual slowing of the economic activity so we can get a<br />
level of imports that we can live with. When we see that<br />
then we can ease off monetary policy. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
RAYMOND: What I was saying in layman's terms was if you did<br />
go in December it might be an indication that, well, that<br />
it's not going to get any better between December and May of<br />
next year.<br />
PM: As I say from my earlier answer, it's a very very<br />
hypothetical situation.<br />
RAYMOND: You'd probably baulk if I said steamrolling, but<br />
isn't it true of late you've been asserting your personal<br />
authority to get Cabinet to back your political judgement.<br />
I'm thinking of compensation for the airlines, * Kodak<br />
assistance and Kakadu last week.<br />
PM: I think in regard to Kakadu a somewhat unusual thing<br />
happened in there in this respect. The meeting we had in<br />
this past week was not the first consideration of it. we'd<br />
considered it a week or so before. So we came to it with<br />
general arguments having been considered. I'd thought about<br />
it a lot and I thought well the best thing I'd say to my<br />
colleagues is this is what I think ought to happen at<br />
the beginning of it. I did that and so people were<br />
discussing it in the framework in the clear understanding of<br />
what I thought was best. way this Cabinet has operated<br />
since 1983. that I tend to let them talk through it and<br />
as it becomes clear what I think ought to happen I don't<br />
think there's been one situation in six and a half years in<br />
which my view hasn't prevailed. I don't say that in a<br />
dogmatic way in any sense but that has been the case. We<br />
don't take votes in the Cabinet. Generally people think<br />
that well he's the bloke that's in charge, he's the bloke<br />
that's got to go and sell the Government's position and who<br />
has the responsibility. If it goes well he gets support, if<br />
it goes badly he gets a kick in the backside. So in these<br />
past few occasions I've certainly had a view that these<br />
things ought to happen and that view has prevailed. But<br />
that in a sense is not basically different to what's<br />
happened for six and a half years.<br />
RAYMOND: Are you as dirty on Sir Arvi Parbo, the Chairman<br />
of BHP, as he appears to be on you and your Government,<br />
saying you can't be trusted?<br />
PM: It's interesting. After an interview I did this<br />
morning, in which I made it quite clear that the position<br />
wasn't being put accurately about the phone call he'd made<br />
to me, I spoke to Sir Arvi because I thought it sensible<br />
that I do so. I must say with full respect to Sir Arvi that<br />
he said quite straightforwardly that what I was saying about<br />
the phone call was absolutely correct and I think by now<br />
he's probably indicated that publicly. I've got no desire<br />
in these things to have personal antagonisms. There's an<br />
issue there and as I said to Sir Arvi well if you'd like to<br />
talk about that at some stage then we can talk about it. He<br />
indicated that he'd like to do that. So at some stage we'll<br />
talk about it. </p>
<p>-3-<br />
RAYMOND: The pilots' dispute. After two months you<br />
certainly appear to be on the winning side. Is it fair to<br />
suggest though, with the position you hold and with your<br />
powers of persuasion, you should've been able to knock heads<br />
together and get a resolution long before two months was up?<br />
PM: Well it's fair enough for you to suggest it but it's<br />
not an accurate reading of the situation. Because people<br />
say Hawke you were the great negotiator, the skilled person<br />
bringing people together. Well that's true. I was. I was<br />
the best in that country.<br />
RAYMOND: Modesty aside.<br />
PM: Not modesty. A factual statement. I was the best.<br />
Given that sort of situation again I still would be. But<br />
what you had here was something different. You had a<br />
situation where there was a Federation which simply said as<br />
its basic position it was not going to be in the wages<br />
system. It was alright for all your ordinary listeners, all<br />
their husbands or their wives, alright for every other<br />
person in the community to be bound by a wages system which<br />
had created this enormous surge of employment in this<br />
country, more than twice as fast as the rest of the world.<br />
That's happened because the workers of this country, to<br />
their great credit, have exercised considerable restraint.<br />
There have been improvements in the social wage to<br />
compensate for otherwise larger increases in money wages.<br />
But the pilots said, no, we'll grab all the benefits in the<br />
social wage, we'll be the greatest beneficiaries of the tax<br />
cuts that have been associated with it, all the other<br />
things, but we want the extra money wage increases as well.<br />
So we weren't in the same playing field for me to an umpire<br />
or a negotiator. They said we are not going onto that<br />
playing field. As far as I was concerned from day one what<br />
was at issue was not the pilots' wage claim as such but what<br />
was an issue was to whether all your listeners and all of<br />
the ordinary people around Australia, whether their<br />
commitment to an orderly wage system and all the benefits<br />
that have gone with it, whether that was going to be saved<br />
or not. They said we're not on that playing field. So from<br />
day one as far as I was concerned the situation was, very<br />
well, you absolutely say that's your position. I pleaded<br />
with them at the beginning. I said come into the system,<br />
negotiate, some increases there. They said no. In that<br />
situation there was only one thing and that was,<br />
particularly when they ordered their people to resign, which<br />
they did, so there was no employment nexus between the<br />
Federation and its members and the airlines. It was simply<br />
a question then, airlines recruit and get the thing going.<br />
I was not going to have Australia knocked over by these<br />
people. RAYMOND: How will it end? A KO or a points victory? </p>
<p>-4-<br />
PM: Quite frankly I'm not looking at it in terms of<br />
victory. If you go back to the previous situation you talk<br />
about where I used to organise resolutions for dispute. I<br />
never, as you know, look at the record when we had that<br />
great fight in regard to retail price maintenance. I guess<br />
it could be said we knocked people out there. I got the<br />
bloke in and said I'm not interested now in saying that<br />
we've won, knocked you out and I'm not here, I mean it's not<br />
about saying Hawke won and the other mob lost. The winners<br />
in this will be Australia. The ordinary people, your<br />
ordinary listeners. They are the people that are going to<br />
win out of this.<br />
RAYMOND: Alright. Because of the pilots' situation,<br />
tourism at the moment, a suggestion. Why not make, for the<br />
remaining life of your Government, tourism a single status<br />
ministry and reinstate John Brown who has the confidence of<br />
the stricken industry?<br />
PM: Of course he has the confidence but to John Brown's<br />
great credit he hasn't been inactive. He's been very very<br />
active. I've been talking with him. He's very very much<br />
involved in this. John's retiring at this next election.<br />
RAYMOND: I said the remaining life<br />
PM: Yes I know but you're talking obviously a period of<br />
six, seven, eight months at the most. John wouldn't want<br />
that. What I give John Brown enormous credit for since he's<br />
been out of the ministry is he hasn't ceased to maintain,<br />
not just a formal interest, but a dedicated and involved<br />
interest with tourism. He's talked to me a lot, made some<br />
suggestions which have been very helpful.<br />
RAYMOND: A few personal questions. If Labor wins a fourth<br />
term do you intend to remain leader throughout and head the<br />
fifth election campaign?<br />
PM: I've said that I would go through the next full term<br />
then after that one has to start wondering as to how<br />
long you keep going. As I said I'm in the fortunate<br />
position there was life before politics for me and there'll<br />
be a very interesting life after politics.<br />
RAYMOND: The other side of the coin. If you were to lose<br />
this time around are you prepared for the hard slog of being<br />
an opposition leader for three years?<br />
PM: A hard slog's never worried me. I've worked hard all<br />
my life, very hard. I enjoy hard work. So a hard slog is<br />
not something that worries me. It will be another set of<br />
considerations as to whether I'd want to do that. But hard<br />
slog doesn't worry me. It never has.<br />
RAYMOND: How do you feel about it at the moment though? </p>
<p>PM: we're going to win. I've never regarded it as a useful<br />
exercise in life to wonder about what if, either forward or<br />
backwards. I get on and deal with things as they are.<br />
RAYMOND: This is not intended to be disrespectful.<br />
PM: Thank you Steve.<br />
RAYMOND: Nice qualification.<br />
PM: Yes, here comes whack.<br />
RAYMOND: Have you at least to some degree become addicted<br />
to the power?<br />
PM: No.<br />
S RAYMOND: The lifestyle?<br />
PM: No. I'm sure you can ask anyone with whom I'm<br />
associated, anyone, and they will tell you that power is not<br />
something which Hawke gets carried away by. I mean I lead<br />
an ordinary sort of existence. As an ordinary sort of<br />
existence as I can. obviously I live at the Lodge, I live<br />
at Kirribilli. That's not ordinary. So I'm not trying to<br />
be silly about it. But I go to the races, I love going to<br />
the races. I was there yesterday, I went to the races in<br />
Canberra. It was Canberra Cup day. I just move around<br />
amongst the people. The trappings of power have never never<br />
interested me. All the business of the 19-gun salutes and<br />
that sort of thing, it's something that you've got to<br />
tolerate and go through. It never ever has me. I've<br />
always like to, in 30 years of public life, the thing that<br />
I've enjoyed most is getting round and meeting people.<br />
RAYMOND: When you move out of the Lodge or when you're<br />
rejected, one or the other, will you be taking up residence<br />
in Sydney or Melbourne?<br />
PM: I've got this situation. My daughter Sue and two of my<br />
grandchildren, Sue's, live here in Sydney. My other<br />
daughter Ros, with two of my grandchildren is in Canberra<br />
and may come to Sydney. So all the pull of my family would<br />
be towards Sydney. But even if that brings me to live here,<br />
and I love Sydney, there's no doubt about that, I will still<br />
always retain a very great affection for Melbourne.<br />
Melbourne in many senses, it doesn't have the glamour of<br />
Sydney as you know, but it's a great city. I've had many<br />
happy years of my life there.<br />
RAYMOND: Can you name just one area where you've failed to<br />
live up to your own expectations as Prime Minister? </p>
<p>-6-<br />
PM: That's a good and a tough question. There obviously<br />
must be some. I guess the thing that worries me a little<br />
bit is that I haven't been able to communicate I think as<br />
well to the Australian people the sorts of things which<br />
we've achieved. When I say we've achieved I don't mean we<br />
as Government alone. Because if I look back over six and a<br />
half years where, for instance, I'll just go back to that<br />
employment bit Steve. We've created one and a half million<br />
new jobs. To get an idea of what that means, that rate of<br />
job growth in Australia in our period of Government has been<br />
more than twice as fast as the rest of the industrialised<br />
world. It's five times faster than occurred under the<br />
conservatives when they were in from ' 75 to ' 83. There's<br />
been an enormous increase in benefits to people in the<br />
community who really need it. I guess to some extent I'm<br />
disappointed that I haven't been able as fully to get<br />
through to the Australian people that together, that is<br />
Government and the people together, that this is an enormous<br />
achievement of Australia. I think in a vague sort of way<br />
they know it and they're proud of it. There are two things<br />
about it. It's an enormous achievement and we've done it<br />
together.<br />
RAYMOND: Alright, that achievment aside, the communication<br />
gap. what else? where else have you failed to satisfy your<br />
own expectations?<br />
PM: Well, on the side of the employer organisations, I had<br />
hoped that we might get a better two things a better<br />
form of organisation where the employers of Australia were<br />
able to speak with one sort of voice. I started off when<br />
Prime Minister to talk about that, and they set up the<br />
Business Council of Australia. And I think even employers<br />
themselves would say there hasn't been the sort of response<br />
to organisation that I'd hoped there would be. That's not,<br />
you might say isn't that a pretty small deal? It's not<br />
really beacuse the trade unions of Australia have their<br />
organisations improved enormously. They speak with one<br />
authoritative voice and they are undertaking the process of<br />
reform in a way which employers regard as quite remarkable.<br />
I think it would have been good for Australia if we could<br />
have matched that form of commitment to organisation and<br />
restructuring and modernising and authority in speaking. If<br />
that could have been matched on the employers' side I think<br />
it would have been a good thing. I tried to get that going<br />
but I don't think it has been terribly successful.<br />
RAYMOND: After a gestation period of nearly two years the<br />
opposition will finally unveil its tax policy on Thursday.<br />
Do you already know what's in it?<br />
PM: No. But what I do know is that they are years behind<br />
schedule. Two, I know that there has been a very small<br />
group of people involved in it and that a lot of the people<br />
in the Liberal Party in the Parliament and the National<br />
Party are wondering with trepidation what's going to be in<br />
it. They are probably looking as closely as we are to </p>
<p>-7-<br />
it. It's been you know a very secretive sort of exercise.<br />
Thirdly I would bet you this. You remember when Andrew<br />
Peacock went on his mini campaign. The first day he<br />
trumpeted off the big, what he said was going to be the<br />
knock-out blow. His words. The knock-out blow was the<br />
interest deduction scheme. You remember I went onto the<br />
Sunday Program, that next Sunday, and I said I bet you one<br />
thing that was straight away I said I bet you one thing.<br />
It won't be in their policy I'll bet you now, it won't<br />
be in the policy.<br />
RAYMOND: Will you be gracious enough to commend any<br />
innovative proposals?<br />
PM: I have always, when I was in Opposition and when I was<br />
in the trade union movement, if anyone outside of my own<br />
group had come up with something that's worthwhile I've<br />
always been prepared to recognise it. I mean they've had a<br />
long time though haven't they?<br />
RAYMOND: Yes they've had a very difficult labour period.<br />
PM: It makes an elephant look like someone in a hell of a<br />
hurry doesn't it?<br />
RAYMOND: Who's given you the toughest, the tougher contest?<br />
John or Andrew?<br />
PM: I don't want to sound complacent about this but I've<br />
felt comfortable facing either of them as I felt comfortable<br />
facing Malcolm in 1983. I think that essentially the reason<br />
is this. Not so much a matter of personalities but none of<br />
them, and this includes now the question about John Howard<br />
and Andrew Peacock. The big problem is that they have no<br />
natural constituency with the ordinary people of Australia,<br />
no relationship. So what they are doing is, the people<br />
When I came to office in ' 83 it's a remarkable statistic<br />
but it's very important for 31 of the previous 34 years,<br />
31 of the 34 years before I came to office the conservatives<br />
had been power. They assumed that they had a right to<br />
office. They didn't have any natural constituency. They<br />
thrived on the internal divisions and bitterness and<br />
fighting of the Labor Party for a lot of that period. They<br />
got office by default. They hadn't been in the process of<br />
policy formulation either within their own ranks or through<br />
being in touch with the people of Australia and getting<br />
the feeling. So Howard and Peacock and before them Mr<br />
Fraser had had that problem. So I felt comfortable Steve in<br />
the sense that we are now a united party. We were terribly<br />
disunited before and often we didn't deserve to be in office<br />
because of But now we are united, we've got the<br />
policies, we've got the leaders, we've got the relationship.<br />
I don't think it's just a question of the personality of<br />
John Howard or of Andrew Peacock. It's a much more<br />
fundamental problem they've got. </p>
<p>-8-<br />
RAYMOND: But you certainly couldn't be the same man of the<br />
people that you were six and a half years ago after being<br />
cocooned in The Lodge for that length of time.<br />
PM: Well you come around with me. You come around with me<br />
to the races, you come around with me to shopping centres,<br />
you come with me to pensioners<br />
RAYMOND: thinking of the ' silly old bugger'<br />
PM: OK, sure. OK, that was one incident. You just come<br />
with me Steve when I go around the shopping centres, when I<br />
go around to pensioners meetings. You just come with me.<br />
The relationship that I have when I go around is at least as<br />
warm as it was in 1983.<br />
RAYMOND: OK, two final questions. I thank you for your<br />
generosity with your time.<br />
PM: It's a pleasure.<br />
RAYMOND: Prime Minister, your thoughts on the turmoil in<br />
commercial television at the moment, the mass sackings going<br />
on at Ten and precarious financial positions faced by Bond<br />
Media and Christopher Skase's Quintex Group.<br />
PM: Well as you know we've been a Government which has been<br />
deregulatory. We deregulated in the financial banking<br />
sector. We have in the media to a very large extent. All I<br />
can say is that what's been happening in television is that<br />
the market has been operating, I think it probably would be<br />
said that the market pitched prices far too high and in the<br />
result there have been interest burdens which have become<br />
intolerable. So you're having the market shake-out. I<br />
think that basically in terms of capacities that have been<br />
established since we introduced television in 1956 in this<br />
country, the fundamental capacity of television is very good<br />
in this country. The fundamental capacity is strong, there<br />
is a lot of talent in it. It's just going to be a question<br />
of shake-down and competition and I think there'll probably<br />
be some more casualities on the way.<br />
RAYMOND: How do you feel about it? I don't think you'd<br />
need a crystal ball to say somewhere down the track<br />
someone's going to come to the Government pleading about<br />
Australian content and wanting to lower it because of<br />
financial constraints.<br />
PM: The ABC has recently put up a concept Australian<br />
look and that created some problems of uncertainty. Now<br />
they've amended that sort of concept and there are further<br />
discussions going on between the industry and the ABC.<br />
That's the way for it to be handled. </p>
<p>-9-<br />
RAYMOND: Final question. With his determination to<br />
implement reforms embodied by glasnost and perestroika, do<br />
you regard Mikhail Gorbachev as perhaps the world leader of<br />
our time?<br />
PM: He's certainly up there ranking amongst them. I've had<br />
the opportunity of spending some three hours with Mikhail<br />
Gorbachev in just one on one conversation. He is without<br />
any question a truly remarkable man. He is highly<br />
intelligent, he's got a good sense of humour and he's also<br />
direct. When you have a meeting with him, a discussion,<br />
it's all on the table. You can ask him anything and he'll<br />
respond. There's no deviousness in discussion with him. He<br />
is by any standard Steve one of the truly remarkable figures<br />
of the 20th Century. Within the general communist orbit I<br />
would certainly mention with him Zhao Ziyang, the previous<br />
Prime Minister and Secretary General of the Communist Party<br />
in China. He was a truly, and remains although he's out of<br />
office, a truly remarkable man. I think when you think of<br />
what they have been trying to do, and that is essentially to<br />
rid their countries of the obsolescence of an outdated<br />
irrelevant Marxist-Leninist ideology and try to bring to the<br />
management of their economies more modern realities.<br />
They've taken on a task which is unmatched really by any,<br />
and a challenge unmatched by any world leader of the<br />
Century. They are in a sense the equal to the challenge but<br />
the forces lined up against them. The sheer magnitude of<br />
what they are about may prove too much for Gorbachev. I<br />
certainly hope not. I think that the West is sensible in<br />
having the attitude that we do and that is while having<br />
appropriate caution that we ought to do all that we can to<br />
assist Gorbachev to prevail because in the end economic<br />
reform in the communist countires must, as we see, be<br />
associated with political reform and the gradual emergence<br />
of a freer society and greater liberty for the individual.<br />
And in the end that's what life's about.<br />
RAYMOND: Thank you for your time today.<br />
PM: Thanks Steve.<br />
