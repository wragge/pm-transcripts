ADDRESS TO THE NATION -MEDIBANK<br />
Tonight I want to talk to you about Medibank. In the<br />
last election, the Government said that Medibank would be<br />
maintained and improved. That commitment has been honoured.<br />
There are many areas where this Government, the Australian<br />
Labor Party and the Australian Council of TIrade Unions,<br />
agree about Medibank.<br />
Everyone is included in comprehensive and high quality medical<br />
and health care. All Australians are covered automatically.<br />
Those on lowest incomes will make no payment they are fully<br />
protected. Bulk billing for medical costs remains. High quality<br />
standard ward treatment will be provided. Nedibank offers<br />
and will continue to offer the lowest cost quality health care<br />
for all Australians.<br />
On these matters there is no difference in what we<br />
propose and what Labor-* enacted. Medibank however was capable<br />
of improvement and this is our objective.<br />
Medibank as we all recognise is an expensive new benefit.<br />
The Government, the Australian Labor Party and the Australian<br />
Council of Trade Unions all recognise that it must be paid<br />
for by a tax or levy. This Government and the Labor Party<br />
believe that there should be a limit on that levy. The<br />
A. C. T. U. does not and that is a major difference.<br />
They do not accept a limit on the amount a family would have<br />
to pay.<br />
They would provide no further help for the lowest income families.<br />
They would damage a large number of families where both partnersare<br />
working, because they want each partner to pay. With<br />
no upper limit many people would pay more than their fair<br />
share of Medibank costs. Many of the Australian Council of<br />
Trade Union's own members would pay more under their proposal<br />
than Linder ours. / 2 </p>
<p>This in particular applies to the chronically ill, who<br />
would want to take out intermediate or private ward insurance.<br />
The chronically ill are those who spend many weeks each<br />
year in hospital. Many of them want some extra privacy or<br />
comfort. Many of them are low income familes.<br />
. Under our proposals there will be a $ 50 million a year subsidy<br />
fo r the chronically ill. A subsidy of this kind was embodied<br />
in the original Labor Party proposals.<br />
The A. C. T. U. has demanded the abolition of this subsidy.<br />
Together with other proposals of the A. C. T. U. this will have<br />
the effect of raising the cost of intermediate hospital<br />
ward cover.<br />
The result of this would be that 85% of f amilies who wanted<br />
to insure for Intermediate ward treatment-would be worse off.<br />
I just cannot understand how the A. C. T. U. came to support that<br />
proposal It would create grave injustices for many people<br />
who because of chronic or long standing illnesses deserve some<br />
additional support.<br />
Our proposals are fair and just. Those who can afford to<br />
pay more will do so. In addition, because of the<br />
progressive tax scale, the better off made a further significant<br />
and increasing contribution to health care.<br />
Further more, our proposals provide choice. Intermediate<br />
insurance will be available to most people. That means<br />
you can have the doctor you want in hospital.<br />
I have pointed to the very considerable degree of agreement<br />
between ourselves and the Labor Party which has remained silent.<br />
I have pointed out the considerable degree of agreement between<br />
ourselves and the A. C. T. U.<br />
I have also pointed to the areas of disagreement which would seem<br />
to us to be important. -They are basically that the A. C. T. U.<br />
has made it plain that they would not accept an upper hint<br />
on the levy. This will hit many two income families and many would<br />
be paying more than the cost of the service provided.<br />
The A. C. T. U. would not accept a subsidy for the chronically ill.<br />
They would not allow people to insure fully with private funds<br />
We believe these~ three elements are -important. They will be<br />
maintained. Our record showsthat we are responsive to reasonable arguments,,<br />
reasonably put. I have welcomed the contributions of the<br />
A. C. T. U.. on the future of the Prices Justification Tribunal<br />
and on our industrial legislation. As a result the secret<br />
postal ballot provisions will be better and more effective.<br />
We have had extensive discussions with the Trade Unions on Medibank.<br />
13 </p>
<p>We have in fact made on major and significant changeto<br />
allow Medibank to compete Withi the private health<br />
funds for intermediate and private wards. This will<br />
enable people tQ get full covek~ age from Medibank<br />
which wasn't possible before.<br />
I know people are asking what the precise rates for<br />
intermediate and private ward treatment, what the upper-limit<br />
on the levy, will be. The States had to make decisions<br />
on charges. These have been made.<br />
Medibank insurance and the funds will shortly announce rates.<br />
This will remove one area of doubt I know has conce'rned<br />
many people.<br />
I am asking you tonight to think carefully what this strike<br />
is really about. Ask yourselves why people have been told<br />
to go on strike against a scheme which is an improvement on the<br />
original Medibank arrangements. Ask yourselves why you have not<br />
been given a say in whether or not you want to go on strike.<br />
Is the strike really about Medibank? I have made it-plain that<br />
the Government-is committed to support and to improve Modibaik,<br />
to protect especially the lower income people in Australia.<br />
The call for a national strike tomorrow should never have been made.<br />
This is not a time for ultimatums. It is a time for getting<br />
on with the real business of restoring prosperity to Australia,<br />
of showing what we as a people are made of, of showing that we can<br />
work together to make Australia the great country we know it can be.<br />
All this strike can do is to postpone the return to confidence<br />
and prosperity and jobs which we all want. This strike<br />
cannot change anything. It can only harm the people involved in it.<br />
And the people most hurt will be the lowest income people.<br />
Those who called the strike did not think of them.<br />
