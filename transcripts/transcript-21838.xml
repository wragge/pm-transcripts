    <content><![CDATA[<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister does your review of the anti-terrorist legislation... is there likely to be a stronger case now for an ID card do you think as a result of what you've heard from the Brits?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Not necessarily. It remains one of the things that we will look at, but it does not necessarily follow from the events in Britain of the last few weeks that an ID card would have made any difference, but it should not be assumed that in the future terrorists acts might in some way be influence, might in some way be influenced, by better systems of identification. It remains the case that an ID card is one of a number of things that will be looked at by the Government.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>How are you now going to work out whether it might be useful to add to the armoury or not?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Advice.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Philip Ruddock says Australia's anti-terrorism laws are already stronger than those here in Britain, so what other things are you contemplating? And why the need for the review?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well you always continually review the operation of laws.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>The Metropolitan Police here asked the Prime Minister for power to detain people for three months without charge, is that one of the things you're looking at?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Mark, I'm not going to respond seriatim to each and every proposal. I have said that we are looking at whether there's a need to strengthen our anti-terrorist laws....no, no may I, please, please, please let us be civil, whether we need to strengthen them, and I'm not going to start ruling individual things in or out at this stage - that defeats the whole process.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, can I ask on another matter about your reaction to the Chinese decision to revalue the yuan?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I welcome the fact there has been some movement. The impact of the level of the Chinese currency on the United States is different from what it is on the Australian economy. That does not mean that we don't share the American view there should be more flexibility. My view is that all exchange rates should be set as far as possible in accordance with market forces, but the American economic interest is different from the Australian economic interest because America's trade relationship with China is different.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>You do think there's a requirement ultimately for them to go to a more market...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think all countries should have as much market sensitivity in their exchange rate structures as possible, and after all if we impose that discipline on ourselves we could barely heard to say that it shouldn't apply to others.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard have you taken the decision to sign the treaty of Amity and Cooperation with the East Asian forum.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>If we were to sign that treaty it would be on certain conditions and one of those conditions would firmly be that it would be without prejudice to other treaty arrangements and understandings and without prejudice to Australia's rights under the UN Charter.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Have you made this clear to the ASEAN nations...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>And what has been their response?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I think if there were to be any announcement of the response of another country or group of countries the courteous, polite thing would be to allow those countries, or country to make that announcement.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Are you any closer to signing it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't think I have anything to add to what I've just said.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard can I ask that in this meeting with some of your contemporaries in the Conservative Party, did they seek or did you offer advice....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Contemporaries? Well some are, and some would be rather offended at that. Particularly one or two of them. Yes?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Was there any advice to them, Mr Howard or any of the others?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well look we obviously had what my friends in the Labor Party would say are fraternal discussions and I've maintained links with the Conservative Party in Britain, as you would expect, as Mr Blair has maintained links with the Labor Party in Australia - and we talked about political tactics. I think it's understood that when you've been around for a while you might have some ideas to offer and it's something you do without in anyway imposing upon the courtesies extended by an incumbent government. We talked about British and Australian politics and I had a few thoughts about our long years in Opposition, I reminded them nothing is permanent in politics and just as the next election in Australia can easily be lost by the Coalition, it's not impossible the Conservatives could win the next election in Britain.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Should we expect a Howard retirement before the next election?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Now that's one of those very tricky questions Mr Shanahan, oh Mr Shanahan.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>On your meeting with John Reid this morning, did he and you discuss Britain's plans for Iraq and...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Broadly, yes.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p> ...and can you expand on that? And did he ask for extra Australian assistance in Iraq.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>He did not ask for extra Australian assistance, it's accepted by the British Government that the contribution we have made is the appropriate one and we don't have any current plans to increase it. But he talked about British plans, it's for him to publicly announce any British plans - I think it's fair to say that Britain entirely shares our view that both our force contributions should stay there until their respective jobs have been completed and it's in the interest of all the Coalition partners in Iraq to bring on as fast as possible and as much as possible the capacity of the Iraqi security forces. I think we might conclude on that note.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>You had an audience with the Queen, what can you tell us about that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, nothing.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Without breaching protocol.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Without breaching protocol I'll follow the pattern set by predecessors of not commenting on discussions I had with the Queen.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>How is she?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>She's very well. Very, very well.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Did you convey Australia's sympathies....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well look I don't intend to get into what we discussed.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Are you going to Germany to see the cyclists?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look it's simply for a number of logistical reasons not possible.  Bye Bye.</p>
<p>[ends]</p>
