<p>Tonight I want to talk with you on the relative merits of our Health Scheme<br />
and the scheme with which you are threatened by Mr. Whitlam.<br />
For with a Certain sullen obstinacy, Mr. Whitlam is still threatening to<br />
introduce his scheme if he can. Thbis could hurt every hIousehold in Ausotralia and<br />
the facts about it should be known.<br />
Further, an examination of the statements made to justify his scheme provides<br />
a test of his credibility.<br />
Now his first intention is to take away from you your freedom to choose which<br />
fund you want to join. All the existing friendly societies and other closed fujids, as<br />
well as all the open funds, would be abolished under his scheme You wiould be<br />
compelled to deal with the single, monopolistic fund which would be the 2py fund he<br />
would allow to operate.<br />
He justifies this by an incorrect statement. That statement is that " the<br />
existii. g funds squander or retain $ 1 out of every $ 4 they receive in contribut ions."<br />
Now the independent Nimmo Committee found no support at all for the claim<br />
that a number of different funds adds to the cost of the Health Scheme. Indeed, it<br />
recommended that the friendly societies and closed funds should be encouraged. to<br />
continue. And it published tables showing the cost of management of closed funds<br />
to be, on the average, 6 cents in the dollar, not 25 cents in the dollar as-Whitlam<br />
claims. And it showed tables showing the cost of management of open funds to be<br />
on the average 12 * cents in the dollar not 25 cents in the dollar as Whitlam claims.<br />
So Mr. Whitlam-s statement Is quite untrLra and you lose your freedom Of<br />
choice for nothing.<br />
His second intention is to make most of us pay more in contributions than we<br />
now pay. At present tax deductible contributions . paid by an unmarried person,<br />
insuring for medical benefits and public hospital ward treatment vary from State to<br />
State. But in every case, in every State, Mr. Wh-itlam's threatened levy of 1-1 per cent<br />
of an unmarried person's taxable income would cost that person more in every<br />
case in every State.<br />
At present the contributions paid by a married man also vary as between<br />
States. But in this case the Labor Scheme would cost him less until his income<br />
reached about 000. But this would only be true if his wife were not earning or in<br />
receipt of income. For if she were she would also have to contribute 1' per cent<br />
of her taxable income and the combined contributions would most likely cost the famili.<br />
more., e 9 / 2 </p>
<p>To sum up. Mr. Whitlam's Scheme<br />
Would cost every unmarried person in Australia earning $ 50 a week and over<br />
more It would cost every married man in Queensland more<br />
It would cost all married men in other States more if their income exceeded<br />
about 000.<br />
Ik would cost many married men in other States with incomes less than<br />
000 more if their wives were &amp;. so receiving income.<br />
This is described by Mr. Whitlam as a scheme which costs the citizens of Australia<br />
less. The third intention is to alter the benefits now payable. For small payments<br />
for V" 3itS to a general practitioner the Labor Scheme would give the contributor a<br />
few cents more. But for minor operations it would reduce the benefits now payable<br />
to a patient and for major operations it would reduce them very greatly.<br />
Mr. Whitlam calls this increasing benefits.<br />
Well, think of this and think of the credibility of the statements that have<br />
been made to justify a scheme which in practice would cost you more and in<br />
most cases provide you with less. </p>
