    <content><![CDATA[<p>Itâs a real thrill to be here. Itâs great to welcome the Australia team and the England team, particularly their skippers, Chris Rogers and Eoin Morgan. It really is good to be here.</p>
<p>Iâm very conscious of the fact that this is an important match and last year it was a particularly important match for England, because it was the only game England won on their Australian tour!</p>
<p>I quoted Churchill at this event prior to last yearâs game and it obviously lifted England, so Iâm not going to do any Churchillian oratory tonight! Iâm just going to say that Iâm really pleased that Chris Rogers has accepted the job of captaining the Australian Prime Ministerâs XI in place of the injured Mike Hussey. Youâve had a terrific season, Chris, against India; six 50-pluses in your last three matches and I hope itâs another great game for you tomorrow. I also understand that you are a distant cousin of Australiaâs only chess grandmaster, Ian Rogers, so we expect to see some tactical brilliance out there tomorrow.</p>
<p>This is a fine tradition; a tradition that dates back to 1951 when Sir Robert Menzies was our Prime Minister. The first game was with the West Indies, as I understand it, and since then weâve had many games â many Prime Ministerâs XIs â against England.</p>
<p>In the 1963 match, Sir Donald Bradman made his last appearance at the wicket. Unfortunately, he was bowled for just four runs by a freakish ball from Englandâs Brian Statham. There was a break in this event between 1965 and 1984, but since then, it has been a regular part of an Australian cricketing summer. Itâs also been a very significant part of cricketing here in the ACT.</p>
<p>Itâs four-all between Australia and England when it comes to these Prime Ministerâs XIs, so letâs hope that tomorrowâs tie breaker goes the right way.</p>
<p>Itâs good to see so many up and coming young players as part of the teams. Weâve also got Canberraâs own Matt Condon and Mac Wright, Lega Siaka from PNG symbolising the progress that cricket is making in our northern neighbour, and itâs great to have here with us Pat Cummins and Glenn Maxwell whoâve just joined the World Cup squad.</p>
<p>Congratulations to all of the players. May everyone have a great game tomorrow.</p>
<p>This is going to be a big year for cricket with the World Cup here and in New Zealand next month, but thereâs something special about an Australia-England game. For Australians, England is the old enemy when it comes to cricket. Letâs hope those who are the best of friends off the field can be the fiercest of competitors on the field and that Australia will be the winner tomorrow, and cricket.</p>
