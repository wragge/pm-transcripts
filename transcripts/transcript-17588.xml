NEGUS: Prime Minister, thanks for your time. Firstly I -</p>
<p>PM: Good evening George.</p>
<p>NEGUS: I noticed that your colleague Anna Bligh actually described this as a grim disaster, an unfolding human tragedy. When you heard about the immensity of it, the shock and horror of what's been happening here in Queensland, what was your own personal reaction?</p>
<p>PM: Well, it's heartbreaking George. You watch those images, they are so so shocking with cars being tossed around, with houses literally washed away and to digest the grim news that we have lost nine Australian lives, including children and that there are many Australian families waiting to hear now anxiously what has happened with their loved ones. This is all really heartbreaking stuff, but I suppose we also are seeing on display courage and determination from Queenslanders as they deal with this crisis and we're going to be with them shoulder to shoulder through the days ahead and then the months and months of recovery afterwards.</p>
<p>NEGUS: Good point PM, because it will take months, I mean it's a double edged sword, isn't it really, because you need immediate assistance for people who are now surprisingly find themselves flood victims, they need immediate help. Of course the longer problems, the recovery, economically and in human terms can take an immense time and an immense amount of money, are we up to it?</p>
<p>PM: Yes, we're up to it George, we're up to it as a nation and I know Australians will want to support Queenslanders in their time of need. We're already there, with emergency payments, more than $13 million has been paid in emergency payments, more than 10,000 claims. We've got over 1000 Centrelink staff focussed on working with flood victims who need that kind of assistance, but it's just the start, just the start of months and months of recovery as we stand with Queenslanders.</p>
<p>George we can't know yet how much damage there will be to recover from, because the crisis is still unfolding.</p>
<p>NEGUS: Indeed.</p>
<p>PM: And we can't know what damage has been done until flood waters subside, but my focus now is on the Defence Force efforts to work alongside Queenslanders, as well as the making of emergency payments to get money into people's pocket.</p>
<p>NEGUS: And you're coming to Brisbane I hear PM, because that's the latest place to be hit by this water?</p>
<p>PM: Yes, I will be travelling to Brisbane tonight, I'll be there tomorrow to meet with Premier Bligh and be available for our Defence effort, to be talking to our Defence personnel. They are doing a remarkable job and certainly we will use whatever Defence assets we need to support the people of Queensland and to help them through.</p>
<p>NEGUS: Prime Minister we'll have to leave it there, but thanks for your time.</p>
<p>PM: Thanks George.</p>
