ACTING _ MWEMOBTE<br />
FOR MEDIA3 JUNE 1983<br />
The Acting Prime Minister, Mr Bowen, today sent the following<br />
telex to the Premier of Tasmania, Mr Gray.<br />
My dear Premier<br />
I have been advised that Tasmania wishes to postpone the meeting<br />
scheduled for next Tuesday and planned to consider alternative<br />
employment for workers currently employed on the Gordon below<br />
Franklin project.<br />
I strongly urge that discussions proceed as plan. ned. Should work<br />
on the dam stop, it will be in the interest of both our<br />
Governments that alternative projects are taken up as soon as<br />
possible. Clearly this is a matter of great importance to the<br />
workers and contractors involved.<br />
I reiterate that, as stated by the Prime Minister in his letter<br />
to you of 17 May, the meeting would be on the basis that it would be<br />
without prejudice to Tasmania's position on the issue.<br />
Yours sincerely<br />
Lionel Bowcon<br />
Acting Prime Minister<br />
INFOR14ATIVELY THE MINISTER FOR RESOURCES AND ENERGY, SENATOR<br />
PETER WALSH, HAD BEEN APPOINTED BY THE PRIME MINISTER,<br />
MR HAWKE, TO LEAD THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S REPRESENTATION AT<br />
THE TALKS WHICH WERE TO HAVE BEEN HELD I N HOBART.<br />
