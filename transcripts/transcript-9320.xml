PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING, MP<br />
Tomorrow's Council of Australian Governments meeting in Darwin will<br />
concentrate on the roles and reponsibilities between tiers of government, and on<br />
competition-policy. The Premiers, Chief Ministers and I will discuss important<br />
reforms in electricity, gas, workers' compensation and the legal profession. We<br />
will consider reports on maritime reform, the National Strategy on Violence<br />
Against Women, regulatory reform and the Review of Commonwealth and State<br />
Service Provision.<br />
It will be will be an opportunity to reach agreement on matters of profound<br />
importance to the future of this country.<br />
Broad agreement on government roles and responsibilities will create more<br />
integrated health and community services, with better results for clients and<br />
greater value for money for taxpayers.<br />
Implementation of a national competition policy the principles of which we<br />
agreed to at our last meeting in Hobart will have many enduring benefits for the<br />
Australian economy and the Australian people.<br />
Agreement tomorrow will mean more economic growth, and more jobs. It will<br />
mean cost savings for exporters and better services for everybody. It will mean<br />
not just a more competitive and stronger Australia, but a fairer Australia.<br />
Implementation of a national competition policy will also mean that the States<br />
and their utilities have joined Australian business and the people they employ<br />
working Australians and their families in opening themselves to competitive<br />
pressures in pursuit of productivity, efficiency and comparative advantage. It will<br />
mean that the States have joined the rest of Australia in adjusting to the<br />
necessities of our era. 74/ 94 </p>
<p>The Commonwealth Government is determined to press on with implementation<br />
of a national competition policy it is nothing less than our duty to Australia and<br />
Australians. It is our duty to this and future generations. The States, surely,<br />
have a similar duty.<br />
State Premiers and Chief Ministers come to this conference knowing I seek their<br />
cooperation, knowing that in pursuit of the great gains which stand to be made<br />
both sides may need to surrender ground. It is not a question of State rights. It<br />
is a question of making the Federation work as it was intended to work in the<br />
interests of a stronger Australia and, above all, in the interests of the Australian<br />
people. Tomorrow we have an historic opportunity to help Australia work as one for the<br />
benefit of all.<br />
