<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>[Tape begins]...I hope and pray that they receive a fair and proper</p>
<p> trial. I'm disturbed that there will be no Australian representative</p>
<p> present. I'm constrained for obvious reasons about saying anymore</p>
<p> except to say to their families, who must be going through a very</p>
<p> difficult time, that the thoughts and understanding and concern of</p>
<p> millions of Australians are with them. It's very stressful. We</p>
<p> can't even begin to understand the strain that they're under.</p>
<p> And we all hope that they're treated fairly and decently and</p>
<p> if they are they should be allowed to come home to Australia because</p>
<p> they were humanitarian workers. They were trying to help and relieve</p>
<p> suffering on both sides of the debate and the argument and the war</p>
<p> in Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Are you hopeful that the trial will go fairly?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I hope it goes fairly. I don't, for reasons I ask you to understand,</p>
<p> want to say any more than that.</p>
