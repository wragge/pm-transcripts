ELECTORATE TALK<br />
The Goverrnent's second Budget delivered by the Treasurer last<br />
week is a Budget of real reform. It continues with the great<br />
reforms we commenced last year. It recognises that people want<br />
to be able to make decisions that affect their own lives, and<br />
that they want freedom to choose.<br />
At the same time, the Budget gives reality to our complete<br />
commitment to help those mnost in need. Our tax reforms offer<br />
renewed hope for millions of Australian men and women burdened<br />
by the yoke of crippling taxation on their incomes.<br />
Make no mistake, my Government's tax reforms are the greates-t<br />
single reform of our tax system ever introduced by any Government<br />
in this country. This reform with its new system of tax<br />
calculation, rewards initiative, provides incentive and taxes<br />
fairly. This is precisely what a tax is supposed to do.<br />
My Government has always maintained that the present personal tax<br />
system hits too hard at the pay packets of all Australians.<br />
We have been one of the highest taxed nations in the world.<br />
We have admitted this fact but we have also done something<br />
about it.<br />
Last year we introduced tax indexation, which stopped governments<br />
taking an even larger share of incomes simply because of infiation.<br />
We stopped this unlegislated tax grab by Canberra. That was the<br />
first step. Now we have introduced a three-tiered standard rate<br />
of taxation, that will start from February 1.<br />
This system is one of the most a'i1vanced. in the world. Principally,<br />
it means that nearly 90 percent of taxpayers will pay only 32 cents<br />
standard rate of tax. For a person on average earnings of about<br />
$ 10,000 there is a built-in incentive to earn another $ 6,000<br />
either in salary or overtime without being forced into a higher<br />
tax bracket. Three typical weekly salary rates demonstrate the<br />
savings from tax indexation and our new reform.<br />
The taxpayer with dependent spouse, earning $ 140 a week, will save<br />
$ 4.87 a week. The same taxpayer earning $ 200 a week will save<br />
$ 6.67 a week, while the taxpayer earning $ 280 a week will save<br />
$ 15.33 a week. </p>
<p>Despite the tactics of the Labor Party to deliberately confuse<br />
the community on the extent of this reform, the plain fact remains<br />
every Australian taxpayer will be better of.<br />
The actual cost to myGovernment in lost revenue of our tax reforms<br />
in this financial year will be more than $ 1300 million. That is<br />
made up of full tax indexation, costing $ 965 million, and the new<br />
reform from February 1, costing another $ 406 million.<br />
This is not a sleight-of-hand or a fiddle, as Labor claims<br />
it is the real benefit to taxpayers. The cost of our tax reforms<br />
in the following financial year ( 1978-79) will be $ 1800 million.<br />
This is made up of $ 467 million which is the cost of half indexation,<br />
and $ 1390 million which is the cost of the tax reform fo. that<br />
financial year.<br />
That is nearly a $ 1000 million additional benefit to<br />
taxpayers over and above that which they would get from full<br />
indexation of the old rates.<br />
Clearly, Labor are not too delighted about my Government being<br />
able to introduce remarkable tax reform within just two years of<br />
being elected. That's exactly why they now seek to muddy the water.<br />
They will fail, because from February 1 next year, every Australial.<br />
will receive the benefit of the new tax system, as well as tax<br />
indexation. Nothing Labor says will alter that.<br />
We were only able to undertake tax reforms because we have<br />
kept Government expenditure restrained and under tight co-' trol<br />
for two successive years. We have shown Australians that<br />
governments have to make real choices between expenditure on their<br />
own accounts, and providing tax relief for individuals.<br />
The Government's great tax reforms have maintained our commitment<br />
to help people in need. Benefits to individuals have been fully<br />
nrotected. Not a single cent has been cut from any benefit<br />
paid to any individual under our social welfare programmes.<br />
Indeed, many payments have been substantially increased.<br />
The Budget is a budget of genuine reform. The Government h-is<br />
introduced historic tax reform, maintained our commitment ;: o<br />
those in need, and at the same time has framed a Budget will<br />
cont: inue the relentless task of bearing down on inflatior. </p>
