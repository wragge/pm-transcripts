The Prinme NIiister said it was important that<br />China be drawn, into the comity of nations, but we should a. ot<br />forget that China was still willing to assiot revolutionary<br />movements in the Aaian region, including those on the Thai border.<br />Asked uhy so few of its major allieo had<br />supported the United State position1 on China, the Prime 1Å 4inistor<br />said that the European countries, for example, were fuirthor away<br />from the north Asian region. They tendered to be se1Af-coi2tred<br />and remote from the problem. B~ elgium had probably not roupported<br />us after saying it would because it was not consitlted about the<br />timing of the second Kissinger viIcit to Poking.</p>
<p>2-<br />Tho PrÃ± i M~ nloter &amp;~ dtho ncxt few years<br />would be a crucial pr : od in which it i-would be necess= y to<br />find a new balance botween theo great pawars -the Un-Itod<br />3taton, the Soviet Union, Clhinao Japtx and an intograted<br />Europe to ensure an onduiring peace.<br />IUiIT.* D ~ TT3AFTSR-VIRT NAP! O<br />There wasi somel discussion as to whether' or not<br />the United States was turning ieolationist of tho role<br />which the Unite~ d tatea smiglht usefully 9ack~ to p. hay in Azia<br />in the futre. The Priae niotar said it was unlikelir that<br />the United fota" Gea vould got involved again 1. u a land rar ia<br />0Ania. Its rolc ahculd be to enoure st' ic~. it finan<br />asoictence and aid to mtaintain the viability of the coiuitrica<br />in thie region, In Viet Nam and Cam~ bodia, in particula-r, the<br />United States should assiat in providinS adequate training of<br />local forces ac wollas necesedry air and naval support.<br />JAPAN. Tarning to Japani, theo Primie Minister said that-ho<br />wanted to emphasine the crucial inportanco of Japan. A91riu<br />policios had already dairiaged the Sato leader2hip. There was<br />nobody who could replace him. Otherwise, he would probably<br />have fallen by n~ ow. This waa partly due to United Slitatec failure<br />to handle its approach to Japan on major iseues adequately.</p>

In response -to &amp; rnother question, the Pritne k-iistar<br />vaid that it iw true that the United ' States was g~ oing through<br />-somiething of a dowestio trauma. However, he haxd no doubt that<br />the problome giving rise to this would be overoome and the<br />United btates would continue to play a vcry importwant and active<br />rolo in world affairs.<br />~ i'IG~~ TIN. Asked by the E~ ditor about our "' exclutsive" immigration<br />policy, the Prime ninister said that this was a misleading phrase.<br />Our im. igration policy was restrictive, but it was not exclusive.<br />hlon-Buropeans# including black Americana, could enter Australia for</p>
