FOR MEDIA<br />
NATIONAL CONSULTATION AND ASSISTANCE PROGRAM FOR WOMEN<br />
I am happy to announce today a National Consultation and<br />
Assistance Program for women totalling $ 472,000.<br />
The first part of the Program will provide an annual<br />
increase of $ 122,000 in funds for grants to national women's<br />
organisations. These grants will be administered by the<br />
office of the Status of Women in my Department.<br />
The second part of the Program is designed to assist member<br />
organisations of the National Women's Consultative Council.<br />
These comprise a wide range of national women's<br />
organisations and other organisations committed to improving<br />
the status of women. The Government consults the Council<br />
about major issues which affect women.<br />
The Government has approved a special one-off payment of<br />
$ 10,000 for each of the non-government organisations on the<br />
Council. The total allocation will be $ 150,000 over two<br />
years. This will provide Council members with the resources<br />
necessary to seek out the views of their members on issues<br />
identified by the Government and to generally consult their<br />
members on issues of importance to women.<br />
The organisations to benefit from these payments are:<br />
Association of Civilian Widows<br />
Australian C6uncil of Churches<br />
Australian Council of Trade Unions<br />
Australian Federation of Business-and Professional<br />
Women<br />
Australian Federation of University Women<br />
Australian Union of Students<br />
Country Women's Association of Australia<br />
Disabled Peoples International<br />
Federation of Aboriginal Women<br />
Federation of Ethnic Communities' Councils of Australia<br />
National Aboriginal Conference<br />
National Council of Women of Australia<br />
Union of Australian Women<br />
Women's Electoral Lobby </p>
<p>In addition, the Council Convenor, Mrs Edith Hall, will<br />
receive an allocation to assist her with the expenses<br />
associated with running the Council.<br />
The third part of the Program is an annual allocation<br />
totalling $ 200,000 for grants to approved organisations for<br />
projects to assist women.<br />
Organisations will need to submit projects for approval and<br />
in most cases the grant will be limited to $ 15,000.<br />
Eligible organisations could include trade unions, churches,<br />
ethnic or Aboriginal groups as well as the traditional<br />
women's organisations.<br />
The whole Program is designed to increase the input of women<br />
into decisions made for and about them.<br />
My Government is committed to providing women with<br />
opportunities to participate fully in all aspects of<br />
Australian social and economic life. I am particularly<br />
aware of the widespread interest expressed by women's<br />
organisations in taxation matters. I have informed the<br />
Council that at least one of its members will attend the<br />
Taxation Summit specifically to represent women's interests. </p>
