PRIME MINISTER INTERVIEIWED ON SOUTH AUSTRALIA ELECTION RESULT<br />
MT. GAMBIER<br />
Question It is a wonderful reaction ( inaudible)<br />
the Liberal Party as a whole. I would like to congratulate<br />
the South Australian Liberals for a tremendous victory.<br />
It has been a hard-fought campaign. The main issue has come<br />
through and the question I think is " what is the future for<br />
South Australia". Over the last few weeks people have come<br />
to understand that Labor policies have held the State back;<br />
less investment less development, less jobs, than would<br />
have been the case under other policies. It's been held<br />
back compared to other parts of Australia.<br />
I think South Australians have shown that they just don't<br />
want those negative policies anymore.<br />
Question The State Government did try to argue, or to campaign on<br />
Federal issues.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I think that is one of the Labor Party's gross miscalculations.<br />
They would the Federal Budget was going to be an unpopular one.<br />
Well it has been well received as a Budget that is appropriate<br />
and fair and reasonable. It was a-major part of the Corcoran-Hayden<br />
campaign, that a -vote for Labor in South Australia was a<br />
vote against Fraser and the Federal Government. I always<br />
maintained, and. I still maintain, that State elections are<br />
basically fought on State issues and I do that whichever way<br />
the result comes out. But to the extent that people in South<br />
Australia might have been affected by that Labor Party campaign,<br />
it was quite obviously a repudiation of that general Labor<br />
Party approach. To the extent that the Labor Party did involve<br />
Federal policies in this campaign, the result is-in effect<br />
effect an endorsement of Federal policy.<br />
Question Were you surprised by the size of the swing to the Liberals<br />
away from the Government.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I don't think really surprised. If you had asked me six weeks<br />
ago I would have thought it was a difficult result to achieve,<br />
but over the last three or four weeks many things have changed.<br />
I think that South Australians had come to focus on the issues<br />
in a very real way, as people often do in the run-up to an<br />
election. It is quite different from an ordinary poll when<br />
people aren't focussing on an election and what the real<br />
consequences are. In this campai gn, their attention was very<br />
sharply drawn to the fact that existing policies in South Australia<br />

PRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT </p>
<p>-2-<br />
Prime Minister ( continued)<br />
were holding that State back compared to other parts of the<br />
Commonwealth. You not only had the Liberal Party saying that,<br />
all the major employer groups in South Australia had made up<br />
their minds that if there was going to be any future for their<br />
own industries, and trading commerce, and if they were going<br />
to have any capacity to provide more employment, something<br />
had to be done. So they came out and started telling the<br />
( inaudible).<br />
Question What influence did the ACTU's vote on uranium have onthe<br />
election. Prime Minister<br />
You know Mr. Hawke's words an exercise in futility in terms<br />
of the decision. But it certainly served to emphasise the<br />
general Labor Party approach which is anti -development. Roxby Dow ns<br />
it can be one of the greatest mines in the world being held<br />
back because of the Labor Party decision to leave uranium in<br />
the ground. Now that sort of thing was emphasised by the<br />
ACTU debate and to an extent therefore it would have helped the<br />
L~ iberal Party.<br />
Question I think it is the first time that Australian people have voted<br />
on any issue connected with uranium. Do you feel that this is<br />
a reflection of the general electorate feeling towards mining?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I suppose in the last Federal Election uranium mining was in part<br />
an issue. It wasn't all that much to the fore. But overwhelmingly<br />
I think that people are sensible about energy policies. They know<br />
uranium is an important energy source, especially for many<br />
countries overseas that don't have supplies of coal, don't have<br />
supplies of oil.-Many countries are becoming increasingly<br />
dependent upon uranium for peaceful purposes. I-think Australians,<br />
South Australians, recognise that we've got a role to play.<br />
We've got a commodity for export. It can provide jobs for<br />
Australians. It is undertaken under the strictest safeguards and<br />
they want us all to get on with the job, I've got no doubt.<br />
Question Have you spoken to Mr. Tonkin, and if so were you discussing<br />
general areas of Commonwealth-State co-operation.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I spoke to him before the counting started yesterday and I spoke<br />
to him this morning just to congratulate him on the result.<br />
I will be in South Australia tomorrow for a Pacific Cities<br />
Conference, and we are going to try to meet after that for<br />
a short while. 000---</p>
