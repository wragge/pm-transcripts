    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Australian Government is committed to a renaissance in the teaching of Australian history in our schools.  Marking today's Australian History Summit, I am pleased to announce the establishment of a Prime Minister's Prize for Australian History.</p>
<p>This prize will be the nation's pre-eminent award for excellence in Australian history.  It is intended to raise the profile of Australian history and be a conspicuous reward for the long and often painstaking process of good historical research.</p>
<p>The prize will be awarded annually and be worth $100,000 in recognition of an outstanding publication or body of work that contributes significantly to an understanding of Australian history.  Eligible nominations can include a published book, a documentary film, a documentary for radio or television, CD-ROM, DVD or other form of multimedia.  The nomination could include a series of these works.</p>
<p>I will invite a panel of eminent historians to assess nominations.</p>
<p>  Nominations will be sought for any work first published, produced or performed in the last two years.</p>
<p>  The first award will be made later this year, following a public call for nominations.  Further details and guidelines for the 2006 Prime Minister's Prize for Australian History will be announced shortly by the Department of Education, Science and Training.  </p>
