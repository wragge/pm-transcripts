PRIME MINISTER 125/ 93<br />
DEATH OF JUSTIN O'BYRNE<br />
It was with considerable sadness I learned today of the death of Justin OByrne, the<br />
former President of the Senate.<br />
Justin O'Byrne was a remarkable Australian. A fighter pilot and a prisoner of war in<br />
World War 11, he continued his service to the nation as Senator for Tasmania for the<br />
extraordinary period of 34 years, until 1981.<br />
He had a typically Australian streak of larrikin in him, which threw into relief and made<br />
more effective his great commitment to social justice. Even before that phrase had<br />
been coined, Justin OByrne understood and gave voice to the principles which the<br />
term sums up.<br />
His service as a Senator was capped by his election to the position of President, in<br />
which he served with vigour and distinction during the Whitlam Government, a<br />
challenging and tumultuous period for one in his position.<br />
Justin O'Byrne's contributions to debate inside and outside the Senate were always<br />
lively, but he managed to attract friends wherever he went. We will all miss him now.<br />
SYDNEY, November, 1993 </p>
