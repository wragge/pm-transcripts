<p>AS A RESULT OP THE RAPID GROWTH OF THE COKIPUTER INDUSTRY, MANY<br />
SECTORS OF THE ECONOM7 ARE ACHIEVI!&amp; INCREASED EFFICIENCY AND<br />
GREATER COMPETITIVENESS,<br />
fIOST OF THE COMPUTER EOUIPNENT SOLD IN AUSTRALIA IS MANUFACTURED<br />
OVERSEAS, THiI S 1G NOT SURPRISING G IVEN THE SIZE OF TFHE I NVESTMENT<br />
I N COMPUTER INDUSTRY iN THE UN ITED STATES, JAPAN AND EUROPE,<br />
THE SMALLER SIZE OF THE AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY MEANS THAT WE WILL<br />
ALWAYS HAV'E TO IMPORT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR NEW TECHNOLOGY<br />
AND MUCH OF THE HIGH TECHNOLOGY EQUIPMENT THAT WE USE, IN<br />
CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE AUSTRALIAN BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY ARE<br />
BECOMING EVER MORE DEPENDENT ON COMPUTERS FOR THE EFFICIENT<br />
CONDUCT OF ALL TYPES OF ACTIVITIESi WE MUST ENSURE THAT'<br />
COMPUTER USERS CONTINUE TO HAVE READY ACCESS TO THE BEST AND-,<br />
LATEST EQUIPMENT AT REASONABLE PRICES,<br />
THERE IS, HOWEVER, ANOTHER SIDE TO THE PICTURE. AS AN ADVANCED<br />
INDUSTRIAL NATION THERE IS A GOOD CASE FOR AUSTRALIA DEVELOPING<br />
BOTH INDIGENOUS HARDWIARE AND SOFTWARE IN THOSE AREAS WHERE TO<br />
DO SO WOULD REPRESENT AN EFFICIENT USE OF AUSTRALIAN RESOURCES<br />
OF SKILL AND EXPERTISE.<br />
THERE HAVE BEEN PROBLEMS IN DEVELOPING SUCH A CAPACITY, THESE<br />
HAVE INCLUDED THE NON-AVAILABILITY OF FINANCE FOR ENTERPRISES<br />
PROMOTING HIGH TECHNOLOGY AND AN APPARENT LACK OF MANAGERIAL<br />
EXPERTISE AMONG THOSE INTERESTED IN ESTABLISHING HIGH<br />
TECHNOLOGY ENTERPRISES, THE RECENT MOVES BY THE GOVERNMENT TO<br />
STIMULATE THE ESTABL. ISHMENT OF A VENTURE-CAPITAL MARKET IN<br />
AUSTRALIA ARE AIMED AT ADDRESSING THESE PROBLEMS, </p>
<p>THE MEASURES WE HAVE ANNOUNCED SHOULD LEAD TO SOME $ 40 , ilLION<br />
BEING AVAILABLE TO HIGH RISK INDUSTRY VENTJURES, LACK OF CAPITAL<br />
SHOULD NO LONGER BE A SIGNIFICANT IMPEDIMENT TO THE ESTAB LISHMENT<br />
OF SUCH EINTERPRISES. THE GOVERNMENT'S MOVES SHOULD ALSO<br />
SEE THE FORMATION IN AUSTRALIA OF MANAGEMENT AND INVESTMENtT<br />
COMPANIES. SUCH COMPANIES AFTER ASSESSING EACH VENTURE<br />
IN TERMS OF TECHNICAL AND MARKET PROSPECTS FOR ITS ' RODUCTS<br />
SHOULD BE ABLE TO PROVIDE NOT ONLY CAPITAL BUT ALSO OFTEN<br />
BADLY NEEDED MANAGEMENT SKILLs,<br />
THE GOVERNMENT IS CONCERNED TO ENSURE THAT THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
COMPUTER INDUSTRY ACHIEVES ITS MAXIIMUM CONTRIBUTION TO THE<br />
ECONOMY. THE OVERALL BENEFITS WILL BE GREATEST IF THE<br />
COMPUTER INDUSTRY STRIVES TO INCREASE THE COMPETITIVENESS<br />
OF ITS PRODUCTS AND TO MARKET THEM WITH VIGOUR BOTH IN<br />
AUSTRALIA AND OVERSEAS.<br />
LET ME MAKE A POINT IN PASSING ABOUT SOME OF THE APPROACHES<br />
GOVERNMENT RECEIVES FROM PROMOTERS OF THE NEW HIGH TECHNOLOGY<br />
INDUSTRIES. W'HILE WE ARE VERY MUCH SYMPATHETIC TO THE<br />
PARTICULAR AND LEGITIMATE NEEDS OF YOUR INDUSTRY IT IS SELFDEFEATING<br />
IF THE GOVERNMENT IS BEING ASKED TO COI. 1IT ITSELF<br />
TO THE MAINTENANCE OF THE COMMERCIAL UTILISATION CO CERTAIN<br />
" KEY TECHNOLOGIES", IT IS NEITHER IN THE CONMUNITY'S NOR THE<br />
INDUSTRY'S INTEREST TO MOVE DOWN A TRACK WHICH LOCKS THE<br />
GOVERNMENT INTO CONTINUING ROUNDS OF ASSISTANCE AIMiED AT<br />
ENSURING THE CONTINUED UTILISATION OF TECHNOLOGIES IN<br />
CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE ADJUSTMENT TO CHANGING TECHNOLOGIES<br />
SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED, </p>
<p>THE BALANCE IS NOT A; i EASY ONE TO STRIKE, BUT IT IS IMFORTANT<br />
TO THE LONG TERM MAINTENANCE OF EFFICIENT INDUSTRY STRUCTURES<br />
IN AUSTRALIA THAT THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH SOME FORMS OF<br />
ASSISTANCE BE FULLY RECOGNISED,<br />
AUSTRALIA CANNOT HOPE TO SPECIALISE IN ALL AREAS OF APPLIED<br />
MICRO-ELECTRONICS, THE GOVERNMENT RECENTLY INITIATED A<br />
MAJOR STUDY TO IDENTIFY THE MAIN AREAS OF AUSTRALIAN COMPETENCE<br />
IN MICRO-ELECTRONICS, THIS STUDY WILL LOOK AT THE WORLD<br />
POTENTIAL FOR GROWTH IN THIS FIELD, AND IDENTIFY AREAS OF<br />
MAXIMUM OPPORTUNITY FOR AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRY, IT SHOULD<br />
PROVIDE IMPORTANT INTELLIGENCE FOR AUSTRALIAN COMPANIES, AND<br />
HELP TO ENSURE THAT THE GOVERNMENT'S POLICIES IN THIS AREA<br />
ARE FOCUSSED AND CO-ORDINATED FOR MAXIMUM IMPACT, THE IAC's<br />
FORTHCOMING REPORT ON THE COMPUTER INDUSTRY SHOULD ALSO BE<br />
OF CONSIDERABLE ASSISTANCE IN EXPANDING THE DATA BASE,<br />
AUSTRALIA'S LONG-TERM FUTURE LIES IN DEVELOPING AND MAINTAINING<br />
A DYNAMIC COMPETITIVE ECONOMY, SINCE BEING ELECTED TO OFFICE<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN LABOR GOVERNMENT'S OVERRIDING CONCERN HAS BEEN<br />
THE RESTORATION OF A BASIS FOR SUSTAINED ECONOMIC GROWTH.<br />
INDUSTRIAL INNOVATION HAS AN IMPORTANT PART TO PLAY IF AUSTRALIA<br />
IS TO MAXIMISE ITS GROWTH POTENTIAL SO THAT WE AS A PEOPLE<br />
CAN BE MORE CONFIDENT OF OUR OWN FUTURE WELL-BEING, </p>
<p>IN THIS REGARD AUSTRALIA MUST MOVE TO BUILD MORE DYNAMIC<br />
INDUSTRIAL STRUCTURES ACROSS THE BOARD, THE DYNAMIC PROCESSES<br />
OF ADOPTING NEW TECHNOLOGY IS INTEGRAL TO IMPROVING THE<br />
EFFICIENCY OF INDUSTRY, ITS COMPETITIVE PERFORMANCE ; AND ITS<br />
CAPACITY TO GROW.'<br />
THERE IS SIMPLY NO ESCAPING THE FACT THAT INDUSTRIAL INNOVATION<br />
BY BOTH NEW AND EXISTING INDUSTRIES IS ESSENTIAL TO AUSTRALIA'S<br />
FUTURE ECONOMIC WELL-BEING. NEW TECHNOLOGY IS ONE OF THE<br />
DRIVING FORCES BEHIND THE PROCESSES OF ECONOMIC CHANGE WITH<br />
IMPORTANT CONSEQUENCES FOR THE COMPETITIVENESS OF INDUSTRIES,<br />
T I<br />
THROUGH IT WE CAN ANTICIPATE NOT ONLY THE BENEFITS TO ECONOMIC<br />
GROWTH ASSOCIATED WITH THE EMERGENCE OF NEW INDUSTRY STRUCTURES,<br />
BUT ALSO THE GAINS LIKELY TO BE ACHIEVED THROUGH THE<br />
REVITALISATION OF EXISTING INDUSTRIES,<br />
OTHER COUNTRIES, PARTICULARLY IN THE PACIFIC REGION, ARE<br />
UNDERTAKING NEW LONG TERM INVESTMENTS, ADOPTING NEW BUSINESS<br />
STRATEGIES AND DEVELOPING NEW TECHNOLOGY OPPORTUNITIES, IF<br />
WE ARE TO BENEFIT FULLY FROM BEING PART OF THIS DYNAMIC GROWTH<br />
REGION IF WE ARE TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY OUR INDUSTRIES<br />
MUST DEVELOP AND ADOPT NEW TECHNOLOGIES NEW PRODUCTS AND<br />
PROCESSES,<br />
OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE PROBLEMS WITH MOVING DOWN THIS TRACK,<br />
INNOVATION OFTEN LEADS TO DIRECT DISPLACEMENT OF LABOUR AT THE<br />
POINT WHERE TECHNOLOGY IS INTRODUCED, INDISPUTABLY TECHNOLOGICAL<br />
CHANGE IS GOING NOT ONLY TO CHANGE THE NATURE OF JOBS, IT IS<br />
ALSO GOING TO HAVE SIGNIFICANT IMPLICATIONS FOR PATTERNS OF<br />
WORK, AT THE SAME TIME CERTAIN INDIRECT EMPLOYMENT<br />
s ./ 6 </p>
<p>EFFECTS ARE SOMETIMES ASSOCIATED WITH NEW PROCESSES, NEW<br />
INVESTMENT CAN BOTH INCREASE REAL INCOMES ASSOCIATED W'ITH<br />
THE TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION AND THE OVERALL DEMAND FOR<br />
LABOUR. REAL PRICE REDUCTIONS CAN ALSO BE ACHIEVED WITH A<br />
CONSEGUENT INCREASE IN THE REAL DEMAND FOR PRODUCTS,<br />
' WHAT IS NEEDED IS A SENSITIVE, CAREFULLY BALANCED RESPONSE<br />
WHICH RECOGNISES THE ROLE OF TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION AS A<br />
KEY REQUIREMENT IN IMPROVING THE PRODUCTIVITY OF EXISTING<br />
INDUSTRIES, AND IN DEVELOPING NEW ONES, WHILE ACKNOWLEDGING<br />
AND ADDRESSING EFFECTIVELY THE SOCIAL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH<br />
NEW PATTERNS OF DEVELOPMENT. A COMPREHENSIVE, INTEGRATED<br />
POLICY APPROACH IS REQUIRED OF THE GOVERNMENT, SUCH AN<br />
APPROACH, THE FRAMEWORK OF AN INDUSTRIAL POLICY, NECESSARILY<br />
INCLUDES THE MAINTENANCE OF SOUND MACRO-ECONOMIC AND TRADE<br />
POLICIES, IMPROVEMENTS IN THE EDUCATION SYSTEM AND TRAINING<br />
PROGRAMS, AND THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF EFFECTIVE CONSULTATICN<br />
REGARDING THE ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH THE INTRODUCTICN OF NEW<br />
TECHNOLOGIES. YET IT MUST BE EMPHASISED THAT THE GOVERNMENT'S ROLE IS<br />
PRIMARILY TO PROVIDE A CLIMATE CONDUCIVE TO VIGOROUS<br />
INNOVATION IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR, SO ENCOURAGING NEW INDUSTRIES<br />
AND ADDITIONAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES,<br />
IN AUSTRALIA SMALL FIRMS HAVE A PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT<br />
ROLE TO PLAY, THEY HAVE DEMONSTRATED REMARKABLE ABILITY AS<br />
S./ 7 </p>
<p>PURVEYORS OF INNOVATION, PARTICULARLY IN INDUSTRIES<br />
CHARACTERISED BY HIGH GROWTH RATES AND TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE,<br />
IT WILL BE THE YOUNG, SMALL, PRODUCTIVE, INNOVATIVE FIRMS<br />
WHICH ARE MOST LIKELY TO BE FAST GROWING, THEIR CONTRIBUTION<br />
TO THE FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF THE AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY, TO<br />
PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH, WILL QUITE LIKELY BE CONSIDERABLE,<br />
I SHOULD EXPECT MANY FIRMS REPRESENTED HERE TODAY TO BE AT<br />
THE FOREFRONT OF THIS ACTIVITY,<br />
INNOVATIVE, FORWARD-LOOKING INDUSTRIAL SYSTEMS, CARRY WITHIN<br />
THEMSELVES PRE-CONDITIONS OF ENHANCED DOMESTIC PROSPERITY, THE<br />
MORE TRADITIONAL INDUSTRIES MUST BE ENCOURAGED TO SIEZE THE<br />
OPPORTUNITIES PRESENTED, AND THE FULL POTENTIAL OF THE NEW<br />
TECHNOLOGY-BASED INDUSTRIES SHOULD BE FULLY EXPLOITED, THERE<br />
WILL UNDOUBTEDLY BE PROBLEMS ADJUSTING TO THE CHANGES ASSOCIATED<br />
WITH NEW AND HIGH TECHNOLOGY, AND WE MUST BE CAREFUL IN<br />
OUR APPROACH, BUT THE LONG-TERM INTEREST OF ALL AUSTRALIANS<br />
DICTATES THAT WE FOLLOW THIS COURSE, THE FACT IS THAT<br />
THE MORE RAPID DIFFUSION OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES THE BETTER<br />
OFF AUSTRALIA IS LIKELY TO BE, FAILURE TO EXPLOIT THE<br />
ADVANTAGES MORE THAN LIKELY WILL RESULT IN LOWER REAL<br />
INCOMES. POSITIVE FORWARD LOOKING POLICIES, RATHER THAN<br />
NEGATIVE, RE-ACTIVE ONES ARE THOSE THAT WE SHOULD PURSUE.<br />
FOR ITS PART THE GOVERNMENT IS COMMITTED TO SUCH AN APPROACH,<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN COMMUNITY, NEVERTHELESS, WILL ONLY GAIN THE<br />
FULL BENEFITS OF TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION IF THE COSTS<br />
ASSOCIATED WITH IT ARE ACCEPTABLE TO THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE,<br />
I I/ o </p>
<p>SIN PART THIS MEANS ADDRESSING DELIBERATELY THE MAINNER VHICH<br />
NEW TECHNOLOGIES ARE INTRODUCED, A'ND ENSURING THAT TrOSE PFFECTED<br />
ARE ADEQUATELY PREPARED FOR A CHANGING WORK ENVIRONMENT.<br />
A COMMOl THREAD RUNNING THROUGH THE EXPERIENCE OF THOSE<br />
COUNTRIES MOST SUCCESSFUL IIN HANDLING THE INTRODUCTI ON OF<br />
MODERN TECHNOLOGIES HAS BEEN THE WILLINGNESS OF THE SOCIAL<br />
PARTNERS OF GOVERNMENT, UNIONS AND EMPLOYERS TO CONSULT<br />
WITH EACH OTHER AT THE NATIONAL INDUSTRY AND ENTERPRISE LEVEL<br />
AND TO ANTICIPATE AND RESOLVE PROBLEMS INVOLVED,<br />
IN AUSTRALIA, PARTICIPATION BY OTHER GROUPS WITH MANAGEMENT<br />
IN THE PROCESSES OF APPLYING TECHNOLOGY THROUGH MEANS SUCH<br />
AS CONSULTATION, SYSTEMS DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION, TRAINING<br />
AND RE-TRAINING IS NOT A WELL ESTABLISHED PRACTICE, THERE<br />
ARE, I ACKNOWLEDGE, PROBLEMS IN MORE OPEN CONSULTATIVE<br />
APPROACHES, THERE IS FOR EXAMPLE, THE ISSUE OF CONFIDENTIALITY<br />
OF INFORMATION RELEVANT TO SUCH CONSULTATIONS, SOME WOULD<br />
ARGUE, FOR EXAMPLE, THAT IF PROPOSALS FOR THE INTRODUCTION<br />
OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES ARE DIVULGED AT TOO EARLY A STAGE, THE<br />
EFFECT MIGHT BE TO DISCLOSE BROADER , MARKETS TRATEGIES,<br />
THEREBY COMPROMISING COMPANIES' COMPETITIVE POSITIONS,<br />
BUT THERE IS OVERWHELMING BENEFIT IN A PROCESS OF CONSULTATION<br />
THAT SMOOTHS THE TRANSITIONAL ARRANGEMENTS IMPLICIT IN THE<br />
CHANGES ASSOCIATED WITH NEW PRODUCTS AND PROCESSES.<br />
THE POINT I AM MAKING IS NOT ESPECIALLY NEW, RECOGNITION OF<br />
THE NEED FOR MORE EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION TO FACILITATE<br />
INITIATION TO TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE DATES BACK TO THE LATE </p>
<p>CONCEPTS SUCH AS WORKER PARTICIPATION AND JOINT DEC ISIO-MAKING<br />
MIGHT SEEM LESS THREATENING IF ALL PARTIES WERE COMMITTED TO<br />
THE OPTIMAL ADAPTATION OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES TO THE NEEDS AND<br />
SKILLS OF THE WORKFORCE, AND TO THE EFFECTIVE INTEGRATION OF<br />
THE NEW TECHNOLOGIES WITH THE INDUSTRIAL PROCESSES OF THE<br />
ENTERPRISE CONCERNED,<br />
AT THE HEART OF AUSTRALIA'S ABILITY TO MAINTAIN COMPETITIVE<br />
INDUSTRIAL STRUCTURES AND, THROUGH THEM AN ACCEPTABLY HIGH<br />
STANDARD OF LIVING, IS THE NEED TO HAVE A SUITABLY FLEXIBLE<br />
AUSTRALIAN WORKFORCE, NEW TECHNOLOGIES DEMAND AN<br />
UNPRECEDENTED DEGREE OF ADAPTABILITY IN THE WORKFORCE,<br />
TRAINING THE WORKFORCE TO MAXIMISE THE BENEFITS OF MORE<br />
SOPHISITICATED CAPITAL PROCESSES IS OF FUNDAMENTAL IMPORTANCE,<br />
IE MUST GIVE URGENT ATTENTION TO THE CREATION OF A BASE OF<br />
SKILLS ACROSS THE WHOLE WORKFORCE THROUGH EDUCATION AND<br />
TRAINING OF YOUNG PEOPLE, AT THE SAME TIME AS ENSURING AN<br />
ADEQUATE RE-TRAINING OF THE EXISTING WORKFORCE TO HANDLE<br />
NEW TECHNOLOGIES MORE CAPABLY. HEAVY INVESTMENT IN EDUCATION<br />
AND TRAINING IS AN INVESTMENT IN OUR FUTURE,<br />
I AM ABSOLUTELY CONVINCED THAT A MORE SKILLED WORKFORCE IS<br />
ESSENTIAL IF AUSTRALIA IS TO COMPETE IN THE NEW TECHNOLOGY<br />
ERA, BROADLY BASED TRAINING WHICH EQUIPS OUR PEOPLE WITH<br />
THE NECESSARY BASIC SKILLS IS IMPERATIVE, BASIC NUMERACY<br />
AND LITERACY ARE NEEDED AS IS FLEXIBILITY IF THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN WORKER IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO ADAPT READILY TO<br />
NEW TECHNOLOGIES, 10 TAKE MAXItMUM ADVANTAGE OF ./ 11 </p>
<p>19b0' S ANI IS REFLECTED IN BOTH CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION<br />
COMMISSION AND fNATIONAL LABOR ADVISORY COUNCIL GUIDELINES,<br />
MORE RECENTLY, IN 1981, THE VICTORIAN GOVERNMENT INTRODUCED<br />
GUIDELINES WHICH RECOMMENDED THAT PRIOR TO ANY DECISION BEING<br />
TAKEN IN THE BUSINESS SECTOR TO INTRODUCE NEW TECHNOLOGY,<br />
THE EMPLOYER SHOULD BE PREPARED TO NOTIFY EMPLOYEES OR<br />
THEIR REPRESENTATIVES TO PROVIDE A STATEIMENT FOR DISCUSSION<br />
WHICH WOULD SET OUT REASONS FOR THE PROPOSED CHANGES AND THE<br />
NATURE OF THOSE CHANGES, AND THEIR CONSEQUENCE FOR THE<br />
WORKFORCE. DESPITE THE EXISTENCE OF SUCH GUIDELINES, THERE ARE STILL<br />
FEW EXAMPLES OF EFFECTIVE CONSULTATIVE ARRANGEMENTS, SURVEYS<br />
OF INDUSTRY PRACTICE REVEAL THAT IN AUSTRALIA CONSULTATION<br />
IS AN INFREQUENT OCCURRENCE, AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF FORMAL<br />
JOINT CONSULTATIVE BODIES IS RARE, IHE SAME SURVEYS REVEAL<br />
THAT THE ISSUES NORMALLY CONSIDERED APPROPRIATE TO JOINT<br />
DECISION-MAKING ARE FEW AND AT A LOW LEVEL, WITH EMPHASIS<br />
ON SOME ASPECTS OF WORKPLACE DESIGN AND CHOICE OF PARTICULAR<br />
TYPES OF EQUIPMENT, CHANGED WORK PATTERNS ASSOCIATED WITH<br />
THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW TECHNOLOGY ARE RARELY CONSIDERED.<br />
A MORE COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO CONSULTATION ON NEW<br />
TECHNOLOGIES SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED, DECISIONS AIMED AT INCREASING<br />
THE ADAPTABILITY OF THE INDIVIDUAL BOTH WITHIN FIRMS AND BEYOND<br />
COULD BE A USEFUL FINAL STEP, SUCH ADAPTABILITY MIGHT EE<br />
SOUGHT NOT ONLY FROM THE WORKER CONFRONTED WITH THE IMMEDIATE<br />
DEMANDS OF NEW PROCESSES, BUT ALSO FROM MANAGEMENT, I. ./ lu </p>
<p>TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE, IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT WE INVEST NOT<br />
JUST IN EQUIPMENT BUT ALSO IN HUMAN SKILLS,<br />
V IE MUST TAKE A LONG, HARD LOOK AT WHAT IS HAPPENING I N OUR<br />
EDUCATION SYSTEM, IT IS PROFOUNDLY DISTURBING THAT LESS<br />
THAN 40% OF OUR YOUNG PEOPLE AGED 17 YEARS ARE ENROLLED<br />
FULL-TIME IN SECONDARY SCHOOL WHEN MORE THAN 85Z OF THEIR<br />
COUNTERPARTS IN THE UNITED STATES AND JAPAN ARE, FOR<br />
WHATEVER REASONS, STILL IN SCHOOL. THIS IS TO TIE ONE HAND<br />
BEHIND OUR BACK BEFORE W~ E START. UNLESS UNDERPINNED BY<br />
BASIC LEVELS OF EDUCATIONAL ACHIEVEMENT, OUR WORKFORCE<br />
WILL SIMPLY LACK THE CAPACITY EITHER TO WORK EFFECTIVELY<br />
WITH NEW TECHNOLOGIES, OR TO ADAPT SUFFICIENTLY RAPIDLY TO<br />
THEIR DEMANDS,<br />
GOVERNMENT POLICY AIMS TO PROMOTE INCREASED PARTICIPATION<br />
BY OUR YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE EDUCATION SYSTEM, THE PACE AND<br />
DISSEMINATION OF TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE REQUIRES MORE RATHER<br />
THAN LESS POST-SCHOOL EDUCATION, ACCORDINGLY, WE HAVE<br />
ALLOCATED $ 71.5 MILLION FOR THE PARTICIPATION AN! D EQUITY<br />
PROGRAM IN 1984. THIS PROGRAM AIMS DIRECTLY TO PROMOTE<br />
INCREASED PARTICIPATION OF YOUNG PEOPLE IN POST-COMPULSORY<br />
EDUCATION PARTICULARLY IN SCHOOLS WITH LOW RETENTION RATES.<br />
THE GOVERNMENT HAS ALSO PROVIDED A FURTHER $ 10 MILLION TO<br />
UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES OF ADVANCED EDUCATION FOR AN<br />
ADDITIONAL 3,000 STUDENT MEMBERS IN 198' 4.<br />
AS A NATION WE MUST BE PREPARED TO INVEST HEAVILY IN HUMAN<br />
SKILLS. ONLY IF WE EQUIP OUR PEOPLE WITH SKILLS AND<br />
,/ 12 </p>
<p>ATTITUDES ENABLING THEM TO COMPETE EFt: ECTIVELY TO FACE<br />
THE UNCERTAINTIES OF THE FUTURE, FLEXIBLY AND WITH CONF; DEN1CE,<br />
CAN WE MAKE THE MOST OF FUTURE OPPORTUNITIES,<br />
IN PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES IT IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT THAT<br />
INDIVIDUALS DEVELOP FLEXIBILITY THROUGH BROADLY BASED<br />
TRAINING, IN TIMES WHEN THE BASE OF STRUCTURAL AND<br />
TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE IS MIORE THAN LIKELY TO FORCE MANY<br />
PEOPLE TO CHANGE OCCUPATIONS DURING THEIR WORKING LIVES,<br />
THE EDUCATION SYSTEM MUST BE GEARED SO AS TO FIT STUDENTS<br />
FOR AS WIDE A RANGE OF OCCUPATIONS AS POSSIBLE.<br />
A MORE PLANNED APPROACH TO RELATING THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM<br />
MORE CLOSELY TO TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE IS NEEDED, THE FUTURE<br />
CANNOT BE LEFT TO CHANCE, ' iWE MUST ENSURE THAT THROUGH OUR<br />
EDUCATION SYSTEM AN ADEQUATE UNDERSTANDING IS ACHIEVED OF<br />
THE USES AND IMPACTS OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES, OF THE WAY THEY<br />
AFFECT THE TYPE OF WORK AVAILABLE. AND WAY IT IS ORGANISED.<br />
THE PLACE TO START DEVELOPING THIS UNDERSTANDING IS IN OUR<br />
SCHOOLS, AND SCHOOL CURRICULA WILL NEED TO EXPAND TO TAKE<br />
UP THE CHALLENGE OF THIS NEW FACET OF LEARNING,<br />
As AUSTRALIAN COMPUTER INDUSTRY REPRESENTATIVES, I AM SURE<br />
YOU ALL APPRECIATE THE POINT I AM MAKING, I KNOW YOU WOULD<br />
ALL AGREE THAT COMPUTER LITERACY IS A BASIC SKILL OF THE<br />
1980' S AND BEYOND, AND YET SOME 90 PER CENT OF STUDENTS WHO<br />
FINISHED THEIR SECONDARY SCHOOLING. IN 1982 HAVE NO UNDERSTANDING </p>
<p>OF MICROCOMPUTERS, SO',: THING SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE ABOUT<br />
LONG AGO. THE GOVERNMENT IS NOW GIVING PRIORITY TO REMEDYING<br />
THIS BASIC DEFICIENCY,<br />
AS A MAJOR INITIATIVE AIIED AT STIMULATING ACTION IN THIS CRUCI<br />
AREA, WE WILL PROVIDE $ 18 MILLION OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS TO<br />
INTRODUCE A COM* PUTER EDUCATION PROGRAM FOR SECONDARY SCHOOLS.<br />
IN 1984 $ 4,8 MILLION WILL BE ALLOCATED TO GOVERNMENT SCHOOLS,<br />
AND $ 1.2 MILLION TO NON-GOVERNMENT SCHOOLS, A NATIOiNAL ADVISCO<br />
COMMITTEE ON COMPUTERS IN SCHOOLS WILL REPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT<br />
BY 30 SEPTEMBER ON THE MOST APPROPRIATE WAY OF IMPLE-MENTING THI<br />
PROGRAM. IT HAS BEEN EXAMININIG NEEDS IN AREAS SUCH AS SOCIAL<br />
DEVELOPMENT, SOFTWARE, HARDWARE AND EVALUATION AND SUPPORT<br />
SERVICES, THE COMMITTEE WILL MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE<br />
CCfmIONWEALTH SCHOOLS COMMISSION ON THE STRUCTURE AND SCOPE OF<br />
THIS PROGRAM. WHILE THE PROGRAM WILL CONCENTRATE ON SECONDARY<br />
SCHOOLS, THE COMMISSION HAS BEEN ASKED TO EXAMINE THE POSSIBILI<br />
OF FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS, INCLUDING THEIR EXTENSION INTO PRIMARY<br />
SCHOOLS.<br />
THE GOVERNMENT ALSO BELIEVES THAT IT IS IMPORTANT TO ENSURE TH;<br />
THE DISADVANTAGED RECEIVE ACCESS TO THE PROGFAM, AND THAT THIS<br />
SHOULD PROMOTE SHARING OF RESOURCES WHERE THIS IS APPROPRIATE.<br />
NOT ONLY THE COMMONWEALTH BUT ALSO THE RELEVANT STATE AUTHORITI<br />
AND YOUR OWN INDUSTRY SHARE AN INTEREST IN THE SUCCESS OF THIS<br />
PROGRAM. IT IS HISTORIC IN ITS ORIGINALITY AND CRITICAL TO OUF<br />
FUTURE COMPETENCE AS A PEOPLE.<br />
LOOKING TO THE LONGER TERM, WE HAVE ALSO DEEMED IT DESIRABLE TC<br />
RE-ESTABLISH THE CURRICULA DEVELOPMENT CENTRE AS AN ADVISORY<br />
BODY TO THE SCHOOLS ' COMMISSION. WIE SHOULD EXPECT THIS CENTRE,<br />
RATHER THAN PROMOTING THE SO-CALLED " SOFT OPTIONS", </p>
<p>TO LOCK VERY CAREFULLY INSTEAD) TO ENSURING THE RELEVAIL<br />
TO CONTEMPORARY AND FUTURE NEEDS OF EXISTING SCHOOL CURRICULA.<br />
THERE ARE GAPS TO BE PLUGOED ESPECIALLY IN RESPECT OF<br />
I SSUES POSED BY THE EMERGENCE OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND THE<br />
CENTRE WOULD BE FALLING DOWN INI ITS TrASK WERE IT NOTr TO3<br />
GIVE PRIORITY TO ADDRESSING SUCH DEFICIENCIES,<br />
AT THE TERTIARY LEVEL IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT THAT UNIVERSITY<br />
PROGRAMS BE MORE FULLY GEARED TO MEETING THE DEMAND FOR<br />
COURSES THAT ARE RELEVANT TO NEW EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES,<br />
THERE HAS OFTEN BEEN TOO LITTLE FLEXIBILITY IN UNIVERSITY<br />
TO SUCH NEEDS IN THE PAST, FOR EXAMPLE, BY<br />
COMPARISON WITH INDUSTRY NEEDS, THE UNIVERSITIES HAVE BEEN<br />
PRODUCING TOO FEW COMPUTER PROFESSIONALS IN RECENT YEARS,<br />
TERTIARY INSTITUTIONS SHOULD BE PREPARED TO SHIFT RESOURCES<br />
PROMPTLY TO MEET CHANGES IN DEMAND FOR THE TRAINING THAT<br />
THEY OFFER.<br />
ULTIMATELY, I REMAIN CONFIDENT THAT OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM<br />
CAN COPE WITH THE DEMANDS LIKELY TO BE MADE UPON IT, BUT<br />
THE TRAINING AND RE-TRAINING REQUIREMENTS OF THE CLURRENT<br />
WORKFORCE PRESENT MORE DIFFICULT PROBLEMS, THE LOWER RATE<br />
OF ENTRY TO THE LABOUR FORCE BY YOUNG PEOPLE, THE REDUCED<br />
IMMIGRATION RATE, AND THE INCREASING PARTICIPATION BY<br />
WOMEN OF ALL AGE GROUPS IS LIKELY TO INCREASE THE AVERAGE<br />
AGE IN THE LABOUR FORCE, POSSIBLY REDUCING ITS ABILITY TO<br />
ADJUST TO CHANGING PATTERNS OF LABOUR DEMAND AND INCREASING<br />
THE NEED FOR RE-TRAINING, </p>
<p>RE-TRAINING IS NOW BECOMING A LIFELONG REQUIREMENT. BUT<br />
IT IS NOT EASY TO RE-TRAIN, RE-TRAINIrNG DOES OCCUR WITHIN<br />
SOME INDUSTRIES, AND IS AN IMPORTANT AVENUE OF ADJUSTMENT TO<br />
TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE FOR THOSE WHO HAVE STABLE JOBS<br />
OR HOPE OF REDEPLOYMENT WITHIN FIRMS OFFERING SUCH<br />
OPPORTUNIIIES, THOSE NEEDING TO RE-TRAIN FOR VERY DIFFERENT<br />
FORMS OF EMPLOYMENT ARE SOMETIMES LESS FORTUNATE, IN LARGE<br />
PART, HOWEVER, THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR RE-TRAINING RESTS WITH<br />
THE INDIVIDUAL. THERE ARE MANY FACILITIES THROUGHOUT THE<br />
CC'MMUNITY PROVIDING OPPORTUNITIES FOR RE-TRAINING, AND<br />
ENTERPRISING INDIVIDUALS WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF SUCH<br />
OPPORTUNITIES. BUT I READILY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE EXPERIENCE<br />
OF AUSTRALIA AND IN OTHER COUNTRIES SUGGESTS THAT THE GOVERNME1NT<br />
WILL BE REQUIRED TO PLAY AN ACTIVE ROLE IN RE-TRAINING EITHER<br />
DIRECTLY OR THROUGH THE PROVISION OF INCENTIVES TO THE PRIVATE<br />
SECTOR, IN THE FINAL ANALYSIS THE SUCCESS WITH WHICH AUSTRALIAN<br />
INDUSTRY UTILISES NEW TECHNOLOGY TO HEIGHTEN COMPETITIVENESS<br />
WILL DEPEND ON THE ABILITY OF THE WORKFORCE TO WORK EFFECTIVELY<br />
WITH THE TECHNOLOGIES BEING INTRODUCED, WE MUST PLAN<br />
FOR THE CREATION OF A BASE OF SKILLS ACROSS THE WHOLE WORK<br />
FORCE THROUGH THE GENERAL EDUCATION SYSTEM, AND AT THE SAME<br />
TIME ENSURE THE ADEQUATE RE-TRAINING OF THE EXISTING WORKFORCE<br />
TO HANDLE NEW TECHNOLOGIES MORE CAPABLY. WE MUST ENSURE<br />
THAT INDUSTRY'S DEMANDS FOR PARTICULAR TYPES OF LABOUR ARE<br />
MATCHED BY SKILLS BEING DEVELOPED BY TRAINING INSTITUTIONS,<br />
THE FUTURE MUST NOT BE JEOPARDISED BY THE SLUGGISH RESPONSE<br />
OF THE LABOUR MARKET TO CHANGE. THERE MUST BE A CAREFUL<br />
MATCHING UP OF TRAINING AND RE-TRAINING PROGRAMS TO ENSURE THAT<br />
,/ 16<br />
I q </p>
<p>BASIC AND TRANSFERABLE SKILLS ARE DEVELOPED AND THE<br />
REQUIREMENTS OF INDUSTRY MET.<br />
I'ATCHING UP THE COMMUNITY'S HUMAN RESOURCE BASE WITH THE<br />
DEMANDS IMPOSED BY THE PACE OF TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION<br />
DEMANDS A WELL-INFORMED APPRECIATION OF THE REQUIREMENTS<br />
OF OUR CHANGING INDUSTRIAL SYSTEMS, IT ALSO PRESUMES<br />
THE EXISTENCE OF A COMMUNITY CONSENSUS AROUND HOW WE MIGHT<br />
BEST MOVE TO MEET THE RAPIDLY CHANGING DEMANDS OF A<br />
HIGHLY COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT,<br />
THE SUCCESS WITH WHICH AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRY UTILISES TECHNOLOGY<br />
TO HEIGHTEN COMPETITIVENSS WILL GREATLY DEPEND ON THE<br />
WILLINGNESS AND ADAPTABILITY OF THE WORKFORCE TO ADAPT TO,<br />
AND WORK EFFECTIVELY WITH, THE NEW TECHNOLOGIES BEING<br />
INTRODUCED.<br />
WHAT IS NEEDED IS A COHERENT, COMPREHENSIVE AND GENERALLY<br />
ACCEPTED APPROACH, THIS WILL ONLY FLOW FROM EXTENSIVE<br />
AND WELL-INFORMED PUBLIC DEBATE, THE SUCCESSFUL MANAGEMENT<br />
OF TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE REQUIRES THAT ITS BENEFITS BE FULLY<br />
REALISED AND ITS NEGATIVE EFFECTS MINIMISED, THE OPPORTUNITIES<br />
ARE IMMENSE, BUT IF THE TRANSITION IS TO BE SUCCESSFUL, ACTION<br />
IS REQUIRED NOT ONLY FROM GOVERNMENT BUT ALSO FROM THE<br />
BUSINESS COMMUNITY, FROM EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS, AND<br />
FROM THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE. GROUPS SUCH AS YOUR OWN,<br />
WHO ARE WELL EQUIPPED WITH AN APPRECIATION OF THE POTENTIAL<br />
ASSOCIATED WITH CONTEMPORARY FORMS OF TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE,<br />
HAVE AN IMPORTANT ROLE TO PLAY, / 17 </p>
<p>YOU ARE WELL PLACED TO:<br />
ENSURE INFORMATION ON THE NEWEST TECHNOLOGY<br />
IS AVAILABLE;<br />
ASSESS, IN CO-OPERATION WITH OPINION LEADERS<br />
IN THE COMMUNITY, THE LIKELY IMPACT OF NEW<br />
TECHNOLOGIES; STIMULATE COMMUNITY CONSIDERATION OF THESE<br />
ISSUES SO THAT ALL GROUPS ARE WELL-PLACED TO<br />
MAKE THE BEST CHOICE AND DECISIONS FOR AUSTRALIA<br />
AS A WHOLE ON THE USE OF THE NEW TECHNOLOGIES.<br />
I ASK YOU TODAY TO USE YOUR RESOURCES TO MOVE THINGS FORWARD<br />
BOTH IN YOUR OWN INDUSTRY, AND TO HELP PROVIDE THE BASIS<br />
FOR SUSTAINED, LONG-TERM ECONOMIC GROWTH FOR AUSTRALIA<br />
AND A CONTINUED IMPROVEMENT IN THE WELL-BEING OF ALL<br />
AUSTRALIANS, WE CANNOT TURN OUR BACK ON TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE. THE CHALLENGE<br />
BEFORE US IS TO UNDERSTAND IT; DEBATE IT AND MOULD IT TO<br />
OUR OWN PURPOSES. A MORE PROSPEROUS, THRIVING AUSTRALIA<br />
WILL BE THE MEASURE OF OUR SUCCESS. </p>
