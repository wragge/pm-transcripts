FOR MEDIA November 17 1985<br />
The Heads of the Public Service of five countries will meet in<br />
Canberra this week to discuss the reforms that are transforming<br />
the public sector in Westminster type democracies.<br />
Public Service chiefs from the United Kingdom, Canada, Ireland<br />
and New Zealand will meet with the Australian Public Service<br />
Board to discuss modernisation of their Governments'<br />
, administrations.<br />
As the Public Service in parliamentary democracies has grown in<br />
size and complexity it has become clear that radical reform is<br />
needed. Measures to increase ministerial control and to improve<br />
management practices and ensure effectiveness and equity in<br />
service delivery are being considered or implemented everywhere.<br />
The reforms currently being undertaken in Australia probably put<br />
us ahead of the field at this stage.<br />
The fact that Australia is hosting the Conference and that it has<br />
attracted such high level delegates is an indication of the<br />
interest being shown elsewhere in the world in changes being made<br />
in Australia.<br />
Two of the four delegations from overseas will be led by women.<br />
They are Mrs Huguette Labelle, Chairman of the Canadian Public<br />
Service Commission and Ms Anne Mueller, Second Permanent<br />
Secretary of the British management and Personnel Office.<br />
The other two delegations will be led by Mr Kevin Murphy,<br />
Secretary to the Irish Department of the Public Service and Dr<br />
Mervyn Probine, Chairman of the New Zealand State Services<br />
Commission.<br />
Among the issues to be discussed will be the responsiveness of<br />
the Public Service to political control, the appointment and<br />
training of senior public servants, affirmative action for women<br />
and disadvantaged groups, changes in administrative law and<br />
industrial democracy.<br />
The conference will commence on Monday November 18 and conclude<br />
on Thursday November 21.<br />
While the Government has already done a lot to improve public<br />
responsiveness and performance we are hoping this conference will<br />
be a source of new ideas and new approaches.<br />
It is very definitely a working conference aimed at practical<br />
results. </p>
