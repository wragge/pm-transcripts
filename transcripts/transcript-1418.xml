PRESIDENT JOHNSON'S VISIT TO AUSTRALIA 1966-<br />
LUNCHEON AT PARLIAMENT HOUSE,<br />
CANBERRA<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, Mr. Harold Holt 21ST OCTOBER, 1966<br />
Mr. President and Mrs. Johnson, Honourable Premiers, Ministerial<br />
Colleagues, Your Excellencies, Parliamentary Colleagues, Ladies and<br />
Gentlemen Yesterday I was privileged to express on behalf of the<br />
Government and people of Australia a warm welcome to our distinguished<br />
visitors, the President and Mrs. Johnson. Today we bring to that welcome<br />
the National Parliament of Australia and those distinguished guests who are<br />
here with us. And joining together in expressing that welcome are the<br />
Leaders of the three principal parties represented in the Parliament.<br />
Government and Opposition may differ on many things but<br />
this is one of those occasions, too rare perhaps, but welcome when it comes,<br />
when we can unite in harmonious agreement as to the subject of our discussion.<br />
You will find, Mr. President, as you travel throughout Australia that the<br />
warmth of welcome I have expressed is echoed and reaffirmed wherever you<br />
travel in this country. The first visit of an American President to Australia could not<br />
fail to be an auspicious occasion, a distinctive occasion, and also a happy<br />
occasion. A happy occasion because our two countries have enjoyed a close<br />
friendship for many years, a friendship which radiates throughout both our<br />
communities as I have discovered wherever I have travelled in your own.<br />
Arid I know that Americans coming either as visitors or to stay in Australia<br />
for short or long periods find themselves quickly on a wavelength with us<br />
and speak in warm and even affectionate terms about us, and this is as it<br />
should be. And it is not surprising that this should be so because we are<br />
inheritors in common of so much, as I am sure you will agree, Mr. President.<br />
Eve n in the words of the grace which I uttered earlier this<br />
afternoon, you get an expression of our common devotion to liberty, to freedom,<br />
to independence in our own communities and an urge to help others obtain and<br />
secure and maintain the independence to which they aspire.<br />
We have a common language. We don't always speak it in<br />
the same manner, but the differences that are discoverable between us, I<br />
think are less than some of the differences we discover in our own community.<br />
We are just saying farewell, Sir, here to one Member of the Parliament who<br />
didn't speak very often. It was said he didn't do so because he required an<br />
interpreter when he did. He is a Scotsman'. But he proved the other night<br />
when we had a farewell function to our retiring Parliamentarians that when he<br />
needed to speak, he could speak to very great effect indeed and was very<br />
clearly understood by all.<br />
And this is so of the American people. I don't know how hard<br />
they find it to follow the Australian accent, as we perpetrate it from time to<br />
time, but we get the message from you when we hear your compatriots in<br />
their speech to us. And what a wonderful tradition it is and inheritance it is<br />
to have this common language, we together admiring the language of<br />
Shakespeare and together able to absorb something of the wisdom of a<br />
Benjamin Franklin, a Jefferson or the stirring sentiments and philosophic<br />
depth of an Abraham Lincoln. This is part of our common heritage. ./ 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
You and we have drawn heavily upon the p olitical experience of the Mother<br />
of Parliaments at Westminster. Our Parliament more closely resembles it<br />
than does yours. The founders of your Constitution were troubled by the<br />
danger that too much power might reside in one area of government and so by<br />
a process of checks and balances you set out to try to balance executive with<br />
judiciary and with Parliament, but in the result, such is the pressure of<br />
modern circumstance, you have produced in the United States the most<br />
powerful executive in the history of mankind.<br />
And you, Sir, have that awesome responsibility in the world of today.<br />
Sometimes, no doubt, a lonely responsibility, but at all times a responsibility<br />
which weighs heavily upon you. Those of us who have watched and come to<br />
admire your tenure of the office of President have realised with what earnestness,<br />
with what sentiment and feeling and intensity you concern yourself<br />
with the problems of your office. We have marvelled at your skill in<br />
achieving through the Parliament of your own country, although you don't<br />
have the direct com mand of it that a Prime Minister with an assured majority<br />
can exercise in the United Kingdom or in this country, but despite that<br />
difficulty you have succeeded in having adopted by the United S13tates Congress,<br />
I think a higher proportion of bills that you have proposed to the Congress<br />
than any President before you in history. That is a remarkable achievement<br />
in itself. But we are not merely friends, we are allies as well. You are the<br />
powerful ally, we are a staunch ally, I hope at all times. And we in<br />
Australia have a full recognition that the security of this country depends<br />
tremendously upon our treaty arrangements with you under ANZUS and under<br />
SEATO. If I may say so, Mr. President, it is under our ANZUS arrange<br />
ments we feel our greatest security lies, and Australia has not forgotten<br />
those anxious periods in the second world war when we ye re closer to invasion<br />
by an enemy than ever before in our history, and the Battle of the Coral Sea<br />
was fought which was the foundation of our subsequent safety and security,<br />
and this then led on to the great campaign under your distinguished General<br />
Douglas MacArthur. This diningroomn of ours has honoured many distinguished visitors<br />
monarchs, statesmen, soldiers but this occasion marks one of the most<br />
distinguished and notable in the whole history of the Australian Parliament.<br />
For us, Sir, this is an occasion in which we honour you and we honour that<br />
wonderful woman who has been such a helpmate to you throughout your long<br />
political career. Mrs. Johnson is welcomed in herself. This tour will be<br />
a great success not merely by virtue of the high office you enjoy but because<br />
Australia will like you and does like you both as very human and lovable<br />
people. You, Mr. President, don't want to go down in history as a warrior<br />
President I think I can say that from the knowledge that I have gained of<br />
you since we first came in touch with each other. You were kind enough,<br />
from the time I took office to assure me that you wished the close and<br />
intimate contact that had been developed between my predecessor and<br />
yourself to continue. I am glad to say that I was also accorded this privilege<br />
by the Prime Minister of Great Britain. Then there have been our personal<br />
meetings. And I have learned through these things that you have an<br />
aspiration which is not a military aspiration, not that of a warrior. You<br />
bring to mind what I remember being taught in my schooldays that "' peace<br />
hath her victories lio less renowned than that of war". You are devoting<br />
yourself to great victories of peace for the future. You have an aspiration / 3 </p>
<p>3-<br />
for a great society in your own country, you have an aspiration for a better<br />
world order in other parts of the world for security for peoples, their<br />
independence. -You want to see their standards of life improve, their<br />
life expectancy improve, hope to dispel the despair that has afflicted<br />
countless millions of the world's population down through the ages. This<br />
has brought you to study the Asian scene where more than half of humanity<br />
resides and which will grow in population even more rapidly than the<br />
remainder of the world. You know there is a short life expectancy, a low<br />
per capita income and you feel with all the power that flows from a country,<br />
which in a relatively short time counted in human history has built up<br />
so enormously its economic strength and power, that you can bring that<br />
strength and power, the techniques you have developed and often pioneered<br />
to the assistance of a needy world.<br />
And we in Australia feel that in Asia at any rate there is a part<br />
for us to play with you as well, and you have encouraged us in that belief.<br />
Now, we are going together to the conference in Manila and we are<br />
striving there to restore peace to a troubled area of the world and we are<br />
striving there also to lay the foundations of that better world to which you<br />
aspire. There is much that an Australian cculd myon such an occasion its<br />
tWe, but we want to hear from you, not the three Australian political<br />
leaders, and I have certainly spoken as long as I should on these matters.<br />
But I have wanted to bring home to you that there is admiration and affection<br />
for you in this country, both as the representative of a friendly country with<br />
whom our destiny has been bound through many conflicts df war -Dd tiany<br />
tasks of peace. We see our destinies being linked together for as long as<br />
our two countries survive and we see importance in the strength of<br />
friendship and the closeness of our alliance.<br />
Because you are so forcefully devoted to these great objectives<br />
we welcome you and we honour you.<br />
And now I ask my colleague, the Deputy Prime Minister, if he<br />
will join me and support me in the toast which I propose to offer and I shall<br />
then invite the Leader of Her Majesty's Opposition to join also in conveying<br />
a warmth of welcome to our distinguished guests. </p>
