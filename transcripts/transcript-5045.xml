PRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT 10 MAY 1979<br />
PRIME MINISTER: RETURN DINNER FOR PRESIDENT MARCOS<br />
MIA NIL A<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Tonight is nearing the end of a very friendly and a very happy<br />
visit to Manila. I would like to thank you again, Mr. President,,<br />
for the great warmth of hospitality that has been shown to me<br />
and my party, my colleague Mr. Garland, while we have been here<br />
over the last two or three days.<br />
This has now developed into a very great city, one of the great<br />
cities of the world and it must surely have the greatest<br />
conference theatre anywhere in the world, I certainly haven't seen<br />
such a magnificent auditorium. All. this indicates great<br />
foresight, great initiative of those who have been responsible<br />
for the development of this city. I am sure that if there were<br />
only time I would see the same marked development and improvement<br />
throughout the Philippines.<br />
Mr. President, I know that the last few days have surely been<br />
very busy ones for you. When a Head of Government comes to<br />
Australia I worry about his programme and is he going to be<br />
happy, are the talks going to be constructive and is everything<br />
being done properly. But you haven't had just one Head of<br />
Government, you have two Prime Ministers in the city at this<br />
moment and you have one of the great United Nations Conferences<br />
throughout the whole month. I am well aware of the demands that must<br />
be placed on your time and on Madame Marcos' time, and all the<br />
more reason therefore for thanking you for the invitation to be<br />
here on a State Visit during this particular, very busy week.<br />
Manila has certainly become the centre of much world attention<br />
over the last few days and throughout the UNCTAD Conference.<br />
We have spoken of the Common Fund and significant progress has<br />
been made in that. I have said in other forums that much of what<br />
has been achieved is because of the foresight that you have shown,,<br />
Mr. President, in the origins of the scheme for the Common Fund.<br />
Agreement on main principles and on many details has now been<br />
reached. As I indicated yesterday, it remains to work out the<br />
indicated programmes to make sure we don't sit still, 3 that we<br />
a~-e not complacent, we are not content with what has been<br />
a~ chieved. We need that drive forward to achieve more, to advance,<br />
toY build-on what we have done and n-ot regres . s and become content<br />
because there is so much yet that remains to be done.<br />
Mr. President, in the bilateral discussions that we have had,<br />
I believe the more than two hours of talks yesterday morning<br />
xiere amongst the most constructive that I have ever been involved in.<br />
14t~ covered a very wide range of topics and the communique which<br />
w~ ill be issued tomorrow will ' icate some part of that. But the<br />
./ 2 </p>
<p>.2<br />
communique can' t indicate the frank, the plain way that we<br />
were able to converse and to exchange views on ma ' ny matters of<br />
great importance to your country, Mr. President and to mine<br />
and indeed to ASEAN and the whole South East Asian region.<br />
I think the way we were able to talk on the wider international<br />
issues and at the samne time on bilateral matters, was a mark<br />
of understanding between us a mark of the respect certainly<br />
which I hold for you and for the Philippines and recognition<br />
also that all our fates in this part of the world are bound<br />
very closely together. What happens in the countries of ASEAN<br />
very greatly affects Australia and what we all want peace,<br />
security, time to build up the living standards of the peoples<br />
of the region, is something which is dear to the hearts of all<br />
of us and we all want to achieve.<br />
The talks were a mark, I believe,, of the kind of exchange that<br />
can only occur between friends and neighbours and I thank<br />
you, Mr. President, for the quality of those talks. I believe<br />
they do establish, have established, a basis for a new period<br />
in the development of relations between the Philippines and<br />
Australia. I think tomorrow the decisions we have made, that the<br />
announcement of one or two matters that have been set aside in<br />
the past years, but now we are going to consumate. In a small<br />
ceremony tomorrow, we will seal the basis of that and enable us<br />
to build on the relationship between your country, Mr. President,<br />
and mine. 000---</p>
