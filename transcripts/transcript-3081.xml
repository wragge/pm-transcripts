EMBARGO: 7.30 PM FRIDAY 23 NOV. 1973<br />
NATIONAL BROADCAST BY THE PRIME MINISTER, MR E. G. WHITLAM, M. P.,<br />
FOR THE ELECTIONS OF THE NATIONAL ABORIGINAL CONSULTATIVE COMMITTEE<br />
TELECAST 8.00 PM, 23 NOVEMBER 1973<br />
Tonight I want to speak directly and personally to the<br />
Aboriginal people of Australia. I take great pleasure in doing so.<br />
This is the first time that an Australian Prime Minister has<br />
addressed himself on radio and television to our Aboriginal people.<br />
I certainly hope it will not be the last time, and that what I<br />
have to say tonight will be heard by all Australians with a concern<br />
for the welfare and progress of our country and its reputation<br />
in the world. I want to tell you of a most important election that is<br />
taking place tomorrow. Nothing like it has been held before.<br />
All Aboriginal people in Australia are eligible to vote. You will<br />
be voting to elect the members of the National Aboriginal<br />
Consultative Committee. This committee the IJ. A. C. C. will have<br />
a significant role to play in advancing the cause of Aborigines<br />
and Torres Strait Island Australians. I hope all Aboriginals will<br />
exercise their right and duty to take part in this historic and<br />
democratic process.<br />
Let me explain how the Consultative Committee was set up<br />
and what the Government wants it to achieve. You may recall<br />
that in my policy speech last November I said that A~ boriginals<br />
had for too long been denied their rightful place in Australian<br />
society and that all Australians were diminished while this was<br />
SO. Since taking office we have done much to restore the dignity<br />
and opportunities of Aboriginals. We have embarked on many<br />
important reforms in education, health and vocational training.<br />
W~ e are pledged to end racial discrimination, and we shall soon<br />
be introducing legislation for this purpose. We have appointed<br />
a commission to determine the best way to grant land rights to<br />
the Aboriginal people. In accordance with the clear wish of the<br />
people expressed in the referendum of 1967, the Australian Government<br />
is moving to assume full responsibility from the States fo~ r the<br />
administration of Aboriginal affairs.<br />
Many of the things we want to do are quite new when<br />
compared with the old assimilation policies of the past. We want<br />
to preserve the culture of the Aboriginal people their tribal<br />
values such as music, languages and beliefs. We regard that as<br />
our sacred trust. / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
Our most important objective now is to restore to<br />
Aboriginals the power to make their own decisions about their<br />
way of life. Already the Department of Aboriginal Affairs has<br />
been transferring responsibility for community affairs from<br />
Government superintendents and managers to Aboriginals themselves.<br />
We believe the establishment of the National Aboriginal Consultative<br />
Committee is an important part of this process. We want the<br />
committee to be a forum for the expression of Aboriginal opinion.<br />
We want it to allow a healthy two-way communication between<br />
Aboriginals and the national Government.<br />
Let me give you a few details about * the voting tomorrow.<br />
You will be electing 41 delegates from a field of 193 candidates<br />
who have nominated throughout Australia. The elected delegates<br />
will be paid a salary and allowance, and we expect the committee<br />
to meet two or three times a year. Already nearly 37,000 people<br />
have L~ nrolled to vote. Mut let mie rettind youu that even if you<br />
have not yet enrolled, you will still bci pcrmi-ittei to enrol<br />
and vote at the polling booths tomorrow. For those in isolated<br />
communities voting has been going on since last Saturday and will<br />
continue for another week.<br />
I am confident that this committee will work well and<br />
achieve much. I hope all Aboriginals will seize this opportunity<br />
to participate in its election. I should like to remind you of<br />
some words I used earlier this year when I spoke to a meeting of<br />
Aboriginal people in Canberra. I said this and the words<br />
still apply " If there is one ambition my Government places above<br />
all others, if there is one achievement for which I<br />
hope we will be remembered, if there is one cause for<br />
which future historians will salute us, it is this:<br />
that the Government I lead removed a stain from our<br />
national honour and hrruqrht Ibac: Jo~ St ice and equality<br />
to the Aboriginal people."<br />
Good night. </p>
