ROYAL CONIAION74EALTH SOCIETY<br />
AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY BRANCH.<br />
INAUGIURAL DINNER<br />
HOTEL CANBERTA WEDNESDAY, 4TH FEBRUARY, 1959.<br />
THE PRESIDENT SIR ', rILLIANI DUNK, CJ3E NTECAR.<br />
SIR W7ILLIAM DUNK: Mr. Prime Minister, Dr. Evatt, Mr. Casey, Your<br />
Excei'lencies and Ladies and Gentlemen:<br />
It is not my purpose to make a speech tonight but I do want to<br />
speak for just a few minutes about the A. C. T. Branch of the Royal<br />
Commonwealth Society. First of al11 I would like to express the<br />
thanks of the council of the branch to all of you who attend this<br />
dinner tonight. It gives us the encouragement w~ e were looking for<br />
and we know now that we can go ahead with the assurance of the support<br />
of this most important cross-section of the community of the Territory.<br />
I ) am sure that you would want me to convey to the Prime Ministet'h<br />
to Dr. Evatt, Mr. Casey, Mr. Black, who is President of the<br />
Branch of the Society, aid to Sir Hot-ace Robertson, who is President<br />
of the Victorian Branch our pleasure that they have been able to<br />
accept our invitation to this function. Unfortunately His<br />
Excellency the High Commissioner fort the United Kingdom, Lord<br />
Carrington, and Lady Carrington andiHis Excellency the High Commissioner<br />
for India, Mr. Menon, and his wife have inescapable commitments<br />
for tonight and are unable to be present. They have asked me to<br />
conVey their apologies and I am sure that on our part we would<br />
express to them our sincere regret that they are unable to be with<br />
as. Dame Pattie Menzies as you may know, has recently acquired<br />
new family respcnsibilities and we would like you sir, to convey<br />
to Dame Pattie our congratulations on the acquisition of another<br />
grandchildi and express our regret at not having the pleasure of her<br />
company tonight.<br />
I would like to say a word about the work of the Branch and<br />
what we expect will be the pattern of its future work. lv'e hope<br />
through the years to develop a programme which will, through addresses;<br />
through film medium ana other means bring closer to us all the<br />
countries of the Commonwealth and increase our understanding of them<br />
and their ways of life. It's a po.! nt on which we are assured we will<br />
have the support and help of the Missions of the Commonwealth countries<br />
in Canberra. Additionally we would hope that we would be able to<br />
arrange for members to meet here visiting people of importance in<br />
the Commonwealth. The first of those will probably be Sir Gilbert<br />
Laithwaite who, as you know, is Permanent Secretary of the Commonwealth<br />
Relations Office in London, and we hope to arrange a reception for<br />
members of the Society for him early-next month. I hope that other<br />
speakers will touch on the Commonwealth in its present relationships.<br />
Its future will rest very largely on the statesmanship of its<br />
leaders, on the skill of its diplomats, but much as I think this to </p>
<p>ao**@ 0 </p>
<p>2.<br />
be true statesmanship and diplomacy is not enough of itself;<br />
underneath it as a foundati'Lon we must have the gooG" homely touch<br />
of frienciliness andi kindily unoerstanding. Now that to me is the<br />
main purpose of this Society and to the extent to which we can<br />
foster it we are improving the cohesion of the Commonwealth andi we<br />
are giving the statesmen something on which to build, something<br />
on which the Commonwealth will grow. That is the task, the<br />
signature tune if you like, of the Canberra Branch and I would like<br />
to think of it that way.<br />
It's my privrilege tonight to introduce the toast of the Royal<br />
Commonwealth Society. The Prime Mtinister, Dr. Evatt, and Mr.<br />
Casey have generously agreed to speak to it. Ladies and<br />
gentlemen, the Prime Minister.<br />
THE PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Sir, this is a very remarkable occasion for Dr. Evatt an'<br />
Mr. Casey and myself because we are supporting Sir !,, illiam Dunk.<br />
( laugh ter). As a rule, in our various experiences we do our<br />
best to get a little support from him, But tonight he has<br />
reversed the process. Now I have had a look, not at the clock<br />
but at my watch anda I have looked at the programme and 1 realise<br />
that you are now going to have six speeches of an average length<br />
of 91, minutes each. And I am bound to say as one of the<br />
speakers that I find it most satisfactory. But if I might begin<br />
with a discordant note there are one or two people here tonight<br />
who in other fields of activity advise me and one of them is a<br />
great expert on flags. And rightly or wrongly because I would not<br />
know, honestly, I wouldn't know, rightly or wrongly, he tells me<br />
that the Union Jack is upside down. ( laughter). Which I am<br />
also told is a signal of distress. And, therefore, sir, it is<br />
perhaps very appropriate that you should have got the better of<br />
this ill-omen in advance by having us come here together to a<br />
dinner of the Royal Commonwealth Society which continues to show<br />
that SO far from the Union Jack being a signal of distress it is a<br />
signal of the most remarkable community of peoples and of the<br />
greatest hopes for the future. ( Applause).<br />
I suppose, sir, that there is no more remarkable stor-y: in<br />
this century: a century which is otherwise disfigured by many evil<br />
and indeed horrible events, there is no more remarkable process<br />
in this century than that by which, to Put it in the Particular,<br />
the Royal Colonial Institute became the Royal Empire Society and<br />
later the Royal Commonwealth Society; colonies became selfgoverning<br />
colonies, taen became inaependent member countries Of<br />
the Commonwealth, 9 and in one or two cases ceased to be in the<br />
Commonwealth but became self-governing countries with all their<br />
hopes for the future. I am not at all sure that in a centuj'y </p>
<p>S </p>
<p>in which the home of the race of most of us has been La~ ttered<br />
and almost broken from time to time, I am not at all sure that<br />
the most remarkable thing has not been this superb process by<br />
which people have moved from dependence to independence and<br />
have remained bound together by friendship and by ties that<br />
are not easy to define, but certainly not easy to break. As<br />
Dr. Evatt will remember, there was a greatly celebrated legal<br />
historian who once described the history of one of the processes<br />
of the law as the history of the development from status to<br />
contract, and without being too technical the whole point that<br />
he was making was that some centuries ago peoples' rights<br />
depended upon whiere taey were born, how they were born, what<br />
dues they owed to other people and if you wanted to determine<br />
their rig.-hts you asked# " what is his status, what is her status",<br />
and as time went on people moved away from that into the era of<br />
contr'act in which free people uninhibited by status governed their<br />
lives by free bargains they made one with another. And here<br />
we have a perfect analogy. I remember well before the war going<br />
to a Conference. I was not a Prime Piinister then. 1confess I<br />
was later on and they found me out. But I mean that this<br />
time I was not the Prime Minister but I went to what was then<br />
called an Imperial Conference representing my then Prime<br />
Minister and at that time there were as few people, as few<br />
nations, at the table at No. 10, and beyona those and well outside<br />
of them there were literally hundreds of millions of people<br />
who were not speaking for themselves but byi' others. And in<br />
this short period of time of a quarter of a century later I now<br />
find myself walking into the same room and meeting on equal<br />
terms the representatives of India and Pakistan and Ceylon,<br />
the representatives of Ghana and before so long the representatives<br />
of the *. Test Indies this is a very, Nery remarkable experience.<br />
A-nd if we are to ask the reason for it, it is this we have not<br />
been afraid of the consequences of our own policy. The whole<br />
genius of British ccionialism, if I may say so this rude word<br />
" 1colonialism", the whole genius of it was that people should<br />
come to govern themselves, to become t. : eir own nation anc their<br />
own people,. an(-what has happenei in the last 25 years is the<br />
clearest proof of it. I am not one of those who tnink that it<br />
has not been revolutionary because in some cases it has. This<br />
is a Royal Commonwealth Society but the relationships of<br />
Australia and the Crown anci the people of Aiustralia with the Crown<br />
are not precisely the same as the relationships between, say,<br />
the people of India and the Crown because while we all acknowledge<br />
the Queen as the head of the Commonwealth some of us have the<br />
Queen in our own country in the processes of our own law, while<br />
others have felt it necessary from their own point of view to<br />
have become republics and, therefore, this is in a sense </p>
<p>S e </p>
<p>4.<br />
a revolutionary movement. But in everything that matters it<br />
is a movement of an evolutionary kind, because, if you look<br />
and see what has happened in the countries which are now<br />
independent, proud, free, imembers of the Commonwealth, what<br />
do you find you find within them a respect for the law and<br />
its administration which I venture to assert is one of the<br />
greatest gifts of Great Britain to the world. You find in them<br />
a belief in Parliamentary self government, in true d; zmocracy,<br />
in the right to rule yourselves by your own chosen people<br />
which again has been the great contribution of Great Britain<br />
to the world. You find two other things, and this goes for<br />
every country represented here tonight. You find first of all<br />
no spirit of aggression it is a very proud thing to be able to<br />
say in a rather nervous world; in a world that is wracked by<br />
divisions; in a worlc that wakens up occasionally with fear and<br />
goes to bed with fear; it is a wonderful thing to be able to say<br />
with no reservation that there is no country in the Commonwealth<br />
which offers a threat of aggression to any other country in the<br />
world. Here is a great common element, an element which has<br />
moved through the whole of our joint history from the time when<br />
Great Britain herself was the greatest colonial power in the<br />
world. And finally, sir, because I remember my own rule<br />
people will occasionally say to me what is the aifference<br />
between sitting in a Conference with what we would call<br />
foreign countries under some friendly arrangement of alliance and<br />
sitting at No. 10 Downing Street or wherever it may be with the<br />
representatives of 9 or 10 countries of the Conmmonwealth. And<br />
the answer to me, who am now almost an old hand in these matters,<br />
is quite simple we have, whatever our, differences might be<br />
whatever the distinction between our cultural history, one from<br />
the other whatever cifferences we may have on current politics<br />
or affairs, we sit down together in a spirit of companionship.<br />
We are friends. 1e understand each other; we can speak our minds<br />
to each other. But we come out of our conference still as<br />
friencs, still as companions, s till as members of the greatest<br />
Commonwealth the worlk has ever seen. And, Sir, it is because<br />
those things are so true ane sometimes so overlooked that I<br />
give myself the enormous pleasure tonight of supporting with you<br />
the toast of the Royal Commonwealth Society, and as I propose<br />
it ana as you listen to me proposing it you will know, as I<br />
know, that we are thinking not of our differences which are small<br />
but of our unities which are enormous anL as I believe, immortal.<br />
SIR W., ILLIA DUNK:<br />
Thank you sir. Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Evatt. </p>
<p>DR. H. V. EVATT:<br />
Mr. Prime Minister, Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen.<br />
It is a great honour to support this toast<br />
and I think that the Prime h; inister has adopted the correct<br />
and philosophical approach to this problem not so much by<br />
speaking of the successful work of the fociety which under the<br />
difference of names has been continued by your resolution, but<br />
in the story that lies behind the Commonwealth; because if<br />
lectures are given, as they will be given in the Society and<br />
its various branches, about conditions throughout the Commonwealth<br />
and elsewhere, there is nothing more important than an<br />
understanding such as the Prime Minister has depicted of the<br />
nature of the Commonwealth itself and also, if I may say so,<br />
of the men who helped to builo it, because it is not the work<br />
of a few years. Great men have put their minus together to<br />
create the Commonwealth, the British Commonwealth of Nations<br />
it was called. It is called the Commonwealth today but its<br />
association with Britain is close. Indeed Her Miajesty the<br />
Queen is the head of the Commonwealth and of course the Queen<br />
occupies an even closer relationship with some of the<br />
members of the Commonwealth. But just think of some of the<br />
men of the Commonwealth. Take your m. nds back to the first<br />
world war anc the settlement of that war. At that time,<br />
Australia, like Canada and New Zealand and South Africa,<br />
was a self-governing Dominion; it was not recognized<br />
as an independent State or a State with independent rights<br />
throughout the world, but at the conclusion of that war<br />
efforts made by the Prime Minister of Canada, Borden, by the<br />
Prime Minister of Australia, W. M. Hughes, by the two leaders<br />
of South Africa, the then leaders of South Africa, Botha and<br />
Smuts and by others, resulted in the self-governing dominions<br />
becoming signatories to the Treaty of Peace itself an<br />
extraordinary and enormous development. But the matter<br />
having been taken that far, these nations given by Britain<br />
the right of self government in local affairs, wvre determined<br />
to have similar rights in international and external affairs<br />
and those rights were not given reluctantly but given freely.<br />
And so you come to the new perioc, some 8 or 9 years after the<br />
war, when what is called the Balfour Declaration was made and the<br />
dominion status was then defined as indicating something<br />
belonging to the self-governing dominions which gave them<br />
equality of status with the Mother Country herself, equality<br />
of status with inequality or differences of function. And<br />
that period was gone through. The Statute of / estminster<br />
was drafted which removed all technical legal obstacles in the<br />
way of self-government in internal or indeed in external<br />
affairs being exercised. </p>
<p>So you had the Stattteof Westminster passed in various parts<br />
of the Dominions. ;. nu then in the Seconc l'orlo ' Jar it showed<br />
further developments of the character I have mentioned and the<br />
Commonwealth of Nations developed from the British Commonwealth<br />
of Nations. I think it is right always to remember that it<br />
was and is, British in origin, not only because of the<br />
association of the Queen but because the whole conception<br />
dates from the Balfour Declaration and is really one of the<br />
greatest triumphs of the British contriLution to civilization<br />
and democracy throughout the world. Then, of course, there<br />
have been further developments.<br />
There has been the emergence the Prime Minister<br />
inoicatec, of new members of the Commonwealth, not only the<br />
old Commonwealth, so to speak, of the United Kingdom, Canada,<br />
Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, but new members of it,<br />
such as India and Pakistan and Ceylon; ana now nations such<br />
as Malaya, Ghana ancd no coutt the west Inuics, ana the list<br />
is by no means complete. Anc there are differences and<br />
cifficulties throughout the Commonwealth which arise from<br />
time to time; uifferences, acute cifferences, in internal<br />
affairs anc. quite a few differences in international affairs.<br />
But what of it 1 As the Prime Minister says, the Conference<br />
takes place, there is an exchange of views, and whatever the<br />
members of the Commonwealth do about it, they don't fight<br />
about it, they consult about it and they indicate an example<br />
which could well be followed by the United Nations itself.<br />
The conferences are completed and they all go about their work<br />
it is a noble conception. I don't think there are any limits to<br />
the possibilities of the British Commonwealth of Nations, so<br />
long as we remember what its objelctives are. Its objectives<br />
are, of course, the advancement of the members, also the<br />
advancement of cemocracy throughout the worl and the welfare<br />
of all peoples. It is the same objective in essence as the<br />
United Nations. It is the parallel boy. .' hen Ghana came into<br />
the Commonwealth, Ghana was almost simultaneously admitted as a<br />
member of the United Nations anc they hac the uouble status<br />
there. Similarly with r:. alaya, and it will go on. And I<br />
want to see the Commonwealth supported and I know it will be<br />
supported in Australia an not merely by the Government but by<br />
all peoples, by all political parties and all the people of<br />
Australia. Good luck to the Society for continuing in this<br />
way and congratulations to you, Mr. Chairman, on your initiative<br />
in getting this movement started. </p>
<p>MR. CASEY. When I received an invitation from the Chairman to<br />
attend this inaugural function of the Australian Capital<br />
Territory Branch of the Royal Commonwealth Society, I was<br />
very pleased it was a very tactful letter, a very pleasantly<br />
worded letter. As sometimes happens, the sting was in the<br />
tail, because after having said all the nice things that Sir<br />
William Dunk is frequently, but not always able to say<br />
( laughter) he then got on to the question of the time during<br />
which I was supposed to speak ane he tolu me that, as he did not<br />
have any intention whatsoever of putting any limitation on<br />
the time for which I woul speak, he woulu hope an6 believe that<br />
I woulu fine myself able to say what I had to say within a<br />
period of 10 minutes. ( laughter). And I have got some<br />
reason to believe that he put something in the way of a limit,<br />
the same very tactful time limit on Dr. Evatt. The Prime<br />
Minister, may-be through his Office, was given the run of the<br />
tide but I noticed when I put the clock both on the Prime<br />
Minister and on Dr. Lvatt, the Prime Minister spoke for<br />
minutes and Dr. Evatt for 10 minutes so I would expect that<br />
the whole thing has adopted a certain pattern at the instance<br />
of Sir illian Dunk and quite rightly too. It reminds me of<br />
a short time ago in Sydney when I was speaking at a luncheon<br />
gathering and in rather polemical fashion I asked the chairman<br />
how long he wished me to speak and he said, very genially that<br />
I could speak for as long as I pleased, but adcded, " Of course,<br />
we have to go at 2 o'clock". ( laughter). Well, Mr. Chairman<br />
we are here tonight, a great many of us, a very great gathering,<br />
I think one of the largest gatherings I remember attending in<br />
Canberra, to pay our small parts in the launching of the<br />
Australian Capital Territory Branch of the Royal Commonwealth<br />
Society. And it is very right and proper, I woulc believe<br />
myself, and I think you woulo all believe, that there should be<br />
a branch of this old, traditional ano famous Society in its various<br />
phases here in Canberra, the Seat of Government in<br />
Australia. Because here in Canberra as uistinct from the<br />
other capital cities in the States of Australia, you have the<br />
High Commissioners of all the component parts of the Commonwealth;<br />
indeed I think it is very right and proper and appropriate that<br />
t.. is place Canberra shoulc be the seat of what I would hope<br />
would in uue course be, the major boc. y of the Royal Commonwealth<br />
Society because here shoul( be and I think one can say there is,<br />
the inspiration as far as Australia is concerned. This is<br />
the capital of Australia; here is the diplomacy, here should be<br />
I think the ideas that should radiate out on behalf of<br />
Australia to all parts of this Commonwealth so far as Australia </p>
<p>is concerned, and I would hope and expect that this Branch<br />
in Canberra woulc become a powerful Branch, would take the<br />
initiative in this business of binding and holuing this<br />
Commonwealth together. As the Prime Minister has rightly<br />
reminded us the Royal Com: nonwe( lth Society is under a year<br />
old. Thirty years ago the Royal Empire Cociety was founded,<br />
and I think it was 70 or 80 years ago that all this business<br />
had its beginnings in the Ro/ al Colonial Institute; each<br />
one of those three names, titles, reflecting the state of<br />
affairs ane the composition of this curiously proclaimed association<br />
of countries that we now call the Commonwealth of<br />
Nations. An so far as Australia is concerned, I think<br />
there is probably no man more auvanced in the matter than Mr.<br />
Daniell, the Secretary of the Sydney Branch anc, I would<br />
expect, his Chairman, Mr. Black. Those two men, I uneerstand,<br />
fought a fairly lonely battle a few years ago in an effort<br />
to have the name changed from the Royal Empire Society, which<br />
had become in the effluxion of time a rather outmoded description,<br />
a description that was not agreeable by any means to all the<br />
present cay members of the Commonwealth. Mr. Daniell I<br />
remember, netted me in for a gathering in Melbourne of the<br />
Royal Empire Society as it then was. I had myself fairly<br />
strong ideas that the old name Royal Empire Society had become<br />
an outmoded name. It was as I say disagreeable by reason of<br />
its assumed connection to some of the newer members of the<br />
Commonwealth, and so I went to this gathering and I saw Sir<br />
Charles Ponsonby a figure and a man of consequence whom I<br />
believea in my mine was probably allergic to these new, modern<br />
names. So I moistened my lips anc, thought frightfully hard<br />
anc got up and maae a speech for the change in mame, expecting<br />
to be cut in half by this rather formiCable old gentleman from<br />
Loncon. But that dian't happen and I may have had some hand<br />
in the changing, in cue course, of the name from Royal Empire<br />
Society to the I. oyal Commonwealth Society. But in the course<br />
of that, over a perio of twelve months, I received a considerable<br />
number of insulting letters and I was callec a Communist<br />
and all sorts of things by those people who had, understandably,<br />
very nostalgic feelings for the old name which had become enshrined<br />
in men's hearts anc minds. I asked Mr. Daniell as to his<br />
experience and he said he was called something worse than a<br />
Communist and he and I were brandeu as people that other<br />
decent people didnot really go along with at all. Anyhow<br />
logic had its way in the end and it became the Royal<br />
Commonwealth Society and here it is. Now without taking up<br />
much more time-I am watching the clock and Sir William Dunk<br />
in the first war I was connected with Sir Thomas Blamey who was<br />
then Colonel Blamey anc v'hen I used to growl about things to<br />
him he inevitably used to sayto me " well all right, what </p>
<p>are you going to do about And I have tried to remember<br />
what he said and what he meant on a number of subsequent<br />
occasions. And I just say to myself, well here we all are<br />
in this room at the inauguration of the . oyal Commonwealth<br />
Society in Canberra and what are we going to do about it.<br />
I think there is a lot to be done about it. There is a lot<br />
of linking still to be done in this Commonwealth things are<br />
not all rosy in the Commonwealth, there is still a lot of<br />
linking, liaison work, and getting together to be done and I<br />
think probably this Branch in Canberra is the one to take the<br />
lead with the other branches in trying to do some of these<br />
things. I think the links between each one of us, the<br />
component parts oi the Commonwealth anc the United Kingdom,<br />
are all pretty good but I think myself that the links between<br />
the other members, between Australia and Canada even you might<br />
say Australia and New Zealand, Australia and f'ialaya, Australia<br />
and all the other component parts, those are the things that<br />
need to be strengthened. They are not easy to strengthen.<br />
I ask myself how that can be cone in actual practice. One<br />
of the ways it can be done is by direct press representation<br />
between the various component parts of the Coimmfonwealth which<br />
is much more lacking than the average person would tend to<br />
believe and I believe that is probably, or I would think it is<br />
prcbably, the most important single thing that could be done,<br />
if that could be achieved. If the great ' ress barons of this<br />
country and their opposite numbers in other parts of the<br />
Commonwealth could be incuced to have direct press representation<br />
between the various component parts, then I think a great, a<br />
considerable step forward would be made towards the further<br />
linking up of the component parts of this Commonwealth. Now,<br />
Mr. Chairman, I will say very little more because I think I am<br />
just about on the 9th minute, although there is a vast % eal<br />
more to say. The Prime Minister gave; as he al', ays coes, an<br />
inspired acdress as to the origin anc the history and the<br />
importance of the work of the maintenance and the strengthening<br />
of this Cormnonwealth. 1r. Lvatt took it on another line but<br />
still maue, if I may say so, a most useful contribution. And<br />
as there are many people still to speak I don't want to speak . e<br />
much longer except to say, that I believe it is inherent in<br />
the hearts and minGs of all of us here tonight to do, each<br />
one of us indiviuually and as a Society, everything that can<br />
be possibly done to keep this grand conception of the Royal<br />
Commonwealth Society and of this Commonwealth in being and<br />
growing for the future anc for myself, as one of the sponsors<br />
of this motion tonight, I would wish every good fortune and<br />
vigorous good fortune at that, to t,. is new and, I hope,<br />
powerful Branch of the Royal Commonwealth Society. </p>
<p>SIR WILLIAM DUNK.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen I give you the toast The Royal<br />
Commonwealth Society.<br />
SIR WILLI'AM DUNK. I would now ask the Deputy President of the<br />
Branch, Mr. Newman if he would be good enough to propose the<br />
toast to the visitors.<br />
MR. NE'JMAN. Mr. Chairman, Mr. Prime Minister, Your<br />
Excellencies, Ladies anu Gentlemen.<br />
Tonight it is my privilege, on behalf of the<br />
President and the members of the A. C. T. Branch of the<br />
Society, to extend a welcome to our guests. The programme<br />
inuicates that the next toast is that of the " visitors".<br />
I think there is a markee cifference quite a fundamental<br />
difference, between visitors anc guests, and I prefer to<br />
refer to you all tonight as the " guests" of the Society.<br />
Visitors may be welcome they may not for instance I may<br />
go home to lunch and say to my wife, " I had a visit from the<br />
bank manager this morning" quite a possibility and she<br />
might say " well I had a visit from the wireless inspector",<br />
and so on they're not welcome but as guests we do welcome<br />
you all to this inaugural function of the iustralian Capital<br />
Territory Branch of the Royal Commonwealth Society. I<br />
wish to refer, briefly, to a remark of the Prime Minister's<br />
when he spoke of the conferences he has attended at No.<br />
Downing Street, of representatives of the various Commonwealth<br />
countries and to the good that stems from such meetings.<br />
About 12 months ago, or a little more, it was my good<br />
fortune to attend a conference in London of the opposite<br />
numbers to myself in the other British Commonwealth countries,<br />
of which there were 10 represented at the Conference including<br />
Ghana we didn't meet at No. 10 Downing Street, but<br />
at the Commonwealth Relations Office just opposite,<br />
anG the good that flowed from r: eeting the representatives of<br />
those other countries; discussing their problems with them;<br />
realising what some of their cifficulties are and the<br />
fact that older countries like Britain, Canada and<br />
Australia coulc very materially help the younger Commonwealth<br />
countries in their problems, I found it very inspiring indeed,<br />
and it fired my enthusiasm for the fornnation of this Branch<br />
in the Australian Capital Territory. Since my return from<br />
England I have had a lot of corresponcence with the<br />
representatives of the other Commonwealth Countries and they<br />
have freely acknowledged the help we, in Australia, have </p>
<p>been able to give.<br />
Now tonight the toast is, as I say, that of our<br />
guests. The Chairman has already extenued a welcome to the<br />
Rt. Hon. the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon. Dr. H. V. Evatt and the<br />
Rt. Hon R. G. Casey, I would like to ace to that list, Mr.<br />
Ivan Black, the President of the Branch, and Lt.<br />
Gen. Sir Horace Robertson, President of the Victorian Branch.<br />
are also fortunate to have with us Mr. Rigby, the Chairman<br />
of the Council of the Branch and Mr. Daniell, the<br />
Secretary of the N. S. i. Branch to whom reference has already<br />
been made. In referring to those gentlemen I would like to<br />
express, on behalf of the A. C. T. Branch of the Society, the<br />
thanks we owe to them for the assistance they gave us in the<br />
formation of this Branch in Canberra. The way to go about<br />
forming a new Branch of the Society is rather unusual we<br />
were required to have 100 members of the Society residing in<br />
the area in which the new . ranch was to be formed. : ell we<br />
scouted arounu in Canberra anc found, I think, that we had 5 or<br />
6 members of the Society, but with the co-operation of Mr.<br />
Black and the branc.. we were able to enlist members<br />
in the A. C. T. and have them registered and enrolleu as members<br />
of the N. S. Wi. Branch. : hen we had our requisite number,<br />
something over 100, we made application for the Royal Charter,<br />
which was granted. A matter of the greatest importance<br />
to the A. C. T. Branch was that the New South : lales people were<br />
good enough to refund to us, all our nomination fees and<br />
all our subscriptions that Sir was a very fine gesture on<br />
their part anc one which we greatly appreciated. '! ithout that<br />
we really could not have got going. We have had a lot of<br />
assistance both from Victoria and from New South '! ales. Mr.<br />
Rigby and Mr. Daniell came to Canberra initially to help us<br />
when we held our first meeting with the idea of forming a<br />
Branch and we are very grateful for the assistance we have<br />
had from them. In welcoming the guests tonight, I cannot<br />
individualise amongst the many who have come along, but I<br />
would like to mention that we extend a special welcome to the<br />
Hon. Gordon Freeth, the new Minister for the Interior ( applause).<br />
As many of you know, Mr. Freeth is now a resicent of the<br />
A. C. T. and we are hopeful that after this meeting is over, or<br />
in the very near future, we will be enrolling him and Mrs.<br />
Freeth as members of this A. C. T. Branch.<br />
Ladies ant gentlemen, there is not much more I need<br />
say. It is very very gratifying to the Chairman, to myself<br />
and to the members of the Council to see such a wonderful<br />
attendance here tonight. The response from our own members </p>
<p>in bringing along guests has been really excellent; it gives<br />
us a lot of encouragement for the future and I would now ask<br />
those members of the A. C. T. Eranch of the Society if they<br />
would be good enough to rise and drink a toast to our guests.<br />
MR. NEVlMAN: Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, Mr. Ivan Black,<br />
Presicent of the Branch will respond to the<br />
toast and will be supported by Lt. Gen. Sir Horace Robertson,<br />
President of the Victorian Branch.<br />
MR. IVAN BLCK. M. L. A.<br />
Mr. President, Mr. Prime Yinister, Dr. Evatt,<br />
Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen:<br />
May I thank you all most warmly on behalf of the<br />
visitors or should I better say for the very warm way in<br />
which you have honoured the toast proposed in such kindly<br />
fashion by Mr. Newman who sits on my left. I am particularly<br />
grateful to Mr. Newman for making some reference to the part<br />
played by the N. S. V.. Rranch in the formation of this Australian<br />
Capital Territory Branch and I am most grateful to Mr. Newman<br />
for referring to the work done by the Chairman of my Council, Mr.<br />
Alex. Rigby and the Secretary of the Branch, Mr. Daniell.<br />
I must admit quite frankly that although I was most enthusiastic<br />
about the formation of this Branch, for reasons which were not<br />
within my control the spade work was done by those two<br />
gentlemen, and I want to take this opportunity of paying my<br />
tribute to them. Now I know that all the guests here tonight<br />
will be as delightd as I am that a Branch has been formed in<br />
the National Capital of Australia. Y/ e have the headquarters<br />
of the Society in the capital of the United Kingdom, we have<br />
Branches in Ottawa and in ellington, but it is a matter I<br />
think of some regret that it is only now that in the National<br />
Capital of this third senior nation within the Commonwealth<br />
we have been cble to form a Branch.<br />
However, this inaugural dinner has been a splencid<br />
function. The splendid speeches too have maintained a fair<br />
average, and I assure you that if it is up to about<br />
minutes I will be bowled very early in my innings anc reduce<br />
the average back to the 9 ! which was referred to earlier on.<br />
But in passing may I say this we have a situation now where<br />
we have a Royal Commonwealth Society, anc there are some anomalies<br />
connected with the name. The plain fact being, Sir,<br />
that there is confusion in the minds of some people as to whether<br />
we are a Commonwealth of Australia organization or a<br />
Commonwealth of Nations organization. And now it is that I want<br />
to look, not pleadingly, but coaxingly, towards the Prime </p>
<p>13.<br />
Minister, because I believe it is now appropriate since we<br />
have emerged as the Commonwealth of Nations that we should<br />
speak always of Australia, not as the Commonwealth of Australia,<br />
but just as Australia It can be done without constitutional<br />
amendment simply by introcducing the use of the word Australia<br />
as a matter of common parlance. We are one of the free<br />
nations within the Commonwealth of Nations, and as such I<br />
believe we are Australians.<br />
Well now, my thanks on behalf of the guests is most<br />
sincere; you have entertained us right royally and before I<br />
conclude I want to make a small presentation to this new Branch<br />
on behalf of the Branch of this great Society. It is<br />
rather a common experience for all of us, in fact it has been a<br />
common experience for many years that especially arouna the<br />
time of the Loan Council or the Premiers' Conference it is very<br />
frequently said, sir, that Canberra in particular gives N. S. vW.<br />
nothing. Well now let me assure you that so far as the<br />
N. S. W. r Branch of the Society is concerned, whether we feel you<br />
give us nothing or not, we want to give you something. I've<br />
S been very interested tonight to see you displaying the flags of<br />
the various Nations of the Commonwealth. The only two missing<br />
are Ghana and the Central African Federation. Some years ago<br />
we decided in Branch that we would keep up to date with<br />
the flags of the Nations of the Commonwealth and we bought a<br />
large number of these, and mountec them on a bricge as we<br />
believe that there must be a bridge among all the Nations of<br />
S the Commonwealth if we are to prosper and play our proper part<br />
Sin the world. So that is the reason we mounted them on a<br />
bridge. And here we have them with the flag of Australia<br />
q naturally taking pride of place, that is, strictly according to<br />
protocol, sir, with the Union flag on the right and the Canadian<br />
flag on the left and so on. We always display these flags<br />
at all our functions ano I do hope that you in this Branch<br />
within the Australian Capital Territory will always do the same<br />
thing. But now may I formally thank you, Mr. Newman, for so<br />
kindly proposing this toast, ana on behalf of all the guests<br />
may I not only thank this Branch for their extremely kind<br />
hospitality to us all but also on behalf of the guests may I<br />
wish this most important Branch every success in its efforts<br />
to strengthen the ties which bind the nations of the<br />
Commonwealth together. </p>

LT. CENERRL SIR HORACE ROBERTSON.<br />
Nobody said anything to me about a time limit<br />
and as Itm the last speaker i presume the rest of the evening<br />
is mint Ladies and Gentlemen, several speakers mentioned<br />
the flags which are around this room. They take my min(. back<br />
to about 10 years ago, when it was my lot to be concerned in a<br />
Joint Commonwealth Venture, and when we had very many<br />
difficult problems to face. In order to try and get the<br />
various members of the British Commonwealth together I was in<br />
the habit of giving dinners to which I invited my various<br />
Navy, Army and Air Force Commanders from Great Britain,<br />
Australia, New Zealand, from Canada and South Africa, from<br />
India and Pakistan anc from any others who happened to be<br />
about. And we used to identify them by having the flag of<br />
their own country placed where they were to sit at the table.<br />
We made the dinner a little more " Commonwealth" by getting<br />
some Toheroa soup from New Zealane, some Canadian salmon from<br />
Canada, anc appropriate food or drink from each of the<br />
countries, and the South Africans somehow took unto themselves<br />
the role I've no doubt because they thouLht it was the best<br />
of supplying us with brandy. Ihether the bnandy had anything<br />
to do with it or notoe got to a stage among ourselves in<br />
which we became very closely welded together ( laughter)<br />
and I recall the affect on my friend Colonel Pretorius from<br />
South Africa, a direct descendant of the first President of<br />
the Boer Republic against whom the British fought he was<br />
an Air Force officer and a most likeable person of whom we all<br />
were very fond. But one night he was movee to such an<br />
extent that he got up and said that he had lived in the British<br />
Empire all of his life anc that he had always felt an<br />
inferiority in that he was not treated as other than a colonial.<br />
Now for the first time in his life in Japan, in Korea, at these<br />
dinners and among the others he had felt at last that he was an<br />
equal among equals, that nobody claimed superiority over anyone<br />
else ane that we were all one family working together. I always<br />
look back on that mor. ent as one of our greatest triumphs.<br />
Of course, it is natural with a family for them to<br />
get together because the family has something which binds them<br />
closer together than any bonu can be among frienus. And it may<br />
be that one of the factors wilich pushed us even closer together<br />
was the fact that we were somewhat overshadowed by a very large<br />
and very powerful ally with whom we were all very friendly and<br />
although we got on famously with our ally, we all felt that he<br />
was a bit big and it was a little difficult to talk to him as<br />
an equal. I had at times to try and present Australia's<br />
views to our ally, a nu the replies I received while always </p>
<p>friendly, did suggest that Australia had only about the<br />
population of New York and that the views of all the small<br />
nations, while interesting, could not carry much weight<br />
alongside those of the big nations who shouldered most of<br />
the burden. But I have also had the privilege of speaking<br />
on behalf of the whole British Commonwealth, with the whole<br />
might and weight of the British Commonwealth and of this<br />
family together, and our big friend ha,, had to listen and to<br />
give serious consideration to the views that were put forward.<br />
Therefore, I suggest that not only for the good that comes<br />
among ourselves, not only for the friendship that comes<br />
among ourselves, but for the furtherance of our own inividual<br />
and collective efforts it is wise for the British Commonwealth<br />
to speak as often as possible with an agreea and unifica voice.<br />
That is why when I came back to t-ustralia, I have taken an<br />
interest in the Royal Commonwealth Society and now fulfil<br />
the role of Presiuent of the Victorian Branch, which I<br />
think am I right Mr. Black?-is, next to Great Britain,<br />
the largest Branch in the world ( laughter). But it's no<br />
use just belonging to a Branch ano having these pleasant<br />
dinners with all these distinguished people here unless we do<br />
something, and I can only tell you of two things that we are<br />
trying to uo in Victoria. The first one is that as the<br />
London headquarters provice such a wonuerfui meting place<br />
where members from all over the world can stay and meet and<br />
are provided with all sorts of facilities we have taken a<br />
similar step with our premises in Victoria, and we have a<br />
residential section where we welcome memb. rs from all over<br />
the British Commonwealth, and we have already had a large<br />
stream from Malaya, f rom Ceylon, f rom Africa, from India,<br />
from Pakistan, from Canada, f roin New Zealand and from the<br />
United Kingdom. They come and stay there anc it gives an<br />
opportunity for us all to meet together.<br />
The second thing is ecucation about our<br />
Commonwealth, and of course what we used to know in the past as<br />
jingo, is no longer popular. But there is nothing to be<br />
ashameo of in knowing something of the history and of the<br />
peoples ano resources of the various countries of the British<br />
Commonwealth in fact there is a lot to be proud of. And so<br />
we have approached Headquarters in London, where they have a<br />
Commonwealth Studies Committee and askeu them if they will<br />
produce a book describing each country of the British<br />
Commonwealth, and in view of the startling changes chat occur<br />
from day to ay, that it might evll be a loose-leaf book so<br />
that the new members of the British Commonwealth can be<br />
I I </p>
<p>16.<br />
incorporated as they grow to equal status with us.~ The<br />
Education Department of Victoria has uncertaken they will adopt<br />
that book throughout the whole of their schools as a textbook.<br />
I believe that if we can get that book then all Commonwealth<br />
countries may want to use it because it is a rccor6 of great<br />
achievement, great things to be proud of, and of the great<br />
future which still faces us in this British Commonwealth.<br />
Mr. President, on behalf of the Victorian Branch,<br />
I wish all success an6 good fortunc to the Australian Capital<br />
Territory Branch, IWe are delighted that a Branch has been<br />
established here as we feel that the National Capital of<br />
Australia is not truly the National Capital unless it also has<br />
its national representation o f the Royal Commonwealth Society.<br />
Thank you for your welcome, </p>
