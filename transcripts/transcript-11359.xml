    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE....................</p>
<p>Well, thank you very much, Mr Deputy Mayor, Des Brown; to David and</p>
<p> Penny Hawker, Joy Howley, the President of Victorian Division; to</p>
<p> my numerous Federal and State Parliamentary colleagues and fellow</p>
<p> Liberals.</p>
<p>I am delighted to have the opportunity to say a few words very directly</p>
<p> to Liberal Party activists and supporters here in the electorate of</p>
<p> Wannon but can I first of all express to you, David and Penny, and</p>
<p> through you to the people of the area, to the people of Wannon, to</p>
<p> the people of the western district of Victoria, my gratitude for the</p>
<p> very warm reception I received this morning.</p>
<p>There are many ways in Australian politics of reaching people. And</p>
<p> one very special way, of course, is to go to country shows. I thought</p>
<p> what I experienced this morning was a country show writ very large,</p>
<p> with a very, very special character. And I can't remember feeling</p>
<p> the ambience of being in the bush, of being in rural Australia and</p>
<p> addressing such a large gathering of people involved in such an important</p>
<p> rural industry. I can't remember having experienced quite the ambience</p>
<p> that I did this morning because the wool industry is very much part</p>
<p> of the history of our country. The wool industry is very much part</p>
<p> of the life and the history of this part of Australia. And I know</p>
<p> that the industry has gone through enormous ups and downs in the years</p>
<p> that I've followed it. And it's going through some hard times at the</p>
<p> moment but like all industries there are some strong areas and some</p>
<p> not so strong areas. There are some efficient areas and not so efficient</p>
<p> areas and there are some opportunities for people that maybe aren't</p>
<p> available to others.</p>
<p>One of the very good things at the present time for the wool industry,</p>
<p> indeed, for all primary industry around Australia is that I can say</p>
<p> without fear of much contradiction that the generic economic conditions</p>
<p> we have at the moment are as good as they have been for more than</p>
<p> three decades. Indeed, in many ways our economy now is stronger than</p>
<p> what it was in the late 1960s. It's more open and competitive. It's</p>
<p> less protected. It's not constructed on an artificial basis which</p>
<p> is subject to likely change in the future. We do have the lowest interest</p>
<p> rates for 30 years, the lowest inflation rate. We have, I'm very proud</p>
<p> to say, the lowest Federal Government, or government debt to GDP ratio</p>
<p> of any of the 24 OECD countries. And that is very important because</p>
<p> farmers know more than most in the community the burden that is carried</p>
<p> if you have too much debt. And one of the many complaints I used to</p>
<p> receive as I went around the bush in the years that we were in Opposition</p>
<p> - and those years seemed to go on forever, they were 13 years of them,</p>
<p> 13 years too many - people complained about not only the interest</p>
<p> rate they had to pay on their own debt but they also complained about</p>
<p> the readiness of governments to run up debt. And, of course, the former</p>
<p> government here in Victoria was pretty good at running up debt. And</p>
<p> one of the challenges of the Kennett Government when it was elected</p>
<p> in 1992 was to bring about a reduction of that debt and it's done</p>
<p> it quite magnificently. And, equally, our predecessors were the world's</p>
<p> worst at running up debt and we inherited a Commonwealth Government</p>
<p> debt of about $95 billion when we were elected.</p>
<p>And I'm very pleased to say that if we can get the other 50 per cent</p>
<p> of Telstra sold, by the year 2002 we could be completely free of net</p>
<p> Commonwealth debt. Now, that would be an astonishingly sound basis</p>
<p> on which to effectively commence the next millennium because getting</p>
<p> rid of debt means that people who want to do productive things don't</p>
<p> have to compete with governments in the markets for borrowing money</p>
<p> and that interest rates are more likely to stay down than to go up.</p>
<p> And it's very important that we continue to work hard to get rid of</p>
<p> our debt.</p>
<p>As you know we have just come through a quite historic exercise in</p>
<p> reforming our taxation system. We've succeeded in bringing about the</p>
<p> most beneficial change to our taxation system certainly since World</p>
<p> War II and perhaps any time since Federation. And there are a lot</p>
<p> of benefits in that taxation reform for people in rural Australia.</p>
<p> To start with, fuel is going to be dramatically cheaper. We're not</p>
<p> only going to cut the price of diesel but we're also going to effectively</p>
<p> reduce the cost of other fuel by seven cents a litre when it is used</p>
<p> for business purposes. And the benefits of this, the benefits of this</p>
<p> for the bush are tremendous. I don't think people understand fully</p>
<p> the dimension of the change that is made, has been made in this area.</p>
<p> And it's important to remember that when we went to the election in</p>
<p> October of last year we made certain commitments in relation to diesel</p>
<p> and the cost of fuel in the bush. And it's also important to remember</p>
<p> that when our legislation seemed to hit the wall in the Senate when</p>
<p> a certain Senator from Tasmania said, 'I cannot', I made a promise</p>
<p> to the rural community of Australia at the 20th anniversary</p>
<p> gathering of the National Farmers' Federation at Longreach in Queensland</p>
<p> - which coincided with the first ever meeting of Federal Cabinet in</p>
<p> Longreach - I made a commitment that in the negotiations that we about</p>
<p> to conduct with the Australian Democrats, in the bargaining that went</p>
<p> on we would not in any way bargain away the commitments that we had</p>
<p> made to people in rural Australia. And I can say without any fear</p>
<p> of contradiction that undertaking has been honoured in full. And the</p>
<p> benefits of the lower excise for diesel, the other changes which are</p>
<p> going to be of enormous benefit to farmers and to primary producers,</p>
<p> all of those have been kept and none of them have been affected by</p>
<p> or in any way whittled away. And there is, in fact, an argument suggesting</p>
<p> because we've extended the diesel concession, off-road diesel concession</p>
<p> to rail, there's an argument that, in fact, the new package has significantly</p>
<p> enhanced the benefits of the fuel reductions and the diesel concessions</p>
<p> in particular for people living in rural Australia.</p>
<p>And I want to take the opportunity here at this lunch as I did to</p>
<p> the gathering this morning when I opened the Sheepvention to repeat</p>
<p> a commitment. And that is that when we receive John Ralph's Report</p>
<p> - and that will be in the next few days - and when as a government</p>
<p> we sit down to look at changes to the business taxation system - and</p>
<p> we are going to make changes to business taxation - there will be</p>
<p> changes made to the capital gains tax to make it more attractive for</p>
<p> people to invest. There will be other changes made. I want to make</p>
<p> it very clear that none of the changes we make will disadvantage people</p>
<p> in rural Australia. We haven't decided yet on what the precise changes</p>
<p> are going to be because we haven't got the final report. But we have</p>
<p> decided that there will be a few principles that are going to guide</p>
<p> the making of our decisions and one of those principles will be that</p>
<p> we don't intend to make changes that are going to in any way erode</p>
<p> the competitiveness of farmers or in any way hurt people who live</p>
<p> in rural Australia.</p>
<p>And we're also going to try and make changes that make Australia a</p>
<p> more attractive country in which to invest. I've paid a lot of visits</p>
<p> over the years to the United States and I've paid a lot of visits</p>
<p> over the years to New York which remains undoubtedly the financial</p>
<p> capital of the world. And what is very interesting is that on this</p>
<p> occasion I was paid more regard to and I was listened to with greater</p>
<p> respect and there was a greater universal respect for Australia's</p>
<p> economic performance in New York than I have experienced in any time</p>
<p> over the last 20 years. And what is interesting about the United States</p>
<p> is that many of their business leaders, particularly in the financial</p>
<p> community, have a much greater understanding of our country than do</p>
<p> some of their political leaders. It was disappointing to me to find</p>
<p> that the two senior ranking republican leaders I spoke to, the Speaker</p>
<p> of the House of Representatives and the Majority Leader in the Senate,</p>
<p> that neither of them had visited Australia. And neither of them had</p>
<p> any real understanding, I don't think, of Australia. Yet all of the</p>
<p> leaders of the major banks and financial institutions I met in New</p>
<p> York had all been to Australia on numerous occasions. They have business</p>
<p> operations here, indeed, one of them is a part owner of a very well</p>
<p> known restaurant in Melbourne. And that little sort of anecdote drives</p>
<p> home to me something very important and that is that the way to further</p>
<p> connect with the United States is rather through the business community</p>
<p> and particularly the financial community than sometimes at a political</p>
<p> level. And certainly we are regarded in New York and we are regarded</p>
<p> in the United States as having performed very well economically. And</p>
<p> there is enhanced interest in our country. There is an enhanced willingness</p>
<p> to further invest in Australia and to open up new avenues of investment</p>
<p> that didn't exist before. But it's very important that we understand</p>
<p> that in the hard-headed world of financial decision making investment</p>
<p> goes where profit is most likely to accrue and where competitiveness</p>
<p> is the greater.</p>
<p>I would like to see Australia become a major world financial centre.</p>
<p> And there's no reason why that can't occur. And there's no reason</p>
<p> why, when you look at our generic strength, our low inflation, our</p>
<p> political stability, our economic stability, the fact that we have</p>
<p> very clear rules of corporate governance, we have an incorruptible</p>
<p> legal system, we have the rather obvious enhancement of being able</p>
<p> to speak the English language, although some people suggest on occasions</p>
<p> we mangle it but it's an enormous advantage. And we also have within</p>
<p> our ranks, particularly in the cities, we have a large number of Australians</p>
<p> of Asian descent who can speak the language of that region, the languages</p>
<p> rather, of that region with very great skill and very great dexterity.</p>
<p> When you add all of those things together and you think of our enviable</p>
<p> lifestyle, if we get our decisions right in relation to our business</p>
<p> taxation system this country can become an even more attractive place</p>
<p> in which to invest.</p>
<p>So, it's a good story but amidst that very good story of everything</p>
<p> being very positive at a national level I do recognise, as I said</p>
<p> at the gathering this morning, that the people in the wool industry</p>
<p> have gone through a lot of difficulty. We had Ian McLachlan's report</p>
<p> a few weeks ago. That's now being discussed around the industry and</p>
<p> when we get reaction to that the Government will be addressing the</p>
<p> sort of decisions that need to be taken. Like all industries it's</p>
<p> had to adjust, everybody has to adjust. The world in this globalised,</p>
<p> economic environment imposes adjustment on everybody but it's very</p>
<p> important to remember that we can't reverse the process of globalisation.</p>
<p> We don't have an option. In the 1960s we could get away with having</p>
<p> high tariff barriers, you can't do that any more. And it's in the</p>
<p> long-term interests of this country that we continue to try and open</p>
<p> up the markets of other countries. We got very angry about lamb, and</p>
<p> justifiably so.</p>
<p>The other side of the story is that in 1998 we actually increased</p>
<p> our exports to the United States by 34 per cent. And indeed one of</p>
<p> the reasons why Australia has been able to stare down the Asian economic</p>
<p> downturn is that we were able to switch a lot of our trade which had</p>
<p> been going to the countries of the Asian-Pacific region into North</p>
<p> America and to Europe. And that was partly the result of us having</p>
<p> a very well managed exchange rate and the conduct of our exchange</p>
<p> rate policy by the Reserve Bank has been one of the major economic</p>
<p> strengths that the country has had over the last few years.</p>
<p>And I want to assure you, and particularly your local member David,</p>
<p> who does a terrific job of representing the people of Wannon and the</p>
<p> people of Hamilton in the Federal Parliament, I want to assure you</p>
<p> that we are conscious of the fact that there are particular concerns</p>
<p> in the bush about the run down of services. And one of the things</p>
<p> that we did when we decided that we would try and sell some more of</p>
<p> Telstra was that we establish what we call the social bonus. And that</p>
<p> is that we said that if we could get some more of Telstra sold then</p>
<p> out of the proceeds of that sale we would provide some additional</p>
<p> services.</p>
<p>And one of those proposals at the last election is of direct relevance</p>
<p> to the people of this part of Victoria. And we said that a key initiative</p>
<p> was a $120 million television fund to bring SBS to more regional areas</p>
<p> and to eradicate transmission black spots. And that was to be funded</p>
<p> from the sale of a further 16 per cent of Telstra. And I am delighted</p>
<p> to say today that the communities in Western Victoria will be a priority</p>
<p> area for this new five year fund when the money is finally available</p>
<p> from the sale. And detailed site analysis will commence this month</p>
<p> with final planning, purchase of equipment and installation and commissioning</p>
<p> to follow.</p>
<p>And that on current indications viewers in towns such as Hamilton</p>
<p> and Portland should be watching SBS television by October in the year</p>
<p> 2000. And this is, I know, an area that people have been expressing</p>
<p> concerns about for a long time but for the benefit of the scribes</p>
<p> present I am putting out a separate release so you need not take it</p>
<p> down. My staff will be providing a news release. But this is fulfilment</p>
<p> of a particular promise that we made at the time of the last election</p>
<p> and it's an indication that we are not only trying to look after the</p>
<p> concerns of rural people at the macro level, the general state of</p>
<p> the economy level, but we are also trying to address particular concerns.</p>
<p> Because I know that there is a lot of angst in rural Australia about</p>
<p> the disappearance of what are regarded as basic services. And I know</p>
<p> there's a lot of concern about banks. I know there's a lot of concern</p>
<p> about doctors. And I am pleased to say that in relation to doctors</p>
<p> a number of initiatives that have been taken by Michael Wooldridge</p>
<p> and the Government and as a result of a tour that Michael Wooldridge</p>
<p> and John Anderson conducted in many parts of rural Australia a few</p>
<p> months ago and as a result of the announcements that have been made</p>
<p> in the Budget there is a belief, I think, spreading in rural Australia</p>
<p> that at long last a number of specific initiatives are starting to</p>
<p> have an effect and we are starting to address that problem in a more</p>
<p> effective way.</p>
<p>But, David, can I thank you very warmly, you and Penny for inviting</p>
<p> me here today. I am sorry that I had to cancel the earlier visit but</p>
<p> you may remember I had to cancel that visit and a visit to a couple</p>
<p> of the rural electorates because of the need to negotiate with the</p>
<p> Australian Democrats regarding the taxation package. And you were</p>
<p> good enough to understand the need for that and I was delighted that</p>
<p> I was able to renew my commitment and come here.</p>
<p>But it has been extremely enjoyable. I do, as Leader of the parliamentary</p>
<p> Liberal Party, want to thank all of you for your tremendous support,</p>
<p> your contributions to and your loyalty to the Liberal Party over a</p>
<p> long period of time. The Liberal Party is sustained by its branch</p>
<p> membership. We can't achieve anything unless we get candidates elected</p>
<p> into Parliament. The Liberal Party organisation is a voluntary organisation</p>
<p> and it's the efforts and the goodwill and the financial support and</p>
<p> the hard physical work of people like yourselves.</p>
<p>And I certainly agree with Marilyn, your electorate Chairman, I think</p>
<p> it was her who said earlier that there are awards in heaven for people</p>
<p> who hand out how-to-vote cards. I have constantly said that. In the</p>
<p> 40-odd years that I have been a branch office bearer I have said that.</p>
<p> And I have heard State Presidents say that and I have heard Federal</p>
<p> Presidents say that and now you are hearing a Prime Minister say that</p>
<p> because it has to be right then if all of those people say it. But</p>
<p> it can be a thankless task but can I say it is not a task and it is</p>
<p> not a performance and it's not something that you do that goes unacknowledged.</p>
<p>I owe everything that I have achieved in public life to the Liberal</p>
<p> Party. Without the Liberal Party I would never have achieved the things</p>
<p> that I have achieved and I have never forgotten that and I never lose</p>
<p> an opportunity of expressing my gratitude to the members of the Liberal</p>
<p> Party wherever I go in Australia for their tremendous loyalty and</p>
<p> support. And I do that again today. I wish you well. The party is</p>
<p> in good shape, in good shape here in Victoria and it's in good shape</p>
<p> nationally. We have got a good story to tell, we have got good members</p>
<p> to support and I look forward, without any sense of complacency I</p>
<p> might add, I look forward to more opportunities to do good things</p>
<p> for the people of Australia. Thank you very much.</p>
