PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON PJ KEATING, MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH GRAHAM DOBELL, RADIO AUSTRALIA<br />
FRIDAY 24 JUNE, 1994<br />
GD: Prime Minister, what will you be saying to the Indonesians about the<br />
closure of the three news magazines?<br />
PM: Well, I'm not going there, principally, to talk about the closure of the<br />
three news magazines. I'm going to Indonesia as part of a visit to<br />
participate in the Australia Today trade forum the largest<br />
international exhibition Australia has had. And, as this will be my third<br />
visit, to take the opportunity, in a fairly informal way, of going back<br />
over some of the progress we've made already in respect of our<br />
relationship and the progress we've made jointly in APEC and focusing<br />
on the fact that President Soeharto will be chairing the APEC Leaders'<br />
meeting later this year.<br />
GD: What does the ban, though, do you think, say about the feelings at the<br />
top in Jakarta, about the pace of change that they're confronting?<br />
PM: Well, I think, Indonesia is like many countries in the region; its in a<br />
state of constant change where there are many imperatives starting to<br />
impact on their country the growth imperative and all that it brings<br />
with it for change and diversity and plurality of opinion. I don't doubt<br />
that these are pressures which haven't been as evident in bygone<br />
days as they are now. For our part, Gareth Evans, as Foreign<br />
Minister, has made clear Australia's disappointment about the fact that<br />
these organs have been changed. But, again, from our point of view<br />
there are similar things... there is press control in China and we still<br />
deal and trade with China, there is fairly tight control of the press in<br />
Malaysia and we still deal and trade with Malaysia. And, I think, this<br />
relationship now has many legs to it and it does give us the<br />
opportunity, I think, to maintain a working relationship despite some of<br />
these things which are disappointments to us. </p>
<p>GD: Does it symbolise though, some effort to put on the brakes? Is it a step<br />
back from the policy of openness that President Soeharto has been<br />
talking about?<br />
PM: Well, I think it may be that we will witness in many countries similar to<br />
Indonesia such as Indonesia and similar to Indonesia that there<br />
will be sort of, four steps forward and one back, and four forward and<br />
one back. I think we'll see a bit of this. But, there's also strong public<br />
opinion and reactions about this, about any crimp on information<br />
wherever it occurs, in most places, and I understand this to be the<br />
case in Indonesia as well.<br />
GD: One of the comments from Jakarta has been from the head of<br />
Indonesia's largest Muslim organisation, Abdul Rachman Mahid<br />
He said he thought you, as a friend, should speak to the President on<br />
this. Do you have a duty, perhaps, as a friend, to speak to Soeharto<br />
on this?<br />
PM: Australia is not the international news and media plurality policeman.<br />
Now, there is a sort of view around that because we have a very fre<br />
press-we ought to be arguing for a press similar to ours wherever we<br />
go. Well, we are an open and plural country and that's part of our<br />
strength and we're also very forthright. But, I could make my next visit<br />
to China, the first item on the agenda, press freedom and plurality.<br />
Would this be the first agenda item, though, one should choose?<br />
GD: How close do you think Australia should be seeking to get to the<br />
Soeharto. leadership and how will it be positioning itself for the<br />
leadership which will follow Soeharto? Do you draw that distinction?<br />
PM: No, because I think that what Australia has done is develop a<br />
relationship with the government of Indonesia in the broad, in the<br />
bureaucracy as well. So, it's a very wide relationship and now that's<br />
extending into the institutions and into industrial companies. And, the<br />
Austral ia-Indonesia Ministerial forum is an indication of that, minister<br />
to minister contacts. This was say, evidently true with Malaysia in the<br />
difficulties we had with Malaysia less than a year ago. On that<br />
occasion the relationship between Australian ministers and Malaysian<br />
ministers, I think, mattered. In the same way, though, I've developed, I<br />
think, a very competent working relationship with President Soeharto.<br />
I've also, I think, got a reasonable relationship with some Indonesian<br />
ministers and some of the ministers in this government have an even<br />
better relationship with them.<br />
GD: In terms of the trends you're talking about, though, must it be ultimately<br />
a commitment to Indonesia and not to the Soeharto leadership?<br />
PM: Well, it is. It is exactly that, it is a commitment to Indonesia to what<br />
Indonesia is, what it has become, to the people of Indonesia. I mean, </p>
<p>that's the nature of the relationship, I think, Australia has. But, I don't<br />
think anyone should underestimate. though, the sense of peace and<br />
stability which President Soeharto's administration has brought to the<br />
archipelago and to the region.<br />
GD: You said in March that no country mattered more to Australia than<br />
Indonesia, does that mean that your policy in Asia has to reflect to<br />
some extent what is happening in Indonesia, the pace of change in<br />
Indonesia?<br />
PM: Well, I think there is a certain geographical and economic imperative<br />
in that, and particularly since the change in the end of the Cold War<br />
where we have seen a change in the bi-polarity of the world, where<br />
regional, a regional focus becomes more important. I almost think it's<br />
self-evident that Indonesia emerges as the most important relationship<br />
for Australia.<br />
GD: How much of a veto power almost does that give Indonesia. Do we<br />
have to have Indonesia to get the sorts of things you want, for<br />
instance, in APEC?<br />
PM: No. I don't think it gives them veto powers at all. But I think it means<br />
that we're stripping away some of the perceived difficulties in this<br />
relationship and going to the core basis of it, that is, is there a basis in<br />
the Indonesian/ Australian relationship which is one where trust can be<br />
built in terms of Indonesia's view of Australia, and Australian interests,<br />
and vice versa, Is there a basis of mutual respect here? Is there a<br />
basis of going on to build something bigger? Now, I think the answer<br />
is in the affirmative in all three things.<br />
GD: If this massive trade push that we're making into Indonesia, that you're<br />
going for, if thdtf ucc6eeds, how would Indonesians, do you think, think<br />
differently about Australia?<br />
PM: Well, I think the relationship with Indonesia has changed enormously<br />
in the last few years. Indonesia is now much more open to Australia<br />
than it has probably ever been. It's institutions are more open. It's<br />
Government is more open. It's companies, it's business organisations<br />
are more open. And as that happens I. think that the understanding<br />
about Australia, and respect for Australia, will improve. I mean, the<br />
ABC's international television agency, ATVl, is now a free-to-air<br />
provider of news and information in Indonesia and is now gathering, so<br />
I understand it, substantial support amongst the Indonesian elite,<br />
those who make policy and make investment decisions they find it an<br />
important source of news and information. So, we're injecting more of<br />
Australia, all the time, into Indonesia, and we're getting a response.<br />
GD: However close that relationship can become, must it always be at<br />
some levels uncomfortable, perhaps symbolised most significantly by<br />
the fact that it's been twenty years now since President Soeharto </p>
<p>actually set foot in Australia. Is that a symbol of the problems that will<br />
continue?<br />
PM: Well, I don't think so. There's a core question here, whether Indonesia<br />
has any strategic designs on Australia, and I don't think it has and the<br />
other question is do we on Indonesia? I don't think we have. We<br />
haven't. So therefore there is nothing but a basis for friendship here.<br />
There's no disputed territory, there's no shared borders, there's none<br />
of this sort of thing. So it brings us to a position where we say, well,<br />
this archipelago has been brought together as a nation, held together,<br />
it's growing, there's income re-distribution going on, there are good<br />
things happening here. How can we be involved in it, how can we<br />
support it, how can we make it better?<br />
GD: But two countries that probably hard to think of two countries, two<br />
neighbours in the world that have less in common. How far can you<br />
go, in terms of achieving that comfort level?<br />
PM: Well, as far as you can try, I think, I mean, one will never end up with<br />
perfection in any relationship, and we won't with this. But I think<br />
Australia should try and make it as good as we can. Just as we<br />
dutifully try, I think, ambitiously try, to do the same with other countries<br />
in the region.<br />
GD: Thank you Prime Minister<br />
