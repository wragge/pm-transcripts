    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE...............................................................................................................................</p>
<p>Well, thank you very much Peter for those very warm words of welcome;</p>
<p> to Joy Howley; to Tony Staley; to Peter Poggioli; to Phil Gude, the</p>
<p> Deputy Leader of the State Parliamentary Liberal Party, Alan Stockdale,</p>
<p> the Treasurer of Victoria, to my other Ministerial and Parliamentary</p>
<p> colleagues, both State and Federal, and most importantly the men and</p>
<p> women of the Liberal Party of Victoria.</p>
<p>It is a great pleasure for me to back addressing once again the State</p>
<p> Council gathering of the strongest division of the Liberal Party of</p>
<p> Australia. A Division, that over the years through good times and</p>
<p> bad for the Federal Parliamentary Party, in Government and in Opposition,</p>
<p> has always delivered a magnificent electoral dividend to us in Canberra.</p>
<p>I want in my remarks this morning to express again my gratitude to</p>
<p> the Victorian Division for the tremendous understanding, and support,</p>
<p> and loyalty, and vigorous advocacy which all of you have delivered</p>
<p> to us over the last two years. It has been a two year period of tremendous</p>
<p> achievement. And as we turn our gaze towards the inevitability of</p>
<p> a Federal election some time in the next twelve months and if I were</p>
<p> some of the newspaper commentators I wouldn't get too excited</p>
<p> about particular dates. Can I say to all of you that the next twelve</p>
<p> months is not a time to be reticent, it is not a time to be shy, it</p>
<p> is not a time to be unforthcoming about what the Government that I</p>
<p> have the privilege to lead has achieved.</p>
<p>In many respects the Coalition Government elected in March of 1996</p>
<p> has been the greatest reform government Australia has had since the</p>
<p> end of World War II. In all the areas you look at you have seen sweeping,</p>
<p> indeed, fundamental reform. No Government and no Treasurer has achieved</p>
<p> what my Government, and Peter Costello has achieved, over the last</p>
<p> two years in turning around the disastrous fiscal inheritance that</p>
<p> was left to us. A $10.5 billion deficit concealed - but so obvious</p>
<p> and there for the asking. But the day after the election when I met</p>
<p> the outgoing head of the Prime Minister's Department and his</p>
<p> two colleagues in my then Opposition Leader's office in Sydney,</p>
<p> still recovering as I was from the euphoria of the night before, but</p>
<p> able to read, just, because I had been to Church. I was able to read</p>
<p> those dreadful figures. They handed me the book. It was all there</p>
<p> and, of course, it had been there for weeks but somebody hadn't</p>
<p> bothered to ask. And that is the measure of the difficulty that we</p>
<p> faced. We did inherit a deficit of $10.5 billion. And in just two</p>
<p> years we have turned that by dint of an extraordinary effort of fiscal</p>
<p> discipline to which all of my colleagues have contributed. We have</p>
<p> turned that around and I am immensely proud of that reform. And it</p>
<p> is a reform that is widely recognised throughout the economic world.</p>
<p> It is a reform that is helped to fire-proof the Australian economy</p>
<p> against the worst of the Asian ravages. It means that as we talk to</p>
<p> the leaders of Indonesia, the leaders of China and Singapore we are</p>
<p> able to talk from a position of strength. And along with Japan, Australia</p>
<p> is the only nation that has been strong enough to participate in the</p>
<p> three IMF bailouts, respectively of Korea, Thailand and Indonesia.</p>
<p> And all of those bailouts have involved an investment in the future</p>
<p> of Australian jobs and Australian industry and that is why we have</p>
<p> done it. But you only do that from a position of strength. If Mr Beazley</p>
<p> and Mr Keating had been returned at the last election Australia would</p>
<p> not have been able to help Indonesia and Thailand and Korea in their</p>
<p> hour of need. We would not have been able to be the good regional</p>
<p> mate that we have been to those countries.</p>
<p>But as Peter said, we have delivered the lowest interest rates that</p>
<p> this country has seen for thirty years, or more. The reductions in</p>
<p> housing interest rates, worth on average about $250 to $300 a month,</p>
<p> or put another way - the equivalent for the average wage and salary</p>
<p> earner in Australia of an increase of $100 a week in that person's</p>
<p> income. That is the measure. And none of you should ever forget in</p>
<p> the months ahead that in 1990 the overdraft rate for small business</p>
<p> was driven to 20.5 per cent under Mr Keating's Treasurership.</p>
<p> And in the last week we have had two of the major banks in Australia</p>
<p> announce dramatically lower interest rates for small and large businesses.</p>
<p> And that we will have a base rate for small business in the order</p>
<p> of 7.25 per cent from Westpac and about the same from the Commonwealth</p>
<p> Bank. And I expect it will only be a matter of time before the other</p>
<p> banks and financial institutions respond. None of that would have</p>
<p> been possible if we hadn't cut the budget deficit. None of that</p>
<p> would have been possible if we hadn't embarked upon a process</p>
<p> of fiscal consolidation.</p>
<p>But it doesn't end there. We have reformed the industrial relations</p>
<p> system and we have reformed it in a climate of industrial peace and</p>
<p> industrial tranquility, the like of which we have not seen at any</p>
<p> time since the end of World War II. Indeed, in 1997, the number of</p>
<p> industrial disputes in Australia hit the lowest level it had been</p>
<p> for</p>
<p>85 years. In other words, we had to go back to the years of World</p>
<p> War I to find a period of industrial peace, the equal of what we experienced</p>
<p> in 1997. So much for all the prophecies of blood in the streets and</p>
<p> industrial strife - all the warnings that were made in those speeches</p>
<p> by Mr Kelty and others on the eve of the 1996 election. Because what</p>
<p> the Australian people have said and what the Australian workers have</p>
<p> said is that they welcome the opportunities and the choice involved</p>
<p> in the new industrial relations era that we have introduced.</p>
<p>And, of course, under Peter Costello's Treasurership, we have</p>
<p> also embarked upon some very fundamental changes and reforms to the</p>
<p> Australian financial system. We have, in the Australian financial</p>
<p> system now, one of the most competitive in the world. And increasingly</p>
<p> Australia is seen as a haven for investment in this part of the world.</p>
<p> We have a stable political system. We have stable economic conditions.</p>
<p> The lowest rate of inflation in the OECD area. We have a stable legal</p>
<p> system. We speak the international language, the English language.</p>
<p> And we are seen as having a stable banking system with an open competitive</p>
<p> financial approach. In other words, you have a coming together of</p>
<p> all of the influences that make Australia the most attractive place</p>
<p> in the world in which to invest. And I believe that we are set fair</p>
<p> to realise one of our other great goals in the next century. And that</p>
<p> is to see Australia become, after Tokyo, the second great financial</p>
<p> centre of the Asian Pacific region. And to join New York and London,</p>
<p> along with Tokyo, as the four great financial centres of the world.</p>
<p>And, of course, the reform agenda doesn't end there either. We</p>
<p> have, by our commitment, to allow the men and women of Australia to</p>
<p> buy the remaining two-thirds of Telstra. We have given ourselves the</p>
<p> capacity, in that one single decision, to reduce, by 40 per cent,</p>
<p> the total Federal Government debt of this country. In other words,</p>
<p> 40 per cent of the almost $100 billion of Federal Government debt</p>
<p> that we inherited from Mr Beazley and Mr Keating in March of 1996.</p>
<p>We've also seen significant strides on the employment front.</p>
<p> We have seen, over the last six months, the generation of about 140,000</p>
<p> new jobs. We have seen significant reforms to small business. We have</p>
<p> seen the introduction of the work-for-the-dole principles. The principle</p>
<p> of mutual obligation. The principle that Mr Beazley chokes on. The</p>
<p> principle that no Labor government could ever embrace because the</p>
<p> trade union movement would deny them the capacity to deliver it in</p>
<p> government.</p>
<p>And so, my friends, the list of reforms has been quite fundamental.</p>
<p> On the 1st of May we will introduce a fully competitive system of</p>
<p> labour market tendering. The Jobs Network, it represents, for the</p>
<p> first time anywhere in the world, a far more private sector approach</p>
<p> to the process of job placement. Wherever you go, in all the fields</p>
<p> of our responsibility and our endeavour, this has been a great reforming</p>
<p> government.</p>
<p>And, of course, we have ahead of us that great unfinished piece of</p>
<p> economic reform business in Australia, and that is to reform Australia's</p>
<p> increasingly outmoded and ramshackled taxation system. We've</p>
<p> said, consistently, that we will lay before the Australian people,</p>
<p> before the next election, a plan to be implemented after the election</p>
<p> that will restore fairness and equity to the Australian taxation system.</p>
<p> A plan that will be bad news for the cheats, but good news for the</p>
<p> honest workers of Australia. It'll be good news for the exporters</p>
<p> of Australia. It'll be good news for the small business men and</p>
<p> women of Australia. And, above all else, it will be good news for</p>
<p> the future economic competitiveness of our nation.</p>
<p>What is the response of the Labor Party to that? The response of the</p>
<p> Labor Party to that is to pretend that the present system is adequate</p>
<p> - the system that they made worse and worse over a 13 year period.</p>
<p> And they demonstrate, by their response to our approach, they demonstrate</p>
<p> their fundamental indifference to serious reform and they demonstrate</p>
<p> their fundamental and continuing unfitness for office.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, there is one other great issue that is with</p>
<p> us at the present time. And that, of course, is to reform the Australian</p>
<p> waterfront. It is part, almost of the legend of industrial relations</p>
<p> and life in Australia, that our waterfront is inefficient. There's</p>
<p> that wonderful story about the lady of Charleville, when she was told</p>
<p> that a cyclone was coming by her grand-daughter and she said: don't</p>
<p> worry, darling, the wharfies won't land it. And, of course, it's</p>
<p> not a joke, only in the most peripheral of senses. It has long been</p>
<p> the grim reality of many of the exporters of Australia, particularly</p>
<p> our farmers who've worked hard in difficult seasons against great</p>
<p> odds only to see market opportunities squandered because of the inefficiency</p>
<p> of our waterfront. By any measure, we have a highly inefficient waterfront.</p>
<p>Bob Hawke promised and delivered many meetings when he was Prime Minister.</p>
<p> And that is the response of Mr Beazley He said: oh, there's no</p>
<p> problem with the waterfront, all you've got to do is have a meeting</p>
<p> or, if necessary, two or three or four or five meetings and at the</p>
<p> end of the day you can negotiate an arrangement with the Maritime</p>
<p> Union of Australia. Well, they tried that. The Labor Party tried that.</p>
<p> And there was about $450 million spent, under the former government,</p>
<p> as a result of all of those meetings. And we got absolutely no lasting</p>
<p> dividend in terms of improved productivity.</p>
<p>Our waterfront is still woefully inefficient by world standards. It</p>
<p> is miles behind the wharves of our competitor nations in the Asian</p>
<p> Pacific region. The reforms that were undertaken in New Zealand a</p>
<p> few years ago have literally left us for dead. We have tried negotiating.</p>
<p> We have always been willing to embrace sensible reform. But in the</p>
<p> past, the law has stood in the way. But now you have a government</p>
<p> that has had the courage to change the law.</p>
<p>When we changed the Industrial Relations Act, we broke the</p>
<p> monopoly on the recruitment and the supply of labour on the Australian</p>
<p> waterfront by the Maritime Union. And it has now been possible, through</p>
<p> the courage of Patricks - and I say that deliberately and unashamedly</p>
<p> - and the courage of the National Farmers' Federation. Those</p>
<p> two organisations have taken advantage of the law that we are proud</p>
<p> to say that we changed. And what we are now seeing is the first real</p>
<p> attempt for 50 years to deliver a more competitive waterfront. And</p>
<p> this is a defining moment in Australia's industrial relations</p>
<p> history. It is a defining moment in a very, very long saga, a disgraceful</p>
<p> saga, of low productivity and anti-competitive behaviour. And it's</p>
<p> an opportunity that has to be embraced, an opportunity grasped by</p>
<p> the Australian community.</p>
<p>And I want to say, on behalf of the Government, that we will support</p>
<p> any attempts, provided they are within the laws of Australia, to make</p>
<p> Australian wharves more competitive and more productive. And we will</p>
<p> support any, legitimately, within the laws of Australia, who commit</p>
<p> themselves to achieve those very important national interest goals.</p>
<p>And, of course, we're not dealing here with the battlers of the</p>
<p> trade union movement. We're not dealing here with underpaid people.</p>
<p> We're dealing here with people whose incomes are in the order</p>
<p> of $70,000 to $80,000 a year on average. We are dealing here with</p>
<p> people who've made an art form out of the rorting that goes on,</p>
<p> on the Australian waterfront. And we are dealing with a union that</p>
<p> believes that, above all unions, it has a right to privileged treatment,</p>
<p> that has a monopoly on privileged treatment and to hell with the consequences</p>
<p> to Australia and to the rest of the trade union movement. And one</p>
<p> of the things that I find quite intriguing about the behaviour of</p>
<p> the MUA over the past few days is the way in which the ACTU is edging</p>
<p> itself away and saying: well, no, we really want this strike limited,</p>
<p> we don't really want it to spread.</p>
<p>Well, can I just say again to all of you, ladies and gentlemen, this</p>
<p> is a defining moment in our industrial relations experience. It is</p>
<p> a very important issue and it is very important to the national interest</p>
<p> of Australia that there be the right conclusion.</p>
<p>My friends, can I say something of the contribution, as I would very</p>
<p> much like to do, of my Victorian colleagues to the successful working</p>
<p> of my Coalition Government. I'm very proud of the fact, of course,</p>
<p> that there are five Victorians in the Cabinet. And one of the most</p>
<p> interesting things I find to do is to make a few comparisons. I think</p>
<p> of the Minister and, if I can remember the Shadow Minister, I contrast</p>
<p> the performance of the Minister versus the Shadow Minister.</p>
<p>Now, I start with Peter Costello. Now, he's done pretty well.</p>
<p> He's done very well. And you know who his Shadow is - you must.</p>
<p> You're not depriving Gareth of attention, are you? The only thing</p>
<p> I'd say about that comparison is simply this, while Peter Costello's</p>
<p> been cutting your interest rates, Gareth Evans has been trawling through</p>
<p> the gutter of Australian politics.</p>
<p>Now, this is one that you really won't get, even in jest. Who</p>
<p> really knows the Shadow Minister for Industrial Relations? But, of</p>
<p> course, it gets even better. I don't think there's any -</p>
<p> Laurie? No, no. He's the Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs.</p>
<p> Laurie was the Minister for Industrial Relations, now it's Bob</p>
<p> McMullan, in case anybody hadn't noticed - Bob McMullan - m-c-m-u-l-l-e-n,</p>
<p> I think. But if you think, you know, there's a bit of obscurity</p>
<p> there, I don't think any of you could name - and Richard, you're</p>
<p> not allowed to take part in this - the Shadow Minister for Communications.</p>
<p> He's an obscure...</p>
<p>INTERJECTION:</p>
<p>Richard doesn't know either, Prime Minister. Richard, doesn't</p>
<p> know either.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER CONTINUES:</p>
<p>And then, of course, we have the comparison of the Health Minister,</p>
<p> Michael. And can I say, very, very seriously and very, very sincerely</p>
<p> what an outstanding job, in a very, very difficult portfolio, Michael</p>
<p> Wooldridge has done. He's an extremely valued member of my Ministerial</p>
<p> team. His opponent is that man - the little boy lost, we call him</p>
<p> - home alone from Dobell, Michael Lee.</p>
<p>And then, of course, we come to David Kemp's adversary. I'm</p>
<p> reminded of that old biblical injunction:- would that my enemy would</p>
<p> write a book. And, of course, David's adversary is Mark Latham.</p>
<p> And he's read his bible and he's written a book. The only</p>
<p> thing Mark Latham hasn't done, of course, is to say anything</p>
<p> relevant about education. And I can remember when he was appointed</p>
<p> as the Shadow Minister for Education, Mr Beazley ran around saying:</p>
<p> look, watch out Liberals, you'll be sorry you ever heard of Mark</p>
<p> Latham. I think Kim Beazley would be sorry that he'd ever heard</p>
<p> of Mark Latham. It's a great book. It actually contains some</p>
<p> thinking. And for the first time in two years you've seen somebody</p>
<p> in the Labor Party say something relevant about the future. And we're</p>
<p> very happy to remind the Australian people of this because Mark Latham</p>
<p> supports fundamental reform of Australia's taxation system. He</p>
<p> supports a broad-based, indirect tax. He supports the principle of</p>
<p> mutual obligation in welfare. He supports a progressive industry policy.</p>
<p> In other words, he supports all of the things that Kim Beazley, Simon</p>
<p> Crean and Gareth Evans totally oppose. He's a great Shadow Minister.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, could I finally say something, recognising that,</p>
<p> inevitably, in a federation, there will be some differences of emphasis</p>
<p> from time to time on the respective responsibilities of the Federal</p>
<p> and State governments. Can I something about the issue of the respective</p>
<p> health care responsibilities of the State and the Federal Government.</p>
<p> As governments we all have our responsibilities. And I think there</p>
<p> is a united view, certainly between myself and the Premier of Victoria</p>
<p> and all the other Premiers and Chief Ministers of Australia, that</p>
<p> we should deliver, to the Australian people, the best aged care and</p>
<p> the best health care system that we can.</p>
<p>We have our direct responsibilities. We have them for aged care and</p>
<p> we have them for private health insurance. And we also share responsibilities</p>
<p> through the Medicare agreement for the funding of public hospitals</p>
<p> by the State governments. And I know there have been some public disagreements</p>
<p> between the Federal and State governments. And I do want to say very</p>
<p> factually and calmly, on behalf of the Federal Government, that we</p>
<p> believe that the offer that we have made to the States is a fair and</p>
<p> reasonable one.</p>
<p>I understand the concern of States. Equally, I ask you to understand</p>
<p> the facts. I ask you to remember that the agreement that we propose,</p>
<p> commencing on the 1st of July this year, for a five year period, will</p>
<p> involve an increase of three per cent each, so that there'll</p>
<p> be accumulative real increase of 15 per cent over the five-year period.</p>
<p> And this is in a climate of zero inflation. I ask you to bear in mind</p>
<p> that in our general tax payments going to the States, for all purposes,</p>
<p> there will be an increase of almost five per cent, in real terms,</p>
<p> in a climate of zero inflation. I think it is a matter, undisputed,</p>
<p> on the public record that between 1993 and 1998, the Commonwealth</p>
<p> spent over $3.25 billion more on hospitals than if the 1992 levels</p>
<p> had continued. And the States only spent $355 million more than if</p>
<p> the 1992 funding levels had gone on. And that in the first and second</p>
<p> years of that five year period, State spending actually declined by</p>
<p> $500 million in Â93-Â94 and $331 million in the following</p>
<p> year. And that according to my advice, Victoria, South Australia,</p>
<p> Western Australia, Tasmania and the Northern Territory, on adjusted</p>
<p> 1992 dollar levels, is spending less now than was the case in those</p>
<p> years.</p>
<p>Now, I don't mention these figures other than to put, plainly</p>
<p> and unemotionally, on the public record what is our position. Because</p>
<p> the offer that we have made does represent real growth over that five-year</p>
<p> period. And it is a fair and defensible and reasonable offer. We have</p>
<p> responsibilities in the health and aged care area that go beyond our</p>
<p> responsibilities with the States in relation to public hospitals.</p>
<p>I announced last Thursday a very important expansion of the Commonwealth's</p>
<p> investment in the aged care area, built around the belief that the</p>
<p> greatest thing that we can do for the aged in Australia is to give</p>
<p> them the choice, for as long as possible, to remain within the secure</p>
<p> environment of their own homes. And the whole purpose of the policy</p>
<p> I announced on Thursday was to do that. And it was also a policy that</p>
<p> broke new ground at a Federal level in the area of providing assistance</p>
<p> and comfort for carers within our community. And I have to say, in</p>
<p> all the years that I've been in Parliament, the most moving stories</p>
<p> that I have had from constituents have been stories about the difficulty,</p>
<p> often of very elderly people caring for adult children with profound</p>
<p> disabilities and impairments. And nobody could be less than totally</p>
<p> moved and touched by those stories. They are the great unsung heroes</p>
<p> and heroines of any compassionate and decent society. And what they</p>
<p> have a right to expect from the Government and what they have a right</p>
<p> to expect from the entire community is a recognition, is a firm recognition</p>
<p> of the tremendous role that they play and also some improvement in</p>
<p> the material support that they receive.</p>
<p>And I'm very happy that, from the 1st of July this year, there'll</p>
<p> be a significant increase in the domiciliary care benefit. And also</p>
<p> that we are going to expand the respite facilities. And we're</p>
<p> also, over the next 12 or fifteen months, we're going to expand</p>
<p> the eligibility criteria for that care benefit and we're going</p>
<p> to combine it with the Disabled Childrens Benefit into a new carers</p>
<p> allowance which will have expanded criteria. So that a larger number</p>
<p> of people, I estimate up to 14,000 or 15,000 additional people, will</p>
<p> be able to qualify. This is an area of very great need. It is an area</p>
<p> of direct Federal Government responsibility. And it is an area in</p>
<p> which we are injecting more resources and more support.</p>
<p>I always regret, as I know my State colleagues do, any disagreements</p>
<p> on issues that are important to our joint endeavours. But it is the</p>
<p> responsibility of both levels of government, when those disagreements</p>
<p> occur it is the responsibility of both levels of government to put</p>
<p> their cases with care and with prudence, not emotionally, understated</p>
<p> it necessary, but nonetheless firmly, politely and factually. And</p>
<p> I have to say, on behalf of my Government, in that firm, polite, factual</p>
<p> fashion, that the offer that we have made does represent a generous</p>
<p> increase on the last five years. It does represent three per cent,</p>
<p> real, each year for five years. It does build upon an almost five</p>
<p> per cent real increase in the general tax money going to the States</p>
<p> in a climate of zero inflation. And it does have to be used against</p>
<p> the background of the individual spending decisions on hospitals that</p>
<p> have been made by all the State Governments over the past few years.</p>
<p> Now, I do have available as a result of work done by my staff, I do</p>
<p> have available, and with Michael Wooldridge's office, some material</p>
<p> explaining these things in more detail for any of you who would be</p>
<p> interested to have it.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, I know that in the course of Government it is</p>
<p> inevitable that there will be some disagreements and I think it is</p>
<p> important that the facts be examined in a very unemotional, and if</p>
<p> necessary, understated fashion.</p>
<p>Can I finally say, ladies and gentlemen, that in a sense returning</p>
<p> to what I said at the beginning of my address, and that is that we</p>
<p> have achieved an enormous amount over the last two years. And we've</p>
<p> achieved it because there has been tremendous co-operation between</p>
<p> all of the members of the Federal Parliamentary Party. And I want</p>
<p> to express to all of my Victorian colleagues, to all of you without</p>
<p> exception, my personal gratitude for the support and loyalty and understanding</p>
<p> that you have given over the last two years. There have been occasions</p>
