    <content><![CDATA[<p>I welcome, as will all people, the release of the remaining hostages in Fiji.</p>
<p>They should never have been detained in the first place. This was a criminal act which denied a democratically elected government its constitutional right to govern in the interests of the people of Fiji.</p>
<p>The Australian government remains profoundly disturbed at the abrogation of the Fijian constitution and the racially-based approach apparently being taken to future constitutional arrangements.</p>
<p>the government will give early consideration to further responses to developments in Fiji.</p>
