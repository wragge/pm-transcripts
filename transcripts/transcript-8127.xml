PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF COMMENTS ON DEPARTURE FOR JAPAN, RAAF BASE<br />
FAIRBAIRN -16 SEPTEMBER 1990<br />
E OE PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: held up out there by some green<br />
protesters? PM: No, I wasn't held up by anyone. Does it look like<br />
it?<br />
JOURNALIST: What do you think of their comments that<br />
perhaps PH: I don't know what their comments were.<br />
JOURNALIST: The bookies say that Melbourne's only got a<br />
10/ 1 chance. What's your view?<br />
PM: I backed a 66/ 1 winner the other week.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mrs Kelly's being interviewed this morning<br />
so perhaps what the protesters are saying is slightly<br />
relevant, that they're wondering whether or not the<br />
Government caved in because of the pressure from the<br />
loggers on Friday. What do you think of that?<br />
PM: I think that's nonsense.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you happy with Mrs Kelly's performance<br />
over the whole issue?<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, one of the things that has<br />
been said is that the trees in Japan are now better<br />
protected than ours as a result of Cabinet's decision.<br />
PM: What am I supposed to do about that, burst out into<br />
laughter?<br />
JOURNALIST: What's the main message you'll be taking to<br />
the Olympic people you'll be meeting in Tokyo?<br />
PM: That Melbourne's got the best bid. We're best in<br />
terms of facilities, centrality, security, environment<br />
and total commitment of the Australian population. We've<br />
got the lot.<br />
JOURNALIST: Feeling confident? </p>
<p>A, 2<br />
PM: It would be silly to say I feel confident. I am<br />
confident we've got the best bid. There will be some<br />
sentiment for Athens I believe but if the bids are<br />
considered totally on their intrinsic merits, Melbourne<br />
should win.<br />
JOURNALIST: All the best Prime Minister.<br />
ends </p>
