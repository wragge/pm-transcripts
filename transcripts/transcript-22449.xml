    <content><![CDATA[<p>To help promote open and transparent debate on the sensitive issue of embryonic stem cell research I have decided to release a report which my department commissioned on the Lockhart Review.</p>
<p>  The report was undertaken by mpconsulting who have advised the Australian Government on this issue periodically since 2001.</p>
<p>As I announced in June, the Australian Government was not disposed to make any changes to the existing national legislative framework for research involving human embryos.  However, as I have already indicated, Coalition Members and Senators will be able to exercise a free vote should legislation on this issue be introduced into Parliament.</p>
<p>Releasing the mpconsulting report will help ensure that Members of Parliament and the wider public have access to all the information that has been available to the Government.</p>
<p>The mpconsulting report can be accessed on the website of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet at <a href="http://www.dpmc.gov.au/publications/commissioned_reports.cfm">www.dpmc.gov.au/publications/commissioned_reports.cfm</a>   </p>
