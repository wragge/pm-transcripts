FOR PRESS 19 NOVEM4BER 1978<br />
ELECTORATE TALK<br />
The announcement of a further reduction in home mortgage<br />
interest rates is a timely reminder of the success of the<br />
Government's anti-inflation policies. This cut that<br />
will benefit hundreds of thousands of Australian families<br />
could not have been achieved without firm and steady<br />
economic management. It could not have been achieved if the<br />
Government had been diverted from its fight against<br />
inflation.<br />
The interest rates cut which follows a similar reduction<br />
earlier this year and a cut in overdraft rates some three<br />
weeks ago is one more clear sign that our policies<br />
are working.<br />
This year, the Government has continued to build on the<br />
solid achievements of 1977. Inflation continues to fall;<br />
interest rates are falling; investment is increasing and<br />
Australian companies are again starting to look for<br />
export opportunities. This is the path to growth that will<br />
give permanent jobs to Australians. There are no short cuts,<br />
or magic elixirs to reducing unemployment. There is only<br />
one answer. It's not very exciting, dramatic or attention<br />
grabbing. it simply involves getting the fundamentals in<br />
the economy right so that private enterprise is encouraged<br />
with incentive from Government to expand and to offer<br />
new job opportunities.<br />
The Government has also pressed forward with reforms that<br />
provide increased opportunity for migrant families, for<br />
Aboriginals, for the handicapped, the aged and infirm and has<br />
further protected the rights of individual Australians.<br />
It is unfortunate that the Federal Labor opposition has failed<br />
to focus on these and other issues that affect every<br />
Australian. They have been pre-occupied with peripheral<br />
politics. They have sought through innuendo and<br />
vitriol to attack the Government by probing the private<br />
lives of ministers. In this, they are led by the man who<br />
is best know for his phrase that " the 80' s will be the<br />
decade of despair".<br />
It is the Leader of the opposition that has constantly tried<br />
to talk down our national achievements; who has belittled<br />
our aspirations; who has preached gloom and despondency at<br />
every opportunity and who has even knocked Australia and<br />
Australians when he was on his first overseas trip as Leader<br />
of the Opposition. </p>
<p>2<br />
It is the Leader of the Opposition who described the<br />
Government's success in the fight against inflation as a<br />
" false dawn" and who says he is " sceptical" about lower<br />
interest rates.<br />
On the few occasions that Opposition spokesmen turn to<br />
economic issues, they fail to offer realistic<br />
alternative policies. Labor calls for a budget deficit<br />
that would run out to $ 4,500 million or more. That would<br />
create economic havoc, setting inflation galloping off<br />
again.<br />
Labor's alternative to encourage industry is to abolish<br />
the investment allowance; their alternative to our<br />
police of encouraging exploration and development of oil<br />
is to impose a $ 340 million levy on the profits of<br />
Australia's crude oil producers.<br />
Mr. Hayden has an alternative for Australian manufacturing.<br />
Just a few days ago he said " I am committed to seeing a<br />
larger public sector over time". Mr. Hayden is advocating,<br />
in these words, the progressive destruction of free<br />
enterprise in this country death by inches for the Australian<br />
economy. They are sad and sorry policies, out of touch with<br />
Australian aspirations out of touch with reality. They<br />
demonstrate again in the starkest terms that Labor no<br />
longer represents the working men and women of this nation.<br />
Australia will move into a great new decade of growth and<br />
development, despite Mr. Hayden's best efforts to prevent it.<br />
The knockers and the whingers will be left lamenting.<br />
Australians look to politicians to provide confidence and to advance<br />
sound and workable policies. Australians have demonstrated<br />
very plainly that they reject the politics of despair and<br />
discontent.<br />
Your Government has a vision of growth and development for<br />
Australia a vision of stability, security, concern and<br />
effective help for those in need. We have a vision of Australia<br />
in which the freedom and opportunity for individual Australians<br />
has no equal anywhere. By building on the foundations already<br />
set that vision will be realised. I am confident all<br />
Australians will meet this great task.<br />
