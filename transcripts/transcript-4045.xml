ADDRESSTO . STATE PREMIERS<br />
This meeting comes at a very critical time for Australia.<br />
It is a time when those of us who head the governments of<br />
Australia have a serious responsibility to consider the nation's<br />
problems and to give a lead in their solution. We are currently<br />
fating the kind of economic crisis which many of us believed<br />
could not occur in Australia.<br />
It is a crisis whose symptoms are the worst period of prolonged<br />
inflation in our history, the highest unemployment for<br />
years and an apallingly high Federal deficit. It is<br />
a crisis which will require the determination of us<br />
and great good will to solve.<br />
Ou." national priorities must be to beat inflation and reduce<br />
unemployment. A pre-requisite for reducing unemployment is to<br />
bring inflation under control.<br />
It is appropriate that the governments of Australi-a should be<br />
meeting at this time.<br />
The role of government of all our governments will be vital<br />
if Australia is to return to prosperity in a reasonable time.<br />
One of the significant sources of our current problems has<br />
been excessive growth in government spending over the last few<br />
years. In a very short time there has been a massive shift </p>
<p>of resources awa-from individuals and companies into the<br />
hands of government.<br />
For individuals, this has been felt in an increasingly<br />
heavy burden of taxation. For companies, this has been<br />
felt in-an erosion of profits and hence in their capacity<br />
to create job opportunities.<br />
The rapid expansion of government spending has helped to<br />
create quite unrealistic expectations about the availability<br />
of resources for government funded projects. There has been<br />
increasing neglect of the basic truth that choices have to be made.<br />
Choices have to be inade between expenditure by individuals,<br />
investment expenditure, and government expenditure. If expenditure<br />
in one area is pushed too hard the others bre ak-dom.<br />
Excessive government expenditure has led to inflation. If we<br />
doni't recognise that choices have to be made, we believe we<br />
can have the world and not pay a price for it.<br />
There are a limitless nuiberof worthy projects government<br />
might support at any time. We cannot support4 them all. Too<br />
many politicans have acted as if choices do not have to be<br />
made as if we can have everything we want at the same time.<br />
That is deceptive and cruel. It leads inevitably to disappointmen<br />
a: d disillusion.<br />
It occurs because of an unwillingness to face the truth that<br />
responsible government frequently involves hard choices,<br />
d iff i c ulIt dy:<br />
I am sure that all those here today have a very clear<br />
appreciation of the difficult choices that must be made.<br />
Policies to control inflation must have as a central objective,<br />
containing government spending and the resul ting huge deficits. ./ 3 </p>
<p>Only if the runaway growth in government spending is<br />
halted will the resources be available to expand lasting<br />
ermrlcyment opportuni es in the private sector once<br />
more. Only if there is continued moderation in the rate of<br />
inflation will there be the confidence in the private sector<br />
to expand job opportunities.<br />
In the view of the Federal Governmentv which has the principal<br />
responsibility for management of the economy, we have reached<br />
a critical time of decision. Either we make a serious<br />
determination to expand job opportunities by controlling<br />
inflation or we do not. If we do not we will be failing<br />
in our responsibilities.<br />
Since coming to office we have taken a number of measures<br />
to reduce government spending and to increase the chances<br />
that recovery occurs without adding to inflation.<br />
We have introduced a major set of monetary measures to control<br />
excessive liquidity and further encourage investment, and announce<br />
a series of reductions in government spending so far<br />
totalling $ 360 million for the remainder of this financial<br />
year. The review of spending is continuing.<br />
A similar restraint on the part of all levels of government<br />
will be a major element in getting Australia moving again.<br />
If one makes allowance for those parts of Commonwealth spending<br />
which represent transfers to the States, the total spending<br />
oE the States and their authorities is about -the same as<br />
or even slightly greater than -that of tn-e Federal Gove rment.<br />
In terms of final expenditures on goods and services the States<br />
in fact spend very much more than the Federal Government.<br />
It'is plain, therefore, that our joint responsibility to<br />
restrain government spending must have major implications<br />
for the States as well as for the Federal Government. As<br />
governments we all have an important role to play in the fight / 4 </p>
<p>against inflation.<br />
Clearly, expenditure restraint in our own Budget will affect<br />
the States. I am sure you will understand , that it will not<br />
be possible to transfer additional funds to the States<br />
this year, beyond those which have already been committed.<br />
There is simply no more to spend, given that we are confronting<br />
the largest FederAl deficit in Australia's history. Further,<br />
with-the same objectives in view, we cannot support any<br />
increases in the borrowing programmes of the States or their<br />
authorities.<br />
At the same time, it is the very strong belief of the Federal<br />
Government that the States should have greater flexibility<br />
in ordering their own priorities. The excessive centralisation<br />
of power in the Federal Government has led to unnecessary duplicatio.<br />
in administration.<br />
Excessiv,. e centralisation has made it more difficult for the States<br />
to respond to local needs as they see fit. The attempt of the<br />
Federal Government to direct in detail State and local programmes<br />
is part of the same attitude of mind which has led to the attempt<br />
by Government to control more and more of the nation's resources.<br />
Both reflect the view that all wisdom resides in a few at the<br />
Centre. We are now suffering the consequences of this attitude.<br />
' end not merely to encourage individual and company<br />
activity. our aim is to strengthen the independence and<br />
flexibility of State and local Governments.<br />
We will1 be -xrumning the p~ ossibility of absorbing specific<br />
purpose funds into general purpose funds, and of reducing<br />
the degree of Commonwealth supervision of detail in specific<br />
purpose grants.<br />
The States will have the ability to provide the truly essential<br />
community services and facilities for which they and their<br />
. authorities are responsible. In the longer term our policy<br />
on Federal-State relations amounts to a whole new philosophy<br />
of the relationships between the different spheres of government. </p>
<p>Each sphere of government should make decisions on matters<br />
appropriate to it. Matters of proper concern to more than<br />
one sphere should be decided through a process of genuine<br />
consultation and cooperation. There are many matters where the<br />
appropriate information, the readiest access to government<br />
by individuals and groups affected, the greatest opportunities<br />
for administrative efficiency and effectiveness, are in the local<br />
of State spheres.<br />
In these matters local and State Governments must have the<br />
necessary capacity to act as they believe best. Federalism<br />
in Australia must be made to work. It is an essential feature<br />
of good and responsible government. The core of our approach is<br />
the principle of tax-sharing.<br />
A statement is being circulated setting out in brief terms<br />
the essential elements of the scheme. We would like to receive<br />
Premiers' reactions to the basic elements of the scheme, as well<br />
as suggestions on particular points and procedures which might<br />
be followed to pursue the matter further.<br />
I hope that at the end of this conference we will be in agreement<br />
on what the next steps should be. We want to act in this<br />
area as quickly as practicabler consistent with a thorough<br />
examiniation of all the complex issues involved. Our<br />
proposals, of course, include specific arrangements for funding<br />
loc i government on a guaranteed and continuing basis.<br />
We are determined to begin implementing a new scheme for local<br />
government assistance in 1976.77.<br />
ThE rne. ssicy of inprovi: ig relations between the levels of<br />
Government will be further met by the establishment of the<br />
Council for Inter-governmental Relations. </p>
<p>I confirm our comxnittment to the establishment of this body.<br />
It is high time that government put its house in order.<br />
It is up to us to give the lead in restraint. But government<br />
alone, without the whole hearted support of the people,<br />
will not be able to restore prosperity. Restraints in<br />
government must be matched by restraint in the rest of the<br />
community.<br />
Last week we were confronted with a very difficult decision in<br />
the face of the huge increasq in the C. P. I. in the December<br />
quarter. After considering all the issues we decided, in the<br />
grave economic conditions that exist, we had no responsible<br />
choice other than to argue that the commission should not<br />
carry through into its awards at this stage, the large prices<br />
increases which have occurred. We expected to be criticised<br />
for this decision -and we have been. It was a very difficult<br />
decision. We have concluded that a revival of confidence am~ ong both<br />
consumerF and private enterprise depends principally on bringing<br />
infl. ation under con-trol. Consumer spending will revive when<br />
people are confident that inflation is under control. Pa-csing<br />
on the full price rises of.' the December quarter will only lead to<br />
further uncertainty about the direction of the economy<br />
about out. capacity to control inflation.<br />
The very things stopping businesses from investing are the same things<br />
discouraging people from spending anxiety about the future.<br />
Australians have seen every increase in wages in recent years<br />
erodt.:.. tri. T'. 6 are noi. t deluded into tlhi-king that yet<br />
further turn of the spiral will really make them better off.<br />
The previous government attempted to revive consumer spending<br />
by tax concessions, without success. It is nc use applying<br />
the criteria and judgement of 1930' s Keynesian theory to the<br />
economy of 1976. The problems are not the same. The remedies<br />
cannot be the same. We will do whatever we believe is<br />
necessary to over come inflation. </p>
<p>7.<br />
eñ ive the Australian people recognise the serixousness<br />
of the situation and that they will suprt. c-us.<br />
The'y will know that dif ficult -thcugh the deCision. N! aswe<br />
