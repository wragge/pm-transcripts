    <content><![CDATA[<p>The global financial system is experiencing its most significant upheaval since the Great Depression.</p>
<p>More than 25 banks around the world have failed or been bailed out. Global stock markets have suffered significant losses.</p>
<p>The crisis has buffeted confidence around the world and is contributing to a serious slowdown in the global economy.</p>
<p>The International Monetary Fund now expects growth of less than 1 per cent in six of the world's largest developed economies next year.</p>
<p>This will be the slowest growth in the advanced economies for over a quarter of a century.</p>
<p>Australia is not immune from these developments, but we are in a much better position to weather the storm than many other countries.</p>

<p>In the May Budget, the Government was acutely aware of the risks posed by turbulence in global financial markets.</p>
<p>The Budget forecast that problems abroad would slow the Australian economy and impact on employment. This was against the backdrop of already high domestic interest rates and inflation.</p>
<p>In recent weeks the global financial crisis entered a new and dangerous phase, with inevitable consequences for the Australian economy. </p>
<p>The Rudd Government is determined to take decisive action to strengthen growth and protect Australians from the fall-out from the global financial crisis.</p>
<p>The Government has moved quickly to alleviate pressures in the Australian financial sector through its guarantee to Australian depositors and wholesale funding to ensure it remains globally competitive.</p>
<p>The Government is working closely with other governments around the world to address the global financial crisis.</p>
<p>The Government is now taking decisive action, delivering a $10.4 billion Economic Security Strategy to strengthen the Australian economy and support Australian households through these difficult times.</p>
<p>The package specifically bolsters recent weaker growth in household consumption and housing, and provides much-needed assistance to Australian pensioners and families.</p>
<p>The Government is also accelerating the implementation of projects to be funded through the three Nation Building Funds announced in the Budget to strengthen our economy.</p>
<p>The Government took the tough decisions in the Budget to build a strong surplus to act as a buffer in an economic slowdown. This is now providing the flexibility to respond to the dramatic deterioration in the global economy.</p>
<p>The Economic Security Strategy will complement the Reserve Bank's recent moves to reduce official interest rates. It also builds on the measures the Rudd Government announced in the 2008-09 Budget.</p>
<p>Treasury advises that the Budget will be in surplus after these measures. The Government will publish a full budget update in the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook to be released within a month.</p>
<p>All advice currently available to the Rudd Government is that the Australian economy will continue to experience positive economic growth.</p>
