    <content><![CDATA[<p>PRIME MINISTER<br />CHECK{ AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />SPEECH BY PRIME MINISTER<br />PARLIAMENTARY DINNER GIVEN IN HONOUR OF PRESIDENT HAGLELGAM<br />OF THE FEDERATED STATES OF MICRONESIA<br />CANBERRA 13 OCTOBER 1988<br />President Haglelgam,<br />Secretary for External Affairs Amaraich,<br />Secretary for Transportation Weilbacher,<br />Secretary for Human Resources Preterick,<br />Distinguished Guests,<br />Ladies and Gentlemen.<br />I am delighted to welcome President Haglelgam and the<br />distinguished members of his party to Australia and, in<br />particular, to our national capital in this, the year of<br />Au ' stralia's Bicentenary. This is your first visit to<br />Australia indeed it is I believe your first State visit<br />abroad. We are honoured that this should be so and you can<br />be assured you are welcome guests here.<br />Your visit today along with the visits by the heads of<br />government of other South Pacific States have played a<br />most important part in the celebrations of our Bicentenary.<br />They have served to remind us that, while we are celebrating<br />the two hundredth anniversary of European settlement in this<br />country, Australia is undeniably a nation of the<br />Asia/ Pacific region. This is where our future lies. Your<br />presence here today underscores this fundamentally important<br />geo-political reality.<br />In July of last year, Australia became the first country to<br />establish diplomatic relations with the Federated States of<br />Micronesia. In presenting his credentials to you at that<br />time, Mr President, our minister remarked on how much we<br />looked forward to working with you in the future as your<br />country took its rightful place at international tables.<br />And this, I am proud to be able to say, we have done.<br />Although your country lies mostly to the north of the<br />equator, in your history and your culture and in the kinds<br />of challenges and issues you face as a nation, you have much<br />in common with the Pacific countries south of the equator. 2 6 ) 53</p>
<p>Through the negotiation of the Law of the Sea Convention<br />and, since then, in particular through the South Pacific Mr F<br />Commission and the South Pacific Forum, our two countries well<br />have worked closely and constructively together. We were Gove<br />pleased to be able to assist your entry to the Forum in chal<br />1987, and it was a pleasure for me to be able to work with Mict<br />you again at this year's Forum meeting in Nuku'alofa. Aust<br />Your representatives have also played valuable roles in the<br />fisheries negotiations with the United States, and are<br />remembered too for their close interest in the negotiation<br />of the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty.<br />Mr President, Australia and the Federated States of<br />Micronesia clearly enjoy a friendly and productive dialogue<br />on a wide range of issues. As your involvement in regional<br />affairs continues to grow, we will find ourselves working<br />ever more closely together in meeting the challenges that we<br />share with other Pacific Island countries, We look forward<br />through those contacts to getting to know you and your<br />people as well as we have come to know our closer regional<br />neighbours. When we undertook, on opening diplomatic relations with your<br />country in 1987, to work with you in meeting the challenges<br />which lay ahead, we were most conscious of the existing<br />record of cooperation between us. We resolved then to build<br />on the foundations of economic assistance which had been<br />laid with our modest program of Australian Government<br />training awards. Good progress has been made in the past<br />year in meeting this commitment.<br />At the same time, some steps have been taken to identify and<br />foster commercial contacts between Australia and the<br />Federated States. The absence of a regular shipping service<br />remains a problem, but I hope that, with the help of the<br />South Pacific Trade Commission in Sydney and through the<br />continuing discussions about the possible extension of Forum<br />shipping line services, a satisfactory resolution can be<br />found. In all of this we have been cognisant of the overwhelming<br />importance to you of your relationship with the United,<br />States. We are confident that we can effectively complement<br />the assistance that the United States gives to your country.<br />A clear example is in the provision of a patrol boat to<br />augment your capacity to get the best out of your maritime<br />resources.. We look forward to working with you on that<br />project.<br />We are pleased to have the opportunity over the next week or<br />so to show you some of our country. The distances are great<br />but that won't surprise you Micronesians, I'm sure, are<br />well accustomed to travel.<br />2694.</p>
