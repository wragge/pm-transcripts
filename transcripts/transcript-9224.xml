TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH FRAN KELLY, ABC RADIO " AM" PROGRAM,<br />
WEDNESDAY, 11 MAY 1994<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
FK: Prime Minister, no new taxes, that sounds like a slogan say, for a preelection<br />
Budget, is this an omen?<br />
PM: No, it's not an omen. This is a Budget which builds on the changes<br />
which we have made in this country and in budgetary terms over many<br />
years and it is a Budget basically set up for growth and jobs. We've<br />
got the economy growing at about 4.5 per cent; we've already grown at<br />
4 per cent in the year to March; we'll accelerate to about 4.5 per cent;<br />
we are predicting 3 per cent emrn poyrpent growth, which is just under<br />
250,000 jobs and all in the context of the deficit coming back and<br />
winding down to the 1 per cent or actually noW, better than 1 per cent<br />
forecast as a deficit for 1996-1997.<br />
EK: Well, you've delivered a deficit figure to the markets, what if they don't<br />
buy it, what will you do then?<br />
PM: I think market reaction so far has been pretty good. The long bond<br />
rate dropped back a bit, I think, during the course of the day and<br />
tentative signs from market commentators have been not too bad. The<br />
fact is that the Budget is well predicated and premised. That is, the<br />
revenue is coming from growth which is built on growth in employment<br />
and a growth pick-up in average weekly earnings.<br />
FK: The Treasurer said the Government will use monetary policy to keep<br />
the inflation. figure in check. Will there be a rise in-iri-r-t rates this<br />
year as part of your economic strategy?<br />
PM: Certainly not because of the Budget and I don't think there is any<br />
cause at this point in time why interest rates should rise. One can<br />
never say interest rates will never rise, but that is the very point of<br />
having a monetary policy. But, with growth of this order and low </p>
<p>inflation in prospect remember Fran we've just had the inflation rate<br />
for the quarter at 1.9 per cent; we've got it in the Budget at 2 and 1/ 4<br />
per cent for the coming year, so we've very subdued inflation which is<br />
a very good sign for interest rates.<br />
FK: You could have reduced the deficit further and faster, instead you<br />
chose to deliver a Budget with no tax increases and minimal spending<br />
cuts. Why such a benign Budget?<br />
PM: Because I think it is not a matter of being benign. One doesn't go out<br />
of ones way to say, bang up taxes. I mean, we gave tax cuts late last<br />
year which is another election promise fulfilled. This Budget fulfils with<br />
the White Paper many of the election promises we made to introduce<br />
those tax cuts which have now been paid; to introduce the Mabo<br />
legislation which has now been done; to bring up the unemployed and<br />
deal with that through the White Paper which we have now announced<br />
and in this Budget to produce the jobs we said would be produced and<br />
the growth as well as doing a lot of other important things. There is<br />
billion over ten years for the Aboriginal Land Fund for those who<br />
won't secure benefits from Mabo; there is $ 500 million over five years<br />
for Aboriginal health and Aboriginal health programs; there is $ 209<br />
million'over four years for breast cancer; $ 135 million over six years<br />
for the preparation of our Olympic athletes for the Sydney 2000<br />
Olympics; an increase in foreign aid, but we have done ail that within<br />
the context of falling, over time now to 1996-97, falling outlays to GOP.<br />
EK: You've also done all of it though, mostly, from the growth dividend.<br />
Why did you choose not to take the harder path, but in fact people<br />
have probably been expecting, given last years Budget, a few more<br />
spending cuts?<br />
PM: The growth dividend so called, there should always be a dividend from<br />
faster rate of growth, faster employment growth, better company<br />
profits, more people in work and we made a judgement a week ago or<br />
a couple of months ago that the White Paper and the efficiency<br />
effects, the broad economic efficiency effects of getting 350,000 longterm<br />
unemployed people back to work and case managing young<br />
people under 18 years of age and setting up better linkages between<br />
school and work were both more efficient things to do, were things<br />
that should have been done in equity terms and we've done that. And,<br />
even in the doing of it we've still got the Budget deficit down at $ 11.7<br />
billion 2.5 per cent of GDP, actually lower than we forecast for this<br />
year last year.<br />
FK: The Opposition says you are fudging your figures, though. You are<br />
including asset sales to fund general recurrent spending. Is this a..<br />
are you selling off the family silver as they say?<br />
PM: Look, that is just absolute nonsense. Outlays growth this year is less<br />
than GDP growth. Outlays growth is 3.1 per cent. If you wash the </p>
<p>asset sales out of it, it is 2.9 per cent: 2.9 per cent as again from 3.1<br />
per cent. Look, the Liberals in the House listening to the Treasurer<br />
deliver the Budget, I'm sure if somebody had stood up and said at the<br />
end of it, I move that the Liberal Party wind up, it would have got a<br />
majority of people. They looked so dispirited. Some wag yelled out<br />
' let's get the smelling salts out'. They have got nothing to say about<br />
this Budget. It is strong on growth, it is strong in employment, it has<br />
got the deficit coming down, it's got outlays running at less than the<br />
rate of GDP, it's got no tax increases, it's forecasting strong business<br />
investment and yet it is consolidating the White Paper changes and<br />
doing all those other things I mentioned as well.<br />
FK It is counting in though, the selling off of Qantas. You have been<br />
trying to sell Qantas now for the past two years, ' what makes you so<br />
sure you are going to sell it this time?<br />
PM: We can sell Qantas, it is just a matter of when we choose to go to the<br />
market. At a time of maximum opportunity for the Government.<br />
FK And that time is now?<br />
PM: We think it is in the course of this coming financial year.<br />
FK You've given $ 1.5 billion to the Aboriginal Land Fund over ten years in<br />
this Budget, but there is no mention of who is going to run it. How will<br />
it be run?<br />
PM: There is a structure there we are considering, but we've also got to<br />
have further consultations with the Aboriginal community about that.<br />
But, for this year we have allocated $ 200 million. It will be a revolving<br />
fund, a proportion of that will be spent on land, but a high proportion<br />
will be retained and it will be the earnings of the fund in the long run<br />
that actually pays for new acquisitions.<br />
FK: But will the Prime Minister's department want to hang on to control of<br />
that spending?<br />
PM: It will be set up under the auspices of the A TSIC Act, but the express<br />
structure, it will probably have a couple of functions. One will be<br />
financial management of the funds that's the funds management side,<br />
because it will be the accrual of earnings on the fund which will matter<br />
for land acquisition and there will be a property management and<br />
property acquisition side.<br />
FK Will this Budget be held up in the Senate again or did you deliberately<br />
avoid tax increases to avoid the minor parties having the power to hold<br />
over you again.<br />
PM: No, but the fact is we gave tax cuts as promised and what is the point<br />
then of coming this year simply to produce an even lower deficit, of </p>
<p>lifting tax? We made a judgement about that, it has got nought to do<br />
with the minor parties in the Senate and, I think, many of the things<br />
that we are doing on Aboriginal health and the Land Fund and national<br />
Asian languages program, homelessness, mental health, breast<br />
cancer, medical research, child immunisation, are all things which I<br />
think probably the Greens and the Democrats would approve of.<br />
FK So you don't expect them to hold it up?<br />
PM: No, I don't.<br />
FK: What about, you mentioned the tax cuts that you've delivered. There<br />
is a second round of tax cuts promised. There is no mention of them<br />
in this Budget, when will people get that second round of tax cuts?<br />
PM: I said this at the Press Club about a year ago. I said that they would<br />
be considered for payment in the latter part of the 1990s, probably<br />
1998. Now, the Government can make a judgement about that closer<br />
to the time.<br />
FK But, they will get them eventually?<br />
PM: I said so and it will be a judgement which, I said it in terms that if fiscal<br />
conditions permit. That is, if the growth in the economy, the<br />
investment phase, the cycle we're in then permits their payment.<br />
FK: But the guarantee of them eventually being paid is still there?<br />
PM: It sits on the words I've said very clearly a year ago.<br />
FK Prime Minister, thank you.<br />
PM: Good Fran.<br />
ends </p>
