ADDRESS BY PRIME MINISTER AT THE AUSTRALIA DAY CEREMONY, SYDNEY<br />
Today we are celebrating the 189th anniversary of the foundation.<br />
of Australia by Captain Arthur Ph-illip. Since that impoverished<br />
penal colony struggled to survive in an inhospitable and isolated<br />
l'and, successive generations of Australians have faced great<br />
challenges and worked together to surmount them. Men and women<br />
from all the world's nations have made their home in Australia<br />
seeking in their own way to build a better life for themselves<br />
and their children.<br />
Australia has been a refuge for those who have been dis-olaced<br />
by war, a free society for those escaping from oppressive regimes,<br />
a land of equality and opportunity where class distinction is<br />
abhorrent, and where the racial, political and class conflicts<br />
which divide many less fortunate societies are absent.<br />
We as a people have the greatest opportunity that a nati. on<br />
could ask for. We have the opportunity to use our national<br />
resources and our national capacities to create a better society,<br />
to deal with the problems of poverty, ignorance and inequity which<br />
unfortunately still exist in our nation.<br />
But too many people take the well being of Australia for granted,<br />
believing that it does not require effort or contribution. They<br />
take for granted the opportunity, the freedom, the material and<br />
political equality, and the precious if imperfect, democratic<br />
processes that characterise our society. There is an inadequate<br />
understanding of the fact that democracy is not only the greatest<br />
enterprise in human freedom, but also the most fragile. We must<br />
face this fact and confront the challenges to our democratic<br />
system lest this greatest enterprise in human freedom fail.<br />
One of the problems confronting us today is the expectation of<br />
some people that they are entitled to get whatever they demand,<br />
regardless of the impact of their demands on other people. When<br />
this expectation is frustrated, they assert the right to inconvenience<br />
the whole community. Such expectations are both<br />
irrational and incompatible with our democratic processes.<br />
Yet is not this just what too many have come to expect from<br />
Australia. This expectation takes many forms. People expect<br />
higher wages, no matter what the consequences for-the economy<br />
and the effect on other people. They fail to point out that<br />
other weaker groups must suffer to pay for their demands; that<br />
/ at any </p>
<p>-2<br />
at any single point in time, if one group gets more, other<br />
weaker groups must get less. One group most affected by this<br />
process is the unemployed. Higher demands for wages have been<br />
satisfied at their expense.<br />
There is another way people demand more they ask Governments<br />
to provide more -subsidies, benefits and programmes regardless<br />
of the consequences, pretending that these demands cost nothing.<br />
Too of-ten, Governments have failed by pretending that they could<br />
provide without cost, and without limit, that programmes were free.<br />
Politicians and Governments neglected to point out that they had<br />
nothing of their own to give that their promises were to be<br />
paid for by taking money away from people such as yourselves<br />
by higher taxation or by inflation. People and Governments<br />
have * fed off one another's weaknesses. People have wanted more<br />
at no cost; Governimtents have sought popularity through promises.<br />
These two weaknesses pose a great threat to democracy. If -they<br />
are to be overcome people must develop a greater awareness of the<br />
things that Governments can and cannot do. People must question<br />
their own demands on Government. Governments must foster this<br />
awareness and tell the truth more plainly. When Governments<br />
promis ' e any programmes, they must make it plain that all the<br />
people of Australia must pay. The day of the cargo cult must<br />
be banished.<br />
On Australia Day 1977 le-t us all as Australians ask ourselves<br />
what are the values that cause us to cherish Australia. What<br />
makes us proud to be Australians. What are the values that<br />
have caused us to make this our home. Then let all of us<br />
those born here and overseas, ask what we have done in past<br />
years that has enhanced these values. What have we done that<br />
may have weakened them. or have we merely taken them for granted<br />
and not thought at all. Then, what do we intend for today and<br />
tomorrow, 1977 and beyond. Are we just going to take Australia<br />
for granted or will we dedicate ourselves to enhancing the<br />
values we all share and to working for the better Australia<br />
of which we all dream. </p>
