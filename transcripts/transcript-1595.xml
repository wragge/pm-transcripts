VISIT TO US, CANADA AND UK<br />
WASHINGTON, USA<br />
EXCHANGE OF TOASTS BETVWEEN PRESIDENT J OHNSON AND<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAROLD HOLT OF AUSTRALIA IN THE STATE<br />
DININGROOM OF THE VHITE HOUSE 1ST JUNE, 1967<br />
PRI SIDENT JOHNSON Prime Minister and Mrs. Holt, members of the<br />
Cabinet, members of the Diplomatic Corps, members of Congress, members<br />
of the Press, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen.<br />
Tonight we are fortunate to celebrate not one, but three very welcome<br />
visitors the Australian Prime Minister and his lady, and the first day of June.<br />
They make a very warm and happy combination. The Prime Minister and I<br />
have spent a very fruitful day with each other. We have been doing what comes<br />
naturally to each of us talking. Now, this evening, we have joined you at the<br />
table, if only to demonstrate a first law of politics man does not live by words<br />
alone. Prime Minister Holt, you and your gracious lady make this house a<br />
very happy one tonight. After dinner, we hope to repay you with some<br />
entertainment down the hall in the East Room. I think you will feel at home<br />
there. It is the room where we Americans indulge in something very close to<br />
an Australian blood sport but here in America, we call it a press conference.<br />
On those occasions, Mr. Prime Mdinister, I am often reminded of you for another<br />
reason. There always seems to be a boomerang loose in the East Room.<br />
So that is one privaie bond between us. It gives personal strength to<br />
the public ties that unite our two peoples. History already records our affection<br />
and our trust and the partnership and alliances they invigorate. It will some<br />
day record what the casual, the cynical, the doubting, the short-sighted, or the<br />
impatiently critical may miss. That is our shared success in helping to build<br />
a secure, stable, and prosperous new part of the world the new Asia.<br />
The nations of free Asia many of them new to independence have already<br />
turned a corner. They are determined that aggression will not turn them back<br />
and, Mr. Prime Mlinister, so are we.<br />
This climate of hope owes a great deal to an Australia that offers<br />
Asia an example of what freedom can mean. The free Asian need only look<br />
south to see his tomorrow. He will see an Australian Government, led and<br />
directed by a competent management, elected by the people, and devoted to<br />
the people's interests. He will see the free and vigorous Australian people<br />
-whose living standards are amon--the highest in the world who share widely<br />
intheir nation's wealth who hardly know any poverty at all and who are<br />
virtually each and every one of them employed who have the highest rate of<br />
home ownership to be found anywhere in the world.<br />
All Asia can see hope when they look at this happy land a land where<br />
government and private industry put the fruits of the earth to increasing good<br />
use for all, with the help of Ed Clark. As the Ambassador said to me for the<br />
last 13 days awaiting your arrival, ' Let us all look to tomorrow and when we<br />
look to tomorrow, let us look to Australia.'<br />
Let us honour the shining record and the promise of our good friends<br />
and our good partners the Australians. Ton~ ight, to those few we could crowd<br />
into this room and this is one dinner where we didn't get any rejections I<br />
ask each of you to toast one of their bravest and one of their best the Prime<br />
Minister of Australia. 2/ </p>
<p>7-2.<br />
PRIME MINISTER HOLT Mr President, Mrs Johnson, members of the<br />
Cong ress, the Cabin-et, the Diplomatic Corps, the judiciary, all the other<br />
many distinguished people who are here tonight.<br />
I am, of course, gravely handicapped by the fact that there has been a<br />
misfunction in this particular instrument. So the President either by accident<br />
or design has assured that I shall be speaking to you off the cuff. Frankly, I<br />
prefer it that way because when one speaks that way, one speaks from the heart.<br />
Tonight, my heart is very full. It is a great honor to the Australian people; it<br />
is a great honor to the Australian Prime Minister and his wife, and to his<br />
government to have a function tendered to him in this fashion and to hear as<br />
I have heard tonight the moving words which have come from the President<br />
of the most powerful, the mightiest, richest, strongest nation in the world.<br />
So I say ' Thank you, Mr. President as President of the United States.<br />
May I say thank you also to Lyndon Johnson and Mrs Johnson our warm<br />
and very dear friends. I feel that the friendship which has long existed, cemented<br />
in the comradeship of struggle in order to help others to achieve the liberties<br />
and the freedom towhich we all aspire that has developed between our two<br />
countries has been warmed by the growth of this friendship which has<br />
developed between Mr. and Mrs. Johnson and Mr. and Mrs. Holt. Long may it<br />
continue long after both of us have left the offices which we at present enjoy.<br />
Vie are honored by the presence of you all. I was impressed by the<br />
distinguished names that came before me as we received you together with the<br />
President and Mrs. Johnson in the receiving line this evening. I thought, how<br />
many Heads of Government could come to a-function such as this and find<br />
themselves among so many friends close friends some old friends, and<br />
some new friends. I don't know any people who make their friendships more'<br />
quickly and abide more deeply than the friendships that develop between the<br />
people of America and the people of Australia.<br />
You have kindly included in the record of music, which we delighted<br />
in this evenin-Y, the Australian tune some people have tried to make a<br />
national anthem out of it ' Waltzing Matilda'. WNell, it hardly rates that. But<br />
at least no Australian can hear ' Waltzing Matilda' without a beating of the<br />
heart and a quickening of the pulse. And Mrs. Hammerstein, who has almost<br />
been assimilated by you, stirred as that number came up.<br />
Now, M~ r. President, earlier today, we had this exchange of words<br />
to which you refer. I must acknowledge my gratitude and indebtedness to you<br />
for the very valuable talk we had together, and for the talks I had later with<br />
your distinguished and most able secretaries, Mr. Dean Rusk and Mr. Robert<br />
McNamara. The unfortunate thing about all this is we can't say a great deal<br />
about it. That, of course, is a large part of the value of these discussions.<br />
They are intimate discussions. reveal to each other what we think, what<br />
we know, in a way which could not be publicly disclosed without some difficulty or<br />
disadvantage in one direction or another. But it has its problems. The press,<br />
of course those people that meet you in this other room here Md prove<br />
difficult to you in my own country, they prove difficult to me are always<br />
anxious to know what it is we have had to say to each other.<br />
I recall it particularly, because you may recall that on the last time<br />
we met in this room, you had in the course of your speech a few words of<br />
verse. I found it a bit hard to draw on my limited repetoire at the time to come<br />
back with something that seemed appropriate. I was delighted to find that<br />
tonight you hadn't extended me even further by some fresh presentation of some<br />
classic tract from the beauties of English literature. But this was taken up by<br />
a cartoonist in my country perhaps struck by the fact that not much came out<br />
of our public communications and he drew a very graphic cartoon of yourself<br />
and myself under which he had me making this statement " We had a frank<br />
exchange of poems". .3/ </p>
<p>1 did come along tonight prepared in case you did slip one out quickly.<br />
It was three lines from, I think, ' Julius Caesar' by Shakespeare. I think it is<br />
relevant to our respective problems.<br />
' On such a full sea are we now afloat; and<br />
We must take the current when it serves,<br />
Or lose our ventures.<br />
That sums up, I think, Mr. President, where you and my country stand in<br />
relation to one of the most significant conflicts of modern history, a conflict<br />
in Vietnam, which to my mind, overshadows in significance even the topical<br />
and troublesome conflict which you see flaring up in the Middle East.<br />
The conflict in Vietnam is fundamental to the future of free men. It<br />
is a fine thing, that in the history of mankind, three Presidents of the United<br />
States from different branches of the politics of the United States a<br />
Republic President and two Democrats have seen that this was an issue<br />
between men to be free or men to be slaves.<br />
You are fighting the battle for men to be free. You, Mr. President,<br />
I believe will go down in history not because you took up that struggle which<br />
had been so clearly perceived by President Eisenhower and by President Kennedy,<br />
but because more clearly than any other leader of the European race, you<br />
have seen the Asia of tomorrow, the burgeoning, blossoming Asia of a new era,<br />
that you have seen and I believe I have seen for my country as I moved about<br />
it perhaps more than any other Head of Government not of Asian race himself.<br />
The last time we were here, we talked of this together and you said<br />
many things which were significant to the future, I believe, of mankind. Since<br />
then, I have had the opportunity to go through more countries of this area.<br />
Perhaps we shouldn't speak so much of Asia as if it were just a grouping that<br />
described a whole lot of people in much the same terms, because there are<br />
greater diversities of cultures, of traditions, of habits of life, of physical<br />
appearance, of outlooks, than are to be found anywhere else in the world but<br />
her hope. To my mind, the 20th century may have been the century of Europe,<br />
but the 21st century will be the century of Asia.<br />
If this be the case, it will be because an enlightened President of the<br />
United States of America saw that in the prospect that the people of Asia had<br />
to throw off the shackles of the past, to throw off the tribulation of the past, to<br />
poverty, to disease, to illiteracy, to hunger, to ill health, to all the things<br />
that have kept man bound through the centuriesand by modern technology, by<br />
principles of freedom, by the friendliness and encouragement and help that<br />
enlightened people in a modern age could bring to three-fifths of mankind, we<br />
have virtually transformed the world in which we live.<br />
This is the promise you hold out to us, Mr. President. I hope that<br />
with the courage of resolution you have shown in so many other directions, you<br />
and your people will have the courage, the resolution, and the vision to see<br />
this hope of mankind realized. Thank you for your friendship.<br />
May I say this final word. The President and I today were exchanging<br />
views as to how we approach the problems of life. I said, " Well, I like to<br />
base my philosophy on being fair, firm, forthright and friendly. He said,<br />
" My objectives are peace, progress and prosperity. I said, " Let's marry<br />
the two together and I think we have got it made.<br />
Thank you very much. V/;* hue you are on your feet, may I ask you to<br />
join me in a toast to the President of the United States of America, and<br />
VMr s. Johnson. </p>
