<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Australia's number one cricket supporter is on the line, Prime</p>
<p> Minister John Howard. Prime Minister, good morning.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>What about that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Fantastic. Can I say, I think the real sort of turning point for the</p>
<p> team and the thing that made last night possible in the first instance</p>
<p> and really sets us up to win on Sunday was Steve Waugh's century</p>
<p> in the encounter last weekend against South Africa.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think that is the best one-day innings I have seen not only for</p>
<p> the circumstances in which he batted but also the pressure that he</p>
<p> was under. And I'd like to join I'm sure millions of other</p>
<p> Australians in congratulating the team, in wishing them luck for Sunday.</p>
<p> I don't think everybody will be at work first thing on Monday</p>
<p> morning and I think everybody will understand that. But this has been</p>
<p> an extraordinary series and for sheer excitement you couldn't</p>
<p> beat last night. And you couldn't, I think, beat  you couldn't</p>
<p> but feel enormous admiration for our team because they were being</p>
<p> bucketed, they were being written off and to win all of those games</p>
<p> in a row  and only a couple of weeks ago people were talking</p>
<p> about them being out of the final six and certainly not in the semi-final.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>When Herschelle Gibbs dropped that catch, Steven said to him, because</p>
<p> they'd been sledging one another, Steven said to him, you've</p>
<p> just dropped the World Cup.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>And I agreed with what he just said a moment ago that the ball that</p>
<p> bowled Gibbs last night was a fantastic ball and I think psychologically</p>
<p> that would have had an enormous impact on the result last night.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>So the Prime Minister's feeling a bit dusty, he's been up</p>
<p> all night too.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I'm very tired.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Very tired. Well look, I'm going to tire you a little bit more</p>
<p> because now to the tough stuff. It is a quadrella now in Industrial</p>
<p> Relations  Cobar last year, Woodland Lawn, Austel Pacific last</p>
<p> year, now Oakdale. How many more companies will go under leaving employees</p>
<p> in the lurch before someone tells employers this can't happen?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I can't answer that but I can say that we are already discussing</p>
<p> with the States changes with to the Corporations Law to deal with</p>
<p> companies that arrange their affairs to defeat their obligations to</p>
<p> employees. We are, in relation to the latest one, we are asking the</p>
<p> Securities Commission to investigate whether there has been a breach</p>
<p> of the securities law. I don't allege that there has but I'm</p>
<p> asking, the Government is asking that that be investigated. And you</p>
<p> will remember that in relation to Cobar we ended recovering a great</p>
<p> bulk of the money that was owing to the men as a result of action</p>
<p> being taken by the Securities Commission to chase the company. And,</p>
<p> I mean, you are right in saying that in relation to Cobar they were</p>
<p> left in the lurch at the beginning but as a result of action taken</p>
<p> by the Government 85 to 90 per cent of the money outstanding to them</p>
<p> was recovered. And I wouldn't want your listeners to think that</p>
<p> that didn't occur.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>But I just want to make a point to you, because the CFMEU, the union,</p>
<p> and often they are quite militant people but on this one...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>[Inaudible]</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Quite, well let me just say to you, they've been campaigning</p>
<p> for some time to develop a structure where worker entitlements are</p>
<p> secure in the event of the collapse of a business and they say that</p>
<p> coal miners already enjoy protection of their long-service leave entitlements</p>
<p> by having a central fund...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>They do.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>...to which all coal companies are required to make a contribution.</p>
<p> Now, why wouldn't such a fund be available so that no workers'</p>
<p> entitlements will be lost or all workers' entitlements are protected?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we are going to discuss the feasibility of establishing that</p>
<p> sort of thing on a wider scale.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>But don't you reckon you're being a bit slow on this, I</p>
<p> mean...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, you can criticise. I mean, I mean I am very sympathetic to what</p>
<p> has happened to these men.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>But that won't pay the bills, will it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, no, it won't pay the bills. I accept that. And one of the</p>
<p> things that we're seeking to do is to investigate whether we</p>
<p> have any, there are any avenues of pursuit against the company. And</p>
<p> I'm not saying there are because...</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>The union tell me that Peter Reith's Department is trying to</p>
<p> dismantle the central long-service leave fund.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well look, can I just say, in relation to that, we're not going</p>
<p> to do things that are going to remove existing security for workers</p>
<p> in relation to their basic entitlements. Now, as to the ultimate impact</p>
<p> of other changes to the industrial relations law there, of course,</p>
<p> is a long running debate between the union movement and the Government</p>
<p> and it's probably not productive to go into that now...</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>No, but I mean, isn't this the business about the difference</p>
<p> between the workers and the employer at the end of the day is that</p>
<p> the employer makes a big quid, he can drive the Rolls Royce and have</p>
<p> the boat on the harbour and the holiday home in the south of France.</p>
<p> Now, he can't then say...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>They're not all [inaudible]</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>No, I know they don't but what I'm saying to you, if you'll</p>
<p> just bear with me, they are now saying that, oh well, we inherited</p>
<p> this problem and this was all part of the collapse of Clutha, all</p>
<p> those years ago, the Clutha Group in February 1995 and the subsequent</p>
<p> funding of a new $2 company to operate the Oakdale mine using employee</p>
<p> entitlements and the employees knew about all this. I mean, that's</p>
<p> surely not an employer defence, is it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I don't think that's an employer defence but I also</p>
<p> don't think it's a correct categorisation of every one of</p>
<p> these situations to talk about Rolls Royce's and the south of</p>
<p> France. I mean, many...</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Well, we're speaking metaphorically but I'm simply saying</p>
<p> that's being an owner and employer.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>But it also conveys an image that whenever a business goes broke the</p>
<p> proprietor of the business waltzes away with the money. I mean...</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Well, this bloke owns other coal mines [inaudible]</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>That is one of the reasons why we are asking the Securities Commission</p>
<p> to have a look at the matter. I make no judgements. And I remind you</p>
<p> again, in relation to the Cobar situation, that as a result of action</p>
<p> taken it was possible to recover a lot of the money that was owing</p>
<p> to the men. Now, I'm not saying that is going to be duplicated</p>
<p> in this case.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>But see, if you could have a central fund into which long-service</p>
<p> leave entitlements are paid, why can't you have a central fund</p>
<p> into which annual leave's paid and severance pay is paid and</p>
<p> retirement pay is paid? It's so simple.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, that is being examined at the present time. Now, there are pluses</p>
<p> and minuses. I know at the moment it sounds all plus but the more</p>
<p> money that small businesses are not able to invest in the day-to-day</p>
<p> running of their businesses the lesser will be their operations.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Oh yes, but it's not their money. I mean, your industrial laws,</p>
<p> that's employee money.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I know but the point I'm making, Alan, is that in reality because</p>
<p> of cashflow needs many companies, many firms actually use this money</p>
<p> for the day-to-day operations of their business...</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Shouldn't, shouldn't employ people if you can't pay</p>
<p> them.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I understand, I understand that but you often, quite rightly, argue</p>
<p> the case of business and commercial reality, I'm saying to you</p>
<p> that the business and commercial reality of many small firms is that</p>
<p> they need this cash for their day-to-day operations.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>But part of employing someone and going into business is knowing that</p>
<p> you must pay the wage plus.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>As long as you understand, and those who support such an approach</p>
<p> understand, that if you apply that kind of system in relation to all</p>
<p> of those entitlements you will have less money for small business</p>
<p> to invest in its operations.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>People listening to you would say it is not their money to invest.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No...</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>They are holding it in trust to the workers.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I understand that but I would say to them in reply, that is correct</p>
<p> but in reality what happens, because of the cashflow needs of small</p>
<p> businesses, they effectively use that in their day-to-day operations.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>So I can't afford to pay my electricity bill so I'll go</p>
<p> and take John Howard's weekly pay and that will help me pay the</p>
<p> electricity bill...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We're not talking about weekly pay here because...</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Well, the blokes would be better off taking it in one lump than having</p>
<p> all these appropriations put aside.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I mean, look Alan, I'm not disagreeing  I mean, you</p>
<p> are arguing a very strong case but I am pointing out to you the consequences</p>
<p> of it and that is a judgement that we will have to make and the community</p>
<p> will have to make.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>So what do we say to these miners right now, Prime Minister of Australia,</p>
<p> just have a good weekend?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I don't say that. I don't say that. I'd point out</p>
<p> to them that we are investigating the behaviour of the company. We've</p>
<p> asked the Securities Commission and I'm not making a judgement</p>
<p> that the company's done anything wrong at this stage. I don't</p>
<p> know enough of the circumstances. And as has happened in other cases</p>
<p> it could well be that as a consequence of that investigation something</p>
<p> will occur.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>When will the miners know?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I can't tell you that. I may be able to tell you that next time.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Is this urgent?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, it's certainly urgent...</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>While these people are being sacked you are having a dogfight in the</p>
<p> Parliament over Warren Entsch. I'm not suggesting it's of</p>
<p> your making but can you understand how the public see the misplaced</p>
<p> priorities...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I couldn't agree with you more on that. I mean, while the</p>
<p> Labor Party was raising Warren Entsch I was trying to get a decent</p>
<p> deal for Australia's lamb exporters by talking to President Clinton.</p>
<p> I mean, I couldn't agree with you more. That was a complete waste</p>
<p> of time. The man's not done anything dishonest. He's not</p>
<p> taken a penny. He's not taken the public down. He's not</p>
<p> doing anything wrong. He didn't try and use his position to win</p>
<p> that contract. I mean, it's an absolute load of nonsense.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>And can I also just say to you, and I know that you and Jenny Shipley</p>
<p> were doing excellent work in relation to the lamb issue...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I hope so, I'm not sure yet.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Well, you don't know. I mean, they are putting...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We don't know the outcome yet.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Well, they are putting American business and American farmers first</p>
<p> and perhaps we have to think some time down the future about doing</p>
<p> that as well. But could I even say something to you, that as all this</p>
<p> was going on are you aware, and I'm sure you're not, that</p>
<p> there could be up to 20,000 homes in hailstorm damaged Sydney that</p>
<p> will not have a roof over their heads before Christmas and when they</p>
<p> get a roof over them they will not then have a house underneath them</p>
<p> because what is underneath is unliveable? I'm just wondering</p>
<p> if the Prime Minister of Australia is aware of the appalling trauma</p>
<p> that these people are suffering and no one, not a person from Federal</p>
<p> Government, not a person from the New South Wales Government, has</p>
<p> actually stepped foot inside one of these homes.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, that's not right, I have.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>How, you couldn't possibly have set foot inside those homes.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, Alan, I'm sorry, I mean, I'm not making a big deal</p>
<p> of it but I actually visited the area the weekend after it occurred.</p>
<p> I know the area very well.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Do you know these people won't have a home to live in until after</p>
<p> Christmas?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yeah I know, but I mean, let's just...</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Okay, well you've been there.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I'm not saying I've got the answer to every one of the nation's</p>
<p> problems. But I mean, don't say to me that I haven't </p>
<p> nobody's set foot and the Prime Minister has. I mean, I'm</p>
<p> not saying that's the answer...</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Then I can't believe you wouldn't have been...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>[Inaudible]...in proportion.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>I can't believe you wouldn't have been moved.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I was and I was also...</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>To do what?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I was also tremendously, I was impressed by the, as always in these</p>
<p> situations, by the resilience and co-operative spirit of the people</p>
<p> that were involved.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>But they don't have a house, can you believe this, they don't</p>
<p> have a house until after Christmas? They won't have a roof until</p>
<p> Christmas if they're lucky. Now, under the roof there's</p>
<p> no home. These are Australians. This is not Kosovo or Macedonia.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I understand that Alan but I can't, I mean, no individual in</p>
<p> public office is responsible for natural disasters but what we are</p>
<p> responsible for...</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>For the response.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, the response  and I'm not trying to evade our responsibilities</p>
<p>  but the response is primarily at a State level as you know.</p>
<p> We offered the resources of the army from the very beginning and they</p>
<p> weren't taken up. And I'm not trying to score a political</p>
<p> point on that but I have to say in defence of the Government that</p>
<p> we were willing to do that. And all of the ordinary natural disaster</p>
<p> relief arrangements that come into operation on an occasion like this</p>
<p> were available and in operation. I am very much aware of the difficulty</p>
<p> in which those people are living. I've spoken to people who've</p>
<p> lived in that area. I'm very familiar with that area and as I</p>
<p> said earlier, I've visited it and I'm personally very conscious...</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>That's the rhetoric, where's the action? What are we doing,</p>
<p> what are we doing?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, in the great bulk of cases, as I am told, insurance claims are</p>
<p> being processed. There are some where are there are disputes and some</p>
<p> of those disputes arise from the fact that some people elected not</p>
<p> to take out insurance.</p>
