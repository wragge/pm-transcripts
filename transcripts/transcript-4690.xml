Interview with Laurie Power, 0/ 10 Network ' dApril 1978<br />
QUESTION: Mr Fraser, are you satisfied with the response you<br />
have had from the Japanese Prime Minister?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I think there's a remarkable degree of commonality<br />
in the general approach Japan and Australia have to the<br />
current economic situations in the world. I think we both<br />
know that what happens to Japan, what happens to Australia,<br />
very much depends on the general economic situation, and I've<br />
said before the purpose in coming here was to probe what<br />
countries, individually or collectively, might be able to<br />
do to achieve an expansion of markets. If we don't achieve<br />
that we're going to be lef t-at the end of this year with<br />
developed coutries arguing about the cut-off of existing<br />
markets, and increased tensions also between developed and<br />
developing countries.<br />
QUESTION: Can you tell us now what plan you put to Mr Fukuda?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The discussions are continuing, and as I<br />
think you know they've also been extended to take into account<br />
additional talks with Mr Ushiba, which will be taking place in<br />
almost a few moments time. I'm not really I think in a position<br />
to say what's going to reveal the nature of those disucssions<br />
before they take place. Australia does have views about what<br />
ought to happen at MTN, about what ought to happen in the North/<br />
South dialogue, the Common Fund. We've already taken actions,<br />
and publically announced those actions, to try and break the<br />
deadlocked that had occurred between what is called the " B Gop<br />
countries, largely the developed countries, and the group of<br />
77, the developing countries. About 10 days ago the Ministerial<br />
Meeting of all Commonwealth countries, over 30 countries wererepresented,<br />
broadly endoresed the view that Australia put.<br />
That included the developed countries of the Commonwealth and<br />
obviously the developing countries. I think in a sense that's<br />
an encouraging sign, because other developed countries in<br />
the Commonwealth moved, as I believe is a consequence of<br />
Australia's actions, but at the same time the developing<br />
countries didn't stick rigidly on their position. Because<br />
there has to be movement from both groups if there is to be<br />
agreement. We believe these matters need to be pushed with<br />
vigour. I'm also of course pointing out that at the MTN we<br />
must have agreements in relation to agriculture, and not just<br />
in relation to industrial goods. I think that's of vital<br />
importance to Australia, because industrial goods would cover<br />
about 40% of Japan, North America and Europe's exports, but<br />
only about 5% of our exports.<br />
QUESTION: Is there any chance of Mr Fukuda taking to Washington<br />
your plan, for discussion with President Carter?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Mr Fukuda will take his own views to Washington,<br />
aindif Australia needs to communicate with the United States<br />
we'd do it directly. So, I think it would be quite wrong if<br />
anyone got the view that I'm suggesting that Mr Fukuda should<br />
act as a go-between between ourselves and the United States.<br />
Also, in that context, the Vice-President will be in Australia<br />
very s hortl, and we'lX be putting whatever views we have<br />
very irectl to the Vice-President. I.%<br />
Jr; 71X,_ r. </p>

QUESTION: Did bilateral trade creep into the discussions at all?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No it did not, no.<br />
QUESTION: And what was Japan's attitude generally to freeing<br />
trade. One of their situations is to tighten exports at the<br />
moment, going in reverse.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well they're trying demonstrate voluntary<br />
restraint on exports, because they know the pressure that<br />
their exports have put other countries under. They're also<br />
trying to expand their imports in a very substantial way,<br />
hoping to reduce their trade surplus. I believe on the basis<br />
of what I've been told that Japan takes international responsibilities<br />
very seriously indeed, but the point needs to be made that<br />
there are responsibilities on all countries in this international<br />
environment, not just on the stronger countries such as Japan.<br />
There are also responsibilities on the weaker countries, and<br />
on the United States. But there are many things that nations<br />
can only do for themselves, and maybe in the past there has<br />
been too much emphasis on what the stronger can do, and not<br />
enough emphasis on what others should do. </p>
