Oni Friday, the Transport Worhers' Union rerloved the Iast<br />
bans on Q n4 s. Qantas employees had voted enrlier in<br />
the week to go back to work, and tile airline had been<br />
getting back to normal operations. But the res-idual bans<br />
W o~ f th e T;, rU -? ere still causing dIfficulties, and staff labour.<br />
was still baving to be used.<br />
NOw antas can proceed wthout distraction to try to make<br />
good the damage that hias been done although some of the<br />

* IQantas is a great airline that'is ow-nedl by the. Govarrnment on<br />
behalf of the people in iAv~ tralia. As I hava said arid<br />
cainot stress it too strongly it is time that Qantasl<br />
service to hopublic and to Austral,' a was put f irat. It is<br />
time for a I AutraLIjans to recogni~ e.-hat-our -widmental<br />
interests eire held in common.<br />
These irnterests are not competitive, but comple-mantary.<br />
Anyon--who seek! Is to dayiiage Qartas by groounding its aircraft<br />

or even j~ tto kutraliat s rep,-utation, but extends to the<br />
Ausitralian people ill it5 entirety.<br />
During the course of the dispute, the Government ordered<br />
the to lift p-assengers across the TaSTman and the<br />
