    <content><![CDATA[<p>Today I received the final report from the Religious Freedom Review Expert Panel examining whether Australian law adequately protects the human right to freedom of religion.</p>
<p>I would like to thank the Chair, the Hon. Philip Ruddock, and other members of the Panel for their work in exploring this important issue in such a comprehensive and respectful way.</p>
<p>I look forward to considering the report in detail and will consult with members of the Government before releasing it to the public and responding to its findings.</p>
<p>I have asked the Attorney-General, the Hon. Christian Porter MP, to lead the Governmentâ€™s deliberation and response to the report.</p>
<p>Again, I would like to thank the Panel for its work and the Australians who took the time to have their say on this important issue.</p>
