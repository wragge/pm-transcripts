FOR PRESS PM. NC. 3.33/ 967<br />
MESSAGE FROM PRESIDENT JOHNSON<br />
Following is the text of a message which was sent<br />
by President Johnson to the Frime Minister, the Rt. Hon. John McEwen<br />
" In Harold Holt's passing the free world has lost<br />
a courageous and far-seeing leader, and I have lost a<br />
comrade who was generous with the gift of a warm and wise<br />
heart. I found comfort in his friendship and strength in his<br />
partnership. He and the people for whom he spoke were<br />
always dependable and unshakeable. Those blessings remain<br />
as eternal as the sea which has taken him away.<br />
" Please convey to the Australian people my deep<br />
sense of personal loss, and my continued total dedication to<br />
the goals of Australian-American friendship and world peace<br />
for which Harold Holt laboured with such skill and devotiont<br />
