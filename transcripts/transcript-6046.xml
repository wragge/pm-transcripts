f ! t PARLIAMENT OF AUSTRALIA<br />
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER-DESIGNATE, MBOB HAWKE, M. P.<br />
Departmental Changes<br />
In considering the appropriate departmental structure, I have<br />
borne in mind the need to ensure that:<br />
the priorities of the Labor Government can be given effect'<br />
to readily;<br />
S changes from the existing structure are kept to the<br />
minimum necessary, so that the public service is not<br />
distracted from the important tasks facing it; and<br />
problem areas in the existing arrangements are remedied.<br />
The new departments to be created are:-<br />
S Housing and Construction<br />
S. Special Minister of State<br />
Sport, -Recreation and Tourism.<br />
The following departments will be renamed in view of significant<br />
changes of functions:-<br />
Education and Youth Affairs ( previously Education)<br />
Resources and Energy ( previously National Development<br />
and Energy)<br />
STerritories and Local Government ( previously Capital Territory)<br />
STrade ( previously Trade and Resources)<br />
Transport -( previously Transport and Construction)<br />
The functions of several other departments are also to be altered<br />
in varying degree. The Department of the Vice-President of the<br />
Executive Council will be abolished. / 2<br />
T V o 77 </p>
<p>Economic Policy<br />
The Taxation Office will be moved from the Treasurer's<br />
portfolio to the Minister for Finance, MrDawkins.<br />
This will enable the Treasurer, Mr Keating'. ? to concentrate<br />
more closely on overall economic management.<br />
The Treasurer will be responsible for the proposed<br />
price surveillance machinery, and also for the Grants<br />
Commission. Co-ordination of the prices and incomes policy will be<br />
the responsibility of the Minister for Employment and<br />
Industrial Relations ( Mr Willis) With these added<br />
resonibliie isen. ed appropriate to move Youth<br />
Affairs from Employment and Industrial Relations to<br />
Education, to ensure that proper attention can be devoted<br />
to policies affecting our youth.<br />
Industries<br />
The Minister for Industry and Commerce, Senator: Button,<br />
will assume responsibility for the Industries Assistance<br />
Commission and the Australian Industries Development<br />
Co~ rporation thus providing a single portfolio with the<br />
key industry responsibilities. Regional development<br />
will also go to Industry and Commerce.<br />
The Department of Housing and Construction, which was,<br />
abolished by the Fraser Government, will be reconstituted<br />
to provide a focus for policies affecting the housing<br />
and building industries, and housing assistance program.<br />
Responsibility for the important tourist industry will be<br />
a major focus of the new Department of Sport, Recreation<br />
and Tourism. ./ 3 </p>
<p>Resources an~ d Energy<br />
The current split of respon sibi li ties for minerals and<br />
resources policies between National Development and<br />
Energy and Trade and Resources is not sensible; it<br />
causes needless confusion and distraction from getting<br />
on with assisting the development of these important<br />
industries. All responsibilities for domestic resources<br />
and energy matters will be consolidated . in a Departmentof<br />
Resources and Energy. The Department of Trade will,<br />
of course, retain responsibility for assisting the private<br />
sector in the development of overseas markets for<br />
our mineral resources as it does for other commodities.<br />
Other Importwcant Changes<br />
The new portfolio of Special Minister of State, under<br />
Mr Young, who will also be Vice-President of the Executive<br />
Council and Leader of the House, will take over electoral<br />
matters and police and protective services and certain other<br />
policy functions from the Department of Administrative<br />
Services, which will be a more clearly focuss'ed ' common<br />
service' department. This change will also enable a greater<br />
concentration on important law enforcement responsibilities.<br />
The new Department of Sport, Recreation and Tourism takes<br />
over responsibility for assistance to sport from Home<br />
Affairs and Environment which, with the addition of<br />
responsibilities for consumer affairs to its arts and<br />
environment functions, can concentrate more closely on<br />
these important areas.<br />
As announced before the election, I will take responsibility<br />
for the Office of the Status of Women, assisted by Senator Ryan.<br />
/ 4<br />
I I </p>
<p>Although the Government will continue the Department of Defence<br />
Support, we have decided the defence science laboratories would<br />
be better located in Defence itself.<br />
The Government has decided that the Territories and important<br />
local government responsibilities of the Commonwealth should<br />
be located with the Department of the Capital Territory, as<br />
a Department of Territories and Local Government. With our<br />
commitment towards self-government in the a department<br />
solely with Capital Territory responsibilities no longer<br />
seems warranted.<br />
Heads of Departments<br />
Because of the processes required by legi-s-la-tion for the<br />
appointment of Heads of Departments-, legislation which the<br />
incoming Government will be reviewing, it is not possible<br />
to make final appointments of Heads of the new Departments<br />
tomorrow: nor to make any other consequent changes that the<br />
Government might have in mind. Acting Secretaries will therefore<br />
be appointed to the new Departments. The Chairman of the Public<br />
Service Board will be asked to report to me on appointments in<br />
accordance with the terms of the legislation and I expect that the<br />
complete list of appointments of Heads of Departments will be<br />
cleared in Cabinet next week. The Acting Secretaries of the new<br />
Departments, in addition to the appointments they currently<br />
hold, will he<br />
