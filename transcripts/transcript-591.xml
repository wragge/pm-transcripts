STA. TE BANQUE T AT PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA,<br />
IN HONOUR OF THEIR MAJESTIES THE KING AND<br />
2UB OF THAILAND<br />
2,8THAUGUST 1262~<br />
Speech by-the Prime Minister, Rt. Hon. R. G. Menzies<br />
Your Majesties, Your Excellencies, Your Serene Highnesses<br />
and Ladies and Gentlemen ( I call you all that, whether you<br />
come from the Senate or the House of Representatives)<br />
We have now come to that pleasant period of the<br />
Dinner when I am, and following me, Mr. Whl ' tlam, your<br />
humble instruments to offer some words of welcome to the<br />
King and Queen of Thailand. ( Applause)<br />
I must say, Your Majesties, that this seems to be<br />
an entirely unnecessary and almost iri'elevant performance<br />
because you have not had your experience in various parts of<br />
the world witnout realising that here, in the capital of<br />
Australia, you have received a welcome in the minds and hearts<br />
of all our people. ( Applause) And as a sense of welcome is<br />
far more a matter of feeling than words I don't need to<br />
elaborate. I am sure that I have some Idea as to how you<br />
feel. I -think I would like to say, on behalf of some<br />
of my colloagues at least, the travelling members of the<br />
Government, that we are infinitely grateful to you for<br />
iaving advanced your visit to Australia by a week so that,<br />
in the last few days and tomorrow, Tbhe Prime Minister and<br />
the Deputy Prime Minister and the Treasurer might have the<br />
opportunity of seeing you both, of welcoming you, because<br />
otherwise, the three of us to say nothing of anybody else,<br />
were bent on a journey to Lndon to discuss the scmewhat<br />
theological problem called the Common Market. ( Laughter).<br />
But I would like to tell all my Parliamentary colleagues that<br />
Their Majesties couldn't have been more kind or more understanding<br />
and they advanced their time by a week and the result<br />
is that those to whom I havu referred, including myself, will<br />
at any rate be able to bid farewell to them tomorrow in decent<br />
order and form and then as they travel to the less privileged<br />
parts of Australia ( Laughter), some of us will travel to what<br />
might or might not be the less privileged part of the Commonwealth.<br />
Anyhow it has worked out very happily.<br />
And I don't say that Your Majesties just beca use<br />
it has turned out to be convenient from our point of view.<br />
I myself, and I am su-, e my colleagues will agree with me,<br />
will always be delighted to think that our departure for<br />
London for this vastly important conference occurred at a<br />
time when we had had the great pleasure, the great opportunity<br />
for two or three days in Canberra of having some of your own<br />
charm brushed off on us so that we might take it with us as<br />
a happy memory. ( Applause).<br />
Itts very interesting to look back on recent history.<br />
I know that there are people in this Parliament, Your Majesty,<br />
well, I presented a number of them to you and said these were<br />
my opponents and I know that some of them think that really<br />
I've been here long enough ( Laughter) and this Your Majesty<br />
is a feeling I entirely share, but even an old doddering<br />
fellow like myself looking back over the last ten years, can<br />
realise what reoluhionary changes have come in the world.<br />
eo o/ </p>
<p>2<br />
The:' e was a time not so " Long ago when your country was known<br />
uo the ignorant outsiders as Siam when we looked at it and<br />
said, " Oh yes, tht' somewhere L Asia you know and<br />
long way away." I've come to realise very vividly<br />
that for me or for any other politician in Australia to<br />
tIVravel from here to Perth, all inside Australia, is only<br />
two or three hours less than travelling to Bangk~ ok. We<br />
have in the modern world in point of time become close<br />
neighbours and I am happy to believe.~ Your Majesties, that<br />
we have become close friends. ( Hear, hear) ( Applause),<br />
We are, of course, friends by treaty because we<br />
both subscribe to the South East Asia Treaty and it's a good<br />
thing to be a friend by treaty, but it's a better thing to<br />
be friends in the heart, in the spirit and in the mind.<br />
( Hear, hear) ( Applause).<br />
I was saying to myself last night, I think it<br />
was last night, you never know in Canberra ( Laughter) that<br />
we have all sorts of great things in common your ancient<br />
country our modern, new country we have wonderfuhl things<br />
in common, and the first of thq perhaps, is * T'hat we are both<br />
monarchies, ( Hear, hear) and, Sir, speaking tlo you, His<br />
Majesty the King and to you, Her Majesty the Queen, in this<br />
country I can say with no reservations whatever that just as<br />
in Australia we are all the Queen's men and women ( Applause)<br />
so in our country we are all delighted to see a King and<br />
a Lueen presiding over a country which has literally centuries<br />
of history behind it. And so, Sir, we have that and we have<br />
a love of peace, a profound love of peace in our hearts; we<br />
have, I believe I may say, a deep sense in both countries,<br />
though we occasionally affect to conceal it, a profound sense<br />
of spiritaal values. Neither you, nor your country nor this<br />
country has a prosaic dull belief that the only values in<br />
the world are material values, We share this with you,<br />
We share with you, though we haven't so many<br />
marvellous examples of it to our hand as you have, a love<br />
of beauty a nice kind of love to have, in a world that is<br />
so frequently ugly, ( Applause) And, Sir, as I suggested,<br />
we both have a sense of history; your history going back<br />
in your own country for, what, seven hundred yeors; our<br />
history going back in our own country for one hundred and<br />
fifty, near enough0 But going back beyond that, to a country<br />
whose roots are in the very soil of history, far removed as<br />
they were from you in point of space and at that time i~ n<br />
point of tirmes But when you come to Australia derived~ as<br />
we are from that old civilisation, the old faiths and the<br />
old loyalties you are coming to a country which, of all<br />
countries in this part of the world, is destined to undei-stard<br />
yours, to be friendly with yours and to look back, as we all<br />
will, on this Visit of yours as an occasion on which we met<br />
with great respect and profound affection two great people<br />
who were also our friends, ( Hear, hear) ( Applause),,<br />
Your Majesties, this is one of those precious<br />
occasions in Parliamentary history when there is unanimity<br />
on both sides of Parliament and I am going to ask my friend<br />
the Acting Leader of the Opposition, Mr. Vlhitlam, to support<br />
me. ( Applause). </p>
