PRIME MINISTER<br />
CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
PARLIAMENTARY LUNCHEON IN HONOUR OF THE<br />
PRIME MINISTER OF NEW ZEALAND<br />
CANBERRA 18 AUGUST 1988<br />
Prime Minister David Lange,<br />
Distinguished Guests,<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen.<br />
It is with the greatest pleasure, David, that I welcome you<br />
and Naomi to Australia. We attach great importance to this<br />
visit and we are especially pleased that you were determined<br />
to proceed with it despite your recent illness.<br />
I retain very warm memories of my visit to New Zealand last<br />
November. The enduring impression I brought home from that<br />
visit was of the many bonds of friendship that reach across<br />
the Tasman strong bonds that will be further strengthened<br />
by your visit.<br />
Australians and New Zealanders share much that is important:<br />
our democratic system of government, our commitment to<br />
personal freedoms, and not least, as proud bearers of the<br />
ANZAC tradition, our proven willingness to defend those<br />
freedoms when they are under attack.<br />
In politics, business, administration, the law, sport,-the<br />
arts in virtually all walks of life there is close,<br />
vital and daily exchange between us. In all these fields,<br />
the Australian community has been enriched over the years by<br />
the contribution of New Zealanders who have chosen to make<br />
their mark in Australian.<br />
Let me take this opportunity to say, Mr Prime Minister, that<br />
New Zealanders are and will remain very welcome new arrivals<br />
among us.<br />
it would perhaps be invidious to single out the achievements<br />
of particular individuals who have left. New Zealand to<br />
devote their energies and skills to life in Australia.<br />
But I should say that many Australians felt great sadness at<br />
the recent death of a great entertainer, a gem of the<br />
Australian stage, the late Ricky May.<br />
125 8 </p>
<p>Prime Minister,<br />
We in Australia have been especially pleased that New<br />
Zealand has joined so enthusiastically in our Bicentennial<br />
celebrations. The New Zealand pavilion at Expo has been one of the most<br />
popular exhibitions there. The queues outside the pavilion<br />
were so long at times that it would have been quicker to fly<br />
to New Zealand rather than wait to see the display at Expo<br />
but that didn't deter people from waiting to see the best of<br />
what you had to offer.<br />
AnSI all Australians will appreciate New Zealand's<br />
Bicentennial gift of the yacht ' Akarana' which will serve as<br />
a lasting reminder of our longstanding maritime links.<br />
One hundred years ago, the Akarana achieved the distinction<br />
of winning both the Melbourne and Sydney Centenary regattas.<br />
So this gift will also serve to remind Australians perhaps<br />
to our chagrin that New Zealanders have consistently<br />
excelled at sports in this country and have taken home more<br />
than a fair per capita share of sports trophies, not least<br />
Melbourne Cups.<br />
it is also very fitting that I mention in our new Parliament<br />
House that we are looking forward to the visit next week of<br />
the Deputy Speaker of the New Zealand Parliament who will be<br />
presenting to the Presiding officers the Distinguished<br />
Visitor's chair which will stand in the Senate.<br />
Prime minister,<br />
In all of these ways the strength of the friendship between<br />
Australia and New Zealand is proven.<br />
But we would be wrong to pretend that we agree on every<br />
issue, and we would probably be foolish to aspire to perfect<br />
agreement. In particular, Australia regrets the curtailing of New<br />
Zealand's defence links with the United States and we have<br />
made clear that we disagree with you on the issue which<br />
caused the break.<br />
We will continue our strong defence links with the United<br />
States as they underpin our defence policy.<br />
However, we are also determined that our defence links with<br />
New Zealand continue and I want to take this opportunity to<br />
reaffirm the value we place on them.<br />
An increasing number of New Zealand military personnel are<br />
coming to Australia for training and there has been<br />
considerable expansion in the number of Australia-New<br />
Zealand joint exercises. 1259 </p>
<p>one of the most important expressions of the Trans-Tasman<br />
defence links is the ANZAC Ship Project, where our two<br />
Governments are proposing to construct twelve new surface<br />
combatants, four of which are planned for New Zealand and<br />
eight for Australia. The ANZAC Ship Project represents an<br />
affirmation of our strong view of the need for the<br />
Australian and New Zealand defence forces to be able to<br />
operate together when needed.<br />
Prime Minister,<br />
with the three agreements we have signed today the<br />
trans-Tasman relationship will become even more rewarding.<br />
we have achieved free trade in goods and we have created<br />
virtually a single Trans-Tasman market. From 1 July 1990,<br />
all goods will be able to be transported unhindered across<br />
the Tasman.<br />
We have achieved an agreement on trade in services which is<br />
probably the most advanced in the world. With only limited<br />
exceptions, it provides for the open trade of services<br />
between our two countries.<br />
With these two measures in place, there is no doubt that we<br />
will see a substantial expansion in the $ 3 billion trade<br />
between Australia and New Zealand.<br />
in addition, our agreements to look to greater harmonisation<br />
of business and competition law and take practical steps to<br />
align customs amd quarantine arrangements will mean a more<br />
consistent environment for business. It will encourage more<br />
business to be done across the Tasman and it will make<br />
existing business easier to do.<br />
Few countries could have negotiated so much in such a short<br />
time; that we have been successful is a testimony to the<br />
natural closeness of our two countries and the underlying<br />
goodwill and friendship that pervades our dealings.<br />
It is a testimony as well to the valuable role played by<br />
business communities on both sides of the Tasman and I talCe<br />
this opportunity to pay them my thanks.<br />
These new agreements also enhance our standing as advocates<br />
of a free and open multilateral trading system.<br />
It is vital that Australia and New Zealand continue to voice<br />
their support for multilateral solutions to the current<br />
problems in the global trading system. So it is a crucial'<br />
element of our CER arrangements that they do not constitute<br />
am exclusive trading bloc and that they do not seek to limit<br />
competition in markets on either side of the Tasman.<br />
1260 </p>
<p>Our close cooperation in the Cairns Group stands as a<br />
significant further example of our commitment to<br />
multilateralism. By joining with other nations committed to<br />
free and fair trading, we are attacking in the most<br />
constructive way possible the restrictions which threaten<br />
global agricultural trade.<br />
The Cairns Group has shown that though Australia and New<br />
Zealand might be relatively small nations in global terms,<br />
we can achieve important goals through a diligent commitment<br />
to multilateralism.<br />
Indeed, through active participation in international forums<br />
we have been able to exert a constructive influence across a<br />
range of important areas. Often Australia and New Zealand<br />
have been able to support each other in the promotion of our<br />
positions particularly for example in those multilateral<br />
organisations where we are working in the cause of nuclear<br />
non-proliferation and disarmament.<br />
Prime minister,<br />
In our own region the stability of the pait cannot now be so<br />
easily taken for granted. Both Australia and New Zealand<br />
must ensure they remain reliable and supportive neighbours<br />
to the island States of the South Pacific as they face the<br />
challenges of independent nationhood.<br />
Australia is proud of the flow of development assistance we<br />
are able to provide Pacific Island Governments. We look<br />
upon the achievement of the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone<br />
Treaty as one of our most significant regional policies.<br />
And we are active participants in regional political<br />
associations such as the South Pacific Forum.<br />
Both our countries share a common interest with other South<br />
Pacific countries in the strengthening of democratic<br />
institutions in the region. It is in our interest that the<br />
region remain free from major power tensions and rivalry.<br />
we need to be alert, and to do all we can to deter outside<br />
powers from exercising unacceptable influence in the region.<br />
Prime minister,<br />
In an uncertain world, the value of the resilient and<br />
constructive friendship between Australia and New Zealand<br />
can never be doubted. It must never be diminished.<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen,<br />
I propose a toast, to the enduring friendship between<br />
Australia and New Zealand. 1261<br />
