<p>Prime Minister Julia Gillard and PNG Prime Minister Peter O'Neill have today signed the Joint Declaration for a new Papua New Guinea-Australia Partnership, providing a framework for the contemporary bilateral relationship.</p>
<p>While our friendship and shared values remain constant, the relationship between Australia and Papua New Guinea has evolved significantly since prime ministers Bob Hawke and Paias Wingti signed the first Joint Declaration of Principles in 1987.</p>
<p>This Joint Partnership Declaration reflects the shift to a modern and dynamic partnership in which trade and economic links play an integral role, and our increasing cooperation in the region to promote stability and prosperity.</p>
