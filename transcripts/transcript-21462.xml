    <content><![CDATA[<p>It is a matter of public record that I did speak to Mr Mike Scrafton on the night of Wednesday 7 November 2001.  I told the House of Representatives of this in answer to a question on 19 February 2002, some 2Â« years ago.  I said in that answer that I had spoken to Mr Scrafton entirely about the video.  This was reported in the media the following day.</p>
<p> My sole purpose in ringing him on 7 November 2001 was to obtain his assessment of the video which he had just viewed.  He gave me a description of the video and expressed the view that it was inconclusive.</p>
<p> I decided that the video should be released.  This occurred the next day.</p>
<p> My answer to the House was given more than 2Â« years ago.  It has not been disputed by Mr Scrafton until now.  I have been informed that Mr Scrafton left the employ of the Public Service on 13 December 2003 ie. nine months ago.</p>
<p> It is also particularly relevant that on 14 December 2001, in an interview with Ms Jenny Bryant of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, who had been appointed to conduct a departmental inquiry into the matter at my request, Mr Scrafton said " ... that the Prime Minister rang him later that evening.  He said he spoke to the Prime Minister a couple of times that evening about the tape and informed him that it was inconclusive".</p>
<p> That was the only reference he made in the interview to his discussions with me on 7 November.  He did not refer to the matters mentioned under (b) and (c) in his letter to The Australian newspaper published today viz that the photographs had been of events on 8 October and that nobody in Defence believed any longer that children had been thrown overboard.</p>
<p> In a follow up question the Bryant Inquiry asked Mr Scrafton: "Do you recall being advised at any stage that there were no children among those in the water on the 7 October?"  To this question Mr Scrafton replied "No".</p>
<p> A record of the interview of 14 December 2001 was signed by Mr Scrafton on 3 January 2002.  His response to the above additional question as well as some other specific questions was also signed on 3 January 2002.</p>
<p>   Both of the documents signed by Mr Scrafton were made available to the Senate Inquiry.  These documents are attached.</p>
<p> I stand by the previous statements I have made on this matter.</p>
