EMBARG~ OED MIDNICIIT ? AEST 27 JTANUARY 1987<br />
1* SPEE0h BY THlE PRIME MINISTER<br />
AT DINNER GIVEN BY THlE PRIME MINISTER OF ISRAEL<br />
MR YITZHAK SHAMIR<br />
JERUSALEM, 27 JANUARY 1987<br />
MR PRIME MINISTER, DISTINGUISHED GUESTS<br />
TODAY 9IS AN HISTORIC OCCASION FOR AUSTRALIA AND5 ItRAtL ' AND<br />
A VERY IMPORTANT-ONE FOR.. ME.<br />
DURING 14Y EARLIER VISITS TO ISRAEL, I FORMED NOT ONLY CLOSE<br />
FRIENDSHIPS BUT ALSO A DEEP APPRECIATION OF THE GREAT<br />
ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE ISRAELI PEOPLE.<br />
IWAS THEREFORE ESPECIALLY PLEASED TO BE ABLE TO ACCEPT THE<br />
RENEWED INVITATION CONVEYED BY PRESIDENT HIERZOG DURING HIS<br />
SUCCESSFUL VISIT To AUSTRALIA LAST NOVEMBER.<br />
MlY VISIT TO ISRAEL IS THE FIRST BY AN AUSTRALIAN PRIME<br />
MINISTER. LIKE THAT OF PRESIDENT HERZOG To AUSTRALIA IT<br />
SYMBOLISES THE CLOSE AND WARM LINKS BETWEEN OUR PEOPLES.<br />
MR PRIME MINISTER<br />
AUSTRALIA HAS ALWAYS BEEN A FRIEND OF ISRAEL. </p>
<p>7 2.<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE AND, I MIGHT ADD, THE AUSTRALIAN LABOR<br />
PARTY, HAD A SPECIAL AFFINITY WITH ISRAEL FROM THE TIME OF YOUR<br />
ESTABLISHMENT, IN WHICH OUR THEN FOREIGN MINISTER, DR EVATT, a<br />
PLAYED AN IMPORTANT ROLE.<br />
-As-TOLD -PRES-I-DENT-HERZOG-JCANBERRA,-WE-ARE PROUDQFi. E<br />
FACT THAT THE FIRST " YES" VOTE FOR ISRAEL'S RIGHT TO EXIST<br />
WAS CAST BY AUSTRALIA AT THE DIRECTION OF THE CHIFLEY<br />
GOVERNMENT. THAT GOVERNMENT WAS ONE OF THE FIRST TO-EXTEND<br />
RECOGNITION TO THE NEW STATE OF ISRAEL.<br />
SO DESPITE THE GEOGRAPHIC DISTANCES WHICH SEPARATE US,<br />
AUSTRALIANS ARE DEEPLY COMMITTED TO YOUR WELFARE AND CLOSELY<br />
ATTENTIVE TO DEVELOPMENTS IN THE MIDDLE EAST.<br />
WE ARE CERTAINLY NOT A PARTY PRINCIPAL IN THE RESOLUTION OF<br />
THE ISSUES WHICH SEPARATE ISRAEL AND IJS.. NEIGHBOURS. YET<br />
WE ARE SENSITIVE TO THOSE ISSUES AND HAVE ENDORSED CLEARLY<br />
DEFINED PRINCIPLES WHICH WE BELIEVE CONTAIN THE ELEMENTS<br />
OF A PEACEFUL AND DURABLE RESOLUTION.<br />
WE REMAIN FUNDAMENTALLY COMMITTED TO THE SECURITY OF ISRAEL<br />
AND ITS RIGHT TO EXIST WITHIN SECURE AND RECOGNISED<br />
BOUNDARIES IN ACCORDANCE-WITH-SECURITY COUNCIL-RESOLUTIONS<br />
242 AND 338. . Q* </p>
<p>THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT BELIEVES THAT A RESOLUTION OF THE<br />
PALESTINIAN QUESTION IS CENTRAL TO ANY MIDDLE EAST<br />
SETTLEMENT. WE ACKNOWLEDGE THE RIGHT OF SELF-DETERMINATION FOR<br />
THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE, INCLUDING THE RIGHT, IF THEY SO CHOOSE,<br />
TO INDEPENDENCE AND THE POSSIBILITY OF ESTABLISHING THEIR OWN<br />
INDEPENDENT STATE.<br />
THAT POSSIBILITY WAS OPEN BEFORE 1967, BUT-AT THAT-TIME THERE<br />
WAS NO ACCEPTANCE OF THE CONCEPT OF A PALESTINIAN STATE WHICH<br />
DID NOT INVOLVE THE DISAPPEARANCE OF ISRAEL. THE WORLD<br />
KNOWS THAT ISRAEL IS NOT GOING TO DISAPPEAR.<br />
YOUR NEIGHBOURS WHO ARE PART OF MY ITINERARY, ACCEPT AND WORK<br />
WITHIN THE-FRAMEWORK OF THAT FACT. -EQUALLY, I BELIEVE, ON<br />
THE BASIS OF THE SAME FACT, ISRAEL MUST BE CONSTRUCTIVELY INVOLVED<br />
IN THE PROCESSES OF RESOLVING THE ASPIRATIONS OF THE PALESTINIAN<br />
PEOPLE.<br />
WE RECOGNISE THAT WHATEVER ARRANGEMENTS ARE FINALLY SETTLED<br />
WILL DEPEND ON DECISIONS INVOLVING THE PARTICIPATION AND<br />
AGREEMENT OF ALL PARTIES FONCERNEDI<br />
ONLY A FOOL COULD PRETEND THAT EASY SOLUTIONS EXIST. BUT THAT<br />
IS A REASON NOT FOR GIVING UP BUT FOR STRIVING HARDER.<br />
THE GOVERNMENT OF WHICH YOU WERE AN IMPORTANT MEMBER TOOK A<br />
MAJOR STEP IN THAT DIRECTION WHEN IN 1978 IT CONCLUDED THE CAMP<br />
DAVID ACCORDS AND IN 1979 SIGNED A PEACE TREATY WITH ITS<br />
SOUTHERN NEIGHBOUR, EGYPT. WE APPLAUD THE COURAGE AND FORESIGHT<br />
INVOLVED IN THAT DECISION. </p>
<p>WE WELCOME TOO, THE RECENT AGREEMENT BETWEEN ISRAEL AND EGYPT<br />
ON THE TERMS OF ARBITRATION FOR TABA. WE HOPE THAT THE<br />
RESOLUTION OF THIS LONG-STANDING DISPUTE WILL OPEN THE WAY<br />
FOR FURTHER IMPROVEMENT IN RELATIONS BETWEEN YOUR COUNTRIES.<br />
-THE-MEETI NG-BETWEEN-MR-PERES-AND-PR SI--N T-MUDB--R-N<br />
ALEXANDRIA LAST . SEPTEMBER__ G IVE. US -REASON-TO-. BE-OPTIMI-ST-I-C.<br />
AT THAT MEETING THE ISRAELI AND EGYPTIAN GOVERNMENTS ALSO<br />
DECLARED 1987 AS THE YEAR OF NEGOTIATIONS FOR PEACE. I LOOK<br />
FORWARD TO DISCUSSING WITH PRESIDENT MUBARAK NEXT WEEK HIS OWN<br />
PERCEPTIONS AS TO HOW THE PROCESS MIGHT BE DEVELOPED.<br />
As YOU KNOW, I HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS THESE MATTERS<br />
WITH KING HUSSEIN. AND OUR OWN DISCUSSIONS THIS AFTERNOON HAVE<br />
HELPED ME TO A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF THE ISRAELI POSITION<br />
ON THESE VITALLY IMPORTANT ISSUES.<br />
LOOKING AT THE MIDDLE EAST REGION AS A WHOLE, THE QUESTION OF<br />
THE PALESTINIANS IS NOT THE ONLY UNRESOLVED ISSUE WE CONFRONT.<br />
THE SITUATION IN LEBANON CONTINUES TO BE. A MATTER OF DEEP-CONCERN<br />
TO US ALL. WHAT WE ARE SEEING IS FAR MORE THAN A REGIONAL<br />
POLITICAL PROBLEM, IT IS A HUMAN TRAGEDY.<br />
WE WISH FOR A CESSATION OF THE DISTRUST AND VIOLENCE WHICH HAS<br />
WROUGHT SO MUCH HAVOC AND DISRUPTED THE LIVES OF SO MANY PEOPLE.<br />
IN SAYING THAT, I SPEAK NOT JUST FOR AUSTRALIANS OF LEBANESE<br />
ORIGIN BUT FOR ALL AUSTRALIANS. </p>
<p>IT IS OUR HOPE THAT THE GOVERNMENT OF LEBANON WILL BE ABLE<br />
TO RECONCILE DIFFERENCES AMONG THE MANY COMMUNITIES WHICH<br />
MAKE UP THE COMPLEX FABRIC OF LEBANON AND THAT IT WILL BE ABLE<br />
AGAIN TO EXTEND ITS AUTHORITY OVER THE WHOLE COUNTRY.<br />
THE OBJECTIVE SHOULD BE THE WITHDRAWAL OF ALL FOREIGN FORCES,<br />
EXCEPT THOSE FOREIGN FORCES WHICH ARE IN LEBANON AT-THE-REQUESTOF<br />
THE LEBANESE GOVERNMENT-AND-WHOSE-PRESENCE_ ISNECESSARY TO<br />
ALLOW THE DEVELOPMENT OF CONDITIONS WHICH CAN ALLOW SOCIAL,<br />
ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL STABILITY TO BE RE-ESTABLISHED WITHIN<br />
LEBANON AND THE AUTHORITY OF THE LEBANESE GOVERNMENT TO BE<br />
ASSERTED. MR PRIME MINISTER<br />
I AM VERY PLEASED THAT MY COLLEAGUES THE PRESIDENT OF THE<br />
SENATE AND THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES HAVE<br />
INVITED THE SPEAKER OF THE KNESSET TO LEAD AN ISRAELI<br />
PARLIAMENTARY DELEGATION TO AUSTRALIA.<br />
A NUMBER OF OUR MINISTERS HAVE VISITED ISRAEL AND-IENJOYED<br />
HEARING FROM THEM AT FIRST-HAND OF DEVELOPMENTS WHICH HAVE<br />
OCCURRED SINCE MY LAST VISIT.<br />
" I </p>
<p>6.<br />
I AM HAPPY TO SAY THAT THE AUSTRALIAN PARLIAMENT ON<br />
23 OCTOBER LAST CALLED FOR THE OVER-TURNING OF THE<br />
UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY RESOLUTION EQUATING<br />
ZIONISM WITH RACISM. I MIGHT ADD, WITH PRIDE, THAT IN<br />
A PARLIAMENT OFTEN NOTED MORE FOR ITS CONFRONTATION THAN<br />
CONSENSUS, THIS RESOLUTION WAS PASSED UNANIM-U LY.<br />
MR PRIME MINISTER<br />
14EXT YEAR BOTH OUR COUNTRIES WILL CELEBRATE IMPORTANT<br />
ANNIVERSARIES IT WILL BE 40 YEARS SINCE THE ESTABLISHMENT<br />
OF THE STATE OF ISRAEL AND 200 YEARS SINCE THE START OF<br />
EUROPEAN SETTLEMENT OF AUSTRALIA. DISCUSSIONS ARE WELL<br />
ADVANCED ON WAYS IN WHICH THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL AND<br />
AUSTRALIA CAN PARTICIPATE IN EACH OTHERS' CELEBRATIONS OF<br />
THOSE IMPORTANT EVENTS.<br />
FINALLY, SIR, I WOULD BE REMISS IF I FAILED TO MENTION<br />
AUSTRALIA'S SUBSTANTIAL JEWISH COMMUNITY, AND ITS<br />
INVALUABLE CONTRIBUTION TO OUR MULTICULTURAL NATION IN<br />
PRACTICALLY EVERY FIELD OF HUMAN ENDEAVOUR. THEY FORM A<br />
BRIDGE OF FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN AUSTRALIA AND ISRAEL.<br />
IT IS PERSONAL LINKS BETWEEN OUR PEOPLE WHICH WILL ACHIEVE<br />
MORE THAN GOVERNMENTS CAN IN FIRMING THE BONDS BETWEEN US. </p>
<p>7.<br />
I AM CONFIDENT WE CAN LOOK FORWARD TO THE FURTHER<br />
DEVELOPMENT OF THESE LINKS: THROUGH GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED<br />
ACTIVITIES CERTAINLY, BUT MORE ESPECIALLY THROUGH OUR<br />
UNIVERSITIES, OUR CULTURAL INSTITUTIONS, THROUGH SPORT,<br />
COMMERCIAL LINKS AND TOURISM.<br />
-I -IS MY HOPE THAT THE LINKS BETWEEN OUR PEOPLES AND THE-<br />
-CO-OPERATION BETWEEN _ OUR_ COUNTRIES CAN CONTINUE TO OUR<br />
MUTUAL ADVANTAGE.<br />
IT IS MY FIRM BELIEF THAT THEY WILL.<br />
MR PRIME MINISTER I<br />
MAY I NOW PROPOSE A TOAST TO THE GOVERNMENT OF ISRAEL AND<br />
TO THE CONTINUING FRIENDSHIP OF THE PEOPLES OF ISRAEL AND<br />
AUSTRALIA.<br />
