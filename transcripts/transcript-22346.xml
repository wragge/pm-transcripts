    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to announce that Australia will participate in the World Expo to be held in Shanghai in 2010.  Australia is well placed to contribute to the theme of the Shanghai Expo, 'Better City, Better Life', which focuses on the global growth of cities.</p>
<p>Australia's relationship with China has undergone a remarkable transformation over the last decade.  Our bilateral trade has increased rapidly, driven by the natural economic complementarities which recently saw the first shipments of Australian LNG to China.  Australia and China have also developed strong people-to-people links.  China is Australia's largest source of international students and our second largest source of migrants.</p>
<p> Australia looks forward to working closely with the Shanghai Organising Committee over the next four years to ensure Australia's contribution and the Shanghai Expo are a great success.</p>
