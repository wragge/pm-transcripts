TELEVISION INTERVIEW GIVEN BY THE<br />
PRIME MINISTER, MR. JOHN GORTON, FOR<br />
CHANNEL 10 NETWORK<br />
Recorded on 24 September for screening on 5 October 1969<br />
Interviewer: Michael Peterson<br />
Q. Prime Minister, what do you see as being the issues which<br />
will win and lose votes on October<br />
PM. I don't know what will win and lose votes but I think the<br />
issues that are important are the questions of the different approaches<br />
to defence by the Labor Party and ourselves defence and foreign affairs,<br />
the responsibility of the suggestions I made to the Australian people-as<br />
to how their general levels of living can be increased and their judgment<br />
as to whether wild irresponsible promises are made or sensible promises<br />
are made.<br />
Q. You speak of foreign affairs, do you see it as being as<br />
important as it was in 1966 Vietnam?<br />
PM. I don't think there will be the same concentration on the<br />
question of Vietnam as there was in 1966. I think the reasons why we<br />
went there were good and the reasons why we are there are good. This<br />
is not something that I would say encompassed the whole of the field of<br />
defence. The real differences as I see them are, for example, that the<br />
Opposition would reduce the size of our army by one-third because they<br />
would abolish National Service training. They would pull out the Navy,<br />
Air Force and Army from our association with Malaya and Singapore.<br />
They would, I think, weaken the ANZUS alliance by arguing in a<br />
pettifogging way about the establishment of bases in Australia for our<br />
joint defence. Matters of this kind, I think, are more important.<br />
Q. You are also completely on the opposite side of the fence<br />
to them with nuclear non-proliferation, aren't you?<br />
PM. Completely. We believe that we should not sign this<br />
treaty until we are assured that other countries have also all signed,<br />
and also that we have proper protection for Australia, something we<br />
can really rely on. I am shorthanding because there are other matters<br />
as to peaceful uses of nuclear energy, inspection of our defence sites<br />
and things of that kind. They would rush in to sign it straight away, and<br />
hope for the best for the future. That I think is the difference.<br />
Q. Still on defence the DLP bases a great deal of thinking<br />
on defence. Are you concerned in any way that the DLP might withdraw<br />
preferences? / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
PM. I would be disturbed. It would be a pity from our point<br />
of view if the DLP withdrew their preferences. But we can't tailor our<br />
policies to what any other party wants. I don't quite know how the DLP<br />
could with honour and principle support a party that would immediately<br />
withdraw all troops from Vietnam, that would immediately sign the<br />
Non-Proliferation Treaty, that would immediately withdraw all forces<br />
from Malaya, that would immediately abolish National Service training.<br />
It seems to me that these fly directly in the face of what they would<br />
expect to happen. But this is for them to decide.<br />
Q. But would you expect, though, that their preferences<br />
would all go your way again because of these reasons, because they<br />
might not like your foreign policy but they liked the ALP's a lot less?<br />
PM. I cannot see how it is possible for them not to dislike<br />
the ALP's defence and foreign policies far more than they dislike ours.<br />
Now it is for them to decide what they will do. One of the items in<br />
this field which has never really been worked out is that we have said<br />
that we think we must defend Australia, we must show that we are<br />
prepared to take action ourselves to bring up our own defence forces,<br />
to build them up if we are to expect support from the United States or<br />
the United Kingdom for that matter. There has never been an indication<br />
from the Labor side of the House what their approach to defence would<br />
be, except that they would abolish National Service training and except<br />
that they would do these other things I have mentioned. Whether they<br />
would devote resources to it or not, I don't know and nobody else in<br />
Australia does.<br />
Q. Still on the DLP and how they may or may not support<br />
you on certain things. If, for instance, and I have posed this to<br />
Senator Gair already, they withdrew their preferences and directed<br />
them to the ALP, would this almost put you out of office?<br />
PM. I don't think so, no. But it would make a difference to<br />
I can't tell you the number of seats 6 or 8 seats or something of<br />
that kind.<br />
Q. Do you see the possibility it might be a foolish question<br />
to ask of losing any seats in the House of Representatives this year?<br />
In other words, can you repeat 1966?<br />
PM. Well, I . let me put it this way. It would be a<br />
very great achievement to repeat 1966 because the 1966 vote was the<br />
highest vote that the non-Labor parties have ever received. And since<br />
that time at least four of our seats have been adversely affected by<br />
redistribution. So if we did repeat 1966, we would be doing better<br />
than we did in 1966 and that means we would be doing better than the<br />
all-time record. And I hope we do: / 3 </p>
<p>3-<br />
Q. There are those political commentators who say if you<br />
personally don't repeat 1966, then you have failed to a certain extent.<br />
How do you view those comments?<br />
PM. I would think that was rather absurd. If commentators<br />
are saying that, what they are saying is if somebody doesn't achieve<br />
better than an all-time record, then they have<br />
Q. Can we perhaps go back in time to the time when you<br />
became Prime Minister. The public image that went out at that stage<br />
was of the ex-fighter pilot, one of the boys, etc. The image these<br />
days my image of you is that you are looking considerably more<br />
tired than you were at that time. Are you in fact Is it taking toll of<br />
you physically?<br />
PM. I don't think it's taking toll of me physically oh, I<br />
suppose I wouldn't know. It might be to some extent because I<br />
have travelled all round Australia almost constantly and spoken to<br />
people I don't know how many meetings we have had this year but<br />
something like 80, speaking to people all over the place. But after all<br />
this is a fight and even when one was flying aeroplanes as a fighter<br />
pilot, one occasionally got tired but one kept on fighting and one did it<br />
just as well as ever, and I propose to do it just as well as ever.<br />
Q. Coming to October 25, we've talked a considerable<br />
amount about defence, etc. Is this, I take it, the issue the defence<br />
and foreign policy that you would like to go to the electors on?<br />
PM. This is one of the issues which I think will be of most<br />
importance in the elections. I hope it will be because I think it is of<br />
most importance to Australia. But there are many others as well<br />
questions of development, questions of social welfare and questions of<br />
trying to build a society that lives with the greatest amount of national<br />
unity that is possible.<br />
Q. Do you see this year I was just thinking of State Aid<br />
and it led me to think of the Independents and people standing on the<br />
question of State Aid do you see it as being a year when. maybe an<br />
Independent or two could be returned to Parliament?<br />
PM. I don't believe there will be Independents returned to<br />
Parliament. No. There will be quite a lot of Independents standing<br />
anti-State Aid people and some group called an Australia Party or<br />
something like that. I don't quite know where that springs from but<br />
you could regard them almost as Independents. There are a number<br />
of others but I would doubt very much whether any of them would in<br />
fact get elected. / 4 </p>
<p>-4<br />
Q. On the question of State Aidi do you see any point in<br />
anyone standing on an anti-State Aid ticket, with the thing being a<br />
matter of fact with almost all major parties?<br />
PM. Yes, I see some point in it from their approach. You<br />
see, we as a Government are providing aid to independent schools which<br />
I think is going to be of great assistance not to the schools themselves<br />
but to the individual pupils who are in those schools, and we are<br />
providing it on a different basis from that which is suggested by the<br />
Opposition. We are providing much more than the Opposition.<br />
Q. Would you care to explain the basis for it?<br />
PM. Yes, well. May I go back a little when I explain?<br />
Previously, when we provided capital grants for science blocks, we<br />
divided that money up so that 25 per cent of it went to independent<br />
schools and 75 per cent of it went to State schools, because that was<br />
the ratio of enrolment. And we did the same thing in libraries when<br />
we provided capital grants. Then we looked at the whole field generally<br />
and it became quite clear that the vast amount of public money, the vast<br />
majority of public money that was going to education was going into the<br />
state school system, and that if people were going to go to independent<br />
schools, and they are, then it was essential for Australia that they<br />
should be well taught and that they should have the facilities for education<br />
which they required. So we said, right, we will help the state school<br />
system by providing teacher training, by increasing the amounts we<br />
are providing for teacher training and in other ways. But we will give<br />
a grant per capita to the pupils at independent schools, and not divide<br />
it up. To put the thing in a nutshell, the Opposition is prepared to give<br />
far less assistance to independent schools than we are prepared to give<br />
and at greater cost to the community. So if an anti-State Aid candidate<br />
got a signif icant vote then they could regard that as a vote against the<br />
provision of assistance to independent schools.<br />
Q. Can you also draw the line of distinction for us between<br />
your policy and that of the ALP on health?<br />
PM. Yes, we hope to retain a voluntary health scheme and to<br />
improve the benefits which come from that voluntary health scheme.<br />
Now, at the moment the hospital benefits are really no problem. It's<br />
the medical benefits which need to be improved. The Opposition<br />
proposes to introduce a compulsory scheme and this scheme involves a<br />
levy of I-L per cent, not on the taxation which you pay but on the taxable<br />
income you have, which would work out at about an 8 per cent increase<br />
in your income tax. For that, the Opposition would give you minimum<br />
coverage. And again, to use figures to try and put it in a nutshell, a<br />
single man now, once he earned any more than $ 52 a week, would be<br />
paying more than he is at present for a minimum coverage. But also, </p>
<p>the Opposition scheme means there would be no tax deduction, and<br />
taking that into consideration, the result is that a single man who earns<br />
more than $ 39 a week would be paying much more under the Opposition<br />
scheme than he is under ours. A married man earning more than $ 63<br />
a week would be paying more for a compulsory scheme giving minimum<br />
assurance than the voluntary scheme we now have. Now we believe the<br />
voluntary scheme can be improved and we don't think it necessary to<br />
put this great impost upon the people which the Opposition proposes to<br />
put on them.<br />
Q. In what areas do you figure the current system can be<br />
improved?<br />
PM. In the areas of paying doctors' bills and particularly<br />
specialist bills and bills for complicated operations.<br />
Q. Still on money matters, it was said after the Budget that<br />
It had inflationary tendencies. This was said by many people including<br />
the Opposition. Can we look forward to any surprises, anything new in<br />
your policy speech to add or subtract from what was drawn up in the<br />
Budget?<br />
PM. Well, I don't think it had any inflationary tendencies<br />
myself because after all it did draw off about $ 500 million as a surplus<br />
internally in Australia. It is fascinating that the Opposition should say<br />
that it has got inflationary tendencies because as far as I can gather<br />
they propose to make available an untold number of additional millions<br />
which can only have great inflationary effect unless, of course, they<br />
greatly increase taxes.<br />
Q. We have talked about defence. We are now on domestic<br />
things. Would you like to see I'm sorry. You have already said<br />
you would like to talk about defence. Would you figure that the ALP<br />
would like to fight this election on domestic issues?<br />
PM. Oh, yes, I think so.<br />
Q. Why is this? For the Australian electorate?<br />
PM. They would like to fight it on domestic issues because<br />
they have such a bad defence policy.<br />
Q. In addition, do you feel that the Australian electors<br />
understand domestic issues more readily than they do foreign policy? / 6 </p>
<p>the Opposition scheme means there would be no tax deduction, and<br />
taking that into consideration, the result is that a single man who earns<br />
more than $ 39 a week would be paying much more under the Opposition<br />
scheme than he is under ours. A married man earning more than $ 63<br />
a week would be paying more for a compulsory scheme giving minimum<br />
assurance than the voluntary scheme we now have. Now we believe the<br />
voluntary scheme can be improved and we don't think it necessary to<br />
put this great impost upon the people which the Opposition proposes to<br />
put on them.<br />

Q. In addition, do you feel that the Australian electors<br />
understand domestic issues more readily than they do foreign policy? / 6 </p>
<p>6-<br />
PM. No, I don't. I think the Australian people have an<br />
instinctive feeling and knowledge that we are becoming more&amp;= and more<br />
isolated in the world and therefore we need to build up our own defence<br />
forces, not necessarily to fight some other large country but as an<br />
indication that we are interested in our own defence and that we are<br />
doing something about it and that we are deserving of our Allies to come<br />
to our assistance. I believe they have this instinctive feeling. Labor<br />
policy is to break down our own defences.<br />
The F -ill comes under defence, and in the last couple<br />
of weeks you have made the announcement that we will buy the F -ill<br />
subject to conditions. I don't see that as being anything new if it is<br />
still subject to conditions. Can you perhaps explain that for me?<br />
PM. Yes, because there were a number of factors concerning<br />
the F-Ill1 which were not entirely resolved until the last six or eight<br />
months or so, or even less than that. That is whether the range was<br />
what we wanted or whether the bomb load was what we wanted. Above<br />
all, whether the United States was going to have sufficient aircraft of<br />
this kind flying around for the next period of time so that we could get<br />
our spare parts whenever we wanted them. This was a very significant<br />
factor. The one remaining significant worry, too, was the wing box.<br />
Now, we needed a service life for this aircraft which would carry it<br />
through into the 1980' s. If a wing box wouldn't do that, then some way<br />
had to be found by which either new wing boxes were fitted or new wing<br />
boxes were developed. Now this has been found and there still remains<br />
the testing of these things, but at least we have reached a stage where<br />
we know that when a wing box becomes unserviceable it will be replaced<br />
at no cost to us.<br />
Q. If, to quote an hypothesis, another F-ill crashed between<br />
now and the elections, or one or two, is it delicately enough poised to<br />
do harm to the Liberal Government?<br />
PM. You are asking me to make a political judgment on what<br />
people would think...., but it certainly ought not to be, because the<br />
accident record of this aircraft Is not bad. People think it is but it has<br />
got a better accident record than the Phantom, for example, given the<br />
number of hours it has flown, or the Super Sabre or any other of the<br />
F-100 series aircraft. It is not a dangerous aircraft at all.<br />
Q. You would agree, I assume, that it has had tremendous<br />
publicity and must be something well in the forefront of Australians'<br />
minds? / 7 </p>
<p>&amp; 7<br />
PM. Every time it has had an accident, there has been<br />
tremendous publicity I agree entirely publicity which has never<br />
been directed to any other aircraft as far as I know. I think it would<br />
be well in Australians' minds, but what they have to decide is whether<br />
they think the Australian Air Force ought to have a strike bomber,<br />
whether they think that strike bomber ought to be the best available,<br />
and if they do think that, then they must decide that we should buy the<br />
F-111 because it is the best available strike bomber in the world today.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, briefly, if you wouldn't mind summing<br />
up for us why Australians should vote Liberal on October<br />
PM. I think during the last twenty years under Liberal<br />
Governments, Australia has progressed at a pace at which it has never<br />
progressed before. I think we have shown that we are responsible,<br />
that we are not willing to make wild promises which can't be carried<br />
out, except at the expense of the people themselves. I think that if<br />
you look at Australia today, you will see that there has never been such<br />
a state of full employment, never been such a state of prosperity, never<br />
been such a state of opportunity, and I think it would be difficult for the<br />
Australian people to risk this by going into the wild schemes which are<br />
put forward by the Opposition. Further, I think that the defence of<br />
Australia rests better in our hands than in the hands of the Opposition<br />
and I believe the arguments put forward on both sides show this clearly.<br />
I also feel that sections of the Labor Party not the Labor Party as a<br />
whole are influenced in their attitudes by Communist-dominated<br />
unions affiliated with them and this is completely absent from the<br />
Liberal Party itself. On the record, on the existing situation, on the<br />
programmes put forward for the future, I think the Australian people<br />
should vote Liberal. Prime Minister, thank you. </p>
