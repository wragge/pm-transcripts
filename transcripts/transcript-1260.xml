FIRST ANNLUAL CONFERENCE OF THE AUSTRALIAN DIVISION<br />
OF THE INSTITUTE OF DIRECTORS<br />
SYDNEY N. S. W. 24TH FEBRUARY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME IINISTER TIR. HAROLD HOLT<br />
Mr. President, Mr. Speaker, Ministerial and Parliamentary Colleagues,<br />
Ladies I understand there are some brave ladios with us here<br />
tonight and Gentlemen;<br />
I don't know what the scene appears to you in the<br />
background there but I can assure you that this is about as<br />
impressive a gathering that any public loader in this country could<br />
ever hope to address and I confess to being singularly impressed<br />
from the outset. I am sure that our two distinguished visitors<br />
from the United Kingdom, Sir Paul Chamnbers and Sir Richard Powell,<br />
both of I hav:: had th-: plcasure of mo ting at gatherings of the<br />
Institute in London, also fool stirred as I am by this spectacle<br />
of what Australia is able to contribute in the way of distinguished<br />
directorial talent. But I gather there are something over 600<br />
directors here tonight and, looking around the room, I think there<br />
must be at least 500 who are personal friends of mine from my many<br />
years in public life at least I like to think they are personal<br />
friends of mino, and certainly they have exhibited the greatest of<br />
goodwill to me this evening, and for the most part, the greatest of<br />
goodwill through the long period of apprenticeship I have served.<br />
After all, it says something for the charactorictic Australian<br />
quality of tolerance and m-toship that after seven years at the<br />
Treasury I can still face you, looking to you as friends and<br />
receiving such a respectful and attentive hearing as I am, at least<br />
up to this point.<br />
Gentlemen, we are getting used gradually to the idea<br />
in Canberra that there has been a change of management. Every now<br />
and then my officers and I refer to my distinguished predecessor<br />
and say, " Well, the BI is doing so-and-so" or " the EI is doing this<br />
or that". I do it. My officers do it. After sixteen years'<br />
association with a great political leader, it is not easy to adjust<br />
one's thinking to the fact that he is not there to carry those great<br />
responsibilities that face us at this time. But in a tremendously<br />
busy month, we have been rapidly accustoming ourselves to the fact<br />
that we have to stand on our own feet now and exhibit to the<br />
Australian people that Australia is able to produce leaders,<br />
and as one great leader moves on, then we hope that the team that I<br />
have assembled around me will enable me to continue to give Australia<br />
the sound, progressive, imaginative government that we have been<br />
favoured to enjoy for so many years under the Prime Ministership of<br />
Sir Robert Menzics.<br />
No Australian Prime Minister could take office at a<br />
more fascinating or interesting time in the history of his country.<br />
I am sure that even those of you in this room who have had to<br />
accustom yourselves to the rapidity of change in the years of<br />
phenomenal growth we've known since the end of the Second World<br />
War will have been struck by the rapidity of these changes<br />
around us, not only in the domestic scene but more particularly in<br />
the international scene in our own immediate neighbourhood over the<br />
period through which we are now passing. To us in Canberra, they<br />
are occurring with almost dizzying rapidity. Where once in my own<br />
political lifetime, Australia was an isolated outpost down under,<br />
now we are invaded in hordes almost with people who have discovered<br />
Australia perhaps for the first time but who are learning that here<br />
is not only a country of tremendous resources -nC creat potential,<br />
but here is one of the significant landmarks in thi2 aerea of the </p>
<p>* world capable of exercising a significant influence upon the destiny<br />
of this area of the world. Nov': that may bc rather a large mouthful<br />
to claim, but even in my own short term as Prime Minister I have<br />
been conscious of the fact that great national leaders in the United<br />
Kingdom and the United States are -2nxious to hear what the Government<br />
of this country feels about the particular developments in<br />
which we have some special knowledge in this area of the world.<br />
And not only anxious to hcar but giving respectful weight to the<br />
views that we put to them, and this, of course, imposes a tremendous<br />
responsibility upon us, not only a responsibility for careful and<br />
considered thought and judgment but the sort of responsibility which<br />
has us vweigh where we come out in all of thse situations. And at<br />
times, although it is rather flattering to be treated on a bcis<br />
of equ. rlity, one ondors whether the larger countries with which<br />
we enter upon discussions still realise that w; e are loss than<br />
12 million people trying to build a grant continent when they,<br />
in their turn, arc countries of great population and with many<br />
decades of national development behind them.<br />
Vle in Australia have boon jolted by events to adulthood<br />
in circumstances of such complexity as to call for a maturity and<br />
understanding pc-rha-ps has not been ex-ected of us in earlier<br />
periods of our history. So the for. mation of this body of which you<br />
are euicL nd v---ry one of you, is not only i-orta. nt in<br />
the national sense, but in my view could hardly be more timely<br />
because Australia will have to form a judgr'nt, nationally, upon<br />
many matters going well beyond our shores, matters which will involve<br />
us in some exercise of responsibility, some provision of military<br />
assistance, some provision of international aid or guidance,<br />
technical capacity and equipment, a whole host of matters which<br />
would have been foreign to ea rlier governments in Australian<br />
history. It is true we have been doing something along these<br />
lines over recent ycars. It is quite obviously the fact that more<br />
will be demanded of us, expected of us, end indeed needed from us<br />
as the years go on. Nowv it struck me so many times during my own<br />
long period in public life as rather strange that we hadn't<br />
developed amongst the leaders in commerce and trade and industry<br />
a greater willingness on their part or might I say your part<br />
to participate in the national dialogue on these great questions<br />
of policy which arise from time to time. I am not suggesting or<br />
hinting that you should involve yourselves in the day by day material<br />
of party politics; perhaps that can be left to those of us<br />
who are in the political scene as your Parliamentary representative.<br />
But I don't think we can afford to go on indefinitely without views<br />
being put quite vigorously and frankly and clearly, not necessarily<br />
in an organised sense or by the organisation represented here<br />
tonight, but by individual public loaders in their own field, and<br />
by public I mean men who have achieved stature in the eyes of the<br />
public in the fields of industry and trnde and commerce.<br />
There is a great need in Australia, a gap in our<br />
structure from this absence of participation in the national<br />
dialogue. It has been increasing, of course, to some degree<br />
over recent years, but time and time again as we have sat around<br />
the Cabinet table in Canberra and sought to appoint some person<br />
to a particular public post, one which calls for a man with an<br />
industrial or commercial background, but also which calls for<br />
qualities which go beyond the tasks of his own particular organisation<br />
or section of industry. And I assure you, you would<br />
be rather shocked to know how narrow the field of selection proves<br />
to be when we come to this task, and it perhaps explains why you<br />
find familiar figures bobbing up in a number of tasks of government.<br />
We feel almost cmbarr. as.: ed when we go back to the same<br />
familiar figures and ask them to do a job for us, and if we do<br />
that it is not because we want to load unanocessary burdens on their<br />
back but because there hasn't been this general participation in<br />
affairs going beyond the immediateprroccupation of the executive<br />
or the director in particular industries and sections of the<br />
economy which would provide us with the recruits we need for </p>
<p>3.<br />
public service sometimes honorary sometimes of a more<br />
pormrnont character, but contributing to what has been as Sir<br />
Robert Webstor recognised in hi: notable address the other evening,<br />
Sconsiderable and significant increase in the participation by<br />
government in the affair-of industry. Not psrticip. tion, I would<br />
hope, in the sonso that w; e are going to -ntrude irare deeply<br />
thani-s been the case in the past; but participation in the<br />
sense that there is a growing need it has been there for a long<br />
time, and we have done 0rsomething bout it but a growing need<br />
in the times in which we find ourselves for temmwNork between<br />
government and management so essential if the country is to<br />
progress as we would all wish a: a great co-operating democracy.<br />
And so, gentlcmen, here is isk for the Institute<br />
of Director, and it is hc-rtening to us all to feeol the need for<br />
a more co-oerative Australi, an 4u'tral that has devclJped<br />
a close national unity, to sec evidenced by your presence here<br />
tonight the signs thet in the field of top director-ship and exccutive<br />
strength in this country, we will find a greatcr co-ordination<br />
of ideas and activity than ve hrve in the paSct. This will be a<br />
tromondous national a: ss:: t for utra. lic.<br />
No! w w, 0s a Govcr-: mnt, have encounterod, or at leonst<br />
are the inheritor of a combination of important development5 ; hich<br />
era produein5 c1halle:--ing sitnations for us in a nuzabcr of dietions.<br />
I mention first, however, the : noroal picture bcenuse I nt<br />
to como to com of these dovelopOnts in a momnt, but as ono looTe<br />
at the Au: traolian scone g -crwalltyhe, task doesn't look as formidable<br />
in the internal domestic sense, the economic sense, Mr.<br />
President, as perhaps you have pictured it here tonight. That may<br />
be the viewpoint of an optimist but I think it is one in which Lriy<br />
colleagues of tha Cabinet wculd agreo. That doesn't meancn that thr<br />
won't be problems in the futura, of courso. , Anybody living in a<br />
country so Cubject to the ha zo: rd: z of t( he Coson, the fluctuation<br />
in ". utput year by year, a: the result of either drought, flood or<br />
some other advorse fr'ctor, the quite snoartionr. l fluctuations<br />
which occur from time to timo in iwhat we receive overseas for our<br />
products, when you are fr0c!, ith that set of circumstances, noone<br />
can claim that the course aheod is ever likely to be ecsy.<br />
But for those of us that h". ve to sit and evolve continuing policies<br />
of a national kind, it doesn't look so formidable as it did in<br />
earlier periods in the last twcnty years because we have had the<br />
good fortune in this c-ountry to come through a long period of stable<br />
political growth and policy formation with no interruption and with<br />
a continuing stability of conditions here. ' Not many countries<br />
around the world could point to that kind of stability whilst they<br />
were forming policies of an enduring kind. ind I believe that<br />
over these years we've established a pattern and a structure for<br />
the Australia of the future which will endure for very many years<br />
to come, a basic pattrn and structure of policy and national<br />
endeavour. Non let ma just illustrate it in a few directions. We<br />
have launched and sustained a vigorous programec of migration<br />
which we have every intcntion of continuing on as larg a scale<br />
as we can contrive. Secondly, for miost of the period I speak of,<br />
Australia has enjoyed Nhat would be described in realistic terms<br />
as a full omployrnnt situation. Noiw although there have booeen here<br />
some minor fluctuations, no-one with any recollection of the<br />
pre-war Australia or of the more dreadful days of the 1930' s could<br />
describe what has he: pcncd over the last twenty years as other than<br />
a full cmploymont situntion for the country and that situation<br />
continues. There will be odd pockets of weakness here snd there<br />
which we shall have to attcnd to, but by and larg the achievoment<br />
has been recorded through ycars of considerable fluctuation, come<br />
of them years of stress, and ne have beern able to sustain, broadly<br />
speaking, a full employmn; ont situation.<br />
Then we have had a high capiitl fornotion in this<br />
country. I wonder if everyone here realises juct how high this<br />
has been. I was interested myself to discover recently that there<br />
is only one country recorded in the official interna! tional statistics<br />
that can point to a higher level of capital formation, or porcentage </p>
<p>of capital formation than Australia, and -that is Japan. Ours<br />
stands at abcut 27% of gross national expenditure. That Compares<br />
with 17% or 18% for the Unitcdl Kingdom and tho United Sta-tes, and<br />
this, too, is not n pssinE pha sc. It is rattributb] c, oif course,<br />
to oIur oral jnterl crqap), acity -c vvcvc, fo high onc. by o<br />
parativo stand zards around the world and also to the strong cpital<br />
inflow v. hich has been sustaincd cven over these recent pcriods when<br />
official , olicies would appear to have produced some reduction of<br />
it. Ard I mcntion another fcctcr rtable govcrnmcnt something<br />
we tend to take for grantod in this country, and . ri are lucky<br />
pcople to be ble to do so. 1Ve havc-had enoDugh recent exa" mples<br />
around the world to ill. uatr: atet for us that thcse things are not<br />
either inevitablo nor favouring the rm'-srta of the or. dIs propulation<br />
at the present time, a2nd only tonirht flash has bon<br />
-eccived to the cfct -tht i: GL:: nr te army hs t-ak-I over the<br />
govornment there a. nd appr -ntly deposed the -dministrc. tion of<br />
Procident Ykrw arux. h. WeVoll, this ha-ppening so recently agninst the<br />
events in figria, which w,. s regrdeda about the r. ost stable of<br />
non-uropean cttes in A'frica, is an-ther illustrL-tion of the<br />
re tless and violent world in ilhich i-e stand as an isand of<br />
stability and security. Anc this, of cours, is the factor wrihich<br />
one finds cropping up renotedly in the tnlk I hve with those , ho<br />
come here looking , ustralii over ana ing away frem thiis country<br />
more convinqced th-r. they h Od over been bef_, ore that thic is a. country<br />
in which they should have some otake for the future, joining w ith us<br />
in the building of a Croat notion, a stabilisin, -trcngthcning and<br />
prospering factor in t-his significaint area of the orld.<br />
But I have -mntioned the elements which are illustrative<br />
of whnt I speak of as the established structure and pattern for the<br />
Aastr: lic. o1f th fte. I don't b-liecve that even if there ;, wore<br />
a chane of goveriment, dspite the fa ct th. At I know there is<br />
and I not : nnting to turn this into a political occasion<br />
despite the fact that there is a pr. ofession of demccratic socialism<br />
on the part of VMr. Calwo ll, a rdicl and socialist party on the pa rt<br />
of Mar. 7Yhitlair; my own belief is that these patterns tha-t I mention<br />
are now co solidly cetablishod in ustrlia that even if a Labor<br />
Govcriin-t catnc int.-office. it wold soon find that the electoraite<br />
would rejcc-t it if it sought in any w! ay to lltcr what h-d becoe<br />
establiched national policies, serving utralia .' ll.<br />
So I say, ladies rnd gentlemcn, that I don't expect an,,<br />
fundamcntl or drastic policy changcs even from our politicl<br />
opponcnts; wh-tevcr their rish-sn i-hbte in this direction, I<br />
-am sure the cight of -lctor7l opinion would be aga-inst it, and I<br />
don't sc the need for them an the pa: rt of our on governiment, in<br />
order to deal ;: tith the domoetic situa7tion as e view it. There will<br />
be some marginal action re * uirecl in perhaps a variety of directions,<br />
but any one in this ream who is trying to pla-. n for the future of<br />
their own organisction in ustra-liai canli, I belicvc, rely upon those<br />
fund. ntls. ill CoI industrial rroith Vill<br />
continue, the full emloeycnt situati-) n w-: ill be a. steoady nd continuous<br />
one in this cou~ ntry, n6 there will be a continuing stability<br />
of political a: ffairs in ustrlia ao a btasis of our owin<br />
national groth. Tow I believe this to be true : and I am , ure this is the<br />
view taken of it by these who come from overseas to observe<br />
our scene and they claim something else which I was going to<br />
mcntion in another connection a little later, but perh-. ps it is<br />
apposite to introduce it here, and this is sonrething we don't talk<br />
about ourselves. A6gain, we tae it for ranted. But they include<br />
in their cntcgory Cf the assts they discover, the character and<br />
qulity of the ., utr-lia n popl. There may be less than 12<br />
million of us but in the eyes of those who come to observe us,<br />
we -re poople of character and. quality. nd how-essential this<br />
is if weo rre less th n 12 million peop--le; ', ith ri contincnt of the<br />
size of the Unitcd Statcs to develop, then e cn't -: afford to have<br />
second-2atQ people or people lacking in chcarnctcr nnd quality. </p>
<p>, The most valuable export that Australia can send abroad is the<br />
Australian who goes as a technician or a professional man into<br />
one of these countries to our North to give guidance and training<br />
a proj-ection of Australia as a helpful kindly country<br />
with people of character and quality who can make a contribution<br />
to security and progress in this part of the world. It will be<br />
one of my own tasks as your Prima Minister to encourage this process.<br />
I can believe that Australia can do a great deal by the positive<br />
constructive type if diplomacy using that word in its widest<br />
sense where Australians go out and make Australia better known<br />
in a constructive and helpful way around the world and in particular<br />
around the world to the North of us.<br />
I Now I have mentioned something about the established<br />
economic situation but let me say a word about the prospects.<br />
I said a word or two in this direction but my friend, Charles Court<br />
ought to be taking over this part of what I have to say because he<br />
is the best national salesman in political circles that I know.<br />
You will be discovering this in more detail, no doubt, tomorrow<br />
but having established the pattern and structure that I have<br />
mentioned, forward prospects continue to read most attractively.<br />
We have oar own good population growth rate and we have a good<br />
growth rate with population and productivity going together.<br />
But our population rate I have bean pointing this out to some of<br />
our distinguished visitors, in particular Denis Healey, the British<br />
Minister for Defence, and Vice-President Humphrey; we have a<br />
population growth rate something of the order of upwards of 2 per<br />
cent, the United Kingdom .8 of 1 per cent and at the last year of<br />
record, the United States 1.3 per cent. Others may choose to<br />
ignore this, but we can't ignore it. It is a fat of life for us.<br />
It imposes considerable burden and stress upon us to provide the<br />
hotsing, the schools, and the hospitals, as I am sure my State<br />
COllo n. s here will beer -i-ness, . ui-te convincingly. And so<br />
here is itself a factor for economic growth in the future.<br />
the<br />
Then we add to thistotory which Charles, I imagine,<br />
will be expanding for you, of the exploration which has produced<br />
the fabulous mineral discoveries in our North and in the W. est and<br />
indeed in various other parts of Australia as well, not to ignore<br />
the natural gas so far discovered which csan make such a contribution<br />
for economic development. But these are things which in the<br />
mineral field alone, could on a not over-optimistic estimate bring<br />
us, within ten years' time, an export income equalling or surpassing<br />
that which we will be receiving or are receiving concurrently<br />
from our wool production. So this means quite a striking and<br />
indeed almost fabulous addition to our resources.<br />
Then there is the element, as yet I believe in its<br />
early stages, of our trade with Asia. Who would have imagined<br />
in his wildest hopes that Australia would have built up in these<br />
last ten years or so the kind of regular trade not flukey trade<br />
but regular and growing trade that we have with Japan. The<br />
figures may interest you. In 1951/ 52, Australia's exports to Japan<br />
were $ 97 million in value. Last year, which was not the highest<br />
on record, they were $ 441 million. In other words, a 350 per cent<br />
increase on the figure of 1951/ 52. This, I repeat, would not<br />
have been dreamed of ten or fifteen years ago, and yet as we see<br />
it, we know it is only the beginning. In respect of Japanese iron<br />
ore contracts alone, and Charles correct me if my total is too low,<br />
we have contracts, I understand, completed for the sale of Australian<br />
iron ore to the tune of $ 2,320 million. So that we can<br />
face, I believe, our future in economic terms confidently.<br />
As Japan develops its own standards and grows with its<br />
own internal demands, it will supply an increasing part of Asian<br />
demand. This will be a demand which, with a more sensitive<br />
world conscience on this issue of rising expectations and the<br />
under-privileged areas of the world, there will be gradual but<br />
increasing as I can tell you from our own provision of international<br />
aid there will be increasing ossistance being given to<br />
other countries which in turn will want their demands satisfied by<br />
foodstuffs, raw materials, industrial equipment, all of which<br />
Australia is well placed in this area of the world, with the </p>
<p>resources we know about, to assist in supplying.<br />
And we have, as part of this story, the determination<br />
of President Johnson and his Administration, reflecting, I believe,<br />
the views of the Amorican people generally, that thoir great<br />
concept of he gr~~ at society ic not to bc limited to the United<br />
States alone. He has already indicated that he is willing to<br />
provide a billion dollar fund for Asian TDvelopment. inerica<br />
has come handsomely into the Provision of capital for the Asian<br />
Development Bank with $ 200M. We, recognising the importance<br />
for the whole area of such a bank, have accepted a much higher<br />
than our proportionote share of contribution by a comrmitment of<br />
( American). Now as those institutions, these Funds, get under<br />
way and make their worth felt, we, in turn, must derive some commercial<br />
benefit from this; whether it is in the area of foodstuffs,<br />
minerals, raw materials or a graowing volume of manufactured exports,<br />
this is something which Australia will be able to do.<br />
So let us turn now for a moment or two to the challenges<br />
which show up clearly in the international fields and the most<br />
urgent , and the most worrying of these, of course, is in South Viet<br />
Nam. We, as an Australian Government, have been firm in our own<br />
views and conclusions about this situation from the outset. We<br />
have seen this, as we have seen o many othor of those critical<br />
challenges of the post-war years, as further evidence of the<br />
communist determination to spread its philosophy, its doctrine<br />
through the world so far as this proves possible for it, probing<br />
here and there, finding a weak spot, trying to build up the<br />
pressures. We see it currently at its most manifest-. in South Viet<br />
Nam, but I have boon talking yesterday and today with the rc-prooontatives<br />
of Thailand end they would be telling you of the pres ures<br />
to which they are being subject on their North, on their East, on<br />
their ' ost from the Communist influence, and we have seen this,<br />
as I am glad to say the President of the United States and his<br />
Administration have seen it, as another challenge to free peoples<br />
throughout the world.<br />
Now gentlemen, if this is your view, and I think it would<br />
be, because I know that in our own Parliament in the two Government<br />
Parties, there is not one member elected to represent the people in<br />
those two Government Parties who does not subscribe wholehoertedly<br />
to the Government's policy of support in South Viet Nam and a<br />
backing for the nmerican policies there. But I don't want you<br />
to feel that you can just leave it to your Parliamentarians, if<br />
on a great national question such as this, touching the very<br />
security of the nation, touching the security of free peoples<br />
everywhere, we can afford to allow the politician only to persuade,<br />
to convince, to argue on this issue in our national community.<br />
Here, if you believe these things is scope for you individually<br />
in the positions of leadership that you occupy, and we can't<br />
afford to allow a situation to develop in which the only voices<br />
heard are the voices of dissent. You and I might believe, and<br />
indeed know, that this represents only a handful in the population,<br />
that its influence is not groat, but if you allow it to go, of<br />
course, uncorrected, or unchallenged, a small influence can become<br />
a larger:., cnc. This is what the President is finding. This is<br />
what we, for our part, are finding. And if there is any doubter<br />
in this room of the essential character of the challenge, the<br />
critical nature of it, in South Viet Nam, I wish he would write<br />
to me and toll me. I shall send him by the return of post, the<br />
copy of the speech which Vice-President Humphrey made on this<br />
matter, one of the most compelling and moving public speeches I<br />
have ever heard. And if anybody remains unconvinced after the<br />
evidence that be brings forward, then he lacks the capacity for<br />
conviction. And we've seen, gentlemen, this challenge; how many<br />
times does it have to be levelled before we recognise it in<br />
whatever particular form it emerges. We saw it in Berlin. We<br />
saw it in the so-called Greek civil vmr. As Vice-President<br />
Humphrey pointed out, what a remarkable thing that when </p>
<p>' Yugoslavia fell out with the Soviet and cut off that supply line<br />
from the Soviet to Greece, the civil war disappeared. An in other<br />
situations, whether it is in Cuba, whether it is in Berlin or in<br />
Greece, or in Korea, or now in South Viet Nam, or in the probes that<br />
are going on in Laos, Thailand gnd other countries in South-East<br />
Asia, this threat to free peoples has to be met. And what an<br />
extraordinary thing it is, illustrating the confusion of mind<br />
on this matter, that you will get a groat paper like the " Now<br />
York Times" which will urge the Administration to defend Berlin<br />
to the last American soldier that can be sent there and yet next<br />
day will write a powerful editorial and go on doing so, urging<br />
them to pull our of the issue in Scuth Viet Nam.<br />
We are told sometimes that we oversimplify the problem.<br />
I am afraid there arc far too many people around the world who overcomplicate<br />
it. And of course you can point to very sincere people<br />
amongst the Viet Cong. No man offers his life unless he believes<br />
quite strongly in what is happening around him, but there have been<br />
people before that the communists have steered for their own<br />
purposes. They have got on the popular band-waggon and nll the<br />
evidence that comes to us is overwhelmingly convincing that here<br />
is a challenge which is guided from Hanoi and which in turn is<br />
masterminded from Poking. Well, there in brief is a reference to<br />
Viet Nam, but we mustn't brush it out of consciousness as something<br />
that isn't vital to Austrnlin's own security. If we can't hold the<br />
line in South Viet Nam with all the weight of imerican strength, if<br />
we can't hold it there, who can tell me where it con be held nywhere<br />
in South-East Asia.<br />
I would like to just mention a word or two to you<br />
about our talks with Mr. Healey because these were fundamental, and<br />
indeed quite historic, because uhat was involved here wvs a dialogue<br />
about the British role in the world. You hove noticed even since<br />
the publication of the White Poper one of the Ministers has resigned,<br />
giving as his main rocson for the resignation that he disogrecs with<br />
the strategic concept, that in his view Britain should withdraw,<br />
should not have forces enst of Suez, and this view was advanced by<br />
the shadow Defence Minister on the Conservative side, Enoch Powell<br />
some time ago. I have reason to believe thnt it is not a universally<br />
held view in the Conservative P: nrty or even in the Shvdow<br />
Cabinet of the Conservative Party, but it nas put forward publicif:.<br />
by their Shadow Minister, and so this is more than just editorial<br />
stuff or liternry criticism or debating society material. These<br />
issues are urgent topical, vital issues for the security of this<br />
country. Mr. Hoaloy, quite obviously from the recent actions of<br />
his colleagues, has been under much pressure to adopt the line of<br />
withdrawal East of Suez and when he reached us, I think he felt<br />
there would be a very limited life to their occupancy of the<br />
base in Singapore. Well, at least one value which came from those discussions,<br />
and there were several important conclusions which<br />
we were able to reach together, but one at least was to impress<br />
on him our view of the importance of the British presence in this<br />
area of the world, the importance of the retention of the base<br />
in Singapore for as long as this was humanly possible, an assurance<br />
that in our view, a British presence there far from being resented<br />
by the peoples of Asia, would be accepted by them as a moderating<br />
and stabilizing influence, contributing to their security rather<br />
than a source of disturbance and restlessness and turbulence amongst<br />
their people... I am glad to say this view was endorsed when he reached<br />
Singapore and Kuala Lumpur and it was a view which was endorsed<br />
by the representatives of the Thai Government with which<br />
we have been holding discussions in thcse last two days. And so<br />
has emerged this quite notable decision of the British Government<br />
to remain in effect a world influence, not to withdraw and adopt a<br />
quite narrow view of their international responsibilities, but to<br />
maintain a global role, to maintain substantial forces in this area<br />
of the world and to remain on in Singapore for as long as that<br />
proves humanly practicable. </p>
<p>8.<br />
! hat did flow from it also was acceptance by us of the<br />
vicvw that althouh they might docide and h! ve now decided to remain<br />
thcre, it rny prove, as a recult 1of ovelomonts which no-one can at<br />
this time foreseeo, that a base in Singapore cannot be suctaincd.<br />
Well it put in that blu. rt and frioadly fa. shio2 that r. Healey<br />
has that if Britain couldn't stay there, it had nowhere :. lso to<br />
go and had to go homo unless it could come to Australia. So we<br />
shall, in our planning of our own brze facilitics for the future,<br />
and indeed taking into account this contingency, be bringing our<br />
attention to the possibilities which could develop here, and conducting<br />
discussions at the Service lovel with reprosentativos<br />
of the British Government.<br />
iNow, remember, he was talking about problems which might<br />
r. ric in the 1970S, cvven the 1990' s. Our on situation is not<br />
going to be tr'nsfonncd overnight, but what we will be doing in<br />
the yeors rhead will be planning, rill be acting in such a way<br />
that wc guard against the sort of dangCer which your own judgoments<br />
will conjure up for you.<br />
7hat flows from all of this, from the talks with the<br />
United States which has become so hcavily committed in terms<br />
of manowcr and military equipmcnt and unLdrtrkings to conduct<br />
a constructive, positive programme of peaceful economic development<br />
in thrat are of the world, was that it obviously involves for<br />
Australia a growing commitment over the years. The lesson is<br />
there, or the writing is there for us, that we must become more<br />
self-reliant to meet the varo. cty of dangers which can threaten<br />
us in the future. I spoke a little oerlior of our trcdo with Jrpan.<br />
We h: ave irmmodi-tely to the North of us 100 million people in Vwhat<br />
has become a virtually bonkrupt and disorgniscd economy, with<br />
turbulence of a political kind, the outcome of which no-one at<br />
this point can foresee. Austr,. lian trade with Indonesia in the<br />
same ycar that I mentioned with Japan ( 1951-52) was $ 8M. Last<br />
year it was $ 7M agmainst 4; 44.11 for Japan. Eighty million of people<br />
well organised with a strong, buoyant oconomy, industrialised with<br />
rising standards in one direction; 100 million people subjected<br />
to this turbulence, this economic failure which one sees immediately<br />
to our North, and here is a country with which we have a<br />
common boundary in New Guincea.<br />
So Austra. ia., l'dica and gentlemen, has been jolted<br />
ot merely into adulthood but into r maturity of attitudes and<br />
approach; a requirement of maturity of decision which we have<br />
not known in the degree we have to confront it today at any earlier<br />
point in our history.<br />
I don't mention those things to you in any pessimistic<br />
spirit because I bclieve that this country has a destiny in<br />
Asia which should excite us all. Indeed, one of the heartening<br />
things is to discover amongst the lenders of the countries<br />
of AsiC how much Australi, is respected as friend nd d lly, as<br />
donor of international aid, and it is not the big costly<br />
things that matter so terribly much in their eyes.<br />
One of the most significant elements of aid that the<br />
Prime Minister of Thailand was mentioning to me was a military<br />
training school we have in his country for technical training<br />
of people who go into the services. Those now going to the<br />
school are being approached by private omployers before they<br />
are through their training, wanting to get them for the<br />
industry of Thailand. Well, at least there is a gain in<br />
an industrial sense. And hero, by this kind of provision, he<br />
pointed to come road construction that we were carrying out.<br />
I am sure Pat orton could suggest a few place-around his own<br />
State where roads could bc built. </p>
<p>But this sort of thing, not hundreds of millions of<br />
dollars of aid but friendly, technical advice with the man<br />
on the spot, whom they can see, whom they can talk to and<br />
regard as a friend. In these ways, I believe, we are helping<br />
to strengthen our neighbours to o nr North. In these ways,<br />
eventually, I believe, we will find the means of knitting more<br />
closely together the countries interested in this area.<br />
Now my concluding point on all this is that we<br />
see in what faces us in the future not just Australia, but all<br />
those of like-minded ideas in relation to the future we see<br />
a tremendous need for the United Kingdom, the United States,<br />
Australia and Now Zoaland to got together, to co-crdinate what<br />
they are doing, work out together what our objectives should<br />
be, what cur goals are, how we see the future, what we feel we<br />
can do together. Our resources arc not so vast that we can<br />
afford to squander them and we feel that it will be by our<br />
joint efforts, facing common tasks, that we shall achieve most<br />
effectively what lies within each of us to do.<br />
Finally, here we have in this country of ours another<br />
great asset in the co-operating democracy that we have established.<br />
You can go to Darwin, or Perth or Brisbane; people<br />
will be listening to the national news at about the same time,<br />
making due allowances for the time changes in West and South<br />
Australia, but here we have a remarkably homogeneous people of<br />
very much more similar outlook than you will find even in the<br />
British Isles or any other country that you could name. This,<br />
itself, is a tremendous national asset, and at the various levels<br />
of Government Commonwealth, State, Municipal I believe we have<br />
a closer teamwork today and a battor-willcd one, more cordial and<br />
co-operative teoomwork than I have known at any earlier point of<br />
the Australian Federation. And when we look out from government<br />
to industry, I know that next week we shall be conferring ag: in<br />
with many of you, some of you anyhow, who are in this room tonight,<br />
some of the leaders in the field of manufacturing, export advice,<br />
and the leaders of industry, who will see us as a particular group<br />
in the course of the afternoon.<br />
Now this has become a regular exercise twice a year,<br />
trying to get into the minds of industry, talking to those who come<br />
to us freshly from the market place, trying to get the best<br />
picture we can before we launch into major economic decisions by<br />
the Government. So I mention these things. They are taken by so<br />
many for granted, Here we are at this point of time having<br />
established as very few countries in the world can claim to have<br />
established, a co-operating deoocracy in which the rights of<br />
minorities are safeguarded, as they must be in any true<br />
democracy, and in which the national effort is channelled the more<br />
successfully because of the teamwork we have produced.<br />
Now, of course, we haven't reached perfection, and<br />
we never will, but your organisation will be a step along the<br />
road to a better result than we have achieved in the past,<br />
and I would hope that in the course of your own discussions you<br />
would spare a thought for the Parliament as an institution.<br />
In this country, the Parliament doesn't enjoy the<br />
respect it does in many other democracies, although I believe<br />
the quality of service is just as high and the quality of<br />
representation and membership is as high. One doesn't develop<br />
any inferiority complex after participating in Parliamentary<br />
Conferences with others around the world. Your toughset<br />
competition is right back home, in my experience, it is<br />
in so many other directions. But gentlemen and I exclude<br />
the ladies on this because I am sure they give the Parliament<br />
the respect it deserves anyhow but,, gentlemen, a community<br />
which can't respect its Parliament really can't respect itself<br />
because we are drawn from the community, we are there to serve </p>
<p>the comunity, and if you don't like us, please replace us by<br />
something better. At the moment it doesn't seem to be on the<br />
horizon but one can never be sure!<br />
Well, gentlemen, one could, of course, go on at much<br />
greater length but I am appalled at my own affrontery when I<br />
recall that in the course of this day you have been addressed<br />
with such skill at such length bythe distinguished spokesmen<br />
of whom we heard a little earlier. But 6an I say in my last<br />
sentence to you that to an Australian leader it is a tremendously<br />
heartening thing, not only to feel the good will which has been<br />
radiating to me from all gathered here tonight, but to feel<br />
that from people of the quality that I see represented here<br />
will be moulded the Australia of the future, and in that I have<br />
every confidence and great pride. </p>
