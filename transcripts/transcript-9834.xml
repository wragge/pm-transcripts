ber STATEMENT FROM THE OFFICE OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
I nisterRE: THIE GUARDIAN<br />
An article in The Guardian newspaper in London has falsely attributed to Mr Keating a<br />
flippant and offensive remark concerning Her Majesty The Queen.<br />
The quote ascribed to Mr Keating has been cynically invented by the newspaper to,<br />
enhance the story. Mr Keating denies emphatically making the remark attributed to<br />
fly him. He has given no interview to The Guardian newspaper. He recently met and<br />
kas shook hands with a journalist from The Guardian, but at this brief corridor encounter<br />
in front of two witnesses no such remark was made.<br />
ig a This is not the first time a member of the British press has let his imagination run ahead<br />
om of his story. One expects this sort of behaviour from some British tabloids, but not<br />
New from a newspaper with the reputation of The Guardian.<br />
