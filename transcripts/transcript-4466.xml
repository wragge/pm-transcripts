NORTHERN TERRITORY ELECTIONS<br />
Although final results in the Northern Territory elections<br />
may not be known for a fortnight, and although counting<br />
has not started in two seats and has only just begun in<br />
two others, it is already clear that there has been very<br />
strong support for the Country Liberal Party.<br />
I congratulate the Leader of the Country Liberal Party,<br />
Dr. Goff Letts. The Country Liberal Party will be<br />
returned with a strong working majority which will enable<br />
both the Federal Government and the CLP to continue with<br />
their programmes of development for the Northern Territory<br />
and progress towards self-government. </p>
