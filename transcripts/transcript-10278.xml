PRIVACY LEGISLATION<br />
I took the opportunity of today's Premiers Conference to raise the<br />
Commonwealth's concerns regarding proposals to implement a privacy regime<br />
for the private sector. The Commonwealth opposes such proposals which will<br />
further increase compliance costs for al Australian businesses, large and small.<br />
4t a time when all heads of" govenunent acknowledge the need to reduce the<br />
fegulatory burden, propolals for new composory regimes would be<br />
pounterproductive. On those grounds, the Commonwealth will not be<br />
implementing privacy legislgtion for the private sector.<br />
I asked the Premiers and Chief Ministers not to introduce legislation on this<br />
matter within their own jurisdictions. Both the Northern Territory and<br />
Queensland have agreed not to introduce such legislation. Other States have<br />
. indicated that they will consider the Commonwealth's request. I will be<br />
; writing to the States on this matter.<br />
I1 noted to the Premiers the Commonwealth's offer pf the services of the Federal<br />
-Privacy Commissioner to assist business in the development of voluntary codes<br />
iof conduct and to meet privacy standards.<br />
