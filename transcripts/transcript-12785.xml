Ruth Cracknell';s passion and wit endeared her to generations of Australians over an acting career spanning more than 50 years.<br />
On radio, on the stage and on television her great talent and enthusiasm for her craft won acclaim from critics and audiences alike.<br />
As Maggie Beare in the long running ABC TV series Mother and Son she captured a character who was in turn uncomfortably familiar yet very funny and made it her signature role.<br />
There would be few Australians unfamiliar with her talent, a mark of the impact she has made on the cultural life of the nation.<br />
Ruth Cracknell brought the same passion that she displayed in her performances to her advocacy for indigenous Australians and as a patron of the arts.<br />
She will be greatly missed by so many.<br />
On behalf of the nation I express my condolences to her family and to the Australian arts community.</p>
