    <content><![CDATA[<p> 8TH October, 1962,</p>
<p>Mr, President, Mr. Minister and Ladies and Gentlemen</p>
<p>I want to make, I think, two preliminary remarks.</p>
<p>The first is that there is a certain benevolent quality about this meeting this afternoon dommercial broadcasting stations meeting under the benevolent smile of Sir Charles Moses ( Laughter), I think that's very agreeable, The second preliminary remark is that by some error somewhere, I am at present somewhere else having had the rare experience of being double-booked Loday. And, as " somewhere else" involves me talking with three Premiers and you kniow what Premiers are like I have craved leave of the President to enable me to depart when I have said what few things I have to say to you,</p>
<p>I don't profess to be an expert on brcoadcasting.</p>
<p>I speak over the air more than I listen. That, I suppose, you might say was an endemic disease of politicians. I leave all the fine work, the expert work, the neat parry and thrust of wave lengths and things of that kind, to Charles Davidson who, though he doesn't understand them any more than I do, ( Laughter ) gives a very, very good imitation as a Minister, of knowing what they're about.</p>
<p>All I want to say to you in reality is that I<br />have now lived quite a long time, as any opponent of mine<br />would tell you. I am not unacquainted with change for, after<br />all in the last Parliament, I had a majority of 32. And<br />so Lir' I know all. about change which is the law of life.<br />But, like very many other people, I can look back to a time<br />when nobody had ever heard of wireless broadcasting, or of<br />television, or of aircraft. And it is one of my minor<br />boasts, that I can go back to a time in my boyhood memory when<br />the first motor vehicle arrived in the district and it was<br />a motor buggy. We have lived through the most extraordinary series<br />of miracles, haven't we? And, interestingly enough, most of<br />them haven1t been so much miracles of understanding*-I doubt<br />whether we understand much better than we did but miracles<br />of communication. It seems only the other day that anybody<br />who wanted to broadcast, some amateur was regarded as a harmless<br />crank. I remember when the first stations were set up<br />commercial stations. I confess to you, I thought that the<br />people who put their money into them were mad and now I<br />know better ( Laughter). The way in which, what began as a<br />sort of bit of fun, has become a tremendously powerful<br />influence in business and in social life is, I think, one<br />of the miracles of my time0</p>
<p>I shall always feel glad that when these matters<br />began, Governments in Australi. a were intelligent enough, as<br />I believe, to decide that they would have a dual system;<br />that we would have the Broadcasting Commission, and that<br />we would have commercial stations with advertising, iand all<br />the rich variety of programmes that result from a hghly<br />competitive system0 This, I am sure, has been a wonderful<br />thing, I. for one, would not wish to go back on it. I think<br />it has boen a great thing for Australia,</p>
<p>Now I know, Sir, that now -that television is descending upon us one mast on Black Mountain when I went away, almost two masts on Black Mountain when I came back we have the rich privilege of seem what the movie stars looked like twenty years ago, ( Laughter)</p>
<p>1 know Sir, that a lot of people, many ofi. s perhaps,<br />felt that when television came in, broadcasting would go oi..; t,<br />Quite frankly I don't believe it and I believe I am right<br />in saying tha? there is nothing i~ n your own experience which<br />suggests that. Broadcasting and I am now talking in particular<br />about commercial broaacasting, brings to millions of people,<br />the direct voice, thle direct statement, the direct song, the<br />direct piece of drama whatever it may be and that is a<br />wonderful thing because there is a constant conflict in -the<br />modern world between what a man says and what he is reported<br />to have said these are entirely different matters; and<br />although I witnessed with a certain amount of wry humour the<br />development of Parliamentary broadcasting I have seen that<br />little instinctive movement that takes a Member a little<br />nearer to -the next microphone ( Laughter) and I have watched<br />with regret what I believe to be the decline of the intimacy<br />of Parliamentary debate in favour of the set speech still<br />it must be said that, wherever I go in Australia, I will<br />encounter somebody, perhaps one, perhaps a dozen, perhaps<br />fifty who were able to say, " Well, I was following that<br />debate, such and such a point was made and I didnvt find it<br />answered." Now this I think is an advantage for thoughtf'ul<br />people, But above all things, when somebody like myself<br />sits down in front of a microphone to address this wretched,<br />unresponsive piece of metal backed by a blaril wall, he of-ten<br />says to himself, " Oh dear, I wonder if anybody is listening<br />to -this. If I stopped suddenly would anybody know?" You<br />all know this feeling that we get perhaps you get it<br />occasionally, I don't know but I get it.<br />At least one has the knowledge that whoever does<br />happen to be listening, and possesses the patience to hear<br />you through, will know what you said and will be able to<br />form a judgment about whatever personality accompanied the<br />words over the air.<br />I am speaking now purely as a political person but<br />consider how many people in how many remote places in L7stral ja<br />thirty years ago cut off from their nearest neighbour 161<br />miles away, thirty years ago, living in remote places thirty<br />years ago9 perhaps not all that many miles from a Capital<br />but on a little branch line in the country with one train<br />a week and a batch of newspapers once a week, and then consider<br />what broadcasting has brought into the lives of these<br />people, consider the way it has contracted the geographical<br />area of Australia and integrated the Australian mind and the<br />Australian feeling. All I can say is that I don't think there<br />is any invention that has done more for social development<br />and individual enrichment in our own country,<br />Now you gentlemen of the commercial broadcasting<br />stations are of course open to the gravest of suspicion<br />you are deeply suspected of trying to make a profit ( Laughter).<br />That, of course, is something which a lot of people dontt care<br />for so long as it is practised by other people. Good luck to youi may you go on and make profits, because the success<br />of your enterprises will maintain this rich flow of competitive<br />material and competitive secLvices -to the people of<br />As t , ali a I very well remember when I was small boy<br />not such a difficult feat I suppose living up in ' the<br />Mallee. A train arrived once a week and everybody went<br />up to see it arrive. Newspapers came in and I used to cut<br />out of them, when they reached me and the family, the pictures<br />of the celebrated cricketers cf the Clay and paste them on<br />the wall0 This was the one injection of pabulum, the pab~ ulum<br />of instruction or of entertainment for the week. Wise<br />people emulated the old gentleman that dre read about in<br />Somerset Maughamts stories if not in his autobiography<br />( Laughter) who, having received seven copies of the<br />newspaper for Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday Friday,<br />Saturday, perhaps Sunday read them one day at a Zimc,<br />so as never to be ahead of the news,,</p>
<p>Today all that is gone and it is very largely due to you tnat it has gone. Therefore, as the temporary occupant of the post of Prime Minister temporary for the next two and a half years ( Laughter) I welcome the chance<br />of coming down and saying to you just a little about how I feel over the work you are doing, over the service you are rendering. I express two hopes one is that your enterprises will go on forever, and the other is that you will never be in the red on the profit and loss accounts.</p>
<p>I declare this Conference open.</p>
