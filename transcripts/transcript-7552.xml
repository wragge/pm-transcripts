PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 4 APRIL 1989<br />
Following this morning's Caucus meeting, I will be<br />
recommending to His Excellency the Governor-General, the<br />
Honourable Bill Hayden AC, that he make the following<br />
ministerial appointments:<br />
the Hon Ros Kelly MP to be appointed as Minister for<br />
Telecommunications and Aviation Support; and<br />
Mr David Simmons MP to be appointed as Minister for<br />
Defence Science and Personnel.<br />
I will be proposing to the Governor-General that the<br />
swearing-in take place on Thursday 6 April.<br />
I am confident that in their new roles Mrs Kelly and Mr<br />
Simmons will make a significant contribution to the quality<br />
of my Ministry. </p>
