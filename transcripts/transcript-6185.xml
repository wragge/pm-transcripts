SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, HON. R. J. L. HAWKE, AC, MP.,<br />
FINANCIAL REVIEW DINNER 24 AUGUST 1983 SYDNEY<br />
Last night's Budget brings together our first five<br />
months' work on macro-economnic policy. It incorporatzes many<br />
of the policies that the Labor Party had developed in<br />
Opposition, and upon which we were elected in March. It<br />
necessarily reflects our adaptation t o the markedly<br />
different economic, and especially fiscal environment in<br />
which we found ourselves after the election.<br />
We were elected to arrest the decline in the<br />
Australian economy, symbolised by the huge loss of<br />
employment, the explosion of unemployment and the entrenched<br />
inflation in the period leading up to our election. We were<br />
elected to reverse the trends towards greater inequality in<br />
Australian society that seven years of conservative policies<br />
had greatly exacerbated. And we were elected to bring<br />
Australians together: to end the confrontation and division<br />
that had marred Australian economic life, perhaps most<br />
notably in industrial relations and relations with the<br />
States. These three areas of commitment are closely<br />
inter-related. Sustained economic recovery Sustained<br />
non-inflationary growth will not be possible without a </p>
<p>greater sense of common purpose than Australia has known in<br />
recent years. And it will not be possibl. e to build that<br />
greater sense of national purpzise around the restoration of<br />
growth unless the benefits of growth, and the inevitable<br />
costs, are shared equitably.<br />
So our commitments to the restoration of<br />
non-inflationary growth, to bringing Australians together,<br />
and to the building of a more equitable Australia are parts<br />
of the same great program. The links between these<br />
commitments were an important focus of the National Economic<br />
Summit Conference. It is clear from the Budget that we have made a<br />
strong start on that program. The Budget embodies decisions<br />
announced in the May Statement and the Premiers' Conference,<br />
together with decisions in related areas, especially<br />
monetary and wages policy.<br />
The task facing us after our election was daunting,<br />
especially after we learnt on March 6 that the prospective<br />
deficit for 1983-84 was several billion doll. ars greater than<br />
the Australian community, and the Australian Labor Party,<br />
had been led to believe.<br />
We were committed to introducing a range of new<br />
programs in the interests of national economic recovery </p>
<p>and equity. But at the same time we had to reduce the<br />
prospective deficit, so as to avoid exessive strain on<br />
financial markets in the process of recovery.<br />
My Government formed the view that a deficit around<br />
billion would provide substantial direct stimulus to<br />
economic activity, while avoiding excessive pressures on<br />
financial markets. In the event, we were able to come in<br />
slightly below that figure.<br />
Estimates of the prospective Budget deficit if the<br />
policies of the previous government had been left intact<br />
have varied through the year, in the light of changing<br />
economic conditions and prospects, and of additional<br />
information on the full-year costs of new spending proposals<br />
introduced in the last months of Liberal National Party<br />
government. Revised estimates of the costs of Fraser programs<br />
in 1983-84 added substantially to the prospective deficit,<br />
by over $ 800 million from the March figures. In the other<br />
direction, a better outlook for economic growth in 1983-84,<br />
itself partly attributable to greater confidence in the<br />
economy under the policies of my Government, lowered the<br />
prospective deficit somewhat. </p>
<p>The final official figuring indicated that, even<br />
with the better growth prospects under our policies, we<br />
requ-ired net reductions of over six hundred million dollars<br />
through discretionary changes to revenues and outlays, to<br />
achieve the final deficit of $ 8.4 billion.<br />
You now all have a reasonable idea of how we got<br />
there. It is a matter of considerable pride to me that we<br />
have achieved our goal of restraining the deficit to under<br />
billion while putting into place a number of our most<br />
important programs, in job creation, housing, social<br />
security and welfare, including Medicare; and without major<br />
general tax measures.<br />
We have in the May Statement and the Budget:<br />
directly-assisted employment through the allocation<br />
of over $ 300 million on job creation schemes for<br />
the long-term unemployed and by expanding<br />
Government capital expenditure both directly via<br />
Commonwealth spending and through the States;<br />
concentrated additiona. gross social welfare<br />
payments totalling several hundred million on those<br />
most severely affected by recession, notably single<br />
unemployed and pensioners with children; </p>
<p>introduced a fairer method of financing the health<br />
system based on ability to pay;<br />
reformed the assistance provided to home buyers<br />
both to improve equity and stimulate higher<br />
activity; increased education allowances and funding, with a<br />
more equitable distribution of resources according<br />
to need;<br />
abolished or reduced some of the more . blatant<br />
hand-outs and taxation inequities that were<br />
introduced or condoned by our predecessors, and<br />
taken action that was long overdue on<br />
superannuation taxation, asset testing of pensions,<br />
restricting eligibility for the over 70' s pension<br />
to those in most need, tightening tax avoidance<br />
legislation, strengthening section 26( a) so as to<br />
improve our ability to tax captial gains, and<br />
reducing a number of other sectional tax or<br />
spending concessions.<br />
We were able to implement new high priority<br />
programs within our deficit target and without major general<br />
tax increases, mainly because we effected reductions of one </p>
<p>and a half billion dollars inl expenditure and tax<br />
concessions on programs that we inherited from, the previous<br />
government. To put this achievement into perspective, the<br />
so-called " Razor Gang" of the previous government, with<br />
great fanfare over a much longer period of time, achieved'<br />
lasting reductions in outlays totalling only a few hundred<br />
million dollars. Because of our reductions in outlays in programs<br />
that we inherited from the previous government, we were able<br />
to implement the substantial improvements in public support<br />
for some of the most needy in our society, at a-net cost of<br />
little more than $ 100 million in the Social Security area.<br />
Similarly, we were able to implement the first home-owners<br />
scheme, which will greatly enhance the prospects of young<br />
Australians owning their own homes at the same time as it<br />
stimulates activity in the building industry, with net<br />
reductions in private sector housing's demands on the<br />
budget. These decisions clearly reflect the commitment of<br />
this Government to making Australia a more equitable<br />
society. We have tried to do this gradually, without<br />
placing excessively large and sudden burdens of adjustment<br />
on any Australians, while placing the overall burdenL of<br />
restraint on Australians who are in a relatively good<br />
position to bear it. Ta king the May Statement and Budyet<br />
measures together, I believe that we have succeeded In this<br />
a im. </p>
<p>More generally, we believe that lasting reform of<br />
the Australian fiscal system must be a gradual process.<br />
This is consistent with our approach to wider economic<br />
management. We see no point in producing a flash of<br />
recovery, to be followed soon by a return to stagnation.<br />
Only steady growth over long periods can provIde the base<br />
for major improvements in the outlook for employment. Only<br />
steady growth over long periods can provide the base from<br />
which Australia can again provide worthwhile opportunities<br />
and reasonable living standards for all its people.<br />
So this year, and in this Budget, we have sought to<br />
establish the foundations for future growth. We have sought<br />
to avoid an atmosphere of unpredictability and instability.<br />
The Budget has therefore been designed to ensure an<br />
adequate, but not excessive, stimulus to activity. The May<br />
statement and the Budget measures together will help to rein<br />
in the Budget deficit in future years so that rising private<br />
sector activity wfll not be faced with excessive competition<br />
from the Government sector in financial markets as recovery<br />
proceeds in the years ahead.<br />
The Budget increases Government outlays by 15.8 per<br />
cent, only a fLew per cent below the increase of 18.5 per<br />
cent in 1982-83. We believe such growth In outlays is<br />
appropriate in a situation of low demand and capacity<br />
utilisation. The rate of increase in outlays will clearly<br />
need to be reduced considerably as the recovery gathers<br />
strength. </p>
<p>We were conscious of the need to avoid large<br />
increases in taxation as part of our aim to establish a<br />
stable environment in which business will invest and create<br />
job opportunities. The taxation rneasuret we have adopted<br />
have therefore concentrated on combatting tax evasion and<br />
avoidance, closing tax loopholes, correcting some anomalies<br />
in the coverage of both excise duties and sales taxes, and<br />
maintaining the real level of excise rates in future years<br />
without the destablising jumps in rates that have occurred<br />
in the past. An improved climate of industrial relations<br />
assisted us in obtaining an undertaking from oil refining<br />
companies that they would increase their use of<br />
Australian-produced crude. This undertaking has allowed us<br />
to avoid the introduction of a crude petroleum import duty<br />
in the immediate future.<br />
While preparing the Budget, we discussed a number<br />
of changes in the taxation system that would render it<br />
economically more efficient, and more equitable as well. We<br />
believe that measures we have introduced on the taxation of<br />
superannuation lump sums, tax avoidance, section 26( a),<br />
sales tax and excise anomnalies, indexation of excise rates,<br />
and removal of some anomalous tax expenditures all have this<br />
effect. Obviously more could be done to widen the revenue<br />
base and improve taxation efficiency and equity. We will </p>
<p>continue to review carefully all of the main alternatives<br />
and we will continue to give considerable weight to<br />
stability and continuity in policy.<br />
But when reform is clearly necessary, and when it<br />
can be effected wthout imposing costs of disruption which<br />
exceed the benefits, we will not shirk from the necessary<br />
decisions. Our record already demonstrates our willingness<br />
to introduce unpopular measures where we consider them~ to be<br />
necessary. Hard choices and decisions will continue to be<br />
needed even as Australia recovers from the recent recession.<br />
There is no easy way to remove distortions of the kind that<br />
have dragged down Australian society and the Australian<br />
economy in recent years.<br />
Our own willingness to face the necessary<br />
decisions contrasts with the approach of the Liberal and<br />
National parties. Liberal and National Party policies would<br />
have led to a billion deficit on the information<br />
provided to us on March 5. Opposition leaders have called<br />
for a deficit of around $ 7.0 billion or even lower In the<br />
current financial year. And yet at every step the Liberal<br />
and National Parties have opposed the hard decisions that<br />
were necessary to reduce the deficit to $ 8.4 billion.<br />
They say they would have reduced the deficit by<br />
another couple of billion dollars. If they had been in </p>
<p>government and had achieved this result, we would not be<br />
looking forward to recovery in the year ahead.<br />
But more fundamentally, they would not do what they<br />
say they would do. On Monday in Canberra, as Andrew Peacock<br />
stepped from the camel with unerring accuracy, he promised<br />
100 per cent Commonwealth funding for the Alice Springs to<br />
Darwin railway, prior to the results of an independent<br />
economic evaluation of the project. The Opposition parties<br />
defeated our tax avoidance and evasion recoupment<br />
legislation in the Senate, greatly exacerbating our<br />
difficulties in preparing this Budget. They ha-ve opposed<br />
almost every expenditure cut and new revenue measure<br />
although the Shadow Treasurer, to give him his due, did hint<br />
to the Parliament that income tax increases would be one<br />
avenue of reducing the deficit.<br />
The Opposition parties have risen to the peaks of<br />
hypocrisy with yesterday's movement in the Senate towards<br />
making the new withholding taxation system unworkable. This<br />
is their own system. The fundamental features of the scheme<br />
are as laid out Last year by the Liberal Treasurer, john.<br />
Howard, except for defining the industry coverage and for<br />
three changes which make the system less onerous: the<br />
reduction of the basic withholding rate from 25 per cent to<br />
per cent; an increase in the minimum sc-ale of building<br />
project that falls within the system from $ 3,000 to $ 10,000;<br />
and deferral of the commencement date from 1 July to 1<br />
September. </p>
<p>11.<br />
No new system of collecting large amounts of<br />
revenue can be introduced without soine administrative<br />
problems and without some aa~ xiety in the community. Mr<br />
Howard's withholding tax system is no exeeption. But now a<br />
year after they announced the new system, and several months<br />
after the legislation was passed by the Parliament with<br />
Liberal support in the Senate, the Liberal. s have moved to<br />
disallow the regulations that are necessary to make it work.<br />
This is Liberal National Party hypocrisy at its<br />
most blatant. This is the same Liber-al Party hypocrisy that<br />
announced monetary targets and then over-ran th. em five years<br />
in a row. This is the same Liberal Party hypocrisy that now<br />
criticizes as excessively large, award wage increases a<br />
little above 4 per cent this year and 5 or 6 per cent over<br />
the course of next year, and average earnings increases of7<br />
per cent in the current financial year, after increases of<br />
around 13 or 14 per cent in each of the three preceeding<br />
years under Liberal stewardship. This is the Liberal Party<br />
hypocrisy that concealed from the Australian people through<br />
a crucial election campaign that Australia, under unchanged<br />
Liberal policies, was facing a prospective Budget deficit of<br />
over $ 9 billion in 1983-84. This is the Liberal Party whose<br />
Treasurer talked of the figuring being rubbery a few days<br />
after a Budget. </p>
<p>12.<br />
one crucial difference between my Government's<br />
approach to economic management, and that of our<br />
predecessor, is that we mean what we say.<br />
This integrity of approach is as crucial in other<br />
areas of economic managem~ ent as it is in fiscal policy.<br />
While fiscal policy is obviously of central<br />
importance in establishing a base for economic recov; ery, it<br />
can be effective only within1 appropriate monetary and wages<br />
policies. In these areas, we have gone a long way since<br />
March in implementing policies which will support recovery<br />
while holding inflation on a downward path.<br />
As we have said on many occasions, we will allow<br />
sufficient money growth to finance the likely and desirable<br />
rate of growth in nominal gross domestic product.<br />
The " fight inflation first" strategy of our<br />
predecessors implied the tightest possible monetary policy.<br />
In practice, monetary policy over the past seven years was<br />
characterised more by inconsistency, by the setting of<br />
unrealistic targets, and by failure to achieve them.<br />
With our policies supported by the Prices and<br />
Incomes Accord, our approach is different. We will<br />
implem-tent consistent, firm policies that accommodate stron~ g<br />
growth, but not inflation. </p>
<p>This year the choice of the target range for money<br />
supply growth that corresponds to this principle is<br />
complicated by two unusual factors -both associated with<br />
the severity of the recent, decline in the economy and the<br />
speed of the turnaround which we expect this year.<br />
The first is the expected change in the velocity of<br />
circulation of money that is the relationship between<br />
monetary growth and nominal GDP growth.<br />
During the r ecent recession, as in past economic<br />
downturns, velocity fell considerably. In more normal<br />
times, velocity tends to increase, more rapidly during a<br />
strong recovery. While It is therefore appropriate to set the M3<br />
projection below the expected growth in n~ ominal GDP, the<br />
size of the appropriate adjustment is a matter for fine<br />
judgement. The second uncertainty revolves around the speed of<br />
the expected pick-up in economic activity during 1983-84.<br />
We are expecting a sharp increase in nominal output<br />
probably of the order of 14 per cent or so through the<br />
course of 1983-84. 13. </p>
<p>14.<br />
But predicting the turning points in economic<br />
activity is notoriously difficult, so that the actual real<br />
growth could differ from our current expectations.<br />
As the Treasurer announced last night, the<br />
Government decided to move the growth in financial<br />
aggregates gradually downward to a degree consistent with M3<br />
growth in the range of 9 t1-o11 per cent over the twelve<br />
months to the June quarter 1984.<br />
But as the Treasurer also indicated, we intend to<br />
review the projection in the course of the year. At the<br />
review, we will ensure that changed circumstances do not<br />
mean that the money growth that we have foreshadowed is<br />
either financing avoidable inflation, or restraining<br />
feasible non-inflationary growth.<br />
Fighting inflation and unemployment at the same<br />
time requires us to adopt a balanced approach to management<br />
of the exchange rate. We will not allow deliberate<br />
over-valuation as an instrument of anti-inflation policies,<br />
and so will avoid one source of damage to the<br />
competitiveness of our export and import-competing<br />
Industries. We should remember that Australia will be affected<br />
by pressures in international financial markets, whatever </p>
<p>happens at home. Australian real interest rates will tend<br />
to rise if United States real interest rates rise. On our<br />
recent visit to the United States, the Treasurer and I had<br />
extensive discussions on monetary developments with Tresury<br />
Secretary, Donald Regan, the Chairman of the Federal<br />
Reserve, Paul Volcker, other senior officials in the United<br />
States, and leading participants in the New York financial<br />
markets. While these left us with a great deal of<br />
confidence in the short-term strength of the United States<br />
recovery, there was also cause for some anxiety that the<br />
continuation of extremely high Budget deficits could lead to<br />
upward pressure on United States interest rates as private<br />
investment expanded in the period ahead.<br />
While we cannot insul. ate ourselves completely from<br />
financial developments abroad, conditioi~ s within our own<br />
financial markets can exacerbate or ameliorate the pressures<br />
coming from overseas. Given the possibility that<br />
international financial markets will exert upward pressure<br />
on Australian interests rates, we will be working to ensure<br />
that developments at home do not compound the threat to the<br />
recovery of private investment.<br />
Although there is wide acceptance that this year's<br />
deficit of $ 8.4 billion is appropriate in the current<br />
financial year, the Commonwealth will need to reduce the<br />
demand it makes on financial markets as private investment<br />
Increases in the process of recovery. </p>
<p>16.<br />
A number of the fiscal measures that we have<br />
introduced in recent months have their main effect in<br />
reducing the Budget deficit not in 1983-84, but in later<br />
years. The process of recovery itself will tend to reduce<br />
future deficits, by raising revenue and reducing<br />
recession-related outlays.<br />
It is not clear at this early stage whether this<br />
cyclical effect, together with the structural effects of the<br />
May Statement and the Budget, will reduce next-year' s<br />
deficit enough to meet our stability objectives without<br />
further discretionary action. This will depend very much on<br />
the course of private investment in the recovery, as well as<br />
on wider developments in financial markets. Decisions in<br />
this area can safely be left until later. But as I told the<br />
Brisbane Chamber of Commerce two weeks ago, it is likely<br />
that further reductions in the structural Budget deficit<br />
will be required for next year.<br />
My colleagues and I had little more than three<br />
months within which to examine critically the expenditure<br />
commitments which we had Inherited from the previous<br />
government, from the time of the Summit to the completion of<br />
work on the expenditure side of the Budget. </p>
<p>17.<br />
This Budget embodies a considerable reordering of<br />
priorities towards the requirements of economic recovery<br />
and, in the welfare area, of the genuirely needy in our<br />
society. We will. go much further in the full year lead ing<br />
up to the next budget and in the many years that this<br />
Government has ahea d of it.<br />
Our expenditure review process will become part of<br />
the normal operations of Government. We will continue to<br />
reallocate expenditure in line with the requirements of<br />
equity and growth as we reduce the structural Budget deficit<br />
in the course of economic recovery.<br />
Our fiscal and monetary policies are underpinned by<br />
the Prices and Incomes Accord. When the Australian economy<br />
was struggling into recovery i~ n the so-called resources boom<br />
in 1981, a wages explosion helped to turn a great<br />
opportunity into a disaster. That tragic episode will not<br />
be repeated. The Budget and the monetary policy announced last<br />
night both support the Prices and incomes Accord. We see<br />
support for a 4.3 per cent increase In award wages, as the<br />
only increase this year, as an investment in wage moderation<br />
in the process of recovery. The efforts this Budget makes<br />
in employment creation, social security, health and other<br />
areas will help us to realise a full return on that<br />
investment. The Government is meeting its commitments under </p>
<p>the Accord, and expects full compliance with the decisions<br />
of the Arbitration Commission.<br />
The Medicare arrangements announced last night will<br />
reduce the increase in~ consumer prices in the first half of<br />
1984 by a few percentage points. The A. C. T. U. acceptad at<br />
the Summit that, within the context of the return to<br />
centralised wage-fixing, this should be fully reflected in a<br />
lower rate of wage Increases through 1984. This will<br />
support the expansion of employment and the sustenance of<br />
recovery as the momentum of economic expansion picks up<br />
through this financial year and into the next._<br />
The fiscal, monetary and wages policies which we<br />
have put into place over the past five months have been<br />
built with widespread community support-from the time of the<br />
Summit. The Budgbt deficit is slightly lower and the wages<br />
estimate slightly higher than in Scenario A at the Summit.<br />
We have heeded the Summit's call to allocate social<br />
security and other outlays more closely towards those in<br />
need. The May Statement and the budget measures together<br />
ask some restraint of Australians who are inl a relatively<br />
good position to bear it, as agreed at the Summit. </p>
<p>The Budget assumes an outlook for growth that is a<br />
little better than envisaged in Scenario A: year on year<br />
growth of a bit above 3.0 per cent compared with 2.7 Per<br />
cent, helped by the breaking of the drought, an im-proved<br />
outlook for private dwelling investment following the<br />
introduction of our new housing policies, and a lift in the<br />
private consumption forecast in the light of improved<br />
consumer confidence since the Summit.<br />
On the other hand, consumer prices are expected to<br />
rise by 7.5 per cent, compared with 6.2 per cent in<br />
Scenario A. Part of the increase in anticipated price<br />
increases is for food, and is the other side of the coin to<br />
the higher expectations about farm growth following the<br />
ending of the drought. Scenario A anticipated indexation of<br />
excise, and other increases in excise announced in the<br />
Budget are estimated to contribute 0.3 per cent to consumer<br />
price increases in the year ahead.<br />
Year-on-year growth of a little over 3 per cent<br />
will prob ably be associated with growth through the year of<br />
about 5 per cent. This is a strong reversal of our recent<br />
experience. I know some commentators expect an ev~ en better<br />
outcome. They may be right; and our monetary policies will<br />
not prevent such an outcome if through the year it seems to<br />
be achievable in a tion-iflationary way. </p>
<p>The employment outlook presented in the Budget<br />
papers, like that on growth, is cautious. Nevertheless an<br />
increase in 1.5 per cent through the year in employment<br />
represents a sharp reversal of the disastrous decline in<br />
employment in the year or so before we took office, as<br />
promised in the election campaign.<br />
We are confident that the economic policy base has<br />
been well prepared for a return to growth and a deceleration<br />
of inflation through the period imnmediatel~ y ahead.<br />
But whether Australian living standards continue to<br />
rise beyond the life of the present Parliament and into the<br />
next, and beyond, depends on our success in allocating ourresources<br />
to their most productive uses. Productive use of<br />
our resources requires acceptance of new ways of doing<br />
things, structural change in our economy, rapidly changing<br />
patterns of foreign trade, and high levels of investment<br />
from home and abroad.<br />
An Australian society that is broadly united on the<br />
great national goals, that is seen by most of its citizens<br />
as a fair society, and which offers its people security of<br />
incomes and employment, wll embrace these changes. But a<br />
divided Australia, a society that is suspicious of its<br />
Government, will cling to what it has. </p>
<p>21.<br />
The measures for revitalisation of the steel<br />
industry based on co--operative endeavours to raise<br />
productivity, for which the 1933-84 Budget provides funds<br />
for the first time, embody tZhese fundamnenta. realities'.<br />
A conservative Australia, an Australia that is<br />
afraid of change, will be condemned to declining living<br />
standards and an increasingly insecure place in a rapidly<br />
changing world.<br />
Long-term growth in our living standards is<br />
feasible only if we maintain open investment arld trade<br />
policies. But these policies will be politically feasible<br />
only if Australians believe that the benefits of prosperity<br />
are being shared equitably.<br />
Only an Australia characterised by rising<br />
employment, falling inflation, and effective social security<br />
arrangements based'on need will provide a congenial<br />
environment for policies directed at long-term growth.<br />
We are confident that Australia has made a good<br />
beginning with the 1983-84 Budget.<br />
