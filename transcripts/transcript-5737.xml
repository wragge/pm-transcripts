FOR MEDIA THURSDAY, 21 JANUARY, 1982<br />
VISIT OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE<br />
COMMISION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES<br />
The President of the Commission of the European Communites,<br />
Mr. Gaston Thorn, accompanied by his wife and officials,<br />
will visit Australia from Thursday, 25 February to Monday,<br />
1 March?<br />
I am looking forward to welcoming Mr. Thorn as the first<br />
President of the Commission to visit Australia.<br />
The visit will provide an additional opportunity to further<br />
broaden and improve our relationship with the community.<br />
The recent Australia/ EC Ministerial discussions in Brussells<br />
has laid the foundation for a constructive and useful visit<br />
to Australia by Mr. Thorn.<br />
As well as visiting Canberra the President will visit<br />
New South Wales and Western Australia, including the<br />
Pilbara region. 000---</p>
