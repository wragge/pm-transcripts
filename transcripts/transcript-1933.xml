ON<br />
TARIFF BOARD<br />
Annual Report: Ministerial Statement<br />
,[ From the ' Parliamentary Debates,' 9 October 19681<br />
Mr GORTON ( Higgins-Prime Minister)<br />
-Mr Speaker, I ask leave to make a statement<br />
on the Tariff Board report just tabled.<br />
Mr SPEAKER-There being no objection,<br />
leave is granted.<br />
Mr GORTON-Mr Speaker, in the<br />
course of its last annual report, the Tariff<br />
Board outlined the changes which it considered<br />
to be desirable in its approach to its<br />
own work. In the report for 1967-68, which<br />
my colleague the Minister for Shipping and<br />
Transport and Acting Minister for Trade<br />
and Industry ( Mr Sinclair) has just tabled,<br />
the Board has reported upon its study of<br />
the structure and levels of protection now<br />
operating in the Australian Customs Tariff.<br />
It is, I think, important to understand the<br />
nature of the information contained in the<br />
two main appendices-Nos. 3 and 4-to<br />
this report. Appendix 3 is a compilation of<br />
what is termed the ' significant tariff rates'<br />
applying to individual products or groups<br />
of products, listed by tariff item. For comparative<br />
purposes, the Board has included<br />
statistical information about Australian production,<br />
imports and the estimated Australian<br />
demand for each item. In addition, to<br />
reduce this information to somewhat more<br />
manageable proportions, the Board has provided<br />
a shorter table in Appendix 4 in which<br />
the value of production of each industry<br />
is distributed between three leveks of protection<br />
measured by the significant tariff rate,<br />
namely over 50%, 21 to 50% and not<br />
over 20%.<br />
23715/ 68 In short, the Board has linked information<br />
on production and imports to a rearranged<br />
version of the Customs Tariff.<br />
Within the limits imposed by the form of<br />
the available data, the outcome is a useful<br />
conspectus of the existing levels and structure<br />
of tariff rates which are applied to the<br />
final production of Australian industries. It<br />
reflects, to an important degree, decisions<br />
taken by the Government in the past on<br />
recommendations made by the Tariff Board.<br />
In interpreting the information in the<br />
appendices to which I have referred, honourable<br />
members will have in mind important<br />
qualifications to which the Board itself<br />
has drawn attention. For example, the<br />
report refers to the fact that tariff rates<br />
which have not been reviewed for many<br />
years may substantially overstate the current<br />
duty needs of the industries concerned.<br />
Moreover, it is the actual duty rates applying<br />
to the final products of industries which<br />
are summarised in the tables. These may<br />
differ substantially from the effective rates,<br />
which represent the degree of protection<br />
extended to the production processes of<br />
those industries. For most of the products<br />
included in the appendices the Board has<br />
not bcen able to calculate effective rates of<br />
protection because sufficient data are not<br />
available to it, and it has therefore not been<br />
able to classify industries according to<br />
effective rates of protection. This in-formation<br />
will only -become known to the Board<br />
in the course of future public inquiries. The </p>
<p>Board considers that the effective rate is<br />
a better and more equitable method of<br />
measuring protection than the nominal rates<br />
shown in the Tariff.<br />
For these and other reasons, the Board<br />
has emphasised that the ranking of particular<br />
products or groups of products in<br />
its tables summarising present levels of tariff<br />
rates should not be taken as indicating the<br />
view which the Board would take at a<br />
future tariff inquiry of the desirability of<br />
assisting an industry or the level of any<br />
protection it would recommend.<br />
In the future, as in the past, recommendations<br />
for changes in the level of duties will<br />
be made only after public inquiries at which<br />
all interested parties may be heard. The<br />
information in the appendices to the Board's<br />
report does not pre-judge in any way the<br />
individual recommendations which the<br />
Board will make in the future after public<br />
inquiry. Requests from the Board for<br />
references designed to facilitate public<br />
inquiries into areas of the Tariff which the<br />
Board considers to be in need of review will<br />
of course be considered in accordance with<br />
normal procedures for determining references<br />
to the Board. Such inquiries would<br />
follow the generally accepted procedures of<br />
the Board conducting public inquiries at<br />
which the views of all interested parties are<br />
welcomed. Recommendations by the Board<br />
as a result of such reviews would be considered<br />
by the Government in accordance<br />
with current practice.<br />
It will be noted that the Board has established,<br />
for its own guidance, points of<br />
reference which it has expressed in terms of<br />
effective rates of protection of 25% and<br />
The Board acknowledges that the<br />
assessment of these points involved a considerable<br />
element of judgment. They are not<br />
to be regarded as precise but as providing<br />
orders of magnitude which the Board<br />
believes will assist it in its approach to its<br />
work. The Government has considered this<br />
report in the context of our established and<br />
well tried tariff policies. There has been no<br />
change in those policies. The Government is committed to ensuring the growth of a<br />
strong manufacturing industry which is in<br />
fact at the very foundation of the Government's<br />
population building policies. The<br />
development of manufacturing industry is<br />
encouraged in many ways, and most notably<br />
by means of the Tariff. The Government has<br />
always been prepared adequately to protect,<br />
and will continue adequately to protect,<br />
economic and efficient industries. The<br />
Government will also afford adequate protection<br />
to industries of high importance<br />
from the standpoint of our strategic or other<br />
vital national interests.<br />
Tariff policy has been and remains the<br />
responsibility of the Government, both in<br />
general and in relation to every single<br />
decision. In making these decisions we look<br />
to the Tariff Board for sound and practical<br />
advice. The Board has developed for almost<br />
half a century as an independent body. The<br />
Government does not attempt to set for the<br />
Board the procedures it should follow. It is<br />
therefore quite proper for the Board to<br />
examine its own methods of work, the way<br />
it shall conduct its inquiries and the bases<br />
on which it makes its recommendations. The<br />
Government expects the Board to take all<br />
possible steps to improve the quality of its<br />
advice. To enable the Government to exercise its<br />
responsibility for tariff policy, it is clearly<br />
necessary that it should have available to it<br />
in the Board's reports the fullest possible<br />
knowledge of all the elements relevant to<br />
each particular case. We would, for example,<br />
expect the Board to report fully not only on<br />
the effective rates of protection that would<br />
be afforded by the nominal rates of duty<br />
recommended but also on other aspects that<br />
might be relevant to a consideration of the<br />
protection of the particular goods under<br />
reference. It will, of course, continue to be<br />
the Board's role to advise, and it will continue<br />
to be the Government's role, in determining<br />
levels of protection, to decide<br />
whether or not it will follow the advice<br />
given. These have been our policies and they<br />
have served us well. We have no intention of<br />
changing them.<br />
