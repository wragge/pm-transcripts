SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, MR. R. G. MENZIES<br />
AT ME TING OF ST; TE EXECUTIVE OF LIBEAL PARTY<br />
OF VICTORIA ON JEDNESDAY 2ND MARCH 1960.<br />
Fellow Members of Parliament and Ladies and Gentlemen:<br />
I want to make a small correction before I say anything<br />
else. The President referred to me as being " sun-tanned"; I'm<br />
not: I'm hard-boiled. I thought when I was in Indonesia recently<br />
and Malaya that it was impossible for anybody to be hotter<br />
than I was but I've felt hotter still in the last couple of<br />
days in Melbourne. ( Laughter)<br />
Now I'm not going to be here very long because I'm in the<br />
middle of a lot of work in my Office and we have a Cabinet this<br />
afte-noon, but I do want to say one or two things to you.<br />
First of all, of course, I reply to your welcome with the<br />
very greatest of pleasure. It's one of the sorrows of my life<br />
that being in Canberra, necessarily, for the great bulk of the<br />
time, and going to other States from time to time, I find myself<br />
very seldom in my o. wn town and among my onm people, and you've<br />
no idea what a pleasure I get out of coming here and seeing old<br />
friends and feeling that I'm in my own place. If that could<br />
happen more frequently, perhaps, Mr. President even the low<br />
Sgrowls might disappear. ( Laughter)<br />
I think, perhaps, I ought to say a word or two to you first<br />
of 1ll about matters outside Australia. I was very struck on<br />
this recent journey to Malaya and to Indonesia, by one very<br />
significant fact. In Indonesia, Independence was secured as a<br />
result of armed conflict and there were, and are, great racial<br />
hatreds. It's a ve,' y astonishing thing to be in Indonesia and<br />
to realise how almost completely the Dutch influence has been<br />
expelled, not always to the advantage of Indonesia; though<br />
it's their own country and they'll govern it in their own way.<br />
But one sees there all the survivls of acute racial cleavage and,<br />
as I say, to a degree, hatred, -hereas up in Malaya Independenr<br />
was achieved as a result of peaceful arrangement between the<br />
British and the Malayans. The whole atmosphere is different:<br />
Europeans are going around about their affairs; large and<br />
famous business houses in Kuala Lumpur and Penang are conducting<br />
their operations. You go up through the country and if you see<br />
some big engineering piece of work it's ' a guinea to a gooseberry'<br />
that the Chief Engineer is called " Cmpbell" ( Laughter).<br />
I didn't find any of this atmosphere of fear of the outside<br />
influence or detestation of the Europeans. And the result is<br />
that in Malaya the Government, under a most enlightening and<br />
sensible man in their Prime Minister, the Tunku Abdul Rahman,<br />
is going forward; they know that it's their responsibility to<br />
conduct their country and, if I may say so, they seem to be<br />
doing it with great efficiency and with high civilization.<br />
Now I think there is something to be learned from all this.<br />
The British history and tradition of converting Colonies into<br />
independent States is, of course, well known and it deserves to<br />
be better recognised all round the world. It's a most honourable<br />
history. It is, in effect, a unique history. But there<br />
are still some people who prefer to be late rather than early<br />
with the creation of self-government. I think I used to belong<br />
to the school of thought myself which felt that you must be<br />
very, very, very cautious about reaching the right time. Today,<br />
I'm not so sure. Today I'm more and more satisfied that the<br />
important thing is that people should be able to rule themselves<br />
and that if you help them to reach that stage, if you don't hold<br />
them back, if you give them every conceivable kind of help and<br />
training and encouragement, then when they do achieve their<br />
independence, they will do it on the basis of friendship. And<br />
we need that because we're not a very big country. le need it.<br />
That, to my mind was the 5reat genius of Harold Macmillan's </p>
<p>visit to Africa a magnificent journey. It ali: ays sounds quite<br />
simple these journeys always do, until you take them yourself<br />
but they're not as easy as all that. And his, of course, was far<br />
more difficult than mine because he is the Prime Minister of one<br />
of the great powers of the world and, indeed, and I think in the<br />
long run, the most influential country in the world. ( Applause)<br />
And he goes down on a journey, starting with Ghana and<br />
ending with South Africa, going through half a dozen different<br />
countries each of them with utterly different problems from its<br />
neighbour, each of them in a different stage of development;<br />
some of them with forceful and even hostile leaders and some of<br />
them with friendly leaders and, of course, ultimately, in South<br />
Africa, the classic example of a country in which the racial<br />
problem has attracted the interest of the whole world, though<br />
not necessarily the intelligent interest of the whole world, because<br />
it is a tremendously complex matter. And he's gone down<br />
there; he's made speeches; he's met people; he's discussed<br />
their problems with them and I will undertake to say he has, in<br />
this one journey, profoundly influenced the future history of the<br />
whole of the African Continent.<br />
Cynical onlookers who think politicians like myself are all<br />
words, and take jaunts what does it matter what they think<br />
about me but I say this about Mr. Macmillan: I think this<br />
journey of his has made such a profound impact on the future<br />
history of Africa that it will be regarded as an " epoch-making"<br />
visit. And the outstanding thing about it is that wherever he's<br />
gone he's made it clear when he's talked to Africans, to the<br />
indigenous inhabitants of these countries: " vJe are not your<br />
jailers; we are your friends; we look forward to the time when<br />
you are going to rule yourselves and we're not going to be too<br />
petty about how you come to rule yourself. le want you to know<br />
and we want you to fed that you are to come to your Independence<br />
with feelings of friendship."<br />
It seems simple doesn't it? I bet a lot of the things he<br />
had to say weren't very popular with some Europeans in Africa<br />
because whether we like it or not there are always conflicts<br />
between the young turbulent native element, getting education and<br />
getting a feeling of freedom and a great ambition for their own<br />
country, and the older European inhabitatns who feel that things<br />
haven't gone too badly and they might, with advantage; be left<br />
alone. And Macmillan's visit has gone like a breath of fresh air<br />
on all these matters. He has spoken in South Africa with great<br />
frankness but on my advices, without leaving one ounce of rancour<br />
behind him. This is a marvellous combination of firmness and<br />
tact and good sense and imagination for the future. And it's<br />
important that he should have done it in Africa because though we<br />
talk about one hot spot in the world after another and they<br />
seem to change every year very few people doubt that the<br />
developments in the African Continent in the next ten years are<br />
going to occupy an increasingly important place in the thoughts<br />
of all of us. And of course, will have increasing significance<br />
for us. Don't forget that from our point of view it's a very<br />
grave matter that hundreds of millions of people in China should<br />
have cone under communism; it would be a double tragedy if the<br />
Communists, who have their eyes on Africa, should succeed in<br />
establishing themselves by capitalising the interests, the enthusiasm,<br />
the emotions of the native inhabitants and pointing out<br />
that their white colonial powers are being unfair to them and<br />
failing to see their point of view. This was a mater stroke by<br />
Harold Macmillan.<br />
Now I might, perhaps, turn from there to our position at<br />
home. I'm not going to make an orthodox, political speech I'll<br />
probably have to make one or two before I'm very much older.<br />
I'll be out on a stump in Latrobe where I've already been preceded<br />
by my friend, Mr. Calwell, who has my warmest good wishes<br />
for this election to Leadership. ( Laughter) </p>
<p>But the thing I want to talk to you about very briefly has<br />
nothing to do with . hat he is talng about. It has to do with<br />
what the President said this morning in an indirect way.<br />
Half of our problems as an organisation irise from the fact<br />
that we live under a Federal Constitution. I'm a great believer<br />
in a Federal Constitution nobody need suppose that I have any<br />
ambition to see all power concentrated at Canberra. But it's<br />
true that a lot of our problems crise from the fact that we do<br />
have a division of power. So does the Federal Government that<br />
has limited power over this and that, the State Government that<br />
has limited power ovo-that and this and there will ways be,<br />
in a sense, conflicts which don't need to be conflicts of<br />
hostility but there will always be questions of jurisdiction;<br />
there will always be in the feeling of a State Parliament or a<br />
State Government a sense that it is too dependent upon the<br />
Commonwealth in the financial field; there will always be a<br />
feeling in Canberra that while we have the macjor responsibility<br />
in financial matters, we don't have and you will agree the<br />
major authority to deal with them.<br />
All these things produce differences of opinion and arguments<br />
and they will always go on as arguments. But the thing<br />
that we have to remember is that we are all one people. I feel<br />
strange in some places in Australia Melbourne's not one of them<br />
I hasten to say to discover that I'm an outsider. I've nothing<br />
to do with that State, I'm something to do with Canberra.<br />
And I always have to tap them on the shoulder and say: " I'd like<br />
to remind you that every man in this place is a constituent of<br />
mine because I happen to be Pri-e Minister and I am elected by<br />
exactly the same people only more". And that's to be remembered.<br />
It's the underlying element of unity which must be preserved<br />
and if you have that a sense of common destiny and of<br />
common responsibility then whatever discussions we may have<br />
about the details, one arising from some conflict of power,<br />
another, perhaps ,. rising from a conflict of. ideas, they don't<br />
matter. They're very healthy. I agree with the President. I<br />
like to have this low grumble, this low mur.. er. It's a very<br />
good thing; it shows that we're not dead. But I do beg of you<br />
to remember that over and above all that we are one people and<br />
just under that, but remarkably important, we are one Party. U', e<br />
were once, inl943, fourteen parties. ' Je became one, and let's<br />
never forget it. ' Je have presented to the people and to ourselves<br />
a spectacle of inity which the other side of politics<br />
envies in secret because it has been torn . sunder for years.<br />
All I say to you is: " Don't let us ignore what we see in<br />
front of us. Let's always come back to the fact that we are one<br />
party". You take the Commonwealth body. Je have a Federal<br />
Secretariat. And it's a very intelligent and very useful affair<br />
to have. But we don't forgot at Canberra that the whole of the<br />
field organisation in Australia is attended to by the State<br />
Divisions. : ithout that we would be helpless, ic could go to<br />
the newspapers; we could make speeches; we could go over the<br />
air but wo wrould have no organisation on the ground; none of<br />
this thing which is so vital to political success.<br />
While the State Divisions on the other hand remember that in<br />
the Federal Secretariat we have evolved a very considerable and<br />
useful thinking and policy scheme which, in relation to Federal<br />
matters, does work that can't be duplicated elsewhere, in relation<br />
to Federal problems. And, therefore, here again is the<br />
very proof of our unity. lemay appear to be different, but re<br />
are the same thing operating through various instruments,<br />
Now, I say that to you bucc. use that means that I'm saying<br />
that in our Party organisation work we should lways remember the<br />
Federal structure of the Constitution under which we all live.<br />
Therefore proposals to alter that Federal structure are the </p>
<p>concern of all of us, People occasionally think that a Constitutional<br />
amendment will resolve itself into an argument between<br />
one Parliament and another. That's not true. Constitutional<br />
amendments concern the whole people; they're not lawyers'<br />
tricks or lawyers' problems; they are the problems of ordinary<br />
men and wonon the lawyers may have to put them into form<br />
but ordinary men and iomen are affected by these matters.<br />
ile have just had a joint Parliamentary Committee on the<br />
Constitution at Canberra. It has made a massive report, a<br />
tremendous report, which I suppose very few people have had an<br />
opportunity of reading as yet. And about 40 or 50 amiendments<br />
to the Constitution were suggested. v-oll, I'm bound to say<br />
without being too discouraging, but I think that's a pretty<br />
optomistic approach to the problem. I've had a bit of experience<br />
trying to make one or two amendmonts to the Constitution<br />
( laughter) but I've never tried 57.<br />
As a matter of fact some of you will remember that in one<br />
year I think it was 1937 we had two amendments to the Constitution.<br />
One had to do with marketing orderly marketing<br />
notwithstanding Section 92. It came out of the Dried Fruits<br />
Case and was designed to help, among others, the dried fruit<br />
growers in the Murray Valley. And when it came to the polls I<br />
couldn't fail to notice that it was most heavily defeated in<br />
those areas. You never know. I hadn't a friend left. All my<br />
friends in Kooyong who weren't very interested in orderly marketing<br />
or dried fruits, or whatover it might be, used to look at me<br />
in the street with considerable distrust and I just scraped-home<br />
at the next election. It's a fact. I know a bit about Constitutional<br />
referendums.<br />
But at the same time we put up another proposal, lot me<br />
remind you, to give the Commonwealth Parlia! iont_ powo.: over<br />
Civil Aviation. Now you'd think, wouldn't you, that a problem<br />
of that kind was obviously a matter for Commonwealth treatment<br />
since you can get into an aircraft in Melbourne and be in Brisbane<br />
in a couple of hours. So what? Enthusiastically you think:<br />
We're in the habit of saying we vote If we don't<br />
understand it we vote " No" which, no doubt, is a very safe thing<br />
to do ( Laughter). And therefore I just want to tell you that<br />
nobody need anticipate that we're coming out tomorrow with a Bill<br />
to make 57 amendments in the Constitution. On the contrary.<br />
tWe're going to examine this great and massive document with loving<br />
care. I use theword " loving" in a metaphorical sense. It<br />
may be that some amendments will emerge as being worth consideration.<br />
I know myself of one or two problems that could, with advantage,<br />
be straightened out, particularly the relations between<br />
the two Houses on which I think that it's an unsatisfactory state<br />
of the law at the present time.<br />
But so that nobody will become involved in heated argument<br />
prematurely, let me say that we have not yet discussed in Cabinet<br />
this report. A lot of preliminary work is being done on it by<br />
my colleague, the Attorney-General, and I've been doing some<br />
reading on it myself, 3ut nobody need fear that there is going<br />
to be a sudden announc. iuent that this particular mass of amendments<br />
will be introduced to Parliament. We must discuss this<br />
with our own colleagues in the Party, we must commune between<br />
Members of the House of Representatives ,. nd ienators; we must<br />
exercise our own judgment as to what is practical, as to what<br />
people are likely to approve of. Therefore I'm not in the happy<br />
position of the Labour Party in Latrobe rhich I notice has already<br />
begun to say, not that , what we're doing about infl... tion is<br />
wrong though they iill, of course, in due course say it's<br />
rong but that what they would do about problems like the<br />
problem of inflation. What would they do? They would alter<br />
the Constitution in accordance with the terms of the recommendation<br />
of this Committee. I think that's rather nice. You might<br />
win a by-election with proposals of that kind, but you wouldn't<br />
win a referendum. ( Laughter) </p>
<p>And so, Ladies and Gentlemen, I just take the opportunity<br />
of reminding you of these things. Jo don't al:. ays think about<br />
thom but I am satisfied that the 10 years in which I've been<br />
able to be the head of the Commonwealth Government, 10 years of<br />
very great advance all over Australia, would not, on the political<br />
front have been possible if it hadn't been that I had a<br />
united band of people behind me and united people working as you<br />
work in the field. It is unity which has been our great strength<br />
and if we preserve that, spiritedly, frankly, never afraid to<br />
argue with each other though preferably in private but not<br />
afraid of differences, but always remembering that it's the great<br />
underlying unity that carrios this movement foriard and that<br />
carries Australia forward. And Ithink that somebody else I<br />
hope will be standing here in 10 years' time as a Liberal Prime<br />
Minister looking back on nother 10 years of successful service<br />
to the country.<br />
