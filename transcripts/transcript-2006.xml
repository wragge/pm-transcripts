MOORABBIN LIBERAL PARTY BRANCH DINNER<br />
TOWN HALL, MOORABBIN, VIC. V 28 ' FEBRUARY 1969<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, Mr John Gorton<br />
Mr Chairman, Mr Mayor, Mr Chipp, Distinguished Parliamentary<br />
Colleagues, both Federal and State, and Ladies and Gentlemen<br />
That is rather a hard introduction for me to live up to,<br />
though at the beginning of this speech I would like to say that as long as<br />
I am entrusted with the Prime Ministership of this country, I shall try to<br />
live up to it, and I know I will be supported in that by such Members of<br />
the Federal Parliament as your Member from Higinbotham in the past and<br />
from Hotham in the future Don Chipp.<br />
I came along tonight to have the opportunity to meet you.<br />
I came along to have the opportunity to talk to you, most of you being<br />
Liberals; the rest of you, undoubtedly, when you put your minds to it,<br />
are going to become Liberals:'<br />
I am touched and I think my wife is touched that so many<br />
of you have come along tonight to see us, to hear us and to meet us.<br />
Perhaps I should try to put before you some ideas of my own as to what<br />
government is all about.<br />
Every three years, one goes to the polls. Every three years<br />
the television stations have proponents for this side or for that, and the<br />
newspapers have people writing articles for this side or for that. The<br />
public meetings to which nobody goes have people standing on platforms,<br />
speaking for this side or for that, and occasionally when they do go to a<br />
public meeting which is usually when a Prime Minister is there people<br />
are trying to hit him on the head with a banner or to stop somebody hitting<br />
him on the head with a banner.<br />
This is just the outwa-rd show of what it is all about. What<br />
really are the basic reasons for government? What do you really want to<br />
get from the governments that you elect? What kind of advances do you<br />
expect? What kind of Australia do you have in your minds not only for<br />
yourselves, not mainly for yourselves, but for the children you have, and<br />
in some cases, odd as it may seem because everybody here looks so young<br />
the grandchildren you may have'?<br />
I suppose and I do not put these in any order of priority but<br />
just as they come to my mind that you would want to have in the nation of<br />
Australia, a government which would try to see that every employable<br />
person in Australia was employed, that there was no waste manpower,<br />
that there was no person with skills and integrity and capacity who had to<br />
sit at home and who was utnable to support his fa-mily because the economy<br />
could not offer him work to do to further the country in which he li ved. </p>
<p>-2<br />
I say this-with some feeling because I do remember when<br />
I was young-there was a time when there were many many people in<br />
Australia who were willing to work hard, who had the skills to contribute<br />
to the building of a nation, who had to sit at home because it was said<br />
" There is no chance to employ you because we haven't got enough money<br />
to do it. I think one of the basic things a nation wants is to ensure that<br />
every man who can contribute to the advance of that nation is given the<br />
opportunity to contribute to it, and is paid according to his merits,<br />
according to his capacity and according to his contribution.<br />
I believe you would want to see more than that, more than<br />
the mere chance of employment being offered. I believe that you would<br />
want to see and if you wouldn't, you ought to want to see that not<br />
merely employment but the opportunity for advancement according to<br />
the talents of an individual is provided in a nation such as this. And<br />
I do suggest that this has been done.<br />
I do suggest that in the period of time during which the<br />
Liberal Party has been in office and during which great leaders of the<br />
Liberal Party have led this country, leaders in whose steps I follow but<br />
whose stature I do not yet pretend to attain to during that period of<br />
time, people who are willing to work have had employment opportunities<br />
never offered before. They have had the opportunity to develop their<br />
talents and to move upwards in a way this nation had never offered<br />
previously. And this is one of the things that government is all about.<br />
But there are other new problems crowding in upon us,<br />
because we are in a way an adolescent nation. We are half-way between<br />
the nation that we were in 1939, a junior nation and certainly between<br />
1900 and 1939 a junior nation, a child, as it were, of the Mother<br />
Country and half-way between that and the mighty nation which we<br />
may be, if we properly judge, in fifty or one hundred years' time. In<br />
that sense we are, I say, adolescent between the child stage and<br />
between the world leader stage.<br />
One of the things that is going to decide how in 50,<br />
100 years' tine this turns out, is what we do now concerning the<br />
investment and the ownership and the control of the industries of<br />
Australia and the development of Australia.<br />
It is true that no developing nation such as ours can<br />
possibly attain, in the time in which it ought to attain, greatness unless<br />
there is from outside great capital investment. I look backc to the United<br />
States of America, which grew as quickly as it did only because of a<br />
great flow of investment from outside. I wonder what the situation of<br />
the United States of America would be now if those investments, which<br />
developed so greatly, had not had to be sold off by Great Britain in the<br />
First World War, and in the Second World War, in order to enable her<br />
to play a leading part in protecting the freedom of the world, If this<br />
had not happened, the investments that were made in that country in<br />
the 1880' s and the 1890' s and the 1900' s would have grown to what<br />
proportion now? How much of the proceeds of those investment, if<br />
they had not had to be sold off, would now be flowing to Great Britain? </p>
<p>3-<br />
I do not want to see indeed I will not see I do not want<br />
to think of seeing in 50 or 60 or 100 years' time too much of the<br />
proceeds of Australian raw materials, of Australian capacity, of<br />
Australian initiative, flowing out of this country instead of remaining<br />
in it. And yet, feeling that as deeply as I do, and kcnowing its<br />
importance as I do, I also know that if we are to grow as quickly as<br />
the world situation may require, if we are to bring into this country<br />
the flow of migrants, the record flow of migrants this year, in order to<br />
build our population as quickly as our future safety may require, then we<br />
must have from overseas this capital investment.<br />
So there is a balance, a steering of a course between<br />
Scylla and Charybdis on one side, an absolute necessity, if we are to<br />
grow as we must, for overseas capital investment on the other Bide<br />
a requirement to see to the utmost of our capacity that such overseas<br />
investment is married to an opportunity for Australian equity so that<br />
our children shall participate in the growth that overseas investment<br />
brings. This is another thing that government is all about. This is<br />
another thing that people like Don Chipp and myself and the others that<br />
you have elected are working at,. And before long, perhaps six weeks,<br />
perhaps eight weeks, perhaps ten weeks, but before long, I believe that<br />
we will have the chance to put before you a programme, a proposition<br />
which will steer this course between these two in a sense, opposed,<br />
desires. This is of the utmost importance for the future of this nation.<br />
What else is government about? Well one thing, of course,<br />
and this is, I think, the keystone and always has been of the Liberal<br />
Party, is that we should seek to see that those who are old or ill or<br />
aged or in some other way disadvantaged, or the victims of the slings<br />
and arrows of outrageous fortune, should be helped by those who are<br />
more affluent. I do not mean that those who are not prepared to work<br />
should be supported by those who are. I do not mean that there should<br />
not be a requirement for people to make effort in order to get some<br />
achievement or in order to be able to live and support their families.<br />
But I do mean that when there is some great misfortune that falls upon<br />
the people in our community, then the rest of the community should<br />
see that that misfortune is overcome, and that that man on whom<br />
misfortune falls, and his family, should be succoured by the rest of<br />
the community. I think that during the period we have been in government<br />
during the last twelve or fourteen months some considerable steps<br />
have been taken in this direction. And I am certain that in the months<br />
to come before the endi of the year, even greater steps will be made in<br />
this direction. I believe that in a year we will be able to make the steps<br />
./ 4 </p>
<p>-4<br />
which will show that-Poverty-which-is not poverty because of the fault of<br />
an individual, will be-able to be banished from our midst. Also that<br />
the fear of long illness, which-has already been removed by what we<br />
have done and therefore is no longer a significant. subject, but that the<br />
fear of the difficulty of family illness will be able to be removed from the<br />
Consciousness of Australians.<br />
These, with many other matters of this kind which I can't<br />
go into but education is one are what government is all about. But,<br />
basically, if these things are to develop in a nation, there is one other<br />
item which ought not to be a transcendant matter but which, in a way,<br />
I think is, to which government must direct its attention. That is<br />
defending the capacity to do those things of which I have in shorthand<br />
been speaking to you. Because it is of little use to have a policy on<br />
investment, and it is of little use to have a policy on trying to overcome<br />
illness and poverty, and it is of little use to have a policy to advance<br />
education or to make better roads unless one can be sure that in the<br />
years ahead the people of Australia will themselves be able to develop<br />
that policy freely and without some invading power telling them how to do<br />
it. And so, although it should not be significant, and so<br />
although it takes so much of ow production, yet if we are to be able,<br />
as independent people, to decide what we want to do in these other<br />
matters, then the capacity to defend our right to be able to do it without<br />
coercion is perhaps transcendant.<br />
He re we are a little isolated, because here, as I said the<br />
other night in the House, an era has ended. Great Britain has gone from<br />
our part of the world. The United States may not and I say no more<br />
than may not be as interested as she was. So we, and the closest<br />
countries to us in the region of Asia in which we live, must co-operate<br />
and we, as the greatest technological power in the region, as the most<br />
advanced industrial power in the region, must try to help the region<br />
economically. We must try to help it in the way of trade, and must be<br />
prepared to put into defence hardware, and into the manpower for<br />
defence services, more than any of us would want to put, were it not<br />
that we have to do it in order to retain the right of free choice as to<br />
how we are to run our country.<br />
Well, we in the Government have indicated how we pr~ opose<br />
to do this. We have indicated the means of co-operation with our<br />
neighbours. We have indicated that Australians, should there be<br />
difficulty in the regions to our North, should there be an incursion of<br />
communism there which may eventually threaten us, we have indicated<br />
that in that case Australians will be there. This is one of the things<br />
that government is all about.<br />
I grew up in a time, you know, when Hitler was rising to<br />
power in Europe, and in a time when there were many voices raised<br />
saying " Do not oppose this man. His ideas may be wrong. His racial<br />
desire to exterminate all Jews may be wrong. He may say he is going to </p>
<p>5<br />
conquer other countries, but that is just rodomontade for internal<br />
consumpt:. n. Do not let us worry about this. And so country after<br />
country fell under the control of a ruthless and authoritative power.<br />
This made, perhaps, some impression on me. Not the imminent, but<br />
the possible future threat, is in our part of the world. And as long as<br />
we are in government, we are going to do our best to see that this threat<br />
wil~ l be able to be resisted by Australians should it become imminent.<br />
These are some of the matters with which you are concerned<br />
and with which I am concerned. Others are to ensure that there is a<br />
chance for personal choice, that there is no direction as to what a man<br />
should or should not do or where he should or should not work or where<br />
he should or should not invest his savings.<br />
Last week: in the Parliament, quite clearly, there came out<br />
some basic significant difference between the Government, which I lead,<br />
and the Opposition which seeks to become the Government. Because<br />
there is black and white was spelt out what in 1949 so many of us came in<br />
to fight against. There it was stated by the Opposition should we<br />
become a government, we will tell insurance companies, which are the<br />
depositaries of the savings of the people; we will tell banks which are<br />
the depositaries of the savings of the people, where they must and where<br />
they must not invest those savings. And if they wish to invest them<br />
in some development which will bring them in 6 per cent, and we, a<br />
Labor Government, think they should invest them in somL-thing else which<br />
will bring them in 2 per cent, then we will make them invest where<br />
we want them to invest.<br />
We do not say that. We say there must be a personal<br />
choice by a man as to the job he will take, and a personal choice by the<br />
man as to the investments he will make, and a personal choice by<br />
companies as to where they will invest for the benefit of the shareholders<br />
in those companies. This perhaps has more significance for the<br />
development of a country than may at first appear.<br />
I suppose in a way it is unusual it must be unusual that<br />
one party which has been in government in this country for the last<br />
twenty years, which is about a third of the time that Australia has been<br />
a nation. It started in 1901. It is now 1969 all right 70 years. For<br />
the last 20 years out of 70, one government has been running this<br />
country. I doubt if this could be matched in any other country in the<br />
world. One would have thought that in this period of time, tiredness<br />
would have crept in, that there would have been a clinging to shibboleths<br />
of the past, that something new would not have been developed by a<br />
party which had been so long in power. This isn't so.<br />
We are looking now to examine and we have been<br />
publicly examining the sacred cows which since 1901 have for so<br />
long been unquestioned. Dare I mention things like Commonwealth/ 6 </p>
<p>6-<br />
State relations, for-example,-and a number of other less controversial<br />
subject$, all of which need to be looked at, and about none of which I<br />
propose to enter into controversial discussion tonight.<br />
This is not an indication of decadence; surely this is an<br />
indication of a new approach. And may I suggest to you that it being<br />
true that for 20 out of 70 years there has been this kind of government<br />
in Australia, that the proof of the pudding is in the eating. Look at<br />
what has happened in those 20 years. Look at the development that has<br />
taken place. Look at the increase in population that has taken place.<br />
Look at the increase in employment that has taken place. Look at the<br />
future that has opened up for this nation in that period of time, If the<br />
proof of the pudding is in the eating, then the pudding that has been baked<br />
in the last 20 years is good for the nation, and if it is good for this nation,<br />
it is good for the world.<br />
Sir, I have only one other thing to say, because I have been<br />
speaking to a great degree, of the past. We really haven't started yet.<br />
We are 12 million people now. We will be 28 million people by the turn<br />
of the century, some 31 years, and that in the life of a nation is just the<br />
blinki~ ng of an eye. ( Tape changeover brief section missing)<br />
These are the goals which are attainable before us. On<br />
the progress which has been made towards them, on your judgment of<br />
the progress which has been made, I believe that the philosophy which<br />
has made possible that progress is the philosophy which will make possible<br />
the attainment of those goals. That will be done, but it will only be done<br />
if the people of Australia, of whom you are a cross section, agree with<br />
us that the ways in which we seek to attain these goals are the right ways,<br />
and believe that we are genuine in seeking to attain them. If you did not<br />
believe both these things, I do not think that you would be here tonight.<br />
The fact that you are here tonight is of immense encouragement to me,<br />
to Don Chipp and to those who stand with me.<br />
I thank you for coming. We draw encouragement from your<br />
coming, and I believe that the work which so many of you do will be to<br />
the great benefit of this rising nation of the world. </p>
