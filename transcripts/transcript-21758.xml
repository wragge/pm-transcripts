    <content><![CDATA[<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p> Prime Minister, any news on Douglas Wood as far as far as the Government is aware this evening?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> No I can't report anything different from what I did this morning, we don't have any further information, the comments attributed to Sheikh Hilaly were apparently on his part based on an anonymous phone call, we all hope there might be something in it but I do want to caution against the raising in an unreal way of expectations on occasions in situations like this that does occur and not because anybody's, I am not suggesting the Sheikh's doing that, I am just making the observation that people look for good news and we've got to be very careful that we don't raise expectations unduly.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p> And any news on the gentleman in Kuwait?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Well that matter is being pursued, we are more hopeful of getting access, we have been trying I have am told we made sixteen requests at a Consular level to get access. Thank you.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p> Sorry just quickly are you keen to see the Liberals in Queensland, this is a big night for them?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> It's always a good night for the Liberal Party in Queensland, look at how many seats we won at the last Federal election.</p>
