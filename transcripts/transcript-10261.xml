PRIME MINISTER<br />
7 March 1997 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
DOORSTOP SYDNEY<br />
E&amp; OE<br />
JOURNALIST: What are your thoughts on the Grand Prix this weekend... ( inaudible).. . how will it<br />
backfire? PRIM MINSTER:.<br />
It's a long time since I've seen anything as stupid, as bloody minded, as anti-Australian<br />
as what the union is doing in Victoria. Any pretence that this is other than an attempt<br />
to sabotage the Grand Prix is completely without any merit or without any substance.<br />
This piece of stupidity will backfire on the whole trade union movement. I'd like to<br />
know what Mr Brniby and Mr Beazley think of what the union is doing. Australians<br />
will see it as an attempt to sabotage a great Australian sporting event. And when you<br />
try and sabotage the great Australian sporting events, you incur quite properly the<br />
wrath of the Australian people no matter what the event is, and even amongst people<br />
who don't follow car racing it will be seen as an attempt to stab a great Australian<br />
event in the back in which it plainly is.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( Inaudible).. . great Australian event stolen from another Capital city?<br />
PRIME MNITER:-<br />
Look, I'm tbe Prime Minister of Australia, as far as I'm concerned when something<br />
comes to Australia, I'm happy. I1d on't care whether it's in Sydney or Melbourne or<br />
Adelaide or Perth, I'm not a city specific Prime Minister, I'm an Australian specific<br />
Prime Minister. FarxoM 07/ 03/ 97 15: 04 Pg: 1 </p>

JOURNALIST: ( Inaudible) potential to damage Australia internationally?<br />
PRIE MINISTER:<br />
I think it sends a terrible message. Particularly given that we'll be hosting the Olympic<br />
Games in four years' time, I think it's a terrible message to send overseas. I mean<br />
they're just so out of touch with contemporary Australian opinion. I would imagine<br />
that decent trade unionists in Australia would absolutely cringe at this tawdry little<br />
exercise. JOURNALIST: Mr Howard, just on another matter can you give any guarantee there won't be cuts to<br />
Medicare or pharmaceutical benefits in the Budget?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, I can give a guarantee that the decisions we take in the budget won't unfairly<br />
treat any section of the Australian community. I'm not going to respond to a whole lot<br />
oft a whole lot of individual items of speculation. You always get options, you always<br />
get speculation in the lead up to a budget. Most of it turns out to be completely<br />
unfounded. I give a general guarantee that we'll take care to protect and defend the<br />
safety net and that the decisions we take will be fair and balanced and just. And<br />
beyond that I'm just simply not going to rule individual things in or out. But I just<br />
issue the general sort of caution or admonition that in the past we've had a lot of these<br />
shock horror stories and in the reality you've had very sensible and balanced results.<br />
And I don't expect this budget to be any different and it won't be any different.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you believe inaudible billion out of health?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I don't answer hypothetical questions.<br />
JOURNALIST: The NSW Government says it needs another $ 240 million... to keep the hospitals<br />
running how do you feel about that?<br />
PRIME MIINISTER:<br />
Well there's a Premiers' Conference in what, two or three weeks time, and therefore<br />
this is the season for shadow boxing before the Premiers' Conference. I predict that<br />
this years' Premiers' Conference will be quite a positive event. And I'd predict that<br />
between now and then there'll be a little bit of positioning from all Premiers. I<br />

r understand that. They understand that. But at the end of the day the public hospital<br />
system of New South Wales is the responsibility of the New South Wales Government.<br />
I mean, there's no way that Bob Carr and Andrew Refshauge can shift responsibility<br />
for problems in the New South Wales health system on to us, Can I just say on this<br />
that if five or six years ago the Federal Labor Government had done something about<br />
encouraging people to stay in private health insurance then you wouldn't now have the<br />
same pressure on public hospitals in New South Wales or indeed in other parts of<br />
Australia. Graham Richardson warned this, other observers warned it, wvarned about<br />
it, but the former Labor Government did nothing and now, very belatedly, Mr Carr<br />
says that it's a big problem, that people are falling out of private health insurance.<br />
Well, why hadn't he done something about it some years ago? We've inherited that<br />
problem. We're doing something on the 1st of July. We're putting almost $ 500<br />
million into the pockets of Australian families to encourage them to stay in private<br />
health insurance. Now, that is a massive injection of money into the system from the<br />
Federal Government which in time will take some pressure off the State hospital<br />
systemn. And it's a bit rich that Mr Carr and Dr Refshauge can now turn around and<br />
say to us we want another $ 200 million. I mean, their mates allowed the private health<br />
system to bleed to death when they were in power. They should have been saying<br />
something to Keating and Beazley and Lawrence some years ago.<br />
JOURNALIST: On the ' work for the dole' scheme have any reports come back to you?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yes, we'll be taking that committee report at the Cabinet meeting in Pakenham in<br />
Victoria next Tuesday and I'll have something to say after that Cabinet meeting<br />
regarding further details of the ' work for the dole' proposal. But it has been very well<br />
advanced. The taskforce under the chairmanship of Dr Kemp is met very regularly and<br />
it will have a very detailed report for the Cabinet. And after the Cabinet meeting I'll<br />
have something in more detail to say about the ' work for the dole' proposal.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( Inaudible)<br />
PRIME MIISTER:<br />
We won't be breaking our election commitments in the health area.<br />
Thank you. Fa rom07/ 03/ 97 15: 84 PS: 3 </p>
