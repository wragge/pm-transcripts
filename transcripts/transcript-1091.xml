OPENING OF CHANNEL 10 TELEVISI. ON STATION<br />
SYDNEY, N. S. W. -th APRIL3 1265<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon, Sir Robert Menzies.<br />
It gives me quite a lot of pleasure to be associated with the<br />
opening of your new Station. That is partly because your<br />
Chairman and some of your Directors are very old friends of<br />
mine, and their individuality guarantees that this will be a<br />
highly, well-conducted Station.<br />
There are other reasons, of course, for my pleasure. One is<br />
that I think it is a very good thing for the future of television<br />
that we should have as wide a choice as possible in the programmes<br />
that we want to look at. I do not mean by that that there ought<br />
to be so many that they cease to be effective, but I do mean that<br />
a choice, the possibility of turning that knob and getting on to<br />
another station is of tremendous importance.<br />
I do not look at television as much as perhaps most people,<br />
but I always have a very attractive sense of power when a<br />
programme is on and I do not like it and I can Just turn the<br />
kpneoobp lea ndfe egle t druirdin go fa nit , elecItt iomna kceas mmpea iugnn dwerhsetna nthde ye xcaacntl yd o hothwe<br />
same kind service by me.<br />
Choice is I think, in the long run, the guarpntee of quality<br />
because if people are exercising their judgment in that vay,<br />
this will soon become known and standards I think will tend to<br />
be maintained and improved.<br />
There is another thing about television which makes it fascinating<br />
and, 1 thihk, sometimes almost terrifying. It appeals to the<br />
eye as well as to the ear. People look at the performer,<br />
whether he is a speaker or an actor, or whatever he may be, and<br />
thay listen to him. They have an opportunity of forming a<br />
judgment in two senses, which cannot be made merely by listening<br />
to a voice over the air. I think indeed, that although your<br />
prime function will be to entertain your vievers to instruct<br />
your viewers in a m: W and insinuating way, you will occasionally<br />
have on your station political people, men of affairs,<br />
university professors, all sorts of people who have something<br />
to say which may be contentious, and I think it is tremendously<br />
valuable that people should be able to look as well as hear.<br />
It gives them an opportunity of forming a judgment, so to speak,<br />
in the round.<br />
I think television is going to have a tremendous effect in<br />
the future. Indeed, I sometimes tremble to think of what will<br />
happen in due course when the premiums will be put on television<br />
personalities and nobody will be nominated for a seat in<br />
Parliament unless he is a clean winner on the screen. Well,<br />
sometimes that might be good and frequently it might not, but<br />
with experience people will cultivate an additional judonent<br />
through the medium of television. / 2 </p>

Tihredore, I think you are entering upon an<br />
adventure. It is a financial adventure of course, though<br />
I have no doubt it will succeed, an adventure into a new<br />
t. orld of entertainment and instruction, a newr world which<br />
I believe is Zing. to be more and more signifcant as the<br />
years go by.<br />
I eomplixiient this Company on tio quality of those<br />
who direct it l am, perfectly certain that under their<br />
guidance this Station will have great success, and I<br />
certainly wish it all the luck in the world*<br />
