P. M. No._ 24/ 1960<br />
AUSTRALIAN MEDICAL TEAM FOR CONGO<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister the Rt. Hon. R. G. Menzies,<br />
The Prime Minister announced today that the<br />
Government had agreed to make U5', 000 available to the<br />
Australian Red Cross Society to help to send an Australian<br />
medical team to the Congo.<br />
Mr. Menzies said that the decision had been made by<br />
Cabinet yesterday within 24 hours of a request from the League<br />
of Red Cross Societies in Geneva and the World Health<br />
Organization for medical assistance for the Congo. The<br />
Australian team would probably consist of two doctors and a<br />
male nurse and its task was expected to be to assist in the<br />
rehabilitation of Congolese hospitals and medical services<br />
which wore short of staff following the withdrawal of the Belgian<br />
administration. Mr. Menzies said he hoped that the Australian medical<br />
team, which would serve in the Congo for some six months,<br />
would be ready to leave Australia within a few days.<br />
CANBERRA, 3rd August, 1960. </p>
