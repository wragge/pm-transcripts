TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISITER, THE HON PJ KEATING, MP<br />
DOORSTOP, OUR LADY OF LEBANON SCHOOL, SYDNEY<br />
4 SEPTEMBER 1992<br />
E OE PROOF COPY<br />
PM: I'll just say a couple of things to you, yesterday Dr Hewson said the people<br />
of Australia were lazy. In the nine years that I was Treasurer of this country<br />
trying to induce structural change and work place reform and what have<br />
you, never ever was thc willingness of Australians to work cvcr callcd into<br />
question, that never came to my mind that there was any sense of lack of<br />
national energy. I think Dr Hewson owes the public of Australia an apology<br />
for a smear that goes across the work force and the business community<br />
alike that people arc lazy. Australians can do anything that aity other nation<br />
can do, as thcy've proved, and I think the great strides of the 1980s and early<br />
arc evidence of that, and his vicw that he should offend cvcry group in<br />
the community and now thc community at largc by branding them lazy is I<br />
think, unbccoming of him and he owes all of us, and particularly the<br />
working mcn and women of this country, an apology.<br />
J: Do we have to work harder though as a nation?<br />
PM: We've got to organisc our investment and our products as we arc now,<br />
towards the world markets, doing sensible and clever things and what you're<br />
seeing here today, that is a secondary school, greater participation for kids,<br />
young men, young women, these are thc things which will carry us along.<br />
J: Mr Keating on -wheat, do you believe we do need as Dr lIewson suggests to<br />
up the ante with the United Statcs? </p>
<p>TEL: 4. ep. 9 141 O-02.02/<br />

PM:. We've made clear our position to the United States administration and we<br />
are now going to subject the administration to the rigours of the GATT.<br />
process, but the notion that abuse or upping the ante so to speak can play<br />
any sensible role is of course a nonsense. And not only that, Dr Hewson is<br />
already attacking Japan which is our largest trading partner where we have a<br />
huge trade surplus and where the trade story to Japan has been one of great<br />
success for Australia. So a little bit of modcration in thought and language<br />
would help.<br />
J: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: Wheat and aqricultural trade has been a matter which we've been arguing<br />
about now for most of thc ' 80s. I succeeded in getting agriculture onto the<br />
GATT agenda in 1986 and it's still being debated, it's coming to the end of<br />
the round and that's what will matter most; knocking out subsidies<br />
worldwide rather than responding to any one particular increase in<br />
subsidies.<br />
J: Is this catastrophic for our wheat farmers sales?<br />
PM: We need to analyse it and see what markets they arc likely to be moving<br />
into and how that will affect us.<br />
J: Mr Keating, are you or the Labor Party embarrassed about the slanging<br />
match between Whitlam and Hawke?<br />
PM: I've got nothing to say about that, I was asked about that this morning.<br />
J; are you embarrasscd?<br />
PM: We're all grown people in this country, we can all say what we wish.<br />
J: Just getting back to wheat, are you personally disappointed that Mr Bush<br />
has done this and do you fear that he may have other surprises up his sleeve<br />
in this clection year?<br />
PM: I doubt it, but I can understand where it's come from. He was in the mid-<br />
West in the wheat belt and he's made this what he thinks is a gesture. I think<br />
that the best result here is for the United States to push through a conclusion<br />
of the GATT round with the Europeans on agriculture and we see these<br />
subsidies diminish. But I notice Dr Hewson talking about the alliance, I<br />
don't know whether he thinks we should be dragging defence issues into </p>
<p>ILL: 3<br />
this, I think it would be most unfortunate if that were his view. Earlier this<br />
year I was in Lae and some of those places in Papua New Guinca where<br />
American families left thousands of their boys behind dead on those<br />
beaches and all Australians should consider this when we try to link the<br />
defence relationship into trade matters. rHwon is very intemperate<br />
these days as his remarks on Japan show, as his claim that Australians are<br />
lazy shows, as hc's attacked renters, teachers, nurses just about every group<br />
in the community and I think a little bit of restraint on his part wouldn't so<br />
astray.<br />
J: Are you expecting any improvement in the unemployment figures next<br />
week?<br />
PM: Wait and see next week. Thank you.<br />
