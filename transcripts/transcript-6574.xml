PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA20 January 1985<br />
The New South Wales Premier's decisive action to get the<br />
state rail system working again has the full backing of the<br />
Federal Government.<br />
The damage done to our export markets and to Australia' s<br />
reputation as a reliable supplier as a result of the prolonged<br />
industrial action in New South Wales could not have been<br />
allowed to continue<br />
The Federal Government supports Mr Wran's moves to ensure<br />
that our standing as a reliable supplier is not ' further<br />
jeopardised. </p>
