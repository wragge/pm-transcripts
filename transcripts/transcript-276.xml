P. M. No. 8/ 1961<br />
ECONOMIC POLICY<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon. R. G. Menzies<br />
We have been closely examining, in Cabinet and<br />
Committee, the effects, so far, of our Economic policy<br />
measures. We have also given much attention to the drive for<br />
exports, some general aspects of which I announced at the<br />
beginning of January.<br />
We see no reason to alter the substance of our<br />
policy which we knew would be, in the short run, unpopular<br />
with many people but which we believed, and believe, is in the<br />
best interests of the nation. Credit was too easy, and an<br />
inflationary boom was under way. Credit therefore had to be<br />
restricted so that stability might be restored. The effects<br />
of the boom included an increased demand for imports, while<br />
our export income, so dependent on primary products, remained<br />
somewhat depressed. This, I should point out, is not because<br />
primary production has fallen; on the contrary, it has<br />
increased. But the " terms of trade" have moved against<br />
Australia very significantly since 1953. By that I mean that<br />
the prices of imports, as contrasted with the prices of<br />
experts, have not fallen, so that the imports we can buy for a<br />
given quantity of exports have been reduced. If our terms of<br />
trade are taken as an index figure of 100 in 1953, ( itself a<br />
relatively normal year) the figure today is 65. This, which<br />
is beyond our control, since we cannot fix the price paid by<br />
the world for our exports, is at the root of our present<br />
problem. The terms of trade have moved against us more than<br />
against almost any other country in the world. In the<br />
result, our overseas roserves, vital to our activities as a<br />
great international trading nation were ( and are) falling at<br />
too rapid a rate. WIe have been living beyond our means<br />
internationally, with the result that reserves are being drawn<br />
upon to meet current business payments. This is not good<br />
business, as every business man knows.<br />
Another element was the increasing resort to high<br />
interest borrowing outside the banking system, for hire<br />
purchase and ether financial transactions. This growth<br />
( which has mushroomed in the last year or two) had two<br />
undesirable by-products.<br />
First, it increased the burden on the taxpayers,<br />
because these high interest payments were treated as business<br />
expenses; which meant that up to 40G% of the interest was<br />
being met by the Treasury, i. e. by other taxpayers.<br />
Second, it attracted m--oney away from Savings Banks<br />
and public loans by outbidding in interest rates. This has<br />
meant that we have not been able to got from the loan market<br />
all the funds vitally necessary for national development in<br />
power, water supply, transport, scliools, housing, and the<br />
like, with resultant burdens upon taxpayers ( who are, broadly,<br />
the adult population of Australial In this current financial<br />
year, no less than 65% ef the cost of capital works, both<br />
Federal and State, is being met cut of Commonwealth taxation<br />
revenue!~ We tackled this matter by some variations in bank<br />
interest rates, and by measures to prevent these high outside<br />
interest payments from being fully deductible for Income Tax<br />
purposes, We know that there has been much criticism of, and<br />
some uncertainty about, our particular measures. At an early </p>
<p>2.<br />
date we will resolve this uncertainty by substituting for what<br />
we announced as a toemporary and somewhat arbitrary measure,<br />
new law on deductibility. I have reasoin to believe that the<br />
new proposals, which the Treasurer will announce in~ due course,<br />
will go a long way towards meeting reasonable and constructive<br />
criticism, while not conflicting with the Government's policy.<br />
objectives. In order to assist the loan raising which<br />
governments must have if the nation is to grow, and if'private<br />
enterprise is to have proper foundations on which to build, we<br />
announced policies in relation to Life Assurance Societies,<br />
Superannuation funds, and the like, ( which enjoy great taxation<br />
benefits), requiring them to subscribe to Governrment and semi-<br />
Government Loans 30% of their funds. Since our announcement<br />
useful discussions have occurred and certain modifications 01<br />
our proposal have been worked out. These will be announced by<br />
the Treasurer. They will, I believe, be widely acceptable.<br />
In all these and allied matters, it is necessary to<br />
make it clear that while we have adopted policies of some<br />
severity, we are maintaining a close watch upon results,<br />
particularly in the field of employment. That there should be<br />
some falling off in employment in the meter car industry, a<br />
falling off from a very high peak in 1960, is inevitable; for<br />
one of our designs was to reduce inflationary pressure in that<br />
section. This must involve some changes in employment, but is<br />
not designed, over all, to produce unem-ploymient, which it will<br />
be our constant care to resist.<br />
To sum up on tiiese matters, we are conscious of the<br />
harm that can be done by the existence of uncertainties in the<br />
business world in relation to deductibility of interest and the<br />
investment policies of life assurance and superannuation<br />
schemes. These uncertainties will be resolved by the Treasurers<br />
statements which I have foreshadowed.<br />
There are four other matters of considerable<br />
importance to which I will now refer.<br />
1. The impact of crodit restrictions upon the miotor and<br />
allied industries, and the financial bodies associated with<br />
them, is already considerable. We 0 imposed additional Sales<br />
Tax on motor vehicles as a supplementary mecans of securing an<br />
effect which would help to reduce the run down in our overseas<br />
funds. Close examination has satisfied us that the present<br />
psychological effect of an increased sales tax which many<br />
possible buyers believe not likely to endure beyond the next<br />
Budget is a bad one. It serves to induce a postponemient of<br />
demand which aggravates the effect of credit measures and<br />
therefore tends to hit the miotor industry more than we would<br />
desire. We are satisfied, on the evidence, that our other<br />
measures will achieve nationally satisfactory results. Wie did<br />
not impose the extra sales tax for revenue purposes, but as a<br />
deterrent. As our own judgaent satisfied us that this added<br />
deterrent is now unnecessary and probably producos undesirable<br />
results, we have decided to repeal the added sales tax,<br />
effective as of the comimencement of business tomorrow 22nd<br />
February. Aiiending leg-islation will be submitted to parliament<br />
at the first opportunity after Parliament resumes, to reduce<br />
the Sales Tax on motor vehicles to the rates payable prior to<br />
the increases announced on 15th November, 1960.<br />
2. There is a good deal of speculation about a possible<br />
re-introduction of import licensing, and some speculation<br />
about a devaluation by changing the exchange rate.<br />
It is therefore necessary to state that we have no </p>
<p>intention whatever to restore the import licensing which was<br />
abandoned, or to alter the exchange rate.<br />
3. We have been working on practical measures to increase<br />
our export income. This is especially important in the field of<br />
exports of manufactured goods. We have had the great advantage<br />
of consultation with representative business men on the<br />
irfiensely difficult question of tax incentives. We arc to<br />
receive from them, in a few days, further material which will<br />
assist us to make decisions.<br />
We have also devised specific proposals for<br />
increasing our overseas sales by new promotional means,<br />
particularly in the Middle East and South America, in which<br />
areas we see very worthwhile opportunities. Our proposals<br />
relate to Trade Commissioner services, sales campaigns, and<br />
adequate shipping arrangements. They will be stated in detail<br />
by my colleague, theMinister for Trade. We have expectations of<br />
solid success. The promotion of the tourist trade is also essential,<br />
and holds promise of increased earnings from overseas. In<br />
January we made increased grants to the Australian National<br />
Travel Association, and asked it to submit a programme designed<br />
to ensure that tourist earnings are expanded as quickly as<br />
possible. The Association estimates that Australia earned<br />
Å“ l2 m. in overseas exchange from this source in 1959, and that<br />
substantial increase is possible by 1963.<br />
The financial measures to be adopted by us will be<br />
decided when the recorendations of the A. N. T. A. are received<br />
and considered.<br />
4. Our economic measures were not lightly adopted, and<br />
must, in their substance, be maintained until an adequate<br />
impact is made upon the twin problems of internal inflation and<br />
an excessive drain upon our overseas funds. This clearly<br />
involves the conclusion that we cannot, during 1961, provide<br />
large additional amounts from the Commonwealth Treasury, i. e.<br />
out of tax revenues, for public works additional to the great<br />
works now in progress. ut this does not mean that, in a period<br />
when we are aiming at a rustoration of stability, we are losing<br />
sight of the continuing need for further national development.<br />
As the history of the unhalting national progress ofhe list<br />
years has shown, national growth and development are our<br />
grand objective. We hope, therefore, that 1962, will see<br />
further steps forward. We have had under particular and<br />
sympathetic consideration such large enterprises as<br />
Road development in the North, including North and West<br />
Queensland, the Northern Territory, and the North of<br />
Western Australia.<br />
Improved port and loading facilities for the development<br />
of the Coal Export trade.<br />
Standard Railway gauge work from Broken Hill to Port<br />
Pirie including a modified interim proposal recently<br />
advanced by South Australia for diesel locomotion as a<br />
first step.<br />
The Western Australian Scheme for Railway gauge work in<br />
aid of the establishment in collaboration with the B. H. P.<br />
of an iron and stol industry in that State.<br />
Ways and means of further stimulating the search for oil,<br />
and riinerals oenorally. </p>
<p>I 4.<br />
There are other productive schemes; but those I have<br />
mentioned are at present prominent in our minds. The carrying<br />
out of any one of them, in most cases by the State concerned,<br />
will require consultation and co-operation by us with State<br />
Governnents and, where necessary, the devising of financial<br />
arrangements fair to both parties.<br />
So that, when circumstances permit, there may be no<br />
avoidable delay, we now say that w _ re prepared to do what we<br />
can to facilitate prompt detailed planning of the works I have<br />
feicated, so that rture performance can be assisted. To this<br />
end we wil put ourselves into touch with the relevant State<br />
Governments at an early date.<br />
CANBERRA, 21st February, 1961. </p>
