    <content><![CDATA[<p>Singapore President, HE Mr Sellapan Rama Nathan, will visit Australia from 13-18 March 2005.</p>
<p> President Nathan will be the first Singapore Head of State to visit Australia. His visit, which follows my official visit to Singapore last month, will contribute to a further strengthening of bilateral ties between Australia and Singapore.</p>
<p>President Nathan's visit will reciprocate that of the Governor-General, HE Major General Michael Jeffery, in March 2004, which was his first state visit overseas.</p>
<p>  Australia's bilateral relationship with Singapore is one of our closest and most comprehensive in South-east Asia.  This is based on long-standing political, defence, educational, trade, tourism, aviation and Commonwealth links as well as a shared strategic outlook.</p>
<p>  Singapore is Australia's largest trade and investment partner in ASEAN, and our eighth largest trading partner overall.  In 2004, Australian exports to Singapore were $3.3 billion and our imports from Singapore were $6.2 billion.  Services are a key part of our exports to Singapore, particularly education services and tourism.</p>
<p>Singapore's investment in Australia is substantial, recorded at $22.1 billion in 2003, making Singapore the fifth largest foreign investor in Australia.  The entry into force of the Singapore Australia Free Trade Agreement in July 2003 has contributed towards further integration between our two economies.</p>
<p>  While in Australia, President Nathan will visit Canberra, Hobart and Perth.</p>
<p>In addition to our meeting, President Nathan will meet several Cabinet colleagues. He will also attend a state banquet hosted by the Governor-General and a wreath-laying ceremony at the Australian War Memorial.</p>
<p> In Hobart and Perth, he will meet the Governor of Tasmania, HE the Hon William Cox AC, and the Governor of Western Australia, HE Lieutenant-General John Sanderson AC.  </p>
