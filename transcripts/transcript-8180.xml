PRIM MTAIAISTETRANSCRIPT<br />
OF' INTERVIEW WITH HOWARD SATTLER, RADIO 6PR<br />
1 NOVEMBER 19,90<br />
E AND 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
SATTLERs Prime Minister and husband of concert pianist<br />
Hazel, good morning Prime Minister.<br />
PM: very much second fiddle on that one Howard.<br />
SATTLERt I asked one of your fellows over there what<br />
instrument you played, but all he could come up with was a<br />
nine iron.<br />
PM: Was a what?<br />
SATTLER: A nine iron.<br />
PMt Yes, whatever instrument is necessary on the golf course<br />
but she was tremendous last night Howard, I was very very<br />
proud of her.<br />
BATTLER. was she nervous?<br />
PM: Well I went in to see her beforehand backstage and she<br />
seemed very very composed to me but I think once she got in<br />
onto the stage and was waiting f or it to start I detected a<br />
little bit of nervousness but once it got under way she was<br />
perfect. SATTLER: So what's the future, is she going to keep it up?<br />
PM. well r don't know that she would be willing to fill in<br />
regularly but her absolute passion is for helping young<br />
musicians and she is patron of the young symphony orchestra<br />
and I think she would be prepared to do anything which would<br />
help them. </p>
<p>SATTLER: Alright, veil let's get down to the business you<br />
have been involved in in the past couple of days in fact the<br />
business of -the last eight years in office. What prompted<br />
you to now talke action on the States funding and departmental<br />
duplication? PM: well after we won the last election I was thinking<br />
seriously about this question of how this country is governed<br />
and what I could do to try and make it. better and so I made<br />
this major speech at the Press Club here in July in which I<br />
said that I ' wanted to call the premiere together and in a<br />
true spirit of cooperation see how we could make the federal<br />
system work be~ tter. I mean this federal system that we have<br />
got is not the sort of thing that you would have if you were<br />
working out an arrangement now as you were coming into the<br />
21st century but it's the one we have got and therefore<br />
intelligence suggests that you should try and make it work<br />
better so I knew the things that worried the States about the<br />
vision of taxing powers and what's called the fiscal<br />
imbalance which simply means the difference between the<br />
amount of money you raise and the amount of money you upend.<br />
I knew their concerns there I knew also that my ordinary<br />
fellow Australians were concerned that there was duplication<br />
of activities between the Commonwealth and the States and<br />
that we didn't. have a national road and rail system that was<br />
working effectively so that they would get their goods and<br />
services delivered in the most efficient way. So I said to<br />
the States well come on I am dinkcwn about this I am prepared<br />
to look at things and say if there are things that we are<br />
doing that you may better be able to do or if the things we<br />
can help in tha financial relationships well I am prepared to<br />
look at that, and to their great credit all the States went<br />
across the political boundaries. It was the Labor premier.<br />
and also Nick Greiner in New South Wales they said alright<br />
Prime Minister we recognise that you are dinkum we will<br />
cooperate and t: he result we have got truly a historic outcome<br />
yesterday which I think will change the face of Australia for<br />
ordinary Australians over the coming years.<br />
SATTLER: But is it going to mean Canberra relinquishing any<br />
of it's taxing powers and if so which ones?<br />
PM: Well what we have said is that we are prepared to look<br />
at that. The premiers were saying well this is a very<br />
complex issue# what they wanted was an expert working group<br />
set up from us and from them which would go into all the<br />
ramifications because they understand that it's not an easy<br />
thing just to eay we will take that tax power or you give up<br />
that one. What they wanted us to do was to agree to a group<br />
of experts that: they would put up and we would put up f rom<br />
our treasuries and to see what could be done and I agreed to<br />
that and I agreed to it on the basis of aiming to reduce the<br />
imbalance that exists between us and that's precisely what<br />
they wanted and that's what I have given them. </p>
<p>SATTLER i Yesu but how does Paul Keating f eel about that. I<br />
have to tell you on television last night they showed a f ew<br />
cut aways and if those expressions were a ref lection of the<br />
way he felt he didn't seem to pleased with some of what warn<br />
being said.<br />
PM: I have discussed theme things with Paul and Paul goes<br />
along with then decisions that have been taken.<br />
SATTLERt He agrees that the Commonwealth should perhaps give<br />
up some taxing powers?<br />
PM No, what he agrees with is that this matter should be<br />
examined and that'. all that the States have asked for but<br />
not just well we will look at it but we will look at it with<br />
a view to trying to reduce this imbalance if that's possible.<br />
But they, the States have accepted# all of them that in this<br />
review we have got to take account of the necessity for the<br />
Commonwealth to retain the capacity to manage and regulate<br />
the economy. They accept that so that puts some degree of<br />
constraint upon what may be possible but the important thing<br />
is that I have said well we will go into to this in a dinku<br />
fashion. That is we know what your concerns are and we are<br />
going to try and redress that imbalance to the extent that<br />
it's possible while retaining the capacity for economic<br />
management that the national government, whoever is in power<br />
must have and they accept that.<br />
BATTLER: What do you think about these annual premiers<br />
conferences where the envelope is literally pushed under the<br />
door with the Commonwealth's first offer.<br />
PM I have changed that I mean this is one of the things<br />
that have coate out of the conference and they were very<br />
positive in their response about the changes. The element of<br />
the changes were these that we will undertake that there will<br />
be meetings in the months leading up to the premiers<br />
conference theire will be meetings between the Commonwealth<br />
and State at the treasury level and they will provide us with<br />
information months in advance. We will do the same thing and<br />
actually in February of each year there will be a meeting at<br />
the head of treasury level and another meeting three to four<br />
weeks before the annual conference so that the interchange of<br />
information will be in a much more structured way and then I<br />
have undertaken that they will get our documents two days<br />
before the conference so it's not shoved under their door on<br />
the early hours of the morning that we meet they will get it<br />
two days beforG.<br />
SATTLERt It's not the sort of thing you want to talk over<br />
breakfast is it?<br />
PM No it was inelegant and I think degrading a bit for the<br />
premiers the way it was conducted. I recognise that and we<br />
have changed it. </p>
<p>SATTLERs Nov do you now say that you trust governments like<br />
the Victorian and West Australian governments to handle money<br />
they way they want because as we all kcnow they have been<br />
rather irresponsible in some of their forays into private<br />
busniness in recent years.<br />
PM They have certainly had troubles both of them in their<br />
interventions into the private sector area. But in regard to<br />
the actual conduct of government expenditures and the<br />
discharge of their traditional obligations I think they have<br />
been responsibile but they certainly have burnt their fingers<br />
by going outside their normal area of operation.<br />
SATTLERt And promised not to do that any more have they?<br />
PM: Well that'. not what we have been about, we have been<br />
about the question of the actual relations between the<br />
Commonwealth antd States. I mean this is not an exercise in<br />
telling each state government how they conduct themselves<br />
that's a matter for state government.<br />
BATTLERs Which areas of federal state departmental<br />
duplication do you see being eliminated can I nominate a few.<br />
Can I nominate say health, education, transport, community<br />
services?<br />
PM: Well they are all in the area that are going to be<br />
examined we are not only waiting for examination but will<br />
indeed, agreed at this conference that for instance the area<br />
of disability service., there is so many of our fellow<br />
Australians who suffer from disabilities and that's been an<br />
area of very considerable duplication. So we have already<br />
made the decision now that the States will accept<br />
responsibility in the area of accommodation services that are<br />
provided for the disabled and the Commonwealth will accept<br />
responsibility for the employment related side of that area<br />
so there is a decision that has already been made in that<br />
area. Now the ones that you have mentioned about duplication<br />
of services we have got timetables there in all the areas<br />
that you were -talking about. The area of home and community<br />
care services will be the subject of an immediate<br />
investigation and report back in May and the areas of health,<br />
aged care, houasing, child care, supported accommodation<br />
assistance procrram,, education, those are aoing to be subject<br />
of investigation by working groups now to report back before<br />
the end of next; year so that we will then work out how we can<br />
eliminate the duplication that in all of those areas exists<br />
now. So there has been agreement on principles, commitment<br />
now to the working parties to resolve unnecessary areas of<br />
duplication and that will result in some of these areas the<br />
actual delivery programs going over to the States and the<br />
Commonwealth Iretting out altogether but in some areas<br />
obviously there will still be a need for action by the States<br />
and the Cmmonwealth but we will have that operating in a<br />
more efficient way than it has up to the present. </p>
<p>SATTLER: But isn't sam&amp; of this going to be like trying to<br />
write Sir Humphrey out of Yes Minister. I mean how are you<br />
going to get the bureaucrats to agree?<br />
PM The distinguishing feature about this meeting was the<br />
determination. of the political leaders at the Commownealth<br />
and State level to set the agenda. we will not be frustrated<br />
in our comitments by any people who are trying to hold onto<br />
existing empire. whether it be ministers in our governments,,<br />
whether it be bureaucrats in our public services or be it<br />
people in the) private sector who to some extent will be<br />
threatened by some of the changes that we are bringing in.<br />
SATTLER: Well it sounds like you are expecting some<br />
resistance. PM: Well the whole of hlmn history shows that where people<br />
have a privileged position or one to which they were<br />
accustomed and enjoy certainly as in some sectors they are<br />
getting service. at a lower cost than they should they will<br />
always fight to protect their position of privilege.<br />
SATTLERs YOU are talking about the truckies now to a<br />
. degree, aren't you?<br />
PM: Some extent there although I am very encouraged by some<br />
of the responses that I have seen already from the transport<br />
industry generally who recognise the need for change. But I<br />
have got one slimple criterion in all this that I have had<br />
from the beginning when I launched this initiative in July of<br />
this year, one simple criteria. What is it that's good for<br />
the Australian people, what is it that is necessary to<br />
deliver services at a lower cost and to do it more<br />
efficiently and I will not be diverted from that criterion by<br />
the attempts by anyone to maintain present positions of<br />
privilege. SATTLE~ t So would you agree that some of the road hauliers<br />
are going to be put out of business by increased fees?<br />
PM: Not necessarily. I mean it may happen it will have an<br />
adverse impact on some of them but the simple fact is that<br />
the Australian citizen, your listener is being disadvantaged<br />
currently by the fact that the, and it's true all over<br />
Australia, that those who use the road system and impose the<br />
heaviest strain cause the most damage to the roads are not<br />
paying in anything like an appropriate cost recovery sense.<br />
That means that we are getting a distorted transport system<br />
in this country, we want to make a mere efficient rail<br />
freight system in this country that's why we have agreed, all<br />
of us to establish a national rail freight corporation we<br />
will put more investment into rail so that we can have more<br />
efficient movement of goods by rail. Now it's not going to<br />
be any good doing that and putting money into making a more<br />
efficient rail service if they are not going to be operating<br />
commercially against a heavily subsidised road system so your<br />
listeners are gloing to be better served by getting the </p>
<p>PX.: ( cont'd) efficiencies in what we are talking about now.<br />
As I have said yesterday Howard there never has been a tim<br />
in history whore economic reform is bought about without some<br />
pain, that's the way progress in made. You just don't leave<br />
things always the way they have been in the past, we would<br />
still be back in the caves if we operated like that.<br />
Leadership is an I have maid about leading and if at times<br />
that involves some opposition so be it. But we are now in<br />
the very fortunate position as a result of this initiative<br />
that these things have been decided upon by all leaders, the<br />
Commownealth a~ nd the States across the political spectrum so<br />
those who want to fight as it were, we have got a pretty<br />
unified sort of force they are up against.<br />
SA'DTLERs Talking about Opposition, at the moment the opinion<br />
Polls and I ) now you don't like to talk about opinion polls<br />
PM: I don't mind talking about them.<br />
SATTLERs Alright. Well the opinion polls today the latest<br />
ones I have seen show that Labor is 16% behind the coalition.<br />
Why do you reckon that is?<br />
PM: Well a number of reasons I don't think it is very<br />
difficult to work it out. It goes back in part to some of the<br />
things we havet just been talking about we have had to take<br />
some decisions which have caused some pain. The fact is that<br />
last year we wire as a nation just spending More than we were<br />
producing and that meant we were getting further and further<br />
into debt and we couldn't go on doing it so we had to slow<br />
the economy down and that meant, it has meant and it is<br />
continuing to mean a fair bit of pain and suffering. Now I<br />
think you have known me long enough Howard to know that I<br />
don't like doing those things but I had to do it because if<br />
we hadn't done it then the damage to Australia in the longer<br />
term would have. been much greater, the suffering more intense<br />
and I wasn't prepared to do that. Now while people are<br />
suffering now we are getting some black marks for it, I<br />
understand that I am not complaining about it I would be much<br />
more worried about myself if I hadn't done the things that<br />
were necessary. But having said that these policies will<br />
work they are slowing down the level of activity and it means<br />
we will be ablo I think next year to move into higher and<br />
more mutainable levels of activity in which people will start<br />
to get more confidence and they will be able to operate in a<br />
situation of leas pain.<br />
SATTLERt YOU zaekon that you would be beaten if their was a<br />
poll held this week?<br />
PM: Ye I think so I said that I wouldn't like to go to a<br />
poll now but the f act is I have just won a poll. I don't<br />
have to go to a poll for well over two years, about two and a<br />
half years and as you know I have said bef ore when we have<br />
been down, we were down badly before 87, we were down badly<br />
before </p>
<p>SATTLERs But not this much.<br />
PM: No not this much but we hadn't had to hurt so much and<br />
we didn't at that stage let me may we hadn't had the disaster<br />
of Victoria and that's reflected in the national figures.<br />
Now all I ami saying is that I said before the 87 election in<br />
the dark periods, I said before the 90 election in the dark<br />
Periods, I said in the and I have faith in the good sense of<br />
the Australian electorate and there in nothing that's<br />
happening which causes me to lose that faith.<br />
SATTLER: What about you personally you are down to 31%. Do<br />
you think the novelty of Bob Hawke has worn off?<br />
PM The novelty, I mean you are not novel after you have<br />
been Prim. Minister for the best part of eight year. of<br />
course by definition.<br />
SATTLER a Do you think that people want change for change<br />
sake in the leadership?<br />
P34: Not at all, not at all they are hurting at the moment<br />
they don't like that and of course the other thing in respect<br />
of leadership is that the conservatives have got rid of the<br />
absurd merry-go-round of Howard Peacock Howard-Peacock Howard<br />
Peacock Peacock Howard Peacock Howard<br />
SATTLERs I veto going to ask you about that. Do you think<br />
that John Hews on is a bigger challenge to you than them?<br />
PM: Well he is at this stage because he has the benef it of<br />
not being Howard and Peacock. I mean people have got sick of<br />
that absurdity and John Hewson was going to be a beneficiary<br />
of that. Now we get into a different part of the political<br />
cycle as we move on now, go on and on through this three year<br />
term up towards the election and he has got to live not on<br />
just being not John Howard or Andrew Peacock, he's got to be<br />
a credible leader with credible policies.<br />
SATTLERt He known a bit more about economics than Andrew<br />
Peacock doesn't. he?<br />
P14: It's impossible not to.<br />
SATTLERi Charming. Do you think he has got much substance<br />
behind him then?<br />
PM: He's got a solid academic experience but he has no great<br />
experience in the range of issues that a leader has to deal<br />
with. I mean if there has been one f eature of the last f ew<br />
weeks of the parliament it's been the revelation of his<br />
abysmal ignorance in the whole area of international affair.<br />
He ha. been profoundly wrong footed successively in regard to<br />
Japan, in regard to South Africa and in regard to our </p>
<p>8.<br />
PM: ( cont'd) relations with the USA. I mean he can'It open<br />
his international af fairs mouth without putting his f oot in<br />
into it and so perhaps he can learn in that area, he<br />
certainly ought to sack whoever is attempting to advise him<br />
at the moment to put up the questions that he<br />
SATTLERe Would you, even if the poll., your own polls show<br />
that you are behind coming to the next election, will you<br />
still make good your promise to lead Labor into the next<br />
election? PM Yes I have got no intention of changing that and nor has<br />
MY party.<br />
SATTLERs What about your Cabinet, do you think that they are<br />
a bit tired these days. Do you think that they need another<br />
shake up?<br />
PMI This is a nonsense this question about tiredness, you<br />
have had more relevant activity by government in this last 12<br />
months than you have had, I would think, I would challenge<br />
political analyst. to look at any period of government, mine<br />
or non Labor when there has been more relevant activity on<br />
the macro economic front, the micro economic front, the<br />
international front then there has been in this period. I<br />
mean there is no serious analyst now in politics who goes on<br />
with that sort of myth.<br />
SATTLERs Can I ask you one of the questionsp a story<br />
circulating here last weekend and it's been around before<br />
that Brian Burke might meek preselection for a Labor seat<br />
after he finishes his term as ambassador to Ireland. Would<br />
you support him if he wanted to do that?<br />
P11: I would have to look at the circumstances. I mean I<br />
don't know anyt~ hing about what he may have in mind.<br />
SheSA? TTLERs Well he in coming to see you in a week or two isn't<br />
PM: is he I don't know about that. I mean if it'. scheduled<br />
I certainly look forward to seeing him but it would depend<br />
upon obviously what he was looking at and what agreement he<br />
had within the party in Western Australia. I mean<br />
SATTLERt Well you once told me that he would be an asset as<br />
a minister in a federal government.<br />
PMe I did to., I had no reason to say otherwise when that<br />
question was asked. Now if he is wanting to pursue a<br />
political career and I don'It know whether he is then the<br />
question of my attitude to that is not simply a function of<br />
the judgement I make about Brian. I think he is a person of<br />
very considerable talent, but it would depend upon what<br />
circumstances was he looking at to try and make an entry into<br />
politics if that is in his mind and I honestly don't know<br />
whether it iii, all my comments to you are entirely<br />
hypothetical. </p>
<p>V I. 9 SATTLERs Would you still regard him an an asset if he wanted<br />
to. PMS I think there is no one who knows Brian Burke who<br />
believes other than that he has got very considerable talent*<br />
but an to whether he wants to try and pursue a political<br />
Career I just simply don't know. I mean you are really into<br />
the area of hypothesis am far as I am concened.<br />
BATTLER: Alright well we will leave it on that and I<br />
appreciate your time today and am I said at the start it<br />
certainly seems to have been a watershed in relations between<br />
the federal and state governments and I guesn it's all going<br />
to be, the proof will be in the meeting you hold in Perth in<br />
a year's time.<br />
PM: Well not all the proof, I mean there will be a lot done<br />
before then and indeed Howard a lot has been done already.<br />
The fact that we all signed yesterday an agreement to<br />
establish a national rail freight corporation which will come<br />
into ef fect by the f irst of July next year that is now a<br />
fact. It's alsia a fact that we have agreed yesterday to the<br />
division of rosponsibilies in the area of disabilities. I<br />
mean changes have already been made there will be more<br />
changes will be finalised in May next year. I t isa true<br />
however, that t: he conference in November next year in Perth<br />
will be a very important one but by then Howard we will have<br />
a lot of very substantial achievements already under our<br />
belt. Yesterday can properly describe, I mean it is the<br />
proper use of the word historic to describe what we did<br />
together and I am very very grateful to all the premiers for<br />
their cooperation including may I say to your listeners the<br />
very very signif icant contribution that was made by Premier<br />
Carmen Lawrence.<br />
