FOR MEDIA 2 JUNE 1987<br />
I have today sent the following message to His Excellency<br />
President Amin Gemayel of Lebanon:<br />
" It was with deep shock and regret that I learned of the<br />
tragic death of Mr Rashid Karame, Lebanon's Prime<br />
Minister and distinguished older statesman.<br />
Rashid Karame was a central figure in Lebanese political<br />
life for more than three decades and devoted the last<br />
years of his life to the sensitive and difficult search<br />
for national reconciliation.<br />
The manner of his death is a sharp reminder to us all of<br />
the tragic problems which continue to beset the Lebanese<br />
people. It is our fervent hope that Rashid Karame's<br />
death will encourage Lebanese communities to even<br />
greater efforts to achieve peace and progress through<br />
national unity.<br />
On behalf of the Government and people of Australia I<br />
extend sincere condolences to the members of nr Karaea'c<br />
family and to the people of Lebanon." </p>
