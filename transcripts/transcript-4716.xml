PRIME MAINISTE<br />
FOPR PRESS 21 MAY 1978<br />
ELECTORATE TALK<br />
Last Friday, Australia paid tribute to Sir Robert Menzies.<br />
Messages had come from many countries. His Royal Highness,<br />
Prince Charles, represeted The Queen. Men and women flew<br />
in from the United Kingdom, the United States, countries<br />
of Asia, from New Zealand, from all parts of the Pacific,<br />
from all parts of Australia to pay tribute to a man who had<br />
served this country for a life time.<br />
The service was simple. It emphasised Sir Robert Menzies'<br />
concern for Australia and for all the people of this country.<br />
Even though many had come from around the world, the greatest<br />
tribute of all camne from the tens of thousands who waited<br />
outside the church and who lined the road to the Springvale<br />
Crematorium. They, in their own way, were showing their<br />
respect for a person who had served Australia with courage,<br />
with integrity.<br />
Many of us have forgotten, I think, that Sir Robert Meniies<br />
began his Parliamentary career in 1928. He entered the<br />
Federal Parliament in 1936, before most Australians were born.<br />
After the War, he formed the Liberal Party. It is a Party<br />
designed to serve all Australia, owing no allegiance to any<br />
section or group, but believing in a philosophy of freedom,<br />
based upon the character and dignity of individual men arid<br />
women. He designed the Party to serve all Australia,<br />
to govern for all Australians.<br />
Over a record period as Prime Minister he did just that.<br />
He is respected as I believe, not only by his political<br />
supporters but also by those who would never have voted for<br />
his Party.<br />
He became a symbol of stability, and strength in Australia.<br />
He led a country where people could plan their own future,<br />
work for themselves, for their families, knowing thatthepolicies<br />
of Government would support them in their efforts, knowing that<br />
the Government was concerned for their well being.. / 2 </p>
<p>It was a record period of prosperity and growth, of social<br />
change, of innovation. He brought universities within the reach<br />
of all Australians, he did much to shape Australian society.<br />
As his reputation grew within Australia, so too our status as<br />
a nation was enhanced among the nations of the world,<br />
In Commonwealth conferences, in our own region, in Britain,<br />
and in the United States, Australia won a reputation beyond that<br />
owed to our mere physical size.<br />
A clear sighted view of events, a capacity to express what<br />
was happening or what should happen in terms that captured<br />
the imagination and support of people, won respect around<br />
the world.<br />
As testimony to that, look to those who came from overseas,<br />
from many countries, to pay homage to the memory of<br />
Sir Robert Menzies.<br />
Whatever service he was able to give to the world, the rjeal<br />
debt we owe is for his service to Australia as tens and tens of<br />
thousands recognised on Friday, as they lined the route.<br />
Let us think of Australia, let us ask ourselves, how our own<br />
actions affect Australia, how they affect our neighbours.<br />
Let us seek to contribute to the development and growth,<br />
the tolerance and strength of this nation. As we so act, then<br />
in part we will pay that debt. </p>
