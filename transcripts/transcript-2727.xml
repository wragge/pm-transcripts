PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS THE VOTING SYSTEM<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon. William<br />
McMahon, M. P.<br />
Whitlam has stated that a Labor Government would amend<br />
the electoral laws to abolish preferential voting and to introduce<br />
the first-past-the-post system. He qualifies his statement by<br />
adding that this would not be done until the re-election of his<br />
government after a first term of office:.<br />
The full implications of these announcements should be<br />
understood by every Australian.<br />
Mr. Whitlam is totally incapable of enforcing the<br />
qualification that this radical change would not be introduced in<br />
the first term. He cannot guarantee that he will remain the loader of his<br />
party. His leadership has been seriously challenged in the past.<br />
Given a taste of power, more significant challenges may be anticipated.<br />
Anyhow, Mr. Whitlan is the servant and not the master of<br />
his party's policies. He must obey the directions of the A. L. P.<br />
Federal Conference or risk expulsion. Ho has shown, particularly<br />
in policies on arbitration sanctions, that he is willing to reverse<br />
his policies at the crack of the whip from outside.<br />
If first-past-the-post voting is the policy of the A. L. P.<br />
as now reluctantly revealed by Pkr. Whitlam, there will be inevitable<br />
pressures to introduce it as soon as possible.<br />
First-past-the-post is a bad system.<br />
Its effect in this country would be to destroy the smaller<br />
minority parties and Independent candidates. That is what it is<br />
intended to do. That, in fact, is why it is used in some overseas<br />
countries. The intention of the Labor Party is crystal-clear: Once<br />
having gained power it would remove any possible threats to its<br />
future. This is a real and very serious threat. Labor aims,<br />
therefore, to neutralise and emasculate small parties such as the<br />
Australia Party, the D. O. G. S. and the D. L. P. so as to ensure that<br />
the preferences of any such groups ( or new political groups which<br />
may emerge) can never be turned against it, however extreme or<br />
offensive its policies may be. / 2 </p>

Mr. Whitlam's announcement is -the death sentence for such<br />
groups. It would be the destruction of valuable checks and balances,<br />
the end of minority voices vital to a healthy democracy.<br />
It is a strange irony of fate that those minority parties<br />
whose second preferences have been directed to Labor in the past<br />
are to be rewarded by extinction against the possibility that they<br />
may show some independence of spirit in the future.<br />
Under first-past-the-post, it is readily possible for a<br />
political party polling considerably lewss than one-half the vote<br />
to gain power. And once in power, it would be extremely difficult to<br />
remove. Mr. Whitlam's second aim is -to weaken the rural vote<br />
throughout Australia. He knows that country people by substantial<br />
majority support the Liberal and Country parties. He knows, too,<br />
that three-cornered contests ( where both Liberal and Country Party<br />
candidates are present) tend to be successful against Labor so he<br />
is seeking to make such contests impossible. Under first-past-thepost,<br />
a three-cornered contest would divide the coalition vote and<br />
allow a minority Labor candidate to win.<br />
Once again, the Labor Party is seeking to deny freedom of<br />
choice. It is seeking to destroy the total value of every vote<br />
cast in Australia for small groups or Independents.<br />
The right of such groups to exist and assert their<br />
influence is fundamental to the Australian political scene.<br />
This electoral issue, carefully suppressed by Labor until<br />
now, emerges as a major factor for izvaluation in this campaign.<br />
