<p>E&amp;OE  â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I am very proud of them and all Australia should be very proud of them.  Theyâve come, theyâve represented their country with a lot of quiet, uncomplicated pride.  And no matter what you do abroad for your country, whether itâs in the armed forces, as a sportsman or woman, or as an artist, if you do it with a sense of pride in being an Australian we can all identify with that.  And thatâs what these young men and women have done.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Are you proud of how the week has gone here ?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think itâs been a fantastic week.  Itâs been an opportunity to observe history, itâs been a week of hardheaded economic opportunity and I think itâs been highly successful.  And I donât think those who participated in it will forget it and I think it has been a two-way traffic.  Itâs an opportunity for us to mark the good aspects of our relationship with Britain, itâs also been an opportunity for the British to understand the enormous contribution that Australia has made to that relationship, to the defence of liberty on many occasions.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>And looking forward Prime Minister, is India more than just a visit, a goodwill visit?  Do you expect . . . .</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>There is nothing, there is nothing formal or tokenistic about my visit to India.  We have not had a head of government exchange with India since 1989.  The relationship needs more vigour and energy injected into it.  Itâs been to some extent a relationship thatâs been taken for granted.  Weâve assumed that because of some historical associations and the common membership of the Commonwealth and so forth that it will be alright.  Now I think we have to work a lot harder.  And India is a coming economic power, it has very high technological capability.  We do have quite a lot in common and I think we can do a lot more to develop the commercial relationship and itâs a good opportunity for me to discuss that with the Prime Minister and the various members of his ministry.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Will you discuss Fiji Prime Minister with him?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh, I am sure it will come up because of the natural interest of the Indian government in the position of Fijians of Indian heritage in that country.  Of course theyâre people who left, whose ancestors left India, a long time ago.  But they are naturally interested in the Indian diaspora in different parts of  the world and of course the subject will come up and Fiji remains a very difficult issue.  We are not happy with the racially based focus which has been taken.  The Indians of Fiji are as entitled as the Fijians of Fiji to a proper place in the sun and politically theyâre not being given that and that remains a matter of real concern.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
