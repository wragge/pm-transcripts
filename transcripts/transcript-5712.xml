PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA THURSDAY, 10 DECEMBER 1981<br />
INAUGURATION OF THE HUMANRIGHTS COMMISSION<br />
It is fitting that the Human Rights Commission should be<br />
-launched on Human Rights Day, because this day symbolises the<br />
commitment of Australia and many other nations to giving greater<br />
reality to human rights, and it also commemorates the struggles<br />
and the evolution through which the rights and privileges<br />
which we now enjoy have been achieved.<br />
It is 33 years since the United Nations Declaration of Human<br />
Rights was proclaimed as " a common standard of achievement<br />
for all peoples and all nations". That declaration has had<br />
a major impact on attitudes to rights, and it has been the<br />
focus for a great deal of thinking about rights, although<br />
the traditions of rights from which it was distilled are<br />
obviously centuries old.<br />
In Australia, many of our rights are established and protected<br />
by law, both common law and statute law. -In our courts, and<br />
through our system of responsible government we have strong, vital<br />
and practical mechanisms for securing our rights,.* and quite<br />
obviously, nobody should imagine that the Human Rights Commission<br />
would be any substitute for them. Those who criticise these<br />
mechanisms as inadequate guarantors of rights underestimate<br />
their strength and effectiveness, as well as their adaptabilit ' y<br />
and their capacity to take account of particular circumstances,<br />
because where questions of rights are concerned, the proof of<br />
the pudding is very decidedly in the eating, and in the<br />
overall sense human rights command great respect and protection<br />
in Australia. Any consideration of rights in Australia, or of<br />
problems which still need to be overcome, really does need to<br />
proceed against the background of this overall perspective.<br />
There is a further dimension to this, because while the law<br />
has a vital role to play in the protection of rights, human<br />
rights, in the end, are a matter of attitudes and relationships<br />
between people. In the absence of respect for people, or a<br />
recognition of human dignity, in the absence of the attitude<br />
which believes in the ! opportunities for all and encourages the<br />
fullest use of human potential, in the absence of an understanding<br />
of the social factors, both existent and emerging, which impinge<br />
upon the enjoyment of rights, there is little. which the law<br />
or any other mechanism can do. .12 </p>

Indieed, when people resort to the law to protect their rights,<br />
they typically do so only because their rights have already<br />
been infringed. It is a trap to depend too much upon law for<br />
the enjoyment of rights, or to imagine that more laws, different.<br />
kinds of laws, or a greater resort to law, can be a substitute<br />
for attitudes and relationships between people, and it is<br />
worth remembering Cicero's words, " the more law, the less<br />
justice". The Human Rights Commiission forms part of a<br />
network of human rights initiatives which the Government has<br />
been taking.<br />
Our concern for people's rights at the international level is<br />
obviously not new, and the record of the willingness of Australians<br />
to help other peoples to maintain their rights and freedom is<br />
carved in the honour. rolls of every city and country town.<br />
This same essential concern about violations-of human rights,<br />
wherever they occur, has been at work in the Government's recent<br />
activities in international forums.<br />
Australia has been a member of the United Nations Commission on<br />
Human Rights for two successive terms, and I believe it is<br />
worth referring here to the,. section on human rights in the fina.<br />
communique of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in<br />
Melbourne, in which Australia, together with other Commonwealth<br />
countries, urged governments to accede to relevant global and<br />
regional instruments on human rights, endorsed the principle<br />
of a special unit in the Commonwealth Secretairiat-for the<br />
promotion of human rights within the Commonwealth, and took<br />
steps towards obt aining an agreed definition of human rights<br />
within the Commonwealth.<br />
The Government's human rights initiatives within Au stralia since<br />
1975 include the establishment of the Administrative Appeals<br />
Tribunal, the Administrative Decisions ( Judicial Review) Act,<br />
the Administrative Review Council, and the Commonwealth<br />
Ombudsman, together with the Freedom of Information Legislation.<br />
These initiatives amount to an impressive package of administrat~ ive<br />
reform, which protects the rights of individuals against<br />
bureaucracy, and the Government has recently proposed a number of<br />
reforms in the area of criminal law.<br />
The Human Rights Commission has been established in '. fulfilment<br />
of an election commitment. It represents a unique approach<br />
to issues of human rights, ainu it has the capacity to make an<br />
innovative contribution to the advancement of rights in<br />
Australia. In considering questions of rights, the Commission<br />
has for its points of reference a number of international<br />
statements of rights, including the International Convenant of<br />
Civil and Political Rights, the Declaration of the Rights of<br />
the Child, the Declaration of the Rights of Mentally Retarded<br />
Persons, and the Declaration of the Rights of Disabled Persons.<br />
And let me add that ratification by Australia of a future<br />
United Natliohs, Convention of the Rights of the Child would<br />
not detract from the Commission's obligations. under the 1959<br />
Declaration of the Rights of the Child. / 3 </p>
<p>43<br />
This adds up t o an imaginative and broad-ranging charter, and<br />
it is plain that the framework within which the Commission's<br />
deliberations may take place is indeed relatively unconfined.<br />
I have no doubt that for Australia, the Human Rights Commission<br />
represents a commitment to human rights which is far more profound,<br />
relevant and effective thanm any alternative measure. For the<br />
functions and powers of the Commission are based four square<br />
upon the fundamental realities of the acceptance and<br />
development of human rights in civilised communities.<br />
I would like to refer specifically to one particular function<br />
which the Commission will perform within its charter, namely<br />
" to inquire into any act or practice that may be inconsistent<br />
with or contrary to any human right", and then to endeavour<br />
to effect a settlement, or else report on the results of its<br />
inquiry. This represents a constructive and realistic<br />
approach to the promotion of human rights, especially in a<br />
society or with a Government which has a genuine concern for people's<br />
rights. And it is an approach which will surely be even more<br />
positive and constructive in conjunction with other functions of<br />
the Commission, especially those of promoting understanding<br />
and acceptance of human rights, and of undertaking research and<br />
educational progress.<br />
It will obviously be a task for the Commission, not only to come<br />
to grips with exisrting problems, but also to identify issues 6f<br />
concern as they appear on the horizon, because it is important that<br />
our thinking and practice of rights be kept up to date in a<br />
changing world. The Commission is a unique blend of conciliatory<br />
machinery of research, educational and promotional capacity, and<br />
of advisory functions. Its essential powers are to inform, to<br />
recommend, and to persuade, and granted that human rights are<br />
ultimately a matter of attitudes and relationships between<br />
people, these powers of influence and persuasion are the decisive<br />
ones. They are also powers which present the Commission with a<br />
challenge and I am confident that the Commissioners will<br />
approach their task with a C: mbination of dedication -and<br />
ability which will enable the challenge to be met.<br />
I would like to congratulate the Commissioners on their<br />
appointment. They are eight people, four men and four women,<br />
drawn widely from around Australia, representing a cross section<br />
of society which includes Aboriginal and ethnic communities.<br />
I am sure that we are all delighted that Justice Roma Mitchell<br />
of the Supreme Court of South Australia is heading this<br />
Commission, and I have great pleasure in wishing the CommissionErs<br />
every success, on behalf of all Australians, in discharging<br />
your responsibilities as Commissioners. </p>
