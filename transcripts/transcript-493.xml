AUSTRALIAN _ UIThrR3rL IESCO1% tY1ISSI =, L<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER. ' THE RT. HON. R. G, MENZIES<br />
IN THE HOUSE ' OF . PRESENTATIVE3<br />
This, as honourable members will see, is a simple bill.<br />
Up to now, the Australian Universities Commission has consisted<br />
of five members. One of them, a very notable Australian<br />
scientist, Sir Leslie Martin, is the full-time chairman. The<br />
other four are part-time members. They are Professor N. S.<br />
Bayliss of the University of Western Australia, Professor<br />
A. D. Trendall of the Australian National University, Sir Kenneth<br />
Wills of Adelaide and Dr. J. Vernon, a well known businessman of<br />
Sydney. The commission has undoubtedly devoted a great deal of<br />
time to its work and has, I think, served the country with very<br />
great distinction. But the university problem is developing very<br />
rapidly. New universities, such as Monash in Victoria, are<br />
coming into existence and there is increasing pressure to have<br />
medical schools established in those new universities. One can<br />
understand that very well. It occurred to us that, under these<br />
circumstances, it would be very desirable to add to the<br />
strength of the commission a membjr who would be familiar with<br />
the problems of medical schools and with their administration.<br />
No current member of the commission has special qualities of that<br />
kind. We believe that if we can get a first-class man,<br />
authoritative in medical schools and their work, this will be of<br />
tremendous assistance to the commission when examining and forming<br />
judgment upon claims that are made. This means, of course, that<br />
we will be adding to the strength of the commission one more<br />
member who might be regarded, classifying them broadly, as an<br />
academic member. Under these circumstances, the Government feels that it<br />
is desirable in order to preserve the general balance in this<br />
commission, to add one further member experienced in business and<br />
financial matters. The commission will then number seven, six of<br />
the members being part-time and one of them, the chairman, being<br />
continually at work. I do not . want to occupy the time of the<br />
House by reminding members that the Universities Coimmission, by<br />
its recommendations, following upon inv.; stigations and<br />
consultations, has already been able to do a great deal of good<br />
for the university system in Australia. As we all want to see<br />
. that work 6ontirv', e1, and as we. warnnt to see more opportunities<br />
' for people to have the b. nofit of u. ivritcy iz., lhave,.. no.<br />
doubt that honourale membors will agree with to proposd<br />
increase ia the membership of the commission. </p>
