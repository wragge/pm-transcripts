TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
SPEECH AT THE AUSTRALIAN INSTITUTE OF ARCHITECTS AWARDS<br />
( NEW SOUTH WALES CHAPTER), SYDNEY, 28 JUNE 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF ONLY<br />
Well Prime Minister's don't receive too many awards. There is only one is<br />
really interested in and that is the one that comes around every three years.<br />
But 1 am very honoured and very flattered to receive this.<br />
I am very interested in architecture. I do have a bit of a fetish with temple<br />
pediments and things like that, but you all know about that probably. But that<br />
doesn't disqualify me from being interested in the environment In which we live<br />
and I have always been interested in beauty. I know it Is a word out of the<br />
lexicon these days but Itsh ouldn't be out of our minds because wherever we<br />
look, wherever our eyes may fall, It should be something which cheers us up,<br />
which gives us improvement in the quality of our existence, which encourages<br />
us to do things.<br />
I am sure you are all run by your eyes and I probably am too. And, I first<br />
started to develop mine, pressing with my nose against Stanley Lipscombe's<br />
Antique Shop in Bathurst Street, Sydney Stella to his friends. And Stella was<br />
very obliging in terms of taking people in and teaching them things. And<br />
Leo Schofield who is known to you all as another one of his students and<br />
there were some other mentors I had.<br />
But it all, in the end, for me got back to architecture and to the history of<br />
architecture and to that I have been particularly interested. As you know my<br />
interest has been in the Greek revival or the neo-classical and we are seeing<br />
a bit of th~ at happen around these days too. There's a bit of revisionism that<br />
has been going on.<br />
One can take an Interest In the development of cities and the way people live<br />
in the built environment. But I have always thought that the greatest challenge<br />
has been with the modern architect who with the disposable society has been<br />
stuck with the disposable building where we have had the mass congregation<br />
of people in cities for work. That is changing a bit now and probably<br />
Information technology will change it more as we go on where people will be </p>
<p>TEL: 29. Jun. 95 20: 26 No. 023 P. 02<br />
2<br />
able to work other than in congregations, or in large capital city buildings,<br />
which are put up for amenity and for function without any real premium on<br />
their role in the streetscape or the cityscape and where they can be disposed<br />
of after 20 years and something built in their place.<br />
It is a great challenge, I think, for architects to live in that environment<br />
whereas most of the people who have written the text books lived in an age<br />
where great public buildings were built or, if not public buildings, by private<br />
patrons who themselves developed architectural interests. There was a<br />
premium on everything they did as there was in most countries and in most<br />
cities and we have got a reasonable heritage in this country of them.<br />
But as time has borne on, that premium has come back and you have seen it<br />
come back in public buildings. Some of the worst buildings built these days<br />
are public buildings more is the pity and that is changing too, I think.<br />
But we have had our urban design taskforce, which has presented a first class<br />
report to us about design in the cities and urban development and housing<br />
choice and these, I think, ought to be important things for us. I think we are<br />
probably entering a new epoch where a premium is going to come back on to<br />
CBD-type development, or precinct development, and this will give the<br />
interested patron, or developer, a chance to have an influence, a greater<br />
influence, than we have seen with the sarcophagi that have been ordered-up<br />
by provident mutual funds and other distinguished bodies who have not really<br />
been Interested In what they have built, but rather the economics of It.<br />
We have a very great country, a very Il'arge country, but as large as It Is, given<br />
our strong urban configuration and consolidation, even this is not large<br />
enough for us and we are running out of space. The Premies [ Cares]<br />
remarks recently about the sprawl of Sydney are a case In point. And, I think,<br />
another challenge there is for housing choice and style of our suburbs and the<br />
quality of life we offer people.<br />
These are real issues, I think, for Australians because we have such a unique<br />
opportunity. We are the only nation on earth that has a continent to itself and<br />
our stewardship of that continent should be such that whether it be the coasts,<br />
or the native forests, or the river systems, or the cities, we should be now<br />
nurturing it as never before, understanding now as never before what a great<br />
opportunity and a singular opportunity we have been given.<br />
I hope that the Commonwealth can play a greater role. We have never<br />
formally had much of a role in urban planning but through the Better Cities<br />
program we have been able to do some quite interesting things. John<br />
mentioned Pyrmont. Last week I was at the railyards In Launceston and that<br />
is a lovely city with a great architectural heritage. And we are doing things In<br />
certain locations around the country which will spark development Interest<br />
around them just as Darling Harbour, perhaps as a typical example, has done<br />
here in New South Wales. The original public investment [ in Darling Harbour]<br />
has now been multiplied many times over and if we can get good planning<br />
regimes and Interested community participation, I think, we can really do some<br />
interesting things with Commonwealth funding In some of these areas and </p>
<p>TEL: 29. Jun. 95 20: 26 No .023 P. 03<br />
3<br />
doing it with the States and Local Government and bringing those three tiers<br />
of Government together and bringing private developers to it as well. I think<br />
this does offer us some opportunities.<br />
I think we need to be very hard with developers.* I don't think developers<br />
deserve to have many rights. I don't believe in leaving it to " the market" in the<br />
development of cities, or In urban development. I think there has to be always<br />
the predominant public interest question prevailing and, therefore, we should<br />
encourage developers but we should encourage them within frameworks<br />
which we as a community endorse and not to be held hostage to the things<br />
that they propose to us.<br />
Mr Grollo's proposal for the new hundred storey-odd building in Melbourne is<br />
an example of what we shouldn't be doing or whiat we shouldn't tolerate.<br />
So to the extent that I can say some things about this, or add to the<br />
commonweal, to put a premium on architecture, to put a premium on the<br />
creativity of people whose profession it is to think about the sort of buildings<br />
we build, the way we live in them, those who occupy them, and those who<br />
have to look at them and the environment in which they sit, these are the<br />
things, I think, that Government's perhaps can do perhaps at a distance in<br />
some respects but where we do have an influence ourselves, encourage the<br />
best things to happen if it is at all possible.<br />
At any rate, I suppose In many respects, the Sydney Morning Herald has<br />
described me as a frustrated State planning minister but then the Sydney<br />
Morning Herald has described me in many ways the truth Is there may be a<br />
grain of truth In that.<br />
At any rate, I am not going to while ever the wrath of democracy leaves me<br />
standing I am not going to desist from arguing the case for good urban<br />
design and thoughtful development of our landscape, of our coasts, of keeping<br />
our eyes sharply on that great inheritance-we have been given. If that helps<br />
this profession I would be very pleased indeed. But I am very honoured by<br />
the fact that you have thought it might have already. Thank you.<br />
