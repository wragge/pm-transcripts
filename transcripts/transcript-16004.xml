    <content><![CDATA[<p>PM: I've just spoken to the Chief of Defence Force who has advised me that Signaller Sean McCarthy was killed yesterday afternoon on active duty while on service in Afghanistan. On active duty in service of the Australian nation.</p>
<p>He was killed on operations in Oruzgan Province by an improvised explosive device. Two other members of the Australian Defence Force have been wounded. One is being treated in Tarin Kowt and the other in Kandahar. I've been advised by the CDF that their injuries are non life threatening.</p>
<p>Sean McCarthy was 25 years old. He joined the army in Brisbane some seven years ago. He has recently been a member of the Signal Squadron embedded within the SAS in Perth.</p>
<p>Sean McCarthy was a fine Australian soldier, in the best traditions of the Australian Defence Force. He'd been commended for his previous active service on two overseas deployments, one earlier in Afghanistan and one also in East Timor.</p>
<p>Sean McCarthy is a terrible loss to his family, a terrible loss to the Australian Defence Force and a terrible loss to the Australian nation.</p>
<p>The Australian Defence Force is the pride of the Australian nation and the pride of the Australian people.</p>
<p>My thoughts, my prayers go to his family at this terrible time. My thoughts, my prayers and the deepest thoughts and prayers of the Australian nation of people go to his family, his loved ones. They go to the family and loved ones of all members of the Australian Defence Force on deployment abroad engaged in difficult and dangerous operations.</p>
<p>Take your questions</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Prime Minister does this highlight once again the dangers that Australian forces do face in Afghanistan? That it's not an easy mission for them there?</p>
<p>PM: As I've said before, this is a difficult, dangerous and bloody operating environment. We have lost Australian forces before, my fear is that we will lose them again. This is a terrible loss for his family today and we honour his service to his country.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Do you know, are there are any issues about protection on vehicles etcetera that this incident raises at all?</p>
<p>PM: The Chief of the Defence Force and I discussed the circumstances surrounding this death. This of course will be investigated fully by the Australian Defence Force.</p>
<p>We are dealing with improvised explosive devices. These are the source of many of the attacks in recent times in Afghanistan. Of course, we are also dealing with a time of year as the weather has warmed where there is an intensity of operations as well on the part of the enemy.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Mr Rudd do you know how close he was to (inaudible) and Tarin Kowt. To the base camp?</p>
<p>PM: I'm advised by the CDF not to speculate publicly on the location of the operation.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Mr Rudd is Afghanistan you will be raising in (inaudible) this afternoon?</p>
<p>PM: In my discussions with various other contributing states including for example the Canadians, and others, this would be a matter of normal discussion. Many countries contribute to Afghanistan. Many have recently increased their troop deployment, including the French.</p>
<p>This is continued concerning for all contributing states. As I said earlier this year in Bucharest, we in Australia would be subjecting our deployment and the overall success of our strategy, that is the combined allied strategy in Afghanistan, to annual review. That is an important and logical way to proceed.</p>
<p>As I've said before, when it comes to our future deployment in Afghanistan, we are there for the long term, we are there for the long haul. But, there is no such thing as a blank cheque.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Mr Rudd you're here for the G8 meeting on climate change can I just ask you quickly, what is your view of the agreement that was reached yesterday, that talks about a shared vision and 50 per cent cuts? Does that cut far enough, are you happy with that?</p>
<p>PM: What I'd prefer to do, just because of the news we're just received, is focus just on the Afghanistan matter and this terrible loss just now.</p>
<p>I am speaking to at length this afternoon, I am to happy to  - </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: (Inaudible)</p>
<p>PM: I'm happy to speak to you on any other matter then.</p>
<p>If there is concern about that. (Inaudible) I'll say something about that then.</p>
<p>When it comes to the globe and the challenges we all face, I will be speaking with world leaders about the content of the conclusions yesterday from the G8. I have said, and Ill say again, that all nations must put their shoulder to the wheel in doing more to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p>That becomes now more important because of the science. And it is important not just that we achieve progress in our individual talks here, but we don't know how much progress can be achieved.</p>
<p>It is much more important that our negotiators involved in the detailed negotiations between now and the Copenhagen conference at the end of next year, are given sufficient political momentum, and sufficient political support, to bring about an effective agreement.</p>
<p>This will be a tough road, it will be a hard road and we must do everything we can as world leaders to ensure that our negotiators have as effective a negotiating mandate as possible.</p>
