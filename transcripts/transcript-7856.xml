CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
SECOND ANNIVERSARY OF FAMILY ALLOWANCE SUPPLEMENT<br />
QUEANBEYAN 13 DECEMBER 1989<br />
Today we ar6 celebrating the second anniversary of the<br />
Family Allowance Supplement.<br />
It is one of my Government's truly significant and enduring<br />
improvements in social justice, providing tax-free cash<br />
assistance to low-income families.<br />
At present, more than half a million families some 1.2<br />
million children are being helped with Family Allowance<br />
Supplement payments or their equivalent in extra pensions<br />
and benefits.<br />
This Federal Government assistance provides a valuable and<br />
reliable source of help for families struggling to make ends<br />
meet. Next month we will be lifting the amounts of money to be<br />
paid under the Family Allowance and the Family Allowance<br />
Supplement. FAS payments will be lifted to $ 24.15 a week for each child<br />
under 13 and $ 35.25 a week for teenagers aged between 13 and<br />
Because these payments are free of tax they are far more<br />
valuable than a wage increase of a similar amount.<br />
To illustrate this point, for a single income family earning<br />
$ 320 a week with three children the tax free FAS payment of<br />
$ 109 per week is equivalent to a wage rise of $ 167 per week.<br />
I can say with pride -no other Federal Government has ever<br />
made such a commitment to Australian families.<br />
But we are not resting on our laurels.<br />
We recognise that more can and should be done to help<br />
children and families with children. * 1 W( JH1i </p>

' emov ng hardship is not merely a questiol of providi. ng<br />
secur ty of income but al] so involves the provision of<br />
servi( es by Federal and State Governments and community<br />
organisations services that help children develop to their<br />
maxim m potential and participate fully in society when they<br />
grow ? p.<br />
It is essential that such services are available,<br />
co-ordinated and accessible to the people who need them.<br />
I've Oeen discussing ways we can address this issue with the<br />
Austr lian Council of Social Service.<br />
And I " have this week written to each of the State Premiers<br />
invit! ng their participation in this joint effort.<br />
I am asking the Premiers to review, with us, all the ways we<br />
can inprove the effectiveness of the services for children<br />
we provide.<br />
My fri'ends, I don't make any attempt to deny that many<br />
people are hurting as a result of the tough economic<br />
challqpges we are going through.<br />
High ihterest rates are understandably a focus of community<br />
concer I just, say: let's make sure that in measuring where we<br />
stand, as families or as a nation, we don't rely on only one<br />
yardst ck.<br />
We shoPld look at the totality of the economic picture<br />
improvements in the social wage, and our record levels of<br />
investhent, employment and training all of which are<br />
laying! the foundations for a stronger and more prosperous<br />
Austra ia in future years.<br />
We're &amp; elebrating one significant new element in the social<br />
wage t day, the Family Allowance Supplement. But there are<br />
many o hers: more kids are staying on at school and for<br />
longer there are more university and training places; more<br />
child care places; Medicare; higher real pensions for the<br />
elderly to name a few.<br />
What's important to understand is that these improvements<br />
for pr sent Australians these building blocks for the<br />
wellbe: ng of future Australians have been possible only<br />
becaus of the restraint displayed by the Australian people<br />
over r cent years.<br />
Responsible wage outcomes have meant higher profits; this in<br />
turn h s led to record investment and more jobs.<br />
That il an equation that means a better future for<br />
Austraiians.<br />
4 i </p>
<p>We are also finding, of course, that present Australians<br />
have to endure a period of high interest rates because<br />
interest raies are necessary to slow the surge in imports<br />
we've been xperiencing.<br />
But when interest rates come down as they will when it is<br />
responsible to bring them down we will see even more<br />
clearly that we have created a much stronger Australia:<br />
aP Australia where people are in jobs; an<br />
Australia where some $ 90 billion in new<br />
ivestments are in the pipeline or being seriously<br />
cinsidered; and an Australia where the workforce<br />
it being re-skilled.<br />
And we will have created a much fairer Australia:<br />
a Australia enduringly capable of providing the<br />
a sistance to low income families that we are<br />
c lebrating today. 1 j </p>
