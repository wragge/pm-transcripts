J. AUSTFALIA~<br />
PRIME MNSTEF?<br />
FOR MEDIA Thursday, l17 1arch 1983<br />
The Government has received many requests in the past week from<br />
organisations and individuals wishing to participate in the<br />
National Economic Summit.<br />
In response to these requests the original list of invitees has<br />
been expanded.<br />
A number of broadly based community groups have also bEen invited<br />
to the Summit as observers.<br />
However, it has not been possible to include all those who have<br />
asked to participate in the Summit because of the limited<br />
capacity of the H1-ouse of Representatives Chamber.<br />
Another important consideration has been the need to ensure<br />
the Summit is small enough to allow, productive discussion.<br />
I will be writing in the next few days to everyone who has<br />
been in contact with the Government about the Summit to express<br />
my thanks for their interest.<br />
The Government will be providing other f" orums for discussion<br />
and consultation, including the Economic Planning Advisory<br />
Council, industry advisory councils, advisory councils to<br />
Ministers and pre-Budget discussions.<br />
Canberra Note: Attached is the final list of participants and observers. </p>
