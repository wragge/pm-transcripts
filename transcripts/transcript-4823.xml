FOR PRESS 16 SEPTEMBER, 1978<br />
Reports of a disagreement . within-the Ministry over the<br />
appointment of a Ministerial Committee on industrial<br />
relations, and over a statement on employment, are<br />
completely untrue.<br />
one major newspaper has a story this morning which I<br />
have discussed with the Minister for Employment and<br />
Industrial Relations, Tony Street.<br />
As far as we are both concerned there is no element of<br />
truth in the story whatsoever. I have total confidence<br />
in Tony Street. He is one of the best Ministers for<br />
Industrial Relations that Australia has ever had.<br />
Tony Street will chair the new Committee. As we know,<br />
industrial relations and industrial law are a complex area.<br />
The Minister and the Committee will be concerned with<br />
achieving a better industrial climate, a greater measure<br />
of support for the conciliation and arbitration system and<br />
a greater understanding of the importance of good<br />
industrial relations to all Australians for our economic<br />
well-being, and for growth in employment. It will review<br />
industrial law as well as the processes of consultation<br />
and understanding.<br />
Industrial relations is an important area, not only to the<br />
participants, but to the nation as a whole.<br />
It affects the economy, overseas and domestic investment,<br />
business confidence, and employment opportunities.<br />
The Government's policies under Tony Street have achieved<br />
a marked improvement over the past few years.<br />
But, because the area is so important, the Government wants<br />
to review what has been done, and to see what further steps<br />
it ought to take.<br />
To suggest that such a review implies any criticism of<br />
Tony Street is the grossest distortion. / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
Mr. Street's statement to the Parliament on employment<br />
was fully agreed to by both the Treasurer and myself.<br />
The Minister had suggested it some considerable time<br />
ago and received support for his suggestions.<br />
It was necessary to lay out the position plainly so that<br />
all Australians could understand the nature of the tasks<br />
in front of us. That is what the Minister has done.<br />
Let me say in the plainest terms, that I have never had<br />
a significant difference with Tony Street over the<br />
conduct of his portfolio.<br />
I am advised that the author of the story that appeared<br />
in one morning newspaper did not check with my office.<br />
I am also advised that the same author did not check<br />
with Mr. Street's office.<br />
Whatever his sources might have been, they can only be<br />
misinformed and mischievous.<br />
The business of Government is complex, especially in our<br />
modern society. It is made all the more difficult, and<br />
quite unnecessarily so, when stories are written without<br />
foundation, without truth, and are mischievous and<br />
damaging in their content.<br />
Australia is entitled to better reporting, to a more<br />
constructive press. 000---</p>
