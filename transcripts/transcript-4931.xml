PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PR E S S 2 11 DECEM BER 1978<br />
CHINESE AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT<br />
The Prime Minister has written to the State Premiers and to the<br />
Chief Minister for the Northern Territory asking for their<br />
cooperation in developing a coordinated Australian approach<br />
to the Chinese Government in areas of Chinese economic development<br />
in which Australia has special expertise.<br />
During the recent visit to China by the Deputy Prime Minister,<br />
Mr Anthony, the Chinese Government zade it clear that it felt<br />
Australia could make a particularly useful contribution in their<br />
agricultural modernisation programme.<br />
China intends, through increased mechanisation and scientific<br />
farming practices, to substantially increase food production<br />
over the next few years.<br />
The particular Australian expertise on which Chinese Ministers<br />
focussed was in dryland farming, sugar production and animal<br />
-husbandry.<br />
Accordingly, the Government intends sending specialist missions<br />
to China as soon . as possible to investigate prospects in these<br />
fields in more detail.<br />
The prospects for increased sales of Australian agricultural<br />
machinery and technology to China as a result of recent<br />
Ministerial visits were attractive.<br />
The Prime Minister said he would welcome interest by the States<br />
in joining with the Commonwealth in a coordinated early endeavour<br />
to expand our already close trading links with China. </p>
