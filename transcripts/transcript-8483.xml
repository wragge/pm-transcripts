TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
DOORSTOP, CANBERRA, APRIL 2 1992<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
PM: I'll. just start by making a Couple of points. In the<br />
House this afternoon the Leader of the Opposition in a<br />
motion which apparently the Opposition had planned this<br />
morning and was not spontaneous, that was a censure of<br />
the Speaker, in a premeditated, careful and deliberate<br />
way tried to suggest and link me and my role in public<br />
life with some_ crim-inal behavio -ur which is now part and<br />
parcel of the-NSW prion _ system..<br />
Dr Hewson promised to make our public life and elevate<br />
the parliamentary debate when he became Leader. The<br />
Opposition has not been travelling well in Parliament<br />
House for a number of weeks. But there are ways for<br />
them to remedy that, that's lift their game and not try<br />
to suggest that the NSW Labor Party is a criminal<br />
organ isation.<br />
I rang Dr Hewson a moment or two ago and I said to him<br />
that I was very disappointed that he should have<br />
stooped to such a tactic. Very much more in sorrow<br />
than in anger, I said to him that I thought he should<br />
reconsider his position, that he should either make a<br />
withdrawal of what he said or repeat it outside the<br />
Parliament where it can be adjudicated upon in the<br />
appropriate manner, of course in the courts. He said<br />
' 1 heard what you said', iand I said in that case you'd<br />
better go and think about it. So I've left him on that<br />
point. But I simply say this, that the contest of the House of<br />
Representatives should be as it's always been about<br />
policy and occasionally, of course, in the heat of the<br />
moment personal remarks are made. But premeditated<br />
remarks which reflect and try to put a criminal slur on<br />
the one branch of the Labor Party which more than any<br />
other has been pivotal the Federal Labor Party's<br />
federal success and suggesting that it's a mafia which<br />
runs from the prison system to the Prime Ministership<br />
is a deliberate slur, totally without foundation, </p>

unjustified and can do nothing but lower the esteem of<br />
the Parliament in the eyes of the public.<br />
J: Do you think Leo McLeay's performance might have lead<br />
Dr Hewson to exasperation?<br />
PM: No. Because the Opposition were considering this<br />
morning moving a Censure of the Speaker and you notice<br />
it was moved not after in a raucous part of the debate<br />
or a raucous answer, it was moved as Question Time had<br />
come to Its natural end. it was a premeditated<br />
movement to attack the one person who is not able to<br />
attack in the Parliament. They have attacked the one<br />
person who can't fight back, I mean if he wished to<br />
attack anybody he should attack me. But as you know<br />
the Question Time didn't go well for the Opposition end<br />
hasn't done for weeks and they've decided now that they<br />
should attack the most defenceless person in the place<br />
which is the Speaker.<br />
J: Prime Minister, what about the performance of the<br />
Speaker, what do you really think?<br />
PM: I think all Speakers are put under pressure whenever<br />
the contest of ideas is being fought out. We've got<br />
now two packages, we've got the ' One Nation' Statement<br />
and we've got the GST tax of the Opposition, the goods<br />
and services tax, and the debate is willing as it<br />
should be in the national interest. And I think it is<br />
very unfair of the Opposition to try to make an assault<br />
on the speaker. If they wish to attack anybody, let<br />
them attack the Government and we can handle their<br />
attacks with consummate ease.<br />
J: Mr Keating, does the Speaker enjoy your unqualified<br />
support?<br />
PM: He does enjoy my unqualified support. But the point is<br />
not movement of 8 motion against Mr McLeay can for one<br />
second absolve the Leader of the Opposition from what I<br />
think is a sort of detraction which was only last seen<br />
in the Parliament when a former Opposition Leader, the<br />
former Opposition Leader called the former Prime<br />
Minister a ' little crook'. This is the last time the<br />
Parliament has got down to these depths and I think Dr<br />
Hewson should repair the position.<br />
ENDS. </p>
