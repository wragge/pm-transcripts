    <content><![CDATA[<p>Thank you, Mike, for your leadership of New South Wales.</p>
<p>Your state - our state - and the nation owe you a great debt.</p>
<p>You've restored the state's finances and you are building the infrastructure that sets New South Wales up for the 21st century economy.</p>
<p>You've played a great innings and we thank you for it.</p>
<p>You've opened your heart and explained why you are retiring all too soon.</p>
<p>We understand that and I want to wish you, on behalf of myself and Lucy, you and Kerryn and all your family the very best and the greatest success in the years ahead.</p>
<p><strong>[Ends]</strong></p>
