PRIME MINISTER WITH DOUG AITON ON RADIO 3L0, 16/ 3/ 94.<br />
E OE PROOF ONLY<br />
AITON: Prime Minister, Paul Keating, good afternoon.<br />
PM: How are you Doug?<br />
AITON: Very well indeed thank you. You must be very pleased with the results that<br />
came out today on the economy.<br />
PM: I think it vindicates what I said on behalf of the Government in the election<br />
campaign, that we had a growth economy on our hands, that we could re-ignite the<br />
economy back into growth indiiml-yment growth, and today's figures which give us<br />
four percent growth in the economy over the year and two hundred thousand jobs and<br />
low inflation as a kind of trifecta I think Australians should be very pleased with.<br />
AITON: Also the tenth consecutive quarter of growth I think In a row, It Is consecutive?<br />
PM: Yes it is. So it's firm and it's growing, it's on a broad front, it's now got a very high<br />
share of profits in the economy which are still driving it. The tax cuts which the<br />
Government delivered late last year certainly promoted consumer spending and that's<br />
shown up in striong retail sales. So by and large it is, as I said a year ago and most of<br />
the day.<br />
AITON: And what about exports, which is so crucial to us to improve upon. They<br />
came up I think 2.7% inicreas-, was it?<br />
PM: For the year, and they were growing as fast as imports across the year, so<br />
we've made the great jump to exports and a leap into Asia, particularly with<br />
manufactured products. But I think the great thing about it is not just the level of the<br />
growth, which I might say Doug is now stronger than any other western economy, but<br />
with low inflation.<br />
AITON: Yes, can you keep that up? Can we keep that up?<br />
PM: Well I think so. I think so, and the good thing about these accounts is that there's<br />
a number of measures of inflation. The one that we all know is the CPI, the Consumer<br />
Price Index, but that's got a basket of goods in it and even with all the -good'sit Fias<br />
we've got inflation for the year at 1 Well, there's another thing called, wait for it,<br />
it's called the non-farm GDP deflator. Now what it means is, it's an even broader<br />
measure of prices than the CPI and it came out I think one four, so I mean it's very<br />
good confirmation that inflation is low and the trick will be now to keep the productivity<br />
coming through so wage increases which come in the next year or so are protected by<br />
a fair bit of productivity, protecting the inflation rate by productivity. </p>
<p>AITON: The media criticism comes out of course on days like today, and the one that<br />
I've heard most is that business investment is still down or still lagging. Is that true<br />
according to you?<br />
PM: Well it's growing and it's grown moderately well across the year but it's not as<br />
high as we would like it, but again, look at that high profit share recorded today. The<br />
highest level of profits to GDP in the nation's history. As high as the last period of the<br />
late eighties which was higher than any other time since the war. Now that will mean<br />
that business has got the balance sheet into place and it will mean they will be looking<br />
for investment opportunities, and we can see it coming in the expectations data which<br />
we're now recording for private capital investment.<br />
AITON: Well I suppose the question that people will want to know the answer to most<br />
of all is regarding unemployment because I'd know of no family in my immediate social<br />
contact area that has not been afflicted or touched by unemployment. Do you think<br />
these figures actually will give us a direct result there?<br />
PM: Well the link between growth and employment is profound and if you look at any<br />
graphic illustration of it, say from the 1960' s onwards, wherever you see the<br />
employment chart or graph laid over GDP, whenever you get a growth in the economy<br />
you get growth in employment, and we're seeing the same classic illustration of that in<br />
the last year. That is, we've seen the economy pick up, and what have we seen with<br />
it? Two hundred thousand jobs.<br />
AITON: So what are you saying is going to happen?. Can you stick your neck out?<br />
PM: I think we're going to have a fair swag of jobs come out of the rural growth of the<br />
economy and five hundred thousand jobs which I set as an objective at the time of the<br />
last election campaign. One year down a three year path Doug we've got two hundred<br />
thousand in the bag already.<br />
AITON: Yes, true. I did notice, as we all did, in your triumphant election speech of a<br />
year ago, election win speech of a year ago, that you made a point of saying whatever<br />
happens we're going to look after the unemployed. It was a line that affected a lot of<br />
people and it was very well and dramatically put. I wondered at the time, and I still<br />
wonder now even though despite what you've just said, were you foreshadowing that<br />
unemployment is going to become a fact of life in Australia for a long time?<br />
PM: No, because we're hoping that while it will be a fact of life for some time, we're<br />
hoping to deal with the most difficult part of the problem and that is the long-term<br />
unemployed, and the Green Paper which the Government published in November. and<br />
the WhitePaper which vwll be-announcing in late April with the policy changes to deal<br />
with thelong-term unemployed, will be Australia's biggest and most, if -you likevalia-nt<br />
ifi~ tipt todo something interesting, not just in Australian but in world terms, about how<br />
you deal with the problem of three hundred-odd thousand people who have been<br />
unemployed eighteen months or more. So I think that the sense of compassion, the<br />
sense of fair play that resides in the community of this country, will demand that as we<br />
go off now into a long, low inflationary recovery we don't leave an underclass of people<br />
behind forgotten, carrying the burden of the recession, that we actually bring them with<br />
us by making certain that government policy adjusts at getting these people back in the<br />
mainstream of the labour market. </p>
<p>AITON: Do you expect that Australia can return to the 1960' s-type figure of<br />
unemployment which was more or less nil?<br />
PM: No, I don't think so. I don't know what so-called structural unemployment is. You<br />
see, we've got the cycle, that is slower growth which Fai _ ro-cu-ced a pool of<br />
unemployment, and we're now seeing that change with the faster growth. But<br />
underneath that we've got all the changes that come from the redundancies, the<br />
productivity changes, the industrial changes, the tariff changes, the rebuilding, the new<br />
higher-tech industries. That structural change sits under that. If you wash out the<br />
cycle, if you wash the cyclical unemployment out and look at the flux which is always<br />
created by one group leaving one set of industries and another group being trained to<br />
take up another, it's somewhere in that five to six percent area, I think.<br />
AITON: Forever?<br />
PM: Well certainly between now and the sort of intermediate period, certainly between<br />
now and the end of the century.<br />
AITON: If I could move to another matter, l~ m sure you're focussing on the figures<br />
more than anything else today or the economy, but the greatest social problem we<br />
appear to have in the news at the moment is that of Macedonia, and I notice that you<br />
have intervened yourself and attended lunches or-6ea-kfast' -or something with the<br />
Macedonian leaders and what have you. Would you like to state the Government's<br />
point of view on this very troubling matter right now?<br />
PM: Well I said something about it today as a matter of fact but I'm happy to say<br />
something about it to you Doug, on your program, and that is that I think the thing we<br />
pride ourselves on is that down the years this has been a country where old world<br />
hatreds have been mediated and forgotten, and I think this is the way we should<br />
remain. So the principle should be that all those who have made Australia their home<br />
should never forget that their first loyalty is to Australia, and my point is that you can't<br />
be loyal to Australia if you break with the basic traditions of the country, that is, and<br />
these include above all tolerance and non-violence. So old attachments<br />
notwithstanding, acts of violence and engagement in campaigns of hatred I think<br />
constitute an assault on the traditions of Australian democracy and what we as<br />
Australians believe in, and they're not acceptable.<br />
AITON: Alright. Is there going to be further Federal Government intervention on this<br />
matter? PM: Well we've made it clear that what we're looking for is basically, the Government's<br />
made a position of principle, on the basis we've decided to recognise<br />
all other states, a recognition of this state of the former Yugoslav Republic of<br />
Macedonia, and in the argument, if you like, that's bee-n had by groups in this country<br />
wvir~ e saing that Australia's, if you like, unwillingness to accept this state recognising<br />
itself as the republic of Macedonia has in fact, if you like for those associated with the<br />
interests of Greece, brought a recognition, at least temporarily, to this name the former<br />
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. But now the Australians formerly from this state<br />
objecting to the termSlavMacedonian which was introduced by the Government, not<br />
to cause a sense or to make some ehnic statement but simply to describe a fact, that<br />
these people are people from the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. I mean </p>
<p>personally I'd prefer they all call themselves Australians, as I think all people would<br />
prefer to see them called.<br />
AITON: Yes, semantics is always going to get you into trouble though.<br />
PM: The key thing is there are no borders here, there are no borders in this country.<br />
And while it may be an interesting debate for these people to be discussing the<br />
contemporary division of the former ancient state of Macedonia, the whole notion of<br />
pursuing the old hatreds in Australia and the notion that these people have a right to<br />
some sort of violence in our society is, I think, a line we ought to draw without<br />
qualification. AITON: Mr Keating, it's a year now, last weekend, since your unexpected, to most<br />
people, election victory. These figures of course are the sorts of things that you<br />
would've hoped would happen a year after that, the figures today. But is there any<br />
particular matter where you are disappointed that you have not been able to achieve<br />
what you would have liked to in a year?<br />
PM: The mandate I set down was to re-start the economy, get it growing strongly<br />
again, see the recovery bloom, get employment running strongly again, deal with<br />
Mabo, the High Court decision, focus on APEC, that is build structures for Australia in<br />
Asia, and deal with the long-term unemployed. And I think I can give a tick to most of<br />
those things. That is, I can say honestly Doug, to you, the answer to that question, we<br />
have got the economy growing again, we have got two hundred thousand jobs, we<br />
have legislated for Mabo, an historic piece of property in cultural law, we have put<br />
APEC into place and it's growing and changing, and we are now working on the White<br />
Paper and long-term unemployment, and of course we're seeing low inflation right the<br />
way through it. So in terms of the mandate, can I just say our opponents, Dr Hewson<br />
said we'd be in a double-dip recession, they had the ads with the gun sights taking<br />
people out of employment, not putting people back into it. All of that's proven to be<br />
untrue, that Australia wasn't going to go into a double-dip recession, that we weren't<br />
going to see more Australians unemployed but in fact fewer unemployed and more<br />
employed, and a year down the track I think the Government's been true to its mandate<br />
and true to its promises.<br />
AITON: Do you feel embarrassed about the Ros Kelly business?<br />
PM: No, that's part of the sort of sideshows of public life. But you see one of the<br />
things that today's national accounts, there's a growth of consumer sentiment and retail<br />
sales which came from the tax cuts of last year. You never hear about them now<br />
Doug. Eight to ten dollars a week for people, a promise the Government made and<br />
kept, and we had to battle it through the Senate, against the Liberal Party and the<br />
National Party and the Greens and the Democrats and everybody else for the right to<br />
pay people a tax cut which the economy needed to kick itself along.<br />
AITON: I notice that you're coming up further ahead of Dr Hewson as preferred leader<br />
in recent polls. I know you have a certain amount of contempt for polls but<br />
nevertheless we have only them to go by. It seems to me that you might actually like<br />
Dr Hewson to stay there as leader because it makes you feel secure.<br />
PM: Well Doug, when we get that tricky, any of us in public lifethat we're into the<br />
business of choosing our opponents' leadership, that's the time to call it quits I think. I </p>
<p>just think from the point of view of the parliamentary leader of the parliamentary Labor<br />
Party, as we are in office, therefore Prime Minister, I take the view that whoever the<br />
Coalition propose as their leader is the person I have to deal with in policy terms. Now<br />
the Liberals last time in a highly ideological election. they wanted to make a big tax<br />
grab through the GST and essentially funnel the money to the high paid, despite the<br />
fact that the profit share was rising as it has indicated today the highest level ever in our<br />
post-war history, and the public said hang on, this is too greedy, we're not being in this,<br />
we're not going to see you knock Medicare out, we're not going to see you knock the<br />
social wage around and we're not going to let people go onto individual wage contracts,<br />
we don't want a GST, we do want a more inclusive society, we do care about the<br />
unemployed, we do care about our community, we do care about aboriginal Australians<br />
and we want something better. So I mean we were at the time putting what I call the<br />
policies of enlargement out against the sort of straightners and the punishers, that their<br />
view being we can only succeed if we've got our head bowed, our eyes down and<br />
wearing a penalty. This society deserves better and can have better.<br />
AITON: This is a very funny day for you with those figures which are hard for the<br />
Opposition to dispute in any way or to mock. What's been your darkest moment<br />
though over the last twelve months since that triumph of the election.<br />
PM: I must say, I'm happy to say I haven't had many dark moments, and the growth<br />
today came out of the One Nation package of 1992. 1 mean what restarted the<br />
economy? What started those ten consecutive quarters of growth you mentioned<br />
earlier? And the answer was the One Nation spending which Dr Hewson said would<br />
bankrupt the country. So this wasn't put there by accident or good fortune. It was put<br />
there by express government policy and so I haven't had many, can I say, dark days<br />
since. I mean if there was any frustrating, it was the Budget process of last year, that<br />
was frustrating. As you know, I don't believe minor parties should hold the money, the<br />
financial policies of the Government in the House of Representatives to ransom. That<br />
was a trying period but we got through that, we got the tax cuts paid and the<br />
economy's growing as a consequence.<br />
AITON: You told SBS television in an interview recently that when the time comes to<br />
go you won't have to be told, you'll be gone. But where will you go?<br />
PM: Oh where do any of us go? I mean former Prime Ministers are generally a pretty<br />
sad bunch and I suppose I'll end up like the rest of them somewhere along the way but<br />
not quite yet.<br />
AITON: Good to talk to you and thanks for your time today.<br />
PM: Okay Doug, nice to speak to you.<br />
ends. </p>
