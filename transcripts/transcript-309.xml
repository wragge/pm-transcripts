COSTS OF TEACHING HOSPITALS<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon. R. G. Menzies<br />
The Prime Minister announced today that he had appointed<br />
a committee to inquire into the costs incurred by teaching<br />
hospitals which are directly attributable to the instruction of<br />
medical students, and to submit for the consideration of the<br />
Australian Universities Commission recommendations on the magnitude<br />
and urgency of Commonwealth assistance for these hospitals<br />
which would be appropriate to those special costs.<br />
Sir Leslie Martin Chairman of the Australian Universities Commission<br />
will be Chairman of this Committee. Its other members<br />
will be:-<br />
Dr'. V. L. Collins, Medical Director, Royal Children's Hospital,<br />
elourne, and Professor-elect of Child Health, University of<br />
Melbourne; Professor D. P. Derham. Professor of Jurisprudence,<br />
University of Melbourne, memberf of the Board of Management, Royal<br />
Melbourne Hospital, and member, Faculty of Medicine, University<br />
of Melbourne;<br />
Mr J. Griffith, O. BOE., Administrator, Royal Perth Hospital;<br />
Mr. L. B1. Hamilton, First Assistant Secretary, Socia-l Serviced'<br />
Division of the Commonwealth Treasury;<br />
Professor J. Hayden, Professor of Medicine, University<br />
of Melbourne, and President of the Royal Australasian College of<br />
Physicians;<br />
Mr. P. Kenny, Honorary Surgeon, St. Vincent's Hospita, Sydney,<br />
and Councillor, Royal Australasian College of Surgeons;<br />
Mr. A. H. Lendon, Honorary Surgeon, Royal Adelaide Hospital, and<br />
Councillor, Royal Australasian Council of Surgeons;<br />
Dr. J. Lindell, Chairman, Hospitals and Charities Commission of<br />
Victoria, and previously Medical Superintendent of the Royal<br />
Melbourne Hospital;<br />
Dr. G. A. Penington, Dean of the Royal Melbourne Hospital Clinical<br />
School; Sir Helbert Schlink, Chairman of the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital,<br />
Sydney, and President of the Australian Hospitals' Association;<br />
Professor S. Sunderland, Dean of the Faculty of Medicine, University<br />
of Melbourne; and<br />
Prof'essor N. G. Sutton, Dean of the Faculty of Medicine, University<br />
of Queensland. It will be seen that this membership is drawn from all<br />
States with teaching hospitals, and includes men experienced in<br />
hospital administration, others who have a close acquaintance<br />
with the inter-relation betwoen universities and hospitals in<br />
the field of clinical teaching, and others with particular knowledge<br />
of the leg.,. al and financial implications of the subject of<br />
the inquiry. </p>
<p>2,<br />
The Prime Minister said that earlier in the year he<br />
had been asked by the Health Ministers of the States to set up<br />
such a committee, and that he had a.' reed to do so but had delayed<br />
taking action until the Australian Universities Commission<br />
was established and its views know-n. Indeed, the Committee has<br />
been established in accordance with the terms of the Australian<br />
Universities Commission Act, . ijhich provides for the ; c. ppointment<br />
of Committees to advise the Commission on specific problems. At<br />
present, Mr. Menzies commented, the Commoniealth does not contribute<br />
to the costs incurred by the teaching hospitals as a<br />
direct result of the training given in them to medical students,<br />
although, through the Australian Universities Commission, it<br />
does assist the States to meet the cost of other aspects of<br />
medical teaching. The Prime Minister stated that he appreciated that this<br />
matter is one of some urgency. Nevertheless, because the<br />
Commission is at present fully occupied in assessing the needs of<br />
Australian universities in the period 1961-63, it will not be<br />
practicable for the committee on the tead-ing hospitals to begin<br />
its investigations until the early montlas of next year.<br />
