D) IPOMATIC REIlATIONS WITH THE VATICAN<br />
~ The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Whitlam,<br />
announced today that Australia and the Holy See had agreed<br />
to enter into diplomatic relations and agreed to the following<br />
joint communique: " Australia and the Holy See, wishing to promote<br />
mutual friendly relations, have decided to exchange diplomatic<br />
representation, with the rank of Embassy on the part of<br />
ustralia, and of Apostolic Nunciature on the part of the<br />
Holy See." Mr Whitlam said the names of the respective Heads of<br />
Mission would be announced shortly, adding that the Australian<br />
Ambassador to the Holy See would be arccredited on a nonresident<br />
basis. Mr Whitlam noted that Australia had become one of<br />
over 70 countries, of which 12 were members of the Conmonwealth,<br />
which maintained diplomatic relations with the Holy See. In so / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
doing, it joined ten of the most influential and populous of<br />
its Asian neighbours, including Indonesia, India, Japan, Pakistan<br />
and Thailand. The Holy See maintains resident diplomatic<br />
representation in over 60 countries at the level of Nuncio or<br />
Pro-Nuncio ( equivalent to Ambassador), as well as having<br />
Observer status to some 12 international organisations, including<br />
the United Nations, the European Communities, and a number of the<br />
Specialised Agencies of the United Nations.<br />
Mr Whitlam said he expected that the Apostolic<br />
Delegation in Sydney would, in due course, become an Apostolic<br />
Nunciature in Canberra.<br />
The Minister said he had taken careful note of views<br />
put to him by individuals and organisations before a decision<br />
on this question had been made. He emnhasised that the step<br />
was one of several actions which the Government had taken to<br />
normalise its relations with other States and should be seen in<br />
this secular light. The nature of any exchanges between the<br />
two States would be that of normal diplomacy and would in no<br />
way provide privileged access by the Catholic Church to the<br />
Australian Government.<br />
