TRANSCRIPT OF A JOINT NEWS CONFERENCE BY THE PRIM( E MINISTER OF AUSTRALIA AND<br />
THlE CANADIAN EXTERNAL AFFAIRS MINISTER, MR JOE CLARK, PWTC KUALA LUMPUR,_<br />
19 OCTOBER 1989<br />
PM: At the outset, let me pay tribute to the work of the Committee of Foreign<br />
Ministers on Southern Africa chaired by Joe Clark of Canada established at the<br />
last meeting of Commonwealth Heads of Government in Vancouver and the input<br />
that they have made during that period has been very significant for us in<br />
coming to the consideration of this matter at this meeting of the Commonwealth<br />
Heads of Government.<br />
The meeting has today considered the issue of South Africa and what we'ye<br />
attempted to do is to consider that matter in the light of what we see as the<br />
relevant developments since we last met. If I can put those briefly, those<br />
developments are firstly, and most importantly, that the fundamentals of<br />
apartheid in South Africa remain firmly in place. Institutional<br />
discrimination, personified most particularly by the Group Areas Act, the<br />
extremes of economic injustice and the state of emergency now in its fourth<br />
year; and against that we observed that it would be churlish not to observe<br />
that there have been some recent changes the reference by President De Klerk<br />
about talk of reform, whereas up until the recent election there had been<br />
horrifying and brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations. In very recent<br />
times some mass demonstrations have been allowed to pass without incident and<br />
of course the recent release of Walter Sisulu and seven other black leaders<br />
and most recently there has been reference by the Constitutional Development<br />
and Planning Minister of talks about talks, as he puts it, with ANC leaders.<br />
It's in that context that we approached this matter and it was in that context<br />
that in leading the discussion with my good friend Kenneth Kaunda, I developed<br />
the five point proposal for what I believe should be the next steps to be<br />
taken by the Commonwealth. I'd like briefly to go to those then ask Joe to<br />
speak and then we can go to the questions.<br />
The five steps that I suggested should be taken by the Commonwealth are these<br />
firstly, there should be a strong expression of support for the principles<br />
and approach in negotiating framework as outlined in the Harare Declaration.<br />
Secondly, there should be a maintenance, without relaxation, of existing<br />
sanctions. Thirdly, there should be a development of new forms of financial pressure on<br />
South Africa, that is by seeking to intensify and extend the financial<br />
sanctions in particular in two ways: by calling on all relevant banks and<br />
financial institutions to impose tougher conditions on day-to-day trade<br />
financing, in particular, through reducing the maximum credit terms to<br />
days; and also secondly, to call on relevant Governments to make trade </p>
<p>credits harder to get by taking South Africa off cover with official<br />
Government agencies for official trade government credit and insurance<br />
purposes and that these positions should be embodied in a letter which should<br />
be signed by the Chairman of the meeting and conveyed to all relevant banks<br />
and financial institutions and governments and delivered as soon as possible.<br />
If you like, within that third step, you could see that as the hard side of<br />
it. If you could look at the other part as being the soft side there is some<br />
indication that the IMF may be prepared to comtemplate the development of a<br />
major financial package which would be of relevance to the development of a<br />
new South Africa and that we could seek a discussion on the possibility of the<br />
development of such an IMF package which would be contingent upon the<br />
implementation of fundamental structural political reform calculated to lead<br />
to the ending of apartheid.<br />
The fourth step was to establish within a major research institution a unit of<br />
specialist staff which should monitor and review and report upon South<br />
Afrfca's links with the international financial community and report on the<br />
impact of financial sanctions<br />
And fifthly, that we should re-establish Joe Clark's committee, the Committee<br />
of Foreign Ministers under his very able and effective chairmanship and to reestablish<br />
that as an ongoing review mechanism to monitor developments and to<br />
report with appropriate recommendations to the Commonwealth Heads of<br />
Government. Now essentially, I have seen that as the next series of. steps that the current<br />
situation demands of the Commonwealth. We believe it's a balanced approach<br />
which recognises the continuing fundamental and objectionable realities of<br />
apartheid in South Africa. It attempts to do what I've consistently said at<br />
successive CHOGMS and which has been the position of the Commonwealth. I<br />
repeated to the meeting today that we have never seen any purpose in sanctions<br />
as such, that sanctions as I put it have been calculated not to bring South<br />
Africa to its knees, but to the negotiating table. We have the position as<br />
you know that we don't have to engage in our own intellectual processes and<br />
sequential reasoning to come to the conclusion that sanctions have been<br />
effective. We can rely on the words that came out of the mouths of the<br />
Finance minister in South Africa and the late Governor of the Reserve Bank,<br />
where they've said two things: That the sanctions have been cripplingly<br />
effective, and that South Africa can only expect to escape from that<br />
situation by appropriate political reform and so we are saying we. welcome the<br />
indications of change but they haven't yet altered the fundamentals. We hope<br />
that there will be a move now to the negotiating table. There are things that<br />
the government can do there immediately without waiting for parliament to<br />
assemble. Those things obviously include release of all political prisoners,<br />
the unbanning of organisations, a commitment to no further executions for<br />
political of fences. Those things can be done and then we believe we can move<br />
into the second phase which is the legislative phase. The third phase then of<br />
course is substantial negotiation leading to the new South Africa.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, as briefly as I think is appropriate and responsible,<br />
I've attempted to give you the background of our thinking and the steps, which<br />
I may say, have been supported by every speaker in the discussions, bar one<br />
Joe. </p>
<p>3<br />
CLARK: Thanks Prime Minister, I presented this morning, really early this<br />
afternoon, the report of the Commonwealth Committee of Foreign Ministers on<br />
Southern Africa. That has been made public both I think, in the various<br />
communiques issued in our meetings since we were established at CHOGM and also<br />
the remarks that I made in presenting it were made public. That committee as<br />
you may recall was intended to end at this CHOGM. As a result of the<br />
suggestion of the Prime Minister of Australia there was a request that we<br />
continue our work. That has been agreed and we will be continuing our work at<br />
least until the next CHOGM. In summary I think it is fair to say that the<br />
Heads of Government this morning noted the promise of reform from South<br />
African leaders, want that promise kept and intend to maintain the kind of<br />
pressure that has been proven to be effective in causing that promise to be<br />
made. A major part of the work of the committee that I chair will be to<br />
determine means by which we can maintain that kind of pressure and come to<br />
some assessment of the degree to which the Government of South Africa is<br />
acting on its promises to begin fundamental reform in the apartheid system.<br />
This committee began at Vancouver with the responsibility to try to do some<br />
drafting of a statement that could commend itself to Heads of Government. We<br />
have been asked to do that again. At Vancouver, in the confines of the CHOGM<br />
itself, the United Kingdom was a member of the committee that drafted a<br />
communique to be considered by Heads of Government and the United Kingdom has<br />
agreed again that John Major, their Foreign Secretary, will be a member of the<br />
committee for the purposes of drafting recommendations that can be considered<br />
at the CHOGM.<br />
I ' would be naturally pleased to deal with questions that you might have<br />
respecting the work of the committee. Let me just say one thing that perhaps<br />
bends one of the rules of the CHOGH meeting. One is not supposed to make<br />
reference to the comments that are made by others, but I think it worth<br />
underlining a comment that was made by President Kaunda this morning, when he<br />
made the point, and I think I am quoting him precisely, that to have Bob Hawke<br />
and Brian Mulroney standing with black leaders of the Commonwealth on the<br />
question of apartheid has, in Kenneth Kaunda's words, meant everything. It<br />
has demonstrated, he said, to Afrikaaners that there need not be racism, that<br />
there should not be racism. I thought that that was appropriate to<br />
communicate to people interested in this issue outside the Heads of Government<br />
Meeting because one of the characteristics of the Commonwealth is that people<br />
from different continents and different conditions have been drawn together to<br />
fight this evil system and together we have been able to make some<br />
considerable progress.<br />
CLARK: ( In French our translation) If there are any questions in French<br />
the Australian Prime Minister will respond in French.<br />
PM: Merci, monsieur<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, where will this proposal go, when, will it be discussed<br />
and what do you expect to happen?<br />
PM: Well, the formal discussion within the Commonwealth Heads of Government<br />
meeting has now concluded. The Committee of Foreign Ministers that Joe has<br />
just referred to will consider this issue and they will prepare drafts for<br />
consideration, which process will commence at the retreat I imagine, and then<br />
there will be an attempt to get a consensus: whether that is possible or not, </p>
<p>I.<br />
an absolute consensus, we don't know yet. We will certainly try and do it and<br />
then out of the retreat where those things will be considered, we'll have a<br />
final communique which will entail the decision of the Commonwealth Heads of<br />
Government. So that is the process ahead of us now, but may I say that on the<br />
discussion that has taken place after Kenneth Kaunda and I introduced this<br />
subject, there were contributions from seven Heads of Government in support of<br />
the five proposals; there was one who wasn't in support and as far as we can<br />
see, there is virtually total support for the proposal.<br />
JOURNALIST: Can I ask what is the status of your five proposals because the<br />
British side are saying that they are not aware that they have any and, can I<br />
also ask, why as I understand it you did not mention them at the hour long<br />
session with Mrs Thatcher this morning?<br />
Pm: Oh, I see, well perhaps the amplification isn't too good because I have<br />
already answered that question here, but for your benefit, I'll answer it<br />
again I have said that the status is that we have had the discussion now at<br />
the Heads of Government Meeting today and what is now their status is that<br />
they will constitute the major basis of consideration by the Committee of<br />
Foreign ministers which includes the Foreign Ministers of Britain and Malaysia<br />
in addition to the other Foreign Ministers on the Committee and those<br />
countries as I recall, correct me if I'm wrong Joe, are Canada, Guyana,<br />
Australia, India, Nigeria, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe.<br />
CLARK: Bingo.<br />
PM: Bingo, so we'll have in addition to those, now Malaysia and Britain.<br />
They will consider these proposals coming out of the discussion today and as<br />
everyone else at least heard me say, if you didn't, then that will be put in<br />
the form of a draft that will be considered by the Heads of Government<br />
initially, I believe, at the retreat and perhaps finally when we get back here<br />
and then you will get to the decision by the Commonwealth. Now, you asked me<br />
why I didn't put the specific proposals in my meeting with Mrs Thatcher this<br />
morning. I did discuss the question of South Africa generally with her and<br />
indicated what was no surprise to her that we wouldn't be ad idem on this<br />
issue and we each, if not joyfully, as a matter of fact accepted that to be<br />
the position and went on to discuss other matters.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible in French)<br />
CLARK ( In French our translation): The Australian Prime minister today<br />
proposed certain steps which will be considered by the Committee of Ministers<br />
during the following days in order to maintain the pressure of the<br />
Commonwealth with regard to South Africa, in particular in the economic<br />
domain. As far as the loans are concerned, and the decision which was<br />
announced today by the Bank of South Africa, I have several things to say:<br />
firstly it is natural that we are disappointed that such an accord was<br />
reached, we are disappointed that it wasn't possible for us to retard the<br />
decision but on the other hand, it is important to note that there is a heavy<br />
burden which must be assumed by the Government of South Africa in the terms of<br />
the accord with the banks, a burden which exists because apartheid exists. It<br />
is another cost of apartheid. The second thing is that I believe that the<br />
reaction of South Africa with regard to the loans demonstrates two things,<br />
firstly the importance of the Commonwealth as Prime Minister Mulroney said </p>
<p>yesterday, there was a period recently when the South African Government<br />
ignored, or tried to ignore the Commonwealth, which is no longer possible now;<br />
they have planned their declaration to coincide with the current Heads of<br />
Government Meeting and the second thing is that I believe that the decision<br />
indicates the sense of vulnerability of the South African Government<br />
concerning economic pressure.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you want the Commonwealth to set a deadline for reforms in<br />
South Africa, and secondly if you do, what action will you take if the reforms<br />
are not implemented within that time scale?<br />
PM: I think it wouldn't be a fair description of either what I've said or<br />
what I sense to be the reception of my position by the Commonwealth that we<br />
have sought to set a precise deadline; but what I have suggested, which goes<br />
to questions of timetable is that in recommending the re-establishment of the<br />
Committee of Foreign Ministers I suggested that it would probably be<br />
appropriate that they should meet next in approximately March or April of next<br />
year. I said that because it seemed to me that by then, which would be some<br />
six months after the election of the De Klerk Government, that that would be<br />
time to see whether there was an intention to do those things which were<br />
capable of being done by executive decision.<br />
Let me repeat the major examples of those things that can be done by executive<br />
decision. You can have by executive decision, and without the parliament<br />
meeting, the release of political prisoners. You can have by executive<br />
decision, the unbanning of organisations, representative organisations, and<br />
you can have by executive decision, without the meeting of parliament, a<br />
commitment to an end to executions for political ( in inverted commas) crimes.<br />
Now it seemed to me and, as I sense it, my colleagues around the Heads of<br />
Government table agreed with this that that sort of timing of meeting of the<br />
Committee of Foreign Ministers made sense and that within that time those<br />
sorts of things could be done. I said the second phase because I referred to<br />
three phases that we would be looking at. That is the executive decisions;<br />
secondly the beginning of the legislative program of dismantling the<br />
fundamental pillars of apartheid. Also one would think that by something like<br />
April of next year one would have been able to ascertain some indication of<br />
legislative intention to act in those regards. Now because it seemed to us<br />
not appropriate to be absolutely specific about exactly how much reaction we<br />
want in that time because we want to be as reasonable in these things as we<br />
can. If we put it in those terms to indicate the sorts of areas in which we<br />
believe we could see executive action to give a broad indication of time when<br />
we thought the ministers would be meeting, that in that sense it is<br />
appropriate both in terms of the pressures that are being applied externally<br />
and within South Africa and in terms of response by the regime in South<br />
Africa. So we are hopeful that in that sort of time period enough would be<br />
done for the Committee of Foreign Ministers to be able to report to the heads<br />
of Government that there are positive responses. I concluded my remarks to my<br />
colleagues by saying that I wanted to have a positive sort of note and said<br />
that if indeed there are positive responses judged to be sufficient in their<br />
dimension, then we should be thinking in those circumstances about the<br />
relaxation of pressures, but that it was now premature to signify actual<br />
trigger points; and that was therefore why I had as part of my proposal, which<br />
as-I say, seemed to recommend themselves to my colleagues that we would ask </p>
<p>-06-<br />
the Committee of Foreign Ministers to accept that responsibility of assessing<br />
reaction. JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: Well I've learned in a fairly long period in political life not to get<br />
too carried away with hypotheses because I've never found prancing down<br />
hypothetical paths terribly rewarding. In that sense I would rather say this,<br />
that in fairness to the elements within the regime in South Africa who have<br />
given some indications of change, as I said, I would rather say it is my hope<br />
that they would see the essentially constructive approach that the<br />
Commonwealth is talking about and that within that framework there will be<br />
positive responses and so I don't go to the hypothetical situation that they<br />
won't be.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Clark, you have been reported as saying that the rescheduling<br />
deal . for South Africa ( was) a pretty tough one. Is that true? Is this the<br />
sort of toughness you want the Commonwealth to impose on South Africa?<br />
CLARK: Well, two or three things about the rescheduling deal. First of all,<br />
we regret that there has been a multiple-year rescheduling. We had been<br />
targeting for single year rescheduling and we regret that it happened this<br />
early. we had hoped that we would be able to push that back. Those things<br />
didn't happen. But there are two very important elements of this deal. One<br />
is that there is an obligation on the part of South Africa to pay back a<br />
billion and a half dollars in three and a half years. That is a very heavy<br />
burden. It's a burden that would not be there if the apartheid regime were<br />
not in place. It's another cost of apartheid. The other thing that we find<br />
very interesting is that it's obvious that this announcement was timed to<br />
coincide with the opening of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting.<br />
our conversations after the announcement with some of the banks involved,<br />
indicate that the discussions occurred a couple, of weeks ago. The banks were<br />
advised I am told yesterday morning that the announcement would be made<br />
yesterday night. That indicates two things. One, that the Commonwealth<br />
clearly has a continuing and important influence upon the decisions that the<br />
south African Government takes, and the second is that the South African<br />
Government is very sensitive to its vulnerability on the question of financial<br />
links. That is one of the reasons that Canada welcomed the additional<br />
proposals that were made by Prime Minister Hawke this morning and why we think<br />
it will be helpful for consideration to be given to putting in place an<br />
informal monitoring agency that can keep track in an objective way of South<br />
Africa's financial relations.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, given that the banks have agreed to the much<br />
quicker rescheduling than you hoped and more favourable terms is it likely<br />
that they will agree to the kind of trade financial restrictions that you are<br />
now proposing.<br />
PM: Well, by definition, I can't give a definitive answer to that. I can't<br />
answer for the banks, but let me in terms of providing the proper context, for<br />
consideration of your question, make some additional points about the decision<br />
that has been unilaterally announced by the regime in South Africa. Certain<br />
of the facts., I think, need to be properly understood. The Reserve Bank of<br />
South Africa-statement affects just 20.5% of the debt inside the net as it's </p>
<p>7-<br />
called, the standstill net. In other words, there is still 80% of<br />
billion remaining within the standstill net on which pressure could still be<br />
applied and from our indications from our embassy in Pretoria we're told it<br />
was fairly widely expected in international circles that the amount<br />
rescheduled could have been greater. It's worth noting this, that within the<br />
first six months of next year, 1990, there will be $ 2 billion outside the<br />
standstill net which will be due for payment prior to the end of June 1990.<br />
That's not affected by today's announcement, and there is no suggestion at all<br />
even by the authorities in South Africa that the situation is other than that<br />
severe costs are still being imposed upon South Africa by the international<br />
financial community. In other words it can't in any realistic sense be seen<br />
as any easing up of the pressure on South Africa. It demands repayment of as<br />
much principle, of overdue principle as was demanded in the second<br />
rescheduling, and at the same effective rate. It's important to understand<br />
that it still leaves South Africa isolated from any new loans and are forced<br />
in those circumstances to run a current account surplus to repay their<br />
commitments under the agreement. Now as Joe has frankly said, we wish the<br />
decision hadn't been made so soon and that instead of the multi-year<br />
situation, it could have been an annual pressure on South Africa; but one<br />
should also note, I might say, if you're going to get some understanding of<br />
the context of this that there's a hump in bond repayments occurring; tha t's<br />
for bonds that were raised before 1985, there is a hump in the repayment of<br />
those bonds which are now starting to move to maturity and as I am informed,<br />
there will be nearly $ 2 billion of that occurring in the next two years and<br />
that compares with an amount of $ 400 million in the last 12 months. So I<br />
suggest that if we're going to take your question about what other<br />
possibilities there are in terms of what I put to the Commonwealth Heads of<br />
Government Meeting, we shouldn't be understanding the position that now exists<br />
as one of other than very severe stringency for South Africa. Now I believe<br />
that in that context there is some possibility that there will be positive<br />
responses to our suggestions for further financial pressure. It's not as<br />
though the international financial community has said in the situation with<br />
which they're confronted Oh we're so satisfied. with these small moves that<br />
have been made by the new government in South Africa that we're just going to<br />
remove the constraints they haven't done that and so I hope that there will,<br />
in that context, be the sort of positive response to these initiatives that<br />
we're asking them to take.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister To what extent do you believe that a clear<br />
signal from Britain that it didn't support the financial sanctions was a<br />
signal to the banks to come some of the way to relieving the burden on South<br />
Africa. PM: Well I simply can't make a judgement about that. I guess the only<br />
intelligent thing that one can say in those circumstances is that if the<br />
positions of Government were going to have any impact at all, then a<br />
relatively benign attitude by the Government of the United Kingdom must have<br />
been advantageous to South Africa rather than not. That's the sort of<br />
intelligent assessment one could make, but I can't assert it as a fact.<br />
JOURNALIST: Can I ask a question on Hong Kong affairs? Mrs Thatcher has<br />
already said that the Beijing has already destroyed the confidence of Hong<br />
Kong people.. What do you think the Commonwealth and all the Commonwealth<br />
countries and your two countries can do to give help to the Hong Kong people? </p>
<p>PM: Well I would think that there may be some more discussion about that<br />
particular issue in the retreat. When the Heads of Government yesterday<br />
discussed the world political situation there was reference to developments in<br />
China and Hong Kong. I would think that there would be some more discussion<br />
about that at the retreat and there will be some reference to it in the<br />
communique. As to what my Government can do and Joe, of course, can speak for<br />
his, I think the sorts of things that we have got to try to do is to give<br />
confidence to the people of Hong Kong that we understand the apprehension that<br />
they feel in the light of the developments since 4 June. That is a perfectly<br />
understandable apprehension. They were prior to 4 June faced with a position<br />
where they thought that understandings had been reached. Not merely formal<br />
understandings out of the negotiations between the Governments of the Uni. ted<br />
Kingdom and the Peoples Republic of China but more importantly in a sense the<br />
actual formal arrangements that had been made, a sense of confidence that<br />
their interests were well understood and were going to be properly protected.<br />
one can understand the apprehension that has arisen since then. So these are<br />
the things that we ought to be doing. One, to make it quite clear to the<br />
Government of the Peoples' Republic of China that what happened on, leading up<br />
to, and subsequent to 4 June is not acceptable and will continue to be<br />
repudiated. Secondly, and this is a task of delicate government if you like.<br />
At the same as those things are made clear, also it doesn't make sense in the<br />
interests of the people of China or of the people of Hong Kong to say that we<br />
are going to cut off contact with China. We need to maintain contact<br />
particularly in ways which will enable contact into the people of China so<br />
that some confidence can be given to them that there is an alternative way<br />
further in the future than the repressive actions that have been taken in<br />
June and which have been continued since. So that is as far as China is<br />
concerned. If we can get an understanding in China of the unacceptability of<br />
the sort of action that occurred then and that the capacity of China to reap<br />
the benefit of economic cooperation with the rest of the world is not<br />
unrelated to the way in which they behave in regard to the people of China and<br />
of Hong Kong then that is important to the people of Hong Kong if that<br />
position can be established. Now as far as Hong Kong itself is concerned both<br />
Canada and ourselves have significant immigration programs, and speaking for<br />
myself, I can say to you that in the last year we took from Hong Kong just<br />
under 10 000, I think it was 9760 people from Hong Kong and just over a third<br />
of those something over 3000, came into the business migration program<br />
category. So we have in our case, as I think Canada, does of being open to<br />
immigration from Hong Kong and I would say that we will continue-to have an<br />
immigration program in which there will be a place for people from Hong Kong<br />
and if a situation occurred which I hope will not, where there was some<br />
disastrous development-in terms of the relationship between China and Hong<br />
Kong, then on our past record I guess it could be expected that we would take<br />
account of those circumstances.<br />
CLARK: our position is roughly the same as that of Aust * ralia. our emphasis<br />
with respect to Hong Kong, as I had a chance to review it with some<br />
journalists a couple of nights ago is precisely on trying to build up the<br />
sense of confidence of the people that the conditions anticipated in Hong Kong<br />
when the agreement was signed and the conditions prevailing prior to the<br />
events in Tiananmen Square would continue. : 3 </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: To return to loans, as we understand it, South Africa has now<br />
repaid<br />
CLARK: What newspaper are you with Abdul?<br />
JOURNALIST: Anti-Apartheid News, London. As we understand it, with the<br />
rescheduling of the loans, South Africa is not in default and therefore with a<br />
release possibly of another political prisoner it can go on the open market<br />
for new loans. I wonder if Prime Minister, with your five points if you could<br />
add the appeal to the international financial markets not to grant any new<br />
loans to South Africa because that would obviously be one way to repay all the<br />
other debts to these nations.<br />
PM: Well that's clearly our position, that we are advocating no new loans, it<br />
has been consistently the position.<br />
JOURNALIST: But the British Government doesn't support it, so if you could<br />
add it, that would be a test as to whether they would make this appeal to the<br />
international monetary market.<br />
PM: A test for whom?<br />
JOURNALIST: A test for the United Kingdom which is a member of the<br />
Commonwealth as well.<br />
PM: Well, I mean I'm not here to speak for the United Kingdom. That is<br />
something that I don't wish to do and I'm certain that as far as Mrs Thatcher<br />
is concerned nor does she wish me to. All I can say is that it is the<br />
intention of myself and all others who have spoken to have a position in<br />
which, by communication to all relevant banks and financial institutions and<br />
government agencies it will be made explicit what our position is which<br />
includes no new loans. Now that will be made clear by letter and I have<br />
expressed the hope that the Chairman of the meeting will be able to express<br />
that view on behalf of all governments. Now I've had cause to say before that<br />
I tend to have a bet occasionally, I wouldn't like to bet strongly on the<br />
outcome of him being able to speak for every single member.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, in September the Committee of Experts from your country,<br />
Canada and India reported that they had met 12 or 14 banks and the banks, to<br />
quote Mr Clark, agreed that they would be seeking the highest possible<br />
interest payments and the fastest possible repayment of capital. -In the light<br />
of the banks' failure to do that with the 20%, did the heads of government<br />
talk about how to induce or otherwise encourage the banks to come closer to<br />
the promises they're making?<br />
PM: Well there'll obviously be some further discussion on this issue at the<br />
retreat but in the proposal I've put, the outline there of course is that we<br />
should actually now communicate directly with every one of the relevant banks<br />
and financial agencies. Now whether in fact that actual letter may be<br />
followed up in other ways by personal representations being made by a person<br />
or persons on behalf of the Commonwealth is a matter which has yet to be<br />
discussed and decided.<br />
JOURNALIST: That sounds like sending a letter Mr Hawke could you be more<br />
serious? </p>
<p>10<br />
PM: Well would you like us to send in the Navy, the Army or the Air Force?<br />
Now, let's be realistic. What we have done is something which has produced<br />
very significant results and so in case you have any doubts about that, as<br />
though we're just passing pious resolutions without any results, let me just<br />
do some quotes to you which are additional to the very effective quotes that<br />
were made here by my f riend Brian Mulroney yesterday. These were a couple of<br />
quotes that I made to my colleagues today. I read first of all from the<br />
Ovenden/ Tony Cole book, page 182: As recently as the 23rd of May this year<br />
the South African Minister for Finance admitted to an audience composed of<br />
representatives of the South African Federation of industry that South Africa<br />
had been operating abroad on a cash basis for 16 consecutive quarters and that<br />
he wondered whether any business enterprise could have existed in a similar<br />
way. He also revealed that South Africa had been close to closing its foreign<br />
exchanges in December 1988 and it might have to take this course of action in<br />
June 1989. He concluded by appealing to business to hang on " until we get our<br />
politics right".<br />
Further quotes from the late Governor of the Reserve Bank Gerhard de Koek on<br />
the 9th May in which he acknowledged in a public speech that international<br />
pressures, particularly financial pressures, had crippled South Africa's<br />
ability to deliver sustained economic growth. A trend, he said, which could<br />
not be reversed, this had crippled their economic growth, which could not be<br />
reversed without " adequate progress in the field of political and<br />
constitutional reform". So the rather slick, if I may put it to without<br />
offence to you I hope, the slick assumption that all that is involved is<br />
writing letters in what we're doing in the area of pressure is simply not<br />
brought out by the facts. These are not my statements. They are not Joe<br />
Clark's statements. These are the statements of the South African Minister of<br />
Finance and of the late Governor of the Reserve Bank. That is, that the<br />
financial pressures, not just the writing of letters, but the financial<br />
pressures, have brought about two things the crippling effect upon the South<br />
African economy and more importantly, secondly,-that in those circumstances<br />
that they understood the only way they were going to escape from those<br />
pressures was by political reform. So the easy way of saying you're going to<br />
do more than writing letters is simply not brought out by the facts. What has<br />
happened has brought about those results and there is no reason to believe<br />
that if the rest of the Commonwealth continues to show the determination and<br />
imagination that it has to this point, that we can't continue and increase<br />
those results.<br />
