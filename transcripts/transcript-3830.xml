VIETNAMESE REFUGEES<br />
The Australian Government has decided to initiate<br />
a special longitudinal survey of Vietnamese refugees who had<br />
recently settled in Australia, the Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam<br />
announced tonight. The study will be carried out by Dr Jean Martin of<br />
the Australian National University. Dr Martin and her associates<br />
will interview the refugees at regular intervals over a period<br />
of about five years.<br />
The survey would concentrate on those who had neither<br />
relatives nor friends here. It would record fully their experiences<br />
in making new lives in Australia.<br />
Mr Whitlam said that if there had been Government<br />
follow-up studies of earlier refugee groups who had made their<br />
0 homes in Australia, the task of selecting refugees now would be<br />
easier. Mr Whitlam said the study would encompass such things<br />
as The refugees' reasons for leaving their own country;<br />
Their social characteristics;<br />
* Their aspirations in their new homeland;<br />
* What Australian Government assistance in maintenance and<br />
welfare they requ., Iested, or needed, and received;<br />
The problems they thought they might have to face in settling<br />
in Australia, and how these compared with the problems<br />
actually encountered;<br />
The problems of culture and language difference they had to<br />
face, and what happened to their cultural identity in the<br />
process of re-settlement; and<br />
To what extent if at all they suffered from racism. / 2 </p>
<p>Other factors which would emerge from the study<br />
would be employment patterns, the use made of qualifications<br />
and skills possessed by the refugees, their success in becoming<br />
integrated, and the time they took to become indistinguishable<br />
from the rest of the Australian community in their requirements<br />
of the Australian Government.<br />
" This is the first time that Australia without<br />
regard to racial origins has offered resettlement opportunities<br />
to people displaced in Asia who had no identifiable connection<br />
with this country," Mr Whitlam said.<br />
" In living up to her responsibilities in the<br />
international community, Australia accepted those considered<br />
most in need of humanitarian assistance and who were unlikely<br />
to be offered resettlement opportunities elsewhere."<br />
