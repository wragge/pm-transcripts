TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH JOHN LAWS, RADIO 2UE, SYDNEY, 10 MAY 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
JL Prime Minister, good morning and welcome.<br />
PM: Thank you, John, good to be here.<br />
JL Are you happy with the response to the Budget?<br />
PM: Well, I think we've had a round of editorials as good as I can<br />
remember for a while and I think that's because that the key aim of the<br />
Budget was to keep the growth we've had for the last three years going<br />
and I think it becomes apparent to any reader of it that the rate of<br />
growth we've got now is sustainable, it's slowed as we wanted it to, it's<br />
sustainable, we've got low inflation, we've got the Budget back into<br />
surplus and we've got a major change in there on superannuation and<br />
long term savings and retirement incomes.<br />
JL Well, maybe you've been looking at different editorials. I've looked at<br />
a couple and some of them are reasonably scathing, I suppose, would<br />
be a way to describe them. Geoff Kitney; in the Sydney Morning Herald<br />
says, let me quote it, " If Mr Keating gets away with this, he'll have<br />
pulled off one of the greatest political escape acts".<br />
PM: Yes, but that's not editorial, that's a comment from a journalist. Well,<br />
but I think he in his article also pays credit for the change here. I<br />
mean, what we've gone is from a Budget deficit last year of $ 12.9<br />
billion to a surplus of $ 700 million. Next year we'll have surplus there<br />
without reliance on any one-off effects, that's a recurrent surplus, and<br />
the following year we end up with a surplus next year we end up with<br />
a surplus of $ 3.4 billion, the following year $ 4.5 billion. Now, what that<br />
means, John, is this it means that the public sector of Australia is not<br />
out there bidding for Australian savings. Therefore we are not putting<br />
pressure on overseas savings in the current account deficit. That's the<br />
linkage. In other words, if the Commonwealth Government isn't out </p>
<p>there in deficit bidding for Australian saving Ãµ , we are not therefore<br />
putting pressure on to bid for foreign savings through the current<br />
account deficit.<br />
JL But when Ralph Willis announced a surplus last night, you could hear<br />
an audible intake of breath not just from the Parliamentary chamber,<br />
but from around the nation. The best prediction has been for a deficit<br />
of what, $ 2-3 billion, I think?<br />
PM: Yes, and without the I mean, what you've got here is basically, we<br />
want to make the point that the Budget was in surplus virtually<br />
forthwith. That is, we are not out there bidding for savings right now<br />
because we think while we've got a medium term focus on the current<br />
account and our national debt and we've got the remedy in there on<br />
the Budget change and superannuation to meet it in the medium term.<br />
We also want to do it quickly.<br />
JL The surplus is brought about really, I mean, if you look at the fine print,<br />
to achieve this you've flogged off the family silver as they say, in<br />
particular selling the Commonwealth Bank. Without the asset sales,<br />
what would the deficit have been, because it would have been a<br />
deficit?<br />
PM: If you took the Commonwealth Bank out of it, we'd have a deficit of<br />
around about probably two and three quarters to three billion dollars,<br />
but next year we would have a surplus without any asset sales. So in<br />
other words, see, in this Budget...<br />
JL But you won't have any assets.<br />
PM: Oh yes, oh yes there is.<br />
JL Well, I mean Qantas...<br />
PM: No, no we are only putting half the Commonwealth Bank in this year,<br />
half next year.<br />
JL But you've only got half the Commonwealth Bank, first half s gone.<br />
PM: We're putting a quarter, well we're putting half of what we have left in<br />
this year and half next year.<br />
JL Okay, so you've already sold half the Commonwealth Bank, but that<br />
means you've got a remaining half...<br />
PM: We've got half to sell worth about $ 4.5 billion we'll put $ 2 billion in<br />
this year and $ 2 billion next year. </p>
<p>JL Okay, so that last half, in other words the remaining quarter, will then<br />
be sold when?<br />
PM; That would be sold in the year 1996-97 Budget.<br />
JL Well, what happens when they're gone and there's no more assets to<br />
flog?<br />
PM: Well, that's what I told you. When they're gone we are still in surplus<br />
without them. Next year, in 1996-97, the Commonwealth Budget on a<br />
recurrent basis is in surplus without the asset sales.<br />
JL Is the sale of the Commonwealth Bank anathema to you? It was in<br />
1986 I think you used an expression, or Bob Hawke did, either one,<br />
that Ben Chifley would spin in his grave if he knew that the<br />
Commonwealth Bank was going to was that you or Bob?<br />
PM: No, I didn't say that. No, the thing is, look, the Commonwealth Bank<br />
was always a sort of show flying on one wing. It was the old,<br />
essentially the old State Savings Bank of New South Wales which the<br />
Commonwealth Bank, then a fledgling bank, took over in the<br />
Depression and the preponderance of its assets was in New South<br />
Wales. In the late 1980s, it bought the State Savings Bank of Victoria<br />
and it was then flying on two wings in the two most populous States.<br />
At that point, it turned into a real major institution. We then floated off<br />
a quarter of it, we've since floated another quarter off and in an<br />
institution which we began with being worth $ 3 billion, is now going to<br />
be worth $ 7 billion and it's working now as a completely commercial<br />
bank and there's no policy reason why we should keep it.<br />
JL Why didn't you sell it in 1986?<br />
PM: Because it wasn't, as I said, it was only flying on one wing it was<br />
essentially, what Europeans call, a post office bank and it's not that<br />
today. It's a full commercial bank and therefore we decided to sell it.<br />
But, John, leave the Bank to one side because it's already priced and<br />
in the market. The shares are in the market and everyone knows what<br />
the price of them is.<br />
JL Well, what about Qantas?<br />
PM: Well, Qantas again Qantas has a great opportunity to be the premier<br />
airline in South East Asia, but it needs capital which the Government<br />
can't give it. I mean, we can't take money away from pensions<br />
payments to families to put capital into Qantas. So, what we've done<br />
is merged Australian Airlines into Qantas and we are now selling the<br />
merged airline Qantas and when it goes to the market when it needs<br />
capital for aircraft or for on ground facilities or route expansions </p>
<p>around South East Asia it will be able to go to the Australian stock<br />
market and get the capital.<br />
JL: Okay, well you've talked about selling Qantas before, how many times<br />
can you claim a return from the sale of Qantas is this going to be the<br />
last time?<br />
PM: Well, we're not selling things out of cycle we won't sell them when the<br />
stock market is bad, we won't sell them when the profits of the<br />
company are low. We wanted to get Qantas' profitability up and time<br />
it. You've got to take some advice from the underwriters and we've let<br />
that now go into this financial year rather than last financial year. But,<br />
the key point, John, is there's a $ 3,000 million recurrent change in the<br />
Budget. That is, a net $ 700 million from cuts in Government spending<br />
and $ 2.3 billion on the receipt side. So, there's a $ 3 billion change in<br />
the Budget on a recurrent basis. That's what brings the Budget into<br />
surplus next year. So, if I give you this point the current account<br />
deficit problem is about two percentage points of GDP, and that's<br />
around $ 10 billion. The Budget will change, the Budget balance will<br />
change, by 4 per cent of GDP in the next couple of years. That is,<br />
from a deficit of around $ 2.5 billion to one of surplus of around 1.5 per<br />
cent of GDP. So, we've got a fix in there for the current account<br />
problem through the Budget. The other fix we've got in there is this<br />
enormous change on superannuation. For the first time ever, every<br />
Australian working person will have a 15 per cent superannuation<br />
contribution coming into their account. That's 9 per cent from the<br />
arrangements the Government's already put into place, the<br />
Superannuation Guarantee Charge, and last night what we announced<br />
is a further 6 per cent 3 per cent from people themselves and 3 per<br />
cent from the One Nation tax cuts...<br />
JL: Yes, well that seems to mostly be getting applause. That's where the<br />
tax cuts that were L-A-W went?<br />
PM: They're going to go to people's superannuation account and as a<br />
consequence, for the first time ever, you're going to let me just give<br />
you the figures because this is the first comprehensive private savings<br />
plan...<br />
JL: Okay, don't make the figures too big or too complicated.<br />
PM: No, no, but let's make this point: this is the first Government that's<br />
ever given Australia, all Australians, a comprehensive private savings<br />
plan or scheme. What this does is, what it will mean is, that every<br />
Australian working person will be able to build up for their retirement a<br />
level of income which will be roughly double the pension. So, I will<br />
give you an example of personal average weekly earnings: a person<br />
on average weekly earnings, which is around $ 33,000, will end up with<br />
a benefit of $ 461,000 if they joined the scheme today and were in it for </p>
<p>years. Or, if they take it as an annual annuity, it's worth $ 30,000 a<br />
year to them. So, you take a person on $ 33,000, they build up a bank<br />
of $ 461,000 in today's dollars today's dollars and they go out with<br />
$ 30,000 a year. Now, that could only happen with a big national<br />
scheme like this, and let me say this John, it would only come from a<br />
Labor Government.<br />
JL: Why didn't you do it before?<br />
PM: We did. We started in the ACTU, and the Government under the<br />
Accord Mark V in 1985-86, that was the first 3 per cent. Then we went<br />
to 5 per cent, then we went to the Superannuation Guarantee Charge<br />
to go to 9 per cent, and now we're adding another 6 per cent 3 and 3.<br />
JL: Well, as I say, that certainly is...<br />
PM: Can I just add to the point?<br />
JL: Sure.<br />
PM: This is where, I mean, we get all these criticisms from our opponents,<br />
but could you imagine the Liberal. Pa~ rty sitting down thinking of an<br />
arrangement, talking to the workforce, getting them to agree to put<br />
income away to save it and that working from 1985 to 1995 and then<br />
under the arrangements to 2000, to come from nothing to 15 per cent<br />
for every person in the country. Now, what that will do, not only will it<br />
lift their retirement income, but it lifts our national savings. In 1985, we<br />
had $ 40 billion in super funds. This year, we'll have $ 186 billion. In<br />
the year 2020, we reckon we'll have $ 2,000 billion $ 2 trillion. And<br />
you notice in today's Financial Review on the front page, it's a $ 2tr<br />
bonanza. That's the first time I've ever seen that expression on an<br />
Australian newspaper tr means trillions $ 2,000 billion. Now, what's<br />
our national debt? $ 160 billion. So, the Government last night put the<br />
seal on a savings scheme that will put for the nation $ 2,000 billion<br />
compared to a national debt of $ 160 billion.<br />
JL: Martin Ferguson, speaking of the ACTU, said it was a tough Budget a<br />
bit better than saying it wasn't his job to defend the indefensible which<br />
he said a couple of years ago but, tough. Where's the pain for Martin<br />
Ferguson in there?<br />
PM: Well, it's a Budget which, there's cuts in Government spending...<br />
JL: Not too many.<br />
PM: Well, yes, they're there...<br />
JL: By .6 of a per cent </p>
<p>PM: No, the Budget is around about, outlays are I think about $ 120 billion...<br />
JL: And you've cut it by $ 700 million.<br />
PM: And we've cut it by, we cut it in gross terms by $ 1,500 million this year,<br />
$ 2,800 million next year, $ 2,000 million the year after and just on<br />
$ 2,000 -million the year after that. But with the various new policy,<br />
that's new policy and unavoidable new policy, the net change this year<br />
is $ 700 million. In other words, we've saved $ 1,500 million gross, the<br />
net saving is $ 700 million.<br />
JL: Yes, it must seem strange to people, and maybe Martin Ferguson<br />
meant it was tough when he sees things, not that he minds the left<br />
wing too much, but when he sees things like a quarter of a billion<br />
dollars suddenly being found for Brian Howe's pet project, this Better<br />
Cities program. I mean, if you were really being tough, programs like<br />
that would have gone under the razor, they wouldn't be getting extra<br />
funding?<br />
PM: No, that's not right, John. Look, let's take one of the projects it's doing.<br />
The railway, we are funding in part the railway from Brisbane to<br />
Robina on the Gold Coast. This is the fastest growing area of<br />
Australia. It's an area of enormous development of sub-divisions,<br />
there's enormous traffic build-up and blockages and that whole Gold<br />
Coast area, that whole Gold Coast corridor is a real problem for<br />
Brisbane.<br />
JL: Yes, but isn't that a Queensland problem?<br />
PM: Queensland is not going to be able to afford to do it by itself. So, we<br />
are doing that. We're doing similar things I opened the interchange<br />
recently in Melbourne at Maribyrnong which is giving a rail and bus<br />
interchange for the new rail service out beyond Dandenong, and<br />
without the Commonwealth money it just wouldn't happen. So, in other<br />
words, there are parts of the country in, if you like, in public<br />
infrastructure where the State and the municipal governments can't<br />
afford it. I mean, but the key point is this, John, Australia's spending,<br />
Australia's government spending is the second lowest in the world.<br />
Now, I've got the table here in front of me let me tell you what it is.<br />
JL: How do we manage to have the second lowest in the world when we<br />
have far more politicians per head of population than any other<br />
country?<br />
PM: Well, let me politicians....<br />
JL: Well, it's pretty important to us, we're paying. </p>
<p>PM: Yes, I know, but it's a major diversion Let me just say this, look,<br />
the United States has got 33.6 per cent of its GDP in Government<br />
spending all sectors. Australia has 35.7 per cent. Now let me go<br />
down the others: Germany 48.9; France 55; Italy 56; UK 43; Canada<br />
48; Austria 52 et cetera and it rises up to 56 per cent. Australia is at,<br />
this is the Commonwealth and the States, is at 35 per cent of GDP. In<br />
other words, and the Commonwealth is at 24 per cent. So John, we're<br />
delivering an efficient, effective public sector including great schemes<br />
like Medicare, for 24 per cent of the nation's output.<br />
JL: Well, imagine what we could do if we didn't have all those<br />
unnecessary politicians?<br />
PM: But, the thing is this, you can't in a country like this, you can't have<br />
roads, rail, health services of this quality, at less than 24 per cent. All<br />
these people, you'll have John Howard on the program later, he'll tell<br />
you, " oh we haven't cut Government spending". But the thing is every<br />
time you say to these characters, " well do you want to cut into<br />
pensions? Do you want to cut into payments to families?" Because<br />
that's what you have to do to go any lower than this. So, what the<br />
Government did was a tough, reappraisal of the spending over<br />
weeks, a 10 week meeting of the Expenditure Review Committee, and<br />
as a consequence of all that, we have changed the Budget balance on<br />
a recurrent basis by $ 3,000 million. And we've done it, I think, fairly<br />
and while we've done that we've at the same time developed within the<br />
Budget that wonderful change on superannuation, you know, which, I<br />
mean, countries just don't get breaks like this. There are not many<br />
national governments around the world setting up for their community<br />
anything like a 15 per cent contribution to private savings.<br />
JL Would it not have been possible to cut Government spending more?<br />
PM: No, I don't believe so and Ralph Willis very eloquently, I think, took his<br />
critics on in the Budget lock-up yesterday for those people to say we<br />
ought to cut Government spending. We've got Government spending<br />
back at where it was before the Whitlam Government came to office in<br />
1972. Now, you know, we've had 1.3 per cent population growth on<br />
average, we've had an enormous change in participation in schools. I<br />
mean three kids in ten were completely secondary school in the early<br />
1980s it's now nearly nine in ten. We've got this massive throughput<br />
into universities, into TAFE. We've got the major sophistication over<br />
years in the health scheme and we're still delivering Commonwealth<br />
Government spending at around those early 1 970s levels.<br />
JL Yes, I know you're not terribly interested in discussing the number of<br />
politicians we have in the country because you see it as not being<br />
important, but when you talk about our good record which is, according<br />
to the figures you've given me, a terrific record, the amount that we are<br />
able to do with the spending that we make, the Government spending </p>
<p>we make, imagine what we could do if we didn't have the excessive<br />
number of politicians that we've got who must have bureaucracies...<br />
PM: But that's not a Budget debate, John, that's a debate about the States<br />
and the Federation and everything else, and I've only got 40 minutes<br />
with you so I want to keep it can I make this point to you: what the<br />
Treasury said last night was this, it said the economy is now growing at<br />
a sustainable rate and it is expected to remain in a growth phase over<br />
the forward estimates period that's three years. Now, we've had 3<br />
and a half years of growth since the recession, the Treasury is now<br />
saying we've got 3 more years coming up. That gives the lie to John<br />
Howard's cynical opportunist line that there were five minutes of<br />
sunshine. I mean, what does he say now when we've had 4.5 per cent<br />
growth for this last year and we've got 3.75 per cent coming up and the<br />
Treasury is forecasting three more future years of low inflationary<br />
growth. I mean, that's what the Government was re-elected for in<br />
1993, to keep growth going and to keep employment going. What<br />
we've done is make that growth sustainable and that's turning up here<br />
in the forecasts. We've adjusted the Budget to keep it going, to keep<br />
the pressure off interest rates so we don't need to grab the monetary<br />
lever.<br />
JL: Can you think of a Budget in the last ten years that's been brought<br />
down by you or your Government or somebody else that hasn't been<br />
applauded the way that you people applaud your own Budgets? That<br />
hasn't been coloured to be the perfect solution to the problems of<br />
Australia the day after the Budget's been...<br />
PM: But I don't think they're perfect, but they work. Look, let me just say<br />
this, here's Mr Fischer, the Leader of the National Party, last year<br />
there's his last year's press statement, I'll leaWe it-wityou it said,<br />
" The Government won't get it's 4.5 per cent growth if it doesn't get it's<br />
forecast 14.5 per cent growth in business investment." What was the<br />
outcome for the year? 4.75 per cent growth and investment was<br />
per cent, not 14 per cent. He said, " and no-one, including Treasury,<br />
believes that investment growth number", we nearly doubled the<br />
number.<br />
JL: Yes, but that's what I'm saying. All the Budgets that you've been<br />
associated with, all the Budgets that have been brought down, have<br />
been going to be the solution to the problems that the country has, that<br />
people still believe that the country has problems. So what's going to<br />
be different about this one?<br />
PM: Well, John, we've been growing, we've been having this sort of<br />
unreality debate, you know, that the country's got troubles. Well, it's<br />
been growing at 4-5 per cent with 2 per cent inflation.<br />
JL: Why do people perceive it has troubles? </p>
<p>PM: Well, just record this fact, It's been growing at 4-5 per cent when<br />
Europe is growing at 1 per cent with 2 per cent inflation and 4 per<br />
cent employment growth. I mean, that's the sort of trouble that about<br />
another 100 countries out there would like to have. I mean, that's the<br />
sort of benefits that have come from the Government's policies over<br />
the last couple of years. I mean, we've never been in a position of that<br />
sort of growth with low inflation since the middle 1960s.<br />
JL: Yes, I'm aware of this. But the question I put to you is why do people<br />
perceive, because I hear it constantly, that this country has problems?<br />
Why is it all doom and gloom?<br />
PM: Well, I don't think it is all doom and gloom, but they saw the monetary<br />
adjustments, the interest rate adjustments last year and they thought,<br />
hello, here goes again, but in fact, what was happening was we were<br />
slowing the growth down not killing it off slowing it down. That's<br />
what the Budget forecast and the out-turn for the year, I think,<br />
establishes that weha siuccessfully slowed it down. And the doom<br />
merchants, I mean, take John Howard he's been running around now,<br />
I mean, cynically, opportunistically saying, " oh look we've had five<br />
minutes of sunshine." In fact, we've had three years of growth at about<br />
four times the rate of Europe. Japan is growing at half a percentage<br />
point. We're growing at around 4 percentage points, four times as<br />
much, well nearly four times as much, and the Treasury is telling us<br />
we're going to be growing now on a sustainable basis for three more<br />
years. So, I mean, when you've got characters like Howard wandering<br />
around saying, oh look don't worry, the sky's falling in, the sky's falling<br />
in doing this Chicken Little number all around the country.<br />
JL: But why do people believe it?<br />
PM: Well, I don't think they do, John. I don't think they do, I mean, the<br />
culture of criticism in the media today has become of, sort of, epidemic<br />
proportions. I mean, nobody is prepared that's why I think that<br />
programs like this are valuable because people can actually hear what<br />
the policy-makers are saying, what the institutions like the Treasury or<br />
the Reserve Bank are saying and they can make their own judgement.<br />
They can hear what the unions have to say, they can hear what<br />
business have to say better they hear that than these noisy, voluble,<br />
opinionated comment pieces from people in the media.<br />
JL: Now, tell me...<br />
PM: Because they're a dime a dozen.<br />
JL: Do you people hear them, however? </p>
<p>PM: Do I hear the people? That's all I listen for. I mean, one has got to<br />
listen through the screen of comment, the sort of culture of criticism, to<br />
listen to what your conscientious Australian person is saying and<br />
thinking.<br />
JL: Are you aware, I understand you're a terribly busy man, but are you<br />
aware of what people say generally on program like this, are you<br />
aware of what the Australian feeling is?<br />
PM: Oh yes, because I try and listen to them wherever I'm travelling around<br />
and the other thing is, you see, when I go to things people sidle up to<br />
you and they say, listen Paul, I'll tell you this and I always listen,<br />
you've got to be a good listener in public life. I always listen because,<br />
say over a couple of weeks, I do many functions, I see many people.<br />
And each one, you pick up a little bit at each one, and you put it<br />
together and you get a fair idea of what public opinion is and what<br />
concerns people and what their aspirations are. Now, you know, I can<br />
only say this to you John, I mean, this Government is listening all the<br />
time and here we are last night, we've been in office 12 going on 13<br />
years, this is a Budget from a Government that could have been in<br />
office 12 months. I mean, it's got all the freshness in the world about<br />
it.<br />
JL: It's being called by some an election Budget, but that's not necessarily<br />
criticism is it?<br />
PM: Well, that's a great compliment. I mean, if they want to say they<br />
thought the Budget was so good it was an election Budget, though it is<br />
a serious Budget, a serious Budget to deal with taking the pressure off<br />
interest rates and the current account, if they want to pay us a<br />
compliment of saying it's so good it's an election Budget, well I'll take<br />
the compliment and thank them for it. But the truth is the Government<br />
sat down seriously to relieve the burden of higher interest rates on this<br />
country by putting the burden onto the Budget's policy and giving us,<br />
filling that savings pothole we've got outftHer-e a-round the late 1990s<br />
and the year 2000, and the thing we got for that is the Budget surplus<br />
and superannuation.<br />
JL: Last year's Budget said that the deficit would be about $ 18 billion. It<br />
turned out to be $ 27 billion. They're the sorts of things that I think<br />
concern the public. They say, but oh but last year he said it was going<br />
to be $ 18 billion and it blew out to $ 27 billion. What happened there?<br />
PM: No, that was the current account deficit. Yes, well what happened<br />
there was we had the drought which lost us a heap of agricultural<br />
revenue and the investment, I already read Mr Fischer's comment, the<br />
forecast in the Budget for investment was 14.5 per cent. It turned out<br />
to be 25 per cent. Whenever you have a big investment bubble, the<br />
investment goods, the producer goods, you know, the digitally </p>
<p>operated machines, mainframe computers, which we do not make<br />
here, all come in at once. So, if you look at, a couple of things<br />
happening we've got a big investment bubble and we had the<br />
drought. So that threw the current account out. But the main thing is,<br />
John, not last year's current account or this, John, the main thing is the<br />
trend.<br />
JL: That's right, but it doesn't alter the fact that people are going to leap on<br />
to a that the current account deficit is tipped to be...<br />
PM: I know, but let's go back, you and I had these discussions in the<br />
election campaign of 1993. It's just over two years ago. At that stage<br />
unemployment was 10.5 per cent. It was all about employment and<br />
jobs. I was elected as head of this Government and this Government<br />
was re-elected principally to deal with growth and employment. That is<br />
what we have faithfully done. Unemployment is now down to 8.7 per<br />
cent from 10.5 per cent and we've got it going to 8 per cent in this<br />
Budget. So in the space of three years, we'll have taken<br />
unemployment from 10.5 per cent to 8 per cent and falling. And we've<br />
done that with a high growth, low inflation economy. You know, it's as<br />
if people don't want to hear that these good things are happening.<br />
When we introduced Working Nation last year, that was to deal with<br />
the long term unemployed. Do you know this year, John, we've had<br />
100,000 long term unemployed people that's people unemployed<br />
more than 12 months 100,000 back to work. I mean that's a fantastic<br />
thing for this society.<br />
JL: Yes, I agree and it's difficult to argue with that. Just quickly, the lift in<br />
the company tax rate is as you say to cash in on the increasing<br />
profitability of Australian companies but when you drop that company<br />
tax rate, that was because you wanted to give the same sort of tax<br />
regime for companies here that they could get in Asia. Does this mean<br />
you're no longer worried about losing business, moving it offshore to<br />
take advantage of lower tax regimes?<br />
PM: Well, I think we worry about these things but again, you can only do it<br />
years ago when I became Treasurer, when John Howard left me the<br />
Treasury job, the company rate was 46 per cent. We reduced it to 39<br />
per cent and we gave the shareholders full dividend imputation that's<br />
no double tax on dividends which the Liberal Party never gave them.<br />
Then we reduced the rate from 39 per cent in one go to 33 per cent.<br />
This is when John Hewson was campaigning on taking it up from 39<br />
per cent to 42 per cent. In the 1993 election, the Liberal Party's policy,<br />
John Howard's policy, Hewson's policy, was to take it from 39 to 42 per<br />
cent. We took it from 39 to 33 per cent and we're now putting it back<br />
to 36 per cent because the Budget does need more revenue and the<br />
big package we gave business in that tax cut plus two investment<br />
allowances plus accelerated depreciation cost us $ 3 billion a year.<br />
Now that the company profit share, the profit share in the economy, is </p>
<p>a record high again, we think it's reasonable that companies should tip<br />
some money in. And what are we asking them for? $ 300 million this<br />
year and $ 1,500 million next year.<br />
JL Okay, but if that...<br />
PM; Which is pretty reasonable.<br />
JL If that tax increase comes from companies, what's in this Budget for<br />
jobs? I mean, the revenue is coming from companies so obviously<br />
they're not going to be in the position to employ perhaps as many as<br />
they could have been.<br />
PM: Oh no, I mean, all those changes are taken into account when we<br />
make the forecast. The forecast we have, the Treasury forecast for<br />
1995-96, is for 3 per cent employment growth.<br />
JL Yes, now, a lot of parts of the forecast last year were terrific but there<br />
were a lot of parts of the forecast last year and the year before that<br />
weren't too terrific, so...<br />
PM: Not many, not many. I mean, the only thing that went astray on us is<br />
the current account deficit. The rest of it, in fact, we did better than the<br />
forecast. We did much better on growth, we did better on inflation.<br />
JL We did too well then in some areas and had to increase interest rates.<br />
PM: Well, I mean, better too well than not good enough. I mean...<br />
JL Tell the people who are paying the mortgages.<br />
PM: Yes, but I mean, also understand this, John, this was when we had<br />
interest rates down to, we had mortgage rates down to 8 per cent.<br />
They had an enormous increase in disposable income when<br />
mortgages went from 15 per cent down to 8 per cent. They've gone<br />
from 8 up to 10 per cent. I mean, and the job now is to stabilise that.<br />
JL Do you believe that....<br />
PM: And do you know this, in the last week you've seen two banks reducing<br />
their fixed housing mortgage rates the National Australia Bank and I<br />
think Westpac have reduced their fixed housing interest rates. So I<br />
think there's a very good trend, there's some very good signs there.<br />
JL Why the increased tax on building materials?<br />
PM: Simply because the tax base has been declining on us. You see,<br />
when we, let me explain this, for very good policy reasons, the<br />
Government has taken down the tariff wall. But the tariff wall was </p>
<p>expressed in Customs Duty which you paid on imports. That's now<br />
costing the Budget, that policy change which is a tremendous change,<br />
it's completely changed the nature of Australian industry for the better,<br />
but that policy change is costing the Budget this year $ 6 billion and<br />
every year $ 6 billion. The company tax changes I mentioned to you<br />
cost us $ 3 billion a year. So just those two things have cost us $ 9<br />
billion. We've got to get some of it back somewhere. So what we've<br />
done is put what I think is a sensible expansion into the Wholesale<br />
Sales Tax base into some hardware and building products.<br />
JL: But why building products? I would have thought that...<br />
PM: Because most other things, most other electrical goods and<br />
whitegoods and those things, are covered. But it covers things like<br />
nails and taps and...<br />
JL: Yes, it's going to increase the cost of a house.<br />
PM: Yes, I know, but it's not on bricks, it's not on concrete, it's not on tiles,<br />
it's not on timber, it's not on the basic building, it's just on the bits and<br />
pieces that go into it.<br />
JL: Okay, well I appreciate your time very much. Maybe somebody in your<br />
office could list off some goodies for us about Australia that we could<br />
offer. I mean, I hear you deliver these figures and I know that the<br />
figures that you're delivering are accurate and they are also interesting<br />
maybe it would be an idea if we reminded people every now and<br />
again, and surely the Opposition would agree to the odd reminder<br />
every now and again, that there are areas that Australia in fact leads<br />
the world and we should perhaps have a better opinion of our own<br />
country.<br />
PM: Well, we are, John. You know I was in Germany recently and I met the<br />
Premier of Lower Saxony and that's in Hanover. And in Hanover, near<br />
Hanover is the city of Wolfsburg which is the basis of the Volkswagon<br />
plant, the Volkswagon city of Germany, and he said to me, you know<br />
Mr Keating, he said, we've got great community spirit here, he said,<br />
we've all agreed to work a four day week because we've got to put<br />
people off at Wolfsburg to get the productivity up. And I said, but why<br />
aren't they getting other jobs? He said, because there isn't enough<br />
employment. They have three quarters of 1 per cent employment<br />
growth in Germany, in that part of Germany.<br />
JL: Three quarters of 1 per cent?<br />
PM: And you know what we had last year? 4 percentage points. In other<br />
words, we had five or six times as much employment as that country.<br />
Now, how would I be talking on your radio program saying well, John,<br />
I'll tell you what we want people to do, we want everyone to work a four </p>
<p>day week. I mean, many Australians should understand that the<br />
Australian economy has been one of the best performing in the world<br />
in the last three years with high growth and low inflation and high<br />
employment. And when you get around Europe and you look at 30 per<br />
cent youth unemployment in France, long term, massive long term<br />
unemployment, declining rates of economic and employment growth<br />
and see what this Labor Government has since we introduced the One<br />
Nation statement in 1992 to kick start the economy, and got ourselves<br />
re-elected in 1993 with complete fidelity to reduce unemployment and<br />
lift growth and now to put in a long term savings plan for the country<br />
forever, that's the sort of policies you get from a Government that's<br />
listening and thinking.<br />
JL: You say that payments to the States will be rationalised does that<br />
mean cut?<br />
PM: No, it just means that we have these disparate indexes for how we pay<br />
what is called Specific Purpose Payments and the Commonwealthowned<br />
payments.<br />
JL: Are they going to get more or less?<br />
PM: No, they are going to be less and they are going to be less because<br />
some of the indexes for instance, the CPI, when we pay, a lot of<br />
these programs are simply, the costs are simply labour costs, the<br />
labour costs elements of them are much lower real costs to the States<br />
and to the Commonwealth than say a CPI adjustment which will have<br />
in it fresh fruit and vegetables, mortgage interest rates all the things<br />
that don't apply to States or Commonwealth delivery of programs. So,<br />
in other words, we've put indexes in there which are better tailored for<br />
the sort of programs that we actually spend.<br />
JL: Would you think that the State Premiers are going to have to do<br />
something about their own tax levels?<br />
PM: Oh no, I think the States,.. we're running into a very good cycle at the<br />
moment. I notice that Victoria has got it's Budget back into surplus,<br />
Queensland is into surplus, Bob Carr, I'm sure, will grab hold of the<br />
New South Wales' budget. As I said to you before, John, when I read<br />
you those numbers earlier, that was for the whole of the nation's public<br />
sector, the Commonwealth Government and all of the States and<br />
Territories and we are the second lowest spending country in the world<br />
that's all of us together. So, I mean, I think the happy news out of<br />
last night and the round of State Budgets is that Australia's public<br />
fiscal position is now going to be in surplus and this is a great thing for<br />
the country at this stage of the cycle.<br />
JL: Okay, Prime Minister, again thank you very much for your time. Good<br />
to see, I'm sure you're in great demand today. </p>
<p>PM: Thank you, John, I appreciate the opportunity and the opportunity, can<br />
I say, particularly to talk directly to people and not have it sort of<br />
filtered, cut, you know, shredded to opinion...<br />
JL: Well, it will be by the time it gets on television tonight.<br />
PM: You know, by the sort of sub-editors and the rest. The fact of the<br />
matter is, on your program, as you say, dial-in democracy...<br />
JL: You like that, don't you?<br />
PM: I like that line, dial-in democracy, it's also dial-out conversation about<br />
the things that really matter. And I hope your listeners have found it<br />
valuable as I have. Thanks John.<br />
JL: Okay, let's see if we can organise for you to come in in the not too<br />
distant future and perhaps take some of these calls from some of these<br />
listeners and speak directly to them. Is that possible?<br />
PM: Glad to do it.<br />
JL: Okay, well we will talk about that in the not too distant future. Prime<br />
Minister of Australia, Paul Keating.<br />
PM: Thank you.<br />
