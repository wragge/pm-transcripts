    <content><![CDATA[<p>Today, Australia remembers all those who lost their lives on Flight MH17.Â </p>
<p>There were 298 innocent people on this aircraft and their deaths offend our sense of justice.</p>
<p>We grieve for all, but particularly for the 40 victims who called Australia home, including 38 Australian citizens and residents.</p>
<p>A National Memorial Service was held in the Great Hall at Parliament House to honour those who lost their lives and support those who have been bereaved.</p>
<p>A permanent memorial has been established in the gardens of Parliament House and will serve as a constant reminder of the lives lost a year ago.</p>
<p>The plaque is inscribed with the names of the Australian victims.</p>
<p>The plaque sits on top of soil taken from the Ukrainian town of Rozsypne.</p>
<p>The soil was collected by an Australian Federal Police officer from the area where Flight MH17 came down.</p>
<p>I thank the men and women who contributed to the response to MH17 for their professionalism and commitment.Â </p>
<p>They ensured the victims of this tragedy were treated with dignity and respect, and that their families were provided with the best support we could give.</p>
<p>The Governor-General has announced awards for a number of Australian service men and women and government officials who made key contributions to Operation Bring Them Home.</p>
<p>The awards include Public Service Medals, Australian Police Medals and Humanitarian Overseas Service Medals for those who went above and beyond the call of duty. The Governor-General has also announced an honorary award in the Order of Australia.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth Government continues to work with the international community to ensure the implementation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 2166, which called for a full, thorough and independent investigation into the downing of MH17.</p>
<p>On this first anniversary, we restate our support for the families and honour the lives of their loved ones.</p>
<p>They will always be remembered.</p>
<p>17 July 2015</p>
