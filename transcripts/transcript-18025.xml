More than $470 million will be injected into repairing roads in the hard hit Lockyer Valley and Ipswich regions as part of Operation Queenslander  -  the largest reconstruction task in the state's history.</p>
<p>More than 100 kilometres of state roads were damaged following the unprecedented Queensland floods.</p>
<p>Over 1,400 jobs will be created by this vital work to reconstruct damaged sections and will be delivered over the next three years.</p>
<p>Across the region up to 14,000 jobs will be sustained throughout the reconstruction task, at a time when jobs and job security are needed most. This funding will include the reconstruction of 62 kilometres of the Warrego Highway between Marburg and Withcott, set to be completed over the next couple of years.</p>
<p>The Gillard and Bligh Labor Governments are jointly funding the reconstruction of these vital roads under the Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements. The Commonwealth will be funding 75 per cent of the project, with the state government contributing 25 per cent of the funding.</p>
<p>In the initial response to the disaster, roads were kept open for locals, tourists and industry through an injection of up to $56 million on emergency road repairs in the Lockyer Valley and Ipswich regions.</p>
<p>This funding will support making Queensland roads better, safer, stronger and more resilient than before. Local companies, regional companies and state-wide Queensland companies will also benefit from the jobs created as the massive task of rebuilding Queensland continues. </p>
