    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to announce that the Australian Government will be making an additional contribution of $1 million to the Fulbright Program. This will allow the Australian Government contribution to match that of the United States Government at around $US800 000.</p>
<p>The original treaty for the Australian Fulbright Program, signed in 1949, was the first treaty between our two nations and predates the ANZUS Treaty.  Since its inception in Australia, more than 2500 Australians and 1800 Americans have been Fulbright scholars in our respective countries.</p>
<p>Fulbright scholars are internationally recognised as leaders in their fields, reflecting the academic merit and excellence for which the program is renowned.  The ties created by the Australian-United States Fulbright program are indicative of the great friendship between our two countries.  I am proud to be an honorary co-chairman of such a distinguished program.</p>
