    <content><![CDATA[<p>Your Excellency General Sir Peter Cosgrove and all the many other veterans who are here today, the servicemen and women of Australia and the United States.</p>
<p>We are here today gathered as the Governor-General acknowledged on the land of the Larrakia people to remember the day 75 years ago in 1942, when a formation of silver flecks, glinting in the mid-morning sun, appeared over the horizon.</p>
<p>Some of our troops were buoyed by the sight, mistaking the planes for British reinforcements. But by the time the Rising Sun insignia was overhead, they knew they were under attack.</p>
<p>And as the roar of the bombers, the fighters began raining down terror upon this vulnerable city, they leapt to the defence of their nation.</p>
<p>Australia’s worst fear had been realised. Our nation was under direct attack for the first time.</p>
<p>188 Japanese aircraft came in the first wave, 260 in all.</p>
<p>More than 240 people were killed here and up to 400 more were wounded.</p>
<p>Many were civilians, ordinary Australians going about their lives imagining that the war was far away.</p>
<p>Soldiers, sailors, airmen of the Australian and United States armed services died alongside them, defending our land, skies and sea.</p>
<p>Today, we pay tribute to those who died. To those who survived and fought on. To those who lost mates and family.</p>
<p>And we are honoured, all of us, the leaders of the nation, of the territory, of the city, all of us honoured to be in the company of you, veterans and survivors of that day.</p>
<p>We, your sons and daughters, stand in awe at the selflessness, courage, sacrifice of your generation - you won the war, you saved the nation, you preserved and defended our freedom, and then with forgiveness you built the peace.</p>
<p>We salute you.</p>
<p>This morning, the Governor-General and I, and many other citizens, representatives of the United Stated and Japan laid wreaths to honour the 91 members of the United States Navy who lost their lives on the USS Peary - brave men who came to rest here, in waters far from home.</p>
<p>And here in Darwin and around the world our two nations’ finest continue to serve, shoulder to shoulder - partners in freedom’s cause.</p>
<p>Today, we honour all who were on Australia’s frontline 75 years ago.</p>
<p>And to those who defended our shores so bravely, your nation owes you a great debt.</p>
<p>We know that the best way to honour the diggers of a century ago, of 75 years ago is by looking after the servicemen and women, the veterans and their families of today.</p>
<p>Your sacrifice—and the sacrifice of the people of Darwin—will never be forgotten. Enduring and timeless to will be the gratitude of our nation, that you defended so bravely in our darkest hours.</p>
<p>Lest we forget.</p>
