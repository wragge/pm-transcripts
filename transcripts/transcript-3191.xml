PRESS STATEMENT NO. 205<br />

COCKBURN SOUND SHIP REPAIR FACILITIES FOR STUDY<br />
( Joint Statement by the Prime Minister, the Hon. E. G. Whitlam<br />
and the Premier of Western Australia,<br />
the Hon. J. T. Tonkin, M. L. A.)<br />
An independent study to examine ship repair<br />
requirements, both commerical and naval, on the West Australian<br />
coast, is to be commissioned early this year.<br />
The Australian and West Australian Governments will<br />
commission a j-udy of the possibilities of long term, staged<br />
development of future ship repair facilities in Western Australia.<br />
The two Governments recognised that joint naval and<br />
commercial ship repair facilities could raise practical problems,<br />
but agreed also that separate facilities which ultimately could<br />
be developed to complement each other might be feasible.<br />
Invitations to undertake the study will be issued to<br />
selected tenderers later this month.<br />
Tenderers will be asked to examine the economic and<br />
engineering feasibility of establishing commercial ship repair<br />
facilities in Western Australia. They will also be called upon<br />
to examine the feasibility of joint planning for the development<br />
of commerical ship repair facilities along with the Royal Australian<br />
Navy's long term proposals for extending naval ship repair facilities<br />
at HMAS STIRLING, Garden Island, W. A.<br />
Representatives of-the two Governments, at a meeting<br />
in Canberra last week, agreed on details of the study, which was<br />
expected to be completed in about six months and cost between<br />
$ 20,000 and $ 30,000. The cost would be shared equally between<br />
both Governments. The study will be managed jointly by representatives<br />
of both Governments.<br />
