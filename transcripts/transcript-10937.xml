<p>Your Excellency, Lady Deane, other very distinguished</p>
<p>   guests including my Ministerial colleagues John Anderson and Robert</p>
<p>   Hill, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p>This is the first occasion that I have had an opportunity</p>
<p>   as Prime Minister to come to these Landcare Awards. And they do</p>
<p>   represent a quite remarkable bringing together of different communities</p>
<p>   in Australia who are dedicated to the care and the restoration and</p>
<p>   the protection of our very fragile and special environment.</p>
<p>It is true, as the Governor-General said, that</p>
<p>   the environment has now become one of those things that straddles</p>
<p>   the differences between politicians on both sides of the political</p>
<p>   divide. It is no longer an issue that only the young are interested</p>
<p>   in. It is no longer an issue that only people living in areas of</p>
<p>   the bush and the regions of Australia are interested in. It is certainly</p>
<p>   no longer the preserve of those people who live in what are loosely</p>
<p>   called the leafy suburbs of Sydney and Melbourne. It is now an issue</p>
<p>   that effects everybody.</p>
<p>And at its grass roots, and at its best, and its</p>
<p>   most basic and its most enduring the landcare movement represents,</p>
<p>   in my opinion, the best expression you can find anywhere in Australia</p>
<p>   of the enduring concern of Australians for the future of this precious</p>
<p>   and beautiful continent of ours.</p>
<p>[applause]</p>
<p>And I am very happy on behalf of the Government</p>
<p>   to say how strongly we support the landcare movement and how excited</p>
<p>   my colleagues and I are about this gathering of so many competitors.</p>
<p>Now we also have a very significant number of sponsors,</p>
<p>   and one of those sponsors of course is Telstra. I don't give</p>
<p>   Telstra any special plug except to say that Telstra had a little</p>
<p>   bit to do a couple of years ago with a little bit of money that</p>
<p>   ultimately ended up being invested by my Government in the future</p>
<p>   of the environment. And I am very proud of that Natural Heritage</p>
<p>   Trust, very proud indeed.</p>
<p>[applause]</p>
<p>And I am also very proud of the fact that my two</p>
<p>   Ministers have gone out of their way to make certain, through their</p>
<p>   own actions, that that money gets to the right destinations and</p>
<p>   I can promise you they will go on doing that. Because it is the</p>
<p>   responsibility of governments to see that money goes where it is</p>
<p>   meant by governments to go.</p>
<p>And landcare is going to receive in the coming</p>
<p>   year about, or overall rather, about $280 million out of the $1.25</p>
<p>   billion that has been set aside out of the sale of Telstra and set</p>
<p>   aside for the Natural Heritage Trust.</p>
<p>Landcare of course is a great community movement.</p>
<p>   It brings together on a voluntary and co-operative basis people</p>
<p>   from all sections of Australian society who have a common commitment</p>
<p>   towards, and a common love of the land which is held in us... trust</p>
<p>   for future generations of Australians. And that is something else</p>
<p>   about landcare which is so tremendously important.</p>
<p>And I think the other thing that I want to say</p>
<p>   tonight is that it is an opportunity to remark on the importance</p>
<p>   of non-metropolitan Australia to the future of our nation. I am</p>
<p>   very conscious as I speak to you tonight that many areas of Australia,</p>
<p>   despite the fact that drought has been put behind us in other parts</p>
<p>   of our country, that there are still many areas of Australia which</p>
<p>   are severely affected by drought. And I am very conscious as somebody</p>
<p>   who grew up in the city of Sydney and has always lived in the cities</p>
<p>   of Australia, I am very conscious of the different challenges that</p>
<p>   face my fellow country men and women in the rural areas of Australia.</p>
<p>And the rural areas of Australia occupy a very</p>
<p>   special place in my own heart, and they occupy a very special place</p>
<p>   I know in the hearts of all Australians. And even though we have</p>
<p>   a relatively small part of our population who live in the rural</p>
<p>   areas of Australia they bulk very large in the export earnings of</p>
<p>   our nation and they bulk even larger in the affections of the rest</p>
<p>   of our nation. We understand the tribulations that you suffer, we</p>
<p>   understand how important the nurturing of land is to your future,</p>
<p>   we understand the massive contribution that the bush makes to this</p>
<p>   nation of ours. And I have often said that I can't imagine</p>
<p>   the Australia that I grew up to love, I can't imagine that</p>
<p>   Australia, without a vibrant rural community. I can't imagine</p>
<p>   that nation without its beloved bush and of course to have its beloved</p>
<p>   bush we need to care for the future of the bush and that of course</p>
<p>   brings us very much back to landcare.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Government</p>
<p>   I express again my very strong support for the landcare movement.</p>
<p>   It is making a magnificent practical contribution to the caring</p>
<p>   and the preservation of our environment. I congratulate all of those</p>
<p>   who have participated in competition for the awards that are going</p>
<p>   to be made tonight. I thank the sponsors, all of them for the great</p>
<p>   contributions they are making. And I wish all people who live and</p>
<p>   work and have their future in the bush the very best of happiness</p>
<p>   and success and I thank you for the wonderful contribution you make</p>
<p>   to our nation.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>[Ends]</p>
