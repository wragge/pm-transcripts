J, ~ AUSTAt 4<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
ADDRESS TO BUSINESSMEN'S LUNCH, COOLANGATTA, 16 FEBRUARY 1981<br />
I am quite sure that as member for McPherson Peter White will<br />
be a very gcod member, who will not only be able to represent<br />
this electorate and its particular interests, but also the<br />
S state of Queensland and make a very worthwhile contribution<br />
to the Party Room and to the general government of the<br />
country. I am looking very much when Parliament first<br />
meets onzbout the 24th of this month to welcoming Peter<br />
White in the Liberal Party as your member.<br />
He has got a good record of service, he is a local and he<br />
knows the area and knows your concerns. Referring beyond<br />
that, it ir; fair enough I think sometimes to ask why vote<br />
Liberal'. Why Liberal, as opposed to some other political<br />
party. I believe the Liberal Party is the only effective Australiawide<br />
party which represents the interests of all people, of<br />
all groups within the AustraliaR community. I believe the<br />
Liberal Party alone is capalble,, effectively defending and<br />
building the kind of Australia we want, in which freedom<br />
and the importance of individual men and women and their<br />
children is paramount in all the policies we pursue, where!<br />
people are free, where they are not pushed around by the<br />
bureaucracy,* where they are given some special protections<br />
against the sometimes inevitably growing bureaucracies<br />
and intrusions of a modern state. Where they are not<br />
oppressed by the prospect of higher and higher taxes; I'll.<br />
have something to show in a ( inaudible) about that because!<br />
I assert without fear of contradiction from any of my good<br />
friends that the Liberal Party stands in the forefront of<br />
tax reform and tax reduction.<br />
Throughout Australia, the Liberal Party is successfully<br />
representing great electorates. Great electorates such as<br />
the one of McPherson, except there is something unique about<br />
this electorate not repeated in any other place. As the<br />
only Australia-wide party we represent as many or more rural<br />
seats as the National Party and I think that is worth noting.<br />
We represent great traditional cities, Townsville, Bendigo,<br />
Launceston and many others. We are the party where the<br />
policies in a real sense are really made. We are part of<br />
a great national movement right around Australia, founded<br />
by Sir Robert Menzies and many other far-sighted people i:,, i / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
the last days of Labor Socialism in the mid-40' s, and has<br />
been the greatest political party that Australia has ever<br />
seen or will ever see. Because the Liberal Party wrill<br />
endure and strengthen while Australia survives, and that<br />
is going to be forever.<br />
Labor really-isn't a credible alternative. I think that's<br />
probably recognised. Even on taxes they're still talking<br />
about higher taxes and more taxes, and they've tried to run<br />
away from the fact that they were proposing a wealth tax.<br />
But the leader of the Labor Party Opposition in Victoria<br />
shortly after the elections said it's time we had a wealth<br />
tax, and it's quite plain that that kind of punitive approach<br />
is very much a part of their philosophy. They were proposing<br />
a capital gains tax and, you know, it's very much against<br />
the Liberal Party philosophy to have a capital gains tax.<br />
And I was surprised when Glen Sheil caught up with the<br />
idea and wanted to have a capital gains tax with about<br />
If he did I think that would be about the highest capital<br />
gains tax in the western world. I know some countries have<br />
them and they don't advance their causes by so doing. And<br />
I thought this state had abolished death duties. I didn't<br />
really know that Johwas wanting us to introduce<br />
death duties on the living as Glen Sheil's capital gains<br />
tax would be.<br />
The Labor Party is still living very much in the past. The<br />
Left is more influential than ever. ( Inaudible) three<br />
elections in a row pretending to be moderate and in-Opposition<br />
that's what the Labor Party always do. Mr Hayden obviously<br />
thought he tried another tack and he said we've got to stop<br />
trying being moderate; we've got to stop trying to pretend<br />
we're not openly and blatantly socialist in everything that<br />
we do. -We've got to retain our socialism and go about it<br />
in a full blooded way. Well if he wants to go on talking<br />
like that we can have anoth-er general election, and double<br />
the majority again. But a majority is enough but it is<br />
a tiny reminder -to. the people of McPherson that the Labor<br />
Party isn't an option,<br />
The National Party in Canberra are great partners in a great<br />
coalition and the relationship in that coalition I think is<br />
probably better than it has been in any coalition in all<br />
the years I have been in the Parliament. And that's going<br />
back to the middle sixties. But I don't know how it's happened,<br />
the State branch of the party seems to have proposed policies<br />
that are slightly unrealistic in relation to the nation' s<br />
affairs in this by-election. But I don't really know why<br />
a state branch of a party wants to get into the business<br />
of trying to make federal policy anyway. Well they've got<br />
their own policy problems within the State sometimes. But<br />
I noticed only yesterday my good friend, joh said the only<br />
party pushing for lower taxation is the National Party<br />
we'll just query that a little we're a low taxation party-<br />
* and we've administered Queensland that way. We're the only<br />
ones to keep pressing our policy on. Well that's a great ./ 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
statement. But the part I would like to draw to your attention<br />
and we have administered Queensland in that way. I really<br />
would like to question that a little bit. Because when<br />
Joh first became Premier in 1968, was it, he had 83,000<br />
public servants. How many do you think he has got today?<br />
100,000? 110,000? It's 149,000, a growth of 60,000.<br />
Now I don't know whether that is the greatest growth of<br />
all the States but it is certainly a very great growth.<br />
He spent in 1968 $ 220 a head for the people of Queensland.<br />
In 1979/ 80 he spent $ 994 a head, which is an increase in<br />
real terms of 55%. And if he had held that money constant in<br />
real terms so that the good people of Queensland should<br />
have got the benefit of lower taxes instead of higher<br />
government spending, there would have been $ 780 million<br />
to give back to the people of Queensland in taxes lower<br />
than they would now pay. That's $ 27 a month for every<br />
man, woman and child in the State.<br />
Now when he says that we're a low taxation party, we've<br />
administered Queensland in that way, I believe that those<br />
figures put a question mark over it to put it mildly in<br />
quite a. substantial way.<br />
Well a lot has been ' said about the flat rate tax proposal and<br />
I don't think that's really taken very seriously. I don't<br />
think anyone with a social conscience and a concern for<br />
this community, for the total community which is the concern<br />
of the'Liberal Party, are more of those who believe in our<br />
philosophy. I don't think anyone could give much credence to a proposal<br />
that would seek to more than double the tax on somebody<br />
earning $ 9000 a year with a dependent spouse and at the<br />
same time halve the tax on somebody earning more than $ 50,000<br />
a year. I don't think there is much social justice in that.<br />
I don't think this community is one that will support a<br />
proposal of that kind which is so blatantly and plainly<br />
inequitable. The proposal that was put would cost, slightly<br />
later figures than the ones I had a week ago that John Howrard<br />
has worked out for me. The latest proposals on the norma.<br />
states' share would have involved a reduction of $ 500 million<br />
in the Commonwealth payments to the state of Queensland for<br />
general revenue purposes. Now do we really believe that the<br />
state of Queensland is prepared to accept its share of that<br />
particular reduction, when only three or four days ago<br />
all the Premiers signed a document, an agreed document from the<br />
States asking for more money, a greater share, higher returns<br />
we would have to tax, they wouldn't have to tax it, and<br />
give it to the States to spend as they want. And this is just<br />
one of the reports of that particular document in one of<br />
the papers today which states they press for a bigger slice<br />
of taxes.<br />
So when Premiers come to Canberra I have never yet known<br />
a Premier say, look I've got enough money on this particular<br />
issue, Prime Minister, I don't need more on that issue. Have<br />
you ever known a Premier to come back and say he has enough?<br />
They always want more. If somebody wants to reduce taxes as<br />
./ 4 </p>
<p>I do, and that's why we sometimes say no to Premiers at<br />
the Premiers' Conference. That's why we have staff ceilings,<br />
that's why have 10,000 less public servants than we did<br />
five years ago in the Commonwealth. If you really want to<br />
reduce taxes you have got to show that you are fair dinkum<br />
in restraining expenditure. And you don't allow your<br />
state bureaucracies to run wild, you don't allow your own<br />
expenditures to run wild. And you don't go to every Premiers'<br />
Conference saying how mean the Commonwealth is, they should<br />
give us more money, They should be saying give us less money<br />
so long as you use what we don't pay in taxes. Well, Joh<br />
share of the less on his own proposals is $ 500 million and<br />
when we have that Premier's Conference I think I might collect<br />
it from him.<br />
But, ladies and gentlemen, that's really a bi-play--., I got out<br />
those figures that somebody got for me, and I thought them<br />
too good not to use.<br />
The really important thing is that Australia is growing in<br />
confidence, Australia is growing in capacity, just as the<br />
Gold Coast is growing forward strongly, the spirit of free<br />
enterprise, that's what's happening here in different ways<br />
is being mirrored right around Australia. The re-building of<br />
thisnation is well underway. What we've done in the last<br />
five years is in a real sense is building the foundations.<br />
But if you are going to build a strong nation, the foundatio: 2-s<br />
have to be strong. And they are. But a lot of it is underground.<br />
But from now on, through the ages, the next three years, you<br />
are going -to see the result of it all above ground. And<br />
they'll be wider and wider recognition of the benefits of<br />
our policies.<br />
I think there are still some who may not feel that progress has<br />
been made, but if ' they go to Britain, go the United States, or<br />
to Europe, they'll see the great difference between the<br />
confidence and enthusiasm in Australia and the difficulties<br />
being experienced in many other countries.<br />
of course, we had to get the fundamental things right. Inflation<br />
had to come down because it robs the retired, the aged, it-hurts<br />
the weak most of all. It makes it hard to sell our good side<br />
eit'--her in Aust%. ralia or overseas, therefore it destroys confidence<br />
and jobs. And that's why, having worked at it for five years,<br />
having our inflation now below the average of all western<br />
countries, and right now at the bottom of range, its a beacon<br />
of hope all around the world and people say why has Australia<br />
been able to do things, which they've not been able to do over<br />
the last five years in other places. And I think that the<br />
fact that our inflation has come down while theirs has been<br />
. going up is the fact that this economy is growing while the<br />
world economy is standing still is all the more credit to<br />
all Australians, because we've gone against the tide. / 6 </p>
<p>It's easy enough, perhaps, if you are reasonably sensible<br />
to get a bit of growth and expansion into an economy, to have<br />
jobs increased, but if the whole world's economy is growing,<br />
you get picked up in that. The world economy isn't growing,<br />
the world's trade has not been moving much and Australia<br />
has gone against the tide in a resounding way as a result<br />
of what we've done. And a large part of that is as a result<br />
of the decline in the government's claim on resources.<br />
And the size of the public service is a sign of that<br />
10,000 down on five years ago and in the same period Joh's<br />
has gone up 14,000.<br />
And the third fundamental accept the economic growth we<br />
need in this country. Because we need that growth so that<br />
we'll have jobs for people but also so we will have the<br />
resources to enable people to have the standard of life<br />
they want, for themselves and their families, but also so<br />
that governments can take a reasonable share to provide<br />
the things that governments must do without taxes being<br />
too punitive. And the OECD is now believing that Australia<br />
will grow., at 4% this year, while many of the major OECD<br />
countries won't grow at all, some, the poorest ones their<br />
economie s will even shrink they'll produce less than the<br />
years before. And think what that means for their standard<br />
of life, for the jobs in those countries. It's a circumstance<br />
that is depressing and hope that it is soon reversed. Business<br />
investment is upward, oil exploration is the highest since<br />
1969, mining and manufacturing $ 33 billion intended for<br />
Australia and about $ 8 billion or 25% of it is because of<br />
Queensland. Because the broad economic policies of this<br />
State, that there is a bit more restraint in expenditure<br />
and allows a compatible and encouraging investment and<br />
development in the great state of Queensland. But the growth<br />
is across Australia. In many different kinds of industries,<br />
in mining, manufacturing and also in rural, because before<br />
the drought rural employment had grown for the first time<br />
in 30 years. And that again is a mark of what we've done.<br />
But this is happening because government policies are not<br />
longer pushing private people and individuals and businesses<br />
aside. We passed the ball to private enterprise and with<br />
the imagination aid iniative of Australians, we' re picking<br />
up and running with it, to the advantage of themselves,<br />
their families, all Australians.<br />
And so employment has grown strongly over the last year, and.<br />
especially so in this state. This helps to provide resources<br />
for those in need. We introduced the present sensible income<br />
test for pensioners, we indexed pensions twice a year to<br />
protect the elderly, pensioner health benefit cards have<br />
been relaxed to benefit additional people. We have provided.<br />
in the last budget, special additional assistance to welfarE!<br />
beneficiaries with dependent children. We have provided<br />
funds for 700 projects to build homes for the elderly and<br />
12 of them are being built in this electorate. / 6 </p>
<p>We want to Continue to restrain public expenditure, to<br />
provide strong growth throughout this economy so that we<br />
will have a greater capacity to reduce the burden of<br />
taxation. But it's got to be dune sensibly, it's got to<br />
be done in a realistic way and there'su'io point in coming<br />
forward with schemes that might sound good if you look at<br />
the front cover but fall apart once you take that cover off.<br />
And I believe our way of restraining government expenditure,<br />
of encouraging growth in this economy, offers the only<br />
real way to lower the individual tax burden on Australians<br />
and on Australian families. And we reject totally the high<br />
tax policies of the Australian Labor Party.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, as a result of what we have done over<br />
the last five years, and as a result of the initiative and<br />
work of countless thousands of Australians in this state,<br />
on the Gold Coast, right around the Commonwealth, Australia<br />
is now a beacon of hope for many advanced industrial countriLes.<br />
People have said how has Australia been able to achieve,<br />
why haven't other countries been able to, why have you been<br />
able to get your growth up and your inflation down and so<br />
many others have failed to do so.<br />
As a consequence there's a respect from our neighbours, from<br />
our trading partners, the respect from business people and<br />
financiers who want to invest their dollars in Australia,<br />
sharing With us the growth and potential of one of the great<br />
countries of the world. And this area, the Gold Coast, is a<br />
symbol of this spirit of private enterprise. You've only<br />
got to look around to hear more and see how much has been<br />
done because people have confidence, and they back their<br />
confidence with dollars.<br />
The philosophy of the Liberal Party in government has I<br />
believe ' opened the vision of Australia which seemed quite<br />
out of reach a few years ago. We now need to plan ahead<br />
with a clear perspective of what we are about. We need to<br />
have it understood that our policies are not ones for this<br />
week, next month. They're not policies for a by-election,<br />
they're policies for the term of Parliament from the decade<br />
that will last, that will endure, that will stand the test<br />
of time. The policies which will mean I think that we're<br />
not going to be judged on our rhetoric, but on our actions,<br />
on our results. And here you can see the results all around.<br />
But in this there is a role for everyone who believes in<br />
our cause, there is a role for everyone especially over the<br />
week who believes in Peter White as I do. People want to<br />
be assured that our decisions are carefully thought through,<br />
there is a consistency in judgements in our policies, that<br />
we are governing in accordance with our philosophy and ideals<br />
and that our decisions show concern for the well-being<br />
of individual Australians and their families. I think<br />
people want to know that we offer something much more than<br />
a good standard of living, something much more than nuts and<br />
bolts of a material society. We offer a way of life steeped<br />
in freedom and the values which have stood by the Liberal </p>
<p>7. -7-<br />
Party since its foundation in 1945. -And in getting that<br />
message across, there is an opportunity for everyone to<br />
do something about it, either to recruit more members<br />
of the Liberal Party or to convert one, two, three or<br />
four a day, depending on your energy and your powers of<br />
persuasion from one or other of the parties I don't<br />
mind which to our cause because our cause is right, and<br />
our cause is right for Australia. I have a total and<br />
utter conviction of that, and if I didn't have that<br />
conviction* ltd stay on my own farm.<br />
Your vote for Peter White is a chance to keep in touch with<br />
the work of the Liberal Party in Canberra. It is a chance<br />
to make sure you have a voice in the party room, a voice<br />
that can speak to government of your concerns, not just<br />
for this election, but for the wider Australia which we<br />
all love. It's a chance to see that the successes of the<br />
I past are not squandered on some hairbrain schemes which are<br />
brought out that last for three weeks and are not intended<br />
to last beyond that.' It's a chance to have a responsible<br />
voice in the Fraser/ Anthony government. which I believe has<br />
done niuch for Australia. But there is a great challenge<br />
ahead of us and the work has just begun.<br />
