<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, has Mark Waugh called it quits too early?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look, I just want to take the opportunity for thanking him for the years of pleasure that heâs bought to Australian cricket followers, the joy that his stylish batting has been to watch. Heâs probably one of the two or three most elegant batsmen Iâve ever seen and heâs also been a magnificent slip-fielder. Heâs had a very long career as an Australian player and I thank him for what heâs put into Australian cricket and I know that I speak for cricket lovers all around our country in saying that.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Whatâs your message to business leaders here today and also to the ministers youâll be meeting later to try and enhance some trade links?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well at a bilateral basis I think the relationship has got a lot better, internationally the message is one of practising what we all preach in relation to freer and more open trade. And Iâll talk to you later.</p>
