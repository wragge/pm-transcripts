PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 12 NOVEMBER 1978<br />
ADDRESS TO THE NATION<br />
Last week in Melbourne all the State Premiers, the Federal<br />
Treasurer, John Howard, and myself came to an agreement that<br />
will have far reaching consequences for the future development<br />
of all the States of Australia.<br />
We were able to do this only because of the hard decisions<br />
we have taken over recent years, and because of the progress<br />
we have already made towards economic recovery.<br />
Tonight I want to report to you about that progress, and<br />
about the way in which the Government, your Government, sees<br />
the years ahead.<br />
There are already significant benefits from the steady course<br />
we have set. The runs are on the board.<br />
Inflation is down, and it is falling. Interest rates are<br />
coming down last February there were cuts in interest rates<br />
affecting home buyers, and just ten days ago there were -other<br />
cuts affecting a wide range of borrowers. Business confidence<br />
is returning. Local and overseas investment is increasing.<br />
Unfortunately, unemployment is still far too high. That is of<br />
great concern to me, and I know it is of concern to all of you.<br />
It is because the Government is so concerned that we are<br />
prepared to take the hard, unpopular decisions that we know<br />
are right for Australia. We are not prepared to take those<br />
decisions that might appear to help, but which we know will not.<br />
Actions that we have already taken are enabling Australian<br />
manufacturing industry to get back into export markets.<br />
How many of you know that Australian companies are exporting<br />
furniture to Sweden, and colour television sets are being<br />
exported into the toughest market in the world to Hong Kong<br />
against Japanese competition. Australian-built, Australiandesigned<br />
fishing vessels are being exported to a number of<br />
countries in South-East Asia. At least one major motor<br />
manufacturer is re-building its export organisation.<br />
All this is possible only because inflation is down, because<br />
costs have stabilised, and Australian manufacturing industry<br />
is more competitive in our own market and in export markets. / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
of course, our rmining industry is also moving ahead. The oil<br />
pricing decision we took about 15 or 16 months ago has resulted<br />
in two companies alone committing themselves to $ 1,000 million<br />
worth of development and exploration in Bass Strait and at<br />
Exmouth Gulf off the Western Australian coast.<br />
That means more oil reserves. It means more jobs for Australians.<br />
The Ranger Agreement, reached with the Northern Land Council<br />
last week, means that Australia will be able to meet energy<br />
commitmaents in an energy short world. That will mean a great<br />
deal for development, and for employment, in the Northern<br />
Territory. For the first time in years, farmers are looking to the future<br />
with optimism. Just on four years ago their costs increased by<br />
about 30% in one year. Now, their costs are stabilising, and<br />
their returns from wool, sheep, from beef and wheat are all<br />
good, much better than they have been for a long while. Farmers<br />
right across Australia are facing one of the best seasons they<br />
have had in many years.<br />
All that is good news, not only for farmers, but also for<br />
people who live in country towns, in the cities--for those<br />
in the industries servicing the farming community.<br />
We often forget the very real interdependence between people<br />
who live on the farms and in the great cities of Australia.<br />
All of this points to a more prosperous future. If Australians<br />
are prepared to get up and have a go, we can realise that<br />
future, and take on the challenge of the 1980' s.<br />
Governments have a key role to play. There is much that Governments<br />
must do. We have to get inflation down even further. We must keep<br />
the economy on a firm and steady course, undeterred by results in<br />
a few popularity polls. At the same time, Commonwealth and States<br />
must provide basic support for industry: power, transport, ports,<br />
pipelines, water supplies, all so vital to industry and industry's<br />
expansion. Your Federal Government has always been committed to working in<br />
co-operation with the StCates, and last week we took that<br />
commitment to Federalism a significant stage further. After<br />
two years of negotiations, at a special Loan Council meeting,<br />
the States were given authority to borrow overseas to assist<br />
major developing projects. Earlier in the year, in June, there<br />
was agreement about the guidelines. Now all seven Governments,<br />
the States and the Commonwealth, acting together have taken<br />
decisions that will enable major development works to proceed.<br />
In NSW and Queensland, coal export facilities will be vastly<br />
improved. In all the Eastern States there will be a great<br />
expansion of power generation, as well as in the Pilbara of<br />
Western Austalia. Hydro-electric and water supplies in Tasmania<br />
will be greatly improved. For Western Australia we have taken<br />
3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
decisions that will encourage the great North-West Shelf<br />
development to go ahead, and also an alumina project.<br />
in South Australia, where there was some concern about the<br />
future of industrial development, we have taken decisions that<br />
will enable the State Government to construct power supplies<br />
and pipelines that will encourage a great petrochemical plant<br />
at Redcliffe.<br />
Again, in Melbourne, a great World Trade Centre will be built<br />
that will encourage trade, to and from Australia, around the<br />
world. It was a rare show of unity between Governments acting<br />
together to advance Australia's cause. All seven Governments<br />
have worked and planned together to encourage Australia's<br />
development. It was an historic meeting.<br />
With that kind of co-operation Australians can face the 1980' s<br />
with enormous confidence.<br />
The Government has great responsibilities, and we are determined<br />
to pursue them. But Government alone cannot achieve the Australia<br />
we all want. Only Government acting in partnership with all<br />
its citizens can create the Australia of which we dream.<br />
With that kind of partnership, I have unbounded faith in the<br />
future of Australia. The 1980' s will be years of optimism,<br />
years of development. Certainly there will still be problems,<br />
I imagine there always are for Governments. And much remains<br />
to be done.<br />
But, with confidence in ourselves, with faith in Austral~ ia,<br />
the 1980' s will be years of growth. They will be years of<br />
prosperity. They will be years of excitement, for al1l Australians. </p>
