STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
RELEASE OF REPORT " RESTORING FULL EMPLOYMENT"<br />
Today, I have received the Report of the committee on<br />
Employment Opportunities. The Government established-the<br />
CommTittee on May 28 this year, requiring it to analyse<br />
the causes of Australia's unemployment and present policy<br />
options for the future.<br />
It should be understood that this is not a Government<br />
Report, but a Report the Government and to the<br />
Australian community. There remains the process of<br />
public discussion which must occur between now and the<br />
delivery of the White Paper next May.<br />
During this process of public discussion I think it would<br />
help for us all to reflect that as we argue the pros and<br />
cons most of us business people, lobby groups, and<br />
politicians will do so from the relative comfort<br />
station of actually having a job.<br />
In other words, to be effective the process will require<br />
all Australians in work to imagine what it i; s like to be<br />
out of work.<br />
Unemployment is at once offensive to our ideals and a<br />
major source of inefficiency in our economy. It has<br />
devastating affects on individuals and their families,<br />
and debilitates social cohesion. It increases the costs<br />
of welfare and hence the burden of taxation. It limits<br />
the scope of public expenditure, including the reduction<br />
of public debt. 7: is Australia's greatest contemporary<br />
problem. it is the first priority of the Government and<br />
must be the first priority of the nation.<br />
The Report makes tefundamental issues abundantly., clear.<br />
There is no simp'Ã± e solution to unemploymenrt, no single<br />
solution: but, without question, an essential condition<br />
of success in the fight is a high and sustainable rate of<br />
economic growth.<br />
we have every reason for confidence that we can achieve<br />
this growth. The cresens rate of 31.5% compares favourably<br />
with our OECD counterparts. Interest rates are the<br />
3878 </p>
<p>lowest in more than a decade, inflation the lowest in a<br />
generation. Profits are back to pre-recession levels.<br />
Australia is more competitive than ever before and the<br />
willingness to embrace change on which this new<br />
competitiveness has been built will itself be a vital<br />
factor in solving our unemployment problems.<br />
The Report makes clear that more change is needed.<br />
Australia needs to continue on the road to greater<br />
competitiveness. Without it, and without a higher rate of<br />
economic growth than we have at present other policies<br />
will merely tinker at the margins of our problem.<br />
The Government is firmly of the view that we can restore<br />
full employment.<br />
But as the Report says, we can only do this provided that<br />
the Government and all sections of the community are<br />
prepared to develop a new and stronger sense of national<br />
purpose, and a consensus that the goal is worth pursuing.<br />
In the past year, we have done much to make the economy<br />
more competitive, much to stimulate growth and much in<br />
the way of direct labour market assistance for unemployed<br />
people. We have spent more than $ 1.3 billion on labour market<br />
programs this year, doubling the job chances for over<br />
500,000 unemployed Australians.<br />
The Committee takes the view that, vital though it is,<br />
economic growth will not on its own be sufficient to<br />
solve the problem.<br />
We learnt this during the 1980s when, at the end of an<br />
employment boom, 100,000 people remained unemployed for<br />
12 months or more. These long term unemployed<br />
Australians now number 340,000.<br />
The Report is unequivocal about this: long term.<br />
unemployment has severe social implicaEions and is a<br />
severeimpediment to labour market efficiency.<br />
The Report, therefore, presents various options for an<br />
immediate, determined attempt to reduce long-term<br />
unemployment. Central to these options, is the principle of " reciprocal<br />
obligation". That the obligation on Government and<br />
the community to provide positive assistance to : nose who<br />
are out of work, and the obligation on unemployed<br />
individuals 1to actively seek work and accept it when it<br />
becomes available.<br />
The obligation, of course, extends to business, unions<br />
and empioyees who must address the constraints to growth. 13 Or1 </p>
<p>3<br />
Foremost amongst the Conuittees options is a<br />
" Job CompactO for the long-term unerqployed under which<br />
this country would decide that it i..% simplv unacceptable<br />
for anyone to remain out of work fdr longer than a<br />
specified period the Report suggests 18 months.<br />
The aim of the " Job s Compact" is to break through the<br />
barriers which confronit the lona term unemployed: only a<br />
Dob effectively puts a person back into contact with the<br />
labour market. Only a job puts skills back into action<br />
and encourages the development of new ones. Only a job<br />
regenerates morale, discipline and confidence.<br />
The Report estimates that the " Job Compact" would reduce<br />
the number of long-term unemployed from an anticipated<br />
290,000 in June 1988 to around 90,000.<br />
The Report also addresses the critical issue of<br />
restructuring our social security system to reflect<br />
changing employment opportunities and changing job<br />
aspirations. In addition, the Report contains a wide range of<br />
proposals for the targeting and delivery of services,<br />
increasing the skills of the Australian workforce and<br />
encouraging the unemployed to undertake training and<br />
study. This is a most important Report, not just for the<br />
Government, not just for the unemployed, but for the<br />
Australian community for every Australian.<br />
It raises questions about matters which fundamentally<br />
affect the welfare of our fellow Australians, the health<br />
of our communities, the well being of future generations,<br />
and ultimately our status as one of the world's advanced<br />
social democracies.<br />
I urge all Australians to recognise that unemployment is<br />
their concern, and to make the goal of full employment<br />
theg oal.<br />
