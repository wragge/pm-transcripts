OPENING OF TULLAMARINE AIRPBORT<br />
MELBOURNE, Vic. 1LJULY 1970<br />
Spe c byj the Prime Minister,. Mr. ohn Gorton-<br />
Mr. Premier, My Lord Mayor, Parliamentary Colleagues and Ladies and<br />
Gentlemen: just about six years ago, on a very dank and drizzling and miserable<br />
September day, in my capacity as Minister for Works, I drove the bulldozer which<br />
turned the first sod for the construction of this air-port.<br />
And very glad indeed I was to do it for two reasons. One was that it<br />
began construction of an airport sooner than it had been thought construction woulld<br />
begin. And the other was that I had escaped the conisequen~ ces of taking a rather<br />
risky gamble. You see, what happens when edifices of this k,, inrd are constructed by the<br />
Government is that after the basic decision, the Department of Works prepares<br />
general plans and then those general plans are submitted to the Parliamentary<br />
Committee on Public Works. And only after the Parliamentary Committee on<br />
Public Works has agreed to the general plans are the detailed plans proceeded with.<br />
This is a very good and a very proper way of going on. But in this particular case<br />
I felt it would add an inordinate time to the date on which construction should begin,<br />
so I instructed the Department of Works to assume that tihe ? arliamentary Public<br />
Works Committee would agree to the general plans and to go right ahead with the<br />
detailed plans. This was a very reprehensible thing to do and I hope it will never<br />
be repeated by any Minister for Works. But the end result was, because the<br />
Committee did agree with the general plans, that we were able to start much sooner,<br />
and I was able tu avoid the embarrassment which would have uccurred if the<br />
Committee had not agreed to what we had put forward. Those were the two reasons<br />
why I was glad to be able on that day to begin this construction.<br />
And I remember then that the whole 5, 000 acres of farmland which was<br />
to become this airport gave the impression of being nothing but a sea of mud and<br />
a rather bleak and a rather repellent cold rural scene. But now today, Tulla marine...<br />
I like the name " Tulla marine.... I'll have more to say about that later, but now<br />
today Tullamarine and that farmland has been transformed into Melbourne airport.<br />
It has become a significant addition to the aviation maps oZ the world, an international<br />
airport international because those who planned it were progressive and<br />
imaginative in their thinking international in siz-e and its sophistication, and<br />
international because it will provide truly internatio-nal services.<br />
So today Tullamarine phases Victoria the international airline<br />
circuit and offers facilities to travellers as a port of arrival and of departure equal<br />
to any facilities offered anywhere in the world. Cne more window on the world for<br />
Australia, one more window through which the world car. look at Australia, and<br />
for that reason, I think, a big day for us. </p>
<p>This, as you were told by Senator Cotton, has been a record year for<br />
Australian civil aviation.... two international terminals completed in our largest<br />
cities within weeks of each other and record numbers of passengers carried. And<br />
this year we celebrate fifty years of civil aviation and the fiftieth birthday of Qantas<br />
Quee11sland and Northern Territory Air Service which, you may remember, began<br />
with these old machines looking as if they were tied together with wire, in<br />
Queensland and in the Northern Territory, and which today gives its name to our<br />
international service. We have come a long way in half a century to rank as we do amongst<br />
the first six nations of the world, and we can take pride in that. But in taking<br />
pride in it, let us look back a little, let urp look back to past exa~ mples of services<br />
to aviation, because looking back to past examples may sustain a vision for the<br />
future. Let us remember men like Hudson Fysh, Kingsford Smith, Bert Hinkler<br />
and a host of other Australians, and let us never forget that they were the first to<br />
cross the great oceans of the world, except the North Atlantic, andi even there<br />
Harry Hawker almost made it. These were the men who blazed the trails across<br />
hitherto untravelled skies.<br />
So this airport stands today as a monument, as I see it, to the men<br />
of the past and it stands as a promise for what we can do in the future. There are<br />
no limits to the distance we can go if we plan well, if we build well as I think we<br />
have done here and if we are inspired to venture in the years to come, as the<br />
pioneers of aviation of whom I have spoken were inspired to venture in their time.<br />
Sir, before 1 declare this airport open, there are two things I would<br />
like to say. When I declare it open, I am going to call it Melbourne Airport, and<br />
that is what It will officially be. But I hope and I believe and this is a personal<br />
hope and belief that that lovely liquid name " Tullamarine" will not disappear<br />
from our vocabulary, and that around the world Tullamarine Melbourne Airport<br />
in brackets, or if you like: Melbourne Airport Tullamarine In brackets, will be<br />
known by names such as La Guardia or Heathrow or whatever it may be.<br />
So when I do declare it open, I do it in the hope that it will be known<br />
not only as Melbourne Airport bout as Tullamarine and that as Tullamarine, it will<br />
be an airport able to operate for seven days a week and for twenty-four hours a<br />
day. And I hope and believe this will be so if for no other reason than when there<br />
is an investment of this size then the more use that it got from it the better it is<br />
for everybody. And there is no need for an airport not to operate, provided those<br />
living around it are not harassed by the noise of such operation. Those living<br />
around Tullamarine now, 1 believe, would not be so harassed, and it is our<br />
intention as a government that this airport should so operate, subject in the future<br />
to just this one qualification that the State authorities concerned see that there is<br />
not built up around the perimeter of this airport hcusing settlements which, in the<br />
future, might lead to great noise discomfort to those living in them.<br />
Having the airport, let us have a buffer zone around it, and it then<br />
will operate as an international airport should.<br />
Ladies and gentlement, 1 declare Melbourne Airport open and unveil<br />
the plaque which records the event. </p>
