Every year we work so hard getting ready for Christmas that the day can be over almost before we know it.</p>
<p>And then if you were up late at a church service, or up early opening presents, it can be one of the sleepiest afternoons of the year. </p>
<p>So it's always worth stopping to take it all in  -  to enjoy that feeling that âit should always be like thisâ. </p>
<p>For me, the most special thing about Christmas is the people I'm with.</p>
<p>Because it's a day we share with the people who are most important to us.</p>
<p>At Christmas, for at least one day, we can all live the life we'd most like to live: a life of loving kindness for those we care about most.</p>
<p>And this evening, we all know we are not alone, that we all have people to protect and trust, and we all have people who look to us to hope and persevere.</p>
<p>I know I speak for all Australians when I express a particular Christmas wish to all those who have to work today to take care of us.</p>
<p>Police and fire fighters, ambulance officers and nurses, emergency personnel, all the essential services which keep our cities and towns running.  And of course our troops abroad ... everyone who gives up their Christmas Day to make our Christmas Day possible. </p>
<p>Thank you for such a generous gift.</p>
<p>To all Australians, wherever you are and whoever you are with, I hope today at your place has been everything you hoped for. </p>
<p>Merry Christmas.</p>
