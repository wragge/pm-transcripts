TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP,<br />
DOORSTOP, HMAS BRISBANE, SINGAPORE, 25 SEPTEMBER 1992<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
J: Prime Minister, is it the case you wanted to join the<br />
Navy once?<br />
PMS As I said, I walked into the wrony recruiting door and<br />
joined the ALP instead, which iS probably a bit tougher<br />
I think.<br />
J: Prime Minister, you told a businessman today to put his<br />
money on you in the next election. The Liberals have<br />
already got some campaign ads out and thiey're focusing<br />
on you, saying you're a good bet to help them win.<br />
What's your rad ; lon to that?<br />
PM: They can focus on me and that's where the money will be<br />
as well I hope. But we'll leave the Liberal Party to<br />
its own devices, I'm quite happy to proselytise on the<br />
issues that matter to AUStralia, getting it reglonally<br />
set up well, set up properly in the region in which we<br />
live with the neighboure to whom we trade and the<br />
places where people have a genuine interest in us.<br />
That's what matters and not foresaking substance for<br />
the shadow.<br />
J: Are you concerned, however, that they're using your<br />
comments that this is the recession we had to have?<br />
PM; Who cares about them? I mean, you know.<br />
J: Will the Labor Party be running negative ads?<br />
PM: There's not an election campaign on. Let thum spend<br />
their money now, good on them.<br />
J. So itle still next year for the election, no election<br />
beforo Christmas?<br />
PMt It will be whenever it suits the Government.<br />

3: speaking about the American defence presence in the~<br />
Pacific. Do you thinkq there's any real dangor they are<br />
going to pull them back any further? Does this worry<br />
you?<br />
P14: No, i think that the notion of American withdrawal from<br />
, Subic Bay in the Phillipines means an American<br />
withdrawal from the region is not correct. Americans<br />
themselves have made the point about forward<br />
projections from Honolulu, from the West Coast Of the<br />
United States, from the deployment of its seventh<br />
Fleet. All that's true I think, D~ ut wnat we want is a<br />
closer commercial and institutional engagement by the<br />
United states in the region. And that's what'$<br />
Important, and I think that that brings automatically a<br />
continuing strategic engagement in an area to a level<br />
that people are comfortable with. because the United<br />
States has provided a terribly stable environment for<br />
this region, has given a composure to the region it<br />
wouldn't have had. So that's why institutions like<br />
. APECQ ax iaipvrtant to involve the United States to make<br />
it confident about Itself in things other than defence,<br />
and to be here as people want them here.<br />
JS Primt, Minister, you repeated the message this morning<br />
that you gave in Japan and that is you want Asian<br />
business people in particular to update their image of<br />
Australia._ Do you think that message is getting<br />
through to business people here?<br />
PM:. I think so. I think the people to people contact anld<br />
the obvious business growth that Is already occurring<br />
and most particularly the . gzwth in trade., the exports<br />
to Singapore and the region and the imports to<br />
Australia, people now understand that Australia is an<br />
open place, that Australia made the change in the<br />
It's saved Itself in the ' 80s from being an economy<br />
that was basically unproductive and couldn't pay for<br />
its imports. it has now made that change, it's now got<br />
to consolidate the change and they want to be part of<br />
the consolidation. They think we're stable, that we're<br />
good-natured, that we do things cleverly and<br />
productively, and we do, so this is the natural place<br />
for us to be.<br />
3: Prime Minister, are you going to be talking to any<br />
Khmner Rouge representatives here?<br />
PMt I don't think so.<br />
3: How concerned are you about the peace process in<br />
Cambodia? TEL </p>
<p>TEL: 25. Sep. 92 17: 18 No. 017 P. 03/ 03<br />
3<br />
PM; I think the time to ask me about that is probably this<br />
time tomorrow after I've had some chance to talk to<br />
people there. But it's obviously a concern to us, it's<br />
Ihe one great chance for a peaceful settlement in<br />
Cambodia, and obviously the faster the Xhmer Rouge come<br />
on board the process in an enthusiactic way the better<br />
it will be accomplished, the better off everyone in<br />
Cambodia will be.<br />
Js Prime Minister, you are having talks later with<br />
Singapote Airlines, and earlier this week Ralph Willis<br />
announced that thK Govertment would be helping to buy<br />
Up more of the debt, You're obviously concerned about<br />
the sale price?<br />
PM; These are oll commercial matters. Qantas is 4 great<br />
franchise and it will command an important price. But<br />
we want good strategic partnerships because we don't<br />
want it simply being just a regional carrier, we want<br />
to see it have a greater potential. So choosing one's<br />
partner in this respect is going to be important. And<br />
while the great budy of stock will be held by the<br />
Australian people, the trategic airline partnerships<br />
are going to be terribly important to Qantas' future.<br />
So Singapore Airlines is interested, it's an obvious<br />
suitor, if I could put it that way. And we'll seO what<br />
it&amp; pitch is.<br />
ends </p>
