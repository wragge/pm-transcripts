TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING<br />
DOORSTOP, DARLING HARBOUR CONVENTION CENTRE, SYDNEY<br />
JANUARY 199,)<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
J: The polls are good for you, Prime Minister.<br />
PM: Polls come every week almost, in Australia.<br />
J: Mr Keating, Dr Hewson has talked about your credibility on social justice issues.<br />
He said that you don't have any.<br />
PM: That's about as believable when you have a Liberal leader saying, a Liberal<br />
leader who wants to smash Medicare, who wants to take $ 10 billion out of outlays,<br />
and mostly social outlays, who was happy to see three kids in ten complete<br />
secondary school in the early 1980s, who believes that if we help the poor we drag<br />
the rest of us down, for somebody sharing those views to say of a Labor<br />
Government with an unparalleled record in social reform that we don't have a<br />
notion of social justice, barely warrants a response.<br />
J: There are a million people out of work and we've got a $ 150 billion foreign debt<br />
bill.<br />
PM: But what we have is one of the finest social wage and safety nets in the world, the<br />
one thing that Dr Hewson is dedicated to tearing down. One of the reasons why<br />
this society is as cohesive as it is, even through stress times, is that the<br />
Government has in place a social security system which can equal anything in the<br />
world. It is that system which Dr Hewson wants to put upon a frontal attack.<br />
J: How close are you to making a decision about the election date?<br />
PM: I get asked about that every day, don't I? </p>
<p>J: minimising his tax, Dr Hcwson's minimisation?<br />
PM: I saw that today. I only know what I've read, and if what we've read is true it's for<br />
Dr Hewson to say what he has done in these respects. But if it is true, he does<br />
seem to have a penchant for 15 per cent tax rates, does he not?<br />
J: Hewson's assessment that official reserves are run down?<br />
PM: Are you from Knight Ridder or something are you? Good bye.<br />
ends </p>
