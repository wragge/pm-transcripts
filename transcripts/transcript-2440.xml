FOR PRESS: PM No. 69/ 1971<br />
TRAINING ASSISTANCE FOR SINGAPORE<br />
Statement by the Pr.' s Minister, Mr. William McMahon<br />
Singapore has recently asked for training assistance in<br />
Australia for certain of its Armed Forces. The Australian Government<br />
has been considering the request this week and, in accordance with its<br />
long-standing policy of assisting the build-up of the defence capabilities<br />
of both Malaysia and Singapore in the Five Power context, has agreed<br />
in principle to allow the use of training facilities.<br />
The Government is proposing that Singapore send a<br />
technical team to Australia to make an on-the-spot evaluation of the<br />
facilities which could be provided and to discuss practical aspects<br />
including logistics and maintenance. Firm details would then be<br />
worked out. The facilities would be provided at existing Australian<br />
defence installations and the types of training under consideration are<br />
field and anti-aircraft artillery, air weapons and armoured vehicles.<br />
