STATEMENT BY THlE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
BACKGROUND STATEMENT TO THE MEETING ON YOUTH T RAINING<br />
AND EMPLOYMENT 22 JULY 1992<br />
INTRODUCT[ ON<br />
Youth unempLoynient is too high. It is unacceptable in a society like ours which prides<br />
itself on adherence to values of equality and opportunity. It is why I have committed<br />
myself, and this Government, to the fight against unemployment. And in this discussion<br />
it is important to remember that our economic success is inseparable from our social<br />
success. Indeed, any economic measures we take must be a means to an end, that end<br />
being a fairer society.<br />
Any lasting solution to this problem must take account of the broader changes to thejyouth<br />
labour market which have been occurring since at least the 1960s. Over the last 30 years<br />
economic, social and technological changes have radically transformed the types of jobs<br />
for which young people are competing. But the manner in which we prepare our young<br />
people for employment has not kept pace with these changes.<br />
We must put in place new arrangements which better prepare young people for the world<br />
of work. Fundamentally, the ages of 15 to 19 must be seen more as a time of vocational<br />
preparation. The National Meeting on Youth Training and Employment, which I am convening on<br />
Wednesday 22 July, will tackle both the longer term issue of assisting young people to<br />
make the transition from school to work and the immediate issue of how best to help<br />
young people who are currently unemployed obtain work. The calibre of the participants<br />
in the meeting, and the quality of the submissions which have been received, bodes well<br />
for a fruitful discussion.<br />
As I have said before, youth unemployment is a national problem, and the solution will<br />
require commitment from all. T'he value of Wednesday's meeting is that it will bring<br />
together young people, employers, unions, community groups and governments. We will<br />
all benefit from the different perspectives and the opportunity to discuss the issues<br />
together. </p>
<p>This background statement sets out a framework for understanding and tackling the issues<br />
surrounding the training and employment of young people, including the problem of<br />
youth unemployment. These ideas will be discussed at Wednesday's meeting along with<br />
the ideas and proposals of other participants. I will announce specific measures in these<br />
areas next week after the Government has carefully considered the views canvassed at<br />
Wednesday's meeting.<br />
Although this statement and Wednesday's meeting focus on youth unemployment, the<br />
Government recognises that the problems facing other unemployed people are just as<br />
important. The problems of the long-term unemployed are particularly pressing. We are<br />
currently considering ways of addressing the general unemployment problem and<br />
measures wilbe announced in the Budget next month.<br />
The Changinir Nature of the Youth Labour Market<br />
There are 1,317,000 young people aged 15-19 years. Of these, 857,000 are in full-time<br />
education, 240,000 are in full-time employment and 124,000 are unemployed and<br />
looking for full-time work.<br />
It is important to understand that the structure of the youth labour market has changed<br />
dramatically over the last 30 years. During the 1960s, only about one-third of young<br />
people completed 12 years of schooling. Most teenagers left school early, and obtained an<br />
unskilled job. These early school leavers received little formal vocational training unless<br />
they were able to obtain an apprenticeship in one of the traditional trades.<br />
However the number of jobs suitable for young, unskilled workers has been falling<br />
continuously, from around 600,000 in 1966 to around 240,000 now. In the mid 1960s,<br />
nearly six in ten 15-19 year olds had a full time job. This now stands at two in ten. On<br />
the other side of the coin, thirty years ago only one in three 15-19 year olds were<br />
attending education full time, compared to almost two in three now.<br />
The shrinking of the teenage full-time labour market is associated, primarily, with<br />
changes in technology, changes in the way in which work is organised and changes in the<br />
industrial structure of our economy. The occupations in which the largest reductions in<br />
job opportunities for young people have occurred illustrate this point. They include<br />
clerical workers, typists, telephone operators, postal workers, bookkeepers and cashiers.<br />
Most of these tasks are now handled by computers or advanced communications<br />
technology. In other occupations, such as nurses, draftspeople and technicians, rising qualification<br />
levels, often associated with technological change, mean that these jobs are no longer<br />
open to early school leavers. </p>
<p>Greater use by employers of contractors to provide specific services has also had an<br />
impact on the number of unskilled jobs available for young people. For example the<br />
growth in courier services means that there are fewer ' messenger boys' hired.<br />
It is important to appreciate that these changes are associated with improvements in<br />
productivity. Thecy have been necessary for Australian industry to compete on world<br />
markets and to provide high quality services to Australian consumers. But new<br />
technologies and structural change create new, more interesting and more highly skilled<br />
jobs. The challenge is to ensure that young people receive the education and training that<br />
they need to be able to perform these new jobs.<br />
A more highly trained workforce can also encourage technological change and<br />
productivity growth. Workers with higher levels of skills are better able to implement and<br />
adapt new processes in the workplace.<br />
While the loss of full-time jobs for young people has been occurring since the 1960s, the<br />
decline has been particularly acute during the recessions of the early 1970s, early 1980s<br />
and now. In understanding the reasons for this, it is interesting that the Reserve Bank<br />
Bulletin states The recent deterioration of the youth labour market does not seem to be<br />
due to any change in their relative wage levels, which have been declining steadily since<br />
the mid-1970s'.<br />
it is apparent that, while the number of jobs increases slightly during the recovery, the<br />
previous employment levels are not regained.<br />
During a recession, the need to cut costs becomes even more pressing and employers<br />
introduce measures to enhance productivity. For understandable reasons, employers are<br />
more likely to lay off more recent recruits than long-standing employees. These factors<br />
impact across age groups but invariably reduce youth employment opportunities. During<br />
the recovery, employers are looking for skilled employees who can operate effectively in a<br />
more productive environment. The unskilled, young job seeker is not sought out for<br />
hiring. in this context, it is important to note that the number of young people employed as<br />
apprentices have actually regained pre-recession levels during the mid 1970s and mid<br />
1980s. It appears that these structured training arrangements which combine employment<br />
and of-h-o -training, and which have the strong support of employers, offer protection<br />
against the long term decline in teenage employment. If these structured training<br />
arrangements are extended into a wider range of industries, more young people will<br />
receive this protection.<br />
A Period of Vocational PeWaration<br />
We must understand these trends and build on them in developing our response to youth<br />
unemployment. </p>
<p>The ful-time unskilled jobs for young people are fast disappearing and, in any case, they<br />
consigned young people to a life without stimulating work and without high levels of<br />
remuneration. We need our young people to become our brightest and best workers, capable of<br />
mastering new technologies and applying them in innovative ways which will give<br />
themselves and Australian industry an edge.<br />
To meet this challenge we now must view the later teenage years as a period of vocational<br />
preparation. Vocational preparation means that young people, through their education and training<br />
experiences, acquire the knowledge, the self-confidence, and the proficiency in both key<br />
employment competencies and specific vocational skills, to find interesting employment<br />
and be in a position to upgrade their skills throughout their working life.<br />
In the world of work which Australia's young people are now entering, skill acquisition<br />
will be a life long process. Over the last 30 years we have seen some skills become<br />
obsolete. We have also seen many new areas of knowledge and skill become common<br />
place. All indications are that the pace of such change will become more rapid.<br />
Thec education and training of young people must prepare them for this change, in part by<br />
a strong emphasis on generic comnpetencies and skills, rather than skills specific to a<br />
particular technology. Further, their training must be formally recognised and accredited<br />
so as to facilitate future skills upgrading and mobility.<br />
There has already been a substantial shift of 15-19 year olds from employment to<br />
education and training. When this Government came to office, 36 per cent of young<br />
people who started secondary school stayed on to complete Year 12. That proportion has<br />
steadily increased and last year over 70 per cent twice as many as in 1982 completed a<br />
full secondary schooling.<br />
This is a dramatic increase in the proportion of young people staying on to Year 12.<br />
Because of an equivalent increase in Commonwealth funding, a large proportion close<br />
to 40 per cent of these Year 12 graduates currently make the transition from school to<br />
university. In 1983 there were 335,000 Australian students attending universities. Last year there<br />
were about 500,000, an increase of 165,000, the equivalent of 17 new medium-sized<br />
institutions in 8 years. Commonwealth funding for higher education places is expected to<br />
increase by 50 per cent between 1983 and 1994. We will be spending a total of $ 13<br />
billion on higher education over the 1992-94 triennium.<br />
However, each year around 130,000 young people, about half of all school-leavers, leave<br />
school and enter the workforce without undertaking any further education and training; </p>
<p>only 15 per cent of girls go on to training, in part because of the narrow range of<br />
occupations which offer apprenticeships. This group receives virtually no formal<br />
vocational preparation. They face limited employment prospects and are more likely to<br />
experience unemployment. It is this group, to date largely ignored by the post-school<br />
education system, that we need to focus on.<br />
The increased participation in secondary and higher education cannot be explained as<br />
young people ' in retreat from the recession'. The increases have occurred throughout the<br />
boom years of the 1980s.<br />
These are dramatic figures, testimony to the Government's commitment to education and<br />
representative of a fundamental social change to the way in which Australians participate<br />
in education.<br />
Some sceptics regard the increased emphasis on education and training merely as a means<br />
of ' keeping the kids off the streets'. This is not so.<br />
In ' The Competitive Advantage of Nations', Michael Porter of the Harvard Business<br />
School argues that ' Education and training constitute perhaps the single greatest longterm<br />
leverage point available to all levels of government in upgrading industry'.<br />
He goes on to say that while ' improving the general education system is an essential<br />
priority... as important is setting policies that link the education system to industry and<br />
encourage industry's own efforts at training'.<br />
clearly we have a long way to go in getting industry and educational institutions together<br />
to produce the type of education and training which will maximise the opportunities for<br />
young people while meeting the needs of business. The Government's emphasis in recent<br />
years on reform of vocational education and entry level training reflects the urgency of<br />
this task.<br />
in response to this increased emphasis on training, some people ask ' training for what?'<br />
They do not see the link between training and a job. A recent CAI discussion paper<br />
provides a very clear answer to this question. Among the most important reasons given by<br />
employers on why they are often reluctant to employ young people, three factors stand<br />
out: lack of maturity<br />
skill levels too low<br />
lack of relevant training<br />
Each of these barriers which employers see to employing more young people can be<br />
addressed by ensuring that high quality vocational preparation, developed by and in<br />
conjunction with industry, is available to young people who do not attend university. </p>
<p>High levels of vocational training give young people a much better chance of obtaining<br />
employment. In May 1991, the unemployment rate for those aged 20-24 years who did<br />
not complete the highest level of secondary school was 21 per cent. In contrast, for those<br />
aged 20-24 years who had a trade qualification the unemployment rate was 9.2 per cent<br />
and for those with a degree it was 7.6 per cent.<br />
Reform of Vocational Education and Traifing<br />
The education and training systems in successful industrialised countries include the<br />
following characteristics:<br />
high educational standards;<br />
the majority of students receive education and training with some practical<br />
orientation; there are respected and high quality forms of tertiary education in addition to the<br />
universities.<br />
Australia's schools and universities offer education of a high international standard. The<br />
level of participation of our young people in universities also compares favourably with<br />
that of other nations. However, the weak link in our system is vocational education and<br />
training, especially in terms of the limited size of the sector.<br />
While school retention rates were rising and higher education was undergoing sustained<br />
growth, participation rates in TAFE the major public provider of vocational education<br />
and training actually fell slightly between 1983 and 1990.<br />
While the number of young people ( 15 to 24 years old) with university degrees rose by 43<br />
per cent between 1983 and 1991, the number with trade qualifications fell by eleven per<br />
cent. The limitations of our existing vocational education and training system, particularly<br />
compared to that of other countries, is also stark. On one measure, in Germany around<br />
per cent of immediate post-compulsory education and training places are represented by<br />
vocational preparation. In Australia it is only 20 per cent.<br />
Apprenticeships dominate the existing vocational preparation options for young people in<br />
Australia. They accounted for around six in ten vocational preparation places in the late<br />
1980s. Full-time attendance at TAFE represented slightly less than three in ten.<br />
Although the current apprenticeship arrangements have the advantages of effectively<br />
combining work and vocational training and providing some protection against the<br />
decline in teenage jobs, they also have a number of shortcomings. In particular, the </p>
<p>close interaction between industry and vocational education and training<br />
providers, to ensure that the training system operates within a strategic plan that<br />
reflects industry's needs and priorities;<br />
an effective training market, with public and private provision of both high level,<br />
advanced technical training and further education opportunities for the workforce<br />
and for the community generally;<br />
an efficient and productive network of publicly funded providers that can compete<br />
effectively in the training market;<br />
increased opportunities and improved outcomes for individuals and target groups,<br />
including school Icavers, to enhance their employment outcomes; and<br />
improved cross-sectoral links between schools, higher education and vocational<br />
education and training.<br />
To achieve these objectives, the Commonwealth has been working with the States to<br />
develop a new national model for vocational education and training for this country. Only<br />
through a national approach can a country of just 17 million people hope to equip its<br />
young people with the skills necessary to make their way in an increasingly competitive<br />
world economy. Skills and education along with our great natural resources are what will<br />
bring secure prosperity to this country.<br />
Upgrading vocational education and training requires national leadership and direction.<br />
And it must also be cooperative because the States and Territories are the main providers<br />
of TAFE services.<br />
That is why the Commonwealth and States set out to progress a national approach to<br />
vocational education and training with such urgency after last month's Premiers'<br />
Conference here in Canberra.<br />
Turning to the third area where reform is needed, entry level training, the Carmichael<br />
Rport provides an approach which has been broadly endorsed by governments, unions<br />
and business.<br />
The Report outlines a simpler and more coherent system of entry level training which is<br />
based on competence achieved rather than time served; which builds on the strengths of<br />
the current training arrangements, while discarding their inefficiencies and rigidities; is<br />
flexible in its organisation with an expanded range of options; and is relevant to and<br />
substantially delivered by industry itself.<br />
The Report proposes that a number of distinct pathways be developed between school and<br />
work with each pathway giving students the opportunity to acquire the knowledge which<br />
all young people need to participate effectively in life and the workplace. These so called<br />
' key competencies' include language and communication, using mathematics, scientific </p>
<p>occupational and industrial coverage is very limited. Compared to countries like<br />
Germany, there is a substantial absence of structured training arrangent for young<br />
people in the service industries. Yct these are the strongly growing industries in which<br />
two-thirds of teenage employment is concentrated.<br />
Concern has also been expressed about the quality and relevance of training provided<br />
through apprenticeships, particularly in terms of the on-the-job training and its<br />
integration with off-the-job study. Certain rigidities also mean that the arrangements do<br />
not always best meet the needs of either the apprentice or the employer.<br />
it is generally agreed that Australia needs to expand its vocational education and training<br />
system so that all young people are assisted in making the transition from school to work.<br />
We also need to improve the quality, so that training places are in strong demand from<br />
both students and employers. In order to improve access, we must provide more flexible<br />
pathways which meet the varying needs of different groups of young people. In this<br />
context, it is necessary to look at schools, TAFE and entry level training arrangements.<br />
There is an emerging interest, both here and overseas, in building structured learning in<br />
the work place into the later years of school. In Australia, with the great increase in<br />
participation to the end of secondary school, educationalists, employers and young people<br />
are recognising the importance of developing a wider range of options in the final years of<br />
school, and in particular, the building of stronger linkages between school and work. A<br />
pilot of this type of arrangement, the TRAC program in the Hunter Valley, has been<br />
operating for some time, organised by the Dusseldorp Skills Forum. The model ' combines<br />
accredited learning in school, in work places, in TAFE and in off-the-job training and<br />
occurs within a broad State-wide curriculum and certification framework.' I understand<br />
that a number of State and Territory school systems are considering introducing programs<br />
based on these principles in the near future.<br />
For too long, TAJFE has been considered the ' poor relation' of the education system. It has<br />
suffered from reduced State Government funding in times of budgetary restraint; image<br />
problems in the wider community where it is often viewed as a last choice option; and<br />
barriers to the accreditation of its courses into higher education.<br />
The Government agrees with the recommendations of the Deveson and Finn Committees<br />
that the time has come to revitalise vocational education. The Government is determined<br />
that Australia will have a vocational education and training system which would promote<br />
the following: a national vocational education and training system, with agreed objectives and<br />
priorities, assured funding arrangements, consistent national strategies and a<br />
network of providers delivering high quality, nationally recognised programs at<br />
the State and local level; </p>
<p>and technological understanding, cultural understanding, problem solving and personal<br />
and interpersonal skills.<br />
The new system would include structured training arrangements for the transition from<br />
school to work, including a part-time work and part-time study option for those who<br />
leave before completing Year 12. It would also provide structured training for those who<br />
complete Year 12 and do not proceed to higher education. Schools, TAFE, private<br />
training providers and industry would all have a role in the new system.<br />
Apprenticeships and traineeships would be merged into the new system, allowing for<br />
more flexible arrangements.<br />
The Report also proposes a new approach to training wages and allowances. Unlike youth<br />
wages, which are based solely on age, trainee wages would be based on the level of<br />
competence attained, the amount of time spent on-the-job in structured training or<br />
productive work and the value of the competencies demonstrated by the trainee on-thejob.<br />
For trainees who are in part-time work and part-time formal training, and whose<br />
wage is below the level of the independent AUSTUDY rate, currently $ 117 a week, the<br />
Report proposes that a top-up allowance be provided by government.<br />
This new proposed system offers many benefits to young people. More flexible pathways<br />
and a broad industry coverage would ensure access to vocational preparation, even for<br />
those who have traditionally missed out, namely young people who leave school early and<br />
especially females. Accredited training would guarantee that skills acquired would be<br />
widely recognised and transferable. The shift to competency based training would mean<br />
that the length of training reflected the abilities and prior learning of the individual.<br />
Finally, the close involvement of industry in developing and implementing the training<br />
package would mean that young people would be in strong demand because their training<br />
would reflect employment opportunities and the needs of industry.<br />
At the same time, the Carmichael proposals offer many potential benefits to employers.<br />
Their close involvement would ensure high quality training responsive to the needs of<br />
industry. The suggested training wage would mean that the costs of training was shared<br />
among the trainee, the employer and the Government in a way which reflected the<br />
productive value of the trainee at any point in time. Most importantly, the new system<br />
should produce young employees who are well trained in key competencies and<br />
vocational skills, and who would form the basis of the skilled work force.<br />
Implementing these new arrangements would require the commitment of all parties.<br />
Governments would need to provide the additional places in formal training, accelerate<br />
the development of the national training system and provide income support. Employers<br />
would need to be closely involved in developing training plans for their industry or<br />
enterprise and would need to offer training jobs. Young people would be paid training<br />
wages which took account of competencies attained and time spent in accredited training.<br />
And unions would need to be involved in developing the wage and training packages. </p>
<p>The changeover to the new system of entry level training will take place through a series<br />
of pilot projects to be implemented across a broad range of industries as well as in TAFE<br />
and upper secondary schools. The pilots will form the basis of the new system.<br />
There is a high level of interest in participating in these pilots. A range of industries and a<br />
number of State and Territory Governments are currently developing proposals.<br />
The finalisation of new entry level training across all industries will take time. In the<br />
inteimn, there is the possibility of putting in place improved training arrangements which<br />
would represent progress towards the implementation of the Carmichael proposals. The<br />
Government is keen to discuss this possibility.<br />
While the reform of entry level training is a substantial challenge, the rewards can be<br />
enormous. The provision of vocational preparation through closer links between<br />
schooling and the world of work, the expansion and upgrading of TAFE and the<br />
introduction of the Carmichael proposals would mean that we, as a nation, could meet the<br />
target set by the Finn Committee. That is, by 2001, at least 95 per cent of 19 year olds<br />
should have completed Year 12 or an initial post-school qualification, or still be<br />
participating in formally recognised education or training.<br />
TraInInif nd Employment Assistance for Unemployed Young People<br />
The medium term solution to youth unemployment lies not only in economic growth but<br />
also in the expansion and upgrading of vocational education and training and in the<br />
implementation of the Carmichael proposals. However, the Government also wishes to<br />
focus on the lot of those young people who are currently unemployed and whose teenage<br />
years have preceded the transition proposed by the Carmichael recommendations.<br />
Currently, 124,000 15 to 19 year olds are looking for full-time work. Just over half of<br />
these unemployed teenagers are looking for their first job. The teenage unemployment<br />
rate is highest among 16 year olds ( almost one-halo and progressively decreases with age<br />
( among 19 year olds, around one-quarter).<br />
While the youth unemployment rate is higher than that for adults, young people<br />
experience relatively shorter spells of unemployment. The median unemployment<br />
duration is 19 weeks for 15 to 19 year olds compared to 26 weeks for all ages. Among the<br />
124,000 teenage unemployed seeking full-time work, around 27,000 have been<br />
unemployed for more than 12 months.<br />
Commonwealth labour market programs assisted around 60,000 unemployed teenagers in<br />
1991-92 or around 17 per cent of total labour market program approvals. This compares<br />
with their share of CES registrants of 15 per cent. Another 10,000 teenagers were also<br />
assisted through Commonwealth funded TAFE prevocational courses. </p>
<p>The main types of labour market assistance for young people comprise community-based<br />
assistance and training through SkillShare ( 30% private sector wage subsidies under<br />
JOBSTART and short-term vocational courses through JOBTRAJN The<br />
success rates in finding jobs after participation in these programs is generally similar for<br />
young people as for adults and in both cases are well above the experience of nonparticipants.<br />
The proportion of young labour market program participants in unsubsidised<br />
employment or further education and training three months after the end of their<br />
placement is highest among JOBSTART participants followed by SkillShare<br />
and JOBTRAIN<br />
in addressing the problems of unemployed young people, it is important that measures are<br />
consistent with the strategy of equipping young people with the vocational and general<br />
skills necessary for a productive and satisfying life. Unemployed young people should<br />
not miss out on mainstream training and vocational preparation.<br />
The recession has seen a sharp decline in the number of apprenticeship and traineeship<br />
commencements. Policies which address this decline, including those announced in One<br />
Nation, provide young people with a job and recognised training and minimise the<br />
possibility of skill shortages during the recovery. The special measures in One Nation<br />
have already succeeded in bringing traineeship and apprenticeship commencements back<br />
towards their levels for the same period in 1990. But there is still further to go if we are to<br />
avoid skill shortages as the economy recovers.<br />
it is also important that the most disadvantaged young people do not miss out on<br />
vocational preparation opportunities to improve their chances of getting a job. In<br />
particular, special attention should be given to long-term unemployed young people to<br />
ensure they have access to training and assistance into employment.<br />
The Government realises that unless training is followed by, or integrated with,<br />
employment, the skills acquired quickly atrophy. This problem would be lessened if<br />
vocational training were more closely linked with employment possibilities at the end of<br />
the training course. This would also increase the interest of the young unemployed in<br />
undertaking training.<br />
It is also important to provide a range of measures to meet the differing needs of<br />
unemployed young people. While some will be attracted to longer, more formal TAFE<br />
courses, other will prefer shorter courses, particularly where these are provided in a<br />
community based envirornent such as SkillShare.<br />
Other young people will prefer more hands on work experience as has been suggested by a<br />
number of conservation groups and State governments. There is a great opportunity here<br />
to address two areas of need. Young people would be able to obtain work with relevant<br />
training and through their endeavours contribute to creating a better environment, for<br />
example by tackling the problem of land degradation. </p>
<p>Homeless young people are among the most disadvantaged of unemployed young people<br />
and will require substantial assistance which links accommodation, counselling, training<br />
and work experience in order to bring them into mainstream employment opportunities.<br />
Some successful projects which provide this integrated assistance are operating ( eg the<br />
Brotherhood of St Laurence/ Body Shop project) and, with additional assistance, could be<br />
expanded and other projects commenced.<br />
Disproportionately high unemployment rates exist among Aboriginal and Torres Strait<br />
Islander young people. The Government's recent response to the Royal Commission into<br />
Aboriginal Deaths in Custody includes a five year package of measures, costing $ 54<br />
million, to assist Aboriginal young people in personal development, employment and<br />
sport and recreation.<br />
Young people from non-English speaking background communities, particularly the<br />
more recently arrved, also experience relatively high unemployment rates. On the other<br />
hand, I am pleased to see that they achieve proportionally high placements on labour<br />
market programs and achieve relatively high positive outcomes from this form of<br />
assistance. Our disability reforms have brought significant breakthroughs for young people with<br />
disabilities. There has been a particular focus on school to work transition. Through the<br />
Disability Services Act and initiatives such as the 1990 Disability Reform Package and the<br />
forthcoming Disability Discrimination legislation, the Government has been acting to<br />
remove barriers to participation by young people with disabilities in employment,<br />
education, training and community life.<br />
Initiatives have been introduced to provide increased opportunities for students with<br />
disabilities to participate in tertiary education, especially in professional and vocational<br />
courses, with a target of doubling commencing enrolments by 1995.<br />
CONCLUSION This background statement outlines the changes which have occurred in the education,<br />
training and employment profiles of young people. Thiese changes have given rise to both<br />
opportunities and problems for young people.<br />
Addressing these issues requires reform of the vocational education and training systems,<br />
as well as measures to tackle the immediate problem of youth unemployment.<br />
Wednesday's meeting will discuss ways of responding to these concerns. The<br />
Government is keen to hear the views of young people, employers, unions and community<br />
organisations.-We are committed to taking action. I will announce our detailed response<br />
