FOR PRESS 13 SEPTEMBER 1978<br />
SIR WILLIAM HUDSON<br />
Sir William Hudson's term of office as Commissioner of the<br />
Snowy Mountains Authority from 1949 to 1967, was an outstanding<br />
achievement. Starting from virtually nothing, Sir William built up and<br />
led an organisation responsible for Australia's biggest<br />
engineering project.<br />
The Snowy brought world-wide acclaim to Australia and stands<br />
as a fitting and lasting memorial to Sir William.<br />
As well as being one of the foremost members of the Civil<br />
Engineering profession, Sir William was a great leader. He<br />
welded together and inspired a highly efficient workforce<br />
recruited from many parts of the world. He will be<br />
affectionately remembered by all who worked with him.<br />
I extend my sympathy to Lady Hudson and her family.<br />
