Prime Minister Julia Gillard and Sports Minister Kate Lundy today announced funding of $2.5 million to the ACT Government for the installation of broadcast quality lighting at Manuka Oval in Canberra.</p>
<p>The announcement was made in the grounds of Manuka Stadium prior to the kick off of the inaugural Prime Minister's Cup AFL Match between the Greater Western Sydney Giants and the Western Bulldogs.</p>
<p>Manuka Oval has been a part of Canberra since 1929 and the upgrade will ensure the oval meets the high definition broadcast standards required to host elite sporting matches.</p>
<p>It will provide opportunities to attract new competitions, such as Twenty20, international cricket matches and pre season AFL games.</p>
<p>As a Senator for the ACT Minister Lundy, along with her ACT Labor colleagues, has been a constant campaigner for the necessary upgrades to Manuka Oval to encourage more elite sport to the nation's capital.</p>
<p>The upgrade will enhance Canberra's community infrastructure with the new lights designed to minimise light spill into surrounding residential and commercial areas.</p>
<p>The total cost of the lights is approximately $5 million with the remaining $2.5 million to be contributed by the ACT Government.</p>
<p>The Gillard Government is committed to local infrastructure projects and ensuring that communities have access to high quality facilities.  </p>
