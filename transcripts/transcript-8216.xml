PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH HOWARD SATTLER, RADIO 6PR<br />
28 NOVEMBER 1990<br />
2 AND OE PROOF ONLY<br />
SATTLER: Can you tell us what you told Mr Hand and Senator<br />
Bolkus? PMi Essentially I am in for the long haul.<br />
SATTLER: So you have put to rest the rumour., did you?<br />
PMs When you talk about the rumours this was a media beatup<br />
over there which had as much ( egisa the media were able to<br />
give it, it had no substance as far as the party was<br />
concerned. SATTLERt What started At<br />
PMs Well with a quiet period you are always at risk in<br />
_ politics ' when there is a couple of weeks break in the<br />
parliament, you know Graham Richardson said the dogs start<br />
barking a bit for no reason at all.<br />
SATTLER They get a bit panicky a few of them, do they?<br />
PM, ' Yes) and they had active imaginations. I mean I am not<br />
often i the past been compared with Margaret, but somehow or<br />
rather the Margaret Thatcher episode started to try and<br />
create analogies in their mind which were not really there.<br />
BATTLER: Do they talk to you about the opinion polls and how<br />
you are going to get them back up again.<br />
PMi What the two fellows who came to see to me?/<br />
SATTLER Yes.<br />
PMi No no no they were simply there to say you know a<br />
thousand percenLt support. </p>
<p>2. SATTLERs Yet they are left winger.<br />
PM: But lot 1me'say this that an far as my government is<br />
concerned the level of the cabinet, the ministry, the<br />
factional distinctions are not real. I mean you, the balance<br />
from the Left are making excellent contributions, I mean<br />
these two you mentioned Brian Hove without being exhaustive I<br />
moan as a ministry and a cabinet this government doesn't work<br />
in factional lines).<br />
SATTLER: It's also being said that some party members want<br />
you to make a definitive decision about how long you are in<br />
for exactly by roundabout the middle of next year. Will you<br />
be doing that?<br />
PM. I have already made that decision and that announcement,<br />
I will be taking the party into the next election.<br />
SATTLERs And others are saying well if you are going to take<br />
it into the next elections you should stay for a while after<br />
that. You shouldn't just ask to be elected then go.<br />
PMo Well you wouldn't go the next day would you but I mean<br />
what I have made quite clear now f or quite a long period of<br />
time in that after we win the next election I would think in<br />
that next period it would be time to think about making way<br />
for the successor then.<br />
SATTLER: But you wouldn't go two more elections would you?<br />
PM: No.<br />
BATTLER: You would want to play more golf.<br />
PM: Well one of my great-regrets about the quickness of this<br />
trip Howard is that we are not able to fit a game in. I<br />
would love to have had a game with you.<br />
SATTLER: I bet you would, you have heard about my form of<br />
late. PM: Mate only from you, you maid you are going out a bit but<br />
I know you are izmnaculate with the truth but you might have<br />
just been trying to set up a bet.<br />
BATTLERs Well Margaret Thatcher is gone and I think a lot of<br />
people would have thought that was unbelievable,, what about<br />
you? PMa Well this is not being wise after the event because I<br />
have had some discussion, with people after last April. I<br />
met her of course an you know Howard when I went over to<br />
Callipolli and I was struck then as I told my colleagues<br />
afterwards in the conversation how almost, distraught is not </p>
<p>PM: ( cont'd) the right word but how despairing she was about<br />
developmenti in Europe and her relationship to those<br />
developments. She gave me the impression that thing. had got<br />
away from her in regard to what was happening in EuropO and<br />
she despaired, that there was anything that she could do about<br />
it and when she adhered to her line on that against what wasn<br />
clearly the emerging view within her own party, it's not<br />
surprising to me that there came a showdown on that issue<br />
because it's, an absolutely fundamental question in British<br />
politics. Ia Britain going to be inside the movement and<br />
working to shape the future of Europe, or is it going to be<br />
as it where outside maying no no no# you can't have a more<br />
fundamental question than that and quite clearly the great<br />
majority of the Conservative Party had come to the conclusion<br />
that the former was the way to go and so it couldn't have had<br />
a more basic issue which I think in the end had to go to the<br />
question of leadership.<br />
BATTLERi What do you kcnow of her successor the British<br />
Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major, apart from the fact<br />
that you like: you he is a cricket fan and he could have<br />
played for Surrey if he had not had a bad car accident.<br />
PM. I met John Major at the Commonwealth Hfeads of Goverriment<br />
meeting year in Malaysia. I didn't have a great opportunity<br />
of dealing with him because of course at the prime minister<br />
level I was basically dealing with Margaret but I you know<br />
had a couple of conversations with him. I man it's too<br />
early in a pursonal sense for me to make judgement about him<br />
but obviously he has developed a pretty wide rang. of<br />
experience in the period that he has been in of fice and I<br />
believe that he will continue with what from Australia's<br />
point of view, is very important that is the very strong line<br />
that Margaret Thatcher took on the coimmon agricultural policy<br />
which is so devastating for Australian farmers. I mean I<br />
admired enormously the way she fought for our basic position<br />
on that with her european colleagues and I certainly hope and<br />
trust that John Major will continue to do that.<br />
SATTLERs Does it worry you that as a 16 year old he couldn't<br />
get a Job as a bus conductor because he couldn't add up.<br />
PM: Well I guess all of us develop through lifea, there are<br />
lots of us that couldn' t do certain things when we were 16<br />
but become a ' bit adept to them later on.<br />
BATTLERt: Well he has become the Chancellor of the Exchequer<br />
so he must have learnt something and also I guess it shows<br />
that treasurers can become leaders which for Mr Keating's<br />
point of view in the longer term is good new.<br />
PM: I don'tt' think Paul pins his chances of succession on<br />
John Major arid I have made it quite clear and I think the<br />
party accepts that when I do decide to stand down that it<br />
will be Paul. </p>
<p>4. SATTLERs Nov on the local f ront the ACTU secretary Bill<br />
Kelty is predicting a national unemployment level that will<br />
through the 8% barrier, I think it's about what 7.4% now.<br />
Do you agree with his prediction?<br />
PKa Remember Howard he wasn't saying that it was going to be<br />
there through, for long if it did-<br />
BATTLERs No no he said short term but would you agree with<br />
that? PM1 well it's possible it could I am not making any<br />
predictions about it. The important thing from a point of<br />
view of your listeners is that I remain convinced that the<br />
economy is going to recover in 1991. 1 have been saying that<br />
consistently and I think the evidence is there and I just<br />
noticed in today's paper. the business investment figures are<br />
up in a cheering sort of way so as your listeners know and I<br />
think they know me pretty well we have said we had to slow<br />
the economy down in the previous 12 months because we were<br />
Just operating at too high a level with pulling in too many<br />
imports. SATTLER: But you would agree there is still some short term<br />
pain to come, we have got Ford Australia and International<br />
Trucks Australia talking today about sacking another 1,000<br />
workers before Christmas. Do you think there will be some<br />
short term pain in the employment area?<br />
PM: There may still be some more short term pain in the<br />
employment area but the important thing is that when we go<br />
into the recovery phase next year it's going to be on an<br />
infinitely stronger basis than before.<br />
BATTLER: But not a boom.<br />
PM1 No as Australians we have got to avoid the boom and bust<br />
mentality because the problem is that we have got to build a<br />
situation where we can produce more in Australia to satisfy<br />
the demand that developed in this country because when we<br />
spill over from our domestic production into imports,<br />
satisfying our demand with imports then that exposes the<br />
unacceptable strains on our external account so we have got<br />
to all of us, business, workers and government for its part<br />
make sure that what we are doing is building up in this<br />
Country a production capacity which is going to be able to<br />
satisfy our own demands and build up our own external you<br />
know export capacity. That's the great challenge that faces<br />
this country Howard.<br />
BATTLER. You are pretty happy about the wages tax trade off<br />
last week aren't you? </p>
<p>PM: Yes I % no committed to that right f ram the beginning.<br />
When Paul camie around to see me to talk about what we were<br />
doing I said Paul you don't have to persuade me on this you<br />
would have to persuade me against it, against doing it and we<br />
were totally at one on that because it offers Australia<br />
Howard the real possibility of cementing into place a<br />
continued reduction in the inflation, in the basic inflation<br />
rate. What Australians are now enjoying and what with good<br />
management we can enjoy in the next year a situation where<br />
our inflation rate is coming down and the rest of the world<br />
basically is going up. That big gap that we have had Howard<br />
between our inflation rate and the rest of the world is<br />
narrowing enormously and that'sa to our advantage.<br />
SATTLERs But what would you say then to our Trades and Labor<br />
Council who have opposed the trade of f and they are saying<br />
this morning the money should have come from the employers<br />
not the surplus. How do you react to that?<br />
PM: Well tho important thing is that their standards that<br />
their disposable income, real disposable income be kept up.<br />
Now you can have your real disposable income kept up by a<br />
combination of what happen. to money wages, what happens to<br />
taxes and what happens to prices. So if in fact by operating<br />
through the tax side you can at least keep your disposable<br />
income up and at a lover inflation level than in the<br />
immediate and longer to= i that's much more to the advantage<br />
of their zoembers.<br />
BATTLERt And you don't send any more employers to the wall?<br />
PM. Well that's right. The community in a sense through the<br />
tax system is picking up that cost and that means you don't<br />
feed it into the inflation structure. That means that your<br />
competitive position, your capacity to employ people is<br />
increased. SATTLER; Yee I think what they are upset about is that they<br />
were not let in on the discussions before the agreement was<br />
made. PM: And I can understand that concern but where you have<br />
democratically elected leaders as the trade union movement<br />
does and they were elected right through up to leadership of<br />
the ACTU level, they have got to represent the trade union<br />
movement and 3: think your people here would know that in Bill<br />
Kelty and Martin Ferguson and the people there they have very<br />
capable and committed people of integrity. They didn't make<br />
this decision lightly.<br />
BATTLERs Now this morning you are to go into what could be<br />
termed a greenies den, the World Conservation union<br />
conference. Are you comfortable with your government's<br />
recent move, to encourage sustainable development in this<br />
country or do you think that for a while there your<br />
government gave the greenies too much latitude? </p>
<p>PM: It wasn never a question of giving the greenies too much<br />
latitude I have never approached this thing on the basis do I<br />
do this for then greens or do I no do this for the greens. I<br />
mean inevitably Howard you will appreciate, I am sure your<br />
listeners will that when you are confronted with a particular<br />
decision about a development project or about putting a<br />
particular area on the world heritage list it's going to be<br />
interpreted and read is this for the green. or against the<br />
greens. Now inevitably that's the way it will be interpreted<br />
but what I always try and do with my colleagues is to say<br />
well what is right for Australians today and what is right<br />
for ou~ r kids and our grand kids.* Now wrhere we have come down<br />
and made a decision which has been as it were pro<br />
environmental I have made that decision with my colleagues<br />
because I think that in best for Australia. There are other<br />
decisions I have made where for the same reason what I think<br />
is best for Australia the greenie. have come out and said<br />
what's Hawkie done now. You know they didn't like it so I am<br />
not the greenies man or the non gremnies man I am Australia's<br />
man and that's what you have got to do.<br />
SATTLERo Well I am sure you're aware the West Australian<br />
government has decided to allow mineral exploration in three<br />
of our national parks and three big ones at that, do you<br />
think the greenies have got a case in criticising that?<br />
PM: They will always criticise. I mean when you talk about<br />
the greenie. you have got to recognise there is no monolithic<br />
gree~ n M1Oveafent there are shades of opinion within it, shades<br />
of green if you want to put it that way and they are not all<br />
going to say about every decision the same thing.<br />
SATTLERi No I looked at the list of them going to this<br />
conference and there are about 20 or 30 different groups.<br />
PM Yes well that's right I mean it's a very large group<br />
some 3,000 people or something as I understand from all.<br />
around the world at it. But in regard to the decision over<br />
here I think what Carmen and the government ha. done is say<br />
well I think it's three out of sixty parks isn't it in which<br />
they'll allow mining.<br />
SATTLER: That's right.<br />
PM: And it will only in the end after exploration be allowed<br />
after the most careful scrutiny of it and if it is then<br />
allowed that particular part will be excised from the park so<br />
that in the end the part this will remain inviolate.<br />
SATTLERs Now West Australia to a degree embarrassed the<br />
Labor movement in Australia, Labor governments with a so<br />
called WA Incorporated and now at last a royal commission.<br />
Was that greeted with come relief over in Canberra? </p>
<p>7.<br />
PM Well let ma say two things about it Howard. The first<br />
is this that the conduct of the af fairs of government of a<br />
State are the responsibility of that state government and we<br />
as a federal government recognising the lines of jurisdiction<br />
that exist has sort either in regard to Western Australia or<br />
any Other State to intervene and say how they should conduct<br />
them. SATTLER; But politically it did impact on you didn't it?<br />
PM Ye. that's the first thing it doe. but secondly yes<br />
obviously Howard the dissatisfaction that existed over here<br />
in regard to what's christened WA Inc spilled over for us. I<br />
mean these sort&amp; of issues know no boundaries between federal<br />
and state I mean if a state government is going badly and<br />
it's of our political prsuasion# yes we will be hurt by it,<br />
in the same sense and let me fair about this if it's<br />
perceived that we are not going too well at a particular<br />
stage our statui colleagues will suffer. Now the second point<br />
that leads into is this that having said all those things I<br />
would say that the decision is a sensible one. While all the<br />
concern was there and people were going on and there was<br />
innuendo then it was a bit of a stinking dead cat which was<br />
hanging around their necks and wasn't going to go away so I<br />
would think that they have made the right decision but it was<br />
their decision for them to make.<br />
