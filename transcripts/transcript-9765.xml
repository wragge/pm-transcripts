    <content><![CDATA[<p>The announcement yesterday by the Marks Royal Commission of a wideningÂ of the range of issues on which it may make adverse findings against theÂ Minister for Human Services and Health, and the Western Australian LaborÂ MP, John Halden, has put an end to any credibility which this flawed andÂ unjust political inquisition might have had.</p>
<p>If the Commission wanted to widen its scope into fruitful areas, it might, forÂ example, have given itself the task of examining the inconsistencies inÂ Premier Courts account of how he obtained the Goldrock documents, whichÂ he handed to Penny Easton.</p>
<p>Was Richard Court not telling the truth when, according to the policeÂ transcript presented to the Royal Commission, he told the West AustralianÂ police in early 1990, far as the minutes go, the minutes didn't comeÂ from Withers. To my knowledge they just arrived and basically what didÂ with Withers is I just wanted to confirm whether this was correct.'?</p>
<p>Or was he not telling the truth on Tuesday when he told the RoyalÂ Commission itself, ' Mr Withers quite openly provided me with all of theÂ minutes of Goidrock's operations.'?</p>
<p>There are many other issues concerning the behaviour of Premier CourtÂ which, on the basis of Tuesday's evidence, the Royal Commission could haveÂ chosen to investigate.</p>
<p>That it has not done so, but rather has preferred to continue to operate withinÂ narrow terms of reference while widening the net of political allegationÂ against Carmen Lawrence, has ensured that any findings the Commission Â makes will be ignored by fair-minded people.</p>
<p>CANBERRA<br />22 SeptemberÂ 1995</p>
