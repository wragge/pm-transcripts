    <content><![CDATA[<p>***TRANSCRIPT INCOMPLETE DUE TO POOR AUDIO QUALITY***</p>
<p>(Inaudible)</p>
<p>...we weren't quite sure whether it was going to happen or not. But with a bit of perseverance and some help from our Dutch friends and allies, we're all here and we're all here in one piece.</p>
<p>More importantly we're here to actually have a yak with each one of you. The purpose of being here is very simple, very, very simple. And that is to you, the men and women of the Australian defence force, for me as Prime Minister of Australia to say thank you. Thank you, thank you, for what you're doing.</p>
<p>Now the country looks to what you do with pride and admiration. You know sometimes if you're stuck up here, you must think you're a long way from everybody and everyone's forgotten. Well I'm also here to say to you  -  we haven't forgotten.</p>
<p>We know what's going on here. We follow, as a Government, day by day, week by week in terms of what you're up to. And we've had that experience, that you've all had, which is saying goodbye to some of your mates.</p>
<p>And that's been tough. It's tough for you because they have been your mates. But you know something? It's been tough for their families - it's also been tough for the nation.</p>
<p>Australia feels it when we lose one of our men and women in uniform. They feel it, they feel it in their gut. They feel it in their heart.</p>
<p>I've been to too many funerals. I don't like going. But you know something? When we say goodbye to one of our own, the nation is united in a common purpose.</p>
<p>That is not just to honour what they've done but on top of it, to reaffirm to every person back home in Australia what they have done and what you are doing is important.</p>
<p>You know flying over this country coming here, you scratch your head a bit and say how is it for hundreds of years people have fought over this place? You scratch your head, don't you?</p>
<p>And it has been handed to the good people of Afghanistan; over the last several decades one wave of difficulty after another. Our job is to give them a fair shake. To give them a fair chance, to give them peace and opportunity.</p>
<p>You know when I speak to the Afghan community in Australia, and there is many of them, they, to a person, appreciate what we are doing here. (inaudible)</p>
<p>And here in this vast country, which has known such a bloody history, giving these people in Afghanistan a decent shake at their future. That is really important stuff. Cos' they haven't had much. It's been pretty bad.</p>
<p>The fact that in a year ahead, they can go to the ballot box and elect their own people to run their own country, that is an advance of centuries compared to where this place has been.</p>
<p>The fact that young girls in this country, rather than being denied any form of educational opportunity as declared under the Taliban, can now go to school. And have a decent chance in life. And be shown that there are pathways to their own personal future.</p>
<p>Men and women of the ADF are out there building bridges, building infrastructure, connecting one part of the country with, to another  -  that is progress.</p>
<p>The fact that you're out there, pushing the enemy back - step by step, mountain ridge by mountain ridge  -  that is progress. The fact that you're here also training, raising a force in partnership with our friends and allies  -  that is progress.</p>
<p>Have we got anywhere? Remind them of each one of those core facts. And remind them of what this place was like, this place, let's never forget that as well.</p>
<p>Our ally, the United States was attacked by a terrorist organisation Al Qaeda, which had as its training base, this country run by the Taliban. And we are a loyal ally of the United States said â€˜well, bugger that for a joke  -  we're in'. And we still are. And that is as it should be; standing up for your allies, invoking the formal obligation of the alliance with the United States.</p>
<p>And by denying the enemy the opportunity to use this country as a training base, as it was unfettered for Al Qaeda in the past, that also is progress.</p>
<p>Their ability as a terrorist organisation to reach out and wreak havoc and hell across the world, as they've done in the past, we've got a job as a community of civilised nations to deny them that opportunity. And that is what you are doing.</p>
<p>Christmas is coming and for those of you who are here and separated from your wives, your husbands, your partners, your girlfriends, your boyfriends, you mums, your dads, kids and grandparents and those who love you in the communities from which you come - I bring a message on behalf of each of them as well. And I've met a few of them in recent days. That is, they are proud of each and every one of you. Proud of what you're doing for Australia. Proud of what you're doing in this country.</p>
<p>It doesn't make it any easier to be apart from them at this time of year. I'm going to go home and spend Christmas with my wife and three kids and you're not. And I understand that that's hard.</p>
<p>But you know, at this time of year in particular, as the families of the nation settle down around a Christmas tree and share presents, the nation will be thinking of you as well.</p>
<p>But I've been thinking of you as well: exhibit A. I was told I could not bring you several cartons of beer.</p>
<p>[Laughter]</p>
<p>I was told I couldn't bring you several crates of beer. In fact I was told I couldn't bring you any beer at all. So, we left that to one side.</p>
<p>But there is a Test series coming up between ourselves and South Africa. And so we thought that the best way to provide some R and R and some encouragement for the Australian Test team was for you to, on camera, to show how it's done.</p>
<p>So here is a brand new, all bits and pieces attached, cricket set for this great group of men and women. Oh and girls, I expect you to be out in the field as well.</p>
<p>There is a further task, which is that by the end of your tour of duty, I expect you to have introduced the Dutch to the finer points of the game. It is part of our ongoing friendship and partnership with them.</p>
<p>But this is for you and it's my idea, so if you think it stinks you can blame me and not the CDF. Okay?</p>
<p>[Laughter]</p>
<p>But it is part of us giving you a bit of a Christmas present.</p>
<p>Today because it was a bit of a hassle getting here, and you may have heard some of the detail of what that involved, our time has been cut a little bit shorter than it would.</p>
<p>But I've got one interest in being here apart from saying thank you and that is to shake each of your hands and to have a yak about what is going on and about any extra stuff that you might need.</p>
<p>So to conclude, on behalf of a grateful nation, thanks for what you're doing. Have a really happy Christmas and keep safe. That's what the country wants  -  keep safe.</p>
