<p>Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payments (AGDRP) are now available to residents affected by the Wambelong bushfire in north-west New South Wales.</p>
<p>Eligible people in the Local Government Areas of Coonamble, Gilgandra and Warrumbungle can claim payments of $1,000 for each adult and $400 for each child.</p>
<p>These bushfires have had a devastating impact on some communities.</p>
<p>This is a very difficult time for many communities in New South Wales and these payments will assist individuals and families to get back on their feet.</p>
<p>People directly affected by the bushfires are urged to take advantage of this assistance.</p>
<p>The easiest way to lodge a claim is online at <a href="http://www.humanservices.gov.au/disasteror">www.humanservices.gov.au/disasteror</a> by calling the Australian Government Information Line on 180 22 66 from 8am to 8pm local time, seven days a week.  Completed claim forms can also be lodged in person at a Commonwealth Department of Human Services service centre. </p>
<p>This assistance is over and above the support provided by the Australian and New South Wales Governments under the jointly funded Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements (NDRRA).</p>
<p>The Commonwealth Government will work closely with the New South Wales Government to ensure communities have all the assistance they require.</p>
<p>Further information on Australian Government assistance is available online at <a href="http://www.disasterassist.gov.au">www.disasterassist.gov.au</a>.</p>
