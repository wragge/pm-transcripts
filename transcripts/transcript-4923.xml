JjAUSTRALIA<br />
FOR PRESS 10 DECEMBER, 1978<br />
ELECTORATE TALK<br />
This Parliamentary year has been notable in many respects.<br />
First, it has been characterised by an Opposition preoccupied<br />
with personalities. They have failed to make realistic<br />
attempts to present and argue alternate policies as<br />
an Opposition should. In this they are led by a man who<br />
talks gloom at every possible opportunity, both inside and<br />
outside the Parliament.<br />
Australians expect the Opposition in the Federal Parliament<br />
to present reasoned argument on important national issues<br />
and to offer costed alternatives. Australians are bored<br />
with the peripheral politics now a hallmark of the Labor<br />
Party under its present leadership.<br />
Although the Opposition sought to distract the nation and<br />
the Parliament from the business of good administration,<br />
the Government has been getting on with the job.<br />
In Parliament this year 211 Bills were passed. The range<br />
of Bills demonstrates in the plainest terms the Government's<br />
desire to act in the interests of all Australians.<br />
Legislation has been passed against tax avoidance in a<br />
number of areas. The Treasurer is continuing to act<br />
swiftly and forcefully against tax avoidance schemes. Your<br />
Government has shown its determination to stamp out abuse of<br />
the taxation laws.<br />
Australian industry has been supported. Legislation to give<br />
greater incentive to industrial research and development has<br />
been passed. An Export Expansion Grant Scheme has been<br />
introduced and the Export Market Development Grant Scheme<br />
has been revitalised.<br />
Perhaps the most significant Bill passed this year was the<br />
legislation providing for the development of Australia's<br />
great uranium resources. This legislation demonstrated in<br />
the starkest way the Government's determination to protect<br />
the environment and the rights of our Aboriginal people.<br />
It also demonstrated the Government's awareness of its<br />
international obligation to provide a key energy source<br />
for an energy-short world. </p>
<p>-2<br />
Decisions were taken that protect Australians against<br />
disruption caused by industrial unrest.<br />
Farmers, experiencing their best seasons for up to<br />
years, now have the facilities of the Primary Industry<br />
Bank for long-term funds at attractive interest rates.<br />
Since opening for business early last month, the Bank<br />
has approved loans totalling more than $ 10 million.<br />
This year, the setting up of the Australian Science and<br />
Technology Council and implementation of a number of<br />
important new policy decisions in relation to the CSIRO<br />
reaffirms our commitment to the development of scientific<br />
research. The Bills arising out of this year's Budget give effect to<br />
the Government's economic management. We have maintained<br />
control on Government expenditure. At the same time, our<br />
commitment to helping those Australians not able to help<br />
themselves remains a continuing high priority for the Government.<br />
In many areas of specific need Government payments were<br />
substantially increased. We raised spending on aged, invalid<br />
and widow's pension and supporting parents benefits by<br />
11 1/ 2 percent and increased spending on pensioner housing<br />
by 40 percent. Assistance to organisations providing facilities<br />
for the handicapped increased by 37 percent and the<br />
handicapped child's allowance was extended to students under<br />
who did not receive an invalid pension.<br />
In the case of home care for the aged even though the subsidy<br />
rate was varied to meet greatly ' increased demand total<br />
spending will increase 14 percent to over $ 10 million. That<br />
makes a rise of 83 percent in home care for the aged in the<br />
last three Budgets.<br />
So despite the Opposition's attempt to immerse the Parliament<br />
in personality politics, the Government has pressed ahead<br />
with reforms that provide increased opportunities for<br />
migrants, for Aboriginals, for the handicapped, the aged<br />
and the infirm, and has further protected the rights of<br />
individual Australians.<br />
The Government will not be distracted from these great<br />
programmes. We have a vision of growth and development for<br />
Australia a vision of stability, security, concern for<br />
effective help for those in need.<br />
By building on the foundations already set down that<br />
vision will be realised. 000---<br />
