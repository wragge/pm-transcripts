  I am pleased to announce today that Canberra is to be the Federal</p>
<p> Government's selection as the host city for the Commonwealth</p>
<p> Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) 2001.</p>
<p>  It is appropriate that such a meeting be held in the national capital</p>
<p> at the centenary of our Federation.</p>
<p>  Canberra is a capital city of which all Australians can be proud.</p>
<p> CHOGM will give Australia the chance to showcase its capital to leaders</p>
<p> from around the world.</p>
<p>  The Federal Government's agreement is subject to being fully</p>
<p> satisfied that suitable accommodation and conference facilities are</p>
<p> available. We are working with the ACT Government on these matters</p>
<p> and are confident that these requirements can be met.</p>
<p>  The meeting would represent significant opportunities for Canberra</p>
<p> businesses, particularly the hospitality and recreational sector.</p>
<p> This is especially the case as CHOGM will follow the Sydney 2000 Olympics.</p>
<p>  The Federal Government looks forward to working with the ACT Government</p>
<p> in bringing this ambitious project to fruition.</p>
<p>  19 February 1998</p>
