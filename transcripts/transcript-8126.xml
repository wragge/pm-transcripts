TRANSCRIPT OF UN4EDITED INTERVIEW WITH PAUL LYMEHAM, 7.30<br />
REPORT, 13 SEPTEMBER 1990<br />
E 0 3 PROOF ONLY<br />
LYNEHAM: Prime Minister, thanks for joining us.<br />
PM: Pleasure Paul.<br />
LYNEHAM: When one of Britain's leading bookies has<br />
Athens first at 7 to 4 on and Melbourne third at 10 to 1,<br />
doesn't that tell a betting man like you that Melbourne's<br />
a heck of a long shot?<br />
PM: Bookies have been wrong before.<br />
LYNEHAM: I know they hove but this is, they've had a lot<br />
of time to think about this.<br />
PM: Yes, well they don't always get it right. The<br />
expectation is that we will do well, that we should do<br />
well in the first round end then if you've got enough<br />
votes in the f irst round to stay in and we expect that<br />
we will certainly do that then I think we can pick up a<br />
lot of votes af ter that.<br />
LYNEHAM: Well how would you set Melbourne's<br />
PM: I am not going to accept that challenge at this<br />
stage. I don't know enough yet from being subjected to<br />
the people who are actually going to exercise the votes.<br />
If you would ask me that question on Monday night,<br />
Tuesday morning, I might be in a better position to.<br />
LYNEHAM: How potent is the fact that Athens is the<br />
sentimental favourite given that it's the centenary of<br />
the what is it the 1896 Athens Games?<br />
PM: It must operate in their favour. There's no doubt<br />
in my mind and I try to be as unprejudiced as I can<br />
about this there's no doubt on the intrinsic merits of<br />
the candidate cities that Melbourne is the best placed.<br />
It has a large city, it has 11 of the 13 Olympic<br />
facilities required already in place, it has a stadium<br />
that can seat 102,000 people there in place. No-one else<br />
has got that. The facilities are all within 6 kms of the<br />
centre of the city in parkianda and it's got all the<br />
infrastructure, great communications facilities, as you </p>
<p>2<br />
know, and importantly it's got the unqualified support of<br />
all levels of Government and the business sector and of<br />
the trade union movement. Environmentally it's more<br />
acceptable then any other city. So intrinsically we're<br />
very well placed.<br />
LYNEHAM: Well let's just pause for a minute and have a<br />
look at how the issues appear in Melbourne tonight, as my<br />
colleague, Ian Hensohike, reports.<br />
FM: Sure.<br />
( Melbourne report)<br />
L'INEHAM: Well Prime Minister, did you notice the<br />
suggestion there from Robert Hudson. of ACOSS that<br />
Canberra should underwrite the facilities because the<br />
Commonwealth will be the main beneficiary?<br />
0 PM: Yes, I noticed it.<br />
LYNSHAM: Any merit in that?<br />
PM: No. The Victorian Government didn't seek that nor<br />
is it appropriate. What Kevin Gosper had to say was<br />
right. It's a conservatively budgeted approach and there<br />
is no reason to believe in the intrinsic capacity of<br />
Melbourne to stage a successful Games. on the<br />
experience of the last two that there shouldn't be a<br />
prof it out of it.<br />
PM: Only a week ago Paul Keating was saying we were now<br />
a poor country that could not afford a huge increase in<br />
Public sector infrastructure or anything else as a matter<br />
of fact. How does that gel with the commitment to kick<br />
in $ 125M of taxpayers money?<br />
PM: Well that's spread over a considerable period of<br />
years. The Games aren't until 1996 and that will create<br />
a permanent sporting structure in the South Melbourne<br />
area which will be of continued value, . not only to the<br />
people of Melbourne but the people of Australia. Paul<br />
has not said at any stage, nor have 1, that in this<br />
country we don't have to continue to invest. We regard<br />
that as an appropriate investment in an enterprise which<br />
will be to the economic benefit of Australia as a whole.<br />
That's no doubt that Australia will benefit enormously<br />
from the. Games.<br />
LYNEHAM: Then what of those who say we need bread rather<br />
circus' now? I mean if you put $ 125M into say hi-tech<br />
industry development, wouldn't that be a better gain down<br />
the track?<br />
PM: Well if I hadn't in fact made an enormous increase<br />
in the public funding in science and research in this<br />
Country perhaps that irrelevancy might be worth note of..<br />
But the scientific community in this-* country has recently </p>
<p>rf-a, rmaov arrzvc CnMV TCL* 10O7 zv..% v re. vix r. o,)<br />

indicated its mark of gratitude for what this Government<br />
has done by honour extended to me. go there is<br />
the recognition that we have acted in that area. I mean<br />
I must say that f rankly this negativism that I see in<br />
some quarters, you know, gives me the irrits. It's a<br />
very short-sighted sort of attitude.<br />
LYNEHAM: You seem a bit irritated, don'It you?<br />
PM: No I'm not irritated with life generally but when I<br />
see LYNEHA4: It's Peter Walsh that's got under your skin,<br />
isn't it?<br />
PM: No he doesn't get under my skin. I mean I just gave<br />
him what he deserved.<br />
LYNEIIAM: He never lets a few facts get in the way of his<br />
0 well developed prejudices?<br />
PM: Yes, that's right.<br />
LYNEHAM: You're fed up with him obviously, aren't you?<br />
PM: Well as I said in my answer in the Par liament, for a<br />
muan who prides himself on his intellectual astringency,<br />
he never let's a few facts get in the way of his well<br />
developed prejudices. He doesn't.<br />
LYNEHA4: But he says when he was in Cabinet he said no<br />
to this $ 125M. I mean you and the rest of them voted him<br />
down. PM: Well Walsh may want to talk about what happened in<br />
the Cabinet and exercise, to some extent, his<br />
imagination. I'm not going to go into that.<br />
S LYNEHAM: Your claim that Melbourne's win will be another<br />
excuse for him to drown his bitter sorrow. That's a<br />
fairly hard punch isn't it, raising his drinking as an<br />
issue? PM: He is one who enters into this area of saying that<br />
he'll be praying and hoping and celebrating if we don't<br />
get it. He doesn't need much excuse for his celebration<br />
sorrow.<br />
LYNEHAM: Do you think he's damaged Melbourne's chance?<br />
PM: I would think that the people on the International<br />
Olympic Committee would pay the attention to him that he<br />
deserves, which is zilch.<br />
LYNEIIAM: But how do we know he's9 wrong when he says that<br />
the Victorian Government could have got Its sums wrong<br />
because they are not first prize winners in the past, are<br />
they, the Cain Government? </p>
<p>r rv* o~ rr~ inQ= ZVo v r lflDCr TQL--o z rv-4<br />
PM: Let me repeat what I said in the Parliament, facts<br />
of course, which he's not interested in. But the<br />
proposals that came up from the Victorian Government were<br />
examined by an interdepartmental committee, including the<br />
Department of Finance. It was on the basis of what they<br />
said that we were able to make the decision that we did.<br />
So I'd rather take the attitude of an independent<br />
interdepartmental committee than the observations of a<br />
man who is consumed by bitterness.<br />
LYNEIA: But look, the National Tennis Centre, the<br />
original cost of that's blown out from $ 67M to Sg4M. Now<br />
we find running costs were grossly underestimated,<br />
they're looking for a capital injection from the State<br />
Government of $ 40M just to keep it going. I mean that's<br />
a bit of a worry, isn't it?.<br />
PM: That's something which is specific to the Tennis<br />
Stadium and the running of that. I'Im not interested in<br />
that. What we examined was the bid for the Olympics in<br />
1996. LYNEHA4: If you'd known then what you know now about the<br />
Cain Government's economic problems, would you have had<br />
second thoughts then do you think?<br />
PM: We would've made the same decision.<br />
LYNEHAM: On another subject, the listing of the<br />
borrowing limit on the Australian Wool Corporation. If<br />
you can't say how much they'll need in the end, why isn't<br />
it the case that you might be handing them a blank<br />
cheque? PM: We've got to make the decisions which most<br />
calculated to ensure that we protect this important<br />
industry. We've taken all the facts into consideration<br />
and we'Ive made what we regard as the appropriate<br />
decision, and I'm sure It is.<br />
LYNEHAM: What does it say though about the industry that<br />
three months after the dropping of the floor price John<br />
Kerin has to urge them to stop sniping and speculating<br />
and to produce some business plans? I mean does that<br />
sound like professional<br />
PM: It. says that there are some rather silly people in<br />
the wool industry who are playing some internal politics<br />
rather than concentrating on what should be their major<br />
concern, that is to ensure the survival and the<br />
subsequent expansion of their industry.<br />
LYNEHAM: Internal politics at their own expense?<br />
PM: Exactly. IV -Z7 1 70 xv " 0 Mc 0 1 </p>

LYNEHAM: Telecommunications, Prime Minister. If as Paul<br />
Keating said yesterday, the duopoly arrangement the<br />
Government's proposing is transient, what does the<br />
permanent situation look like, from the lateral point?<br />
PM: Just get this in perspective. People are jumping up<br />
and down. I see headlines in papers that Paul Keating<br />
has said the duopoly will be transient. There's nothing<br />
new about this. This has been said by Kim Beazley in all<br />
the discussions that he's been having with various people<br />
in the<br />
LYNEHAM: Alright. So where are we going then?<br />
PM: But I'm just in other words let me Commentary<br />
upon, you know, the observers. They think they found<br />
something new. I mean if they really did their homework<br />
they'd understand that this has been made quick clear.<br />
0 cNoonws ithdee rapteiroionds oinf vtoilmveed . is Wuen cbeerltaiienv e btuht atth eanse enatreer pthriese<br />
that's coming in to take on Telecom and it'll be both<br />
on the domestic scene and internationally -there'll be<br />
freer competition. Now that's going to involve a very,<br />
very considerable level of investment. We believe that<br />
that competitor needs a reasonable period of time to be<br />
able to establish itself, to be able to take on with<br />
confidence a degree of investment. It'll be necessary to<br />
take on the entrenched Telecom. Now we will review that.<br />
We'll give them a specific amount of time, a minimum, and<br />
that'll be decided by the Cabinet. It'll be a period of<br />
time sufficient for them to have the confidence to<br />
establish themselves and then after that, when we review<br />
it, we'd say OK now you're established and there should<br />
be no reason why other competitors couldn't come in. Now<br />
we'll decide that as we go along.<br />
LYNEHAM: How many others?<br />
S PM: Well that essentially would be for the market.<br />
LYNERAM: On the changes that you are putting to the<br />
special conference, do you agree with Bob Hogg that if<br />
they don't get through that the future of the Government<br />
could be in jeopardy, there are no nuclear shelters on<br />
this one?<br />
PM: I believe that what the Government is proposing will<br />
get through. So I'm not speculating.<br />
LYNEHAM: And what's the decision making timetable on<br />
Qantas and Australian? When do you tackle that one?<br />
PM: Well when we get the decision from the conference<br />
that we want then we will move very quickly to make the<br />
decisions on that. 10902* VQ xv </p>

LYNEHAM: So you're going to the conference with the inprinciple<br />
decision you have now, no more detailed<br />
proposal? PM: The position that we have in our mind is quite<br />
clear. All the people at the conference know what that<br />
position will be. Once we get the decision of the<br />
conference the processes of Government can go ahead and<br />
we will make the administrative and the legislative<br />
changes that are necessary.<br />
LYNEHAM: Unless I'm mistaken your public position is<br />
you'll be selling at least 49% of each airline?<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
LYNEHAM: Well that's hardly definitive. I mean at least<br />
PM: When we go into that conference and that's what's<br />
important, not you Paul when we go into the conference<br />
the people who are voting will know what<br />
LYNEHAM: So you make the announcement at the conference?<br />
PM: They will know what they're voting on, Paul.<br />
LYNEHAM: Because if you only sell half of Australian you<br />
still have the responsibility for half its capital<br />
funding problems now and into the future, don't you?<br />
PM: Indeed you do.<br />
LYNEHAM: So you get the money, put it straight back in<br />
and you end up with nothing. Not very attractive is it?<br />
PM: No.<br />
LYNEHA4: Have you noticed the Telecom documdnt titled,<br />
" Carrier Competition and Prices Winners and Losers"? It<br />
lists the losers as small businesses and many residential<br />
and rural subscribers. What do you think of that?<br />
PM: It's not accurate.<br />
LYNEHAM: Are you sure there'll be no losers?<br />
PM: It's not accurate.<br />
LYNEHAM: But the greater the competition, the greater<br />
the pressure surely to align charges with real costs?<br />
PM: This is a profitable industry. It is an industry in<br />
which new technology is increasingly becoming available<br />
which enables things to be done more efficiently than<br />
they were able to be done before. The situation is that<br />
we will ensure, by, the arrangements that we make, that<br />
the benefits of coumpetition and the new technology will<br />
13905s5Q ZO; 40 NO. 012 F. 00 </p>
<p>7<br />
be passed on to consumers and we will have a regulatory<br />
framework in Austal to ensure that that happens.<br />
LYNEHAM: So we won't have that situation we had overseas<br />
where business benefited from cheaper trunk calls but<br />
domestic users end up finding they were paying more<br />
overall? PM: There will certainly be very con.~ iderable benefits<br />
on STD which apply to non-business people. It applies to<br />
individuals as it does to business. So everyone will<br />
benefit there and we will have, as the Minister has made<br />
quite clear, a continuation of the CPI minus X formula<br />
which has been there to protect consumers in the past and<br />
will continue to do so.<br />
LYNEHAM: On industrial relations, is the ACTU keeping<br />
its side of accord mark six by its current wage campaign,<br />
including next Wednesday's national strike in the metal<br />
industry?<br />
PM: I don't approve of the strike that's being proposed<br />
and I've made that quite clear and I think that's<br />
understood by the ACTU. The important thing as far as<br />
the Australian people are concerned is that the ACTU have<br />
unequivocally repeated its commitment to the Government<br />
to have the aggregate outcome that we've been talking<br />
about for 1991, the national aggregate outcome. They<br />
will not go beyond that.<br />
LYNEHAM: But how does that then gel with their claim in<br />
the metal industry for 0% productivity payment?<br />
PM: Well that's a claim but what I'm saying is that they<br />
can regulate outcomes and they have given the Government<br />
the undertaking that the aggregate outcome that they<br />
committed themselves to at the beginning of the year<br />
and on the basis of which we made the agreement will be<br />
adhered to by them. You've got to remember this; that<br />
for seven years now they have delivered on their promise<br />
on wages outcomes. We have no reason to believe on the<br />
historical background that they will not again deliver.<br />
LYNEHAM: And the section of the accord that states that<br />
the wage case must remain the focus of the nation's wage<br />
system? PM: Well how, that works out is to be seen. But what I'm<br />
saying is that in terms of the mana~ gement of the<br />
Australian economy, what is important for the welfare of<br />
the Australian people is that the ACTU keeps to its<br />
commitment on national aggregated wages outcome. I<br />
repeat, they have kept to that commitment for seven<br />
years, I have no reason to believe they're not going to<br />
keep to it again.<br />
LYNEHAM: Finally Prime Minister, the perennial question<br />
of your:%. own future </p>
<p>S p 8<br />
PM: Not perennial. I mean it hardly gets mentioned<br />
except when I come on the occasional program.<br />
LYNEHAM: Alright. Well look<br />
PM: Pretty boring.<br />
LYNEHAM: Next year will be the centenary conference, an<br />
historic occasion.<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
LYNEHAM: You know this is being talked about as well as<br />
I. PM: The historic conference, yes.<br />
LYNEHAM: Well the prospect that you might then be<br />
4tempted to do a Neville Wran?<br />
PM: First time I've heard of that.<br />
LYNEHAM: The first time you've ever heard it?<br />
PM: Yes, the first time I've heard that.<br />
LYNEHAM: Well look, isn't it a political impossibility<br />
to go to the next election saying vote for me and I'll be<br />
stepping down for Paul Keating some time<br />
PM: That assumes that either that you never take office<br />
or you never leave office. You've got to leave office at<br />
some stage.<br />
LYNEHAM: But if you left before the next election he<br />
could have a go on his own terms, couldn't he?<br />
PM: Well if I left after the next election he could do<br />
it then, couldn't he.<br />
LYNEHAM: But it doesn't muddy the campaign at all? Vote<br />
for me and have Paul Keating as Prime Minister?<br />
PM: Well I wouldn't think so. At some stage I'm going<br />
to have to stand down. That stage is not yet.<br />
LYNEHAM: And you're still sure that Paul Keating's the<br />
heir apparent?<br />
PM: I have no reason to change my view on that. No<br />
reason at all.<br />
LYNEHAM: Thanks for your time.<br />
PM: OK, thanks.<br />
ends </p>
