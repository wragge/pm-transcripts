    <content><![CDATA[<p>The government has agreed on a $124 million four year programme to</p>
<p> strengthen Australia's capacity to detect and deter illegal arrivals.</p>
<p>Illegal immigration is a growing global problem with an estimated</p>
<p> 4 million illegal entries worldwide each year, and worth some $10</p>
<p> billion dollars to increasingly well organised and sophisticated people</p>
<p> smuggling syndicates.</p>
<p>The measures to be taken by the government represent the most comprehensive</p>
<p> changes to coastal surveillance since the establishment of Coastwatch</p>
<p> in 1988.</p>
<p>They include:</p>
<p>   * Two additional Dash 8 aircraft to extend the footprint and intensity</p>
<p> of Coastwatch's aerial surveillance, particularly along the</p>
<p> east coast (see map)</p>
<p>   * An additional night capable helicopter to be deployed in the</p>
<p> Torres Strait</p>
<p>   * The establishment of a national surveillance centre at Coastwatch's</p>
<p> Canberra headquarters with electronic links to state government</p>
<p> agencies and Defence establishments</p>
<p>   * A new position of Director-General of Coastwatch reporting directly</p>
<p> to the CEO of the Australian Customs Service. The position will</p>
<p> be filled on secondment by a senior officer of the Australian</p>
<p> Defence Force. Liaison arrangements between Coastwatch, Defence</p>
<p> and other agencies will also be strengthened.</p>
<p>   * Expanding Australia's capacity to detect and deter illegal</p>
<p> immigration from source and transit countries through posting</p>
<p> twelve immigration officers to major source and transit countries,</p>
<p> including as airport liaison officers at key airports.</p>
<p>   * Conclusion of bilateral agreements with source and transit countries</p>
<p> for cooperation on people smuggling issues and to provide for</p>
<p> the return of illegal arrivals</p>
<p>   * Strong support for the conclusion as soon as possible of a protocol</p>
<p> on people smuggling to the proposed UN Convention on Transnational</p>
<p> Organised Crime</p>
<p>   * Establishment of a high level Information Oversight Committee,</p>
<p> chaired by the Office of National Assessments (ONA), to coordinate</p>
<p> information and intelligence on people smuggling</p>
<p>   * Introduction of comprehensive legislative amendments which the</p>
<p> Government will put before parliament shortly to strengthen maritime</p>
<p> investigatory and enforcement powers to complement legislation</p>
<p> on stronger penalties against people smuggling.</p>
<p>These and other measures to which the government has agreed are contained</p>
<p> in the report of my task force on coastal surveillance chaired by</p>
<p> the Secretary of my department, Mr Max Moore-Wilton. A list of</p>
<p> the task force's recommendations, all of which have been accepted,</p>
<p> is attached. Additional resources will be provided to implement the</p>
<p> recommendations, with agencies to absorb personnel costs where there</p>
<p> is capacity to do so.</p>
<p>When fully implemented these measures will greatly enhance Australia's</p>
<p> capacity to deal with the increasing threat of illegal immigration.</p>
<p> Each illegal arrival in Australia costs some $50,000 in processing</p>
<p> costs, and illegal boat arrivals pose potentially devastating quarantine</p>
<p> consequences for Australia's $13.5 billion agricultural industry.</p>
<p>With 37,000 kilometres of coastline and 9 million square kilometres</p>
<p> of ocean to cover, no Australian coastal surveillance system can be</p>
<p> foolproof. But the measures I am announcing today will greatly strengthen</p>
<p> the current system. They are a sound investment in the integrity of</p>
<p> Australia's borders, and represent a more cost effective solution</p>
<p> than the creation of an Australian coastguard or transfer of the coastal</p>
<p> surveillance function to the Defence force.</p>
<p>I have written to all the Premiers and Chief Ministers advising them</p>
<p> of the decisions. I have also asked Mr Moore-Wilton to brief his state</p>
<p> and territory counterparts on the implementation of the measures.</p>
<p>I would like to thank all the members of the task force for their</p>
<p> report. I would also like to thank all those, including state and</p>
<p> territory governments, who made submissions to the task force.</p>
<p> 27 June 1999</p>
<p>ACTION IN SOURCE AND TRANSIT COUNTRIES</p>
<p>Recommendation 1</p>
<p>That an Information Oversight Committee be established immediately</p>
<p> of relevant agencies to coordinate the gathering and analysis of information</p>
<p> and intelligence on people smuggling; and to oversee arrangements</p>
<p> to facilitate intelligence exchanges with other countries confronted</p>
<p> by people smuggling.</p>
<p>Recommendation 2</p>
<p>That an additional 7 DIMA compliance officers be placed overseas in</p>
<p> key Asian (Shanghai, Guangzhou, New Delhi, Colombo), African (Nairobi</p>
<p> and Pretoria) and Middle East (Ankara) cities to detect and deter</p>
<p> illegal immigration by boat and to strengthen information gathering.</p>
<p> The cost over four years, including some local support, will be in</p>
<p> the order of $9 million.</p>
<p>Recommendation 3</p>
<p>That since illegal immigration by air far exceeds illegal boat arrivals,</p>
<p> and some illegal boat arrivals begin their journey with a plane flight,</p>
<p> additional resources be provided for 5 additional DIMA airport liaison</p>
<p> officers (ALO) in Bangkok, Denpasar, Dubai, Kuala Lumpur, and Singapore.</p>
<p> The cost over four years will be in the order of $5 million.</p>
<p>Recommendation 4</p>
<p>That people smuggling issues receive a high priority in the work of</p>
<p> Australia's overseas missions, with representations made at ministerial</p>
<p> level where appropriate and that missions in source and transit countries</p>
<p> develop and implement strategies to regularly and widely disseminate</p>
<p> targeted information on Australia's policies on people smuggling</p>
<p> and related matters.</p>
<p>Recommendation 5</p>
<p>That priority be given to concluding arrangements with source and</p>
<p> transit countries and strengthening international cooperation in combating</p>
<p> people smuggling, and in particular:</p>
<p> * further develop Australia's cooperation and arrangements</p>
<p> with China (particularly Fujian officials) to stop the departure</p>
<p> of boats and the speedy return of boat people; </p>
<p>(b) extend the arrangements with Indonesia and PNG on third country</p>
<p> nationals attempting to enter Australia illegally and develop</p>
<p> similar arrangements with New Zealand and the Solomon Islands</p>
<p> with the objective of assisting with the removal of third country</p>
<p> nationals from those transit nations before they enter Australia;</p>
<p>(c) similar arrangements to be developed with other source and</p>
<p> transit countries, as appropriate, including Malaysia, Thailand,</p>
<p> South Korea and some Middle East countries;</p>
<p>  * establish arrangements with the Solomon Islands and other neighbouring</p>
<p> island states on providing information on possible unauthorised</p>
<p> boats travelling to Australia; and</p>
<p>   * AusAID and DIMA to actively review the scope for providing assistance</p>
<p> to enhance the capacity of law enforcement and border control</p>
<p> agencies in major transit countries to deal with illegal immigration.</p>
<p>Recommendation 6</p>
<p>That DIMA, in consultation with relevant agencies, provide material</p>
<p> and technical assistance to law enforcement and other appropriate</p>
<p> authorities in Indonesia and PNG to assist those countries with activities</p>
<p> focussed on the detection, detention and removal of immigrants attempting</p>
<p> to enter Australia illegally. The cost over four years will be in</p>
<p> the order of $2 million.</p>
<p>Recommendation 7</p>
<p>That a high priority be accorded to conclusion of the People Smuggling</p>
<p> Protocol to the draft UN Convention on Transnational Organised Crime</p>
<p> and its ratification be encouraged within our region and beyond.</p>
<p>ACTION IN AUSTRALIA TO STRENGTHEN COASTAL SURVEILLANCE</p>
<p>Recommendation 8</p>
<p>That the footprint and intensity of Coastwatch's aerial surveillance</p>
<p> be extended through the lease of a further two Dash 8 aircraft (with</p>
<p> provision for double crewing and 4000hrs of operation per annum for</p>
<p> the two aircraft) and one twin-engine (Instrument Flight Rules rated)</p>
<p> helicopter (with provision for 500hrs per annum) for use in the Torres</p>
<p> Strait.</p>
<p>[note: the aircraft and helicopter leases would be to 2004 to coincide</p>
<p> with the expiry of the existing Coastwatch contracts for the provision</p>
<p> of aerial surveillance aircraft and a helicopter. The first year includes</p>
<p> $2m for 1000hrs additional flying time for the existing fleet, to</p>
<p> cover the lead-time for the introduction of the two leased aircraft.</p>
<p> Provision is also included for the lease of a radar maintenance unit</p>
<p> and spares to provide enhanced support for the aircraft and four additional</p>
<p> Coastwatch Competency Assessment and Training Officers (CATOs).</p>
<p>The cost over four years will be in the order of $85 million.]</p>
<p>Recommendation 9</p>
<p>That a National Surveillance Centre be established within Coastwatch</p>
<p> in Canberra with enhanced electronic communications links, including</p>
<p> with state agencies, and an internal capacity to analyse information</p>
<p> received from agencies to better manage the national effort.</p>
<p>The cost over four years will be in the order of $20 million.</p>
<p>Recommendation 10</p>
<p>That secure satellite-based voice/data communications be established</p>
<p> to cover the full extent of Australia's Exclusive Economic Zone</p>
<p> (AEEZ) and beyond, including the capacity for real time communication</p>
<p> with coastal surveillance aircraft and ocean-going vessels.</p>
<p>The cost over four years will be in the order of $3 million.</p>
<p>Recommendation 11</p>
<p>That Coastwatch extend its surveillance to include more systematic</p>
<p> coverage of the AEEZ in the Coral Sea area, through transit operations</p>
<p> as required from neighbouring states such as PNG, the Solomon Islands,</p>
<p> New Caledonia and Indonesia.</p>
<p>Recommendation 12</p>
<p>That Coastwatch's profile be raised by separating it from Border</p>
<p> Division within Customs and established as a group in its own right</p>
<p> under a redesignated position of Director-General of Coastwatch, reporting</p>
<p> directly to the CEO of the Australian Customs Service.</p>
<p>Recommendation 13</p>
<p>That the position of Director-General Coastwatch be filled through</p>
<p> secondment of a serving uniformed Australian Defence Force (ADF) officer;</p>
<p> and that the Defence officer selected for the role identify other</p>
<p> secondment opportunities in Coastwatch and other relevant areas for</p>
<p> filling by members of the Australian Defence Force.</p>
<p>Recommendation 14</p>
<p>That the links between Coastwatch and its clients be strengthened</p>
<p> by the secondment to Coastwatch of the ADF Liaison Officer (ADFLO)</p>
<p> position (currently in Sydney) and a DIMA liaison officer; that Coastwatch</p>
<p> post a liaison officer to REEFCENTRE headquarters to liaise with Queensland</p>
<p> authorities and to Defence's Northern Command in Darwin to enhance</p>
<p> links with Defence.</p>
<p>Recommendation 15</p>
<p>That Customs and DIMA, in consultation with relevant agencies, develop</p>
<p> a National Protocol among Commonwealth agencies and with state and</p>
<p> territory agencies to cover illegal landings on Australian territory,</p>
<p> as an adjunct to offshore surveillance arrangements.</p>
<p>Recommendation 16</p>
<p>That in the lead-up to the expiry of the two major Coastwatch surveillance</p>
<p> contracts in 2004, Coastwatch further investigate the capacity of</p>
<p> emerging technologies to partly replace manned aerial surveillance.</p>
<p>A STRONGER LEGAL FRAMEWORK</p>
<p>Recommendation 17</p>
<p>That comprehensive legislative amendments be introduced to further</p>
<p> strengthen maritime investigatory and enforcement powers against both</p>
<p> Australian and foreign flag vessels. The legislation to be amended</p>
<p> includes the Migration Act 1958, Customs Act 1901,</p>
<p> Quarantine Act 1908, Fisheries Management Act 1991 and</p>
<p> associated legislation.</p>
<p>Recommendation 18</p>
<p>That the Commonwealth introduce legislation to create a forfeiture</p>
<p> regime in relation to all boats or vehicles used in connection with</p>
<p> the smuggling of migrants to Australia. Within constitutional constraints,</p>
<p> this would operate regardless of whether prosecution action were taken</p>
<p> or a conviction obtained and penalties imposed. Such a scheme would</p>
<p> result in the forfeiture of the vessel, vehicle or aircraft immediately</p>
<p> upon its arrival in Australia with prohibited non-citizens on board.</p>
<p> It would complement legislation to be considered by parliament on</p>
<p> stronger penalties against people smuggling. Apart from the deterrence</p>
<p> factor, such powers are necessary to enable derelict vessels to be</p>
<p> disposed of quickly before they become a hazard to navigation. In</p>
<p> the meantime full use should be made of s260 and s261 of the Migration</p>
<p> Act 1958 to have illegal vessel/aircraft detained and the Proceeds</p>
<p> of Crime Act 1987, which enables an offender's property to</p>
<p> be forfeited if it can be shown that an offender has been enriched</p>
<p> by migrant smuggling activities.</p>
