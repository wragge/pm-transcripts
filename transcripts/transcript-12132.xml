    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to announce that yesterday's meeting of the Prime Minister's</p>
<p> Community-Business Partnership (PMCBP) put the finishing touches on two</p>
<p> new tax initiatives to encourage greater corporate and personal philanthropy</p>
<p> in Australia. These initiatives are based on the work of the PMCBP's Taxation</p>
<p> Working Group, chaired by David Gonski.</p>
<p>The initiatives confirm the leadership provided by the Partnership in</p>
<p> making Australia's taxation system friendlier to individuals and companies</p>
<p> who want to give.</p>
<p>New Averaging Provision for Donations of Property</p>
<p>The first measure will make it more attractive for individuals or businesses</p>
<p> to donate property by allowing income tax deductions for all donations</p>
<p> of property to deductible gift recipients to be spread over five years.</p>
<p>This measure builds upon the package announced in March 1999 that allows,</p>
<p> among other things, the apportionment of deductions for certain gifts</p>
<p> to cultural, environmental and heritage organisations.</p>
<p>Extending eligibility to all deductible gift recipients will encourage</p>
<p> property donations for other worthwhile activities such as health, medical</p>
<p> research and education.</p>
<p>Apportionment, or allowing income tax deductions to be spread over five</p>
<p> years, will assist potential donors of property who might otherwise be</p>
<p> unable to realise the full benefit of the income tax deduction in a single</p>
<p> year.</p>
<p>Donations of property valued at more than $5,000, as determined by the</p>
<p> Commissioner of Taxation, will qualify. The new arrangements will apply</p>
<p> from 1 July 2002 and involve an estimated revenue cost of $2 million in</p>
<p> the first year, rising to $10 million per year from 2007-08 onwards.</p>
<p>Guidelines for Private Charitable Funds</p>
<p>The Government has also taken a further significant step to encourage</p>
<p> private philanthropy, with the release today of guidelines for Prescribed</p>
<p> Private Funds, which will become a new form of charitable trust enjoying</p>
<p> tax deductibility for donations made to it. These guidelines will be followed</p>
<p> up with a model trust deed, to be released early next week. The establishment</p>
<p> of Prescribed Private Funds was part of the package announced in March</p>
<p> 1999.</p>
<p>These new trusts will provide businesses, families and individuals with</p>
<p> greater flexibility to start their own trust funds for philanthropic purposes.</p>
<p> Funds that comply with the guidelines and the model trust deed will be</p>
<p> prescribed in Regulations as gift deductible entities under the Income</p>
<p> Tax Assessment Act 1997. This means that donations made to the funds will</p>
<p> attract tax deductions.</p>
<p>This measure will open up a new vehicle for private philanthropy, similar</p>
<p> to that existing in the United States, so that families and individuals</p>
<p> can donate to a trust of their own, which then disburses funds to a range</p>
<p> of other gift-deductible recipients. By creating opportunities for private</p>
<p> philanthropy, the Government is building up the social coalition, in which</p>
<p> government, business, community organisations and individuals work together</p>
<p> on social issues.</p>
<p>The guidelines released today specify the criteria by which private funds</p>
<p> will be prescribed in the regulations as gift deductible. They also prohibit</p>
<p> any payments from the funds that directly or indirectly benefit the donor</p>
<p> to the fund.</p>
<p>Limits will apply to the accumulation of money within the fund, such</p>
<p> that investment income can only be accumulated at a rate equivalent to</p>
<p> the CPI, with the rest disbursed to public philanthropic funds. In addition,</p>
<p> funds will be required to provide a simple annual return to the Tax Office</p>
<p> outlining the source of funds, and the payment of funds to various gift-deductible</p>
<p> public funds as well as the extent and recipients of management fees.</p>
<p>These guidelines will ensure that tax deductibility will only be given</p>
<p> where private charitable funds are used for the purposes for which they</p>
<p> are intended - providing money for philanthropic purposes. The guidelines</p>
<p> and model trust deed strike the right balance between maintaining the</p>
<p> integrity of the tax system, at the same time as providing tax incentives</p>
<p> for private giving.</p>
