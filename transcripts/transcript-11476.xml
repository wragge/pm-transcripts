<p>E&amp;OE .............................................................................................</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>How was your audience with Her Majesty?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well the usual protocols apply but I won't go into the details of</p>
<p> it, but she's very happy to be in Australia again and I know that</p>
<p> she's looking forward to travelling around a large part of the country</p>
<p> over the next two weeks. And I'm sure she will receive a friendly</p>
<p> and polite welcome.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Do you think that just four months after the controversial referendum</p>
<p> in some way could open up divisions and therefore embarrass the royal</p>
<p> guests?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I don't. Australians handled that referendum with the maturity</p>
<p> and common sense for which we are renowned. We had a debate, there was</p>
<p> a vote taken. Our society is not divided by the referendum. There were</p>
<p> passionately held views but at the end of the day all of us were arguing</p>
<p> what we thought was best for the country.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Do you sense there's a degree of indifference amongst Australians</p>
<p> to this visit by the Queen?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I am unsurprised by, I think, the attitude of the community. It</p>
<p> is a different world from what it was in 1954, or even 1963. We have a</p>
<p> very, very diverse busy life - all of us. I think there will be considerable</p>
<p> interest but nobody should imagine that it would be anything like what</p>
<p> it was in 1954. The world has moved on, it is very different. And I am</p>
<p> quite certain she understands that probably better than people who raise</p>
<p> those issues.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Why did you take eight years to invite her out again?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I never thought it was appropriate for her to come while the constitutional</p>
<p> issue was being deliberated on. We had a Convention, and then we had the</p>
<p> run up to the referendum. And I think if she'd have come last year,</p>
<p> somebody might have accused the Government of wanting to use a visit to</p>
<p> influence the outcome of the result. Now I don't know who that might</p>
<p> have been, but somebody might have done so.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Can I ask, the Olympic Charter states very clearly I think it's</p>
<p> rule 69, subsection 1 Â the Games shall be open by the head of state.</p>
<p> Why is she not being invited to open the Games? Why hasn't she .</p>
<p> . .</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well we decided that the appropriate person to open the games is the</p>
<p> Governor General and that matter has been discussed with the Queen last</p>
<p> year in Durban and she is very happy with the arrangements.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>So do you expect that her visit this time round might in fact cause a</p>
<p> new warming amongst Australians towards her?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Australians have always been warm towards her, including many people</p>
<p> in Australia who voted for a republic. The Queen as a person has not been</p>
<p> the issue in the Constitutional debate in Australia. She is not the issue</p>
<p> as a person. Most Australians respect her as a very committed, dedicated</p>
<p> Constitutional Monarch who has always tried to do her best by Australia</p>
<p> and has a considerable affection, a genuine affection for this country.</p>
<p> That was not the issue. Australian republicans were not anti her as a</p>
<p> person.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Can I ask the same question in regards to the monarchy though?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, well I don't know that the visit in relation to the debate</p>
<p> itself is going to necessarily have an impact either way. We are as a</p>
<p> people able to make judgements about these things, taking everything into</p>
<p> account. And the judgement we made last year as a matter of record was</p>
<p> to retain the current arrangements.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Now that the republican issue, if you like, has subsided at any rate,</p>
<p> do you think we can now look forward, can Australians now look forward</p>
<p> to more frequent royal visits say by the Queen who is coming next year</p>
<p> of course, but by other members of the royal family as well? Or will it</p>
<p> be another eight years . . .</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh, look I don't want to get into that. I mean the Queen will be</p>
<p> coming again next year for the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>You said that the eight year gap was because of the difficulty . . .</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, you asked me that and I gave you an answer to that. I am not going</p>
<p> to get into the future. In relation to other visits, she is here now,</p>
<p> she's very welcome. I know she is very happy to be back in Australia</p>
<p> and is looking forward to meeting a lot of Australians and visiting places</p>
<p> which she's been to before, plus some new ones. She will be back</p>
<p> again next year, what happens after that I am not going to get into.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>But it makes it a bit easier now?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I am not going to get into it.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Can we just ask what your memories are of the '54 tour because a</p>
<p> lot of people have been talking about that in the papers. Were you . .</p>
<p> .</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well it was certainly a different atmospheric to what it is now but that</p>
<p> . . .</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>I meant your view.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh, look I am not going to get into that, other people do it far better!</p>
