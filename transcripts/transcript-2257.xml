FOR PRESS P. M. No 73/ 1970<br />
DROUGHT ASSISTANCE TO QUEENSLAND<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton<br />
The Commonwealth has agreed to the contin. uation of drought relief<br />
assistance to Queensland in 1970-71 on the same basis as assistance provided<br />
in 1969-The Commonwealth will accordingly share with the State, on a<br />
dollar-for-dollar basis, the cost of agreed drought relief measures up to<br />
$ 4 million andwill meet the full cost in excess of $ 4 m-ilion.<br />
In 1969-70, the Commonwealth provided assistance totalling<br />
nearly $ 14 million and it is estimated that the Commornwealth's share of<br />
expenditure on drought relief measures in Queensland i-1970-71 could amount<br />
to over $ 11 million.<br />
The decision to continue substantial drought relief assistance<br />
reflects the Commonwealth's concern for those farmers who are still suffering<br />
from the effects of the prolonged drought in Queensland.<br />
Total Commonwealth drought relief assistance to Queensland since<br />
1965-66 has amounted to more than $ 30 million so that the Commonwealth has<br />
made, and will be continuing to make during 1970-71, a major contribution<br />
towards alleviaLing the effects of the drought coulitioris.  f<br />
