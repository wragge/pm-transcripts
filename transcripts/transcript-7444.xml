4FSTALA<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA2 DECEMBER 1988<br />
I have todav snt the following telegram to the family of<br />
Hazel and I were so sad to hear of Lloyd's death last night.<br />
That he died peacefully is as comforting to us as it must be<br />
for you. His creative genius lives on in the magnificent<br />
legacy of his lifetime's work. The wonderful luminosity of<br />
light which he captured will enchant us forever.<br />
Please accept our sincere condolences and deepest sympathy.<br />
Bob Hawke<br />
