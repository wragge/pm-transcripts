STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
CAPE YORK AGREEMENT A TRIUMPH FOR RECONCILIATION AND THE<br />
ENVIRONMENT<br />
Today's announcement of an historic landuse agreement on Cape York<br />
represents a watershed in the reconciliation process and a major boost for<br />
environmental protection of one of our most pristine regions.<br />
It lays a foundation of consensus for the creation of one of the world's truly<br />
great protected areas from the reef, through the rainforests of the wet<br />
tropics to the vast wilderness of the Cape itself.<br />
Importantly, it points the way ahead for resolving landuse issues through<br />
negotiation and consultation, rather than by confrontation and suspicion.<br />
It embodies within it an act of recognition by each of the parties of each<br />
other's rights and aspirations to the land, to the environment and -to<br />
economic security through ecologically sustainable development.<br />
This is what the reconciliation process is all about Coming together,<br />
recognising that beyond our differences we share a common purpose and a<br />
common interest in a special land, a land in which all our futures are<br />
intertwined and inseparable.<br />
It would never have been possible without this Government's recognition of<br />
the essential truth of the Mabo judgement, without the Native Title Act which<br />
provides for just such negotiated settlements and the Indigenous Land Fund<br />
and the enormous shift in attitudes that have come with these things.<br />
When the Coalition labelled the passage of the Native Title Act " a day of<br />
shame", they forever disqualified themselves from any constructive role in a<br />
process that is fundamental to our future as a nation. They underestimated<br />
the genuine goodwill and decency of the Australians.<br />

<p>The rest of us have shown them that we are moving ahead and none more<br />
so than the people of Cape York who, with a genuine sense of goodwill and<br />
common purpose, have come together to frame this agreement.<br />
I welcome their achievement and congratulate them on it. A Labor<br />
Government will support the agreement including, subject to consensus<br />
among the interested parties in the region, the establishment of a fund to<br />
facilitate the protection of areas of high conservation value including World<br />
Heritage. Labor's support for this agreement will bring to fruition a very longstanding<br />
and significant commitment to the pr~ pection of the North Queensland<br />
environmen-,. The Federal and State Labor Governments have committed $ 7.65 million<br />
since 1990 to assess the environmental values of the Cape through the Cape<br />
York Land Use Strategy ( CYPLUS). The agreement represents a culmination<br />
of that work and a framework within which those values can be protected.<br />
It also builds on other significant environmental achievements of this<br />
Government in North Queensland including the protection of the rainforests<br />
of the wet tropics, and the Daintree rescue package.<br />
I look forward to meeting with the parties at the earliest opportunity to discuss<br />
the agreement and to determine a process for co-operatively achieving their<br />
stated aspirations including the size of any conservation fund, World Heritage<br />
assessment and listing, traditional access rights and settlement of native title<br />
issues, and pastoral industry security and development.<br />
