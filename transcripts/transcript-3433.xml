PRESS STATEMENT NO. 353<br />
October 1974<br />
TOURIST ACCOMMODATION INDUSTRY REFERRED TO INDUSTRIES<br />
ASSISTANCE COMMISSION<br />
The Prime Minister announced today that he had forwarded<br />
a reference to the Industries Assistance Commission on<br />
whether assistance, other than assistance by way of taxation<br />
measures, should be accorded the tourist accommodation<br />
industry and if so, the nature and extent of such assistance.<br />
Mr Whitlam said the reference had been sent following<br />
representations made to the Government by the tourist<br />
accommodation industry on the need for assistance. The<br />
reference would cover not only accommodation facilities<br />
but also convention, restaurant and other facilities which<br />
the Commission may consider relevant to the inquiry.<br />
