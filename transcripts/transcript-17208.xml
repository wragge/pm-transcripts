    <content><![CDATA[<p>PM: It is good to be back in Brisbane, and it's good to be here at this Hospital, and as part of the research work of this University. The Government, in this one week to go before COAG convenes in Canberra, will be talking long and hard about the need for fundamental change in the health and hospital system of Australia. What are we on about? A new National Health and Hospitals Network funded nationally, run locally, and for the first time, the Australian Government being the dominant funder of the public hospital system.</p>
<p>And why? To deliver more hospital beds, more doctors, more nurses, and other health services to working families, pensioners and carers right across the country. And today, I'm announcing for the first time that the Australian Government will take over full federal control of aged care. This investment will support around 5000 aged care places or beds, and help to end the blame game that hurts hospitals, and also hurts aged care services. By ending the blame game in aged care, we'll deliver more money, more beds, and more health services for senior Australians. That's really important.</p>
<p>Today's announcement doesn't just deliver better care for senior Australians, it also means less pressure on our hospitals. And this means better support for aged care services for senior Australians, and at the same time, taking pressure off our hospitals for all Australians. Through this national aged care package, the Australian Government will, firstly, for the first time take full responsibility for aged care, including home and community care provided to older Australians.</p>
<p>Second, support the development of 2,500 new aged care places through the zero real interest rate loans scheme. Thirdly, provide an estimated $280 million to the states and territories to fund older Australians who are stuck in hospitals, waiting for an aged care place. Fourthly, increase incentives to GPs to provide more services in aged care homes. And fifthly, to expand the capacity of multi-purpose services, which provide aged care and set-down services in small rural communities by the addition of some 286 additional sub-acute beds, or bed equivalents.</p>
<p>Aged care is a really important part of the overall reform of our health and hospital system. Getting the reform of the acute hospital system is critical. Getting the reform of our aged care network is critical. And getting the reform of our primary healthcare system is critical. Together, this makes up a new national health and hospitals network, for better health and better hospital services for all Australians.</p>
