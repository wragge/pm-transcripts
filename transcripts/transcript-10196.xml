PRIME MINISTER<br />
WA ELECTION WIN<br />
I congratulate Richard Court on a very strong win. He and his colleagues<br />
have provided effective reform in Government.<br />
They inherited great difficulties in the wake of the WA Inc. excesses of the<br />
former Labor Government. Economic growth in Western Australian is<br />
now stronger than in any other part of the nation.<br />
I look forward to a continued close partnership with Richard Court for the<br />
benefit of all Western Australians.<br />
