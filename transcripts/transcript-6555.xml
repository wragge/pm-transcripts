PRIME MINISTER<br />
OPENING OF DOW CHEMICAL ( AUSTRALIA) INSTALLATION -ALTONA<br />
16 NOVEMBER 1984<br />
IAM VERY HAPPY TO BE ABLE 10 JOIN YOU T ODAY AT THE OPENING OF<br />
THIS NEW INSTALLATION AT THE Dow CHEMICAL PLANT IN ALTONA,<br />
THIS $ 15 MILLION PLANT REPRESENTS A MAJOR INVESTMENT IN OUR ECONOMY<br />
AND UNDERSCORES Dow CHEMICAL'S ROLE AS ONE OF THE PIONEERS IN THE<br />
FORMATION OF THE ALTONA PETROCHEMICA~ L COMPLEX.:<br />
IAM PLEASED THAT Dow CHEMICAL HAS COMMITTED ITS RESOURCES TO<br />
THIS PROJECT AND ITAKE IT AS A CLEAR DEMONSTRATION OF THE<br />
CONFIDENCE AND CONVICTION OF YOUR COMPANY IN THE FUTURE OF<br />
OUR ECONOMY.<br />
FROM THE OUTSET, THIS GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN ACUTELY AWARE OF<br />
THE NE , ED TO FOSTER AVJ ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
BUSINESS COMMUNITY CAN FLOURISH,<br />
IT IS A SIMPLE FACT THAT AROUND THREE-QUARTERS OF AUSTRALIAN<br />
WORKERS ARE EMPLOYED BY THE PRIVATE SECTOR. IF WE ARE TO<br />
ACHIEVE A SUSTAINED RETURN TO ECONOMIC GROWTH AT RATES THAT WILL MEET<br />
OUR OBJECTIVE OF REDUCING AND EVENTUALLY ELIMINATING UNEMPLOYMENT,*<br />
THEN IT IS OBVIOUS THAT THE PRIVATE SECTOR MUST PLAY THE MAJOR<br />
ROLE IN PROVIDING NEW JOBS. s .2/ s. </p>
<p>THE GOVERNMENT RECOGNISES THAT A RETURN TO HIGH LEVELS<br />
OF INVESTMENT IS A KEY REQUIREMENT TO THIS PROCESS WE<br />
ALSO RECOGNISE THAT FOR BUSINESS TO INVEST, IT MUST BE<br />
PROFITABLE FOR BUSINESS TO DO SO,<br />
THE GOVERNMENT IS COMMITTED TO A VIGOROUS, PROFITABLE<br />
BUSINESS SECTOR. WE HAVE MADE A VITAL CONTRIBUTION THROUGH<br />
POLICIES THAT HAVE SUPPORTED ECONOMIC RECOVERY, AND THAT<br />
HAVE INJECTED A GREATER DEGREE OF CERTAINTY AND<br />
PREDICTABILITY INTO THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT,<br />
PRIOR TO THE GOVERNMENT'S COMING TO OFFICE, THE. oAUSTRALIAN<br />
ECONOMY HAD BEEN . SHRINKING, THE ANEMPHLAODY MREINSTEN<br />
TO A LEVEL NOT: SEEN SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION, THE SHARE<br />
OF PROFITS IN THE NATIONAL INCOME WAS AT AN HISTORICALLY<br />
LOW LEVEL, AND OUR RATE OF INFLATION WAS AROUND TWICE THAT<br />
OF OUR TRADING PARTNERS.<br />
THIS GOVERNMENT BROUGHT WITH IT TO OFFICE A RATIONAL AND<br />
COHERENT STRATEGY THAT, WITH THE SUPPORT AND UNDERSTANDING<br />
OF THE COMMUNITY, HAS BEEN APPLIED TO THE NATIONIS PROBLEMS,<br />
SINCE THE GOVERNMENT CAME TO OFFICE THERE HAS BEEN A DRAMATIC<br />
TURNAROUND IN OUR ECONOMY. THAT TURNAROUND HAS BEEN DUE ABOVE<br />
ALL ELSE TO THIS GOVERNMENT'S ECONOMIC POLICIES. THESE<br />
POLICIES HAVE LAUNCHED AUSTRALIA ON THE PATH OF ECONOMIC<br />
RECOVERY, </p>
<p>THE FACTS SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES. REAL GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT<br />
ROSE BY 10 PER CENT DURING THE LAST FINANCIAL YEAR AND THE<br />
INCREASE WAS BROADLY BASED. SOME 267,000 NEW JOBS HAVE<br />
BEEN CREATED AND THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE HAS FALLEN FROM 10.2<br />
PER CENT IN APRIL 1983 TO 8.6 PER CENT IN OCTOBER 1984.<br />
ANNUAL INFLATION, AFTER ALLOWING FOR THE IMPACT OF MEDICARE,<br />
HAS FALLEN To 6,1 PER CENT AND OVER THE NEXT YEAR WILL BE LESS<br />
THAN FIVE PER CENT. THIS IS LESS THAN HALF THE RATE INHERITED<br />
BY THE GOVERNMENT, AND VIRTUALLY ELIMINATES THE GAP BETWEEN<br />
OUR INFLATION RATE AND THAT OF OUR TRADING PARTNERS.<br />
OUR PRICES AND INCOMES POLICY, BASED SgUARELY. ON THE ACCORD,<br />
HAS ALSO SUCCESSFULLY REDUCED T . HE INCIDENCE OF'INDUSTRIAL<br />
DISPUTATION AND HAS PROVIDED AN ENVIRONMENT OF CERTAINTY<br />
AND PREDICTABILITY FOR THE WAGE FIXATION PROCESS A CRUCIAL<br />
FACTOR IN FORWARD . PLANNING FOR BUSINESS.<br />
THERE HAS BEEN VIRTUALLY TOTAL COMPLIANCE WITH THE<br />
PRINCIPLES OF WAGE FIXATION DETERMINED BY THE ARBITRATION<br />
COMMISSION AND SUPPORTED BY THE GOVERNMENT. THE GOVERNMENT<br />
AND THE ACTU ARE COMMITTED TO ENSURING THAT THIS COMPLIANCE<br />
CONTINUES6 AND AS A RESULT OF THE GOVERNMENT' S PRICES AND<br />
INCOMES POLICY, IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE WAGE FIXING PRINCIPLESi<br />
THERE WILL BE NO INDEXATION INCREASES IN AWARD WAGES BETWEEN<br />
APRIL 1984 AND APRIL 1985. / 41. </p>
<p>CONSEQUENTLY DURING THIS FINANCIAL YEAR WE EXPECT AWARD<br />
WAGES TO GROW BY ONLY ABOUT 2 PER CENT. THAT COMPARES<br />
WITH ANNUAL AWARD WAGE GROWTH OF OVER 15 PER CENT AS A RESULT<br />
OF THE 1981-82 WAGES EXPLOSION CAUSED BY THE MISGUIDED<br />
POLICIES OF OUR PREDECESSORS. AND. WE HAVE ACHIEVED THIS'<br />
VAST IMPROVEMENT WITHOUT THE INDUS-TRIAL DISRUPTION AND<br />
CHAOS THAT IS INEVITABLY GENERATED BY THE CONFRONTATIONIST<br />
APPROACH OF* OUR OPPONENTS.<br />
THIS DRAMATICALLY ALTERED WAGES AND INFLATION -OUTLOOK IS<br />
A FOUNDATION FOR CONTINUED ECONOMIC GROWTH. BUSINESS CAN NOW<br />
PLAN AHtAD WITH CONFIDENCE, CAN INVEST,' IN NEW. PRLOJECTS -SUCH<br />
AS THIS MARVELLOUS ONE AND CAN CREA'TE MORE ANDl MORE NEW<br />
JOBS FOR AUSTRALIANS YOUNG AND OLD. THIS COUNTRY IS BEGINNING<br />
A NEW ERA OF ECONOMIC PROSPERITY. WE ARE DETERMINED THAT THIS<br />
OPPORTUNITY FOR LONG-TERM PROSPERITY AND GROWTH WILL NOT<br />
ONCE AGAIN BE SQUANDERED,<br />
THE FRUITS OF THE SUCCESS OF THE GOVERNMENT'S POLICIES HAVE<br />
BEEN PAR1fLY REFLECTED IN THE DRAMATIC REDUCTION IN THE REAL<br />
COST TO BUSINESS OF EMPLOYING LABOUR IN CLUDING MOST<br />
ON-COSTS AM~ IN THE~ RECOVERY OF THE SHARE OF COMPANY INCOME<br />
IN THE NATIONAL INCOME TO LEVELS LAST SEEN IN THE LATE 1960' s<br />
AND EARLY 1970' s. IN SHORT, WE HAVE RESTORED ADEQUATE LEVELS<br />
OF PROFITABILITY IN THE BUSINESS SECTOR, AN ESSENTIAL<br />
PRECONDITION FOR BUSINESS INVESTMENT. </p>
<p>THE GOVERNMENT HAS ALSO TAKEN SPECIFIC ACTIONS IN THE LAST<br />
BUDGET TO ENCOURAGE BUSINESS INVESTMENT, INCLUDING:<br />
THE INTRODUCTION OF COMPANY GROUP TAXATION;<br />
LIFTING THE DEPRECIATION RATE FOR COMMERCIAL<br />
BUILDINGS FROM 2.5 PER CENT PER ANNUM TO<br />
4 PER CENT PER ANNUMj AND<br />
AN EXTENSION BY ONE YEAR OF THE TIME FOR THE<br />
ELIGIBILITY OF PLANT ORDERED BEFORE 1 JULY 1985<br />
UNDER THE TERMS OF THE INVESTMENT ALLOWANCE.<br />
SINCE THIS GOVERNMENT CAME TO OFFICE, THERE HAS ALSO BEEN A<br />
MARKED FALL IN INTEREST RATES, THIS ONCE AGAIN REFLECTS THE<br />
SUCCESS OF OUR POLICIES AND UNDERPINS LOWER INFLATIONARY<br />
EXPECTATIONS IN THE COMMUNITY.<br />
THE GOVERNMENT RECOG NISES THE UNQUESTIONABLE IMPORTANCE OF<br />
THE COST OF BORROWING TO BUSINESS INVESTMENT DECISIONS. IN<br />
OUR LAST BUDGET WE ACTED FIRMLY TO REDUCE THE PRESSURES ON<br />
FINANCIAL MARKETS BY REDUCING THE PUBLIC SECTOR BORROWING<br />
REQUIREMENT. LOOKING AHEAD, WE HAVE PROMISED TO ENSURE THAT<br />
THE BUDGET DEFICIT WILL DECLINE AS A PERCENTAGE OF THE GDP,<br />
IN LINE WITH OUR GENERAL APPROACH TO ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT, WE<br />
WILL ENSURE THAT THE DECLINE IN THE DEFICIT IS MORE RAPID WHE1N<br />
PRIVATE INVESTMENT IS GROWING STRONGLY. REINFORCING THIS PLEDGE<br />
WE HAVE ALSO PROMISED THAT GOVERNMENT SPENDING WILL GROW AT A<br />
LOWER RATE THAN GDP. 16. </p>
<p>THESE PLEDGES, COMBINED WITH OUR UNDERTAKING T0 RES'TRAIN<br />
GOVERNMENT TAX RECEIPTS TO-A PERCENTAGE OF THE: GDP NO<br />
HIGHER THAN THE CURRENT LEVEL, PROVIDE, I SUGGEST, THE<br />
BEST POSSIBLE BASIS UPON WHICH INVESTORS CAN CONTINUE TO<br />
COMMIT THEMSELVES WITH CONFIDENCE.<br />
RECENT INFORMATION ON BUSINESS INVESTMENTo INDEED, CONFIRMS<br />
THE GOVERNMENT'S SUCCESS IN STIMULATING INVESTMENT. THE<br />
NATIONAL ACCOUNTS SHOW THAT REAL BUSINESS INVESTMENT ROSE<br />
IN EACH OF THE MARCH AND JUNE QUARTERS OF 1984 AFTER EIGHT<br />
SUCCESSIVE QUARTERS OF DECLINE*<br />
IN ADDITION, SURVEYS OF INVESTMENT I hTENT I ON ;_ ND ICATE TH4AT<br />
BUSINESS INVESTMENT IS SET TO RISE FURTHER IN 1984-854 THERE<br />
IS EVERY INDICATION THAT THIS MOMENTUM WILL BE CARRIED FORWARD<br />
INTO EVEN STRONGER PRIVATE INVESTMENT GROWTH IN 1985-86,<br />
THESE ARE INDEED ENCOURAGING SIGNS THAT THE FOUNDATIONS FOR<br />
SUSTAINED RATES OF NON-INFLATIONARY ECONOMIC GROWTH ARE WELL<br />
IN PLACE AND THAT BUSINESS IS INCREASINGLY CONFIDENT ABOUT<br />
THE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK.<br />
THIS GROWTH IN CONFIDENCE IS PART OF THE NEW WORLD-WIDE<br />
CONFIDENCE IN AUSTRALIA AND ITS FUTURE. THIS, AS I SAID THE<br />
OTHER DAY; IS ITSELF A REFLECTION OF OUR NEW SELF-CONFIDENCE,<br />
OUR CONFIDENCE IN OURSELVES AND IN OUR OWN FUTURE. IT IS<br />
ON THIS BASIS THAT THE LABOR GOVERNMENT AIMS TO BUILD AN<br />
EVEN BETTER, FAIRER AUSTRALIA. </p>
