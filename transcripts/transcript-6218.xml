ADDRESS BY THE PRIIME MINISTER, MR. BOB HAWKE, AT Ti<br />
OPENING OF THE LAKE MACQUARIE POLICE CITIZENS BOYS' CLUB<br />
1 OCTOBER 1982<br />
I AM DELIGHTED TO BE WITH YOU TODAY TO HELP YOU<br />
CELEBRATE THE OPENING OF YOUR NEW CLUB,<br />
IT GIVES ME PARTICULAR PLEASURE TO BE THE FIRST<br />
PRIME MINISTER TO OPEN SUCH A CLUB Ii'THE 46 YEARS<br />
SINCE THE INCEPTION OF THE FEDERATION OF. POLICE<br />
CITIZENS BOYS' CLUBS,<br />
I HAVE BEEN IMPRESSED WITH THE WAY THE LAKE MACQUARiE<br />
POLICE CITIZENS BOYS' CLUB HAS TAPPED INTO THE<br />
EXTENSIVE RESOURCES THAT EXIST WITHIN THiS COMMUNITY,<br />
THE PROOF OF THE EFFORTS OF THE LAKE MACQUARIE<br />
COMMUNITY ARE BEFORE US TODAY IN THIS BUILDING<br />
WITH ITS MAGNIFICENT FACILITIES,<br />
THESE EFFORTS PROVIDE A FINE EXAMPLE OF THE<br />
CONSTRUCTIVE SUPPORT AND ENCOURAGEMENT FOR<br />
THE YOUTH OF LAKE M'ACQUARIE THAT THE REST OF THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN COMMUNITY SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED TI FOLLO.,<br />
IN THE VERY DIFFICULT ECONOMIC CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE<br />
RECENT PAST YOUNG PEOPLE AS A GROUP WERE THE<br />
MOST SERIOUSLY HURT, </p>
<p>THEY W,; EPE AMONG THE F IRT GROUPS TO BE AFFECTED BY<br />
THE RECESSION,<br />
THEY IWERE At.', OqG THE HARDEST HIt BY THE $ IHRGE OF<br />
UNEMPLOYMENT DURING RECENT YEARS.<br />
AT MAY 1983 THERE WERE 176,800 UNEMPLOYED<br />
YOUTH IN THE 15-19 AGE GROUP AND 343,900<br />
UNEMPLOYED IN tHE . L%-24 AGE GROUP,.,<br />
THE REDUCTION OF UNEMPLOYMENT IN ALL CATEGORIES<br />
AND MOST ESPECIALLY AMONG YOUTH IS THE SINGLE MOST<br />
IMPORTANT GOAL OF THE GOVERNMENT S ECONOMIC POLICIES.<br />
WE CAN ILL-AFFORD THE LOSS OF SUCH VAST<br />
PRODUCTIVE POTENTIAL, ./ 3 </p>
<p>HIGH RATES YOU,-Tl! UNEMPLOYN1ENT OF THE KIIND<br />
CAUSED~ BY Thr: PREVIOUS GOVERHNMENT'S POLICiEZALSO<br />
CARR~ Y SIGINIFICANI SOCIAkL COSTS FOR OUR<br />
COt4MUN IT I E S.<br />
-A LARGE NUMBER OF ONEl GENER. ATION HAVE<br />
BEEN DEPRIVED OF THE WORK EXPERIENCE NECES. SARY<br />
TO EQUIP THEM TO PLAY A PRODUCTIV'E PART IN OUR<br />
SOCIETY1<br />
THE FRUSTRA TION AND) DISAPPOINTMENT OF AFFECTED<br />
INDIVIDUALS HAVE ALIENATED ISOME FROM THE SYSTFIM'<br />
AND PRODUCIED INTOLERABLE TENSIONS BOTH WITHIN<br />
FAMILIES AND IN THE CO01MUNITY AT LARGE.<br />
VIHI'LE WE CANNOT REASONABLY L&gt; XPECr IN THE FOIRS E * A BL E<br />
FUTURE TO RIETURN TO THE EXPERIENCE OF THE POSTWAR<br />
GENERAT ION WHERE THE CONVENT IONAL ECONOMY PROV'IDED<br />
FULL EMPLOYMENT FOR EV'ERYBODY WHO SOUGHT WORKS WE<br />
CAN AND -WILL CREATE MORE JOBSI<br />
THE BEST STIMULUS TO A STROiNG AND SUSTAINED GRO'WT'lH<br />
IN EMPLOYMENT IS THROUGH A GENERAL RECOVERY IN<br />
THE ECONOMY.<br />
THE GOVERNMENT HAS SOUGHT TO PROVIDE THE<br />
FRAM. EVOR. K FOR SUCH A% RECOVERY THROUGHr ITS<br />
ECONOMIC POLICIES, INCLUDING THE 193/ 84<br />
BUDGET. </p>
<p>WE ARE ALSO TAKING INITIATIVES SPECIFICALLY<br />
INTENDED TO LEAD TO PERMANENT JOBS OR TO PROVIDE<br />
SERVICES OF PERMANENT COMMUNITY VALUE,<br />
AN EXTRA $ 300 MILLION IS BEING MADE<br />
AVAILABLE FOR DIRECT JOB CREATION<br />
IN CO-OPERATION WITH THE STATES UNDER THE<br />
COMMUNITY EMPLOYMENT PROGRAM, THIS ! S<br />
EXPECTED TO CREATE UP TO 40., 000 JOBS THIS<br />
FINANCIAL YEAR AND UP TO 70,000 NEW JOBS IN<br />
A YEAR WHEN IT IS FULLY OPERATIONAL,<br />
A PARTICULAR MATTER WVIE IN AUSTRALIA SHOULD BE<br />
ADDRESSING IS THE FACT THAT TOO FEW OF OUR YOUNG<br />
PEOPLE ARE STAYING ON IN EDUCATION. OUR RECORD<br />
BY COMPARISON WITH OTHER COUNTRIES IS POOR,<br />
THE PARTICIPATION AND EQUITY PROGRAM WE ARE<br />
STARTING IN 1984 WILL HELP, AS ALSO WILL THE<br />
3000 EXTRA PLACES THE GOVERNMENT IS FINANCING AT<br />
UNIVERSITIES AND CAE's NEXT YEAR. </p>
<p>THESE STEPS AREj HOWEVER, ONLY A BF. GINNINU, THE<br />
GOVERNMENT I'S G:' YVINIG 0S[ E CONS I 0ElAT ION TO 11O1W BUST<br />
