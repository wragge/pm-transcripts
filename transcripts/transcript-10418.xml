THE HON JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH ALAN JONES RADIO 2UE<br />
E O E<br />
JONES: Prime Mlinister, good morning.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Good morning.<br />
JONES: Do you get tired?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Occasionally, but I'm feeling pretty fit at the moment.<br />
JONES: You've been doing a lot of miles.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, I was in Thursday Island yesterday. It's an extraordinary reminder of what a diverse country we<br />
have. And what a terrific place! They are lovely people. So open and friendly and warm spirited and...<br />
JONES: You made a pretty big decision up there yesterday in relation to Torres Strait Islanders.<br />
PRIME; MINISTER:<br />
Yes, I confirmed what we'd been wanting to do for a long time and that is separate the administration of<br />
the Torres Strait Islander people out from ATSIC.<br />
JONES: So ATSIC will have to change its name.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yes it will.<br />
JONES: When are you going to do that?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, I hope we'll get the legislation in this year. We certainly will have it operating by, providing the<br />
Senate doesn't block it and I don't think the Senate will block this, I expect we'll have it operating<br />
certainly by the end of our first term. They just want to be treated as a separate indigenous group, which<br />
they are. They're very different people from the Aborigines. And they have a great sense of community,<br />
they of course an island. They were never nomadic people and that of course makes them quite different<br />
from... JONES: Aborigines. </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Aborigines.<br />
JONES: You had a bit to say up there about racism. It obviously irritates you that people are constantly trying to<br />
suggest that somehow or other we're all a racist country.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, it doesn't only irritate me. I think it irritates millions of Australians. I mean, they are told by self<br />
appointed commentators that we are a racist country when we have a record of tolerance which is second<br />
to none. Now, that doesn't mean to say we haven't had blemishes, of course we've had blemishes. But<br />
if you look at the last 20 or 30 years, if you look at the generous way in which we take people in, if you<br />
look at the non-discriminatory immigration policy and if you look at the behaviour of other countries<br />
around the world towards minority groups this charge of racism is absolutely ridiculous. And I get fed<br />
up, I get angry and I think a lot of Australians get angry when they're constantly put down. I mean, I'm<br />
sorry to say but I saw the other day Gough Whitlamn making a remark about how if we were bidding for<br />
the Games now we wouldn't do as well. Gough, really, I mean, I don't like criticising a former Prime<br />
Minister, particularly one who was in the job a long time ago but really that was a, I hope, unintended put<br />
down of his own country. Because, quite honestly, it's those kind of remarks that do us more harm than<br />
the outbursts of people who express minority views within our community. Now, look, every community<br />
in the western world is throwing up people who are expressing, in perhaps not an elegant way, the<br />
frustrations of people who are affected by change. But if you look at the broad sweep of what Australia<br />
has done, if you compare our credentials with the rest of the world, we can look anybody in the eye, we<br />
can be proud of the tolerance of this country. And I think most Australians are sick to death of being<br />
told every day that they're a bunch of racists.<br />
JONES: Absolutely. Not that anyone of such a mind would be listening to you at this point but if you could<br />
actually get amongst some of those people that are throwing potatoes and eggs and urine filled balloons<br />
in alleged protest at Pauline Hanson or anyone else, what would you say to them?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, I would say you are doing great damage to the image of Australia. Their behaviour is worse than<br />
the behaviour of some of the people they attack. I think those demonstrations at her rallies are<br />
counterproductive. They are clearly organised. The placards are the same. The mantras are the same.<br />
The slogans are the same.<br />
JONES: Do you think your Government might be paying them via unemployment benefit or something as well?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, I don't know about that. I mean, I have no idea of knowing that. But I do know this, if they think<br />
they are damaging the cause against which they're demonstrating, they're wrong. And I don't always<br />
agree with, I don't often agree with Bob Carr, I do occasionally, but I agree with him on this. He said a<br />
few weeks ago that they shouldn't demonstrate, they only drew attention to the very views they claim to<br />
oppose. And I think the thuggery demonstrated at that meeting in Melbourne and the sight of that poor<br />
man with a black eye the poor bloke's been out of work for six years and he gets bashed up because he<br />
exercises his democratic right to go to a meeting. Now, it doesn't matter what people may think of Mrs<br />
Hanson's views. She's got a right to put them and people have got a right to go along and hear them.<br />
And these thugs who are trying to bust up all these meetings are really helping her. They're not harming<br />
her, they're helping her. And I just think it's being quite counterproductive. </p>
<p>JONES: You're quoted as saying today that your Government's unlikely to make big policy changes because of<br />
unemployment. You said there will be a cabinet meeting and.,. but the public shouldn't be expected to<br />
expect any radical new policy measures. I was just talking to some business people...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Oh, I think there was probably a bit of a gloss on what I said. What I said was that we were going to<br />
have this meeting and I just I didn't want the meeting to be seen in itself as necessarily meaning that<br />
there was going to be a huge change. But nobody should imagine that we have a static approach to the<br />
problem of unemployment. Nobody should think for a moment that we're not constantly looking at<br />
different ways of trying to get unemployment down within the bounds of sensible policy. I don't want<br />
anybody out there to think that we're sitting on our hands whistling and hoping that unemployment is<br />
going to come down. You have to be active and you have to constantly be seeking different ways of<br />
getting it down.<br />
JONES: On that basis can I just raise a point with you because you can only pay for jobs out of profit.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yes. JONES: And I just asked quite a few business people that I was with yesterday how big an erosion of your profits<br />
occurs as a result of the price you pay for money. And they just said, look, it's dramatic and the price we<br />
pay is extortionate compared to elsewhere. There have been phenomenal results...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Less extortionate than it was 16 months ago.<br />
JONES:: But miles beyond inflation rates and so on. And you've got to look at those tremendous results from<br />
Japan today. Is there any circumstance, I want to ask you, where you would consider revisiting the<br />
principles of the old commonwealth and rural bank where money was lent out from the Reserve at the<br />
government's direction, very minimal rates9 There was a minor administrative charge put on top of it<br />
and they lent to small business, rural businesses and local government and you could do that at under 3<br />
The impact on employment, I would think, would be enormous. Does that have any merit?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Alan, you've got to remember the context in which that occurred. 20, 30 years ago when we had<br />
experienced long periods of low inflation and low interest rates and we also didn't run big budget deficits.<br />
Now, all of that changed over the following 20 or 30 years. I think you are getting into an era of lower<br />
interest rates in Australia. The reductions in interest rates that have occurred have been very, very good.<br />
And I hope that over a period of time and I've got to be careful what I say here because I noticed the<br />
other day because I expressed sort of normal aspiration that any Prime Minister would express and that is<br />
you want to have lower interest rates, the money markets reacted in a particular fashion I've got to say<br />
that I amn personally not attracted to going back to that sort of thing. I am far more attracted to getting<br />
the budget deficit down, building up a good surplus and making other changes to the economy and<br />
reinforcing lower interest rates via lower inflation.<br />
JONES: That's basically leaving it though to the banks. Now, the banks of course have got... </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Ah, no. Well, I'm not... that's another issue. I think the banks mustn't...<br />
JONES: Where else does business get its money?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, I think if the banks are exposed to even more competitive pressure, and we will be responding very<br />
soon to the Wallis Inquiry, which had quite a lot to say on that subject...<br />
JONES: So you may well let the AMVs of this world..<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, we have..<br />
JONES: get into the business of..<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, there are a lot of recommendations that we have to respond to.<br />
JONES: Is that an option?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, all of the recommendations except the one about being opposed to a fuirther reduction in the<br />
number of trading banks. In other words, we're not attracted at the moment, until there's more<br />
competition, to the possibility of a merger between the major trading banks..<br />
JONES: But their concern is for shareholders, your concern is the unemployed and they almost are poles apart,<br />
aren't they?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, not entirely but I think the key to the banking system Is to have more competition. See, the reason<br />
that housing loans have come down your point what you're really arguing for is cheaper finance for<br />
business, I understand...<br />
JONES: Absolutely. PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, the reason that housing interest rates have come down dramatically is because of the entry of shows<br />
like Aussie Home Loans and Ram and all of the new...<br />
JONES: You think you can replicate that in business.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, if you could have something like that in the small business sector in particular you would really<br />
begin to see more competitive conditions. </p>
<p>JONES: Well let me put another one to you. You've been very strong about the family and the importance of the<br />
family unit and how it's absolutely essential to try and keep that family together. There must be over 200<br />
000 parents out there, whether they're men or women it doesn't matter, who actually prefer to be at<br />
home looking after their kids but can't because one income won't keep the roof over the head. Would<br />
there be any consideration or any circumstances in which you'd provide a very significant thing which<br />
might be called a home makers allowance, say at a rate which is equal to a salary of $ 350 on certain<br />
conditions which would enable about 200 000 people to move out of the workforce and do what they'd<br />
like to do, look after the kids at home and create opportunities for 200 000 to enter the force?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, we made a start in that direction with the family tax initiative. The family tax initiative, which came<br />
into operation at the beginning of this year, was heavily slanted towards that very group you're talking<br />
about, very heavily slanted. Now, obviously in the eyes of many people the amount involved was not<br />
enormous...<br />
JONES: That's right.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
But it did represent for the first time a government going in the other direction. For something like<br />
years governments have gone in the direction of really encouraging families to be two income families. I<br />
mean, my view is people should have a free choice when their children are young as to whether there is<br />
one parent or two parents in the workforce. It's not for me to say whether both mum and dad should be<br />
at work.<br />
JONES: They can't afford it.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, many of them can't afford it and the family tax..<br />
JONES: They can't afford the choice.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, the family tax initiative delivered the highest benefits, something like $ 34.00 a fortnight to single<br />
income families. Now, it was criticised by some people who believe that everybody should be in the<br />
workforce irrespective of the age of the children. We have made a start. Now, I don't rule out and I<br />
know it wasn't a princely sum, but governments..<br />
JONES: So the principal has merit...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
The principal has enormous merit, we have made a down payment on it and I certainly wouldn't rule out<br />
taking further action in that respect.<br />
JONES: Well, I will just take a break and we'll play away, and I want come back and talk to you then about the<br />
relationship between welfare and unemployment.<br />
( COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p>
<p>JONES: Small business is a very important constituency for you. They are concerned out there now that they have<br />
a lame dluck Minister in Geoff Prosser, particularly in this business about tenants and the relationship<br />
between tenants, of course, and owners of major shopping complexes, and he is seen as one and can't<br />
participate in this fair trading debate that is going on. You are not likely to tell me but I am going ask<br />
you anyway, are you going to have a ministerial re-shuffle and when and what will you do with Mr<br />
Prosser? PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well look I think the question about the tenancies and everything is something that can be handled quite<br />
easil in-elation to the decisions and soforth of that being made by the senior portfolio Minister, John<br />
Moore, I don't think that is a particular difficulty. In the past Ministers have often thought they have a<br />
conflict of interest situation on both sides and you get somebody else to do it.<br />
Now, you are right, if at any stage in the fuiture I decided to have reshuffle I am not going to telegraph it.<br />
I don't want to suddenly wake up in the morning and do something about it...<br />
JONES: He could be a candidate.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:-<br />
No, I'm just simply saying, I don't comment on those things. I do believe that we have a very strong<br />
story to sell in small business. I mean, a week ago, the law changed so that every small business operator<br />
can now, if they want to, sell their business, invest the proceeds and up to $ 5 million of the proceeds can<br />
be invested in the purchase of a new business without paying any capital gains tax.<br />
So, for the great bulk of small business men and women in Australia, the great bulk and the<br />
overwhelming majority of them, they are now free of capital gains tax if they reinvest in another business.<br />
JONES: And of course the budget attack on debt is the biggest thing.<br />
PRIME MINISTERWell,<br />
because it has helped to bring interests rates down.<br />
JONES: We're not going to go after this, I just want to pose this to you. A lot of calls this week. If you have got<br />
four people aged 18 or 19 and they are unemployed and they decide to share a house or a unit each could<br />
qualify for the maximum unemployment of $ 264.70 a night. That would equal about one $ 1058 every<br />
two weeks, add on their rental allowance, they could have, in hand, four of them, two blokes, two girls,<br />
$ 1258 a fortnight. Now, there is no way in the world they would get that in the workforce. Is welfare a<br />
disincentive in some instances towards getting people into the employment queues?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
It can be if the conditions attached to the receipt of it aren't firm enough.<br />
JONES: And are they firm enough?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well, they're being made a lot firmer by us and the whole principal of mutual<br />
obligation being the work for the dole scheme, which I think has enormous community support and also<br />
in the Iasi budget we cut the rental assistance significantly for people in that very situation... </p>
<p>JONES: Work for the dole only effects about 30,000 people. So there is whole range of them out there.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, work for the dole can extend to more, it can extend to more.<br />
JONES: Should a bloke be able to go in looking absolutely disreputable, earings hanging out, unshaven, and I<br />
think, I don't want a dirty bloke like that working for me, so he is qualified actually to keep out of<br />
employment and take welfare.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well Allan, I think rather than sort of respond to pictures like that which are graphic let me say, I think<br />
you should have tough rules. I think if somebodies only means of support is the unemployment benefit<br />
and they have got nothing else, it's not a fortune.<br />
JONES: No, it's not.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
It's tough to live on that.<br />
JONES:<br />
No, we're talking about youth unemployment here.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
But I think you should have rules and we've progressively tightened it. I mean they've got work for the<br />
dole, we have now effectively announced we are going to abolish the unemployment benefit for people<br />
under 13, so they'll either have to stay at school or be in training and we have made changes to the rental<br />
allowance.<br />
JONES: So you are constantly monitoring the concern...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, we are not only constantly monitoring, we're constantly enforcing the principal of mutual<br />
obligation. We look after you if you need help but in return you've got to do something if we ask you to<br />
do it.<br />
JONES: Good to talk to you, it's a very tough job and a tough world out there and you are making a real fist of it.<br />
Thank you for your time.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Pleasure. </p>
