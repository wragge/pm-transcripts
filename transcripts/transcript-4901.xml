JAUSTRALIA<br />
FOR PRESS 26 NOVEMBER 1978<br />
SHERWOOD BY-ELECTION<br />
The Queensland Liberal Party has good cause to be pleased with<br />
its success in the Sherwood by-election.<br />
It polled particularly well in a by-election situation, and<br />
in a seat where after 22 years, the previous Liberal Member<br />
had built up a large personal following.<br />
The convincing win is a particular tribute to the Liberal's<br />
new Parliamentary leader in Queensland, Dr. Llew Edwards.<br />
I extend my warmest congratulations to Dr Edwards, and<br />
to the new Liberal Member for Sherwood, Mr Angus Innes. </p>
