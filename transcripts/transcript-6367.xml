PRIME MINISTER<br />
PARTIAL TRANSCRTPT OF INTERVIEW ON 2HD -NEWCASTLE<br />
12 APRIL 1984<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
QUESTION: What's your comment on something like Nationwide?<br />
Well I have to be careful that I'm not misrepresented<br />
in what I say. There has been a misrepresentation of things<br />
I was reported to have said in Caucus. I have made no<br />
threat and would not make any threat to the independence<br />
of the ABC. But I insist tliaL peopic must understand<br />
that independence in the ABC does not mean immunity from<br />
criticism. There is no doubt in my judgement that there<br />
is ground for concern about bias in the ABC over recent<br />
periods. I am concerned about that. If the " kC wiuhes<br />
to talk to me about it as I understand they may do at their<br />
initiative I would talk to them. I am not seeking to impose<br />
any threat or any censorship upon them. But it does seem to<br />
me that if you have an organisation which is publicly funded<br />
and is independent, as it must be, then they have to be<br />
very careful that they meet the expectations of the public<br />
that they are independent. This doesn't mean in any sense<br />
that there cannot be programs criticising government. Of<br />
course there can be and must be. But there is a pattern of bias<br />
towards a particular view that has been apparent in parts of the<br />
ABC. QUESTION: Would you probably debate that on the ABC with say<br />
their management and one of their Board.<br />
You don't handle these things by a public debate. But<br />
as I say there is some indication that management and the Board<br />
may like to talk with me and if it's their wish that talks<br />
take place then I would-be prepared to explain objectively<br />
to them the basis for the view, not merely that I have but<br />
very many people have on that point, and then would hope that<br />
they Would look at that evidence and try to work it through<br />
themselves. But I insist, the point I am making, is that<br />
there is no way that this Government will try to exercise<br />
financial pressure of any threatening kind on the ABC. That<br />
is not the way I operate. </p>
