TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
LAUNCH OF THE TRIPLE J TRANSMITTERS INTO REGIONAL<br />
AUSTRALIA, PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA, 6 DECEMBER 1994<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
It's so hot my make-up is running. I borrowed someone's make-up in the<br />
office and she said to me " do you want the lippy too?", and I said I'm not<br />
doing an impersonation of Julian Clary, I am only impersonating myself.<br />
It is wonderful to be here and see this extension of Triple J's network. I<br />
suppose if you like the present and you are inclined to the future, and you<br />
look forward to the future, then you are inclined to Triple J. But if you are<br />
stuck in the past and you have got old fogies for friends then you are inclined<br />
against Triple J. And I suppose that probably marks out the Triple J<br />
supporters from those who are not. But what we have seen here is the<br />
development of a marvellous, authentic stretch of Australian communications<br />
and Australian radio. As David said, or Michael Lee said, that is from a small<br />
studio in Darlinghurst not so many years ago to now a national network of 1.8<br />
million people. And now with the extensions into 22 regional areas, a much<br />
greater network altogether. And of course, their grearTeg-fi-7Australian<br />
music and comedy I mean HG and Roy were a couple of bodgies not so<br />
many years ago, now the most fabled social commentators in the country.<br />
Even Paul Lyneham and some of his colleagues in the ABC are feeling the<br />
pressures these days... . the Kerry O'Briens of this world are feeling the<br />
pressure from Roy and HG. And they came along with Triple J.<br />
But I think it also tremendous that Triple J's big contribution has been in<br />
breaking in new Australian bands and not just the Coral Snakes today, but<br />
INXS, Yothu Yindi, Midnight Oil, and more recently they first recorded and<br />
broadcast the Newcastle band Silver Chair which I now understand are on<br />
top of the charts. I mean, with that support, just imagine what I could have<br />
done with The Ramrods back then in the 60s. I mean I did take them from<br />
nowhere to oblivion, and with this sort of support... . the battle that I had to get<br />
them on the Parlaphone and I did and to get them played I knew every<br />
manager of every radio library in Australia. And I would always have the </p>
<p>sitting on the edge of the desk, trying to get it played the D-45' s as they<br />
were then.<br />
At any rate, the fact is that this is a great thing that Australia has become one<br />
of the music capitals of the world in popular music, and Triple J is of course,<br />
playing a tremendous role in all that. And of course, for apparently only 18<br />
cents a year it costs each of us only 18 cents a year, which is a little more<br />
value than 8 cents a day. Probably not, because I do think the ABC has<br />
stuck to its last and stuck to its charter, and I am not ashamed to say I am<br />
very proud to say that I am a core supporter of the ABC and Triple J.<br />
And of course, the other thing is it's about the only station -in the country<br />
where you would expect to find a woman disc jockey, which is also a<br />
breakthrough for Australian radio because it is rather monopolised.<br />
I would like to just say that this you know, you wonder when you pass these<br />
budgets, and the appropriations go out, whether it is money well spent, but I<br />
think this extension which is $ 20 million worth to these 22 regional areas,<br />
and I am told we go something like by 1996 Triple J will reach 44 regional<br />
areas and cover an additional 4.7 million people, then with 80% of the<br />
population. A far cry from the thing which Moss Cass kicked off in 1975 and<br />
which has come along from as someone said earlier that small studio in<br />
Darlinghurst. So, the Government is delighted to be involved with it to find a<br />
place where young Australians can identify certainly a radio station they<br />
can identify with, something that is not a bit provincial or parochial, that is<br />
unmistakably Australian, and to see this development is a great pleasure for<br />
all of us.<br />
Last week I had the pleasure of launching what we call the Youth Training<br />
Initiative, and this is about saying to young Australians that we in this country<br />
care about them, we want to pass our sense of optimism on to them, that we<br />
won't let them slip out of the school system to be unemployed, that we will<br />
pick every one of them up and case manage them that is individually relate<br />
to them and try to get them back into mainstream study or to work experience,<br />
or into a job and that comes as well as the linkages now between secondary<br />
school and TAFE, the building of a proper vocational education system with<br />
TAFE, and the massive extension of the university system. But I think the<br />
commitment which we have made to young Australians that nobody under<br />
the age of 20 should basically drop out of the system without being cared for,<br />
without being someone an individual person case managing them, talking to<br />
them, finding out about their aptitude, their educational standards, their<br />
interests, and getting them back into study or work is the sort of commitment<br />
a country this wealthy ought to make to its young people. That was launched<br />
last week, and I know that Triple J has a program of its own the Triple J<br />
Extension which is about much of the same thing, and that is giving young<br />
Australians a voice, and a role in the future.<br />
So I can think of no better medium than Triple J to talk about issues which<br />
affect young people, to let them listen to the music that they like, to discover<br />
the Australian bands that in the past were there but incapable of discovery, </p>
<p>3<br />
and to punch out a peculiarly and authentically Australian mssage and<br />
sound. This is a tremendously good development in our communications.<br />
Let me congratulate everybody associated with Triple J and the ABC to<br />
David Hill and his colleagues and to say that the Government will continue<br />
to support the ABC and Triple J, and let's hope that by 1996 we see this huge<br />
extension into provincial and rural Australia, and we see truly a national<br />
network come from it. It is with great pleasure that I launch this shift to 22<br />
regional areas this broadcast to 22 regional areas as a further affirmation<br />
of our faith in Triple J and its message to young Australians. Thank you.<br />
ends. </p>
