COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA.<br />
SPEEC-H<br />
BY<br />
Rt. Honi. R. G. MENZIES, M. H. R.,<br />
ON<br />
CONSTITUTION* ALTERATION ( SOCIAL<br />
SERVICES) BILL 1946.0<br />
[ From the " Parliametary Debates," 3rd. April, 1946.]<br />
Mr. = EZIES ( Kooyong-Leader of<br />
the Opposition) [ 3.52].-In 1944, the<br />
Government put forward a number of<br />
proposed amendments to the Constitution-<br />
a very substantial number which<br />
finally reached about seventeen-and the<br />
people, were given one vote in relation to<br />
all of these amendments, because they<br />
were included in one bill. As honorable<br />
members know, the proposals were rejected.<br />
At that time, the Attorney-<br />
General ( Dr. Evatt) pressed very<br />
strongly, not once but many times, for<br />
a non-party approach to the problem, and<br />
he consistently emphasized that questions<br />
of constitutional power should not be<br />
determined along party lines. It cannot<br />
be said that that ambition was entirely<br />
realized; nevertheless, there were honorable<br />
members on this side of the House<br />
* who gave support. to the Government's<br />
proposals. -The Government has now<br />
changed its mind on both points. As to<br />
the first, I have no regret. It is a good<br />
thing that questions should come before<br />
us in three bills instead of in one.<br />
* That removes one of the difficulties which<br />
arose on a former occasion. However,<br />
the. Goyvernmient proposes to hold a<br />
2638. referendum on these proposals on the<br />
same day as the general elections. That<br />
involves at once the abandonment of a<br />
non-party approach to them.<br />
HONORABLE MEMBERS.-Why<br />
Mr. MENZIES.-Because the dominant<br />
reason why caucus has decided to<br />
have the referendum on polling day is<br />
that it desires to confuse people into believing<br />
that a vote for -constitutional<br />
amendment necessarily will involve a vote<br />
for the Government, * and that a vote<br />
against the Government will in some way<br />
be regarded as against one or other of the<br />
referendum proposals. After all, honorable<br />
members opposite must not think<br />
that we are children in these matters.<br />
When a government decides to have a<br />
referendum concurrently with a genefeal.<br />
election, the inference is quite obvious.<br />
-Mr. BuRkE. The right honorable<br />
gentleman is battling very hard for<br />
points. Mr. MENZIES.-The honorable meihber<br />
for Perth ( Mr. Burke) will not even<br />
be able to battle for points at the. general<br />
election; it will he a clean knock-out.<br />
However, I * am quite unmoved because<br />
junior members on the Government side </p>
<p>of the House resist my suggestion. I do<br />
not observe that any experienced member<br />
would care to deny it.<br />
In 1944, the Opposition put forward a<br />
reasoned amendment to the proposals then<br />
made by ihe Government, and the last<br />
paragraph of this amendment was as<br />
follows:-That provision should be made for the setting<br />
up, within a period of two years after the<br />
termination of actual hostilities, of an elective<br />
popular convention for the review of the<br />
structure and working of the Constitution.<br />
We still believe that such a convention is<br />
essential. Indeed, it might be a very good<br />
thing if we adopted the practice of holding<br />
such conventions periodically-I do<br />
not mean at short periods, but at substantially<br />
long periods-in order that the<br />
working of the Constitution might be reviewed<br />
in a proper atmosphere and in an<br />
objective way. Our belief that thert<br />
ought to be a convention is strengthened<br />
by the character of the amendments now<br />
before us, some portions of which are<br />
good, whilst others are open to very<br />
serious criticism. The total character of<br />
them, taken together, is that they are<br />
hurriedly assembled and piecemeal. I<br />
propose to deal in turn with each of the<br />
three proposals-social services, marketing,<br />
and employment-and I propose to<br />
examine them in a critical, but constructire<br />
way. Where I take exception to<br />
something I shall make positive suggestions<br />
in relation to it. The secondreading<br />
debate on bills designed to amend<br />
the Constitution should present a great<br />
opportunity to the House for a pooling of<br />
ideas, and therefore, whilst I shall be<br />
critical on some matters, I shall not<br />
make a merely blank, negative approachto<br />
them.<br />
I turn first to the social services amendment.<br />
This is a proposal to alter the<br />
Constitution by including power in relation<br />
to maternity allowances, widows'<br />
pensions, child endowment, unemployment,<br />
sickness and hospital benefits,<br />
medical and dental services, benefits to<br />
students, and family allowances. The<br />
Phlarmaceutical Benefits case, which was<br />
recently decided by the High Court, has<br />
undoubtedly produced some real questions<br />
as to the validity of social services other<br />
than invalid and old-age pensions. This<br />
matter of the power of the Commonwealth<br />
to make appropriations at large or for purposes not to be found elsewhere<br />
in section 51 of the Constitution, was<br />
debated to some extent in this House on a<br />
former occasion. Up to the time of the<br />
decision of the High Court, apart from<br />
some obversations in an earlier case, the<br />
Commonwealth practice had uniformly<br />
been over a long term of years to rely<br />
upon a wide interpretation of section 81<br />
of the Constitution. It reads-<br />
All revenues or moneys raised or received by<br />
the Executive Governmneant of the Commonwealth<br />
shall form one Consolidated Revenue<br />
Fund, to be appropriated for the purposes of<br />
the Commonwealth.<br />
The question that has existed since the<br />
words were written into the Constitution<br />
might be put in this way: when section 81<br />
authorizes this Parliament to appropriate<br />
money for the purposes of the Commonwealth,<br />
are those purposes to be found<br />
in the legislative and executive powers<br />
specifically conferred by the Constitution,<br />
or does " the purposes of the Commonwealth"<br />
mean any purposes that the<br />
Commonwealth Parliament may think<br />
proper? The first is a narrow interpretation<br />
and the second a wide interpretation<br />
of the words. Quite plainly, if the narrow<br />
interpretation applies, there are<br />
many appropriations made by this Parliament<br />
that are either invalid or doubtful.<br />
For 40 years the Commonwealth<br />
Parliament acted on the wide view. I<br />
think that can be said about governments<br />
of all political complexions that have<br />
occupied the treasury bench. The High<br />
Court did not, in precise terms, decide<br />
that question in the Pharmaceutical<br />
Benefits case. I think the Attorney-<br />
General will agree that, in some of the<br />
judgments, one does not find that neat<br />
question neatly determined; but, at the<br />
same time, I think that erusal of the<br />
judgments indicates a reaS doubt as to<br />
whether, if a challenge were made, the<br />
wide power of appropriation would be<br />
upheld. I say, if challenge were made<br />
because there are some matters within<br />
the scope of this proposition that have<br />
never been challenged. Maternity allowances,<br />
for example, have always been subject<br />
to this question, but have never been<br />
challenged, and, I daresay, would never<br />
be challenged; but, in the event of a<br />
challenge, there are doubts, and, therefore,<br />
it is proper that those doubts should<br />
be resolved in relation to social services, </p>
<p>to which this Parliament attaches importance.<br />
These doubts might have been<br />
resolved in one of three ways. They might<br />
have been resolved by a reference of power<br />
from the States under Section 51, paragraph<br />
( xxxvii.). I know that the<br />
experience in seeking references of<br />
power from the States of. late has<br />
not been an entirely happy one, but<br />
I greatly doubt whether either House<br />
of any State Parliament would refuse<br />
a reference of power that would<br />
validate such matters as, by way of<br />
example, child endowment and widows'<br />
pensions. That is one method that<br />
might have been pursued. It is the<br />
method that we believe should have<br />
been pursued. The second method is<br />
to have a referendum taken separately<br />
from the general elections, so<br />
that genuine election issues shall not<br />
be confused by questions of constitutional<br />
power. After all, in general elections, the<br />
prime conflict is between political programmes<br />
and policy, and the moment that<br />
is confused by arguments on constitutional<br />
power there might be produced<br />
entirely strange results; results not expected<br />
by either side in the political<br />
conflict. The third method is one that<br />
the Government has adopted, a referendum<br />
taken concurrently with the general<br />
elections. I say quite plainly that, in the<br />
circumstances, the way will be open to a<br />
great mass of skilful propaganda, in<br />
which the merits of the constitutional<br />
issue may entirely disappear. The Government<br />
has adopted the third method,<br />
unwisely, in my view, and has taken<br />
the occasion to include new items.<br />
The proposed amendment, the terms<br />
of which I have just read to the<br />
House, specify certain matters about<br />
which there is no argument at all.<br />
Widows pensions, maternity allowances,<br />
child endowment and family allowances<br />
are common ground to all parties in<br />
the House, and we all support the removal<br />
of any doubt as to their validity. Unomployment<br />
and sickness benefits, hospital<br />
services and medical and dental services<br />
are, in their turn, most desirable,<br />
but we believe, as honorable gentlemen<br />
opposite know, because for some time we<br />
have made no secret of our views on this<br />
matter, that those things should all<br />
come within the scope of some form of<br />
236S.-2 national insurance, and, therefore, would<br />
have been much better dealt with<br />
by expanding or clarifying, as the<br />
case may be, the Commonwealth's<br />
insurance power under section 51, paragraph<br />
( xiv.) of the Constitution. Having<br />
stated those general views, I add a few<br />
words about some of the expressions employed.<br />
Take the phrase " medical and<br />
dental services", as a separate head of<br />
power, because it is so stated. The expression<br />
is very curious. The learned<br />
Attorney-General was questioned about<br />
this during his second-reading speech.<br />
Dr. EVATT.-It says provision of".<br />
Mr. MENZIES.-I am sorry. Yes,<br />
provision of and then the other words<br />
follow later. The Attorney-General was<br />
questioned about this during his secondreading<br />
speech. I agree that it was as<br />
the result of the question that he said<br />
what he did, and I do not desire to tie<br />
him to anything he said without having<br />
weighed what he was saying. But the<br />
right honorable gentleman was asked by<br />
the honorable member for Warringah<br />
( Mr. Spender) whether this power<br />
would enable the . Commonwealth to<br />
nationalize the medical and dental professions.<br />
The Attorney-General said-<br />
The Commonwealth could obtain the services<br />
of medical and dental practitioners, nurses and<br />
the like for that purpose; but the proposed<br />
alteration would not enable the Commonwealth<br />
to say, " We shall make all members of the<br />
medical and dental professions part of the<br />
service of the Commonwealth<br />
Mr. ARCHIE CAMERoN.-Why not?<br />
Dr. EVATT.-We shall be able to do everything<br />
necessary and incidental to providing<br />
these services. That is a very wide power.<br />
Sir EARLE PAGE.-Would this provision control<br />
the registration of doctors. and dentists?.<br />
Dr. EVAT.--Not the general registration.<br />
I he right to practise in those . professions is<br />
rovwrp-d by State law. This proposal would<br />
not affect that, nor would it affect the right<br />
( if a doctor or a dentist as an individual to<br />
practise his profession.<br />
Mr. McEwEN.-Would it not override the<br />
State laws?<br />
Dr. EVATT.-It would enable the Commonwealth<br />
to make use of the services of doctors<br />
anl dentists to provide national medical and<br />
dental services.<br />
With very great respect, I believe that<br />
explanation to be inadequate. I am<br />
rather disposed to think that on reflection<br />
the right honorable gentleman will agree<br />
with me. Recently, in the High Court,. </p>
<p>the Airlines case was decided. It was a<br />
case that attracted great atention, and<br />
in it the High Court decided unanimously<br />
that a power to make laws with respect to<br />
trade and commerce among the States<br />
included a power to set up a government<br />
airline, -under a government corporation,<br />
though, by reason of section 92 of<br />
the Constitution, that airline could<br />
not be given a monopoly. In other<br />
words, the Commonwealth Government<br />
could not prevent another company<br />
from engaging in the business<br />
of interstate flying, but it could,<br />
under the trade and commerce power, set<br />
up a government service.. That was not<br />
an obvious decision. As the Attorney-<br />
General knows, that finally disposed of a<br />
problem that had arisen once or twice<br />
in the past in the court and very many<br />
times outside the court, because there was<br />
one view that the trade and commerce<br />
power is a power to regulate trade and<br />
commerce in the hands of those who<br />
carry it on, and not a power enabling the<br />
Government to engage in it.<br />
Mr. FALSTEIN.-In any case, there is<br />
an appeal pending to the Privy Council.<br />
Mr. MENZIEIS.-An application for<br />
special leave to appeal has been announced.<br />
What will happen I do not<br />
know. All I can do is to discuss the<br />
matter on the unanimous finding of the<br />
High Court, and its view was that the<br />
trade and commerce power enables the<br />
Government itself to set up an airline and<br />
does not confine the Commonwealth Parliament<br />
to regulation of airlines in the<br />
hands of other people. Apply that to the<br />
power to provide medical and dental services.<br />
There is no real question of inter'i<br />
state trade and commerce in the provision<br />
of medical or dental services, and so it<br />
is not likely that section 92 will be<br />
brought into this argument. In those circumstances,<br />
very little doubt exists that<br />
not only the words of the proposed<br />
amendment but also the decision of the<br />
High Court will mean that under those<br />
words, the medical and dental professions<br />
could be nationalized by making all<br />
doctors and dentists members of one government<br />
service which had a monopoly<br />
of medical and dental treatnient. In that<br />
sense, this power includes a power to<br />
nationalize medicine and dentistry. Mr. CHAMnERS.-IS there anything<br />
wrong with that?<br />
Mr. MENZIES.-I have a very great<br />
objection to nationalizing the medical<br />
profession, but that is a matter of practical<br />
politics which, perhaps, we can discuss<br />
more fruitfully on another occasion.<br />
I am poipting out at present what the<br />
power will do. As there is no immediate<br />
urgency about this problem, it is a great<br />
pity that the Government does not defer<br />
Sit, pending consideration of the whole<br />
Constitution by a convention along the<br />
lines that have been suggested from this<br />
side of the House. After all, a national<br />
convention, duly elected, might come to<br />
the conclusion that it would be better to<br />
give to the Commonwealth Parliament<br />
full power over public health as such<br />
than to deal with the problem piecemeal.<br />
Similar comment upon piecemeal. and<br />
rather ambiguous treatment arises in relation<br />
to the reference to sickness and<br />
hospital benefits. After all, these are<br />
matters which deal with results rather<br />
than causes, and, if I may say so, experience<br />
of the last few months under the<br />
legislation that has been passed shows<br />
that the proposed powers are much more<br />
likely to be exercised langely for<br />
ind-ustrial ends than in a real attempt<br />
to deal with the problem of<br />
health. In this country or in any<br />
other country, the problem of health is<br />
dealt with not merely by looking at<br />
certain results and trying to deal with<br />
them, but by seeking causes and trying to<br />
deal with them. In the long run, social<br />
preventive action may prove to be much<br />
more important than medical treatment.<br />
The other phrase about which I desire<br />
to say a few words is the expression,<br />
" benefits to students". I am a<br />
little uncertain as to the scope of<br />
this. I have no doubt that many<br />
benefits to students-benefits which are<br />
very liberal, and I have a warm appreciation<br />
of what has been done in<br />
that regard-are being provided under<br />
the repatriation powers of the Commonwealth.<br />
As far as it goes, the expression<br />
is quite all right, but again, it deals with<br />
only a fraction of the total problem-the<br />
total problem being the assistance of<br />
education generally. Grants to the States<br />
in aid of education, I agree, can in any </p>
<p>event be safely made under section 96<br />
of the Constitution, and they should be<br />
made, because for reasons which I<br />
discussed at some length on an earlier<br />
occasion, it seems to me that, as time<br />
pas. ses, the Commonwealth is bound. to<br />
accept increasing responsibility for education.<br />
Therefore, my reference to " benefits<br />
to students is made, not with a view<br />
to condemning government action for the<br />
purpose of benefiting students-I support<br />
it-but to point out that it represents<br />
only one small fraction of a total<br />
problem, and, consequently, represents<br />
what I describe as a piecemeal treatment<br />
of a large problem.<br />
I turn from that matter to the second<br />
bill, upon which I desire to make some<br />
suggestions for the consideration of the<br />
House. The second measure deals with<br />
marketing, and I make two preliminary<br />
observations about it. This<br />
problem, so far as it deals with section 92<br />
of the Constitution-freedom of interstate<br />
trade-was omitted from the referendum<br />
of 1944. Marketing was included<br />
in the referendum, but there was nothing<br />
about qualifying the effect of section 92.<br />
Now, it is stated to be a matter of such<br />
urgency that it must be put before the<br />
people at the forthcoming election. My<br />
second preliminary observation is that<br />
this proposed amendment is entirely<br />
different from the one put forward by<br />
the Lyons Government in 1936-37. I<br />
want to explain that with some care, because<br />
there is a disposition in some<br />
quarters to believe that this particular<br />
proposal merely takes up a proposal with<br />
which a number of us on this side of the<br />
House were very actively associated in<br />
the referendum of 1937, and which agitated<br />
parties in such a way that a great<br />
number of people found themselves in<br />
opposition to it, who will undoubtedly<br />
find themselves supporting this one. On<br />
that occasion the proposal was that a new<br />
section-section 92A-should be inserted<br />
in the Constitution in these terms-<br />
The provisions of the last preceding section<br />
shall not apply to laws with respect to marketing<br />
imnade by or under the authority of the<br />
Parliament in the exercise of any powers<br />
vested in the Parliament by this Constitution.<br />
The whole idea of that proposed amendment,<br />
which would have prevented section<br />
92 from invalidating a marketing law, was that validity should be given to<br />
joint Commonwealth and State marketing<br />
schemes. Honorable members will recall<br />
that before the war we had a great deal<br />
of experience-some of it very painfulcf<br />
these matters. The Commonwealth and<br />
the States went into joint schemes in<br />
relation to wheat and dried fruits. Each<br />
State passed a bill which dealt with<br />
trade in that commodity within its<br />
own boundaries, and the Commonwealth<br />
then put the coping stone on the structure<br />
by passing legislation which dealt with<br />
interstate trade in the same commodity,<br />
and it was hoped that between the two<br />
sets of legislation, the whole field of<br />
transactions in that commodity would<br />
he dealt with.<br />
Mr. SCULLIN.-What if one State stood<br />
out of the scheme?<br />
Mr. MENZIES.-If that State was not<br />
concerned with the production of that<br />
particular commodity, there were occasionally<br />
ways and means of overcoming<br />
the problem. The real difficulty arose,<br />
not from the abstention of ainy one State,<br />
but because section 92 cropped up and<br />
invalidated attempts which were made to<br />
restrict the interstate movement of goods.<br />
In that condition of affairs, we had certain<br />
good elements and one very bad<br />
element. The good elements were these:<br />
It is a very good thing to have joint<br />
Commonwealth and State action on marketing<br />
matters. After all, the States control<br />
a great number of factors which the<br />
Commonwealth does not touch. The<br />
States are in charge of land settlement,<br />
agriculture, water supply, and production<br />
policies generally, whilst the Commonwealth<br />
had power to deal with interstate<br />
trade which enabled it to come to the<br />
lescue, provided section 92 did not operate<br />
to destroy the scheme. Another<br />
advantage was that Commonwealth and<br />
State schemes were invariably the subjectmatter<br />
of discussion between the governments.<br />
They became well known to the<br />
producers who were affected, and there<br />
was a general opinion developed, and a<br />
very wide representation of producer<br />
opinion at all relevant times.<br />
What the proposed amendment contemplated<br />
in 1936-37 was simply to prevent<br />
section 92 from invalidating joint<br />
Commonwealth and State marketing<br />
schemes. The proposed amendment in </p>
<p>the bill sets out to do something quite<br />
different. It is designed to give to the<br />
Commonwealth power to deal with the<br />
organized marketing of primary products.<br />
That is a new power to be conferred<br />
upon the Commonwealth Parliament, and,<br />
as the Attorney-General pointed out in<br />
his second-reading speech, it is a power<br />
which will operate upon intrastate trade<br />
just as much as upon interstate trade.<br />
In other words it is a power which will<br />
enable the Commonwealth to deal with<br />
marketing transactions which begin and<br />
end in one State, and, consequently, it<br />
proceeds upon the footing that all that is<br />
needed is a single Commonwealth control<br />
and not joint Commonwealth-State control.<br />
That, of course, means that there<br />
is a very sharp) distinction between this<br />
amendment and thiolnee with which some<br />
of us were associated some years ago.<br />
Mr. HOLT.-And also the proposed<br />
amendment of 1944.<br />
Mr. MENZIES.-Yes. In brief, it is<br />
now proposed to transfer the whole field<br />
of the organized marketing of primary<br />
products to the Commonwealth, and to<br />
render co-operation with the States un-*<br />
necessary. That would produce a state<br />
of affairs in which the problems of production,<br />
which would still remain primarily<br />
problems for the States, and the<br />
problems of marketing, which would<br />
become, in effect, exclusively the problems<br />
of the Commonwealth, would be dealt<br />
with entirely separately, subject to this<br />
qualification,, that the Commonwealth, by<br />
marketing legislation, might very well be<br />
able to exercise an indirect control over<br />
production without having any real<br />
responsibility for it. That would be a<br />
bad business. It would be very unwise to<br />
deal with the problem of production and<br />
the problem of marketing in entirely<br />
separate compartments, each under the<br />
authority of a different legislature. It<br />
was for that reason that before the war<br />
we saw so clearly the great<br />
merit of joint Commonwealth and State<br />
action. I would have thought that it<br />
would be clear to most of us that, if the<br />
organized marketing power were to be<br />
used in order to stabilize prices, the'<br />
volume of production would probably<br />
have a direct relation to the stabilized<br />
prices. Yet, utinder these proposals the volume of production, except for the indirect<br />
pressure which I have described,<br />
would remain a matter for the six State<br />
Parliaments, whereas the problem of the<br />
stabilized price would be under the jurisdiction<br />
of the Commonwealth Parliament.<br />
To put it in another way, volume of production<br />
miay be determined by the policies<br />
of six State governments and the price<br />
stabilization scheme would be under the<br />
exclusive control of the seventh Parliament,<br />
the Commonwealth Parliament. In<br />
using the word " exclusive" I do not<br />
de( ire the Attorney-General to take me<br />
as saying that it is not a concurrent<br />
power, but the exercise of it will make it,<br />
in effect, an exclusive power, because it<br />
will invalidate all State schemes inconsistent<br />
with it.<br />
The second comment I wish to make on<br />
the proposed amendment turns upon the<br />
expression primary products". That<br />
expression is not defined. The Attorney-<br />
General brushed this problem aside by<br />
saying-In the ordinary popular sense primary products<br />
are understood to include not only the<br />
immediate products of such occupations as the<br />
agricultural, dairying and pastoral industries,<br />
but also certain processed goods derived<br />
directly from those products. All Australians,<br />
for instance, would immediately recognize<br />
butter, cheese, flour and dried fruit as primary<br />
products, though not cakes or bread.<br />
I do not desire to use too strong an expression,<br />
but it seems to me that that<br />
statement is rather astray and somewhat<br />
misleading, if I may use that term inoffensively.<br />
The expression primary<br />
products" is not a technical one, and,<br />
indeed, so far as I have been able<br />
to discover, it is almost peculiar to<br />
Australia. My search through the<br />
Oxford Dictionary recently indicated that<br />
apparently the editor of that work had not<br />
met the expression at all. Where an<br />
expression is used in a constitution,<br />
and that expression is not one of technical<br />
law, the meaning of it must be ascertained<br />
by the courts ' by evidence, the perusal of<br />
books, records and statutes, and by other<br />
means. By reference to contemporary<br />
sources, the courts must determine<br />
whether there is an accepted and popular<br />
meaning for it. So if this amendment be<br />
accepted by the people, the High Court<br />
will be called upon, from time to time, to </p>
<p>decide whether, as these words are understood,<br />
butter, cheese, coal, sugar, iron ore<br />
or anything else, is a primary product.<br />
Mr. SCULLIN.-Butter is sometimes<br />
said to be a secondary product.<br />
Mr. MENZIES.-Both the right<br />
honorable member for Yarra and I would<br />
have a little difficulty, I venture to'say,<br />
in regarding butter produced from a factory<br />
as a primary product; yet the<br />
Attorney-General says that under this<br />
legislation butter would be deemed to be<br />
a primary product. . I should think it a<br />
novel use of language to say that a flour<br />
miller is a primary producer, yet we are<br />
as. surcd that flour would be regarded as a<br />
primary product. Factories are to be<br />
found in the capital cities of Australia<br />
which manufacture large quantities of<br />
cheese; yet we are told that a commodity<br />
like cheese must be regarded as a primary<br />
product. Mr. ARCHIE CAMERON.-The best illustration<br />
would probably be butter and<br />
margarine. Mr. MENZIES.-A good argument<br />
could be developed in respect of those<br />
products. It would hardly be suggested<br />
by most people that margarine is a<br />
primary product, yet some forms of margarine<br />
are just as close to the original<br />
source of production as is butter.<br />
It may interest honorable members to<br />
know that at least one definition of<br />
primary production has been endorsed<br />
by this Parliament. For almost as long<br />
as there has been an Income Tax Assessment<br />
Act, that measure has contained a<br />
definition of primary production".<br />
Let me say at once that I do not contend<br />
that that definition would bind any court,<br />
but it would be one source of information<br />
available to a court to determine what<br />
these words mean, because, as the<br />
Attorney-General knows, it has been the<br />
common practice of the High Court, in<br />
determining the meaning of words in a<br />
constitution which are not terms of art, to<br />
consult contemporary sources including<br />
contemporary statutes. The words<br />
" primary production" are defined in<br />
the Income Tax Assessment Act as<br />
follows:-Production resulting directly from the cultivation<br />
of land or the maintenance of animals<br />
or poultry for the purpose of selling them or their bodily produce, including natural increase,<br />
and includes the manufacture of dairy<br />
products by the person who produces the raw<br />
material used in that manufacture.<br />
The production of farm butter would<br />
come within that definition, but the production<br />
of butter in a factory in<br />
the ordinary course would not come<br />
within it, nor would the flour produced<br />
by a flour-miller or the cheese made by a<br />
cheese-maker come within the definition.<br />
It should be clearly understood by the<br />
public that the expression " primary<br />
products ithough it will unquestionably<br />
include wool, wheat and live stock, may,<br />
and probably will, turn out not to include<br />
articles which result from processing certain<br />
goods.<br />
Mr. ABBOTT.-What about fellmongers'<br />
wool? Mr. MENZIES.-That is another<br />
instance. In fact, the whole subject of<br />
processed products in a form which is not<br />
the form in which they come from the<br />
farm would have to be considered.<br />
Mr. HOLT.-What about tinned fish?<br />
Mr. MENZIES.-I hope that honorable<br />
members will not invite me to say<br />
now what I think does and ' what does not<br />
fall within the definition. That question<br />
will have ' to be determined one fine day<br />
by the High Court and not by us.<br />
It will be determined in the light of such<br />
material as the court can get together.<br />
If there is to be a power to deal with<br />
primary products as distinct from others,<br />
then I suggest to the Attorney-General<br />
that, with all its difficulties, some definition<br />
should be undertaken; otherwise,<br />
many people who believe that they are to<br />
have the benefit of organized marketing<br />
will never obtain it. The more I consider<br />
the terms of this amendment, the more<br />
remarkable it seems to me that the<br />
Government should have departed from<br />
the substantial terms of the 1936-37<br />
amendment. The very point that I have<br />
just been raising is another confirmation<br />
of that. The final point that I want<br />
to make on this amendment is this: The<br />
word " organized" also is one of uncertain<br />
meaning. All marketing conducted<br />
under the authority or by<br />
direction of the law may be said to be<br />
in one sense organized since the law<br />
may be said to put such marketing into<br />
working order. </p>
<p>Mr. SHEEHAN.-Straw-splitting.<br />
Mr. MENZIES.-I am sorry that my<br />
friend should think that a contribution<br />
of this kind is mere " straw-splitting".<br />
It is not designed to be straw-splitting<br />
Everybody, and most of all the Attorney-<br />
General, will agree that the more thought<br />
we give to the words that we write into<br />
a constitution-words that are not altered<br />
so easily as are those of an ordinary<br />
statute-the better. If the honorable<br />
member is quite satisfied to have his<br />
constitution-making done in a slapdash,<br />
indifferent way, and regards every careful<br />
examination of the language used as<br />
mere straw-splitting the Constitution<br />
will turn out to be a very bitter disappointment<br />
to him. If this view as to the<br />
meaning of the word organized prevails,<br />
then the whole of the law relating<br />
to the sale of primary products, including<br />
the setting-up of boards, the licensing<br />
of those engaged in transactions, and the<br />
prices and terms and conditions of sales<br />
will pass into the hands of the<br />
Commonwealth. The third bill also lends itself to some<br />
comment. It deals with the terms and<br />
conditions of employment in industry.<br />
The wording is short-<br />
Section fifty-one of the Constitution is<br />
altered by inserting after paragraph ( xxxiv.)<br />
the following paragraph:-<br />
( xxxiv. A.) Terms and conditions of employment<br />
in industry, but not so as to authorize<br />
any form of industrial conscription:<br />
Paragraph ( xxxiv. A.), now proposed, will<br />
immediately precede the existing paragraph<br />
( xxxv.), perhaps the best-known<br />
paragraph in the Constitution, which<br />
reads-Conciliation and arbitration for the prevention<br />
and settlement of industrial disputes<br />
extending beyond the limits of any one State.<br />
When the bill first arrived, and this<br />
provision manifested itself, I had<br />
anticipated that paragraph ( xxxv.) was<br />
being repealed. But it is not being<br />
repealed. This new power is being added<br />
to the list of powers in section 51; therefore,<br />
in the event of its being adopted<br />
by the people, it will take its place side<br />
by side with the conciliation and arbitration<br />
power as it now stands. From<br />
a drafting point of view, and from the<br />
point of view of results, I confess that<br />
that astonishes me; and my astonishment grows when I consider the very brief<br />
explanation that was given by the learned<br />
Attorney-General, who said this-<br />
The new power which the bill proposes to<br />
give to this Parliament will not in any way<br />
abrogate or curtail the existing industrial<br />
powers given by section 51, paragraph xxxv.<br />
The new power, however, will supplement the<br />
present conciliation and arbitration power in<br />
two vital respects.<br />
Re then went on to describe the direct<br />
legislation which could be passed. I<br />
want to put this to honorable membersperhaps<br />
it may be a little complex, but<br />
I believe it to be important: If paragraph<br />
( xxxv.), the present conciliation<br />
and arbitration power, were repealed,<br />
and the new power in paragraph<br />
( xxxiv. A.) were given its full interpretation,<br />
clearly it would enable<br />
the Commonwealth, either by direct<br />
legislative enactment, or by the setting<br />
up of tribunals, or both, to<br />
regulate all the terms and conditions<br />
of employment, including, of<br />
course, wages, hours, and so on. The<br />
Attorney-General will agree with that.<br />
In other words, paragraph ( xxxiv. A.),<br />
the proposed new power, is so farreaching,<br />
that under it the Commonwealth<br />
could deal with the terms and<br />
conditions of employment as it thought<br />
fit. It might decide to have them dealt<br />
with through the arbitration court, or<br />
through a series of tribunals. It might<br />
decide to deal with them by direct legislative<br />
enactment. It might decide to have<br />
a little of each in the way in which it<br />
dealt with the matter.<br />
Mr. HUGHEs.-It could also set up<br />
another court.<br />
Mr. MENZIES. Oh, yes.. The<br />
choice of the means available to the Parliament<br />
to carry out the new powers<br />
would be unrestricted. But paragraph<br />
xxxv. is not repealed; it still stands,<br />
and, still standing, it must be given some<br />
meaning. You cannot leave words in the<br />
Constitution deliberately, and at the<br />
same time deprive them of all meaning.<br />
The courts will come to the conclusion<br />
that paragraph ( xxxv.) must be<br />
given a meaning quite independent of<br />
this new power, since it will continue to<br />
be independently stated. Therefore,<br />
it is highly probable that paragraph<br />
( xxxv.) will be interpreted as containing<br />
an exclusive code on the<br />
subject of industrial conciliation and </p>
<p>arbitration. In other words, the<br />
court will say, " Where the Constitution<br />
wants to deal with conciliation and<br />
arbitration, it uses the express terms<br />
' conciliation and arbitration for the prevention<br />
and settlement of industrial disputes<br />
extending beyond the limits of any<br />
on State' That is the constitutional<br />
provision in respect of conciliation and<br />
arbitration. Therefore, the new power<br />
has to be dealt with as not including conciliation<br />
and arbitration. That is the<br />
only way in which you can reconcile these<br />
two powers. Otherwise, the new power<br />
completely abolishes the old power, which<br />
becomes mere surplusage. The result of<br />
that would be indeed curious. It would<br />
mean that this Parliament could legislate<br />
for a 40-hour week; it could pass an act'<br />
prescribing a basic wage; it could, if it<br />
thought fit, pass an act containing a<br />
model set of conditions which were to be<br />
applied to all people; but, so far as the<br />
Arbitration Court was concerned in its<br />
task of dealing with industrial disputes,<br />
it would still be subject to the limitations<br />
under which it now works-in other<br />
words, it. would still be confined to an<br />
interstate dispute, and that dispute would<br />
still need to be an industrial dispute, and<br />
so on, and all the technicalities that have<br />
been evolved in relation to paragraph<br />
( xxxv.) would continue to operate.<br />
Mr. F. ALSTEIN.-This is purely the<br />
opinion of the right honorable gentleman;<br />
it is not the factual position.<br />
Mr. MENZIES.-Of course, I am<br />
stating my opinion! I hope that it is<br />
a respectable one on matters of this kind.<br />
I go further, and say that I shall be<br />
very surprised if the honorable member<br />
finds himself disagreeing with it. As<br />
honorable members may realize, I have<br />
given a good deal of thought to this<br />
matter, and I do not want to have any<br />
confusion in relation to it. I am stating<br />
my view. If the Attorney-General finds<br />
himself in possession of another view, I<br />
shall listen to that view with very great<br />
respect. To sum up: On that interpretation,<br />
which is the only interpretation<br />
that makes any sense of<br />
leaving paragraph ( xxxv.) in the Constitution,<br />
the court would still be<br />
subject to all its jurisdictional difficulties.<br />
I suppose that there is hardly a trade<br />
union official in Australia who has not found himself in a position to complain<br />
about the technicalities that are involved<br />
in the limitation of the court's jurisdiction.<br />
To adopt a scheme like this,<br />
leaving the conciliation and arbitration<br />
power untouched, and putting in this<br />
other power of direct legislation on<br />
industrial conditions, is really to make<br />
the worst of both worlds. After all,<br />
the prescribing of industrial conditions<br />
has become so special a task . and requires<br />
so prolonged an examination, and such a<br />
careful balancing of evidence, that it has<br />
become a fixed part of Australian policy<br />
for 40 years to entrust this responsibility<br />
to independent arbitral tribunals. If<br />
there is one thing that has characterized<br />
the Australian treatment of<br />
an industrial problem, it has been<br />
our evolving of this system of compulsory<br />
industrial arbitration, with<br />
matters being determined objectively by<br />
independent arbitrators. To take it<br />
crudely away from those tribunals by<br />
concentrating on the new power, and<br />
giving the " go-by" to arbitration, would<br />
be merely to make it a matter of political<br />
offer and counter-offer at a general<br />
election. Whatever may be the temptation<br />
to some of us at some time or other<br />
to consider that it would not be<br />
a bad idea to be able to make<br />
an offer to the electors of a shorter<br />
working week, or a bigger wage,<br />
the fact still would be that such<br />
a competition, regularly pursued, would<br />
invite disaster for the country. Quite<br />
frankly-and I say this with great<br />
personal respect for honorable membersthe<br />
Parliament is not qualified to determine<br />
the basic wage or standard hours,<br />
because no member of Parliament could<br />
hope to have more than a mere fraction<br />
of the information that is possessed by<br />
the Arbitration Court when it approaches<br />
such a task. Above all, at a-time when<br />
our greatest problem is that of restoring<br />
and increasing our production, any<br />
catch-as-catch-can" methods of dealing<br />
with factors which bear so closely upon<br />
production might very well prove to be<br />
nationally ruinous. If the Government<br />
had desired to preserve arbitration, but<br />
to get rid of technicalities in the arbitration<br />
jurisdiction, and to pave the way<br />
for the most flexible and simple<br />
machinery, surely its right course would </p>
<p>have been, not to write in this new power,<br />
but to amend paragraph ( xxxv.), so that<br />
it would read " conciliation and arbitration<br />
for the settlement of the terms<br />
and conditions of employment in industry<br />
In one hit, all jurisdictional<br />
difficulties would disappear. No longer<br />
would there be arguments as to whether<br />
there was an interstate dispute. But the<br />
court, and not the Parliament, would<br />
proceed to settle the terms and conditions<br />
of employment, and could deal1 with that<br />
problem all over Australia.<br />
There are just three supplementary<br />
observations that I want to make,<br />
and I shall have done. The first<br />
of them is this: The view which I<br />
have put forward-that paragraph<br />
( xxxv.), the existing conciliation and<br />
arbitration power, will continue to<br />
be interpreted as an exhaustive and<br />
limiting definition of the conciliation<br />
and arbitration power-is, I believe,<br />
strongly supported by the fact, very<br />
well known to the Attorney-General,<br />
that paragraph ( xxxi.) of section<br />
51-that is to say, the paragraph<br />
which deals with the acquisition of<br />
property on just terms from any<br />
State or ' person, &amp; c.-has been so interpreted<br />
as to give to it and its terms<br />
a full operation, notwithstanding the<br />
normal implications that may have been<br />
made in other paragraphs. But for the<br />
existence of paragraph ( xxxvi.), it might<br />
have been said that the exercise of any<br />
one of a dozen powers in section 51 would<br />
have authorized Parliament to pass a law<br />
taking someone's property, and on that<br />
taking there would be no limitation<br />
whatever. Dr. EvATT.-Paragraph ( xxxvi.) deals<br />
with them all.<br />
Mr. MENZIES.-Yes, and it has,<br />
therefore, been given a universal operation.<br />
It is the code on the subject of the<br />
acquisition of property. If there is in<br />
the Constitution specific reference to<br />
legislation on conciliation and arbitration<br />
that provision becomes the code of such<br />
power on that point. My second comment<br />
is this: It may be said that the<br />
States have always had power to make<br />
laws directly dealing with wages and<br />
hours of work, and that, in spite of this<br />
fact, no disaster has followed. It is an<br />
argument which I can almost hear the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) using in<br />
the most disarming fashion. Our industrial<br />
history shows that after the Parliament<br />
of New South Wales enacted the<br />
44 hours week, the. High Court decided<br />
in the Cowburn case that the State act<br />
had no application to any case governed<br />
by an award of the Commonwealth Arbitration<br />
Court. Up to that time there had<br />
existed a pleasing belief that there was<br />
never any inconsistency between a Commonwealth<br />
and State law, provided a person<br />
was hopeful enough or rich enough<br />
to obey both. By the High Court's<br />
decision, the New South Wales act<br />
was so limited in its application<br />
that it became, to a very large degree,<br />
useless, and, in any event, gravely<br />
anomalous; because, if there are two<br />
authorities dealing with hours of work,<br />
one by statute and one by awards, the<br />
anomalies to which such a situation would<br />
give rise must produce many industrial<br />
troubles. Consequently, ever since there<br />
has been a Commonwealth Arbitration<br />
Court, the scope of State legislation<br />
on such matters as I have<br />
mentioned has been restricted. But<br />
the moment the Commonwealth assumes<br />
power to legislate directly<br />
legarding wages and hours of work, pegging<br />
of wages, &amp; c.-even assuming that<br />
my earlier argument about the Arbitration<br />
Court is wrong-the functions of the<br />
court become so shrivelled that the court<br />
falls into a position of secondary importance.<br />
It becomes little more than a<br />
board of reference to deal with some<br />
minor adjustmerts outside the major<br />
rules laid down by Parliament.<br />
The last phrase of the new power isand<br />
I can almost hear the discussion which<br />
preceded its framingbut<br />
not so as to authorize any form of<br />
industrial conscription.<br />
Mr. CONELAN.-What is wrong with<br />
that? Mr. MENZIES.-It is a very distinct<br />
echo of the last referendum campaign. I<br />
can imagine the honorable member for<br />
Griffith saying, " This is no good. I<br />
have just been studying the referendum<br />
figures. For heaven's sake let us get away<br />
from any suggestion of industrial conscription<br />
No doubt it is a very shrewd<br />
move. </p>
<p>Dr. EvArr'.-The words are taken from<br />
an act passed while the Leader of the<br />
Opposition was Prime Minister.<br />
Mr. MEñ NZIES.-Yes, and they were<br />
inserted in the act in recognition of a<br />
strong demand from the Labour parfy.<br />
If'industrial conscription connotes industrial<br />
compulsion by the authority of law,<br />
will the amendment exclude compulsory<br />
unionism? It is a matter upon which I<br />
should like some enlightenment. If the<br />
High Court decides that the new paragraph<br />
contains a full and express statement<br />
of the industrial law, I should like<br />
oiue assurance that the defence power<br />
will be available in the event of another<br />
wvar to uphold man-power controls, which,<br />
on the Government's own showing, were<br />
vitally necessary during this war. My last word is this: I have studied<br />
these three bills. I have pointed<br />
out various aspects of them which, in<br />
my opinion, deserve criticism, and other<br />
aspects in which improvement might be<br />
made by applying different methods; but<br />
all this leads to the conclusion that the<br />
proper course would have been to take<br />
steps to validate those social service<br />
measures which command general support,<br />
while putting all these other questions<br />
before a convention which might<br />
examine points of substance and draftsmanship<br />
witb a -view to placing before the<br />
people proposals which would not be<br />
discussed during a general election campaign,<br />
and would not excite dispute along<br />
party lines.<br />
