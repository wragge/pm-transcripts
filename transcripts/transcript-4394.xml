PRIME MINISTER<br />
piRc pRESS 11 MAY 1977<br />
ADDPXESS AT CPiAMPAIGN DINNER, ADELAIDE<br />
I want to speak to you tonight about the referendums which<br />
Australians will be voting on in ten days time.<br />
The success of the referendums will make a major contribution<br />
to the constitutional development of our country. They are<br />
fair, sensible and just proposals, to reform the constitution,<br />
and I am sure that they will be successful.<br />
Many referendums in the past have been lost, often for good reason,<br />
because many of them have sought imore power for Canberra. But thesf<br />
referendums are fundamentally different. They do not seek more<br />
power for the Commonwealth. They do not seek -more power for<br />
politicians. In no way do they weaken the states-<br />
These referendums also meet two further requirements which, it<br />
is cleart are essential prerequisites for constitutional chnange<br />
in Australia.<br />
rirst, there has been wide ranging prior consultation with all<br />
states and parties. The proposals were carefully considered at<br />
the Hobart Constitutional Convention last year, which was attended<br />
by the Commonwealth, all the states, local government, and all the<br />
major parties. The principles of all four referendums were adopted<br />
overwhelmingly by the Convention.<br />
Second, the changes are supported on a bi-partisan basis by all<br />
the manjor federal parties. Each of the four proposals passed in<br />
the House of Represefttatives without a single dissenting voice,<br />
and all were passed by an overwhelming majority in the Senate.<br />
Every single South Australian Member of the House of RepresentativeE<br />
and every South Australian Senator, without exception, voted Yes on.<br />
all four proposals.<br />
I am glad to have the full support of the South Australian<br />
Parliamentary Liberal Party, particularly David Tonkin and R~ oger<br />
Goldsworthy. We see the need to -place before the people proposals<br />
for constitutional reforms which meet all these requirements,<br />
and to support the constitutional convention which was initiated<br />
and this should be emphasised by the states.<br />
The four changes on which we shall be voting on 21 May are these-<br />
First, that elections for the Senate and House of Representatives<br />
should be held simultaneously. It is just plain common sense that<br />
federal elections always be held at the same time, and that the<br />
only time you have to vote in a federal election is when you have<br />
o<br />
ill<br />

<p>2<br />
to choose Australia's Government. This proposal means we will not<br />
have to vote in as many federal elections. It will also protect the<br />
less populous states lik South Australia..<br />
When there are separate elect'ions for the HRuse of Representatives,<br />
political leaders are tempted to confine their campaign to New South<br />
Wales and Victoria which have ovei 60% f the seats. But, if there<br />
is, at the same time, an election'qfr-the Senate, in which all states<br />
are equally represented, the c pignst be extended with vigour<br />
to all six states.<br />
Some have said that this referendum\ is unnecessary that simultaneous<br />
elections can be acbieved,' by bringing the House of Representatives<br />
election forward to coincide with that of the Senate. But that is<br />
neither practical nor a, desirable, iethd of achieving simultaneous<br />
elections. Under the present, rovibS of the constitution, the two<br />
Houses are nearly always out -oCT-iae. The Senate's term is backdated<br />
to the previous 1 July,-bui the term of Members of the House<br />
of Representatives dates from the time of swearing in, usually some<br />
weeks after the election. Unless the constitution is changed, the<br />
only way to bring the elections together would be repeatedly to cut<br />
short the term of the House of Representatives. The three year term<br />
is, however, already relatively short one of the shortest Parliamentar<br />
terms in the democratic world. Further reducing it would damage good<br />
government. Aost ximportantly, this proposal will maintain and strengthE<br />
the Senate and its capacity to protect the states. If this proposal is<br />
not passed, the future of the Senate will ultimately be put in jeopardy.<br />
It was quite by chance that in November 1975 when the liouse of<br />
Representatives was dissolved, Bills existed which created the circumstances<br />
permitting a double dissolution of both Houses. Had Liberal<br />
Senators not been liable to face the people themselves, so that their<br />
actions might be judged, a number of them would not have agreed to<br />
block supply. I myself would never have sought the blocking of supply<br />
from a Senate that would not itself have also faced the people of<br />
Australia. The Senators attitude was Soundly based because if any<br />
House of Parliament were to send another House to the polls while not<br />
itself being judged by the people, it would not survive.<br />
If double dissolution is not available, the only way to ensure that<br />
the Senate does face the voters, in such a constitutional crisis, is<br />
to have a normal half-Senate election. But under the constitution,<br />
that can only be held every third year. So for two years out of every<br />
three, the Senate cannot face the people to explain and justify its<br />
actions, even if every Senator desired such an election. In short,<br />
if you subscribe to the fundamental principle that the Senate should<br />
not be able to force the Government to the polls unless the Senators<br />
themselves face the voters at the same time, the constitution must be<br />
changed to ensure this will always occur. You can do this by voting<br />
Yes to simultaneous elections on 21 May.<br />
Alternatively, if Senators were to make the House of Representatives<br />
go to an election without facing the people themselves, then there<br />
would be a public outcry ggainst the Senate which could lead to the<br />
Senate's powers being restricted or abolished. Either of these<br />
alternatives would be bad for democratic Government bad for the<br />
states bad for Australia. That is why it is important that this<br />
referendum be passed. A No vote on May 21 is a vote for the ultimate<br />
destruction of the Senate and one of the world's best constitutions. / The second </p>
<p>3<br />
The second referendum proposal is that,, whenever a Senator dies or<br />
resigns, he will be replaced, for the remainder of his term of office,<br />
by a member of the same party. This/ will guarantee that your choice of<br />
parties for the Senate cannot be altered, by accident or design. Under<br />
the constitution as it now stands, a Senate vacancy can completely chan<br />
the party balance. It is fundamental to our democracy that only the<br />
people should determine the balance of the parties in the Senate.<br />
Once this proposal is accepted, the peoples choice will be preserved<br />
until they have an opportunity tota . eanother choice at the next<br />
* election.<br />
7 The third referendum proposal 4s to glve, 4oters in the Australian<br />
Capital Territory and Northern Territory' the basic right to vote in all<br />
future referendums. This / is a-fundamiental right all other Australians<br />
have. It is a right which use . to exist, but which was taken away-when<br />
the two Territories were creatd, kknow of no rational or reasonable<br />
argument for denying Terrtori_ vot4k \ this basic right. Territorial<br />
voters have the same obligations &gt; asiother Australians. They pay taxes,<br />
they are obliged to observe the laws of the Commonwealth, they vote for<br />
Members of Parliament, and the outcome of referendums affect them as<br />
much as they do other Australians. Our democracy is the weaker until<br />
this essential democratic right is restored to citizens in the Territor<br />
The fourth and final referendum proposal is to set a retiring age for<br />
federal justices. High Court justices would retire at 70 and the<br />
retirement age for other Federal Court judges would be determined by<br />
Parliament. The proposal does not affect the terms of judges already<br />
appointed to the bench. Most jobs have retirement ages, and for good<br />
reason. Judges are as affected by old age as the rest of us. It is<br />
only fair that after the age of 70 responsibility should be handed over<br />
to younger people. This is even more important now that the new system<br />
of Federal Family Courts has been set up. The judges will of course<br />
remain completely independent, just like state judges, all of whom are<br />
subject to a compulsory retiring age.<br />
All four referendum proposals are fair, just and reasonable. They<br />
have been extensively considered. They have the support of all major<br />
federal parties. They do not involve more power for Canberra. They<br />
will make the constitution work better.<br />
The polls show that all referendums have significant support in all<br />
states. But those people who think the referendum propositions should<br />
be passed cannot afford to be complacent. The referendums will not<br />
pass themselves.<br />
All people who care about constitutional and political reform in this<br />
country have a responsibility to work for the referendums. If we all<br />
do this, then the referendums will be passed, and we will have a<br />
constitution which serves Australia's needs more effectively. </p>
