The Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam, announced today that<br />
the Government has accepted the recommendations of the<br />
Industries Assistance Commission in its report on paper.<br />
The Government's decision to implement the<br />
Commission's recommendations will mean that a general rate<br />
of duty of 20 percent will apply to uncoated and coated<br />
printing and writing papers which represents a slight<br />
increase in the level of protection for uncoated papers<br />
compared with the existing specific General rate of $ 48.225<br />
per tonne and a slight decrease from the existing General<br />
rate of 22 for coated papers. The Commission also<br />
recommended that wrapping papers be dutiable at minimum rates.<br />
With the effective rate of protection being about the<br />
same as the recommended nominal rate of 20%, the industry is<br />
low cost by Australian standards.<br />
Mr Whitlam said that details of the customns tariff<br />
chftnges arising from the Government's decision will he announced<br />
when administrative arrangements to implement them have been<br />
finalised. CANBERRA. A. C. T. </p>
