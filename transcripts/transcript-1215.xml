AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL UNIVE~ RSITY BILL, 126.,<br />
Second Reading Speech by the Prime Minister,<br />
the Rt. Hon. Sir Robert Meniies WHouse<br />
ofRepresentatives. December, 1965.<br />
This Bill proposes several amendments to the Act under<br />
which the Australian National University operates. Some of<br />
these -amendments meet the desire of the University Council,<br />
agreed to by the Government, to abolish the office of Principal<br />
of the School of General Studies when Professor Herbert Burton<br />
retires at the end of this year. Professor Burton has, of<br />
course, rendered long and meritorious service bothas Principal<br />
of the School and before that as Principal of the former C3nberra<br />
University College. The other amendments, largely of a technical<br />
character, have also been proposed by the Council and accepted<br />
by the Government. The University Council, when seeking to have the position<br />
of Principal of the School of General Studies abolished, felt it<br />
desirable to have in its stead a part-time position of Deputy-<br />
Chairman of the Board of the School. The Government agreed.<br />
This position will not be occupied for a long period by any one<br />
person. Over the years its responsibilities will be shared by<br />
several. The new arrangement will give the School the same<br />
relationship to the Vice-Chancellor and the Council as the<br />
Institute of Advanced Studies now has through the existing office<br />
of Deputy-Chairman of the Board of the Institute. We have deemed<br />
it desirable to reco.-_ aze the status of the School of General<br />
Studies within the University by requiring the position of Deputy-<br />
Chairman of its Board to be chosen from among the Professors of<br />
the School. As the office of Principal of the School is a statutory<br />
one, it is therefore now necessary to delete from the Act all<br />
references to it and to insert, where necessary, references to<br />
the new office of Deputy-Cheirman of the Board of the School.<br />
This operation accounts for many of the clauses in this Bill.<br />
Associated -with this change is provision to relieve the<br />
Vice-Chancellor of his present obligation to preside at meetings<br />
of the Boards of the Institute end of the School ; vhen he is<br />
present. It is intended that the Deputy-Chairman of each Board<br />
should be empowered to preside aDt a meeting of that Bo~ rd at<br />
which the Vice-Chancellor is present, if called upon the<br />
Vice-Chancellor to do so.<br />
A further amendment deals with provision for securing<br />
representation of the University's undergraduzates on the Council.<br />
At present the undergriduates elect a member, but the person<br />
elected is required to be a student of the University being<br />
aged at least twenty-one and a graduate " of at least two years<br />
standing". Time has shown tiiat very few such eligible candidates<br />
are available. In cases where they gre available they tend to<br />
be out of touch with current undergraduate opinion. It has<br />
therefore been decided to remove the requirement th3t candidates<br />
have two years standing as a gradu~ te, with a consequent increase<br />
in the field of eligible candidates for election to the Council<br />
as the students' representative. </p>
<p>The opportunity has also been t! 3ken to insert a<br />
provision which will permit the University to enter into<br />
certain types of contracts without being obliged to use its<br />
common seal. This obligation has proved cumbersome in the<br />
University's more routine day to day business operations.<br />
The terms of this Bill would permit the University to dispense<br />
with the use of its common seal when entering into contracts<br />
which, if entered into by private persons, would not be reqUired<br />
to be under seal. A similar provision applies to certain other<br />
statutory bodies, for examn-le the Australian National Airlines<br />
Commission. A further provision is that which empowers the University<br />
to waive fees in the case of State Forestry Scholarship holders.<br />
N. hen the University undertook to establish a Department of<br />
Forestry, and to take over the work of the Australian Forestry<br />
School, which it did from the beginning of the 1965 academic<br />
year, it faced with doubts concerning its power to remit<br />
the tuition fees of Forestry students undertaking training on<br />
the nomination of various St3te Governments. By long standing<br />
Commonwealth-State agreement, no tuition fees have been paid<br />
by the States in respect of their nominated students at the<br />
Australian Forestry School. This amendment would permit this<br />
arrangement to apply without doubt in the new circumstances.<br />
It is Government policy for it to do so.<br />
In connection with the transfer of the responsibility<br />
for advanced forestry education from the Australian Forestry<br />
School to the Australian National University, legislative<br />
action is required to ensure that the provisiorp of the<br />
Officers' Rights Declaration Act, 1928-1959, apply to permanent<br />
Commonwealth Public Servants who were on the staff of the<br />
Australian Forestry School and have now acce,-ted ap-,., ointment<br />
with the Australian National University. Provision has<br />
accordingly been made in this Bill for the purpose, as a result<br />
of which those officers transferred will have to opt :% ithin a<br />
period of three months for employment under either Australian<br />
National University or Commonwealth Service conditions.<br />
Finally the opportunity is being taken in presenting<br />
the Bill to the House to repeal cartain sections of the<br />
Australian National Univarsity Act, 1960, the operation of which<br />
is now exhausted. The 1960 Act incorporated transitional<br />
provisions which wero re-! uire d as part of tae process of merging<br />
the former Canberra University College with t he original<br />
Australian National University. The sections for repeal are of<br />
a technical nature only.<br />
Mr. Speaker, I commend the Bill to the House. </p>
