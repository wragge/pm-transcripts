FOR PRESS P. M. No. 61/ 1964<br />
ESTABLISHMENT OF A JOINT AUSTRALIAN-AMERICAN<br />
EDUCATIONAL FOUNDATION<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon. Sir Robert Menzies<br />
The Prime Minister, Sir Robert Menzies, announced today<br />
that the Governments of the United States and Australia have<br />
agreed to establish a joint Australian-American Eduational<br />
Foundation. It will succeed and be modelled upon the Fulbright<br />
Scheme. Beginning with the present financial year, the two<br />
countries will contribute equally to provide an aniual budget not<br />
exceeding Å“ 180,000 to finance the exchanges between the United<br />
V States and Australia. The Prime Minister recalled that the Fulbright<br />
Programme came into being in 1949 as one of the elements in the<br />
settlement of Australia's debt to the United States under the<br />
final accounting of the var time lend-lease and reciprocal lendlease<br />
arrangements. At that time, the United States generously<br />
agreed to apply part of the money it received in settlement of<br />
these debts to financing the United States Educational Foundation<br />
in Australia. As a result, a Trust Fund equivalent in Australian<br />
pounds to five million dollars was set up. This Fund together<br />
with interest has since been used by the Foundation to fin, 3nce the<br />
Fulbright Programme of educational exchanges between the United<br />
States and Australia. It is now nearly exhausted and the two<br />
Governments, conscious of the great value that has been derived<br />
from the Fulbright Programme, and of the desirability of continuing<br />
with something similar, readily agreed to establish as equal<br />
partners a scheme to succeed it.<br />
Under the Fulbright Programme, Australians have<br />
received travel grants to enable them to visit the United States<br />
where they have taken up awards and posts made available by<br />
American institutions. Some of them have been lecturers and<br />
research scholers and others have been post-graduate students.<br />
The scheme has also provided travel grants to enable Australian<br />
teachers to exchange with American teaohers. Under the Fulbright<br />
Programme also, United States citizens in similar categories have<br />
been assisted to visit Australia by the provision of travel grants<br />
and allowances. The new Foundation will be controlled by a joint<br />
Australian-American Board of Directors, which will be established<br />
in Australia. The Prime Minister said that he had every confidence<br />
that under the new arrangements the educational exchange programme<br />
would at least match the great success of the present programme.<br />
The money available annually to the new Foundation will be above the<br />
annual expenditure in any year by the United States Educational<br />
Foundation in Australia. The Prime Minister added that this was only a<br />
preliminary announcement corresponding with one being made in<br />
Washington at this time by the United States Government. In due<br />
course there would be more detailed announcements of the terms of<br />
the agreement, and of the membership of the Board of Directors of<br />
the Australian-American Educational Foundation.<br />
