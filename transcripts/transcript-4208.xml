4~ UTHALIA&amp;<br />
FOR PRESS .8 AUGUST 1976<br />
OPENING OF GUILDFORD YOUNG GROVE -HOBART<br />
This is a very special day for the people of Hobart. It is<br />
a most significant day in the continuing development of this<br />
wonderful city.<br />
I -am delighted and honoured to be with you today to open this<br />
fine complex. The Knights of the Southern Cross, the Sisters<br />
of the Good Shepherd and of course the people of Hobart<br />
can take pride in the wonderful achievements.<br />
Im also very pleased to be able to publicly pay tribute to the<br />
work of His Grace Archbishop Young. I speak not only on<br />
behalf of the national government and of the Tasmanian community,<br />
but also on behalf of all of us ' mainlanders'.<br />
The special dedication of the Guildford Young Grove to His<br />
Grace is to me a most fitting tribute to a man who has dedicated<br />
22 years,-to achievements and leadership in the Archdiocese of<br />
Hobart. Of'course, the completion of this complex and this<br />
ceremony this afternoon has wider implication than appears on the<br />
surface.<br />
This day is surely a classic illustration of one of the real<br />
strengths of Australian society. And that is the willingness<br />
of men, vjoren and children from all walks of life to work<br />
together f or the wider benefit of the community.<br />
It's an example of what can happen when people toil tirelessly<br />
and selflessly when they ' put in'-to help those less able to<br />
help themselves.<br />
There is no doubt that the people responsible for this day lived<br />
the-. unwritten law that says " It's not what you can get out'<br />
of life, but what you can put into it".<br />
I am especially-pleased to perform this ceremony today because<br />
the Liberal NCP Governments social welfare philosphy places<br />
great emphasis on cooperative effort by community groups. We<br />
believe that interaction by individuals, groups and government<br />
at all levels is absolutely necessary for an effective approach<br />
to social welfare. </p>
<p>Only if community groups define their own needs -without<br />
unnecessary government interference will we have the<br />
diversity, choice and quality that we all want. We believe<br />
that all those dedicated people who make up the backbone<br />
of voluntary welfare orc-anisati ons make an irreplaceable<br />
contribution to the continuing growth and maturing of our<br />
great nation.<br />
You all know that we are committed to encouraging the kind of<br />
self help the building of this complex exemplifies. But let<br />
none of you think that the government then takes a step back<br />
and marches away. Let me be perfectly clear. Wle do not<br />
regard the efforts and of voluntary associations<br />
as an excuse for inactivity by the government. Rather, we<br />
seek to enhance the effectiveness of voluntray welfare action.<br />
In this case, the Commonwealth Government overall has contributed<br />
almost million towards capital costs.<br />
Since 1962 aged housing projects sponsored by the Southern Cross<br />
Association have recieved $ 6.6 million assistance. But let's<br />
face ' it, money alone will not solve all problems. Much more<br />
is required.<br />
Professor Henderson, after detailed investigation into<br />
Australian poverty, also came to this conclusion. Professor<br />
Hendersons's report said that Australian governments should<br />
be wary, of Falling into the inflationary trap ofE attempting<br />
to carry out so many social reforms or other public expenditures<br />
at once that they accelerate an inflationary spiral that does<br />
more damage to poor people than. the assistance provided by the<br />
reforms." So money is not enough. However, the way in which assistance<br />
is provided is of critical importance. Assistance should be<br />
provided in a way which helps people to be independent.<br />
The resources a poor family -needs to break out of poverty<br />
include information about opportunities in the social security<br />
! ystem as well as money.<br />
O f. course, many social welfare problems are not intrinsically<br />
financial. Rather, they are problems of human relationships,<br />
of organisation, and of approach.<br />
For example, a great deal has been spent on education over the<br />
past few years. School buildings and facilities have been<br />
improved. Yet despite this it is evident that our system of<br />
education is still far from perfect. The core of education<br />
remains the quality of the educations experience. And this is<br />
effected by the quality of teachings, the way the school is<br />
organised, attitudes of teachers and parents in other words,<br />
the relationship of school to family and the world beyond.<br />
It's not money but organisation, approach.<br />
I said earlier that we do not regard the efforts of voluntary<br />
organisationsas an excuse for inactivity by government. My<br />
Government's fundamental aim has been to provide assistance<br />
to those most in need in such a way that the community can . afford<br />
the cost. </p>
<p>3.<br />
We've done just this through family allowances and personal<br />
income tax indexation. Our family allowance scheme benefits<br />
300,000 Australian families and 800,000 children many of whom<br />
are below the poverty line. It has been hailed as the major<br />
reform in the Australian welfare system since Federation.<br />
Tax indexation will give protection for those hundreds of<br />
thousands of wage earners with large families near the<br />
minimum income.<br />
The frail and aged in the Australian community have received<br />
special care from the Government. From July 1 this year, the<br />
Government introduced a three year programme to assist the building<br />
of aged persons homes. $ 45 million will be provided this<br />
financial year and a further $ 180 million in the next two years.<br />
This three years programme will allow urgently needed accommodation<br />
to be provided for about 15,000 aged people throughout Australia.<br />
It will also assist voluntary organisations by ensuring a continuing<br />
of planning and building for the next three years. They will be<br />
able to borrow in this first year against the allocation for the<br />
remaining two years.<br />
The Government has also established a Committee into the Aged<br />
and the Infirmed. The Committee will report on the effectiveness and<br />
ef ficiency of existing, Government programmes f or the aged and inf irmed.<br />
The inquiry will assist the Government in deciding on a<br />
cohesive-framework for meeting,-the needs of this area of<br />
social welfare.. This Government believes that individualgroup<br />
and government participation is necessary to carry out an<br />
effective social welfare policy. This complex stands as a monument<br />
to the validity of our belief.<br />
It is a magnificent result for your own endeavours and a fitting<br />
tribute to your Archbishop. I have great pleasure in<br />
declaring " Guildford Young Grove" officially open.<br />
