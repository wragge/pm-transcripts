FOR MEDIA THURSDAY, 12 AUGUST 1982<br />
REPORCTFP iN' 7 7 EXEYR T GROUP ON PROT0' ECTION-ISM.<br />
TeCommonwealth Secretariat in.-London has released a Report<br />
entitled " Protectionism: Threat to International Order. The<br />
Impcton Developing Countries" prepared by a Commonwealth<br />
. group of independent high-level experts...<br />
-~ The Group of Experts.. was established as a result of an:.<br />
-Australian proposal at-the Commonwealth-Heads of Government<br />
Meigin Melbo-u-rne -in-OctL-ober -1981 -for. a study of the imipac t<br />
:-of protectionism on developing countries.<br />
The Report examines the effects of protection on developing<br />
countries, including the impact of tariff and non-tariff<br />
barriers on industrial and, importantly, agricultural products.-<br />
It concludes that a major element in a sustainable international<br />
trading s ystem is a fair and equitable place for developing<br />
countries. It makes clear that the present rules and<br />
procedures under the GATT have been least ef fective in combatting<br />
the growth of agricultural protection and non-tariff measures.<br />
The Report reflects the anxiety expressed by Commonwealth<br />
Heads of Government in the Melbourne Communique about the trend<br />
towards increased protectionism in international trade and<br />
their common resolve to advance the dialogue between developed<br />
. anddeveloping countL. ries. If offers an opportunity for<br />
Commonwealth consensus and leadership in discussions of these<br />
issues. Release of the Report is timely. Commonwealth Hleads of<br />
Government from the Asia-Pacific region will be meeting in<br />
Suva in October and will ha~ ve the opportunity to consider the<br />
Report's findings, only a month or so before the GATT<br />
Ministerial Meeting scheduled for the end of the November.<br />
*-An important contribution made the Report is the comprehensiveway<br />
it has drawn together a wide range of complex and important<br />
issues.<br />
-It will, therefore also be of interest to the wider international<br />
community in its discussions and negotiations on trade policy<br />
and reform which are so fundamental to a revival in the growth<br />
of world trade and recovery of the world economy. </p>
<p>2<br />
-The Report includes many reconmmendations on specific measures<br />
particularly directed towards the forthcoming GATT Ministerial:..<br />
and the work progam to which it should give rise for the<br />
decade ahead. While the details of the recommendations will<br />
be carefully studied by the Australian Government, the broad<br />
thrust of the Report's conclusions correspond to the<br />
Government's views on trade matters.<br />
Although directed specifically at developing country trade,<br />
the Report's conclusions offer further support for the Australian<br />
initiative on protection which is on the table for consideration<br />
-" at -the GATT Ministerial meeting. Indeed, in relation to<br />
agricultural trade the Re-port reconmmends a stcp-by-step approach<br />
to multilateral trade liberalisation along similar lines to<br />
the broader Australian proposal.<br />
The Group of Experts was chaired by Sir Alexander Cairncross,<br />
a former Head of the Government Economic Service in the UK.<br />
The eleven members included Professor Richard Snape of<br />
Monash University.<br />
I-extend my appreciation to the Group for their work and in<br />
-particular. to. Professor.. Snape . for his. valuable participation<br />
