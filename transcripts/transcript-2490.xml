WASHINGTON<br />
PRESS CONFERENC_$ AT BLAIR 11OUSF-,<br />
GIVEN BY THE AUSTRALIAN PRIME MINISTER, MR WILLIAM McMAHON<br />
2 NOVEMBER 1971<br />
Q W-hat was the President's reaction when you told him of<br />
the Cabinet decision of the training of Cambodian servicemen<br />
Pi I dealt with this against the background of what I had<br />
known. And I pointed out that first of all in a Statement I had<br />
made in the House I said we wou~ ld be retaining some advisory and<br />
training troops in South Viet-Nam to train the South Vietnamese and<br />
that we had agreed to train Cambodians in Australia and recently<br />
we had made in principle a decision to train Cambodian troops in<br />
South VietL--Nam in cooperation with New Zealanders and United Sft. ates<br />
people. But as yet we haven't been able to spell out in detail what<br />
is likely to happen. There was no intention whatsoever to train<br />
Cambodians in CAmbodia or te , ride advisers there. Nor was there<br />
any intention to provide combat troops in either South Viet-Nam or<br />
Cambodia. We accept this without any question.<br />
Q This is an in principle decision. THis is the one taken<br />
in CAnberra yesterday<br />
PM Yes.<br />
Q Did the Preqiident express any view o-F this decision given.<br />
PH No.<br />
Q Did he suggest that there might be ( INAUDIBLE) to Cambodia.<br />
PM4 No. He wouldn't be that sort of a person to be presenting<br />
a point of view and he did not.<br />
Q Sir, can you tell us why it was necessary to make the<br />
decision before you saw the President<br />
PM Wouldn't you have done so if you had been in my position?<br />
Feeling that it might be raised by Mr Laird with me. Or if not by<br />
Secretary Laird by Secretary of State Rogers. And by that time too<br />
I had received the letter from David Fairbairn. So consequently </p>
<p>2.<br />
I wanted to know Cabinet's views in case I was asked the question.<br />
You would have known though when you saw MR Laird of<br />
Cabinet's decision Well look I am not quite certain when I first received<br />
the information but I know I -told Secretary of State Rogers and<br />
I told the President what the position was and it is as I have just<br />
announced it to you.<br />
Are you concerned that you were not aware of the situation?<br />
I was concerned Yes But I did not consider it to be<br />
-a matter of, what shall I call it, very great importance. I would<br />
have liked to have known earlier though.<br />
Sir, have you asked for any investigations how it happened<br />
that the U. S. asked us to do this on September 30 and you did not<br />
find out until I think on the 26th<br />
No I haven't. You must know that I nm here for a particular<br />
purpose. I am here on matters ofgreat moment and importance to<br />
Australia and the Australian Government. I don't want to get involved<br />
in details at this time. I am sure Ir Anthony can look after<br />
it. And already the M4inister for Defence has given assurance that<br />
he will try to insure that it doesn't happen a gain.<br />
Do you feel that the actual decision for Australia to<br />
train troops in Cambodia doesnot mark any great departure from past<br />
policy Have you decided that in your absence to make this decision<br />
in a hurry and saw it as an important policy decision<br />
First of all there will be no intentions of training any<br />
troops whatsoever in Cambodia. There will be a training of Cambodian<br />
troops in Australia and a proposal that they should be trained jointly<br />
by the Americans, New Zealanders and ourselves in South Viet-Nam.<br />
Secondly when I arrived . Ln New York, or the day after I arrived in<br />
Ned York, I was handed Mr Fairbairn's letter in which he said he<br />
would shortly be raising it. And 1 think I gathered the impression<br />
that he had some hope that he might have been able to raise it with<br />
me before I left. 71-ell,~ after heztring a question which was raised<br />
in Canberra by one of your own representatives, I asked immediately<br />
about it when I got to San Francisco. I checked again and when I<br />
was in New York I made a further check and said... ' Look this has<br />
become public knowledge. Now please let me have an answer as to<br />
where we are moving', so that the Defence machinery and the Foreign<br />
Office knew what it intended to propose so there was no difficulty<br />
in presenting it to CAhinket at its next meeting.<br />
Mly question was you said ' Sure the announcement that we<br />
would be training Cambodian troops in Au : ralia was in the Defence<br />
Report. However that would seem to me to be a different matter<br />
entirely from training troops in South ViJet-Nam. ( ITAUDIBLE) From<br />
what you have said I gather you don't see this as a major policy<br />
change but just as a normal extension of what we are doing in Cambodia<br />
Yes, and part-' larly b~ ecause we are prepared to train<br />
South Vietnamese troops in American training centres in South Viet-Nam.<br />
I thought it was just an extension of the existing policy.<br />
/ 2. </p>
<p>Q Sir, was there a request from the Camb odian Governpemt to<br />
to train their men in South Viet-Nam<br />
PM That I don't know. I dcn't think there was WhatI_<br />
am trying to you are putting me through a cross examination<br />
-at a time when I have had so jnany tremendously important problems to<br />
deal with. But I havenot delved into this at all. I have wanted to<br />
-touch on other issues that are vital to the security of this country<br />
in the future and to learn more about American thinking on issues<br />
world issues of importance so I haven't gone any further than what<br />
I just said to you.<br />
Q Sir, we were told the other day that you had given your<br />
views to Cabinet on this matter. It seems to me that you would have<br />
gone into it fairly well before. Did you give your views to Cabinet<br />
PM What do you mean give my views to Cabinet It had never<br />
been raised in Cabinet while I was there.<br />
Q No but we were told that when you asked for Cabinet's<br />
decision you also conveyed your own views on the subject<br />
PM I felt that this was an extension of our existing policies<br />
insofar as it related to the South Vietnamese but in having said that<br />
I realized it was a matter that had to be dealt with by the Cabinet<br />
in'Canberra who have much better access to information than I had and<br />
they had to make a decision. But in principle they knew the way that<br />
my mind was trending.<br />
Q Sir on the question of Cabinet's decision does this mean<br />
that as small as it may be there will be Australian military advisers<br />
committed to Seuth Viet-Nam over and above those that we had decided<br />
to leave after we withdraw fighting troops.<br />
PM Again you are pressing me on something I can't get an<br />
answer to. I can't give it because I said so far that the decision<br />
is in principle and I have not seen the Cabinet papers on it. I<br />
have seen two cables from fir Anthony and no more. </p>
