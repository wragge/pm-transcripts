ELECTORATE TALK<br />
Last ThursdaLy, Defence Minister Jim Killen announced the<br />
Government's decision to acquire H. M. S. Invincible from the<br />
United Kingdom. This follows his announcement last October<br />
that Australia would acquire 75 FA18 aircraft from the<br />
United States as our new tactical fighter force.<br />
These are two of the most recent decisions in achieving the<br />
Government's; programme to develop our defence force and to<br />
enhance our overall defence capabilities. The Government's<br />
prime object~ ive is to develop a balanced defence force which<br />
has advanced capabilities in all services Army, Navy and<br />
Air Force. A balanced defence force is one in which the whole<br />
range of contingencies which might threaten our security<br />
can be met in a co-ordinated and integrated way.<br />
For land operations, we have an army which is equipped with<br />
the manpowerc, fire power and mobility to give it real teeth.<br />
Apqrt f rom its obvious f ighter and bomnber capabilities, the<br />
Air Force commands extensive resources needed to meet the<br />
transport arid surveillance needs of the armed forces. For its<br />
part, the Navy operates fast patrol boats and landing craft<br />
for in-shore work as well as highly flexible guided missile<br />
frigates and destroyers which can be used for both in-shore<br />
and deep oc-ean tasks.<br />
Modern warfare requires both high technologies and rapid<br />
communications so as to ensure that these capabilities are<br />
co-ordinated effectively. A modern and sophisticated ship like<br />
Invincible hias a crucial role in directing major naval task<br />
force operations.<br />
The Defence Force needs advanced command and control facilities<br />
which can support the movement of troops, aircraft and ships.<br />
With its special computers and control systems, Invincible<br />
will constitute a key element in the projection of combined<br />
air and naval power. Operating with our long-range Orion<br />
maritime control aircraft, the Fl-11 strike force, -the FA-18s<br />
our guided. missile destroyers and submarines, Invincible will<br />
be an exceptionally potent deterrent to any potential aggressor. / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
It is partly because Invincible offers these capabilities<br />
that the United Kingdom is very reluctant to part with it.<br />
Far from acquiring something which is second-hand or obsolete<br />
Australia is able to obtain a defence system which is regarded<br />
as being amongst the most advanced in the world., H. M. S. Invincible<br />
will provide a very substantial increase in Australia'snational<br />
defence capabilities, and will greatly enhance our<br />
ability to-deter aggression in our own region in the decades<br />
ahead. Australia's economic and social health depends on being able<br />
to maintain our trade. We need to be able to keep our trade routes<br />
open and counter any threat to them. Submari nes would present<br />
the most difficult type of threat for us to counter. With<br />
Invincible our ability to detect and destroy any submarine<br />
threat to our trade routes will be second to none in the region.<br />
For Australia,, a balanced defence force must have very highly<br />
developed anti-submarine warfare capability. But Invincible<br />
is not simply a platform for anti-submarine warfare. While it<br />
is particularly suited for operating large anti-submarine<br />
helicopters, it is not aimed at any single contingency.<br />
It could be used in a wide variety of military operations<br />
including the carriage of up to a battalion of troops, the<br />
co-ordination of air elements and the direction of naval<br />
units in combat. With these functions it adds a wide range<br />
of capabilities beyond those now available to us.<br />
The acquisition of a major new capability like Invincible<br />
will not only contribute significantly to the needs of a<br />
balanced defence force and to our security within our<br />
immediate region. Given the present threat levels of<br />
international tension, the Government intends to make sure<br />
th~ it Australia is fully equipped to contribute to the stiengthenjng<br />
of the Wes-tern alliance.<br />
With New Zealand and the United States, Australia has a<br />
crucial role in both the Pacific and Indian oceans, where<br />
advanced anti-submarine warfare capability and high grade<br />
command and control facilities are essential. Our position<br />
in the world is not so secure that we can take possible threats<br />
to our security lightly. While we have the advantage of<br />
distance from the main centres of potential. conflict, we cannot<br />
assume we will not be gravely affected by conflict whenever it<br />
may occur. For example, the security of our trade routes is<br />
essential for our economic survival. The field of defence is'<br />
one which is fraught with hard choices for all democratic<br />
countries. We are making decisions which at once protect<br />
our national interests and represent a reasonable investment<br />
of resources. 000---</p>
