SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS TOWARDS ITS GOAL OF ECONOMIC<br />
SELF-RELIANCE. THIS MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING WILL<br />
CARRY THIS MUTUAL OBJECTIVE STEADILY FORWARD. As<br />
OUR RECORD SHOWS, AUSTRALIA HAS NO NEO-COLONIALIST<br />
AMBITIONS IN PAPUA NEW GUINEA. WE WELCOME AND RESPECT<br />
PAPUA NEW GUINEA'S OWN COMMITMENTS TO SELF-RELIANCEINDEED,<br />
WE LOOK FORWARD TO PAPUA NEW GUINEA DIVERSIFYING<br />
ITS SOURCES OF AIDTHE<br />
NEW ARRANGEMENT WHICH IS THE THIRD AID AGREEMENT<br />
BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES CONTINUES THE WELL<br />
ESTtABLISHEID PRINCIPLE THAT THE REAL LEVEL OF AJSTRALIAN<br />
AID -0 PNG SHOULD FALL STEADILY AND, FOR YOU, AT A<br />
MANAGEABLE RATE EACH YEAR. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT<br />
PRINCIPLE WHICH REFLECTS THE CLEAR PREFERENCE AND MUTUAL<br />
INTEREST OF BOTH OUR COUNTRIES-IT WILL, I AM SURE,<br />
STRENGTHEN THE OVERALL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN OUR TWO </p>

DOLLARS IN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS-PAPUA NEW GUINEA<br />

INTERESTS OF BOTH OUR COUNTRIES AND IT HAS BEEN ACCEPTED<br />
AS A FAIR AND REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION OF. THE INTERESTS<br />
OF BOTH OUR GOVERNMENTS-IT IS THE CLEAREST POSSIBLE<br />
REFLECTION OF OUR WILL-AND ABILITY TO REACH AGREEMENT<br />

THE EXPANSION OF THAT PART OF THE AID PACKAGE WHICH WILL<br />
BE DIRECCTED TO SPECIFIC PNG DEVELOPMENT PRIORITIES BY<br />
MEANS OTHER THAN BUDGET SUPPORT-INITIALLY THIS WILL<br />
ItNVOL" E ONLY SMALL CHANGES FROM ESTABLISHED<br />
AA. GEVNTS-ALLOWING A GRADUAL SHIFT IN THE FORM OF<br />
AID AS THE TOTAL LEVEL OF AID FALLS OVER A LONG PERIODTHIS<br />
WILL ENABLE AUSTRALIAN EXPERTISE TO BE APPLIED<br />
DIRECTLY TO PAPUA NEW GUINEA'S PRIORITY DEVELOPMENT<br />
NEEDS-</p>
<p>THIS FORM OF AID PROVIDED BY WAY OF PROJECTS OR<br />
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PRESENTS A SPECIAL CHALLENGEOBVIOUSLY,<br />
WE WILL NEED TO WORK CLOSELY TOGETHER TO<br />
OPTIMIZE THE BENEFIT OF SUCH AID. WE NEED TO ENSURE<br />
THAT FUNDS ARE WISELY USED, AND THAT THEY GENUINELY<br />
