    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE....................</p>
<p>Thank you very much, Richard; to Shane Stone, the Federal President</p>
<p> of the Liberal Party, Ian Warner, Collin Barnett, my other Ministerial</p>
<p> and Parliamentary colleagues, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p>It is a great delight to be back again in Perth. Richard reminds me</p>
<p> of the visit I paid to Exmouth earlier this year. Yesterday when I</p>
<p> was flying back from the mine opening I had Barry Haase, the Liberal</p>
<p> member elected in the October election last year as the member representing</p>
<p> Kalgoorlie, the largest electorate of the world, and he pointed out</p>
<p> to me that in the nine months that he'd been the member for Kalgoorlie</p>
<p> in the National Parliament he'd found that as each month went by he</p>
<p> got increasingly quizzical looks from his Federal Parliamentary colleagues,</p>
<p> particularly those who represented safe Liberal electorates in Sydney</p>
<p> and Melbourne. And he said, 'I found out the other day the reason</p>
<p> why,' and he said, 'the reason, Prime Minister is that in the nine</p>
<p> months that I've been the member for Kalgoorlie you have visited my</p>
<p> electorate on three occasions.' And, in fact, I have. I went to Exmouth.</p>
<p> I went to the mine opening yesterday. And I'm told I was the first</p>
<p> Prime Minister for 19 years to visit Kalgoorlie only a couple of months</p>
<p> ago.</p>
<p>I mention that because one of the things I've endeavoured to do as</p>
<p> Prime Minister is to disabuse the Australian population of the idea,</p>
<p> however it might linger in the hearts and minds of some Australians,</p>
<p> that the centre of the world is that triangle of Canberra, Sydney</p>
<p> and Melbourne. And although I was born at one of the points of that</p>
<p> triangle I've tried very hard in the years that I've been Prime Minister</p>
<p> and the other jobs I've held to maintain very regular contact with</p>
<p> all parts of the country. And today, therefore, is not in any sense</p>
<p> a novel experience to address a business gathering in Perth. I've</p>
<p> done so on a number of occasions in a number of capacities over the</p>
<p> last 25 years. I'd have to say to you, though, that I can't remember</p>
<p> a time when I've addressed a business gathering here in Perth when</p>
<p> I could speak more unqualifiedly, If I can put it that way, about</p>
<p> the generic overall strength of the Australian economy.</p>
<p>As you know, a couple of weeks ago I visited Japan and the United</p>
<p> States. I didn't get very far on lamb and I was talking to John Rothwell</p>
<p> a moment ago and I told him I didn't get very far on the Jones Act.</p>
<p> The Jones Act is that little piece of perfidious American legislation</p>
<p> that says that unless it's an American based company and the keel</p>
<p> is laid in the United States you can't sell a ship into that country</p>
<p> to fly American waters or the American coast. But one thing I did</p>
<p> come away from America with and particularly from New York was without</p>
<p> doubt the most positive view that I have encountered in the financial</p>
<p> capital of the world about the general outlook for the Australian</p>
<p> economy.</p>
<p>I've been there 20 years ago as Treasurer. I've been there two years</p>
<p> ago as Prime Minister. I've been there on other occasions in other</p>
<p> capacities. But on this occasion I was able to tell a story and be</p>
<p> believed and hear good reports about the Australian economy in a way</p>
<p> that I hadn't experienced in the past. And one of the interesting</p>
<p> things about a political leader from Australia visiting the United</p>
<p> States is that there is often a sharp difference in the perception</p>
<p> of our country in financial centres like New York than there is in</p>
<p> Washington. Because sadly it remains the case that many of the senior</p>
<p> political figures in the United States have never visited Australia.</p>
<p>When I was in Washington I saw the Senate Majority Leader who's the</p>
<p> leader of the Republican Party. I saw the Speaker of the House of</p>
<p> Representatives who's also the senior ranking republican in the House</p>
<p> of Representatives. And I spoke to the man who I think could possibly</p>
<p> be the next President of the United States, the son of the former</p>
<p> President, George Bush Jnr, and none of those three gentlemen have</p>
<p> ever visited Australia. Yet when you go to New York and you talk to</p>
<p> the leaders of the financial community so many of them who have banking</p>
<p> and other interests in Australia, they have an intimate knowledge</p>
<p> of our country and they have an understanding of its great strengths.</p>
<p> And one of the many things I was able to tell them was that not only</p>
<p> did Australia get an enormous economic benefit from being able to</p>
<p> stare down the worst of the Asian economic downturn. But more importantly</p>
<p> than that the psychological gain to our country from knowing that</p>
<p> we were strong enough and good enough to work our way through the</p>
<p> worst downturn our part of the world has had since World War II has</p>
<p> given to the Australian community, not only to the business community</p>
<p> but to the Australian community generally, a belief in its own capacity</p>
<p> to do things that I don't think we've had at any time since I've been</p>
<p> in public life. And it's that belief in ourselves.</p>
<p>In the past we've talked confidently, we've felt confident domestically,</p>
<p> but in the minds of some there's always been a bit of a doubt as to</p>
<p> whether when the crunch really comes this country is efficient enough</p>
<p> and competitive enough and good enough to survive and beat the rest</p>
<p> of the world in enough areas to do well economically. And I think</p>
<p> any lingering doubts that any men and women in Australia may have</p>
<p> had about that have been removed in a very significant way by what's</p>
<p> happened over the last year. Because over the last year we have done</p>
<p> something that a lot of people in this room, I certainly would be</p>
<p> one of them, didn't think was feasible and achievable a year ago.</p>
<p> And that is to emerge from the Asian economic downturn stronger and</p>
<p> better than ever. I think the view of many, say in July or August</p>
<p> of last year, would have been, well, gee we've done well. We've eliminated</p>
<p> that budget deficit. We've got fairly strong growth. We've reformed</p>
<p> our industrial relations system. We've done a number of very good</p>
<p> things. We've got our interest rates down. We've got a good investment</p>
<p> climate. But sooner or later and probably sooner, that is by the end</p>
<p> of 1998, the Asian economic downturn will catch up with us and everything</p>
<p> will slow down and the economy will go into some kind of relatively</p>
<p> comatose state. Now, that didn't happen. And I think the realisation</p>
<p> that it didn't happen came to most Australians around Christmas and</p>
<p> in the early months of this year. And we began to see emerging a picture</p>
<p> of where because of a number of reforms that have been undertaken</p>
<p> in the Australian economy and because of very skilful management of</p>
<p> our exchange rate by the Reserve Bank we have been able to work our</p>
<p> way through the Asian economic downturn. And the secret of that, ladies</p>
<p> and gentlemen, was that the Australian economy has now become a lot</p>
<p> more flexible and competitive and resilient than what it was in the</p>
<p> past.</p>
<p>Although we've had our problems with the Americans on lamb - and I</p>
<p> make no apologies at all for the continued criticism we offer the</p>
<p> Clinton Administration regarding that - one of the interesting statistics,</p>
<p> and I try not to burden luncheons with too many statistics, about</p>
<p> the last year or so is that in 1998 we increased our exports to the</p>
<p> United States by 34 per cent. And that is an illustration of the way</p>
<p> in which, as Asia collapsed, we were able to shift the export destinations</p>
<p> of a lot of our products. And we were able to do that because we had</p>
<p> a flexible exchange rate. We were able to do that because we had created</p>
<p> circumstances of competition and flexibility in our community, particularly</p>
<p> our business community, that we hadn't had in the past. And when you</p>
<p> add together all of the reforms that have been undertaken, the fact</p>
<p> that we were able to get rid of that budget deficit of $10.5 billion.</p>
<p> We were able to reform our industrial relations system far more effectively</p>
<p> than many people believed so or gave us credit for at the time, particularly</p>
<p> in 1996. We were able to see the lowest inflation rate in 30 years,</p>
<p> the lowest interest rates in 30 years. All of those things combined.</p>
<p> So I am able to talk without fear of contradiction on the facts about</p>
<p> a very strong and optimistic business climate and economic outlook.</p>
<p> But in doing that I am very conscious that it is not uniformly a good</p>
<p> story. It is nationally a good story. The generic strength of the</p>
<p> Australian economy is greater and deeper now than I think it has been</p>
<p> for any time in the last 30 years.</p>
<p>And I do know, for example, that the mining industry, which is very</p>
<p> important to Western Australia, is suffering very badly from low commodity</p>
<p> prices. I'm particularly conscious, not only but including as a result</p>
<p> of my visit to Kalgoorlie, of the difficulties faced by the mining</p>
<p> industry. And I know how much the economy of this State depends upon</p>
<p> the strength and the resilience of the resource sector. I'm very aware</p>
<p> of the difficulty in many of the rural and regional areas of Australia.</p>
<p> I know that rural property continues to be a potential breeding ground</p>
<p> for radical and irresponsible political philosophies. We saw that</p>
<p> last year. We have seen a temporary abatement of the One Nation phenomenon</p>
<p> but we must keep the possibility of that in mind in all of our policy-making</p>
<p> decisions.</p>
<p>But overall, I'm able to paint an optimistic picture. I'm able to</p>
<p> report on the successful passage of the essentials of the tax reform</p>
<p> legislation. Now, I don't disguise my disappointment that we weren't</p>
<p> able to get 100 per cent of what we put up. Of course it would have</p>
<p> been better if the original package with the GST applying uniformly</p>
<p> to everything had been passed. But we lost our opportunity of doing</p>
<p> that when Senator Harradine said that he wouldn't support our legislation.</p>
<p> And we either faced the prospect of an unproductive election exercise</p>
<p> with no guarantee that even if we won the election we would have the</p>
<p> numbers at a joint sitting to pass the blocked legislation or we settled</p>
<p> for a compromise. The compromise like all compromises was not perfect</p>
<p> but to have delivered 85 per cent of what we wanted. It delivered</p>
<p> intact the taxation cuts to middle Australia that will mean 80 per</p>
<p> cent of Australian taxpayers will have a marginal rate of not higher</p>
<p> than 30 per cent after the 1st of July next year. With</p>
<p> some changes it has delivered the long-term reforms for Commonwealth/State</p>
<p> financial relations. It removes, and you saw the beginnings of it</p>
<p> yesterday, it will remove the wholesale sales tax and it will introduce</p>
<p> with more exemptions than we wanted, but nonetheless it is a huge</p>
<p> reform, it will see the introduction of a broad based goods and services</p>
<p> tax on the 1st of July next year. It will provide, I believe,</p>
<p> the biggest overhaul to Australia's taxation system that we have seen</p>
<p> since World War II.</p>
<p>So that, of course, is the first installment although by far the biggest</p>
<p> installment of taxation reform. The next chapter of taxation reform</p>
<p> is yet to receive in the course of the next week the final report</p>
<p> of John Ralph's Committee. I know he was here in Perth recently and</p>
<p> spoke to a number of you. I want to publicly record my gratitude to</p>
<p> him for the tremendous job that he's done. He's brought to that review</p>
<p> private sector sensitivities and an understanding of what is needed</p>
<p> in business tax.</p>
<p>He had a long experience in the mining industry. He is a respected</p>
<p> company director of a wide range of activities in his post Rio Tinto</p>
<p> days. And he has an understanding of the challenges of the political</p>
<p> process. And along with Bob Joss, the recently retired Chief Executive</p>
<p> of Westpac, and Rick Allert of the Southport Corporation, they represent</p>
<p> a very significant trio who have brought a great deal of business</p>
<p> understanding.</p>
<p>Now, I think all of us agree that there are a couple of goals we have</p>
<p> in common for business tax reform. We want change that will make Australia</p>
<p> more competitive. In a globalised world economy the name of the game</p>
<p> on all occasions is to make this country as competitive as possible.</p>
<p> And when it comes to attracting investment it means that as far as</p>
<p> possible the decision as to whether an American investor, because</p>
<p> that is still a major source of capital for this country, whether</p>
<p> the choice for an American investor between investing in the United</p>
<p> States and investing in Australia is as neutral as possible.</p>
<p>You are all aware that one of the issues that will need to be addressed</p>
<p> is the question of whether we opt for some lower general company tax</p>
<p> rate paid for in part by the removal of existing taxation concessions</p>
<p> that are of particular benefit to some companies but of less benefit</p>
<p> to others.</p>
<p>Now, I am aware of the arguments. I've had them put to me very strongly</p>
<p> and I will in the weeks ahead. And I can't at this stage predict what</p>
<p> our final decision on that will be. I do make some fairly obvious</p>
<p> points that people should wait until the report is in and the full</p>
<p> ramifications and the full detail of any recommendations made in that</p>
<p> area are in the possession of the Government and in the possession</p>
<p> of the community. But I can assure you that we aren't likely going</p>
<p> to embrace changes in that area that are going to cause unfair dislocation.</p>
<p> Equally, I want to see us have as attractive a general company tax</p>
<p> rate as possible because it goes to the increasing competitiveness</p>
<p> of the Australian economy.</p>
<p>And in this global world in which we all now live it's not any good</p>
<p> in two years time my saying that gee back in 1999 we were able to</p>
<p> boast that we stared down the Asian economic downturn if in two years</p>
<p> time some of the competitiveness we have now we have lost or that</p>
<p> our competitors have come from behind and moved ahead of us. Surviving</p>
<p> and doing well in today's economy is like a race that never finishes</p>
<p> and you have to always keep in front of the bloke who's there beside</p>
<p> you. And it's no good looking at it historically. It's no good saying,</p>
<p> look, we are doing better now than we were doing 10 or 20 years ago,</p>
<p> it's a question of how we are competing against the rest of the world</p>
<p> now. And we have no option but to accept that we are part of a global</p>
<p> economy and that, of course, has implications not only for the general</p>
<p> level of company tax it also has implications for capital gains tax.</p>
<p>I think there's a general feeling in the Australian community that</p>
<p> some changes to our existing capital gains tax regime are desirable.</p>
<p> I have had a lot of submissions, I have got a lot of advice and there'll</p>
<p> be a lot of detail in the report that Ralph delivers. But I think</p>
<p> at this stage all I can usefully say is that it wouldn't be a particularly</p>
<p> bold or reckless prediction to say that the capital gains tax is unlikely</p>
<p> to remain in precisely the form that it is at present. I think it's</p>
<p> fair to say that changes that make it more attractive for people to</p>
<p> invest in higher risk ventures, changes that will underpin the capacity</p>
<p> of this country to convert its inventive capacity to commercial advantage</p>
<p> are the sort of changes that the Government will be looking at.</p>
<p>Australia has a long and meritorious reputation for inventive discoveries.</p>
<p> For a nation of only just under 19 million people we have been very</p>
<p> inventive indeed. We have given to the world some remarkable ideas.</p>
<p> In a sense we have thought and punched above our weight in the world</p>
<p> so far as inventions are concerned. Sometimes we have been very bad</p>
<p> at turning those inventions to commercial advantage. And one of the</p>
<p> reasons could easily be, along with others, the inadequacies of our</p>
<p> existing taxation system.</p>
<p>Now, there are many other issues that arise out of business taxation.</p>
<p> Our goal is to retain the competitive edge we now have. If we retain</p>
<p> our competitive edge as a nation, if we run a low inflation, low interest</p>
<p> rate, flexible economy. Part of that is to make sure that our taxation</p>
<p> settings are right. Part of it is also to press ahead with further</p>
<p> reforms to the industrial relations system.</p>
<p>That is another area where the task of reform is never finished. And</p>
<p> two-and-a-half years ago we had people predicting that if a coalition</p>
<p> government were elected federally it would usher in a new era of industrial</p>
<p> disputation. It may not have escaped the notice of many people in</p>
<p> this room but last year, 1998, we had the lowest level of industrial</p>
<p> disputes for 86 years.</p>
<p>We have, in fact, seen in Australia over the last few years - this</p>
<p> has been aided by legislation at a State level as well as at a federal</p>
<p> level - we have presided over a quiet industrial revolution. We have</p>
<p> seen a gradual the accelerating change in attitudes in the workplace.</p>
<p> We have seen a greater concentration on workplace agreements. I am</p>
<p> increasingly told of the way in which in many areas of the mining</p>
<p> industry the negative implications of union membership have disappeared.</p>
<p> Now, that doesn't mean that there is no place for the trade union</p>
<p> movement in the Australian industrial relations scene, of course there</p>
<p> is. And that has never been our objective to remove unionism from</p>
<p> the industrial relations scene. But it has been our objective to elevate</p>
<p> the making of agreements at workplace levels between employers and</p>
<p> employees. And as Australia has increasingly done that so it is that</p>
<p> the productivity of our workforce has risen. But one of the reasons</p>
<p> why I can talk so confidently about the strength of the Australian</p>
<p> economy is that average wage and salary earners over the last few</p>
<p> years have enjoyed very significant increases in their real income.</p>
<p> The rate of wage increases has run well ahead of the rate of inflation.</p>
<p> But that has not created an economic problem because the productivity</p>
<p> of our workforce has risen by a significantly higher rate than was</p>
<p> the case five or 10 years earlier.</p>
<p>And when you add those real wage increases to the fact that the average</p>
<p> wage and salary earner in this country paying off a mortgage on the</p>
<p> family home is paying about $320 a month less - $320 a month less</p>
<p> - on the family mortgage. You have a recipe for a workforce whose</p>
<p> living standards now are significantly ahead of what they have been</p>
<p> for a long time.</p>
<p>But as all of you know the responsibility of a national government</p>
<p> and the responsibility of a prime minister is not just about economic</p>
<p> issues important though they are particularly to the business community.</p>
<p> But there are other challenges of a social character which are very</p>
<p> important and one of the things that I have tried to develop as important</p>
<p> to the Government that I lead is this notion of a social coalition.</p>
<p> The idea that the Government acting alone can't achieve all of the</p>
<p> community's goals, the idea that people left without any kind of support</p>
<p> or activity by the Government can't achieve their objectives. And</p>
<p> from that comes the idea that if we can marshal the collective resources</p>
<p> of the Government, the business community, individuals and the more</p>
<p> forward looking elements of the welfare sector in this country we</p>
<p> can deal more effectively with many of the social problems that we</p>
<p> face. And this is the philosophy that we try to bring to bear in things</p>
<p> like tackling the problem of drugs. And over the last couple of years</p>
<p> the Federal Government has committed itself to additional expenditure</p>
<p> of $500 million to try and reduce the devastating impact of drugs</p>
<p> on the Australian community. It's not an easy problem. I don't pretend</p>
<p> to have all of the answers to it, nobody has. And I don't pretend</p>
<p> that any one prescription is the right answer. And I think we can</p>
<p> find in the debate the threads that bring us to agreement in a number</p>
<p> of areas. We need to educate young people against the menace of drugs.</p>
<p> We need to provide resources to our law enforcement agencies to capture</p>
<p> and jail as many of the criminal peddlers in drugs as we can. And,</p>
<p> very importantly, we need to provide rehabilitation and support to</p>
<p> those who've been addicted and are trying to break the habit. And</p>
<p> amongst the things that I've done here in Perth was something I did</p>
<p> this morning in going to Cyrenian House just on the outskirts to re-name</p>
<p> that magnificent centre the Rick Hammersley Centre in memory of somebody</p>
<p> who made a great contribution to fighting the drug problem. And that's</p>
<p> a magnificent example of the coalition of which I speak. It has great</p>
<p> support from the State government. Rhonda Parker, the Minister responsible</p>
<p> was there. It had great support from the business community. It had</p>
<p> support from the Federal Government. But very importantly I spent</p>
<p> 20 minutes or so talking to some of the people who were there, away</p>
<p> from the glare of the media and talking to them and getting their</p>
<p> reaction and how they said that it was a facility that gave them,</p>
<p> for the first time, a sense of security. These are people who decided</p>
<p> to do something to break the habit. And they decided to go there as</p>
<p> a residential facility and I said, what's good about it. And they</p>
<p> said what's good about is that it gives us a sense of support and</p>
<p> safety and security while we grapple with trying to beat this devastating</p>
<p> habit. And those things are important and policy in those areas are</p>
<p> tremendously important to any government, be it a national government</p>
<p> or a State government. And that kind of facility is a great example</p>
<p> of how governments and the business community and the welfare sector</p>
<p> and individuals working together to achieve community goals can realise</p>
<p> great things.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, I want to thank you very much for the support</p>
<p> you show by coming along to this lunch. I can say on behalf of the</p>
<p> Federal Government that although we have achieved a lot over the last</p>
<p> three-and-a-quarter years that we are in no sense complacent. The</p>
<p> first party meeting I had after the victory in 1996 I warned my colleagues</p>
<p> about any sense of complacency. And over the last three-and-a-quarter</p>
<p> years we've, like any other government, we've had our ups and downs.</p>
<p> But we have kept our objective very clear and that is, at an economic</p>
<p> level, to make this country a world class competitor in a globalised</p>
<p> economy. And whether we like it or not we are a globalised world economy.</p>
<p> We can't change that. We either become a successful part of it or</p>
<p> we become an economic irrelevance. And that is the thing that has</p>
<p> guided us in getting the budget back into surplus a year ahead of</p>
<p> time. That guided us when we reformed the industrial relations system.</p>
<p> It guides us in our plans to privatise organisations like Telstra.</p>
<p> It guides us in our plans to maintain the rigor of competition policy</p>
<p> and it most certainly guides us in our plans to reform the Australian</p>
<p> taxation system. And I would like to be able to come back here in</p>
<p> a few months time after we've negotiated changes to Australia's business</p>
<p> taxation system through the Parliament, and that will be no easy task,</p>
<p> I'd like to come back here in a few months time and be able to report</p>
<p> to this gathering and a similar gathering here in Perth that we have</p>
<p> been able to bring about a major transformation in the Australian</p>
<p> business taxation system. So that once again the test and the yardstick</p>
<p> of competitiveness in the globalised economy can be applied in a very,</p>
<p> very positive manner.</p>
<p>Can I finally thank the Liberal Party organisation here in Western</p>
<p> Australia which is responsible for organising today's lunch, can I</p>
<p> thank you for the support that you've given me over the last year</p>
<p> as Prime Minister and the support that you and your colleagues continue</p>
<p> to give us in our great endeavour to maintain the competitiveness</p>
<p> and the strength of the Australian economy, the like of which I don't</p>
<p> think we've seen for more than three decades. Thank you.</p>
