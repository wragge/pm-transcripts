    <content><![CDATA[<p> <strong>9 October 1983</strong></p>
<p>I am deeply shocked at the bomb outrage in Burma in which members of President Chun's travelling party were killed.</p>
<p>Among the victims was Dr Hahm Pyonq Choon, the Korean Presidential envoy, with whom I met recently in Canberra.</p>
<p>President Chun and his party were due to arrive in Canberra on October 17 for an official visit and the Federal Governiient regrets greatly the tragic circumstances which have forced its cancellation.</p>
<p>The Federal Government extends its sympathy to the Korean Government and the Korean people.</p>
