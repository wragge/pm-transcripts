joint statement by the Prime Minister, the<br />
Hon P J Keating, and the Minister for<br />
Land Transport, Hon Bob Bro wn, MY.<br />
ONE NATION RAEL FUNDS FLOW TO NEW SOUTH WALES<br />
The Federal Government today approved a $ 28 million instalment of One Nation funding<br />
for ' early start' rail improvement projects in New South Wales.<br />
The money will generate 700 jobs.<br />
The funding targets rail projects on theSydney-Melbourne and Sydnev-Brisbane<br />
interstate lines to be used by National Rail formerly the National Rail Corporation.<br />
The Prime Minister, Paul Keating, officially opened National Rail's Parramatta<br />
headquarters today and announced that S$ 181 million of One Nation money would be<br />
allocated immediately to upgrade the network of track over which NR interstate freight<br />
trains will operate.<br />
Overall, the Federal Government has promised $ 454 million from One Nation for<br />
upgrading major interstate railway lines throughout Australia.<br />
Of the $ 28 million initial payment approved for New South Wales today, bridgeworks,<br />
sleeper replacement and minor track repairs on the North Coast account for the<br />
$ 9 million to be spent between Sydney and Brisbane<br />
Nineteen million dollars will be spent on the Sydney-Melbourne link.<br />
Included in this sum is $ 2.2 million for the design of a $ 71 million freight railway line<br />
between Campbelltown and Enfield, where National Rail will construct a new<br />
million state-of-the-art rail freight terminal in two years. NR will be able to consign<br />
freight from its own Sydney terminal without encountering delays caused by having to<br />
use the Cityrail passenger network. / 2 108b </p>

' By reserving this route for NR operations and upgrading the Melbourne-Sydney railway<br />
line, fast " Superfreighter" trains will travel between Sydney and Melbourne in just 12<br />
hours by 1994', Mr Keating and Mr Brown said.<br />
' The Federal Government will provide $ 15 million for Sydney-Melbourne track<br />
upgrading and rehabilitation in New South Wales. A $ 50 000 allocation will pay for<br />
design work as a prelude to curve realignment on the 35 km between Moss Vale and<br />
Exeter. ' Almost $ 2 million will be spent on design of four bridges to replace the Menangle<br />
Viaduct ( near Campbelltown), the Joppa Junction bridge ( near Goulburn), and viaducts<br />
at Wagga Wagga and Albury.<br />
' Replacement of the bridges will reduce transit times considerably on the Southern<br />
corridor, thereby enabling rail to increase its market share on the route. A superior<br />
railway line is also expected to reduce costs', Mr Keating and Mr Brown said.<br />
' On the Sydney-Brisbane link, the aim is to reduce interstate freight train travelling times<br />
by two hours to 16 hours, about the same journey duration as road transport. Rail's share<br />
of the freight task is expected to increase to 45 per cent in the long term'.<br />
Bridge replacements are planned near Casino, Grafton and Macksville. New structures<br />
will be able to withstand the 25 tonne axle loadings of trains running at speed'.<br />
