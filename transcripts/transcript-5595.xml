FOR MEDIA SATURDAY, 30 MAY, 1981<br />
DEATH OF PRESIDENT ZIA<br />
I was shocked to hear today of the untimely death of the<br />
President of Bangladesh, His Excellency Zia Ur-Rahman.<br />
President Zia took office at a time of particular difficult~ y<br />
for Bangladesh, shortly after the death of the first<br />
President and father of the newly independent nation,<br />
Muj ibur Rahman.<br />
He worked hard to overcome the many difficulties facing the!<br />
new nation, including the crushing problems of food shortag~ es,<br />
starvation and poverty. As a result, he was able to announce<br />
this year that food production in Bangladesh doubled during;<br />
the previous 12 months.<br />
In a country facing the population and food problems that<br />
Bangladesh faced this was a remarkable achievement indeed.<br />
President Zia was a strong supporter of the Commonwealth anid I<br />
had many contacts with him through the Commonwealth link.<br />
It was especially gratifying that President Zia attendedthe<br />
first Commonwealth Heads of Government Regional Meeting; in<br />
Sydney in 1978.<br />
All Australians will join with me in expressing their sorrow<br />
at this tragic event and their support for the Government and<br />
the people of the Bangladesh nation in meeting the difficul~ ties<br />
that lie ahead-of them.<br />
Australians will be particularly concerned that the President<br />
was apparently killed by an assassin. This is the third occasion<br />
in a matter of months that a world leader has been the subject<br />
of political violence. Words cannot express the abhorrence!<br />
that Australians feel about events of this nature; they<br />
deserve the strongest condemnation by all people.<br />
