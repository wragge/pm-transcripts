STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
in the<br />
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,<br />
Tuesda 23rd October, 1962<br />
Honourable Members will bi aware of President<br />
Kennedy's broadcast in relation to Cuba,<br />
It is a declaration of historic importance.<br />
He has demonstrated that offensive nuclear weapons are<br />
being installed by the Soviet Union in Cuba and that the<br />
Americas are therefore being submitted to a very grave threat.<br />
at close quarters, The President has demonstrated the decei<br />
practised by the Soviet Union, and its determination by threat<br />
of qgression to terrorise nations whose only wish is for<br />
peace. We commend the President's statement. Though<br />
inevitably dramatic, it was in essence defensive. We<br />
appreciate his reference to tihe vital importance of regional<br />
defensive agreements agreements which are authorised by the<br />
United Nations Charter and which are necessary for the common<br />
safety of those living within the region, We welcome the<br />
readiness of the U. S. A. to bring the matter promptly before<br />
the United Nations. Both in his broadcast and in a personal communication<br />
to me this morning, the President has indicated that<br />
he is requesting an urgent meeting of the United Nations<br />
Security Council at which the American Ambassador would<br />
present, on behalf of the United States, a resolution calling<br />
for the withdrawal of missile bases and other offensive<br />
weapons in Cuba under the supervision of United Nations<br />
observers. We have instructed our own Ambassador to the<br />
United Nations to do all in his power to support the passing<br />
of this resolution, We do not under-estimate the gravity of the<br />
situation, a gravity profoundly demonstrated by both the<br />
tone and substance of the President's broadcast, We hope<br />
that his statement and the steps to be taken pursuant t it<br />
will bring home to tho Soviet Union the nature of the<br />
consequences which may flow from its overseas policies,,<br />
Indeed the whole matter will serve to test whether the Soviet<br />
Union's constant advocacy of poace possesses either shoarity<br />
or substance. </p>
