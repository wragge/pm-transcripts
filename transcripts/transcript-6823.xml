PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF PRESS CONFERENCE, PERRY LAKES, PERTH<br />
26 January 1986<br />
0 E Proof only<br />
JOURNALIST: aboriginal land rights and the fact that<br />
the Federal Government will introduce land rights legislation<br />
after the State election. What is your response to that?<br />
PM: The Liberals are held in such contempt in Western Australia,<br />
as they are in tile rest of Australia, because they are engaged<br />
in disinformation, fear and misrepresentation and people<br />
are increasingly saying we don't take any notice of them.<br />
And this is a typical example and justification for the<br />
attitude of the people of Western Australia not trusting<br />
the Liberals. On this particular issue I have made it clear,<br />
and I simply repeat, that we will be talking with Mr Burke<br />
who will be the Premier after the 8th of February. And we<br />
won't be doing anything in any way without full discussion<br />
and consultation and cooperation with Mr Burke. We will<br />
be recognising the rights of Western Australia in this matter.<br />
JOURNALIST: But hasn't he said that he will refuse to-cooperate<br />
PM: He has not said he will refuse to talk with us. We<br />
will talk with him and I have no doubts at all that there<br />
will be a way of going through this which will meet his<br />
requirements, that is that the rights of Western Australia<br />
will be paramount in this issue. They will be. You can<br />
ask 75,000 questions bilt you will not get anything more<br />
than that. We are not engaged in a debate. I have answered<br />
the question. And I have said that when Mr Burke is reelected<br />
as Premier we will have full discussions and consultations<br />
with him as we will with other states. We have made it<br />
quite clear in the Federal Parliament and outside it that<br />
on this matter we would much prefer to see that States handle<br />
this issue in their ways which will meet the problem and<br />
the issue as it exists in each . state. And I am sure that<br />
Mr Burke will do that.<br />
JOURNALIST: On interest rates. There has been a call from<br />
the Pastor alists arnd Graziers Association for you to scrap<br />
the high interest rates policy because of the impact on<br />
on the rural community. What is your response to that? </p>
<p>PM: Let me say these things. When you talk about economic<br />
policy you just can't pick out one element like interest<br />
rates. What this Government has done since we have been<br />
in office is to set the whole range of the elements that<br />
go to make up the whole of macro-economic policy to ensure<br />
that there will be growth, solid growth in the economy.<br />
And particularly rapid growth in employment. Now we have<br />
been successful in doing that. We have got now in Australia<br />
the highest rate of employment growth than it has ever had<br />
in its history. We have got a half a million new jobs that<br />
I promised back in March of ' 83. We have got a half a million<br />
new jobs five months ahead of schedule. We have got that<br />
with containable levels of inflation which we have brought<br />
down from the rate that we inherited. Now we have done<br />
those things because we have got all the elements of economic<br />
policy right. ' You just can't pick out one and say look<br />
we will cut-that, lift that, and say' it is not going to<br />
have effect elsewhere. Now if wedAnot to have protected<br />
the exchange rate in the way that did then what we would<br />
have had was, in the longer term, even higher interest rates.<br />
I will be talking again with the representatives of the<br />
farmers. I am going to talk with the West Australian farmers'<br />
representatives tomorrow. I am looking forward to meeting<br />
with them. Mr Kerin is going to bringing a detailed submissions<br />
to us in Cabinet before long. After further consultation<br />
with the representatives of the farmers to see what sort<br />
of further things we can do to meet the very real problems<br />
that the farmers have got. And those basic problems of<br />
course arise from the fact that the international markets<br />
have been corrupted by the practices of the Europeans.<br />
And now it has been made somewhat worse by the fact that<br />
the Americans are reacting against the Europeans.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Burke said this morning that interest rates<br />
have peaked and that they have to go down after January.<br />
What are your views on that Mr Hawke?<br />
PM: I don't' want to say anything more about interest rates.<br />
I think the facts are there to speak for themselves. I<br />
have made clear that we are going to pursue policies, including<br />
interest rates, which are going to produce the best results.<br />
And as to how interest rates will move, we will see in<br />
the near future what will happen. But I am not here to<br />
contradict Mr Burke on that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Have you given Mr Burke any assurances as far<br />
as interest rates go?<br />
PM: No. I can't give assurances because the Government,<br />
other than in regard to housing interest rates, we have<br />
made it quite clear we are not 4oing to be lifting that<br />
ceiling. May I jus~ oybefore going on to finish the answer<br />
I am sure the people of Western Australia must be fascinated<br />
by the difference between Mr Howard and Mr Hassell. Mr<br />
H-assell says he is not in favour of lifting the interest<br />
rate ceiling on housing. And of course, Mr Howard is in<br />
favour of it. So the people of Western Australia wouldn't<br />
know what to think when it comes to the Liberal Party.<br />
Our position is quite clear. We are not going to lift that<br />
housing rate. And we support what Mr Burke has done to </p>
<p>~~ 1 3.<br />
PM cont: protect tv,. ople here in this State. They obviously<br />
are going to do very very much better in this whole interest<br />
rate area under a (. cmbination of Labor Governments than<br />
by going towards thle Liberals who can't even agree with<br />
one another.<br />
JOURNALIST: Hartley expulsion..<br />
PM: No, I am not intending nor do I think I am required<br />
to be there. They are handling that quite adequately.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, are you personally concerned that<br />
the Burke Government has repudiated federal policy on land<br />
rights. And secondly in response to Mr Burke's request<br />
to an extension of the gold tax enquiry are you sympathetic<br />
to that?<br />
PM: I have said all that needs to be said in regard to<br />
aboriginal land rights in my previous answer. I would simply<br />
add this to it though. When you are talking about the things<br />
that need to be done to help aboriginal people, there are<br />
things that go beyond and have nothing to do with land rights.<br />
And we and Mr Burke will be ensuring that those things<br />
that has made it quite clear that he intends to do<br />
things in the area of housing and health and education.<br />
And those things are important. I have no problems in<br />
living with Mr Burke's position on this matter. Now the<br />
second question was about gold. The position there is that<br />
I understand, that Mr Gudman would be prepared to have an<br />
extension of the time of the hearing which could mean an<br />
extension of the time for the lodging of submissions. And<br />
I know that he has indicated that he would be prepared to<br />
do that. And I have confidence that he will make the<br />
additional time available which will be necessary to ensure<br />
that the West Australian gold industry and the West Australian<br />
Government will have the full opportunity to prepare and<br />
present their material. And I support them having the time<br />
that is necessary to do that. The actual decision as to<br />
the period of extension is properly to be made by Mr Gudman<br />
who is an independent chairman in this matter.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, given Mr Bueke's repeated threats<br />
about going to the High Court on the land rights issue.<br />
Do you think you will get to the High Court with him.<br />
PM: That is so hypothetical and irrelevant that I just<br />
refuse to go to it. I have said before that this matter<br />
will be resolved in a way which will be satisfactory to<br />
the people and the Government of Western Australia.<br />
