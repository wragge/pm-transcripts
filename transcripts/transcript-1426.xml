COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA<br />
SPEECH BY<br />
The Rt. Hon. HAROLD HOLT, M. P.,<br />
ON<br />
MANILA SUMMIT CONFERENCE<br />
Ministerial Statement<br />
[ From. the.." Parliamentary Debates," 27th October 1966]<br />
Mr. HAROLD HOLT ( Higgins-Prime<br />
Minister).-by leave-Mr. Speaker, I report<br />
to the House upon the Manila Summit<br />
Conference from which I have just<br />
returned. Following the Conference I have<br />
made some comment in Manila and also<br />
to representatives of Press, radio and television<br />
who -were awaiting me on my return<br />
last night at Mascot -Airport. All this has.<br />
been widely publicised. Earlier today, I<br />
tabled -in the House of Representatives the<br />
official documents . which emerged from the<br />
Conference. They. are . the Joint Communique<br />
the Declaration of Peace and<br />
Progress in Asia and the Pacific and The<br />
Goals of Freedom I have mentioned these<br />
facts because I believe it is not necessary<br />
for me to go over all of the same ground.<br />
It is proper, however, that there should be<br />
on. the . record of the Parliament an authoritative<br />
account of the Conference and its<br />
results. I attended with my colleagues, the<br />
Minister for External Affairs ( Mr. Hasluck)<br />
and the Minister for Defence ( Mr. Fairhall)<br />
and other members of the Australian official<br />
delegation. This was in response to the<br />
invitation which Australia received from the<br />
14104/ 66 President of the Republic of the Philippines<br />
after his consultations with the President<br />
of the Republic of Korea and the Prime<br />
Ministers of Thailand and the Republic of<br />
Vietnam. This week history was made at Manila.<br />
Sometimes we are too close to great events<br />
to measure their significance. But time, I<br />
suggest, ' will convince us all that the Manila<br />
Conference was an event that helped to<br />
shape contemporary history in our region<br />
of the world. The leaders of seven nations<br />
in the Asian and Pacific region met on<br />
October 24th and 25th to review their wider<br />
purposes in Asia and the Pacific. They<br />
gathered together to chart a programme for<br />
the peaceful and free development of a<br />
great and changing area of the world. This,<br />
remember, is also our part of the world<br />
and we were there in Manila with our<br />
Philippine friends, our Vietnam friends,<br />
our Korean and Thai friends and our<br />
American and New Zealand friends-all<br />
of us looking to the future. The future is<br />
expressed vividly and in a few words in<br />
the Conference document " The Goals of<br />
Freedom </p>
<p>Mr. Bryant--How is the word spelt?<br />
Mr. HAROLD HOLT.-The document<br />
recites that the goals are-<br />
S to be free from aggression, to conquer<br />
hunger, illiteracy and disease, to build a<br />
region of security, order and progress, to seek<br />
reconciliation and peace throughout Asia and the<br />
Pacific. Does the honorable member for Wills, who<br />
sneers at what I have been saying, challenge<br />
any one of those objectives as being a right<br />
and proper objectives for us? To him they<br />
are just cliches. To some people they are<br />
the very finest principles for which men and<br />
women have fought and died through<br />
history. These are not an empty set of<br />
words. Although we were at Manila to assess the<br />
military situation in Vietnam, our greater<br />
task was this vision of the future. The participants<br />
were President-Ferdinand Marcos<br />
of the Philippines, President Park Chung<br />
Hee of the Republic of Korea, Prime<br />
Minister Thanom Kittikachorn of Thailand,<br />
Chairman Thieu and Prime Minister Kao<br />
Ky of the Republic of Vietnam, Prime Minister<br />
Keith Holyoake of New Zealand, President<br />
Lyndon Johnson of the United States<br />
of America, and myself, representing Australia.<br />
We had agreed to make a thorough<br />
review of the Vietnam situation. This was<br />
to include an assessment of the military<br />
position and of continuing resistance to<br />
Communist inspired and directed aggression<br />
and subversion. We wished to look at the<br />
piogresss being made through programmes<br />
of social development and pacification, the<br />
tasks of economic stabilisation and rehibilitation<br />
and the evolution of democratic institutions.<br />
It was part of our purpose to look at practical<br />
means for peaceful settlement of the<br />
conflict in Vietnam. Problems of regional<br />
security, co-operation and development relating<br />
not only to Vietnam but to Asia and<br />
the Pacific generally were also to be examined.<br />
The products of our discussions are<br />
to be found expressed in some detail in the<br />
three documents which I have earlier today<br />
presented to the Parliament. They are the<br />
" Joint Communique the " Declaration of<br />
Peace and Progress in Asia and the Pacific<br />
ahd " The Goals of Freedom<br />
I have described the Summit Conference<br />
as historic. There have been various meetings<br />
in the past of Asian and Pacific Governments, a recent notable instance<br />
being the Asian and Pacific Council<br />
meeting, or A. S. P. A. C. as it has come to be<br />
known, at Seoul in Korea where nine<br />
Governments came together for discussions<br />
on matters of common interest. But until the<br />
Conference at Manila it was unprecedented<br />
for Heads of State and Heads of Government<br />
of seven countries in the Asian and<br />
Pacific region to meet for a collective<br />
purpose. The meeting was historic in that<br />
. sense, but it was historic in even more<br />
important ways. Only great issues can bring<br />
such a meeting about in times when Heads<br />
of Government are so busily engaged. The<br />
issues in this case affect the security and<br />
prospects for a better life of 15 million<br />
people of South Vietnam. They closely<br />
affect the future of the neighbouring<br />
countries of South East Asia. They affect<br />
the basic security of the whole Asian and<br />
Pacific region. Indeed, the world as a whole<br />
is involved in the consequences of the<br />
outcome. These issues produced the meeting.<br />
The documents express our particular<br />
conclusions. I should like to say a word<br />
about the Australian and New Zealand<br />
participation in the meeting. I say with<br />
gratification that each of the Asian Heads<br />
of State or Heads of Government warmly<br />
welcomed me and the Prime Minister of<br />
New Zealand, Mr. Holyoake, into their<br />
counsels. This is a very important factor in<br />
the approach of the Asian ' countries to the<br />
Conference and, even more, to the Vietnam<br />
issue. I mention this and stress it because I<br />
have heard honorable members opposite say<br />
so often that our participation in Vietnam<br />
is alienating Asian opinion against us. Here<br />
is evidence to the contrary. Honorable<br />
members and all Australians will be<br />
interested to note the words of welcome that<br />
President Marcos accorded our parficipation<br />
and that of New Zealand in this Conference.<br />
He said-<br />
The participation in this meeting of the Prime<br />
Ministers of Australia and New Zealand is also a<br />
hopeful augury. These two freedom loving nations<br />
are our neighbours by the accident of geography<br />
but our friends and partners by deliberate'choice.<br />
They are as fully committed as ourselves to the<br />
freedom of Asia and to the attainment of the<br />
secure and just peace indispensable to the economic<br />
development of these combined nations. They have<br />
much to contribute to the attainment of our<br />
common goals.<br />
The opening speech was made by President<br />
Marcos at a public ceremony. It set the </p>
<p>stage for the confidential discussions which<br />
were to follow. In an eloquent and memorable<br />
address he expressed with deep personal<br />
conviction. a ' longing of the Asia' people<br />
for.' ocial and economic stability and for<br />
freddom from insecurity and military<br />
threat. This. theme,' with particular emphasis<br />
on the' problems ' of'Vietnam, became the<br />
focus ' of the . Summit Conference activity.<br />
It is this'theme that finds expression in the<br />
communique . the declaration, and notably<br />
in the statement of. the Goals of Freedom':<br />
The language of official documents, however<br />
warmly and graphically stated, for<br />
understandable reasons can rarely reproduce<br />
the atmosphere of a conference or its full<br />
significance, or the contacts between the<br />
personalities who participate. As one who<br />
not only was present throughout the Conference-<br />
proceedings but also shared, in ' the<br />
intimate discussions . of those Conference<br />
meetings confined to the participating Heads<br />
of State and IHeads of Government,: I regard<br />
this as being'as important a conference<br />
as I:. have. ever ' attended or . believe myself<br />
everlikely to attend. ' I can recall no conference<br />
in' which agreement. was more readily<br />
forihcoming on all niatters'of substance.. I<br />
have read various ieports since the Conference<br />
which' alleged that there were delays<br />
because of wrangling and that there. has been<br />
surprise' that documents of . such weight<br />
could emerge from so limited a period of<br />
discussion. " There was no wrangling in our<br />
talks together., There'. was strength of purpose;<br />
firmness' bf resolution and dedication<br />
to the principles that we expressed in our<br />
declaration and the statement of our Goals<br />
of Freedom As to surprise, it must not<br />
b'e overlooked that our discussions together<br />
neither began nor ended at Manila. The<br />
Governments represented are in almost daily<br />
contact by one means or another, including<br />
diplomatic representation, cabled advices<br />
and the like. We are familiar ' with each<br />
others' : views. The Foreign Ministers had<br />
met informally and had done some useful<br />
ground clearing immediately prior to the<br />
Conference. Later they did their share of<br />
the work of drafting while the Heads of<br />
Government went ' ahead with their own<br />
ideas of what the c6ntents of the documents<br />
should be. It is not to be wondered at that<br />
a good deal of'time was required for these<br />
purposes and the exchanges of thinking until at a final meeting together the Heads of<br />
Government and Foreign Ministers produced<br />
the documents in the forms they ultimately<br />
took. The communique deals principally with<br />
the situation in Vietnam and the problems<br />
of the present and the future there in the<br />
military, social and. economic fields. The<br />
declaration of peace and progress in Asia<br />
and the Pacific sets out the principles on<br />
which we base our hopes for future peace<br />
and progress in the Asian and Pacific region,<br />
for, as the declaration states-<br />
. In the modern world men and nations have no<br />
choice but to learn to live together as brothers.<br />
The " Goals of Freedom" express briefly,<br />
and in language that all should be capable<br />
of understanding, the essence of our declaration.<br />
We said there-<br />
We, the seven nations gathered in Manila,<br />
declare our unity, our resolve and our purpose in<br />
seeking together the goals of freedom in Vietnam<br />
and in the Asian. and Pacific area.<br />
It struck me as quite remarkable that the<br />
representatives of the Republic of Vietnam<br />
should be able, to accept so explicitly and<br />
however regretfully a continuing line of<br />
demarcation between North and South Vietnam<br />
until a decision had been taken democratically<br />
by the people of both areas for<br />
reunification. They. stated that the work<br />
of the constituent Assembly elected to draw<br />
up a constitution for the Republic of Vietnam<br />
was proceeding ahead of schedule.<br />
They gave an undertaking that general elections<br />
to select a representative government<br />
wduld -be held within six months of the<br />
adoption of a , constitution. Believing that<br />
the democratic process must be strengthened<br />
at the local level as well as the national<br />
level, the. Vietnamese leaders announced<br />
that, to this end, village and hamlet elections<br />
would -be held. at the beginning of 1967.<br />
They further announced that they are preparing.<br />
a programme of national reconciliation.<br />
They would, open all doors to<br />
Vietnamese who had been misled or'coerced<br />
into casting their lot with the Vietcong. They<br />
would , be given . amnesty and assisted to<br />
resume -a .: normal existence as to their<br />
employment and community participation.<br />
,. Further, the Vietnamese representatives<br />
made it clear that they were not making<br />
any demands on North Vietnam other than<br />
that the aggression should cease. When it<br />
is considered that the Republic of Vietnam </p>
<p>is still subjected daily to military and terrorist<br />
attack, with continuing infiltration<br />
and eternal subversion, the attitude of the<br />
Vietnamese representatives at the conference<br />
must be regarded as most helpful and<br />
forthcoming: The Vietnamese leaders stated<br />
their intent to train and assign a substantial<br />
portion of their forces to what are<br />
termed " clear and hold actions in order<br />
to provide a shield behind which a new<br />
society can be built. The tactics of search<br />
and destroy" so frequently employed by<br />
the allied forces in the past have been<br />
found by experience to be inadequate for<br />
satisfactory follow up action of reconstruction,<br />
civic action and pacification. This is<br />
because the civilian Vietcong remain in the<br />
area to commit acts' of terrorism and sabotage'<br />
after the military forces have moved<br />
on. Illustrations were given to us of the<br />
construction of'schools in the wake of the<br />
departure. of Communist military forces,<br />
only td be followed by . the physical destruction<br />
of school buildings by individual Vietcong<br />
or small. marauding bands drawn from<br />
the civilian element of the Vietcong. It is<br />
now proposed. thai the clearing operation<br />
should. be more thorough and that a military<br />
component capable of securing the area<br />
should be assigned to enable civic action<br />
and rehabilitation operations to be carried<br />
through with enduring benefit.<br />
The Government of the Republic of Vietnam<br />
wishes to forge what is described in<br />
the communique as a social revolution of<br />
hope and progress. Even as' the conflict<br />
continues;, the effort goes forward to overcome<br />
the tyranny of poverty, disease,<br />
illiteracy arid'social injustice."<br />
Dr. J. F. Cairns.-After 20 years.<br />
Mr. HAROLD HOLT.-The present<br />
Prime Minister of Vietnam has been fighting<br />
for more than half his lifetime to preserve<br />
his ' coiuntry and he deserves something<br />
better than the snees' of ; the honorable<br />
member for ' Yarra. Top priority is to be<br />
given to land reform and tenure provisions.<br />
Agricultural credit is to be expanded; crops<br />
will be' improved and diversified. The<br />
leaders recognise that to build confidence<br />
and co-operation amongst the people they<br />
must be convinced that honesty, efficiency<br />
and social justice form " solid cornerstones<br />
of the Vietnamese Government's programme. The participating governments<br />
applauded these. declarations, recognising<br />
that they open' brighter prospects for the<br />
people of Vietnam. Each undertook to give<br />
its continuing assistance according to its<br />
means, whether in funds, skilled technicians<br />
or equipment. The Vietnamese appreciated<br />
the help being given in non-military fields<br />
by other countries and expressed the hope<br />
that this help will be substantially increased.<br />
The participants further agreed to appeal to<br />
other nations and to international organisations<br />
working for the full and free development<br />
of all nations to give further assistance<br />
to the Republic of Vietnam.<br />
We devoted a good share of our discussions<br />
to peace objectives, reviewing the<br />
many efforts for peace -already undertaken.<br />
What is sought ' is a just and reasonable<br />
solution; but Hanoi has still shown no sign<br />
of taking any step towards peace, either by<br />
action or by entering into-discussions or<br />
negotiations. I know that recently reference<br />
has been made to rumours or to some feeble<br />
peace signs that seem to be ' emerging. I<br />
know of none that can be attributed directly<br />
to Hanoi. We all agreed that the search for<br />
peace must continue. The. Vietnamese<br />
representatives pointed to the suffering they<br />
had experienced from the ravages of war<br />
for more than 20 years. They. declared<br />
themselves to be' second ' to none in their<br />
desire for peace and would welcome any<br />
initiative-that would lead to an end to<br />
hostilities while preserving the independence<br />
of 3outh Vietnam and protecting. the right<br />
of its people to choose their own way of<br />
life. The detailed views of the Government of<br />
the Republic of. Vietnam are set out in the<br />
communique. The other participating<br />
governments endorsed these as essential<br />
elements of peace and agreed that they<br />
would act on this basis in close consultation<br />
together. We pointed out that Allied forces<br />
are in Vietnam because that country is the<br />
object of aggression and in response to the<br />
support requested by its Government. We<br />
agreed that our troops would be withdrawn,<br />
after close consultation, as the other side<br />
withdraws its forces to the north and ceases<br />
infiltration and the level of violence<br />
subsides. Our forces will be withdrawn as<br />
soon as possible, not later than six months<br />
after the conditions mentioned are fulfilled. </p>
<p>My own contribution was designed to<br />
indicate our sense of partnership with our<br />
allies, our awareness of the great common<br />
issues at stake and our determination with<br />
our allies to.. see the issue through. I spoke,<br />
of course, against the. background of the<br />
views which had been offered by early<br />
speakers-President Marcos and Chairman<br />
Thieu at the public session, and Air Vice-<br />
Ma'rshal Ky in private session. Separate<br />
statements on particular aspects of the Vietnam<br />
situation were made by members of<br />
that coritry's delegation. There were<br />
* military reviews by Gejieral Cao Van Vien,<br />
Chief of the General Staff in Vietnam, and<br />
General," Westmoreland,.. Commander,<br />
United States Military Assistance Command,<br />
Vietnam. Others spoke. on the civic action,<br />
revolutionary development and rehabilitation<br />
programmes.<br />
I said at the time I had no need to go<br />
over ground already covered, beyond confirming<br />
the , Australian Government's clear<br />
recognition of the military realities and the<br />
vital issues at stake. I expressed our belief<br />
that Vietnam is, unhappily for its people,<br />
a battleground for not only its own national<br />
security, freedom and integrity, but of even<br />
wider issues-issues of freedom, security<br />
and progress affecting generally the future<br />
and stability of all free peoples in the Asian<br />
and Pacific regions. I spoke of aggression<br />
as an age old enemy of mankind-a challenge<br />
to be taken up and defeated just as<br />
poverty, disease and hunger, other age<br />
old enemies, are to be taken up and<br />
defeated. I expressed the view that it would<br />
be useful to seek to build up world opinion<br />
more widely against the aggression which<br />
now manifests itself through tyranny and<br />
oppression in Vietnam.<br />
There are many countries throughout the<br />
world which seem more indifferent than is<br />
desirable or wise. This is not necessarily<br />
a question of seeking military assistance by<br />
other groups or individual countries. It is<br />
important to secure a wider acceptance of<br />
our narrow but essential objectives in Vietnam,<br />
and also a widening of the economic<br />
effort for the development of Vietnam, both<br />
immediately, so far as this is practicable,<br />
and after the fighting has terminated. I<br />
assured the Conference of my Government's<br />
determination that the Australian<br />
Government would conduct itself as a<br />
dependable ally, continuing its contribution<br />
on both the military. and non-military sides. I mentioned specifically the. aid which . we<br />
have been: giving on the medical, engineering<br />
and education fronts.<br />
, Plainly, while the fighting continues, it is<br />
not practicable for' us. and others to give,<br />
or for Vietnam to receive, more than the<br />
level of assistance of a material kind that<br />
albe abs'orbed.': But if peace could be<br />
brought abolit, we and others would be in<br />
a position to divert more resources to civil<br />
rehabilitation and Vietnam would become<br />
capable -of gaining rhore benefit from the<br />
contributions that could be made.<br />
* Mr. Speker, I have already said that<br />
the, question of peace was given a great<br />
deal of attention in the Conference itself<br />
and, as honorable members will see, it<br />
takes up quite. lengthy passages in the<br />
Conference final documents. It was the view<br />
of all of us that we not only stand ready<br />
but, are, anxious to consider any possible<br />
approaches to . a settlement, and in general<br />
to enter into unconditional discussions at<br />
any time provided that concessions prejudicial<br />
to our basic objectives must not be<br />
made. The peaceful settlement of the<br />
Vietnam conflict must be just and enduring.<br />
A settlement achieved at the cost of<br />
freedom and security for the South<br />
Vietnamese people would be unacceptable.<br />
In the words of President Marcos, the<br />
peace we want is not the peace of death or<br />
the peace of betrayal. We want a purposeful<br />
peace that will guarantee the option for<br />
liberty and progress of the people of South<br />
Vietnam and of all other peoples similarly<br />
situated. This is why we have said in the<br />
communique that we are united in our<br />
determination that the South Vietnamese<br />
people shall not be conquered by aggressive<br />
force and shall enjoy the inherent right to<br />
choose their own way of life and their own<br />
form of government and that we shall<br />
continue our military and all other efforts<br />
as firmly and as long as may be necessary,<br />
in close consultation among ourselves, until<br />
the aggression is ended.<br />
It was the view of all of us that only<br />
when the other side realised that our countries<br />
mean precisely what they say-that<br />
there will be no weakening or flagging, that<br />
all the necessary measures will be takenit<br />
is only then that the other side will conclude<br />
that the aggression will not succeed.<br />
That conclusion on their part is the essential<br />
requirement for. the bringing about of </p>
<p>peace. Whether peace is to be reached<br />
through discussion and negotiations or<br />
whether through a dwindling away of the<br />
conflict, serious efforts will be maintained<br />
through all avenues to bring the other side<br />
to peace. Part of the peace effort is convincing<br />
them, through our teadiness of<br />
purpose and our capacity and readiness to<br />
meet force with force, that aggression will<br />
not succeed.<br />
The benefits I derived were not confined<br />
to the results of. the Conference itself,<br />
highly successful though, in my judgment,<br />
they were. The venue, of the Conference<br />
provided me with m' first visit to the<br />
Philippines. I had not previously met<br />
President Marcos nor had I previously met<br />
President Park Chung Hee of the Republic<br />
of Korea. It will be helpful in my future<br />
contacts and discussions to have built these<br />
new friendships and to have further consolidated<br />
those already made with the other<br />
Chiefs of State and Heads of Government. Let it be understood that we are not<br />
engaged in Vietnam because we want to<br />
roll back the fro'ntiers of Communism, but<br />
because we do not want the frontiers of<br />
Communism to roll back down over South<br />
East, Asia.' But ' always we must see the<br />
conflict in Vietnam in its greater context<br />
as a battleground for human values of<br />
freedom and dignity. All ' Asia looks today<br />
at the future of free choice in South<br />
Vietnfni. If it is preserved-and it will bethe<br />
basic future and stability of all free<br />
peoples-' in the ' Asian and Pacific regions<br />
Wfill, I believe, be guaranteed. And this -is<br />
a prospect equally important to us in<br />
Australia, and indeed to the whole world.<br />
I present the following paper-'<br />
Manila Summit Conference-<br />
Ministerial Statement, 27th October 1966-<br />
and move-<br />
That the House take note of the paper.<br />
