Unser Zoichen ADDRESS BY THE PRIME MINISTER AT CHANCELLOR SCHMIDT'S DINNER,<br />
BONN -20 JUNE 1977<br />
It is a great pleasure to visit the Federal Republic of<br />
Germany and have the opportunity to discuss with you matters<br />
of concern to both our nations.<br />
The relationship between our countries is a strong and<br />
substantial one. We share a commitment to democratic values<br />
and institutions. We have economic and strategic interests<br />
in common, and similar approaches to the major problems<br />
of the day.<br />
We should encourage and sustain the growth in. our relationship<br />
and I am delighted that there has been a striking increase<br />
in contacts between our countries ministers and senior officials<br />
in recent years.<br />
Chancellor, the Federal Republic is one of the world's<br />
great economies, and we have watched with great admiration<br />
your government's conduct of economic policy and we<br />
congratulate you on the results. Years before others yju<br />
learnt from experience the central importance of stable money<br />
in the operation and growth of free enterprise economies.<br />
My government's economic policies are also based on a<br />
recognition of this central fact. Since coming to office<br />
nineteen months ago, we have pegged back sharply the growth<br />
cf our budgetary expenditures; made large cuts in personal<br />
and company taxes; reduced sharply the level of our budget<br />
deficit; brought the growth of the money supply under firm<br />
control; taken steps to restore the health of our balance<br />
cf payments; and acted to contain excessive wage increases.<br />
Australia made progress with these policies in 1976.<br />
Growth was resumed after two years of recession; inflation<br />
was about ten percent compared with sixteen percent in 1975;<br />
there was much less industrial unrest; corporate profits<br />
increased by 30 percent; and business investment began to recover.<br />
./ 2 </p>
<p>Towards the end of 1976 once having brought all the instruments.<br />
of policy to bear on the fight against inflation we devalued<br />
and at the same time altered the settings on the other<br />
instruments of economic policy so as to maintain our basic<br />
policy objectives.<br />
We are carrying these policies further in 1977 and the rate<br />
of inflation has continued to moderate ( 2.3 percent in March<br />
quarter), while business profits and confidence have renamned<br />
strong. Of course, the economic problems inherited from an earlier<br />
period can not be repaired in a few months. But although<br />
there is no lack of voices urging both the Federal Republic<br />
And Australia to depart from present policies, I hope you<br />
will maintain your economic policies as we propose to<br />
maintain ours. We shall maintain them not merely because reducing<br />
inflation-is a basic objective in its own right, but also<br />
because we accept the funda ' mental premise of the OECD<br />
medium-term strategy, tiat without further* rgrs towards<br />
eradication of inflation the sustained growth needed to provide<br />
eiployment opportunities for all those who want to work will<br />
not materialise. i<br />
Our policies have produced a growing confidence in the<br />
Australian economy and are promoting renewed interests in<br />
large scale investment projects. This year investment projects<br />
of about three billion Australian dollars are scheduled to begin,<br />
and other projects involving even great er amounts are well<br />
advanced.<br />
Overseas management and technology must play an important<br />
part in these projects and large quantities of overseas.<br />
capital will be required. Our policy on overseas ownership<br />
and capital inflow takes full account of these needs, and<br />
our export policy with all our mineral products whether<br />
the * v be energy resources or otherwise is to act as a reliable,<br />
responsible and reasonable supplier.<br />
Chancellor, one of themany minerals with which Australia is<br />
richly endowed is uranium. We hold about twenty percent of<br />
the western world's low cost uncommited reserves with good<br />
prospects of finding more. Uranium development and export<br />
involve nat'ional and international considerations which other<br />
commodities do not involve. Accordingly, before making<br />
decisions on uranium we have awaited the findings of.-the special<br />
uranium envitonment inquiry. The second and final report<br />
of that inquiry has just been published. Final decisions<br />
on it will be made soon after my return to Australia, and a<br />
group of officials is now discussing with potential customers<br />
the details of our safeguards policy.<br />
I have spoken at some length about economic issues because I<br />
believe that the task of defeating the twin evils of inflation<br />
and unemployment is one of the major challenges to the democracies.<br />
But this is not the only challenge another major challenge<br />
to the democracies is that of recognising their interdependence<br />
and'that this interdependence is a broadly based one embracing<br />
a wide variety of strategic and economic matter. </p>
<p>We need to be aware of the impact of our decisions not only<br />
on our own country but on others.<br />
If we do not do this, if for instance, we take action<br />
designed exclusively to gain some short term economic gain<br />
the consequences may, in the long term produce restlts<br />
diametrically opposite to our interests.<br />
I believe all democracies are becoming aware that their national<br />
security and prosperity cannot be safeguarded in one region<br />
alone, but must be looked at on a global basis. We need to<br />
foster this awareness and avoid a narrow regionalism which<br />
certainly -does not advance and may harm the common interest.<br />
While Australia's immediate security interests lie especially<br />
in Asia and the Pacific and yours lie in Europe, these<br />
regions and concerns are linked. What happens<br />
in the Pacific and Asia affects the Federal Republic of Germany.<br />
What happens in Europe in Berlin affects us.<br />
And we all have a major interest in the outcome of the<br />
north/ south dialogue. For if the problems of the third world<br />
are not resolved, the consequences will affect the world far<br />
into the future.<br />
Australians recoqnise the vital role Europe has to play in<br />
ensuring the world's security and prosperity, and the<br />
great the indispensable contribution the Federal Republic<br />
has to make to achieving these goals.<br />
Chancellor, I see this visit, as I am sure you do, as an<br />
opportunity to consolidate our relationship a relationship<br />
which is logical and well-based, in that it is founded<br />
on common interest, shared values, and mutual respect.<br />
Chancellor, I would like to propose a toast to the President<br />
and people of the Federal Republic of Germany.<br />
