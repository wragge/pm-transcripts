UiITTETD STATES iJ L COMRULTNI CATIONS STATION IN<br />
AUS TRAL IA<br />
Statements in the House of Representatives on Tuesday,<br />
26th March, 1963 by the Prime Minister, the<br />
Right Hon. Sir Robert Menzies.<br />
IN REPLY TO A QUESTION BY MR. WAPD THE PRIME MINISTER SAID<br />
The honourable member appears not to have kept<br />
himself abreast of statements made both inside this Parliament<br />
and out of it over a long period. It was as long ago as<br />
September, 1960 that the Minister for Defence told the House<br />
that discussions had begun in an informal way with the U. S. A.<br />
in relation to a naval radio communications station in<br />
Australia not a military base. There has been at no time<br />
any proposal for a military base and there is none now.<br />
My colleague told the House about the proposal at the very<br />
beginning and, strangely enough, no comment at all emerged<br />
from the Opposition. Later, in January 1961, my colleague<br />
made a further statement in which he announced that the<br />
results of the earlier studies pursued in relation to this<br />
subject had proved satisfactory from the technical viewpoint<br />
of the UoS. Navy and that further discussions would take<br />
place Mr. J. R. Fraser Is this a Dorothy Dix-er?<br />
SIR ROBERT MENZIES: Obviously. I know the honourable member<br />
for East Sydney so well that I was sure it was bound to come.<br />
On 17th May, 1962, I made a lengthy statement in this House<br />
about the same matter, I pointed out a number of things which<br />
apparently have conveniently been forgotten by many people.<br />
I shall not read all the stateent because it is in " Hansard''<br />
but I said then, amongst other things, that the purpose of the<br />
station was to provide radio communications for U S. and allied<br />
ships over a wide area of the Indian Ocean and the Western<br />
Pacific, Mr. Cairns Does that include submarines?<br />
SIR ROBERT MENZIES s Of course it does, Naval forces happen<br />
to include submarines, Then I pointed out the area of land<br />
to be affected by the project. I said that it would be about<br />
28 square miles. I also pointed out that this was to be leased<br />
to the American authorities, the Commonwealth Government<br />
acquiring the land and being the landlord, if I may put it in<br />
that way, and therefore retaining its own sovereignty.<br />
I said, at the same time, that the maximum<br />
practicable use would be made of Australian contractors, labour<br />
and materials, It is a pity that one should have to repeat<br />
the statement now, but I went on to say that arrangements<br />
would be made for consultation between the two Governments on<br />
matters relating to the station and its use. I said that the<br />
facilities of the station would be available to the Australian<br />
forces. Finally, I pointed out and this again is sometimes<br />
forgotten that the establishment of the station was within<br />
the spirit of co-operation envisaged in the ANZUS Treaty,<br />
under which the parties agreed to co-ordinate their efforts<br />
for collective defence for the preservation of peace and<br />
security. o0@ 0 ,/ 2 </p>
<p>On 6th Mirch of this year my colle:' gu,. the Minister<br />
for Dofenco, made a furtheir quite elaborate scTatei, ento<br />
I shall not'read it all, but after pointing out a number<br />
of the features of this communications station, he said<br />
" Following consultation with the Western<br />
Australian Government, the land required for the<br />
project will be acquired by the Commonwealth<br />
Government,"<br />
He set out the area and said once more that sovereignty would<br />
remain with Australia, He then said<br />
" o.. o.. the technical facilities of ttie station will<br />
be available to the Australian Armed Forces, This<br />
will contribute significantly to Australia's defence<br />
capability, particularly in the light of the Government's<br />
recent decision to establish an R. A. N.<br />
submarine service,"<br />
He added " oo o... the establishment of this station will provide<br />
improved communications for allied surface ships<br />
and submarines over a wide area of the Indian<br />
Ocean and the Western Paci. fic, and will make a<br />
highly significant contribution to general allied<br />
military capability in the areao"<br />
Then for good measure, two, days later he made a further<br />
statement to a similar effoct,<br />
I have mentioned these matters because there has been<br />
a disposition in some qunrters to say that the House has not<br />
been told about themo " ihe House has boon toldo It has been<br />
told all that was available to be toldo A num. ber of the<br />
details of the agreement are as yet unconcluded, They are<br />
not matters of mnassivo importance, There are certain details<br />
of the transaction which are still under discussion, In<br />
fact, only this morning my colleague, the Attorney-General,<br />
has been debating two or t-rcee outstanding points, Whon<br />
these details have been worked out and this matter, which<br />
is most important from the point of view of the United<br />
States of America, the Allied point of view and our own<br />
point of view, can be put in han! d, we propose so that<br />
there may be no doubt outside about the validity of what<br />
we are doing, to annexe the agreement in its full and final<br />
terms to a bill and to invite the Parliament to ratify it.<br />
That bill wi. ll be introduced as soon as possible, I do not<br />
mean within the next day or two,<br />
Mr, Calwell Within a couple of months?<br />
SIR ROBERT MENZIES: I should hope it would be before then,<br />
I shall be very disappointed if the bill cannot be introduced<br />
within the next two or three weeks. That will give every<br />
member of the House an opportunity to re-read the statements<br />
already made and to arm himself with various arguments about<br />
the matter. 3000 00/ 3 </p>

IN REPLY TO A QUESTION BY r NhH! RT. L AM, THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
SAID Certainly Australia. This is not something that<br />
will displace the ANZUS Pact. It is, on the contrary,<br />
something that rather tends to grow out of it, and when<br />
the agreement is presented to the Parliament<br />
Mr. Haylen Ohl<br />
SIR ROBERT MENZIES: I know that honourable members opposite<br />
have never quite cared for the ANZUS Pact. We on this side<br />
and the Australian people care for it. Uhen the agreement<br />
is presented to the Parliament, honourable members will find<br />
that it refers back specifically to the ANZUS greement and<br />
derives from that a very fine reason for stepping forward<br />
into this act which will give to the United States of America<br />
our allies for all those purposes the right to establish<br />
a communications centre. Honourable members opposite hte<br />
been so beguiling themselves with ideas of a radio station<br />
surrounded by nuclear weapons, and a naval base in the<br />
vicinity, that they have simply forgotten to read what has<br />
been said about the proposed station oi to understand what<br />
the real nature of the proposal is. </p>
