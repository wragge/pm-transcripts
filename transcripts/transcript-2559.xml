EMBORGO; 6PM. SUNDAY 16 APRIL, 1,72.<br />
NATIONAL HEART WEEK<br />
NATIONAL T. V. NETWORK<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, the 7t Hon. William McMahon, CH, MP.<br />
16 April, 1972.<br />
This is the second occasion I have been given the<br />
privilege of opening up National Heart Week. The Foundation has<br />
suggested to me that I emphasise as strongly as I can, the ways of<br />
minimising the risk of heart disease. Research over the years has<br />
clearly indicated the basic causes of heart attack, and I am informed<br />
that if you take four precautions, you can reduce the risk considerably.<br />
The precautions you can take are these:-<br />
Keep Fit<br />
Keep your weight down<br />
Give up smoking and<br />
Have a regular medical check<br />
Now the Heart Foundation believes that these four remedies<br />
are the basis of a long and healthy life and will undoubtedly help<br />
us avoid some of the most prevalent of heart diseases.<br />
Their view is, I think, pretty well accepted now. To drive<br />
home the risks taken, the Foundation has asked me to mention these<br />
points to you:-The average middleaged Australian has one chance in<br />
twenty of getting coronary heart disease within five years.<br />
If you are unfit, overweight and a heavy smoker, then you<br />
have one chance in five.<br />
But if you do as the Foundation recommends, the risk is<br />
reduced to one in seventy-five.<br />
Now these are telling figures and I want you to think<br />
about them. In fact heart disease kills more of us than all other<br />
diseases put together. This is why the Foundation has drawn your<br />
attention to preventive action of a simple kind. And we want you<br />
to do all you can to lower the risk of heart disease that affects<br />
so many people. As the Heart Foundation puts it, " Give your heart<br />
every chance". And I emphasise, give yourself every chance of a<br />
happy successful and interesting life. </p>
