    <content><![CDATA[<p>Community Cabinet participant: We're here to meet Kevin Rudd and to hear what he has at his Cabinet meeting and what he has to say...</p>
<p>Community Cabinet participant: I don't know, it's a pretty good opportunity, I suppose, to meet the cabinet so... I'm a politics student so, yeah...</p>
<p>Community Cabinet participant: I think that it's really important that the government does come to the people, I mean we're the people that they're looking after and if they become more than just a public face, they become a person and they see that we're people, with real problems and real issues that we want them to listen to...</p>
<p>Community Cabinet participant: I am a local resident and I also represent the Partners of Veterans Association in Western Australia...</p>
<p>Community Cabinet participant: Interest, just to see what he has got to say in person and, yes, just nice to see somebody talking in the flesh, rather than on the news and what's going on there so just, yeah...</p>
<p>Community Cabinet participant:Well, look, I'm an elderly person, grey beard and everything, so I'm going to see the minister for the aging not the aged, aging...</p>
<p>Community Cabinet participant: I'm going to be talking about the employment and training of aboriginal kids, youth...</p>
<p>Principal of Ballajura Community College, Dr Steffan Silcox: ... One relates to mental health and problems of trauma, placing some of the students that are refugees, issues relating to child abuse and how we can address some of those issues as a school...</p>
<p>Community Cabinet participant: The biggest challenge is the global financial crisis and looking after Australian jobs at this very difficult time and that's, I think, the major focus of the federal government...</p>
<p>Community Cabinet participant: I think it's a good sign of democracy because WA usually gets missed-out so it is a good thing that we are actually being acknowledged.</p>
