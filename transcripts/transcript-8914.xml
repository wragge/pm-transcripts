STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON. P. J. KEATING, MP<br />
DEATH OF SIR EDWARD DUNLOP<br />
It is with great regret that I note the death of Sir Edward Dunlop, AC, CMG, OBE, an<br />
outstanding Australian.<br />
Sir Edward typified many of the qualities which Australians prize. He was<br />
courageous, determined, humble and, above all, ever generous in helping those who<br />
needed help.<br />
H-is " War Diaries" proved an outstanding success on being published, but his stature in<br />
the community stemnmed not from his words but from his deeds.<br />
Renowned for his efforts to help his fellow Australians in time of war, Sir Edward will<br />
also be remembered for his work for the survivors of war and their families, and for his<br />
medical contributions to nations across Asia, most notably Sri Lanka, Malaysia and<br />
especially Thailand.<br />
Sir Edward was admired, even beloved, of many. To have gathered as many friends as<br />
Sir Edward did in his life is a tribute beyond any that I can offer.<br />
I extend, on behalf of a nation grateffil for his work and his life, my condolences and<br />
sympathy to his family.<br />
