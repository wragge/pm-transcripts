Separate talks were held in the Federal Secretariat<br />

officials of these . two institutions and members<br />
of the Australian delegation.<br />
All discussions took place in a friendly atmosphere<br />
and in a spirit of mutual understanding<br />
and respect. Views were exchanged on wideranging<br />
current international issues and on the<br />
possibilities for promoting diversified forms of<br />
co-operation between the two countries.<br />
The two sides paid particular attention to the<br />
expansion of mutual trade. It was noted that the<br />
level of economic relations lags behind the<br />
actual possibilities. They expressed their belief<br />
that there exist favourable conditions for the<br />
further development of economic co-operation<br />
in various fields and agreed that it was necess-</p>
<p>ary and in the mutual interest to make joint<br />
efforts to enhance trade and economic cooperation<br />
in both directions.<br />
The Australian side would welcome a greater<br />
engagement of Yugoslav commercial interests<br />
in the Australian market and to this end recommended<br />
to the Yugoslav side the intensified<br />
use of the market assistance facility of the Australian<br />
Department of Overseas Trade.<br />
The Australian side agreed to give careful consideration<br />
to the Yugoslav wish to conclude an<br />
agreement on the elimination of double taxation.<br />
The two sides welcomed the conclusion of an air<br />
service agreement between Australia and<br />
Yugoslavia and the early introduction of regular<br />
scheduled services between Australia and<br />
Yugoslavia by Qantas and JAT.<br />
The two sides consider that the Yugoslavs living<br />
and working in Australia represent a special link<br />
between Yugoslavia and Australia. The<br />
Yugoslav side expressed its appreciation for the<br />
efforts which Australia has made to promote the<br />
welfare of Yugoslavs in Australia. The Australian<br />
side reiterated its concern that they<br />
should enjoy the same conditions as other<br />
members of the Australian community. Both<br />
sides believed that there could be value in the<br />
conclusion of a Social Welfare Agreement between<br />
Australia and Yugoslavia.<br />
The Yugoslav side notes with appreciation the<br />
efforts which the Australian Government had<br />
made to prevent terrorist activity by extremist<br />
emigr groups aimed against Yugoslavia<br />
and designed to obstruct the development of<br />
friendly relations between the two countries.<br />
The Australian side confirmed its determinaton<br />
to prevent such activity.<br />
The two sides also examined possibilities to<br />
intensify cultural co-operation and agreed to<br />
conclude a Cultural Agreement at an early date.<br />
Prime Minister Whitlam set forth his assessment<br />
of the situation in the Pacific and Asian<br />
region. Prime Minister Bijedic acquainted Prime<br />
Minister Whitlam with his view of the situation<br />
in Europe, particularly in the area of the Mediterranean.<br />
The Yugoslav side informed the<br />
Australian side in detail of the activities and the<br />
forthcoming program of the non-aligned countries.<br />
The two sides noted that the strengthening<br />
of the role of the non-aligned countries,<br />
which had become an important political and material factor in the world, contribul: es considerably<br />
to the democratisation and stabilisation<br />
of international relations and to the settlement<br />
of outstanding international issues;.<br />
The Yugoslav side took note with interest and<br />
appreciation of the desire of Australia to take<br />
part as observer or guest at the next summit<br />
meeting of the non-aligned countries and welcomed<br />
its positive attitude towards the<br />
increased role of the non-aligned policy as well<br />
as its interest in co-operation with tile nonaligned<br />
countries.<br />
In regard to the situation in the Middle East, the<br />
two sides pointed out the need to make intensive<br />
efforts to find a just and durable solution on<br />
the basis of the relevant resolutions of the<br />
United Nations.<br />
The two Prime Ministers consider that the<br />
implementation of the Resolutions of the United<br />
Nations constitutes the appropriate approach for<br />
a just and lasting solution to the Cyprus crisis<br />
and expressed their willingness to make efforts<br />
to this end.<br />
With respect to the situation in Viet-Nam, the<br />
two sides agreed that it was necessary to secure<br />
the full and strict implementation of the Paris<br />
Agreements. In welcoming the progress made by the peoples<br />
of Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique and Angola on<br />
their road to liberation, and the adoption by the<br />
United Nations General Assembly of the<br />
Resolution on decolonisation as the expression<br />
of the successful struggle against colonialism,<br />
the two sides emphatically condemned the policy<br />
of racial discrimination and apartheid and<br />
expressed their belief that the peoples subjected<br />
to racial oppression would soon attain freedom.<br />
The two Prime Ministers emphasised the particular<br />
importance of the United Nations<br />
organisation, pointing to the need for further<br />
strengthening its role and efficacy in dealing<br />
with fundamental international political and<br />
economic problems, as well as in the development<br />
of all-round international co-operation<br />
and safeguarding peace in the world. The<br />
importance and usefulness of co-operation between<br />
representatives of Yugoslavia and<br />
Australia in the United Nations and in other international<br />
organisations were also<br />
emphasised. During the conversations, views were exchanged<br />
on the current economic situation in the<br />
world. The two sides stressed the need to find </p>
<p>more durable solutions to economic problems<br />
through broad international co-operation which<br />
would take into account the interdependence of<br />
all states while respecting their sovereign<br />
interests. The two sides accentuated the importance<br />
of the decisions of the Sixth Special Session<br />
of the General Assembly of the United<br />
Nations and the need for their early implementation.<br />
They concurred in the belief that disruptions<br />
in the world economy could be overcome<br />
only through substantial changes in existing international<br />
economic relations and the establishment<br />
of a new economic order based on<br />
equality between nations. Only thus would it be<br />
possible to improve substantially the position of<br />
the developing countries, which constitute a<br />
key issue in international economic relations.<br />
The two sides stressed that the problems of raw<br />
materials and economic development could be<br />
resolved through the introduction of more just<br />
terms of trade in the exchange of primary and<br />
industrial products, while at the same time<br />
recognising the right of all nations to freely<br />
manage their own natural resources. The two<br />
sides voiced the need to undertake concrete<br />
steps in the directon of halting the arms race<br />
and bringing about general and complete disarmament,<br />
in particular nuclear disarmament.<br />
The two Prime Ministers expressed their readiness<br />
to support all efforts aimed at consolidating<br />
international co-operation based on the principles<br />
of equality, non-interference and respect<br />
for the independence and sovereignty of all<br />
states. They evaluated positively the results so<br />
far achieved in the promotion of detente, as a<br />
contribution to peace. They stressed that, in<br />
order to become a universal and lasting process,<br />
detente must spread to all areas of the world, so<br />
facilitating the resolution of outstanding international<br />
issues and acute crises with the participation<br />
of the international community as a<br />
whole. The Prime Minister expressed his deep appreciation<br />
for the warm cordiality and generous hospitality<br />
extended to him and his party by Mr<br />
Bijedic and the Yugoslav Government. </p>
