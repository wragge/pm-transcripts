PRIME MINISTER<br />
CONFEDERATION OF ASIAN CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE AND INDUSTRYMELBOURNE,<br />
12 NOVEMBER 19814<br />
I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO MEET WITH YOU<br />
TODAY, TO WELCOME OUR OVERSEAS VISITORS, AND TO ENDORSE<br />
THE THEME OF YOUR CONFERENCE ASIAN PACIFIC<br />
COOPERATION TOWARDS 2000.<br />
WHEN ADDRESSING THE AUSTRALIAN-THAI CHAMBER OF COMMERCE<br />
TWELVE MONTHS AGO, I INDICATED THAT THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
GOVERNMENT'S REGIONAL COMMITMENT IS TO AN INVOLVED ROLE ONE:<br />
THAT WOULD SEE AUSTRALIA BOTH CONTRIBUTING TO AND BENEFITING<br />
FROM THE DYNAMISM OF THE REGIONAL SITUATION.<br />
IT IS WIDELY ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE CENTRE OF GRAVITY OF<br />
GLOBAL ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IS SHIFTING TOWARDS THE PACIFIC<br />
AND THAT THE WESTERNPACIFIC IS NOW THE WORLD'S MOST-DYNAMIC<br />
AREA OF GROWTH, A QUARTER OF A CENTURY AGO THE SOUTHEAST AND<br />
NORTHEAST ASIAN ECONOMIES ACCOUNTED FOR ONLY 8 PER CENT OF<br />
WORLD ECONOMIC ACTIVITY ONLY ONE SIXTH OF WESTERN EUROPE<br />
AND ONE EIGHTS OF NORTH AMERICA. ON PRESENT TRENDS, BY THE<br />
TURN OF THE CENTURY THE'SOUTHEAST AND NORTHEAST ASIAN ECONOMIES<br />
TOGETHER WILL BE LARGER THAN WESTERN EUROPE AND AS LARGE AS<br />
NORTH AMERICA. </p>
<p>UNDERLYING THIS DYNAMISM IS THE HEIGHTENED INTERDEPENDENCE<br />
OF THE COUNTRIES OF THE REGION. THIS IS NOWHERE MORE MANIFEST,<br />
' THAN IN THE AREA OF TRADE. SOME 40 PER CENT OF THE WIESTERN<br />
PACIFIC REGION'S TRADE IS INTRA-REGIONAL. THE INTRA-REGIONAL<br />
COMPONENT GREW BY AROUND 24i PER CENT A YEAR BETWEEN 1971<br />
AND 1981.<br />
LET THERE BE NO MISTAKE. AUSTRALIA DOES NOT EXPECT TO<br />
REAP THE BENEFITS OF THE REGION'S GROWTH SIMPLY THROUGH<br />
THE GOOD FORTUNE OF BEING LOCATED WITHIN IT.<br />
I BELIEVE WE MUST ALL WORK HARD AT SECURING THE ADVANTAGES<br />
INHERENT IN OUR LOCATION, IN OUR HUMAN AND MATERIAL RESOURCE<br />
BASE, AND IN THE FLEXIBILITY OF OUR ECONOMIC SYSTEMS.<br />
IN SOME RESPECTS THE ODDS ARE STACKED AGAINST US.<br />
THE TRAD . ING INTERESTS OF THE COUNTRIES OF OUR REGION HAVE BEEN<br />
SEVERELY DISADVANTAGED BY THE DOMINANCE OF THE ESTABLISHED<br />
INDUSTRIAL NATIONS IN THE INTERNATIONAL TRADING SYSTEM. THE<br />
COUNTRIES OF THIS REGION HAVE BEEN DISADVANTAGED BY THE<br />
NSPECIAL" TREATMENT OF TRADE IN AGRICULTURAL PROI) UCTS) WHICH<br />
SEES THEM EXCLUDED FROM THE NORMAL INTERNATIONAL TRADING RULESj<br />
BY BARRIERS AGAINST THE LABOUR-INTENSIVE EXPORTS OF THE NEWLY<br />
INDUSTRIALISING COUNTRIES; AND BY TARIFF ESCALATION AGAINST<br />
PROCESSED RAW MATERIALS. </p>
<p>THE REGIONAL TRADE INITIATIVE I SUGGESTED IN BANGKOK<br />
LAST NOVEMBER AIMED To REDRESS THIS SITUATION. IT SOUGHT<br />
TO DO SO:<br />
BY PRESENTING A FORUM FOR AN APPRECIATION OF THE<br />
APPREHENSIONS AND ASPIRATIONS OF REGIONAL COUNTRIES<br />
CONCERNING MULTILATERAL TRADE ISSUESi<br />
BY EXPLORING WAYS OF TAKING FORWARD THE INTERESTS OF<br />
COUNTRIES OF THE REGION'<br />
-AND, TO THJS END, BY CONSIDERING THE SCOPE FOR<br />
DEVELOPING MUTUALLY SUPPORTIVE POSITIONS.<br />
THIS PROCESS OF CONSULTATION BEGAN WITH THE MEETING OF<br />
SENIOR REGIONAL TRADE OFFICIALS AT DENPASAR EARLIER THIS YEAR.,<br />
IT WAS CARRIED FORWARD, IN A VERY POSITIVE WAY, AT THE<br />
SYDNEY MEETING OF SENIOR REGIONAL TRADE OFFICIALS<br />
EARLIER. THIS MONTH.<br />
THE EMPHASIS THROUGHOUT THIS EXERCISE HAS BEEN ON A<br />
STEADY, MEASURED APPROACH TOWARDS INCREASED UNDERSTANDING OF<br />
THE SHARED INTERESTS OF THE COUNTRIES OF THE REGION.<br />
ALREADY THE BENEFITS OF THIS APPROACH HAVE BEEN APPARENT,<br />
NOT ONLY THROUGH COUNTRIES OF THE REGION REGISTERING THEIR<br />
VIEWS EARLIER THIS YEAR AT THE LONDON ECONOMIC SUMMIT, BUT<br />
ALSO THROUGH THE SERIOUSNESS OF PURPOSE WITH WHICH THEY HAVE<br />
RECENTLY BEEN EXAMINING THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUGGESTIONS<br />
THAT THERE BE A NEW MULTILATERAL TRADE NEGOTIATIONS ROUND. </p>
<p>THE REALITY THAT WE ALL HAVE TO FACE IS THAT THE RECENT<br />
' PROLIFERATION OF TRADE BARRIERS.-OF MANAGED TRADE, AND<br />
OF BILATERAL ARRANGEMENTS IS FURTHER UNDERMINING THE<br />
ALREADY ENFEEBLED MOST-FAVOURED NATION PRINCIPLEiHIS<br />
IS THE PRINCIPLE ON WHICH MULTILATERAL COOPERATION<br />
RESTS, AND ON WHICH SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED TRADING<br />
NATIONS SUCH AS OUR OWN ARE SO DEPENDENTLATELY<br />
ACCESS TO THE MARKETS OF EUROPE AND NORTH AMERICA<br />
HAS BEEN RESTRICTED OR BECOME MORE UNCERTAIN ] IN A NUMBER<br />
OF SECTORS OF VITAL IMPORTANCE TO COUNTRIES O1: OUR<br />
REGION IN AGRICULTURE, TEXTILES, CLOTHING, STEEL,<br />
MOTOR VEHICLES AND CONSUMER ELECTRONICS*<br />
OUR EFFORTS WITHIN THE REGION MUST BE DIRECTED TOWARDS<br />
ACTION IN THE INTERNATIONAL ARENA WHICH WOULD:.<br />
ENCOURAGE THE PROCESS OF ROLLBACK OF PROTECTIONIST<br />
MEASURESJ. CHECK THE GRPWTH OF DISCRIMINATORY TRADE PRACTICES)<br />
REVITALISE THE GATT WORK PROGRAMME, PROGRESS IN<br />
WHICH HAS BEEN EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTINGJ AND </p>
<p>PROMOTE GREATER ACCEPTANCE OF RATIONAL TRADE<br />
POLICIES AS AN INTEGRAL PART OF SOUND DOMESTIC<br />
ECONOM IC MANAGEMENT.<br />
REGIONAL CO-OPERATION ALSO HAS ANOTHER, CLOSELY RELATED,<br />
ASPECT THE FULL EXPLOITATION AND PROMOTION OF THE TRADE<br />
AND COMMERCIAL OPPORTUNITIES PRESENTED WITHIN THE REGION<br />
ITSELF.<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT IS DETERMINED TO REVITALISE OUR<br />
TRADE PERFORMANCE AND TO CONTINUE TO DIVERSIFY THE PRODUCT<br />
COMPOSITION OF OUR EXPORTS.<br />
WE HAVE DEVELOPED SPECIFIC COUNTRY ACTION PLANS AND HAVE<br />
ALLOCATED CONSIDERABLE RESOURCES FOR THEIR IMPLEMENTATION.<br />
THEY INVOLVE THE DEVELOPMENT OF MARKET ENTRY STRAGEGIES<br />
FOR PIAJORITY PRODUCTS, TAKING ACCOUNT OF* INDIVIDUAL<br />
CHARACTERISTICS OF TRADING PRACTICES OF THE TARGETTED<br />
COUNTRY MARKETS.<br />
THE JAPAN MARKET STRATEGY, FOR EXAMPLE, HAS INVOLVED THE<br />
HIRING OF JAPANESE CONSULTANTS TO HELP IDENTIFY MARKET<br />
OPPORTUNITIES. THIS WAS FOLLOWED BY A SEMINAR PROGRAMME<br />
WITH SELECTED AUSTRALIAN COMPANIES IN WHICH THE RESULTS<br />
OF THE RESEARCH WERE PRESENTED. APPROPRIATE MARKET<br />
PENETRATION STRATEGIES FOR SPECIFIC FIRMS ARE NOW BEING<br />
DEVELOPED. </p>
<p>THE GOVERNMENT HAS ALSO IMPLEMtNTED A CHINA ACTION PLAN.-A<br />
STRATEGY BUILT AROUND EXPLICIT RECOGNITION OF THE<br />
PHENOMENAL IMPORTANCE OF CHINA'S EMERGENCE FOR THE COUNTRIES<br />
OF THIS REGION AND GEARED TO SECURING MAXIMUM AUSTRALIAN<br />
INVOLVEMENT WITH THE OPPORTUNITIES PRESENTED BY SUCCESSFUL<br />
DEVELOPMENT OF CHINA'S MODERNISATION PROGRAM.<br />
CHINA'S MODERNISATI ON PROGRAM IS CHANGING THE FACE OF<br />
CONTEMPORARY CHINA. THE CHANGES INVOLVED ARE FUNDAMENTAL<br />
BOTH FOR CHINA ITSELF AND FOR ALL THOSE WHO DEAL WITH HER.<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT VERY EARLY-ON RECOGNISED THE MOMENTOUS<br />
SIGNIFICANCE OF THOSE CHANGES, WE MOVED QUICKLY TO<br />
PARTICIPATE IN THE OPPORTUNITY THAT WOULD OPEN UP.<br />
ALREADY THE BENEFITS OF THIS FORESIGHT ARE APPARENT.<br />
ONE OF THE KEY ELEMENTS OF THE CHINA ACTION PLAN HAS BEEN TO<br />
PROVIDE.. A GOVERNMENT ' UMBRELLA' TO SUPPORT, FACILITATE AND<br />
ENHANCE BILATERAL TRADE AND INVESTMENT.<br />
THE SUCCESS OF THE EXTENSIVE PERSONAL CONTACTS DEVELOPED<br />
INSIDE CHINA UNDFR THE CHINA ACTION PLAN HAS BEEN<br />
REFLECTED AT THE COMMERCIAL LEVELo WITH THE CONCLUSION OF<br />
MANY SALES AND COMMERCIAL ARRANGEMENTS, AS WELL AS NUMEROUS<br />
CONTINUING NEGOTIATIONS ACROSS A BROAD SPECTRUM OF<br />
AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRY.<br />
THE GOVERNMENT'S MARKET STRATEGY FOR CHINA HAS RECEIVED<br />
STRONG SUPPORT FROM THE AUSTRALIAN BUSINESS COMMUNITY. </p>
<p>A NEW DIMENSION IN OUR COMMERCIAL RELATIONS WITH CHINA<br />
COMMENCED IN FEBRUARY LAST WHEN THE CHINESE PREMIER ZHAO<br />
ZIYANG AND I AGREED DURING MY VISIT TO CHINA.-TO PROMOTE<br />
' CO-OPERATION BETWEEN THE IRON AND STEEL INDUSTRIES OF<br />
OUR TWO COUNTRIES. THAT AGREEMENT PROVIDED THE<br />
SPRINGBOARD FOR A SPECTACULAR INCREASE IN THE LEVEL OF<br />
ACTIVITY BETWEEN AUSTRALIAN COMPANIES AND CHINA ACTIVITY<br />
WHICH HAS ALREADY TRANSLATED INTO SUBSTANTIAL TRADE.<br />
SHIPMENTS UNDER CONTRACT FOR IRON ORE... MANGANESE, STEEL<br />
PRODUCTS AND COAL TO CHINA THIS YEAR ARE EXPECTED TO TOTAL<br />
$ 177 MILLION, AN INCREASE OF ALMOST 50% OVER 1983.<br />
LOOKING AHEAD WE CAN EXPECT EVEN MORE SOLID RESULTrS.<br />
HAMERSLEY IRON AND A CHINESE CORPORATION ARE CURRENTLY<br />
CONDUCTIN*&gt; A FEASIBILITY STUDY FOR A JOINT VENTURE INTO<br />
A NEW IRON ORE MINE IN THE PILBARA. ALL THE INDICATIONS<br />
ARE THAT THE MINE WILL PROCEED,<br />
RE6ENTLY A VERY WIDE RANGE OF LARGE AND SMALL. OPPORTUNITIES<br />
FOR MUTUALLY ADVANTAGEOUS TRADE AND INVESTMENT WERE IDENTIFIED<br />
BY AN AUSTRALIAN TECHNICAL MISSION. SEVERAL OF THESE<br />
OPPORTUNITIES ARE ALREADY THE SUBJECT OF COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATION.<br />
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,<br />
IN AUSTRALIA'S CURRENT EXPORT DRIVE THERE IS ROOM [ FOR BOTH THE<br />
CONTINUED PROMOTION OF EXPORTS OF THOSE PRODUCTS IIN WHICH<br />
AUSTRALIA HAS A TRADITIONAL COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE AND FOR<br />
THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PRODUCTS. </p>
<p>LO12,84 uv: 23 4171471<br />
IN4 A NUMBER OF ESTABLISHED AREAS OF AUSTRALIAN EXPORT<br />
ACTIVITY THE GOVERNMENT HAS TAKEN FIRM ACTION TO DEFEND<br />
AND PROMOTE AUSTRALIAN EXPORTERS' INTEREST-WE HAVE,<br />
FOR EXAMPLE, UNDERTAKEN A SUSTAINED AND INTENSE LOBBYING<br />
EFFORT TO SECURE INCREASED AND RELIABLE MARKETS FOR<br />
AUSTRALIAN BEEF. WE HAVE HAD SOME SUCCESS,<br />
IN OUR VITAL COAL TRADEj AND AGAIN FOLLOWING STRONG<br />
AUSTRALIAN REPRESENTATIONS, THE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT HAS<br />
UNDERTAKEN THAT JAPAN'S TRADE IN COAL WILL BE CONDUCTED<br />
ON A STRICTLY COMMERCIAL BASIS. J'APAN HAS ALSO REAFFIRMED<br />
EARLIER ASSURANCES THAT IT HAS NO INTENTION OF DEALING WITH<br />
TRADE PROBLEMS WITH THE UNITED STATES IN THE CONTEXT OF<br />
THE LARGE BILATERAL TRADE IMBALANCE BETWEEN THEM AT'THE<br />
EXPENSE OF AUSTRALIA. To AUSTRALIAN EXPORTERS THESE<br />
ASSURANCES ARE MOST IMPORTANT. ADHERENCE TO THE LETTER<br />
AND SPIRIT OF THESE ASSURANCES WILL CONTRIBUTE SIGNIFICANTLY<br />
TO THE FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF CLOSE, HARMONIOUS RELATIONS<br />
BETWEEN ' AUSTRALIA AND JAPAN. EQUALLY, FAILURE TO DO SO WOULD<br />
SERIOUSLY JEOPARDISE CONFIDENCE IN THE RELATIONSHIP,<br />
IN TWO OTHER AREAS t4HERE SERIOUS TRADING UNCERTAINTY HAS<br />
ARISEN UNCERTAINTY WHICH FACES OTHER COUNTRIES OF THE:<br />
REGION AS WELL TH+ E AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT HAS ALSO<br />
REGISTERED STRONG CONCERNS: </p>
<p>Nov 12,64 09: 24 41714? i .1<br />
8.<br />
-IHAVE STRESSED WITH SECRETARY OF STATE SHULTZ THE<br />
SERIOUS CONCERN WITH WHICH THE UNITED STATES<br />
POSITION ON TRADE IN STEEL PRODUCTS IS VIEWED BY THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT, WE HAVE UNDERLINED OUR<br />
FUNDAMENTAL REQUIREMENT FOR SECURE AND PREDICTABLE ACCESS<br />
TO THEIR MARKET, ON TERMS WHICH TAKE ACCOUNT OF OUR<br />
REASONABLE MARKET ASPIRATIONS,<br />
-THE STRONGEST REPRESENTATIONS HAVE ALSO BEEN MADE TO THE<br />
COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES SEEKING A<br />
RECONSIDERATION OF ITS PROPOSAL TO EXPORT A VAST AMOUNT OF<br />
SURPLUS BUTTER AT A PRICE WHICH WOULD BREACH AND SERIOUSLY<br />
THREATEN THE GATT INTERNATIONAL D) AIR'Y ARRANGEMENT. I BELIEVE<br />
WE HAVE HAD SOME SUCCESS IN THESE REPRESENTATIONS. WE<br />
ARE ENCOURAGED BY THE COMMUNITY'S RESPONSE IN THE LATEST<br />
ROUND OF NEGOTIATIONS AND WOULD HOPE TO SEE CONCRETE PROGRESS<br />
IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS.<br />
WHILE THESE TRADE POLICY INITIATIVES ARE OF GREAT IMPORTANCE,<br />
THERE IS NO MORk IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTION WHICH GOVERNMENT<br />
CAN MAKE TO EXPORT PROMOTION THAN TO ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN<br />
A STABLE MACRO-ECONOMIC POLICY ENVIRONMENT. IT IS IN PRECISELY<br />
SUCH AN ENVIRONMENT THAT SPECIFIC MEASURES OF SUPPORT,<br />
SHOULD THEY BE CONSIDERED NECESSARY4 ARE MOST LIKELY TO<br />
BE SUCCESSFUL. </p>
<p>My OWN GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN ABLE TO PROVIDE AUSTRALIAN<br />
INDUSTRY WITH STABLE MACRO-ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND WITH<br />
': THREE FUNDAMETAL PRE-CONDITIONS FOR INCREASED<br />
COMPETITIVENESS: LOWER REAL UNIT LABOUR COSTS; FALLING<br />
INTEREST RATES; AND A REALISTIC EXCHANGE RATE.<br />
AND IF I MAY HAVE ONE SLIGHT DEPARTUREFRO11 WHAT IS ESSENTIALLY<br />
WAKING UP<br />
A NON PARTISAN SPEECH, I WANT TO SAY THIS, THAT/ THIS MONDAY<br />
MORNING AND READING THE PRESS I WAS VERY PLEASED TO SEE<br />
IN THIS MORNING'S EDITION OF THE AUSTRALIAN FINANCIAL REVIEW<br />
THE HEADING OF HAWKE'S BRAND OF LABOR"<br />
THE ENDORSEMENT OF OUR POLICIES BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE BUSINESS<br />
COUNCIL OF AUSTRALIA, MR ROBERT WHITE, AND HIS EXPRESSION OF<br />
HOPE THAT THIS GOVERNMENT WOULD DELIVER MORE OF THE SAME<br />
IN ITS SECOND TERM OF OFFICE. I DON'T WANT TO READ IN DETAIL<br />
FROM THAT RINGING ENDORSEMENT OF THESE POLICIES, I SIMPLY WANT<br />
TO SAY THIS, THAT IN THE POLICY SPEECH THAT WILL BE DELIVERED<br />
TOMMORROW IN SYDNEY, I CAN ASSURE THE AUSTRALIAN BUSINESS<br />
COMMUNITY, THAT THEY WILL BE GETTING MORE OF THE SAME, THERE WILL<br />
NOT BE ANY RASH!'\ HANDING OUT OF A WHOLE RANGE OF PROMISES. SHE:<br />
WILL BE AN ADEERENCE TO STEADY AS YOU GO WHICH HAS ACHIEVED<br />
THE RAPID GROWTH IN OUR AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY.<br />
FOR ITS PART, INDUSTRY MUST STRIVE TO CAPTURE THE<br />
OPPORTUNITIES OF GLOBAL MARKETS AND RESIST THE<br />
TEMPTATION TO SHIELD BEHIND THE PROTECTIVE BARRIERS OF A<br />
SMALL DOMESTIC MARKET-IT WILL HAVE TO iiELY ON ITS<br />
COMPETITIVE STRENGTH AND PRODUCTIVE CAPABILITIES-</p>
<p>THIS HAS BEEN THE UNDERLYING RATIONALE THAT HAS GUIDED<br />
INDUSTRY POLICY IN AUSTRALIA UNDER THE LABOR 6OVERNMENT.<br />
FOR EXAMPLE, WITH OUR MOTOR VEHICLE AND STEEL PLANS,<br />
INDUSTRIES HAVE BEEN GIVEN A PERIOD OF TIME TO MOVE<br />
TOWARDS' A MORE RATIONAL, COMPETITIVE STRUCTUJRE, BETTER<br />
ABLE TO OFFER LONG TERM JOB SECURITY FOR EMPLOYEES AND<br />
TO CONTRIBUTE TOWARDS AUSTRALIA' S ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTON<br />
TOP OF THIS, HOWEVER, IT NEEDS TO BE FULLY RECOGNISED<br />
THAT IT IS ONLY IF AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRY IS ABLE FULLY<br />
TO CAPTURE THE BENEFITS OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE THAT<br />
AUSTRALIA WILL BE ABLE TO SUSTAIN SATISFACTORY GROWTH<br />
IN OUTPUT, INCOMES AND EMPLOYMENT, THERE ARE OF COURSE MANY<br />
IN THIS AUDIENCE WHO COME FROM COUNTRIES THAT HAVE BEEN<br />
SINGULARLY SUCCESSFUL IN APPLYING THIS LESSON.<br />
THE CRITICAL LINKAGES BETWEEN TRADE POLICY AND GROWTH,<br />
TOGETHER WITH THE STEADY EROSION OF MULTILATERAL<br />
DISCIPLINES IN INTERNATIONAL TRADE LEAD TO AN IMPORTANT<br />
CONCLUSION. TRADE LIBERALISATION POLICIES SHOULD NOW<br />
BE SE N AS MUCH IN THE CONTEXT OF THE EFFECTIVE OPERATION<br />
OF THE DOMESTIC ECONOMY AS IN THE MORE TRADITIONAL CONTEXT<br />
OF THE EXCHANGE OF " CONCESSIONS" BETWEEN TRADING PARTNERS<br />
IN AN INTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATING FRAMEWORK.<br />
WHATEVER STEPS WE TAKE TO REACTIVATE THE PROCESS OF<br />
MULTILATERAL CO-OPERATION AND CLEARLY THI. S WILL BE OF<br />
THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE WE SHOULD NOT LOSE SIGHT OF OUR<br />
OWN ENLIGHTENED SELF-INTEREST IN PURSUING RATIONAL TRADE<br />
POLICIES AS AN INTEGRAL PART OF SOUND DOMESTIC ECONOMIC<br />
MANAGEMENT. </p>
<p>i-I a<br />
AN IMPORTANT COMPLEMENT TO RATEONAL TRADE APPROACHES<br />
WILL BE A DOMESTIC FINANCIAL STRUCTURE WHICH* ALSO<br />
ENCOURAGES ADAPTATION AND FLEX'IBILITY.<br />
IN A REGIONAL CONTEXT, TRADE AND FINANCE ARE TWO CENTRAL<br />
ELEMENTS AND MUTUALLY SUPPORTIVE STRANDS OF ECONOMIC<br />
INTERDEPENDENCETHE AUSTRALIAN LABOR GOVERNMENT t -INITIATIVES TO PROMOTE<br />
MANAGED CHANGE IN KEY SEGMENTS OF THE ECONOMY HAVE A<br />
PARTICULAR FOCUS IN OUR APPROACH TO THE DEREGULATION OF<br />
FINANCIAL MARKETS*<br />
AN EFFICIENT FINANCIAL SECTOR WILL DIRECT RESOURCES AT<br />
LEAST COST TO TH. E MOST PRODUCTIVE AREAS OF THE ECONOMY<br />
AND THUS ASSIST IN RAISING WEALTH, LIVING STANDARDS AND<br />
AGGREGATE DEMAND*<br />
THE DECISION TO FLOAT THE AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR AND REMOVE<br />
MOST EXCHANGE CONTROLS IN DECEMBER 1983 MEANS THAT<br />
MARKET FORCES NOW DETERMINE OUR EXC HANGE RATE WITH ALL<br />
CURRENCIES-STEPS HAVE ALSO BEEN TAKEN TO INCREASE THE<br />
NUMBER OF AUTHORISED DEALERS IN FOREIGN. EXCHANGE AND TO<br />
DEEPEN THE OFFICIAL FORWARD MARKET-FrHE EFFECT OF THESE<br />
MEASURES TAKEN TOGETHER IS THAT TRADE AND FINANCE FLOWS<br />
ARE NO LONGER SUBJECT TO THE DISTORTIONS WHICH MIGHT BE<br />
INTRODUCED BY AN ATTEMPT OF THE AUTHORITIES TO DETERMINE<br />
THIS MOST CRITICAL SET OF PRICES BY FIAT-</p>
<p>12<br />
IN ADDITION, THE TREASURER HAS INVITED APPLICATIONS FROM<br />
BOTH DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN INTERESTS WISHING TO OPERATE<br />
rBANKS IN AUSTRALIA-THIS WILL ENCOURGE THE DEVELOPMENT<br />
OF A MORE INNOVATIVE, EFFICIENT AND COMPETITIVE<br />
FINANCIAL SECTORIT<br />
WAS PRECEDED BY THE LIFTING OF A NUMBER OF<br />
RESTRICTIONS WHICH ARTIFICIALLY HAMPERED-THE ABILITY OF<br />
BANKS TO COMPETE IN THE DOMESTIC-FINANCIAL MARKET.<br />
FOREIGN PARTICIPATION WILL ASSIST IN MA. RSHALLING THE<br />
VERY LARGE AMOUNTS OF CAPITAL AND EXPERTISE NEEDED FOR<br />
THE SPEEDY ESTABLISHMENT OF STRONG AND INNOVATIVE NEW<br />
BANKSOF COURSE AUSTRALIANS HAVE A LEGITIMATE DESIRE TO ATTAIN<br />
THE MAXIMUM AUSTRALIAN EQUITY PARTICIPATION CONSISTENT<br />
WITH THfE NEED TO ENSURE EFFECTIVE COMPETITION-THIS IS A<br />
CENTRAL ASPECT OF OUR APPROACH-BUT WE At-SO RECOGNISE<br />
* THAT AUSTRALIA HAS NOT THE RESOURCES TO GO1 IT ALONEBALANCED<br />
JUDGEMENTS WILL BE NEEDED IN4 THIS RESPECT.<br />
OTHER GUIDING CONSIDERATIONS WILL INCLUDE AUSTRALIA'S<br />
COMMERCIAL AND ECONOMIC RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHER<br />
COUNTRIES, THE GEOGRAPHICAL SPREAD OF THE APPLICANTS'<br />
OPERATIONS AND THE NATURE Or THOSE OPERATIONS. ACCOUNT<br />
WILL ALSO BE TAKEN OF CONDITIONS WHICH ARE ATTACHED. To<br />
THE OPERATIONS OF AUSTRALIAN BANKS IN THOSE OTHER<br />
COUNTRIES-</p>
<p>OF COURSE WE RECOGNISE THAT OUR POLICIELS TO ENHANCE THE<br />
. COMPETITIVENESS OF BANKS ARE L'IKELY SIGNIFICANTLY<br />
To INCREASE THE COMPETITIVE PRESSURES FACING MERCHANT<br />
BANKSKATIONALISATION OF THE OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE OF MERCHANT<br />
BANKS A STRUCTURE WHICH WAS THE PRODUCT OF A*<br />
REGULATORY ERA WHICH IS NOW PASSiNG OBVIOUSLY-WOULD<br />
STRENGTHEN THE INDUSTRY AND FACILITATE ITS ADAPTATION TO<br />
CHANGEACCORDINGLY THE GOVERNMENT HAS SET ASIDE FOREIGN<br />
INVESTMENT POLICY FOR THE MERCHANT BANKING SECTOR FOR A<br />
PERIOD'OF TWELVE MONTHSFOREIGN<br />
INVESTMENT POLICY IS ALSO BEING REVIEWED IN<br />
RESPECi-OF THE STOCKBaROKINGa INDUSTRYAGAIN<br />
THE INTENTION IS TO ENSURE ADEQUATE CAPACITY TO<br />
COMPETE EFFECTIVELY IN A DEREGULATED FINANCIAL<br />
ENVIRHONMENTTHESE PARTICULAR EXAMPLES OF FOREIGN INVESTMENT POLICY<br />
ARE INDICATIVE OF OUR APPROACH TO FOREIGN INVESTMENT<br />
MORE GENERALLY-</p>
<p>THAT APPROACH SEEKS TO STRIKE A BALANCE BETWEEN, ON THE<br />
ONE HAND, REAPING ACKNOWLEDGED ECONOMIC 13ENEFITS TO<br />
AUSTRALIA OF FOREIGN INVESTMENT WHILE, ON THE OTHER,<br />
MEETING THE LEGITIMATE EXPECTATION OF THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
COMMUNITY THAT THE EXTENT OF FOREIGN OWNERiSHIP AND<br />
CONTROL SHOULD BE KEPT WITHIN ACCEPTABLE BIOUNDSALL<br />
OF THESE MEASURES TO IMPROVE THE COMP ETITIVENESS OF<br />
THE FINANCIAL SECTOR ARE, LIKE THE TRADE POLICIES I<br />
REFERRED TO EARLIER, BORNE OUT OF ENLIGHTENED SELFINTERESTTHEY<br />
WILL ALSO HELP TO PROMOTE THE EFFICIENT FINANCING<br />
OF AUSTRALIA'S TRADE WITH OUR REGIONAL PARTNERS AND, BY<br />
CONTRIBUTING To AUSTRALIA'IS LONG RUN GROWTH<br />
POTENTIAL, HELP TO STRENGTHEN AUSTRALIA'S CONTRIBUTION TO<br />
THE GROWTH OF THE REGIONTHIS<br />
IS THE ULTIMATE GOAL THAT ALL OF US SPHARE.<br />
BELIEVE AJSTRALIA IS NOW BETTER PLACED THAN IT HAS EVER<br />
BEEN TO ENGAGE PRODUCTIVELY IN THE REGION IS GROWTH<br />
