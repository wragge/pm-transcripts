STRENGTHENED LIAISON WITH ETHNIC COMMUNITIES<br />
The Prime Minister today announced that back bench Members<br />
of the Government Parties would be available in each State<br />
to assist the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs with<br />
promoting liaison with ethnic communities.<br />
Mr Fraser said that the Galbally Report on Migrant Services<br />
and Programs and the Government's acceptance of that Report<br />
had been very well received in these communities.<br />
The Government was determined to have established lines of<br />
communication with the migrant population. The Minister for<br />
Immigration and Ethnic Affairs however, had found it virtually<br />
impossible to accept all invitations for him to visit or attend<br />
functions organised by the various ethnic organisations and<br />
communities throughout Australia.<br />
The Prime Minister said the State nominees would be ready on<br />
occasions to stand in for the Minister, to continue the<br />
development of the positive information to them and to relay<br />
their views back to the Minister.<br />
The nominated members are:<br />
New South Wales<br />
Victoria<br />
Western Australia<br />
South Australia<br />
Tasmania Queens land<br />
Australian Capital<br />
Territory<br />
Northern Territory Mr Cadman, Mr Connolly<br />
Mr Falconer, Mr Simon<br />
Mr McLean<br />
Senator Messner<br />
Senator Walters<br />
Mr Hodges<br />
Mr Haslem.<br />
Senator Kilgariff<br />

<p>AIR FARES<br />
Statement by the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for<br />
Trade and Resources; Mr Anthony, at Southport.<br />
People who are criticising the Minister for<br />
Transport Mr Nixon on international air fare negotiations<br />
are talking either through their hat or their pocket.<br />
Mr Nixon has done a fantastic job in<br />
negotiating significant reductions in airfares not only for<br />
Australians travelling overseas but for people from other<br />
countries coming to Australia.<br />
He has insisted-. that cheaper fares for Australians<br />
must be matched by cheaper fares for visitors to Australia.<br />
Untimately ' these arrangements will be very beneficial not only<br />
for Australian travellers but for the Australian tourist<br />
industry. In discussions this morning with the Gold Coast<br />
Visitors Bureau it was emphasised to me that for tourist areas<br />
outside Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra to benefit, the question<br />
of " add-on" fares must be examined.<br />
The Government is in fact discussing this question<br />
with both international and domestic airlines. In the meantime<br />
if wewant more foreign tourists to visit areas outside the capital<br />
cities the first step is to persuade them to come to Australia.<br />
I am not aware of any strong reaction from ASEAN<br />
countries following the air fare negotiations which have commenced<br />
with those countries. The discussions held in Canberra last week were<br />
cordial and I know that Mr Nixon hopes that cheaper air fares<br />
from Australia to all ASEAN countries and return will be the<br />
outcome of the negotiations.<br />
