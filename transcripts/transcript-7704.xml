PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCE, TINDAL RAAF0 BASE<br />
9 AUGUST 1989<br />
E OE PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: this morning?<br />
PM: I really haven't taken any Lime to look at them. I've<br />
Sbeen told they are good. But I'm up here to look at Kangaroo<br />
89 and I can tell you it's a matter of very great pride<br />
to be here. Not only the obvious efficiency but the commitment<br />
and pride of our fellows is something that I find very moving.<br />
JOURNALIST: You spoke to Geoffrey Palmer yesterday. Did<br />
you talk to him about New Zealand's position on the nuclear<br />
ships ban.<br />
PM: No, not particularly. I was talking with him about<br />
that before. The New Zealand Government knows the position<br />
of itself and my Government on this. We just disagree with<br />
them on that. It's been made clear on many occasions.<br />
But 1 did take the opportunity of saying to him that I hope<br />
they would go ahead with the frigate deal. That wads a much<br />
more immediate concern.<br />
JOURNALIST: What did he respond to that?<br />
SPM: I think it's not Lair that I -go into the details of<br />
a private discussion, from his point of view. I believe<br />
that he will be supportive and I hope that that's the result<br />
that will emerge.<br />
JOURNALIST: If New Zealand didn't want to be pairt of the<br />
frigate deal, what implications might there be-for our defence<br />
relationship with them?<br />
PM: I've made it quite clear before. I'll say it again.<br />
New Zealand can't expect that a decision of that kind would<br />
have no impact. We have deliberately, since New Zealand<br />
made the decision to cease effectively to be part of ANZUS,<br />
we have deliberately increased the bilateral defence cooperation.<br />
We've done that with the agreement and the under standing<br />
of the United States. You can't have a position where it's<br />
essentially all one way, where Australia is accepting more </p>
<p>and more of the responsibility for what must essentially<br />
be seen as a shared involvement. If-Australia and New Zealand<br />
are going to be able to maximise the opportunity for effective<br />
cooperation, there must be a degree of interoperability<br />
of equipment and training. Quite clearly the capacity of<br />
Australia and New Zealand to have an extension of their<br />
naval capacity depends upon the way in which we can cooperate.<br />
A decision on their part not to be part of this extension<br />
of our capacity, which should be a joint capacity, would<br />
be disadvantagous and the judgement would inevitably be<br />
one that would be somewhat adverse to the relationship as<br />
far as Australia was concerned if that was their decision.<br />
O JOURNALIST: You're about to board anACWAC, an American<br />
? AEWAC. Would you like to see Auistralia have that sort of<br />
apabil1ity?<br />
PM: The concept is interesting but the equipment is extraordinarily<br />
expensive and is not necessarily the type that would be<br />
appropriate for Australia. We maintain an interest in the<br />
concept and we will be looking to see down the track whether<br />
there is a version of this concept which is both more<br />
appropriate to our needs and our economic capacity.<br />
JOURNALIST: The Industrial Relationu Commission decision<br />
to give a 6.5% wage rise. Is that going to take the pressure<br />
off Australian families?<br />
PM: It will be part of an overall range of decisions.<br />
to the approach which affect the standards of Australian<br />
families. There are wages and I'm glad to see that the<br />
decision has been made which will mean significant increases<br />
for pooplo lower gt~ ndard of income who need it and<br />
also for those with skills. secondly there's tax. We've<br />
just seen the signficant reductions iii tax now operative.<br />
Thirdly there's the decisions that are taken in the area<br />
of social welfare, with very significant increases for families<br />
particularly lower income families. When you take those<br />
three strands of policy together then you are having a degree<br />
of protection which Australian families need and deserve.<br />
JOURNALIST: So you reject the criticism of the wage rise<br />
by the Opposition?<br />
PM: Well, is anyone taking the Opposition Very seriously<br />
at the moment on anything?<br />
JOURNALIST: affeoL the prospect of tax cuts which you<br />
mentioned on Sunday? </p>
<p>3<br />
PM: Listen, you wouli've ueen. I hope, the transcript of<br />
what I said on Sunday and also what I said on Monday. I've<br />
said no more and no less than this. That in over six years<br />
we have taken the decisions which are necessary to advance<br />
Australia's growth and protect Australia's interests. We'll<br />
do that at all times. I have said no more than that as<br />
we prepare for 1990-91 that all relevant options are on<br />
the table. That would be one that would be on the table.<br />
But there is no intention to announce that there would be<br />
any tax cuts. I said, and the transcript shows, that that<br />
would be an option that could be considered. In regard<br />
to 89-90 surpluses, they have already been taken into account<br />
in the tax cuts that are operating now. Quite clearly,<br />
what will continue to be predominant in our considerations<br />
is the current account and the protection of our external<br />
Sposition. Within that overall framework of approach as<br />
I say, everything will be on that table. But there is no<br />
promise, no commitment in the arenof tax cuts. There wasn't<br />
on Sunday, there wdsn'L on Monday, and as I recall it it's<br />
Wednesday today, there's none on Wednesday.<br />
JUUKNIIIAbr: .~ UaU1 ljuvm that you will mako a docigion<br />
on the frigate next week? do you think you can get<br />
PM: very near future. The Minister for Defence, Mr<br />
Beazley, has the intention to bring the recommendation of<br />
the Defence Forces to us in the relatively near future.<br />
Whether it's next week or the week after will be a matter<br />
for decision by Mr Beazley. But it's in the very near future.<br />
JOURNALIST: your showing in the Morgan figures out<br />
today?<br />
PM: No, I'm more interested in other things up hure.<br />
