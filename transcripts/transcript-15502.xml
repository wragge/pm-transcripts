    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to announce the Australian Government will spend $10 million for a planning and engineering study, including a detailed environmental investigation, for an expressway standard connection over the Blue Mountains.  </p>
<p>This funding is conditional on the New South Wales Government providing a matching commitment bringing the total funding available to $20 million.</p>
<p>These funds are provided in recognition of the importance of the Central West to Australia's economy and the potential for further growth if a more direct connection to Sydney was available.  The Australian Government included the Sydney to Dubbo corridor on the AusLink National Network through the inclusion of the Great Western and Mitchell Highways.  This followed the provision of $100 million to the Great Western Highway as a Road of National Importance.  We are committed to continuing to work with NSW on the upgrade of this corridor.<br />
However, the Coalition Government believes strongly in ensuring the long-term needs underpinning economic growth are considered.  The Australian Government is currently finalising a Corridor Strategy for Sydney to Dubbo.<br />
We must work with New South Wales to address the long term needs for this corridor, including the limitations of the current route.<br />
There are already strong proposals for a Bells Line Expressway which the Coalition Government believes should be investigated under this study.  While this study would normally be a responsibility of the State Government, we are willing to work in partnership to ensure the best outcome for the people of New South Wales, including those in the Central West.  We recognise much work has to be done before this project will be in a position to proceed to construction, however, the Coalition strongly believes in working with State Governments to plan for the long term benefit of Australia's economy.  I urge the New South Wales Government to work with us on this vital project.  I also urge the State Government to recognise the need, and begin planning for, improved the access from the M4 to the base of the Blue Mountains as part of the State transport network.<br />
The $10 million will be available from the next round of AusLink due to begin in 2009.</p>
