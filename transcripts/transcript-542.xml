FINANCE FOR STATES 1962/ 61<br />
STATEMENT BY THE TREASURER RT. HON. HAROLD HOLT<br />
The massive programme of works, housing and special<br />
development projects agreed upon between the Commonwealth and<br />
State Governments undertaken in association with the improvement<br />
already appearing in production and employment should help to<br />
ensure a high level of economic activity throughout 1962/ 63.<br />
The amount of funds being provided for State Governments is Å 14<br />
million greater than the high total to which provision for these<br />
functions w. s lifted by the measures of last February.<br />
The ordinary State borrowing programmes for works and<br />
housing next year will be Å 250 million against the Å 247.5 million<br />
agreed in February for 1961/ 62, the non-repayable interest-free<br />
grant of Å 12.5 million which we will make to the States next year<br />
compares with a special Å 10 million grant made in February. We<br />
have already notified approval for expenditure of approximately<br />
Å 16 million on projects like the Mount Isa Railway, the Western<br />
Australian Standard Gauge Railway, coal handling Port facilities<br />
in New South Wales and Queensland and beef roads, on which<br />
expenditure this year was under Å 7 million. Total provision<br />
for these categories in 1962/ 63 is estimated to be Å 278 million as<br />
as against Å 264 million in the current financial year.<br />
But this is far from being the whole story. The<br />
provision by the Commonwealth Government for roads is likely<br />
to rise this year Å 4 million to Å 54 million. The approved<br />
borrowing programme for semi-governmental authorities those<br />
seeking to borrow Å 100,0O or more has been fixed at Å 105.15<br />
:: illion. This is higher than the exceptionally high figure of<br />
Å 104 million to which these programmes were raised, in three<br />
successive steps during 1961/ 62. It is 20% greater than the<br />
borrowing programmes of th-se authorities in 1960/ 61. </p>
<p>got the bonefit of 3ubstantial incrcoses in Commnn e1, t h<br />
contributions to develo-onrnta! irojccts like the Munt Isa<br />
Railwayo, beef roads and the Port of Gladstone. This is being<br />
done for two rood reasons. One is the recognition that jicensland<br />
offers very considerable potential for export devcelopm. nt. The<br />
second is th!. at we bolieve that ther. is -encral public acceDptancce<br />
