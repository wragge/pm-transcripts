TRANSCRIPT: JON LA17S ( RADIO 2UE, SYDNEY) INTERVIEWS THE<br />
PRIME MINISTERP THE HON. R. J. L. HAWKE, AC, UAP.<br />
DATE: FRIDAY 21ST SEPTEMABER 1984<br />
LAWS: Prime Minister. Good Morning and welcome.<br />
PRIME MINISTE~ R: Good Morning John. Thank you.<br />
LAVS: Settle down to a cup of coffee.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Thanks.<br />
LAWS:-Wasn't the best day in the world yesterday eh?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No. not an experience likIe that.<br />
LAWS: I don't think it's an experience that anybody would like to<br />
go through. I must say that I felt great empathy with you<br />
yesterday having had a similar experience at the hands of others,<br />
and when your family and your children are involved it's pretty<br />
tough to handle.<br />
PRIM4E MINISTER: Yes and you know particularly %,. hen people just<br />
cai know exactly what's involved and you've got to just carry that.<br />
W~ hat Il'Ve-wanted to concenitrate on since I'Ve been in Government;,<br />
and what I want to concentrate on i6 running-the country and turning<br />
Australia around. That's what the important issues are about. Blut<br />
when something like this arises in a matter on which you have tthp<br />
deepest posszible feelings as I do about * th + e issue of drugs, as I<br />
said in my statement, that in one area in which I have to ctruggle<br />
to be rational when I contemplate what I would like to do to<br />
anyone who is involved In drug traffitking. It is just Impossible<br />
to, when you've got intimate eocperiences about this sort of thing,<br />
it produces that sort of situation and it's not something I'm<br />
ashamed of. It's just there. But what I vant to concentrate on,<br />
as I always have, is the important questions of, as~ I s'ay, of<br />
getting this country running, trying to get people back to workr, get<br />
Inflation down.<br />
LAWIS: I wonder if pe-o; pl really,-realiso-howv strongly you do feel<br />
about drugs. ItIG not som-pthin~ g thaZ-you've been open~ y public<br />
about before.<br />

that I would protect people involved in that sort Of business<br />
where in fact, as I say, I have to try and control my rationality<br />
in terms of contemplating what I'd do to anyone that was involved<br />
in it.<br />
LAWIS: Yes, and irrespective of what Costigan ultimately shows,<br />
irrespective of who Costigan may ultimately point to anybody<br />
it wouldn't matter who it was or what it was, you would still<br />
carry the same repulsion to that sort of activity as you woiqld<br />
friend, foe or otherwise;'<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Absolutely John. As I said in my stitement<br />
yesterday: let the cards fall where they my. Whether I know or<br />
don't know, whatever the station in life of the persontpersons<br />
who may through proper processes be brought to book, then not only<br />
no sympathy but you will find this Prime Minister insisting that<br />
it be taken through to the. end.<br />
LAWS: Do you believe that Costigan will show anything worthwhile<br />
in that regard7<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well it's~ difficult for me to make the conclusion.<br />
All I can say is that in areas of tax avoidance industry Frank<br />
Costigan made a monumental ccritrihution to thE! welfare of this<br />
country. Now there are references in the drug area which he has<br />
handed across to the National Crimes Authority. It's for the<br />
National Crimes Authority now, 014n their examination. and the<br />
inter-governmental committee in their examination to imake the<br />
decision, and I simply thinkt it's not fair for me to either of<br />
those authorities or to any individuals who may be involved for meto<br />
see ex~ ternally timpose my judgement. The only think that I want.<br />
to say John is that I will be insisting not that it will need it<br />
because the National Crimes Authority is composed of three competent<br />
and dedicated me ' n but the absolute insistence that every<br />
investigation that possib). y~ can be made must be made.<br />
LAWS: It seems to mne the Opposition's main thrust has been<br />
allegedly that you cust short Costigan.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Vell that's timply not the case. Both Mr. Fraser<br />
and myself, both our Governmentshave hade the position that th.) e<br />
work of -the Costigan Royal Commiss,, ion would be subsumed into the<br />
N~ ational Crimes Authority. We have, as a Govern= msnt, almost<br />
doubled the resources available to the Cost. igan crime commission<br />
so that they would have everything available to thenm. We ' ve<br />
extended the time. It is true that Mr. Costigan would have liked<br />
m~ ore time but he spoke with Mr. Young earlier t: his year in the<br />
light of the correspondence between us, and the timetablo. was agreedriot<br />
for finishing tho work of the Costigar, orirr* e commission but<br />
arranging the transition of it to the NFational * Crimes Authority. I<br />
thinl
yational Crim'-s Authority you have in M~ r. Justice Stewrxrt a pe_ rSon<br />
who is Tielely reco-nised and respe cted for his capacities-in this<br />
area, And you have the two others, yer and M~ r. Bingham, % who<br />
were unanitnously eridorsncI by all the Governm: nt-s of Australia, afl( 3<br />
that's one of the importauT: things if you are c. oing to male a<br />
I ationzl Crimes Authority z'ork. You have got to have the.<br />
cooperation of the States nnld the State police forces. So vwe<br />

TRANSCRIPT JOHN LAWS STHOW Pae<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Absolttly ba~ eless. As far as T am concerned<br />
I want the Costigan Report puiblished.. They rre going on and saying<br />
will I publish the Costigan R~ eport. I want it published, and the<br />
only considerations which must apply, and which have applied und-er<br />
their Government with the previous report that they received from<br />
Costigan the majority of which were either not published at all<br />
or were published with deletions that's what happened under<br />
their Government and rightly so because what Roy * al Commissions are<br />
concerned about if they are invest igat ing these sorts of things is<br />
that what they find in their reportings, where it's going to lead<br />
to further* prosecutions,. you shouldn't publish which will inhibit<br />
the capaity of the ongoing Authority to pursue their investigatiocns<br />
and bring people to justice on the one hand, and on the other hand,<br />
the civil liberties of individuals who may te* proved to be innocent.<br />
So there is a constraint upon nams, but let me make it clear that<br />
if those constraints are recommenided.-by Mr. Commissioner Costigan<br />
or the National Crimes -Athority who will see the report, or the<br />
Attorney-Geeral's Department or hMr.* Temby, if then there are those<br />
deletions of names for reasons recomax-nded by those who have to<br />
udnertake the inquiry M~ r. Peacock as Leader of the . Opposition will<br />
be given the unabridged report. there is no question of hiding<br />
anything. The Leader of the Opposition will get the full report<br />
but there may be, because of the instructions of Mr. Costigan and<br />
those concerned, be a deletion of names for the public interest<br />
so that<br />
LAWS: But that's normal procedure.<br />
PRIME MdINISTER: That's exactly all the previous Costigan reports<br />
that went to the previous Government they were either not publis.-jed<br />
at all or there were, on the strict recommendation of those<br />
concerned, the deletion of parts which, if published, could hinder<br />
future inquiries and prosecutions.<br />
LAWS: Now Andrew Peacock must have been aware of that.<br />
PRIME MINICTER: Of course.<br />
LAWS: W~ hy did he then endeavour to make something unpleasant from<br />
it?<br />
PRIME MAINISTER: A very simple answer you ask yourself how far<br />
Mr. Peacock or the Opposition has addressed Itself to the economy<br />
in the last 12 months. 71e sit on that front bench and wait in vain<br />
for questions about the ec -onomy because the performance of this<br />
Government has been--r so outstanding. 1 ': e've achieved a turnaround<br />
from where they had this economy in recession to the point now<br />
vzhore w,. e've achieved in tho lasc year the strongest economic growith<br />
of any country in the western w,, orld -the hightest and a situation<br />
where w,, e've created a quarter of' a million ncew jobs against toe -i<br />
quarter of a million that were loz
Government; where we've more th. n halved the inflation rat--; where<br />
we've brought interest, ravtes downi; wimhre retacil sales are now<br />
moving upwards; whiere private Invectn' 2nt is piching up; rhere Y ~ c<br />
deregulated the fina-ncial s; ector to giv'e great competition in tz<br />
banking system which %-. ill ' 00 Of tienefit to the people. Now these<br />
are the things that wel'v n; OUC Whi'ch in everyday terms raean that<br />
Australia is becoming stcosdily bettcr place for all Austrnl. 44. ns,<br />
JyLl; J itltle wonder thnat g-t ino U&amp; tOA in that area. So ; h'<br />

LAWIS: But why is it i" ve not ' eard of it happeoning anywhere else<br />
in the world you're far morre wordly than 1: an* maybe you have.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't know about that John.<br />
LAUS: The denigration of a human being simply because he's<br />
successful seema to be the easy out in Australia. It doesn't<br />
matter in what area, the tall poppy has got to be struck down, and<br />
in the dirtiest way with accusations of drugs and hidden money<br />
and unpleasantries. Why does it happen in Australia.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well it seems to be a part of the pattern of<br />
conservative politics here of no &amp; ontgo issues. You remember<br />
in the earlier days -the attack upon the Labor Party was not upon<br />
policies it was the commy can kick the commy can -now that's<br />
gone out of fashion. Perhaps people-are a bit more sophisticate.<br />
now because they undersfgand the truth of Australian politics and<br />
it looke a bit silly attacking Hawke as a cormunist sympathiser.<br />
So you can't attacl. Labor leaders on the basis of tney are coinmy<br />
sympathisers or something like that. So instead of commies it's<br />
crooks now. Now I said yesterday John and I repeat it here on your<br />
program, I understand the' rough and tumble of politics, I engage in<br />
it, but I have consistently said from the day I entered the<br />
. Parliament that I would never say anything in the Parliament that<br />
I wasn't prepared to say outside and X have religiously adhered<br />
to that.. Now it seems to me that ther,? are limits and the<br />
Australian people expect limits to thi~ s rough and tumble of<br />
debate and Mr. Peacock has gone beyond that limit when he calls me<br />
a crook and that I associate with criminals. and that I'm direceted<br />
by criminals and that in the conten~ t whbere he knows that the major<br />
area that's involved in these investigations is drugs. Now to<br />
accuse the Prime Minister of this country of being-directed by<br />
criminals to try and protect those engaged in the drug traf fic*,<br />
as I said yesterday, that's not the gutter of' politics, that is<br />
the sewer.<br />
LAWS: They now say, the Opposition, today that you've dished out<br />
plenty and obviously you can't take it. I think John Howard said<br />
you had a glass jaw when it came to this sort of thing.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well I don't believe I've got a glass jaw but Irn<br />
not in the businers of defending my emotions and rpy character ist ics.<br />
I'm inade the way I am for better or, for wiorse. Thore are son(-,<br />
aupects of may rL. keup that at times embarrass me but I've al%,. ays<br />
been one John who felt, whether Wt5 in regard to yourself or any<br />
other aspect of life, thnrp's not much point spending time<br />
wishing that something else may have been difierent b--cau-e<br />
that is the iyost fruitless exercise in humiin existence to waste<br />
time-on trying to undo things th-at can't be-undone. Vhat people In<br />
life must do, if they arc commiltted to public life, is to try arid<br />
concentrate their energ. ies, 3 upon chiangiing thin,-s and imnproving thirg. s<br />
that can be changed and can be-improved. !\ Tow I Just draw this<br />
distinction which I would hope John Hc\ w. ard woild tanderstand<br />
I will criticioe arid I'l1 be a toug-h criticise:-r of my opponents,<br />
or of roiy friends : Tor thatl matter, it' -7 think -they bave acted<br />
improparly, un'wisely -but 1 don't think thbat the wholoe of ny<br />
record would display any ocsonin) ,. hich I hav'e without<br />

unacceptable attack and if I respond with emotion to that attackZso<br />
be it and particularly in the circumstances ih which I find<br />
myself placed.<br />
LAWS: You said that there are facen. s of yot'r makeup that somextiAmes<br />
. embarrass you.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: It just seems to be in my nature that my emotions<br />
show more easily perhaps than a lot of people in public life. Now<br />
it's always been the case. There is nothing that I can do about<br />
it. I wish obviously that the makeup was different at timea* It<br />
can be somewhat embarrassing. I'm not exporessing shame or any<br />
of tbat sort, of thing. but obviously there is a degree of<br />
embarrassment about it. I accept thlt. B3ut as I say I don't<br />
waste time thinking about it, I want to get on with as I have<br />
since the day I became Prime Miniister I want to get on ' with the<br />
commitment of trying to make Australia a better place. I believe<br />
that we have an enormous number of runs on the board already John.<br />
I want to keep accumulating and piling thbose runs up on the bo: ard<br />
for Australia.-<br />
LAWS: I said to you earlier and I said it yesterday and I said<br />
it this morning and I'd' say it again, a mnan who becomes Prir.:. !! iniste7<br />
of a country is * a man wiho requires a modicum of ego, you don?' t<br />
become Prime Minister Unless you are pretty sure of yourself.<br />
:' nIME MINISTER: Yes I accept that.<br />
LAWS: And I think thFat for a man to be prepared to throw aside his<br />
opinion of himself in order to express an opinibn tha-t he has for<br />
people that be loves takes a great deal of character, more<br />
character than % pe-rbaps a lot of people realise.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Thanks John.<br />
LAWIS: And I hope your family give you the love that they should<br />
give you and the love you deserve w! hen you' re prepared to throw your<br />
owin ego out the door in order to defend-. them.<br />
PRUIE M~ INISTER: There is no lack of love In that direction, it's<br />
very much a two-way relationship.<br />
LAW7S: Vhat did your wife say when you got home last night?<br />
PRILRE MINISTER: Uazel is on her way back from Western Australi.<br />
and we've only been able to trAlk on the phone John. She'll ha<br />
