TRANSCRIPT OF QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS FOLLOWITNG ADDRESS TO THE<br />
NATIONIAL PRESS CLUB# WASHINGTON, 26 JUNE3 1989<br />
X A02-PROOF ONLY<br />
JrOURNALIST. FPollowing your talks with Agriliture<br />
Yeutter today, are you confident the Americans are prepared<br />
to concede any ground on the Export Enhancement Program?<br />
PN: Well I think the correct way of putting it is as<br />
follows. in discussions with not only Hr Yeutter but with<br />
the President and with Robert Dole, I think there is a clear<br />
understanding that we in Australia are not confecting some<br />
concern about this issue. I believe that they will listen<br />
further to the arguments that we put about this issue. I<br />
think the important point is that which I eluded to in my<br />
address and that 15 that we do have a period now of<br />
opportunity. Until the end of 1990 when on our assessment<br />
the impact the adverse impact of the EEP is not going to<br />
be great relative to what has happened before because of the<br />
stocks and price situation. In that period we do have an<br />
absolutely identical objective that we should work within the<br />
Round to achieve a situation where there will be an<br />
elimination of subsidies so that the tree market can operate<br />
in regard to agriculture. I have proposed the concept that<br />
in the preparation of the new Farm Bill that it would make<br />
sense to consider including in it some provisions which would<br />
mean that if there is a successful outcome of the Round then<br />
that any intention to pursue those provisions would not be<br />
triggered. So I think in that situation that there will come<br />
to be an acceptance that we have been adversely affected.<br />
But the important thing is now to work together to ensure<br />
not only as between us but internationally we're going to<br />
remove these sorts of considerations so that there can be a<br />
level playing field. within that level playing field<br />
Australia will do well because we are the world's most<br />
efficient producer of agricultural products.<br />
JOURNALIST: Could you amplify a portion of that? Is this to<br />
Bay then that the United States will be less critical of US<br />
policy and more supportive of efforts to achieve changes in<br />
agricultural policies in Japan and the European Community? </p>
<p>PH: It's not a question of being more or less critical. The<br />
important thing is that there be a common basis of analysis<br />
of what the impact and the cost of these programs are. Now<br />
let's just in regard to the United States understand what the<br />
cost of your agriculture support policies are. The fact is<br />
that in 1988 the total cost to the United States taxpayers<br />
and consumers was just under $ 74B. it was $ 73.8B. That was<br />
the total cost to the United States consumers and taxpayers.<br />
Now by any calculas I mean I know you talk in much bigger<br />
figures than we do when talking about budget figures and so<br />
on but $ 73.8B is a lot of cookies. It's a hell of an<br />
inflation of your cost in price structure. The Europeans are<br />
even worse. H~ ow the important thing is rather than just<br />
being negatively critical, to try and get through to policy<br />
makers here and in Europe and in Japan that they've got it<br />
all wrong, that they are being influenced very, very unduly<br />
by a small proportionist population that is its farmers<br />
and that the large numbers of the population, of your<br />
industry, your consumers are paying a massive price. in<br />
Europe the best calculations are that employment would be at<br />
least a million higher if there was not the impact of the<br />
CAP, that their whole cost and price structure is massively<br />
inflated, that the population as a whole is paying a stupid<br />
and unacceptably high price. The same is true here. I mean<br />
it's politics gone crazy, its economics insane. So what has<br />
to be done is that there be straight, honest, not bitter, but<br />
straight, honest talking, that we've all got it wrong, that<br />
the Japanese public, the American public, the European<br />
public, are paying a silly and unacceptably high price. Now<br />
that's what the period between now and 1990 has got to be<br />
about so we can get agreement that it doesn't make sense to<br />
Jeopardise the increasing political intelligence that's<br />
characterising the relations between countries. We are<br />
moving into a period in human history where we can talk with<br />
more optimism than ever before, ever before, that we're going<br />
to have sensible political relations, that the threat of<br />
conflict is diminishing. But the great paradox, as I said<br />
recently in London, the great paradox is as that we behave<br />
more intelligently in our political relations, we're putting<br />
all that at risk by economic lunacy. We've got to get the<br />
symetry right in our intelligence.<br />
JOURNALIST: Last week the council of the General Agreement<br />
on Tariffs and Trade accepted the findings on your complaint<br />
over US cuts in sugar imports from Australia. In view of<br />
Australia's total embargo on sugar imports since 1915, how<br />
much time are you prepared to give the US to get in the<br />
compliance? </p>
<p>-3-<br />
PM: We speak now from a position of great strength. We've<br />
Moved to stop the embargo in Australia on imports. We've<br />
moved to a tariff regime so the embargo will be removed. NOW<br />
it took Australia a fairly long time before we got there.<br />
But in our period in office we've moved to make sure that<br />
when we speak to the rest of the world about what they should<br />
do, we speak with clean hands and a clear conscience. so<br />
when we talk about freeing up the markets, we've made sure<br />
that as far as Australia Is concerned where we've had<br />
basically free trading situation in regard to agricultural<br />
products. In regard to sugar we were blurred. We've changed<br />
that, we've now moved to a situation where that embargo on<br />
imports will be removed, we'll have a clear tariff position<br />
where there will be able to be imports. Now it took<br />
Australia you might say, 89 years to get to that sensible<br />
position. But as with most things in economic management,<br />
it's all been accelerated since we've been here here, we've<br />
got there in six years. But I don't think you're going to<br />
need 6 years to fix it up here. I've had discussions with Mr<br />
Yeutter today and I think that we have agreement that there<br />
will be an acceptable way now of the United States handling<br />
the decision that's been moade by the GATT panel.<br />
JOURNALISTt Debate on trade in this country has focussed<br />
primarily on unilateral US actions against other trade<br />
barriers. Do you believe that Washington generally is<br />
concentrating too much on unilateral action at the expense of<br />
the Uruguay Round of Trade Negotiations? Are you concerned<br />
that recent Super 301 actions against Japan, India and Brazil<br />
could jeopardise the success of the Uruguay Round?<br />
PM: We're not too happy about the concept of Super 301. As<br />
you say, it's Japan, India and Brazil at the moment but<br />
you've got others on the contingency list, many more. We are<br />
somewhat worried about an increasing resort to this bilateral<br />
mechanism and our view that we have been and will continue to<br />
express is that the emphasis should be upon rectifying the<br />
international trading system. We've got a very short tine<br />
left, we've got until the end of 1.990 and we know how slowly<br />
th~ ese things move. This was the essence of the discussion<br />
I had this morning with 14r Yeutter and without going to the<br />
details, I believe we have addressed certain tactical<br />
measures which together we may be able to usefully employ<br />
which will ensure that in that period we can maximise the<br />
chances of those negotiations being successful. That is<br />
infinetly the preferable way so I merely express the hope<br />
that to the extent that that legilative provision is there,<br />
the United States will take relatively sparing use of it.<br />
JOURNALIST: Has the Australian economy become overly<br />
dependent on the world's gold and metal industry? Could your<br />
economy survive a long price decline? </p>
<p>Pm: I know where that one came from. No, we're overly<br />
dependent on the gold and metals industry as an analysis of<br />
our production statistics and exports statistics will show.<br />
obviously Australia would suffer very considerably if you had<br />
a very long decline in commodity prices, and I assume you're<br />
not Just talking about prices for gold and minerals. we<br />
and I know those sorts of figures don't loom very large for<br />
you, they do for Australia we lost in 1985-86 $ 11B of our<br />
national income through the very significant decline in terms<br />
of trade. In rough terms $ 11B represents between 3-4% of our<br />
GDP. So that was a very massive decline and so we are<br />
watching the level of commodity prices with very keen<br />
interest. I must say that as far as we can see the outlook<br />
for commodity prices in the rest of this year and into 1990<br />
looks relatively sound. But the important thing to note<br />
about the Australian economy is that in the 6 years that<br />
we've been in Government what we've been about is a process<br />
of restructuring the Australian economy so that we will not<br />
be so dependent upon movements in commodity prices both of<br />
agricultural products and mineral products. We have been<br />
excessively exposed to fluctuations in those areas and it is<br />
of some satisf action to us that we are lifting the level of<br />
exports of manufactured goods and services so that gradually<br />
we will not have the degree of exposure as I say, to<br />
movements in those commodity prices.<br />
JOURNALIST: After 7 years of negotiation, what has caused<br />
Australia to change its position regarding the Convention of<br />
the Regulation of Antarctic Mineral Resource Activities?<br />
PM: Obviously to some extent I've referred to that in the<br />
address I've just made. Let me very briefly try and make the<br />
point. The whole process of negotiation of CRANRA, the<br />
convention in regard to the mining of mineral resources in<br />
the Antarctic, wasn begun in a period where the world had a<br />
quite different perception of environmental issues. So what<br />
they were about was an approach which was predicated upon the<br />
mining of resources, the potential mining of resources in the<br />
Antarctic, and to get some sort of convention around that<br />
which would minimise the problem. Now I think if we are<br />
intelligent at all, if we understand anything, we know that<br />
an we cone to the end of the 1980a it's a very, very<br />
different world in its perception of a whole range of issues,<br />
including environmental issues, than it was at-the beginning<br />
of 1980. We take the view now that it's not very sensible to<br />
be usinq a convention for mining as an instrument for<br />
protecting the Antarctic against the problems of mining.<br />
It's doesn't make a hell of a lot of sense we think. There<br />
is increasing evidence of the fragility of the Arctic and the<br />
Antarctic environment. The Exxon Valdez has showed what can </p>
<p>( PM cont) happen there and vs there and we believe it just<br />
makes sense now not to take that risk and we are very, very<br />
pleased that in then period, the relatively short period since<br />
we've made that decision, we have now received the support of<br />
the Government of India, the Government of France,<br />
indications of support from a number of others, and as I said<br />
in my address, it is my belief and the belief of the<br />
Australian Government. Ilia pleased to say it's crossed the<br />
Australian political spectrum that this is the right course<br />
of action and I express the view that if there's one thing we<br />
are witnessing in world politics today, it is that people<br />
across the economic spectrum, across the political spectrum,<br />
across the age spectrum, are becoming increasingly concerned<br />
with issues of the environment. I believe that in this<br />
period ahead as we attempt to pursuade others of the<br />
correctness of our position that we will be increasingly<br />
supported by the weight of world opinion. I don't tinkc the<br />
world is going to take the view that it makes sense to<br />
endanger that last pristine environment by the risk and the<br />
danger of mining.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are environmental concerns having an impact on<br />
Australian politics?<br />
PH: Yes, as on politics all around the world. I mean the<br />
thing that's happened as I was just saying, that it's become<br />
an issue because in large measure, where you were talking<br />
about the environment earlier in this decade and last<br />
decades, if people were talking about a forest or a river or<br />
a lake, the great majority of people tend to say, ' oh well<br />
it's their forest, their lake, their river', and they didn't<br />
in any very real sense tend to identify their own interests<br />
with the environmental concerns of the few. That's changed.<br />
I think you could say it's changed dramatically in the last<br />
18 months. The environmental issues now are not capable of<br />
being isolated by region or by nation. If there's a hole, as<br />
0 there is in the ozone layer which is posing very considerable<br />
dangers for people, it's not in part of one nation or in one<br />
nation and not another, it's a danger for all. The<br />
Greenhouse Effect is not a danger for one area or-another.<br />
It's posing a danger for everyone today and particularly for<br />
the next generation, for our kids and for their kids. So<br />
whereas you had this compartmentalisation of environmental<br />
concern, you don't have it anymore. People are saying these<br />
issues concern me, they concern my kids. So in that<br />
circumstance you're witnessing right around the world<br />
including in Australia an increasing understanding of and<br />
concern with environmental issues. It will be the case<br />
whether it's Australia or in any other country that those<br />
conventional parties, those historical parties who seek to </p>
<p>( P14 cont) ignore this issue, will do so not at their peril<br />
but at the certainty of political devastation. Fortunately<br />
in my case in Australia we don't have to be jumping on to any<br />
latter day band wagon. For because fromn day one where we<br />
saved the Franklin River and with our decisions i. n regard to<br />
world heritage in regard to which I may say the World<br />
Heritage Bureau has said that no government has done more to<br />
protect world heritage values than has the Australian<br />
Government. So we don't have to become latter day converts.<br />
We understood these things from day one.<br />
JOURNALIST: Speaking of world heritage values, do you see<br />
any paradox in your country's, in your Government's support<br />
for environmental issues and what this question says is the<br />
approved slaughter of nearly 4 million kangaroos annually?<br />
M34 No, none at all. That's a very facile sort of question.<br />
The fact is that we have very stringent measures to protect<br />
those species which could in any sense be endangered. We<br />
have a massive, a massive kangaroo population. Now come and<br />
see them sometime. There is a very, very strictly controlled<br />
culling and shooting program which is justified by and is<br />
regulated in terms of considerations which are necessary for<br />
protection of the working farming environment. But in regard<br />
to those areas of those species which could be in any danger<br />
there is the strictest preservation. We have nothing to<br />
apologis for in that area. There is no inconsistency. </p>
<p>-7-<br />
JOURNALIST: Changing gears for a moment, what will be Australia's<br />
response if the United States goes ahead with its plan to give<br />
lethal aid to the non-Communist resistance in Cambodia of<br />
Kampuchea? PM: Members of the travelling Australian press will recognise that<br />
as a hypothetical question which usually gets-very short shrift<br />
in my country when they ask me hypothetical questions. I have to<br />
be slightly more accommodating in this environment I guess. Let<br />
me say that this is an area which I've yet to discuss in detail<br />
with my friends here in the United States, I did have a brief<br />
discussion with Vice-President Quayle about it when he was in<br />
Australia earlier this year, It is a matter that I will be<br />
discussing with the President and Secretary of State Baker, but<br />
it will be no secret that we have taken the view that we think<br />
4 he provision of lethal aid is inappropriate. I understand the<br />
thinking which is behind those who are contemplating it, but we<br />
think that the processes, and let me say of course when I was<br />
talking to Vice-President Quayle before the events, the recent<br />
tragic events in China, we took the view that the process in<br />
negotiation, the various strands of negotiation in regard to the<br />
settlement of the tragedy in Kampuchea, had reached a point<br />
where, in our judgement, it would have been counterproductive to<br />
provide lethal aid, and I expressed that view to the Vice-<br />
President. N~ ow, we have no reason to change our view about that,<br />
though it must be said that, given the recent events in China,<br />
that you have to have question marks as to what those changes<br />
will do to the Chinese attitude to the processes of negotiation<br />
for a settlement in Indochina. But even with that question mark<br />
it must be in ones's mind what will they do? Will they try and<br />
upset the negotiations, even with that question mark? The view<br />
that I expressed to Vice President Quayle in Australia remains<br />
unchanged, but, as I say, I've got to have more detailed<br />
discussions about this with the President and the Secretary of<br />
Otate tomorrow.<br />
JOURNALIST: What advice do you have for President Bush on current<br />
events in China?<br />
PM: Well, we don't presume to give advice, but let me say that in<br />
the very congenial period that I had with the President at Camp<br />
David yesterday, the issue of China was the one that took up most<br />
of our time. We're in the position where both of us have a very<br />
considerable degree of knowledge and involvement with China, in<br />
the case of the President of course, involving his time as<br />
Ambassador to there, and in my case reflecting very, very long<br />
hours of discussions that I've been able to have with leaders of<br />
China over the last six years, both in my country and in China.<br />
I'm able to say that the position of the President and myself is<br />
essentially at one. May I sum it up in this way. Firstly we agree<br />
that there can be nothing but condemnation, unqualified<br />
condemnation of the barbarity which is reflected in Tiannantman<br />
Square and in subsequent persecution and execution of people in<br />
China. We are at one in saying that we and the rest of the world<br />
must, without qualification, condemn that suppression of<br />
legitimate human ampirations. We also are at one in recognising<br />
that it is important for the people of China, the region and the </p>
<p>r. X~ f L V to L V aIV..<br />
-8-<br />
( PM Cant) world that the processes of economic reform be allowed<br />
to continue within China, and that that is not only intrinsically<br />
obviously correct, but we also share the view that it is only<br />
with the effect of further economic reform proceeding that you<br />
will have the environment within which there will able to be a<br />
flourishing of the pressures for political reform within China.<br />
Arnd so what we believe we have to do, and the rest of the world<br />
has to do, is to walk what is, admittedly, a very difficult<br />
dividing line. You have to express your position without<br />
equivocation, of condemnation of what has happened. At the same<br />
time make it clear that you want to do what can be done to assist<br />
the processes of economic reform. The interests of the people of<br />
China, and particularly those people within China who are<br />
committed to political reform will be very adversely affected if,<br />
by the action of the rest of the world, China was forced<br />
* ompletely to turn in upon itself, because the processcs of<br />
economic reform would be diminished, anid therefore the<br />
opportunity subsequently at some time for political reform. And<br />
so that is going to require a delicacy of decision and, of<br />
course, very considerable difficulties would be created in<br />
pursuing and walking that line if in the near future there were<br />
in fact to be executions of the student leaders. To this point,<br />
that basically hasn't occurred; the two categories are those who<br />
were involved with the train incident in Shanghai and workers<br />
representatives. if the Chinese leadership were in fact to pursue<br />
the leaders of the students, there were to be further executions<br />
in that area, then it would make the walking of this sort of line<br />
that the President and I agree on extremely difficult. It's our<br />
profound hope, the President and myself, that those who now have<br />
the responaibility for leading China both recognise the ultimate<br />
futility of what they have done, and more importantly for the<br />
future will recognise that if in fact they are to be able to do<br />
what they said an the 24th they wanted to do, that is to continue<br />
~ he process of economic reform and have opening up to the rest of<br />
Uhe world, that that will only be facilitated if they eschew<br />
further violence, persecution and certainly execution of people<br />
within their country.<br />
JOURNALIST: should Great Britain re-examine its agreement to<br />
relinquish control over Hong kong, in view of the recent events<br />
in China?<br />
PH: Well again, I don't presume to tell Great Britain what they<br />
should do, but I've had the great good fortune, at the end of<br />
last week and quite a bit of last week, to have extensive<br />
discussions with Mrs Thatcher, and may I say that in expressing<br />
as I did just a moment ago the views of the President and myself,<br />
I think it's fair to say that those views reflect also those of<br />
the leadership of France, with whom I was speaking earlier, and<br />
of Mrs Thatcher. We are at one in our perceptions in this matter,<br />
and I don't believe that Mrs Thatcher is taking the view that is<br />
appropriate to attempt to undo the negotiations that have<br />
occurred. Having said that, she has a very deep sense of concern<br />
about the future of the citizens of Hong Kong, and they have gone<br />
to great lengths and difficulties to negotiate with the<br />
authorities in China to get the basis of the post-1997<br />
transition, and it is, I think I've put it correctly, to say that<br />
r KUM P, V </p>
<p>PPK UM 9 I<br />
-9M<br />
( PM: cant) it's Mrs Thatcher's hope that the sort of processes to<br />
which I've been referring for the immediate future will turn out<br />
in a way to which they will be able to adhere to the arrangements<br />
that they have already made with the Government of China.<br />
JOUR~ NALIST: Do you anticipate a large influx of people and money<br />
from Hong kong as the deadline for return approaches?<br />
P14: Well how many people will come from Hong Kong will depond on<br />
our decision, and we of course can approach this issue generally<br />
with the very cleanest of hands and the very beat of records,<br />
because in regard to that region, the fact is that we have taken<br />
more refugees from Indochina per capita than any other country in<br />
the world, including the United States. We've taken 118 000<br />
refugees from Indochina since 1975, so Australia is a country<br />
with a record of compassion and concern for the people of this<br />
* ion. May I interpolate to say that of course in regard to the<br />
nflux of people into Hong Kong from Kampuchea, that we're faced<br />
now with a quite different situation. They are no longer<br />
essentially political refugees, they are economic refugees, and<br />
let me make it clear that as far as we're concerned, we said so<br />
at the international conference on Indochina Refugees in Geneva<br />
earlier this month, that where you're dealing with economic<br />
refugees, as is overwhelmingly the characteristics of the people<br />
going from Vietnam into Hong K( ong now, they are economic refugees<br />
and there is no corresponding obligation on the rest of the world<br />
to accept them as there is in the case of political refugees. Now<br />
in regard, therefore, to that component of people in Hong Kong<br />
which represent this influx from Vietnam, in regard to the people<br />
of Hong Kong itself, where there is a legitimate case for<br />
considering their trying to come to our country they will be<br />
sympathetically considered within our overall immigration<br />
program, which has a significant component for refugees and<br />
humanitarian considerations. As far as business people from Hong<br />
~ ng are concerned, one of the components of out immigration<br />
Wogramme is a Bus iness Migration Programme, and under that<br />
programme we've already had a very significant influx of people<br />
from Hong Kong. So, those components of our programme, the<br />
Business migration Programme and the refugee component, will be<br />
utilised to allow to come into Australia significant numbers from<br />
that area.<br />
JOURNALIST: Switching gears again, what in your view of the<br />
Australian Broadcasting Tribunal's decision yesterday to declare<br />
Mr Alan Bond unfit to hold a television station licence?<br />
PM: Well it's an ambitious question. Ambitious in the sense that<br />
the matter is obviously sub-i udice. what has happened is that the<br />
Australian Broadcasting Tribunal has, as you properly say, found<br />
that Alan Bond is an unfit person to hold a licence. But what<br />
they have now said is that they've referred the matter to Federal<br />
Court f or a decision for decision in regard to penalty. it must<br />
be obvious that in those circumstances of being sub-judice it's<br />
quite improper for me to make any commnent. </p>
<p>M( U ; d. Iwb 191eoP .1 IJOURNALISTs<br />
Do you see any improvement in the South African<br />
situation, and do you favour continued economic sanctions against<br />
South Africa?<br />
Pt~ i The situation in South Africa is one which I think needs very<br />
careful analysis at the moment, because there are going to be<br />
lots of arguments and pressures both ways in the rest of the<br />
world as to what should be done to increase or not to increase<br />
pressure upon South Africa. And I would say to those wit~ hin this<br />
country who are going to be considering this issue that they<br />
should take very considerable account of some recent commnents<br />
that have been made by influential figures in South Africa. For<br />
those who in this country or anywhere else argue that pressures<br />
upon South Africa have had no influence, they ignore the facts,<br />
idit ' s about time they stopped ignoring the facts. In two<br />
Itatements recently, firstly I refer to the statement on the<br />
of May by Mr De Kierk, who is the Governor of the Reserve Bank of<br />
South Africa, and his statement was very explicit. H~ e said that<br />
there warn no hope of South Africa sustaining viable economic<br />
growth, no hope of them sustaining viable economic growth in<br />
South Africa, unless there was fundamental political reform in<br />
that country. And this, as he said, was the result of the<br />
financial pressures that have been applied to South Africa. And<br />
on the 9th of May, De Plessis, the Finance minister, made exactly<br />
the samne sort of considerations. Hie said that as a result of the<br />
financial pressures on South Africa, that South Africa could not<br />
sustain its existing standards, and there would have to be the<br />
imposition of very significant austerity measures. So, if the<br />
governor of the Reserve Bank and the Finance Minister of South<br />
Africa are both saying, that an a result of what the world has<br />
done, this is the impact upon them and that they can't survive<br />
with their existing standards and expectations unlearn they reform<br />
how muily it-jj fnr Aflvfifl oIRA to bet saying, " well, pressures<br />
Sven't had any effect." Now the important thing therefore, I<br />
alieve is to recognize that with the change of leadership there,<br />
that there may be some hope. And now for a different approach.<br />
Never at any stage have I or the Australian government taken a<br />
view that we take any pleasure at all from sanctions an such.<br />
And I imagine that those who are responsible<br />
for the 1986 Anti-Apartheid Act here, and the Rangel Tax<br />
Amendment here, and to that legislation, none of those people<br />
would have been saying, we want to impose sanctions for the sake<br />
of sanctions. All we've been about is using sanction. and<br />
financial pressure as an instrument to get the regime of South<br />
Africa to the negotiating table, because what we must realise if<br />
we're talking about South Africa is one fundamental truth, that<br />
we are running out of time, if you're going to be dealing in<br />
terms of the blacks, if you're going to be dealing with those who<br />
want Lo retain the white influence in the economic area. The<br />
current leadership of the ANC, the current leadership of the<br />
front-line states, are quite explicit, they have been in<br />
conversation with me and with everyone else, they say, we don't<br />
want to see the whites expelled, we don't want to gs white<br />
capital, white expertise expelled, because they recognize that<br />
the future prosperity of a democratic, racially discriminatoryfree<br />
south Africa depends very very much upon keeping white<br />

( PM Cent) capital, white expertise, there in that country. They<br />
understand that, but they are running out of time with their own<br />
younger generation, who are saying, why are you adopting this<br />
attitude when we're getting no positive response. So I trust very<br />
very much Indeed that what will be done by the rest of the world<br />
is to keep up the pressure but to give this, the new leadership<br />
that's emerging in South Africa, the opportunity of responding,<br />
getting them to understand, getting them to understand that it is<br />
only by getting to the negotiating table in the near future that<br />
we are going to have the opportunity of a resolution of the<br />
conflict in South Africa in a bloodless way. It will, an I've<br />
said on many occasions, be resolved in one way or the other, but<br />
the time, I believe, is running out, where it can be done in a<br />
congenial and bloodless way. The pressure that the world,<br />
including the United States, has put upon South Africa has, in<br />
the words of these two people, the Governor of the Reserve Blank,<br />
tpMinister for Finance, its had its impact. Time now to keep<br />
tup, not to try and, as I've said before, to bring them to<br />
their knees but to bring them to the table, and I hope that<br />
together, both from within the Commnonwealth and with our friends<br />
in the United States and elsewhere, that that's the result that<br />
we can get.<br />
JOURNALIST: Before asking my final question, I'd like to present<br />
you with a Press Club Certificate of Appreciation, and also as a<br />
memento of your trip to the United States, the book " A Day in the<br />
Life of America".<br />
PM: Thank you very very much indeed.<br />
JOURNALIST; My final question is, when will Australian tennis<br />
prospects improve?<br />
PM: Well, I think I've, as you may have seen by now, I'm prepared<br />
to be fairly definite and dogmatic about most issues, but on this<br />
I can't be. But there's one very serious point that ought to<br />
W ade about this, it seems always to have escaped those who<br />
have tried profoundly to analyse movements in dominance in sport.<br />
Where Australia is concerned they say, why aren't we dominating<br />
in tennis? Why aren't we dominating swimmiing, as we used to in<br />
the post-war period? Well they're not very clever or intelligent<br />
in analysing this thing. We dominated in the post-war period in<br />
these things, tennis and swimming, because the rest of the world<br />
had gone through a bloody rough time during the war and before<br />
that, and here we were, a country which, of course we lost many<br />
of our young men, but our country hadn't suffered, and in that<br />
post-war period there we were, beautiful climate, plenty of food,<br />
everything in our favour, and the rest of the world recovering<br />
from devastation, and with allot of the world, the East not even<br />
knowing the rules of Lennis, let alone playing it. But as the<br />
world recovered from the devastation of the second World War, we<br />
more and more and more and more got onto a level playing field, </p>
<p>FROM r A I<br />

( PM Cont) where others had the same advantages as we did. Now,<br />
once that became the case, the capacity of a country of 16<br />
million people to dominate was very very significantly reduced.<br />
so we will continue to do well, but in a world where others,<br />
fortunately, have all the opportunities and advantages which were<br />
fairly exclusive or relatively exclusively ours, we will never<br />
again get that sort of dominance, and that's as it-should be.<br />
JOURNALIST: Thank you Prime Minister Hawke.<br />
