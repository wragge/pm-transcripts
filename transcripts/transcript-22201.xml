    <content><![CDATA[<p>Today, I am pleased to launch the Salvation Army's Red Shield Appeal for 2006. I urge all Australians to support this magnificent organisation and its tireless work.</p>
<p>The Australian Government will contribute $250,000 towards the Salvation Army 2006 Red Shield Appeal.</p>
<p>  Established in Australia more than 120 years ago, the Salvation Army has been tireless in the day-to-day support of disadvantaged Australians and in times of crisis such as Tropical Cyclone Larry in Far North Queensland.</p>
<p>Around 1.5 million Australians each year are assisted by the Salvation Army through emergency relief, individual and family support, aged care, assistance for the homeless and services related to alcohol, drug and gambling addiction.  Every week, the Salvation Army provides those in need with around 180,000 meals, 20,000 food vouchers and 3500 beds for people who are homeless.</p>
<p>  The Red Shield Appeal is the major fundraiser for the Salvation Army.  Since 1965, the Appeal has grown in size, with around $58 million raised in 2005.  Proceeds from the Appeal enable the Salvation Army to continue assisting Australian families and strengthening our community.</p>
<p>  During the Red Shield Appeal doorknock between 27 May and 4 June 2006, thousands of volunteers will aim to knock on every door in Australia.  The support from volunteers is an indication of the community's regard for the Salvation Army.</p>
<p>I thank the Salvation Army for their great service to the Australian community and I encourage all Australians to support the Red Shield Appeal.</p>
