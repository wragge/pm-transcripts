PRIME MINISTER Press Statement No. 467<br />
11 March 1975<br />
ADJUSTMENT ASSISTANCE FOR FRUIT JUICE<br />
PROCESSORS<br />
The Government has decided to pay structural<br />
adjustment assistance to fruit juice processors<br />
affected by the removal of the exemption'from sales tax<br />
of aerated waters containing less than 5 per cent<br />
Australian fruit juice.<br />
The exemption had encouraged soft drink<br />
producers to include 5 per cent of fruit juice in<br />
their products to escape sales tax.<br />
The compensation will cover plant made redundant,<br />
and stocks, and is expected to amount to about $ 1.5 million.<br />
