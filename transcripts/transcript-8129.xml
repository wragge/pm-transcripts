TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCE, NEW TAKANAWA PRINCE HOTEL,<br />
TOKYO -17 SEPTEMBER 1990<br />
E OE -PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: So what does it look like,<br />
PH: Well one of the things that's impressed me very much is<br />
there is absolutely no knocking of Melbourne, which is a<br />
good basis. It's a great reflection, I believe, on the team<br />
that has been led by John Ralph. They've been very positive<br />
in their presentation but they haven't been knocking other<br />
candidates. We've acknowledged the virtues of other cities<br />
that are trying to get the nomination. But they have been<br />
concentrating on the intrinsic merits of Melbourne and ' I<br />
think that seems to me to be paying of f in the reaction of<br />
others. I think, as I've said from the beginning, as you<br />
know, that if it's decided on the intrinsic merits I think<br />
Melbourne must have a second to none chance.<br />
JOURNALIST: Will you be a part of the presentation tomorrow<br />
and if so what will you be saying? We're from Atlanta.<br />
PM: Ok. The answer to the first part of your question is<br />
yes and the answer to your second question is I'm not a<br />
sucker.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, the Greeks are offering I think a<br />
three day to trip to everyone around the Greek Islands as an<br />
incentive. Are you inclined to offer them a holiday on the<br />
Gold Coast if they take the Melbourne<br />
PM: What about the Barrier Reef?<br />
JOURNALIST: Is this on the agenda this sort of I won't<br />
say bribery but<br />
JOURNALIST: Greeks bearing gifts.<br />
PM: You're saying beware of the Greeks bearing gifts. No,<br />
no, no. What we are doing which I think is very relevant to<br />
the Olympic spirit is in terms of travel and accommodation.<br />
We are offering a deal whereby for the first 100 athletes<br />
and officials of each country at US$ 350 per person then<br />
we'll cover the travel and accommodation. That's not a<br />
gimmick. I think it's a very realistic offer because one of<br />
the problems that's suggested about Australia is the<br />
distance. It is for so many. And that is a legitimate </p>
<p>concern for many so that offer is directed towards that<br />
concern. JOURNALIST: Is there a concern that some of the other<br />
countries are doing the hard sell, like Athens<br />
PM: I'm not here and I won't at any stage knock any other<br />
competitor. Each city goes about pushing their bid in the<br />
way that they think is appropriate. That's for them to<br />
decide. You won't hear me or I think you won't hear any<br />
Australian here knocking any other competitor. I think<br />
every competitor is sincere and each one has got some<br />
merits. I just believe that Australia's task is to sell its<br />
bid on the basis of its merits and not to knock anyone else.<br />
JOURNALIST: How much do you think Australia's softly softly<br />
approach is impressing the delegates?<br />
PM: I've been told that it is impressed. They've been<br />
impressed about the way in which we've just quietly not said<br />
vote for Melbourne, vote for Melbourne but giving them<br />
information as to the merits of Melbourne. I think that's<br />
the way to go.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, what odds would you offer on<br />
that? PM: As you know I'm a punter and I always like to study the<br />
form right up until the last minute before I place my bets.<br />
I've still got a lot of form studying to do.<br />
JOURNALIST: Hellenic, the favourite, came second in the<br />
English St Leger classic at the weekend. Do you think we<br />
should see that as an omen?<br />
PM: I suppose we're always prepared to see anything in the<br />
races or the tea-leaves or whatever. But as I say, we're in<br />
there on our merits.<br />
JOURNALIST: You were speaking to the Greek delegates in<br />
there a moment ago. Could you tell us what you said to<br />
them? PM: Well yes, and I can tell you what they said to me.<br />
Firstly I said you should feel that if Melbourne does<br />
triumph that Greece should have a real feeling of<br />
association because I said Melbourne is the third largest<br />
Greek city in the world, which is true. They appreciated<br />
that and very interestingly they said this. They said if<br />
Melbourne wins we'll feel less bitterness than if anyone<br />
else does. That's very very significant.<br />
JOURNALIST: Why is that significant?<br />
PM: Well I mean I think it sort of indicates, you know,<br />
they feel very strongly about the centenary aspect of the<br />
bid and one can understand that argument. I think the fact<br />
that they acknowledge that feeling about Melbourne is, I </p>
<p>3<br />
think it just indicates that the country that many regard as<br />
the sentimental favourite, if they have that feeling towards<br />
us it's helpful I think.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, we couldn't let you go without<br />
commenting on a couple of sporting events over the weekend.<br />
PH: Yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: I know there's a London rule against this sort<br />
of thing.<br />
PM: It's flexible when it comes to sport.<br />
JOURNALIST: Thank you. Can we ask you how you feel about<br />
Wayne Gardiner's victory and the Raiders?<br />
PM: Fantastic for Wayne Gardiner. I've had the opportunity<br />
of meeting and knowing Wayne over a fair bit of time and his<br />
lovely wife Donna. They've been into my office. I have<br />
great respect for him not just as a sportsman but as an<br />
Australian ambassador. It was thrilling to see him get back<br />
to back victories in the Phillip Island Grand Prix and for<br />
Australia to take of f the quinella was fantastic. Now the<br />
Raiders, you know, a great achievement. Quite seriously,<br />
for a Canberra club to be in the three grand finals is a<br />
tremendous tribute to all who are associated with the club.<br />
Of course if they could pull of f the three premierships<br />
would be fantastic.<br />
JOURNALIST: What's the chance of that do you think?<br />
PM: The trifecta?<br />
JOURNALIST: I meant the Raiders victory in the major grand<br />
final. PM: I think they'll win. I've been tipping them all year<br />
so they must.<br />
PM: Prime Minister, the Sydney Morning Herald said this<br />
morning that you changed your position on the invasion of<br />
Panama PM: Could you explain this, the London convention to the<br />
gentleman. JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: Those who've been around longer, I mean, will you just<br />
explain the London convention to him mate.<br />
JOURNALIST: it was a declaration.<br />
