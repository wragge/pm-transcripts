BUNDABERG IRRIGATION PROJECT<br />
The Commonwealth is prepared to join with the Queensland<br />
Government in financing the completion of the Bundaberg<br />
Irrigation Scheme over the next eight years.<br />
I have written to the Queensland Premier to advise him that,<br />
based on the present estimatei. cost of. completion of $ 80 million,<br />
the Commonwealth is prepared to provide $ 4 million in each of the<br />
next eight years provided the Queensland Govermnent provides<br />
$ 6 million each year.<br />
Mr Bjelke-Petersen has advised me that the Queensland Government<br />
is very appreciative of this offer. He has asked that<br />
Commonwealth and State officials discuss this proposal before<br />
he gives a commitment. I have asked Conunonwealth officials<br />
to arrange discussions as soon as possible so that both<br />
Governments are able to arrive at an early decision in<br />
relation to this important project.<br />
In 1978-79, under the National Water Resources Program, the<br />
Commonwealth Government allocated $ 2.5' million to Queensland<br />
for the project the largest allocation for a rural water<br />
supply project. In the current financial year a similar<br />
allocation of $ 2.5 million was also made. In total, the<br />
Commonwealth has provided grants to Queensland amounting to<br />
$ 24.65 million for the project. 000---</p>
