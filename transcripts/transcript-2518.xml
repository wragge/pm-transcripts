PRESS BRIEFING GIVEN BY THE PRIME MINISTER,<br />
MR WILLIAM McMAHON TO HEADS OF BUREAUX IN<br />
THE PARLIAMENTARY PRESS GALLERY,<br />
CANBERRA 26 JANUARY 1972<br />
PRIME MINISTER Just before Christmas, David Solomon asked me<br />
' if I would have a meeting of the Press Gallery to give them<br />
a briefing on those papers that had been considered by<br />
Cabinet and to which I could give a press release. And I<br />
said I would do my best to meet the wishes of the Gallery.<br />
This is the first attempt. We have sat until rather late<br />
0 this afternoon, so it took a pretty substantial effort to<br />
try and get these three statements out for you, but I have<br />
done it. And I arranged with David that I would give<br />
you the press release I regret that I haven't begn able to<br />
give you as much time to read through and chew over it as<br />
I would have liked; and that there would be a briefing<br />
relating to these press releases, but not to be a general<br />
cross-examination, relating to my tortious activities in the<br />
past I was going to use the word " criminal" but I bit<br />
my tongue just in time!<br />
So I have now given them to you and I thought if<br />
you~ liked, the one that probably had -the greatest interest<br />
for you is this one relating to war-time Government papers.<br />
The statement is there and I think you bill agree that we have<br />
now adopted a practice that is much the same as the British<br />
practice in other words, the thirty years' access rule<br />
will apply. We are making the rule apply to the War Gbinet<br />
itself, the Advisory War Council and the Production Executive<br />
as well as Cabinet documents that come within the thirty-year<br />
period. I mention, too, that there are some papers that we<br />
will have to look at, and I think you will find that what<br />
I have said closely follows the British practice of protecting<br />
specially sensitive papers, documents containing information<br />
supplied in confidence and documents containing information<br />
about individuals. Now we have one problem, and that is and I have<br />
set it out here that for some time we didn't keep archives<br />
in the same way as other countries have done, and now that </p>
<p>2.<br />
we are building up the archives themselves, we will find.<br />
that we haven't got at the moment sufficient personnel<br />
to process the papers, to be able to make them available<br />
quickly. So I will take it up with the Public Service Board<br />
I gave instructions that the matter was to be taken up<br />
urgently with'the Public Service Board to proiide staff to<br />
permit it to be done. I believe round about twenty will<br />
be asked for and probably agreed. But uttil we get the<br />
staff recruited and trained, we will borrow them from<br />
other Departments and get temporary officers, particularly<br />
retired persons, and if necessary from the university.<br />
The only other matter that I think I should<br />
specifically refer to is that while the War Cabinet papers,<br />
War Council and Production Executive papers have been to a<br />
large extent kept and they are indexed and I believe can be<br />
pretty quickly processed, the others will take a considerable<br />
period of time and therefore we will probably have to do it<br />
in groups. I think that sets out the matter as best I can<br />
in a short compass, but I have got the officer of the<br />
Department, Mr Keith Sinclair, who has done a lot of work<br />
on it since I first-gave them the instructions to work on<br />
it, so if. you want to ask any questions, I'll answer them.<br />
IfI ha ven't got the information imm~ ediately avaiable I'll<br />
get Peter to do it for me.<br />
~ Q. I was just wondering why the seleiction of 1941<br />
will this be the change of Government 1939-41? Why select<br />
that period, and not year by year?<br />
PM: For what purpose?<br />
Q. t ell the firtt ones going to be released are 1939-41<br />
and the others will be separately.. do the 39-41 ones only<br />
deal with a Labor Government came in or<br />
PM: No, it was just because it was the first three years.<br />
1939 was the year the war started and it was the first one,<br />
and 39-41 the first years as a group that we can handle as<br />
possible, and we want to get them out in groups. We feel<br />
this could be done expeditiously. / 3 </p>
<p>3.<br />
Q. Whose responsibility will it be to decide the<br />
number of exceptions, what is an exceptionally sensitive<br />
paper7? This is obviously a matter of opinion very often.<br />
Will there be one officer who makes that decision that a<br />
particular paper or document is a sensitive one? Will it<br />
be yourself, or will you allocate that responsibility to a<br />
Minister?<br />
PM: All of this will now be handed over to the Department<br />
of the Environment..<br />
iIt will be open to Mr Howson to<br />
PM: No, I will lay down the rules, but I think youcan<br />
take it that in the archives themselves, that is the section<br />
dealing with the archives we will ap~ oint a fairly senior<br />
person to look at the documents to see whether or not they<br />
come within the exception provisions. And if they feel that/ they<br />
are in any doubt, any seiious doubt about it, they can refer<br />
it through Department of Environxnentlo myself.<br />
Q. Sir, would you elaborate a bit more on this officer<br />
I am a bit concerned about who will decide whether they<br />
are contrary to the public interest or.. security. Will this be<br />
an of~ icer that you7 are going to appoint or will it be an<br />
officer that you have already in mind?<br />
Well I have got one in mind, yes, but I have not yet<br />
decided whether I will get a panel of names and then ask one<br />
of the people in the panel whether he will take over the<br />
responsibility. It will be a very senior person.<br />
It will be one person?<br />
PM: I am not sure of that either, but it looks as though<br />
it will be one person.<br />
Q. will it be a public servant or<br />
PM: An ex-public servant, I think. A public servant, or<br />
ex-public servant. / 4 </p>
<p>Q PM:<br />
O PM: Will he make any recommendation to you or Cabinet?<br />
No, he will get his charter, he will get his terms<br />
of reference, but in cases where he feels doubt-, he can<br />
refer it to me though the Departmen't of the Environment.<br />
PrimeMinister, interest in these documents was<br />
sparked by the release of particular documents by the<br />
British Cabinet relating to the exchange between Prime<br />
Minister Curtin and Prime Minister Churchill over the<br />
re-posting of the Australian Forces. Haven't you felt<br />
that it might be fairer to get those documents brought out<br />
first rather than some time in the future, as they won't be<br />
covered by the first release?<br />
I don't know whether it will be fairer or not<br />
because. I haven't read the papers and I don't know what<br />
is in them. I know they are a massive lot of documents<br />
and if I start picking and choosing, I think you will<br />
find we will get into a mess, But nonetheless, if a<br />
person comes along and has a special requirement, it could<br />
thebne reerred to me and I will then make a deci-ion<br />
whether. it should be looked at specially. I think this is<br />
the way. I wanted to look at it whe-n the paper was being<br />
prepared. Could" 1 just say this to you, I want to assure<br />
you that there is a mass of documents. How many feet of<br />
paper there, Peter?<br />
MR BAILEY One hundred feet of. War Caloinet papers, solid papers.<br />
And that doesn 6t mean fileEv, it means individual papers.<br />
One hundred feet tall J. f you like, yes.<br />
And then volume, what is the volume?<br />
PM: That is the volume, one hundred feet tall.<br />
MR BAILEY That is foolscap. And similarly with the Cabinet<br />
papers. There is something like another twenty feet not<br />
as much.<br />
Q. Has the Leader of the opposition been consulted, or<br />
will his consent be required for any of the documents<br />
concerning the time the Labor Government was in power.? ( o&amp; </p>
<p>PM: Well, he has already sent a message that he would<br />
be willing to do this. Of course he will be informed of this<br />
decision, and in sensitive cases relating to the Labor<br />
Government, of course he will be consulted.<br />
Q. You meptioned that this will happen as soon as<br />
possible, Prime Minister. Is it possible to put a more,<br />
definite..?<br />
PM: No, I can't.<br />
Q. Could you say weeks or months?<br />
PM: No, I can't do that. Unless, Peter, you can give<br />
some guidance on it. All I wanted ' to do was to get the<br />
decisions out because this is what I can do as a Pr'ime<br />
Minister. As to the details of the administration, I have got<br />
to leave it to the Department of-* the Environment, but they<br />
know they have got to act quickly.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, Sir John McEwin, when he was in<br />
the Cabinet when the Cabinet previously discussed the release<br />
of. Departmental papers, I understand made a specific proviso<br />
on'documents relating to the Country Party...<br />
PM: Not so far as I am aware. Certainly it isn't in the<br />
records.<br />
Q. There is nothing of that nature that would preclude<br />
any individual particular Party..<br />
PM. No0.<br />
Q. When they do become available, what form can we as<br />
journalists... . will we be able to2'? n and pore over them as<br />
PM:. Well they are to be made available generally. We<br />
thought primarily it would be for the purpose of scholars,<br />
but certainly the newspapers will have access to them. / 6 </p>
<p>6.<br />
MR BAILEY There will be a difference, PrimeMinister, between<br />
the Cabinet papers which will be put in order before they are<br />
released, as it were, so there will be pretty quick access to<br />
those. The vast number of documents that the Archives Office<br />
has from all Departments occupy acres and acres of space, so<br />
they can't do th~ t as quickly, but they will be trying to.<br />
So this is why the Government has said they want the extra<br />
staff to get those papers in more order from the middle of<br />
the year. They won't be for immediate access. It's not<br />
possible for them.<br />
M: Look, I can simplify this by say'ing that the Department<br />
of the Environment know how urgent it is and so do my own<br />
people in the Cabinet Secretariat, and they will be doing all<br />
they can to make them available as soon as they can.,<br />
Q. In future now that the thirty-year access rule will<br />
apply to Cabinet papers, will they * be made available each<br />
year on the 1st of January or will there be a batch made<br />
available every couple of years?<br />
SM: Oh, I think you will have to leave that. I haven't<br />
considered it. I don't regard it as relvant. The main thing<br />
is to get these War Cabinet papers out and the Advisory War<br />
Council. I think this is what the public wants and I think this<br />
is what the media and the scholars want.<br />
Q. One point has been made in the past and that is the<br />
man in charge of the Archives is a middle level Third Division<br />
officer, and a Class 8. And it has been put to me that nothing<br />
very much Will happen until that position is made into a Second<br />
Division position.<br />
PM: Well he is an Assistant Secretary level, but what you<br />
are asking me now is something relevant to the principles<br />
involved here, not the techniques. We will be expanding the<br />
Department as I said. The fellow who is head of it now is<br />
at FI". rst Assislnt Secretary level.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, could I ask you why it has taken so<br />
long for us to make this decision to release the documents? </p>
<p>PM: Q.<br />
PM:<br />
Q. PM: I am not prepared to answer that sort of a question<br />
as to whether I have been informed or whether I have been<br />
con~ sulted because if it so happens that the President would<br />
be willing to give advance information to myself, and I make<br />
it public, then it could cause great inconvenience to him and<br />
in time I would be very certain I wouldn't be getting information.<br />
I mention that as a philosophical matter rather than mention<br />
specific details. Perhaps I can say this to you that since<br />
Dr Kissinger's visit to Peking, I believe that I could not under<br />
any circumstances feel that there was a ground on which the<br />
Australian-Governivnt could complain because of our treatment<br />
by the Ame~ rican Administration. But I will not in future, if I<br />
am asked a question ' Were you consulted", I will not unless there<br />
are special circumstances, give an answer because I don't want<br />
to dry up our sources of information.<br />
As our own forces are involved, I would think the public<br />
would assume we would be consulted if our own forces are going<br />
to be kept in Vietnam or<br />
I thought it was done fairly quickly.<br />
Well there has been considerable pressure, as you have<br />
no doubt been aware, from various sources that these things<br />
should be released<br />
This is,' the first Cabinet that we have had in the New<br />
Year and it was decided during the two days that the Gbinet<br />
met. Could it not have been decided by you?<br />
It could have been, yes, I prepared the paper for it<br />
and put it up to Cabinet and it was accepted, but it was one<br />
that needed to go to Cabinet, and in any event, the delay is<br />
not that great. It would have at the most have been a week.<br />
Can I switch on to the President Nixon annonncement?<br />
What consultations have you had with the President on the<br />
announcement he made?<br />
Q. PM: LtI 11<br />
106 </p>
<p>joB<br />
8.<br />
PM: Well, I think you can see mnere that I have actually<br />
put in this statement that our own forces would be withdrawn<br />
if the agreement is made, then it would cover our forces too.<br />
Q. That is why I assumed the Australian Government would<br />
tell the Presiden , t of the United States it agrees with that,<br />
that is why I was getting at consultations<br />
PM: Well I will go this far. I will assure you that our<br />
forces will be withdrawn. And that is our decision. We don't<br />
depend on the United States or anyone else to tell us what we<br />
should or should not do. We make the decisions ourselves.<br />
Q. One base point about President Nixon's speech today<br />
was that Dr Kissinger originally provided this eight-point<br />
plan way back in October 1969. 1 thi'nk the interest that Alan<br />
was asking on, and certainly what I am interested in is whether<br />
we were aware of the negotiating terms over that cDnsiderable<br />
period or whether we have just learnt the negotiating terms<br />
just now.<br />
PM: I have told you I will go no further than I have gone.<br />
Q. * I am not asking about consultations. I am just asking<br />
about level of knowledge, if I can put it that way, Sir.<br />
PM: And if I say that to you, then it becomes perfectly<br />
obvious that I might have been one of the few who knew. Arnd<br />
I can assure you if I were to give any further information<br />
it could cause problems. And I think you know President Nixon<br />
has great problems associated zith the problem of secrecy, and<br />
I am sure of this that he trusts the Australian Government<br />
impl ic it Iy.<br />
Q. Sir, how would the decision that we have made that our<br />
troops would be withdrawn affect our decision to train the<br />
Cambodians and Vietnamese in this country?<br />
PM: It wouldn't affect them. / 9 </p>
<p>9.<br />
Q. That would still go on?<br />
PM: It would only . all it would affect is any<br />
decision that might be made about the training of South<br />
Vietnamese in South Vietnam.<br />
It wouldn't affect the decision that we have Mpade<br />
to train Cambodians here in Australia?<br />
PM: No, it would not. It is not within contemplation.<br />
That is something to be thought of later.<br />
Q. But that will continue?<br />
PM: I won't say it will continue. It is something that<br />
has to be considered at a later date.<br />
Q. Is it likely to be continued?<br />
PM" 1 It might or might not.<br />
Q. . Does that also apply to our supply of equipment<br />
, to Cambodia? Would that continue, too?<br />
PM: I haven't given the question of-. supply of equipment<br />
consideration, and to the best of my knowledge, it hasn't<br />
received consideratim. What has received consideration<br />
is what I have got in the document and that is the total<br />
withdrawal of forces.<br />
Q. Are you optimistic about any agreement from the<br />
other side?<br />
PM: If past experience is any criterion, and because<br />
I have been pretty well informed from diplomatic sources<br />
including my own Department, of initiatives that have been<br />
taken, and because I also participated in this other conference<br />
on Cambodia, I feel that the only statement that I could make<br />
is that if the North Vietnamese live up to their past<br />
practices and then the prospects are not what I would<br />
regard as very glowing. I hope they will. I sincerely. </p>
<p>hope they will, and on the conditions laid down by President<br />
Nixon, because I think we all want to see an end to these<br />
difficulties up there and we would like the South Vietnamese<br />
to have the opportunity to determine.... to have a vote to<br />
determine the kind of Government they want and to determine<br />
their own future, and that is why I specifically referred in<br />
this document to so:-Jething that has been very substance<br />
of the Australian Government's attitude to participation<br />
in Vietnam, when I referred in the fifth paragraph to various<br />
points in the Nixon statement, that coincides exactly with<br />
our own views. On the Army stataient, Prime Minister, just one<br />
thing. YoiII mention here " military district headquarters 6<br />
in ech State". Does this mean th~ t in places outside<br />
Sydney and Melbourre, for instance, Adelaide and Perth....<br />
in Sydney and Melbourne, too, there will<br />
be a District Headquarters in each State.<br />
How does this affect the overall organisation in<br />
terms of real estate and existing organisation there...<br />
in terms of property they hold<br />
It won't affect them to any great extent other<br />
than in Canberra and Melbournc. In Canberra, there will<br />
be a substantial reduction in the demands for real estate.<br />
In Melbourne there will be an increase in the demand for<br />
real estate. Have you got any details as to what extent...?<br />
No, but in Melbourne it will... . in Melbourne and<br />
Canberra it will be quite substantial the demand. But I<br />
want to emphasise to you thaLt so far as-units are consideredtraining<br />
or operational units are cancer e aif ted<br />
organisational matter dealing with the higher Command. And if<br />
I can now remind you, when I was Minister for Air a few vears<br />
ago, I carried out a similar kind of change in the Air Force<br />
and changed it from a lines of communication geographical<br />
system to a functional system, and as one who has had some ./ 11<br />
Q. PM: Q. PM: </p>
<p>some experience, too, in the war years of what we had to do to<br />
move away from a geographical system to a functional command<br />
and all the difficulties that persisted throughout the war,<br />
I am sure this is right.<br />
Q. Will the breakdown be such that one area becomes a<br />
training area, or one area a logistic area, or will the State<br />
Commands combine all of these things?<br />
PM: The command only will be in t'ie Sttte and the disposition<br />
of the units themselves will not be changed.<br />
PM: Now, I have been trying to get one or two other documents<br />
ready for you, but if I am not here tomorrow -and I hope I won't<br />
be -but at least I will get an officer I will have to get you,<br />
Peter, if you don't mind and you, Keith, if you are here, I will<br />
get you to come down and give a briefing to let you know about it.<br />
Q. Documents on what, Sir?<br />
PM: I didn't say! Look, I hope this is what you want.<br />
At least it is the way I cleared it with Dalr'd Solomon. I think<br />
I. Iill be able to say this to you in future that I will be trying<br />
to . when-a paper comes into Cabinet... I will be trying to<br />
get some sort of press release for you when it comes in and it<br />
can be suitably changed to meet the amendments that are made in<br />
Cabinet discussions, and recorded in the final decision. But<br />
at least this is a start. The second thing I want to do, and<br />
again this is because-David Solomon came down on behalf of the<br />
Gallery, is to see if we can , immediately after meetings of the<br />
Party, if I can give you half an hour's briefing on what happened<br />
there, certainly on those subjects that. are not too sensitive<br />
and I don't think there are any. But I willfake it up with the<br />
Party at its next meeting.<br />
Q. That would be most useful. Mr Whitlam, as you apprecizte<br />
does this, but not in things that are going into the Parliament<br />
in the future. I would hope it wouldn't preclude press conferences<br />
on general topics. ./ 12 </p>
<p>PM: No, but I don't want to mix the two up.<br />
The last two days we have made handled 15 or 18 decisions<br />
and you wouldn't be able to handle a press conference on<br />
the whole lot of them, but in any event, I will do what<br />
I can.<br />
Q. When do you think it will be likely we couldhave<br />
a full-scale press conference; I am thinking particularly<br />
of economic matters and other things that are of interest<br />
at this time...<br />
PM: Well, I will give that some thought and I will<br />
let the Secretarycf the Press Gallery know.<br />
THANKS.<br />
