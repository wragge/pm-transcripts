rUT4rK An~ ATNRT nR. VERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVUERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
PARLIAMENTARY RESOLUTION ON THE GULF CRISIS<br />
21 AUGUST 1990<br />
MR SPEAKER<br />
IN MOVING THIS RESOLUTION TODAY I WANT TO TAKE THIS FIRST<br />
OPPORTUNITY AVAILABLE TO ME TO INFORM THE HOUSE OF THE VIEW<br />
THE GOVERNMENT HAS TAKEN OF THE SITUATION WHICH HAS ARISEN<br />
IN THE MIDDLE EAST OVER THE PAST THREE WEEKS, AND OF THE<br />
MEASURES WHICH WE HAVE ADOPTED TO MEET THAT SITUATION.<br />
ON 2 AUGUST IRAQ INVADED KUWAIT. THAT ACTION HAS PROVOKED<br />
ONE OF THE GRAVEST INTERNATIONAL CRISES SINCE THE SECOND<br />
WORLD WAR; AND IT HAS CHALLENGED US TO DEFINE THE WAY IN<br />
WHICH THE WORLD COMMUNITY WILL COOPERATE IN THE YEARS AHEAD.<br />
OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS THE FRIGHTENING RIGIDITIES OF THE<br />
COLD WAR HAVE DISSOLVED, AND THE THREAT OF GLOBAL WAR<br />
BETWEEN THE SUPERPOWERS HAS RECEDED. THE TASK FOR ALL OF US<br />
HAS BEEN TO CONSTRUCT A NEW WORLD ORDER WHICH WILL GUARANTEE<br />
THAT THE END OF THE COLD WAR WILL BRING AN ERA OF PEACE.<br />
THAT CANNOT BE TAKEN FOR GRANTED. IN THE COLD WAR, REGIONAL<br />
CONFLICTS WERE CONTAINED BY THE CARE THAT EACH SUPERPOWER<br />
TOOK TO AVOID CONFRONTATION WITH THE OTHER. BUT NOW, AS THE<br />
THREAT OF GLOBAL WAR RECEDES, THE RISK OF MAJOR REGIONAL<br />
WARS MAY, PARADOXICALLY, HAVE INCREASED.<br />
IRAQ'S INVASION OF KUWAIT IS A TRAGICALLY CLEAR PROOF OF THE<br />
NEW DANGERS WHICH EXIST, JUST AS THOSE OF THE COLD WAR<br />
THANKFULLY FADE INTO HISTORY. AND THOSE DANGERS ARE NOT<br />
UNIQUE TO THE MIDDLE EAST. WHEREVER WE FIND BIG ARMIES,<br />
NATIONAL RIVALRIES AND RECKLESS LEADERS, WE WILL FIND A RISK<br />
OF MAJOR WAR. IT IS NOT INCONCEIVABLE THAT THOSE CONDITIONS<br />
COULD EMERGE IN THE ASIA-PACIFIC REGION IN THE COMING YEARS.<br />
WE NEED THEREFORE TO WORK OUT HOW TO MANAGE THESE DANGERS<br />
WHEREVER THEY MAY ARISE. IN DOING SO WE ARE CASTING BACK TO<br />
THE ERA BEFORE THE COLD WAR BEGAN; THOSE TWILIGHT YEARS OF<br />
OPTIMISM BETWEEN THE END OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR AND THE<br />
FALL OF THE IRON CURTAIN.<br />
WE FIND OURSELVES LOOKING AGAIN TO THE UNITED NATIONS TO<br />
UPHOLD THE RULE OF LAW AS THE PRINCIPLE OF INTERNATIONAL<br />
RELATIONS, OVER THE RULE OF FORCE. THE COLD WAR OFTEN MADE </p>
<p>THE UN LOOK IMPOTENT AND IRRELEVANT; BUT AS THE COLD WAR<br />
FADES, THE UN HAS MOVED BACK TO THE POSITION ITS FOUNDERS<br />
INTENDED FOR IT.<br />
IN DRAFTING THE UN CHARTER, THE FOUNDERS OF THE UN DREW ON<br />
THEIR VIVID AND BITTER EXPERIENCE OF A WORLD SLIDING INTO<br />
CHAOS: THE FAILURE OF THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS IN MANCHURIA<br />
AND ABYSSINIA; THE APPEASEMENT OF FASCISM IN EUROPE; AND<br />
THE CATASTROPHE THAT FOLLOWED.<br />
THE WORLD HAS CHANGED A LOT SINCE 1945, BUT I THINK THE<br />
LESSONS OF THE 1930' S, WHICH UNDERPIN THE UN CHARTER, STILL<br />
HOLD TRUE TODAY: THAT INTERNATIONAL DISPUTES MUST NOT BE<br />
SETTLED BY FORCE; THAT NATIONAL BORDERS MUST BE RESPECTED;<br />
AND THAT THOSE WHO USE FORCE MUST NOT BE PERMITTED TO<br />
PREVAIL. THOSE LESSONS ESTABLISH PRINCIPLES THAT ENGAGE OUR REAL,<br />
TANGIBLE INTERESTS, NOT JUST OUR SENSE OF RIGHT AND WRONG.<br />
THE SECURITY AND PROSPERITY OF THE WORLD, AND THE SECURITY<br />
AND PROSPERITY OF AUSTRALIA, WILL DEPEND IN THE YEARS AHEAD<br />
ON THE STRENGTH OF THOSE PRINCIPLES. AND THE STRENGTH OF<br />
THOSE PRINCIPLES IN THE YEARS AHEAD DEPENDS ABSOLUTELY ON<br />
THE SUPPORT WE GIVE THEM TODAY.<br />
THIS IS THE BROAD FRAMEWORK WITHIN WHICH THE GOVERNMENT HAS<br />
CONSIDERED IRAQ'S INVASION OF KUWAIT, AND AUSTRALIA'S<br />
RESPONSE. WITHIN THAT FRAMEWORK, MR SPEAKER, IRAQ'S ACTIONS ARE CAUSE<br />
FOR VERY DEEP CONCERN. THAT CONCERN ARISES FROM THE NATURE<br />
OF IRAQ'S LEADERSHIP, FROM THE CAPABILITIES OF ITS ARMED<br />
FORCES, AND FROM THE NATURE OF THE GULF REGION ITSELF.<br />
IRAQ'S GOVERNMENT HAS, OVER MANY YEARS, PROVED THAT IT IS<br />
WILLING AND EVEN EAGER TO USE ARMED FORCE TO ACHIEVE ITS<br />
NATIONAL GOALS; AND THAT THOSE GOALS ENCOMPASS NOTHING LESS<br />
THAN THE DOMINATION OF ALL ITS NEIGHBOURS IRANIAN AS WELL<br />
AS ARAB AND THE ACCUMULATION OF GREATER AND GREATER POWER<br />
AT THE EXPENSE OF THEM. ANY WHO DOUBT THAT ANALYSIS OF<br />
IRAQI INTENTIONS SHOULD ASK IRAQ'S NEIGHBOURS THEMSELVES, IN<br />
THE GULF AND IN THE MIDDLE EAST GENERALLY.<br />
BUT THE IRAQI GOVERNMENT'S AMBITION HAS BEEN MATCHED BY ITS<br />
RUTHLESSNESS INCLUDING TO ITS OWN CITIZENS. IN THE WAR<br />
WITH IRAN IT INFLICTED YEARS OF SUFFERING AND HUNDREDS OF<br />
-THOUSANDS-OF-CASUALTIES-ON--THE-PEOPLE OF IRAQ, FOR A FEW<br />
MILES OF GROUND THAT IT HAS NOW SURRENDERED. AND IN<br />
KURDISTAN THE IRAQI GOVERNMENT GASSED ITS OWN PEOPLE.<br />
BUT THE GOVERNMENT OF IRAQ IS NOT ONLY VERY RUTHLESS AND<br />
VERY AMBITIOUS; IT IS ALSO VERY POWERFUL. IT HAS ONE OF THE<br />
LARGEST ARMIES IN THE WORLD, WELL-EQUIPPED AND BATTLEHARDENED,<br />
AND A LARGE AIRFORCE. IT HAS A LARGE FORCE OF<br />
BALLISTIC MISSILES, A MASSIVE CHEMICAL ARSENAL, AND A<br />
PROGRAM TO DEVELOP NUCLEAR WEAPONS WITHIN A FEW YEARS. </p>
<p>3.<br />
THAT POWER IS BASED ON OIL. THE GULF REMAINS THE HUB OF THE<br />
WORLD OIL MARKET. IRAQ, KUWAIT AND SAUDI ARABIA ALONE HOLD<br />
NEARLY HALF OF THE WORLD'S OIL RESERVES. THAT IS A VERY<br />
IMPORTANT ASPECT OF THIS SITUATION, FOR TWO REASONS.<br />
THE FIRST IS THAT IRAQ'S POWER WOULD INCREASE DRAMATICALLY<br />
IF IT COULD CONTROL KUWAIT'S OIL ASSETS, AND EVEN MORE IF IT<br />
CONTROLLED SAUDI ARABIA'S. WITH INCREASING POWER WOULD COME<br />
INCREASING AMBITION, MAKING IRAQ EVEN MORE DANGEROUS THAN IT<br />
IS TODAY.<br />
THE SECOND IS THAT ANY NATION WHICH CONTROLLED THE OIL<br />
INDUSTRIES OF IRAQ, KUWAIT AND SAUDI ARABIA WOULD BE ABLE TO<br />
DICTATE OIL PRICES. THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT WHAT IRAQ'S<br />
PRICING POLICY WOULD BE; AND THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT WHAT THAT<br />
WOULD MEAN FOR THE WORLD'S ECONOMY AND FOR AUSTRALIA'S.<br />
WE MAY BE A NET ENERGY EXPORTER, BUT WE IMPORT OIL, AND THE<br />
MARKETS FOR OUR EXPORTS DEPEND ABSOLUTELY CRITICALLY ON THE<br />
ECONOMIES OF OUR CUSTOMERS.<br />
I DO NOT INTEND TO GO INTO THE MERITS OF IRAQ'S GRIEVANCES<br />
AGAINST KUWAIT, NOR OF ITS CLAIMS TO KUWAIT'S TERRITORY.<br />
THEY ARE IRRELEVANT TO THE CURRENT CASE; BECAUSE NO MATTER<br />
HOW STRONG THOSE CLAIMS MIGHT BE, THERE CAN BE NO<br />
JUSTIFICATION FOR ASSERTING THEM BY ARMED FORCE. AS I<br />
EMPHASISED TO THE IRAQI AMBASSADOR WHEN HE CALLED ON ME<br />
YESTERDAY, IF IRAQ DOES HAVE GRIEVANCES THEY SHOULD BE<br />
ADDRESSED THROUGH PROPER, INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNISED AND<br />
PEACEFUL PROCEDURES.<br />
MR SPEAKER, I WANT TO TURN NOW TO REVIEW THE STEPS TAKEN BY<br />
AUSTRALIA AND BY THE WORLD COMMUNITY TO MEET THE CHALLENGE<br />
POSED BY IRAQ'S ACTIONS. THE GOVERNMENT HAS CONDEMNED THE<br />
INVASION OF KUWAIT BY IRAQ IN THE MOST DIRECT TERMS. THE<br />
OPPOSITION HAS DONE THE SAME, AND I WELCOME THAT. I HOPE<br />
THAT THIS HOUSE, SPEAKING AS IT DOES IN A VERY SPECIAL WAY<br />
FOR ALL AUSTRALIANS, WILL EXPRESS ITS CONDEMNATION THROUGH<br />
THE RESOLUTION WE ARE PROPOSING.<br />
THE FACT THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF AUSTRALIANS AGREE IN<br />
CONDEMNING IRAQ'S INVASION IS IMPORTANT. BUT HOW MUCH MORE<br />
IMPORTANT IS IT THAT GOVERNMENTS AND PEOPLE ALL OVER THE<br />
WORLD HAVE FELT THE SAME CONCERN, AND EXPRESSED THE SAME<br />
CONDEMNATION? THATITAL.-CONSENSUS . HAS-BEEN-REFLECTED IN THE UN, WHERE THE<br />
SECURITY COUNCIL HAS NOT ONLY BEEN ABLE, PROMPTLY AND<br />
UNANIMOUSLY, TO PASS RESOLUTIONS CONDEMNING THE INVASION. IT<br />
HAS ALSO BEEN ABLE, FOR THE FIRST TIME, TO GO BEYOND THAT TO<br />
ADOPT MANDATORY AND COMPREHENSIVE ECONOMIC SANCTIONS<br />
DESIGNED TO COMPEL AN IRAQI WITHDRAWAL.<br />
AUSTRALIA IS COMMITTED TO IMPLEMENTING THOSE SANCTIONS WITH<br />
FULL RIGOUR. THAT WILL NOT BE WITHOUT COST; IRAQ HAS BEEN A<br />
MAJOR EXPORT MARKET FOR AUSTRALIA. BUT WE HAVE NO CHOICE;<br />
ECONOMIC SANCTIONS ARE AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE </p>
<p>4.<br />
INTERNATIONAL EFFORT TO RESTORE PEACE AND STABILITY TO THE<br />
MIDDLE EAST. THE ECONOMIC AND SECURITY COSTS OF SHIRKING<br />
THAT RESPONSIBILITY ARE MUCH GREATER THAN THE COSTS OF THE<br />
SANCTIONS THEMSELVES.<br />
BUT THE SANCTIONS WILL NOT DO THE JOB BY THEMSELVES. THEY<br />
WILL ACT, SLOWLY BUT SURELY, TO FORCE IRAQ TO GIVE UP<br />
KUWAIT. IN THE SHORT TERM, HOWEVER, THERE HAS BEEN AN<br />
URGENT NEED TO DETER IRAQ FROM TAKING EVEN MORE TERRITORY.<br />
IN THE DAYS AFTER ITS INVASION OF KUWAIT, IRAQ BUILT UP HUGE<br />
FORCES ON THE BORDER WITH SAUDI ARABIA. ALL THE EVIDENCE<br />
POINTED TO A PLAN TO INVADE SAUDI ARABIA AND SEIZE THE SAUDI<br />
OIL-FIELDS WHICH LIE CLOSE TO KUWAIT ON THE SHORES OF THE<br />
GULF. TO RESPOND TO THAT VERY RAPIDLY EMERGING THREAT, IT WAS<br />
NECESSARY TO ACT QUICKLY. AT THE REQUEST OF SAUDI ARABIA,<br />
THE US DEPLOYED FORCES SWIFTLY TO DETER FURTHER IRAQI<br />
AGGRESSION. AFTER AN HISTORIC MEETING OF THE ARAB SUMMIT<br />
OTHER ARAB STATES QUICKLY FOLLOWED, PROVIDING FORCES OF<br />
THEIR OWN TO HELP DEFEND SAUDI ARABIA FROM IRAQ, AND<br />
ENDORSING THE US CONTRIBUTION.<br />
THIS OPERATION APPEARS TO HAVE SUCCEEDED IN DETERRING AN<br />
IRAQI INVASION OF SAUDI ARABIA, AND THOSE INVOLVED DESERVE<br />
CREDIT FOR IT. I WANT TO BE ABSOLUTELY CLEAR ABOUT THIS IN<br />
THE ABSENCE OF SUCH ACTION I BELIEVE IT HIGHLY LIKELY THAT<br />
WE WOULD BE FACED NOW NOT WITH A MILITARY STAND-OFF, DEEPLY<br />
WORRYING AND DANGEROUS THOUGH THAT IS, BUT WITH ACTUAL<br />
HOSTILITIES; NOT TO MINCE WORDS WAR.<br />
AND THIS ACTION HAS THEREFORE PROVIDED A FRAMEWORK IN WHICH<br />
SANCTIONS CAN DO THEIR WORK. BUT TO BE EFFECTIVE THE<br />
SANCTIONS ALSO NEED TO BE ENFORCED. AND IT IS AT THIS POINT<br />
THAT I WANT NOW TO DESCRIBE THE DECISIONS MY GOVERNMENT HAS<br />
TAKEN IN DEPLOYING SHIPS OF THE RAN TO THE GULF REGION.<br />
MR SPEAKER, THIS HAS BEEN A VERY SERIOUS DECISION. I HAVE<br />
LEFT IT UP TILL THIS POINT IN MY STATEMENT TODAY BECAUSE I<br />
HAVE WANTED TO PLACE OUR DECISIONS IN THE CONTEXT IN WHICH<br />
WE MADE THEM; THAT IS, IN THE LIGHT OF OUR ASSESSMENTS OF<br />
THE BROADER INTERNATIONAL FRAMEWORK, OF THE PARTICULAR<br />
CHARACTERISTICS OF THE IRAQI REGIME AND OF THE GULF REGION,<br />
AND OF THE SIGNIFICANCE OF ALL OF THESE FOR AUSTRALIA.<br />
AUSTRALIA VALUES ITS ALLIANCES, BUT WE RECOGNISE THAT<br />
INCREASINGLY WE WILL HAVE TO LOOK TO OUR OWN SECURITY. AS A<br />
SELF-tRELIANT COUNTRY, WE MAY-NEED -TO. DEPEND MORE AND MORE IN<br />
THE YEARS AHEAD ON THE PRINCIPLES OF THE UN CHARTER TO<br />
PROTECT OUR INTERESTS. SO WE ARE NOT SENDING SHIPS TO THE<br />
GULF REGION TO SERVE OUR ALLIES; WE ARE GOING TO PROTECT THE<br />
INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW WHICH WILL BE VITAL TO OUR<br />
SECURITY, HOWEVER OUR ALLIANCES MAY DEVELOP IN THE FUTURE. </p>
<p>AFTER CAREFULLY ASSESSING AUSTRALIA'S INTERESTS, THE NATURE<br />
OF THE JOB TO BE DONE, AND OUR ABILITY TO DO IT, THE<br />
GOVERNMENT DECIDED TO DEPLOY TWO GUIDED MISSILE FRIGATES AND<br />
ONE REPLENISHMENT OILER TO PARTICIPATE IN THE ENFORCEMENT OF<br />
THE UN EMBARGO AGAINST IRAQ.<br />
MANY OTHER NATIONS HAVE REACHED OR ARE CONSIDERING THE SAME<br />
DECISION. SO FAR THE US, UK, FRANCE, CANADA AND THE<br />
NETHERLANDS HAVE ANNOUNCED THAT THEY WILL DEPLOY SHIPS TO<br />
ACT IN SUPPORT OF THE EMBARGO AGAINST IRAQ: WHILE ITALY,<br />
THE FRG, GREECE, SPAIN, BELGIUM AND PORTUGAL ARE CONSIDERING<br />
WHAT ROLE THEY CAN PLAY.<br />
IN JOINING THIS GROUP, AUSTRALIA IS ACTING WITHIN THE UN<br />
CHARTER TO ASSIST KUWAIT AT ITS SPECIFIC REQUEST TO<br />
EXERCISE ITS RIGHT OF SELF-DEFENCE, UNDER ARTICLE 51,<br />
THROUGH IMPLEMENTATION OF THE UN ECONOMIC SANCTIONS.<br />
LIKE MOST MEMBERS OF THE GROUP, AUSTRALIA BELIEVES THAT THE<br />
ESTABLISHMENT OF A UN FORCE ACTING UNDER THE UN FLAG AS<br />
PROVIDED FOR EXPLICITLY BY ARTICLE 42 OF THE UN CHARTER<br />
WOULD BE THE BEST FRAMEWORK FOR ENFORCEMENT OF THE UN'S<br />
ECONOMIC SANCTIONS, AND WE ARE WORKING HARD TO ACHIEVE THAT.<br />
THERE IS AS WELL A NUMBER OF ALTERNATIVE MECHANISMS<br />
AVAILABLE UNDER THE UN UMBRELLA TO ENHANCE DIRECT UN<br />
INVOLVEMENT IN THE OPERATION OF THE FORCE. THESE ARE BEING<br />
EXPLORED. BUT WE BELIEVE THAT THE INTERESTS OF THE UN<br />
ITSELF, AS WELL AS THE DYNAMICS OF THE SITUATION IN THE<br />
GULF, REQUIRE THAT WE WORK WITHIN THE VERY CLEAR LEGAL<br />
FRAMEWORK PROVIDED BY ARTICLE 51 UNTIL THESE ISSUES HAVE<br />
BEEN RESOLVED.<br />
WE BELIEVE THAT TO REFUSE TO PARTICIPATE UNLESS A FULLYFLEDGED<br />
UN FORCE WAS ESTABLISHED WOULD MAKE IT LESS LIKELY<br />
THAT SUCH A FORCE WOULD BE ESTABLISHED, AND MORE LIKELY THAT<br />
THE ECONOMIC SANCTIONS, AND THE UN ITSELF, WOULD FAIL IN<br />
MEETING IRAQ'S AGGRESSION.<br />
OUR SHIPS ARE BEING SENT TO THE GULF REGION WITH A CLEAR<br />
MISSION TO ASSIST IN ENFORCING ECONOMIC SANCTIONS. THE<br />
GOVERNMENT HAS DEFINED THE WAY IN WHICH OUR SHIPS WILL<br />
OPERATE IN FULFILLING THAT MISSION IDENTIFICATION,<br />
CONTACT, INTERROGATION AND WARNING AND DISCUSSIONS ARE NOW<br />
UNDER WAY WITH OTHER PARTICIPANTS TO ESTABLISH COORDINATION<br />
PROCEDURES AND AREAS OF OPERATIONS. THE OPERATIONAL ROLES<br />
OF OUR SHIPS WILL BE REVIEWED IF NECESSARY TO ENSURE THAT<br />
. THE'L. MEET . THE AIM OF. . THE DEPLOYMENT, BUT OUR DISCUSSIONS SO<br />
FAR HAVE CONFIRMED THAT THEIR CURRENT ROLES WILL ALLOW THEM<br />
TO FULFIL THEIR MISSION WITH A SENSIBLE MINIMUM OF FORCE.<br />
ANY CHANGE TO THE ROLE PROPOSED FOR THE AUSTRALIAN SHIPS<br />
WOULD NECESSARILY INVOLVE THE WIDEST POSSIBLE CONSULTATION.<br />
I SHOULD MAKE IT QUITE CLEAR HERE THAT OUR SHIPS ARE NOT<br />
BEING SENT TO THE GULF REGION TO ATTACK IRAQ. THEY WILL<br />
ENGAGE IRAQI ARMED FORCES ONLY IN SELF-DEFENCE. </p>
<p>6.<br />
OUR SHIPS ARE WELL-SUITED TO THE ROLE WE ARE ASKING THEM TO<br />
FULFIL. THEY ARE THE MOST MODERN SHIPS IN OUR FLEET,<br />
EQUIPPED WITH STATE-OF-THE-ART WEAPONS AND SENSOR SYSTEMS,<br />
AND MANNED BY CREWS THAT ARE AS GOOD AS ANY IN THE WORLD.<br />
THE SANE TYPE OF SHIPS ARE SERVING WITH THE US NAVY IN THE<br />
GULF REGION AT THE MOMENT, ON SIMILAR TASKS TO THOSE OUR<br />
SHIPS WILL PERFORM.<br />
NONETHELESS, WE MUST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE DEPLOYMENT OF<br />
SHIPS IS NOT WITHOUT DANGER, AND THIS HAS BEEN REFLECTED IN<br />
THE CONDITIONS OF SERVICE FOR PERSONNEL ON THE DEPLOYMENT<br />
WHICH WERE APPROVED BY CABINET LAST WEEK.<br />
APART FROM THIS DEPLOYMENT IN SUPPORT OF THE UN SANCTIONS,<br />
THE GOVERNMENT WILL CONTINUE TO PURSUE DIPLOMATIC APPROACHES<br />
TO THE PROBLEMS IN THE GULF. WE DO NOT SEEK CONFLICT<br />
ABSOLUTELY THE OPPOSITE. WE WILL SUPPORT ANY CONSTRUCTIVE<br />
DIPLOMATIC EFFORT TO RESOLVE THE CRISIS. BUT THAT CANNOT BE<br />
THROUGH TURNING A BLIND EYE TO AGGRESSION, AND IT CANNOT<br />
SUCCEED WITHOUT THE MAINTENANCE OF PRESSURE ON IRAQ. OUR<br />
FOREIGN MINISTER, SENATOR EVANS, WILL LEAVE TOMORROW FOR<br />
EUROPE WHERE HE WILL CONSULT THE CHAIRMAN OF THE EC BEFORE<br />
VISITING CAIRO, NEW YORK AND WASHINGTON FOR DISCUSSIONS ON<br />
THE CRISIS, RETURNING TO BRIEF CABINET BEFORE THE END OF<br />
NEXT WEEK.<br />
MR SPEAKER, IT IS OF COURSE DIFFICULT TO SAY HOW THE CRISIS<br />
IN THE GULF WILL DEVELOP FROM HERE. LOGIC SHOULD DICTATE<br />
THAT THE IRAQI REGIME RECOGNISING THAT IT HAS AROUSED THE<br />
ANGER OF THE WHOLE WORLD, THAT IT WILL NOT BE ALLOWED TO<br />
SUCCEED, AND THAT IT WILL PAY A HIGH PENALTY FOR ITS<br />
ADVENTURISM SHOULD WITHDRAW FROM KUWAIT AND ALLOW THE<br />
RESTORATION OF THE LEGITIMATE GOVERNMENT THERE. I EARNESTLY<br />
HOPE THAT THAT MIGHT HAPPEN, AND HAPPEN SOON. BUT THE<br />
BEHAVIOUR OF IRAQ'S GOVERNMENT GIVES NO GROUND FOR OPTIMISM.<br />
IN PARTICULAR, WE ARE ALL APPALLED BY THE ACTIONS OF IRAQ'S<br />
GOVERNMENT IN DETAINING FOREIGN NATIONALS INCLUDING<br />
AUSTRALIANS AGAINST THEIR WILL, AND IN PARTICULAR THE<br />
CONTEMPTIBLE PRACTICE OF PLACING THEM AS HUMAN SHIELDS<br />
AROUND IRAQ'S ARSENAL OF OFFENSIVE WEAPONS. IN THE LANGUAGE<br />
OF THE RESOLUTION, THIS IS AN OUTRAGE AGAINST ALL THE NORMS<br />
OF INTERNATIONAL LAW, INTERNATIONAL CONDUCT AND HUMAN<br />
DECENCY. ANY MISTREATMENT OF THESE PEOPLE WILL BE A STAIN<br />
ON IRAQ'S GOVERNMENT FOR EVER.<br />
ABOUT 150 AUSTRALIANS ARE AMONG THOSE BEING HELD IN IRAQ AND<br />
KUWAITAGAINST-THE-IR WILL. -THE-GOVERNMENT, THROUGH THE<br />
DEPARTMENT OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE AND IN COOPERATION<br />
WITH OUR FRIENDS, IS DOING ALL IT CAN TO HELP AND ADVISE<br />
THESE PEOPLE. WE CANNOT SIMPLY, BY SOME ACTION OF OUR OWN,<br />
RESTORE THEIR FREEDOM. BUT WE CAN AND WILL TAKE EVERY<br />
ACTION OPEN TO US CONSISTENT WITH OUR PRINCIPLES TO<br />
PERSUADE THE GOVERNMENT OF IRAQ TO DO SO.<br />
THE ONLY SOLUTION TO THE CRISIS CREATED BY IRAQ'S INVASION<br />
OF KUWAIT IS FOR IRAQ TO WITHDRAW FROM KUWAIT AND TO RELEASE<br />
ALL FOREIGN NATIONALS. WE HOPE THAT WILL HAPPEN, BUT WE </p>
<p>7.<br />
CANNOT ASSUME THAT IT WILL HAPPEN SOON. THE EMBARGO WILL<br />
TAKE TIME TO WORK. IT WOULD BE WRONG OF ME TO HOLD OUT HOPE<br />
OF AN EARLY BREAKTHROUGH. WHAT WE NEED IS CLARITY OF<br />
PURPOSE, AND FIRM RESOLVE.<br />
MR SPEAKER, BEFORE CONCLUDING I WANT TO MAKE IT PLAIN THAT<br />
WE DO NOT CONDEMN THE PEOPLE OF IRAQ. WE CONDEMN THE<br />
ACTIONS OF THEIR GOVERNMENT. THE PEOPLES OF AUSTRALIA AND<br />
IRAQ ARE NOT INHERENTLY HOSTILE TO EACH OTHER. THERE<br />
REMAINS AT THIS FUNDAMENTAL LEVEL THE BASIS FOR COOPERATION<br />
ONCE THE PRESENT CRISIS IS SATISFACTORILY RESOLVED. THE<br />
RESPONSIBILITY FOR RESOLVING THE CRISIS LIES TOTALLY IN THE<br />
HANDS OF THOSE WHO BROUGHT IT ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT OF<br />
IRAQ. THE LANGUAGE OF THE RESOLUTION WHICH I PROPOSE BE ADOPTED BY<br />
THE PARLIAMENT IS CRYSTAL CLEAR. IT EMBODIES IN PLAIN TERMS<br />
ALL THE ELEMENTS OF ATTITUDE AND APPROACH TO THE CRISIS<br />
WHICH I HAVE DESCRIBED AS BEING APPROPRIATE FOR AUSTRALIA.<br />
IT REFLECTS OUR CONVICTIONS AS A PEOPLE AND OUR INTERESTS AS<br />
A NATION.<br />
AUSTRALIA IS GEOGRAPHICALLY DISTANT FROM THE CRISIS. BUT<br />
OUR INTERESTS ARE REAL AND THEY ARE IMPORTANT. WE HAVE A<br />
REAL STAKE IN SUPPORTING PROPER NORMS OF INTERNATIONAL<br />
BEHAVIOUR BETWEEN NATIONS IN THE POST COLD WAR WORLD WHICH<br />
IS EMERGING. WE HAVE A REAL STAKE IN DOING WHAT WE CAN TO<br />
PREVENT THE MIDDLE EAST FROM BEING ENGULFED IN A WIDENING<br />
CONFLICT. WE HAVE A REAL STAKE IN THE AFFAIRS OF A REGION<br />
WHICH PROVIDES THE VAST BULK OF ONE OF THE COMMODITIES MOST<br />
VITAL TO THE HEALTH OF THE INTERNATIONAL ECONOMY.<br />
OUR POLICY MUST CONTINUE TO BE GOVERNED BY A CLEAR-HEADED<br />
RECOGNITION OF THOSE INTERESTS AND BY CAREFUL AND<br />
RESPONSIBLE CONSIDERATION OF THE MEANS OPEN TO US TO PROTECT<br />
THEM. THE ADOPTION BY THE PARLIAMENT OF THIS RESOLUTION<br />
WILL SEND A VALUABLE SIGNAL A SIGNAL OF CLARITY AND OF<br />
FIRMNESS IN AUSTRALIA'S ATTITUDE AND APPROACH TO THIS<br />
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT ISSUE. I COMMEND IT TO THE HOUSE. </p>
<p>PARLIAMENTARY RESOLUTION GULF COMMITMENT<br />
Mr Speaker<br />
I seek leave to move a motion in relation to recent events<br />
in the Middle East, precipitated by the Iraqi invasion of<br />
Kuwait. ( Leave granted]<br />
Mr Speaker<br />
I move that this House<br />
First, condemns<br />
the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq as contrary to<br />
international law and morality<br />
the threat posed to the territorial integrity of Saudi<br />
Arabia by Iraq's deployment of massive armed forces on<br />
the borders of Saudi Arabia<br />
the outrage to the norms of international law,<br />
international conduct and human decency of detaining<br />
foreign nationals including Australians against<br />
their will, and in particular the contemptible practice<br />
of placing them as human shields to protect Iraq's<br />
aggressive military capabilities.<br />
Second, calls upon Iraq to<br />
withdraw all its forces unconditionally from Kuwait<br />
facilitate the restoration of the legal government of<br />
Kuwait and respect the rights of foreign nationals.<br />
Third, affirms<br />
the fundamental importance of the United Nations<br />
*-Charter-as-the -basis for the-conduct of international<br />
relations and the preservation of peace<br />
and, in particular, the vital principle of the sanctity<br />
of international borders. </p>
<p>2.<br />
Fourth, welcomes<br />
the United Nation's prompt and unprecedented action in<br />
condemning Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and in adopting<br />
mandatory and comprehensive sanctions against Iraq to<br />
force it to comply with the UN's decisions<br />
Fifth, supports<br />
the Australian Government's prompt action to implement<br />
UN sanctions<br />
the Government's decision to send ships of the RAN to<br />
the Middle East to assist by means of identification,<br />
contact, interrogation and warning in enforcing UN<br />
sanctions against Iraq under Article 51 of the UN<br />
Charter the Australian Government's continuing diplomatic<br />
efforts at the UN and elsewhere<br />
to bring the enforcement of sanctions under<br />
explicit UN control through further appropriate<br />
resolutions of the Security Council, and<br />
to find a speedy and peaceful resolution to the<br />
crisis<br />
and Sixth, expresses<br />
concern for the welfare of Australians held in Iraq and<br />
Kuwait against their will, and sympathy for the<br />
apprehensions of their families and loved ones about<br />
their welfare. </p>
