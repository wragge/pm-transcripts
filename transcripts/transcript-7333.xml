FOR MEDIA 10 JUNE 1988<br />
The Prime Minister of Ireland, Mr Charles Haughey,<br />
accompanied by Mrs Haughey, will visit Australia from 11 to<br />
16 July as a Guest of the Government.<br />
The visit reciprocates my memorable visit to Ireland last<br />
year, and reflects the contribution of the Irish and people<br />
of Irish descent to all aspects of Australian life, a<br />
contribution of which we are especially reminded in our<br />
Bicentennial year.<br />
In Canberra, Mr Haughey will present Ireland's Bicentennial<br />
gift of convict records to the National Library. He will<br />
also be visiting Perth, Sydney and Melbourne. 7108 I </p>
