AMERHIECLADN -AAT UUSNTIRVAELRISAINT YA SSCOLCUIBA TINOEWN YLOURNKCHEON TH JUNE 16<br />
S ech by the Prime Mini1ster, the Rt. Hon. Sir Robert Menzie<br />
Mr. Floyd Blair, the President of the American-<br />
Au tralian Association has thrown a little bit of a fly over me<br />
when he suggested in his introduction that I ought to talk about<br />
ovrseas investment. But when I look around here and see so<br />
max7 people who have a practical interest in investment in Australia,<br />
I dare not say a word in case I spoil what is already very good.<br />
Nor indeed would I have you suppose we sit and bite our nails and<br />
cu se whatev3r measures may be taken in the United States because<br />
though you may occasionally think to the contrary we do know<br />
th re are other people in the world, and that other countries have<br />
pr blems very frequently quite like our own.<br />
You have a balance of payments problem that is by no<br />
me ns to be laughed off one understands that. d4e have too,<br />
pe iodically not that we have not had our flush periods in terms<br />
of our overseas reserves. But the last year, and in the current,<br />
or the anticipated financial year, there will be a good deal of rundow.<br />
But, still, we are not going bankrupt, and for the sake of<br />
thl world we hope just as much as you do to see an early recovery<br />
oi the full strength of the dollar. This is, from the world's<br />
po nt of view, a matter of outstanding importance. I know the<br />
world has a great number of problems today. There are problems<br />
of international liquidity. These are very individual problems<br />
be ause some countries are much more affected than others.<br />
Hoxever, my idea of a perfect paradise speaking as an Australian<br />
wo ld be a position of absolutely rugged strength sterling, of<br />
absolutely rugged strength for the dollar and a successful general<br />
el ction. These are very simple requirements.<br />
But I would like to yield to Mr. Blair's blandishments<br />
in the other field and say something to you about Vietnam and<br />
pT ase don't think that I am casting Australia for a great role<br />
on this matter though I think we always do as well as we can.<br />
I lso know, not being entirely a fool, that the practical contribut.<br />
n of Australia to the struggle in Vietnam is widely understood<br />
an well appreciated in the United States. Its value may be<br />
pr ncipally symbolic, but it also is intrinsic and nobody is better<br />
aw re than I am of the feeling which exists in many parts of the<br />
Un ted States that you do not want to be cast in the role of the<br />
wold's gendarme in perpetuity. You must become a little tired of<br />
having so many people in the world saying, " WIell, they're the<br />
gzoatest power. It's their responsibility. Let them attend to it."<br />
Now, I want to emphasise that has never been the<br />
a ; itude of my country, and never will be. We know you are a<br />
stong and a great power. We know that your strength is of vital<br />
si ificance to us. But we do not leave everything to you. We<br />
ar) your junior partner and we propose to continue to be an active<br />
on contributing one, recognising mutuality that attaches to<br />
al engagements of friendship. This I think is something that,<br />
of course, is understood but that needs never to be forgotten.<br />
In the nineteenth century, Great Britain was beyond<br />
qu stion the greatest power in the World. In those days her command<br />
of the seas gave her in effect command of the world. And who are<br />
we her children in Australia, to complain about this tremendous<br />
inieritance. But all the time that Great Britain was the greatest<br />
po er in the world, never let it be forgotten that she was probably ./ 2 </p>
<p>2<br />
the most unpopular one. Tt must have been very difficult in thiose<br />
days to go through Europe without encountering scepticism, dislike,<br />
enm ty and jealousy, I do not need to define these things to ' you<br />
because you are enjoying the benefit of them today. That is part<br />
of the price of admiralty. you expect to have a word of thanks.<br />
You don't get it and all I say to you is don't expect it. The<br />
warld isn't like that. All you have to do is say one thing, and<br />
I ow you do " We are the greatest power, and therefore we have<br />
the greatest responsibility because power and responsibility will<br />
alw ys tend to equate themselves."<br />
That is why people look to you and look to you not in<br />
va in, But I think what does need to be said is that a great<br />
por is not cynically to be presumed to be acting about a matter<br />
in ure narrow self-interest, I see that very great Frenchman,<br />
General de Gaulle, made a speech yesterday.... Anything I say<br />
abaut him must be said with profound respect because he has been<br />
a great and famous man and has done in his time great things for<br />
his own country. But when he goes on record as saying that<br />
America is engaged in a " dirty business" in Vietnam, then I really<br />
thi Ifkta e have reached the limit.<br />
4hy are you in Vietnam? This is my favourite question<br />
i.* thenever I encounter the doubter and the sceptic. Why do you<br />
sup pose the Airericans are in Vietnam? " For profit," 1 some fellow<br />
saii to me one dayi Australia, " for profit". " Yes", I said.<br />
" It's a new conception of profit. You've added a new meaning to<br />
a wbrd in the dictionary I compliment you".<br />
Souh VetWell, why? iBecause, in the short run, is the freedom of<br />
Souh ienam essential to the freedom of California? I don't<br />
suppose so. No. Is it because the freedom of South Vietnam is<br />
not unimportant to your friends in Australia? I know that you think<br />
ot' jthat but this is not the essence of it. You know, I may be<br />
the most naive fellow at the age of 70) and having been a Prime<br />
Minister far an awful long time I ough,, to have got aver any of<br />
teerather boyish attributes; I may be extraordinarily simpleminded.<br />
But I think what is going on in South Vietnam is one of<br />
the greatest demonstrations by this country of the loftiness of<br />
its responsibilities that I have ever seen. This is a matter of<br />
vas~ t importance. Why?<br />
Because it has to do with freedom. People say freedom<br />
is amuch abused word, 7 it is a sentimental word. It may be much<br />
abused, but there is nothing very sentimental about freedom, about<br />
humn freedom because human freedom has a sort of universal quality<br />
abaut it. I am concerned about my human freedom in Australia.<br />
Bu theyoung man round the corner in Saigon, he's concerned about<br />
his~ human freedom. It is the same kind of human freedom-that we are<br />
con cerned about and the same that you are concerned about.<br />
~ Jh~ neerfreedom is struck down anywhere in the world, we feel the<br />
impact of it because our own freedom has to that extent been<br />
re duced. No matter for whom the bell tolls, it tolls far thee.<br />
That is the essence of it.<br />
In my opinion, freedom is one of the great innate<br />
attributes of human nature and it is therefore universal in its<br />
inrer aspects. It is not divisible. You cannot sell out on the<br />
freedom of one country and think you have protected the freedom<br />
of your own. Freedom is not divisible. Freedom is not expendable.<br />
Thdugh I do not want to appear to be using words of extravagance<br />
on this matter, we are, in our way, in South Vietnam for the same<br />
reasans you are in South Vietnam because we both believe that<br />
this is not merely a battle against the people who happen to be<br />
communists ( that has got merit in itself) but this is a battle<br />
a. 0 to 0 </p>
<p>-3<br />
fori the defence of things that have just as much validity in<br />
Okip homa or Canberra as they have in Saigon. This is a matte'<br />
of the freedom of human beings.<br />
Let us elaborate a little on that. If we have a<br />
stra ggle of this kind and we have agreed that itts not just a<br />
straiggle against something but for something, what is it for?<br />
What are these principles that we are concerned about? One-of<br />
the, if I may be so old-fashioned as to remind you, is the-right<br />
of every nation to its own sovereign independence, not to be<br />
pus aed around by other people and not to be nibbled away by<br />
subfrersion the almost divine right of every nation to have its<br />
osovereignty. I get very annoyed with conferences here and there<br />
1he somebody wants to discuss the internal affairs of some other<br />
cou try and I have a fixed principle each country has a right<br />
to un its own internal affairs in its own fashion and not to be<br />
interfered with by bu~ sybodies. You cannot run your own affairs<br />
unl~ ss you have a recognition of your free sovereignty unless<br />
you~ are free from aggression, from attack and from undermining.<br />
Now, it is this divine right of men to live free from<br />
agg~ ression, free from unprovoked violence living in their own<br />
homes in their own country without fear ol attack, which is one<br />
of he great human rights and it is because these humaan rights<br />
are the same wherever vie lve that we find ourselves in a common<br />
cau o. Mow, I hope I am establishing i. n your own minds what<br />
I a~ n trying to establish the freedom of my country. OJe are<br />
righit out there on the end of the line. Suppose the United States<br />
had~ done what some people would LÃ± ave had you do stood clear.<br />
I wo) nder how long South Vietnama would remain an independent<br />
country. I wonder how long it would be able to resist being<br />
ove rrun by Ho Chin Minh in the North and ultimate], y by Communist<br />
Chi a. I wonder how long Not too long, one might suppose.<br />
And~ if South Vietnam went how long do we suppose Thailand could<br />
sta ~ d unaided because if it were a bad thing to go into South<br />
Viet. nam, it would be an equally bad thing to go in to defend<br />
Tha land or an equally bad thing to go in to defend Laos. I tell<br />
you I can see this murkyr shadow 0coming down over the whole of the<br />
South-East Asian peninsula, pointing first at Malaysia, then at<br />
Indonesia with all the strange things that go on in that country,<br />
and Ithen across a strip of water to my own land, These are<br />
tremnendously important things. Our freedom and not just our<br />
freedom is part of that total freedom which your country has<br />
refi sed to abandon.<br />
I Really, it is essential to come back to the original<br />
que~ tion which I always put to myself. Why is America in South<br />
Vie nam? What would be the position if she were not? What would<br />
be the impact on the world's history? I do not want to see a state<br />
of iffairs well, I will not be here anyhow but I do not want<br />
my children or grandchildren to see a state of affairs in which<br />
fre,. dom is in an embattled position in the United States of<br />
Aine. ica and has disappeared in most of the other countries of the<br />
worL d, This would not do because freedom is universal.<br />
Freedom is not divisible. Freedom is something that you cannot<br />
a 00 0. * 0/ </p>
<p>4<br />
sell out and attacks upon which you cannot appease. It is<br />
something which vhen it is successfully defended has such things<br />
ito say to the human heart and the human mind, lights such fires<br />
iln them that all around the world the defence of freedom will<br />
inmd itself justified by the high feelings of free people who<br />
now that they have been delivered and who therefore live in<br />
hope. That is a pretty long sort of sermon. But I really<br />
intended to say to you, on behalf of my own country, that we<br />
aire vastly indebted to the United States for its stand on these<br />
natters. I am certain that all the people of the free world are<br />
tlstly indebted. You will have critics, you will have grumblers,<br />
~ ou will have doubters, but in the long run, perhaps not in the<br />
xry long run, I think you may feel that you are the actors and<br />
~ he spokesmain for an almost unanimous free world opinion. </p>
