Prime Minister Julia Gillard today welcomed the President of the Republic of Mozambique, His Excellency Armando EmÃ­lio Guebuza and his delegation to Australia.</p>
<p>Ms Gillard expressed Australia's condolences following the recent floods in Mozambique, noting Australia too had experienced damaging floods in recent years. President Guebuza expressed Mozambique's solidarity with the victims of the recent floods and bushfires that affected Australia. </p>
<p>The two leaders noted the warmth and friendship that underpinned the bilateral relationship and the growing high-level contact between Mozambique and Australia.  The Governor-General of Australia, Ms Quentin Bryce AC CVO, visited Mozambique in 2009; President Guebuza attended the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Perth in 2011. </p>
<p>Following last year's signing of a Memorandum of Understanding on Bilateral Cooperation, the two leaders welcomed closer relations between Australia and Mozambique, including on international issues of mutual concern such as climate change and food security.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Gillard and President Guebuza noted the significant engagement between Mozambique and Australia in the mining resources sector. Ms Gillard said that the skills and capabilities of Australia's mining industry were world class and welcomed interest by Australian companies in helping to accelerate the development of Mozambique's mining sector.</p>
<p>The two leaders expressed their shared commitment to a sustainable mining future, through initiatives such as the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative. President Guebuza welcomed the development assistance Australia was providing to Mozambique in strengthening natural resources governance. This has been consolidated through a new Memorandum of Understanding on a Mining for Development Partnership signed today at Parliament House, in the presence of both leaders.</p>
<p>The two leaders reviewed progress and challenges in the world, in particular on the African continent.  Ms Gillard thanked Mozambique for its support for Australia's successful bid for non-permanent membership of the UN Security Council for 2013/2014.</p>
<p>President Guebuza acknowledged the valuable contribution Australia was making to address peace and security issues in Africa, including through its work on the UN Security Council, and welcomed Australia's increased engagement in Africa more broadly.</p>
<p>Ms Gillard acknowledged Mozambique's contribution to maintaining peace and security in Africa as the Chair of both the Southern Africa Development Community and the Community of Portuguese Speaking Countries.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Gillard and President Guebuza discussed steps to strengthen the bilateral relationship and cooperation, including in water and sanitation, agriculture and capacity building through Australia Awards.  They agreed to encourage the efforts of the private sector in both countries to deepen trade and investments links, including in infrastructure. </p>
<p>The two leaders agreed on the importance of regular consultations between Ministers and officials on bilateral and multilateral issues.  In that respect, they welcomed the inaugural Australia-Mozambique Foreign Ministers' Dialogue held in Canberra during President Guebuza's visit.</p>
<p>This visit also included discussions between Australian and Mozambican Ministers and Members of Parliament.</p>
