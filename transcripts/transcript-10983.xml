<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>The Prime Minister joins me now for his regular segment and he is</p>
<p> in our sister station 2UE studio in Canberra. Good morning Prime Minister.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good morning Howard.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Thanks for joining us. When did Mr Fischer actually ring you and tell</p>
<p> you that he was going to pull the pin?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh, only a few days ago. He's explained the circumstances of it. We</p>
<p> had our final discussion yesterday. Tim has been a tremendous Deputy</p>
<p> Prime Minister and I am going to miss him. I can't disguise that fact.</p>
<p> He has been a loyal Coalition partner and a very good friend, a wonderful</p>
<p> Trade Minister and just a great personality into the bargain. But</p>
<p> he's decided for the reasons that he has made very plain and he does</p>
<p> have quite young children. He's been in politics for a very long period</p>
<p> of time and he has decided to take a different career path. And whilst</p>
<p> I will miss him terribly I understand and respect that and along with</p>
<p> the rest of the political community and the Australian community more</p>
<p> generally I do wish him and Judy and Harrison and Dominic every happiness</p>
<p> in the future. He's done yeoman service for the country, for the National</p>
<p> Party, for the Coalition Government and very importantly as a Trade</p>
<p> Minister he really has made his mark. I have found as I went around</p>
<p> Asian capitals that everybody knew Tim Fischer...</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>And his hat.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>And his hat and a smile came across their face when you mentioned</p>
<p> him. And he is held in very high regard in the Australian business</p>
<p> community as being a person who is prepared to go out there and punch</p>
<p> hard for Australian business overseas and I thank him for that.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Did you try and talk him out of it or at least to delay it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh look, the sort of conversations that a Prime Minister and a Deputy</p>
<p> Prime Minister have are very intricate, they are very detailed, they</p>
<p> range over a whole lot of subjects and I don't break confidences in</p>
<p> relation to that.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>But is his timing okay with you?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look, his timing is okay with me if it's right for him and his family.</p>
<p> And in the end, individuals in public life know when it's appropriate</p>
<p> for them to go taking all factors into account. And there is no hard</p>
<p> and fast rule for when you go or how long you stay or what age it</p>
<p> is it depends entirely upon each separate set of circumstances, what</p>
<p> your other interests are, what the age of your children might be,</p>
<p> what your health is like. All of those things. How long you have been</p>
<p> around. There's no hard and fast rule, it varies enormously. Tim has</p>
<p> reached a firm decision to go. I am sure it's the right decision for</p>
<p> him because it's a decision that he believes is right for him. And</p>
<p> in the end he's the only person who has got a right to make that judgement.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Does it cause you to reflect on your own situation, the past and the</p>
<p> future? You have put 25 years of public service in too and I guess</p>
<p> a lot of the time you have had to put that ahead of your family?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, my family, of course, is older than Tim's family....</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>They are now, of course.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, and in a way the more challenging years are behind Janette and</p>
<p> I in relation to our children. They are now three adults, we are a</p>
<p> very happy group and I am immensely grateful for that and we are enjoying</p>
<p> their company as young adults and that's a marvellous phase of your</p>
<p> life. I enjoyed their company as young children. We were able to organise</p>
<p> things between ourselves so that even though I was away a lot when</p>
<p> I was at home I did nothing else but devote myself to the children.</p>
<p> We now, I guess, are getting the reward of that because as young adults</p>
<p> we are enjoying their company and it's very stimulating, we are enjoying</p>
<p> that company immensely.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Yeah but see, Tim Fischer is quitting largely because of the health</p>
<p> condition of one of his children and your wife was quite ill for a</p>
<p> time too. I mean, was there a time when you thought, well, you know</p>
<p> really I have just got to put the family first and maybe it's time</p>
<p> to go?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I have been asked that before. Janette was ill three years ago.</p>
<p> Thankfully she has got over that and her health now is very good and</p>
<p> she's very enthusiastic about my continued participation in public</p>
<p> life.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>What indefinitely?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, nobody stays forever, break it down.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>She wouldn't want me to do that. But I said...</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Well, you'd probably like to enjoy your lives together and stop us</p>
<p> hassling you.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, you never hassle me you just ask hard questions. Howard, I said</p>
<p> at the time of the last election you take it one term at a time. I</p>
<p> have got very good health, I am very lucky and we have reached a stage</p>
<p> in our life where, as I say, our children are young adults. That doesn't</p>
<p> mean to say you don't still have responsibilities and continued intense</p>
<p> interest and devotion and commitment but it's a slightly different</p>
<p> situation than perhaps 15 years ago...</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>But do you review your life ahead and say, well okay, I am going to</p>
<p> go to the next election but after that I really am going to have a</p>
<p> think about it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, what I say is I do one election at a time when you reach my</p>
<p> age. And I have been re-elected and I am enjoying it. I am still stimulated</p>
<p> by it. I think the Government is achieving a lot and we have got more</p>
<p> to achieve.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>But you have achieved your primary goal and that is tax reform.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh well, it's an ongoing thing. I have got to bed that down, we've</p>
<p> got business tax coming up. Howard I am still stimulated by it, I</p>
<p> am still energised by it and I still have a lot, I hope, to give to</p>
<p> this country but nobody stays forever.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>No, no, okay. So you will go to the next poll, we can confirm that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we take one election at a time.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Okay. Now, the new leader has been elected, the new leader of the</p>
<p> National Party, John Anderson, said to be a lot drier than Tim Fischer.</p>
<p> What does that mean?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, can I first of all congratulate John for being elected leader</p>
<p> and Mark Vaile as Deputy. They'll be an excellent team. I like and</p>
<p> respect them both, they are very intelligent, energetic men. Both</p>
<p> of them understand the needs of the Australian economy and a global</p>
<p> economy as Tim Fischer did. Can I say I don't agree with that, I don't</p>
<p> think to use these rather simplistic expressions of dry or not so</p>
<p> dry. I think Tim, one of Tim's many virtues was that he never gave</p>
<p> in to populism, he always argued that in the long-term interests of</p>
<p> this country, including its rural community, we needed to trade more</p>
<p> successfully and to open markets abroad. And therefore we had a vested</p>
<p> interest greater than most in an open world trading system. Now, John</p>
<p> Anderson...</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>It's a pity our American friends don't have the same attitude.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, this is precisely the argument I put to President Clinton. When</p>
<p> I spoke to him on the phone a few weeks ago I said: Bill, if you take</p>
<p> this restrictive decision on lamb it will go against all of your rhetoric</p>
<p> and it will be used by other countries as an excuse for them to lapse</p>
<p> back into protectionism.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>What did he say?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, he said he would consider that and we haven't had a decision</p>
<p> yet. I must say, like Tim Fischer, I am not very optimistic as to</p>
<p> what that decision will be. But John Anderson understands the modern</p>
<p> world, we all do and it is in the long-term interests of Australia</p>
<p> that we prize open world markets. We are only 18.5 million people,</p>
<p> we must trade to survive and we must make sure that we are competitive</p>
<p> and that's why we have got a new tax system because our exports will</p>
<p> be cheaper under the new tax system.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Does that mean you will offer John Anderson a trade portfolio because</p>
<p> I understood he didn't want to take it or Mark Vaile?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I will talk to John about the arrangements. That's a matter</p>
<p> of courtesy I owe to him.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Would you like him to take that.....?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I will talk to him first before I start saying what I'd</p>
<p> like him to take. He is the newly elected leader of the National Party.</p>
<p> He will on the 20th of July or there abouts become the</p>
<p> Deputy Prime Minister of Australia and I owe him the courtesy of talking</p>
<p> to him first before I start saying who does what amongst National</p>
<p> Party ministers. He has a right to have an input into that as part</p>
<p> of our Coalition arrangement.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Sure. [Commercial break]. I've got the Prime Minister in our</p>
<p> [inaudible] 2UE studios in Canberra. If you want to give him a call</p>
<p> you can on 9221 1233. He was telling us that he has been speaking</p>
<p> with President Clinton about their attempts to try and protect their</p>
<p> farming fraternity over there and exclude Australian lamb from the</p>
<p> markets over there. Prime Minister, you are due to meet Mr Clinton</p>
<p> what, the week after next is it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yeah, on the 12th of July. I'm leaving Australia on</p>
<p> Monday to go an official visit to Japan and that will be next week.</p>
<p> And then at the end of next week I'll go onto the United States</p>
<p> and I'll see the President.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Will you get to him before they make a decision...?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I don't know. I don't know. I expected a decision about</p>
<p> a week or ten days ago. I still remain basically a bit pessimistic</p>
<p> because in the end on these matters the Americans do have a track</p>
<p> record of listening to domestic pressure. It will be a great shame</p>
<p> if they go against us on this.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Well what will we do about it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well you've got to remember we're only 18.5 million people.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>I know, and they know that too.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I know. But it doesn't alter the fact that if they do the</p>
<p> wrong thing on this it sends a terrible signal to other countries.</p>
<p> I just hope that they will listen to us at least to some degree.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>All right, back to domestic matters. You were clearly delighted to</p>
<p> get the tax reform package including the GST through the Parliament.</p>
<p> But this is not the tax package we voted you into office on. Are we</p>
<p> entitled to feel a little cheated with what we've got?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well it's 85% of what you voted for.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>That's right but.....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well the alternative was to spit the dummy and persevere with the</p>
<p> present system, or to take the public back for another election with</p>
<p> no guarantee that that would deliver 100%. I mean we could.....</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Or that you'd get re-elected.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well of course. I mean there's always...Howard I don't</p>
<p> disguise that in any election there's a danger you're going</p>
<p> to lose. There's a winner and a loser in every election. I don't</p>
<p> think the public wanted another election.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>No well I'm sure they didn't.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It wasn't the mail I was getting. The mail I was getting from</p>
<p> people was basically they really wanted, even those who didn't</p>
<p> vote for it, they wanted the package to go through in its original</p>
<p> form. When we found we couldn't do that most people were saying</p>
<p> to me well see if you can negotiate an outcome with the Australian</p>
<p> Democrats which delivers most of what you wanted. You won't get</p>
<p> all of it because you can't expect them to give up everything</p>
<p> that they hold dear. And that's exactly what I did and I found</p>
<p> in negotiating with the Democrats in Senator Lees an intelligent,</p>
<p> straight forward candid woman with whom one could talk and do business,</p>
<p> and we did that.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Would you like to get rid of the Senate?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh, well no. I don't think you can get rid of the Senate, it's</p>
<p> part of the Federal compact.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Well in New Zealand they got rid of the Upper House in their Parliament</p>
<p> and they got the GST through in 2 hours did they.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>But New Zealand's not a federation. You can't ignore the</p>
<p> history of this country, particularly when I'm talking to a Western</p>
<p> Australian audience. It started with the States and we formed it into</p>
<p> soluble federal commonwealth. We are a nation of course more importantly</p>
<p> than we are individual States. But the deal for federation essentially</p>
<p> was that you had a Senate with equal State representation to more</p>
<p> or less cater for the less populous parts of Australia and you had</p>
<p> a House of Representatives elected on the basis...</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Is it working as it should?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't. But I deal with</p>
<p> reality. Change of that kind is very difficult in this country and</p>
<p> I'm not sure that the Australian public mind the current arrangement.</p>
<p> I think it waxes and wanes a bit. I'm certainly not proposing</p>
<p> any radical changes in that area.</p>
<p> SATTLER:</p>
<p>On the goods and services tax, do you feel sympathy for small mixed</p>
<p> retail businesses who are saying they're going to be saddled</p>
<p> with a paper and financial nightmare trying to comply with a GST.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't believe it will be as bad as some are suggesting and</p>
<p> we are going to put a lot of resources in the way of making sure it</p>
<p> isn't. So the answer is, I think by the time all the systems</p>
<p> are ready for its introduction in a year's time then it won't</p>
<p> be anything like what people suggest and I suspect it will be like</p>
<p> New Zealand. After it had been in place for a few weeks people have</p>
<p> said, gee, what was all the fuss about.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Yeah, but what help are you going to give those people?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>A lot. We're putting $500 million aside for small businesses</p>
<p> and others to help with the implementation of the GST. And we are</p>
<p> going to conduct a very extensive education campaign and we're</p>
<p> going to adopt a very practical approach to compliance in relation</p>
<p> to those businesses that are essentially selling items that are both</p>
<p> subject to and exempt from the GST.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Do you think there'll be much rorting or attempted rorting?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, there's always some of that no matter what system you have</p>
<p> but the great beauty of a GST is that it's harder to rort than</p>
<p> the present system.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Yeah, no doubt about that. All right, but logically some of the eating</p>
<p> out establishments will suffer once they have to...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, not necessarily.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, because people will have more money in their pocket to buy their</p>
<p> restaurant meals. They will have more money in their pocket. You see,</p>
<p> everybody's in front unless you're a crook because there</p>
<p> are personal tax cuts. And if you watch my Address to the Nation tonight</p>
<p> I'll explain it in more detail.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>I'll watch with bated breath. I'll be riveted to it.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yeah, I'm sure you will.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>How do you think it's going to rate?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't know. I mean, these things, I mean, you've...</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>You've got to do it.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, no, it's important. It's important. I don't think</p>
<p> I'll quite be able to match Sea Change though.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Or the tennis.</p>
