^ 4 POLICY SPEECH<br />
by<br />
TTE PRIME MINISTER, THE RT. HON. R. G. MENZIES<br />
at<br />
THE CITY HALL KEW<br />
;, EDNESDAf. A H NOVEMBR. 1961<br />
On December 9, though you will be voting for individual<br />
candidates, the end result will be that you choose a Government<br />
-for the natl ' n.<br />
I do not propose to put before you a long list of<br />
promises. After 12 years the A. L. P. can easily make a series of<br />
brand new offers without saying where the new hundreds of<br />
millions are to come frkim; though they will, of course-come<br />
from you. For Governments have no money to spend excep6 that<br />
which has been earned and paid over, by tax or loan, by the men<br />
and women of Australia.<br />
But we are a government whose policies and ideas have<br />
been for 12 years put into practice. For us to come along now<br />
with a string of new promises would excite your ridicule. You<br />
could well say: " You have had years to do these things. Why<br />
didn't you think of them before?"<br />
We offer you good government. The essential quality<br />
of good government is that it should have sound and intelligible<br />
principles, that it should pursue great national and social<br />
objectives with resoluteness, that it should be able to meet the<br />
storms that arise from time , o time with a proper sense of<br />
navigation, that it should have cohesion in its own ranks and a<br />
strong sense of mutual loyalty.<br />
If a government has these qualities it will deal with<br />
such matters as social services, medical benefits, repatriation<br />
provisions in a liberal and just spirit. You vi 11 remember the<br />
tremendous improvements in such matters which we have initiated<br />
and carried through. Very few of them were ever mentioned by us<br />
in a Policy Speech.<br />
TonightI will lay before you a statement of principles<br />
and ideas which have been followed and, in our belief, ought to<br />
continue to be followed for the good of Australia.<br />
I could speak to you for hours on the national and<br />
social achievements of the last decade. The overwhelming majoriy<br />
of Australians have benefitted from them, and will remember them.<br />
I will not take your time tonight in reciting them. My brief<br />
reference to them is made merely to provide the foundation for<br />
my main purpose, which is to clarify the basic nature of the<br />
continuing policies which have contributed powerfully to these<br />
results. I say " continuing policies", because the one great<br />
promise you will find in this speech is that these policies will<br />
go on, ever strengthening the present and building for the<br />
future. There can never be anything static about a policy of<br />
national development; that would be a contradiction in terms.<br />
That is why, tonight, -ihen I refer to the past, it is the living<br />
past, leading inevitably to the living future. It is not enough<br />
for us as a Government or as a nation, to say: " We have livedJ"<br />
Je must feel the excitement of living and working and planning<br />
and building. </p>
<p>2.<br />
2o<br />
We are not-opposed tc the dismal doctrines of<br />
socialism for merely theoretical reasons. rJe are for<br />
competitive free enterprise because it is dynamic; because it<br />
tackles new problems and creates new industries and makes<br />
progress and profit by efficiency and the spirit of adventure.<br />
Governments can do much to create an economic climate<br />
in which things will grow. Within the limits of social justice<br />
and national necessity, private citizens ought to be encouraged<br />
to get on with the job free of the threat that if they succeed<br />
too well some Social. it theorists will want to take them over,<br />
de need to have a mental picture of the kind of<br />
Australia want to see in another ten or twenty years; a<br />
nation strong, respected, and friendly, and free; with a much<br />
greater population, well-housed and fed and clothed and happy;<br />
a producing nation drawing from the good earth a powerful<br />
contribution to the materials which human beings need; a great<br />
trading nation with such markets abroad for the products of<br />
Australian fields and factories that her international solvency<br />
is steady and secure; a well-ordered, because a self-ordered<br />
country with responsible , overnment, a country in which<br />
extremists and the promotors of division and hatred die for want<br />
of material to sustain them.<br />
It is because of one vision that wie have one total<br />
policy; not a thing of shreds and patches and cash promises for<br />
next week or next month, but a single conception of which what<br />
we have done was an expression, and what we aim to do is a<br />
continuing projection.<br />
Let me illustrate this, After we had announced our<br />
economic measures of November last, I indicated that we were not<br />
confusing stability with stagnation; that although we auld not<br />
in 1961 find large additional sums of money for works, we<br />
wanted to confer with the States for the planning of new<br />
enterprises which would-increase export trade and the national<br />
: realth. Thereafter we began negotiations with several State<br />
Governments on large and complex matters. It would have been<br />
simple enough to pursue a time-table which would have enabled me,<br />
tonight, to make some dramatic announcements in relation to<br />
national works to be carried out during the term of the next<br />
Parliament. But we prefer ( as you do) performance to promise,<br />
Accordingly, during the last few weeks of Parliament, we completed<br />
some large negotiations and secured authorising legislation<br />
relating to The modernisation and re-building of the Mt. Isa-<br />
Townsville-Collinsville railway in North Queensland.<br />
This will enable a most remarkable development in<br />
mining, particularly copper, in Mt. Isa, a development<br />
on which the ompany itself will spend over œ 40m. and<br />
which therefore represents the kind of mutual<br />
co-operation between government and private enterprise<br />
to which our policies are directed. It will add<br />
scores of millions to our exports. It will be the<br />
greatest specific development in Queensland, that area<br />
so full of possibilities, for many years. It will be<br />
of great value to Northern development generally, de<br />
have voluntarily contracted to find initial capital to<br />
the extent of<br />
The mechanical improvement of coal ports normally a<br />
purely State responsibility in New South Jales and<br />
Queensland. This will permit of greatly increased<br />
exports of coal. The work to be done at Newcastle, </p>
<p>3.<br />
Balmain, Port Kembla and Gladstone is being<br />
substantially assist d from Commonwealth funds.<br />
The equipment of the Broken Hill-Port Pirie ralway,<br />
chiefly in South Australia, with modern rolling stock<br />
and diesel locomotives. We have, by an agreement with<br />
South Australia, agreed to find the initial capital for<br />
this important work.<br />
The establishment in Western Australia of an iron and<br />
steel industry which should open a dramatic new era of<br />
Western d~~ jlopment. Great iron ore deposits will be<br />
opened up at Koolyanobbing, west of Kalgoorlie, to<br />
ripply an iron and steel works to be built at Kwinana.<br />
A tandard gauge railway will be built from Kalgoorlie<br />
to Kwinana through Perth.<br />
The overall cost of this immense scheme i. s<br />
estimated at œ 42m. of which the Commonwealth will<br />
initially find<br />
In addition to the œ fm. which we had already found for<br />
the development of the iorthern part of ' estern<br />
Australia, we agreed to find additional money for<br />
export beef roads. We have just secured Parliamentary<br />
approval for the provision of œ 5m. to the State of<br />
Queensland for similar purposes.<br />
Here we have, going on over the next few years, a<br />
total expenditure by Governments and the companies<br />
concerned of the better part of œ 200m. of which the<br />
Commonwealth Government is financing œ 70m. The most<br />
satisfying aspect of all the negotiations has been the<br />
forward-looking enthusiasm of all parties with no<br />
pessimists to be found. The announcement, in an<br />
election speech, of such a programme, coming on top of<br />
the scores of millions to be spent on such enterpriscs<br />
as the -reat Snowy Mountains hydro-electric and<br />
irrigation headworks scheme, would indeed be<br />
sensational and arresting. I hope it will be no less<br />
so because we have not thought fit to let it rest in<br />
promise, but have already assured its performance,<br />
And let it be remembered that such works are themselves<br />
the means for future works and development and consequent<br />
enterprise, for many years to come.<br />
Thus, the Snowy Mountains Scheme, though its planned<br />
production of electric power is perhaps best known, will provide,<br />
for New South Jales, Victoria and South Australia, increased<br />
water storages and supplies for irrigation and general purposes,<br />
The irrigation future of the Murray and the Murrumbidgee areas<br />
will be assured. For South Australia, wator is particularly<br />
important. The Snowy Scheme is here of great value. But, with<br />
the growth of that State, new problems of water may well arise<br />
in the next few years Accordingly, the question of another great<br />
Murray storage at Chowilla, near the South Australian border, has<br />
been examined by the River Murray Caters Commission. This would<br />
create the greatest single water-storage in Australia and would<br />
produce benefits to all three States. I have already announced<br />
that, when a detailed scheme has been agreed upon, the<br />
Commonwealth will find a quarter of the total cost, at present<br />
estimated at œ l14m, or<br />
ie will, within our financial capacity, antinue to be<br />
interested in works which will add to Australia's producti've<br />
capacity for the earning of export income or the saving of<br />
imports. </p>
<p>Some of the matters I have referred to are part of a<br />
* pattern-of Northern Australian development. : e believe that for<br />
the sake of our national future we must develop and use the<br />
North. believe that its possibilities, particularly in<br />
minerals ( the search for which we will continue actively to<br />
encourage), and in cattle, are enormous. By co-operation between<br />
State Governments, Territorial authorities, the Commonwealth<br />
Government, and those engaged in industry, national growth in<br />
the North should be a great feature of our next decade of<br />
development. In Australia, of all continents, water supply, storage<br />
and use are of paramount importance. The Commonweal~ h Government<br />
has conducte, active research into water resources both in the<br />
Northern Territory, rhere valuable results have been achieved,<br />
and in the Snowy Mountains, through the Authority. . le think that<br />
the time has arrived for the co-ordination of methods of research<br />
and the pooling of the important information which can be<br />
obtained. Already much good work is being done in various<br />
States. I propose to ' like up with the Premiers and with the<br />
lerritorial authorities * he idea of establishing a Jater<br />
Resources Council so that the highest level of basic information<br />
on our Australian water resources can be secured and made<br />
available. In mineral development, our Department of National<br />
Development haF given notable leadership.<br />
Back in 1950 Australia was importing coal: today it<br />
is a substantial exporter. The story of uranium is, I hope,<br />
well known, crowned as it is by the work of the Atomic Energy<br />
Commission, whose research and productive activities enjoy world<br />
repute. Great resources of bauxite have been uncovered. Great<br />
alumina and aluminium enterprises are in the making.<br />
Selectively permitted exports of iron ore are leading to the<br />
discovery of new deposits. le are encouraging, in the most<br />
practical ways, the search for oil, sustained by optimism. In<br />
our time, scores of millions of pounds have been invested in oil<br />
refineries, which have achieved an export capacity, and are in<br />
fact earning substantial export income. . ho would have<br />
contemplated this a few years ago.' Nothing can prevent the most<br />
amazing developments in the next decade so long as we avoid the<br />
dead hand of reactionary socialism. These are great days for<br />
men of enterprise, who know : rhere they want to go, and are<br />
prepared to battle to get there.<br />
I can imagi-ne somebody saying that this talk of<br />
building for tomorrow is inconsistent with our policies of<br />
November 1960, Those policies were designed not to impede<br />
progress, but to remove impediments to progress.<br />
An inflationary boom increases the cost of delelopmental<br />
works, makes it more difficult to raise loan moneys for<br />
essential works, raises the costs of our export commodities<br />
encourages land speculation nd other forms of gambling, and<br />
discourages savings and investment.<br />
My government was not prepared to permit a boom to<br />
roar on to the inevitable burst, Te felt that it should be<br />
quelled, and a normal state of affairs restored. e knew that<br />
this would be unpleasant for some, but we believed that our<br />
actions would protect many more people against a collapse, and<br />
that the progress of national development would in consequence<br />
go on more soundly and steadily, </p>
<p>What were -the facts?<br />
1. The boom was evidenced by rising prices-and shortages<br />
of labour. In 1960 the Consumer Price Index rose by<br />
no less than 4.5% a greater increase than during the<br />
preceding three years taken together. In justice to<br />
those on fixed incomes and to the exporting industries<br />
which cannot pass on cost increases to their customers,<br />
action had to be taken. Our measures, unpleasant in<br />
themselves, have succeeded. During this year the<br />
increase in the Consumer Price Index first slowed down<br />
and then stopped. The September figures recently<br />
published showed an actual fall in the Index., 4e have,<br />
a-at the present time, met and defeated inflation.<br />
2. Our overseas reserves were running down at a<br />
disturbing rate. If that process had been allGoed to<br />
continue, Australia would not have been abLe to pay for<br />
her imports. Our economic measures gradually :* ut back<br />
the volume of imports, so that our overseas iLn. nds at<br />
the end of 19t-61 were much greater than t!; ey wre a<br />
year before. For the September 1961 quarte ( normally<br />
a slack season for exports) exports exceeded imports<br />
by no less than œ 36m. So the second problem was<br />
successfully dealt with,<br />
3. The third problem concerned the financing of public<br />
works in the States. These are of immense importance<br />
for the whole basis of industrial and community living.<br />
water, power, roads, schools, hospitals, and a host of<br />
other things. Under modern procedures created by my<br />
own Government, the States get the whole of the<br />
Government Loan raisings plus whatever the difference<br />
may be between those raisings and the approved<br />
programme the difference being financed by the<br />
( Common: ealth. The greater the shortage which the<br />
Commonwealth has to find, the greater the burden upon<br />
the taxpayers, and therefore the slower the rate of<br />
national progress. An inflationary boom is an<br />
adverse element in the public loan market, where<br />
people invest fixed sums of money at fixed rates of<br />
interest, The effect of our policies was shown in the<br />
latest Commonwealth Loan, which was heavily oversubscribed.<br />
These were all great results. As we achieved them, we<br />
reduced the emergency measures. The last survivor, the<br />
restrictions upon Bank Credit, came to an end, for all practical<br />
purposes, two weeks ago.<br />
The most discussed by-product of our policies has been<br />
come temporary unemployment.<br />
The employment position has, for some months, been<br />
steadily improving, and should continue to do so. Indeed, the<br />
latest official reports show a further marked reduction in those<br />
registered for employment, and a real increase in registered<br />
vacancies. It is a painful business to stop an inflationary boom.<br />
Some who have profited by the boom lose some of their business or<br />
profits. Some of their employees have to seek other employment.<br />
For the men and women so rendered temporarily unenployesd we<br />
have a profound sympathy. In spite of aggestions in some<br />
quarters, we have never forgotten or under-estimated their<br />
personal problem. Percentage statistics are of no comfort to<br />
them, though such statistics must be taken into account by<br />
governments responsible for the overall economic state of the </p>
<p>6,<br />
nation.. But we are continually concerned with the position-of<br />
the individual citizen. That concern is our greatest reason for<br />
political existence. Our special financial provisions in recent<br />
months show that our objective is the useful employment of all<br />
who are willing and able to work. ie can point with pride. to the<br />
fact that there has never been a period of 12 years in the<br />
history of Australia when employment was so high, when so much<br />
development occurred, and wrhen true living standards rose so much.<br />
Our opponents magnify the employment problem for<br />
election purposes, It will be for you to decide whether you<br />
believe that business prosperity, employment opportunities,<br />
capital investment, national growth and international trade will<br />
be greater -ider a Socialist administration.<br />
I said " socialist" and I mean it. The A. L. P. will<br />
" pipe down" on it for the next three weeks. They do not want<br />
you to remember that the Socialist policy, in action, would<br />
bring about such confusion in private industry, and such<br />
distrust in the minds of investors, both overseas and at home,<br />
that unemployment would increase heavily and the national<br />
progress would be halted. This is no theory on my part. Only in<br />
June 1961, one Labour Member, the brightest feather in the<br />
A. L. P's left wing, already an elected member of Labour's front<br />
bench, had this to say<br />
" How can economic power be transferred? This is the real<br />
question. Broadly, the answer is by controls, by public<br />
enterprise, and by nationalisation."<br />
My troubled opponent, the Leader of the Opposition,<br />
cries for Constitutional amendments which will enable this<br />
objective to be achieved.<br />
The truth is that our opponents are professional<br />
pessimists. We believe that the national economy is healthy, that<br />
there is no reason for pessimism, and that the greatest enemies<br />
of future progress are those who prophesy disaster and try to<br />
persuade you that a depression is just anund the corner. Such<br />
foolish people are not those who have built Australia or who have<br />
a proper understanding of its future.<br />
Australia is one of the 10 leading trading nations. ; e<br />
generate a great demand for imports, most of which are materials<br />
and plant for local manufacturing, : 4e pay for these by our<br />
exports and other moneys secured abroad. Because of our major<br />
dependence on primary exports, our balances of payments tend to<br />
vary sharply with world prices or seasonal conditions at home.<br />
Such variations sometimes give rise to Government measures which<br />
you, and we, find irritating and disturbing.<br />
Yet such problems will continue to occur unless we can<br />
increase our exports and diversify their character, with a<br />
growing emphasis upon manufactured and processed goods, the<br />
prices of which do not, as a rule, fluctuate wildly,<br />
Agricultural and pastoral products will for years continue to<br />
predominate in our export earnings; we will do all in our power<br />
to stimulate their efforts; but until -we increase and vary our<br />
exports we will have periodical balance of payment troubles,<br />
Je created a special Department of Irade five years<br />
ago. It has already achieved remarkable success. </p>
<p>At-the Commonwealth Conference at Montreal my colleague<br />
Mr.-McEwen, gave outstanding leadership in moves to persuade the<br />
great industrial countries to join in schemes for stabilising<br />
the world prices of export commodities such as wheat and sugar<br />
and other bulk commodities of which Australia is not an exporter.<br />
These efforts were strongly reinforced by Mr. Holt on his recent<br />
important mission abroad. Je will continue our efforts in the<br />
commodities field, and can see signs of progress.<br />
Meanwhile, our policy of export expansion continues.<br />
We have expanded ouir Trade Commissioner services, opening<br />
successful new posts in over 20 new places in all continents.<br />
Tne Trade publicity vote has increased 60 times. de have<br />
instituted . Lie Export Payments Insurance Corporation, which<br />
already insures transactions into no less than 120 countries. We<br />
have provided substantial tax incentives to the export of<br />
manufactures. Je have organised and are organising major trade<br />
or survey missions. Studies by the Export Development Council and by trade<br />
consultants suggest that there are promising prospects for<br />
increasing exports by establishing Australian warehouses in<br />
selected markets overseas. The Government will examine, in<br />
conjunction with interested exporters, whether practical metods<br />
can be devised to enable these additional export facilities to<br />
be developed. The -overnarent will of course continue its policy of<br />
protecting economic and efficient Australian industry through the<br />
Australian Tariff Board.<br />
However, we do not regard the present tariff system as<br />
static. During 1960 the Government created means for providing<br />
temporary tariffs for industries which might otherwise be<br />
seriously damaged pending normal review and report by the Tariff<br />
Board. It will also examine possible ways of overcoming the<br />
particular difficulties of certain Australian industries where<br />
production efficiency and a reasonable cost level require the<br />
maintenance of a continuing high volume of output.<br />
In all these dynamic processes, re rely upon the<br />
encouragement of individual effort and investment. True, we<br />
continue to be participants in great programmes of public works.<br />
3ut such programmes do not restrict private enterprise; on the<br />
contrary, they provide the essentials without which private<br />
enterprise could not expand.<br />
Jhat does the Labour Party offer you in exchange for<br />
these principles and ideas?<br />
It wants to solve balance of payment problems, not by<br />
increasing our export earnings but by licensing imports. That<br />
system, which is applicable only when balance of payments<br />
problems render it unavoidable, is in its nature arbitrary and<br />
bureaucratic. The Labour Party would also, it appears, use<br />
arbitrary import licensing to afford temporary protection to<br />
industries threatened by imports. Je prefer the scientific<br />
fixing of tariffs by the system to which I have referred.<br />
Labour has already made it clear, by its astonishing<br />
list of financial . romises, that it believes in inflationary<br />
finance, for which wo will all pay,, It exhibits hostility to<br />
capital investment from overseas, and even to Government<br />
borrowing abroad. Such a crazy policy ignores the needs of a<br />
growing country with a limited population. </p>
<p>8,<br />
The record private capital inflow of recent years has<br />
greatly-helped industrial expansion.. and employment. But we -mus t<br />
not get into the habit of depending upon it to correct a<br />
deficiency of exports. , Je must develop our own country and its<br />
resources as fast as we can. must have stable government.<br />
Investment from overseas will be attracted by stable government<br />
and a sound economy, but could easily dry up if w. e produced an<br />
unstable government and wild financial measures.<br />
Je are sometimes chided by our opponents for having no<br />
" independent foroi: i olicy". If this means that australia ought<br />
to become a " neutral" or " unaligned" power, offering advice to<br />
all and owing obligations to none, then my government rejects it<br />
out of hana. We have great responsibilities for the safety and<br />
future of Australia, and intend to discharge them.<br />
But if the accusation means that, while looking to the<br />
great democratic powers for help and protection, we should not<br />
accept loyal engagements with them we equally reject the<br />
conception. International arrangements for mutual defence give<br />
rise to duties as well Es rights; we must be partners, not<br />
passive dependents. It is for these reasons that my own<br />
government, with no audible approval by the Opposition, has<br />
pursued a foreign policy of the most constructive kind. 4e have<br />
actively promoted, and become parties to the ANZUS PACT with the<br />
U. S. A. and New Zealand; to SEATO, with Great Britain, U. S. A.,<br />
France, New Zealand, Pakistan, Thailand, and the Philippines.<br />
These have added positive elements to whatever protection is<br />
afforded by our membership of the United Nations.<br />
I really wish that we knew where the A. L. P. stands on<br />
these matters. Take what we are doing in Defence, where our<br />
forces and equipment, added to a massive Research and<br />
Development programme in such matters as guided missiles, are at<br />
the greatest peak of preparation we have ever seen in time of<br />
peace. Labour would substantially reduce the Defence vote. i<br />
regard adequate defence prevision as a vital element in foreign<br />
policy. We cannot live comfortably without such agreements of<br />
mutual security and protection as ANZUS and SE-D?, to say nothing<br />
of our oldest, most durable, and most tested association with<br />
Great Britain and the other 3ritish countries. We will not only<br />
honour our obligations; we will preserve our capacity to do so.<br />
For some years to come. c overseas problems will have<br />
immense significance for Australia.<br />
Communist threats and aggression are more violent than<br />
at any other time since the dar. The arrogance and wickedness of<br />
the recent Soviet nuclear and thermo-nuclear explosions has<br />
produced an atmosphere of crisis and danger. It seems certain<br />
that these acts are deliberate attempts at terrorising both the<br />
WIest and the newernations of Africa and Asia, and by threat<br />
extending the ColmmunisL zone of influence in those continents.<br />
Much coolness :: nd firmness will be required of Great<br />
Britain, the and the dlestern European powers with those<br />
others like Australia, who are their friends and allies.<br />
This is certainly no time to choose to have the voice<br />
of Australia expressed by a Party as divided, as pushed around by<br />
its left win;, as ambiguous even about Communist Unity Tickets in<br />
Union elections, as the present A. L. P.<br />
There are grave threats to the peace in South-.-st<br />
Asia, with Laos in a state of Communist inspired civil war and<br />
South Vietnam undr almost open Communist attack. One Co-mmunist<br />
victory would lead to another, and we could w! ell become isolated </p>
<p>9.<br />
unless we maintain the strong and effective alliances in S. E. A. T. O<br />
and A. N. Z. U. S. to which I have referred. Yet I cannot recall the<br />
Labour Party saying a good ord about either.<br />
There is also the great matter of the proposed entry of<br />
Great Britain into the European Common Market, involving<br />
negotiations in which the trading positbn of many Australian<br />
industries is deeply involved. I have already explained the<br />
Government's views in some detail in Parliament and elsewhere,<br />
All I need say tonight is that we h-ve had oxpert officials in<br />
London, in close conference with the United Kingdom for some<br />
time; that we have Cabinet Committee and an official committee<br />
regularly meeting in Australia; that I myself am in regular<br />
communicatin with Mr. Macmillan; that we are seeking to<br />
establish wa;. and means of securing an Australian voice on<br />
appropriate occasions when our special interests are involved,<br />
The time will certainly come, nobody c-n say how soon, when<br />
Australian Ministers will need to go abroad to battle for the<br />
Australian export industries and lend weight to the efforts of<br />
our British friends. We are not novices. We are not unknown to<br />
the leaders of other coLatries or their senior adviscrs, We<br />
have, we hope, achieved some special capacity to influence<br />
overseas thought and decision.<br />
You will decide whether you wrant to dismiss us from<br />
these matters and entrust them to our opponents.<br />
As a Government, and as two Parliamentary parties, we<br />
have a membership more closely identified with rural industry<br />
than our opponents can hope to have. Of all the members of the<br />
House of Representatives who represent rural electorates over<br />
three quarters sit in or behind the present Government.<br />
We have strongly supported rising rural production.<br />
During our term the sheep population has risen by 40 millions.<br />
Wool production has increased 50%, meat by 33%, sugar by<br />
Farm life has been assisted by our provision for a<br />
special depreciation allowance of 20% per annum on farm<br />
employees' housing. IWhei this provision ends in June 1962, we<br />
propose to renew it for a further period of five years.<br />
Wj'e will, of course, continue orderly marketing and<br />
stabilisation schemes in such industries as wheat, dairying,<br />
dried fruits, canned fruits, and e'gs. We have extended the<br />
present Sugar Agreement until May 1962, and will, when returned,<br />
negotiate another agreement with the Queensland Government. Je<br />
will negotiate further agreements with the Dairying Industry and<br />
the Wheat Industry. In Wool, we await the report of the Special<br />
Committee. Our guaran'ee to Cotton continues until 1963, when we<br />
will be prepared to consider an extension on terms to be<br />
negotiated. The Government will support an efficient tobacco<br />
growing industry. The objective of the policy will be to provide<br />
a market related to Australian demand and a satisfactory price to<br />
growers for Australian-grown leaf of a quality acceptable to<br />
Australian smokers.<br />
. e have had much to do with research schemes in wool,<br />
wheat, dairying, tobacco, beef and barley, and will devote<br />
increasing attention to extension services folloahg upon<br />
research. Our provision for C. S. I. R. O. has risen from œ 1.7m.<br />
in 1949 to œ 8.6m. in 1961-62. </p>
<p>I want to add something about the Commonwealth<br />
Development Bank. This was established to provide finance for<br />
the purpose of primary production and for the establishment or<br />
development of industrial undertakings, particularly small<br />
undertakings. It was to deal with cases ( such as those in which<br />
long-term finance was needed) in which bank finance would not<br />
other': ise be normally available. Particular attention was to be<br />
paid to the personal prospects of the borrower. Especially in<br />
the country, the function of the Development Bank is important as<br />
an addition to ordinary banking facilities. In our recent Budget<br />
we provided it with. an additional œ fn. of capital. From time to<br />
time we will take steps to review its capital position so that<br />
adequate funds may be available to it for its special but very<br />
important fI-ction.<br />
It is not always realised that, as a result of:<br />
increasing tax reimbursements for years, followed by<br />
the new and improved tax reimbursement formula<br />
unanimously adopted at the Premiers' Conference of<br />
1959, the substantial aid amounting to hundreds of<br />
millions over recen% years given by the Commonwealth<br />
out of its Budget to the S3ates Works programmes, and<br />
the large special grants made to Western Australia and<br />
Tasmania,<br />
the States are being greatly and increasingly assisted to find<br />
capital and current expenditure for primary and secondary<br />
education. State expenditure on these matters ( which are State<br />
matters) is large and rising.<br />
The Coimmonwealth Government has, in addition,<br />
voluntarily made many millions available for Universities,<br />
under the advice of the Universities Committee which we set up<br />
for this purpose. -We have also established a Special Committee<br />
to advise on the future of tertiary education in all its forms.<br />
Another Cormmittee, on medical training in teaching hospitals,<br />
has just made a report which we will study when the new<br />
Parliament has been elected. We have als. o assisted by a large<br />
provision of Commonwealth Scholarships and by educational tax<br />
deductions which are of great value to parents.<br />
Not one of us would wish to be thought unaware of the<br />
enormous importance of improved education in a country which is<br />
building for a great future. gg: re at deal is being done; far<br />
more than seemed possible only a few years ago. Beyond doubt,<br />
much more will need to be done as the years go on. My own<br />
Government, while quite opposed to any notion of transferring<br />
educational authority to the Commonwealth, has quite a unique<br />
record in Commonwealth assistance to education. No action, you<br />
will perhaps allow me to add, has given me personally a more<br />
lively satisfaction. The Government will continue its sympathetic and<br />
pr. actical interest to the limits of its capacity.<br />
I have already made a brief reference to our record on<br />
Social Services. The-e will be plenty of time during the<br />
campaign to dwell upon dramatic improvements in the Means Test,<br />
the great Scheme for Homes for the Aged, Medical and<br />
Pharmaceutical and Hospital Benefits, </p>
<p>11.<br />
But I do want to mention one specific matter. For<br />
years the Australian law has teen that, to qualify for anl age<br />
pension a person, whether Australian-born or not, must have<br />
lived in Australia continuously for 20 years.<br />
The great stream of migration since the Jar, so<br />
valuable to Australia, has produced its own problems. One of<br />
them has been that it is felt by elderly migrants, who have<br />
worked and paid taxes in Australia for long periods falling<br />
short of 20 years, that it is unreasonable that they should not<br />
qualify for age pension. , Je have examined this matter. lWe<br />
attach great impor': 2e-e to family migration, since it helps<br />
assimilation in the new country. de will legislate to reduce<br />
the 20 yea-s'period to 10. Naturalisation will, of course,<br />
continue to ' e a condition for those coming from foreign<br />
countries. Under the existing system of voting for the Senate,<br />
no government can hope for a large majority in that House, and<br />
every government may well be, from time to time, in a Senate<br />
minority even though hLndsomely returned in the ouse of<br />
Representatives. Yet the Senate has great powers. It can throw<br />
out a Budget, or refuse Supply; it can refuse to pass any<br />
legislation. If, therefore, you re-elect my government, but<br />
after July 1st, 1962, when the new Senators come in, the<br />
Government does not have a majority in the Senate, the nation's<br />
legislation and finances will be at the mercy of the very<br />
Opposition which you would have rejected in the House of<br />
Representatives The only way to avoid such an absurdity is to give us<br />
a majority in both Houses. If you do not, or if you vote<br />
informally for the Senate you will find that, instead of<br />
electing my own Government for three years, you will have<br />
elected it effectively for six months only. When in December<br />
1949 you sent us back into office in such a spectacular way. ve<br />
faces a hostile Senate. It took eighteen months of frustrationl<br />
and a Double Dissolution, before a legislative proposal approved<br />
by you could pass both Houses and go on to the Statute book.<br />
Your vote for the Senate is, therefore, vitale<br />
I have dwelt upon matters of high policy which await<br />
your decision. But a national election is not only a contest of<br />
policies. It is a contest of people.<br />
Under us, as your repeated choice, Australia has,<br />
beyond question, developed and prospered. Its growth over the<br />
last decade has been phenomenal, as nobody can fairly deny.<br />
Abroad, its credit stands higher than ever before in its history.<br />
it attracts in remarkable degree the practical interest of<br />
investors and industrialists. In into national councils, its<br />
voice is heard and respected. Its geographical isolation has<br />
been countered by growing and successful diplomatic contacts,<br />
and by international agreements.<br />
Can similar things be achieved by our divided and<br />
disorganised opponents, lacking experience, judgment, and<br />
standing? There may be some I find it hard to believe who<br />
would wish to see our foreign policy, our trade relations, our<br />
territorial responsibilities, our financial and economic affairs,<br />
put into the hands of our opponents.! But the remarkable fact is<br />
that, if elected, the Labour Ministers and Members of Parliament<br />
will not, if they obey their own rules, be in charge of these I </p>
<p>12.<br />
great affairs. They would have been elected by the people of<br />
Australia, and should therefor? have a single and clear<br />
responsibility to the people. 3ut the astonishing fact is that<br />
their duty will be to a non-elected not elected by you)<br />
outside body called the Federal Conference of the Australian<br />
Labour Party. Rule 1 of the A. L. P's Federal Conference says:<br />
" The Federal Conference of the Party shall be the supreme<br />
governing authority and policy making body and its<br />
decisions shall be binding upon all State Branches and<br />
affiliates thereto, and upon the Federal and State<br />
Parliamentar3 LTbour Parties and upon the Federal<br />
Executive". I0 would almost seem that at this election you are not<br />
in truth being asked by Labour to vote Mr. Calwell, and whoever<br />
now either nominally or actually supports him in Opposition, into<br />
power. You are being asked to hand over the international and<br />
national policies of Australia to the obscure but powerful<br />
gentlemen of the Federal Conference of the A. L. P! This is a<br />
complete denial of Parl amentary Democracy. It provides the<br />
final reason why we ask you to renew our mandate to go on<br />
building a great nation for a groat people. </p>
