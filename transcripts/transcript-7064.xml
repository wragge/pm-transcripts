EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
LAUNCH OF TENDERS FOR TASMAN-2<br />
OPTICAL FIBRE CABLE PROJECT<br />
CANBERRA 16 DECEMBER 1986<br />
I AM TODAY ANNOUNCING THE START OF A TENDERING PROCESS OF<br />
MAJOR SIGNIFICANCE TO AUSTRALIA. WITH THIS ANNOUNCEMENT,<br />
AUSTRALIA IS SET TO ENTER A NEW FIELD OF HIGH TECHNOLOGY<br />
INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT.<br />
THE PROJECT IS THE TASMAN-2 OPTICAL FIBRE CABLE SYSTEM A<br />
2,500 KILOMETRE SUBMARINE CABLE WHICH WILL INVOLVE CONTRACTS<br />
WORTH, ON PRESENT ESTIMATES, SOME 120 MILLION DOLLARS.<br />
BY 1991, THE SYSTEM WILL REVOLUTIONISE TELEPHONE AND DATA<br />
LINKS BETWEEN AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEALAND. BUT IT WILL ALSO<br />
POSITION AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRY TO GET A FOOT IN THE DOOR OF<br />
WHAT PROMISES TO BE A BILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRY: THE<br />
EXPANSION OF THE OPTICAL FIBRE NETWORK THROUGHOUT THE<br />
PACIFIC LATER IN THE 1990' S.<br />
TASMAN-2 IS A JOINT PROJECT OF THE OVERSEAS<br />
TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION AND THE NEW ZEALAND POST<br />
OFFICE. I HARDLY NEED TELL ANYONE HERE THAT THE<br />
TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY IS A POWERHOUSE OF ECONOMIC<br />
GROWTH. OVER THE LAST TWO DECADES, DEMAND FOR COMMUNICATION<br />
SERVICES HAS BEEN INCREASING BY MORE THAN 20 PER CENT EACH<br />
YEAR. THIS EXPONENTIAL GROWTH WILL PROBABLY FLATTEN OUT<br />
BUT, ALL THE SAME, BY THE END OF THE CENTURY, AUSTRALIAN<br />
BUSINESSES, GOVERNMENTS AND INDIVIDUALS ARE EXPECTED TO<br />
UTILISE 50 TIMES OUR CURRENT INTERNATIONAL CAPACITY IN<br />
GLOBAL COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS.<br />
INDEED, SUCH IS THE IMPORTANCE TO OUR ECONOMY OF<br />
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS THAT FAILURE TO PROVIDE THE<br />
CAPACITY TO MEET THIS DEMAND WOULD SERIOUSLY IMPAIR<br />
AUSTRALIA'S GROWTH AND ITS ABILITY TO PARTICIPATE IN THE<br />
GLOBAL ECONOMY, AS WELL AS WIPING OUT THE POTENTIAL FOR A<br />
NEW AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRY.<br />
TO MEET THIS FUTUPE DEMAND, OPTICAL FIBRE IS THE WAY TO GO.<br />
OPTICAL FIBRE IS AN EXTRAORDINARILY VERSATILE MEDIUM,<br />
OFFERING SECURE TRANSMISSION OF DATA, RELATIVE EASE OF<br />
I </p>
<p>REPAIR, AND ECONOMY OVER RELATIVELY SHORT INTERNATIONAL<br />
LINKS SUCH AS AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEALAND.<br />
ALL MAJOR TELECOMMUNICATIONS ENTITIES AROUND THE WORLD ARE<br />
COMMITTED TO PLANNING OR INSTALLING OPTICAL FIBRE CAPACITY<br />
FOR BOTH INTERNATIONAL AND DOMESTIC USE. IN AUSTRALIA,<br />
TELECOM IS DEVELOPING OPTICAL FIBRE LINKS IN BOTH SYDNEY AND<br />
MELBOURNE AND HAS PLANS FOR A CROSS-AUSTRALIA PROJECT.<br />
THESE ADVANTAGES MEAN THAT AUSTRALIAN COMPANIES WHICH TAKE<br />
UP THIS OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN TASMAN-2 WILL FACE A<br />
WIDE VISTA OF EXPORT OPPORTUNITY IN THE FUTURE.<br />
FOR WITHIN THE NEXT FEW YEARS, OTC PLANS TO EXTEND THE<br />
TASMAN-2 CABLE, WITH LINKS FIRST TO NORTH AMERICA, DUE FOR<br />
SERVICE IN 1993, AND THEN TO ASIA BY 1995. THE WHOLE SYSTEM<br />
THE PACIFIC OPTICAL FIBRE CABLE SYSTEM WILL BE THE<br />
LARGEST COMMUNICATIONS PROJECT OF ITS KIND IN THE WORLD, AND<br />
WILL CONFIRM AUSTRALIA'S PLACE AS ONE OF THE LARGEST<br />
OPERATORS OF UNDERSEA CABLE SYSTEMS.<br />
THUS A KEY FEATURE OF THESE TENDERS IS THE CALL FOR A<br />
SIGNIFICANT LEVEL OF LOCAL MANUFACTURING IN THE CABLE<br />
SYSTEM. OFFICIALS FROM OTC HAVE INFORMED ME OF THE STRONG LIKELIHOOD<br />
THAT THE NEW ZEALAND LINK AND THE FOLLOW-ON PACIFIC PROJECTS<br />
WILL PROVIDE WORK IN AUSTRALIA FOR THE NEXT DECADE, AND<br />
EQUIP THE CONTRACTORS TO COMPETE IN THE MULTI-BILLION DOLLAR<br />
INTERNATIONAL MARKET FOR OPTICAL FIBRE SYSTEMS.<br />
THIS PROJECT COMES AT A CRUCIAL TIME FOR THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
ECONOMY. THE BALANCE OF PAYMENT SITUATION, THOUGH IMPROVED<br />
IN THE NOVEMBER FIGURES, CONTINUES TO BE A MAJOR SOURCE OF<br />
CONCERN TO THE GOVERNMENT. A SIGNIFICANT COMPONENT OF THIS<br />
CONCERN COMES FROM THE DEFICIT IN THE TRADE IN SERVICES,<br />
WHICH LAST YEAR TOTALLED APPROXIMATELY $ 4 BILLION.<br />
IF AUSTRALIA IS TO TURN AROUND SOME OF THESE PROBLEMS<br />
EFFECTIVELY, IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO ENCOURAGE NEW AND<br />
INNOVATIVE SERVICES WHICH WE CAN SELL TO THE WORLD. THIS<br />
PROJECT SUGGESTS AN IMPORTANT MEANS TO THAT END BOTH IN<br />
ITS OWN RIGHT AND BY PROVIDING THE ALL-IMPORTANT<br />
COMMUNICATIONS TOOL TO OTHER AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES SEEKING<br />
TO COMPETE ABROAD.<br />
THROUGH TELECOM AND OTC BOTH PROUDLY OWNED BY ALL<br />
AUSTRALIANS WE HAVE ESTABLISHED THE BASIS OF A MAJOR NEW<br />
INDUSTRY. WITH THE DEVELOPMENTS IN UNDERSEA OPTICAL FIBRE<br />
CABLE, WE HAVE EVIDENCE THAT WE AREN'T ABOUT TO LET SLIP OUR<br />
POSITION AT THE FOREFRONT OF WORLD COMMUNICATIONS.<br />
THE PROJECT IS ALSO A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THE GOVERNMENT PUTTING<br />
ITS MONEY WHERE ITS MOUTH IS ON THE AUSTRALIAN MADE </p>
<p>3<br />
CAMPAIGN. WHEN AUSTRALIAN GOODS ARE COMPETITIVE IN PRICE<br />
AND QUALITY, WE WANT TO ENCOURAGE THEIR PURCHASE. WE DO IT<br />
OURSELVES, AND WE SEEK A SIMILAR POSITIVE RESPONSE FROM<br />
OTHER AUSTRALIAN COMPANIES AND CONSUMERS, TO DEMONSTRATE<br />
THEIR FAITH IN THE LOCAL PRODUCT.<br />
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,<br />
I REGARD THIS PROJECT AS ONE OF NATIONAL SIGNIFICANCE, AND I<br />
URGE AUSTRALIAN MANUFACTURERS TO SEIZE THE OPPORTUNITY TO<br />
PARTICIPATE IN IT. </p>
