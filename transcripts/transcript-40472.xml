    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong><br />
Australia mourns the passing of Shimon Peres - nation builder and peacemaker. His commitment to peace, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize, was as strong as his passion for the State of Israel, which he helped found and went onto lead.</p>
