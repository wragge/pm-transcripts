    <content><![CDATA[<p>On behalf of all Australians, Lucy and I congratulate Their Royal Highnesses The Duke and Duchess of Sussex on their marriage.</p>
<p>To mark this occasion, the Australian Government, on behalf of the people of Australia, will make a $10,000 contribution to Australian International Military Games Limited, a not-for-profit charity that will bring the Invictus Games to Australia this year.</p>
<p>The Invictus Games showcases the courage, resilience and determination of wounded veterans, while promoting the power of sport for recovery and rehabilitation.</p>
<p>We look forward to welcoming more than 500 competitors and 1000 family and friends from across the world to Sydney in October.</p>
<p>I am also pleased to announce we will gift the newlywed couple Akubra hats. Hand crafted in Kempsey, the iconic Akubra has been proudly worn by generations of Australians. Lucy and I hope that Their Royal Highnesses enjoy their truly Australian gifts.</p>
<p>Once again, congratulations on your marriage.</p>
<p>Australia wishes you long life and happiness together.</p>
