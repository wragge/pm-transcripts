PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF TIIE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP,<br />
DOORSTOP, 9 DECEMBER 1992<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
PM: I want to make some remarks to you about Dr Ilewson. What we've sccn in the<br />
last 24 hours is, I think, the death of a political leader. Dr ficwson said Australia<br />
needs these policies, I'll give you these policies that Australia needs. He is now<br />
saying we don't need these policies. I say, therefore it follows we don't need Dr<br />
Hcwson. Australia has no use for Dr liewson.<br />
He told us that he would resign, " I'll resign", he said, " if any of these policics<br />
change. I'm said to be inflexible, wcll I am. I'm not going to change. Fightback<br />
will not be amended. It stands firm".<br />
What you're seeing here is basically a politically-induced shift, a poll-induced<br />
shift, yct Dr Hewson had the hide to say this morning on AM, " I came to politics<br />
to do a job, I don't play the political game". Well, he's playing the political game<br />
and the political game is very much at the public's expense.<br />
Dr Ilewson said, " Fightback and I are inseparable". He implied if you fillet<br />
Fightback, you fillet him. Well he's filleted Fightback and he's probably filleted<br />
his backbone away with it.<br />
But the truth of the matter is, like all cynicism the Liberal Party has always<br />
displayed, you can take no notice of them. Whatever he says on the 18th would<br />
not be what they do in government. If there's any lesson out of any of this, it is<br />
whatcver he says it will not be as they would govern. Because in office hc would<br />
do cxactly the sort of things he wantcd to do just as Mr Kcnnett demonstrated he<br />
would do the kind of things which he wanted to do indicate to the public that he<br />
was listening, that he'd taken heed of their concerns, in Mr Kcnnett's case, and then<br />
procccdcd in the dead of night. Dr Hewson would do just the same. </p>

T'his is only a political exercise on his part to move away from the policy that he's<br />
had. After December 18 we'll still be left with the OST, a draconian industrial relations<br />
policy, zero tariffs and savage cuts to social security spending. Dr Hewson will be<br />
just as nasty and dangerous after the I 8th of December as he is today.<br />
The difference, perhaps, between him and Mr Howard is Mr Howard said very<br />
pointedly this morning, there'll be no changes to the IR policy. Meaning I'm<br />
standing my ground oven if my leader isn't standing his. He is demonstrating what<br />
he thinks leadership is all about.<br />
Dr Hcwson, in the most extravagant of phrases, has committed himself to not<br />
moving his policies. Those policies are going to shift. His commitments were<br />
worth nothing. And his commitments in office would be worth nothing. He<br />
would do to us just what he wanted to do, and cynically disregard commitments<br />
which he gave the public on the way through,<br />
What you are seeing is the Liberal Party and its Leader again in a state of<br />
accelerated decline.<br />
J: In the interests of Australia, why don't you just wait and see what he is proposing?<br />
PM: Because he hasn't had the courage to give you the changes that he is proposing.<br />
He has very weakly told you that he'll change his stance without telling you what<br />
it is. And so he calculates that the change in his position is then, in public terms,<br />
muted whilc you, members of the press, and the public wait to see what the detail<br />
of the changes are. Dr Hcwson's changc is today, it's not on the 18th of December,<br />
it's now.<br />
J. If hc exempts food though, Mr Keating, from the GST, doesn't that make him<br />
harder to beat?<br />
PM: If he exempts food the UJST revenue falls by $ 5 billion, if he zero rates clothing,<br />
fabric and footwear he removes a further $ 1.9 billion, if he zero rates the five<br />
essential household scrvices of gas, electricity, water, postage and telephone bills,<br />
that would reduce the GST by a further $ 1.3 billion. If he zero rates residential<br />
construct ion, that's housing, he would reduce the OST revenue by a further $ 1.8<br />
( billion). If he does those things, basically his policy has fallen to picces. The<br />
whole rationale for the policy is in tatters. So that being the case, I go back to the<br />
point I made earlier, if he's not going to give us the policies he says Australia<br />
needs, why do we need Dr Hewson?<br />
J: Mr Keating, on the basis of changes in circumstances, you changed economic<br />
policy direction in the One Nation Statemcnt. Why can't John Hewson do the<br />
same? </p>

PM; No, but hc said recently that he thought Australia was going to slip into a<br />
depression. He didn't indicate any need, in fact in thc Parliament he was<br />
reassrting that his policies were utterly correct. What the Government said was<br />
that policy wasn't correct, what I said was that policy wasn't correct, that the<br />
economy was slowing, this was last year, and that we needed a changc to fiscal<br />
policy. The Government was open about that. He was saying, in the context of<br />
this year, that we're actually slipping into a depression but was still standing by his<br />
policy. He shifted because of the polls. He made his arrangements with the Press<br />
Club yesterday, his Deputy Leader didn't even know that he'd made the<br />
arrangements. His front bench don't know of the details. rm quite sure that people<br />
like Mr Howard are seething over this.<br />
J: Are you sorry you didn't go on December 19, Prime Minister?<br />
PM: No, I think I'm not treating the public with the cynicism the Liberal Party has<br />
always treated thc public with, and which they continue in thcir finest traditions to<br />
do today.<br />
J: it was a bit of misjudgment, wasn't it?<br />
PM: Well, I think you better leave the judgements about political timing rve got two<br />
right middle of 1987 and Fcbruary 1990 not bad going.<br />
1: Doesn't this at least show that Dr Howson is now flexible, that he is listening to<br />
people's concerns?<br />
PM: Dr Hewson is looking at his political skin. I think he feared thc Parliament coming<br />
back for two days and wanted to pre-empt his colleagues by not walking into the<br />
Caucuas room without any policy shift, or without any shift in his stance, knowing<br />
that his position in the polls is deteriorating. He's made the pre-emptive move, the<br />
Liberal IParty have got to decide now whether they stick with him. He's promised<br />
to resign. He said if the policies change, I go. Well he ought to make good his<br />
commitment.<br />
1: Will your Government now start looking at some possible policy changes? Ron<br />
Boswell was saying this morning that the Liberals should now look at tariffs. Will<br />
the Government be looking at tariffs?<br />
PM: The point is you sce, that's what I'm saying the Liberal Party is now..<br />
The tight policy stance, all the policies we've been told we needed are all up for<br />
grabs the National Party is now trying to change the tariff policy, the Liberal<br />
Party is shifting on its basic Fightback package, you've got obviously a leadership<br />
tension there with Mr Howard saying ' I'm standing firm on industrial relations'.<br />
All It means is, I go back to my opening words, Dr Hewson is a leader who I think<br />
is now useless to Australia.<br />
ends </p>
