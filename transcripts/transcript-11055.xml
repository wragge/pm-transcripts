    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE.............</p>
<p>  Well ladies and gentlemen, today I'm releasing the final report of the Productivity</p>
<p>   Commission into the gambling industry. And in responding to that report</p>
<p>   the Federal Government has as its main objective to strike a balance between</p>
<p>   on the one hand recognising the very understandable desire of Australians</p>
<p>   to gamble and recognising their undoubted right to do so, with the ongoing</p>
<p>   responsibility of the Federal Government and the State governments to address</p>
<p>   the community welfare aspects of problem gambling.</p>
<p>  Gambling of course is part and parcel of the Australian way of life and</p>
<p>   it is not the desire of the Government to adopt a censorious or negatively</p>
<p>   prohibitive attitude towards the ordinary desire of Australians to indulge</p>
<p>   themselves in the pleasure and the recreation of gambling. But side by side</p>
<p>   with that there must be a recognition that excessive gambling blights the</p>
<p>   lives of tens of thousands of Australians and their families ever year.</p>
<p>   And the Productivity Commission report has crystallised the extent to which</p>
<p>   this now assumes the dimension of quite a significant social problem. And</p>
<p>   our desire is to strike that balance, to recognise the right of people to</p>
<p>   gamble, but at the same time to discharge the responsibilities of governments</p>
<p>   to tackle what has now become a very significant problem. And perhaps I</p>
<p>   can best highlight the dimension of that problem by quoting very briefly</p>
<p>   from the findings of the Productivity Commission report. And it says problem</p>
<p>   gamblers comprise 15% of regular non-lottery gamblers, and account for about</p>
<p>   $3.5 billion in expenditure annually - about one-third of the gambling industry's</p>
<p>   market. They lose on average $12,000 a year compared with just under $650</p>
<p>   a year for other gamblers. And the report goes on elsewhere to say that</p>
<p>   policy approaches for the gambling industries need to be directed at reducing</p>
<p>   the costs of problem gambling through harm minimisation and prevention measures</p>
<p>   while retaining as much of the benefit to recreational gamblers as possible.</p>
<p>  And the Government finds itself very much in sympathy with that balanced</p>
<p>   goal and that balanced finding. We don't want in any way to interfere with</p>
<p>   the recreational aspects of people pursuing gambling where it is clearly</p>
<p>   not a problem for them. But we do in cooperation and conjunction with the</p>
<p>   Sate governments, and with the gambling industry generally, we do have a</p>
<p>   responsibility at a national level to try and strike that balance and to</p>
<p>   try and address some of the difficulties that are posed for people who have</p>
<p>   become problem gamblers.</p>
<p>  This is not an easy task and I don't pretend for a moment that the Productivity</p>
<p>   Commission report has provided all of the answers, or what I've announced</p>
<p>   today, particularly the decision of the Government to propose a ministerial</p>
<p>   council to deal with gambling, comprised of representatives of the Commonwealth</p>
<p>   Government and the States. But it is I think a challenge that all governments</p>
<p>   around Australia will join the Commonwealth in trying to meet because we</p>
<p>   do recognise that we have a broader social responsibility beyond endorsing</p>
<p>   the undoubted right of Australians to engage in and derive pleasure from</p>
<p>   gambling.</p>
<p>  Traditionally of course the regulation of gambling activities has been the</p>
<p>   responsibility of the Sates and Territories. We don't have any particular</p>
<p>   desire to disturb that or to change that. We do however recognise that we</p>
<p>   do have a leadership role to coordinate a national response, and most specifically</p>
<p>   in relation to one aspect, that is gambling on the internet, the Commonwealth</p>
<p>   Government has a direct and very clear constitutional and legal responsibility.</p>
<p>   One of the first tasks of the Ministerial Council will be to examine the</p>
<p>   feasibility and the consequences of prohibiting gambling on the Internet.</p>
<p>   The capacity for gambling to proliferate and spread because of the use of</p>
<p>   the Internet only has to be stated to be obvious. The United States is presently</p>
<p>   considering two pieces of legislation, the American Congress, that will</p>
<p>   bring about such a prohibition in the United States. And various legislative</p>
<p>   and regulatory responses around the world are now being addressed by governments.</p>
<p>  I'm not today announcing, nor am I foreshadowing that a decision to prohibit</p>
<p>   gambling on the Internet, what I'm announcing is that one of the first tasks</p>
<p>   of the Ministerial Council will be to examine the feasibility and the consequences.</p>
<p>  I commend to all people who are concerned to achieve a balance in social</p>
<p>   policy a careful study of the Productivity Commission's final report. The</p>
<p>   draft report that came out in July generated an enormous amount of interest.</p>
<p>   It unveiled a lot of material, some of which was perhaps I guess perceived</p>
<p>   by many Australians to be there, but we haven't quite had the full detail</p>
<p>   and the full dimension until the report. And the final report represents</p>
<p>   not only a continuation of many of the findings of the draft report, but</p>
<p>   also a distillation with it of the responses to that draft report. And it</p>
<p>   represents the first really comprehensive analysis of the gambling industry</p>
<p>   in Australia. I think it's a very balanced attempt to strike the right pitch</p>
<p>   between the rights of people to gamble, the recognition of its role as part</p>
<p>   of the social fabric of Australia, but also to recognise that those who</p>
<p>   have a problem do experience in many cases a total blighting of their lives.</p>
<p>   The analysis of the tendency to suicide, job loss, family breakdown, family</p>
<p>   depravation, all of the other things that attend the lives of the almost</p>
<p>   300,000 people identified by the report as being problem gamblers in Australia.</p>
<p>   I think it makes very interesting and very compelling reading.</p>
<p>  So I release the report. I announce our initial response. I foreshadow what</p>
<p>   the Government will pursue in cooperation with the State and Territory governments</p>
<p>   of Australia, and endeavour in terms of the report to achieve a balanced</p>
<p>   response. I don't predict that we're going to make early gains. I do however</p>
<p>   find within the Australian community a belief that although gambling is</p>
<p>   part of our life and will and should remain so, that it has probably gone</p>
<p>   far enough and there should be attempts to help people who are suffering</p>
<p>   a problem from it, and there should also be attempts to curb any further</p>
<p>   expansion and proliferation of gambling facilities. And I look forward to</p>
<p>   the cooperation of State and Territory governments in dealing with that</p>
<p>   change. Any questions?</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Prime Minister, you have mentioned here that there is to be a further range</p>
<p>   of measures in the press release [inaudible]..Can you just tell us something</p>
<p>   about that?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well I think the purpose of the point of that reference was to indicate</p>
<p>   that in all of the social welfare programs where we can incorporate further</p>
<p>   advice and education against the.in relation to the impact of problem gambling</p>
<p>   we'll do so and we'll do so in a way that that information filters through</p>
<p>   to different sections of the community which are highlighted at the bottom</p>
<p>   of that paragraph.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Prime Minister, one of the huge problems have been the proliferation of</p>
<p>   poker machines, particularly in New South Wales. Is there any kind of legislation</p>
<p>   down the track that might look at cutting back on the number..</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well we don't have the power to do that. And as I said, it remains principally</p>
<p>   the responsibility of the States. We have a role at a national level to</p>
<p>   coordinate a national response. We want to involve all of the State and</p>
<p>   Territory governments. We have particular responsibility in relation to</p>
<p>   the Internet. We have now provided the States of Australia with a taxation</p>
<p>   system that removes their major excuse for a continued reliance on gambling,</p>
<p>   and that is as a source of taxation revenue. Now over time as the GST comes</p>
<p>   in and provides a growing source of revenue for the States, we are answering</p>
<p>   that criticism that's been made in the past. And it's not a criticism that</p>
<p>   I've necessarily accepted. But once the GST is up and running the States</p>
<p>   will have a growing source of tax revenue and therefore there'll be a greater</p>
<p>   capacity to reduce the dependence on gambling taxation.</p>
<p>  I think the achievable goal ought to be for all governments to put a limit</p>
<p>   on the expansion of gambling facilities, and to try and help in different</p>
<p>   ways people who have become problem gamblers. If we can at least together</p>
<p>   do those two things over the next couple of years we will have achieved</p>
<p>   a lot.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  The Commissioner actually said that internet gaming provided a great opportunity</p>
<p>   for Australians [inaudible]. Do you think Australia will miss an opportunity</p>
<p>   if it limits internet gambling.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well that's one of the things that needs to be taken into account. As I've</p>
<p>   said we're not announcing an intention to do it. We're announcing an intention</p>
<p>   to examine the feasibility and the consequences. I think there'll be different</p>
<p>   views around the community. I think some of the territory governments will</p>
<p>   have some concerns, others will not have a concern, and we will follow what</p>
<p>   others are doing particularly in the United States.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Prime Minister, what's going to be the role of industry.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  I beg your pardon.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  What's going to be the role, if any, of the gambling industry?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well the gambling industry should feel that it will be part of helping governments</p>
<p>   find a sensible solution to the problem areas. They all have an interest</p>
<p>   in helping problem gamblers. They all have an interest in making sure that</p>
<p>   it remains first and foremost a recreational pursuit within the financial</p>
<p>   capacity of all of those who participate. And as far as I'm concerned I</p>
<p>   would want to enlist the aid and the understanding of people involved in</p>
<p>   the industry.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  So are you talking about with the council? I guess as the council looks</p>
<p>   as this issue you'll be involving the industry..</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, that council would involve the industry I imagine. They wouldn't be</p>
<p>   members of it because it's a government, it's a ministerial council. But</p>
<p>   we don't set out to put ourselves at arms length from the industry. What</p>
<p>   we are saying to the gambling industry is there is a problem with a section</p>
<p>   of the community. Everyone knows that and most Australians are concerned</p>
<p>   about it. The impact on families and children, on the poor, on small business</p>
<p>   is very clear so far as problem gambling is concerned. And nobody can deny</p>
<p>   that and this report gives a very detailed analysis of that. So what we</p>
<p>   have got to do together is try and reduce the damage that is being done</p>
<p>   in that area whilst preserving the industry in a perfectly legitimate way</p>
<p>   and recognising the contribution it makes to the enjoyment of life of so</p>
<p>   many hundreds of thousands of Australians.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Would you support the limit on the advertising and promotion of gambling,</p>
<p>   for example, or the running of education campaigns to specifically describe</p>
<p>   the odds..</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, I think anything that increases the volume of information available</p>
<p>   to people who gamble about the odds should be supported. I am always reluctant</p>
<p>   to support advertising, put bans on advertising of products which are legal</p>
<p>   although we have in our society a number of examples of where we allow substances</p>
<p>   to be sold but we put severe limits on their advertising. But they are the</p>
<p>   sort of compromises that I guess any democratic society makes but I would</p>
<p>   be open to examine that. But I am never attracted to too many restraints</p>
<p>   on the right of people to advertise their goods or services subject to community</p>
<p>   taste and subject, of course, to the information being accurate and also</p>
<p>   the information they are conveying perhaps more information about the odds</p>
<p>   than is currently the case.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Prime Minister, given that gambling is primarily a State responsibility</p>
<p>   has there been any [inaudible] reactions from..</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  I beg your pardon, any what?</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Has there been any reaction from the States to.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, I haven't spoken to them. I am writing to the Premiers and Chief Ministers</p>
<p>   today with my proposal about a ministerial council. But I don't think any</p>
<p>   of them should be the least bit critical in their reaction to this. I mean,</p>
<p>   we are proposing a logical process for trying to achieve that balance. We</p>
<p>   are not coming in in a heavy-handed censorious way and saying you shall</p>
<p>   not do this or do that. We are recognising that people will gamble. It's</p>
<p>   part of our life. But we are also recognising that for a small but nonetheless</p>
<p>   significant minority it's devastating, it destroys their lives. But all</p>
<p>   of us have a responsibility to try and help and to find a solution or at</p>
<p>   least ameliorate the problem and that is basically what we are seeking out</p>
<p>   to do.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Prime Minister, you mentioned the problem of internet gambling but why is</p>
<p>   it intrinsically different, for example, to the problem of gambling over</p>
<p>   the telephone?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, I guess the expansion, the capacity to expand and proliferate would</p>
<p>   be one reason why some might see it as intrinsically different. But I go</p>
<p>   back to what I said earlier, we haven't made a decision on that but it's</p>
<p>   something that we are putting on the table for examination. The point you</p>
<p>   make will obviously be in the minds of some.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Do you have concerns about the way the States have handled their responsibilities</p>
<p>   in relation to gambling?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, I want to engage the cooperation of the States and my starting point</p>
<p>   is to say to them: look, we have a clear problem with a section of the community,</p>
<p>   it's our obligation as good governments concerned about the overall welfare</p>
<p>   of the community to try and deal with that problem and to reduce its incidence.</p>
<p>   And the best way to get the cooperation of people in relation to that is</p>
<p>   to adopt a cooperative, positive, conciliatory approach rather than a finger</p>
<p>   pointing admonishing approach.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  [Inaudible] financial relationship between the industry, is that a problem</p>
<p>   as far as you are concerned, the fact that they get a lot of income from</p>
<p>   the gambling industry..</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  The States?</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Yeah, the States.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, that's a factor for them to take into account but I would say earlier</p>
<p>   to you that one of the beaut things about the GST is that over time it will</p>
<p>   reduce the dependence of the States on other forms of taxation because it's</p>
<p>   a growth tax.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Do you still feel ashamed about the number of poker machines in Australia?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Yes, I do.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Prime Minister, the 300,000 problem gamblers in Australia. Australians have</p>
<p>   always gambled from the time of colonisation. The only thing different now</p>
<p>   from the 1950s and [inaudible] is that back in the '50s you had to..</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  It was harder to do it.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  It was so much more restricted. You now have..I spoke to a widow a couple</p>
<p>   of days ago whose husband had [inaudible]..pub on every corner with poker</p>
<p>   machines. Well, back in the '50s in the innocent days you couldn't do that,</p>
<p>   you had to go and sneak around to the SP bookmaker. Surely this increase,</p>
<p>   the..of gamblers is simply a reflection of the growing access to gambling</p>
<p>   facilities?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, I mean, I don't presume to be an expert on the "innocent days".</p>
<p>   But can I say that the point you make sounds common sense to me that part</p>
<p>   of the problem is the proliferation of gambling opportunities. And that</p>
<p>   is why I said a few minutes ago that if you could achieve two things, if</p>
<p>   you could put a limit on the expansion of facilities. I may have mentioned</p>
<p>   some time ago, days ago I had a proposal put to me that we should allow</p>
<p>   gambling on international flights and I said that the Government wouldn't</p>
<p>   support that. Every day virtually proposals come forward for a new form.</p>
<p>   Perhaps we have reached a point where we have enough and at the very least</p>
<p>   if we can stop the proliferation of further opportunities and address particular</p>
<p>   personal and behavioural problems of those who can be classified as problem</p>
<p>   gamblers then you might make a modest but important contribution.</p>
<p>  Now, I am not setting the high jump bar too high on this, it's going to</p>
<p>   be very difficult. But what we are doing today for the first time is to</p>
<p>   recognise the Government does, at a federal level, the Commonwealth does</p>
<p>   have a leadership role. I hope all of the States irrespective of their political</p>
<p>   colour will involve themselves in this process.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Are any extra funds earmarked at the federal level at this stage?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, it's too early to start talking about funds, just too early.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Prime Minister, [inaudible] report at the Victorian University [inaudible].</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  About the pokies?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  The one that says that a certain amount a week has been lost? Yeah, I read</p>
<p>   a press report about it.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  .saying that income money that is coming out of that [inaudible] gambling.</p>
<p>   It seems to be saying that in the poorest parts of Australia [inaudible]..</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, that could well be the case. I have no doubt that small businesses</p>
<p>   in many of the less well off areas of Australia have suffered very badly</p>
<p>   as a result of gambling excesses.</p>
<p>  Thank you.</p>
