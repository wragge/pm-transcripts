PRIME MINISTER<br />
EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
VICTORIAN ALP CONFERENCE<br />
MELBOURNE 23 AUGUST 1987<br />
You have done mn a great honour by presenting me with this<br />
badge reprecenting my forty years as a member of the<br />
Auctralian Labor ? arty.<br />
Forty yoaro ago I was a student at the University of Western<br />
Australia aod became the foundation President of the<br />
University ALP Club.<br />
The decisi'o to join the Party was probably the easiest<br />
political docscion I have over made. I had parents who had<br />
instilled in me a deep sense of the social values which the<br />
Labor Part' represented. E had an uncle who was a Labor<br />
member o≈ì the Western Auotralian State Parliament, who went<br />
on to become Premier. And I had before me the example of<br />
that greet ' ootern Australian Prime Minister, John Curtin.<br />
John Curtin had led the nation through the supreme challenge<br />
of war and his successor Bon Chifley was setting about<br />
rebuilding and reorganising the Australian nation to meet<br />
the challenge of peacetime.<br />
So in that decade of unprecedented challenges for the<br />
nation, La. or was providing leaders of strength and wisdom;<br />
Labor was providing and successfully applying policies of<br />
relevance and farsighted vision; and, accordingly, Labor was<br />
repeatedly receiving from the Australian people their<br />
support end their trust to manage the responsibilities of<br />
Federal Government.<br />
And not juGt the Federal Government. In August 1947 Labor<br />
had just Aost office in Western Australia but was still in<br />
office in four other States including of course Victoria,<br />
under th. capable leadership of Premier John Cain.<br />
Forty yoarc later, Labor again holds office throughout the<br />
nation in Canberra, Melbourne, Sydney, Adelaide and Perth.<br />
we are again implementing relevant and vital policies, again<br />
providing leadership and, as July 11 proved most decisively,<br />
we are again receiving the trust of the people.<br />
That victory last month confirmed for me, in the deepest and<br />
most personal sense, the faith that first inspired me to<br />
join tho ALP forty years ago. () 000620 </p>
<p>2.<br />
Xt gave me new hope that our work as a Party and a<br />
Government will inspire young people today to share our<br />
idealc and vision and hard work, by joining our ranks as<br />
membeos. This iG the first major address I have given since that<br />
election. It is appropriate, and indeed I deeply wish to<br />
take this opportunity to exproos publicly my gratitude to<br />
all thoa Party members who devoted their efforts to the<br />
task of returning the Government.<br />
It is pa: ticularly fitting that I pay this tribute in<br />
Victoria for any analysis of the voting figures reveals<br />
that Victoria contributed hugely to our success on July 11.<br />
In the jouo of Reprosentatives, Victoria registered the<br />
highoot ( wo-party proferred vote for Labor of any State in<br />
the naton; and in the Senate too, Victoria registered<br />
Labor'es ighoet vote of any State.<br />
Parts of Melbourne and of rural Victoria which the<br />
concorvativce once counted among the jewels in the crown of<br />
Libcrali. c we have now won and held at three successive<br />
electionc and that is a tribute to your hard work and<br />
dedication and to that of our branch officials over the<br />
years. It's a pcrticular tribute to the work of our outgoing<br />
Presidnt, Gerry Hand, who has been an effective and popular<br />
leader c the State branch. I will of course be working<br />
closely with Gerry over the next few years in his new<br />
capacity as Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, and I know that<br />
he is leaving the Branch in safe hands under the Presidency<br />
of Go'ff Bird.<br />
But oven more important than the partisan fruits of victory<br />
is the neaning of our success on July 11 for the whole<br />
nation. July 1I was not only a victory for the Australian Labor<br />
Party but a victory for the whole Australian nation.<br />
The choice on July 11 was a choice between moving forward,<br />
together as a nation, to fulfil our great potential, or<br />
sacrificing that potential and sliding backwards into the<br />
past. It was a choice between equipping the nation for the task of<br />
reconstruction or sacrificing the gains we had already made<br />
on the altar of the politics of greed and division.<br />
By refusing to be bribed, by choosing instead the realistic<br />
path of hard work towards the goal of economic<br />
reconstruction and job security, the Australian people again<br />
demonstrated their faith that Labor has the capacity to<br />
formulate and implement policies for the lasting prosperity<br />
of all Australians. </p>
<p>In deraonotrating that faith, the Auctralian people have also<br />
offerod Lo'.-or an historicallyj , Important mandate.<br />
Our oppononto arc busily pcddling the myth that the aloction<br />
outcomo x-yapzu rely a verdict on their own disunity.<br />
It is cer-tzinly true that their pgofound divisions and their<br />
disastrousr~ policy prescriptions completely involidatod the<br />
conservativez' claims to essure the responcibilitieo of<br />
office. But lot us not forget the bZsic fact of July 11 -we won the<br />
election we tron it on our own merito.<br />
We won it 1because of our unity and strength.<br />
lie won it because of our auperior campaign effort.<br />
We won 4. t, mozt importantly of all, because we had proven wo<br />
had the zn. awerz to the real challenges facing the nation.<br />
So the Th~ lrd Termu iG not about recting on our laurels, or<br />
allowinc' our roforming spirit to flag, or pretending that<br />
the worli began during our, 2irst two terlns ic complete.<br />
We ashed the Australian people to atick together and to coo<br />
it through.<br />
They r-copondod, wyith the clearest affirmation, and gave us<br />
theiir n : nClato to finioh the tash we have begun.<br />
It iG a n-andate to work to the beet of our abilities<br />
refachion-Ing our economic structures, meeting the challenges<br />
of the acui world economic environment, maxioising jobs<br />
growth arnd cecuring our prosperity for the future.<br />
It io a mindato to ensure to the best of our abilities the<br />
fairness and compassion of Auetralian society by applying<br />
cquitably to the whole connunity the benefits we reap from<br />
creating a stronger and nore competitive econouy.<br />
And it in a mandate to provide to the best of our abilities<br />
the Gtab'el, strong, competent and united government which<br />
the rAuct. alian people eg-pout of us and which they fully<br />
deserve, So loohing ahead to the ne;,, t three years of government, we<br />
have a kull and a testing agenda of reform.<br />
During the campaign I outlined the next stepu we must take<br />
to im~ prove our national productivity and competitiveness, to<br />
eliminato our economic weaknesses and to exploit to the full<br />
our potential strengths. 0O0 03 022 </p>
<p>Isaid wio iecdad to continue to improve the performance of<br />
specific eTdutries by neans ouch or. deregulating the<br />
airlino Iiluctry and crude oil marketing; by boosting<br />
tourisa, value-added processing of farm and mineral<br />
producto, and high tech manufacture of communications and<br />
computer equipment; and by ensuring opin-offc from our<br />
submarino Dnd frigate construction programs.<br />
I said vic needed to improve our individual performancoG<br />
improving wiork and management practices, upgrading our<br />
research oa: illa, removing unnecoeary regulations which<br />
hamper cur productive effort, amalgamating unions.<br />
I said wo neoded to continue our export drive, espacially to<br />
tic ourcolves in further to the dynaoic growth of our<br />
irinodiato region.<br />
And I caid that as a special Priority we would furtter<br />
address thea training and education needs of our greatest<br />
resourco the Auctralian people.<br />
Labor hco been the pioneer in this task of national<br />
reconctru2,. ci. on. While the Liberals elevated government by<br />
neglect to an art form, Labor vecognised that our terms of<br />
trade criolc demanded urgent solutiona and that those<br />
colutiono could only be applied if Auatralleno were to work<br />
together.<br />
Throucoi': the life of the Hawke Government, tho political<br />
and indu3t:: ial wings of the Labor movement have cooperated,<br />
in the ta of restructuring the econony especially<br />
through tliu nechanism of the Accord.<br />
The moot rocent example of this cooporation ic the ACTU<br />
report 1,% 33itralian ReconstructedO.<br />
I do not iocesoarily endorrc evory single proposal in that<br />
documont. 3ut I believe it le a sophisticated and welcome<br />
addition to the national debate about the key iosues the<br />
nation cuat: resolve.<br />
And it ce tainly deserves ant equally sophisticated response,<br />
rather than come of the ill-considered knee-jer% reactions<br />
we have wiAtnessed. I will be making a more detailed response<br />
to this raport when I addrecs the ACTU Congress next month.<br />
Delegates.<br />
We won the election because the Australian people were<br />
prepared to put in the hard work necessary to achieve the<br />
goal of . reconstruction and they accepted that Labor had<br />
the only. realistic plan to meet that goal.<br />
But we won also because the Australian people accepted that<br />
Labor has the proven capacity to reap the benefits of<br />
reconotruction to build a fairer and more compassionate<br />
society. 00013# 233 </p>

Cunning:, a., must realise thlat thO LLty in this State<br />
exercisos an enormous influence onl tho afizirs of the<br />
nation. Let me alcc thank in public tI11 0~ toing Victorian Minister<br />
Gordon JCLoles who haG been a loyal nnd diligent worker for<br />
the Part-y in many capacities ovez, -riy yeare.<br />
Delegatec.<br />
As we iiic'to progress in thiG tank of reconstruction, the<br />
forumS 02 our Party and , he menibogo of our brancheo have a<br />
very conis. derable role to play.<br />
The ? artyl has always been and romftin the engine room of<br />
this Government's success, both ji iselecting candidates for<br />
office and in debating and formuljqing policies.<br />
In the smonthe ahead, as we load 111 to our next Federal<br />
Conference in June next year, tho varty will again be<br />
involved in a major debate, concrliing our policy on public<br />
ownership. When tii issue was raised in 140t": h, I said we would not<br />
sell of' Government assets suclh a Australian Airlines in<br />
contravcyition of the platform of our Party. L0 0i </p>
<p>That reains the case today. The Party Platform will not be<br />
hijacked. But I believe the time has cone for the Party to embark on a<br />
comprehenive debate of the issue of public ownership.<br />
The principle of public ownership has a long and in many<br />
ways a distinguished history in our Party.<br />
For many years, Labor Governments have accepted that<br />
principle as an appropriate means of advancing their goals<br />
in a widec range of economic activities.<br />
Of course no one here will suggest that public ownership has<br />
no role to play in the Australian economy.<br />
This Government must and will continue to apply resources to<br />
achieve essential goals through public ownership.<br />
But equ2 ly we are obliged as a Government to ensure that<br />
our recourcoo aro not being aisdirected.<br />
That oblijation arises because we are a Government and a<br />
Party oZ Koform. As such we must ask ourselves whether the<br />
solutions of yesterday are still the best way of achieving<br />
our goals.<br />
And the obligation arises because we are a Government and a<br />
Party deeply committod to social progress and equity. As<br />
such we Lshould ask ourselvooes whether public resources are<br />
being efficiently directed towards achieving those goals.<br />
We are obliged, in short, because we arc a party of<br />
principce, not a party of dogma.<br />
Our Platform is not and must not be immutable.<br />
When I joined the party 40 years ago, one of the most<br />
time-honored planks of our platform was that which committed<br />
us to a White Australia.<br />
I make that analogy purely to point out that we can only go<br />
forward as a Party if we hold our principles not as items of<br />
blind faith but as relevant and effective means to achieve<br />
our goals.<br />
In the public ownership debate the two tests we must apply<br />
are these:<br />
First, does public ownership of a given enterprise mean that<br />
significant functions are undertaken that would not be if<br />
the private sector had the responsibility for funding,<br />
owning and operating the enterprise?<br />
If the answer is then, second, what are the<br />
disadvantages and advantages of retaining public ownership<br />
of that enterprise, as opposed to transferring it to the<br />
private sector 0UO 2) </p>
<p>In other words, the question should be not ' Why should we<br />
sell a Siven enterprise?' but ' Why should we continue to tie<br />
up our resources in it?'<br />
I do not vant now, to develop those questions or arguments.<br />
Indeed, I make it clear that my own thinking on this whole<br />
issue, and on the future of specific enterprises, is not yet<br />
finalisod.<br />
But I do know that the time has come for the Party to open<br />
up a rational, mature and intelligent debate on these<br />
questions and to do that on the sensible basis of<br />
acknowledging honestly to each other that no-one has a<br />
monopoly of wisdom or integrity on the issue.<br />
Delegates. Our victory on July 11 was not achieved by any one person or<br />
group within the ALP but by all of us. So the task ahead of<br />
us muot be the task of us all.<br />
We have won a great victory but we must not be lulled into<br />
complacency. There is a great job ahead of us.<br />
It will call upon our deepest resources of ingenuity and<br />
determination, and our finest traditions of cooperation and<br />
fairness, to complete the task successfully.<br />
We are in a position not only to govern the nation<br />
succesBfvilly throughout our historic third term but also to<br />
win reelection when we again seek the peoples' mandate.<br />
If togother we exercise our responsibility, if<br />
co-operatively and constructively we meet this challenge,<br />
then Labor is poised to be the Party to take this great<br />
nation, transformed and revitalised, into the 21st Century<br />
a shining example of a people successfully committed to<br />
social equity and economic efficiency.<br />
And, finally, we will be a Party and a nation which will<br />
have played a role far beyond our numerical significance in<br />
moving to create a world more at peace, and, with the<br />
realistic expectation of being able to divert its resouces<br />
increasingly from the destruction and possible obliteration<br />
of mankAnd towards the elimination of the scourges of<br />
poverty, malnutrition and infant mortality which so<br />
tragically characterise the condition of too much of the<br />
human race. 0O0J0 3 2G </p>
