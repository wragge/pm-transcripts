    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Commonwealth Government will provide up to $550,000 specifically to assist with aerial firefighting capabilities in Western Australia and South Australia.</p>
<p>This funding will be directed to the following initiatives:</p>
<p> A contribution of $300,000 towards the fixed costs of using two Helltac aircraft and an enhanced aerial fixed wing firefighting capability in Western Australia.</p>
<p> The provision of $250,000 to assist with the cost of having a medium fire bombing helicopter available for deployment in South Australia.</p>
<p>The respective state governments will be meeting the remaining fixed costs and all of the operational costs.</p>
<p>While firefighting is a state and territory responsibility, due to the extremely serious bushfires and the ongoing fire risk situation the nation is experiencing the Commonwealth is prepared to provide this assistance on a one-off basis.</p>
<p>These initiatives form part of an overall contribution of up to $8 million that the Commonwealth is making to a national aerial firefighting capability for this fire season. It includes providing half the leasing and locating costs of bringing five Erickson Aircrane helitankers to Australia.</p>
<p>The specific funding to be allocated to the Western Australian and South Australian initiatives does recognise the fact that the helitankers have been required to operate almost non-stop in the eastern states due the exceptionally dangerous bushfires that have occurred and continue to burn in those states.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding where the helitankers are operating at present, under the national aerial firefighting arrangements, the helitankers will be available to be deployed on a national basis as needed.</p>
