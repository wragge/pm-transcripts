PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP,<br />
DOORSTOP, HILTON HOTEL, SYDNEY, 12 MARCH 1992<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
J: What's your reaction to the latest unemploymentfigures?<br />
PM: Well, I think it shows there is no further<br />
deterioration taking place in the labour market. Now,<br />
over the last few months we've seen a reasonably<br />
stronger trend in employment that was interrupted<br />
this month, but the unemployment rate is marginally up<br />
on last month, that one would have to say that the<br />
trend rate is about the same. So, overall, happily, no<br />
further deterioration in unemployment.<br />
J: Is there brighter news around the corner?<br />
PM: Well, we expect the economy to grow over the course of<br />
1992-3, because employment is so closely tied to GDP,<br />
the product, to the economy, as the economy grows, so<br />
too will employment.<br />
J: Mr Keating, will next week's GDP figures show that the<br />
recession is over?<br />
PM: I don't know, let's wait and see. I've not really been<br />
in the business of predicting National Accounts, as you<br />
know.<br />
J: Prime Minister, John Hewson's campaigning style,<br />
particularly his challenge to you last night to debate<br />
him </p>
<p>PM: I think he is rattled, as I said to you yesterday, I<br />
think he is rattled. He is now willy-nilly adopting<br />
our infrastructure proposals, which a few weeks ago<br />
were irresponsible, he is now going to use the proceeds<br />
of our growth which he said was unlikely to happen, and<br />
I think he is not sure what model he is working in. I<br />
think more power to him, let him continue this way.<br />
J: What's your response to his challenge to a debate?<br />
PM: Well, I wouldn't want to do to him in public what I've<br />
been obliged to do to him in the privacy in Parliament<br />
House, in the House of Representatives. So, you know,<br />
we can't be too unkind to him.<br />
J: Mr Keating, you had a go at Dr Hewson's fiscal<br />
discipline. In the Budget, would you undertake to<br />
offset extra spending by spending cuts to keep your own<br />
fiscal discipline?<br />
PM: We're the people who brought fiscal discipline to<br />
Australia, we're the first people to produce surpluses,<br />
structural Budget surpluses, we're the people who spend<br />
7 years cutting government spending, and we will do<br />
that which we think is sensible and reasonable to the<br />
economy. I made it clear in the One Nation Statement<br />
that the deficit will come out probably beyond that<br />
which we have, in forecasts there, as the Government<br />
considers other unavoidable new policy over the course<br />
of the Budget preparation. Now how much of that we<br />
offset will remain to be seen. But I certainly don't<br />
believe it should necessarily be offset.<br />
J: In that case your deficit figure would blow out?<br />
PM: No, no, just understand. We've got a ball-park number<br />
there, and that's fine as far as we're concerned. But<br />
it's really gilding the lily for Dr Hewson who left me,<br />
in the last recession the one who he advised Mr<br />
Howard on with a deficit twice as large as we have<br />
now, the GDP, twice as large, to be giving us little<br />
homilies about fiscal discipline. I mean, anyone else<br />
with any self regard would crawl off into a cupboard,<br />
and never mention the word " Budget" again.<br />
J: Is the $ 6.8 billion forecast on the deficit immutable<br />
or is that<br />
PM: I think if you read the One Nation Statement you will<br />
find there that we say that this is the outcome of<br />
these changes as it is. But again, there is always, in<br />
every Budget, a round of considerations on the outlays<br />
and savings side. And, you know, there will be in this<br />
Budget again.<br />
J: Should Mr Willis have spoken out in public on his<br />
demise as Treasurer like he did? </p>
<p>PM: Well, I think he was asked a perfectly reasonable<br />
questions, and he gave, I think in the circumstances, a<br />
perfectly reasonable response. I wouldn't blame Ralph<br />
for being disappointed. But the measure of him is he<br />
has put his back into that One Nation Statement as few<br />
Ministers would. And he has been one of the principles<br />
in it. The three principles were myself, the<br />
Treasurer, and Mr Willis.<br />
J: What do you think he meant by his being dismissed for<br />
reasons other than his ability'?<br />
PM: Prime Ministers have the difficult task of making<br />
judgements about Ministerial places, and I can assure<br />
you it would be a moot point who was hurt the most in<br />
the decision me making it or Mr Willis with the<br />
change. I mean it came as no pleasure to me and I had<br />
to make a judgment and I did, and he, in a most I think<br />
responsible way, has taken up again the Finance<br />
Ministry duties with great relish and fervour.<br />
J: How long do you think it will be before you know for<br />
sure that the Australian economy is on track, and we<br />
have reached the bottom of the interest rate cycle?<br />
PM: Well, we'll just see what happens with the National<br />
Accounts, which come out soon, and then the quarter<br />
after that. The best guide to how we are going is the<br />
official data.<br />
J: Prime Minister, should the markets read anything into<br />
your comments about the future of interest rates, vis a<br />
vis your comments today about the relatively tight<br />
stand in monetary policy?<br />
PM: I was just reminding people that at this stage in the<br />
cycle of the last recession, inflation was at 10 per<br />
cent. Inflation now is at 1.5 and an underlying rate<br />
of about 3 per cent. So we are 7 percentage points<br />
lower, but the shift in interest rates has been 12, the<br />
same as in ' 82-3, which means, necessarily, that<br />
monetary conditions have been, if you like, less<br />
relaxed now than they were then. And that's why I<br />
think the markets ought to appreciate that and<br />
understand that that the Government is intent upon<br />
keeping inflation down, and we are about a sustainable,<br />
low inflationary recovery.<br />
J: But the markets have been speculating about the<br />
possibility of another interest rate cut. Do you think<br />
they might draw upon what you've said that there is<br />
some flexibility in monetary policy?<br />
PM: Well, that's up to them. That's what they're paid all<br />
that money for to make those judgments.<br />
J: Do you think there is that flexibility? </p>
<p>PM: Well, that's what you just asked me. As I said that's<br />
for the markets to make those judgments.<br />
J: Prime Minister, what about immigration? The numbers<br />
are out, what are you going to do to combat that?<br />
PM: What do you mean, combat?<br />
J: Dr Hewson says that it is out of control.<br />
PM: Well, that's a comment which is basically made in<br />
satisfaction of that part of that debate which is<br />
cranky about the migration program. It's not a comment<br />
which pays due regard to the difficulties of running a<br />
program like this.<br />
J: But 35 per cent of recent immigrants are going on some<br />
sort of government benefit because there is no work.<br />
PM: The thing is, look, migration programs are for the long<br />
run good of Australia, of its economy, of its<br />
population, and of course the program goes up and down<br />
during economic periods in boom times when we need<br />
more labour it goes up, in recessions it goes down.<br />
That's what's been happening now.<br />
J: But it's not going down.<br />
PM: No, what he wants to do is basically destroy. He wants<br />
to basically destroy the program. And we'll be making<br />
a Judgement about this in April. In April each year we<br />
make a Judgment about what the numbers should be for<br />
the following year.<br />
J: Can we expect a cut?<br />
PM: Well, you can just expect the statement in April.<br />
J: What's your reaction to the East Timor peace trip, the<br />
way that's turned out? Are you satisfied we didn't<br />
step on any toes?<br />
PM: Well, I'm very pleased about the fact that there was no<br />
overt problem there and that the matter was, in many<br />
respects, dealt with sensibly by the people operating<br />
the vessel.<br />
J: You said the unemployment trends remained much the<br />
same, in Victoria in fact it hasn't, the participation<br />
rate has slumped. Is that indicative of how the<br />
employment rate will go for the next few months?<br />
PM: Participation rates jump about, it's very hard to make<br />
a judgment about them, they dance all over the place.<br />
The main thing is, the trend in employment is for this<br />
month no deterioration, no deterioration over the last<br />
2 or 3 months. </p>
