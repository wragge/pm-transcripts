PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR P?^ 5S 2 JULY 1978<br />
ELECTORATE TALK<br />
For many years, beef producers have helped ease the burden<br />
of inflation f: r people throughout Australia.<br />
While incomes generally have risen in money terms because of<br />
inflation, re-turns to meat producers and to many other primary<br />
producers have been depressed.<br />
Many beef fa= ers have been driven off the land, while others<br />
have struggled to cover costs.<br />
The recent sa=. e of beef to the United States to meet a special<br />
requirement was heartening and welcome news for the grower.<br />
It has heled prices in the saleyards.<br />
Although saleyard prices recently have improved, it has not yet<br />
been sufficie= t to help a great number of cattlemen overcome<br />
the economic difficulties of the past four or five years.<br />
For some t--e now, the Government has been concerned about<br />
returns to beef producers. While cattlemen have been receiving<br />
poor average prices at the saleyard, abattoirs and processors<br />
have been accused of making inordinate profits.<br />
Because of this, the Government has announced a wide ranging<br />
examination into beef marketing and processing charges and<br />
margins. The inquiry will be conducted by the Prices<br />
Justification Tribunal, and will be one of the largest ever<br />
undertaken by that body.<br />
It will closely examine the whole cost structure of the<br />
industry literally from the farm gate to the dinner plate.<br />
This inquiry has been under active consideration for some time.<br />
Both the Minister for Primary Industry and myself, prior<br />
to the last election, referred to the Government's intention<br />
to hold such an inquiry. We were very well aware of dissatisfaction<br />
among cattlemen throughout Australia with poor returns for their<br />
stock. The Govermmen.-intends by this incuiry to establish precisely<br />
how the costs and profits in the beef industry are distributed.<br />
The infor. ati: n will assist the Government and the industry<br />
to formulate e= ffective future policies for the livestock and<br />
meat indust-== s. / 2 </p>
<p>in Apr* this year, I wrote to all State Premiers seeking their<br />
e inquiry. The last State, New South Wales,<br />
res. cl-agreeing that State and Municipal abattoirs<br />
snIoUld-be the scope of the inquiry.<br />
While i be conducted by the its hearings<br />
will nct be p-However, the final report will be made<br />
public by te Z-. er7=_ ent.<br />
The Governe. fe, t the P. J. T. Act was not sufficiently wide<br />
to e to conduct the all-embracing inquiry<br />
considered neze= sary. For that reason we sought the assistance<br />
of each State and decided on an informal hearing.<br />
Specifically, the P. J. T. will examine the charges and margins<br />
that apply to beef marketing and processing including livestock<br />
selling companies, abattoirs, wholesalers and retailers.<br />
7t will reDc_-on the basis on which these charges and margins<br />
are established. Here it will have special regard to the costs<br />
of resources required to process and market cattle and beef,<br />
and to the : e-r= ns from beef exports.<br />
The also report on the significance of these charges<br />
and margi-ns determining retail prices.<br />
As Prime Manzster and Member of Parliament for a rural electorate,<br />
I am very ccrnscious of the widespread community interest in<br />
this whole -estion of beef prices.<br />
Producers and the beef industry generally are rightly concerned<br />
about poor returns. The housewife is also concerned that she<br />
should not be paying more than what is necessary.<br />
I am confident this wide ranging examination will lead not only<br />
to assured and stable returns for cattlemen, but will also mean<br />
a better deal for housewives who have to balance the family<br />
budget.<br />
Another announcement of great interest to people in rural areas<br />
was made last week. The Government has decided to raise the<br />
floor price for wool to the whole clip average of 298 cents<br />
per kg. clear for the 1978/ 79 season.<br />
The floor price scheme will be continued in 1979/ 80 at not less<br />
than 298 cents.<br />
The Goverm" ernt has raised the level of the floor price on a<br />
number of occasions. It had raised it to 284 cents per kg.<br />
clear on the whole clip average when the Australian dollar was<br />
devalued in : vamber 1976. We have maintained it at that level<br />
throughout-1977/ 78 season.<br />
The increase e Government has now authorised for this coming<br />
season rep-s-t a rise of 5 percent which the market can<br />
well suppCr-. / 3 </p>
<p>9 3.<br />
The c-rrent market price indicator stands at 310 cents, and<br />
furt'-r i: rz-ve-enz in the market is forecast for 1978/ 79.<br />
Price relativi--ie for the various wool types for the purpose<br />
of the reserve zrie support around the average will be<br />
announced by a -Z-tralian Wool Corporation.<br />
This decisiozn :--lills the Government's commitment to make sure<br />
the floor price scheme continues well ahead in a way that provides<br />
stability and : cntinuity for the industry.<br />
The woed rare--ing operation is a great success story for the<br />
Corporation ai-for all producers. oOo--</p>
