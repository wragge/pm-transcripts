    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE.....................................</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Is a GST now impossible?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, what we've had from Mr Beazley is not only a backflip</p>
<p>   on what he said a year ago, but we've also had a very arrogant</p>
<p>   declaration. What he's really saying is I don't care what</p>
<p>   the Australian people say, I will do everything I can to stop tax</p>
<p>   reform occurring. </p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Well how do you overcome it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we overcome it by continuing to persue tax reform, and by</p>
<p>   reminding the Australian people what he's threatening to do.</p>
<p>   I mean what he's saying is, we can go to the next election,</p>
<p>   we can unveil our tax plan, we can put our position on the line,</p>
<p>   our policy on the line, win the support of the Australian public,</p>
<p>   and because as inevitably will be the case, the Government won't</p>
<p>   have the numbers in the Senate, then he along with the Democrats</p>
<p>   and perhaps the independents can block the will of the Australian</p>
<p>   people - not the will of the Coalition - but the will of the Australian</p>
<p>   people. And then if a re-elected Coalition Government wanted to</p>
<p>   pursue tax reform in the interests of the Australian public, knowing</p>
<p>   that the Australian public wanted tax reform, the only way it could</p>
<p>   then get it through would be to have yet another election. So what</p>
<p>   he's really saying is that he doesn't really care if what</p>
<p>   he has threatened to do results in there being a couple of elections</p>
<p>   in the space of a year. Now, I think collectively speaking the Australian</p>
<p>   people want that like a hole in the head.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Well, there is really no realistic chance of the Government getting</p>
<p>   the numbers in the upper house? Even in a double dissolution.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, no, no. No exactly. And I'm quite open about that. I mean</p>
<p>   we had a huge victory last time, but we still didn't control</p>
<p>   the Senate. The nature of the Senate voting system, the fact that</p>
<p>   you now have 12 Senators from each State means that if an Opposition</p>
<p>   wants to be a permanent dog in the manger, if an Opposition want</p>
<p>   to just permanently obstruct and be negative and to stop things</p>
<p>   that the Australian people have voted for coming into operation,</p>
<p>   well, they can certainly achieve their objective at least in the</p>
<p>   short term. Now, I think the great bulk of the Australian people</p>
<p>   will say, whatever we think about tax reform, if we vote for it,</p>
<p>   the defeated political party ought to let it go through the Parliament.</p>
<p>   But that was Paul Keating's position. I mean at least he had</p>
<p>   the guts and the decency to say well if the Australian people vote</p>
<p>   for something I'm against, I will accept the will of the Australian</p>
<p>   people and I will let it go through. Now, Mr Beazley's not</p>
<p>   willing to do that.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Well if he sticks by it isn't that the end of a GST?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No well it's not, it's not. Look I want tax reform because</p>
<p>   it is good for the future of Australia. I know Mr Beazley in his</p>
<p>   honest moments would know, as indeed anybody who understands the</p>
<p>   structure of our current taxation system knows that the present</p>
<p>   system is very unfair, it's badly in need of reform and overhaul</p>
<p>   and what Mr Beazley is really saying is, well I don't care</p>
<p>   about that, because it might suit my short term political advantage,</p>
<p>   because it might win me an extra vote, I'm going to do everything</p>
<p>   I can including defying the will of the Australian people to stop</p>
<p>   taxation reform. Now we are going to persevere with tax reform.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Well, is he fair dinkum? Do you think he'll back off?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I suppose some cynics would say having changed his mind once,</p>
<p>   he'll change it yet again. I can only deal with his current</p>
<p>   position and his current position is one of saying two things: "I,</p>
<p>   Kim Beazley oppose a fairer taxation system. I, Kim Beazley oppose</p>
<p>   making the Australian taxation system suitable for the 21st Century.</p>
<p>   But more importantly, I don't care what the Australian people</p>
<p>   say, my view, Kim Beazley's view, is more important than the</p>
<p>   view of the Australian people, I will in fact thumb my nose at the</p>
<p>   verdict of the Australian people". I mean it would be an entirely</p>
<p>   different thing if we were operating in a situation where we were</p>
<p>   going to deceitfully go to the election saying one thing, proposing</p>
<p>   to do another. Now, in those circumstances he's perfectly entitled</p>
<p>   to use his Senate numbers to block us but we are quite openly saying</p>
<p>   to the Australian people that we had intended taking a taxation</p>
<p>   plan to the public before the election and a lot of people say that's</p>
<p>   risky isn't it. I suppose it is.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Well, it was with John Hewson.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, okay but what do you want us to do. Do you want us to be</p>
<p>   deceitful?</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>No, no, I'm not asking.....but I want to know how you're</p>
<p>   going to get it through.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We are doing the open, honest, decent thing. We're saying</p>
<p>   to the public. Here's our plan, if you like it vote for us</p>
<p>   , if you don't like it don't vote for us.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>But, here's a plan we can't implement.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, that it assumes a whole lot of things. It assumes of course</p>
<p>   that they don't change their mind again after the election,</p>
<p>   it also assumes that there wouldn't subsequently be yet another</p>
<p>   election and on the basis that the legislation would be passed at</p>
<p>   a joint sitting. Now I'm not going to sought of hypothesise</p>
<p>   about what may or may not happen in the light of what Mr Beazley</p>
<p>   has said. But the consequence of what he said, if he sticks to it,</p>
<p>   is firstly that of course he's against tax reform and he wants</p>
<p>   to keep the present rotten unfair system. The second thing is that</p>
<p>   he's prepared to put his view ahead of the view of the Australian</p>
<p>   people. In other words he's arrogantly saying to the Australian</p>
<p>   people, I know better than you, even if you vote for this, I'm</p>
<p>   going to stop it. Now what arrogance that is, it's very undemocratic</p>
<p>   illiberal arrogance, and thirdly he's effectively saying to</p>
<p>   the Australian people I don't care if there are two elections</p>
<p>   in the space of 12 months. I'm so determined to frustrate the</p>
<p>   will of the people. Now I think that is outrageous.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Well, how soon would you have to call another election? Doesn't</p>
<p>   it guarantee you...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Neil, I'm not saying we're going to do that, I'm</p>
<p>   simply laying out one of the hypothetical alternatives.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>What are the other alternatives?..........</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, there are a whole lot of things and we'll obviously</p>
<p>   give consideration in the light of what has been said by Mr Beazley.</p>
<p>   There's one thing I can promise the Australian people and that</p>
<p>   is we will pursue tax reform with all the vigour at our command.</p>
<p>   Not because of any personal mission on my part but because I believe</p>
<p>   it is in the interests of the Australian people to have tax reform.</p>
<p>   The present system is unfair. The present system means that average</p>
<p>   wage and salary earners are fast approaching the time when they're</p>
<p>   paying 47 cents in the dollar on their income. We have a sales tax</p>
<p>   system that allows you to buy a Lear jet free of sales tax, yet</p>
<p>   you pay 22 per cent for the family car. You can buy caviar free</p>
<p>   of sales tax, yet you pay it on orange juice concentrate. Now that</p>
<p>   system is the system that Mr Beazley wants to maintain.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>You could find yourself having to negotiate with One Nation members</p>
<p>   in the Senate.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I don't think that's likely. But if that happens,</p>
<p>   whose fault will that be? It will be the fault of a Labor leader</p>
<p>   who has not been willing to accept the verdict of the Australian</p>
<p>   people. I mean we're not talking here about deceit, we're</p>
<p>   talking here about a Government that is saying to the Australian</p>
<p>   public, we'll put a plan before you, if you vote for it we</p>
<p>   expect to have the capacity to implement it. Now isn't that</p>
<p>   open, isn't that democratic?</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, has this development, and I agree with you it's</p>
<p>   a fairly dramatic one, has this affected your consideration on the</p>
<p>   timing of an election?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Neil, I'm not going to canvas timing. I mean obviously a lot</p>
<p>   of thoughts are in my mind, they always are about timing and......</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Well there's a few new ones after this I'd assume......</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, but I've been in politics long enough to sort of roll</p>
<p>   with any unexpected developments and I'm not near making a</p>
<p>   decision about the timing of the election. I want to give the Australian</p>
<p>   public a better taxation system for the 21st Century and my concern</p>
<p>   is giving the public a better tax system and a fairer one because</p>
<p>   I think the present one's unfair.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Well when will you tell us what that plan is?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, when we've completed the details of it.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>But do you expect that soon?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well there's still a bit of work to be done on it. The Treasurer</p>
<p>   and I have done a lot of work. The broad architecture has been settled.</p>
<p>   We'll obviously, now that the Budget is out of the way, very</p>
<p>   successfully brought down and accepted by the Australian public,</p>
<p>   we'll then set about doing more work on the tax package. I</p>
<p>   can't pin-point the date when we'll announce it but we</p>
<p>   are well advanced but there is still a lot of work to be done. But</p>
<p>   I can assure low income earners that they are not going to be hurt</p>
<p>   by our tax reform package and I want specifically to say to those</p>
<p>   members of churches yesterday, I won't say spokesmen for churches</p>
<p>   because you've got to be very careful when people who are in</p>
<p>   the church are interviewed if they are not seen as speaking for</p>
<p>   the entire church, they are merely speaking either for their own</p>
<p>   church organisations or as individuals. Can I say to them that we</p>
<p>   are mindful of the concerns you have for the low income earners</p>
<p>   of Australia, for the underprivileged and I can promise those people</p>
<p>   that the package when released will be fair and understanding and</p>
<p>   sympathetic towards low income earners.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Okay. Mr Howard we'll take a couple of calls if that's</p>
<p>   okay before we get onto Indonesia and other matters.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Hello Ian, go ahead please.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Good morning Neil, good morning Mr Howard.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good morning Ian.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>I'm unemployed.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, I'm sorry to hear that. How long have you been out of</p>
<p>   work?</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>I've been out of work for six months now.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>What were you previously doing Ian?</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>I was employed as an administrative assistant.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>For whom?</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>The Commonwealth Government.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, which Department?</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>I'd rather not say.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I see. Yes.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>You've sacked him, Mr Howard?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I'm neither confirming or I'm not admitting anything.</p>
<p>   I was merely trying to get a little bit of the background to Ian's</p>
<p>   question.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Yes Ian go ahead.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>You mentioned on Neil's show earlier this week that we should</p>
<p>   all have a ring of confidence and Mr Costello's going around</p>
<p>   as if we'd all won Tattslotto. But unfortunately that Âs</p>
<p>   not the case. And I just wanted to know, the $580 million you're</p>
<p>   spending on Telstra and tax breaks for companies for the millennium</p>
<p>   bug, whether that money would have been better spent on programmes</p>
<p>   for the unemployed?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I don't, and the reasons are that fixing up the millennium</p>
<p>   bug is very important to employment. Because if companies come to</p>
<p>   the turn of the century and they've got computer equipment</p>
<p>   that's got the millennium bug and that equipment falls over,</p>
<p>   that will cost thousands, tens of thousands of jobs. So anybody</p>
<p>   who thinks it is an unwise investment to make absolutely certain</p>
<p>   that the computer equipment is proofed against the millennium bug,</p>
<p>   is misunderstanding the seriousness of the threat posed by the particular</p>
<p>   problem.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Thank you very much. Lyndal, go ahead please.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Hello, I'd just like to speak to Mr Howard about giving the</p>
<p>   Health Care Card to people who obviously have to retire on at least</p>
<p>   a million dollars to able to get it...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No that's not right.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Well, $700 000.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>At least.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well that's at the very upper end. I mean, there's a</p>
<p>   lot of people at the much lower end of that and there are an enormous</p>
<p>   number of people who retire on lump sums of $300 000,$400 000,$500</p>
<p>   000 - that is not uncommon now, and I think it's a bit rich</p>
<p>   to suggest that that's saying that people are wealthy. Interest</p>
<p>   rates are a lot lower now, and that means that you have to have</p>
<p>   a larger capital sum in order to have an income.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>But you'd need to be close to a millionaire to get to the</p>
<p>   $67 000 ceiling....(inaudible)...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, but the point I'm making in reply is that the great bulk</p>
<p>   of the people who will get it won't be near that ceiling.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Sorry Lyndal, we interrupted your question.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We both did I'm sorry.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Well, that's basically it. I'm an ex-teacher and you</p>
<p>   need to put money into the schools and things like that, so if you</p>
<p>   lowered the rate of people who are getting the health care cards</p>
<p>   you could at least put money back in the schools.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, when you say money back into the schools, that implies it</p>
<p>   was taken out, and that's just not correct. Money has not been</p>
<p>   taken out of schools. I mean, one of the things that I told the</p>
<p>   Expenditure Review Committee right at the beginning of the process</p>
<p>   two years ago, was that I did not want the ordinary recurrent money</p>
<p>   going from the Commonwealth to the States for schools. Both government</p>
<p>   and independent to be in any way subjected to reductions or cuts.</p>
<p>   And I've got a very strong commitment to both the state and</p>
<p>   the independent school system and I just don't accept the expression</p>
<p>   that money has been "taken out" of schools.</p>
<p> MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Okay Lyndal, thank you. Janet, go ahead please.</p>
<p> CALLER:</p>
<p>Good morning. Mr Howard, I've got a rather serious thing to</p>
<p>   say to you at the moment. There's a young man, he's 18</p>
<p>   years of age. He's got casual work at the Epsom training track.</p>
<p>   Now he went to Centrelink the other day and he was denied assistance</p>
<p>   from Centrelink due to the fact that he is not a long-term unemployed</p>
<p>   male. Now he was then, on his own back, forced to go to his State</p>
<p>   Member of Parliament. He then went to the Federal Member of Parliament</p>
<p>   who rang back yesterday to have a talk to him and this young man</p>
<p>   has got certificates for everything that he could possibly do in</p>
<p>   regards to computers. He's an absolute whiz with computers</p>
<p>   yet Centrelink refused to help this young man because he's</p>
<p>   not a long-term unemployed male.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I wonder if you would, off-air, if you could provide Mr Mitchell's</p>
<p>   station with some of the details of that and rather than my try</p>
<p>   and pretend that I understand all of the background to it and interpret</p>
<p>   it, I would like you to do that and perhaps if you wouldn't</p>
<p>   mind leaving your name, I will have the matter investigated and</p>
<p>   I will come back to you.</p>
<p> MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Good. Janet, hold on please if you can..... But onto the broader</p>
<p>   point, we are getting a few of these calls now, with Centrelink</p>
<p>   not dealing with short-term unemployed, only long-term unemployed.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>There are a lot of facilities at Centrelink which enable people</p>
<p>   in that situation to be put immediately in touch with employment</p>
<p>   opportunities. So unless there's been a breakdown in that,</p>
<p>   I find that very hard to believe, it is not correct to say that</p>
<p>   they've refused to deal with him.</p>
<p> MITCHELL:</p>
<p>We'll take a quick break.</p>
<p>(Commercial break)</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>We're speaking to the Prime Minister, more calls in a moment.</p>
<p>   Mr Howard, will Peter Reith be given an indemnity on damages in</p>
<p>   the waterfront dispute?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Peter Reith will be treated as all Commonwealth Ministers involved</p>
<p>   in litigation should be treated in relation to actions he has taken</p>
<p>   on behalf of the Commonwealth Government, and as the Attorney General</p>
<p>   said in Parliament, the rules that are going to be applied are essentially</p>
<p>   the rules that were laid down by the former Government. There is</p>
<p>   a procedure and it's quite obvious that like any other litigant,</p>
<p>   or any other person involved in litigation, Peter Reith is entitled</p>
<p>   to have legal advice, legal representation. He's entitled to</p>
<p>   get that advice and I don't intend to say any more than that</p>
<p>   but...</p>
<p> MITCHELL:</p>
<p>... we're talking about a hell of a lot of money.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Hang on, we're also talking about a well established principle.</p>
<p> MITCHELL:</p>
<p>That's all I'm asking.... damages...</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The answer to the question is that he will be treated as other Commonwealth</p>
<p>   Ministers in similar situations have been treated in the past and</p>
<p>   I would be amazed if there were any questions about that by the</p>
<p>   Labor Party given that the rules that we are talking about applying</p>
<p>   are rules that were laid down by the former Government.</p>
<p> MITCHELL:</p>
<p>So that means yes he has an indemnity?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well there are obvious constraints given that he is involved in</p>
<p>   litigation on what I should, and can say. I am not trying to be</p>
<p>   difficult or tricky on merely stating, I hope the obvious, and that</p>
<p>   is that he is entitled to be treated the same as any other Commonwealth</p>
<p>   Minister. You've got to bear in mind that Commonwealth Ministers</p>
<p>   are fairly regularly involved in litigation. It's not uncommon</p>
<p>   for people to sue the Commonwealth. It does happen from time to</p>
<p>   time right across the board. There are well established rules and</p>
<p>   I can remember on a number of occasions during the time of the former</p>
<p>   Government there was litigation against individual Ministers in</p>
<p>   that Government. There were rules applied. I just can't talk</p>
<p>   specifically about this case for reasons I hope you understand.</p>
<p> MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Okay, I've got to ask about something else. The Financial</p>
<p>   Review today reports on contracts between the Commonwealth and</p>
<p>   the companies run by the consultants including Stephen Webster on</p>
<p>   the waterfront with you at the top of what amounts to a taskforce</p>
<p>   on waterfront reform. Are they accurate?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I haven't seen the contracts myself. I read the article. It</p>
<p>   seems accurate, but I haven't seen the contracts, but I would</p>
<p>   say, so what, of course..</p>
<p> MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Would you release the reports?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well the question of whether you release the reports is another</p>
<p>   issue, but the suggestion that there is something strange about</p>
<p>   my being ultimately involved or ultimately part of the Government's</p>
<p>   push for waterfront reform is hardly a revelation. Of course I am.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Would you release the reports?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The question of whether we release it the report is something that</p>
<p>   will be governed by a number of considerations including of course</p>
<p>   the onset of the legal proceedings and we will once again be guided</p>
<p>   very much by the practice of earlier governments in relation to</p>
<p>   the release of documents of that kind. Could I just say in relation</p>
<p>   to the article in the Financial Review. If it is accurate,</p>
<p>   and I haven't seen the contracts myself but what it reveals</p>
<p>   is that I am the Prime Minister and naturally I am, as the head</p>
<p>   of the Government, I support waterfront reform. I do support waterfront</p>
