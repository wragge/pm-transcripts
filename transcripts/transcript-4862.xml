PRIME MRAINITE<br />
FOR PRESS 25 OCTOBER, 1978<br />
RED CROSS APPEAL FOR AFRICA<br />
The Australian Red Cross Society, in response to a request<br />
for financial aid from the International Committee of<br />
the Red Cross in Geneva, has launched an appeal to the<br />
Australian community for funds to help alleviate the<br />
suffering of some twelve million people in Africa.<br />
The Appeal will begin on 25 October and continue until<br />
11 November.<br />
Australians have a tradition of generous financial support<br />
to the many Australian and international relief agencies<br />
that are active in combatting suffering and deprivation<br />
in various parts of the world.<br />
This will be the first time that the Australian Red Cross has<br />
launched a public appeal to Australians for funds for the<br />
International Red Cross.<br />
There is currently great human suffering throughout Africa,<br />
as a result of internal conflicts and natural disasters.<br />
The International Red Cross is particularly active in the<br />
African area, and it is for this reason that the Australian<br />
Red Cross has launched this Appeal<br />
I am pleased to open the Appeal and I urge all Australians<br />
to give generously. 000---</p>
