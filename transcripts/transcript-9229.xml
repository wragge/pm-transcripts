PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH JOHN LAWS, RADIO 2UE, SYDNEY, I11 MAY 1994<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
JL: listened almost in silence to the Budget speech last night, which has to<br />
be a first. There wasn't much racket going on there was there?<br />
PM: The Liberals were there, I thought, some wag yelled out at the end of<br />
it, " get them the smelling salts", get them the smelling salts. As I<br />
walked out I said, " I think they have all just sucked on a lemon." They<br />
were the sourest looking lot. Because they thought this is the Budget<br />
we should be delivering, all this growth, the good news in it of nearly<br />
250,000 jobs. John Hewson, who in the election campaign was saying<br />
we are going to have a double dip recession and maybe a depression,<br />
could see himself up there wearing the laurels and accolade of growth<br />
and jobs.<br />
JL: So, you don't think the silence was..<br />
PM: The silence wasn't out of regard for the Treasurer.<br />
JL: It wasn't a bad sign, though?<br />
PM: It was just, if you like, the silence of reflection.<br />
JL: On what they have lost?<br />
PM: Yes, on the opportunity.<br />
JL: Well based on what happened to John Dawkin's Budget of last year, it<br />
doesn't matter how quiet it was last night, the fun and games really<br />
only starts now. You have got to try to negotiate the Budget through<br />
the minefield of the Senate. Are you going to put up with objections<br />
from the minor parties in the Senate again this year, or do you<br />
anticipate there won't be any? </p>
<p>PM: Well I don't know if there will be any. Let me just say a couple of<br />
things about the Budget, John, which I think are important. The first<br />
thing to say about it, I think, is that Australians have earned this<br />
recovery. We have had a very good reception of the Budget, but there<br />
are always the sour puss commentators. If it is not pain it is not any<br />
good. They can't say well look we have had a recession, we have got<br />
out of it, we are now growing, people are starting to get a buck again, it<br />
is moving on. No, no, they won't. " Hop in there with tax increases,<br />
hop in there and get the Budget deficit down faster". We are getting it<br />
down faster than any other Government in the Western World, to a<br />
lower number than anybody else.<br />
JL: Can I just say, apropos part of the reaction, you say that it has been<br />
fairly well received. When you look at some of the headlines, has it<br />
been well received? " Hope and pray". " Labor gambles on business."<br />
" Gamble on growth." That's the kind of headlines we are seeing.<br />
PM: But I think the key thing is what the business community say about it, I<br />
think. Because they are the people who employ people, they are the<br />
ones whose expectations about investment matter, and I just noticed<br />
as I was coming up to the station this morning, on 2UE news there was<br />
Macquarie Bank, Bill Shields from Macquarie Bank, an ex Reserve<br />
Bank chap, saying that the Government's investment forecast and<br />
growth forecast are pretty much as Macquarie Bank and other<br />
forecasters had forecast them.<br />
JL: Well, that is one saying that. You have got others saying that the<br />
anticipated growth is not enough. And after all the anticipated growth<br />
is only just fractionally over the OECD average.<br />
PM: No, no. We grew in the year to March at 4 per cent. The Budget<br />
forecast is for 4.5 per cent. The OECD average is about..<br />
JL: Is about 4 isn't it?<br />
PM: No, it is about one, 1 per cent. The Western World economies are<br />
growing, on average, around about 1 per cent. Germany is actually<br />
contracting, it is getting smaller, it is not growing, it is getting smaller.<br />
Japan is just at about zero, the United States is growing at a couple of<br />
percentage points, I think 2.5 per cent.<br />
JL: The OECD average, it is certainly not the average being claimed by<br />
some of the commentators. The OECD average is just about 1 per<br />
cent?<br />
PM: Around one, around 1 per cent. That is the position, and we are<br />
growing at 4 per cent. I am not saying we are projected to grow at 4<br />
per cent, we actually have grown at 4 per cent for the year to March.<br />
And we are saying in the coming year, 94-95, from July to June next<br />
year, we are saying we will grow at 4.5 per cent. Given the fact that<br />
we have got low inflation, low interest rates, we have got a high profit </p>
<p>share, a competitive dollar, a much more flexible labour market. We<br />
were growing at 4.5 per cent on average through the 1980s.<br />
JL Are interest rates going to stay low?<br />
PM: While ever inflation stays low, they will stay low.<br />
JL Are you confident of that?<br />
PM: Of course.<br />
JL Just back to the Senate. Do you think the Green people and the<br />
Democrats will behave themselves as far as this Budget is concerned?<br />
PM: Well there is no tax increases in it, John.<br />
JL But there is not all that much spending increase that they would have<br />
liked, not as much as they would have liked.<br />
PM: There is quite a bit. Just let me run through a few things. There is<br />
$ 500 million over five years for Aboriginal health. There is $ 63 million<br />
over four years for youth homelessness. We have got a national Asian<br />
languages program in there. $ 169 million over four years for mental<br />
health. $ 209 million over four years for breast cancer. $ 10 million for<br />
child immunisation.<br />
JL Is that going to be enough for them?<br />
PM: Well, they are all the sort of things that they claim to be interested in.<br />
And we have got $ 135 million there for the preparation of the<br />
Australian Olympic Team between now and the year 2000, and we<br />
have got $ 68' million in for foreign aid, extra foreign aid. So, the sort of<br />
things which the Greens and the Democrats normally attach<br />
themselves to are very much here. And, of course, the Budget<br />
consolidates the White Paper: the largest attempt that certainly any<br />
Australian Government has ever had dealing with the long term<br />
unemployed.<br />
JL How much have you got for homeless youth?<br />
PM: $ 63 million over four years.<br />
JL What are homeless youth?<br />
PM: Well, these are kids who just drop out of the system and find<br />
themselves in the Kings Crosses of this world, and the St Kildas.<br />
JL Because they don't like it at home?<br />
PM: Well, some of them don't have homes. They just get driven away from<br />
home. </p>
<p>JL: I think they get beckoned away from homes by Government subsidies,<br />
in many instances. Obviously you are going to give them more.<br />
PM: Well these are not subsidies, these are just refuges. But they are<br />
largely run by the States, but these are top ups which we provide them.<br />
But on the big agenda we have got, the key thing about this, is that<br />
Government spending, that is outlays, all Government spending<br />
outlays are running at less than the growth in the economy, and they<br />
will do that right down to the end of the decade, which means the<br />
Budget is going to go back into surplus later on in the 90s. In other<br />
words, if you can keep spending below the natural rate of growth in the<br />
economy, all the proceeds of growth then go off the Budget deficit.<br />
And that is the sort of fairly good position we have got here now.<br />
JL: Just back to the Greens and the Democrats, did you have discussions<br />
with them prior to the Budget, on the Budget?<br />
PM: I haven't, but we had a formal process this year, for the first time ever,<br />
of consultations between the Government and the minor parties in the<br />
Senate, and Ralph Willis and Kim Beazley, that is the Treasurer and<br />
the Minister for Finance met them, and as far as I know they had fairly<br />
good conversations.<br />
JL: Did anybody warn them that you might change the proportional<br />
representation system if they wanted to play up again this time?<br />
PM: I don't think so.<br />
JL: Would you change it?<br />
PM: We only mention it from time to time, when something annoys us.<br />
JL: I would have thought that that might have been an appropriate time.<br />
Would you change it?<br />
PM: That's an issue for the long run, I think.<br />
JL: Well, given your position now, as you sit here in this broadcasting<br />
studio, would you change it if necessary?<br />
PM: The best thing is to see how the Senate performs on these things.<br />
Look at the White Paper, John, the White Paper is a novel attempt, not<br />
just in Australian terms, but in world terms, to actually case manage<br />
personally half a million long term unemployed people back into work-<br />
JL: Yes, well the White Paper has been well received, but that is a long<br />
way from would you change the proportional representations?<br />
PM: Yes, but that is a long way from the Budget. The answer is no. I have<br />
no plans at this stage to change the proportional representations in.. </p>
<p>in the Senate. But the fact of the matter is, that in terms of social<br />
policy, the White Paper and the Jobs Compact, and the Youth Training<br />
initiative and the entry level training from schools to TAFE, and the<br />
Budget changes in Aboriginal health, and in breast cancer and these<br />
things, the sort of things that a developed country should be doing.<br />
And we can do it with a declining Budget deficit, and the Budget<br />
coming back into surplus.<br />
JL You are going to need the help of the private sector. In fact if it is not<br />
with the private sector, none of this will happen, will it?<br />
PM: One of the points the Treasury makes in its commentary on the<br />
economy has been that there has been a sequential or rolling nature to<br />
the growth in this recovery. The first wave came from consumption,<br />
that's personal spending and housing. There has been another wave<br />
there from exports and rebuilding of stocks, and now private business<br />
investmqnFTI -[ d~ ome in as, if you like, the third wave.' Now, as you<br />
know we have had a great paucity of private business investment since<br />
the recession began three years ago.<br />
JL But not enough.<br />
PM: We have got 14.5 per cent growth in this year which is a real pick up, a<br />
strong pick up. And that was the figure that Mr Shields from the<br />
Macquarie Bank was endorsing on your news this morning.<br />
JL Ok, before the last election, in fact, during the first of the debates with<br />
John Hewson, I think 14 of February it was, Valentines Day, you said I<br />
quote, ' We have got the growth, we have got the investment sitting<br />
there, $ 130 billion, enormous, an absolute avalanche." I can't say it<br />
with the conviction that you said it with at the time.<br />
PM: Well you have got the voice to do it.<br />
JL I am sure you are remembering the phraseology, " and once it starts to<br />
go, the economy starts to move", that's what you said. Now, that was<br />
nearly 18 months ago. " An avalanche of investment of waiting to fall<br />
on us, $ 130 billion." According to last night's Budget we will depend<br />
on growth to pay for everything, and that growth depends on<br />
investment dollars, business investment dollars. But even Ralph Willis<br />
last night, despite all the layers of gloss, said the business investment<br />
had made little contribution to the economic recovery, and despite an<br />
optimistic prediction of an increase in business investment of 14.5 per<br />
cent, which you have just acknowledged, next financial year, that<br />
represents investment spending, according to Mark Westfield,<br />
Business Editor of the Australian Newspaper, of less than $ 5 billion.<br />
So, what happened to the avalanche of $ 130 billion.<br />
PM: They were the projects which were registered for the development<br />
allowance. Remember we gave a tax concession which said you could<br />
write off 10 per cent of your investment in a development allowance, </p>
<p>but you had to register, or apply, that was the process of application.<br />
We have now got a large proportion of those registered, but the key<br />
point in the election campaign, John, was I was saying Australia is<br />
going to grow, and grow as fast as any other substantial economy in<br />
the world, and John Hewson was saying, " No, no, we are going to<br />
have a double dip recession and then maybe a depression."<br />
JL: That's right, but you did say we had an avalanche of investment just<br />
sitting there, $ 130 billion.<br />
PM: We are growing now already at 4 per cent, and investment is going to<br />
play a part in that. But it is not just investment can I say? We have<br />
also got private consumption picking up from 3.5-4.5 per cent, and<br />
there is gross national expenditure up from three and a quarter to four<br />
and three quarters, private business investment, 14.5 per cent, non<br />
dwelling construction five and three quarters, plant and equipment<br />
18.5 per cent. So, there is a sort of mix to it, but there is a big<br />
component of business investment, but so there should be, given the<br />
fact that we have got now a huge profit share in the economy.<br />
JL: But where is the avalanche? Where is the $ 130 billion?<br />
PM: Well, 14.5 per cent is a pretty big slug, old son.<br />
JL: Is Mark Westfield wrong when he says investment spending at the<br />
moment is about $ 5 billion?<br />
PM: That number is absolutely wrong, absolutely wrong.<br />
JL: Well Access says investment will increase by less than 8 per cent.<br />
PM: Well they have been consistently wrong in the last couple of years.<br />
Look, these are all the people who said to me when I brought the One<br />
Nation package out they said, " Oh this is a great mistake, it is going to<br />
bankrupt the country." I mean, it kicked us along in growth and as a<br />
consequence we are growing faster than any other substantial OECD<br />
economy. We are doing 4 per cent and the average is doing 1 per<br />
cent.<br />
JL: Yes, and I understand that to be fact, and I accept that as being fact.<br />
But if you don't get the growth you can't pay for the programs, can<br />
you?<br />
PM: Yes. Look, basically what have we done here? We have spent in<br />
large measure this year around $ 1.1 to $ 1.2 billion on the long term<br />
unemployed, on the youth training initiative which is about getting case<br />
managing for all young people under 18 who are unemployed.<br />
Personally managing each one back into work, and changing some of<br />
the incentives in the social security system so that low income people,<br />
and particularly unemployed people, can take on part time work. </p>
<p>JL: Why did it take so long to get this training wage? Because Blind<br />
Freddy could have seen that if you had to pay an 18 year old the same<br />
as you paid a 28 year old, and if you could get a 28 year old, you<br />
would take a 28 year old, and it was shoving youth out of the<br />
employment circle? Why did it take so long for the penny to drop, or<br />
did it only come about because finally the ACTU agreed with the<br />
Government.<br />
PM: I will come to that in a second. Let me just make this point. You see,<br />
what some of these people say, " Oh well this all depends on growth."<br />
JL: Well it does.<br />
PM: Well the point I made is, well haven't we earned the recovery, haven't<br />
Australians earned the recovery after the last few years. Firstly high<br />
interest rates and then we had the recession, and we finally got the<br />
books balanced again, and got some sense back into bank lending,<br />
and taking some of the speculation out of the economy and got back to<br />
a real basis of earnings and exports and competitiveness, we have got<br />
the growth going now. What they are saying is, particularly some of<br />
this more rightwing rabid characters who write columns for the<br />
newspaper, sort of, " what are you doing spending $ 1.1 billion on the<br />
unemployed?" And what they don't understand is, in this recovery we<br />
are going to need a lot of skills and the skills formation is not going to<br />
come from the migration program, as it has in the past. It is going to<br />
come from our own labour market.<br />
JL: And it came from the migration program for too long too, didn't it? I<br />
mean, that is another thing that should have happened sooner?<br />
PM: Well, it is going to come from new entrants to the work force, that's the<br />
school leavers, and it is going to come from retraining 350 400, 000<br />
long termed unemployed people, giving them work experience, getting<br />
their esteem back up, and getting them back into work. Now, in a<br />
country this wealthy, to say callously to 400,000 people who have<br />
taken the brunt of the economic change, " sorry you have missed out,<br />
and we will carry you as an underclass, goodbye." Is not only<br />
inequitable, it is also inefficient because in this economy, this is why<br />
the business community has been very, I think, supportive of the White<br />
Paper the Australian Chanber of Manufactures, the MTIA, all the<br />
people who actually employ people, have actually said, look, this is a<br />
good thing, you can actually get some skills complements here in the<br />
1990s. And, John, we will have this is the point what the White<br />
Paper and the Budget which consolidates it says, as a society we will<br />
not go the way of a low wage working underclass or unemployed class<br />
as in the United States, as in Britain. We will not go that way.<br />
JL: What's unemployment in the United States?<br />
PM: What is it? </p>
<p>JL: About 6 per cent isn't it?<br />
PM: 6 and a half?<br />
JL: Ok, but we'll always have unemployment at about 5 percent, won't we?<br />
PM: Well, I don't know but our participation rate is way beyond theirs.<br />
JL: Well, when you and I have talked before I think we've agreed that<br />
there would be an ongoing employment rate of about 5 percent so<br />
we're going to have an underclass anyway.<br />
PM: No, it depends how long people are actually... see, in the late 1980s<br />
we had unemployment down to six and a half percent ourselves and I<br />
think the average time people were unemployed was about three to<br />
three and a half weeks. So, you've got a pool of unemployed people<br />
but how long are they in it? And there wasn't a great pool of long term<br />
unemployed people but now there is.<br />
JL: Yes, but that period of time, wasn't that what your people, particularly<br />
those on the Left of your mob, called the " decade of greed", when we<br />
had unemployment down at that rate? Wasn't that because private<br />
enterprise was employing lots of people?<br />
PM: Exactly, it was. We had 1.6 million job growth in the 1980s and..<br />
JL: Yes, but you make claim, or your Government makes claim<br />
particularly Bob Hawke to the 1.6 million jobs, we created 1.6 million<br />
jobs, but you didn't create them, the private sector created them.<br />
PM: Oh, yes but only... that was three times the rate of growth as the<br />
Fraser Government had in the previous seven years. And the answer<br />
is because the government had an Accord and it restrained wage<br />
increases and it had a set of complementary tax cuts.<br />
JL: So, you created the environment?<br />
PM: We created the environment.<br />
JL: OK, so if you created the environment for the 1.6 million jobs created<br />
you must have also created the environment for one million now not<br />
created.<br />
PM: Well, absolutely and I have argued that point and accepted that point<br />
in the course of the election campaign. But, what I've said is let's get<br />
growing again and let's do the things to get growing again and I said<br />
on election night we would not leave the unemployed behind. We are<br />
saying as a society, certainly as a government and I think as a country,<br />
we're saying we will keep Australian society cohesive and together.<br />
We won't have someone slip out of the system. We won't have an<br />
underclass. </p>
<p>J L Well, aren't you only able to do that by encouraging the private sector<br />
to employ because I mean, they are the employers they employ you,<br />
they employ all the parliamentarians, the bureaucrats...<br />
PM: In the last year or so we've given them every thing that opens and<br />
shuts. They've got a 33 per cent corporate tax rate, John Hewson<br />
wanted to give them 42 percent, we've given them 33, the same rate<br />
as Singapore.<br />
JL But that's been for some time and it hasn't turned it around.<br />
PM: No that's just been for 15 months. We've got the highest profit share<br />
we've ever had, that is, the share of national income going to profits is<br />
as high as it's ever been in Australian history, right at this very time.<br />
You can see that reflecting in the stock market. We've got a<br />
competitive exchange rate, we've got much more flexibility in the<br />
labour market through productivity bargaining so, everything is set up<br />
now for a big roll of investment and some of that is in the Budget.<br />
That's where that 14 per cent comes from.<br />
JL OK, now I know you wouldn't expect Terry McCrann to say anything<br />
kind about it..<br />
PM: Oh, look, Terry McCrann, there ought to be a law against people like<br />
Terry McCrann.<br />
JL I suppose he's entitled to his say. He makes the point this morning<br />
that unemployment will only come down with at least 6 per cent growth,<br />
that's to get real jobs. So, growth could get to 4.5 percent, according<br />
to him it needs to be 6 percent before it's going to really bite. Do you<br />
accept that or not accept it?<br />
PM: Well, he's arguing for a lower Budget deficit. They're real characters<br />
these guys, they say, " This depends on growth", and then they say,<br />
" We're not sure the growth will be there but you should cut the Budget<br />
deficit back." We say, " But hang on, if you cut the Budget deficit back<br />
you cut back all that government spending, that will slow the growth<br />
even further." They say, " Oh, no, no, no, that's not right, what it will<br />
do, it will actually make interest rates cheaper and therefore we'll have<br />
a big blow out in growth." I say, " But hang on, interest rates have<br />
come down from 18 percent to five 18 to five and you're saying if<br />
we have a tighter, harder Budget which may knock another billion or so<br />
out of it all of a sudden we're going to have some miraculous reduction<br />
in interest rates after it has fallen from 18 per cent to 5 percent.<br />
You see, in the end these people are rabid, right wing idealogues.<br />
They all roll out into their company paid cars on their $ 200,000 a year<br />
salaries, couldn't care less about the unemployed, couldn't care less<br />
about kids wandering around Kings Cross or St Kilda, couldn't care<br />
less about kids who are unemployed under 18 couldn't care less. </p>
<p>All they want to do is write some thing for these financial markets so<br />
you've got some 24 year old kid sitting up at a Reuters screen trying to<br />
sell a bond to some superannuation fund. I mean, there's got to be<br />
more to life than that. And that's why the public have got to peer right<br />
past all the commentators and say, what has happened here? Terry<br />
MCrann said, when I bought the One Nation package out, that it was<br />
going to bankrupt Australia. Here we are, we are going to come back<br />
into surplus in the 1990s in our Budget. We've got one of the lowest<br />
government debts to GDP in the world, as the charts in the Budget<br />
papers last night show.<br />
JL: That's if all the predictions are right.<br />
PM: No, no that's just right now. Let me just make this point to you. We've<br />
got to the stage in public comment in this country where the culture of<br />
criticism is so bad that they won't even acknowledge that Australians<br />
have worked hard for this recovery and are entitled to it.<br />
JL: Oh, I think the Australians acknowledge that and I think the Australians<br />
understand that.<br />
PM: I think the public understand that and that's why the government is<br />
always in a relationship and conversation with the public and not with<br />
the media.<br />
JL: Yes, well, when you talk of youth unemployment why wasn't something<br />
done about a training-wage a long time before this, because you<br />
couldn't get the cooperation of the ACTU?<br />
PM: Let me just show you this, your listeners can't see this but you can.<br />
Chart 3 in Treasury Budget Paper No. 2, comparison of general<br />
government debt. There's Australia, took at all the others. Look at<br />
Italy, Canada, UK, France. There's the OECD average and there's us<br />
look, we're about a third of it.<br />
JL: Yes.<br />
PM: We're amongst the lowest. It says, " Australia's public sector debt is<br />
low compared with other OECD countries but with both gross and net<br />
general government sector debt to GDP ratio as being amongst the<br />
lowest in the OECD.<br />
JL: Yes, but you've qualified that as saying public sector debt.<br />
PM: That's right. But, this is the government Budget. You see, people are<br />
saying, you'd better get that Budget deficit down. The McCrann's of<br />
this world are saying, get the Budget deficit down but, hang on, our<br />
debt to GDP is amongst the lowest in the world, we're going to be back<br />
in surplus earlier. Let me look at this, another little chart here, it's<br />
interesting. Look, it says, " International comparisons of fiscal targets,"<br />
and they've got the targets. Our target is one per cent of GDP by </p>
<p>1996-97. The United States is 2.3, France is 2.5, Italy is 5.8, United<br />
Kingdom is 1.5 and Canada is three per cent. The only other country<br />
which has a target of one and will get there, as we will, is Germany.<br />
Because it has got massive debt from the East German reconstruction.<br />
We're actually going to be under one, now. But, do you read that in<br />
any of that in the columns? Not a bit of it. You see, these characters<br />
will not accept the principal commentary which is, these are facts, not<br />
arguments.<br />
JL: But, all this is going to be paid for by growth? It must be, it's the<br />
perennial budget fundamental question, where's the money coming<br />
from?<br />
PM: The word ' paid for' is not right.., let me just make this simple point<br />
about what is called the cycle of the Budgets. In 1989-90 when I was<br />
the Treasurer we had a surplus of two per cent of GDP, or about $ 8<br />
billion. This year we look like having a deficit, in 1993-94 of around<br />
$ 14 odd billion. Now, that change is a change of $ 22 billion. From a<br />
surplus of eight to a deficit of 14. That's $ 22 billion dollars worth of<br />
cushioning which the government sector has given to the Australian<br />
community to cushion it from the impact of the slow down of the<br />
recession. But, when things start to grow again, when government<br />
spending comes back and when receipts and company earnings and<br />
employment pick up then, the cycle changes and the deficit starts to<br />
come back to surplus. We're saying we're going to come back to<br />
surplus in the later 1990s but we'll be back to a deficit of under one per<br />
cent of GDP in 1996-97.<br />
JL: Yes, but all this hinges on all of your projections, or all the Treasurer's<br />
projections which I would imagine are the same being right.<br />
PM: Well, what is the big number? The answer is 4.5 per cent. But, we are<br />
already growing at four and have for the last four quarters for the year<br />
to march.<br />
JL: And you don't believe there's anything that can change that?<br />
PM: No, I think Australia's really got the wind behind it now, in terms of<br />
earnings and growth and exports.<br />
JL: But, do you understand the sceptics who aren't prepared to listen to<br />
the spin, as they call it in newspeak. I mean, you promised us, I think,<br />
you'd bring home the bacon in 1988, soft landing in 1990, the<br />
recession we had to have in 1991...<br />
PM: Yes, but, John just remember, the 1980s were are period of great<br />
bounty for Australia. I mean, we ended up with one and three quarter<br />
million more jobs, basically, than we started with, and we averaged<br />
four and a half per cent growth all those years through the 1980s we<br />
averaged four and a half... </p>
<p>JL: So, you don't see the 1980s as the decade of greed?<br />
PM: I see the eighties as well there was a fair bit of greed around but<br />
there were tremendous opportunities around, as well. Tremendous<br />
opportunities.<br />
JL: And, don't you think we should encourage that sort of opportunity<br />
again?<br />
PM: Absolutely, and that's why we've got the company rate at 33 per cent,<br />
we've got a high profit share, and we're also saying, this is not just a<br />
recovery for the top end of town. This is a recovery for ordinary wage<br />
and salary earners, that's why we reduced the tax rate on middle<br />
incomes in the tax cuts before Christmas. And, we're saying, also, to<br />
the unemployed and to other sections of society, " You'll be in this as<br />
well. It's not just for the guys who are doing well."<br />
JL: I know that you say this is not just a recovery for the top end of town<br />
and maybe that is said in order to placate some of the left wing that<br />
you've got to take care of but the top end of town has got to recover,<br />
it's very important that they do recover.<br />
PM: Yes, exactly, but it's your small and medium sized business enterprise<br />
I'm interested in. They're the ones who'll put the extra one or two<br />
people on. They're the ones who need the break in the labour market,<br />
in the tax system, in general competitiveness and they are the things<br />
the government is seeking to do. But, they'll need skills as this<br />
recovery picks up and if we don't retrain that great body of long term<br />
unemployed people we'll have skills bottle necks. And, when you have<br />
labour shortages you start getting wage push inflation. And, that's the<br />
thing we've got to avoid in 1996 and ' 97 and ' 98.<br />
JL: So, you do subscribe to the theory, if you want more employees you<br />
have got to have more employers?<br />
PM: Well, I have always done that. I mean, let me make this point again<br />
in the seven years between 1983 and 1990 the Australian economy<br />
grew at an average rate of 4.5 per cent, exactly the forecast we have<br />
for this year and this Budget. But, to grow at an average of four and a<br />
half in some years you've got to be doing better than four and a half.<br />
In some years we did five. Now, you compare the economy then, to<br />
now. You never had low inflation, like now, we never had flexibility in<br />
the labour market, in enterprise bargaining, like now. We never had<br />
the linkages into Asia...<br />
JL: Why didn't we have all of those things you've mentioned?<br />
PM: Why? Because we had a slug of a government for 25 years, the<br />
Coalition, that never did a damn thing about any of these things. </p>
<p>JL: But your people have been in there for ten years, you didn't do<br />
anything about enterprise bargaining for ten years.<br />
PM: Yes we did. We started in about ' 85 on productivity bargaining and<br />
started to change the centralised system around.<br />
JL: Yes, but nothing happened until the last 12 months.<br />
PM: Oh, no, no, no. We got enterprise bargaining in the late 1980s. The<br />
great change we put in in the last year was enterprise flexibility in the<br />
Federal Award area. So, even in places which are not organised,<br />
where there are no unions, small to medium sized enterprises, they<br />
can now vary their terms and conditions of employment...<br />
JL: Do you regret that you didn't introduce that earlier?<br />
PM: Well, I think everything takes time. You see, the rigidities and the<br />
interlinking awards and the leapfrogging which characterised our wage<br />
fixing system for 90 years can't be changed overnight. But we've now<br />
changed it. But, my point is this, John, that with all those changes, if<br />
we could do four and a half per cent growth in the ' 80s in a far more<br />
rigid economy the chances of doing four and a half now in this flexible<br />
economy much more flexible, and remember this, that 75 per cent of<br />
our exports go to the Asia-Pacific. The Asia-Pacific is growing much<br />
faster than North America, -Japan or Western Europe. This<br />
government has set up structures not only in Australia, but outside of<br />
Australia, for Australia.<br />
JL: So, what do you believe our growth could be? I don't want to hold you<br />
to it, I'm just thinking about the growth in Asia.<br />
PM: This year I think we'll do the four and a half, as forecast and, I think, it's<br />
possible for the Australian economy to grow at that pace or greater,<br />
over the period. Now, we're forecasting, in a sense conservatively, our<br />
growth rate drops back to around four per cent for the next couple of<br />
years.<br />
JL: Do you think you are making it easier for private enterprise to employ<br />
people or do you think you are making it tougher?<br />
PM: Oh, we're making it easier because, basically, now a good manager<br />
can make the wage bargain that he or she thinks can kick the business<br />
along. And that, I think, is the big change.<br />
JL: I hear the greatest complaint from the private sector, or one of the<br />
greatest, and there are plenty of them, but one of them, which I don't<br />
think is unreasonable, is that it might be easier now to employ people<br />
but it is very, very difficult to get rid of them.<br />
PM: Well, I don't see that's valid. But, the point about it is, look, let's not<br />
get gloomy about getting rid of people, the fact of the matter is that we </p>
<p>have, all of us, changed this economy from a closed, inward,<br />
frightened little place, with a tariff wall around it in the 1980s and a<br />
managed exchange rate and a sclerotic financial system to one which<br />
is open and free, free and open product markets with low tariffs, open<br />
services markets and open financial markets and great linkages now<br />
into Asia, with low inflation, low interest rates and a competitive<br />
exchange rate. The ball is at our feet, and where now 8 kids in 10 are<br />
completing secondary school; ten years ago when we started on the<br />
task it was 3 in 10. In two years time it will be 9 in<br />
JL: How many of those kids are staying at school because they believe<br />
they wouldn't get employed if they left?<br />
PM: All the incentives have been to keep them at school because we don't<br />
want the Australian economy to be a low wage, low brow economy.<br />
We want it to be a high wage, high technology, smart economy doing<br />
the smarter higher valued things and you can't do that without<br />
education and research and development. Now, that's the sort of<br />
economy we've got set up for ourselves. Only we can muck it up at<br />
this point. The ball is at our feet.<br />
JL: OK, when you say qualify that.<br />
PM: Well, that is, by some characteristic of our economy or community we<br />
don't take the opportunities up. I mean, by the business community for<br />
instance not taking the opportunities up; by the labour market not<br />
changing.<br />
JL: Do you believe they will?<br />
PM: No, I think they will. Look, John, I was in Vietnam three week ago and<br />
I went to a function which the Australian Embassy had arranged and<br />
there were 235 business people there from Australia 235 Australians<br />
in Ho Chi Minh City. We've got $ 800 million invested in Vietnam.<br />
Australians are everywhere in Bangkok there is a great group of them<br />
there that I met. We've made the leap into Asia as we've never had it<br />
before and that is what is holding some of this growth up. That is, that<br />
exports which have been going gang busters now for years are doing<br />
so because the linkages we have into an area of the world which is<br />
growing much faster than north America or Japan or western Europe.<br />
Now, if we continue to keep our competitiveness, get that right, but<br />
believe in ourselves, have some faith in ourselves and not knock the<br />
place or have these sort of crabby right wing journalists saying, " oh<br />
well, look, there's not enough pain here, what we need is another sort<br />
of I know they had high interest rates, but now let's give them high<br />
taxes. Let's belt them around." This sort of notion that if it's not<br />
painful, it's not any good; when do we ever get to enjoy it? And if we<br />
understand that we do have tremendous opportunities here I'm sure<br />
Australians are going to just grab them. In other words, in the terrible<br />
sort of tall poppy cutting and knocking of Australia, basically the<br />
community is in for the main chance, which is growth and opportunity. </p>
<p>JL Just back to industrial relations. I was saying yesterday that you have<br />
done extraordinarily well, or somebody had, getting the unions on side<br />
probably Simon Crean in the main with your assistance but, the new<br />
Industrial Relations Reform Act would appear a major impediment to<br />
getting ' changes in the work place. The flexibility promised by the<br />
White Paper of last week is prohibited by this Industrial Relations<br />
Reform Act because it reforms all the secondary boycott provisions, it<br />
puts up barriers to the formation and retention of non-union shops,<br />
you've got to advertise any work place agreement and consequently<br />
the unions can get involved again. Are you going to have another look<br />
at that?<br />
PM: No, because, look, secondary boycott things never made any<br />
difference to the way so meone runs a business. What this means is,<br />
instead of the rigid flexibility of awards which we had from the<br />
centralised system, someone now who, let's say it's a business<br />
employing eight or ten people in a federal award area, even though the<br />
people may not be unionised, may never have ever been members of<br />
a union or been in any way organised, those people can now vary the<br />
terms and conditions of their employment in agreement with the<br />
employer without reference to anyone. Now, the only condition we put<br />
is that they can't be varied down. They can change their hours of<br />
work, they can change their remuneration.<br />
JL But they have to have agreement.<br />
PM: Between them.<br />
JL Yes.<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
JL But the agreement has got to be a majority approval, but the funny<br />
majority you lot have down there is 70 per cent. I would have thought<br />
51 per cent was a majority.<br />
PM: I can't remember what we've got in the Bill, John.<br />
JL Well, that's what you've got.<br />
PM: The fact of the matter is, look, any employer with any nous these days<br />
has got all the flexibility to actually get their employees together and<br />
do something clever. Now, they are doing it. You see, one of the<br />
reasons why last month the inflation figure came out for the year at 1.9<br />
per cent and in the old days wage increases without productivity would<br />
be pushing that rate up. The reason it has remained consistently low,<br />
and it is very low, is because we are getting wage increases, but they<br />
are paid for by productivity. So, it's not flowing into inflation and the<br />
system is already working. The proof of the pudding is in the eating.<br />
Just look at that inflation rate, I mean, we are not in a recession now. </p>
<p>We are growing stronger than any substantial economy in the world<br />
and yet we've still got inflation at 1.9 per cent. In the same part of the<br />
cycle in 1983-84 when we came out of the 1982-83 recession we had<br />
inflation at 11 per cent. We've got inflation now at 1.9 per cent and we<br />
got it because, basically, the system is more supple, flexible and<br />
productive.<br />
JL: And do you believe inflation will stay that low?<br />
PM: Well, we've got it slightly higher in the Budget at 2 and 1/ 4 per cent.<br />
From 1.9 per cent to 2 and 1/ 4 per cent.<br />
JL: If it goes to 2 and 1/ 4 per cent will interest rates stay down or go up?<br />
PM: No, I think there is no reason why interest rates should rise on the<br />
forecast. Because, we've already got interest rates running at 5 and<br />
1\ 4 per cent or 5 and 1/ 2 per cent on bills for instance which is a real<br />
rate of interest on the short ends. That is, the real rate is taking the<br />
inflation from the nominal rate of interest if the nominal rate is 5 and<br />
1/ 2 and inflation is 2 per cent the real rate is 3 and 1/ 2 per cent. So,<br />
we've got a real rate of about 3 and 1/ 2 per cent.<br />
JL: You see, because that's where the confusion exists what's a rubbery<br />
figure? I mean, what is the real rate and what is the anticipated rate?<br />
That is where the discrepancy lies. Somebody said last night, I don't<br />
know whether it was Ralph Willis or not or somebody in an interview<br />
later, that we had the lowest income tax rates in the world.<br />
PM: We are. Australia is the lowest taxed country in the western world.<br />
Again, that is confirmed in the papers..<br />
JL: Well, I'm just looking here, for the average wage of $ 35,000 here, we<br />
pay 22.6 per cent tax. The same rate of pay in Asian countries has<br />
much, much lower rates; Indonesia 23 per cent; Malaysia 16 per cent;<br />
Korea 15.6 per cent.<br />
PM: But, they are not OECD countries, John.<br />
JL: But, these are the countries we are dealing with.<br />
PM: I know, but, they don't have a developed road system, the don't have a<br />
developed health system.<br />
JL: Japan doesn't, Singapore doesn't.<br />
PM: Singapore is a city state. It is as big as the city of Sydney. I mean,<br />
once you put the roads down they are down for the next twenty or thirty<br />
years. Look at Australia, you've got to run highways.<br />
JL: It is a bit bigger than the city of Sydney. Japan 10 per cent; Thailand<br />
10.4 per cent. </p>
<p>PM: Yes, but Japan's rate of tax is about the same as Australia's. That is,<br />
Japan and Australia are within a decimal point of one another as the<br />
two lowest taxed OECD countries and we are.<br />
JL: But, when you say the others aren't OECD countries, that of course, is<br />
quite right. But, they are the countries in whom we have been<br />
encouraged by you to place great faith because this is obviously where<br />
our trade is going to take place.<br />
PM: That is true, but you can't compare their general revenue effort with<br />
ours when we run a fully developed economy when they don't. But,<br />
what we have done for it to say, but, we do trade with them, and<br />
therefore as a concession to that point we've cut our corporate rate to<br />
33 per cent so at least our businesses are on the same competitive<br />
footing as a business would be in these countries. But, in terms of the<br />
general community of Australia, we've got now a very low level of<br />
taxation because we don't have a consumption tax; we don't have<br />
social security levies.<br />
JL: But, it's not the lowest?<br />
PM: It's the lowest in the OECD.<br />
JL: Sure, but we are not dealing directly with OECD countries. Haven't we<br />
got to take the comparison between the other Asian countries.<br />
PM: Yes, well, go around Malaysia and go around Korea and see what<br />
conditions are like outside of Seoul or Kuala Lumpur or these places.<br />
It's just not like Australia, they are not developed countries.<br />
JL: But, these are the countries with whom we have to deal?<br />
PM: Yes, but we don't want to end up like that.<br />
JL: I agree.<br />
PM: I mean, they are trying to end up like us. They are trying to get to<br />
where we are.<br />
JL: OK, well now Prime Minister, tell us what we, as a nation, have now<br />
got to do?<br />
PM: I think, what we have to do is to consolidate our gains on inflation.<br />
That is, we have to always think about price increases and wage<br />
increases; we've got to keep the notion of productivity, the whole<br />
productivity culture in front of us; in preserving that inflation rate we<br />
preserve our core competitiveness. That keeps us in the market<br />
places of Asia and the Pacific and, to that extent, North America and<br />
western Europe. They are the things that will basically drive us. Then,<br />
I think, we have to keep a premium on education and training as we </p>
<p>are to make sure that we end up with a skilled work force producing<br />
clever goods and not a low income work force producing things that<br />
developing countries are producing. And, above all that, we've got to<br />
keep Australia as a cohesive society. We've got to be determined that<br />
we shall be an inclusive place. That everybody is part of the<br />
Australian family and there's not just part of the game for the wealthy<br />
and well-to-do people with the middle income earners doing it hard in<br />
the middle and those on low incomes doing it tough or the<br />
unemployed. That we keep the place as a cohesive whole. Now, if we<br />
do that, we'll do what the Americans have not done, what the British<br />
have not done in the 1 980s there has been basically an underclass<br />
rip away from American society. You've got a very high proportion of<br />
low income employed people, but people below the poverty line on<br />
abysmally low wages and you've got a body of unemployed people as<br />
we have.<br />
What the White Paper is, is a statement which says we will not be that<br />
kind of society. That the Australian ethos of the fair go and<br />
egalitarianism will remain a core part of the culture under this<br />
Government and in the Australian community. So, we get those three<br />
things together, maintain our competitiveness, keep an emphasis on<br />
training and product innovation and keep the place together and<br />
cohesive, I think, Australia can be a country, the envy of many in the<br />
world.<br />
JL When will we start to see the results of these things when put in place?<br />
PM: I think, we will start to see them relatively soon. One of the challenges<br />
in the next two years is to develop a private case management and job<br />
pl acement market to sit beside the Commonwealth' Employment<br />
Service so, if an employer needs somebody, with confidence they can<br />
ring a certain agency and find somebody relatively quickly who they<br />
know they have personal experience of. I think, it is also important for<br />
Australia's young people: there is a lot of alienation amongst young<br />
people because they think society doesn't care for them or doesn't<br />
care about them. I think, to be personally case managing them, oneto-<br />
one, understanding their personality, their educational..<br />
JL You'd have to employ an awful lot of people to do it.<br />
PM: Yes, we've got to employ about 3,000 we think to handle 125 cases a<br />
year, personally. But, you'll get to know the person, understand the<br />
person, their educational qualifications, their aptitudes, their work<br />
experience and they'll go away saying " well, look, I'm not on my own, I<br />
haven't been forgotten, I'm not just cast aside", and, I think, that ' s<br />
terribly important particularly today when many young people who drop<br />
out of school early find that they can't get work because the sort of low<br />
paid, unskilled jobs which existed 25 years ago don't exist now.<br />
JL In the time that you've been Prime Minister, have you achieved<br />
everything you wanted to achieve? </p>
<p>PM: No one can achieve everything they want to achieve, but I do want to<br />
see Australia set up well at home and abroad. That is, set up well in<br />
terms of a productivity culture in our industry, but a community culture<br />
which has a premium on each Australian personality remaining<br />
important.<br />
JL: What's the best thing you've done since you've been Prime Minister?<br />
PM: I don't know, it's for others to judge I think, John.<br />
JL: What's the worst thing you've done?<br />
PM: Well, whatever it is I wouldn't tell you, not here.<br />
JL: Later?<br />
PM: Later maybe. Look, I think if we can get that kind of society and I think<br />
we are getting it now, we've got a tremendously good social security<br />
system, it's targeted, it's relatively inexpensive in world terims.<br />
JL: But, is it really working?<br />
PM: Yes, look, it has held the country together through these last couple of<br />
difficult years.<br />
JL: Why have we got more people on it then?<br />
PM: Because we've got more unemployed people, but...<br />
JL: So, it's not working?<br />
PM: No, that's because the economy wasn't running at its optimum, but the<br />
system is working because it has picked them up and it's managed<br />
them and it's now managing a lot of them back into work.<br />
JL: Why do we have more poverty now than we had before if the system is<br />
working?<br />
PM: We don't have more poverty.<br />
JL: Yes, we do.<br />
PM: No, I don't think that's right. I mean, Australia is a much more<br />
JL: We were not going to have any by the 1990s according to your<br />
predecessor.<br />
PM: Australia is a much more fully employed place than it was ten years<br />
ago not withstanding the recession. I mean, largely we kept of those<br />
1.7 million jobs that were created in the 1980s, we've largely kept them </p>
<p>all. What we haven't done is we are not adding to new ones at the<br />
pace that we were formerly adding to them and that is what we are now<br />
changing this year with 230,000 job growth and in the Budget<br />
forecast for another 240-250,000. So, that will make a difference. The<br />
social security system, the health system means that Australia is a<br />
very equitable place, I believe, and what we've got to do now is just<br />
make sure that the proceeds of growth are spread to employment and<br />
to education and that we continue to make these linkages into Asia.<br />
JL: OK, thanks very much for your time. As usual you have been<br />
generous with it and thank you for the explanations. I still think there<br />
are a lot of things that need to be answered and I'd like it very much if<br />
soon, and I won't hold you to it, but if soon you could spend some time<br />
with us and talk to the people who listen to us around Australia.<br />
PM: A bit of talk back. I'd look forward to that.<br />
JL: You like that don't you?<br />
PM: I like that, yes. I like an intellectual challenge, John. Thank you very<br />
much for the opportunity and I thank your listeners.<br />
