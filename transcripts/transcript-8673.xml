PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, TIM HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
OPENING OF THE NAGOYA CONStlATE<br />
Distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,<br />
Welcome to the opening of the Austral ian Consulate in<br />
Nagoya. The Consulate is a result of our decision to increase " on<br />
the ground" resources in the regional economies of Japan.<br />
By the end of 1992, in addition to Tokyo, Australia will<br />
have representation in Sapporo, Sendal, Osaka, Fukuoka<br />
and here in Nagoya.<br />
This new office demonstrates the significance the<br />
Australian Government accords the Chubu region as a<br />
Xeystone for the development of the Australia-Japan<br />
relationship. It is a very close relationship, built primarily in those<br />
decades when Australia supplied much of the raw material<br />
for J ' industrial expansion.<br />
Our destini n the modern era have been inextricably<br />
linked.<br />
The partnership is continuing to grow and diversify.<br />
We remain suppliers of raw materials and primary prqiuc,<br />
but the composition of-our ex-p6rt-s is changing.<br />
For the l8st four years Australia has been the tenth<br />
largest supplier of manufactured goods to Japan well<br />
ahead of many other industrialised countries.<br />
We are determined that this trend towards manufactures_<br />
will continue.<br />
We are determined to do business with the world on a much<br />
broader basis than before.<br />
we are determined on our integration in theAija. PA= iic<br />
region the most important part of the world, aa we see<br />
it. 24. Sep. 92 10: 46 No. 005 P. 01/ 02 </p>

Japan is central to this view of ours, and will remain<br />
so-<br />
Strong strategic alliances have already been rorged<br />
between Chubu and Australia,<br />
There is no better example than Toyota, which has<br />
recently decided to build a new -6if-pIant in Victoria, to<br />
invest Ã± in a parts warehouse and distribution centre, and<br />
establish a training centre in New South Wales.<br />
We are well aware of Chubu. region's pre-eminence In<br />
advanced technologies, such as industrial ceramics, and<br />
we look forward to stronger exchanges in such areas.<br />
This Consulate will help that process. it will be<br />
staffed by a bilingual Austral an and Japanese team with<br />
extensive business and cultural experience In bath<br />
countries, We are sure that with their efforts we can expand our<br />
relationship in unprecedented ways.*<br />
Ladies arnd gentlemen, our economic relationship Is<br />
dependent on the depth of-65ir cultural understanding.<br />
significant cultural links between Chubu region and<br />
Australia already exist, particularly through the Sister<br />
city and Sister Port relationships.<br />
Mayor Nishio has, I know, visited Australia, and Governor<br />
Suzuki has made two visits.<br />
There have been many cultural exchanges, including, I<br />
understand, the presentation of koalas, ) ookaburras and<br />
eucalyptus trees to the city of Nagoya.<br />
Like the Japanese people, we are very fond of our native<br />
fauna and flora they are symbolic of the unique<br />
splendour of our natural environment.<br />
This Consulate is also symbolic of our desire to deepan<br />
our relationship with Japan, and Chubu in particular.<br />
Fond as we are of koalas, we are fond of business too.<br />
And culture. Very fond of them.<br />
And fond of Nagoya and the Chubu region.<br />
so I ask you to join re in celebrating the opening of<br />
Australia's Nagoya Consulate and our friendship and our<br />
mutual aspirations which it will symnbolise and serve.<br />
Thankc you<br />
NAGOYA 23 September 1992 </p>
