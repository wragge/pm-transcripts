<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, welcome again to Nightline.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good evening.</p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>When leading economists suggest that the GST could destroy up to 100,000</p>
<p> jobs and erode average Australian living standards, wouldn't</p>
<p> any reasonable person start to have second thoughts about it all?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, there are plenty of leading economists who think that the tax</p>
<p> reform we propose is the greatest next step in further boosting the</p>
<p> Australian economy that you could possibly get. Paul, we had a debate</p>
<p> about this before the election and we had all of these arguments about</p>
<p> its so-called job destroying effects then. Some of the leading economists</p>
<p> that you're no doubt alluding to include Peter Dixon who said...</p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>Very eminent...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Very eminent. He said the short-term effects - 30,000 more jobs.</p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>But not from the GST, from your tax cuts.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>But they're a package. You can't have the one without the</p>
<p> other.</p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>And your Treasurer's right when he says he'd rather abandon</p>
<p> the whole thing than exempt food.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, what the Treasurer is quite rightly saying is that it's</p>
<p> a whole package.</p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>But you're going to have to compromise in the end, surely.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We are not going to take food out. I want that to be understood.</p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>Come hell or highwater.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We are not taking food out because once you do that you're blowing</p>
<p> a $6 billion whole in the package.</p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>What about fresh food?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look, we're not taking food out full stop.</p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>How do you feel about the prospect of an independent East Timor?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I would rather Timor be an autonomous part of Indonesia and we'll</p>
<p> continue to argue at a diplomatic level for that outcome because we</p>
<p> think that is the best outcome. An independent East Timor would be</p>
<p> vulnerable, it would be very dependent on outside help. There would</p>
<p> be considerable difficulties between an independent Timor and a formerly</p>
<p> metropolitan Indonesia. Overall it would be more desirable for everybody</p>
<p> if the outcome were autonomy with Indonesia. But in the end people</p>
<p> of that country and in Indonesia will decide that matter.</p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>Given that they did help our diggers so much in the war, we owe them</p>
<p> a great debt some would say, if they were a young, new, independent</p>
<p> nation, would Australia want to put out a helping hand?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We know our responsibilities in this area. And I'm very conscious</p>
<p> of the history and that is one of the reasons why Australia played</p>
<p> quite a significant role recently in bringing about a change of policy</p>
<p> by the Indonesian Government. But I don't want to pre-empt the</p>
<p> outcome of ongoing discussions between the Indonesians and the East</p>
<p> Timorese or other efforts that may be made at a diplomatic level,</p>
<p> including by Australia, to get the best possible outcome.</p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>On the republic Â many republicans fear that having a second</p>
<p> referendum question about Aborigines could see, whatever your motives,</p>
<p> some sort of acrimonious race debate kick-off.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I think that's a fairly shallow argument. It really is.</p>
<p> And I think it's pretty patronising. Now, leaving aside the question</p>
<p> of whether or not we end up having a second question Â and that's</p>
<p> by no means resolved Â it is insulting to say to the Australian</p>
<p> people they can't think of two things at once. It really is very</p>
<p> insulting.</p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>But you're talking about recognising what you call an historical</p>
<p> fact, the prior occupation of this land. Already people are saying</p>
<p> there should be recognition of prior ownership and other concepts</p>
<p> that talk about ongoing rights.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, my response to them is that if they want something achieved</p>
<p> in this area they will drop that line because I'm not going to</p>
<p> support it. What I will support is recognition of an historical truth</p>
<p> - an indisputable fact. And that is that the indigenous people were</p>
<p> the first Australians. Now, nobody can fair-mindedly dispute that</p>
<p> proposition. But once you start bringing other things into it, you'll</p>
<p> lose it and you lose middle Australia.</p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>Labor says you've watered down your code of conduct for ministers,</p>
<p> is that how you see it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I haven't. I think I've clarified it in a couple of</p>
<p> areas and made some sensible changes at the margin.</p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>It used to be the case that if you were a minister you had to divest</p>
<p> yourself of all shares and business interests related to your portfolio.</p>
<p> Now you can place them with an outside professional nominee or trust</p>
<p> or an independent adult son or daughter.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yeah, well what's wrong with that if you're completely at</p>
<p> arm's length?</p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>Yeah, but I become Minister for Resources. I put all my mining shares</p>
<p> with my adult son. I know they're all there. I can then do all</p>
<p> sorts of favours, can't I? They're all still waiting for</p>
<p> me when I get out of the job.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>But if you are allowed, if you are allowed to put them in the hands</p>
<p> of an independent controller and you are completely at arm's</p>
<p> length from that person. We've got to be realistic about it.</p>
<p> Do we really want to frighten away from parliamentary life a bloke</p>
<p> who's accumulated a few assets? Do you really want a Parliament</p>
<p> that is bereft of entrepreneurs? Do we want a Parliament that's</p>
<p> got no businessmen and women?</p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>Isn't there the balance, though, between watching worldly people,</p>
<p> people who know the market place and know what makes things tick,</p>
<p> and preserving that very perception of propriety in government?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>You need a balance, Paul, and at the moment we're heading towards</p>
<p> an imbalanced situation where anybody who's accumulated a few</p>
<p> bob, who's been successful in business is being scared out of</p>
<p> going into public life.</p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>And finally, Labor Senators this week are saying they'll be raising</p>
<p> the claim that your daughter, Melanie, is using a Commonwealth car</p>
<p> space in Sydney for her sports car.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, let them raise it. Let them raise it...</p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>Very valuable, inner city parking spaces.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I have a response to that and if they want to raise matters</p>
<p> relating to...</p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>Well as I've raised it, what's your response?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, my response is that everything has been done in an entirely</p>
<p> appropriate fashion and there was certain security advice tendered.</p>
<p> There's been no additional expense to the Government. And let</p>
<p> the Labor Party go down that path. I don't think they'll</p>
<p> win any marks by doing that because matters relating to the security</p>
<p> of the family of senior politicians I would have thought should be</p>
<p> free of political exchanges. And I would think that's a view</p>
<p> a lot of Labor people have. But let them go ahead and raise the matter.</p>
<p> I don't think it will enhance their reputation in the community.</p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>Thanks for your time.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>A pleasure.</p>
<p>[ends]</p>
