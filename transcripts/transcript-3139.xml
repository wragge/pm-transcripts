PRIME MINISTER'S ADDRESS AT STATE DINNER,<br />
KUJALA LUMVPUR<br />
The following is the text of an address by the<br />
Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam, at a State Dinner given in' his honour<br />
by the Prime Minister of Malaysia in Kuala Lumpur tonight.<br />
" It is thoroughly appropriate that I should have begun my<br />
visit to six countries in the South East Asian region here, in<br />
Malaysia. I am no stranger to your country. I come as an old<br />
friend as the guest of old friends. I come as Prime Minister of a<br />
nation with a long and proven friendship towards the people of<br />
Malaysia. I come to re-affirm that friendship and to seek new ways<br />
to strengthen the co-operation which has existed between our two<br />
countries for more than two decades0 There is no country in the<br />
region which better exemplifies the spirit of national independence<br />
and regional co-operation than your own.<br />
I believe further there is no country in the region where<br />
the policies of my own government are better understood and where<br />
the responses and attitudes of our two governments to the changes,<br />
challenges and opportunities in the region are more-in harmony.<br />
In this climate of change, in seeking new solutions to<br />
new problems, Malaysia has responded with vigour and imagination.<br />
We Australians have in our own way tried to do the same0 Our views<br />
at so many points coincide, and so do the interests of our two<br />
nations0 In particular, we march in step on three fundamental<br />
matters. We both believe that the detente between the great powers </p>
<p>2.<br />
can work, that it must be made to work and that the smaller powers<br />
like Malaysia and Australia can help make it work. We both believe<br />
deeply that this region should not become the area for confrontation<br />
and competition between the great powers. We both believe that<br />
regional co-operation and regional associations have a vital<br />
contribution to make to the stability and prosperity of this region.<br />
It is against this background of shared interests, sharedattitudes<br />
and shared aspirations that I wish the policies and actions<br />
of the Australian Government to be seen.<br />
In Australia, we have broadened the range of our international<br />
contacts. We have sought t~ o break down ideological<br />
constraints which had for so long obstructed meaningful relationships<br />
with countries such as China, East Germany and North Viet-Nam. We<br />
have placed our relationships with the United States and the United<br />
Kingdom on the basis of a more mature partnership. We have widened<br />
our horizons and sought greater co-operation with the medium and<br />
smaller powers of Africa, Latin America and the Pacific. We have<br />
given our full support to all questions of human rights and declared<br />
our opposition to any forms of lingering colonialism. We have sought<br />
to remove any taint of racism from our national and international<br />
policies. I would like to turn now to my own and my government's<br />
approach to our continuing involvement in South East Asia.<br />
I wish to make it quite clear that our interest in South.<br />
East Asia continues undiminished. Our genuine concern about the<br />
well-being of Malaysia and our other neighbo-urs-in this region is<br />
a central pre-occupation and an enduring feature of Australian<br />
f oreign policy. My government is a government of constructive change.<br />
' What has changed in our attitude to South East Asia is not the<br />
degree of our interest or of our involvement, but the nature of that<br />
interest and that involvement, We seek to turn away from the<br />
destructive confrontations of the past to constructive co-operation<br />
in the future. After coming to office, we ended our military role in<br />
Viet-Nam a role which Malaysia never had; we ended our military<br />
assistance to Cambodtia assistance of a type which Malaysia did </p>
<p>d<br />
not give to that country; we reduced our interest in ASPAC from<br />
which Malaysia has already withdrawn; we sought to change the main. Ly<br />
military emphasis of SEATO an organisation, of which Malaysia was<br />
never a member; we decided to withdraw our ground forces garriscned<br />
in Singapore which were removed from Malaysia in 1969.<br />
Some of our critics have suggested that these and other<br />
changes-indicate that the present Australian government is less<br />
interested in South East Asia than its predecessors or that<br />
Australia is embarked on an isolationist course.<br />
I wish to rebut that thesis totally and I would hope to<br />
put this idea to rest now, in Kuala Lumpur, at the outset of my<br />
visit to South East Asia.<br />
My government is, in fact, setting a new course for<br />
Australia in this region. We have shifted the emphasis of our<br />
continuing involvement in South East Asia from one primarily based<br />
on ideological considerations and military alliances ' to one based<br />
increasingly on developing trade with the countries of the region,<br />
on promoting stability through constructive aid programs, on<br />
encouraging security through regional co-operation, on a posLtive<br />
response to the recent proposals that we should consider economic<br />
assistance to agreed ASEAN projects, and on the development of<br />
cultural contacts through the negotiation of cultural agreements wil. h<br />
the countries of South East Asia.<br />
We see in this re-orientation of our diplomatic efforts<br />
the opportunity, which has been too often missed or ignored in the<br />
past, to establish enduring relationships with the countries of the<br />
region. It is not our wish to forge ties based on transitory<br />
concerns but to seek out ways of developing bonds based on an<br />
identification of those interests which will continue irrespective<br />
of the governments in power in Australia or the region. Our imair<br />
endeavours will henceforth be directed towards expanding rej. ations<br />
in those areas of foreign affairs which are most likely to produce<br />
lasting social and economic advantages for both us and our neighbours,<br />
I believe that this shift in emphasis will, as our Minister<br />
for Overseas Trade said in Bangkok in December, mean an increase In<br />
trade and, hopefully, an increase in aid in the years ahead-as wel<br />
as a general development of the network of cultural and other conta: cTs<br />
with the countries of South East Asia. It means in fact that we are </p>
<p>going to live more thoroughly with Asia than in the past..<br />
Some manifestations of this change are already evident.. k'<br />
In recent months we have joined MEDSEA, the Ministerial Conference<br />
for the Economic Development of South East Asia. Only yesterday<br />
in Bangkok we were proclaimed an associate member of SEA4EO, the<br />
South East Asian Ministers of Education Organisation. Earlier this<br />
month we met for the first time with the Secretaries-General of ASEAN<br />
to discuss ways in which Australia might assist agreed ASEAN economic<br />
projects. I repeat that isolationism is not a policy option for<br />
Australia. We are going through a period of change and adjustment<br />
which I believe will result in a different but more endurin&amp;.<br />
Australian involvement than ever before with the countries of<br />
South East Asia.<br />
In this re-orientation I would stress that we have not<br />
sought to widen our interests and contacts at the expense, of older<br />
friendships. And this applies with especial force to Malaysia and<br />
the ASEAN nations. 1 .1<br />
For too long our interests in this region were seen<br />
excessively in terms of defence. We ' do not now look on the countries<br />
of South East Asia as buffer states or as constituting some northern<br />
military line where some potential future enemy of Australia should<br />
be held. Rather, we see these countries, especially Malaysia,<br />
Singapore, T hailand, Indonesia and the Philippines, as countries<br />
having a common interest with Australia and New Zealand in.<br />
consolidating the security and stability of this region as a whole.<br />
We are of course continuing defence co-operation. Ve hold<br />
to our pledge to the Australian -people to maintain the five power.<br />
arrangements until a more positive and enduring settlement is reached*<br />
in establishing peace, freedom and neutrality in this region.<br />
Accordingly, we see the programs of defence co-operation with Malaysia<br />
and the stationing of Australian Air Force Squadrons at Butterworth<br />
continuing as long as they remain relevant to the needs of both our<br />
nations and relevant to the realities of the region.<br />
our defence association is only one aspect of the.<br />
relations between our two nations and our two peoples. We have our<br />
longstanding common bond through our membership of the Commonwealth.<br />
We have increasinfly fruitful co-operation at the United Nations<br />
and the Australian Government now, as a matter of policy, consults </p>
<p>closely; with the countries of South East Asia before determining<br />
our position at the United Nations. A glance at our voting patterns<br />
in the United Nations will show that since December 1972 we have<br />
voted together to a much greater extent than ever before.<br />
We have at present over 6,000 Malaysian students in<br />
Australia, many of whom have enriched our culture and widened our<br />
perspectives. Others who have returned occupy prominent positions.<br />
in your government-and Public Service. This exchange can only<br />
strengthen the understanding of and friendship for each country in<br />
the other. Trade and Australian investment in Malaysia have developed<br />
rapidly. Only a week ago I announced a new Australian policy on<br />
Australian investment overseas, especially in developing countries.<br />
We want to encourage private Australian investment on a<br />
joint venture basis in Malaysia in a way which will benefit the<br />
p eople of Malaysia and will be favourable to the ownership and<br />
control of enterprises by Malaysians. We understand and accept the<br />
wish of developing countries to regulate foreign investment in<br />
accordance with their own national aspirations and development plans.<br />
We seek no less for ourselves and we see Australian investment<br />
overseas in the context of mutual benefit and of economic co-operation<br />
without exploitation. Recently the number of Australian tourists visiting Malaysia<br />
has increased greatly. There has also been a rapid growth in the<br />
cultural exchanges between our two countries. This is a matter which<br />
I believe worthy of further active encouragement. I believe that<br />
these programs of exchange between peoples and cultures have an<br />
increasingly greater part to play in developing a wider, enduring<br />
understanding between neighbours with different cultural backgrounds.<br />
Let us freely acknowledge the differences in culture, but let us<br />
learn more about each other and from each other.<br />
W also have many other links. I am glad that we have<br />
been able to make our contribution in the recent past to the<br />
development of your Central Bank, your armed forces, especially the<br />
Navy and the Air Force, your insurance arrangements and, indeed,<br />
your Constitution itself.<br />
All these links have contributed to a high level of<br />
awareness and understanding of each other. </p>
<p>We, in Australia, have been impressed by the economic<br />
success of Malaysia. I note that in your recent mid-term review<br />
of the second Malaysia plan you have not only achieved, but have<br />
exceeded your growth target. The importance of economic success is<br />
absolute because only with economic progress will there be social<br />
advancement and regional stability.<br />
I do not, however, wish to comment only on Malaysia's<br />
contribution to the economic development of the region. If<br />
anything, in the past few years we have watched with even greater<br />
, admiration the way Malaysia has evolved her foreign policies to<br />
match the changed realities of the area.<br />
Malaysia has, along with Indonesia, the Philippines,<br />
Singapore and Thailand, established a workable, relevant and<br />
important regional grouping ASEAN. ASEAN is an example to all of<br />
us of the co-operation and understanding which can be achieved if<br />
countries with a common interest in progress come together to promote<br />
that common interest.<br />
Malaysia has also used that forum to advance its concept<br />
of a zone of peace, freedom and neutrality. Australia applaudls this<br />
initiative and welcomes the objectives which the ASEAN countries have<br />
set for themselves for a zone of peace, freedom and neutrality in<br />
South East Asia.<br />
It is a creative concept which, if fulfilled, will not only<br />
benefit the nations included in the zone, it will itself be a further<br />
step towards detente, if the great powers are able to agree not to<br />
us e this region as the field for destructive rivalry. You have<br />
acknowledged that the zone of peace, freedom and neutrality will<br />
not be achieved overnight. It is evident that the great powers will<br />
need to show more trust towards each other before they will come to<br />
a point when they can agree mutually to accept the zone.<br />
The search for detente has begun and I believe the<br />
realisation will grow that it is only the imaginative farsightedness<br />
of such new initiatives which will enable our world to attain the<br />
peace and justice we all desire0<br />
In the same spirit of hope but with the same awareness of<br />
the difficulties in the way, my Government has suggested that some<br />
wider regional arrangement for informal consultation between the<br />
nations of the whole region should be established in the future. </p>
<p>7.<br />
We consider that it is important that the countries of the Asian<br />
and Pacific region should be able to come together to discuss common<br />
interests in an atmosphere free of crisis, free of pomp, free of<br />
drama, and free of excessive expectations of any spectacular results.<br />
I recognise that such a forum cannot be achieved quicly.(<br />
it<br />
has to evolve from within the region, out of the wishes of the*<br />
countries of the region. Like the zone of peace, freedom and<br />
neutrality, it will only come about when the countries concern~ ed.<br />
agree that it is-in their mutual interests to have such a forum.<br />
Lest there be any misunderstanding, I want to emphas'ase that<br />
we do not see such an association competing with ASEAN in any way.<br />
On the contrary, we would see it as being complementary to ASEAN<br />
which has proved itself to be a close, viable and natural grouping<br />
of South East Asian states0<br />
Malaysia and Australia are both moving in the same genera1<br />
direction and, with the benefit of our long-standing friendship and<br />
understanding9 we should, by working together, make our goals that<br />
much more capable of achievement0 We share the same great goa:.--s<br />
We are marching together towards them. In some matters, such as<br />
normalisation of relations with China9 Australia has been able to<br />
move more quickly than Malaysia0 In others, such as the es-tab. shnrt<br />
of relations with North Korea, Malaysia has moved more quicky trian<br />
Australia0 This has been because of differences in our circumstances<br />
rather than differences in our ultimate goals.<br />
We are each involved in our own way in an important<br />
humanitarian experiment0<br />
You9 within Malaysia, are trying to forge a free, prosperous<br />
and harmonious multi-racia" l society.<br />
We9 in Australia, notwithstanding our European origins, are<br />
trying to build strong bridges and develop lasting links with<br />
Malaysia and the countries of South East Asia0<br />
But we both seek9 I believe, the same end, namely to<br />
co-operate closely,, as good neighbours should, in a wider effort tc,<br />
promote a stable9 more prosperous and peaceful multi-racial1 South<br />
East Asian region.<br />
When one sees the severity of the test which the detente<br />
must undergo, as shown so suddenly and dangerously in the Middle East<br />
when one sees the continuing frustration of our high hopes just one<br />
year ago for real peace in Indo-China, it would be an exceptic'na'LiY </p>
<p>8.<br />
bold or excessively naive man who declares his unqualified optimism<br />
about the course of events and their outcome.<br />
Yet, fundamentally, I am an optimist, certainly about the<br />
future of our region. Diplomacy must be based on realistic hopes<br />
rather than on resignation and despair. And from no country in the<br />
region, from the effectivensss of its government, the growing<br />
prosperity of its people, and the imaginative policies of its<br />
leaders, do I draw more encouragement to sustain that optimism and<br />
that hope than I do from Malaysia." </p>
