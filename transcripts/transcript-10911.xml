<p>Thank you very much, Mr Brooks; to my colleagues, Gary Nairn and Bill</p>
<p> Heffernan; to Peter Cochran, the State Member for Monaro; to Mr Finemore</p>
<p> and to Mr and Mrs Rudd who've kindly made their premises available</p>
<p> for this morning's gathering.</p>
<p>The most important thing about the Government's tax plan is really</p>
<p> what was just said by Mr Brooks. It is a plan very much about the</p>
<p> future of the entire country. It is not just a plan that involves</p>
<p> a reduction in personal income tax. It's not just a plan that</p>
<p> involves sweeping away the rotten, inefficient, old-fashioned, indirect</p>
<p> tax system. It is not just about a plan that abolishes stamp duty</p>
<p> on all sorts of instruments levied by State governments. It's</p>
<p> not just a plan that gets rid of wholesale tax. It is, above everything</p>
<p> else, a plan about delivering to Australia a better and more exciting</p>
<p> economic future. It is an honest, comprehensive attempt to reform</p>
<p> the Australian taxation system in a permanent and decisive way.</p>
<p>We've had many attempts in the past. People have fiddled at the</p>
<p> edges with the Australian taxation system, but never before has a</p>
<p> government presented such a comprehensive plan which goes into every</p>
<p> aspect which needs change to reform the Australian taxation system.</p>
<p>The Australian public knows the system we now have is unfair. Overwhelmingly</p>
<p> Australians say change the present system, and they don't want</p>
<p> an attempt which simply offers something but doesn't attempt</p>
<p> to reform the system. And those who want to win public support, in</p>
<p> our view, have got to offer a comprehensive reform plan and not just</p>
<p> a tax cut here, a change there. What the Australian community now</p>
<p> wants, in the face of overwhelming evidence that the present system</p>
<p> is really reaching the stage of unworkability, what the Australian</p>
<p> public now wants is a fair, comprehensive change to the whole system.</p>
<p> And that is what our plan announced last Thursday offers.</p>
<p>As you know, ladies and gentlemen, one of the most evocative phrases</p>
<p> that has ever been coined about Australia was that phrase of our great</p>
<p> historian, Geoffrey Blainey, when he spoke of the tyranny of distance.</p>
<p> And he put that in the context of the Australian continent's</p>
<p> distance from the rest of the world at the time and also the vast</p>
<p> distances of our nation. And this tax plan tackles head-on the tyranny</p>
<p> of distance within Australia represented by the enormous transport</p>
<p> costs which affect the daily lives and the daily expenses of all Australians.</p>
<p>People ask how is it that if you're putting a 10 per cent GST</p>
<p> on, how is it that supermarket and other costs may only rise, and</p>
<p> all other costs may only rise across the board by something in the</p>
<p> order of 1.9 per cent. Well, one explanation is that it's been</p>
<p> estimated that 20 per cent of the cost of everything that is bought</p>
<p> in a supermarket is represented by transport costs. And if there's</p>
<p> one thing that this package addresses, and addresses in a full-blooded</p>
<p> way, is the cost of transportation within Australia.</p>
<p>Transport costs feed into the cost of virtually every item that Australians</p>
<p> buy in their daily lives. And this package, in a very comprehensive</p>
<p> and sweeping way, completely reconstructs the cost elements of goods</p>
<p> and services produced and delivered in Australia. To start with there</p>
<p> is a reduction from 43 to 18 cents a litre in the excise on diesel</p>
<p> fuel used in heavy transport including rail. There is the maintenance</p>
<p> and extension of the exemption on the payment of excise on diesel</p>
<p> used off-farm. And that is not only of benefit to the farmer but it's</p>
<p> also of benefit to the ferry and pleasure craft operator in the tourist</p>
<p> industry. It is of benefit in relation to the operating costs of power</p>
<p> generators. It is of benefit to many other aspects of the operating</p>
<p> costs of businesses throughout Australia.</p>
<p>But on top of that a perhaps, at this stage, little recognised and</p>
<p> little understood characteristic of the tax plan is that it will reduce</p>
<p> the costs of every litre of fuel used in any business, anywhere in</p>
<p> Australia by seven cents. And that is because the excise on petrol</p>
<p> will be lowered by the amount required to allow the GST to be applied</p>
<p> so that the price at the pump doesn't go up and that amount that</p>
<p> has got to be lowered by is seven cents. And now you'll be able,</p>
<p> as a business operator because it's a GST, to be able to obtain</p>
<p> a full rebate of the GST that you pay on petrol because it's</p>
<p> an input cost to the operating costs of your business.</p>
<p>So every single business in Australia will find that the net cost</p>
<p> of fuel is reduced by seven cents a litre and that is over and above,</p>
<p> over and above, the particular changes that are made in relation to</p>
<p> the cost of diesel, the excise on diesel in heavy transport, rail</p>
<p> and those other uses.</p>
<p>Now, the impact of this on country Australia, the impact of this on</p>
<p> the bush, is enormous. It will flow through every part of the cost</p>
<p> structure of regional Australia. It will represent the biggest single</p>
<p> injection of change to bring about a reduction of the operating costs</p>
<p> of businesses in rural and regional Australia that any government</p>
<p> has ever offered. And it is on top, of course, of the significant</p>
<p> reductions in interest rates which have been enjoyed by businesses</p>
<p> and farmers throughout Australia over the last two-and-a-quarter years.</p>
<p>Now, of course, I hasten to add that, as in common with all other</p>
<p> sections of the Australian community, people operating businesses</p>
<p> and farms within rural and regional Australia will also enjoy the</p>
<p> benefits and will also enjoy the credits that are involved in our</p>
<p> planned changes to the personal income tax scales.</p>
<p>But the significance to the transport industry of these changes is</p>
<p> quite historic. They will bring about a reduction of something like</p>
<p> six to seven per cent in the costs of transport throughout Australia.</p>
<p> And that applies whether you're in the bush or whether you're</p>
<p> in the metropolitan areas of Australia. But it stands to reason that</p>
<p> those parts of Australia which require the transportation over long</p>
<p> distances of goods from one point to another will obviously gain,</p>
<p> in proportionate terms, much more than other parts of the Australian</p>
<p> community.</p>
<p>And I have, in the 24 years that I've been in Parliament, I've</p>
<p> been in receipt of almost consistent complaints from people who live</p>
<p> in country areas of our nation about the additional costs that they</p>
<p> have to pay because goods have got to travel longer distances before</p>
<p> they are put into production activity or they are consumed. And what</p>
<p> this particular part of the tax plan does, ladies and gentlemen, is</p>
<p> to deliver a very, very heavy blow in favour of reduced costs. It</p>
<p> delivers more through reduced cost structure for regional and rural</p>
<p> Australia than any other particular measure that any government has</p>
<p> offered since World War II. And the benefits to the Australian economy</p>
<p> of that are enormous. And they're not benefits that are limited</p>
<p> to rural Australia. They are enormous export benefits.</p>
<p>One of the features of this plan is that it will reduce the annual</p>
<p> cost of Australian exports by an estimated $4.5 billion. It will reduce</p>
<p> the total costs of Australian business by an estimated $10 billion.</p>
<p> Because I have to stress again and again that what you will now get</p>
<p> under this plan if you run a business, is a capacity to get a full</p>
<p> rebate of tax paid on your input costs. Whereas under the existing</p>
<p> ramshackle wholesale tax system there are some rebates in relation</p>
<p> to manufacturers inputs but there are many things that you have to</p>
<p> buy in order to produce your goods on which you pay wholesale tax</p>
<p> of up to 22 or 32 per cent and you don't get any of that back</p>
<p> from the taxation department by way of a rebate. But that will all</p>
<p> be swept away, and under the new plan the 10 per cent that is paid</p>
<p> will be fully rebateable because it is paid on an input to your business</p>
<p> activity, and that is the great virtue for business and therefore</p>
<p> for the Australian economy of having a GST instead of the existing</p>
<p> wholesale taxes.</p>
<p>And there is no way that any alternative plan can deliver those $10,000</p>
<p> million of savings for business or those $4.5 billion savings for</p>
<p> our export industry without the introduction of a broad-based goods</p>
<p> and services tax. You can't stand up and say to the Australian</p>
<p> people: we want to reduce business costs but we won't have a</p>
<p> GST. You have to face the moment of truth. You either are serious</p>
<p> about taxation reform or you want to fiddle at the edges. You either</p>
<p> want to say to the Australian people: we will give you tax relief</p>
<p> with reform or we will try and kid you that we can give you tax relief</p>
<p> without reform. Well, that option is no longer available and the Australian</p>
<p> people will, I believe, understand that in the weeks ahead. And I'm</p>
<p> sure that the transport industry understands the enormous value to</p>
<p> their business and the enormous business to Australia of us being</p>
<p> able to offer this kind of sweeping change to their cost structure.</p>
<p>The last thing I want to say, ladies and gentlemen, is that the plan</p>
<p> I announced on the Government's behalf last Thursday is not something</p>
<p> that stands out there alone, it is the next necessary step in making</p>
<p> our country stronger. It's the next essential step in making</p>
<p> our country more competitive and it is the next necessary step in</p>
<p> ensuring that we have the best possible protection against the impact</p>
<p> of the Asian economic downturn.</p>
<p>In the two and a quarter years we've been in office we've</p>
<p> turned the deficit of $10.5 billion into a surplus of $2.7 billion.</p>
<p> We've produced the lowest interest rates in 30 years. We've</p>
<p> generated 300,000 more jobs. We've created economic conditions</p>
<p> that have the lowest inflation rate in the industrialised world and</p>
<p> a historically high level of business investment. Our opponents who</p>
<p> left us with that huge deficit have simultaneously said that we shouldn't</p>
<p> have got the budget into surplus but they are, at the same time expressing</p>
<p> or shedding crocodile tears about the preservation of that surplus.</p>
<p>We have the runs on the board in terms of economic management and</p>
<p> what we're offering to the Australian public with this tax plan</p>
<p> is not a gimmick, is not just a tax handout without reform but a genuine,</p>
<p> long-term, for the future of Australia, restructuring of our taxation</p>
<p> system. And if I wanted the Australian people to have one view and</p>
<p> one view alone of our tax plan, I would want them to see it as an</p>
<p> attempt, for the sake of Australia, to give this country, for the</p>
<p> long-term, for the 21st Century, a taxation system that</p>
<p> recognises the nature of the Australian nation, the size of the Australian</p>
<p> nation, the distances to be traveled within the Australian nation,</p>
<p> and a taxation system designed for all of us to produce a stronger</p>
<p> and more economically viable Australia into the 21st Century.</p>
<p> It's a great plan for Australia and for the sake of Australia's</p>
<p> future, it deserves your support. Thank you.</p>
<p>[Ends]</p>
