TEL PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY THE ACTING PRIME MINISTER, THE HON KIM<br />
BEAZLEY MP<br />
RAINBOW WARRIOR 11<br />
The incident overnight in which the Greenpeace vessel Rainbow Warrior I1<br />
was seized by the French Navy off Mururoa Atoll further illustrates the<br />
serious damage being done to the international image of France as a result<br />
of its decision to resume nuclear testing.<br />
The root cause of this incident was the deplorable decision of the French<br />
Government to resume testing in the South Pacific. Today's events should<br />
send a message to the people of France that their Government has erred in<br />
resuming the tests against the will of indigenous populations in the South<br />
Pacific, and against the tide of international opinion.<br />
The Australian Government is also concerned that excessive force may have<br />
been used to seize the vessel, including the use of tear gas against unarmed<br />
protesters. The French Ambassador to Australia was called into the Department of<br />
Foreign Affairs and Trade in Canberra this morning to provide information<br />
and an assurance about the proper treatment and release of the Australians<br />
on board. Initial reports indicated five Australians were on board the vessel,<br />
including two media personnel.<br />
