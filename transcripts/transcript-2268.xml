BRAVERY AWARD3 TO TWO CANBERRA MEN<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton<br />
Two Canberra men have received bravery awards for their part<br />
in rescuing an elderly woman from a fire in the Canberra suburb of Narrabundah<br />
earlier this year.<br />
They are Mr. Arthur Joseph Parr of Toolambi Street, Narrabundah,<br />
and Patrick Neil Mcllhaton, of the same address.<br />
Her Majesty The Queen has awarded Mr. Parr the British Empire<br />
Medal for Gallantry, while the Governor-General, under his delegated authority<br />
from The Queent has approved the award of The Queen's Commendation for Brave<br />
Conduct to Mr. Mclllhaton.<br />
Citation At about I am on Friday, 13 February, Mr. Parr awakened to find<br />
the house on the opposite side of Toolambi Street on fire. He woke the other<br />
occupants of his home, one of whom was Mr. Mclllhato-, and asked his wife<br />
to go to a neighbour's home to ring the fire brigade and the police.<br />
The two men ran across to the burning house but were unable to<br />
open the front door. They then went to the back door, which was open. O<br />
hearing the weak voice of an elderly woman calling out to him, Mr. Parr went<br />
inside but was forced back by the smoke and heat. He got a garden hose and<br />
re-entered the house playing water on the seat of the -fire in the lounge room.<br />
When he was again forced to leave the house by the density of tpe smoke<br />
and the heat, Mr. Parr was relieved by Mr. Mclllhatorn who continued to fight<br />
the fire. Mr. Parr obtained a torch and went into the burning lounge room.<br />
With Mr. Mclllhaton's aid, he moved the woman from the house across the road<br />
to his own home before the fire brigade, ambulance and police arrived.<br />
The elderly woman died fifteen days later a, a result of the<br />
very severe burns she had suffered.<br />
Messrs Parr and McIllhaton, untraled fire Cghters, displayed<br />
considerable courage and disregard for their own safety in rescuing the<br />
woman from her burning home.<br />
