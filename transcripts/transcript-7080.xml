PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF COMMENTS AT PETRA, JORDAN, 25 JANUARY 1987<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
PM: the mind boqgles at-the bril1liance-and the geometricalcapacity,<br />
the architectural capacity, without any of the sorts<br />
of aids to which we have become accustomed. But to get the form<br />
in buildings like this-without sorts--of-asistAnce or -instrudents<br />
that we are aware and the labour that had to go in this without<br />
any mechanical assistance, just boggles the mind. When you come<br />
in first and see the Treasury Building, as you come through the<br />
narrow defile the form of that as I say it is staggering to<br />
see that that could have been done. I think more than any other<br />
place I have ever been in this is the sort of place that makes<br />
you project your mind back and think how they lived and how they<br />
built. If you were able to go back in time and see something,<br />
be there at that time, this is where I would like to be.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you think more leaders should come to places like<br />
this? Do you think it is in some way humbling?<br />
PM: It certainly makes you very much aware of your own mortality<br />
and insignificance in time.-<br />
JORDANIAN JOURNALIST: inaudible q~ stion..<br />
PM: It has just confirmed my very warm friendship towards the<br />
Jordanian Government and people. They have been extraordinarily<br />
kind to us and it was a very great thrill this morning to be able<br />
to go to Pella and to see there the cooperation between the Jordanian<br />
antiquities authorities and our archaeological team from the Sydney<br />
University. It gave me a great deal of pleasure to be able to<br />
say to them there when they told me that they could do more work<br />
if the? had another $ 30,000 to have 2 people there permanently<br />
to announce that I would arrange to find that money from private<br />
sources in Australia because that will enable a continuation of<br />
the work there. It was very exciting. The finds go back for<br />
250,000 years BC. And they say -that. it is more exciting than<br />
any other archaeological find anywhere in the Middle East because<br />
they have got layer upon layer successive the ages, as I say,<br />
going back to 250,000 years BC they have found material there.<br />
So it is good to have these sorts of associations between Australia<br />
and Jordan to have work being done together which is going to<br />
help to increase the understanding of people about our history.<br />
our background.<br />
JOURNALIST: It is back to political reality tomorrow, Mr Hawke,<br />
flying to Israel. You seem to have been embraced very warmly<br />
by Jordan since you have been here. Do you feel that perhaps<br />
Israel might be a little uncomfortable that you have been embraced<br />
too warmly. </p>
<p>a 2.<br />
PM: Israel is very much aware of the friendships I have had with<br />
Jordan going back for a very long period. And it is obviously<br />
the case that the Jordanians have a very committed approach to<br />
trying to get a just and reasonable and durable peace in the region<br />
and I am sure the Israelis understand that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Have you thought any more about what approach you<br />
might adopt when you are in Israel, Mr Hawke?<br />
PM: I am quite aware of the approach I will adopt but I don't<br />
intend to announce that publicly.<br />
JOURNALIST: The local press has reported that you have actually<br />
,-endorsed-King--Hussein'-s -plan--for an-international-peace-con-fere nce~-<br />
Does that mean that you accept and endorse the need for the Soviet<br />
. Union and the United States to be involved in such a conference?<br />
PM: I have said that I agree with the concept of the Jordanian<br />
_ idea. of an internation -al * con ference. And -as I understand the<br />
composition of that conference is something that will have to<br />
be worked out between the parties involved. I certainly understand<br />
their thinking about the composition of the conference. They<br />
say it is a matter that will have to be worked out between the<br />
parties. JOURNALIST: Do you also understand Israel's objection to the<br />
Soviet Union being involved?<br />
PM: Yes, I think I do. Kerry. You are learning about things<br />
now after your first boo-boo are you?<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, the Jordan Times was suggesting that Australia<br />
could have a very important role to play while in Israel because<br />
of the way you picked while in Jordan, were you pleased to<br />
read that?<br />
PM: I haven't read it yet. I guess it will be conveyed to me.<br />
I have no reason to change what .1 said before and that is we don't<br />
exaggerate our roles or our capacities but simply say that if<br />
those involved think that we can be of some assistance then we<br />
are ready to do that. But I don't think anyone's interests are<br />
served by exaggerating what we may simply as a result of being.<br />
But certainly it is the case that we had a very warm cordial,<br />
constructive session yesterday with the Prime Minister then of<br />
course with His Majesty afterwards. And I am certainly very,<br />
very much better informed now about the thinking of this important<br />
party than I was before.<br />
