9/ 12/ 68 COVE BAUXITE/ ALUMINA PROJECT<br />
STATEMENT BY PRIME MINISTER<br />
M JG-GRTON<br />
The Government has given approval in principle<br />
for a proposal to enable the doubling of the previously<br />
planned size of the Gove bauxite/ alumina project.<br />
It has also agreed that Australian participation<br />
in the enlarged project will initially be 30% which<br />
represents an Australian investment, in terms of money,<br />
nearly twice as large as that previously contemplated.<br />
The original proposal was for the construction<br />
of an alumina plant with a capacity of half a million tons<br />
a year at a cost, including ancillary services, of $ 100<br />
million. Under the terms of the agreement between the<br />
Commonwealth and Nabalco Pty. Ltd., announced on<br />
September 1965 50% of the capital of Nabalco was to be held<br />
by Australian interests and 50% by Swiss Aluminium Ltd.<br />
The agreement provided, however, that Australian<br />
interests were not bound to supply 50% of the capital unless<br />
a profit of 7-1/ 2% per year on the whole of the equity capital<br />
of the Company could be seen to be available for a period<br />
of twenty years. If this profit could not be seen to be anticipated<br />
the Australian interests could withdraw in which case Swiss<br />
Aluminium Ltd was committed to go ahead alone and if<br />
Australian capital was not available had the right to<br />
go ahead alone. Subsequently a comprehensive feasibility<br />
study showed that the economics of an alumina plant with<br />
a capacity of half a million tons a year were such that<br />
continued Australian participation was out of the question<br />
because of the low return on capital which was expected.<br />
The prospective return on capital of an alumina<br />
plant with a capacity of one million tons per annum, which<br />
is now proposed, costing $ 300 million was also not nearly<br />
high enough to assure continued participation by Australian<br />
capital. -/ 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
However, Swiss Aluminium Ltd. knew that the<br />
Government placed great importance on Australian<br />
participation in this venture and willingly co-operated<br />
in helping to overcome the difficulty presented to the<br />
Australian interests concerned because of the higher<br />
capital investment required, and the lower profitability<br />
disclosed by the feasibility study.<br />
In the result it is proposed that Australian<br />
interests will provide 30% of the capital required for<br />
a joint venture. Under the terms of the arrangement Australian<br />
interests will own their share of the alumina produced.<br />
Swiss Aluminium Limited will buy this alumina for twenty<br />
years at prices which have been agreed, should the<br />
Australian interests require this, but the Australian<br />
interests can make their own arrangements for sale of<br />
the alumina elsewhere should they wish to do so.<br />
Further, Swiss Aluminium Ltd. have agreed that<br />
the Australian interests have the right to export up to<br />
million tons of bauxite over a 20 year period, the profits<br />
from the sale of which are to go exclusively to the<br />
Australian interests concerned.<br />
In the future either the Swiss, or the Australian<br />
venturers may undertake an expansion of the plant to<br />
give it a capacity of more than one million tons per year<br />
and should that occur the other venturer has the right<br />
to subscribe 50% of the additional funds required and to<br />
take 50% of the additional production.<br />
In accordance with the terms of the original<br />
agreement the perimeter areas will now be included in<br />
the joint venturers' lease.<br />
The Swiss Company has been told that should future<br />
circumstances permit a return to the original concept of<br />
overall Australian participation on terms fair to all<br />
concerned the Government would look to the Swiss Company<br />
to co-operate in bringing this about.<br />
Under the approved arrangements the joint venturers<br />
will continue to be responsible for the construction of<br />
all associated facilities other than those needed for<br />
direct Government purposes such as the police station,<br />
court house, school, hospital, Government offices, and<br />
accommodation for Government employees. Special attention<br />
has been given to measures designed to ensure that the<br />
interests of the Aboriginal people in the area are given<br />
full weight, and to enable them to take the fullest advantage 3/. </p>
<p>-3-<br />
of the opportunities opened to them by the development.<br />
When the plant reaches full production upwards of $ 850,000<br />
a year will be payable to the Aborigines Benefit Trust<br />
Fund from royalties. In all the circumstances the Government believes<br />
the national interest has been served by acceptance of<br />
these proposals. The alumina plant will be one of the largest in the<br />
world. A township of more than 4,000 people will be constructed<br />
in the sparsely populated North, and a framework has been<br />
provided in which Australian interests have a substantial<br />
share in a very large undertaking and also retain good prospects<br />
for future expansion of the percentage of that Australian interest.<br />
