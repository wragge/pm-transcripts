    <content><![CDATA[<p>P. M. No. 106/ 1966</p>
<p>The delegation to accompany me to the Manila ConferenceÂ on Viet Nam has now been arranged.</p>
<p>It will include the Minister for External Affairs, Mr. PaulÂ Hasluck, the Minister for Defence, Mr. Allen Fairhall, the Chairman of theÂ Chiefs of Staff Committee, Lieutenant -General Sir John Wilton, and senior<br />officers of the Prime Minister's, External Affairs and Defence DepartmentsÂ and The Treasury.</p>
<p>Together with the necessary secretarial backing, there willÂ be some 20 people in the Australian party. For a number of practicalÂ reasons, including lack of available accommodation on regular flights, it<br />has been decided to take advantage of an arrangement offered on satisfactoryÂ terms by Qantas for the charter of a jet aircraft for the journey to and fromÂ Manila. Seating will be made available to the New Zealand Prime Minister,Â Mr. Holyoake and his official party and also to a number of representatives ofÂ Australian press, radio and television who are arranging to go to Manila forÂ the Conference.</p>
<p>The charter flight is so scheduled as to permit me to remainÂ in Australia until the end of the visit by President Johnson and the arrangementÂ will also enable me to leave for Australia immediately the conference Â ends.Â Another advantage is that all members of the party will be able to arrive asÂ a delegation instead of arriving and being received in Manila in separateÂ groups over a number of days.</p>
<p>We shall leave Sydney on the morning of Sunday, 23rdÂ October. The aircraft will arrive in Manila late in the same day in timeÂ for such pre-conference administrative and other meetings as may beÂ necessary. By leaving promptly at the end of the conference, I expect toÂ be back in Canberra for the closing days of the Parliament.Â </p>
