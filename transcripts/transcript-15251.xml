<p>Good morning,</p>
<p>A few days ago, the Deputy Prime Minister announced an extension of the highly successful Black Spots road funding program with a new injection of $345 million.</p>
<p>This is money that will be spent removing dangerous, and sometimes deadly, locations on Australian roads.</p>
<p>The Government has already spent more than $400 million on this program eliminating thousands of dangerous locations across the country.<br />
 It is estimated by about this time next year that some 130 lives will have been saved as a result of the Black Spots program.</p>
<p>About half the Black Spots funding is spent in regional areas because of the high level of accidents on country roads.</p>
<p>The Federal Government has been able to make this kind of important investment because we have managed the economy carefully and effectively.<br />
 With many Australians heading out on the roads over the Easter break, it is important that all motorists exercise great care.</p>
<p>Please take regular breaks and stop and rest if you're tired. Enjoy the Easter holiday and let's all arrive home safely.</p>
