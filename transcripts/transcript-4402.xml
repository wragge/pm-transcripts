they provided for in the con~ titution itself. They are niot JIi} e many<br />
other referendums which were initiated solely by Canbevw'a, which souglht<br />
to increase the power of Canberra and of politicians, which sought to<br />
undermine the States, which sought to weaken the Senate.<br />
These reefnuswill strengthen the Senate and increase its ability<br />
t. 0 protect the States.<br />
The Constitutional Conventi. on overwhelmingly endorsed the principles<br />
behind the referendune and this Convention was dominated by ' the States.<br />
The States had 12 of the 92 votes at the Convention, the Commonwealth<br />
only 16.<br />
State representatives at the Convention outjnuxrbered Commonwealth<br />
representatives by 4 to I. All four proposals passed in the House<br />
of Representatives without a single dissent. The Senate, the body<br />
whose powers the referenduims are suPPOsed tO thgrertcm, 1 passed theye<br />
fere1dum proposals by ani overwhelTdngc maJority.<br />
All t-he major Federal. Parties support the proposal on a bip tiz-an<br />
) basis.. The National Party organisatiol) in Qu(-( eflS1tfd is firmly<br />

The simple fact is that these referendums wil. l improve our<br />
Conutitut-ion strt-ngthen the Senate and more effectivelyI<br />
protocct the States.<br />
Those referndins are our opportunity to use the amnending p) rocess<br />
the founding fathors bulit ilito the Constitution to ensure that the<br />
Constitution which we are all rightly proud of is strengtLhercad and<br />
cont-Inues to serve the needs of our nation.<br />
-The . fjrst of tlia-four-refer-endumi proposals-is for simutaneous~ eettions<br />

o6f -the QueensJ~ nd Government supported the simultaneous elections<br />
proposal just 7 months ago atVt~ h Constitutional Convention.<br />
The proposal that Federal elections always be held at the same time<br />
. is just plain common 6ense, You should only have to vote in a Federal<br />
mearis we will not have to vote in as many Pederal elections.<br />
It will also protect the less poptilous States like Queensland when<br />
there are separate elections for the House of Representatives political<br />
leaders are tecmpted to appear mainly to the southiern States to New<br />
South Wales and Victor-ia which have over 60 per cent of House of<br />
Reprep~ ontatives* seaits.<br />
But if the Senate, in which all States are equally represented, is<br />
elected at the same time the, campaign must be fought vigorously in<br />
all six States anid the views of the people of the leuss pop'uloua-States are<br />
much more influential.<br />
Somne have said that this referendum is tunnecessary, that simultaneous<br />
elections can be achieved by bringing the House of Representatives<br />
election forward to coincide with that of the Senate. But this is<br />
neither practical nor a des'lrable method of achieving simultaneous<br />
elections.<br />
Unle.-ss the Constitution in chanqged the only way to bring the elections<br />
together would be rep-eatedly t~ o cut short t-he term of the Houve of<br />
RepresentatIves. </p>
<p>-3-<br />
The three year tdrm is hcowever already zelatively short. One of the<br />
shortest parliamentary terms in the democratic world. )? urthier reducing<br />
it would damage good Governiment.<br />
M~ ost importantly this propos . aNwill Maintain'and strengjthen the Senate<br />
and the protection it cgives the St~ tes. tb~ is proposal is not passed<br />
* the future of the Senate will' ultimate ly b; put in jeopardy.<br />
It was an accident that in Nov er 95' when the House of Representat-i~<br />
was dissolved, Bills existed wuxich pe9* tdbt oss ob isle)<br />
Had Liberal Senators not been l'able'to face the people themselves,<br />
a nunibex of them would not have tareed to I. Tlock supply. f<br />
I myself would never have. sought-\ the blocking of supply from a Senate<br />
thiat would not itself have alsoif aceWi7he, people of Australia.<br />
If any House of Parliament were-to sent another House to the polls, while&amp;<br />
not itself facing the people, i-t wouxld not survive. if you believe<br />
in the fundamental principle that the Senate should not be able to<br />
force the Government to the polls unless the Senators themselves face<br />
the voters at the same time the Contitution moust be changed to ensure<br />
this will always occur.<br />
You can do this by voting yes to simultanmeous elections on 21 May.<br />
Unless the preaent situation is changed, I can foresee two alternative<br />
consequences. The Senate migbt refuse to check a bad Governament<br />
unless there were circumstances permitting a double dissolution.<br />
Alternatively, if Senators were to mak~ e the House of Representatives<br />
go to an eledtion alone, the publi. c outcry against the Senate could lead<br />
to the Senate's powers bE, dmg restricted or abolished.<br />
Either of these alternatives would damnage our demoaracy. That is why<br />
it is important thatthis referendum be passed.<br />
The second referendum proposal is that whenever a Senator dies or<br />
rep= n8 lie, will. be replaced for the remainder of J4. teof offitLb<br />
n~ pi~-y. This will guarantee that your choice of parties for<br />
the Senate caninot be altered by accident or design. Under the<br />
Constitution as it now stands, a Senate vacancy can completely change<br />
the party balance.<br />
But only the people should determine the balance of the parties in the<br />
Senate. This is of particular importance to the less populated States<br />
because it is the Senate in which all States are equally represented.<br />
The importance of this cannot be understated, and the example Evan<br />
Adexrnann put to me eei~, brings it home. He often travels home fromJ<br />
Canberra. by air in the samie aircraft as almost all the Queensland<br />
Senators. What would happen he asked if the aeroplane were to be<br />
involved in a tragic accident? Would the people of Queensland, of any<br />
State, be conteri to make the party affilication of their Senators<br />
depend on some State Government observing a Convvention that might<br />
be breached by considerations of political advantage.<br />
Constitutions are supposed to make laws for-this sort of situation now<br />
allow it to depend on the political calculations of Rate Governments. </p>
<p>Once th~ is proposal is accepted, the peoples choice will be preserved<br />
until thiey have an. opportlanity to mnake * another choice at the next<br />
election. The third referendum proposal is to. give voters in the Australi. an<br />
Capital Territory and Northern Territory the basic right to vote in<br />
AustrAlians have. I know~ of no rational or reasonable arg-ument, for<br />
denying it to territorial voters.<br />
They bava the same obligations as other Australians. They pay tax~ es,<br />
they are obliged to observek the laws of the Commonwealth, they vote for<br />
Members of Parliament. The outcome of referendums affect them as Muich<br />
as they do other Australians.<br />
Restoring this right ' mvill. strengthen Australian democracy.<br />
The fourth and final referendum proposal in to set a retiring age: for<br />
Federal Justices. High Coart Justices would retire at 70 and the<br />
retirement age for other Federal Court Judges would be determined by<br />
Parliament. The proposal does not affect the terms of judges<br />
already appointed to the bench.<br />
M~ ost jobs hnve'retireh-ent ages, and for good reason. Judges are<br />
as affected by old age as the rest of us. j<br />
In Queensland the Judges reUring age is set at 70, opposition to the<br />
same retiring age for Federal Judges certainly-cannot be based on any<br />
view that this adversely affects Queansland's judicial system. It is<br />
only fair that after the age of 70 responsibili3ty should be handed over<br />
to younger people. This is even more important, now that the new<br />
system of. Federal Family Court-s has been set up.<br />
All four referendum proposals are fair, just and reasonable. They have<br />
been extensively considered, they have the nupport of all major federal<br />
parties,. they do not i. nvolVe power -for Canberra, thbey will strengthen<br />
the Sena-te and ensiuxe that it can bett-er look after the interes3ts of<br />
the State. Trhey will. mWJ~ e the Constitution work~ better.<br />
, The polls show that all referendums have substantial<br />
support in all States.<br />
Support for the four proposals is strong in ouesan, ?, ueansndez<br />
have taitionally talken a leading role in Constitutional reform.<br />
Voting in favour of referendumsa on no less than 18 of the 32 referendums,<br />
since Fedexation, a far higher proportion than some of the southiern<br />
states.<br />
On Satwrday, I mm sure that t-he people of Queansland will vote kes<br />
on four -more referendums. B3ut those people who tlhink the referendum<br />
propo~ itions should ba passed, cannolt afford ito be complacent.<br />
The referendiun. will not pass themcuelves.<br />
All people who care about constitutional and political reform in this<br />
country have a respongibility to wor); for the xeferendun;.<br />
If we all do this then the referendurs will ) Le pasred and we will have<br />
a Constitution which serves Australiai's needs toore effectively.<br />
