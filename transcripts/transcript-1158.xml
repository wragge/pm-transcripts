finding that the advertisement was published without malice,<br />
and recognises that most of those concerned with its<br />
publication have made suitable apologies, it is of opinion<br />
that it should record its censure of the advertisement and<br />
its reprimand to those concerned in its publication,<br />
namely Mr. Robert Lindsay Abbott, Managing Director<br />
British Motor Corporation ( Australia) Pty. Ltd,<br />
