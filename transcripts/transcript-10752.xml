<p>PEACOCK:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, thanks for joining us. Jeffrey Kennett, even Rupert</p>
<p>   Murdoch, are suggesting that your Government's stalled Â–</p>
<p>   has it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, it hasn't. The Government has had a remarkable record</p>
<p>   of turning the Australian economy around over the last two and a</p>
<p>   bit years. We've got the lowest interest rates in 30 years.</p>
<p>   We've turned a budget deficit of $10.5 billion a year into</p>
<p>   a surplus of </p>
<p>$2.5 billion. We've generated 290,000 new jobs. When I became</p>
<p>   Prime Minister, 143,000 young Australians each year went into apprenticeships</p>
<p>   and traineeships. The figure this year will be more than 200,000.</p>
<p>   We have given the Australian economy protection against the Asian</p>
<p>   economic downturn. When you add all of that up, it is a very fine</p>
<p>   record of achievement in the area of national economic management.</p>
<p>   No other government could have done as well facing such difficulties.</p>
<p>   And the first and most important thing I say to Liberals, in particular,</p>
<p>   this morning is that we have to come out fighting even harder to</p>
<p>   explain to the Australian public just what has been achieved and</p>
<p>   how great has been that achievement over the last two and a quarter</p>
<p>   years.</p>
<p>PEACOCK:</p>
<p>Well, they'll also be explaining a new tax package. Are you</p>
<p>   planning to bring that out, you know, in the next week or so? Is</p>
<p>   it due before Cabinet for the final tick this week?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't talk about Cabinet meetings but I can assure you that</p>
<p>   the tax policy will come out soon. It will be far more than a goods</p>
<p>   and services tax, although that will clearly be part of it. It will</p>
<p>   be an overall tax reform plan and it will be the next logical step</p>
<p>   in giving further protection to Australia against the backdrop of</p>
<p>   the Asian economic downturn. </p>
<p>What's happening in Asia is a reason to go ahead with tax</p>
<p>   reform, not a reason to defer tax reform. </p>
<p>PEACOCK:</p>
<p>Do you agree with your Minister, John Anderson, that it's</p>
<p>   been a problem for you not having the details out there yet?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look, I think there's an expectation, there always is, but</p>
<p>   it's a big reform. The details have got to be right. The context</p>
<p>   has got to be right. And the context is that this is the next thing</p>
<p>   we must do. I mean, if you want Australia to really be hurt by the</p>
<p>   Asian economic downturn, take Mr Beazley's advice and do nothing</p>
<p>   about tax reform.</p>
<p>PEACOCK:</p>
<p>Is it likely to be a popular package, though? I mean, you'll</p>
<p>   be bringing it down before, presumably, the Tasmanian election.</p>
<p>   Is that wise, do you think?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Matt, I believe that the Australian public will look at this package</p>
<p>   and they will see a government that's delivered a fairer tax</p>
<p>   system. We don't intend to put a goods and services tax on</p>
<p>   top of the existing tax system. We won't be increasing the</p>
<p>   overall burden of taxation and we'll be making certain that</p>
<p>   the low-income people in the Australian community are fully protected.</p>
<p>   In a word, yes, I believe it will receive wide community support.</p>
<p>PEACOCK:</p>
<p>But if it becomes an issue in the Tasmanian election and the Liberal</p>
<p>   Government there loses power, that could create big political problems</p>
<p>   for you, could it not?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Matt, the Tasmanian election will be determined on Tasmanian issues.</p>
<p>   And could I say on the Tasmanian election, is that Mr Rundle is</p>
<p>   the only leader in Tasmania who is offering a way forward. He's</p>
<p>   got the courage to give Tasmanians the opportunity to break with</p>
<p>   their past and to give them a relatively debt-free future. Our taxation</p>
<p>   policy will be seen as good for Australia and it will be seen as</p>
<p>   delivering the necessary next step to further strengthen the Australian</p>
<p>   economy.</p>
<p>PEACOCK:</p>
<p>Now, on top of that, on top of the expressed concerns as reported</p>
<p>   by various people like the Treasurer saying that he's concerned</p>
<p>   about the Tasmanian election, we have the National Party, Donald</p>
<p>   Macdonald, saying that you should put off any GST until after the</p>
<p>   impact of the Asian crisis.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I can only repeat what I've said, Matt. And that is</p>
<p>   that it is because of what is happening in Asia that you need to</p>
<p>   go that next step. If you really want the Asian economic downturn</p>
<p>   to burn Australia, if you really want it to singe the flesh of the</p>
<p>   Australian economy, you don't do anything. You just sit on</p>
<p>   your hands, Beazley-like, and say everything's perfectly all</p>
<p>   right - do nothing, say nothing, advocate nothing, merely oppose</p>
<p>   things. Now, we're not going to do that. I'm not going</p>
<p>   to do that. I believe very strongly that the next necessary step</p>
<p>   to further strengthen the Australian economy is to reform and make</p>
<p>   fairer the Australian taxation system.</p>
<p>PEACOCK:</p>
<p>Speaking of inaction, what's your impression about the new</p>
<p>   Japanese Prime Minister designate? Has he got what it takes?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, he certainly has a lot of experience. And we all hope that</p>
<p>   there'll be further measures taken to strengthen the Japanese</p>
<p>   economy. Japan is the second most powerful economy in the world</p>
<p>   and is the economic leader of Asia and Australia's best customer.</p>
<p>   I wish him well. I've written to him. I hope to have early</p>
<p>   contact with him. I expect to see him at the APEC meeting in Kuala</p>
<p>   Lumpur later this year.</p>
<p>PEACOCK:</p>
<p>The United States has certainly expressed its concern about what</p>
<p>   could happen in Japan. How critical is it that they take firm action?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, it is very important to Australia because Japan is such a</p>
<p>   big economy and is such a strong customer of Australia. But you're</p>
<p>   making my argument. The more people argue that there is a problem</p>
<p>   in Asia, the more necessary it is that we take all the steps we</p>
<p>   can in Australia which are within our own grasp and power to strengthen</p>
<p>   the Australian economy. We can't make economic changes in Japan</p>
<p>   but we can make economic changes in Australia and we can reform</p>
<p>   the tax system. And if we have a better tax system we will export</p>
<p>   more because exports will be cheaper and more competitive. Now isn't</p>
<p>   that a reason to do it rather than not to do it? Isn't that</p>
<p>   a reason to do it while there is an Asian economic downturn rather</p>
<p>   than to put it off?</p>
<p>PEACOCK:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, you talk about do nothing Beazley but in Western Australia</p>
<p>   it appears nothing has been done about the issue of preferences.</p>
<p>   Wouldn't it be unconscionable if the leader of the Labor Party</p>
<p>   were to lose his seat because your party put One Nation ahead of</p>
<p>   him?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I am sure that in the end the right thing will be done about</p>
<p>   preferences in Western Australia. But the Western Australian division</p>
<p>   will decide that in its own time and not when it is told to do so</p>
<p>   by Mr Beazley who is hardly the person that we principally set out</p>
<p>   each morning to convenience, or indeed, any section of the media.</p>
<p>   That decision will be taken at the right time by the Western Australian</p>
<p>   branch.</p>
<p>PEACOCK:</p>
<p>Is it, to use Mr Costello's words, matter of principle over</p>
<p>   party politics?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well what really matters in the end is the decision that is taken</p>
<p>   rather than the timing which it's taken, isn't it?</p>
<p>PEACOCK:</p>
<p>Mr Costello's been a bit loose with his words in recent weeks.</p>
<p>   How do you explain that, I mean was he a bit disoriented by the</p>
<p>   Queensland election?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Enough has been said about that issue last week and I don't</p>
<p>   intend to say any more. I am focused on good policy. I am focused</p>
<p>   on the Government building on the economic success that I outlined</p>
<p>   at the beginning of this interview. That is what the Australian</p>
<p>   public wants from me. It's what it wants from all members of</p>
<p>   my Government. That is a focus on doing good things for Australia.</p>
<p>PEACOCK:</p>
<p>If you are focused on that, how do you explain your flip-flop on</p>
<p>   Telstra or do you say that you're still - it's unimaginable</p>
<p>   that you won't sell 100 per cent?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well there's certainly been no flip-flop. I can't believe</p>
<p>   the description of last week's announcement as being flip-flop.</p>
<p>   We are still committed to a sale of 100 per cent of Telstra.</p>
<p>PEACOCK:</p>
<p>It is a retreat on your previous position, though, is it not?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well Matt, the Senate said Â‘no' to our previous position.</p>
<p>PEACOCK:</p>
<p>You said...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I am sorry, can I just finish. We expected in the face of that</p>
<p>   to have simply bowled the legislation up again in exactly the same</p>
<p>   form. We would then have been told that we were stubborn and naive</p>
<p>   and because we have made an announcement which confirms that it</p>
<p>   is going to be sold in stages and there's going to be a process</p>
<p>   to ensure that the community service obligations are met then that's</p>
<p>   called a flip-flop. It's not a flip-flop. I mean we remain</p>
<p>   committed to a sale of the whole of Telstra and the great advantage</p>
<p>   of that is that when it is completed we'll have been able to</p>
<p>   cut in half, from $82 billion at the end of June last, cut in half</p>
<p>   the entire Federal Government debt of Australia. And the interest</p>
<p>   that will be saved on the $40 billion that we will get for the sale</p>
<p>   of Telstra can be used to provide more roads, more hospitals and</p>
<p>   greater education and health facilities all around Australia.</p>
<p>PEACOCK:</p>
<p>So there's no real difference, I mean you are still going</p>
<p>   to sell 100 per cent. Why bother with this inquiry?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well for the very good reason that people are concerned to ensure</p>
<p>   that the community service obligations of Telstra are being met.</p>
<p>   And that is why we are going to do it in stages. We are, first of</p>
<p>   all, going to sell up to 49 per cent and then we are going to have</p>
<p>   this inquiry and only when we....</p>
<p>PEACOCK:</p>
<p>Is it conceivable that this inquiry would recommend that you don't</p>
<p>   sell it and that you won't?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The inquiry won't be tasked to recommend for or against the</p>
<p>   sale. It will be asked to report on the extent to which Telstra</p>
<p>   has met clear benchmarks which have been laid down in the legislation.</p>
<p>   Then the Government will consider that report and we have made it</p>
<p>   clear we won't go ahead unless we are satisfied that those</p>
<p>   conditions have been met. So, far from being a backdown, I saw last</p>
<p>   week's announcement as being a very sensible and pragmatic</p>
<p>   way to deal with the issue. We remain committed to our goal because</p>
<p>   by getting rid of that huge debt we'll be able to spend more</p>
<p>   money on roads and schools and hospitals but at the same time we</p>
<p>   established a mechanism to make certain that the legitimate concerns</p>
<p>   people had were met.</p>
<p>PEACOCK:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, Minister Reith who has been unusually quiet these</p>
<p>   days says that he has a second wave of industrial relations reforms.</p>
<p>   How critical will that be in your next election campaign to keep</p>
<p>   union officials, for example, off sites?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, the process of industrial relations reform has got to go</p>
<p>   on and we have been very successful this term. We have had the lowest</p>
<p>   number of industrial disputes for 30 or 40 years despite all the</p>
<p>   predictions of chaos by Mr Kelty and Mr Beazley and that process</p>
<p>   goes on. It won't be as important perhaps as some other issues</p>
<p>   but it is there, it is part of the process of further economic reform</p>
<p>   and change that we continue to need in the Australian community.</p>
<p>PEACOCK:</p>
<p>You have decided not to attend the South Pacific Forum this year,</p>
<p>   is that a good signal for our neighbours at a difficult time like</p>
<p>   now?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Matt, my attendance at that forum - I went to the first two meetings</p>
<p>   and the fact that I won't be going this year doesn't alter</p>
<p>   the fact that we will be represented at a senior level by Mr Downer.</p>
<p>   Given the other commitments I have I think everybody fully understands</p>
<p>   it. Mr Keating and Mr Hawke didn't go to every one of those</p>
<p>   meetings any more than I do.</p>
<p>PEACOCK:</p>
<p>Thanks very much for joining us this morning.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Pleasure.</p>
