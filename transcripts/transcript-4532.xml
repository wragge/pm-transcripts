FOR PRESS 6 NOVEMBER 1977<br />
ELECTORATE TALK<br />
The figures just released by the Commonwealth Employment Service<br />
show that tens of thousands of Australipans were put out of<br />
work by the-Victorian power strike. Jobs were lost because<br />
strikes and other dis ' ruptive action sent companies bankrupt,<br />
and unable to keep producing.<br />
A handful of union leaders created conditions that led to<br />
social and economic dislocation throughout Australia.<br />
The most. damaging strikes in recent months have been designed<br />
to break wage indexation guidelines, flout the authority of<br />
the Arbitration Commission, and boost the inflationary wage spiral.<br />
The power strike in Victoria was a classic example of this tactic.<br />
More than 450,000 people were laid of f in Victoria and other<br />
States, and as the latest unemployment figures show, 37,000<br />
are still registered as unemployed as a direct result of that strike.<br />
Strikes in other areas the Builders Labourers Federation in<br />
Victoria, Norwich Park, and the Queensland Meat Workers strike<br />
also caused dislocation and unemployment.<br />
This attempt by some extremist union officials, in a few key unions,<br />
to attack our system of arbitration will be resisted by your<br />
government. We will not wash our hands of this kind of behaviour,<br />
as the Leader of the opposition does. It is Mr Whitlam who<br />
refuses point blank to condemn these extremists in their attempts<br />
to deny thousands of Australians the right to work.<br />
The reason is clear. Those extremists all run unions that are<br />
af filiated with t-he Labor Party u" LOP.-delegates vote on<br />
Labor Party policy which is bindig on all Labor parliamentarians.<br />
They are the so-called industrial wing of Mr Whitlam's own Party.<br />
Yet as leader, will he take the responsible course and repudiate<br />
their tactics? No, he remains silent.<br />
My Government has not stood by idly. We have acted firmly and<br />
fairly. We have passed laws that make sure the public interest<br />
is more easily protected in times of industrial disruption, and<br />
that give rank and file unionists a greater say in how their own<br />
union is run. / 2<br />
EMBARGO: </p>
<p>Last year * we., passed laws for secret postal ballots for union<br />
elections. our. Industrial Relations Bureau is now working to<br />
make sure that the law is observed. We have provided<br />
for breaches of industrial law, and we have created the conditions<br />
where for the first time effective action can be taken under<br />
the Conciliation and Arbitration Act to deal with demarcation<br />
disputes. We have also established the circumstances in which<br />
trade unions must report to their own members about their financial<br />
affairs.<br />
What did the men of the Labor Party the self-styled guardians<br />
of the working man do when we introduced our industrial legislation?<br />
They condemned it, they opposed it, they tried to stop it<br />
becoming law. They were running scared behind their so-called<br />
industrial wing. The Labor Party has. condemned every piece of<br />
industrial-. legislation we have introduced. They have opposed<br />
secret ballots which are designed to give union members a real<br />
say in the running of their union. They opposed legislation which<br />
will protect the right to work. They opposed it not because<br />
they-thought it would not work but because it is official<br />
Labor-Party policy to place trade unions above the law.<br />
Mr Whitlan is bound by that policy. When Mr Hayden or even<br />
Mr Uren takes over, they will be bciund by that policy.<br />
And that is why, a year ago Mr Whitlam defended political<br />
strikes by trade unions. That is why a few days ago he refused<br />
to say what a Labor government would do if a union refused to<br />
accp an lziLrLUo-a % Commission decision. He claimed that no<br />
government eve. r-s olved n industrial dispute. That is nonsenseand<br />
he knows it.<br />
It was the Commonwealth Government that brought the crippling<br />
air controllers strike to an end, and that ended the<br />
postal dispute at Redfern. It was the strong stand of both the<br />
Victorian and Commonwealth Governments that led to the ending<br />
of the Victorian power dispute. The Western Australian Government<br />
has recently ended a damaging dispute in that State.<br />
Labor failed to control the extremist unions when it was in<br />
government. Given another chance, it would still surrender.<br />
Mr Whitlam claims concern. for the unemployed, Yet he was the<br />
man who has refused to disown the extraordinary statement of his<br />
Shadow Minister for. Industrial Relations, when he publicly<br />
. supported the 2,000 Victorian power workers who held the State<br />
to_. ransom,. and__ caused massive additional unemployment.<br />
Mr Whitlam's record shows he knows nothing about-creating jobs.<br />
His government produced a record rise in unemployment 157%<br />
in one year. He'll never get a chance to do that again.<br />
because I don't believe Australians will ever again want him<br />
in a position of authority. </p>
