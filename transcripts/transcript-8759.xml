TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER THlE HON PJ. KEATING, MP<br />
DOORSTOP, ABC STUDIO, PERTH, 8 DECEMBER 1992<br />
E OE PROOF COPY<br />
J: whcn will you begin articulating a fifth term agenda?<br />
PM: Lct's call it a second term agenda, and it will be in the appropriate part of the<br />
cycle in the run-up to the next election.<br />
J: Do you believe this-poll that gives you a seven point lead over the<br />
Opposition?<br />
PM; There has been a confirmation of the polling of recent months in the various<br />
polls so, I think, three or four polls are all within range of one another and,<br />
of course, it will remain to he scen wvhether this month the other polls<br />
corroborate what the Newspoll is saying.<br />
J: So when is the election Prime Minister?<br />
PM: I've said that I think the public should get value from the Parliaments and<br />
they shouldn't bc truncated and we haven't. The Government, this<br />
Parliament, is three years old in March next year so, as I said, any time after<br />
Christmas, in the new year, is basically the Parliaments end.<br />
J: Would you prefer like Bob Hogg to go after the Western Australian poll?<br />
PM: I don't discuss the Labor Party's tactics~ in public. I will keep all flexibility<br />
for us against the Liberals.<br />
J: Peter Reith is blaming the industrial disruption in Victoria for the Liberal's<br />
slump. Do you think that is what has caused you to go up in the polls?<br />

PM: No, we've been going up steadily in thc second half of the year and I think it<br />
is because of thc Government's policies of inclusion. The Governmenit is<br />
seeking to have a community perspective and an emphasis on community<br />
values where thc Liberal Party emphasis is on individual values. If you<br />
support thc wealthy, they say the wealthy will drag the rest of us along. I<br />
think the public don't believe that, One hundred and sixty million<br />
Americans have just voted against that, they voted for community values<br />
and if you look at the progress wc have made this year and on a whole range<br />
of issues in education, in transportation, in the environment, in industry,<br />
whcrcver you see it and, of course, need I say in s ' ocial policy wherever<br />
you see thesc things, I think the public believe that this is the way to<br />
proce, and they don't believe that lifting tax and cutting wages as Dr<br />
Hewson wants to do is going to help anybody but those who don't need help,<br />
that's the welfare. God help us when the dominant national values of<br />
Australia have to be focussed on the benefits to the wealthy.<br />
J: Prime Minister, is the west Labor's Achilles heel and what can you do about<br />
it?<br />
PM: That is believed, I don't know whether it is true. The polls, though, are not<br />
as strong for us here as they have been. I think the only thing to do about it<br />
is try and articulate our policies as often as I can, as I've been doing today<br />
on radio and on television. There is obviously some sort of feeling in the<br />
West Australian media which is at odds with that which is carried in the east<br />
and it is making a difference here of some kind. But how large, time will<br />
tell.<br />
J. Mr Keating, you admitted that the Labor States were worried about the<br />
second part of your industrial relations legislation relying on the external<br />
affairs power. Are you willing to make any changes as a result of the<br />
consultations?<br />
PM: Worry does not imply legitimacy or legitimate worry. Legitimacy is if<br />
Australia has ratified a sct of conventions which the States agreed to,<br />
including the Labor statcs. With that ratification, why are they worried<br />
when we may legislate to impose the conditions, the international minima<br />
which those ratifications establish? I think it is a concern about something<br />
that they don't quite know all about and we intend to try and overcome that<br />
by consulting with them before we bring the Bills in.<br />

J; Prime Minister following on your theme about the politics of inclusion, wil<br />
you be planning to develop policies along the lines of a more managed<br />
economic intervention for next year?<br />
PM: That is too leading a question because it begs an economic reply and I don't<br />
think wc have the time or thc inclination to provide it right here.<br />
J: Just briefly Graham Richardson referred late last week to the idea of using<br />
the tax systemn to help our export industries, would you favour that?<br />
PM: Look, the Government has established for the first time in Australia a true<br />
market economy. It may bc ironic, but it has takcn a Labor Government to<br />
establish a markct economy. But I've always said it has done it with a Labor<br />
heart, and it's done it looking at industries and the needs of industrics in<br />
particular sectors, and that's why our industry policy and the design of our<br />
policy be it in tariff changes or tariff reforms or in other areas of policy<br />
have been ones which I think truly take into account the interest of<br />
Australians. And the potential of industries in areas, say<br />
telecommunications, ship building, pharmiaccutical, are all what one has<br />
termed intervenitionist policies. But we will never turn our back upon what<br />
is essentially a market structure.<br />
J: Prime Ministcr, back to the polls for a second. Do these polls imply that<br />
Australians accept an eleven per cent unemployment figure?<br />
PM: No), I don't think that at all and nor they should, but I think that they believe<br />
that the Government wants to get back to what it does best and that is<br />
crcating jobs as wc showed throughout nearly a decade of the ' 80s. We've<br />
kept most of the employment of the ' 80s and we want to go back to what<br />
we're doing best. I think the public think we are trying to do that, The ' One<br />
Nation' package was about stimulating the economy and pushing it back<br />
into growth; last week's national accounts indicate quite strongly that a<br />
government stimulus is working, is the principal reason why the economy is<br />
recovering and growing as it is, and I think the public take comfort from<br />
that. I think they also take comfort from the policies of inclusion, that we<br />
all go along together and we don't develop an underclass, wve don't let the<br />
unemployed look after themselves without unemployment benefits, we pull<br />
those who are not well off, or need help, along with the rest of us; and we<br />
are not focussing, as the Liberal Party is, upon thc wealthy, saying if they<br />
are well looked after, in their slipstream the rest of us can find some<br />
nourishment. I think that that sort of sterile stuff, which we've seen come in<br />
cycles right throughout the century, is now at this point rejected by nearly </p>
<p>TEL 4<br />
all western governments and certainly by this government. 1 think the<br />
public agree with that.<br />
J: With all the polls moving strongly in thc same direction, do you think<br />
people now have made a final decision about John Hewson?<br />
PM: I don't know, there is only onc poll that matters in the end, I've never been<br />
too worried about opinion polls though I admit I prefer to be in front than<br />
behind. But what have the Liberals got to offer? Thcy say, " if we tax your<br />
food, your clothing and your services, we will put the proceeds off to<br />
abolishing pay roll tax and cutting petrol," and we arc supposed to be<br />
naively bclicving that the cutting of payroll tax and the reduction in petrol<br />
excise will change Australia. That all of a sudden will spring a new<br />
reinvigorated, modern economy from doing those things, cutting petrol<br />
prices and cutting payroll tax. Well of course it is nonsense and I think the<br />
public realises basically the same sterile old stuff from the same tired old<br />
group. That is, thcy start on this premise how can we push more national<br />
income into the wealthy? And the current trick is a consumption tax, a<br />
goods and services tax. Now that's what Dr Hewson stands for and as well<br />
as that he stands for cutting peoples wages, by pushing eight million<br />
Australians onto individual employment contracts and I think the public is<br />
saying, this is dangerous, this is not good, it is not wise, it is not inclusive, it<br />
says nothing about the sense of community, it is partisan and it is dangerous,<br />
and I don't think they like it.<br />
