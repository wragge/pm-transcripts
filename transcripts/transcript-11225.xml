   The Government is pleased to announce a $51 million package of taxation</p>
<p> measures to encourage greater corporate and personal philanthropy</p>
<p> in Australia. This initial annual revenue cost will rise over time</p>
<p> as these measures encourage the further growth of philanthropy.</p>
<p> This announcement supports our determination to draw upon the unique</p>
<p> skills of individuals, business, government and the community to forge</p>
<p> a new social coalition to help create a stronger, fairer Australia.</p>
<p> Through enlightened self interest many businesses already greatly</p>
<p> contribute to their communities. This announcement is further encouragement</p>
<p> to them as it is to others that business can do well by doing good.</p>
<p> The specific taxation measures flow from the recommendations of a</p>
<p> taxation working group, chaired by David Gonski from Wentworth Associates.</p>
<p>  Set up following the Roundtable meeting with business and community</p>
<p> leaders in March last year, this working group was one of a number</p>
<p> that advised the Government on initiatives to promote business and</p>
<p> community partnerships.</p>
<p> Under the new arrangements, to take effect from 1 July 1999, income</p>
<p> tax deductions will be provided for the market value of donations</p>
<p> of property worth more than $5,000, regardless of when it was purchased</p>
<p> or acquired. This is expected to lead to around $45 million each year</p>
<p> in increased donations, with a larger increase predicted over time.</p>
<p> Initially, government revenue will be reduced by around $20 million</p>
<p> per annum.</p>
<p> Existing provisions which allow for deductions for property donations,</p>
<p> such as under the Cultural Gifts Programme, and more generally for</p>
<p> property purchased less than 12 months before the donation, will not</p>
<p> be subject to this $5,000 threshold.</p>
<p> A capital gains tax exemption will also be provided for testamentary</p>
<p> gifts of property to bodies eligible to receive tax deductible donations.</p>
<p> As a result, eligible not-for-profit organisations can expect a $15</p>
<p> million boost in donations once this measure impacts on donor behaviour.</p>
<p>  The Government will also introduce a new category of private charitable</p>
<p> funds. These will need to meet all the criteria now required to qualify</p>
<p> as a public fund, but without the need to seek contributions from</p>
<p> the public. This will provide businesses, families and individuals</p>
<p> greater freedom to set up their own trusts for philanthropic purposes.</p>
<p> This is expected to increase donations by a further $15 million per</p>
<p> year, with a $10 million yearly cost to Government revenue.</p>
<p>  The Government will also provide greater incentives for donations</p>
<p> of property under the Cultural Gifts Programme. These donations will</p>
<p> be exempt from capital gains tax and donors will be able to apportion</p>
<p> their tax deductions for donations over a period of up to five years.</p>
<p> All these measures will help cut through the red tape that has discouraged</p>
<p> many businesses individuals and families who want to give more to</p>
<p> their communities.</p>
<p>  They are also consistent with the goals of the Government's new</p>
<p> tax system to provide choice, opportunity and simplicity to help create</p>
<p> a fairer Australia.</p>
<p> In addition to the new measures, the Government will act on the recommendation</p>
<p> of the Round Table to establish a new body to encourage partnerships</p>
<p> between businesses and communities more generally in Australia. To</p>
<p> be named the Prime Minister's Community Business Partnership,</p>
<p> the organisation will have a board of high profile people drawn from</p>
<p> business and the community.</p>
<p>  The Prime Minister will chair the board, and in his absence it will</p>
<p> chaired by the responsible Minister, Senator Jocelyn Newman on his</p>
<p> behalf. Also represented on the board will be some of the 1998 business</p>
<p> and community Round Table members.</p>
<p> The Partnership will promote and showcase corporate examples of best</p>
<p> practice engagement in the community across the country. It will also</p>
<p> play an important brokerage role by fostering new partnerships between</p>
<p> the community, government and business.</p>
<p>  All these initiatives confirm our commitment to a new social coalition</p>
<p> and demonstrate the further investment the Government is willing to</p>
<p> make to meet its social obligations.</p>
<p> 26 March 1999</p>
