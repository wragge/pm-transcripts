' EMBARGOED UNTIL 11PM AEST CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
OCCASIOIAL ADDRESS<br />
BY THE PRIME MINISTER OF AUSTRALIA<br />
THE HON RJL HAWKE<br />
UNIVERSITY OF WESTERN AUSTRALIA<br />
19 APRIL 1984<br />
CHANCELLOR, VICE CHANCELLOR, FELLOW GRADUATES, FELLOW<br />
STUDENTS, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.<br />
YOU WILL UNDERSTAND THAT IN ACCEPTING THIS HONOUR CONFERRED<br />
UPON ME BY THE UNIVERSITY OF WESTERN AUSTRALIA, I DO SO IN<br />
NO MERE FORMAL WAYS<br />
IOR CAN MY DEEP APPRECIATION OF THIS HONOUR AND OF THIS<br />
OCCASION BE ADEQUATELY EXPRESSED BY ANY MERE FORM OF WORDS.<br />
I CANNOT, HOWEVER, HELP BUT REFLECT THAT IF, 30 AND MORE<br />
YEARS AGO I HAD CHOSEN A DIFFERENT PATH, I MIGHT JUST HAVE<br />
ACHIEVED A DOCTORATE IN MY OWN RIGHT.<br />
As IT IS, I ACCEPT IT AS YET ANOTHER OF THE RICH<br />
PRIVILEGES BESTOWED UPON ME BY THIS UNIVERSITY AND THROUGH<br />
MY ASSOCIATION WITH IT. </p>
<p>I ENTERED THIS UNIVERSITY IN 1947. THAT WAS THE<br />
SAME YEAR I JOINED THE AUSTRALIAN LABOR PARTY, So<br />
TWO OF THE GREAT FORMATIVE AND ENDURING ASSOCIATIONS<br />
OF MY LIFE BEGAN TOGETHER HERE8<br />
I ACCEPT THIS HONOUR AS COMING NOT ONLY FROM THE<br />
UNIVERSITY ITSELF BUT, IN A VERY REAL SENSE, FROM<br />
THE PEOPLE OF WESTFRN AUSTRALIA,<br />
FOR, MORE THAN ANY OTHER UNIVERSITY IN AUSTRALIA,<br />
THIS UNIVERSITY WAS THE CREATION OF THE PEOPLE AND<br />
THE COMMUNITY CREATED AS A ERE UNIVERSITY AND<br />
DEDICATED BY THE PEOPLE OF WESTERN AUSTRALIA TO THE<br />
PRINCIPLE OF EQUALITY OF OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL.<br />
AND SURELY THE GUIDING PRINCIPLE UPON WHICH THIS<br />
UNIVERSITY WAS FOUNDED FINDS A PHYSICAL REFLECTION<br />
IN THE CAMPUS ITSELF BOTH THE MOST BEAUTIFUL AND<br />
THE MOST AUTHENTIC AuI. ALJ. IUi CAMPUS IN THIS COUNTRY,<br />
IT IS A MATTER OF HISTORICAL RECORD THAT THIS<br />
UNIVERSITY SERVED AS THE MODEL FOR ALL THAT WAS TO<br />
COME LATER THROUGHOUT AUSTRALIA, AS THE COMMONWEALTH<br />
MOVED, UNDER SUCCESSIVE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENTS, TOWARDS<br />
ACCEPTANCE OF FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR TERTIARY<br />
EDUCATION IN OUR NATION. </p>
<p>THUS, IT WAS THE FORTUNE OF MY GENERATION OF<br />
WESTERN AUSTRALIANS TO ENJOY A PRIVILEGE NOT EXTENDED<br />
TO OUR FELLOW AUSTRALIANS IN THE OTHER STATES FOR<br />
MORE THAN 20 YEARS AFTER,<br />
BUT THAT WAS ONLY ONE ASPECT OF OUR GOOD FORTUNE.<br />
IT WAS EASY FOR THOSE OF US WHO GREW UP IN POST WAR<br />
AUSTRALIA TO BELIEVE THAT THE OPPORTUNITIES AND<br />
CHOICES BEFORE US, AT LEAST IN THE MATERIAL SENSE,<br />
WERE WIDER THAN THOSE OF ANY PREVIOUS<br />
GENERATION OF AUSTRALIANS.<br />
THE WORK OF POST WAR RECONSTRUCTION, WITH ITS<br />
CARDINAL PRINCIPLE OF FULL EMPLOYMENT, HAD BEEN<br />
CARRIED OUT BY THE CHIFLEY GOVERNMENT WITH A SUCCESS<br />
UNMATCHED ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD.<br />
THE PLANNING FOR RECONSTRUCTION HAD IN FACT BEEN SET<br />
IN TRAIN BY JOHN CURTIN WELL BEFORE THE END OF THE WAR.<br />
AND THE CHIEF ARCHITECT OF THE RECONSTRUCTION, UNDER<br />
BOTH CURTIN AND CHIFLEY WAS ONE OF THE GREATEST<br />
GRADUATES OF THIS UNIVERSITY AND ONE OF THE GREATEST<br />
PUBLIC SERVANTS IN THE HISTORY OF AUSTRALIA DOCOR<br />
COOMBS IN THE OFFICIAL RECORDS, " NUGGET" COOMBS<br />
EVERYWHERE ELSE. </p>
<p>SO, BY THE END OF THE FORTIES, AUSTRALIA, WITH THE<br />
WESTERN ECONOMY AS A WHOLE, WAS ON THE THRESHOLD OF<br />
TWO DECADES OF UNPRECEDENTED AND ALMOST UNINTERRUPTED<br />
ECONOMIC GROWTHS<br />
NOBODY OF THAT GENERATION IN SO MANY WAYS, THE LUCKY.<br />
GENERATION AT LEAST, NOBODY OF THAT GENERATION WITH<br />
ANY SENUITIVITY OR ANY SENSE OF HISTORY OR RESPONSIBILITY<br />
COULD IGNORE, IN 1984, THE CONTRAST WITH THE SITUATION<br />
OF THE PRESENT YOUNG GENERATION OF AUSTRALIANS, AND THE<br />
TREMENDOUS PROBLEMS AND PRESSURES WHICH THE TIMES AND<br />
CIRCUMSTANCES HAVE IMPOSED UPON THEM$<br />
YET THIS GENERATION IS, ON THE WHOLE, THE BEST<br />
QUALIFIED AND BEST EDUCATED GENERATION WE HAVE SO FAR<br />
PRODUCED IN AUSTRALIA@<br />
So IT IS, I BELIEVE, A TASK OF THE UTMOST URGENCY AND<br />
HIGHEST PRIORITY THAT THIS GENERATION SHOULD BE ENABLED<br />
TO ENJOY THE FULLEST MEASURE OF OPPORTUNITY, OF<br />
EXPECTATION, AND OF SELF-FULFILLMENT AS WE PRIVILEGED<br />
STUDENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF WESTERN AUSTRALIA TOOK,<br />
ALMOST FOR GRANTEDp A GENERATION AGO, </p>
<p>AND JUST AS AFTER THE SUPREME CRISIS OF WORLD WAR II,<br />
THE FOUNDATIONS FOR A NEW ERA OF GROWTH AND PROGRESS<br />
WERE LAID BY THE FAR-REACHING PROGRAM OF POST-WAR<br />
RECONSTRUCTION, SO THERE HAS TO BE A NEW NATIONAL<br />
RECONSTRUCTION, AS WE EMERGE FROM THE ECONOMIC CRISIS<br />
OF THE LAST DECADE,<br />
AND THAT IS WHAT MY GOVERNMENT IS NOW UNDERTAKING.<br />
THE TASK OF NATIONAL RECONCILIATION, THE TASK OF NATIONAL<br />
RECOVERY AND THE TASK OF NATIONAL RECONSTRUCTION CANNOT<br />
BE PLACED IN SEPARATE COMPARTMENTS. THEY ARE EACH PART<br />
OF AN INDIVISIBLE, TOTAL ENDEAVOUR,<br />
THE NATIONAL ECONOMIC SUMMIT CONFERENCE A YEAR AGO<br />
SYMBOLISED THIS APPROACH. AND WHILE, PERHAPS, I SHOULD<br />
NOT CLAIM THAT THE CONFERENCE ACHIEVED MORE THAN A<br />
BEGINNING A IMA BEGINNING TO OUR NATIONAL APPROACH<br />
TO OUR PROBLEMS, I THINK I AM ENTITLED TO POINT OUT THAT<br />
SINCE THEN / 210,000 NEW JOBS HAVE BEEN CREATED IN<br />
AUSTRALIA, APART FROM ITS INTRINSIC VALUE, THIS TURN-AROUND IN THE<br />
EMPLOYMENT SITUATION HAS HELPED BUILD A NEW SPIRIT OF<br />
CONFIDENCE IN AUSTRALIA CONFIDENCE IN OURSELVES,<br />
CONFIDENCE IN EACH OTHER AND OUR NATIONAL CONFIDENCE<br />
IN WHAT WE CAN ACHIEVE TOGETHER, .0 </p>
<p>AND IT ALLOWS US TO ADDRESS OURSELVES AS A NATION<br />
TO MANY FUNDAMENTAL, BUT LONG-NEGLECTED STRUCTURAL<br />
PROBLEMS IN OUR ECONOMY AND IN OUR SOCIETY.<br />
THIS LONGER TERM NATIONAL RECONSTRUCTION WHICH WE,<br />
ARE NOW ABLE TO UNDERTAKE REQUIRES A BRINGING TOGETHER<br />
A CO-ORDINATION OF NATIONAL POLICIES ACROSS THE WHOLE RANGE<br />
OF OUR NATIONAL ACTIVITIES INDUSTRY POLICIES, EDUCATION;<br />
SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, SOCIAL SECURITY, TRADE POLICIES<br />
AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS.<br />
NOW, FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE POST-WAR RECONSTRUCTION<br />
AND, INDEED, IN A WAY NOT CONSTITUTIONALLY POSSIBLE OR<br />
POLITICALLY FEASIBLE IN THOSE DAYS WE, AS A NATIONAL<br />
GOVERNMENT, IN CO-OPERATION WITH THE STATES, THE BUSINESS<br />
COMMUNITY AND THE TRADE UNION MOVEMENT OF AUSTRALIA,<br />
ARE ADDRESSING OURSELVES TO THESE PROBLEMS IN A<br />
CO-ORDINATED WAY,<br />
BUT THE NEW RECONSTRUCTION IS BEING CARRIED ON IN A<br />
SOCIETY, A NATION, A REGION AND A WORLD INFINITELY MORE<br />
COMPLEX, MORE CHALLENGING, MORE DIFFICULT AND, SOMETIMES<br />
MORE DANGEROUS THAN THAT WHICH EXISTED CERTAINLY IN<br />
OUR PERCEPTIONS A GENERATION AGO. </p>
<p>44 ALTHOUGH THAT WAS THE GENERATION OF THE SO-CALLED<br />
" tCOLD WAR, THE SUPREME QUESTIONS OF INTERNATIONAL<br />
PEACE, THE THREAT OF NUCLEAR WAR, THE PREVENTION<br />
OF THE PROLIFERATION OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS, ARMS<br />
LIMITATION AND DISARMAMENT WERE THEN PERCEIVED<br />
AS NEITHER SO URGENT, NOR SO DAUNTING AS THEY ARE TODAY$<br />
NOR, IN THOSE DAYS, EVEN IN A WORLD WHERE ENERGY WAS<br />
CHEAP, o ABUNDANT AND APPARENTLY LIMITLESS WERE THERE<br />
THOUGHT TO BE INHIBITIONS AGAINST DEVELOPING NEW SOURCES<br />
OF ENERGY. THE QUESTIONS OF NUCLEAR DISARMAMENT AND THE<br />
DEVELOPMENT OF NUCLEAR POWER WERE SEEN AND, I BELIEVE,<br />
RIGHTLY SEEN AS SEPARATE QUESTIONS* ALTOGETHER.<br />
NOTHING COULD MORE SERIOUSLY REDUCE THE EFFECTIVENESS<br />
OF AUSTRA4IA' S EFFORTS THE DEEP DETERMINATION OF MY<br />
GOVERNMENT TO PLAY A SIGNIFICANT AND INDEED A LEAD ING<br />
ROLE IN THE CAUSE OF DISARMAMENT AND THE PREVENTION<br />
OF NUCLEAR WAR THAN THAT THESE TWO SEPARATE AND DISTINCT<br />
ISSUES SHOULD BECOME CONFUSED.<br />
INDEED ARTICLE 4 OF THE NUCLEAR NON-PROLIFERATION<br />
TREATY THE VERY BASIS OF OUR EFFORTS SPEC[ FICALLY<br />
IMPOSES ON RESOURCE-RICH COUNTRIES LIKE AUSTRALIA A<br />
MORAL OBLIGATION TO SHARE OUR ENERGY RESOURCES,<br />
INCLUDING URANIUM, WITH THE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. </p>
<p>-8-<br />
A THUS AUSTRALIA AND ITS ELECTED GOVERNMENT HAS A<br />
DOUBLE OBLIGATION THE OBLIGATION TO BEND ALL OUR<br />
EFFORTS TOWARDS DISARMAMENT AND THE OBLIGATION TO<br />
SHARE OUR RESOURCES,<br />
WE ARE DETERMINED TO FULFIL THOSE OBLIGATIONS EQUALLY.<br />
AND IN SO DOING WE OF MY GENERATION AS I SAID, IN<br />
SO MANY WAYS, THE LUCKY AUSTRALIAN GENERATION CAN.<br />
FULFIL, IN PART, ITS OVER-NIDING OBLIGATION AND<br />
RESPONSIBILITY TO THIS PRESENT GENERATION AND THE<br />
FUTURE GENERATIONS OF AUSTRALIA,<br />
AND IT IS IN THAT SPIRIT WITH A REAL SENSE OF MY OWN<br />
OBLIGATIONS TO THIS UNIVERSITY AND TO THE PEOPLE OF<br />
WESTERN AUSTRALIA WHO BUILT IT THAT ONCE AGAIN I<br />
EXPRESS MY DEEP APPRECIATION OF THE GREAT HONOUR YOU<br />
HAVE DONE ME TONIGHT, </p>
