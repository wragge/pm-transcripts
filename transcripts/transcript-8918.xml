STATEXENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE RON P J KEATING, NP<br />
NATIONAL ABORIGINAL AND TORRES STRAIT ISLANDER DAY<br />
Today is one of our key national days.<br />
National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander day is the<br />
day on which we celebrate the rich and ancient indigenous<br />
history -and culture of our country. It is the day on which<br />
we contemplate the achievements of the people who lived in<br />
this country and cared for it for 50,000 years or more, and<br />
whose descendants suffered dispossession, prejudice and<br />
brutality after European settlement and yet survived, and<br />
today continue to make a great contribution to our national<br />
life.<br />
This year the Day has extra significance, not only because<br />
it is the International Year of the World's Indigenous<br />
People, but because it is a year in which Australia is<br />
confronting as never before its obligations to Aboriginal<br />
and Torres Strait Islander people.<br />
The legacy of injustice towards the indigenous people of<br />
Australia is in many ways a shameful one. But feelings of<br />
shame or guilt or outrage are not necessary to feel that<br />
things must change. Pride in Australia is all that we<br />
require.<br />
Our international reputation, our self-esteem, our integrity<br />
require that we find answers to the prejudice and injustice<br />
and other problems which indigenous Australians continue to<br />
confront. The High Court's decision on Native Title. gives, us a vital<br />
stepping stone towards finding-these answers.<br />
Today we should reaffirm our intention to build on that<br />
foundation: to put aside prejudice and fear and guilt and,<br />
taking pride in the heritage of indigenous Australians,<br />
commit ourselves to making reconciliation betw ' een indigenous<br />
and non-indigenous Australians one of the strengths of our<br />
society, one of the measures of our democracy, one of the<br />
hallmarks of our belief in Australia.<br />
