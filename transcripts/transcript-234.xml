O SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTEi, THE RT. HON.<br />
R. G. MENZIES AT ORANGE ON MONDAY, THE 24TH<br />
ocToB,. 3.960o_____<br />
Mr. Chairman, Parliamentary colleagues, present and to come,<br />
ladies and gentlemen:<br />
One always has rather mixed feelings about a byelection.<br />
I know that some of you think they are fun: they're<br />
not really. They leave you with mixed feelings.<br />
I'm sorry that we are having a by-election, because it<br />
will seem very odd to me, and I think to you, no longer to have<br />
a Howse in the Federal Parliament, because that is a name of<br />
very great honour and distinction, not only here, but in<br />
Australia. ( Applause)<br />
But it will also, of course, , ive you the opportunity<br />
of putting into Parliament, if you are disposed to elect my<br />
supporter, Mr. W4allace Meares.<br />
Now I want to confess to you that I have a certain<br />
faint responsibility for his presence on the platform, because<br />
I cajoled him a little on the subject of thlis by-election and<br />
was delighted when I heard that he was submitting his name for<br />
your choice. As a matter of fact he referred to his wife. I might<br />
as well tell you, because these secrets arc bound to come out<br />
( Laughter) that his wife's father '. as in politics with me.<br />
, lell make the best of that, or the worst of it, as the case may<br />
be. He represented a country electorate. My father sat in the<br />
Parliament of Victoria with him, and he represented a country<br />
electorate. I had an uncle who sat at that time in the Federal<br />
Parliament, and he represented a country electorate.<br />
In reality, Mrs Moares is bound to back her husband in<br />
this campaign, because it means bringing him back into this neat<br />
fold of politicians members of parliament, people who, at any<br />
rate, have done something to serve their country in public<br />
affairs. Now I noticed that he seemed to be a little modest<br />
tonight about the fact that among his many qualifications is<br />
that he is a very well-known, and favourably known, farmer of<br />
great experience. That's a pretty good thing to be, if you're<br />
going to be elected to represent a country constituency,<br />
But as ho drove me in this afternoon from the airport<br />
he was telling me the kind of thing that a new candidate for<br />
Parliament can tell a battered old veteran like myself with<br />
considerable interest, because Ican remember standing for<br />
Parliament for the first time and all the arguments that went<br />
on, all the rumours that were promoted. They are fascinating<br />
things. The only trouble about them is, that although I go<br />
back for 30 years, they've never changed in the whole of that<br />
time. ( Laughter) He said to me that somebody had said to him, " You<br />
know the trouble about you is that you won a competition of<br />
some kind and therjfore you will be suspected of being an<br />
' intellectual'" and I said " Well don't let that worry you<br />
because I have a great number of critics, some of them very<br />
highly paid '( Laughter) And they've never made up their minds<br />
yet! Because they change the record about every fortnight as<br />
to whether I'm a Jcreak-minded character who can never make up<br />
his mind, which is one of the stories, or whether I'm a tyrant<br />
and a bully, putting the whole Cabinet under my thumb, like a<br />
tyrant". </p>
<p>Well I can't be both, I can't be both. And, of<br />
course, as I can assure him, it's neither, He really won't be<br />
accused of being an intellectual, whatever that word means.<br />
He will be profoundly respected as a man who knows his business,<br />
has lived in a community and served it in many, many ways and<br />
has served this State in many, many ways.<br />
Now, Sir, somebody reminded me today that this is the<br />
first public speech that I will have made since I returned from<br />
New York. And perhaps I ought to say a little to you about one<br />
or two of the issues that are provoked in my mind by that fact.<br />
I want to say in the first place that I hope nobody<br />
here has any ambition, from the point of view of personal<br />
comfort, to engage in these jet flights to Khrushchev, and back<br />
again. ( Laughter) Because I can assure you they are very,<br />
very exhausting. I wont to bed immediately after dinner on Friday night<br />
and I got up for dinner on Saturday night, and got up for dinner<br />
on Sunday night and apart from that I've been in a state of<br />
coma ( Laughter) from which I have emerged, happily, in order to<br />
come on to this platform where I have spoken before and<br />
addressed this magnificent audience in Orange,<br />
Orange always has a soft spot in my affections<br />
because it has always been kind to me; whether it has agreed<br />
with me or not it has always come out and listened. And that is<br />
a good thing, for me if not for you,<br />
But, Sir, without rehearsing matters that are by now<br />
familiar to you I do want to say something about the issues, or<br />
one or two of them which arose in Now York; because they are<br />
issues which don't just concern a few diplomats sitting in a<br />
large Assembly Hall, but which concern us very very closely.<br />
Because they are the great issues of peace and war and international<br />
understanding. I had never attended a mooting of the General Assembly<br />
at the United Nations before and believe me it: s an astonishing<br />
experience. There are the representatives of 98 count'rios, r. bout<br />
15 or 16 new members this year some of them countries, the very<br />
names of which you probably have no riore hoard of than I had<br />
before they t. ere declared and admitted 98 r-.-' i-ions represented<br />
in what has sometimes been described as " the Parliament of the<br />
' Jorld". It isn't a Parliament of the World in reality; but it<br />
is a great debating forum for the world. And this year to that<br />
Assoebly there went a very high pircentage of the heads of<br />
government in the world, I confess to you I wasn't very keen<br />
on that. I think that that puts the Assembly a little out of<br />
proportion. But at any rate Khrushchev decided to , o and then<br />
began, by various means, to persuade other people to go and,<br />
in the long run, I arrived quiet] y ( Laughter) as the last and<br />
the least of all of them. And it was an astonishing performance.<br />
Khrushchev is not negligible m an, I don't need to<br />
say that to yov: he is ; hys-. cally st2ong, roug., mentally<br />
rough and shrewd. Ho has a iathe.-nine sei. se o-l ihat I hope I<br />
might be allowed to call " farm-ya.-d hvaour' ( Lai. ghter, applause)<br />
And he very socn di:; clos , d his ha:.. d.<br />
Sam refo:' ring to this rattc' because there are still<br />
people in Australia, I regret to -ho iegar'. all these </p>
<p>0 j.<br />
fulminations of his as something remote from our lives, people<br />
who haven't realisod that his men in this country, his se: vants<br />
and advocates in this country are the Australian Coraunists. A<br />
lot of people haven't quite wakened up to that fact.<br />
But he wont along to this Assembly with certain<br />
things in his mind.<br />
First of all he was going to attack the Secretary-<br />
General of the United Nations. And he made some plastering<br />
attacks on Mr. Ham. narskjold who, after all, is the Chief<br />
Executive Officer of the United Nations and ought not to be<br />
involved in answering personal attacks. But he made them. He<br />
played hard for a vote against the Secretary-General. He failed<br />
miserably to secure it. He had no support on that issue, except<br />
such support as he could get from his satellites. I wish you<br />
all could have been there to see how it works.<br />
Australia, by some grave injustico no doubt, sat in<br />
the back row. I know it very well because it's an awful long<br />
way from the back row to the rostrum. It's a real route march<br />
to go down there, to open your mouth. But if somebody wants to<br />
take a point of order he has to walk so far, from where I was<br />
sitting, that by the time he reaches the rostrum he's forgotten<br />
what the point of order was. ( Laughter) Itis quite a place<br />
this. But, over on that side sat the Soviet Union, with<br />
their battered desks in front of them. ( Laughter) Every time<br />
Khrushchev wanted to create a demonstration against some speaker,<br />
whose views didn't suit him, he would raise his fist like<br />
this, and then proceed to harmer on the desk. And the moment<br />
he raised his fists all the members of his delegation hammered,<br />
all the people from the satellite countries, like Roumania and<br />
Poland, all round, they're all looking, they took their cue and<br />
they hammered their desks.<br />
You've never seen such a complete admission, and it's<br />
a very important one, that there are satellite countries in<br />
Europe, owned and controlled, body and soul, by the Soviet<br />
Union. Mark that point. -IJ will be told as we have been<br />
told before that the Government of Poland, the Government of<br />
East Germany, the Government of Roumania, the Government of<br />
wherever it may be, Czechoslovakia, that these are ill local,<br />
independent, democratic bodies. All I can say is that when<br />
the hand went up they all applauded, they all beat on their<br />
desk. They took their orders instantly from the master of the<br />
Soviet Union. I made some point about this when, on your behalf, I<br />
spoke in that Assembly, by saying that I had never listened to<br />
such hypocritical nonsense in my life as the talk that Khrushchev<br />
had made about " colonialism" when he was, himself, the head of<br />
the greatest colonial power in the world. ( Applause)<br />
And that when, on another occasion in one of his<br />
speeches, he had said that freedo, must be given to colonial<br />
people, I said I ventured to hope that that went for Poland<br />
and Roumania and Czechoslovakia and Latvia and all these other<br />
European countries. Because if it did, it would be the<br />
greatest contribution to freedom that the world had seen since<br />
the war. But of course it doesn't mean that. They are his<br />
servants. Now that is one thing that I beg of all of you to<br />
have in mind. </p>
<p>0 Then, in the next place he began to make a pla. y for<br />
the support of the new nations. Now, if we go back five years<br />
and have a look at the nap of Africa, a vastly important country<br />
to us never forget where we are living ( here we are with<br />
Indonesia above us, Asia there and Africa there, Africa with<br />
over 200 million people) five years ago not one part of<br />
Africa, except South Africa, was completely free, independent,<br />
self-governing. And in the last five years, principally owing<br />
to the humane policies of the United Kingdom, country after<br />
country has come to its freedom. ( Applause) Ghana, Upper<br />
Volta, Nigeria. All these remarkable places are now free selfgoverning<br />
communities. And because there are now a dozen of<br />
them the Soviet leader decided that this was the time, either<br />
to cajole then, or to threaten then into supporting the<br />
Corimunist scheme. Now it's all right for us, we're only ten million<br />
people. But we have a magnificent tradition of freedom.<br />
( Applause) Je are not to be frightened, as I pointed out to<br />
him, by threats or by cajolery. We're in the tradition of<br />
freedom. Jo stand on our own feet.<br />
But countries with rather loss of that tradition,<br />
entering tentatively upon their new experiment in life their<br />
new power to rule themselves may easily be affected by<br />
threats, or by a somewhat violent form of persuasion.<br />
All I want to say to you is that I am sure that in<br />
those tactics he completely failed. Because these new nations<br />
at any rate understand this: that if they are to exercise<br />
their powers as new nations, they must exercise those powers<br />
with dignity and with self-respect. And there was neither<br />
dignity nor self-respect in the way in which the Communist case<br />
was thundered at them.<br />
And therefore I believe, and my colleague, the Attorney-<br />
General who was there also, was telling me only this<br />
morning that he was strongly of the same opinion, I believe,<br />
that Khrushchev's tactics with these people failed, that he<br />
overdid it and that in fact he left them with a rather low<br />
opinion, not only of his manners, which are, of course,<br />
deplorable, but re not so important as all that, but with a<br />
very low opinion of his -enuine respect for them.<br />
Because if I come before an audience which I respect<br />
I don't behave like a buffoon; I don't go on putting on an act<br />
and thumping things and knocking the table and pushing<br />
everything over as if I were wanting to direct attention to<br />
myself. If I did that here, you would all go home and say,<br />
" It was good fun; what a fool'.' and that, after all, Jallce,<br />
wouldn't be quite the object of the exercise. ( Laughter)<br />
And so in that respect I think that he failed.<br />
But there was one respect in which I felt disturbed<br />
about what went on. . And I want you all to think about this<br />
because this conc. rns us so intimately.<br />
Time after time, speech after speech, he and his<br />
satellites kept talking about colonialism, stirring up<br />
bitterness, bittomrness in the minds of people who, as H:: rold<br />
Macnillan pointed out, were present only because they wore no<br />
longer colonials, who wore present only because they had become<br />
free independent people.<br />
.' nd yet he went on and these other people uont on and<br />
I'll quote a phrase that I used in my own speech " in order to<br />
create in their minds a spirit of retrospective bitterness", to<br />
concentrate their minds on their disabilities of the past. and </p>
<p>by so doing to try to induce them to hate Great Britain, to<br />
hate the nations who had boon the colonial authority.<br />
And of course this is intelligible for the Communist,<br />
because the Communist has no religion of love. Ho thrives on<br />
hatred. And here were those nn, trying to blow up in the<br />
minds of these people hatred, hatred of the people who had<br />
boon, true, their colonial masters and who had helped thoe: 1 to a<br />
state of freedom and assisted then in the establishment of their<br />
own Governmient. Sir, that is a vastly dangerous state of mind;<br />
something to be discouraged, I believe, at all costs.<br />
I took whatever opportunity presented itself to me to<br />
remind some of the leaders of these Governments, some of whom<br />
are close personal friends of nine, how bad a thing this was.<br />
But you know there is a certain " mob psychology" about<br />
the Khrushchevs in the world, a certain feeling, shared by<br />
Hitler and Goebbols, that if you keep on saying it, and saying<br />
it, and saying it long enough, somebody will be affected by it,<br />
somebody will believe it.<br />
Now, Sir, I don't want to elaborate those matters, but<br />
I do just want to say this to you: that I came away from this<br />
Assembly feeling, on the whole, rather disturbed, feeling that<br />
these enormous efforts that were being put forward, not to<br />
pacify the world, but to embitter it, to increase hostilities,<br />
presented a rather grim outlook.<br />
And as I believe that the cure for nost of these<br />
things is an enlightened and sensible public opinion, I'n taking<br />
the trouble to speak to you about it. Because, for this purpose<br />
you are public opinion. We must be clear. And, above all<br />
things, we must be firm in defnce of the matters that we stand<br />
for. No~ w, Sir, there are two things that follow upon that.<br />
eo stand for a freedom of the mind that is, again, in our<br />
tradition. We are the inheritors of British liberty. And<br />
among its greatest defenders in the world! ( Applause) This is<br />
a splendid thing. And a threat, of course, is always present<br />
to the mind. But above that, or rather, beyond that in one sense,<br />
beyond that, is the constant threat to the very integrity of<br />
our country. I hope nobody supposes that by some mysterious<br />
act of divine providence we are destined always to be<br />
independent and free, ten millions of us, eleven, twelve,<br />
whatever the nunbers may be. Because that is not true.<br />
We will retain our right to live here, our right to<br />
develop industries, our right to cultivate our soil, our right<br />
to breed our flocks and herds, only so long as we have in this<br />
world not only the will to resist aggression ourselves but<br />
groat and powerful friends who will stand by us in that task.<br />
( Applause) There is a bit of a disposition in soie quarters, and<br />
in some muddled ninds, to believe that it's all right so long<br />
as we speak everybody fair; as long as we are quiet and<br />
agreeable, nobody will touch us.<br />
There is one newspaper in Sydney, you may have heard<br />
of it, I don't need to name it, which is not, you might say,<br />
entirely devoted to ie. ( Laughter) Do you follow me? It's </p>
<p>6.<br />
done its best to get rid of me for t: renty solid yea-s without<br />
success. But I didn't think the day would ever come when a<br />
newspaper that would describe itself, I suppose, as conservative<br />
perhaps, I don't know, would attack the Primn Minister of<br />
Australia because he thought it was of prime importance to<br />
retain the friendship and co-operation of Great Britain and the<br />
United States. Yet the other day, after I had made a somewhat longiinded<br />
statement, I fear, to Parliament about ny expedition,<br />
this very newspaper referred to ny activities as " currying<br />
favour" with the United States and Britain. Currying favourl<br />
According to them ry prime duty was to " curry favour" with<br />
neutral countries. I wonder what would happen, you think about itp I<br />
wonder what would happen if this country of ours becaie involved<br />
in war and I had to say I was so busy currying favour with<br />
neutral countries, who by definition couldn't cone to our help,<br />
that I forgot all about keeping our bridges up with our mother<br />
country and with the United States of ierica who are the great<br />
fighting defenders of freedom in the world. ( Applause) And<br />
our greatest friends. ( Applause)<br />
Sir, these tiings need only to be stated to explain<br />
thoeselvos. There is too much woolly thinking on those matters.<br />
I will -o through ny life, I hope, believing that I know who<br />
our friends are and that we ought to be close to then.<br />
Do you remember how all this arose? It's a tedious<br />
narrative by now, but you might like to hear it, at first hand.<br />
I arrived at this assembly and found that five nations<br />
were putting down a resolution. Who were the five? The five<br />
wore Yugoslavia ( Tito), United Arab Republic ( Nasser) Ghana<br />
( Nkrumah), Indonesia ( Soekarno), and India ( Mr. Nehru). A<br />
resolution? ! Jhat was the resolution? This is why they don't<br />
like me: they say I behaved scandalously. I should have<br />
supported it. The resolution was that President Eisnhower and Mr.<br />
Khrushchev should moot: not that the United States and the<br />
Soviet Union should oeet, but that the President of the United<br />
States, who is L1r. Eisenhower, and Hr. Khrushchev should meet,<br />
each of then having made it perfectly plain that he wasn't<br />
going to root the other. Eisenhower, because he had said<br />
categorically, " Y) u roloese these people from the aircraft,<br />
the RB47, or submit their case to proper international trial,<br />
otherwise I won't see you". Answer, " Nothing doing". And in<br />
his turn, Khrushchev saying " I won't neet Eisenhower until I<br />
have anspology for the U2". And in this state of affairs five<br />
nations, two of whom, it is true, belong to the Conronwealth,<br />
the other three of whom most certainly don't, five nations put<br />
down a resolution which was bound to be completoly futile.<br />
And in the second place they cre having an election in<br />
the United States, a Presidential election. Candidates are<br />
having television dcb:: tes and -11 sorts of other horrors.<br />
( Laughter) ' And on November 8th, three days after Wallace<br />
Meares is elected the member for C_-lare ( A. pplause) on November<br />
8th, only three days later while ! allace is looking at his<br />
dirty shoes and hoping ( Laughter) that the campaign rules still<br />
obtain, they are geing to elect a new President of the United<br />
States. Now c. uld you imagine anything sillier than to be<br />
calling on President Eisenhower t, have a personal meoting, a<br />
personal meeting, hen in a few weeks' time his successor is<br />
going to be elected. </p>
<p>0 7.<br />
But that wasn't the thalo of it. That was a minor<br />
point. It's a strong one, but it's a minor point.<br />
I took -reat exception to this resolution. I know<br />
I'n a very bad follow for having done it: I didn't intorpret<br />
Australian opinion. I'll take your opinion on it, and thoro are<br />
protty good Australians horo.(., pplauso)<br />
I said, " Look, tho tine whon the negotiations woro<br />
broken off was in Paris, uihon there wlas to be Surimit Mooting<br />
of four-powoes". And of course they are the obvious four powrs,<br />
because they are the only powers in the world with atonic<br />
woapons, they are the only powors in the world uho, jointly or<br />
severally, could hurl the ;. hiole of mankind into destruction.<br />
Those are the four great powers with atomic rosurces; they are<br />
theao people who -ought to noet.<br />
Go back to Paris, so to speak. Got on with the<br />
Sumit Mooting whliich was broken off by Khrushchev hi:. s-lf.<br />
Thorefore we -ught not to be going through the foolish<br />
exercise of telling two peoplo, who won't nmeet, that we w: Tuld<br />
like them to loading horses to the water, when ' Joek now they<br />
won't drink. lJo ouit to be realistic on this natter. Let's face<br />
up to the fact that the only hope for the wiorld is that the<br />
four great atomic powers should get to , othor and try to harior<br />
out sonthing that will reduce the burden of armarents, that<br />
will get rid, as far as possible, of nuclear weapons testing,<br />
that will, to use my own phrase there, " opon a docor into,<br />
perhaps, a more spacious chambor in the life of ireon and of<br />
womon" WTasn't this right? Tasn't this good sense? To -ove<br />
an amendment Wich said, " Go back to the Sui: iit". Don't talk<br />
about impracticable things. Let the four ruprese-ntatives, when<br />
the now President of tho United States has booeen eoctoA let thean<br />
n. ot together and lot ther. mnean business, and lot thor see<br />
whether they con't take the first stop, or two stops, or three<br />
stops to relieving the great and terrible tension that exists<br />
in the world. I proposed this, not at somobody else's request just<br />
at my own. I felt I know that I was expressing the coanuonsonso<br />
of ny own people. ( Applause)<br />
-nd the intorosting thing is that although there are<br />
all sorts of rather silly roaarks being miade by this rather<br />
silly paper about it, the fact is, first I'm not tak. ing then<br />
in order of timne the five power resolution by nidnioht, or a<br />
little aftuer, was withdrawn, so that it was not put to a vote<br />
and was not carried.<br />
And in the second place ny resolution was voted for<br />
by three out of the four atonic powers Great 3ritain, .1erica,<br />
France and not vted against by the Soviet Union. They<br />
2bstained. . nd whon, a few days later I had so; ething well over<br />
an hour's privat discussih with ir. Khrushchev himsolf, he<br />
mode it quite cle" ar that he was in fav) ur of a Summn. it<br />
Conforence. ( Applauso)<br />
It soons to ne to be rather od when we reemober that<br />
, ustralians are lpractical people there m1ay be somo who don't<br />
understand thon yet, but practical people we ore in ustralia </p>
<p>0<br />
and it soos a little odd that because the Prime Minister of<br />
.' ustralia puts up a practical proposal, a proposal which I<br />
venture t3 prophesy will find itself supported by the actual<br />
fact of a Summ; rit Mooting before we're a, yoer older, it sccs<br />
quite surprising to mo that that should be a subject for attack.<br />
But there is another aspect of this Y. atter that I want<br />
to say somthing to you about.<br />
This resolution said " twu people". I'll just use<br />
then by nario Eisenhowe:, Khrushchov. W1hat about Hacnillan,<br />
and Do Gaulle? ' Jhy should they be out of this picture? Don't<br />
they count? Has Groat Britain suddenly become neutral? It's<br />
just as well for us that she hasn't. Has France suddenly<br />
becone neutral? Just as well for us that she hasn't, Why<br />
should they be out -f this?<br />
fnd m. y answer t it is this, and I put it quite<br />
plainly; There is too much of this niserable propa-anda toing<br />
on, and it g-os on through the Corimunist journals and Conmunist<br />
agitators in our own country that the one great issue in the<br />
world is between ciAmerican capitalisn and Comnunism, as<br />
represented by the Soviet Union. And that ail the rest of us<br />
are innocent bystanders with no intorjst, except to see how<br />
these two big peopl .; ot on with each other.<br />
L.. dies and gentlcon, if that wore the truth, and I<br />
denounce it as a -o. nstrous falsohood, but if that were the<br />
truth, then presumably Great Britain, Canada, France, Jestern<br />
Germany, Italy, theo 3nolux powers, ustralia, New Zealand, w. o<br />
could all * o neutral, because we don't c unt, we don't c unt.<br />
The argument is betwioon Aorica and the Soviet Union. I be:<br />
of youl beware of false prophets; beware of that kind of<br />
propagIanda. There are no people in the world who have a<br />
reazter vested interest in free denocracy and a greator vested<br />
opposition in us to Connunism, than the people of Australia.<br />
( Applause) Now, Sir, perhaps I've said enough about those<br />
uatters, bocause I'vo boon told, unsuccessfully for a long tine<br />
now, that we'ro not vtry interested in foreign affairs in<br />
1ustralia Hell I've never believed it. And I believe it loss<br />
every year that , oos by. Because no country has booeen mnore<br />
affected by foreign .: ffairs than we have. (. pplause) And no<br />
c.) untry has, man for man, population for population, a better<br />
right to have a view and oxpress a view in the councils of the<br />
world in order to solve, or help to solve, the problo: Is of<br />
peace and And therofore, I have booeen talking to you about<br />
something that is every bit as important to the resident of<br />
Orange or of this area, as it is to any other frooee independent<br />
peison in the whole of the Coraonw; alth or, for that matter,<br />
in the whole of the world.<br />
Sir, it's a satisfaction to o to know two things.<br />
One is that I believe that our ties with Great Britain and the<br />
Comonwealth countries and our ties with the United States of<br />
oerica were never strongor than thi-y are now. ( Applause)<br />
In the case of the United tatos they are immeasurably stronger<br />
than they were when mny Govcrnm. ont came into office at the end<br />
of 1949 ( Applauso) . nd all I nooeed to say to you is that, along the lines<br />
that I have boon discussing with y u, you nmay rely on us to<br />
stand firmn in our loyalties, in our friendships, and in our<br />
detestation of everything that Communism stands for.<br />
NoJJ, Sir, before I finish perhaps I ought to say a </p>
<p>0 9.<br />
word or two about the local scene. I haven't yet had a chance<br />
of discovo: cing what all the orgu: zont is about on the local<br />
scene they tell me it's quite a quiet election. 3ut there is<br />
one thing I want to say to you about it.<br />
14e have a Liberal candidate. Here he is. ( Applause)<br />
There is no need to tell you he is m.-y nan. I would be griovously<br />
disturbed if he didn't become the ner. mber for Calare.<br />
But, Sir, there is also a Country Party crndidato.<br />
-nd every time you have a candidate from each of the two parties<br />
naking up the Goviern: nt, there is a toe: mptation for supporters<br />
of one candidate or another to be raising issues of discord.<br />
Now I i ant to say to you, I hope you won't fall into that. I<br />
hope everybody will roalise that, just as I want nothing half so<br />
much as to see you put No. 1 against 1. llaco Mearos' namen so I<br />
want to see you put No. 2 against the Country Party candidato's<br />
namc. And if you're Country Party supporters, then I want to<br />
see that your second preference doesn't -o astray, but that it<br />
goes to the Liberal candidate.<br />
Y : u will get all sorts of people who make all sorts of<br />
funny little clail-ms and funny little arsgunnts. I've presided<br />
over the longest Governnent, in point of tiro, that has ever<br />
existed in Australia. 1And fron the first day until the last it<br />
has been composed of Liberal Ministers , and Country Party<br />
iMinisters. iMost of then arc Liberal mrinisters because of the<br />
balance of nu. mbers in the House. But for eleven years we have<br />
worked togethor, thought togethor. I have the iost profound<br />
respect f,, r m!: y Country Party colloagices.<br />
My Deputy Prino Ministe , Mr. McEwen, I think, Sir,<br />
one of the reat non of this c. untry. ( Aipplause) But if he<br />
wro here with me he would say at onco, with me I've hoard<br />
him say it elsewhere that in the whole tine that we have sat<br />
together, eleven years, there has never been a matter decided<br />
in the Cabinet on Party lines, never once.<br />
oe exchange our views. People make proposals; they<br />
are thrashed out. ' To end up by etting the com-z: on sense of the<br />
-Cabinet. Anybody who wants to make nischief between the Liberal<br />
Party candidate and the Country Party candidate or between the<br />
Liberal Party and the Country Party in this by-election is<br />
opposed, primnarily, to the Governinont. Because a coQ posito<br />
Govorment lives on hariony, and falls to pieces with discord.<br />
Jo've had eleven years of supreme harrmony and I boj of all of<br />
you: don't have that disturbed. Nobody can secure any<br />
benefit from discords other than those who want to bring the<br />
Gove rn~:-ent down.<br />
You've got candidates here and, as I've said, in the<br />
case of Mr. Meares, I find it hard to believe that you could<br />
find a man miore qualified to express the practical view of the<br />
. an on the land, and indeed, when he comes to Parlianent in<br />
Canberra, he will find himself sitting, in 1. y o~ m Party7 in<br />
company with soenothing : ver 20 people who represont similar<br />
constituencies. And so at this by-oelction, No. 1, give us the benefit<br />
of your backing. I d' n't know -hat the Labour Party has been<br />
saying about these thin s that have happened overseas. I know<br />
that poor Mr. Calwoll is now eobarrassed by riches. He's ) ot a<br />
daily colunn in a newspapor, and a weekly broadcast soncwhere<br />
else, and a Moot the Press here, or there. He never stops,<br />
except to take his foot out of his mouth. ( Laughter, applause) </p>
<p>I dn't know , rhat his views are, or w'hat the views of<br />
his party nay be. But I have done my best to tall you ' rht ur<br />
views are, 2. nd fhat wer stand for, -" nd I'll be tho -ost<br />
surprised rman in i1ustralia if yu.) u do) n't give us your<br />
enthusiastic support. ( Applause)<br />
Interview at Bathurst .4. irport after 14CetinF<br />
Intorvicwor-Mr. K. McIntosh:<br />
Now,. 1 Sir, w _ uld you like to tell our listeners your<br />

Prime iiiniste: Jell this is nit the first tie th t I h-ve<br />

i.ñ etings here in m-y tine. But tonight is the ratrst r.: ting<br />
I'vO ever had therc, . ost enthusiast! ic. I was deigted With<br />
it, I thought that iHr. 11oaros -ad a-2v ery, very good<br />
ipression on a. large Oran -o audience, and T ca; o away froi:, the<br />
mocting fueling e xtremely confidant about the result of the<br />
electio) n. Bcauso, after all, Orange is very, very<br />
imprtnt centre, a-nd thei votes there are a very co'nsiderable<br />
factor in the Clere loctrate. I thought theo whole at:-: isph , io<br />
of the neting couldn't ha-ve be--n better.<br />
It seemed from~ i the speech that y) u made, Sir, which we<br />
had on the air at 9 o'clock incidentally, before you finished<br />
speakin, that you were very il.-pressed with the 1-roa as a, wliole<br />
and you d1" id make the c; i. e. onts ab. out ha: ving beon in Orange be3fore.<br />
wioe c quite iYn-ip s.; se,) 1d w.-ith the speoch tliat yo) u " id mae; the<br />
hockling was non-xistent.<br />
PrieMinister: That's right, non-existent. It's the only tineo<br />
in my life when I haven't m.-inded the absence ' of interjectors<br />
bccauso the audienco w. as quick, it was ale-rt, it tok every<br />

very ood. is, f curs, very propr because I've<br />
never seen the-i c juntry looking be,, tter. Ad if thi'o country were<br />
lookin., bad no doubt the GovrmE. nt . r. w) uld be blameo d for it.<br />
