    <content><![CDATA[<p>Today I wish to announce the unanimous support of the Canberra National</p>
<p> Memorials Committee for the design of the Australian Service Nurses</p>
<p> National Memorial, which is to be built on Anzac Parade in the National</p>
<p> Capital.</p>
<p>The Memorial will serve to honour the sacrifice and service of Australian</p>
<p> Service nurses who died, and to honour those who served and suffered</p>
<p> in caring for casualties, in war and other operations. Service nurses</p>
<p> have played a vital role in every theatre of war. More recently we</p>
<p> have all been touched by their selfless dedication, compassion and</p>
<p> professionalism in treating survivors of the Papua New Guinea tsunami.</p>
<p> They were there to comfort, to care and to heal. It is timely that</p>
<p> Australia commemorates their sacrifice and service.</p>
<p>The Federal Government has committed $100,000 towards the construction</p>
<p> of the Memorial. The Memorial's fund-raising committee launched</p>
<p> a national fund-raising appeal on 15 August 1998. I commend this cause</p>
<p> to the generosity of the Australian people.</p>
<p>The design by Robin Moorhouse, a Sydney-based sculptor, was chosen</p>
<p> following a two-stage national design competition. Ms Moorhouse worked</p>
<p> with a design team comprising Warren Langley, Brian Wilson, Jenny</p>
<p> Toynbee Wilson, Felicity Carruthers and Michael Biddulph. The National</p>
<p> Capital Authority conducted the design competition. The design for</p>
<p> the Memorial is horizontal in form and features a pair of curvilinear,</p>
<p> low sculpted glass walls that will be raised slightly on an elliptically</p>
<p> shaped platform. The surfaces of the glass walls will portray important</p>
<p> images and events drawn from the history of Australian Service nursing.</p>
<p>The Memorial is scheduled for completion in October 1999, which marks</p>
<p> the centenary of the establishment of military nursing in Australia.</p>
