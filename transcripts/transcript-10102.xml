    <content><![CDATA[<p>Australia warmly welcomes the adoption of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty ( CTBT) by the United Nations General Assembly.</p>
<p>The CTBT is a milestone in international efforts to address the threat to global security posed by the proliferation of nuclear weapons. It is a vital step towards the goal of the ultimate elimination of nuclear weapons, as agreed by the international community in the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT). The CTBT would ban nuclear weapon tests for all time and act as a major impediment to the development of new generations of nticlear weapons.</p>
<p>I urge all nations to join Australia in signing and ratifying the CTBT so that it can be implemented as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Australians can be pleased with the part we have played in achieving this outcome. Australia has been an active participant in negotiations on the treaty from the beginning. I would like to acknowledge the important role of the previous government in advancing the cause of a treaty.</p>
<p>Subsequently, my government has played a substantial role in bringing negotiations on the treaty to a successful conclusion.</p>
<p>The Minster for Foreign Affairs, the Hon Alexander Downer MP, has played a leading role in bringing the treaty to the UN General Assembly for its successful adoption. He will sign the treaty on behalf of Australia later this  month in New York.</p>
