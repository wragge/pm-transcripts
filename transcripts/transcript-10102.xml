    <content><![CDATA[<p>Australia warmly welcomes the adoption of the Comprehensive Test BanÂ Treaty ( CTBT) by the United Nations General Assembly.</p>
<p>The CTBT is a milestone in international efforts to address the threat to globalÂ security posed by the proliferation of nuclear weapons. It is a vital stepÂ towards the goal of the ultimate elimination of nuclear weapons, as agreed byÂ the international community in the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT).Â The CTBT would ban nuclear weapon tests for all time and act as a majorÂ impediment to the development of new generations of nticlear weapons.</p>
<p>I urge all nations to join Australia in signing and ratifying the CTBT so that itÂ can be implemented as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Australians can be pleased with the part we have played in achieving thisÂ outcome. Australia has been an active participant in negotiations on the treaty from theÂ beginning. I would like to acknowledge the important role of the previousÂ government in advancing the cause of a treaty.</p>
<p>Subsequently, my government has played a substantial role in bringingÂ negotiations on the treaty to a successful conclusion.</p>
<p>The Minster for Foreign Affairs, the Hon Alexander Downer MP, has played aÂ leading role in bringing the treaty to the UN General Assembly for itsÂ successful adoption. He will sign the treaty on behalf of Australia later this Â month in New York.</p>
