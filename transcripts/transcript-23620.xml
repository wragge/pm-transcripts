    <content><![CDATA[<p>The coming week is an important one for Australia â it's a week that will boost jobs and help families.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will visit our country. During his visit, we will sign the historic Economic Partnership Agreement with Japan.</p>
<p>Japan is Australiaâs second biggest trading partner â with almost $70 billion in two-way trade every year.</p>
<p>Australia is a trading nation â and more trade means more jobs.</p>
<p>This agreement is important for our farming sector â with better access to Japan for our beef, cheese, horticulture and wine.</p>
<p>And consumers will benefit from less expensive household appliances and electronics.</p>
<p>As well, this week the Governmentâs legislation to scrap the carbon tax is expected to be voted on in the Senate.</p>
<p>You have already voted to scrap the carbon tax â and now itâs up to the Senate to do the same.</p>
<p>The Coalition has fought hard to scrap this toxic tax â we know it hurts jobs, it hurts families and it does nothing at all for the environment.</p>
<p>We're voting to scrap it because that is the best way to take pressure off families as well as help the economy. Scraping the carbon tax will save families, on average, $550 a year.</p>
<p>Every single one of the Coalitionâs Senators will vote to scrap the carbon tax â but every single Labor Senator will vote to keep it.</p>
<p>Lowering the tax burden and opening up Australia to more trade are part of the Governmentâs Economic Action Strategy to build a strong, prosperous economy for a safe and secure Australia.</p>
