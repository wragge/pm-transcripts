STATEMENT BY THE PRIME M~ INISTER<br />
Tn-' E RT. HON. HAROLD HOLT, M. P.,<br />
IN THE HOTDE OF REPRESENTATIVES 17<br />
2ND NOVE1] ER, 1967 3ot96<br />
OFFICE OF ABORIGINAL AFFAIRS<br />
Honourable Members will recall that in a Statement to this<br />
House on 7th September this year I announced certain dccisions<br />
the Commonwealth Government had taken on Aboriginals following<br />
the referendum in May and later discussions with the States. I<br />
referred to the changes to the Constitution brought about by the<br />
referendum and to the Government's view that the prime function<br />
of the Commonwealth in Aboriginal affairs in the future should be<br />
to have a policy co-ordinating role in matters of common interest<br />
to the Cornmonwszalth, its Territories and the Australian States.<br />
I also announced that the machinery to perform this function<br />
would be provided by an Office of Aboriginal Affairs to be<br />
established within the Prime Minister's Department. This<br />
arrangement was designed to bring it under my own Central<br />
Administration. By this means, we would have an effective channel of<br />
communication not only between the States and the Commonwealth<br />
on Aboriginal matters through the Premiers and mysellf, but<br />
between the Commonwealth Government, the Aboriginals themselves<br />
and organisations represunting them.<br />
I now wish to announce a further stage in the Government's<br />
proposals in this matter. The Government wishes to have<br />
continually available to it the best advice on Aboriginal<br />
affairs it can get on a national level, and it has therefore<br />
decided that the new office should serve a Council for<br />
Aboriginal Affairs, which will have two particular functions:-<br />
It will advise the Government in the formulation<br />
of national policies for the Aboriginal citizens<br />
of Australia.<br />
It w . ill consult with Commonwealth Dcpartments and<br />
authorities whose activities have a bearing on<br />
Aboriginal welfare.<br />
It will also act as the Commonwealth agency for ensuring<br />
co-operation between Commonwealth and State authorities at the<br />
official level. It will, like the office, be within my<br />
jurisdiction as Prime Minister and associated with the Prime<br />
Minister's Department in Canberra.<br />
The new Council will consist of a Chairman and two<br />
members. The Chairman will not be a full-time appointmnent but,<br />
at least during the early years of the Council's work, he will<br />
devote a large proportion of his time to its affairs. One of<br />
the other members will be the executive member who will be the<br />
director of the office serving the Council. The third member<br />
will be chosen for his direct knojvledge and understandin? 7 of the<br />
Aboriginal people.<br />
The Council will draw upon the knowledge and experience<br />
of anthropologists and other academic specialists as well as<br />
State and Commonw~ alth officials working in the field. It will<br />
also call into counsel members of Aboriginal communities and<br />
others concerned with their welfare and advancement. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
The Council will concontrate at the outset on fully<br />
establishing the new office of Aboriginal Affairs and, in<br />
consultation with other Departments and with the States, but<br />
also will move as soon as possible to the formulation of<br />
proposals for~ bnaonwealth policies in relation to aboriginals.<br />
I repeat here, however, what I said in September that<br />
while the Commonwealth Parliament is now in a position to make<br />
special laws, the Commornealth does not seek to intrude<br />
unnecessarily in this field or into areas of activity currently<br />
being dealt with by the States. We believe that detailed<br />
administration to be most effective should be on a State or<br />
regional basis<br />
I would ada that since I made my first announcement in<br />
September of the Government's intentions as a consequence of the<br />
Referendum result, we have had many constructive suggestions and<br />
much useful advice from representative people. This has bceen of<br />
considerable value to the Government and has helped us materially<br />
in this further development of our policy.<br />
I am confident both the Council for Aboriginal Affairs<br />
and the new office will provide a powerful reinforcement for the<br />
continuing efforts that the Commonwealth Government, the<br />
Australian States and the Northern Territory are making for the<br />
advancement of Australian aboririnals.<br />
I now come to the question of the person to be appointed<br />
as the first Chairman of the new Council for Aboriginal Affairs.<br />
This is an im~ portant appointment to which, naturally, the Government<br />
has given a great deal of thought so that a person of strong quality<br />
and competence and also with a feeling for the task would be chosen.<br />
I am now able to re-port that following a series of discussions<br />
with Dr. ' 1HC.. Coombs about his future, Dr. Coombs will be taking<br />
up the position of Chairman.<br />
Dr. Coombs some time ago indicated to the Treasurar and to<br />
me that, after 18 years as Governor of the Reserve Bank, he felt<br />
the stage was apiproaching at which he ought to step down. He also<br />
indicated that thereafter, if the Government wished, he would be<br />
prepared tD assume other appropriate responsibilities. While the<br />
Government would be well-content for Dr, Coombs to continue as<br />
Governor of the Bank, it felt that it should respect his judgment<br />
in this matter.<br />
In the light of this, discussion took place with Dr. Coombs<br />
concerning the application of his abilities and experience to the<br />
field of Aboriginal affairs, and I am happy to report that we found<br />
him responsive and enthusiastic in this direction hence the<br />
appointment which I have just announced.<br />
I may add that it has also been decided that Dr. Coombs<br />
should be appointed Chairman of the Council for the Arts, about<br />
which I made an announcement yesterday. This is a field of<br />
activity in which he has already done very valuable work.<br />
Dr. Coombs has accepted certain commitments as Governor of<br />
the Bank during the first part of 1968 and he will not formally<br />
retire from that post until these have been fulfilled. He will,<br />
nevertheless, be starting immediately on his new tasks and<br />
effective arrangements will be made to relieve him of certain of<br />
his responsibilities in the Bank for this purpose. Perhaps I<br />
should state that Dr. Coombs has stipulated that while he<br />
remains Governor, there should be no additional remuneration in<br />
respect of his Aboriginal Affairs and Council for the Arts posts. </p>
<p>p -3-<br />
At this point, I desire, personally and on behalf of the<br />
Government, to pay to Dr. Coomnbs the highest tribute for his<br />
distinguished service to Australia as Governor of the Bank and<br />
also in other major fields of national endeavour.<br />
I now come to arrangements in relation to the Reserve<br />
Bank in view of the impending retirement of Dr. Coombs. I am<br />
authorised by my colleague, the Treasurer, to say that<br />
Mr. J. G. Phillips, the present Deputy Governor, will be. appointed<br />
to sucecad Dr. Coombs. Knowing th,, e admirable work that Mr. Phillips<br />
has done over many years as an economist and central banker,<br />
the Government has great confidence in his ability to carry out<br />
the responsibilities of Governor of the Reserve Bank and Chairman<br />
of the Reserve Bank Board. </p>
