    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Government condemns the atrocity in Paris overnight.</p>
<p>The thoughts of all Australians are with the families of those who have lost their lives in this barbaric act.</p>
<p>Freedom of expression is the cornerstone of a free society.</p>
<p>The Government will continue to do all it can to protect our community from terrorism.</p>
<p>Our National Terrorism Alert level remains at High, which means a terrorist attack is likely.</p>
<p>Our security agencies are assessing the situation for security implications to Australia but there is no information to suggest that there is an imminent threat to Australia as a result of the Paris atrocity.</p>
<p>All Australians should remain vigilant, and again, I urge people who see or hear something that they feel is not right, to contact the National Security Hotline immediately on 1800 123 400.</p>
<p>Australia stands with the people and the government of France at this difficult time.</p>
<p>8 January 2015</p>
