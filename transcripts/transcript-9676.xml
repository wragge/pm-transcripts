TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH JOHN LAWS, RADIO 2UE, 26 JULY 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
JL: Good morning Prime Minister.<br />
PM; How are you, John?<br />
JL: Pretty good, how about you?<br />
PM: Going well, thanks?<br />
JL: Have a good break?<br />
PM; Not too bad at all.<br />
JL: Did you pick the right State? It was a pretty hectic time to be in<br />
Queensland with Wayne Goss with his worries.<br />
PM; I picked the right weather, I can tell you that, and that is what really<br />
matters.<br />
JL: And the right area too from what I hear.<br />
PM: That is right.<br />
JL: Listen, it is interesting when you look at the situation there in<br />
Queensland, Now, had ten constituents in the Townsville seat voted<br />
for the Opposition and not Labor, Wayne Goss wouldn't be<br />
Queensland Premier today. It was pretty cfose, wasn't it?<br />
PM: Yes, it was and I think, as Wayne said overnight, I mean this is part of<br />
the problem of incumbency these days. So much is expected of<br />
governments and they can, in a sense, do so much. But it is then a<br />
matter of trying to adequately articulate what has been done.<br />
JL: Yes. Looking at some of the questions what we have decided to do<br />
here today is, you would be aware that on occasions in the past when </p>
<p>TEL : 26uI. 5 13 .04P0iC<br />
2<br />
1 interview you though, are those people out there who say well you<br />
just give him an easy ride, you don't ask him the tough questions.<br />
PM. Well that is only the Tories.<br />
JL: That is right.<br />
P M; When you give Howard an easy ride, the Labor people don't say that.<br />
JL: Yes, but nobody rings up to tell me I have done that.<br />
PM: I know because a lot of the audience supports the Coalition.<br />
J L Well I suppose that is the way of the country too, at the moment, if you<br />
take any notice of the polls. But in order that it could be considered to<br />
be all fair, so their friends can ring them up and tell them how easy<br />
they were on you, I thought we'd<br />
PM: But you have never been easy on me, that is the point.<br />
JL: Well, no, I don't think I have been particularly easy on you.<br />
PM: Well sometimes 1 get off air saying things under my breath about you.<br />
JL: Sometimes you have said it and not even under your breath. I have<br />
had to pick up the phone.<br />
PM: That is right.<br />
JL: Anyway we will do it this way and just see how it looks. Questions,<br />
obviously, will be put to you that may well be outside your realm.<br />
But if you can go close to the answer we would appreciate this.<br />
This one comes from Robert Woods, obviously somewhere in Sydney,<br />
" I wish to ask the Prime Minister why he persists with comparatively<br />
unimportant issues, such as the republic, and side steps or avoids the<br />
most pressing issues of the current account deficit, the balance of<br />
payments and Australia's poor performance in controlling its<br />
indebtedness? What is the Government doing to address these<br />
issues?"<br />
PM: Well it is doing the major things. The current account deficit is a major<br />
issue for which we have put in a major change. And, that change is a<br />
Budget surplus and a superannuation scheme, the likes of which the<br />
nation has never seen. That is, that everybody will be putting away,<br />
within seven years from now, 15 per cent and we are already at 6 per<br />
cent, heading for 9 per cent, but will then be 15 per cent of their<br />
Incomes which will add to $ 2 trillion in savings, that is $ 2,000 billion.<br />
Now the national debt is about $ 160 billion. We are talking about<br />
$ 2,000 billion and when you look at the Budget deficit change, that is a<br />
change of about 4 per cent of GDP, that is about $ 20 billion. In other<br />

<p>TEL: 26&amp;. Jul S 1 : 33 N o C' 4 R 0 3/<br />
3<br />
words, the two changes, John, that matter for savings are the Budget<br />
deficit and super. But, look, the real point is this, our friends in the<br />
Liberal Party run around saying " Oh, look at the debt and you know<br />
the current account deficit". But the fact is this is a big island<br />
continent. This is a country which is always going to need capital. It is<br />
a bit like people saying " Oh well look at that fellow up the road, he has<br />
Just bought a house for $ 200,000. you know, and he is finished. He is<br />
massively in debt." What he is doing is borrowing to make himself<br />
stronger in the future and to provide a benefit for himself, a roof over<br />
his head and an asset.<br />
JL: Okay.<br />
PM: That is exactly what Australia is doing.<br />
JL: Okay, except that when the fellow up the road buys the $ 200,000<br />
house, he does pay it off and the amount that he owes does reduce.<br />
Our's doesn't reduce, it keeps climbing.<br />
PM: Oh, yes it does and remember this, our capacity..<br />
JL: Well why do we have increases?<br />
PM: Let me just make this point. Our capacity to pay it off has doubled.<br />
Eight or nine years ago, only about 22 per cent of our exports<br />
22 per cent of the proceeds of our exports were spent servicing our<br />
international debt. Today, that is 11 per cent. In other words, we are<br />
like somebody who has got roughly the same mortgage, but has a<br />
doubling of income. It is all about your capacity to service it.<br />
JL: But why do we see it constantly increasing?<br />
PM:-Because there is more Investment in Australia coming through<br />
because more Australian companies want to invest more in this<br />
country. That is where the jobs came from. See, John, this questioner<br />
says I don't concentrate on the big issues, on things like the republic,<br />
I mean the republic actually is a big issue. But I will leave that to one<br />
side.<br />
JL: Apart from that, I think everybody has got to be aware that<br />
governments have got to be able to, and are capable of, doing more<br />
than one thing at a time.<br />
PM: Exactly, exactly. But what was the big commitment that I made at the<br />
election? What was the issue of the 1993 election? Employment.<br />
The right to a job. And even though, perhaps, it is now I mean we<br />
had these dreadful headlines last week. We had 50,000 job growth<br />
and the headline in one newspaper national newspaper was<br />
" Jobs surge dashes hopes for rate cut". In other words, isn't it terrible<br />
we have got all these jobs, it is bad for rate cuts. And then the next </p>
<p>TEL: 26 . Ju I .95 1 : 33 No.<br />
4<br />
one, another one said, " Dollar surges as jobless rate falls to<br />
pre-recession level". John, what in the biggest commitment that the<br />
Government has made and I made at the 1993 election was to restore<br />
employment to Australia. We have had, since the election, 630,000<br />
jobs. Now let me just put that in some sort of context. When I became<br />
the Treasurer a decade ago, we had 6 million in the workforce. It took<br />
us 200 years to get to 6 million. It has taken us 2 1/ 2 years to put<br />
per cent more on that 600,000. 1 mean it is the most phenomenal<br />
level of employment growth. But you see any opponent I have, and<br />
the questioner you can bet is not a Labor voter, will say, " Well look<br />
2 1/ 2 years ago employment was all the go, but now we don't want to<br />
hear about it. The next test for you is the current account deficit."<br />
JL: Okay, just back to this employment, the jobs that have been created.<br />
Are they jobs that have been created on credit, from money borrowed<br />
overseas?<br />
PM: No, I mean they are jobs created by investment and the pick up in<br />
demand in Australia. You see, John, you have got to understand this.<br />
This is not Singapore, this is not a city State, this is not Hong Kong.<br />
This is a country, this is an island continent. It has got long railway<br />
systems, it has got power, it has got water, it has got ports, it has got<br />
all sorts of things.<br />
JL: Why do you mention Singapore? Do many people mention<br />
Singapore?<br />
PM: 1 I mention it because some countries run surpluses because they don't<br />
have the need for that continuing demand for investment.<br />
For instance, I mean you have just seen BHP announce a new iron<br />
plant for Western Australi Another company announced the same.<br />
That wouldn't happen in a country that doesn't have iron ore reserves.<br />
Now what do we say, that we are better off with that billion and a half<br />
investment, or we are not better off with it?<br />
JL: But how does that billion and a half investment affect the people<br />
listening to this radio program?<br />
P M; It lifts their employment and it lifts their real wealth.<br />
J L: And does it lift their debt?<br />
PM: Well it may do, it may do but it really just depends. I mean it depends<br />
whether we can add to our national savings. In other words, what I am<br />
trying to say is we have a level of domestic investment, bigger than our<br />
national savings, do you understand? In other words, we have got a<br />
country which is now investing strongly and though it is bigger than our<br />
national savings. Just as you have somebody who buys their home<br />
down the road for $ 250,000, which is bigger than their personal 0 ) 4 P 0 4 -C </p>

savings. But are they massiVely in debt and are they ruined?<br />
Of course not, they are just building an asset.<br />
JL: That is right.<br />
PM: And we are building an asset.<br />
JL: Yes, but we would be better if we built it with our own money, instead<br />
of borrowing it from overseas and we don't have enough of our own<br />
money because your Government doesn't encourage saving.<br />
PM: Oh, well that is completely wrong.<br />
JL: It is not.<br />
PM: It is completely wrong.<br />
JL: It is not. You tax people on savings.<br />
PM: Oh come on, John, come on. But, listen, there are two sorts of<br />
savings. There are public savings.<br />
JL: But you do tax people on savings.<br />
PM: Well, of course, we tax people. We tax people on income, mate.<br />
JL: Well why is it..<br />
PM: Hang on.<br />
JL: H-ang on, well why is it wrong?<br />
PM: Well, okay, let me tell you. You said, you know, we discourage<br />
savings. Look, the biggest saver is the public sector if it wishes to be.<br />
By pushing the Budget into surplus, we have pushed up the big<br />
generator of savings, that is the public savings. So we are talking<br />
about a national savings pot. So we are talk* ing about public savings.<br />
Then we are talking about superannuation. Do you think my dull<br />
opponents could ever get the workforce to put 15 per cent of their<br />
income away as savings and give them a retirement income equal to<br />
the one they retire on at average weekly earnings?<br />
JL. But when will all this come to fruition and another question from, I have<br />
got to give credit to the questioners, B and J Rathborne of<br />
North Sydney ' will the foreign debt drop permanently, permanently<br />
underlined, this financial year?"<br />
PM. What was your first question, sorry?<br />
JL: Will the foreiyri debt. I I Z i 4 o 0 0 4 P ID 5. 1, </p>
<p>TEL . JI. 5 13 No. 0<br />
6<br />
PM: No, no, but you asked me something before that. Sorry, I was<br />
concentrating on that. But, look, understand this point, John.<br />
Superannuation is already at 6 per cent. On 1 July..<br />
JL: The question was when will we see this come to fruition.<br />
PM: Yes, that is right, that is what you said. On I July it was at 6 per cent<br />
and then it goes up by I percentage point over the next three years, to<br />
which the Government is then paying 3 per cent by way of the tax cuts<br />
into superannuation accounts and then employees are paying<br />
3 per cent themselves. So it is 9 per cent, plus 3 per cent, plus<br />
3 per cent that is 15 per cent. That 15 per cent will give us, by the<br />
turn of this century, $ 1 trillion in savings and by 2020 $ 2 trillion.<br />
Now, John, that is a level of savings, private savings, this country has<br />
never seen, has never seen. And not only are we doing it, if someone<br />
retires on average weekly earnings, which is now about $ 33,000,<br />
in other words their working income at the week they retired was<br />
$ 33,000, they will actually have a retirement income of about $ 33,000.<br />
In other words, we are giving people, through our superannuation<br />
changes ours an income In retirement comparable to the one they<br />
have been on at work and we have built up a pile of national savings.<br />
What does John Howard want to do to that, put the slipper into it. He<br />
said he wants to abolish award superannuation, he wants to go back to<br />
tax concessions.<br />
JL: Okay, well now let me just get to this other question because I have to,<br />
I owe it to the listeners. Will the foreign debt drop permanently this<br />
year?<br />
P M. No. No, but the thing is it depends whether you are talking about<br />
absolutes, or our capacity to pay it. The fact of the matter is what was<br />
required of the Government was two things. Look, in 1993 people said<br />
get the economy restarted. We got the economy restarted. We have<br />
had strong rates of growth since that time.<br />
JL: Okay, but..<br />
PM. The main requirement was employment. We got the employment there<br />
and that comes only from investment. We got the strong investment<br />
there and the other requirement was to put a medium term fix into the<br />
savings problem, which we have done with a Budget surplus and long<br />
term superannuation. I mean that is the answer.<br />
JL: We won't be seeing the effect of it in this year, or next year?<br />
PM: Well, of course, we won't be seeing the effect this year because we<br />
have still got a flood of investment. But see, John, look, you get all<br />
these sort of Jeremiahs. Let me just take the last week.<br />

JL: Okay, listen I have got to hurry you up a little bit because we have got<br />
a bundle of people who want to talk to you, a very popular man.<br />
PM: Alright, but let me just take the last week. On Saturday I launched a<br />
ship with Jim Bolger, the New Zealand Prime Minister.<br />
JL: His dollar is good.<br />
PM:-That is a world ranking, state-of-the-art frigate, an Anzac class frigate.<br />
On the previous day, Rupert Murdoch announced the establishment of<br />
the Fox studios, the Fox movie company 20th Century Fox, the largest<br />
set of studios in the world, outside of Hollywood. Earlier that week, the<br />
Ford Motor Company announced a $ 1 billion investment in a new<br />
Ford Falcon and a new paint facility. Two weeks before that,<br />
American Express announced that Australia would be the<br />
headquarters of its whole East Asian operation. The same week we<br />
had 50,000 jobs and the stock market hit its high for a year. I mean<br />
what are people going on about?<br />
JI: I don't know, but they are.<br />
PM: Well, maybe they are going on about it because they hear all the time<br />
this sort of morbid Tory stuff about we are all ruined and the fact is..<br />
JL: We are not.<br />
PM: the economy is at a sustainable rate, we have got low inflation, we<br />
have just had an Accord which is going to run wages to produce a 2 to<br />
3 per cent inflation rate, you have got huge endorsements by major<br />
American and international corporations.<br />
JI: And we tell people about it all the time. But it doesn't alter the fact that<br />
they still want to have these sorts of questions answered. Let me just<br />
take<br />
PM: I am happy to answer the questions, as long as people understand<br />
when I focus on them, this is not the whole scene. The whole scene,<br />
the scene we have at the moment, of sustainable growth and low<br />
inflation is probably as good as we have had in 20 years.<br />
JL: Okay, we will take a caller. Hello.<br />
C: Hello.<br />
JL: Yes, you want to talk to the Prime Minister?<br />
C: I certainly do.<br />
JL: Here he is. 6 3u I 951: 33 N0.004 </p>
<p>TEL: 2 i6.3 uI. 51 j1: 3 No C04 F. C/ C<br />
C; Hello Mr Keating.<br />
PM: How are you doing?<br />
C: I am doing well it is a great privilege to be able to speak to you.<br />
PM: Well you sound nice.<br />
C: Mr Keating, first of all I would like to say that I have a great admiration<br />
for your political skills. I think you are a mastermind political strategist<br />
and certainly without..<br />
JL: Hey listen, you had better lay off this, or it will sound like some people<br />
will be ringing up and saying it is a set up. Come on, get on with the<br />
question. If you have got a question to ask, ask the question.<br />
C: I am trying to be nice before I stick the knife in. Mr Keating my<br />
question is I am an average man with a wife, paying off a mortgage,<br />
and I am becoming quite disillusioned with the state of the economy in<br />
our country in that you have been in power now, your Party has been<br />
in power, since 1983 and I am wondering whether we have seen<br />
another decade of lost opportunities? I have spent a lot of time doing<br />
business with people in countries like Singapore where they have next<br />
to no Inflation, full employment, zero debt and all they hear from<br />
yourself and your colleagues over the past ten years is rhetoric that<br />
just isn't matched with performance in the broad macro-economic<br />
indicators?<br />
PM: Well let me put it to you as politely as you gave me the introduction,<br />
that is simply not true. Ten years ago, this was an industrial ruin.<br />
Ten years ago, Australia was just a lump of industrial archaeology with<br />
an old secondary industry that was completely uncompetitive, which<br />
had a managed exchange rate which was massively overvalued, which<br />
had a tariff wall which had no international competitiveness<br />
whatsoever. Do you realise in that time we have added to a labour<br />
market of 6 million, we have now added over 2 million jobs? We have<br />
got the highest rate of employment in this country we have seen.<br />
C: We have also got one of the highest rates of unemployment.<br />
PM: No we haven't. We have got unemployment now at around<br />
8 1/ 2 per cent against a massive participation rate, particularly<br />
amongst women in the workforce, and we have got an inflation rate for<br />
the last four years under 2 per cent. So when John Howard left office,<br />
the inflation rate was just on 11 per cent. After the 1981/ 82 recession,<br />
he left us an 11 per cent inflation rate. Ours has been, for the last four<br />
years, 1.9 per cent and as I have just said earlier in the program, we<br />
have had 630,000 jobs. Now let me also tell you this. Exports, which<br />
is basically the meat and drink of our future, ten years ago we<br />
exported 14 per cent of all we produce. Today that is 22 per cent of </p>
<p>TEL: 9<br />
GDP. Let me just give you a simiple number. GDP is a total economy.<br />
This year GDP is at $ 500 billion. We have taken exports from<br />
14 per cent to 22 per cent. So we have gone up by 8 per cent of GDP.<br />
We have gone up by $ 40 billion in exports $ 40,000 million in exports.<br />
Where do you reckon we would be if the Labor Government hadn't<br />
been able to regenerate and modernise Australian industry, restore<br />
our competitiveness and get all that export growth? What do you<br />
reckon the current account would be now? And what do you reckon<br />
interest rates would be? And where do you reckon you would be?<br />
C: Well interest rates really aren't anything to be boasting about at the<br />
moment.<br />
PMV: Well they are a lot lower than they used to be when Mr Howard was<br />
around by a very large margin.<br />
C: Yes, but I think you know I can under-stand you need to make<br />
comparisons with them.<br />
PM: Well you're making them, why shouldn't I? You have made the claim<br />
that nothing has happened in ten years, why can't I respond?<br />
C: Well I think in terms of foreign debt a lot has happened.<br />
PM., Oh, you are back to the debt. You see you have asked me about<br />
growth in employment and basically I have given you the answer there.<br />
We have had just about, next to the United States, the fastest<br />
employment growth in the western world in the last decade. We have<br />
had a huge, complete, change to our industrial base. We have had a<br />
revolution in the labour market. The lowest level of industrial disputes<br />
now since we have been keeping records back to the 1 940s. We have<br />
got an inflation rate under 2 per cent and now after my commitments at<br />
the last election to get employment back, the most solemn commitment<br />
a Government can give to employment which has been more than<br />
matched by any objective the Government had, you are back now to<br />
the only other argument which is about the current account deficit and<br />
the debt. To which I said, as I said earlier, we now have twice the<br />
capacity to service our debt that we had ten years ago.<br />
JL: Okay, Prime Minister and caller I think we have got to call it a day<br />
there in light of the fact that we have got a heap of other calls there<br />
and a whole rot of faxes. Thank you, Prime Minister. Dear Ralph<br />
( that's me, when they fax me) please ask Paul Keating if he is serious<br />
about creating more jobs why the Government punishes the small<br />
business employer by making us pay employee superannuation<br />
contributions and for heavens sake ask him to get rid of that stupid<br />
17.5 per cent holiday loading. Just removing those two burdens would<br />
immediately create new jobs. At least, I know I would employ more<br />
people. 26 i u 1 c'l I ci 0 0 4 F 0 9 </p>
<p>TEL: 26.. Jul. 95 1 : 33 Njoi<br />
PM: Well, the world is not made for, simply, employers to make the profit<br />
share in the economy higher than it now is. John, I mentioned to you<br />
earlier..<br />
JL: But, it is pretty important to have people wanting to employ others.<br />
P M: We have just had 630,000 job growth. We are neck and neck with the<br />
United States as the fastest employing country in the western world.<br />
JL But, we have still got 8 per cent unemployment, so we have got to take<br />
care of the 8 per cent.<br />
PM. OK, so we need to get more, but the way to do it is not to basically hop<br />
into ordinary people again. During my break, John Howard had his<br />
headland speech.<br />
JL But listen, aren't small business people ordinary people?<br />
P M: Yes, but the people they employ are ordinary people too. So, you talk<br />
about the holiday leave loading, You take someone who is on $ 20,000<br />
or $ 22,000 a year, they are just making ends meet. They have got a<br />
couple of kids and they have their holidays. Without the leave loading,<br />
In other words without the normal overtime and the various penalty<br />
rates they enjoy in work across the year, when they go on holiday they<br />
take a big reduction. That is where the holiday leave loading comes<br />
from to protect their income during this period.<br />
JL: Yes, but even the man who introduced it says that it was a mistake.<br />
PM: John, it was not a mistake and let me just make this clear to you. That<br />
is all taken care of in the overall wages system because this small<br />
business person, if he wasn't paying the holiday leave loading he<br />
would be paying more in aggregate wages. That is where the Accord<br />
comes in. How do you reckon we have got an inflation rate of 2 to 3<br />
per cent if we have got a tear-away wages system?<br />
JL Russell from Albury Why is it the harder you work the more the<br />
Government wants to take off you. If I was unemployed and not<br />
working the Government gives you everything all the benefits<br />
instead of me working three jobs seven days a week to try to stay<br />
ahead, I'd be better off on the dole. It is very hard to keep the dream<br />
alive. How do you feel about that sort of attitude?<br />
PM: I can only say that we have given Australians a growth economy now<br />
for over a decade, apart from 18 months of the recession. You know<br />
that in Ralph Willis' Budget the Treasury are forecasting, not only<br />
growth this year, but for the next three years. So, from 1998 back to<br />
1983 which is 16 years, we have had an 18 months dip in growth in the<br />
recession, we have had growth as high as and around the highest 0 0 4 F 10 2 C </p>
<p>TEL: 26. Ju12.5 1 : Z13 No .0<br />
levels of the western world for 16 years, we have had huge<br />
employment growth and we have had reasonable income growth.<br />
JL: But how do we keep Russell of Albury happy because I imagine that<br />
there are hundreds of thousands of Russells listening to us. If he feels<br />
and he is working three jobs seven days a week that he would be<br />
better off on the dole. How do we accommodate the fears of Russell?<br />
PM: When I came to government, again let me talk about Mr Howard who is<br />
always talking about me. His top marginal rate was 60 per cent. It is<br />
now 47 per cent. The middle rate was in the high thirties per cent. It is<br />
now much lower and the bottom rate was 30 per cent and it is now<br />
per cent.<br />
JL So, all you are saying to Russell is it could be a lot worse?<br />
PM: No, I am saying to Russell we have had huge tax cuts through the<br />
1980s for people like him and they have stayed there. Those rates<br />
have stayed there. The bottom rate was 30 per cent it is now 20 per<br />
cent. The middle rates in their high thirties have declined. The top<br />
rate has gone from 60 to 47 per cent. The company rate has gone<br />
down from 46 per cent under John Howard to 36 per cent under us and<br />
we provide full dividend relief for share holders as well. So, whether<br />
you are in small business or you are an employee, John, this is second<br />
lowest taxed country in the western world. Our tax revenue to GDP is<br />
the second lowest in the western world than is an OECD statistic.<br />
JL I understand all this, but it still doesn't placate the Russells of the<br />
world who feel that they are getting a raw deal and he would be better<br />
off on the dole. Not a healthy feeling to have is it?<br />
PMV: But, I mean, that is not' the majority view obviously, otherwise we<br />
wouldn't have a workforce of eight million people. It is a view, but I'm<br />
telling Russell that revenue, that is all the revenue of the<br />
Commonwealth under this Government has fallen sharply and that the<br />
tax rates themselves have fallen, including the ones that most affect<br />
him that is the tax free threshold which has gone up from $ 4500 to<br />
around, from memory, $ 5400. The bottom rate from 30 per cent down<br />
to 20 per cent, and substantial tax relief in the middle ranges which<br />
affects him.<br />
JL So, you are saying it could be worse? I mean, that probably is the only<br />
retort it is not a bad one, I am not criticising it but that is what you<br />
are saying?<br />
PMV: I'm not saying it could be worse, I'm saying it is much better than it<br />
was. Much better than it was. 0 4 P . IKIC/ </p>

C: I have three children and we are expecting our fourth child in January.<br />
That means we will miss out on the maternity leave that will be coming<br />
in in February, is that right?<br />
PM . I'm not sure, I'd need to go and check that one. Let me just say I was<br />
very pleased to be able to announce the new maternity allowance in<br />
the Budget.<br />
C: I'm just wondering how the country can afford to pay that and where is<br />
the money coming from?<br />
PM: We are not only paying it, but we are actually in surplus as well. I am<br />
very proud of the fact that we have supported families.<br />
C: But, wasn't this brought in before in the 1 970s?<br />
PM: No, we have need had ever in this country, ever, a maternity<br />
allowance. This is to help families through the period when a child is<br />
born, when a woman has that time away from the labour market, from<br />
work, in that period afterwards. It is for six weeks and our objective<br />
over time is to move it up to 12. But, that fits in with a broader set of<br />
policies to support families like yours. That is, the Family Allowance<br />
Supplement or additional family payment, the general family allowance<br />
and, of course, if you have a child in child care for instance, the<br />
generalised child care rebate or the fee relief. Can I say to you, I have<br />
seen much of my mission as a Federal Minister and as Prime Minister<br />
of being out there on the front foot to help families, to help people on<br />
low to middle incomes. Because the people on high incomes can help<br />
themselves. I am talking about people on low to middle incomes.<br />
Giving them a right to medical protection through Medicare, having<br />
that income support when they need it, giving them support now when<br />
they have a child and we'are doing all that with government spending<br />
to GOP that is government spending in the whole economy at really,<br />
In an underlying sense now, at early 1 970s levels. On the forward<br />
estimates of this Government's budget in two years time, we will have<br />
government spending back to the level that existed before the Whitlam<br />
government came into office and yet we have got that targeted to help<br />
the people who really most need it.<br />
JL: Are you getting the answer you want here?<br />
C: Not really.<br />
PM; What would you like? What would you like me to say? We can't<br />
afford it, it is a shocking thing to pay money to families?<br />
C: Well, we decided to have this child because we think we can afford it.<br />
PM: Good. TEL </p>
<p>TEL 13<br />
C: And I don't expect any money from the Government just because we<br />
are having this baby, well we won't be getting it anyway.<br />
PM: Do you class yourselves as a high income earner?<br />
C: No. We are just an average family, we are paying a mortgage.<br />
, JL: Can I ask how old you are?<br />
C: 32.<br />
JI. OK and you husband is working and you don't expect any money from<br />
the Government, so what you are saying in essence is you have<br />
decided to have this child because you believe you could afford it and<br />
why don't other people wait until they can afford to have children?<br />
PM: Well, your husbands income must be such that you can believe that.<br />
But lets say<br />
C: He works very hard, and he pays a lot of taxes.<br />
PM: OK, but where our policies..<br />
C: We are paying for it anyway in the long run aren't we.<br />
PM: Our policies are directed, but it is a matter of who pays. It is a matter<br />
of whether the tax treatment and the benefits of tax payers with<br />
children are more advantageous than the tax treatment and payments<br />
to tax payers without children. It is called horizontal equity. On this<br />
question of horizontal equity, we believe that tax payers with children<br />
or people that have children through direct benefits from the<br />
government get supported. Our policies are directed towards one,<br />
two, three and four children it ' is* paid per child. The Family<br />
Allowance Supplement or additional family payment is paid per child.<br />
The policy of the Government is to look after the children, but in doing<br />
that, of course, we buttress the income of the family. I am surprised<br />
you don't think it is worth doing.<br />
JL I'm not sure that she doesn't think it is worth doing, you are just asking<br />
can we afford it.<br />
PM: No, the lady said to me that she doesn't think that the Government<br />
should pay for it.<br />
C: Well, the national deficit is so bad..<br />
PM: No, but it isn't so bad.<br />
C: on all these things and, I mean, If it is a great thing why can't we<br />
introduce it later and why does it have.. T: 26. JuI2.5 1 33 N o. 00 4 1 3/ </p>
<p>TEL: 26. JUI. 95 1: 33, No.(<br />

PM: Let me just say, the national deficit isn't so bad. That is the Budget is<br />
in surplus and government debt to GDP is amongst the lowest in the<br />
western world.<br />
C: Well, don't you think that money would go better towards<br />
unemployment programs.<br />
PM: We are already doing those and we have had this year a very big<br />
underspend on government programs because we have got so many<br />
more people back to work. You realise that in Working Nation which is<br />
the big program I introduced when I said we wouldn't leave the<br />
unemployed behind, particularly the long term unemployed, we have<br />
just in this Budget yielded substantial savings from the forward<br />
estimates because of the underspends here because so many people<br />
have gone back to work. So, I don't think we should worry about the<br />
state of the Budget. The Budget is in surplus and these are<br />
affordable. Can I just say this to you, when John Howard said a week<br />
ago in his headland speech he was going to have deep cuts in<br />
government spending, he means on these programs. He won't pay for<br />
payments to families, he'll cut payments of pharmaceutical payments<br />
for pensioners which is the big burgeoning growth area of the health<br />
scheme. He'll cut payments to schools because they are the only<br />
places you can now cut government spending without really to raise<br />
money and where there is the room to raise some money.<br />
JL: There would be a lot of people who would think that you could cut<br />
government spending in the area of welfare.<br />
PM: Well, we are now delivering John..<br />
JL: Are you still there?<br />
C: Yes.<br />
JL OK<br />
PM:. You could have said that and made that stick in 1983 or 1984, but after<br />
the 1980s reforms and the targeting of the social security system.<br />
Remember the big fight we had over the assets test.<br />
JL: Yes.<br />
PM: After the introduction of those things, and the fact that we now have a<br />
targeted system, for instance, just take the additional family payment.<br />
We pay it from about $ 17000 and it cuts out at about $ 26000 or<br />
$ 27000. In other words it is targeted. We don't pay it to people who<br />
are getting $ 37000 or $ 40000. J004 P .141 -C0 </p>

JL OK, would you just explain to our caller, my listener there, again what<br />
you mean and if you could do it briefly because we have got a bundle<br />
of calls, but I think it would interest her and it would clarify it, when you<br />
talked about tax payers with children as opposed to tax payers without<br />
children?<br />
PM: It IS this notion of horizontal equity. Do you provide the same level of<br />
assistance in tax and direct payments to a tax payer without children or<br />
do you recognise the burden of a family having children?<br />
JL Ok, is that clear to you?<br />
C. I don't think it could help the people that are unemployed if they had<br />
more children.<br />
PM: No, that is a different argument again. Let me just assure you of this,<br />
we have got an increase in unemployment benefits now which has<br />
been a massive Improvement over what it was when John Howard and<br />
company left office. We have now got these labour market programs<br />
which he says he will cut, these are the ones that are directed towards<br />
pulling the long term unemployed back into the labour market. In fact,<br />
we are having so much success with them, a quarter of all the jobs this<br />
year have gone to long term unemployed people. That is, people<br />
unemployed for 12 months or more.<br />
C: Well, you haven't bought my vote, Mr Keating.<br />
PM: No, but I don't think I'm going to am I?<br />
C: No.<br />
PM;. That is the point. I don't* mind having discussions with people of the<br />
conservative bias, but understand this, there are families out there that<br />
need support and we are giving it to them.<br />
C: Yes.<br />
PM: Thank you.<br />
JL: A fax from Queensland. Mr Keating, why does your government<br />
contrive to discriminate against the white working class man in regard<br />
to a number of issues, but not in the least Aboriginal legal aid,<br />
particularly In civil cases such as the one at the moment regarding the<br />
poker machine fiasco. Are you aware of the poker machine fiasco?<br />
PM: No, I'm not John.<br />
JL: Two Aboriginal women having a fight over who put the 10 cent piece in<br />
the slot and who is entitled to the $ 48000. It is now in front of the<br />
Supreme Court, both of them are in front of the Supreme Court </p>
<p>TEL 26 . Ju I 951: 3N. 0 1F/<br />

because of Aboriginal legal aid. H-e finds that offensive when he<br />
couldn't get the same thing.<br />
PM: Legal aid is generally available. It is set up on a criteria, we have<br />
added financially to the budget of legal aids dramatically through the<br />
1 980s and 1990s. It is there for people when they really need it, there<br />
are tests of course.<br />
JL:* Yes, but it is not there for civil cases such as this, but Aboriginal legal<br />
aid is. That is the point he is making. If he wanted to have a fight<br />
about who put the money in the poker machine, he would be paying<br />
his own way whereas both these Aboriginal women in front of the<br />
Supreme Court, which doesn't come cheap, are being supported by<br />
Aboriginal legal aid and Aboriginal legal aid is supported by the tax<br />
payers of Australia.<br />
PM; I must have missed that one, but the fact of the matter is that, of<br />
course, there are Aboriginal legal aid services there and they are there<br />
because as a class of individuals they suffer more discrimination than<br />
is the case with the rest of the community and so the Aboriginal legal<br />
aid services have mattered enormously to improving the equity of to<br />
the lot of Aboriginal people. But, I mean, there is not much profit on<br />
this program going to every case and who has got what.<br />
JL: No, there Isn't but you understand the point he is making.<br />
PMV: I'd have to know the details to understand the point. John, I<br />
understand the broad point he is making and whether it is right or not I<br />
don't know.<br />
JL: Yes, it is right, but to another fax. Can the Government assist private<br />
health fund members through tax rebates. We are forced to withdraw<br />
because of Increasing fees, the cost of Medicare will increase<br />
dramatically anyway.<br />
PM: Tax rebates will only do two things. It will lift the cost of private<br />
hospital services and lift the incomes of medical practitioners<br />
practising privately in those hospitals. It will not improve the overall<br />
tone of the health system and that is the key issue. What will happen,<br />
people will pay, they think they get a tax deduction, it will simply just be<br />
paid away in higher premiums. This is the point we have been arguing<br />
with the Coalition now for a decade,<br />
JL: I understand the point he is making however. If people are In a<br />
position to be able to afford their own health care, if they were<br />
encouraged to take out their own health insurance, wouldn't that then<br />
be for the betterment of the people who can't afford their own health<br />
care, wouldn't it improve the quality of their treatment. I 3,3 N o 0 0 4 P 16 </p>

PMV: We have got a proportion of the community, a substantial proportion<br />
taking private health insurance.<br />
JL Yes, but again, like saving they are not given much incentive to do it.<br />
PM. A lot of this comes back to the whole principle of community rating.<br />
You have heard of this expression community rating and that is<br />
whether Australia should have a private market in private insurance.<br />
That really means whether young, healthy people pay less for their<br />
insurance than older less well people. In other words, there is a<br />
market. Now, this community has generally taken the view that the<br />
private insurance rates should the be same for everybody and that<br />
older people in the system were once younger people who have paid<br />
for 30 or 40 years and now expect the system to support them in their<br />
old age and where they have health problems. But, while ever that<br />
situation remains the young and healthy people will say, ' well, what's<br />
the point of me paying this premium when I'm not likely to be using the<br />
system'. So, what happens is the system generally gravitates towards<br />
older, less well people. So, It has more costs.<br />
C: I'd just like to say to Paul that he is doing a great job. I have been all<br />
over Australia with my job.<br />
JL: Where are you now?<br />
C: Emerald, Queensland. I've been up to the Territory and down to NSW.<br />
I've seen what his money has done and where it has been, but a point<br />
for the people is that what would they rather a government that does<br />
the work with a bit of irritation or a government that bows to all of the<br />
do-gooders and all the righteous groups? If they done that there<br />
would be no progress, there would be no jobs, there would be no<br />
wealth for the country, they would just be bowing to all the do-gooders.<br />
JL: So you are happy with the Prime Minister?<br />
C: Yes<br />
PM: Well thank you for the compliment. I mean I am not sure there is such<br />
a great body of Labor voters out there in John's audience. But you are<br />
one. Thank you, indeed.<br />
C: I have seen with the Aboriginal funding, I have been up to the<br />
Territory, I have seen all the new houses in places like Elliott and<br />
Katherine and Darwin and all that and there is a lot of funding there.<br />
But if you bow to all the do-gooders, there would be no money for the<br />
houses and the builders who build them well they wouldn't have any<br />
jobs because there would be no houses to build.<br />
JL: Okay. </p>
<p>TEL: 2 L. Ju I. 5 1 : 337 N o. 004 F,. 1 2 C<br />
PM; Thank you for the compliment, but the main thing is that this is<br />
economy has grown at a clip for now 12 or 13 years, bar 18 months,<br />
and it is going to grow for the next 3 years and we are now at a<br />
sustainable rate of economic growth. You see how John Howard got<br />
into the Governor of the Reserve Bank for having the temerity to ping<br />
his cynical lie that we had five minutes of sunshine. Of course, we<br />
have had years of high economic growth. We have had, now, nearly<br />
3 and 1/ 2 years of economic growth since the recession and we have<br />
got 3 years in the forward estimates ahead of us and we have now, I<br />
think, succeeded with the policy changes this year of actually getting<br />
the economy back to a sustainable growth rate, taking the pressure off<br />
interest rates and getting the Budget back into surplus and seeing low<br />
inflation pinned into place, of course, through productivity rising in the<br />
economy and through the Accord with the unions. I mean, we have<br />
got a most stable economic situation, growth situation, the likes of<br />
which we have rarely seen.<br />
JL: Okay, our caller in Emerald, thank you very much. It was good to hear<br />
from you and I am sure the Prime Minister was delighted to hear from<br />
you too. Just back to your statement about you wouldn't find too many<br />
Labor voters out there in John Laws' audience. If you wouldn't, you<br />
have got a big problem because this is a big audience, 70 stations<br />
across Australia. What makes you think that there aren't going to be<br />
too many of your supporters?<br />
PM: I think there probably are, but they are not as noisy as some of the<br />
others. They don't ring in and make faxes and needle you after the<br />
program.<br />
JL: Well I don't know that I am entitled to be needled today. I didn't ask<br />
the questions, they did.. This one comes from Michael Tyres,<br />
" A number of years ago you wanted to introduce", and we are going to<br />
have to be very quick we have got'about a minute to answer this " a<br />
GST package into our country. You failed to do so with your Party.<br />
Why don't you bite the bullet, introduce a GST package into Australia<br />
and fix the overseas debt problem?"<br />
PM: Because that wouldn't fix the overseas debt problem. Rather than<br />
simply put more revenue into the system, what I did then after that<br />
policy change failed was to actually cut the size of Government<br />
spending. So, now we don't need a large second base in the tax<br />
system to fund the Government sector. It is now much smaller, it is<br />
much smaller and doesn't need a second tax base. So, when I was<br />
refused a 081-type tax in the middle 1980s, I took the hard way out<br />
and that was actually go root and branch through the Commonwealth<br />
spending and outlays and cut it back.<br />
JL: Okay.<br />

PM: Well no soft rides for others.<br />
JL: No, no, well I don't give anybody a soft ride.<br />
PM: Okay, I will keep you up to that.<br />
JL: Okay, well it would be good because there is a bundle of questions<br />
here.<br />
PMV: Well I mean, look,<br />
JL: There is a board full of questions.<br />
PM: I mean let me just repeat one of the things I started and just say, John,<br />
you have just got to look at the last week, you know. A ship we<br />
couldn't have hoped to produce 20 years ago; a world ranking set of<br />
studios, the largest in an English language country outside of America;<br />
$ 1 billion from the Ford Motor Company; American Express, the<br />
largest credit card company in the world, basing its whole East Asian<br />
operation in Australia; 50,000 jobs for the month; and, the stock market<br />
hitting a high for the year. I mean it is not a bad week.<br />
JL: No, it was a terrific week and I think the people should be aware of it<br />
and proud of Australia too in these instances. But they still, obviously,<br />
have a lot of concerns and it would appear that the main concern is the<br />
overseas debt.<br />
PM;* But that again, like we say, you move up in this country by getting a bit<br />
of debt and buying a house and you move up as a country by getting a<br />
bit of debt and buying some investment.<br />
JL Interesting analogy and I hope the people take it to heart and<br />
Prime Minister good to talk to you.<br />
PM: Thank you, John.<br />
JL Are you coming to my party?<br />
PM: It's your party and you'll cry if I don't. Won't you and I wouldn't like to<br />
see you in tears. I think there is somebody else who used to cry all the<br />
time and I just couldn't stand it.<br />
JL So does that mean yes? </p>
