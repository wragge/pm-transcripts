FOR MEDIA 9 JANUARY 1991<br />
Her Majesty The Queen has approved Letters Patent and<br />
Regulations establishing nine new Defence Force awards<br />
for use in operational situations. They are the Victoria<br />
Cross for Australia, the Star of Gallantry, the Medal for<br />
Gallantry, the Commendation for Gallantry, the<br />
Distinguished Service Cross, the Distinguished Service<br />
Medal, the Commendation for Distinguished Service, the<br />
Unit Citation for Gallantry, and the Meritorious Unit<br />
Citation. This brings to fifteen the number of new awards for the<br />
Australian Defence Force that have now been approved by<br />
The Queen on the recommendation of my Government. These<br />
awards have all been established in pursuit of our<br />
commitment to develop a comprehensive and indigenous<br />
system cf Australian honours and awards.<br />
The Queen approved in 1988 the Australian Active Service<br />
Medal, the Australian Service Medal, and the Champion<br />
Shots Medal. In 1989, Her Majesty approved the Nursing<br />
Service Cross, the Conspicuous Service cross and the<br />
Conspicuous Service Medal. The Queen has now approved<br />
the following awards:<br />
The Vintnrfa Crs will be the highest Australian<br />
decoration. Like its Imperial counterpart, it will<br />
accord recognition to persons who perform acts of the<br />
most conspicuous gallantry, acts of valour or selfsacrifice<br />
or extreme devotion to duty in the presence of<br />
the enemy. Persons awarded the Victoria Cross will be<br />
entitled to use the post-nominal " VC".<br />
The Qaij-antry npnnrmtin will be awarded to members of<br />
the Aust~ ralian Defence Force and certain other persons in<br />
recognit~ ion of gallantry in action. Three levels of the<br />
award are proposed: the Star of Gallantry, the Medal for<br />
Gallantr7y, and the Commendation for Gallantry. Persons<br />
awarded the Star and Medal will be entitled to use the<br />
post-noranals " SG" and ' MG" respectively.<br />
The AIuaY-allan nigtingnighpa Sprvinp D~ norat-inng will<br />

certain other persons for distinguished command and<br />
leadership in action or distinguished performance of<br />
duties : Ln warlike operations. Three levels of the award<br />

<p>Distinguished Service. Persons awarded the Cross and<br />
Medal will. be entitled to use the post-. nominais " DSC" and<br />
" DSM" respectively.<br />
The Unit . Xat in will recognise gallantry in action or<br />
outstanding service in warlike operations by units of the<br />
Defence Force and the defence forces of other countries.<br />
Two decorations are provided for: the Unit Citation for<br />
Gallantry; and the Meritorious Unit Citation.<br />
The approval of these awards by Her Majesty now completes<br />
the Government's program to have in place a<br />
comprehensive, indigenous system of military awards and<br />
decorations within an indigenous Australian honours<br />
system. The placement of the new awards in the<br />
Australian Order of precedence of Honours and Awards, as<br />
approved by Her Majesty, will be published in the<br />
Commonwealth Gazette.<br />
I would like to congratulate the Ministers for<br />
Administrative Services and Defence Science and<br />
Personnel, and their predecessors, for the efforts in<br />
developing and putting in place a comprehensive system of<br />
Australian Defence Force awards. Their efforts will<br />
enable a proper recognition of the valuable contribution<br />
made by Australian service men and women, and other<br />
associated persons, in both operational circumstances and<br />
in times of peace, for many generations to come. </p>
