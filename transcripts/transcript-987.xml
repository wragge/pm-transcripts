    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Â P.M. NoÂ 65/1964</strong></p>
<p>Mr. Bolte is a capable, experiencedÂ and successfulÂ Premier. The preparation of his budget for the State of Victoria is his responsibility in which he needs no adviceÂ from the Commonwealth.</p>
<p>The proposals which he has made for the impositionÂ of income tax will be the subject of study by the appropriateÂ officers in the Federal Treasury who in due course willÂ report to me asÂ Acting Treasurer.</p>
<p>I hve been asked by Mr, BolteÂ to discuss theÂ proposals with him and I will do so shortly at a mutuallyÂ convenient time.</p>
<p>Melbourne<br />10Â September, 1964,</p>
