    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong> P.M. No 65/1964</strong></p>
<p>Mr. Bolte is a capable, experienced and successful Premier. The preparation of his budget for the State of Victoria is his responsibility in which he needs no advice from the Commonwealth.</p>
<p>The proposals which he has made for the imposition of income tax will be the subject of study by the appropriate officers in the Federal Treasury who in due course will report to me as Acting Treasurer.</p>
<p>I hve been asked by Mr, Bolte to discuss the proposals with him and I will do so shortly at a mutually convenient time.</p>
<p>Melbourne<br />10 September, 1964,</p>
