    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to announce that I will visit China from 17 to 19 August.  This will be my fourth visit as Prime Minister, the most recent being in May 2002.</p>
<p>  The focus of my visit will be to meet with the new Chinese leadership, including President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao, who assumed office early this year.</p>
<p>  Relations between Australia and China have grown strongly in recent years, with an impressive level of cooperation and dialogue across a broad range of areas. Our economic partnership, in particular, continues to expand - as demonstrated by the Guangdong province LNG supply deal, worth an estimated $25 billion over 25 years.  China is Australia';s third largest trading partner and our fourth largest export market - purchasing $9 billion worth of Australian goods and services last year.  Two-way trade was worth $23 billion in 2002.  I will discuss ways our governments can work together to promote even closer economic ties.</p>
<p>My visit will also provide a timely opportunity to discuss international issues, including key regional security concerns.  China has been playing a crucial role in bringing North Korea to the negotiating table along with other key players.  China';s continued positive involvement will be vital if efforts to achieve a durable and peaceful solution are to succeed.  I hope to discuss with China';s leaders how this process might be taken forward.  </p>
