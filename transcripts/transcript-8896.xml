TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON PAJ KEATING, MP<br />
ADDRESS AT OPENING OF ALP HEADQUARTERS, CANBERRA,<br />
FRIDAY, 18 JUNE 1993<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
Thank you Bob ( Hogg), President Barry ( Jones) and other distinguished<br />
members of the National Executive, particularly our Secretary Gary ( Grey),<br />
Andrew ( Schroth) representing Civil and Civic, my Deputy Brian Howe, other<br />
members of the parliamentary party, Lionel Bowen its lovely to see you<br />
Uonel, Fred ( Daley), the father of the tribe as he is called I don't know<br />
where that leaves Gough ( Whitiam), probably the Holy Ghost I suppose, with<br />
many people vying for the job of Son. John Bannon and Angela who Is with<br />
him, thanks for coming over John during your Presidency this occurred, David<br />
Combe who was the first ' Mr Builder' of the Labor party, the Federal Labor party<br />
and it is great to see him here on this occasion and other distinguished guests.<br />
I am sure I have left somebody out, but I'm sure they will believe they are<br />
distinguished, ladies and gentlemen.<br />
It is a very telling thing 10to see a modem, strong, contemporary building like this<br />
opened under the ownership and name of the Australian Labor Party in 1993;<br />
that Is Centenary House, a century on the Labor party has remained relevant to<br />
Australia and useful to the Australia people. What often happens with political<br />
parties over such an extended period, they are no longer useful to their<br />
communities, the fall into disrepair, often disrepute, and they fade away. The<br />
remarkable thing Is that our Party which, of course, has always taken its<br />
strength and Inspiration from the great body of the Australian people has<br />
maintalned Its strength of purpose and Its Integrity and Its usefulness to the.<br />
community of Australia and therefore 100 years after its founding we still*<br />
control the national government of Australia after a decade, many of the States,<br />
and until recently most of the States, and here we are building a building to take<br />
us on into the next century as this building will.<br />
This must say something about us as a Party, about our capacity to change,<br />
our ability to tap the consciousness of the Australian ommuiy oudrtn </p>

Its aspiratons, and to try and do justice to them. The building represents more<br />
than an Investment or an abode for our federal officers, It represents in a very<br />
tangible way the life spirit of the Labor party In that In difficult financial times<br />
even and with another federal election behind us aind its expense we have been<br />
able to build a building like this and perhaps a testimony to the culture we hav# e<br />
ushered In In this country to see it built under budget and under time. That Is a<br />
tribute to Civil and Civic, but of course a greater tribute to the people who work<br />
and build bildings, the workers of this country, and In this case of the ACT.<br />
who put this building up.<br />
It speaks muvch about the contemporary Labor party and its relevance to<br />
modem Australia and as Barry said a moment ago we are out there again,<br />
starting to draw on some of those Issues which have for so long lain dormant<br />
which Indicates we will always be the Party of change In this country and the<br />
Party that recognises the true underlying issues of substance and tries to do<br />
something about them. I sincerely hope that in this year where so many young<br />
people are now joining the party one of the great things about the election Is<br />
that thousands of young people are joining the Labor party. I went to a function<br />
for Clyde Holding recently in Melbourne on the occasion of his 31 st year In<br />
elective public life and a third to forty per cent of the people there would have<br />
been under 30. We are seeing them coming to our State branches, people<br />
phoning up to join, and for a party to get such an Infusion of youth and<br />
enthusiasm will, of course, carry us on for another generation.<br />
This is a tremendous change for us. We don't have mass parties In Australia,<br />
we like to think we are mass parties, they are not large parties neither the<br />
Labor party nor the Coalition parties they are not large by world standards,<br />
but they are enthusiastic, they are paticipatory parties and to get such a<br />
charge from young people today Is tremendous.<br />
So, If you look at the building and the election and subsequently the<br />
enthusiasms of the election are embracing these great national Issues and the<br />
Influx of young people I think it has got to say a lot about the Party which fit<br />
very nicely with the deblsion to build this building.<br />
It Is funny how foresight always matters, and David Combe had this when he<br />
built our first building, which was a struggle. David was always a frustrated<br />
developer and became a developer not long thereafter and we got the building<br />
up and the building, in our most difficult time in our financial history of recent<br />
times, stood us In great stead as we sold some of it down to pay the election<br />
costs of the previous election. But it said more than that, it was again at its.<br />
time a contemporary building, a brave statement of the Labor party it put a<br />
large building which was then, by Canberra's reckoning, a large building. And I<br />
always thought it was very nicely juxtaposed against the pastiche the Ulberal<br />
party put up a couple of blocks away. It was almost lifted straight from the<br />
suburbs of Connecticut, this architectural pastiche which fitted the politi~ cal<br />
pastiche of the Uberal party. Here they were all being tradltional, this must<br />
have been In their ' all the way the L13J' phase. Or it cp~ sd by ee ht hy </p>

Eggleton looking suitably wise and Menzian felt he had to be surrounded by a<br />
building with traditional cultural emblems of more conservative times and<br />
values. So they built this building and I have always thought it was a scream.<br />
Every time I have come past It I have always thought it was a scream of a<br />
building. But it sits over there, and In and out they go In their cars and when<br />
ever their crises are on In they walk, with the little Georgian windows and you<br />
used to see Tony Eggieton bobbing around through his oval Georgian spoked<br />
window. Isn't this them? And Its just the same, whether Its last week with Mabo or be it<br />
the republic. We have now got Petrou Georglau, who must be breaking new<br />
ground for anyone with a name like that, pushing John Hewson towards<br />
standing up to the monarchy last week when he supposedly wrote the signature<br />
tune on his last speech. Well, be careful John, be careful. That is all I say.<br />
Don't ail believe that old advisers are good advisers. But this Is them. It<br />
doesn't matter what it Is in the contemporary environment, you can bet they will<br />
always be down the time tunnel there, tripping along behind us.<br />
Anyway, here we are brave as always, modern to a fault, putting up this<br />
wonderful building and let me pay you know I am normally such a critic of<br />
packing case architecture and Australians architects and the post-modem<br />
school but, I think Darryl Jackson and Alister Swain have done a marvellous<br />
job here. When our architects get It right, they get It right in a big way and we<br />
want to thank them for this effort and with the builders they have done<br />
something really contemporary and good for us.<br />
I think It says a lot about the spirit of the Party, that we should, in difficult<br />
political times and they were, jump In and build a building like this In bad<br />
financial times as well. Of course we had the support of the trade unions and<br />
the ACTU In the financing of John Curtin House and acquisition of half the<br />
property, but can I say, to particularly John Bannon who was the President,<br />
under his leadership and, most particulaly In an executive sense, to Bob Hogg<br />
a second ' Mr Buiider has come along and put up a building for us and though<br />
Bob has now left the federal secretaryship of the Party he leaves behind<br />
another monument to his great contribution to the Australian Labor Party. Barry<br />
mentioned ItIn Victoria, we have mentioned itI nt he national domain of national<br />
politics and a couple of significant national elections, but in organisational<br />
terms, Bob will go down as one of the greats of our Party and this building will<br />
be here probably when we are ali long gone.<br />
Thank you Bob, and John, for your work here today, but I would like to thank<br />
David Combes for starting this process of giving the Labor Party assets which it<br />
Is able to call, on In difficult times, for those of you in the National Executive<br />
particularly. And I would like to also thank the Auditor-General as the tenant. I<br />
thought the last time we attacked him in the House he might have oancelled the<br />
lease, but he didn't, he has done the right thing by us and even the super<br />
sleuths like Senator Bishop have been over the lease and apparently she thinks </p>

it is all right as well. So there we are, clean as a whistle. There Is nothing like<br />
getting a Seal of approval from the obscurantists of the Opposition.<br />
Can I now say to the Party In general this Is a monument to our vitality and our<br />
verve. I am very pleased to be associated with It, It is a tribute to be here, it is<br />
nice to be asked to officially open it and to unveil the plaque. Thank you.<br />
