FOR MEDIA SUNDAY, 4 OCTOBER 1981<br />
OPENING OF THE<br />
INDIAN HIGH COMMISSION CHANCERY BUILDING<br />
I am honoured to have been asked to participate in this<br />
historic and symbolic occasion and I would like to thank you,*<br />
High Commissioner, for inviting me to join you at this ceremony.<br />
S I am particularly glad, Mrs Gandhi, that your presence in<br />
Australia fJ* or the Heads of Government Meeting has enabled you<br />
to be present at this ceremony. And I would like to take this.<br />
opportunity to congratulate you, and your government and people,<br />
on the opening of this new High Commission.<br />
Indeed, all those who have contributed to the building of this<br />
distinctive chancery, which in its style is so characteristic<br />
of India and which so gracefully adorns Australia's capital<br />
city, are to be congratulated.<br />
India and Australia have had a long and close relationship.<br />
We share a democratic experience and this experience has<br />
taught us that with mutual respect and an understanding of<br />
the position of others, different interests can be reconciled to<br />
the benefic't of all. But the warmth of the friendship between our<br />
two countries goes further than this, and extends to sporting<br />
and cultural links, as well as a wide and increasing range of<br />
contacts between our people.<br />
There is an increasing awareness of India in Australia, an<br />
increasing exposure of Indian news in Australia media, an<br />
extensive interest in the study of India in Australian universities.<br />
These and other factors encourage Australian tourists to visit<br />
India and to learn more of your country. I would also mention<br />
that our two countries have recently agreed to new and attractive<br />
air travel aprrangements which will give further encouragement<br />
to tourism-and I welcome the increasing interest in India by<br />
young Australians. The impressions and attachments that young<br />
people form through such exchanges will strengthen the bonds of<br />
friendship between our two countries.<br />
I have had t he pleasure of visiting India on several occasions<br />
in the past two years and have seen something of the richness<br />
of Indian civilization, and of the greatne~ ss of your history<br />
and traditions. Australians cannot fail to be impressed-by the<br />
combination of India's ancient heritag~ e and her contemporary.<br />
cultural vitality, together, of course, with her impressive<br />
advances, often in the face of formidable difficulties, in<br />
agriculture, science and industry. </p>
<p>2<br />
It is also pleasing that the recent high-level mission to<br />
India from the Australian Trade Development Council has<br />
returned with-an optimistic view of the prospects for<br />
broadening a number of areas of commercial relationships<br />
between our two countries.<br />
And now this splendid new High Cortmission building brings<br />
to us here in Australia a fascinating glimpse of the style<br />
and architectural heritage of India. India is clearly a<br />
most important nation especially in relation to our part<br />
of the world, with a great deal to contribute to the peace,.<br />
stability and well-being not only of her own region, but<br />
on the wider international front as well.<br />
Over many years, India has been a leader in advocating<br />
international peace and co-operation. India has. spoken with<br />
a voice of co-operation and principle, seeking common ground<br />
between countries and an enlargement of areas of agreement.<br />
As middle-ranking powers we can contribute to international<br />
debate and help play a part in the achievement of results<br />
which might not otherwise be possible.<br />
Mrs Gandhi, you and I have been and are participating<br />
in the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. Today, we<br />
have had an excellent example of the way in which the<br />
Commonwealth can work to achieve positive action in relation to<br />
major issues facing the world. I am referring to the unanimous<br />
declaration of the Cormmonwealth Heads of Government on human<br />
poverty and relations between developed and developing countries.<br />
This declaration has one over-riding purpose: to e:. press as<br />
clearly and as forcefully as possible the joint commitment<br />
of Commonwealth Governments to revitalising the dialogue<br />
between developed. and developing countries. It also aims to<br />
achieve a much wider understanding of the massive size of the<br />
problems which must be dealt with.<br />
The clear and direct language of the declaration expresses<br />
both to governments and to peoples inside and outside the<br />
Commonwealth the urgency with which we believe these immense<br />
human problems must be tackled. Everything which might detract<br />
from the clarity of this message has been deliberately omitted.<br />
It does not deal with specifics or with practical measures.<br />
These will be dealt with at length, and with substance, in the<br />
communique at the end of the meeting. The declaration is<br />
particularly timely coming as it does shortly before the<br />
North-SouthL Summit. at Cancun. in. Mexico.<br />
The Commonwealth has addressed itself to one of the most<br />
pressing and difficult issues facing mankind and has found<br />
a comrimon mind. The declaration of Melbourne is I am sure,<br />
a most significant step in achieving the objectives both<br />
Australia and India seek, and I know that we both take considerable<br />
satisfaction in its achievement.<br />
Again I would like to thank you, Primer Minister, for having<br />
chosen to erect this fine building in Canberra. I am sure that<br />
your Hligh Commissioner and all tho~; c who will work in these<br />
offices over the years to come, will. play a significant role<br />
in advancing the relationship between our two countries.<br />
Today is an important day for India and Australia, and I am<br />
honoured to have been invited to play a part in these celebrations.<br />
