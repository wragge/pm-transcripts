FOR PRESS: P. M. No. 11/ 1969<br />
NUCLEAR POWER IN AUSTRALIA<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton<br />
The Commonwealth has been in contact with the<br />
States about matters associated with the introduction of nuclear<br />
power into Australia. The Government feels that the time is coming<br />
much closer when nuclear power can be competitive with other<br />
forms of power in a number of areas of Australia. There are<br />
many considerations which would be of common concern to the<br />
Commonwealth and the States, and we feel it is opportune to<br />
examine the various matters involved.<br />
The Government has proposed that the Minister<br />
for National Development, Mr. David Fairbairn, should visit<br />
the States and have discussions with appropriate State Ministers<br />
and authorities regarding introduction of nuclear power into<br />
Australia in the future. These discussions would be most useful<br />
as a basis for initiating steps toward the introduction of nuclear<br />
power into the country, including types of reactors, and ensuring<br />
that those reactors would be independent of overseas fuel supplies.<br />
