<p>Q. Is this the first time that you have had to sack a<br />
Minister? Oh, no. But let the dead past bury its deado<br />
Qo Who will replace Mr, Bury?<br />
A, I don't know. I will begin to Uhink about that problem<br />
when I get back home.<br />
Q, Do you think Fred Chaney has got a chance of selection?<br />
A, No, look, i am not going to discuss names, thank you.<br />
Q. In Wollongong recently, when referring to Britain's<br />
proposed entry into the Market, you were quoted as<br />
H saying and I quote, " We stress the need to meet the<br />
new era of trade as a challenge and it must not be<br />
exaggerated into a disaster," Is this a softening<br />
down of your own statements made earlier and mo; e in<br />
line with Mr. Bury's?<br />
Ao None whatever. If you were to read the full text<br />
my speech at Wollongong you would see that it stands<br />
exactly on the same footing as the first statement I<br />
made on this matter and all the ones I have made since,<br />
Qo Was it true that you had to paint a grim picture abroad<br />
to obtain the best terms for Australia and paint a rosy<br />
picture here to retain confidence in industry and<br />
business and boost development?<br />
A, I hope I haven't sunk to that political level, When I<br />
do, people ought to throw me out,<br />
Qo , s it t;--ue 9Mr, Menzies that Australia's position has<br />
improved recently as the result of the Å 127M C-ATT<br />
negotiations between Australia and the Six?<br />
Ao Oh, well, there are some improvements there, but they<br />
are not connected with the Common Market discussions.<br />
There is a process that goes on in GATT quite regularly<br />
in which concessions arc made here or there in exchange<br />
for other concessions, There is a lot of tariff<br />
negotiation that goes on in GlAT,' but that's not the<br />
problem that arises in the Common Market discussions.<br />
The Common Market discussions will determine whether<br />
our preferences inside the Commonwealth, the preferential<br />
pattern of Commonwcalth trade is to continue, or if it<br />
continues, for how long, or on what terms. There is a<br />
great misunderstanding about the position of Australia<br />
on this thing. We have not been overpainting our<br />
picture. We have in fact from the very beginning,<br />
approached the problem constructively, We have had our<br />
officials in discussion with the officials in Great<br />
Britain over the period of a year now, Mro McEwon<br />
has been there, I've been there. On each possible<br />
level, we have presented our views, and all the time,<br />
we've been looking for some process, some agreement<br />
that will maintain to a reascnablo extent our trading<br />
position; though it may not involve the maintenance<br />
in all their original qualities of our preferences,<br />
We have been looking for a middle course of a helful<br />
kind, and I think that anybody in the United Kingdom ooo.../ 3<br />
X This is not a direct quotation from the Prime<br />
Minister s Wollon-nong speech, </p>
<p>team would agtce th* no ccuntry ha,-s bFan so cons tructlv3,<br />
thlough. we have; I admit, been . rsistent i~ n the no<br />
that we havcn~ t take1 ou-, teeth ou" of this mattgrs,<br />
Day by day, weed: by week, we Lave been pressing cer-tain<br />
views thiat we hold. And thea effect of this ha-i yet to<br />
be seen.* The Si-' c may modify some of thieir ruiles in<br />
order to accommodate Cc'mmcnweath. tv'ade:,, We don~ t know,,<br />
Q. Are you hopeful that Britain wrill or won~ t join the<br />
Common Market?<br />
A, That depends entiroli, on thie terms. You see, the<br />
political advantages that Great Britain seeos in joining<br />
the Common Market well, they are matters for the<br />
British Govorment ' to determ. 1ne0 We -, rc not deciding<br />
th. at proble%, ThIey are,, The ecenomic consideratioils<br />
about joining the Coizqon Markiet stan.,, d in a different<br />
and -it is on those that we have been rresenting<br />
our views riots once more,) to prevent Great Bri c( ain from<br />
making her own decision thatts not our., idea at all<br />
but to secure9 th1-rough her, as good a deal-from thie<br />
countries of th1-e Six as we Can in the interests of our<br />
own export trade,, Of course, if we did not do tt~,<br />
we would be : railing in cur dUty to th . e pople of<br />
Australia, How do you interpret the weekcnd news of a deadlock<br />
between the negctinators?<br />
A, I flavor make an-, y comment on something that I read in<br />
a weekend paper, honcstly; il' wait until I hear<br />
ofcially as -to iwhIat has gone cn, Iwul o<br />
readily accept thc idea t~ hat there is a deadlock.,<br />
I think you will fl: nd th, they wi'll be talking again<br />
i~ n the course o-f* tl-e next few days., And they are<br />
bound to, Both si'des at,-c going to exh-aust thle<br />
poss2. bl. itJ. es before tht-ey aclnovrldge that they can't<br />
get anywhiere0<br />
Q Prime Minister, are you worried about Australia's<br />
unemp1 cyrueii s ituation?<br />
Al No9 thaere is more thian I 1, lculd like,, but if ycu mean<br />
by that do I regard this as being a rncssive, continuing<br />
problem. no, I don't thin]: that, Our idea is that<br />
you must got tile prosent number of peop-Le applying,<br />
re gisatered for emplocyment, substantially dovn,<br />
Everybody would agree about that. And we have some<br />
hopes7 considerable hopes, that as a result of the<br />
general economic irrprovement these niumrbers will fa-'?<br />
and fall during the cou. e ol' this year,,<br />
Theore is a noticeable drop since Do(-ewbrfs :' ecorO.,,<br />
A, 0h, yes, Quite noticeablec and. that is all the more<br />
remarkable because ze had a record intakeo schoolleavers<br />
and so en 7i Novrember, DeCember, January,<br />
The probl. em, in other ors; of finding employment was<br />
inuchi bigger than it had been on any previous occasion,<br />
and yet the imp~ rovement as you knew during the last<br />
faw months has beericiitc rernarkat-. 1. o.<br />
Q. ~ ThLere were still 93, 000 uanemployed in June doe~ s<br />
this mean the oconcmmic reco~ very mes2ures, yrou. took<br />
earlier are notvokngqut ao well. as you would<br />
like? 0 0 C0 0 00 C/' 4 </p>
<p>As It may be that we have yet to see their full result,<br />
We had discussions with a number of business ana other<br />
people to see what their impress. ions were,, I think we<br />
all agreed that the measures are working, that the state<br />
of the economy is improving, but that everybody would<br />
l. ike to see it improve more rapidly. in other words,<br />
it is going in the right direction, but we have yet to<br />
see the full effect of some of the measures that were<br />
t. ker. You want to remember that measures taken in<br />
Febxuary have not had a very long time to produce their<br />
results, Already they have produced some very interesting<br />
ones,<br />
Qo What bearing will the unemployment situation have on the<br />
new Budget?<br />
A, I don't know that I follow that question, The new<br />
Budget will state the economic policy of the Government<br />
so far as it relates to financial measures and in framing<br />
a Budget, you take into account a series of problems<br />
affecting the national economy including the necessity<br />
to improve the employment situation. It is one of the<br />
factors that is taken into account,<br />
Q. The Federal Government did ask the WoAo Government for<br />
details of the development programmes in the North-' Iest.<br />
Is this significant? Does it mean that there will be<br />
help for the North-West?<br />
Ao Look, I beg to be excused from saying anything myself,<br />
officially, about t. his matter0 The fact is that one<br />
of the Wes., Australian Ministors, Mr, Court, has just<br />
been in Canberra having discussions with our people<br />
about some of these developmental ideas and I believe<br />
they have boon making very satisfactory progress.<br />
I had a talk thi. s morning with your distinguished<br />
Premier here, Mr, Brand and Mro Brand himself seemed<br />
quite optimistic about the way these discussions were<br />
goingo I nave not been conducting them myself.<br />
Qo Why isn't your Party contesting the Batman seat in<br />
Victoria, Mr. Menzies?<br />
A, Well, now, I wonder if you would tell me why you think<br />
we should? It costs money, you know, to contest a<br />
by-election, My Party always has less money to spend<br />
than the Labor Partyo That is not very well known, but<br />
it is trueo To run a candidate for a seat that you are<br />
not going to win and which is going to be materially<br />
altered against you in the forthcoming redistribution<br />
and with no Senate vote to concern yourself with all<br />
those things didn't add up in my mind to a good case<br />
for putting up a candidate going through this form.<br />
Nor did it commend itself to the Fxecutive of the Pr. rty<br />
organisation in Victoria, whose opinion I, in fact,<br />
confirm, and they decided not to run a candidate0<br />
Qo How do you think your Party would go if there<br />
is a new election?<br />
Ae I haven't a clue.<br />
Qo Sir, would you tell me what is going to become of<br />
either Mr, Hasluck or Mr, Chaney now that the Perth and<br />
Curtin seats have been merged? o00 0C0C a/ </p>
<p>A0 I ~ don't 1: now. 1 will be very Ln, p Idnthv<br />
both of them still with mc afe th citiUt<br />
oeats have been th1rough an election~ woul. d be vey<br />
disappointed0 iBut., * Lok), d on?+. a': k me about thiose<br />
things. I am not familiar with tte boundaries bhere0<br />
I don't know what is going to happen, Nor doev<br />
anybody else at the present tinle, I would think<br />
QO The United Nations Mission to Australian New Guin~ ea<br />
was high in its praise for Autralials administration,<br />
' out what are you going to do abouat their Sugesio<br />
for an enlarged and maore represontativo Parliament2<br />
A ' dell, I think you are putcing their recommendation<br />
ipn rttymodrae way when you say that Itoght<br />
they were snying thiat there ought to bc full Parliarentary<br />
Government establish'ed almdost instant~ y, within a year<br />
or two,, Now, that 1, jst doesn'~ t make sense, quite<br />
fOrankly0We have been developing, under the cdoministration<br />
of Mr. FHasluck himself, who iaas done a wonderful<br />
job in relation to Now Guinea; we have been developing<br />
Local Governmaent. There are quito, a niudiber of 1oc&amp;. l<br />
author ities now in whicli tae indigenous inhabitants are<br />
membcrs and conduct the0ir operations. We now have<br />
them on the Lagislat1ive Council, 0 But anybody who knows<br />
anything about New Guilnea withl-ij'Vs hundreds of different<br />
languages and its area and its population many of them<br />
remote and living in a ver_-y primitive staze anybody<br />
who supposes -that you can 1hand cver self -government to<br />
that community cut of hnand has not learned the lessons<br />
of the Congo, tha-t is all I can cay0 We have a great<br />
responsibility for Now~ Guinea, and our responsibility<br />
is to bring up the standard of living and the capacity<br />
for se]. f-gove:. rurent of t, people there, and we propose<br />
to dischiarge thiat roSpOriSibility. It would be a criminal<br />
act on our part to abandon i~ t<br />
QO Do you tlihink theire is a discrepancy between the UN0<br />
Miss. Jon's p-ressure on behalf of th-e Papuans? political<br />
advanceme(-nt i~ n Australian New Guinea in view of what<br />
is going on in West New Guineali<br />
A0 Oh., well, I am not going -to discuss that.<br />
Q. ~ Well, finally M-r10 Menzies, I would like-_ to ask you this.<br />
There have been for many years people often asking the<br />
question " When will Mr. Menzies ro-tire?" Have you<br />
got any plans for retirement?.<br />
A, ~ Dear me, I have frequently [, ad plans for reti re-ment<br />
and -then something happens, that makes it imnpossible0<br />
So here 1 am, chained to the wheel8 I can throw no<br />
more lig-ht on m-y fUr t ha n tha t,<br />
Qn W'ell. I'd like to thank you fo--r coming along tonight,<br />
Mr,, rire Minister. Thank you and good night,~ </p>
