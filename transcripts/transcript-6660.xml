PRIME MINISTER<br />
E. O. E. PROOF ONLY<br />
PRIME MINISTER INTERVIEWED BY HAYDN SARGENT ON RADIO 4BC<br />
TALKBACK, BRISBANE 27/ 6/ 85.<br />
HS: Mr Hawke I understand on Monday night the members of the<br />
Centre Left faction met and decided they wanted option A<br />
which must cause you some concern?<br />
PM: I don't know, I haven't had dny such reports and I'd be<br />
eurprsed if any such decision had been taken, but anyway<br />
what I've said is that we'll go to the summit, we'll listen<br />
to what's said and as a govetrnment we'll go through the<br />
processes of coming to a ' decision which we believe will be<br />
in the best intere. sts of this country. I would think that<br />
all members of the party will play their part appropriately<br />
in that process. I don't believe they would have closed<br />
off options..<br />
HS: Are you disappointed in the lack of support for your tax<br />
proposals from the various State branches of the Labor Party?<br />
PM: Obviously one would have rather seen them being more positive<br />
and affirmative about it, that's clear, but I'm not entirely<br />
surprised because this is a debate which covers an area of<br />
considerable emotion and an area in which there have been<br />
historically hard-held positions within the Labor Party,<br />
that is Against indirect taxes, and that is a philosophically<br />
sound position if : that's all you're doing, but Paul Keating<br />
and I are no less : aware of the reasons for being against<br />
indirect taxes than anyone else in the party. It's bocause<br />
we are aware of the rerressive nature of them, that is that<br />
they cn all otlher things being equal hurt lower incomcr<br />
people uore, but . he patkae contains $ 2 billion north of<br />
compensation to c46pensate arid more than compensato, tho;; e<br />
o o/ 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
who would otherwise'suffer that that injustice. Now<br />
it's not to be expected that everyone within the party<br />
would be a) as well aware of' all the details of' what's<br />
in the package as w are, nor b) lhave had the opportunity<br />
to study the way in which the whole system has decayed<br />
and to really understand the paiadox ' that it's only in<br />
a s' 3nse by overturning that previous philosphy that you<br />
can really achieve the fundamental objectives of thd party.<br />
HS: Itseems in the past. that Bob Haw~ ke and the Labor Party<br />
have enjoyed very much the women's vote in Australia,<br />
and it seems to me that come the consumer tax the women are<br />
going to be confronted by taxation perhaps in a more<br />
startling way at the supermarklet cash regiater. Is that<br />
going to aff'ect-your political fortunes?<br />
PM., You go to a very in tresting p. oint there Haydn, it was<br />
riised very early on in the dis'cussions we were having about<br />
tax reform9 It was at a rneet'ing* at the Lodge soon af'ter<br />
the election and we were starting to get ready to prepare<br />
for the work on tax and one of' my advisors there mado the<br />
poilnt he said listen one thing you're going to have to<br />
watch is if' you go over this route you're talkinig about<br />
yo u'vo got to remember there's. still a lot of' Iustralinnhouseholds<br />
where the old man gets the pay packot ind tho<br />
lady of' the household doesn't. krnow exactly how ho 16Z73<br />
he hands out a certain amount,* and he'll have ai Lot<br />
nore in his pay packet and his, wife vill be to t:, e<br />
nupeimarket, see the higher prices and ohe'll &amp; till have " Cho<br />
same amount in her handbac, it's a scrious po . nt that s<br />
to be takcen into account io that if' the sort of option ? o<br />
talking about is brought into operation, ther&amp; l have L'.<br />
a very heavy education campaign so thnt the womon -arid nIOI<br />
just the women but I'm, particuslarly referring to you~ ro<br />
queotion -will know that. Dad crinyhas gdc,,.; oino nmo,. e<br />
dollars in the pay pocket and she should bo. getting hcr ' V O<br />
on thorn0 e 3 </p>
<p>L u S<br />
HS: Maybe that's a domestic quest. on that a Prime Minister<br />
should stay clear Of?<br />
PM: Well I'm in the happy position well happy for me that<br />
since our marriage. Hazel handles all the financial matters<br />
at any rate. It's not something I'm conscious of. But<br />
it's something that's quite serious that should be taken<br />
into account.<br />
HS: I'auppose only a m4sochist is really enthusiastic about<br />
taxes. I haven't met anybody yet who is really enthusiastic<br />
about paying tax. Do you sometimes regret that maybe<br />
you've called the tax summit, because it really is an<br />
unpopular topic it's a bit like castor oil it's got to<br />
be taken and maybe'the simplest thing would have been for<br />
the government to have met, mde a decision and said to the<br />
Australian public '" this is it."?<br />
PM: No, on the contrary the more this process goes on the happier<br />
I am about it because tax as you recognise is a touchy<br />
subject and there are probably very few, as you recognise,<br />
will touch it and it's much more sensible that we provide<br />
the opportunity for significant public discussion debate,<br />
and then at the. sutmit be in a position as a government<br />
to listen to the views of widely-representative organisations<br />
The great tragedy of the present time, the reason why tax<br />
reform is on the a enda in 1985 is because for 30 out of the<br />
last 35 years our conservative opponents have been in charge<br />
of this country and the present tax system is their tax<br />
system and it's precisely because they did what you were<br />
saying get an idea in their minds, bring it in, no discussic<br />
no consultation, except what vome of their privileged friends<br />
presumably said you had the emergence of a system which is<br />
-totally against th; interests of ordinary Australians, Mow<br />
it's much more sensible that we should say all right we've<br />
inherited this mess from you people who acted in that way,<br />
who created a system in which more and more of a burden is<br />
imposed upon the ordinary wage and salary earners of this<br />
country, the ordinary people.' ' We're going to bring an end<br />
to that, we're going to say "' here it is" we're going to cxpose<br />
the inaaquecies of' the present system and go to the people aTc<br />
A t w gjino to iet </p>
<p>betrsystem, let's biear what* You've got to say. That's<br />
an infinitely. bette#: way of' conducting the affairs of' this<br />
country than the aiternative because You look at the<br />
alternative you see; what's it'* s produced,<br />
HS: It seems to me that the key jo'b'foir you as Prime Minister<br />
and for Mr Keating : as Tre'asurer is to sell to rank and rile<br />
Australians, not necessarily ' to the influential of Australia,<br />
this isaue Of Privilege. Some people enjoy Privilege<br />
tix-free cars, chaL~ feur-driven cars, entertainment expenses,<br />
travel allowance -". and other don't enjoy those Privileges.<br />
It seems to me that's one of you-r'* key selling..<br />
PM: It08 one or the jobs, it's one of them. I think you really<br />
can see by looking at the overall at . atistics you go back<br />
years ago to 1953-54 then yoU had the situation where one<br />
Per cent, Just one'per cent of people in full-time employment,<br />
paid a marginal rate. of 460v now that figure is just under<br />
4.6 per cent 39 per cent are paying almost halt of that<br />
extra dollar in tai, and thatt's the sort of' clearest indicatic<br />
of' what we're talking about. You~' re getting this growing<br />
an~ d growing pressure and burden of tax on the lower and<br />
ordinary income people Of Australia because the more privileGc<br />
are avoiding their tax altogether, and that's the aggregate<br />
figure of' it and it-' s only happening because the share of ta.-I<br />
that Should be Coming from areas with greater caipacity to<br />
pay has been diminished,<br />
HS; Final question -Comning back to this meeting Of the Centro<br />
Left on Monday night, at which I understand Senatolr Button<br />
was present, and l understand he's one of' your closest<br />
advisors and conridente, don't you foel that som~ e of your<br />
Ministers are virtually pulling * the rug out frcti under you?<br />
P: NIdon't think ta. We as a Cabinet had to take thioi<br />
Process through and we did, b'ut it was. ' Cknowledgad thintw<br />
D~ me Ministers had reservations or concornS about, not<br />
principle of the Opproa'ch, I Ithink rieght ito ; Vnyc<br />
as to whether all the elceentes of compensation and ai.*~<br />
about Inflation rate, whether* they uere exactly. r~ ih, : C<br />
toey eanted to be 6ble to do-' Inore t~ orh on that, and I / C; </p>
<p>that but the government had the' responsibility of getting<br />
what it thought was ; the best position and then going out'<br />
and selling that. Wa I've 6s ai d from the very beginnin* 9<br />
during the election:: campaign ar~ d . right through and I say now<br />
and I'll be saying at the summi tka we accept the responsibility<br />
of doing two things of analysing the existing system<br />
showing its inadequecies and thaithtere must be changes,<br />
and secondly-saying here are ways in which we believe the*<br />
system can be improled and Including saying it looks to ' us<br />
as though this i-s the best way of going, option C. Now we<br />
will be listening very c losely at the summit and if it emerges<br />
that there are qualifications or better ways of doing it, then<br />
I'vze got a n open mind about that: and so has Mr K~ eating. We<br />
strongly believe, on the eviden* ce Available to us at this<br />
point, this is the Preferred way of going and we're going to<br />
listen.<br />
HS: Let's take some calls.<br />
PETER: My question, the first part of ; m y question i s, when are you<br />
going to honour you'r 1983 election promise of reducing the<br />
price of petrol at : 30 a litre?<br />
PM: The government's position has ' been that it will proceed alonrg<br />
the path of'the import parity * pricing policy we've done that<br />
and whore that policy has inv~ lved decreases well that's<br />
what's happened; where it's involved increases, oithor bocam.,<br />
of what's happened * to the market prices, the Arab lieht(?) oi:*<br />
dqpreciation in the Australian dollar, wetve' 6one that. lUp<br />
to the last meeting tie had last week when vie decided uo v3ou?. d<br />
not merely take account of what was happening in the ppice oV<br />
Arab light ? 1the.* official priceO but that we'd also look ati<br />
spot prices as well, and the ' e~ ult of that has been tilat<br />
there will be a reudction 0.3. f a litre in the price oT petro<br />
tUo've got to operate on the basis of combination of tryi&amp; ng<br />
to keep the price of petrol a's lOW as possibloe and cn: so:<br />
vith the fact that it's a scarce and limi~ ted ronource and o<br />
got to 3ce that it: Os thoreforea pi~ ic6d at anll<br />
economic pricc, 0 : 1 would Yzo6iid you that coiap \ ed t.<br />
rest of the world Australians. still get their :&amp; ctrol veryrv<br />
Very eheaply-Indecyd. 06 </p>
<p>PETER: I understand:. petrol's going to'. go up again at the tax summit<br />
by 121 per cent, 1i that right?<br />
PH: What we've said in: the White Paper is this -under the<br />
Preferred option C, then you would want if you could to<br />
differentiate between the business'imputof fuel and it's<br />
Ube for private consumption so'that you wouldn't be taxing<br />
It as a business imput; but at this stage it looks as though<br />
the differen'tiation bvtween the business 1. mput and private<br />
consumption-i3 rath~ er difficult to take, and so it has been<br />
designated'as what'! s called a.. restricted good and it would<br />
be subject to the consumption tax so you're right but if<br />
the preferred option C in its.' present form were to be adopted,<br />
then there would be'an increase in'the price of petrol, but<br />
itsno good when you're taJling about tax reform just looking<br />
at one element. it's no a'ood' saying but the price of petrol<br />
will go up, ' or theprice of Something else will go up, you've<br />
got to ask yourself will you bave more in your pay packet<br />
than before*, and more in fact * than will be necessary to covet,<br />
the increase In the prices yop'll be confronted iiith by<br />
movements in goods. subject to, the broad-baged consumption ta,,<br />
And the answer is that. you'lll have more in your pay packet,<br />
so -that in net t " erins you'll b6 ete orff,<br />
HS: We'll take a second1 caller.<br />
CLR: Regarding you're ' alegation against Sir Joh, Mr Hawkeabout<br />
him being an incomj~ etent leadefr., what grounds did you base<br />
thi* on?<br />
PM^: I'Im glad you asked me that question. I think you'll a~ i-oo<br />
that Sir Joh, more than any other political figure in Austra-. 1<br />
in recent years ha's been making* allegations about othar<br />
partics and saying that he is** the best man and his party's<br />
the best to govern*, and he ma'kes allegations a~ ainst other,<br />
p arties in thin State -not juat the Labor Party, but the<br />
Liberal Party, and Ve makes thiep-against federal ( I~ rvcn.<br />
and so we start fr. om the flrst step, therefore v thct<br />
beilevas thnt the tian in charg. je and tho party lillat -pc,<br />
dotormines In one \-jay or another the quality of govcr-nuant<br />
t~ he level of' econo' mic perfborm~ ance. So, there~ oro1the o </p>
<p>step is to say very well if that's r ight let's look at the<br />
level of' economic performance . in Queensland and compare it<br />
with the other States and tha t's what I did, and the sorts<br />
of things that people will make judgments about in this area<br />
i6 what's happening to employment, unemployment, prices and<br />
things like that, so let's ha've a look at a few of' those<br />
things by which you contest Sir : Job's theory, not mine that<br />
I'm talking about now,, his theory that it's the quality of<br />
tne leadership and: the party ' pf'the leadership that determines<br />
the quality of economic performanc. Let's look at<br />
unemployment the-fact is that the unemployment rate in<br />
Queensland is the worst in Aup'tralia. The Australian average<br />
is 8.4 per cent, here in Queensland it's 9.9 per cent.<br />
Epaployment in the test of Aus'tralia has been rising, here it's<br />
falling; inflation in! the yea'r to the March quarter for<br />
Australia as a whole 4.4 per bent* Queensland .4DB per cent;<br />
let's look at the reoistratiobs of new motor vehicles which<br />
. is always regardedl as a test of how an'economy if moving,<br />
for Australia as a whole new : Potor vehicle registrationa,<br />
that's over the past year, halve gone up by 18.3 per cent,<br />
in Queensland only 10.9 per cent. Another very impor'tant<br />
area of' the level of economic activity how an economy's<br />
going Is what's happening in the housing industry, Here in<br />
Queensland an appalling perfo -rmance compared with the<br />
A'ustralian. average:. If you look'at the last I-larch qua rter,<br />
the most recent figures, for" Australia as a whole an licrease<br />
of 0.9 per cent in, dwellings approved; in Queen. 3land a<br />
decline of 19.8 per cent. So if you look at all th~ be thin~ l,<br />
all these critical. indicators Queensland is doing woro2e than<br />
all the other States. Look at the question of industrial<br />
dispute, Sir Joh that this is ve.' y important, urell how is it<br />
that for the rest of Australla we have a situation where tunc ei<br />
the policies basically that we've'been followin-and xihich<br />
have been reflected in all the* other States, you have industr:<br />
disputation at almost a 17 year historically low point in<br />
Queensland ' with ii'duatrial disputes going throuGh the' P00f<br />
So if you take the Premior's * own test that it's 1cnderobip)<br />
n and the policies 6f that leader and his party That coirnt<br />
daez'rino the ley~ l of econiouic perforciacilc,, tbon<br />
worSt in Australia, andit's ot ziurprisinig becc~ tzSe he Coocu<br />
regard the task of leadership as trying to rigtbo 0 1 </p>
<p>-8<br />
together, his concept of leadership is to try and tear the<br />
community apart set group against group and it's no<br />
wonder, therefore,' that the great people of' Queensland,<br />
I ean you've got A great State*-you've got the resources<br />
here in this Statel which would be the envy of' many other<br />
States, you've got: great resources, you've got a great.<br />
population, the trOuble I~ s thAt you've got the worst leader,<br />
and in the result the very fine people' and the fine resources<br />
ot this State are being made to turn . in a worst performance.<br />
There's only one thing to do . and that's well, fairly<br />
obvious I woculd th~ nk.<br />
CALLER: The 12J per cent tax that you~ lre going to put on meat, milk<br />
( KEVIN) and groceries -how is the unepmployed going to be given extra<br />
money to balance that?<br />
PM: Very simply the Social Security payments will be increased<br />
-by more than the increases in prices that will result, What<br />
you've got to understand is tha't while what's being talked<br />
about is a 12L' per cent increase in-&amp; consumption taxa<br />
consumption tax pt a 12? 1 pe'r cent rate the impact on the<br />
CPI is 6J. per cent because that' 12?! percent is compensated<br />
by removals of pri'ces associated with the existingiwholesale<br />
and sales tax, that goes, and, tbere are adjustments in certal<br />
excise areas, so that-the nett result is 61! per cent, Now:<br />
the payment of' unemployment benefits and other, Social Socurit<br />
payments will be increased by significantly more than tho<br />
amount necessary simply to, co ver the per cent increase in<br />
prices.<br />
CALLER ( ERIC) I have a small but'cher's -Ahop* and a couple of restaurants,.<br />
Under the new tax scheme th~ e* tax for restaurants and they<br />
in turn will charg~ e it again , to the public, ion't this doubl(<br />
. taxing?<br />
F~ M: Well in any free enterprise Soc'iety here you~ ve got the<br />
situation, if I underatand-ydur* question rightlys whcro<br />
enterprises may tr'y and cover , theldoelves by passing on t<br />
to consumers, but -in the w; hole assumptions that valve rade<br />
in our approach hore, I would. not assume that where tho tax<br />
I </p>
<p>Is met by the enterprise that'he'si not going to pass it on,<br />
that's the whole reason why you get your calculation of the<br />
per cent increape in the OT~ th at we're talking about,<br />
and what we are saying is, that ina the package as a whole<br />
the people who are going to be coming into your shop or going<br />
into your restauratits, are in fact going to have very much<br />
more money -in their pocket than they otherwise would have.<br />
I do try anidiplead with you, tric, not just to pick out one<br />
part of' the package and say, there is the whole'explanation<br />
of the wholeithing. I mean it's absolutely no good saying<br />
a person's going t0o be confropted with somewhat higher prices,<br />
ir you don't'at the same time : utderstand that they're going to<br />
have significantly: more in th'eir pockets, and more in their<br />
poDckets * than the inicrease in the * prices that are going to be<br />
operating, so that . there's no reason why the people that are<br />
your customers are , not going to be at bast as well able<br />
into the future to'come and buy the things that they have been<br />
accustomed to buying as they were in the past.<br />
Yes, but I still think it's a* sort of double-taxing. I mean<br />
they're going to be copping it from both of' us really.<br />
The situation is the people are going to be paying a tax, on<br />
goods and services* as a resuJ~ t of a consumption taxr, th; Et's<br />
t . rue. But that assumes that* alt the present time your<br />
customers aren't af'fected by the tax system -the fact is that<br />
they are, because what they ha ve got available to thera to spcmp<br />
on goods and services is there as a result of how much tax tnhz<br />
pay. Let me put 6 simple ex Iample -let's say they'rc g-ettin3<br />
6,100 a-week that's your pay an d that the tax is 650 on thatp<br />
that loaves you $ 5b to spend on goods and services. llow7th , A<br />
that you've got to spend * is a result of tax, it's thc! levc3<br />
of direct income taLx operating on your pay determining the<br />
aMount of goods and services you can buy. So tax now currc-.--<br />
determines peoples capacity to, buy goods and services. Thc,<br />
buy with their afteor-tax income. Now if we reduced t h t tt,<br />
on the $ 100 sign: ficantly, ) lct's say it comes down to<br />
t'h-Nt means thoy~ vo thngot 670 to opend on eore6,-and<br />
ve irapose som~ e' tax on thoss jgoodt and sorvizcJ 01,<br />
are still being of fected by t axc on the amount goods n<br />
services they can : buy, but the ' whole package vill men t) P<br />
ERIC: PM: </p>
<p>the increase in the price of goods and services associated<br />
with the consumption tax will have a lesser effect than the<br />
reduction on their direct taxes. So in the example I've<br />
given the $ 70 they've got to spend on goods and services<br />
the prices of' which will go up by 6J per cent, will still<br />
leave them better off'. In other words don't let's operate<br />
ih our discussion on this new proposal as though it's only<br />
with the introduction of a consuimption tax that the capacity<br />
of people to buy goods and services has been affected. It's<br />
being affected now, but the terrible thing is that the capacity<br />
of the ordinary waf'e and salary . earners to buy your goods and<br />
services is progressively being reduced because a greater and<br />
greater tax burden-is being imposed upon them and in the<br />
overall package that's being ' proposed by us you will find<br />
I'm sure we'll be ' proved righ t, that the comnhunity as a whole<br />
will be better placed and there will be a fairer distribution<br />
of capacity to buy goods and services.<br />
11: Prime Minister, just a point 6n that consumer tax4,, how many<br />
times will it be applied? The restaurant meal is probably<br />
a good illustratio6. Will it be applied when the farmcr<br />
sells his beef, wiil it be apolied when the wholesale slaughte<br />
yards sells the cut meat or carcase to the butcher?<br />
PM: Au I said it's a broad-based consumption tax -you see u; hat<br />
the alternativcu we were Laced'with the concept VAT ich<br />
is the one that's been adopted In * many countriez of' Europo,<br />
or the broad-basedconsumption tax. This was lco! hed at and<br />
there were certain arguments in favour of a VAT but the Inafl<br />
argument basically against it is that you have a imuch i~ iore<br />
complicatod mechanism and many more collection noWnS, knnd<br />
it was suggested pr'obably the opportunity of' evcsion rncy be<br />
greater, and certai5nly the administrative costs would be.<br />
grt.' ater and you would be imposing, administrative burdens<br />
on more points in the. communi ty. So this i. 5 at tho<br />
point,<br />
1S: So when tho butchop" sells tho. meat to 11-he restv ñ a'nit<br />
no tax at th at poifit; but When the. restaurant s'lsthe<br />
Meal? 0 0 0 l I </p>
<p>PM; 1i~ depends how the'restaurantpur does his purchas ing. If<br />
he just goes'along to the but~ her shop yes he'd pay.<br />
CALLER: I'd like to talk about tax on the everyday commodities.<br />
Ites been talked about that things like washing machines/ cars<br />
will be cheaper. If we have to tlighten our belt we'll<br />
just have to make ao with~ tho64 items a little longer<br />
instead of trading them in and getting the latest model.<br />
You don't buy thosO every day of' tbe week. But, we have<br />
ti) buy food so we ' can eat and live. If cars and washing<br />
machines can be reduced you mnust h ave been collecting a<br />
pr-etty big rfevenue. out of them.. In my view the rich will<br />
benefit from the reductions because they're the ones who<br />
trade-in their cars every couple of years, as do you people<br />
in the goverlnment. But if the petrol goes up we won't be<br />
able to afford a car. What's you're honest view on those<br />
things.<br />
P14: You don't have to, with respect, use the adjective what is<br />
my honest view, because all my views are honest M* adam and<br />
1I'm not very keen on reintroduction of the adjective, but<br />
let's go to the facts. You dck out cars. At the raorient,<br />
under tho wholesale tax system wihich is full of anomalion,<br />
it's not only card, it covers* TVs,, radios, soaps and detorgenM<br />
pet food, soft drinks, insecticides, toys, toilet papor,<br />
watcher, shavers, cosmetics, toiletries, pens and handbargs.<br />
I mean you've got ' this whole range of goods, many of which<br />
you use, where ther~ e is an existing wholesale tax. Now<br />
with the abolition of the who'leqale sales ta* i thon the prices<br />
o f those goods obv iously come down and that.' s why In total<br />
where you're talking about a I2 per cent broadly bascd<br />
consumption tax the overall effect will be only 61 per cont.<br />
You talk about the' impact on. lo wer income people. Theo e<br />
o f my public life,: In the tralde. union movement, in the Laboup'<br />
Party and now in government, : has been a concern to try and<br />
ensure that the lower-incom) " people of this country got a<br />
deal. I mean that' what rn whole life has been about 2nd I<br />
not going to Suddenly when I come to tax reform say, oh no<br />
the principlea that have GL Iod ri all of' m! y lir,-, Are<br />
egoing to f ly out the window0 Because we knot? that 3S -Vou<br />

pooror people uou), d be helped, is tiy woc've got Ca tOtal </p>
<p>S12<br />
package. Now that package involves $ 2 billion-worth of'<br />
compensation so that people ip the lower-income level who<br />
depend upon social security benefits'will get those benefits<br />
increased not justby the 6&amp; per cdent but by more. Let me<br />
give an example for a single ' pensioner what you would need<br />
to cover the increase in prices associated with the broadbased<br />
consumption tax would bb a.$ 6 a week increase, welt<br />
we're pronosing $ 9a week i tc ' ease and so on through the whole<br />
range of social security benet'its. The level of people who<br />
are in employment, the proposed cuts in direct tax will be<br />
very very much greater. I J -ust ask you to think about this<br />
situation and if you are afrald that the bringing in of this<br />
consumption tax is going to be unfair in that it will be,, as<br />
Vt1e economists say: regressive, that is it will hurt more down<br />
the bottow and help the people at the top, the great trAgedy<br />
of which you ought to be aw-are and the people of Australia<br />
ought to be aware, is that at this, time the most regresnive<br />
feature of' the tax system is* that you're paying tax but that<br />
the people who can afford to pay tax are not. The most<br />
regressive feature of any tax' system is that people avoid tax<br />
they don't pay, and what that's meant is you,. ald tons of<br />
thousands of' people like you' under 30 years of' governmont of'<br />
our conservative opponents, mopre and more tax has been'pi bj<br />
you and no tax has, been paid * by the wealthy and the privilege.<br />
So what we're, about in this wbole approach is Sradually'<br />
relieve the burden upon people such as yourself, so that in<br />
relative terms we're going to , have much greater fairnez33 in<br />
the system. ItIs: totally un fair that billions and billions<br />
of dollars have no-tobeen paid in tax by the rich and the<br />
privileged and the' wealthy. Not by people like you because<br />
you can't afford a rich tax accountant or a smart ta,. r law~ yer<br />
to tell you how to got out of' paying tax you pay your tax,<br />
And what we're about is trying to remedy the whole system, vo<br />
that you will pay less, that ~ rou're ; capacity to consume will<br />
increased and the rlich and the privileged in the commiuni. ty ii:<br />
at long last start. to pay the ir f'air share.<br />

th : e incomes for all those Australians, and I'm talking about<br />
those below the pove rty line, obigte bv h oet<br />
line, and I'm not forgetting that yesterday the Treasurer,<br />
paul Keating, said : the average ed . an income wage is $ 19t500<br />
ayear and could I -suggest that aletthporyline<br />
today would be equal'to a third of that which is equal to<br />
$ 6., 500 a year. And don't forg~ b in a free enterprise syntem<br />
there is no limit on the profi~ ts and prices of people in that<br />
free enterprise system.<br />
We will, of course, .' be increasjing social security benefits<br />
by an amount more than is necessary to compensate for the<br />
increase in prices ' associated : with a broadly-based consumption<br />
tax, if that's the route the Sovernment finally goes, so<br />
that people in that direct sen~ se will be more than compensated<br />
As. ? hesuggestion of the lifting of the tax-free threshold'<br />
aso from $ 4595 up to $ 6250 would mean that ab such a neW<br />
tax scale, if tbat were implemented., thatwould increase'the<br />
amount of money that you would be able to earn would ' be<br />
before you had to pay any tax . at all, would rise from 08<br />
a week to $ 120 a weekc. Itto quite clear, and I'd be misaleadil,<br />
you if I. were to say that in one fell swoop * associated with<br />
tax -reform we were -able to make the giant jump in paymonts<br />
to got above the calculated poverty line that you refor to,<br />
but I think the imoortant poipt, to understand is that until<br />
tie have a tax system in w-hich everyone is payine ta-p with thc<br />
capacity to pay thdt is-and not avoiding it -andl'si<br />
over the years billions of dollars, then neither ny goovn-:;,..<br />

in. our writte'n submiission t o the tax summit, the third<br />
being Income-splitting. The ' increase in spouse rebate<br />
merely partly addrebses the inequity in between the<br />
sinigle income earne'r and the dual income earner.<br />
No twithstanding all: this and the fact that we represent,<br />
the Australian Family Association represent's the largest<br />
single interest group in Austral ia, we were not invited<br />
to the tax summit. Prime Mia ister could you comment?<br />
PM: May I firstly say thank you for your acknowlegorueht of<br />
some of the things * we have don e in meeting the objectives<br />
that you regard as-appropriate. Secondly as to the point<br />
you make about the unit for taxation in the difñ' orence in<br />
tax impost broadl~ y what you:. are saying is correct we are<br />
aware of those arguments and that is a mnatter discussed in<br />
the white paper and will certdinly be discussed at the &amp; ummit.<br />
Thirdly as to actual attendance at the summit, we were raced<br />
with a situation of hundreds of organisations and individuals<br />
Who wanted to be there and in drawing up the invitation list<br />
we tried to do the best job we could, knowing that some would<br />
be disappointed. I can only say this the submi~ ssion3 tbat<br />
your ausociation hds put in are included within the docuincntat<br />
which will be available to the participants at the summit and<br />
I think a lot of people are making arrangements of' have<br />
material available there for distribution to parbicipc~ ts &amp; n,<br />

concern at all that the thrust of your argument -, o<br />
before the people who will be' at the suiumit,, bo~ h Z h<br />
being raised in the white pap or itself 1 by the avib ity<br />

<p>PM: 1can assure you that one of the questions that has been<br />
considered, not only in this c ou n t. ry elsewhere, is the<br />
possibility of' the sort of' thi. ng that you're talking about,<br />
t9 have differential rates, but the unanimous advice that<br />
we've received in our consideration of' this tax reform has<br />
be4en both from other countries and from international experts,<br />
that once you start having differential rates that you are<br />
then pretty much on a disaster path to the possibilities for<br />
avoidance and evasion, the administrative complexities are<br />
increased enormously plus the'fact you immediately then set up<br />
the situation where all governments are continuously subjected<br />
to pressures saying there ought to be this exemption or that<br />
oxemption or this gr that lesber rate, which would mean you<br />
would have a repetition of what you've got now in the wholosal<br />
tax area where you have the absurdity that confectionary like<br />
Kit Iat on the one'hand and chocolate biscuits which are<br />
virtually the same thing one is taxed and the other is't<br />
Because of' the arguments agaifist having a differential rate<br />
or exemptions of the sort that I've put to you, welve naverthc<br />
loss wanted to try and make sure that what we do by w-ay of<br />
compensation more than covers the best calculations of what<br />
the increased cost-to you woul. d be. Very detail. ed work has<br />
been done to try aold get a picture of the consum. ption pattern<br />
ot poorer people aftd then to load, the figuring in such a way<br />
that means, according to our best estimates, the amount of<br />
additional money that we'll be giving to you and others on<br />
social security payments, that the amount of in ; ieso you'll.<br />
get will be miore than the increase in the price of goods<br />
with which you will be confronted. Let me repont tho examplo<br />
I gave with regard to the pensions -in regarld to the snl<br />
pension you'd need IW6 a week i,' ncrease in the pension to covclthe<br />
increase in the cost of' things the ponsionep would be<br />
faced with0 So we're not going to make it $ 6 a vecic we're<br />
going to make it And that sort of approach is also<br />
being followed throughout the, area of social uelfaro yLt.<br />
An important part of the summi. ill be to enable the<br />
repreoentatives of the welf'are community to ge thoupli r<br />

<p>-16-<br />
undertaking that one part of the. proceedings that I'll be<br />
listening to most closely will be this area that you're<br />
talking about. Because I1' lneed to be absolutely sure*<br />
in my mind that people who do'depenid on social welfare<br />
payments are going'to be at lcast as well off after the<br />
reform as they wer6~ before I'give you that undertaking.<br />
[ IS: Just one final ques õ tion -if ' after you've met in consultation<br />
with so many organisations and so many different pressure<br />
groups, I have a feeling that thiere won't be the simple<br />
consensus at the end of this'Conference that there was<br />
perhaps at the endof the Accord, but that in fact it will<br />
still be left to ypu to bear inmind their recommendations<br />
and their opinions: and their preferences., but when it comes<br />
down to the crunch it's you anid Mr [( eating who will have to<br />
make the final dectsions.<br />
PM4: I've never thought that we'd be able to get consensus at thi3<br />
slimmit bocause in the nature of the thing a suarait. on taxatio<br />
is differont to the sort of summit we had in 1983. Rather<br />
live hoped and I still expect' that at the summit we'll have<br />
the opportunity of hearing di rectly from a wide range of<br />
people in the community what they think and what their<br />
proferred approaches are and ' it may be that out of the proces<br />
wo would also see that, some ot' the work that welve done<br />
needs some qualification to take account of particular"<br />
views we regard as relevant, Take the example of the wolfavc)<br />
area that we've just been talking about. I'mean if It could<br />
be shot-n that some* of the assumptions that we made in tho<br />
calculations which vie're now confident that those people will<br />
6e more than composated, if we. were shot-n there was some<br />
questionmark about those, then we'd need to re-think thzt, ank<br />
if it emerged that there vfasn It nearly enough support for<br />
some of the concepts, w-ell we'd have to take that into accounl<br />
Bit you're quite r ight in the ense that ultimately iwel-' O<br />
the government and we're going to havc to mako the doccizion<br />
And that's the uay it's always been the it s-houl d ie0<br />
Dut I bQJ3iovo that as a result of pr~ oece c~ sO o0 t&gt; 6.<br />
public debate and ' thc-n at the summit, I thinkc t~ o Bhculd be<br />
a0nb otter position to be more likely to Calco the bcest<br />
