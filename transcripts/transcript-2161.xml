DRILLING ON THE BARRIER REEF<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton<br />
The Pri me Minister, Mr. John Gorton, said that<br />
he was very pleased indeed to receive the information from Ampol<br />
Exploration that they were not proceeding with their intention of<br />
drilling on the Barrier Reef pending a thorough examination of the<br />
question of whether any damage might occur.<br />
He stated his belief that the Barrier Reef was of<br />
such importance to Australia and to world science that it was<br />
essential that there should be not the slightest chance of any<br />
damage occurring from such drilling ard congratulated Ampol<br />
Exploration on their nationally responsible attitude.<br />
