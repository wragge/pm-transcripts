COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA<br />
SPEECH 23AUG1967<br />
BY<br />
The Rt Hon. HAROLD HOLT, M. P.,<br />
ON<br />
INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS<br />
[ From the ' Parliamentary Debates', 17 August 1967]<br />
Mr HAROLD HOLT ( Higgins-Prime<br />
Minister) [ 8.20]--This debate was initiated<br />
by the Minister for External Affairs ( Mr<br />
Hasluck) who, I think it will be agreed by<br />
all sections of the House, gave to this<br />
chamber one of the most thoughtful,<br />
informative, articulate and valuable statements<br />
on the foreign affairs of this country<br />
that has ever been presented to the chamber.<br />
It is to me deplorable that it was<br />
followed by such an incredible speech from<br />
the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam).<br />
I use the term ' incredible' in two senses.<br />
It was incredible in the sense that anybody<br />
who had any knowledge of the facts about<br />
which the Leader of the Opposition spoke<br />
could place no validity on the comments<br />
which he made in relation to those facts.<br />
It was also incredible in the sense that a<br />
man holding himself out to be the leader<br />
of an alternative government should have<br />
such a disregard for the facts and make<br />
such reckless and loose use of them as he<br />
did during the debate. I shall give some<br />
instances of that as I proceed.<br />
The Leader of the Opposition has put to<br />
the House what purports to be the views<br />
of the Australian Labor Party on a variety<br />
of important issues. I say ' purports' because<br />
nobody in this country can be sure of the<br />
views of the Australian Labor Party, taken<br />
as a whole. I shall deal with that, too, in<br />
a little more detail as I go along. He holds<br />
himself and his colleagues out as the source<br />
of an alternative government for this<br />
country. 11671/ 67 There is, of course, a very direct link<br />
between the welfare, security and economicprogress<br />
of a nation and the Government<br />
that leads it. So it becomes an obligation,<br />
of citizenship in a democratic society to<br />
examine closely the policies offered by thosewho<br />
aspire to national leadership. And there<br />
is an obligation on the part of the public<br />
and of the Press of Australia to bring the<br />
same strong searchlight of scrutiny to thepolicies<br />
of the Australian Labor Party<br />
which they direct so penetratingly and persistently<br />
to the policies of the present<br />
Government. I stress that because there has been for<br />
so long a disposition on the part of some'<br />
sections of the Press and some members<br />
of the public to say: ' There is no effective-<br />
Opposition, so we are the Opposition.' If<br />
they are going -to alter that role and look<br />
to honourable members opposite led by thepresent<br />
Leader of the Opposition as an,<br />
alternative government, then they have a<br />
responsibility to probe as closely as they<br />
would the policies of this Government what<br />
is put forward by honourable gentlemen'<br />
opposite. It is not easy to pin down in any precise<br />
form the policies offered by the Australian<br />
Labor Party under its present leadership,<br />
either on foreign affairs or on domestic<br />
affairs. In this respect, the Leader of the'<br />
Opposition has already revealed himself as<br />
something of a political chameleon. At: </p>
<p>times, we find him assuming the guise of<br />
a Christian crusader charging down against<br />
the infidels of the Victorian executive of<br />
the Australian Labor Party. But when he<br />
speaks to an audience consisting predominantly<br />
of Liberal sympathisers, as when<br />
he talked to the Junior Chamber of Commerce<br />
in Victoria the other day, we find<br />
him uttering honeyed words about the<br />
Socialist objective, an objective, incidentally,<br />
to -the implementation of which he has<br />
pledged himself.<br />
Mr Uren-I rise to order. This is a discussion<br />
of a statement delivered by the<br />
Minister for External Affairs. When discussing<br />
a previous statement made by the<br />
Minister for External Affairs I was called<br />
to order by the Chair for not speaking to<br />
the statement. My point now is that on this<br />
occasion the Prime Minister is not speaking<br />
to the statement delivered by the Minister<br />
for External Affairs.<br />
Mr SPEAKER-Order! There is no substance<br />
in the point raised by the honourable<br />
member. Mr HAROLD HOLT-I can understand<br />
the concern of honourable gentlemen opposite<br />
at any analysis which challenges the<br />
credibility of their spokesman. But, Sir,<br />
this is tremendously relevant to the policies<br />
of an alternative government in Australia.<br />
Unless there can be faith -and trust in the<br />
policies of . those who offer themselves as an<br />
alternative government, then the country is<br />
put at peril if those people take over the<br />
Government of the country. I want to question<br />
tonight whether honourable gentleman<br />
opposite have a valid claim to govern this<br />
country. I repeat that the Leader of the Opposition<br />
is committed to the implementation of this<br />
policy. But at times he is to be found tilting,<br />
like Don Quixote against imaginary Liberal<br />
windmills. I can quote instance after<br />
instance of that. Many of them occurred<br />
during the recent Corio campaign. On that<br />
occasion he alleged that I had made some<br />
sort of deal with the former member for<br />
Corio ( Mr Opperman) before the last general<br />
election. That was a completely false<br />
allegation which I shall deal with in more<br />
detail later. He also made the false allegation<br />
that by advocating a continuance of the<br />
bombing of North Vietnam I was seriously embarrassing the American Administration.<br />
Then ' he made the completely false<br />
allegation that I had openly advocated an<br />
extension of the formal hours of working in<br />
Australia. Not only was that allegation<br />
made by the Leader of the Opposition but<br />
it was repeated by the newly elected member<br />
for Corio ( Mr Scholes). Yet he quoted<br />
from a Press release of mine that clearly<br />
indicated ' that I had specifically said in<br />
answer to a question on this matter that I<br />
was not advocating a longer working week<br />
in that sense.<br />
As I have said, these are just imaginary<br />
Liberal windmills that the honourable gentleman<br />
has created for himself. But then, after<br />
emerging from the throes of his Federal<br />
Executive discussions, he publicly expounds,<br />
admittedly not very enthusiastically, policy<br />
decisions that have taken him significant<br />
strides leftwards. He is not so much a man<br />
for all seasons as a man for all policies. The<br />
essence of his approach is: If you want it I<br />
have got it. What the honourable gentleman<br />
will discover as ' he proceeds in this course<br />
of leadership is that what he has said on<br />
earlier occasions will come up to haunt him<br />
in ithe statements which he will be making<br />
thereafter. Some of these allegations I shall document<br />
as I proceed. I apologise in advance<br />
to the House for having to quote so extensively<br />
in what remains for me to say. But<br />
When you have loose and reckless assertions<br />
I believe the most effective answer is a carefully<br />
documented reply on the facts as they<br />
can be presented.<br />
Let me return now to one or two of the<br />
matters to which I have referred. I spoke<br />
of his attack on the Victorian Executive.<br />
This is significant because of the bearing it<br />
has on the foreign policies which were subsequently<br />
produced. Speaking to the Victorian<br />
Labor Party conference on 9th June,<br />
the Leader of ' the Opposition said:<br />
The Victorian Executive included an influential<br />
handful of men who had flouted ALP policy<br />
on unity tickets, organised or led political strikes<br />
in defiance of the ACTU, disregarded and repudiated,<br />
party and ACTU policy on the manning<br />
of ships to Vietnam--<br />
Mr Hayden-I rise to a point of order.<br />
Mr Uren-I rise to a point of order.<br />
Mr SPEAKER-Order! </p>
<p>Mr HAROLD HOLT-Cannot honourable<br />
members opposite take it? We gave<br />
the. Leader of the Opposition unlimited<br />
time. Mr SPEAKER-Order! The House will<br />
come to order. The honourable member<br />
for Oxley has taken a point of order.<br />
Mr Hayden-Mr Speaker, I direct<br />
attention to the inconsistency with which<br />
the rules of the House are being applied.<br />
Mr SPEAKER--Order! The honourable<br />
member will withdraw that remark. He is<br />
reflecting on the Chair.<br />
Mr Uren-I too rise to a point of order.<br />
The matter before the House is the statement<br />
that was made by the Minister for<br />
External Affairs. The Prime Minister is not<br />
discussing that statement.<br />
Mr SPEAKER--Orderl There is no substance<br />
in the point of order. The honourable<br />
member will resume his seat.<br />
Mr Bryant-Mr Speaker, I take a point<br />
of order. At an earlier hour the Leader of<br />
the House moved that standing orders be<br />
suspended so that the Prime Minister could<br />
speak without limitation of time on the<br />
subject before the House. As a matter of<br />
courtesy, no opposition came from this side<br />
of the House.<br />
Mr SPEAKER-Orderl The honourable<br />
member for Wills cannot debate . the matter.<br />
What is the point of order?<br />
Mr Bryant-My point of order is that<br />
the Prime Minister is trespassing upon the<br />
decision of the House.<br />
Mr SPEAKER--Order! The point of<br />
order is without substance.<br />
Mr HAROLD HOLT-This has a wide<br />
bearing on the foreign policy decisions<br />
which emerged from the Labor Party's<br />
Federal Conference in Adelaide. The comments<br />
of the Leader of the Opposition<br />
from which I am quoting go on to show<br />
that these men whom he now condemns<br />
could be in a position to exercise influence<br />
on the policies of the Australian Labor Party<br />
at the forthcoming conference. Let fne proceed<br />
with the quotation:<br />
It is disgraceful that these men should be on the<br />
ALP Executive which can appear to influence<br />
Federal policies and selections.<br />
11671/ 67-2 He is quite right. He continued:<br />
I will exercise my right to repudiate such men<br />
as I believe disloyal to the ALP, disruptive of its<br />
electoral prospects and destructive of all the ALP<br />
stands for.<br />
As I shall show in greater elaboration later<br />
this has considerable relevance to what<br />
emerged in Adelaide. Mr W. Brown, the<br />
State President of the Australian Labor<br />
Party, commenting on the Conference, is<br />
reported as follows:<br />
The Labor Party throughout Australia was moving<br />
further to the Left, the State ALP president<br />
Mr W. Brown, said yesterday.<br />
This had been shown at the party's Federal<br />
Conference in Adelaide two weeks ago.<br />
' The trend at the Federal Conference was Leftwards,'<br />
Mr Brown said.<br />
Mr Brown was speaking on the 3KZ Labor<br />
Hour. He said the conference had ' strengthened' policy<br />
on the Vietnam war.<br />
It attached a meaningful set of objectives to what<br />
basically was and remains a ' troops out' policy,'<br />
he said.<br />
' Possibly we could say now that it is a policy<br />
of " troops out unless".'<br />
Mr Uren-I rise to a point of order,<br />
Mr Speaker. What has the ALP Federal<br />
Conference got to do with the statement<br />
made by the Minister for External Affairs?<br />
Mr SPEAKER-Order! Honourable<br />
members will cease interjecting. The House<br />
will come to order.<br />
Mr Uren-Mr Speaker, I respect the<br />
Chair. I respectfully point out to you that<br />
we are discussing the statement made this<br />
afternoon by the Minister for External<br />
Affairs, not the ALP Federal Conference<br />
and not what Mr Brown or anybody else<br />
has said.<br />
Mr SPEAKER-Order! There is no substance<br />
in the point of order.<br />
Mr Uren-We were discussing the statement<br />
made by the Minister for External<br />
Affairs. Mr SPEAKER-Order! The honourable<br />
member will resume his seat. There is no<br />
substance in his point of order. It has always<br />
been the practice of the House to acknowledge<br />
that foreign affairs statements have<br />
a broad base. The policies that are now<br />
being referred to are related to the foreign<br />
affairs policies of members of this<br />
Parliament. </p>
<p>Mr HAROLD HOLT-May I point out<br />
to the honourable gentleman, if the fact<br />
has escaped his attention, that the foreign<br />
policy that he will be required to advance<br />
publicly if he is not to forfeit his preselection<br />
at the next election is the foreign policy<br />
that was worked out at the Adelaide Conference<br />
at which those condemned by the<br />
Leader of the Opposition were present and in<br />
which they participated. I do not need to rely<br />
on authorities from this side of the House<br />
as to what occurred and the significance of<br />
the policies declared there. The honourable<br />
member for Yarra ( Dr J. F. Cairns) himself<br />
has been vocal on this. matter, as I<br />
hope I will be able to show shortly.<br />
The former Leader of the Australian<br />
Labor Party, the honorable member for<br />
Melbourne ( Mr Calwell), at least had this<br />
virtue in our eyes: However much we disagreed<br />
with him, we knew where he stood<br />
and what he stood for and we could challenge<br />
fairly and honestly the views that he<br />
put to us. In an article in the Melbourne<br />
' Herald' on 8th August of this year which<br />
he headed ' My stand on Vietnam vindicated',<br />
the former Leader of the Opposition<br />
said: Decisions on Vietnam at the ALP Federal conference<br />
in Adelaide show there has been no<br />
weakening of Labor opposition to the continuation<br />
of the war and Australia's part in it.<br />
I will not read the whole article but it is<br />
available if anybody wishes to read it. He<br />
went on to say:<br />
The conference refused to be stampeded by all<br />
sorts of people-<br />
No doubt, including the present Leader of<br />
the Opposition:<br />
and influences, and the policy in all its essentials<br />
is the same as it was in November last, and as<br />
it will be when the 1969 election is held.<br />
I feel that my stand before the last election<br />
and since has been vindicated.<br />
If I may bring the honourable member<br />
for Yarra in as further support for my comment,<br />
I take the Australian Broadcasting<br />
Commission's news bulletin of Monday, 7th<br />
August, which reported an Hiroshima Day<br />
rally held in Melbourne under the auspices<br />
of the Association for International Coooeration<br />
and Disarmament at the Princess<br />
Theatre. I quote directly from the ABC<br />
news bulletin. It reads: Dr Cairns told the rally that unless the United<br />
States stopped the bombing of North Vietnam<br />
and recognised the National Liberation Front, a<br />
Labor Government would have no alternative to<br />
withdrawing Australian armed forces. Dr Cairns<br />
said the ALP now had a precise policy on Vietnam<br />
which condemned and opposed the war. He said<br />
it did not matter what the ALP leader, Mr<br />
Whitlam, or the Deputy Leader, Mr Barnard, said<br />
on Vietnam. It was the Federal Conference which<br />
had decided the policy.<br />
So, we have Mr Brown saying that they<br />
have been taken to the left and we have Dr<br />
Cairns, the honourable member for Yarra,<br />
saying: ' It does not matter what interpretation<br />
the Leader of the Opposition or the<br />
Deputy Leader of the Opposition puts on it.'<br />
We have the precise policy now which the<br />
former Leader of the Opposition says was<br />
fully in line with the policy he advocated at<br />
the last election and which will be the policy<br />
of the Australian Labor Party at the election<br />
in 1969. I believe that these matters<br />
are relevant.<br />
Mr Uren-Was that a newspaper<br />
clipping? Mr HAROLD HOLT-No.<br />
Mr Uren-The Prime Minister was not<br />
very happy about a newspaper clipping this<br />
morning. Mr HAROLD HOLT-Which one was<br />
that? Mr Uren--During question time I asked<br />
the Prime Minister a question about an<br />
interview with him at London Airport.<br />
Mr HAROLD HOLT-The honourable<br />
member for Yarra will be speaking in this<br />
debate. If the honourable member for Yarra<br />
tells the House that he was misreported by<br />
the Australian Broadcasting Commission-<br />
Mr Whitlam-Which he will do.<br />
Mr HAROLD HOLT-We will be glad<br />
to hear it.<br />
Mr Whitlam-It was not repeated in later<br />
news items.<br />
Mr Wentworth-I do not wonder.<br />
Mr . Whillam--It was not repeated<br />
because . the ABC checked with the honourable<br />
member for Yarra.<br />
Dr J. F. Cairns-Mr Speaker, I claim<br />
that I have been misrepresented. </p>
<p>Mr SPEAKER--Order! The honourable<br />
member will resume his seat.<br />
Mr Bryant-You are spoiling Harold's<br />
speech. Mr HAROLD HOLT-It is not spoiling<br />
it for me. Let me turn now to one or two<br />
other statements made by the Leader of<br />
the Opposition and I do not think an<br />
attempt will be made to interrupt my remarks<br />
now, because these statements to<br />
which I will refer were made in the course<br />
of the honourable gentleman's speech this<br />
afternoon. I quote first from a report which<br />
appeared in the Melbourne ' Sun' at the<br />
time of the Corio by-election. Under the<br />
headline ' PM embarrassed U. S. says<br />
Mr Whitlam' the following statement<br />
appeared: The Prime Minister, Mr Holt, had embarrassed<br />
the U. S. Administration by his recent support for<br />
the bombing of North Vietnam<br />
Mr Whitlam claimed the bombing had to go on<br />
for ' a bit longer' because it had been supported<br />
by Mr Holt and the King of Thailand.<br />
That, surely, is one of the most audacious<br />
and fantastic propositions ever advanced by<br />
a political leader in this country. What the<br />
Leader of the Opposition is saying in effect<br />
is that the President of the United States,<br />
in order to humour me and the King of<br />
Thailand and not embarrass us, would<br />
sacrifice American lives and aircraft. This<br />
is the purport of what he has not only<br />
seriously and solemnly put in the heat of<br />
a by-election but has repeated here in a<br />
considered speech in this House. He<br />
aggravated the offence by saying that I<br />
constituted myself as the spokesman for<br />
Admiral Sharp. It is true that as I passed<br />
through Honolulu I had a very thorough<br />
briefing, as did others in the official party,<br />
with Admiral Sharp and senior colleagues<br />
of the Pacific Command. They were quite<br />
convinced in their minds of the<br />
effectiveness of the bombing. They were<br />
convinced also that any lull in the bombing<br />
merely presented the North Vietnamese<br />
with an opportunity to build up rapidly<br />
supplies which could be used against<br />
American, Vietnamese, Australian and other<br />
allied troops in South Vietnam.<br />
In Fonolulu I saw films taken over one<br />
North V; etnarnese port. In the film taken<br />
on the day becor the lull in the bombing<br />
. there , v. s scarcely a ship to be seen, in<br />
the port but on the day afterwards the port was seen to be crowded with shipping of<br />
one kind or another, rushing in to take<br />
advantage of the lull. Every time there has<br />
been a lull in the bombing that is what<br />
has happened. This fact has been made<br />
public repeatedly but this does not prevent<br />
honourable gentlemen opposite from urging<br />
that the bombing be stopped, notwithstanding<br />
the cost in lives, as well as in terms<br />
of security, to the American, Vietnam-se,<br />
Australian and other allied forces in South<br />
Vietnam. When I spoke in Los Angeles it was not<br />
merely with the knowledge of views or<br />
facts presented to me in Honolulu by<br />
Admiral Sharp and his colleagues. This<br />
Government is in virtually daily contact<br />
with the American Administration. We<br />
know its views intimately, as it knows ours.<br />
I knew with complete confidence that the<br />
views which I expressed in Los Angeles<br />
would certainly not be unpalatable views to<br />
the United States Administration. I do not<br />
have to go into confidential discussions, as<br />
the honourable gentleman sought to do<br />
this afternoon, in order to prove my point.<br />
I make that assertion and I do not purport<br />
to quote anybody in relation to it.<br />
I will summarise the reasons for a continuation<br />
of the bombing, as I stated them<br />
in Los Angeles: It has consistently been the<br />
view of the Australian Government that<br />
North Vietnam must not be permitted to<br />
remain a haven immune from military risk<br />
from , which military aggression against the<br />
south can be mounted with impunity. The<br />
case for controlled bombing is strong and<br />
the bombing has been conducted with great<br />
care and precision. The principal reasons<br />
are that the bombing upsets the flow of<br />
men and materials to the fighting zones; it<br />
damages the transport systems through<br />
which that flow goes forward; it helps to<br />
destroy the enemy's base areas, thereby<br />
weakening his capacity to fight and so<br />
saving the lives of allied fighting men; it<br />
ties up hundreds of thousands of the North<br />
Vietnamese work force in repair and reconstruction;<br />
it demonstrates to the fighting<br />
forces of South Vietnam that America and<br />
her allies are giving them full support;<br />
it demonstrates to the people of South<br />
Vietnam as a-whole that we do not expect<br />
them to suffer and to fight the aggressor<br />
only where he chooses to fight; and it has<br />
the political and psychological effect of </p>
<p>reminding the North Vietnamese that they<br />
cannot hope to win this conflict.<br />
The United States Government has not<br />
accepted arguments in favour of cessation<br />
of the bombing. Indeed, if anything, in<br />
recent times it has increased the tempo and<br />
the scale of bombing. The Australian<br />
Government has not accepted the arguments<br />
against the bombing. I make the<br />
reasons for that abundantly plain here<br />
tonight. The next matter which the Leader of<br />
the Opposition chose to throw at me was<br />
what had developed in respect of the British<br />
position east of Suez and in particular in<br />
the Malaysia-Singapore area. He said that<br />
we should have known for the best part of<br />
the last two years that the United Kingdom<br />
intended to withdraw in the Singapore-<br />
Malaysia area. Do I quote the honourable<br />
gentleman correctly?<br />
Mr Whitlam--Yes.<br />
Mr HAROLD HOLT-The honourable<br />
gentleman says that we should have known.<br />
In other words, as I will demonstrate, he is<br />
saying that I should have placed no reliance<br />
whatever on the firm, publicly stated<br />
assurances of a British Labor Government.<br />
I will quote the assurances-not private<br />
assurances or anything of that sort, but<br />
publicly stated assurances by spokesmen for<br />
the British Government in the relevant<br />
period. I do not do this in any spirit<br />
of recrimination. I have reason to believe<br />
that there has been an appreciation in the<br />
United Kingdom of the temperate way in<br />
which I have addressed myself to this<br />
matter in this country. I say that not illadvisedly.<br />
But when I am taunted by the<br />
Leader of the Opposition that we should<br />
have known what the British were going<br />
to do, I say: ' Here is the record on this<br />
matter. What would he, as head of a Labor<br />
Government in this country, have felt about<br />
assurances given to him by the head of a<br />
Labor Government in the United Kingdom,<br />
and chief spokesman for that Government?'<br />
I cite first the defence review made by<br />
the United Kingdom Minister for Defence,<br />
Mr Healey, in the House of Commons in<br />
February 1966. He said:<br />
It is in the Far East and Southern Asia that the<br />
greatest danger to peace may lie in the next decade<br />
and some of our partners in the Commonwealth<br />
may be directly threatened. We believe it is right<br />
that Britain should maintain a military presence in this area. Its effectiveness will turn largely on the<br />
arrangements we can make with our Commonwealth<br />
partners and other allies in the coming<br />
years. I hasten to add that there has been no factor<br />
of that kind which has led to the ultimate<br />
decision. I have never heard it suggested<br />
by any spokesman for the British Government<br />
that its decision has related to any<br />
failure on the part of ourselves or any of<br />
the other countries in the region. Mr Healey<br />
continued: As soon as conditions permit we shall make<br />
some reductions in the forces which we keep in<br />
the area. We have important military facilities in<br />
Malaysia and Singapore as have our Australian and<br />
New Zealand partners. These we plan to retain<br />
for as long as the Governments of Malaysia and<br />
Singapore agree that we should do so on acceptable<br />
conditions.<br />
Nobody has imposed unacceptable conditions.<br />
The review continued:<br />
Against the day when it may no longer be possible<br />
for us to use these facilities freely, we have<br />
begun to discuss with the Government of Australia<br />
the practical possibilities of our having military<br />
facilities in that country if necessary.<br />
Anyone who was party to the discussions<br />
knows that what the United Kingdom meant<br />
by the expression ' against the day when it<br />
may no longer be possible' was some action<br />
on the part of one or other of the countries<br />
in the area which would make it impracticable<br />
for the United Kingdom to continue to<br />
use the facilities in Malaysia and Singapore.<br />
I pass over the statements made by Mr<br />
Healey in Canberra in that year and turn to<br />
Mr Wilson's speech to the British Parliamentary<br />
Labor Party in London on<br />
June 1966. He said:<br />
Our policy is based on full support for the<br />
United Nations, not just with words but with the<br />
ability to be able to act for and with the United<br />
Nations. What we have to ask is whether it is or should<br />
be the policy of this Party to pull out of all<br />
influence in Asia except the very limited influence<br />
we shall be able to exert in United Nations debates,<br />
telling other people what they ought to do. If this<br />
is the policy the result will be our inability to<br />
intervene whether in a United Nations or Commonwealth<br />
context to stop a small conflagration<br />
becoming a big one.<br />
It will mean this as well, that you will be<br />
leaving Asia to three main powers, China, the<br />
United States and the Soviet Union with a small<br />
peripheral influence exerted by Australia and New<br />
Zealand, but Japan coming up fast on the tails.<br />
It is really said that we have nothing to contribute<br />
except speeches that no-one will listen to.<br />
I believe that Britain through history, through<br />
geography and Commonwealth connections has </p>
<p>a vital contribution to make-I believe a Socialist<br />
Britain has even more.<br />
Perhaps there are some members who would<br />
like to contract out and leave it to the Americans<br />
and Chinese eyeball to eyeball to face this thing<br />
out. The world is too small for that kind of<br />
attitude today. It is the surest prescription for<br />
a nuclear holocaust I could think of.<br />
Do we want to force countries like India to<br />
choose between the power blocs? Or go nuclear<br />
herself? Our presence in Asia gives us a chance<br />
to prevent polarisation. Do we really believe the<br />
only way to world peace is world polarisation?<br />
I believe Britain has a role, and not at prohibitive<br />
cost, in preventing polarisation. We have<br />
a role in influencing America.<br />
My final quotation is from the last statement<br />
made before the announcement of<br />
withdrawal, and that is in the Defence<br />
White Paper of February of this year. Mr<br />
Healey said:<br />
We are continuing to study the scope that exists<br />
for reducing our foreign exchange expenditure<br />
throughout the world always with a proper regard<br />
to the interests of our allies and our ability to<br />
meet our commitments there is much to<br />
learn from the arduous three years' campaign.<br />
against confrontation it was a fine example<br />
of what British forces can do outside Europe to<br />
maintain international stability. Without their contribution<br />
to the Commonwealth effort much of<br />
South East Asia might have collapsed into disorder<br />
perhaps inviting competitive intervention by<br />
other powers with the consequent risk of general<br />
war. But provided that they are needed and<br />
welcome, the continuing presence of British forces<br />
can help to create an environment in which loc! al<br />
governments are able to establish the political and<br />
economic basis for peace and stability. There can<br />
also be no certainty-so long as threats to stability<br />
remain-that those forces will not be required<br />
to give help to friendly Governments, or to play<br />
a part in the United Nations peace-keeping force<br />
as they have done in recent years.<br />
Mr Stokes-When did he say that?<br />
Mr HAROLD HOLT-That was in<br />
February of this year. I have not quoted the<br />
passages as a means of criticising the United<br />
Kingdom Government. I believe that it is a<br />
measure of the difficulties that the United<br />
Kingdom Government has found itself compelled<br />
to face that, despite these assurances<br />
which I believe were given by the men who<br />
uttered them in good faith and with good<br />
intention, it had to depart so radically from<br />
the assurances in the final statement it made.<br />
We continued our discussions with representatives<br />
of the United Kingdom Government<br />
until the time of that announcement.<br />
We have not sought to rake over the embers<br />
of the past. As my colleague pointed out, we are devoting ourselves to the problems<br />
of the future and we hope to have co-operation<br />
with the United Kingdom and other<br />
countries in the area.<br />
Perhaps having made a passing reference<br />
to co-operation with other countries in the<br />
area, it is interesting to note that one passage<br />
in my colleague's speech that attracted<br />
some commendation from the Leader of the<br />
Opposition was the passage in which he<br />
spoke of the development of regional<br />
co-operation for security and other purposes.<br />
But this comes from the man who recently<br />
told the world publicly on television that<br />
Australia is the only respectable ally that the<br />
United States has. That is not a very good<br />
way to encourage regionalism amongst the<br />
free countries with whom Australia is<br />
co-operating in a military, economic and<br />
civil sense. This is the man who demands a<br />
process of regionalism.<br />
There is another statement that I wish to<br />
correct. The honourable member stated<br />
quite directly that this Government was bent<br />
on securing a military victory in Vietnam<br />
regardless of all else and that we had given<br />
no thought. or support to a political settlement.<br />
Since I became Prime Minister I do<br />
not think I have made a statement in which<br />
I spoke about military consequences without<br />
having commented that a military result of<br />
itself will not be sufficient to meet the<br />
situation; there must also be a political<br />
settlement. I have said that with the full<br />
knowledge of the problems we had in<br />
Malaya, as it then was, over many years. I<br />
know that if the military effort of our<br />
opponent is defeated without a political<br />
settlement having been reached, in the kind<br />
of country with which we are dealing<br />
guerilla activity can go on indefinitely. This<br />
happened in Malaya. So we must work for<br />
a political settlement, but we do not include<br />
in that the kind of recognition that the<br />
honourable gentleman and his colleagues<br />
want to give to the Communist instrument<br />
of the Government of North Vietnam. We<br />
will negotiate with the Government of North<br />
Vietnam, but he is demanding that the<br />
Government of South Vietnam and the<br />
Government of the United States recognise<br />
the Communist organ of the Government of<br />
North Vietnam in South Vietnam. This is<br />
one of the points that the North Vietnamese<br />
seek to have fulfilled before they will<br />
negotiate. </p>
<p>Before I left the aspect of the bombing,<br />
I should have said that this Government<br />
has as much access to informatlon as any<br />
other government has, almost without<br />
exception. We have almost as much information<br />
as the United States possesses on<br />
this mattr. Nothing has come to our knowledge<br />
that would warrant us holding the<br />
belief that there would be a reasonable<br />
prospect of negotiation if only the bombing<br />
were to cease. If the North Vietnamese<br />
want a negotiated settlement, there are<br />
many ways for them to make their wishes<br />
known. All possible avenues have been<br />
explored by us. The honourable member for<br />
Brisbane ( Mr Cross) said that there have<br />
been many occasions in recent years when<br />
the United States could have sought a peaceful<br />
settlement. I think he said that some<br />
forty countries in all have sought to achieve<br />
some sort of peaceful negotiation. So the<br />
avenues for negotiation are there f the<br />
North Vietnamese want to follow them. I<br />
know of nothing that has emerged during<br />
the period of the dispute that would suggest<br />
that the North Vietnamese are ready to<br />
negotiate. Now let me come to the present policy<br />
on Vietnam of the Australian Labor Party,<br />
if we can find it. I introduce my remarks<br />
on this point by quoting from the policy<br />
speech made by the honcurable member for<br />
Batman ( Mr Benson) during the course of<br />
the last election campaign. It reveals the<br />
background to developments inside the Australian<br />
Labor Party in its decisions on<br />
foreign policy since then. I quote him as<br />
having said:<br />
The Labor Party's Federal Conference last year<br />
removed the clause from the Party platform which<br />
said Labor would honour all existing treaties. The<br />
Labor Party now did not recognise international<br />
security treaties. This is not the time for Australia<br />
to break her treaty ties but it is the time to<br />
strenthen them and to stand by any nation wishing<br />
to remain free.<br />
I have quoted that passage because I have<br />
in my hand the text of the decisions taken<br />
at the recent conference of the Australian<br />
Labor Party as they were handed out to the<br />
Press. Without going through the full document,<br />
I take the summary that appears at<br />
, page 2 of the roneoed copy. I do not think<br />
anybody opposite will challenge its<br />
accuracy. The report states:<br />
Satisfied that the war in Vietnam does not<br />
Involve any obligations for Australia under<br />
ANZUS, SEATO or the United Nations<br />
charter-I pause there to remind the House that South<br />
Vietnam was one of the protocol S: ates<br />
mentioned in SEATO. I concede that the<br />
legal point could be taken that there was<br />
no obligation, but it was not so remote<br />
from the consideration of the SEATO<br />
powers as this statement would imply.<br />
Secondly. I point out that under ANZUS<br />
we are linked with the United States of<br />
America and with New Zealand. Can it be<br />
seriously argued that the policies that I<br />
shall be outlining here as they appear in<br />
this document have no bearing on the<br />
strength of our alliance with the Americans<br />
under ANZUS? For example, could an<br />
Australian government which withdrew its<br />
troops, having virtually served an ultimatum<br />
on the United States, look with the<br />
same sense of security to ANZUS in the<br />
future as we feel we are able to do today?<br />
Having interpolated to make that comment<br />
I go on to read from the document:<br />
and does not ascist the Vietnamese people to<br />
determine their own affairs-<br />
Apparently they are to be determined for<br />
them by the Government of North Vietnam:<br />
and that no threat to Australian security from<br />
China is involved-<br />
My colleague dealt with that in his own<br />
paper, as I did briefly during question time<br />
today: the ALP seeks primarily to bring the war to a<br />
conclusion. To do so, the ALP on achieving<br />
office will submit to our allies that they should<br />
immediately cease bombing North Vietnam,<br />
recognise the National Liberation Front<br />
as a principal party to negotiations,<br />
transform operations in South Vietnam into<br />
holding operations thereby tr avoid the involvement<br />
of civilians in the war, cease<br />
the use of napalm and other objectionable<br />
materials of war and provide sanctuary<br />
for anyone seeking it.<br />
Should our allies fail to take this action, the Australian<br />
Government would tlen cos: der that. It<br />
had no alternative other than to withdraw our<br />
armed forces.<br />
No wonder the former Leader of the<br />
Opposition said that this was in essence what<br />
he put to the electors on the last occasion,<br />
but here it is put more strongly in the form<br />
of an ultimatum to the United States. Just<br />
as in the North West Cape matter the policy<br />
of the Labor Party was to serve up a set<br />
of conditions which it knew would be<br />
unacceptable to the United States, this is its<br />
policy again. Time will not permit me to </p>
<p>go at any great length into these particular<br />
matters, but let me, without speaking at too<br />
much length on the situation of Vietnam,<br />
remind the House of this.<br />
The fighting primarily involves the Vietnamese,<br />
of course, but this is no civil war.<br />
In 1954 a fourteen-nation conference at<br />
Geneva agreed that newly independent<br />
Vietnam should be separated into two parts<br />
-North Vietnam for followers of Communist<br />
leaders and South Vietnam for those<br />
who wanted another way of life. Since then<br />
the two parts have gone their own ways-<br />
North Vietnam as a typical Communist<br />
dictatorship. The war against South Vietnam<br />
is directed from Hanoi. The National<br />
Liberation Front is a creature of Hanoi.<br />
After partition the Vietnamese were given<br />
an opportunity to move north or south, and<br />
so select the type of government they<br />
wanted. Less than 100,000 went north, to<br />
become subjects of the Hanoi Communist<br />
regime. Ten times as many-almost one<br />
million-fled from the Communist dictatorship<br />
to South Vietnam. Yet we are now<br />
told that this is a nationalist movement, that<br />
all we are doing is interfering with the<br />
normal nationalist processes inside this<br />
particular country.<br />
Those who heard the honourable gentleman<br />
will recall that he made a great deal<br />
of the state of Congressional and Senate<br />
opinion in the United States. Again I can<br />
give some facts which I think will be rather<br />
more persuasive to this House. I suggest<br />
that it would be difficult to obtain more<br />
convincing evidence of Congressional support<br />
for the President's policies than the<br />
votes taken in March this year in both the<br />
Senate and the House of Representatives in<br />
Washington on the supplementary Bill on<br />
the military budget relating to the war in<br />
Vietnam. In the Senate the voting was 77<br />
in favour of the Bill and 3 against. In the<br />
House of Representatives the voting was<br />
385 in favour of the Bill and 11 against.<br />
We are parliamentarians. We know the<br />
significance of voting figures. When I am<br />
told that half the senators and a great proportion<br />
of the Representatives of the United<br />
States are against what the present'administration<br />
is doing, I throw those figures in<br />
the teeth of the honourable gentleman.<br />
Unfortunately, in the United States as in<br />
this country, minorities can be very vocal<br />
and the mass of people can be much less vocal if they are in support of the Government's<br />
policy. Some of those vocal<br />
minorities will form part of what I have<br />
to say now before I conclude.<br />
Yesterday when we were dealing with a<br />
question in relation to the collection of<br />
funds for the Vietcong or the National<br />
Liberation Front I said that there was a<br />
species of psychological warfare being<br />
waged in this country, as indeed it is being<br />
waged in the United States, and that I<br />
thought we should be made much more<br />
publicly aware of this than we are at the<br />
present time. I want to give the House a few<br />
manifestations of this. I start with a reference<br />
to the Association for International<br />
Co-operation and Disarmament. I do not<br />
need to go into detail about this organisation.<br />
Our colleague who was then Attorney-<br />
General, the present Minister for Immigration<br />
( Mr Snedden), mentioned it in this<br />
House on 3rd September 1964. But it is<br />
rather interesting to recall that in March<br />
this year the executive of the New South<br />
Wales Branch of the ALP decided that:<br />
ALP members can no longer associate with the<br />
AICD and directs allA LP members of this organisation<br />
to resign<br />
But the Federal Executive of the ALP,<br />
chaired by Senator Keeffe, who, I understand,<br />
was unanimously re-elected recently<br />
President of the Party, ruled on 30th March<br />
1967 in Canberra that the NSW Branch had<br />
exceeded its authority in proscribing the<br />
AICD. I understand that in July Senator<br />
Keeffe and the honourable member for<br />
Yarra ( Dr J. F. Cairns) spoke at a protest<br />
meeting organised outside the United States<br />
Consulate in Melbourne under the auspices<br />
of this organisation, a meeting which has<br />
been described as an all night vigil. It was<br />
the Victorian arm of the AICD which sponsored<br />
this meeting.<br />
The August mobilisation committee was<br />
set up by the Association's New South<br />
Wales' division to conduct the annual<br />
Hiroshima Day celebrations. The committee<br />
was obviously carefully selected to involve<br />
as many groups as it could in the Vietnam<br />
protest movement. It would appear to me<br />
that as a tactical move Communists were<br />
exclude from the committee but were active<br />
in organisational matters. August mobilisation<br />
includes certain members of the clergy,<br />
academic students, Youth women, professionals<br />
and trade unionists. A new feature </p>
<p>of the demonstration this year was a short<br />
religious service before the march.<br />
There was an overseas speaker at this<br />
demonstration, a Dr Takman. Let us consider<br />
Dr Takman. He is the chief medical<br />
officer of the Child Welfare Board of<br />
Stockholm city. He is a member of the<br />
Swedish Communist Party and is currently<br />
on its central committee. In 1950 he was<br />
refused admittance to the United Kingdom<br />
to attend the Sheffield Peace Congress.<br />
Early this year he visited North Vietnam<br />
to gather medical evidence for use at the<br />
Russell tribunal which, as honourable members<br />
will be aware, sat in Stockholm in<br />
May. He has also attended various other<br />
Communist Party conferences and has participated<br />
in other activities concerned with<br />
Vietnam. Since September 1966 he has<br />
been a Communist Party member of the<br />
Stockholm City Council. These facts are all<br />
ascertainable. I am surprised that honourable<br />
gentlemen opposite have not asked<br />
me why we admitted him to this country.<br />
A business visa was issued to him on 3rd<br />
August. In his application he explained that<br />
the object of his visit was mainly scientific<br />
and that he was engaged in a social<br />
and medical study of Swedish gypsy<br />
minorities for Upsala University. He said<br />
that for this purpose he needed direct information<br />
about aboriginals and other<br />
minorities, particularly in Australia and<br />
Japan. I referred a little earlier to a meeting at<br />
the Princess Theatre in Melbourne which<br />
was addressed by the honourable member<br />
for Yarra. The meeting was held after an<br />
Hiroshima Day march under the auspices<br />
of the same body. A number of organisations<br />
connected with the peace movement<br />
joined in the march and the subsequent<br />
meeting. A television programme showed<br />
the march. I did not see it but I have been<br />
informed-I think reliably-that the representatives<br />
of the Victorian Branch of the<br />
ALP carried a large banner and that several<br />
members of the Monash University Labor<br />
Club carried Vietcong flags. That was one<br />
occasion on which members of the ALP<br />
apparently were not too unhappy to associate<br />
with members of the Monash University<br />
Labor Club.<br />
It may be felt that many people associated<br />
with the bodies to which I have referred are well meaning people. I have<br />
no doubt that many of them are. I am<br />
sure that at least some of them have no<br />
knowledge of the use to which they are<br />
being put by background influences. In<br />
order to give the House an idea of the<br />
nature of the organisation to which I am<br />
referring, I have in my hand a quite scurrilous<br />
sheet issued-it is so endorsed-by<br />
the Queensland Peace Committee for International<br />
Co-operation and Disarmament,<br />
608 Ann Street, Fortitude Valley, Queensland.<br />
It is an attempt to poison the minds<br />
of Australian people in relation to the proposed<br />
visit by American servicemen to this<br />
country under the rest and recreation programme.<br />
As honourable members can see,<br />
it has on its cover a picture of a young<br />
lady partly clad. The text alongside the<br />
picture refers to the worry that Australians<br />
will have about their womenfolk on the<br />
arrival here of United States servicemen.<br />
On the other side of the sheet is what purports<br />
to be a genuine report bur I question<br />
very much its authenticity because it bears<br />
no authentication, no date and no source<br />
reference. It purports to be an account of a<br />
rape committed on a twenty year old Vietnamese<br />
girl by four United States servicemen.<br />
This sheet has been circulated as<br />
poisonous literature by an organisation<br />
which has an aura of respectability and<br />
attracts to it the eminently worthy people<br />
to whom I have referred.<br />
I place in a rather different category the<br />
activity here in Canberra today of the International<br />
Committee of Conscience on Vietnam.<br />
I make no allegation in relation to<br />
the background or the attitude of mind of<br />
the people associated with it. I have no<br />
doubt that they are well meaning people.<br />
I suppose that many members of this Parliament<br />
were given a copy of the little<br />
pamphlet that they were distributing. The<br />
emotional quality of the pamphlet I think<br />
can be illustrated by this quotation from<br />
it: We, who in various ways have assumed the<br />
terrible responsibility of articulating the fuman<br />
conscience, must speak or, literally, we should<br />
expect the very stones to cry out.<br />
I would like to say that there are people<br />
who have a conscience in relation to Vietnam;<br />
who have a conscience in relation to<br />
aggression, terrorism, oppression subversion<br />
and the other crimes that have been com-</p>
<p>mitted in the name of a national liberation<br />
-front. By way of antidote I shall quote, with<br />
the full authority of the writer, a letter I<br />
have received from the Reverend Colin<br />
McLean. Mr James--Why did the Prime Minister<br />
refuse to see the church leaders?<br />
Mr SPEAKER-Order! The honourable<br />
member for Hunter will cease interjecting.<br />
Mr HAROLD HOLT-I wrote very<br />
politely, I can assure the honourable<br />
gentleman, to the Reverend Alan Walker<br />
who had asked me to receive representatives<br />
of the organisation. I explained the reasons<br />
why I could not do so.<br />
Mr James-Why did you refuse to see<br />
them? Mr SPEAKER-Order! The honourable<br />
member for Hunter will restrain himself.<br />
Mr HAROLD HOLT-I said in effect<br />
that I had carefully read their pamphlet<br />
and that it was evident to me that a very<br />
different interpretation was placed by the<br />
sponsors of the movement on events in<br />
Vietnam and the courses which should be<br />
followed in relation to them. I said that<br />
while I had studied their views it was quite<br />
impracticable for me, or for that matter,<br />
any senior Minister to see all the people<br />
who had views to express in relation to<br />
Vietnam. However, I paid them the<br />
courtesy of studying what they had to say<br />
and of writing to them.<br />
Mr James-But you refused to see them?<br />
Mr HAROLD HOLT-Did the Leader<br />
of the Opposition see them?<br />
Aft Jamnes--Yes.<br />
Mr HAROLD HOLT-That would not<br />
surprise me. I wish now to quote from a<br />
letter I have received from the Reverend<br />
Colin McLean, who is the minister of the<br />
Hughesdale Congregational Church at Oakleigh<br />
in Victoria. He writes:<br />
I write to disassociate myself from that vocal<br />
group of clergy who are opposed to your Government's<br />
policy in Vietnam.<br />
Lately I received a letter from an ' International<br />
Committee of Conscience on Vietnam', inviting<br />
me to take part in a demonstration outside Parliament<br />
House on Thursday, 17th August. I deplore<br />
this demonstration.<br />
The growing number of rallies and demonstrations<br />
of a semi religious nature, in our country,<br />
which play into the hands of international Communism<br />
is alarming and is not representative of<br />
the majority of Christian people. The letter referred to ' an amazing consensus<br />
among Christian leadership around the world in<br />
opposition to the Vietnam war'. This simply is not<br />
true: many of us realise that if Godiess Comnmunism<br />
is not halted, the ensuing bloodshed and<br />
suffering in the world will be far greater than that<br />
being inflicted by our forces in Vietnam. We too,<br />
want peace, but only peace with honour and<br />
justice, and which guarantees the great freedoms<br />
and Christian heritage we enjoy.<br />
You have our prayers and support.<br />
I have quoted that letter to show that other<br />
views are held around this country than<br />
those to which we have had to listen.<br />
Mr James---Did he sign the letter?<br />
Mr HAROLD HOLT-Yes, and the<br />
honourable member may read it if he wishes<br />
to do so. Not only did he sign it but he<br />
authorised me, when I asked if I might do<br />
so, to give it full publication. The final<br />
reference I make is to the document<br />
' Ramparts', which no doubt has reached<br />
many honourable members. I will not discuss<br />
it in detail because its bona fides have<br />
been attacked, I think convincingly, by<br />
others. Mr James-Is it a Communist paper?<br />
Mr SPEAKER-I warn the honourable<br />
member for Hunter.<br />
Mr HAROLD HOLT-It was released<br />
in thousands during the Corio by-election<br />
campaign by the Liberal Reform Group,<br />
so styled. I mention it, not in association<br />
with any other organisation, but as an<br />
illustration of the processes of psychological<br />
warfare which are designed to confuse and<br />
perplex the people of this country and to<br />
destroy support for the policies of the<br />
democratically elected Government of this<br />
country. Unlike the Labor Opposition, I<br />
am in the happy state of being able to stand<br />
here tonight knowing that there is not one<br />
member of the two Government Parties<br />
which provide a record majority behind<br />
me who does not support the Government<br />
in its policy on Vietnam. I feel it my duty<br />
in those circumstances to bring home to<br />
the Australian people that these processes<br />
which are poisoning the minds of the people<br />
and creating disquiet in their minds are<br />
processes which are designed to weaken<br />
Australian support for policies which the<br />
people at a democratic election have<br />
endorsed in their Government. I believe<br />
that we have heard-the Leader of the<br />
Opposition today give expression to policies<br />
which I suspect are by no means entirely </p>
<p>tasteful to him, but which have merged<br />
from a conference which senior members<br />
of the Party have described either as an<br />
endorsement of what they presented at the<br />
last general election or as a move leftwards<br />
from where they were before. I say that these things, too, can only confuse and perplex<br />
the Australian people, and it is a<br />
responsibility of the Australian community<br />
as a whole to have a clear and plain understanding<br />
of what is put to them by spokesmen<br />
of the Opposition.<br />
