TRANSCRIPT OF JOINT NEWS CONFERENCE WITH THE HON KIM<br />
BEAZLEY, MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS,<br />
PARLIAMENT HOUSE 24 SEPTEMBER 1990<br />
E OE PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, I guess the question now is,<br />
when will this happen and how will it happen?<br />
PM: I want to say a few words about that and then I<br />
think that Kim can take you perhaps in more detail to<br />
that. Let me say this. As far as the Government is<br />
concerned, we: want to now give effect to the authority<br />
that's been given to us by the Party as quickly as<br />
possible. That means as quickly as is consistent with<br />
getting what will be very complex legislation into place.<br />
Kim, you migh7. t like to add to that.<br />
BEAZLEY: Yes, well we would want to try and get some<br />
draft legislation up by the end of the year for<br />
considerationk. Certainly we'd want to see this process<br />
over if we could by about the middle of next year. We<br />
will be working towards that end. But it's not easy<br />
legislation t~ o draft and will not be easy legislation to<br />
talk through the Senate and to negotiate the fine detail<br />
of it. As fa~ r as the airlines are concerned I think that<br />
we could do the best part of the work that needed to be<br />
done on that this financial year. It might spill over<br />
into the next: one.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you concerned about putting Qantas and<br />
Australian on the market when the share market's so<br />
depressed and the investment market is so depressed?<br />
BEAZLEY: It's something that we'd have to think about<br />
and we'd have to talk to the airlines about the<br />
appropriate way of doing it. Of course other departments<br />
have an influence on the course of action that we'd take<br />
on those matters. But that's not something that would be<br />
distant from our minds.<br />
PM: Let me add there to what Kim has said that as far as<br />
the airlines are concerned you'll appreciate that some of<br />
the placement will obviously be overseas. In other words<br />
you're not looking just at the capacity of the Australian<br />
capital market to absorb what would be placed.<br />
JOURNALIST: So when would the sell-off of the airlines<br />
would you envisage? </p>
<p>PM: Well again I'd just make a comment about that and<br />
Kim might like to expand on it. Obviously as far as we<br />
are concerned we would like to do this as quickly as<br />
possible. But we are not going to move precipitately in<br />
a way which could minimise your chances of getting the<br />
best possible return for the sale of your assets.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you inclined to do the Australian<br />
Airlines sale in two parts rather than putting it all on<br />
the market at: once?<br />
BEAZLEY: I think that's something that we'd want to<br />
consider after we've had a chance to take a pretty decent<br />
look at what would be the most appropriate way of going<br />
about it. I think there'd be distinct views I think in<br />
the Government about whether or not you ' d want to do the<br />
whole lot at once or in two parts. But certainly I think<br />
we'd want to see the whole process at a conclusion mid to<br />
late next year.<br />
JOURNALIST: Senator Button suggested it could be<br />
years before there is in fact a full network competitor<br />
to Telecom arid suggest that on the Swedish model<br />
there may never be.<br />
BEAZLEY: Well the Swedish model has this flaw.<br />
Basically the Swedish Telecom, Televerket, determines the<br />
nature and Price of interconnect into its system. That<br />
is not our proposal. I think that it would be a most<br />
unwise competitor not to expand as rapidly as it possibly<br />
could its involvement in the full network. One can't<br />
tell how long; this particular period of regulation would<br />
last. We would certainly see it going through a couple<br />
of Parliament~ s. But from that point on, if you haven't<br />
taken advantage of your position to build yourself a<br />
customer base then you don't exactly know what's going to<br />
happen to you. That's the first point I'd make. The<br />
second point I'd make, building alternative networks is<br />
getting easier and easier. You take a look at the sort<br />
of costs, prices I was dealing with on fibre optic cable.<br />
Transmission and cable Adelaide to Perth, just a bit over<br />
million. When you're talking those sorts of numbers<br />
and then contemplate also that in this decade we'll see a<br />
massive expansion of sort of wild-spaced communication<br />
around domestic nets, I think it's not going to be as<br />
difficult for a competitor to operate as some people<br />
thought. JOURNALIST: do you competitors to be up and running<br />
and secondly you mentioned putting in legislation this<br />
year. Would you expect it to be through this year<br />
next year?<br />
BEAZLEY: I really, with the best will in the world I<br />
don't think we could get the legislation through this<br />
year. It will be through next year and then immediately<br />
you'd want the competitor going. You'd hope to have that </p>
<p>whole thing positioned, out of the way by the end of next<br />
year. JOURNALIST: select the second carrier?<br />
BEAZLEY: I think there are two alternatives really.<br />
There's one of simply proceeding with a generalised<br />
beauty contest between those who are interested in being<br />
in it or there is the prospect of commencing with a<br />
beauty contest, toning it down to two, and then competing<br />
those two against each other in much the same way as we<br />
did the frigates. That has the advantage probably of<br />
increasing the Australian content in the initial owner<br />
and it also gives the Government, if you do go through<br />
that course, an opportunity to present a menu more<br />
effectively to the competitors of the things it wants and<br />
expects them.. So that's something that we'll have to bat<br />
through with Cabinet. But we will have time to reach<br />
conclusions on that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, what's your response to the ATEA<br />
threats against the interconnect process?<br />
PM: I've got; these things to say about it. I can<br />
understand in the immediacy of the decision that's been<br />
taken by the conference which disappoints the ATEA that<br />
some rather belligerent statements might emanate from<br />
that quarter. The second thing I say is that the ATEA<br />
must understand that this Government will govern. We<br />
will not be dictated to by one union. The third thing I<br />
say is that 1: believe not only will the Government not be<br />
dictated to but the trade union movement as a whole would<br />
not tolerate a situation where the interests of all their<br />
members would be disadvantaged by such industrial action.<br />
Now the fact is that under the decision that's been<br />
taken, as I've indicated and most importantly as the<br />
Ministers indicated, there's a lot of discussion to take<br />
place now. We want an environment and I hope the ATEA<br />
will want an environment in which those discussions can<br />
take place constructively. But in the end the position<br />
is this. The overwhelming majority of Australian workers<br />
operate in a competitive environment and there is no<br />
reason why one union, the ATEA, shall say that uniquely<br />
for them they will not operate in the competitive<br />
environment and to pursue that position to the<br />
disadvantage of all other workers and their dependents in<br />
this country. I believe that with good will these things<br />
can be resolved and will be resolved. I'm heartened by<br />
the fact that this evening just in the last half an hour<br />
that Mr Ian McLean has said well some deep breaths will<br />
need to be taken and some consideration given to these<br />
issues. JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, have you seen the situation in<br />
America when they deregulated the airlines over there?<br />
Do you intend to put in any form of cushion to stop the<br />
airlines from folding if the airlines are split up? </p>
<p>4<br />
PM: Well the airlines folding, who folds and who<br />
prospers will be a matter of the market. There is no<br />
question but that the airline industry will be a growth<br />
industry in this country. It will be a significant<br />
growth industry. As far as Australian Airlines is<br />
concerned, the decisions that have been taken today by<br />
the Party will mean that Australian Airlines will have<br />
had its capacity to prosper in that growing market<br />
enhanced. I just may make this observation in passing<br />
that I noticed that one disgruntled delegate made some<br />
observation about my friend Sir Peter Abeles prospering<br />
under the decision. Let me say this. If there is one<br />
thing that is certain about the Australian airline<br />
industry, if we had wanted to help Sir Peter Abeles, what<br />
we would have done is to leave Australian Airlines in its<br />
present condition. Australian Airlines is going to be a<br />
much more effective competitor for Ansett as a result of<br />
the decisions that have been taken today.<br />
JOURNALIST: Will the fledgling privatised Australian<br />
Airline be protected in the short term?<br />
BEAZLEY: That airline is<br />
PM: Fledgling? Some fledgling.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
BEAZLEY: Well it's no fledgling.<br />
JOURNALIST: Government backing.<br />
PM: Let me make it quite clear. It didn't have<br />
Government backing. The whole problem as far as<br />
Australian Airlines was concerned is that they were<br />
coming to government and saying this. Give us equity<br />
injection or privatise. Now there is no way that as far<br />
as this Government was concerned that we were going to<br />
allocate scarce resources of f Budget to inject equity<br />
into that airline. That would have meant the<br />
privatisation of Australian Airlines by market takeover<br />
by their competitors. Under this position now their<br />
capital funding will be guaranteed.<br />
JOURNALIST: The ACTU said last Friday that it still<br />
wasn't convinced of the need for a second network. How<br />
are you going to convince them now?<br />
PM: If we're going to have a perspective of the ACT<br />
position, just don't leave it that. The ACTU conducted<br />
discussions amongst their affiliates and as we came to<br />
the eve of the conference the ACTU didn't have a united<br />
position. But very importantly the President of the ACTU<br />
indicated two things. Firstly that he believed the<br />
Government position would and should prevail and that<br />
within that position that the ACTU would be co-operating<br />
in discussions with the Government. Those are the facts. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: head of f problems with the unions before<br />
those problems are quite obvious to the community<br />
PM: We've be in government for seven and a half years<br />
and if there's one thing which characterises this<br />
Government it:' s our capacity to and our willingness to<br />
consult with the trade union movement. That's been a<br />
feature of Australian life under this Government and it's<br />
been to the benefit of the public as well as the members<br />
of the trade union movement. We'll continue to do that.<br />
But in the end on these issues, as I've said, the<br />
Government will govern.<br />
JOURNALIST: What should they watch for now? How<br />
should we best watch the progress of these<br />
PM: In regard to these particular enterprises?<br />
JOURNALIST: Yes.<br />
PM: Well again, let me make a couple of comments. I<br />
mean Kim has been much more intimately concerned in<br />
discussions with potential operators should add to<br />
it. But quit~ e clearly on the experience of other<br />
countries and on the expectation of the capacity for<br />
growth in this country, there will be considerable<br />
interest in investment in the Australian<br />
telecommunications industry. We're not going to have any<br />
problem about people wanting to now come in and operate<br />
within this new competitive framework. As far as the<br />
airlines are concerned I think you will have interest<br />
from overseas airlines in getting a placement with Qantas<br />
and with Aust~ ralian. So I don't anticipate any problem<br />
there. The important thing is that for as far as<br />
Australian consumers are concerned both in the area of<br />
telecommunications and of airlines, that interest of<br />
investors will work out in a way which will be to their<br />
benefit. But: Kim you might like to<br />
BEAZLEY: Yes I think obviously investors will want to<br />
watch the content of the legislation. They'll probably<br />
want to talk to Austel about the sorts of issues of<br />
interconnection arrangements both technical and the cost<br />
of interconnection. I think they will obviously want to<br />
know a bit more about Aussat's financial circumstances.<br />
They will want to in the case of the airlines know how<br />
we're going 1: o place shares. I think particularly in the<br />
case of Qantas there will be a very heavy placement<br />
privately and probably not very much listed. Probably<br />
there'll be a similar case in the case of Australian.<br />
We'd be looking for big strategic owners standing in<br />
those airlines with very substantial interests. In the<br />
case of Australian, some foreign airlines but<br />
particularly some Australian financial institutions and<br />
also some Australian transport companies other than TNT.<br />
So I think obviously we're going to talk these things<br />
through with the airline management. We've done a bit of<br />
that now. They have views about how they'd like that </p>
<p>done. We have our own views. Over the next couple of<br />
months we will finalise them.<br />
JOURNALIST: It does sound from that if the opportunities<br />
for Australians to invest in Australian Airlines, Qantas<br />
or the new telecommunications operator would be quite<br />
limited.<br />
PM: Let's take Australian first. Again Kim will want to<br />
expand on this. But take Australian Airlines first. The<br />
immediately sensible thing to do is to look at some<br />
foreign airlines taking a placement because that is what<br />
Australian has decided, with good sense I think, is in<br />
their best interests. The reasons for that are fairly<br />
obvious. Now to that extent, and taking into account<br />
that we also want to give employees of Australian the<br />
opportunity for involvement, I think it's right to say in<br />
the first instance that that opportunity will be limited.<br />
But then as we move to the total disposition of<br />
Australian, the opportunity for public involvement will<br />
increase. Although, as Kim says also, the most effective<br />
operation of Australian would involve, I would think, a<br />
fairly significant involvement of major transport<br />
operators other than TNT. But within that total<br />
framework there will be room I think for some public<br />
listing. In regard to Qantas, there again, Qantas' best<br />
interests are going to be served by the involvement into<br />
Qantas of some other international operators and then<br />
when you take account of the fact that you are only<br />
exposing 49% there and you want some employee involvement<br />
then it's quite true that the opportunities for general<br />
public listing would be limited. In regard to<br />
telecommunications, the obvious truth is that no<br />
Australian interest has the capacity to establish the<br />
competition, the network competition. Now that will<br />
mean, as we have indicated therefore, that at the outset<br />
there would be a major overseas involvement. The<br />
position of the Government is that we would like to see<br />
as much Australian involvement as is consistent with the<br />
most immediate introduction of competition.<br />
JOURNALIST: sale of the airline.<br />
BEAZLEY: Well that's, I mean we've put around a series<br />
of notional figures. Now we probably better be more<br />
circumspect that we have to this point.<br />
PM: Yes, exactly.<br />
BEAZLEY: We are looking for a totality in various ways<br />
of the sales, including all sorts of manoeuvres related<br />
to the telecommunications that will end up with a package<br />
over the But by no means that sort of area for the<br />
airlines. But we expect substantial sums.<br />
JOURNALIST: What's your minimum for Australian or<br />
Qantas. </p>
<p>PM: Oh, come on. We want to get the maximum figure.<br />
We're not going to jeopardise that by putting that sort<br />
of figure on it.<br />
BEAZLEY: you had a question.<br />
JOURNALIST: better to sell off say the whole of<br />
Australian Ai~ rlines. If you sell of f part of it<br />
wouldn't you have to plough that money back into capital<br />
expenditure whereas if you sell of the whole of<br />
BEAZLEY: I think there's a lot in what you say in that,<br />
yes. JOURNALIST: 100% then where does that money go to<br />
then? Will i~ t go to infrastructure or paying off debt?<br />
BEAZLEY: Wel. l that's again to be determined by the<br />
Government. There are two alternatives but the one most<br />
favoured is into retiring public debt interest then using<br />
the savings in the<br />
PM: Retiringj public debt<br />
BEAZLEY: And then using the savings regard to<br />
interest to form effectively a fund for infrastructure<br />
development. PM: That's right.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Beazley, have you taken any advice on the<br />
constitutionality of a second Telecom network industry?<br />
BEAZLEY: I know the constitutional position associated<br />
with it, it's not a problem. The Government has the<br />
capacity to dispose of post and telegraphs as it sees<br />
fit. This comes into that category very clearly<br />
established tinder that constitutional authority. It's<br />
legislative issues that are of concern, not the<br />
constitutional ones here.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, Barry Jones made an interesting<br />
speech, it was only agreed with the killing of sacred<br />
COWS. He said there was a need for a new ideology by<br />
Labor's leaders to attract a new generation of voters and<br />
Party members. Do you take that seriously?<br />
PM: I don'~ t think there's a need for a new ideology. I<br />
always believe that it's a responsibility of Government<br />
and its Leaders to get your message, your ideals out to<br />
the people and particularly I think the younger<br />
generations. But as I said in my speech today, the<br />
fundamental ideology, if you like, and objective of the<br />
Labor Party has been unchanged for nearly 100 years. I<br />
see no need to change it. It's not, as I said, something<br />
that needs a degree in political science to be<br />
understood. It's very simple, the ideology of the<br />
Australian Labor Party is to improve the lot of ordinary </p>
<p>Australians. That's your objective, it's not going to<br />
change. What we're about is showing the flexibility in a<br />
rapidly changing world to make sure that you have the<br />
most appropriLate means of giving effect to that<br />
ideological objective. To the extent that the Party has<br />
made the decision that new means are necessary in these<br />
areas to give effect to that objective, then we do have<br />
the responsibility of explaining those facts to the<br />
Australian electorate as a whole and we will. But not<br />
only will we do that in terms of that obligation upon us,<br />
we will have our task facilitated by the stark<br />
distinction that there will be between the Australian<br />
Labor Party, the Australian Government and the<br />
ideological irrelevant mishmash of our Tory opponents.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, you've had some tough things to<br />
say in the past after the Conference about the<br />
by the Left. What are your views on the Left's<br />
PM: What was the last part.<br />
JOURNALIST: inaudible<br />
PM: Well, I want to say here what I've just said in an<br />
earlier interview and that is that I think that the Left<br />
in Australian politics and within the Australian Labor<br />
Party has very significantly improved its contribution to<br />
the conduct of our affairs over recent years. You will<br />
have heard me say on a number of occasions that the<br />
Parliamentary Party has been more cohesive in recent<br />
years than it has been in living memory. The Left has<br />
played a very responsible part in that process. Going<br />
from the level of Cabinet Ministers, members of the<br />
Ministry through to the Parliamentary Caucus. That's<br />
been reflected out in the Party generally. On this<br />
issue, I think, any objective observation of today's<br />
events would lead you to the conclusion that there was<br />
less heat and less bitterness on the part of the Left on<br />
this than there has been in the past on other issues. As<br />
I've said at the end of the Conference a number of<br />
members of the Left came up to me and said, well done now<br />
let's get on with it. I think that'll be the case. I<br />
think the Left now will feel that, you know, they've<br />
fought their fight. I think they'll play their part now<br />
in ensuring -that these decisions work.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Beazley, just clarification of an<br />
earlier answer. When do you expect the sell-off process<br />
to be underway of the airlines and the restructuring of<br />
telecommunication of a competitor, in telecommunications<br />
to begin?<br />
BEAZLEY: On the airlines I'd expect us to be able to do<br />
a substantial proportion of that in this financial year<br />
and we'd certainly want to conclude it by the end of next<br />
calendar year. In the case of telecommunications, much<br />
depends on the passage of legislation through Parliament<br />
because it is on that that the competitor knows his </p>
<p>' V 9<br />
situation. I would hope to be able to achieve that in<br />
the early part of next year and then complete the tender<br />
process middle to the latter part of next calendar year.<br />
PM: Anything else?<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke are you still proposing to have an<br />
October statement focussing on airlines and<br />
telecommunications? PM: I would expect so.<br />
JOURNALIST: What would be the content of that statement?<br />
How much further would it go than today, for example?<br />
PM: Well we'll be able to flesh out quite a bit by then,<br />
as to the Government's thinking in more detail. It will<br />
be a very significant statement. But that won't<br />
necessarily be the last statement we'll make this year.<br />
JOURNALIST: Will it include other things or just the<br />
e?<br />
PM: It won't necessarily be the last statement. It may<br />
be possible to include other things that are relevant to<br />
microeconomic reform in that October statement. If it's<br />
not possible to do it then I would expect that before the<br />
end of the year there will be another statement which<br />
would go to other matters.<br />
JOURNALIST: Will that be after the Special Premiers'<br />
Conference? PM: I would expect, Nikki, that the first statement<br />
covering the matters that have been dealt with today, to<br />
be made before the Special Premiers' Conference. If I am<br />
not able to have included in that all the things I want<br />
to go to then that there would be another statement<br />
before the end of the year and after the Special<br />
Premiers' Conference. Thank you very much.<br />
ends </p>
