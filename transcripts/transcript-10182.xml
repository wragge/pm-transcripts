I December 1996* TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISER<br />
THE HON JOHN H~ OWARD MEP<br />
ADDRESS AT WA COALITION POLICY LAUNCH<br />
IS MAJESTY'S THEATRE PERTH<br />
Thank you very much klcndy Cowan, to Dr David Honey, the President of fte<br />
Wester Aushralian division of the Liberal Party; Dexter Davies, the President of<br />
the Westcrii Australian National Party-, my umny parlipmeatary colleagues both<br />
Fedcral, and State; ladies and gentemen.<br />
I am both haWp and proud to be here al the launch of the campaign to re-lect<br />
Richard Court as Prmmer of Western Austraa He deserves, and his Governaet<br />
demeres re-election for many reasons, not least of which has been the progressive<br />
but reqxxisible leadership and vision that he has dwsatdsince has clection<br />
onl a few yew ago.<br />
t~ evyone kniows the extramordin ary ms thMt-a h= e-, i nheri-itd. I notice my coutr<br />
in the Federal Parliawast said this moining on television that in Western Anshraia<br />
Labor carries a few burdens. It's a bit lke saying Christopher Skase pinched a few<br />
bob, or Shane. Wa= n plays a bit of cickct. Labo certainly does cary nmy<br />
burdens'in Wester Ausbralia, but more important than the burdens that Labor<br />

curies in Wegten Australia were the burdens that were left behind by the retreatn<br />
LAbor ( kwemment when Richard and Hendy took over.<br />
And the last few years have see prgessive, intelligent, vigorous Government<br />
here in Wcstarn Amftrgaia. It is without doubt the strongest growing Stale in<br />
Australia. It has a youth unemploymeat rat of 20% compared with a national<br />
average of 27% or 29%. It has an un= mnloynwnt rate which is well below Ihe<br />
national averge. It has an ocornoiic growth r= t which is well above the n~ ioWa<br />
average. Theme figures are not accidenta. They wre the result of vwa has been<br />
achieved over the lasn few years. They are the result of a group of mmn and women<br />
1h, rz a diffiult job and finding the courage and vision and thie energy to tackle<br />
Itatzremly difficult task.<br />
Your budt here in Western Australia is now strongly in suplus. You have<br />
resored standards of honesty and aountability in Government You are for the<br />
first time blazing the trail in opening the books so that no more can we have thewe<br />
ridiculous options tha have occurred in the past at election time, both at a State<br />
and Federal level, and I warmaly commend the Wester Australian Coalition<br />
Goverrnent for having done that<br />
But you have Veryitaty through a united Coalition broiagh togedthej<br />
forces of free eterprise and market forces and private prperty in this State. The<br />
coalition between the Libeal Party and the National Party in West= r Australia has<br />
been a % meat success and it proves once again the tUth of the proposition in<br />
Australian politics that when the Liber-al and National parties work together they<br />
win together and that baa been true nationally, it has been true in other States and it<br />
has been, demnstrated-here in Western AUstala.<br />
And finally mnay I say tha you have in Richard Court as your Premier somebody<br />
who is a great fighter for the inerests of Wistern Australia. Whatevez our unity<br />
may be' across the nation as fellow Liberals, when it comes to the intereMt of<br />
Western, Austraia there is no peron anywhere in the country who fights harder for<br />
the particular interests and rails against the particular disabilities that Western<br />
Ajiustzaliaam Sometimes sufer.<br />
Nowy it -As against. -that. background . of. cleaning up the mess, a vimionary<br />
Govarmnt of unitod Coalition purpose and also very effective co-operation with<br />
us at a federal level that I am absolutely delighted to be heme and most particularly<br />
invite you to welcome Richard Court and his wife, Jo.<br />
