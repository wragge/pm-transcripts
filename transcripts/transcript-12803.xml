I am delighted to officially open Australia';s independence gift to the East Timorese people, the National Exhibition and Community Centre in Dili.<br />
This important community facility has been built at the request of the East Timorese and I hope will become a focal point for the Dili community.<br />
Situated in a former market area close to the heart of the city it incorporates an East Timorese Cultural Village and an open-air theatre.  The community centre is designed to be quickly converted for a range of uses as a training centre, community meeting and function centre and a tourism and trade promotion venue.<br />
It';s design and construction has been a cooperative effort, involving skills, materials and expertise from both Australian and East Timorese companies.<br />
Australia has funded site rehabilitation and construction at a cost of $2.5 million.<br />
As part of the celebration of the independence of East Timor the centre is hosting displays from Australia and other donor countries.  The Australian exhibition features photographic and audiovisual displays depicting the partnership between Australia and East Timor in a range of development projects including education, water supply and rural development.<br />
I am sure this gift from the people of Australia to the people of East Timor will be a permanent symbol of the friendship and shared aspirations of our two nations.</p>
