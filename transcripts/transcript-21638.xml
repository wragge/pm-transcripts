    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to announce the appointment of Mr Ian McPhee PSM as Auditor-General following the retirement of Mr Pat Barrett AO.</p>
<p>Mr McPhee, a distinguished public servant, has been a Deputy Secretary in the Department of Finance and Administration since 2003.  In that position, he has been responsible for managing the Financial Management Group and providing policy advice on a wide range of matters, including the budget and financial management framework.  He is a Fellow of CPA Australia and the Institute of Chartered Accountants.  In 2002 he received the Public Service Medal for outstanding public service to public sector accounting and auditing, and the development of industry accounting standards.</p>
<p>Mr Barrett was appointed to the office of Auditor-General in 1995.  During his time as Auditor General, Mr Barrett has served with distinction, promoting public sector accountability and good governance in the federal sphere.</p>
<p>  Mr Barrett's contribution to public administration was recognised in the 1992 Australia Day Honours List when he was made a Member of the Order of Australia.  He was again rewarded in the 2003 Queen's Birthday Honours List when he was made an Officer of the Order of Australia for the promotion of good governance in the public sector.</p>
<p>I would like to thank Mr Barrett for his dedication and commitment as Auditor General and for his outstanding service at senior levels to government and to the Australian Public Service over the past 33 years.  I wish him all the best in his well-earned retirement.  </p>
