PRIME MINITERl TO VISIT iESTERN AUSTRALIA<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Sir Robert Menzies<br />
The Prime Minister, Sir Robert Menzies will make<br />
a short visit to Perth this week to hold talks with the<br />

from a recent operation.<br />
The Prime Minister said today that he proposed<br />
taking advantage of this week's Parliamentary recess to<br />
call on his colleague and discuss some Defence matters.<br />
No particular issues were involved but because of the<br />
importance of Defence generally it would be valuable to<br />
have an exchange of views with the responsible Minister.<br />
Until the appointment last week of the Postmaster-<br />
General, Mr. Hulme, as Acting Minister for D~ efence, the<br />
Prime Minister had been handling Defence matters personally<br />
during Senator Paltridge's illness.<br />
The Prime Minister, accompanied by Dame Pattie<br />
Menzies will fly to Perth from melbourne on Tuesday and<br />
will return to Canberra the following day.<br />
