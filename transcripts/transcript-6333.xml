PROGRAMME The Sattler File, 6KY ( Howard Sattler)<br />
SUBJECT Prime Minister's First Year in Office<br />
DATE Monday 5 March 1.984<br />
SATTLER:<br />
Well today it is appropriately Labour Day in Western Australia,<br />
we're on holidays but at least two people aren't yours truly<br />
and Prime Minister Bob Hawke and he certainly wouldn't be because<br />
today he is celebrating his first twelve months in office. Good<br />
morning Mr Hawke.<br />
PM; Good morning Howard.<br />
SATTLER:<br />
Congratulations. PM: Thank you very much indeed<br />
SATTLER:<br />
Well if you liked your job when I talked to you and I think it<br />
was around the middle of last year about it, how do you feel<br />
about it now?<br />
PM: Well I like it even more. I've been able to I think settle in well<br />
and you've got the satisfaction of seeing it working. ./ 2 </p>
<p>SATTLER:<br />
Well I do detect a few more grey hairs. I wonder if that's a symton<br />
of the worries that go with the job?<br />
PM: No. I don't think so. It's just the natural ageing process, 6ut<br />
the important thing is I've still got them Howard.<br />
SATTLER: ( Laughter) Luckier than most! Your popularity is in no small way<br />
due to your association I would suggest with major sporting<br />
achievements over the year. You were at the America's Cup celebrations<br />
in Perth; Davis Cop tennis final which we won; your Australian<br />
cricket team's victory was the only one in the one day series<br />
over the West Indies; now who deserves the credit for those<br />
appearances you, or your publicity people?<br />
PM:<br />
Oh it's got nothing to do with my publicity people. You know<br />
that ever since I've been a small boy I've been a sports fanat-ic.<br />
But not just a watcher--a player. Over there in Perth I played<br />
first grade cricket with the University for about six years. So<br />
my personal involvement in sport has been a very important part<br />
of my life right from my earliest days in Perth, Howard.<br />
SATTLER: Are you concerned that the polls show that you're much higher<br />
than the whole Government, and I'm wondering whether that's a<br />
healthy reflection of Australians'penchant for voting for the leader<br />
above his party?<br />
PM: Oh well there are two things to say about it. Remember that the<br />
voter support for the Government is higher, I think, than it's been<br />
just about for any other government at 57 per cent--a very high<br />
and healthy figure. But I suppose it's inevitable the way the<br />
media tends to concentrate on the leaders of parties that there<br />
be a bit of a difference between the leader and the party. But the<br />
./ 3 </p>
<p>3<br />
PM: -iportant thing in respect of the Government is it's at a very<br />
high figure.<br />
SATTLER:<br />
Have you consciously adopted a high media profile?<br />
PM: Oh no. I've always regarded it as an obligation since I was President<br />
of the ACTU to be available to the media and to put the point cf<br />
view of those whom you are representing and to be available to their<br />
legitimate questioning. I think you know that that was a characteristi<br />
of my ACTU presidency and I think it's a responsibility that carries<br />
even more say with this position.<br />
SATTLER: Of course you've got to igh that up against the commitment to pouring<br />
over the reams of paper work in your office, don't you?<br />
PM: Well they are not alternatives.-I get everything read. There is<br />
no submission that goes before the Cabinet or the Cabinet Committees<br />
that I haven't read. I think if you check with my officials I'm<br />
assiduous in that respect.<br />
SATTLER: Have you done a speed reading course somewhere along the line?<br />
PM: No not a speed reading course. I just.. can read fairly quickly.<br />
I mean I've taught myself to do that over 0the years.<br />
SATTLER: How do you rate yourself as a parliamentary performer, say compared<br />
with the people we regard as the best of them Menzies and Whitlam?<br />
PM: Oh I don't know. I think it's for others to judge. I think I do<br />
./ 4 </p>
<p>PM; reasonably well there, Although I just.. must say this that I<br />
think that the political commentator. i over the years have tended<br />
to get a quite distorted view of the relative importance of what<br />
happens in Parliament as far as the political scene is concerned.<br />
It's natural enough that parliamentarians and the Press Gallery<br />
because they live fairly incestuously there together in a small<br />
environment think that that environment in which they live together<br />
is where it all happens--what it's all about. It's never a view<br />
that I've shared.<br />
SATTLER:<br />
Does it really matter whether you're a better orator than your<br />
opponent in the House?<br />
PM: Oh it is important to be able to get on top of your Opposition<br />
arid your opposite number. We've been able to do that relatively<br />
easy in this year.<br />
SATTLER: You created some waves that you would be aware of back in Australia<br />
with you speech in Osaka about the necessity to restructure Australian<br />
industry most concern, naturally, was for jobs that could be lost<br />
in the short term now could you briefly explain your concept<br />
about restructuring?<br />
PM:<br />
Well Howard first of all to talk about causing waves, of course that's<br />
not really true. What was caused was a little bit of noise from a<br />
couple of quarters. The fact is that the trade union movement, for<br />
instance, has endorsed absolutely what I said as has business and<br />
all, I think all economic and financial commentators. Now what you<br />
ask me what have we got in mind af) out economic restructuring<br />
well of course you'd need a couple of hours to explain it in detail.<br />
Let me simply make this point. At the end of the 1960s manufacturing<br />
industry provided about 28 per cent of all employment in Australia.<br />
Now it's more like" 18 per cent. In other words that in these last </p>
<p>PM: decades more change has been taking place. It's been taking place<br />
in a way which hasn't been really for the overall good of Australia<br />
it'r happened in a pretty traumatic, hurtful sort of way and<br />
certainly not in a way which has been planned or intergrated, or<br />
most likely to best use our resources, Now what I'm talking"<br />
about is that we've got to have a position where Government in<br />
consultation with industry and trade unions plans for change, so<br />
that we can create a structure of industry here which is going<br />
to be most able to as I put it immesh Australia in with the<br />
region of Asia, Pacific rim, Western Pacific rim which is the<br />
fastest growing economic region in the world today and is going<br />
to be as far ahead as we can see. Now we're part of that region<br />
so the sensible thing is to try and make sure that we have a<br />
structure of industry here which is 4oing to be best able to be<br />
export-oriented in to that region and which enables, also, imports<br />
to come into this country from those regions, from the countries<br />
of those regions in return for what we'll be selling to them.<br />
Now those sort of things are not going to happen by accident.<br />
And when you are talking about restructuring you're saying, therefore,<br />
that some industries that we've got will have to be strengthened<br />
it makes sense to strengthen them others will gradually have to<br />
change and not take so much of our resources and we will have to<br />
build other new ones. Now that's going to mean, Howard, that as<br />
I've put it so often if we say that this sort of a judgement is<br />
necessary in the community interest, as it wil be, then its the<br />
community that has got to help to bear the burden of the cost of<br />
change. We can't just say to some men and women, or some capital<br />
that's employed in a particular industry, ' well, you've got to<br />
run down a bit because that's in the interest of the community'.<br />
The community has got to be prepared to have systems in place like<br />
retraining schemes for labour, relocation assistance, incentives<br />
for capital to go into new industries. The community as a whole,<br />
via the Government, has to have thos-esort of systems in place to<br />
help and assist constructive change. Now in broad terms that's the<br />
pattern of what I'm talking about. The thing I'm happiest about is<br />
that we've really now jumped the hurdle that people, I think, now<br />
understand that these things have got to happen the question now<br />
/ 6 </p>
<p>6<br />
PM: is how we work together to do it.<br />
SATTLER:<br />
What's the alternative if we don't?<br />
PM: The alternative is disaster. Let me put this to you: as things<br />
stand now with the rapid rate of growth in-Singapore that's been<br />
taking place by about 1990 which is not a long time away that<br />
Singapore which Australians have tended to think about as that,<br />
oh that little place there, a few people, where you go and they've<br />
got all these duty-free shops and you can get cheap goods have<br />
tended to think pretty derogatively of it. By 1990 with the<br />
relative rates of growth that are going on their per capita income<br />
will be as high as Australia. Now we shouldn't be frightened about<br />
their increase in income, but what we should be frightened of is<br />
that Australia is relatively by not taking advantage of its<br />
own resources falling further behind and we will. If we don't<br />
make these decisions so that we are going to part of this great<br />
growth in this region then it will grow without us. Now we've<br />
got the great challenge and opportunity of growing with it, of<br />
contributing to their growth and ourselves benefitting from it.<br />
We can do that.<br />
SATTLER: The deficit: that was your biggest headache, I'd suggest, last<br />
year. Are you satisfied that your plans to reduce that are now<br />
in hand?<br />
PM: Yes I am. We won't get the detailed figures until later this<br />
month, Howard, but I am fairly confident that we're going to be<br />
able in this next financial yearr-m-further reduce the deficit.<br />
And I hope to be able to do that also in the context of some<br />
reductions in taxation.<br />
SATTLER: We're all looking forward to that. ./ 7 </p>
<p>-7<br />
I bet we are. ( Laughter)<br />
SATTLER:<br />
What hiccups can you see along t. he way to leading this country out<br />
of recession?<br />
PH: Well obviously we are dependent to some extent upon what happens<br />
overseas. The United States economy is fundamentally important;<br />
for the rest of the world-the rest of the democratic world in<br />
particular and the big question mark in a lot of peoples' minds<br />
is whether the recovery that is still surging on in the United<br />
States is going to have the degree of durability which will mean<br />
positive impacts upon us through prices for exports and so on.<br />
Now that's, therefore, something that we've got to in our whole<br />
calculus say there's therefore a question mark. But as far as<br />
our own internal affairs a re concerned and as far as the decisions<br />
that we can take in regard to our region that I've been talking<br />
about I am confident about all those things. I think the<br />
Australian people have responded to this Government and our<br />
leadership, that they are co-opeirating more together in the<br />
industrial disputation area lower level of disputes than in the<br />
past 15 years. The economic growth is coming back, jobs are<br />
growing. So we can do it out of own reo-ources and our own<br />
attitudes; they are right now I think. And our relations with<br />
the regions are better than they've ever been. So, no hiccups<br />
in regard to the factors over which we can exercise our own<br />
control. The only thing that I rtepeat you've got to have some<br />
sort of question mark about is the United States. But I have<br />
somewhat more confidence about that than perhaps we may have had<br />
a few months ago.<br />
SATTLER:<br />
During the past couple of wreeks you've stepped into two areas of<br />
controversy; medicare and also the pensioner assets test. I'm<br />
wondering why you personally became involved? -/ 8 </p>
<p>PM:<br />
Well let me say this that I think there is a great exaggeration<br />
abott the pr. oble. is coming up at the conference. The facts are<br />
that the clear majority of Labor supporters are thorougbly behind<br />
the Government and they are not going to want a Labor Conference<br />
doing anything which is going to make it unnecessarily difficult<br />
for the Labor Government to do its job. In regard to the areas<br />
that you talked about;. I don't see any great problems. There'll<br />
be some there, for instance, on uranium who would not be happy<br />
with the Government's decision. But I believe the Government's<br />
decision will be endorsed. The fact is of course that this<br />
Government in twelve months in office, Howard, has done more to<br />
implement basic Labor policy than any government in the history<br />
of this country in the same twelve wonth period similar in a<br />
twelve month period.<br />
SATTLER: Eventually do you have to endorse Labor policy which is decided<br />
at that conference?<br />
PM: No. The conference said at the last occasion by way of resolution<br />
that the primary responsibility of the Labor Government is to<br />
restore economic growth, That's it* primary responsibility and<br />
then it's a matter for the Government to determine priorities<br />
in the rate at which effect is given to particular policies.<br />
Now that seems to be an imminently sensible thing for the conference<br />
to have said and we've acting accordingly.<br />
SATTLER: You told me last July that you missed beingaable to mix with<br />
friends you just didn't have the time I'm wondering has that<br />
changed since you've been Prime Minister?<br />
PM:<br />
No it hasn't. It's still something that you miss. But I knew<br />
it was part of the job and, you know that's it. I've never been<br />
one to lament about things that you can't change. Though it's </p>
<p>10<br />
PM: got many other compensations Ho~~ ard.<br />
SATT ER:<br />
What about Mr-s Hawke because she I'm pretty sure I'm right Qfl thishas<br />
already had to give up her Melbourne home to move to Canberra<br />
with you.<br />
PH: Oh no. It wasn't a question of having to give up the MelbournE!<br />
home to move the Canberra. I mean she has been with me all the<br />
time of course, but the question of the Melbourne home was simply<br />
that wa were not getting down there that frequently and it involved<br />
a cost of guarding the place. They have to have police guards over<br />
the homes of Prime Ministers. It involved the best part of a<br />
quarter of a million dollars a year to guard a place that we<br />
were there, YOU know, real~ ly only relatively a few days of the<br />
year. So, we felt we couldn't justify that so we've leased the<br />
place. SATTLER;<br />
Was that a bit of a wrench?<br />
PM:. Oh yes it is in one way, but look, don't let me sort of overstate<br />
it. We are extraordinarily happy. The Lodge is very comfortable.<br />
. We have a beautiful official residence in Sydney when we ' re in<br />
Sydney and when we're in Melbourne we stay in a hotel and it<br />
would be quite stupid of me to sugge'st that we are sufferiing. It<br />
is not we are very comfortable in that sense. Obviously when<br />
you have to lease your own home, I suppose there's somethinga<br />
bit of a tug in there -but I don't exaggerate that.<br />
SATTLER:<br />
Has she redecorated the Lodge?<br />
PM: No. Not redecorated. We've changed s ome pictures, paintings which<br />
. we simply have got mrore of what we prefer now, But, no, I don't<br />
./ 11 </p>
<p>11<br />
PM: think it's a time for, you know, massive expenditures in areas<br />
like that.<br />
SATTLER: In the future has she got a few plans?<br />
PM: Oh she may have down the track, yes, but we've never been ones<br />
for, I think, great ostention in our lifestyle. We've been<br />
able gradually as we've got older to live more comfortably. But,<br />
you know, the Lodge and Kirribillee here in Sydney, are... if people<br />
are not satisfied with the comfort and the context and the<br />
atmosphere of these places well I don't know what would satisfy<br />
them.<br />
SATTLER: Let's just end up on political election talk if we could. Yol,<br />
when you were in Opposition and your colleagues, fairly well<br />
criticised Prime Minister Fraser for fuelling election speculation.<br />
There's been a lot of talk about the next Federal Election. Can<br />
you tell me when it's likely to be and what criteria you are<br />
adopting to make that decision?<br />
PM: Yes. Let me be quite clear about that. What has happened... by<br />
Mr Fraser's decision to call the double dissolution election last<br />
March it threw out of kilter the elections time-table with the<br />
House of Representativesand the Senate. Now under the Constitution,<br />
Howard, we must have a half-Senate election now by about May of<br />
next year because the -enators have to... out of that half-Senate<br />
election, have to take their place by July of ' 85. So there's<br />
got to be an election right around Anstralia for half the Senate.<br />
Now in the past, on 22 occasions that there's been half-Senate<br />
elections, they've had the House of Representatives out as well.<br />
Now what I'm saying is that it seems to me to make sense that<br />
because we've got to have the half-Senate election we should have<br />
the House of Representatives election with it and what I'm thinking<br />
S./ 12 </p>
<p>12<br />
PM: of is that at the same time we would put a referendum proposal whicb<br />
would ensure. for thr future that elections had to simultaneo~ us so<br />
that there wouldn't be any possibility ever in the future of haiving<br />
this multiplicity of elections. Now that seems to me to make sense<br />
and it would be in line with what's happened in thje great MaiorIty<br />
of occasions in the past and we'd be able to guarantee the people<br />
of Australia forever into the future no unnecessary election.<br />
SATTLER:<br />
You made the point that Australians don't like going to the polls<br />
in winter time, so is it fair for me to speculate that sometime<br />
between December and March next year, December 1984 that is, there<br />
will be a Federal Election for the House of Representatives?<br />
PM:<br />
Quite openly that if you're going to have the Rep.,. and the half-Sinate<br />
together and you've got to have the election before May of<br />
that that so-rt of period you're talking about. seems to be the<br />
appropriate one. Now once we've worked out what we think should<br />
happen we'll let the Australian people know. There won't be<br />
any uncertainty about -it. It. seemed to Il've had the obligation<br />
to give this sort Of outline that I have and, then that's the first<br />
thing, then secondly when we're close to making the-decision w2' l1<br />
let-people know so that things can go along their normial course.<br />
SATTLER: You'll give us plenty of notice will you?<br />
PM: I sure will. None of that sort of businesf we had to put up with<br />
last year.<br />
SATTL ER:<br />
Just finally, personally, what's the first. year been like for you-<br />
Bob Hawke for you alone?<br />
PM: Very, very satisfying. Arid it's given me a sense of identity with<br />
./ 13 </p>
<p>13<br />
PM: the Atstralian people I suppose one that I've always had bit<br />
it's a sense of idetity even more, if you like, concretely from<br />
being able to do things and act I think in a way which I hope meets<br />
the aspirat. ions of the Australian people. It's a good feeling.<br />
SATTLER:<br />
What do you want for the next twelve months?<br />
PM: Continued growth and more opportunities, more employment so that<br />
there is more Australians that are going to be able to work and<br />
that all Australians are going to have a happier life. Howard<br />
I've got to go now. Thank you very, very much.<br />
SATTLER: Thanks very much Mr Hawke. It's Labour Day over here in Wester;<br />
Australia, so it's a rather appropriate day to be talking to<br />
you about your first twelve months.<br />
