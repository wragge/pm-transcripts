    <content><![CDATA[<p>In Parliament today (during my absence) a question was asked about a meeting between myself and representatives of Australian pharmaceutical manufacturers.</p>
<p>I did have such a meeting in my electorate office in Gladesville on 10 November last year. As it happens, a number of pharmaceutical manufacturers are based in my electorate, and I have from time to time over the years in my various political capacities, met them.</p>
<p>During that meeting no reference was made to Mr Pat Clear and no representations were made to me about the appointment to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee of an "industry representative".</p>
<p>We had a general discussion about a number of matters of interest and concern to the companies.</p>
<p>A record of interview made at the time discloses that the representatives I met expressed their support for the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme including the need to keep a cap on costs.</p>
<p>The news report on ABC TV tonight incorrectly claimed that I attended a dinner with representatives of the companies. Moreover, that story was compiled and aired without any request for a comment from me or my office.</p>
