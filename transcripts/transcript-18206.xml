I would like to thank Mike Rann for his service to the people of South Australia and Australia as Premier.</p>
<p>Mike has led Labor in South Australia for 17 years  -  almost 10 of them as Premier.</p>
<p>Since 1993, Mike has been a great Labor leader, bringing social inclusion onto the national agenda, sealing negotiations for the expansion of Olympic Dam and providing leadership on tackling climate change.</p>
<p>Mike's legacy will be a stronger, fairer and more sustainable South Australia.</p>
<p>No-one thought South Australia would find a Premier to fill Don Dunstan's shoes, but in Mike we did.</p>
<p>On behalf of all my Federal ALP colleagues, I wish Mike the best of luck.</p>
<p>I also welcome and congratulate the next Premier of South Australia, Jay Weatherill. </p>
<p>Jay and I worked closely together in our former roles as education ministers, and I know that Jay will deliver the energy and leadership that will serve South Australia well into the future. </p>
