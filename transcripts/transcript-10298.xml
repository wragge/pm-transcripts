6 April 1997 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
FEDERAL LEADER'S ADDRESS TO THE<br />
125TH VICTORIAN LIBERAL PARTY STATE COUNCIL<br />
MELBOURNE UNIVERSITY<br />
E&amp; OE<br />
Thank you very much, Richard, for your very kind words of introduction. To Joy<br />
Howley, Ted Baillieu, Tony Staley, my Federal and State Parliamentary colleagues and<br />
fellow Liberals.<br />
Your words of introduction about my persistence, Richard, did remind me very much of<br />
an exchange I had with my predecessor as Member for Bennelong, Sir John Cramer. He<br />
was almost as old as I am now when he first entered Federal Parliament in 1949 and he<br />
didn't retire as the Member for Bennelong until he reached the age of 78 in 1974. About<br />
four years ago I went to the launch of his book and I, as a dutiful book launcher, had read<br />
it. Some don't. And there was some very interesting paragraphs in it about the<br />
foundation of the Liberal Party. And I had a bit of a joke with him before the launch of<br />
the book and said, " John, I hadn't realised you were so pivotal, so crucial and so<br />
intimately involved in the formation of the Party", I said, " there are some names I didn't<br />
expect to see and there are a few names missing". And he said, " my boy, I'm 97 there's<br />
nobody left around to contradict me".<br />
But it is a great delight to be back here and can I just start by repeating the tribute that I<br />
paid to Ted Baillieu last night for the tremendous job that he has done as President of the<br />
Victorian Division, over probably five of the most successful years of its existence. And,<br />
also to very warmly congratulate you Joy and to say that as Leader of the Federal<br />
Parliamentary Party I look forward to years of very close co-operation. I know that the<br />
link between the Parliamentary Party and the Organisation is very important to our<br />
political future and our political survival. And when it breaks down and it when becomes<br />
confused, when it comes ambiguous, then that is when difficulties emerge. </p>
<p>I want to say to you before this State Council meeting that, from my part, I value and<br />
respect very much the role of the Party Organisation in the day to day fortunes of the<br />
Liberal Party. And that applies federally as it does at state divisional level. And I know<br />
the massive contribution that the Victorian Division has made over the years to the<br />
success of the Party here in Victoria and also to the success of the Party nationally.<br />
In acknowledging the presence of my Federal and State Parliamentary colleagues can I<br />
personally wish you, Jim Short, many happy years in Europe. I hope that you and Jan<br />
enjoy and derive very great satisfaction from that posting and I am certain that you will do<br />
a marvellous job as the representative of Australia and as a participant in the constituency<br />
in which Australia is involved on the Board of that particular bank.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, in the weeks and months ahead there are many significant policy<br />
decisions that the Government will need to take. We have now been in office for just over<br />
a year and if you look back and remember the things that we were elected to do, I think it<br />
is fair to say that in all of the major areas we have remained true, we have kept faith with<br />
what we told the Australian people we would do. And in some areas we have, in fact,<br />
delivered more than what we promised and I have in mind the area of small business,<br />
which is so important to the economic future of Australia and has played such a major role<br />
in the development of the economic values and the economic philosophy of the Liberal<br />
Party. We said that we would place an emphasis on small business and we have. We have<br />
changed the industrial relations system. We have throughout Australia made significant<br />
changes through the industrial relations legislation, significant changes to the unfair<br />
dismissal laws to make them more intelligent. And in my small business statement of three<br />
weeks ago I went a step beyond what was in the Industrial Relations Act and I said that<br />
the unfair dismissal law, federally, would not apply to any person who was employed for<br />
less than twelve months by any small business employing fewer than fifteen people.<br />
And I have invited the other State Governments I say the other State Governments<br />
because here in Victoria because of the handing over of the industrial relations<br />
responsibility to the Federal Government the new federal law applies automatically. I've<br />
invited the other State Governments of Australia to duplicate what we are doing at a<br />
federal level. And it would be a very important test of the credentials of all other State<br />
Governments so far as small business concerned as to whether they are prepared to come<br />
on board with this particular proposal.<br />
And I renew today my invitation to the Government's of New South Wales and<br />
Queensland, of South Australia and of Western Australia and Tasmania to enact laws<br />
within their state jurisdictions that will duplicate what we have done federally. And I hope<br />
that they will do so because if we can achieve a uniformity and a comprehensive approach<br />
throughout Australia on this issue then we will deliver another significant benefit to the<br />
small business community. </p>
<p>In the area of capital gains tax it will be the law Australia, after the first of July this year,<br />
that if you sell a small business up to $ 5 million of the proceeds of that sale can be<br />
invested in any business of any kind without incurring any capital gains tax liability. Now<br />
that represents an enormous liberalisation of the capital gains tax law in this country and it<br />
goes far beyond what we promised in the election campaign. And I think it is important<br />
that over the weeks ahead, at a constituency level and at a State division level, we drive<br />
home the value of these benefits. It is very easy for some policy changes and some<br />
reforms to be made and for people to forget about them in short period time. This will<br />
come into operation on the first of July.<br />
And the other thing that will come into operation on the first of July are the tax incentives<br />
for private health insurance something that should have been introduced in Australia five,<br />
or six, or ten years ago. In the early 1990' s Grahame Richardson, and God forbid that I<br />
should draw on Grahame Richardson as an authoritative source of political advice. But he<br />
as the Health Minister in the Hawke Government, in the early 1990' s, when something like<br />
thirty-nine per cent of the Australian population was covered by private health insurance,<br />
he then said that something had to be done to stop the drift of people out of private health<br />
insurance. He warned the Hawke Government that if that wasn't done, if steps were not<br />
taken, then we ran the risk of losing the critical mass that was needed to sustain the<br />
private health insurance system. And, of course, nothing was done.<br />
The ideological hostility of the Labor Party to private provision so far as health is<br />
concerned in this country over rode the common sense of that advice and the net result is<br />
that we now have only thirty-four per cent of Australians who are covered by private<br />
health insurance. And that is making a major contribution to the strain on the public<br />
hospital system of Australia. And even the Labor Premier of New South Wales, Bob<br />
Carr, now says, " oh, it's a terrible problem and something has got to be done about it".<br />
It's a great pity that he had not supported his old mate Grahame Richardson in the early<br />
1990' s.<br />
But, I can promise you that the commitment that we made in the election campaign in the<br />
health area will be delivered in full on the first of July this year when those tax incentives<br />
come into operation. It is another case of having delivered in full, on time, and without<br />
qualification on a promise that we made during the election campaign.<br />
From the beginning of this year, once again, on time, without deduction and in full we<br />
delivered the total measure of our family tax initiative. In many other areas, and I see<br />
David Kemp here today. And David is doing an absolutely magnificent job, not only<br />
looking after the training and apprenticeship area, but he's also got responsibility for work<br />
for the dole.<br />
We said that we would give Australian business and Australian young people a modern<br />
training and apprenticeship system and we are well down the path to doing it. </p>
<p>We have announced the introduction of a work-for-the-dole scheme. And a work for the<br />
dole scheme is based on the very simple principle of mutual obligation. In the kind of<br />
society we have it is our moral responsibility to provide a safety net of support for people<br />
who need it. It's always been a core Liberal principle to look after the needy in our<br />
society. And that means that if people genuinely can't get work they are entitled to<br />
financial support and for living support and daily support from the rest of us. But it is also<br />
fair and right in a society such as ours that having provided that support we are entitled to<br />
ask those people who receive it to do something reasonably in return for that support.<br />
Now, there's nothing outrageous about that. It's not anti Democratic. It's not even, I<br />
understand, against any provisions of the International Labor Organisation. Although for<br />
years and years and years we were told by the sceptics and our opponents, " you can't<br />
have work-for-the-dole, the ILO won't like it." Well, amazingly I find that even the iLO<br />
doesn't object to it. But I wonder whether the Labor Party objects to it. I wonder when<br />
that vote finally comes in June of this year whether the Labor Party will put up his hand<br />
for work-for-the-dole or the Labor Party will join the Australian Democrats and vote it<br />
down. It will be a very, very interesting test of where the Labor Party stands.<br />
But there are many other issues that we have before us. We are fast coming to the time<br />
when a decision will need to be taken on one of the most difficult issues that any<br />
Australian government in modern times has had to confront and that is the collection of<br />
problems thrown up by the decision of the High Court of Australia in the Wik case. I have<br />
to say that that was a very disappointing and a very surprising decision. It was a decision<br />
that ran against the conventional wisdom. It was a decision that was against the<br />
representations directly contained in recitals to the Native Title Act. It was a decision<br />
which ran against the public assurances given by the former Prime Minister, Mr Keating.<br />
It was a decision that ran against public statements made by Aboriginal leaders after the<br />
passage of the 1993 Native Title Act. And it was a decision that has created an enormous<br />
amount of uncertainty and unpredictability for the farmers and the miners of Australia and<br />
has opened up a potential area of endless litigation unless appropriate action is taken.<br />
Now I have over past weeks been in consultation will all of the relevant stakeholders and I<br />
have to say that those consultations by and large have been conducted in an atmosphere of<br />
great goodwill. I remain determined, if I can, to achieve an agreed outcome. I don't<br />
pretend that that is easy. But that process of dialogue cannot go on forever, there has to<br />
be an end point. There can only be an agreed outcome if there is an acceptance by the<br />
indigenous people of Australia that an automatic acceptance of the Wik decision will<br />
create intolerable uncertainty for the pastoralists of Australia. And equally there has to be<br />
an acceptance by other interested parties of the sensitivity of the Aboriginal community to<br />
the notion of extinguishment of title. And within those two bands, within those two areas<br />
of understanding perhaps an agreed outcome that delivers respect for native title, but by<br />
the same token guarantees security, predicability and certainty, and an avoidance of<br />
endless block by block litigation over perhaps 40% to 50% of the land mass of Australia<br />
which is one of the nightmare scenarios thrown up by the decision perhaps between<br />
those two extremities there does lie the possibility of an agreed outcome. And if it can be<br />
achieved, well it would be very important for fuiture relations between different sections of </p>
<p>the Australian community. But if that agreement cannot be achieved then it will be my<br />
intention to make certain recommendations to the Government as to a clear and definite<br />
course of action because it is not a matter that can be allowed to be the subject of endless<br />
discussion and endless negotiation.<br />
We also have ahead of us, of course, the bringing down of the budget in May of this year.<br />
And we are returning to the pattern of the May budget. And already the ERC, under the<br />
direct guidance of Peter Costello and John Fahey, is hard at work.<br />
The budget task that we inherited a year ago was in the dimension of about a 10 billion<br />
deficit on an underlying basis. And it Is important for the maintenance of strong and stable<br />
business conditions that we continue to drive towards getting a surplus in our budget. It is<br />
not an arcane, academic, arid, economic exercise. If you have a budget surplus that has<br />
beneficial effects on interest rates. It's no accident that interest rates have fallen by about<br />
across the board in the last 12 months. And one of the reasons for that has been the<br />
determination of the Government to reduce the deficit and the knowledge by the Reserve<br />
Bank that we now have in power a group of people who are prepared to try and tackle the<br />
size of our deficit, a group of people who are not reluctant to tackle whatever decisions<br />
are needed to achieve that objective. And the task in May, although not of the same<br />
dimension of last year and not the necessity involving the same sort of decisions that were<br />
taken last year, is nonetheless a very difficult exercise and will require the continued<br />
application of the efforts and the energies of senior ministers and of the whole<br />
Parliamentary Party.<br />
Another matter that I want to touch on very briefly is the debate that surrounds the<br />
position of Senator Colston. Senator Colston, as you know, was a member of the<br />
Australian Labor Party. I watched with fascination the Deputy Leader of the Opposition<br />
this morning on the Sunday programme. And he was talking about the events of 1983.<br />
You know, butter wouldn't melt in his mouth. He said, " we were a new government,<br />
Senator Colston was a new member" he'd only been in Canberra for eight years. After<br />
I'd been in Canberra for eight years I felt anything but a new member. And the reality, of<br />
course, is that, as everyone knows, Senator Colston, for a whole combination of reasons,<br />
defected from the Australian Labor Party a few months ago. And the every deed, the<br />
every act, the every motivation of the Australian Labor Party over recent months has, in<br />
the openly confessed words and approach of Senator Ray, been driven by tribal revenge,<br />
nothing else. It's got nothing to do with concern for the taxpayers' money. It's got<br />
nothing to do with proprieties, it's got everything to do with doing in the eye a bloke you<br />
reckon ratted on your party. It's as simple as that. Senator Ray, to his credit, at least has<br />
been honest enough to say so and honest enough to admit that he's not very nice in<br />
pursuing the vendetta.<br />
And then of course that other group that has had a lot to say about Senator Colston is, of<br />
course, the Australian Democrats. Now their motivation, ladies and gentlemen, has been<br />
driven not so much by revenge but by pique the feeling that they're no longer as relevant </p>
<p>as what they were a few months ago and no longer as relevant as what they would like to<br />
be. So in all that is said I think we ought to keep this in mind.<br />
But let me make it very clear to you, as a number of us have made clear in the past, that<br />
my Government will not tolerate any abuse of parliamentary privileges by any Senator or<br />
member no matter what party that person belongs to.<br />
We are following due process with Senator Colston. But as many in this audience will<br />
know, due process is sometimes slow process but that is the nature of our system. And I<br />
repeat the assurances that I've given in the past, that when he has responded as he is<br />
required to do by about the middle of this month to the allegations that have been made<br />
and when all of them are looked at together all of them if the advice we receive from<br />
amongst other sources, the Attorney-General's Department, is that the matter could<br />
involve a breach of the law then we will not hesitate, indeed, I will insist that the matter be<br />
sent to the Australian Federal Police for investigation.<br />
Now that is our position and there can be no ambiguity about that. My attitude all along<br />
has been that we're not going to do any favours for anybody when it comes to the law of<br />
this country. Equally though, we are not going to allow somebody for a combination of<br />
reasons to be denied due process and to be denied the presumption of innocence. That<br />
has never been our way and we won't allow it to happen in relation to Senator Colston.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen there are just two other things that I want to say to you this<br />
morning. The first of those is that, as Richard Alston said in his very kind introductory<br />
remarks, the last year has been a very successful year for the Liberal Party. It's not only<br />
been electorally successfully. You here in Victoria have the enormous pleasure of sharing<br />
our great Federal victory on the 2nd of March last year but you also had the experience of<br />
the exhilarating re-election of the Kennett Government only a few weeks later.<br />
But throughout Australia there has been a change. We have kept faith with the major<br />
commitments that we made to the Australian people. We have dumbfounded our critics<br />
on many fronts. We were told by our critics that we couldn't deal with the nations of the<br />
Asian-Pacific region. Quite the opposite. We have established a new basis of pragmatic<br />
understanding with many of those nations based, as I said in Beijing, on the twin pillars of<br />
mutual benefit and mutual respect. The only way to build a proper relationship between<br />
Australia and another nation is on the basis of mutual respect. I respect the right of other<br />
nations to decide the way in which they govern their affairs but equally I require of them<br />
that they respect the right of the Australian people to run their affairs according to our<br />
assessment of what is in the interests of the Australian people. And I can tell you one<br />
thing, I did many things in Beijing and Shanghai but there's one thing I didn't do in either<br />
of those cities and one thing I will never do when I go abroad as your representative, I<br />
didn't think out aloud about the constitutional future of my country. Nor did I denigrate<br />
the symbols and the emblems of my country. Nor did I yield an inch on important<br />
democratic values such as press freedom. </p>
<p>I mean, all of us in politics occasionally, so I've observed, get a little irritated at the press<br />
coverage we receive. But let us never forget that the real guarantees of freedom in this<br />
country are not in what is written down or ought to be written down in a constitution or a<br />
Bill of Rights and as [ yve said on other occasions, I am no great believer in a Bill of<br />
Rights, I'm a common law man through and through. What are the really great guarantors<br />
of freedom in this country are a vigorous parliamentary democracy, and we certainly have<br />
that, an incorruptible judiciary, and we certainly have that, and a vigorous, open, sceptical<br />
and free press. And however much it may on occasions aggravate us it still remains a<br />
bedrock of our democratic society. And it's one of the things that distinguishes Australia<br />
from many other societies and it's one of those great western liberal inheritances that we<br />
have in common with other societies around the world.<br />
And I can say to you ladies and gentlemen that our relationship with the most populous<br />
nation on earth, China, is on a sound and sensible footing. I didn't come back wrapped in<br />
euphoria. I didn't start emotionally talking about a new special intimate relationship. I<br />
didn't say that that country had things that could put us to shame any more than I said we<br />
have things that could put it to shame. But I sought when I was there to do one thing and<br />
that was to advance the national interest of Australia, to identify, the things that we had in<br />
common, to recognise that there are enormous economic opportunities because it is the<br />
biggest country in the world and it is experiencing an annual growth rate of the<br />
unbelievable level of between 10% and 15% a year. And the transformation that is<br />
occurring in the major cities of China is on a scale that few people could even comprehend<br />
let alone have experienced. So it is very important that we be part of that. And I took<br />
with me the most senior business delegation, the most senior combination of men and<br />
women in Australian business that have ever travelled abroad with an Australian Prime<br />
Minister. And all the members of that delegation are household names in the world of<br />
business in Australia. And for the first time you saw the Australian Government and the<br />
business community of Australia working together in a cooperative partnership in the<br />
largest nation in the world advancing the interests of Australia and seeking to achieve<br />
business understanding with that vast nation. And in that practical way we have made an<br />
enormous contribution to the economic future and a sound and sensible relationship<br />
between Australia and the Republic of China.<br />
The last thing that I want to say to you ladies and gentlemen is that one of the ingredients<br />
of our success over the last 12 months is that we have sought and I think to a large<br />
measure have achieved our goal of retaining contact with the Australian people. We have<br />
not allowed ourselves to get remote from their concerns. We have retained contact with<br />
the Liberal Party Organisation. We have retained contact with the small business<br />
community. We have retained contact with those tens of thousands of traditional blue<br />
collar Labor voters who deserted the Keating government in March of last year and saw in<br />
us a group of men and women who better represented their aspiration and their hopes and<br />
their values as members of the Australian mainstream than any other political force in<br />
Australia. And I count that as one of the proudest achievements and the greatest<br />
achievements of my Government over the last 12 months that we have kept faith with the<br />
mainstream. We haven't allowed ourselves to become a remote elitist party. I mean, one </p>
<p>of the most constantly battling things to me in the lead up to the last election was the<br />
extent to which many of the commentators and much of the media continued to talk of the<br />
Liberal Party in that rather cliched fashion as being the party of privilege and the party of<br />
elitism. Yet in reality for five or six years before the change of government last March the<br />
new elitists, the new plutocrats of Australian politics, the new people who were remote<br />
from the views of mainstream Australia had in fact become the Australian Labor Party. It<br />
is they who, with their so called big picture, had got remote from the values and the<br />
aspirations of the mainstream of the Australian community. It was our capacity to identify<br />
with those people. It was our capacity to fashion policies that serve the interests and the<br />
values of those people. It was our capacity to understand their basic concern for the<br />
future of their families, their living standards, their basic patriotic decency, their concern<br />
about day-to-day issues, not issues of long term debate and potential divisiveness. It was<br />
all of those things that helped to achieve the result that we achieved on the 2nd of March.<br />
And I think our capacity to do that over the last year has been of enormous benefit.<br />
And in the process of doing that I want to thank all of you for the tremendous support and<br />
loyalty that you have given to me. I want to thank all the members of my Federal<br />
Parliamentary team for their understanding and support and their trust and their<br />
confidence over the past year. In all of my political life I have never taken anything for<br />
granted. I have said before and I'll say it again today that I would never have been leader<br />
of the Parliamentary Liberal Party and certainly not Prime Minister of Australia without<br />
the understanding and support of the Liberal Party Organisation. I am and remain a<br />
creature of the Liberal Party Organisation. I believe in it. I believe in the contribution that<br />
it has made to the building of this country. I believe in the volunteer effort of the men and<br />
women of the Liberal Party who year after year have kept our party together while those<br />
of us who are fortunate enough to have parliamentary office have occasionally enjoyed<br />
some of the limelight of politics. But you are the people, you are the backbone and you<br />
are the stuff of which long term political success has always been made. I remain<br />
conscious of that. I thank you for that and I look forward to a continuation of that<br />
partnership in the years ahead. Thank you very much. </p>
