I PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
LAND MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE.<br />
I am pleased to announce that the Federal Government will establish a Land<br />
Management Taskforce to investigate ways to improve the adoption and use<br />
of property management plans by the farm sector.<br />
The impact of the severe drought in large areas of Queensland and northern<br />
NSW has highlighted the need for improved property management practices.<br />
The drought has also highlighted the need for all levels of government, and<br />
other sectors such as the banks, to tailor their programs and services to<br />
enhance sustainable production and resource protection in the rural sector.<br />
The application of an effective property management plan is the best way to<br />
prepare for, and deal with, drought and to manage our land and water<br />
resources over the longer term.<br />
But a majority of farm businesses continue to operate without integrated<br />
management tools. A 1992-93 ABARE survey of land management practices<br />
found that approximately 80 per cent of broadacre farmers and 90 per cent of<br />
dairy farmers did not possess a farm plan with information on soil and land<br />
capacity. The Commonwealth considers the increased use of property planning would<br />
achieve greater integration of economic and ecological and regional decision<br />
making by the farm sector.<br />
The Commonwealth also considers there is scope for increased use of<br />
property management planning by the banking sector in determining risk and<br />
viability of farm businesses.<br />
The taskforce will be asked to develop a strategy to encourage the use of<br />
appropriate property management planning in the farm sector. </p>
<p>It will also investigate means through which public and private sector<br />
organisations servicing this sector can ensure their programs and services<br />
enhance the development and application of farm management plans.<br />
The membership of the taskforce will be drawn from the farm and financial<br />
sectors, government and experts with landcare experience.<br />
The taskforce will report to me by 30 May 1995.<br />
The Taskforce will:<br />
1. Examine the extent of property management planning and implementation<br />
and identify options for improving adoption<br />
2. Investigate the scope of property management planning to advance<br />
sustainable production in Australian farming<br />
3. Identify means by which property management planning can assist in the<br />
development of farm business strategies and operations<br />
4. Examine the scope for increased linkages between property management<br />
planning and catchment based or regional plans<br />
Review the relationship between property management planning and the<br />
provision of government programs and advise on options for further<br />
integration where appropriate<br />
6. Examine the scope for financial institutions to incorporate property<br />
management planning in assessments of long term farm viability and<br />
lending policies.<br />
The taskforce will be assisted by a small secretariat based in the Department<br />
of Primary Industries and Energy.<br />
