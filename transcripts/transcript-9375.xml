    <content><![CDATA[<p>Thank you very much for the invitation to open this International Conference, the centre-piece of the celebration of the Centenary of Women's Suffrage in Australia.</p>
<p>Australia was a pioneer in women's rights. It is surprising, really, that among the facts of Australian history, this one is less yell known than Ned Kelly, who was a horse-thief, and Phar Lap, who was a horse.</p>
<p>I am all for icons like these. But I do think that it would be at least as salutary and uplifting if all Australians knew that their country had pioneered the rights of woman.</p>
<p>It would remind us that one of the defining<br />characteristics of Australia is social progress.<br />It would signal that our attachment to democracy and<br />fairness is as deep as any attachment, as a nation, we<br />feel. It might demonstrate to the unknowing and the<br />unconverted that the Australian character, which is<br />said to have been born in the 1890s, was not quite so<br />chauvinistically male as generally believed.<br />And it would reassure the doubters that the decisions<br />we in the Labor Party have taken in recent years and<br />recent weeks maintain an Australian tradition.<br />All but obscured for long periods grown over with<br />prejudice and myopia, and with events like two World<br />Wars which tended to create or re-assert male national<br />stereotypes the thread is there.<br />I hope this conference will uncover more of the thread.<br />I hope it will be seen as a step along the way to an<br />Australia where the rights of women are uncontested,<br />unambiguous, inalienable. 2219</p>
<p>2<br />Rem in South Australia in 1894, women fought for and<br />von two fundamental rights the right to vote and the<br />right to stand for Parliament. erta tho riuht to<br />vote by the new Federal Government in 1902, it was in<br />no small way attributable to the victory in South<br />Australia eight years before.<br />I say 9mot Australian womenft advisedly. Aboriginal<br />and Torres Strait Islander women were denied the rights<br />they had earlier gained in South Australia and they<br />didn't get these rights back until 1962.<br />That is one of the more notorious facts of Australian<br />history and it should not be forgotten.<br />About nine months ago, I opened the Women Power and the<br />21st Century Conference in Melbourne: many of you here<br />today may have participated in this Conference. I said<br />then that the fact that our national parliament was<br />still overwhelmingly sale was the great flaw in<br />Australian democracy.<br />I went on to say that in a country renowned for its<br />democrtic spirit, it was a sad fact that the party<br />which has always seon itself as embodying that spirit<br />has a record which is only marginally better than the<br />rest. Last year, I called an the Labor Party to begin to<br />reinvigorate itself: to widen its membership, to open<br />its form, to find a better process for selecting<br />candidates and, zast importantly of all to ensure a<br />much mome active participation by many more women.<br />We koew there were barrierv to this, and you all know<br />how strong those barriers can be.<br />I said nine months ago that getting the barriers down<br />required political power and political will.<br />It is a matter of great pride to ae that the ALP has<br />taken up the challenge not just in word, but in deed.<br />The ALP has agreed that women will be Labor candidates<br />for at-least 35 per cent of vi=: nable seats by 2002.<br />Ind I ' m pleased to add that yesterday Federal Cabinet<br />reaffirmed its comMitzent to have equal representation<br />of men and women as Government appointments on<br />Comonwealth boards by the year 2000.<br />To meet this target, Cabinet backed a strong and<br />comprehensive strategy. All Ministers will be looking<br />at the situation in their own portfolios and taxing<br />practical steps to boast women's representation.<br />~ 2 2 2</p>
<p>We will also be encouraging the other agencies who<br />nominate people to these boards the states, unions,<br />businesses and so on to nominate an equal<br />representation of women.<br />It is worth looking at the reasons for the changes we<br />are making.<br />First, it is about leadership and talent.<br />As a nation and as a democracy, we simply cannot afford<br />to lose the skills, experience, energy and outright<br />talent of half our population. We need women like<br />Carmen Lawrence, Joan Kirner and Rosemary Follett, and<br />many more like them, in our parliaments.<br />We need than in our businesses, too. I hope corporate<br />Australia has taken note of what is happening. It has<br />been happening in the co ity for a very long time.<br />It has been happening in families, schools and<br />universities, farms, factories and offices. Women have<br />been making an equal very often much more than equal<br />contribution to the economy and society for a very<br />long time. It is nov happening in our parliaments.<br />It really ought to be happening in board-rooms.<br />We need women to be full participants in the great<br />national debates and in national decision-making.<br />We need their contribution to economic, social and<br />cultural policy; to information policy, human rights,<br />foreign affairs, to finding a just reconciliation<br />between indiqenous and non-indigenous Australians, to<br />an Australian Republic.<br />We need womn to bring to these forums not simply their<br />experience an women, we need them to bring thei<br />judgements about Australia; their feelings about<br />Australia. I was struck by what Poppy King had to say in Sydney<br />recently at the seminar The Australian Republican<br />Movement A Women's Perspectivem.<br />She said: Women should not become involved in the debate<br />with the one agenda of " women's issues". Women<br />should become involved because we are living,<br />breathing, thinking individuals, an integral part<br />of the population that makes up this country. we<br />have opinions, ideas and solutions that are<br />worthvhile when deciding on issues that affect all<br />Australians and, after all, the republic is not a<br />gander issue it's an Australian one. 2? 221</p>
<p>We need women as full participants in decision-makinq,<br />simply because we need to make the right decisions.<br />We adopted afftirative action in the Labor Party<br />e i iot and' riaht and because we<br />believe in merit and ability.<br />I think it is tim that ve challenged the platitude<br />that the existinq system, whatever it is and however<br />discriminatory its outcoes might be, somehow<br />represents decision-makinq on merit.<br />I don't believe it. And I'm sure many of you don't<br />believe it either.<br />I don't believe that, on any real assessment of<br />ability, only 10 percent of women have the qualities<br />necessaxy to be a member of our House of<br />Representatives. I don't believe that only 22 percent or women have the<br />ability to be Members of the Senate.<br />And I don't believe that only 3 percent of women have<br />the capacity to be members of this country's private<br />sector boards eitbwr.<br />I think that ability is important. And that is why I<br />called for the affirmative action rule changes in the<br />Australian La Party.<br />We moved to aff irmative action for the other good<br />reason that we must demonstrate to young women to<br />those who will come after us that they have a real<br />opportunity to contribute to decision-making.<br />This country is changing.<br />By our own efforts and imagination and confidence we<br />are reshaping Australia.<br />The deepest cynic could not deny that we have made<br />enormus strides in recent times.<br />We are building a tolerant, cohesive, culturally<br />diverse society.<br />We are establishing a dynamic role in the region, a<br />creative and rewarding role in the global community.<br />We are more comfortable with our role in the world and,<br />I sincerely believe, more confident and assured about<br />our future.<br />I vould like to think that a lot of Australians are<br />beginning to share a sense of excitement.<br />2222</p>
<p>We have dramatically expanded our secondary and higher<br />education systems. The increased participation of women<br />and girls in education is just as dramatic.<br />f. TOa.-rv l abour market orocrams and our<br />vocational training systems.</p>
<p>We are strengthening our health and social security<br />systems and reforming our aged care services.<br />We are making child care more affordable and more<br />available.</p>
<p>We are making the Sex Discrimination Act even stronger,<br />by tackling such issues as indirect discrimination.<br />I have absolutely no doubt that these changes in<br />Australia are due in significant ways to the ideas and<br />energy floving from the increasingly prominent role and<br />status of vomen.</p>
<p>Nor do I have any doubt that the changes will be more<br />profound and the future more exciting as their role<br />grows. Women have been a major driving force for these<br />changes. And part of the reason for this is that<br />Australia has been able to bring a genuine commitment<br />to vomen's equality into our practical policy and<br />program development.</p>
<p>I am very proud that Australia is internationally<br />recognised as a world leader in integrating status of<br />women issues into the practical business of government.<br />But we realise that this means continuing to work for<br />positive change.</p>
<p>For example, this year we celebrate the<br />anniversary of the Sex Discrimination Act with a range<br />of amendments to expand it and strengthen its impact.<br />The Act was a major milestone for the status of<br />Australian women. But for younger women it is already<br />rather like the vote an everyday fact of life.<br />Survey research shove that young women think very<br />differently from their mothers and grandmothers.<br />Ninety-five percent of young women surveyed expect<br />equal pay. Only 6 percent thought their lives were<br />less satisfying than young men of the same age.<br />Around 83 percent want to have a family of their own<br />AND a paying job interestingly, the younger age<br />groups held this view much more strongly. And 93<br />percent thought men and women ought to do an equal<br />share of the housework.</p>
<p>But there was another side to the young women's<br />responses. T-4: in rryet thouatit they had been treated<br />unfairly because of their genaer.<br />The younger age groups ( the 18 to 24 year olds)<br />generally thought that women got a fair go at work, but<br />in the 25 to 30 age group, just under 50 percent<br />thought women at work did not get treated fairly.<br />It seems that more experience in the workforce can<br />include some sad surprises. Clearly, there is some way<br />to go in ensuring women do not experience<br />discrimination in the workplace.<br />Most fundamentally, nearly 70 percent thought that<br />their own lives were more satisfying than their<br />mothers' lives and this squares with other research<br />findings. If the notion of equality is something that young women<br />nov take as a given in their lives, we have come a long<br />way. And it is exactly the reason why governments cannot sit<br />on their hands. We have a responsibility to respond to<br />this generation and to recognise the place of the next.<br />We celebrate our history, and we build for the future.<br />We recognise that woman's gains over the last 100 years<br />have been of profound benefit to all Australians, to<br />the quality of society, to the life of the nation.<br />The story of the struggle to win those reforms is a<br />rich part of our history.<br />The first chapter was written h 100 years ago. It<br />is my hope that in the next few years we can write some<br />big cbapters of our ovn and, if the story is still not<br />colete, that at least we will enter the next century<br />agreed on what the ending should be.<br />I hope that not just the struggle but the reality of<br />women's rights, women's role and women's status are<br />part of our democratic consciousness-a part of our<br />identity. Your Conference, and the celebrations of the centenary<br />of women's suffrage in Australia, is a step towards<br />that end and I thank you for inviting me to speak.<br />It is nov my privilege to declare this International<br />Conference open.<br />2224</p>
