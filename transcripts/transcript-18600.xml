Three young Indigenous Australians have been given the opportunity to study at Oxford and Cambridge, after being named as recipients of Charlie Perkins Scholarships.</p>
<p>As of two years ago, there had never been an Indigenous Australian studying for an undergraduate or postgraduate degree at either of these British universities.</p>
<p>In 2010, Paul Gray and Christian Thompson were the inaugural scholarship recipients and the first Indigenous students to study at Oxford.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Julia Gillard, Minister Evans and Minister Macklin congratulated the three students and their families at a morning tea held in Parliament House today.</p>
<p>The three Charlie Perkins Scholarships recipients for 2012 are:</p>
<p>•           Lilly Brown, 26, finishing Honours in Indigenous Studies at the University of Melbourne. She has been accepted to a Masters degree in Politics, Development and Democratic Education at Trinity College, Cambridge. She will be the first indigenous Australian to study an undergraduate or postgraduate degree at Cambridge.</p>
<p>•           Krystal Lockwood, 25, has completed her Criminology and Criminal Justice degree with first class honours at Griffith University. She will study a Masters of Evidenced Based Social Intervention at Green Templeton College, Oxford.</p>
<p>•           Kyle Turner, 27, received first class honours in his Bachelor's degree in Archaeology Practice and a Masters of Applied Epidemiology from the Australian National University. He has been accepted to the Doctor of Philosophy in Public Health at Jesus College, Oxford.</p>
<p>These three outstanding Indigenous students have already achieved so much in their chosen fields of study, and will now have the opportunity to continue their studies overseas.</p>
<p>The Charlie Perkins Scholarships give students the opportunity to become leaders, not only in their field but in the broader community.</p>
<p>The scholarships were launched in 2009 in memory of Aboriginal leader and activist Dr Charlie Perkins - the first Indigenous Australian man to graduate from university.</p>
<p>The Gillard Government today announced $200,000 for the Charlie Perkins Scholarships, to support this year's scholars overseas and to provide funding for three Roberta Sykes scholarships which will be announced later this year.</p>
<p>The British Government, Rio Tinto, the Pratt Foundation, the Cambridge Commonwealth Trust, the Cambridge Australia Trust and The McCusker Foundation are also generous supporters of the Charlie Perkins Scholarships. </p>
