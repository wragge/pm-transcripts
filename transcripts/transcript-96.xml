ADDRESS TO CONVOCATION<br />
BY THE PRIME MINISTER ( THE RT. HON. R. G. MENZIES9 Q C M. P.)<br />
AT A GRADUATESt EVENING IN THE~ GREAT HALL OF THE UNIVERSITY* 6F<br />
SYDNEY, FRIDAY, AUGUST 28, 1959.<br />
I am much honoured by your invitation to deliver what you<br />
are pleased to describe as the Annual " Oration" to Graduates of<br />
this great and famous University,,<br />
I was flattered some little time back to be made one of<br />
your graduates causa honoris an agreeable expression which in<br />
one blow gets rid of th obligation to pass examinations and<br />
adorns one with unearned but delightful academic splendour. I<br />
wish that I could repay your courtesy by offering to you an<br />
address profound but engaging, the product of weeks of quiet<br />
reflection in the company of my books and my thoughts. But for<br />
a Prime Minister in a vigorously political community this does<br />
not prove possible. Some of you may recall that in one of his<br />
speeches during the war, Winston Churchill made a glancing<br />
reference to Australia, where, he said, " politics seemed to be<br />
carried on with a fine 18th century vigour".<br />
There are certainly, for me, other problems to be<br />
wrestled with, and preparations to beomade for much less academic<br />
controversies. What I have to say to you, therefore, will be<br />
somewhat discursive and occasional. B3ut here and there, I hope<br />
there may emerge some ideas which represent the Views of a man,<br />
himself a University graduate by examination, who has been<br />
privileged to have something to do with Universities and the<br />
attitude of Governments towards them,,<br />
In Australia. the intense interest of Governments and<br />
Parliaments in universities is comparatively modern. When I was<br />
a student at the University of Melbourne I once heard a Member<br />
of Parliament refer to it as " a bear-garden of the idle rich",<br />
a quaint expression which even then, as I contemplated myselfland<br />
my fellow students, seemed both stzange and. wonderf'ul.<br />
When I was Attorney-General of the.-State of' Victoria, I<br />
introduced into Parliament the legislation which, for the first<br />
time, created the office of Vice-Chancellor of the Melbourne<br />
University. Many years later, as Prime Minister, I had the great<br />
privilege of setting up the Murray Committee, of securing the<br />
assent of Cabinet to the adoption of its recommendations, and of<br />
seeing them put into legislative and administrative effect. As<br />
I extract some personal pride from these later developments, I<br />
propose to say something about them.<br />
In 1956, having conceived the idea of an authoritative<br />
committee of investigation, I saw Sir Keith Murray in London. He<br />
was and is the Chairman of the University Grants Committee in<br />
Great Britain. I pointed out to him that while the Commonwealth<br />
had, except in respect of its direct Territories, no comprehensive<br />
legislative authority with respect to education, it did have power<br />
to make grants to the ScL-ates, and that such grants might be made<br />
for specific purposes and subject to such conditions as the<br />
Commonwealth Parliament might think proper, With the co-operation<br />
of Mr. Harold Macmillan, who was then Chancellor of the Exchequer,<br />
and was therefore the Minister to whom-thte University Grants<br />
Committee was responsible, Sir Keith Murray made himself available.<br />
We associated with him a strong group, consisting of the late Sir<br />
Ian Clunies Ross, Professor Charles Morris from Great Britain,<br />
Sir Alexander Reid of Western Australia, and Mr. Richards, a<br />
university graduate on th. e staff of the Broken Hill Pty. Co. </p>
<p>The Committee was given a very broad charter. it<br />
conducted the most intensive investigations and it made<br />
recommendations, the adoption of which Iventure to say, has<br />
opened up a new era in the history of he Australian Universities,<br />
In the course of its report upon the role of the<br />
Universities in the community, the Committee drew attention to<br />
certain important considerations which are, I believe, at the<br />
root of any proper examination of the place and functions of<br />
university training.<br />
A few of these aspects deserve particular mention, since<br />
we must constantly have them in mind if we are to keep the<br />
problem in proper perspective.<br />
The first is that the modern complexity of life and the<br />
increasingly complex nature of Australian economic development<br />
require a very large increase in the supply of highJly educated<br />
people. It is only in comparatively recent years that commerce<br />
and industry have felt the need for more university graduates.<br />
Public administration calls for more graduates. The pressure for<br />
a greater concentration upon research calls for more graduates.<br />
The growing need for more and more precision of thought and<br />
analysis requires the trained minds which it is the function of<br />
universities to produce. If all these needs are to be satisfied<br />
then it becomes essenti a! that our uni ' arsities should be able to<br />
provide accommodation and instruction and facilities for a<br />
rapidly increasing number of students0<br />
In the second place, as the Committee pointed out, " fIt<br />
is the function of the University to offer not merely a technical<br />
or specialised training but a full and -true education befitting a<br />
free man, a ci-ifizen ol" a free country'?<br />
I have had a good deal to say about this on other<br />
occasions, but I take the opportunity of reiterating that there<br />
is danger for the world if technologists and scientists should be<br />
too narrowly trained, so that th-ey become less fitted to accept<br />
their enormous social : cesponsibilities, It is one of the marks of<br />
the current century that i. while magnificcnt skil. and a degree of<br />
scientific investigation amounting almost to genius have presented<br />
us year by year with more an~ d more material miracles, there is no<br />
evidence that we understand hiinan bein~ gs any botto_ or that<br />
wisdom has marched with knowledge,, Indeed it is the greatest<br />
paradox of the 20th century that with all its superb cleverness it<br />
has been marked by more violence and hatred and bar-barism than any<br />
other century since the Middle Ages.<br />
The third principle is that while education by teaching<br />
must be one of the great objects of a great university, it has an<br />
equal responsibility for research, This, of course,~ means that<br />
the universities must attract and encourage brilliant men and<br />
women to whom the function of discovery is a vocat: Lcn of an<br />
absorbing kind, limited neither by the clock nor by undue<br />
concentration upon material rewards.<br />
The fourth principle is that a good university should be<br />
a guardian of intellectual standards and intellectual integrity.<br />
This, of course, involves a consideration of w. thas been called<br />
" academic freedom". There may be some who think that this<br />
expression connotes q. freedom from all restraints or from the rDrmal<br />
rules which govern ordinary people, This is a misconception,<br />
" Academic freedom" connotes the absence of external or political<br />
compulsion upon the mind, it means that the search for truth must<br />
not be controlled. by any authority other than the integrity of the<br />
mind and spirit of the searcher, </p>
<p>I have no particular respect for university teachers or<br />
researchers who think it good that they should accormmodate their<br />
work and ideas to their previously formed political alignments;<br />
because, if they do so, they will introduce a tendentious<br />
character into their work which will deprive it of objectivity<br />
or authority and will tend to distract them from the unobstructed<br />
investigation of the scientific or other facts.<br />
By the adoption of the Murray report and the provision<br />
of the very large sums of money involved in this adoption, we have<br />
at any rate put the universities in the way of having better paid<br />
staffs, more adequate accommodation, more up-to-date technical<br />
equipment and greater general capacity for improving the essential<br />
contact between teacher and student which has been increasingly<br />
sketchy in recent years. One process of improving has, however,<br />
been going on for some time. I can myself remember the heated<br />
debates which used to occur about whether university graduates<br />
ought to be given some special admission to the Civil Service<br />
instead of having to start at the bottom rung of the ladder,<br />
with no further intellectual training than is afforded by the<br />
passing of the Leaving Examinations at the schools.<br />
Slighting references used to be made about the " academic"<br />
mind, as if a University degree, hard-earned it, most cases,<br />
detached its possessor from the realities of ordinary life.<br />
Relatively few graduates reached high administrative posts;<br />
comparatively few entered Parliament. The position in these<br />
respects has materially improved. Great organisations are eagerly<br />
looking for graduates. Many of the leading men in the Civil<br />
Service are graduates. In my own Ministry, there are no less than<br />
12 Ministers, including myself, who have university degrees.<br />
All this means that the universities have come closer to<br />
the community and that the community is getting increasing benefit,<br />
even in the most practical terms, from their existence and their<br />
work. There is another aspect of University training to which<br />
I should interpolate a brief reference. When I established an<br />
earlier committee to make a quick report which gave rise to the<br />
system of Commonwealth university grants now so enormously<br />
expanded as a result of the Murray recommendations, I made a<br />
special point to the Committee that I wished some portion of their<br />
recommendations to be in relation to residential colleges. Ever<br />
since then we have made increasing provision for these colleges.<br />
For some strange reason, there was a certain resistance to these<br />
ideas, based upon the fact that many of the residential colleges<br />
are Church foundations and therefore have a religioiz background.<br />
" Why," it was said, " should the State subsidise any Church<br />
activity?" Without endeavouring to open up the much wider question,<br />
which has been so hotly debated for a long time in respect of<br />
church schools I would like to say that in the case of the<br />
universities, ihe whole criticism seemed and seems to me to be<br />
based upon a misconception of the true nature of university<br />
training. A student in a residential college '-as a great<br />
advantage, if he has the right point of view. He lives constantly<br />
in a community of scholars and of students. In addition to the<br />
normal attendance at class or in the laboratories, he has right<br />
through the days and the weeks and the months, the opportunity of<br />
discussion of informal talk, with men much better informed than<br />
himself,. A thus has the opportunity of securing an education<br />
" in the round". And it is exactly this broad and humane education<br />
which the world lacks most, and the comparative absence of which<br />
has so marred the history of the century. </p>
<p>Before I leave the Murray Committee I should say something<br />
of a recommended but most significant development.<br />
In their report, Sir Keith Murray and his colleagues took<br />
a long range look at the future. Realising as they did that their<br />
financial recommendations which were very substantial) would<br />
cover a limited period of time, they came to the conclusion that<br />
there should be appointed a permanent Australian University Grants<br />
Committee. As this Committee ( under another name -to which I will<br />
refer a little later) has now been appointed under Statute and<br />
much of the future of our Universities will, I hope, be inhuenced<br />
by its advice, I will at once remind you of the reasons which led<br />
the Murray Committee to recommend its creation.<br />
In effect, there were six reasons<br />
1. The Murray Committee had concentrated its work into a few<br />
months. I accept responsibility. Art is long, but political<br />
life is normally short; and I was keen for results. The<br />
Committee knew that it had not completely covered the-ground.<br />
It felt, therefILore, that there was need for further study,<br />
and continuing study, of aspects which there had been<br />
insufficient time to consider fully.<br />
2. The university problem is not static but highly dynamic.<br />
Demand is growing much more rapidly Lhan resources. " The<br />
moving finger writes; and having writ, moves on." " The<br />
degree of the required expansion," as the Committee said,<br />
" and the ways in which provision should be made to cater for<br />
this additional need will vary from institution to institution<br />
and from State to State; the problem is far from being a<br />
simple mathematical one and will call for close and continuous<br />
consideration on a national basis."<br />
3. Having regard to modern events, they concluded, as I think<br />
most of us would, that an increasing percentage of students<br />
would be attracted to the pure or applied sciences. They<br />
recognised that, in terms of accommodation, and technical<br />
equipment, science teaching costs more. They saw that the<br />
provision of post-graduate and research facilities is of<br />
particular importance in the scientific field. All of this<br />
argued an urgent need for the existence of some body which<br />
could continuously re-assess the financial needs of the<br />
universities. " These needs," as the Committee said, " cannot<br />
be determined once and for all."<br />
4. There is the problem of university academic salaries, which<br />
the committee found to be " the largest single item of the<br />
universitiest annual current expenditure", and which is not<br />
likely, in a world competing for skill, to remain static.<br />
The Committee therefore thought that periodic consideration<br />
of salaries should be undertaken on a national basis, and by<br />
a permanent Commonwealth Committee.<br />
Murray Committee further thought, and I thiink we would all<br />
most heartily agree, that there is a standing need for coordinating<br />
the w~ ork of the universities so -is t~ o get the best<br />
value from limited resources, not only of money but of trained<br />
manpower. ( That is a horrible economisth expression, "' manpow",<br />
but you know what I mean.) This, they thought, applied with<br />
particular force to specialist branches of unde~ rgraduate<br />
teaching, and to post-graduate and research activities. They<br />
made pointed mention, which it is timely to recall of the<br />
need for consultation on the setting up of new institutions<br />
of university status. There mfay be a temptation to regard<br />
the creation of a new university, for example, primarily in<br />
terms of money and buildings. The provision of' staffs of<br />
high quality is even more difficult, and will be doubly </p>
<p>difficult if we endeavour to spread what we have over too<br />
wide an area. Of course there will be new universities;<br />
notable beginnings are already being made; but great care<br />
will have to be exercised to avoid duulication and waste.<br />
To achieve this, the proposed new body will be of immense<br />
value.<br />
6. The projected committee will need to secure the confidence,<br />
not only of the Commonwealth, but of the States, in the hope<br />
that its advice will be acceptable, and accepted, all round.<br />
It would be a calamity if the States who have done so much<br />
to create and nourish their universities, came to think that<br />
the Commonwealth was invading their proper autonomy in these<br />
matters. My own policy has been to assist, not to invade.<br />
We accepted this compelling reasoning, and therefore<br />
decided to act upon it. WTe rejected the suggested name, the<br />
Australian Universities Grants Committee because we thought it<br />
contained a suggestion of a limited funcLon the recommending<br />
of payments. As every Commonwealth Treasurer has known, no<br />
particular encourage ment in this field is ever needed! We<br />
therefore adopted the name " Australian Universities Commission",<br />
and set it up under the Act of that name, passed this year.<br />
It may be helpful if I remind you of the main provisions<br />
of what will, I hope, turn out to be one of the landmarks in the<br />
educational history of Australia,<br />
The Commission has a full-time Chairman, that notable<br />
scientist, Sir Leslie Martin, formerly of the University of<br />
Melbourne, and is authorised to have 2, 3 or 4 part-time members,<br />
We have in fact appointed four:-Professor Bayliss) Professor<br />
of Chemistry in the University of Western Australia; Professor<br />
Trendall of the Australian National University and Emeritus<br />
Professor of Classics at Sydney; Mr. K. A. Wilis, Managing<br />
Director of G. R. Wills Adelaide, and Chairmand of the Finance<br />
Committee of the University of Adelaide; and Dr. Vernon, the<br />
General Manager of the Colonial Sugar Refining Co. This,<br />
as you will agree, is a highly qualified and most powerful<br />
commnittee which should inspire confidence in all quarters.<br />
The statutory functions of the Committee are:<br />
to furnish information and advice to the Minister ( at<br />
present myself) " on matters in connexion with the grant<br />
by the Commonwealth of financial assistance to<br />
universities established by the Commonwealth and of<br />
financial assistance to the States in relation to<br />
Universities";<br />
to perform its functions with a view to promoting the<br />
balanced development of universities so that their<br />
resources can be used to the greatest possible advantage<br />
of Australia;<br />
to consult with universities and with the States upon<br />
the matters on which it is empowered to furnish<br />
information and advice;<br />
to recommend the conditions upon which financial assistance<br />
should be granted.<br />
I might , with advantage, add a little gloss, since words<br />
like " balanced development" are not necessarily self-explanatory:<br />
Ci The Commission will be expected to see the universities'<br />
picture as a whole; to make its overall financial<br />
recommendations not so as to satisfy everybody's demands<br />
everywhere, but so as to arrive at figures which have a<br />
sinsible relation to government budgets and, in </p>
<p>particular, to government revenues, which the taxpayers<br />
provide. We cannot do or have everything at once ( in<br />
spite of some not unpopular misconceptions to the contrary)<br />
nor can we have all that we need quite so quickly as we<br />
would like.<br />
( ii) " Balanced development" does not mean that any established<br />
University, old or new, should be prevented indefinitely<br />
or for very long from establishing those usual faculties<br />
and disciplines which are the main function of a University,<br />
The teaching of history in Perth does not duplicate the<br />
teaching of history in Sydney. The teaching of biology<br />
in Melbourne does not duplicate the teaching of biology<br />
in Adelaide. If a university is to be true to its name,<br />
there are certain things it must teach, and certain studies<br />
which it must pursue,<br />
But there are highly specialised studies of a more<br />
uncommon kind which may need to be pursued in one place in which<br />
our limited resources may need to be concentrated, For example,<br />
oriental studies, including oriental languages, which we have<br />
sadly neglected, and for which we have so few qualified instructors,<br />
cannot or so it seems to me, be sensibly pursued in, or in<br />
connexion with, more than one University or centre or perhaps two.<br />
In all these considerations, let us always remember that<br />
the greatest shortage in Australia is of trained and disciplined<br />
minds; we cannot afford to waste the efforts of any one of them,<br />
I have high hopes of the Commission, Perhaps my greatest<br />
reason is this: The more the advice of the Commission comes to be<br />
regarded by both Parliament and people as careful, sensible and<br />
authoritative, the less will the advance of University education<br />
and of the universities themselves depend upon the enthusiasm and<br />
encouragement of some Minister or Ministers who is or are<br />
University-minded. The Universities will becomeby common<br />
acceptance, a great and recognised instrument of national<br />
progress and of rising standards of mental, spiritual and material.<br />
living. I have spoken with some pride about the increasing<br />
provision made by governments for universLties, This is, I<br />
suppose, largely inevitable since if we are to train the many<br />
thousands of graduates whom the community needsI the fees of<br />
perhaps most of them will need to be met from other than family<br />
resources, as will the cost of buildings, equipment and staff.<br />
But at the same time, I would think it a misfortune if<br />
universities in Australia came to be too heavily or even completely<br />
dependent upon the goodwill and money of governments,, True, in<br />
Australia, there are relatively few great individual fortunes,<br />
It is, as I have pointed out, only recently that the controllers of<br />
great businesses have looked to the universities for recruits and<br />
have, therefore, found themselves deeply interested in the<br />
success of those universities, There have, of course, been some<br />
splendid benefactions to universities, but I would take leave to<br />
doubt whether of all the thousands who graduate each year, more<br />
than a few regard themselves as having any debt to their<br />
university which they might hope thereafter to reccgnise or repay<br />
in some degree. The Americans have, I think, set a great example in this<br />
respect. In that country, universities have been on a great<br />
scale beneficiaries of those who have passed through their doors<br />
and have become financially successful, with a pride in building<br />
up the university from which they graduated. </p>
<p>There are, after all, obvious disabilities which attach<br />
to an over-dependence of universities on governments. It may not,<br />
in our time, be possible to avoid this over-dependence; but at<br />
least we can become aware of the dangers and seek to avoid them.<br />
The greatest danger is, of course, that he who pays the piper will<br />
always be permitted to call the tune. We politicians are, in<br />
spite of rumours to the contrary, human beings, and we are<br />
perhaps not averse from obtaining or exercising power. There<br />
will, therefore, always be a considerable temptation for<br />
politicians, who by their votes provide the universities with<br />
funds, to seek to dictate or influence lines of study and<br />
occasionally to concern themselves unnecessarily with staff<br />
appointments. This kind of thing can, unless it it sturdily<br />
resisted, lead to a lowering of standards and a debasing of the<br />
academic currency. It is, I fear7 a fact that Members of<br />
Parliament are themselves in receipt of more advocacy to reduce<br />
expert qualifications than to raise them. If the advocacy comes<br />
from a sufficient number of constituents, there will be a<br />
temptation to yield to it, There is always somebody to be found<br />
to complain by correspondence or in the press that examinations<br />
are too difficult or that they ought to be abolished. Such<br />
anguished complaints are usually based upon the fact that " Little<br />
Willie" has been ploughed in an examination in spite of what his<br />
parents know him to be an extremely clever boy. Yet the truth<br />
is that if we are to hold our place and make it a better place in<br />
a growing and complex competitive world, the greatest ching is to<br />
have rising standards of expert qualification,,<br />
We can always get increased numbers by lowering the tests.<br />
We will never get increased quality, which is the thing we need,<br />
without raising them.<br />
From time to time there emerges what I believe is called a<br />
" modern" approach to the process of education. This approach is<br />
based upon a somewhat pedantic interpretation of the word<br />
" education". It concentrates upon the " leading out" of the<br />
individual. It emphasises individual self-expression. It dislikes<br />
the idea of discipline, One hears it said that the child must be<br />
given the opportunity of following his own bent. This, I venture<br />
to say, is a soft and escapist approach to education. It is,<br />
oddly enough, never applied to athletes' We have not yet unduly<br />
suffered from it in Australia, and I hope we won'to The fallacy<br />
of such ideas is that they ignore the basic truth that before any<br />
student can just " follow his own bent" he must have achieved by<br />
concentrated work certain fundamentals, It is clear that his mind<br />
must have acquired a degree of self-discipline before it can<br />
venture freely into fresh fields of its own choosing, He may find<br />
the study of mathematics a terrible drudgery. His parents may say<br />
" how will this wretched algebra help my son to earn a living?".<br />
But if the son's bent of mind is towards the sciences, he will slur<br />
his mathematics at his peril.<br />
It is the modern fashion to despise and reject Latin,<br />
which is for most of us difficult, as being both dead and<br />
irrelevant, but the neglect of the foundations of our wonderful<br />
language is already bearing its fruit in slovenly speech and<br />
writing, It is an odd thing that in a community in which we are<br />
all given to self-expression, the niceties and precision of speech<br />
have come to be somewhat disregarded, The avereae boys' school<br />
appears to be completely indifferent as to how boys speak; so<br />
that they may go through the school curriculum with satisfaction<br />
but at the same time speak a species of obscure vernacular which<br />
appears to take some pride in illiteracy and to regard good speech<br />
as " sissy". A great number of girls' schools seem to me to do<br />
much better than this, Yet good plain clear speech is of<br />
increasing importance in the world.<br />
Sir John Monash was, by commuon consent, a very great<br />
soldier. He was a notable engineer. His success in both of these<br />
fields was largely attributable to the superb clarity of his mind.<br />
He was a magnificent and persuasive speaker, one of the best<br />
advocates I ever heard. </p>
<p>Sir Brudenell White, his outstanding staff officer, was,<br />
I think, the most lucid and graceful of after-dinner speakers.<br />
Sir Thomas Blamey, blunt man of" action as he was in many<br />
respects, had a complete command of pointed and persuasive speech.<br />
I am no scientist, but the greatest scientists I have met<br />
have been men thoroughly educated in the use of their owfn<br />
language and with a rare capacity for exposition.<br />
You may say to me " What has all this to do with a<br />
university?" Well, it has a great deal to do with it. The whole<br />
point I am making is, if I may put it in this way, that at our<br />
peril we should not attempt to divorce the study of the physical<br />
sciences from the study of the humanities. We should not aim at<br />
the production of the narrow specialist, since his narrowness will<br />
put deadly limits to his social usefulness. We should, in all our<br />
seats of learning, endeavour to provide courses of instruction and<br />
facilities for daily contact which will brighten -the minds of both<br />
the scientists and the humanists, making each of them want to know<br />
something of the other man's work, and producing for all of them a<br />
broad education which will not impair the acquisition of the highest<br />
technical skill, but will actually improve that skill by giving<br />
its owner a deeper perception and a clearer understanding of its<br />
use and of its consequences,<br />
To stun up, centnries ago, students at the few universities<br />
were, so to speak, withdrawn from the world, walking and talking<br />
in the groves of Academe, furnishing their minds.<br />
They were not particularly concerned about whether their<br />
studies qualified them for the earning of a living, except,<br />
perhaps, in the Church. They pursued humane letters. Sciencelin<br />
the modern sense, was largely unknown,~ Greek and Latin,<br />
philosophy, history, were the chief materials of scholarship. The<br />
universities were not professional schools; they aimed at the<br />
general training of the mind, largely by reading and discussion.<br />
They were ancient and autonomous bodies neither the servants of<br />
government nor, in any real sense, maintained by themp.<br />
Today, the whole scene has changed. The university is<br />
predominantly, but I hope not definitively, a professional school,,<br />
True, research is more and more encouraged, in the great tradition<br />
of true learning. But increasingly, universities are maintained<br />
by governments in the discharge of what is seen to be a social<br />
responsibility. Classical studies have declined until they have<br />
come to be regarded as a minority eccentricity, There is a great<br />
drive for the production of more and more practising scientists,<br />
doctors, lawyers, engineers, and teachers,<br />
There have been other changes.~ Even as recently as in my<br />
own youth, most students were attending their classes by the aid<br />
of hard-won scholarship or ( and in many cases, and) by a real<br />
self-sacrifice on the part of their parents, Today, that has<br />
already changed. We have come to regard a university training,<br />
for those qualified and willing, as a social right. Not only are<br />
fees paid for many thousands every year, but in many cases living<br />
allowances are provided, I remember saying to Sir Keith Murray<br />
that I had great doubts as to whether enough wij--ers of<br />
Commonwealth Scholarships were of genuine scholarship standing.<br />
His reply was " You are looking back to your own time, when<br />
scholarships were scarce and only a student well above the average<br />
could hope to win one. But today most scholarships are government<br />
grants in aid. Without them, far fewer people would be attending<br />
universities." No doubt this great expert was right; there have<br />
been fundamental changes., </p>
<p>9.<br />
But though people of average intelligence and skill are<br />
essential to the world's work ( which is a great comfort to me),<br />
there is still a growing and incessant need for something better.<br />
A great university scientist said to me recently tha,: t while the<br />
average capacity of to-day's students was very good, and probably<br />
better than ever, he doubted whether we were producing enough<br />
" 1peaks". This was, to me, an arresting remark. I know that in<br />
Australia we have a curious passion for " uniformity" whether in<br />
taxes or otherwise but we must realise that this passion can<br />
become destructive. The great forward movements in civilise~ d<br />
history have been commenced or led by uncommon men and women. The<br />
great scientific discoveries have not been the product of routine<br />
minds. The whole process of development and improvement in<br />
Australia will slow down unless we succeed in producing more and<br />
more people of superior talent, training and devotion,<br />
That last word " devotion" needs some emphasis. The purely<br />
monetary test of professional success is now increasingly popular.<br />
" Which profession offers the greatest monetary rewards? That's<br />
the one of me!"<br />
Such an attitude of mind will, of course, never produce a<br />
great doctor or lawyer or scientist. It never has. Take the law,<br />
my first and true love. To one who finds his vocation in the law,<br />
its study and practice have almost infinite satisfaction.<br />
Protracted hours of work become a pleasure. To one who has no<br />
vocation for the law, but has adopted it solely as a means of<br />
living, it must, I imagine, forever remain a thing of dust and<br />
drudgery. I know next door to nothing about science. True, I recall<br />
that the first law of physics is that " action and reaction are<br />
equal and opposite", but this is so true of politics that its<br />
scientific origin has become dulled in my mind. But I do most<br />
clearly understand that the great scientific discoveries have been<br />
made by men of vision with a passion for research; not the<br />
slaves of the clock, but of the elusive truth.<br />
These reflections may help to convey to you my conception<br />
S of the ultimate task of tlie Universitis which is not to be<br />
content to be professional schools though this is bound to be<br />
their primary function but to aim at contributing to the nation,<br />
and to mankind, minds which are at once disciplined and imaginative,<br />
reflective and productive. </p>
