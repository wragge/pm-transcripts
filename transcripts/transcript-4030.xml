PRIME MINISTER'S INTERVIEW WITH MR YOSHINO OF THE<br />
NIHON-KEIZAI NEWSPAPER, 19 JANUARY 1976<br />
QUESTION: I would like to know, according to your last statement recently,<br />
the relationship between Japan and Australia is facing difficulties<br />
and so Japan from now on has to perhaps cut back imports of<br />
sugar, and iron ore and coking coal while Australia already<br />
is limiting the imports from Japan. What is your . attitude<br />
towards this and what kind of effort do you think is necessary<br />
to resunii this good relationship with trust?<br />
? RIME MINISTER: The statement issued was one that was basically designed<br />
to emphasise the importance of relationships between Japan<br />
and Australia. The whole thrust of the statement was announcing<br />
the Deputy Prime Minister's visit to Japan and was meant to<br />
achieve a recognition of this and to emphasise this. It will<br />
certainly be the purpose of my Government to work for close,<br />
harmonious and profitable relationships between Japan and Australia.<br />
The statement did recognise that because of the world recession,<br />
because of other difficulties, there had been a fall off in trade<br />
in some commodities, in some areas Japan was buying less than us,<br />
and in one or two other areas there were restrictions about<br />
which Japan had expressed concern to us. I have got confidence<br />
that these d ifficulties will be overcome and they should not be<br />
allowed to take a preeminent position in the minds of either<br />
Japan or Australia concerning the relationship between the<br />
two countries. I would certainly hope that they are transitional,<br />
that they are passing difficulties and that tL. he growth of trade<br />
between Japan and Australia will continue in future years. We<br />
will certainly be working towards that end. We know the importance<br />
-to Japan of Australia being a reliable supplier of raw rnater-a2. s<br />
and we recognise countries such as Australia with significant<br />
and large natural resources have an obligation to be a reliable<br />
and secure supplier to countries such as Japan. It's my hope<br />
that what difficulties might have developed over the last two<br />
or three years can in part at least be overcome when the<br />
Deputy Prime Minister is in Japan in a week or two.<br />
alUESTION: About the NARA Treaty which the previous Government had been<br />
trying to negotiate. What is your attitude, what is your Government's<br />
attitude towards the NARA Treaty? </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: It would be our objective to secure completion of the<br />
Treaty as soon as we reasonably can. ' There were some matters<br />
still in negotiation between Japan and Australia in relation<br />
to it. I've already given instructions that ought to enable<br />
Australia to define her attitudes in relation to these<br />
remaining issues, as soon as practicable. That would be my<br />
objective and my Government's objective to secure a completion<br />
of * the Treaty, as soon . as we reasonably can.<br />
QUESTION: Now can we go to the international organisations by producing<br />
countries and also for instance OECD and also international<br />
bauxite association. What is your Government's policy<br />
towards these?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well I think the previous Government joined three of<br />
these producing organisations and this is a matter<br />
which my Government has not yet examined in detail. But I can<br />
give an assurance that we would not want those producing<br />
countries and organisations to operate in a way which caused<br />
acute difficulties to Japan and many other countries in the<br />
manner which camne about as a result of rises in the price of oil.<br />
In other words, I'm saying producing countries, raw material<br />
rich countries do have international obligations. Australia<br />
recognises that, and as a member of those producing organisations<br />
would voice that view. I would also like to say that, on another<br />
point, that while we recognise obligations to be regular, reliable<br />
and secure suppliers of materials we would hope that-it would<br />
be possible to achieve more regular markets for some of our<br />
commodities where our producers are now in grave difficulty.<br />
Let me only take one as an examnple. qe were exporting very<br />
significant quantities of beef to Japan. Because of a conjunction<br />
of events, markets in America, Japan and Europe all diminished<br />
at the same time. I believe it would be appropriate f or us<br />
to examine ways and means to try to secure regular and<br />
reliable markets for our products of this kind and that this is<br />
a significant part of the trading relationship between Japan and<br />
Australia which can help to build long-term security and long-term<br />
confidence between both our countries. ./ 3 </p>
<p>) UESTION': Have you got any practical ideas to secure these long-term<br />
supplies from your side?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:. is that question related to beef or to iron ore?<br />
QUESTION: Related to the beef,~ mineral resources and primary products<br />
generally speaking. So it includes beef, sugar and ~ minerals<br />
as well.<br />
' RIME MINISTER: Well there are long-term contracts for minerals and the<br />
contracts for sugar have I think been spread over a longer term<br />
perhaps than the one for beef. It would be a matter for<br />
discussion and negotiation between Japan and Australia how to<br />
achieve long-term stability. The commodities are there.<br />
They are available for export and I think it's a question of<br />
Japan and Australia discussing together how best we can achieve<br />
stability in arrangements for these particular products, and in<br />
particular for the primary products. Mineral exports tend<br />
to be covered by long-term contracts and that gives a reasonable<br />
degree of security and that can be improved, the security of<br />
trade can be improved. I would again favour that. In primary<br />
products, in beef in particular, we have the situation in which<br />
very significant quantities were purchased for quite a few years<br />
and then virtually nothing. That coming on top of falls in<br />
markets in America and Europe means. that our beef producers are<br />
in very great difficulty. The security of access to Japanese<br />
markets and commodities is something that -is ' important and something<br />
that will help greatly in the overall good relationship and<br />
understanding between the Japanese and Australian people.<br />
How precisely this is to be achieved is a matter for negotiations<br />
and discussion. on the other side, Australia's imzports from Japan,<br />
I recognise Japan's need also for regular and reliable access<br />
to our markets for their manufactured products. We have difficulty<br />
in the motor car industry because of revaluation by Australia<br />
and because of inflation in Australia. A steady market here for<br />
Japanese cars suddenly became a very large market for Japanese<br />
cars with the consequent embarrassment and lack of employment Which<br />
threatened Australia's motor manufacturers. As a result<br />
the previous GQvernment introduced import quotas.. Again the<br />
relationship is enhanced if the access can, be reasonable., reliable </p>
<p>and secure. Instead of escalating greatly one year and<br />
being cut*. of f the next trade should be long-term,' secur~ e<br />
and regular. We don't want sudden changes in demand because<br />
it's upsetting for your industries and it's upsetting for our<br />
industries.<br />
QUESTION: About uranium. For instance will you ban export to Japan<br />
unless they ratify the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. Do<br />
you think this way? Do you want to make sure that the countries<br />
you are exporting to, that they ratify this treaty?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: This is a matter that has not yet been examined closely<br />
by the Government and it will be coming up for consideration<br />
very shortly. But we ourselves are bound by that treaty.<br />
Australia is bound by that treaty, and I think there is an<br />
obligation to make sure that we all do what we can to prevent<br />
nuclear proliferation. Now having said that we recognise<br />
that there are many countries that are short of energy sources<br />
and uranium is a prime energy source. Therefore, as a member<br />
of the international community I think we have an obligation<br />
on ourselves, or to ourselves and to other countries to make sure<br />
that any export of uranium is going to go for peaceful<br />
purposes only. The kind of safeguards that need spelling out and<br />
defining in relation to this would be matters for consideration<br />
by the Government.<br />
QUESTION: What is the basic policy towards the provision and the role of<br />
Australia in the Asian/ Pacific region. For instance, the policy<br />
towards the neutralisation of Asian countries, or the zone of<br />
peace of the Indian Ocean or regional cooperation?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Let's take these one by onle. I've said over tI.-he last two<br />
or three days in Malaysia and Singapore that I wanted Australia's<br />
diplomatic efforts to be concentrated more on our own region<br />
and this is the countries to the north, China, Japan, South-East<br />
Asia, that our diplomatic efforts over recent times had been<br />
scattered too far around the world. We live in one part of it<br />
and we ought to give more attention to it. We would want to<br />
cooperate greatly in diplomacy, in relation to the developing<br />
countries, concerning aid matters with the countries of the </p>
<p>region. I believe as I said in Singapore that there's<br />
scope for greater consultation and cooperation between Australia<br />
and South-East Asian countries, both bi-laterally and through<br />
ASEAN. I will also see a role for furthering what I believe<br />
are the close relationships between Japan and Australia, and that<br />
continuing discussions at official, Ministeral level, certainly<br />
are going to be of mutual benefit to us. ' The objective<br />
of neutral zones I can understand. We would support no great<br />
power having any dominating influence of the ASEAN region because<br />
that's only likely to lead to other great powers trying to<br />
counter that dominating influence and I believe that's an<br />
approach that the ASEAN members themselves have close to their,<br />
hearts. The objective of a neutral zone in the Indian Ocean<br />
is an ideal which I think has little chance of success. There's<br />
often a great deal of criticism in the United States over Diego<br />
Garcia and of American ships in the Indian Ocean. However<br />
the. sailing time of Russian ships is ' three days for every sailing<br />
time of an American ship. In other words Russian activity in the<br />
Indian Ocean is three times that of the United States. Their<br />
facilities around the Indian Ocean are greater and those who<br />
direct their criticism at the United States often do not direct<br />
their criticism at Russia. We don't want to see escalating great<br />
power rivalry in the Indian Ocean,. but at the same time we don't<br />
want to see it as an area being dominated by one great power.<br />
Over the recent business in Angola, who can doubt that the reports<br />
of two significant Soviet ships approaching Angola at a critical<br />
point didn't have an effect on one of the sides in that particular<br />
conflict. The use of sea power as a weapon in diplomacy has<br />
often been practiced. While the objective of a neutral zone is<br />
an admirable one which I can understand, I think the reality<br />
of achieving it, given the attitudes of the Soviet Union, is<br />
unlikely. That being so, there needs to be a balance and -the<br />
only power that can provide that balance really is the United<br />
States. Australia certainly hasn't the capacity to achieve that<br />
balance although we need to make our own contribution. I think<br />
that broadly covers that question.<br />
QUESTION: Australia and Japan, these two countries, as two advanced countries<br />
in Asia, what sort of initiative do you think they should take? -M </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: Well that. again is a very wide question. I believe we<br />
ought to work as closely together as possible. And we ought to<br />
work as closely as we can with the developing countries in the<br />
region. We both have a capacity to provide aid. I think<br />
that that ought to be done in a way that enhances the developing<br />
prospects of other countries. I've for a long time believed<br />
that countries of the Pacific region could do more to cooperate<br />
together in trade matters. If the European Economic Community<br />
maintains some of its restrictive attitudes, cooperation between<br />
us might do something to widen the areas of trade. The<br />
ASE. AN countries for example, cooperate together in putting<br />
common points of view to the European Economic Community<br />
, over their trading problems. I believe it's a good idea for<br />
Japan and Auastralia to identify areas in which they've got a<br />
common interest. And if necessary in international forums<br />
to argue those interests together. We both have a very significant<br />
interest in the Western Pacific and in peace and stability in the<br />
Western Pacific. Close relations between us are I think of quite<br />
an importance for the security of the region. Getting back<br />
to the points on which we were starting. We're a country<br />
with resources: the main resource of Japan is the energy and<br />
initiative and skill of her people. We recognise Japan's need<br />
to be able to import to fabricate and sell-to the markets of the<br />
world. That'is the way that the standard of life of the people of<br />
Japan develops and is improved. I think through consultation many<br />
areas of cooperation between us will unfold and develop and I<br />
hope that successfully concluding the Treaty between us will help<br />
to-provide a general umbrella under which this can take place.<br />
Q2UESTION: After Mr Anthony's visit to Japan you have a plan to visit also<br />
Japan and China in the near future.*<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No date has been set on it because there are many things that<br />
we must ebo here and obviously it would be necessary to have a date<br />
that would be acceptable in Japan, but I've never visited Japan,<br />
except overnight really, and I would like to visit Japan and hope<br />
that the visit would be acceptable when I have time to go overseas.<br />
But there are many domestic problems which I have to give<br />
Priority to in relation to the economy. </p>
<p>7.<br />
QUESTION: What is you main aim in visiting Japan?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: To establish personal relationships to enhance relationships<br />
between Australia and Japan.<br />
