    <content><![CDATA[<p>Today Annette Ellis, the dedicated and hard working Member for Canberra, has announced her decision not to contest the next federal election.</p>
<p>During almost 15 years of representing the people of southern Canberra, and almost 30 working with the Labor Party, Annette has been a tireless and passionate advocate for her community.</p>
<p>Annette has always taken very seriously her responsibilities to the people of Canberra, and has quietly and deliberately worked to deliver real outcomes on the ground.</p>
<p>The respect she has earned in her own community is reflected in her election to the Federal Parliament on five occasions.</p>
<p>Annette has been a passionate contributor to the Committee process throughout her time as a Member of the House of Representatives, including currently as the Chair of the Standing Committee on Family, Community, Housing and Youth, a member of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade and a member of the National Capital and External Territories Joint Standing Committee of the Federal Parliament.</p>
<p>Annette has expressed often to me her belief in the opportunities provided through the Committee process for learning, consideration and deliberation of the real policy challenges facing our national parliament.</p>
<p>Her work for her community and in the House of Representatives demonstrates this quiet, thoughtful and profoundly effective belief in the importance of good and considered government.</p>
<p>Annette has also been a strong campaigner on improved disability and aged care services throughout her time in Parliament, including as the Shadow Minister for Disabilities and Shadow Minister for Ageing and Seniors from 2001-2004.</p>
<p>An active, committed local member, it is with regret that I received the news of her decision to retire at the next election.</p>
<p>I would like to thank Annette for her invaluable service to the people of Canberra, and to the Australian Labor Party.</p>
<p>Ms Ellis will continue to serve the people of Canberra until the next Federal election.</p>
<p>I wish Annette all the very best for the future. </p>
