    <content><![CDATA[<p>Morayfield will soon have 1,300 new homes, years sooner, thanks to a $10.5 million investment from the Rudd Government's Housing Affordability Fund.</p>
<p>The $10.5 million will be used by the Moreton Bay Regional Council to:</p>
<p>     * Construct critical infrastructure in the form of a vehicle, bicycle and pedestrian bridge; and</p>
<p>     * Implement the RiskSMART planning reform tool - to speed up developments assessments, reducing the costs to builders on holding land that are usually passed on to homebuyers.</p>
<p>The investment will save a hundred home buyers $15,000 on the purchase of a new home, 50 of which will be reserved for workers such as police, nurses and teachers.</p>
<p>Hundreds more families will benefit from the increase in available houses.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister and the Member for Longman Jon Sullivan made the announcement during a visit to Riverbank Estate with Moreton Bay Mayor Allan Sutherland and project developer PEET Caboolture Syndicate.</p>
<p>Mr Sullivan said Riverbank Estate is close to services, commercial and community facilities.</p>
<p>"I'm delighted our Government is providing funding for this project through the Housing Affordability Fund. It targets the two of the greatest needs in our local area - housing and employment.</p>
<p>"I am looking forward to work getting started early. The preliminary bridge work and subsequent housing construction will provide much needed employment for local workers."</p>
<p>The Housing Affordability Fund is reducing the costs of planning delays and infrastructure costs, such as water, sewerage and transport.</p>
<p>It is also increasing the number of new homes on the market in rapidly growing areas like Moreton Bay.</p>
<p>Moreton Bay Regional Council area is the third largest municipality in Australia with population growth occurring at double the national average.</p>
<p>In total the Rudd Government is investing $512 million in the Housing Affordability Fund to reduce planning and infrastructure costs in new housing developments.</p>
