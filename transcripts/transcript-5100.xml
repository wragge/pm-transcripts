PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA MONDAY 9 JULY 1979'<br />
ADDRESS TO LIVESTOCK AND GRAIN PRODUCERS ASSOCIATION<br />
Let me say at the outset that the Commonwealth is not in the<br />
* business and my Government is not in the business of ending<br />
death duties merely to replace it with a capital gains tax.<br />
We have made that plain on many many occasions. Other political<br />
parties have the introduction of a capital gains tax on their<br />
agenda and high on their list of priorities. It is not on ours.<br />
We will not contemplate such a tax. We believe that getting<br />
rid of probate for farms, pastoralists, and for small businesses<br />
generally, and . to a very wide section of the Australian<br />
community was something which was long overdue<br />
and essential for the continued successful and viable<br />
operation of small businesses, whether they be farming operations<br />
or manufacturing businesses or trading businesses of other kinds.<br />
We are not going to diminish the effect of those policies.<br />
I am very happy to be here at this Second Annual Conference.<br />
It builds on the success of last year. With a large number of<br />
delegates from something approaching 100 branches, I believe it<br />
shows the vitality of the organisation. Amalgamation of farming<br />
organisations in recent years has, I believe, been good for<br />
rural industries because it enables rural industries to speak<br />
with greater vigor, with greater unity. I think that is very<br />
necessary indeed.<br />
There are some things, if I am advised rightly, about your<br />
organisation which I envy very greatly. The rules for debate,<br />
the mover I am told has three minutes. Two subsequent speakers<br />
have two minutes. A reply of two minutes. If we could only have<br />
that we could get through the business of Parliament much easier<br />
with less noise and thunder and I hope with a little more accuracy.<br />
I would like to say something about the position of rural<br />
industries as I see it, about the nature of Government policies<br />
and then about the broader implications of Australia's role and<br />
the kind of world that Australia has to live and trade in, and<br />
the direction of Government policies in relation to that.<br />
Quite plainly prices for rural products are better than they<br />
have been. I am not going to say that farmers have never had<br />
it so good, because I know quite well that the betterprices that<br />
have been coupled with a better season, had been desperately<br />
necessary for many producers. Many were facing bankruptcy and<br />
having to leave their properties. Farmers sons were wondering<br />
whether there was any future on the land. It was a grim position<br />
indeed. So the better prices that are now present are needed to<br />
repair the damage of previous years and to enable producers to<br />
./ 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
build up their financial reserves once again. As we know,<br />
in the beef industry what happened in 1974 when we lost all<br />
our access to Japan in the very year we were shut out of<br />
Europe. Again, there were restraints in the United States<br />
at that time.<br />
Is there any wonder that prices fell catastrophically and that<br />
large parts of rural Australia were grieviously damaged as<br />
a result. Average prices now may be two and half to three times<br />
the price of a year ago. I think that with the reduction of numbers<br />
in the United States and with the reduction in numbers in<br />
Australia, which may not yet have bottomed-out, that we ought to<br />
be able to look forward to a continuation of reasonable returns<br />
for some time. We can't guarantee what the weather will do, but<br />
apart from that, I believe that with the trade negotiations we<br />
have undertaken, we have done more to secure export markets for<br />
that industry and to secure its future than at any other time.<br />
The wheat harvest was an excellent one with a gross value of<br />
over $ 2 billion, more than double last year's. Again, the new<br />
stabilisation agreement that has just been negotiated<br />
will enable the industry to build on its past achievements.<br />
The wool industry is much stronger and in a much healthier positionas<br />
is the sheep industry generally-than for a number of years.<br />
You will know that we have been able to lift the floor price to<br />
318 cents per kilogram for the wholeper clean kilo clip average against<br />
the actual average of about 360 or 361 cents at the present time.<br />
I think that is quite a large margin between the average and the<br />
floor. But at the same time, the floor has been increased. The<br />
general level of wool reserves is about 350,000 or 360,000 bales,<br />
less than half of a year ago. All in all the industry is in<br />
a very strong position. Again, I can see no real reason<br />
why that should not continue. I think a verydifferent position from the<br />
one whichi led a thousand or so woolgrowers to parade outside<br />
Parliament House one morning four or five years ago, when at<br />
the very time you needed stability in wool marketing, confidence<br />
in the price of wool, confidence in the Wool Corporation, the then<br />
Government reduced the reserve price by 50 cents. It didn't last.<br />
It didn't survive against the uproar that came from Australia<br />
and overseas. But that particular action showed something of the<br />
mind of our predecessors.<br />
A number of other rural industries are also doing better. The<br />
gross value of agriculture output in this year is over 40 percent<br />
up on the year before. That is the biggest increase for many<br />
years. Admittedly, in some industries, from a pretty low base.<br />
It has been an increase that has been desperately needed in most<br />
parts of rural Australia. It has occurred and therefore it is<br />
necessary to do what we can to consolidate the gains and make<br />
sure that they are not lost.<br />
I know you have expressed concerned about the levies in relation<br />
to meat for the meat export trade. The restrictive trade<br />
practices organisation, I think is considering taking out<br />
action. I think it might already have done so in relation<br />
to ( inaudible). . The Minister is also drafting conditions which<br />
would be attached to export licenses to make sure that the levies<br />
are paid to the extent that they are into the terms and conditions / 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
of the legislation, and that they are not passed back to<br />
producers as the exporters had sought to achieve over recent<br />
times. I can well understand the annoyance of producers at<br />
the actions of exporters. I think that the 45D action and<br />
the action that the Minister has taken with conditions attaching<br />
to export licenses, will achieve a continuation of the previous<br />
means ( inaudible) of those levies. I think a resolution<br />
also goes to the substance of the levies themselves. I would believe<br />
against the present incomes of primary producers, of the meat<br />
industry in particular, and I can speak in this instance as a<br />
beef producer--I think that those levies are not unjustified.<br />
We all know that there has been a continuous demand on the<br />
Government to reduce expenditure. We also all know here, that<br />
primary producers and exporters have more to gain by the containment<br />
of inflation and more to lose by the loss of the battle against<br />
inflation than almost any other section of the Australian community.<br />
Because, above all, what you sell, what we sell, is dependent<br />
upon prices that we can get overseas. To the extent that we<br />
can keep our inflation below that of many other countries, then<br />
our exporters are advantaged. If our inflation gets ahead of<br />
that than many other countries, then we are in a much worse position.<br />
Therefore, against that general background and against the<br />
background of current prices in the meat industry, the Government<br />
felt that it was not unreasonable for producers to pay a larger<br />
share, or the industry to pay a larger share, of the cost of<br />
the various processes in meat inspection.<br />
I know it is not liked, but at the same time I indicated that<br />
if industry gets into difficult times then the Government will<br />
pick up the bills as indeed we have in the past. We can do that<br />
again. But against the totality of expenditure restraint, the<br />
tiries we had in getting to an overall budget position that will<br />
be responsible when that comes out in August--the action that<br />
we took I believe was necessary. I also believe against the<br />
background of current incomes, that it was justified.<br />
I would like to suggest that the recovery in the rural sector<br />
is certainly not an accident. It has come about as a deliberate<br />
application of Government policies over three and a half years.<br />
I think we can all recall in 1974 when farm costs rose by 30 percent<br />
in one year. Again, as deliberate application of a number of<br />
policies and as a result of Government policies which allowed<br />
inflation to run rampant in Australia. It has been necessary<br />
to control expenditure. It has been necessary to exercise the<br />
most rigorous restraint in what the Government itself does; how<br />
we spend tax dollars. It has also been necessary to reduce<br />
taxation-and we have, very substantially.<br />
This year is the first for over a decade, and maybe much longer<br />
than that, in which actual income collected from income-tax<br />
payers will be less in real terms than it was the year before.<br />
That, I think, is a substantial achievement in terms of tax cuts.<br />
As against earlier tax scales, the total collections are $ 3,000 millio:<br />
less than they would have been if the 1975/ 76 scales remained<br />
in force. / 4 </p>
<p>-4<br />
We have indicated very plainly that we are prepared, and will,<br />
-help industries when it gets very difficult. There are<br />
special programmes, especially for the beef industry. But more<br />
than that, we have introduced long-term programmes which-are<br />
designed to help producers re-build their assets, re-build their<br />
reserves. Income equalisation deposits maybe won't be much use for<br />
producers who wouldn't have had an income to invest, but under<br />
current circumstances, I hope they will be more freely used.<br />
The revised system of tax averaging is of greater benefit to<br />
primary producers than ever before. The Primary Industry<br />
Bank has re-financed loans up to more than $ 100 million. We have<br />
already made decisions to supplement the funds of the Bank, but<br />
that will be announced in a little while. There are still some<br />
negotiations in relation to it. The new Wheat Stabilisation<br />
Scheme has been approved. But above all, we have done much<br />
I believe to secure the position of Australia's primary producing<br />
exporters through trade negotiations with Europe, with Japan,<br />
and with the United States. This has been a deliberate campaign<br />
by the Government over the last two to three years.<br />
So far as Europe is concerned, there are many who have said<br />
" why do you bother. They have shut the door against us and they<br />
are not going to allow that door to be opened". We believe that<br />
the justice and the merit of the Australian case will enable<br />
us to make some advance. We never expected a major advance, but<br />
we did expect to be able to get that door open, and we have got<br />
that door open. We have done that against the background of a<br />
very difficult negotiation over more than two years. We will be<br />
establishing means and mechanisms of a continuing negotiation<br />
with the European Community to build on what has in fact been<br />
achieved. I can well remember the first time I visited Brussels<br />
and had some discussions with the Commission. It took the<br />
best part of a day of long argument to get them to agree even to<br />
negotiate with Australia. Even to admit that there was a case.<br />
In the end they did. But much has been achieved since then.<br />
Indeed, I think we have achieved a different attitude to the debate<br />
in the European Community itself, about the Common Agricultural<br />
Policy. Because now from Britain, from Dr. Gundelach,, and from<br />
many within the Community, there is opposition to the very high<br />
cost of their agricultural policy. At the same time, there is<br />
a very real recognition that a country such as Australia or<br />
New Zealand has a very real case indeed. That is a significant<br />
turn-around.<br />
The Multilateral Trade Negotiations with the United States and<br />
Japan will have again done much to reassure and guarantee markets<br />
for our major exports; f or meat and for wool. In Japan we are<br />
already up to about 115,000 tonnes and the agreed amount, under<br />
the trade agreement, will be significantly above that,~<br />
The United States' position has also secured. -I think it is<br />
worth noting that while many other Governments over about 30 years<br />
had spoken of getting the United States' wool tariff reduced,<br />
it is my Government that in fact has got it reduced. Others have<br />
spoken about doing it, but had never been able to achieve it.<br />
That wool tariff will be reduced by-60 percent as we know. </p>
<p>In these areas, then I believe, we have done much to secure<br />
the future of Australia's major export industries in a way that<br />
has not been done before. I think we should look forward to<br />
more secure prices and more secure trading positions, with the<br />
one provision that the countries with whom we have undertaken<br />
agreements stick to those agreements. I have not reason to<br />
think that they won't.<br />
I would like to say something about the general position<br />
Australia finds herself in as a result of continuing high<br />
inflation around the world.<br />
Since the years of high inflation in 1973, world trade has<br />
grown by three or four percent a year. While it continues to<br />
grow by as little as that, unemployment around the world<br />
will certainly stay high. In the 20 years before 1973, world<br />
trade grew by about 8 percent. In those figures, 8 percent<br />
falling to 3 or 4 percent, we see much of the difficulties of<br />
the western economic countries, much of the difficulties of<br />
the western system of trade and payments.<br />
Unfortunately in many countries, inflation has not been<br />
adequately dealt with. There are pressures around the world and<br />
in Australia which at the moment tend to move inflation in<br />
other directions. But in the United States it is approaching<br />
11 percent and rising on the last six-monthly figures. In<br />
Britain 13 percent and on the admidssion in their own budget,<br />
going to 16 or 17 percent. In Germany, where it had been<br />
well-controlled, it has risen to 7.3 percent. That is a two<br />
or three-fold increase over the last six to seven months.<br />
The total picture of Europe, the OECD countries, is over 10 percent.<br />
Australia is running around 8 percent, but again with pressures<br />
to increase inflation, but I believe not by as much as in other<br />
countries. Those pressures have come significantly from<br />
increases in meat prices, which was good news for meat producers<br />
and very necessary for meat producers. But it is bad news for<br />
inflation. There have been other pressures also. The size of<br />
the wheat crop. That didn't help with the money supply, but<br />
arrangements have been made about that. Better metals prices<br />
have also added to the money supply. There are inflationary<br />
pressures from that course, as there are also from wage increases<br />
of course, and from oil prices.<br />
I think others will be affected much worse than Australia in<br />
relation to oil supplies. I announced a major policy on energy<br />
a few days ago. The purpose of that was of course to make<br />
quite sure that essential producers, when it is necessary,<br />
will be able to get the supplies that they need. We have had<br />
people overseas examining whether or not there should be<br />
Government-to-Government purchases. That that would secure the<br />
supplies of Australian fuel. We believe that additioihal supplies<br />
of Avgas have been obtained which help to relieve significantly<br />
the particular shortages and difficulties in Queensland and in<br />
the north of Australia, because those areas were earlier supplied<br />
from Iran. Those supplies are now not so readily available.<br />
Southern Australia is largely supplied from Australian refineries.<br />
/ 6 </p>
<p>-6<br />
The Government knows quite well, and will make sure that<br />
producers who need fuel at particular times will be able to<br />
get fuel if there are general shortages. Of course the<br />
Kurnell Refinery in which I believe would not<br />
have occurred if the State AWU hadn't been given encouragement<br />
over a long period to break out of the Federal Award, has led<br />
to very particular fuel problems in this State. That just shows,<br />
against the general background of a world shortage, how important<br />
it is to make sure that Australian refineries keep operating.<br />
Because if reserves are run down as a result of a dispute of<br />
that kind, I think it become very difficult to re-build those<br />
reserves.<br />
Industrial relations is a matter of concern and it is of<br />
concern to the Government. One of the problems in the Telecom<br />
dispute over recent times is that it has taken two and a half<br />
weeks to get the dispute referred to the Full Bench and it<br />
wasn't being dealt with by the single Presidential member.<br />
Sir John Moore, as President of the Commission, did not have<br />
authority to take over that particular case in the national<br />
interest. That deficiency in the law will certainly be<br />
rectified when the Parliament meets, to make sure that the<br />
President of the Commission does have authority and.-full authority,<br />
to take over a case if he regards it as being in the national<br />
interest.<br />
A number of measures that we have introduced have, I believe,<br />
assisted in a better industrial scene. Section 45D of the<br />
Trade Practices Act has been useful on many occasions, especially<br />
in protecting Australian exports.<br />
We have a general position of seeking to support the various<br />
wage tribunals and the Arbitration Commission in particular.<br />
That doesn't mean to say we always approve or always like the<br />
decisions that those tribunals make, but the impartial umpire<br />
has been established in Australia for very good reasons.<br />
The rash of industrial disputes over recent times not all over<br />
wages but significantly over wages has come, as I believe,<br />
because there is a lack of willingness on a number of union<br />
leaders to accept arbitration; a great lack of willingness<br />
on the part of a number of union leaders to put aside bans and<br />
limitations and strikes and to allow the arbitration machinery<br />
to work. If this continues, it obviously maintains a very<br />
difficult position. It is totally irresponsible and totally<br />
against the interests of trade unions, the industries and the<br />
nation to go to industrial action as a first resort weapon,<br />
as so often is the case at the present time.<br />
It is against that background that Tony Street called a conference<br />
with the ACTU last Friday because we believed, at least, that<br />
the ACTU would be prepared to support the system of arbitration<br />
and to lend its weight and influence in that particular<br />
objective. Mr. Hawke refused to do so and indicated that it<br />
was because of Government policies and economic policies which<br />
he indicated, in his view, had reduced the living standards of<br />
the working people of Australia. Well, of course, the facts<br />
are quite different because average weekly earnings have not<br />
-fallen when measured against the CPI in any general sense.<br />
Both have marched, roughly, hand -in hand, over the last two to<br />
three years.<br />
Against that background, it is not possible to say that the<br />
system of indexation as it has been applied, has reduced the<br />
living standards of the working people around Australia../ </p>
<p>-7<br />
PRIME MINISTER ( continued)<br />
It's quite plain that unless there is to be a greater<br />
acceptance of arbitration concilation and arbitration<br />
and a greater acceptance of the decisions of that body must<br />
be accepted, then we are going to be faced with the kind<br />
of stand-up situation which I think you indicated, Mr. Chairman,<br />
when you introduced me a few moments ago.<br />
If the Government is forced into that particular position well<br />
then we will be. We will stay until the end of the course.<br />
But I feel on a number of occasions when industrial disputes<br />
have arisen, in the early stages there is fire and thunder<br />
and support but after the first few days and after the week<br />
how many people are there still in support? How many people<br />
are still in support at the end of the second week or would<br />
be at the end of the third? The test will come then, as to<br />
whether a community, if it is forced into that position, is<br />
prepared to stand and support a Government that is in that<br />
particular position. Because let there be no mistake about<br />
it, if a Government embarks upon that course, if my Government<br />
does, it will stay the course ' til the end of the race. I only<br />
hope, Mr. President, that your organisation and every other<br />
organisation involved in the private enterprise way of life<br />
will stay with us in relation to it. Because it is easy before<br />
the test is there. But if you have a situation, for example, in<br />
which there were no telephones of any kind in this State, how<br />
many people would stay with that. It is a serious matter.<br />
There are elderly people in homes who need to be able to ring<br />
up the doctor. There are elderly people living by themselves<br />
who need to have contact. There are hospitals that must be<br />
able to get contact for emergency supplies. If the union<br />
movement therefore, is prepared to shut down a total system as<br />
a result of a Government taking some further resolute action,<br />
the consequences could be very severe indeed.<br />
We need to understand these matters. It is the easiest thing<br />
in the world to say ' take out a club and knock somebody's head<br />
with that particular club'. But what we have to do is to make<br />
sure that this community works and to make sure that we try to<br />
get to a sensible resolution to industrial disputes. If a<br />
Government has to take action that leads to more difficult<br />
circumstances, if it has to proclaim some legislation which it<br />
has passed but has not yet proclaimed in relation to its own<br />
employees, then certainly it will be prepared to do so. But<br />
I just make the point that I have seen in one or two'other<br />
industrial disputes over the last two or three years that<br />
a Government starting to take that course very soon people start<br />
to say ' why don't you conciliate, why don't you negotiate, why<br />
don't you consult'.<br />
Mr. President, I think this is a matter of common concern.<br />
I would agree with you, with the thrust of your remark, </p>
<p>-8<br />
it is the only issue that could cause Australia to blow<br />
the 1980s and to destroy the advances of the last three years.<br />
In terms of the full thrust of the Government's economic policies,<br />
they will be maintained. Even if we don't have inflation<br />
as low as we had anticipated, even if it rises a bit as a result<br />
of oil pricing and also as a result of beef I believe it will<br />
be rising more in a number of other countries. If that is so,<br />
our exporters will still be becoming more competitive, will<br />
get into more markets and our industries-also will be encouraged<br />
because our inflation is below that of other countries.<br />
In the industrial arena, we can either consolidate the gains<br />
that we have won, work and support economic recovery, or we can<br />
destroy it. I believe that all in all we will show too much<br />
commonsense in Australia to blow it. Because we have opportunities<br />
and options available to us that are not available to all other<br />
countries. our inflation is now lower than many. Our<br />
industries are more competitive than they have been for seven<br />
or eight years and are getting into export markets in many<br />
places. I wonder how many people here realise that we can<br />
build, design and construct fishing vessels and win contracts<br />
against competition from Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore.<br />
That's a mark of what at least one Australian industry can do.<br />
Our home and our export markets are therefore more secure.<br />
We have great minerals; coal, iron ore, bauxite, nickel.<br />
There is $ 2,000 million worth of investment going into the coal<br />
industry now and another $ 2,000 million going into the bauxite/<br />
alumina industry. Because of economic stability in Australia,<br />
because of policies which encourage that kind of investment,<br />
we are likely to attract more than our fair share of the world<br />
investment in major commodities in minerals. Because of<br />
political stability of a kind that you don't find in every<br />
resource-producing nation, we will again attract more than our<br />
fair share, even if there is low world growth. Because of a<br />
world shortage of energy, because of our possession of coal<br />
and natural gas and a signifcant quanity of oil not as much<br />
as we need, but a significant-quantity, we are again much<br />
better placed than many other countries.<br />
For all these reasons, we have become a more attractive source<br />
for investment from overseas. We are a more reliable supplier<br />
than many other countries.<br />
Against this total background, Australia has many many advantages<br />
indeed. I believe that we will capitalise upon those advantages.<br />
It is certainly the intention and the policy of the Government<br />
to make sure that we do. That means keeping our economy right,<br />
even if sometimes it is some immediate political cost to ourselves.<br />
Because we are not prepared to throw away these advantages.<br />
We are not prepared to throw away the gains of the last three<br />
years. We have taken sometimes difficult decisions.' The mini-bidget<br />
was certainly one of them. But it would have been greatly<br />
irresponsible not to do the things that John Howard then announced.<br />
/ 9 </p>
<p>9<br />
I believe very strongly that we have the right policies,<br />
that they are responsible policies. In particular, they are<br />
the kind of policies that Australia's export industries need.<br />
The kind of policies that Australia's primary producers need.<br />
For the future, I believe we can see a prosperous rural sector.<br />
That is not only good for farmers and pastoralists, it is good<br />
for all Australians. I am certain that we can look forward<br />
to the 1980s with great confidence. 000---</p>
