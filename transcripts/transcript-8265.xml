PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 7 MARCH 1991<br />
EMBARGOED UNTIL MIDNIGHT<br />
JOINT STATEMENT WITH THE MINISTER ASSISTING THE PRIME<br />
MINISTER FOR THE STATUS OF WOMEN, WENDY FATIN<br />
The establishment of a National Child Protection Council, a<br />
Prime Ministerial award for the encouragement of women in<br />
sport, development of a major statement on women and the<br />
environment and the extension for three years of the<br />
Commonwealth/ State Council on Non-English Speaking<br />
Background Women's Issues are among initiatives announced by<br />
the Government for International Women's Day today.<br />
This year's si: nitiatives will build on progress already made<br />
by the Government in the implementation of its National<br />
Agenda for Women.<br />
Since the Government took office in 1983, we have<br />
demonstrated an ongoing commitment to improving the position<br />
of Australian women. That commitment has recognised that<br />
real equality is founded on encouragement from an early age,<br />
on access, on opportunity, on economic independence and<br />
physical well-being.<br />
The initiatives announced today are aimed at enabling the<br />
women of Australia to participate to an even greater extent<br />
in the economic and social framework of this nation.<br />
This Government leads the world with its comprehensive<br />
machinery and policies for raising the status of women.<br />
Today's initiatives will continue this process.<br />
In addition to the four newly funded initiatives, we also<br />
announce a series of initiatives which will draw on existing<br />
funding.<br />
These include the development of a national strategy for the<br />
implementation of the International Labour Organisation<br />
Convention 156 on Workers with Family Responsibilities, a<br />
new computer system monitoring the appointment of women to<br />
Government boards and authorities and the publication of a<br />
comprehensive statistical profile on women by the Australian<br />
Bureau of Statistics.<br />
A detailed list of the IWD initiatives is being distributed<br />
by Ms Fatin. </p>
