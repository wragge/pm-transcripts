JbAUSTRALIA<br />
PRIME MINISTER1<br />
FOR MEDIA-SUNDAY, 16 JANUARY 1983<br />
WAGE PAUSE<br />
The Commonwealth Government has welcomed the decisions of the<br />
Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and some State Tribunals<br />
that there should be a wage pause for at least six months. T~ hese<br />
decisions, following the unprecedented level of agreemeInt between<br />
all governmenLs at the December Premiers' Conference that there<br />
should be a pause, reflect a con~ Eonsus which is developing iii<br />
the Austral ian community.<br />
All. Australia's economic indicators, including tho OECD) forecast<br />
released some cdays ago, show that a 12 month wage pause<br />
remains desirable.<br />
I have been concerned about the attitude which some--unions have<br />
taken about the pause. Before I returned to work, Mr Anthony,<br />
as Acting Prime Minister, wrote to the President of the ACTU<br />
seeking his support in helping to give the wage pause a chance<br />
to work. I wrote to 1' 1r Dolan last week to reinforce what<br />
Mr Anthony said.<br />
I believe the Australian community expects the union movement<br />
to do its bit so that we will not see more jobs lost because<br />
of further wage increases following the high increases in<br />
wages and labour costs of the last two years.<br />
Every government has taken or is taking action to implement a<br />
pause in both the public and the private sectors, as all<br />
governments agreed at, the Premiers' Conference.<br />
In its judgement in December, the Australian Conciliation and<br />
Arbitration Commission said: " Any departure from them ( the<br />
guidelines laid down by the Commission for the wage pause) could<br />
impair the viability of the pause and threaten the employment<br />
of many thousands of persons"<br />
The wage pause must be successful if more Australians are not<br />
to lose their jobs.<br />
We may not be able to do much to improve thc inte: rnational<br />
economic outlook or offset the effects of the drought. But we<br />
can control our own wages. We can improve the competitiveness<br />
of Australian industry, and hence its ability to employ. We<br />
can save jobs.<br />
We must all get behind the pause and give it a chance to work.<br />
Those of us who have jobs owe that to our many fellow Australians<br />
who want or who are concerned that they may lose the jobs they<br />
hmio now. </p>
