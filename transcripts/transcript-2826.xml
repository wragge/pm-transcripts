CEASEFIRF AGREENEIRNT IN LAOS<br />
0 The Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator<br />
Willesee, today welcomed the achievement of a ceasefire agreement<br />
i n Laos. The Acting Minister recalled that the 1962 Geneva<br />
Agreement on Laos, which Australia had supported, had not<br />
succeeded in preserving peace in that country. He said that it<br />
was Australia's earnest hope that this present agreement would be<br />
fully observed and would lead to a durable political settlement.<br />
Senator Willesee noted that the agreement in Laos,<br />
following upon the recent ceasefire agreement in Viet-Nam,<br />
represented another step towards the restoration of peac e<br />
throughout Indo-China. It was to be hoped that a ceasefire in<br />
the Khmer Re-public would not be long delayed.<br />
Senator Willesee reaffirmed Australia's readiness to<br />
assist generously in the peaceful economic reconstruction of all<br />
the countries of Indo-China, and hoped that conditions on the<br />
ground would soon nermit the formulation and implementation of<br />
Australian aid programmes. </p>
