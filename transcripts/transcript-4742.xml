PRES S OFFICE TRANSCRIPT 23 JUNE 1978 7(/ 7<br />
INTERVIEW ON SIDE STEPS OF<br />
PARLIAMENT HOUSE<br />
_ gJESTION: The Premiers seem to be in a state of shock. Do you<br />
care to comment on that?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't think the Premiers are in a state of<br />
shock at al_. I believe they expected very much what the<br />
Commonwealth offered yesterday. Overall the funds increased<br />
by marginally over 5 percent and you know the day has got<br />
to stop when governments believe that they can go on spending<br />
year after year after year a larger proportion of the products<br />
of Australia. Governments overseas have tried that and it's<br />
perpetuated the situation in which inflation has been too high<br />
and unemployment has remained too high. My Government has no<br />
intention whatever of pursuing that path. We've made very<br />
considerable progress in overcoming inflation and considerable<br />
progress in getting interest rates down and we intend to<br />
continue with that policy that will achieve success in both<br />
those directions. because by doing that, we will be doing more<br />
to help businesses, small businesses, farmers, people throughout<br />
this country than any other single act of Government.<br />
QUESTION: unless you are dramatically successful, Prime Minister, with the<br />
inflation rate, the five percent increase will in fact add up<br />
to a decrease in real terms. Is it necessary to be that harsh<br />
with the Premiers?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: It's not harsh at all. Five percent increase<br />
in money terms if there is any improvement in productivity<br />
should be able to maintain the same levels of activity. Now<br />
Premiers over the last two years have reduced taxes, they've<br />
done that, and at the same time, maintained . levels of<br />
programs. They've been able to exercise their own choices.<br />
I don't quarrel with the choices they've made. We believe<br />
taxes have been too high but we need to understand also the<br />
state and local government employment has gone up by four<br />
percent in the 12 months to March; Commonwealth employment<br />
by 0.8 percent and we've had reductions in the two previous<br />
years, so when you look to see what restraint state governments<br />
have exercised up to this point, you've only got to look at<br />
their employment state government employment and local<br />
government employment and if there's a four percent increase<br />
in the 12 months to March, it is perfectly clear that-* there<br />
has been no restraint whatsoever.<br />
QUESTION: Don Dunstan, Prime Minister, has indicated that your<br />
economic moves may increase unemployment to ten percent.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I think that's nonsense, He's a Labor Premier,<br />
he's perfectly entitled to think whatever he likes.<br />
What will really get this country moving, what will really<br />
establish the circumstances in which there will be jobs for<br />
those who want to work, is a revival in the private sector,<br />
in investment, confidence in this country from people in Australia<br />
and from overseas; to maintain the confidence that<br />
we are re-establishing, have to make sure that inflation<br />
continues to come down, we have to make sure that Government </p>
<p>-2<br />
PRIME MINISTER: ( continued)<br />
expenditure remains under tight control. That will make<br />
this country a favoured nation for investment, from our own<br />
people and from people overseas. You know its very easy<br />
on government account, to spend some hundreds of millions of<br />
dollars more and think you are thereby employing more people.<br />
but if in the same process you alter the perceptions of this<br />
economy, by people in Australia and by people overseas; if<br />
they think as a consequence that inflation will run out,<br />
that interest rates will start to rise, you'll find you'll<br />
lose very much more than that in investment and therefore<br />
for every Government job you might get, you could lose three<br />
jobs in the private sector. Now my Government hasn't got the<br />
slightest intention of embarking on that path and I believe<br />
that what happened yesterday is right for Australia. I have<br />
not the slightest doubt of that and in their hearts I suspect<br />
a number of the Premiers also know it.<br />
