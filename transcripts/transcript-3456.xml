PRESS STATEMENT NO. 371<br />
November 1974<br />
APPOINTMENTS TO THE PRICES JUSTIFICATION TRIBUNAL<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr. Whitlam, announced today<br />
the appointment of the following as full-time members of<br />
the Prices Justification Tribunal:<br />
Mr. K. Elliott<br />
Mr. G. N. Fisher<br />
Mr. P. C. Rodda<br />
Mr. Whitlam said that the Government was reinforcing<br />
the Tribunal at this time because of the increased<br />
responsibilities placed upon it by recent amendments to the<br />
Prices Justification Act and because of the already great<br />
workload on the Tribunal.<br />
In particular, the Tribunal will now be giving<br />
increasing attention to the retail area and the prices of<br />
imported goods. These are complex fields in which detailed<br />
work has to be done and which demand a high degree of<br />
relevant commercial experience.<br />
The new members all have long and senior experience<br />
on the manufacturing or distributive sides of industry.<br />
They will therefore bring with them knowledge and understanding<br />
that will assist the Tribunal in all aspects of its work.<br />
Mr. Fisher is being appointed to the Sydney office<br />
and the other new members will be located in Melbourne.<br />
CANBERRA, A. C. T. </p>
