FOR PRE3SS 24 NOVT2NBER .1977<br />
AUIDRES$ AT LUNC~ IMME R?\ LLY, BRISBANE<br />
in this election the people of Qoeensland will be makirtg<br />
fundamental decisions about Australia's future -the future<br />
our families and children will live in. The thing-that is<br />
at stake on December 10 is not juist a choice between political<br />
parties. it is an election to decide about the country we<br />
want to live in. The choice on Decem,,-ber 10 is clear.<br />
Do you want to buil1d on the hard won achievements of the past two<br />
years? Or do you want to l(_ t Tabor throw it all away?<br />
Do you lwant the growth and development that only the Liberal/<br />
N~ ationial Country Party coalition can tiring? or do you want the<br />
Btagnation that Labor once again will create? Do you want the<br />
extreme-tnionists to be controlled? Do you want responsible<br />
unionists to bDe-g; iven-a flair gjo? Or do you want to surrender<br />
to tho extremistS?<br />
This eiection is your chance to say whether you want your<br />
govern-ant to further reeduce inflation, to create jobs that<br />
people Can keep? Whetber you want to risk Labor's experiments<br />
that. rooketEed ir-flation to 19 percent, that increased unemployment<br />
by 157 percent, by 19/ 0,000 people in one year? Your chance to<br />
-ay ; 6.4zet-er you wanrt to protect . iniltiative and enterprise? Or whethe<br />
you want to allow Labor to start its giant tax rip-off again<br />
' T. hese are the real issues in this elect. ion but there is another<br />
fundamental question) Ne must answer, Axe we go-ing to have a debate<br />
on the policies and programmes that affect Australia? Or are<br />
we going to let Labor get away with pftting Australia's politics<br />
into the gutter? I<br />
That's what they've been trying to do fight a campaign by smear<br />
arid-innuendo; fight a campaigh by playing the man; Labor are fight<br />
the dirtiest c-ipaign I have ever wvitnessed in my 22 years in<br />
Parliament.<br />
Labor searchec ali to find a Parliament that was still in sessi<br />
and a Prieiaanthat was willing to abuse the privileges<br />
of Parliament. Tihe Labor Party that so gravely damaged Australia<br />
when they were in government with their scandals, their irresponsibil<br />
their incompeternce are now trying to fight an. election by smear.<br />
Axe we going to let themr get away with . it? They are fighting this<br />
election the same way they fought the 1975 election. Then, they<br />
had no policies. They talkied about democracy being under threat<br />
and they tried to fight the election in unleashing their thugs<br />
against the Governor General. </p>
<p>This time they're trying to hide their destructive and irresponsible<br />
policies by stooping to the gutter. The Leaaer of the OppDsit Ionthe<br />
man who tried to borrow money from a foreign government<br />
to run his election campaign; thbe man who tried to ruile without<br />
supply; the man who is the only Australian Prime M~ inister ever<br />
to be dismissed, is now talking about integrity.<br />
What a shameful shabby charade.<br />
Ladies and gentleen, let's be perfectly clear about this.<br />
the Government that I lead will not have a bar of these gutCter<br />
tactics. We will not wear it and neither will the Axistralian people.<br />
The reason Labor has to resort to these tactics is because they have<br />
no constructive policies. Their econowic policy is in total<br />
confusion. All Labor offers is a return to the old extravagances<br />
of 1972-75, the -imposition of an additional $ 1900 million of<br />
taxeson Australians, and an expensive and ineffective ,31 subsidy<br />
schEqne. The Australian people will reject this confusion<br />
masquerading as a po'icy. They will reject Labor ' s approach<br />
to industrial relations.<br />
in his 45 minute policy speech, Mir Whtilam ( lid not have one<br />
constructive word to propose about the trade unions the left<br />
wing union leaders wouldn't allow it. The left wing uonions<br />
pay Rioney to the Labor Party. The-y have a large voice in<br />
determining official ALJP policy. That's why it is Labor's official<br />
policy to put unions above the law. That's why Labor endloxsed<br />
the Victorian power strike. They endforsed a striYke which laid off<br />
450,00) people for weeks, they endorsed a strike which threw<br />
36,000 peole completely out of a job.<br />
Labor's policy of letting the tr-ade unionts have their<br />
head resulted in a record period of strikes and industrial<br />
lawlessness when they were in office. We have shown that a<br />
government prepared to take a firm and fair stand can protect thepublic.<br />
We have shown this in the air controller strike,<br />
in the postal workers dispute, int the case of the ACTO'* s, uranium<br />
moratorium they backed down. And in the Victorian power<br />
dispute,, it was our move to deregister the unions involved that<br />
led to the strikers returning to work.<br />
Unlike the Labor Party we have taken the view that no one can be<br />
above the law. That individual unionists have a right to be<br />
heara, and to be protected from intimidationo; that it is the<br />
responsibility of the Government to protect the interests of the<br />
whole community.<br />
We have passed laws protecting individual unionists, and give.<br />
responsible rank and file unionists the chance to make their voices<br />
heard. Secret postal ballots for union elections are now<br />
compulsory. There is a four year ceiling on the term of office<br />
of union officials. We have set up thbe industrial Relations<br />
B3ureau to protect the public interest and also to act as an.<br />
industrial ombudsman. Unions are now required to tell their<br />
mernb;-rs how union dues are spent. We are protecting individuals<br />
against being forced to join. unions against their will.<br />
Damagin~ g secondary boycotts have been banned. I </p>
<p>3.<br />
ReSpon~ siblte unionists have welcomed these laws. only -the<br />
e&gt; xtreamistg and the Labor Party have fougnti against thorr,<br />
These laws are a major step forcward in the trade -tnion area.<br />
Th o p l c e r o n e f c n i n~ t~ a m r w l h a v e a<br />
woh itcanmstu ctaves plic whtsoverto* of fer in this<br />
area. Labor wouold back dovrn-von th~ se vital laws. IA vote for<br />
the Goveriiiient in this election i, 5 a vote for firmi, -Fair and<br />
const.-uctlve tLLrade uinion policies.<br />
Mx Whitlam's policy spocch fails to deal at all with vital questions<br />
of foreign policy and defence. Labor bas no defence policyat<br />
the ALP's Conference last June, all Mr Whitlam could lamely<br />
say was! " ThEse is no report on defence matters because no agenda<br />
items were rcievecl".<br />
Yet Fx. Whitlai asks Australians to place their defence in his hands.<br />
necare~ s so much about def ence that hie wanted Mri Hayden to do the<br />
job in his spare time after looking after foreign affairslie<br />
was not gamne to itentioni the vital Pine Gap agreemenit in his<br />
policy speech for fLear of antagoniging the extreme left-wing.<br />
Yes-* ei-day he Thi cd die! support the 10 year extension of the<br />
Pine Gap agree -ment but is that offiCial tabor policy?<br />
Lot's he ar from the Deputy Leader, Kr turen, oni whether he agrees<br />
with his leader on t;--his vital issue. And what does Labor think<br />
about our-internal security? The-Royal Corrmssion on Security and<br />
lijtelliaqerce reported that there exists seriour, threats to Austr-alia<br />
from subversion and espionage. Let ine quote the Commissioner's<br />
words the wordzs of an erna'lneft. judge appointed by Mrii whitlan:<br />
" The two main communist parties, the Communist Party of<br />
A-ustralia and the Socialist Party of Australia, have btrong<br />
influence in sorte unions".<br />
" They exercise a power greatly in excess of~ thiat which their<br />
nvimbers would justify".<br />
" At times they make use of industrial disputes for their<br />
own poli-tical purposes".<br />
We have acccepted the Royal Commission's recommendations and will<br />
bring in more lenjislatiofl to strengthen ASIO. Mr Hawke bas<br />
attacked the r. zt-he couild not resist the pressure to do so<br />
from the very ' znicnis to which Mr Justice Hope refers.<br />
Mr Whbitlam rsominously silent hoping none will notice<br />
his ermbarasscnt, his dilemmna. Y-et Labor asks Australians to<br />
place their se-rcu-rity in thsi hands. </p>
<p>4.<br />
The choice in this election is clear. A vote for the Liberal Party<br />
is a vote for prosperity through growth and development of<br />
Queensland, of Australia.<br />
A vote for the Labor Party is a vote for growth of big government<br />
but of stagnation and recession for Queensland and Australia.<br />
We are on the point of breakthrough to real economic recovery.<br />
Let's not allow Labor to throw it away. With your support, this<br />
Government will continue doing the job. </p>
