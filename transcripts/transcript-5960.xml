SPEECH , DELIVERED<br />
SENATOR THE HON. A. J. MESSNER<br />
MINISTER FOR VETERANS' AFFAIRS<br />
MINISTER ASSISTING THE TREASURER<br />
AT THE<br />
1982 ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN COUNCIL OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT ASSOCIATIONS<br />
ALICE SPRINGS<br />
ON BEHALF OF<br />
THE RT. HON. J. M. FRASER CH MP<br />
PRIME MINISTER </p>
<p>MR PRESIDENT, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN<br />
I AM VERY PLEASED TO BE ABLE TO REPRESENT THE PRIME<br />
MINISTER AND ADDRESS YOU ON THIS OCCASION.<br />
I ALSO APPRECIATE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE IN ALICE<br />
SPRINGS. APART FROM ITS OBVIOUS ATTRACTIONS, WE SOUTH<br />
AUSTRALIANS FEEL A SPECIAL AFFINITY FOR THE NORTHERN<br />
TERRITORY. IT WAS, AFTER ALL, A PART OF THE STATE<br />
UNTIL 1911 WHEN IT WAS TRANSFERRED TO THE COMMONWEALTH,<br />
AND BY BOTH HISTORY AND GEOGRAPHY WE REMAIN THE STATE<br />
WITH CLOSEST LINKS TO THE TERRITORY.<br />
A LOT HAS HAPPENED, HOWEVER, SINCE SOUTH AUSTRALIA SHED<br />
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE INFANT NORTHERN TERRITORY NEARLY<br />
72 YEARS AGO. THE POPULATION OF THE TERRITORY IN 1911<br />
( EXCLUDING ABORIGINES, WHO AT THAT STAGE WERE NOT<br />
INCLUDED IN CENSUSES) WAS A MERE 3,300. TODAY ALICE<br />
SPRINGS ALONE IS OVER 5 TIMES THAT SIZE, AND THE<br />
TERRITORY'S POPULATION IS 130,000 AND GROWING MUCH FASTER<br />
THAN THE REST OF THE COUNTRY. THE PROSPECTS ARE GOOD FOR<br />
A CONTINUATION OF THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT THAT HAS<br />
PRODUCED THIS STRONG GROWTH. THE TERRITORY HAS NOW<br />
CEASED TO BE A WARD OF THE COMMONWEALTH AND, THROUGH<br />
SELF-GOVERNMENT, EXERCISES MOST OF THE POWER OF A<br />
STATE. AS FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT THE REASON WHY WE ARE<br />
HERE, AFTER ALL ALICE SPRINGS, DARWIN, KATHERINE AND<br />
TENNANT CREEK ALL HAVE THEIR OWN LOCAL COUNCILS.<br />
I </p>
<p>SO YESTERDAY'S CHILD IS FAST BECOMING A LUSTY YOUNG<br />
ADULT, AND THE REST OF AUSTRALIA IS SITTING UP AND<br />
TAKING NOTICE. IN SOUTH AUSTRALIA WE LOOK FORWARD<br />
VERY MUCH TO DEVELOPING CLOSER TIES WITH OUR VIGOROUS<br />
NORTHERN NEIGHBOUR. THERE IS ALREADY TANGIBLE SIGN OF<br />
THIS IN THE NEW RAILWAY FROM TARCOOLA TO ALICE SPRINGS,<br />
AND WITHIN FIVE YEARS THE STUART HIGHWAY WILL BE SEALED<br />
ALL THE WAY. LOOKING TOWARDS THE TOP END, THERE IS THE<br />
PROSPECT OF THE LONG-AWAITED AND OFT-PLANNED RAILWAY<br />
LINKING DARWIN TO ALICE SPRINGS AND THE REST OF<br />
AUSTRALIA. THE PAST YEAR<br />
SINCE YOU MET LAST IN THIS GATHERING THERE HAVE BEEN A<br />
NUMBER OF IMPORTANT DEVELOPMENTS IN AUSTRALIA AND IN<br />
THE WORLD GENERALLY THAT HAVE HAD, AND WILL CONTINUE<br />
TO HAVE, A SIGNIFICANT BEARING ON THE TASKS YOU ARE<br />
ASKED TO PERFORM.<br />
THE WORLD ECONOMY IS IN THE GRIP OF A VERY SERIOUS<br />
DOWNTURN AND ITS EFFECTS ARE FAMILIAR TO US ALL. IN<br />
ALL THE MAJOR INDUSTRIALISED COUNTRIES, PRODUCTION IS<br />
DEPRESSED AND UNEMPLOYMENT IS RISING. FOR AUSTRALIA<br />
THIS HAS MEANT:-</p>
<p>3.<br />
REDUCED DEMAND AND FALLING PRICES FOR OUR EXPORTS:<br />
OVERSEAS INDUSTRIES ARE REDUCING THEIR DEMAND FOR<br />
RAW MATERIALS SUCH AS IRON AND COAL;<br />
DEFERMENT OF MANY DEVELOPMENT PROPOSALS AS PROSPECTIVE<br />
OVERSEAS MARKETS FADE; AND<br />
INCREASED COMPETITION FROM IMPORTS.<br />
WE CANNOT KEEP OURSELVES IMMUNE FROM THESE TRENDS. AND<br />
WHILE WE REMAIN LESS ADVERSELY AFFECTED THAN MANY OTHER<br />
COUNTRIES, THERE ARE TWO ADDITIONAL MATTERS OF CONCERN<br />
FOR AUSTRALIA. OUR INFLATION RATE IS PRESENTLY RUNNING<br />
ABOVE THOSE OF MOST OF OUR MAJOR COMPETITORS. FOR ALL<br />
OF US IN GOVERNMENT, BE IT FEDERAL, STATE OR LOCAL, THE<br />
REDUCTION IN THE RATE OF INFLATION MUST REMAIN A PRIME<br />
) OBJECTIVE. THE SECOND PROBLEM I MENTION IS, OF COURSE,<br />
THE WIDESPREAD DROUGHT THAT IS DEVASTATING SO MUCH OF<br />
EASTERN AUSTRALIA.<br />
IN SUCH TIMES THE PROBLEMS OF ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT FACING<br />
THE COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY.<br />
SUBDUED ECONOMIC ACTIVITY HAS CONCOMITANT EFFECTS ON<br />
REVENUE GROWTH. HIGHER UNEMPLOYMENT, THE NEED FOR<br />
DROUGHT RELIEF, AND THE GENERAL CASE FOR ECONOMIC<br />
STIMULUS, LEAD TO INCREASED EXPENDITURES OR TO TAX<br />
CUTS. BUT THE CONTINUING NEED TO CONTAIN INFLATION, </p>
<p>AND THE ADVERSE EFFECTS OF HIGH INTEREST RATES, ARE A<br />
POWERFUL CONSTRAINT AGAINST ALLOWING THE BUDGET DEFICIT<br />
TO BALLOON OUT.<br />
THE COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT HAS NEVERTHELESS BEEN<br />
ADDRESSING THE ECONOMIC CHALLENGES FACING AUSTRALIA<br />
IN A VIGOROUS AND POSITIVE WAY. THE HOUSING PACKAGE<br />
) PROVIDED IN MARCH, THE ECONOMIC MEASURES AGREED AT THE<br />
PREMIERS' CONFERENCE AND LOAN COUNCIL MEETING IN JUNE<br />
FOLLOWED BY THE ASSISTANCE FOR INDUSTRY ANNOUNCED IN JULY<br />
AND THE MEASURES SET OUT IN THE BUDGET BROUGHT DOWN BY MY<br />
COLLEAGUE THE TREASURER IN AUGUST HAVE ALL BEEN DESIGNED<br />
TO SHIELD AUSTRALIANS SO FAR AS IS POSSIBLE FROM THE<br />
ADVERSE EFFECTS OF THE WORLD RECESSION AND TO PLACE US IN<br />
A POSITION WHERE WE WILL BE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF<br />
THE WORLD UPTURN WHENEVER IT COMES.<br />
SO, AS WE ARE ALL AWARE, THE PAST YEAR HAS NOT BEEN AN<br />
EASY ONE FOR GOVERNMENTS AT ANY LEVEL. WE HAVE ALL HAD<br />
TO TIGHTEN OUR BELTS AND ENSURE THAT THOSE RESOURCES WE<br />
HAVE ARE USED AS EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY AS POSSIBLE.<br />
IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES THE COMMONWEALTH'S CONTINUING<br />
COMMITMENT TO ASSISTING LOCAL GOVERNMENT IS OF EVEN<br />
GREATER SIGNIFICANCE. </p>
<p>TAX SHARING<br />
IN 1982-83 GRANTS TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT UNDER THE PERSONAL<br />
INCOME TAX SHARING ARRANGEMENTS HAVE RISEN BY 21 PERCENT.<br />
THIS CONTINUES A SERIES OF ANNUAL INCREASES WHICH HAS SEEN<br />
GENERAL REVENUE ASSISTANCE TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT RISE FROM<br />
MILLION UNDER THE LABOR GOVERNMENT TO $ 424.9 MILLION<br />
IN 1982/ 83. AS A RESULT LOCAL GOVERNMENT HAS RECEIVED<br />
ABOUT $ 1783 MILLION IN UNTIED GRANTS IN THE SEVEN YEARS<br />
OF THE TAX SHARING ARRANGEMENTS. THE FACT THAT THE GRANTS<br />
ARE UNTIED IS AS IMPORTANT AS THE AMOUNTS PROVIDED,<br />
BECAUSE THIS GIVES LOCAL AUTHORITIES THE FREEDOM AND<br />
RESPONSIBILITY TO DETERMINE THEIR OWN EXPENDITURE<br />
PRIORITIES. THE COMMONWEALTH IS AWARE OF THE DEBATE WITHIN THE<br />
ASSOCIATION ON WHETHER THE GRANTS SHOULD CONTINUE TO BE<br />
BASED ON 2 PERCENT OF PERSONAL INCOME TAX COLLECTIONS<br />
IN THE PREVIOUS FINANCIAL YEAR OR BE RELATED TO TOTAL<br />
TAX COLLECTIONS. IT IS EASY TO UNDERSTAND THE CONCERN<br />
OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT WHEN THERE IS SPECULATION ABOUT<br />
BROADENING OF THE TAX BASE TO REDUCE THE BURDEN ON PAYE<br />
TAXPAYERS. LET ME JUST SAY THAT THE COMMONWEALTH WOULD<br />
BE PREPARED TO CONSIDER ANY CASE FOR CHANGE WHICH LOCAL<br />
GOVERNMENT COLLECTIVELY THROUGH THIS ASSOCIATION WAS TO<br />
PUT FORWARD. </p>
<p>THE COMMONWEALTH IS ALSO AWARE THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENT<br />
WOULD LIKE TO SEE ITS SHARE OF PERSONAL INCOME TAX<br />
COLLECTIONS ( OR SOME BROADER TAX BASE) RAISED FROM 2 PERCENT<br />
TO SAY 3 OR 4~ PERCENT. THIS IS AGAIN UNDERSTANDABLEALL<br />
LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT FACE A SITUATION WHERE THE<br />
DEMANDS ON THEIR RESOURCES ARE EVER-GROWING. I AM<br />
SURE THAT NO ONE WISHES ME TO REITERATE VIEWS ON THIS<br />
ISSUE WHICH HAVE BEEN EXPRESSED ON PREVIOUS OCCASIONS.-<br />
BUT MY COLLEAGUE, THE HON. IAN WILSON, MP, MADE SOME<br />
IMPORTANT POINTS WHEN, AS PARLIAMENTARY SECRETARY TO<br />
THE PRIME MINISTER, HE ADDRESSED YOU IN 1980:-<br />
THOSE WISHING A GREATER SHARE OF THE PUBLIC'S MONEY<br />
NEED TO BE ABLE TO JUSTIFY CLEARLY THEIR NEED FOR IT<br />
-YOU MUST JUSTIFY SUCH A REQUEST ON THE BASIS OF<br />
YOUR REVENUE NEEDS; YOUR TAXING CAPACITY; YOUR<br />
TAXING EFFORT AND ANY INCREASE OR DECREASE IN<br />
LOCAL GOVERNMENT'S FUNCTIONS AND RESPONSIBILITIES;<br />
* AS FAR AS POSSIBLE, THOSE MAKING A CLAIM ON THE PUBLIC<br />
PURSE SHOULD TAKE THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR LEVYING THE<br />
TAXES, CHARGES, ETC. REQUIRED TO RAISE IT, WITHOUT<br />
LEAVING THE " DIRTY WORK" TO OTHERS; AND </p>
<p>TO MAINTAIN ITS INTEGRITY AS AN INDEPENDENT ENTITY,*<br />
LOCAL GOVERNMENT MUST TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR A<br />
LARGE PART OF ITS OWN REVENUE RAISING.<br />
AT THE SAME TIME, IT IS ONLY FAIR THAT I SHOULD NOT GIVE<br />
ANY FALSE ENCOURAGEMENT. AS I HAVE NOTED, THE PRESSURES<br />
ON THE COMMONWEALTH'S BUDGET IN PRESENT ECONOMIC<br />
CIRCUMSTANCES ARE VERY GREAT. AND MANY OTHER SECTORS<br />
OF THE COMMUNITY COULD QUITE LEGITIMATELY POINT TO THIS<br />
YEAR'S 21 PERCENT INCREASE IN UNTIED FUNDS FOR LOCAL<br />
GOVERNMENT AS BEING CONSIDERABLY MORE GENEROUS THAN THE<br />
TREATMENT THEY HAVE RECEIVED.<br />
ONE ASPECT OF THE TAX SHARING ARRANGEMENTS WHICH IS OF<br />
CONSIDERABLE AND GROWING CONCERN TO THE COMMONWEALTHI<br />
HOWEVER, IS A TENDENCY BY SOME STATE GOVERNMENTS TO USE<br />
THE INCREASED FUNDS MADE AVAILABLE BY THE COMMONWEALTH<br />
FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT AS AN EXCUSE TO REDUCE STATE FUNDING<br />
OF PROGRAMS WHICH DIRECTLY AFFECT LOCAL GOVERNMENT. A<br />
RECENT INSTANCE OF THIS OCCURRED IN THE NEW SOUTH-WALES<br />
BUDGET. THE NEW SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT WITHDREW ITS<br />
CONTRIBUTION TO THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE FUND<br />
AND REDUCED ITS COMMITMENT TO THE MANDATORY PENSIONER<br />
REBATE SCHEME. THE NEW SOUTH WALES MINISTER FOR LOCAL<br />
GOVERNMENT AND LANDS, THE HON. A. R. L. GORDON, MADE IT<br />
CLEAR IN HIS SPEECH TO THE NEW SOUTH WALES LOCAL </p>
<p>GOVERNMENT ASSOCIATION IN GOULBURN IN OCTOBER THAT THE<br />
STATE GOVERNMENT'S DECISIONS WERE BASED ON A VIEW THAT<br />
THE 21 PERCENT RISE IN FEDERAL REVENUE SHARING MONEY<br />
GAVE LOCAL GOVERNMENT THE CAPACITY TO ABSORB THE<br />
REDUCTIONS IN STATE FUNDING. THE COMMONWEALTH, HOWEVER,<br />
IS FIRMLY OF THE VIEW THAT SUCH AN APPROACH IS A MAJOR<br />
IMPEDIMENT TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF A CO-OPERATIVE AND<br />
HARMONIOUS RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE THREE SPHERES OF<br />
GOVERNMENT. LOAN COUNCIL<br />
THE COMMONWEALTH'S PACKAGE TO THE LOAN COUNCIL THIS YEAR<br />
PRODUCED SOME HISTORIC DECISIONS. THE STATES NOW HAVE<br />
FREEDOM TO DETERMINE THE SIZE OF THEIR ELECTRICITY<br />
BORROWINGS AND TO SET THE INTEREST RATES ON THEM. THIS<br />
WILL MAKE THE STATES RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR OWN ELECTRICITY<br />
PROGRAMS, AND THAT GREATER DEGREE OF RESPONSIBILITY WILL<br />
BE WELCOMED BY THE COMMUNITY.<br />
UNDER THE ' GENTLEMEN'S AGREEMENT' ORIGINATING IN 1936, THE<br />
LOAN COUNCIL HAS APPROVED AN AGGREGATE ANNUAL NEW MONEY<br />
BORROWING PROGRAM FOR ' LARGER' SEMI-GOVERNMENT AND LOCAL<br />
AUTHORITIES. AT THE JUNE 1982 MEETING, THE LOAN COUNCIL<br />
APPROVED A NEW MONEY BORROWING PROGRAM FOR THE STATES'<br />
' LARGER' NON-ELECTRICITY AUTHORITIES FOR 1982-83 OF<br />
$ 878 MILLION ( EXCLUDING ADDITIONS FOR INFRASTRUCTURE<br />
FINANCING). </p>
<p>THE LOAN COUNCIL ALSO DECIDED AT THAT MEETING TO<br />
INCREASE FROM $ 1.2 MILLION ( THE LIMIT WHICH HAS APPLIED<br />
SINCE 1979-80) TO $ 1.5 MILLION, THE ANNUAL LIMIT TO<br />
WHICH SMALLER AUTHORITIES CAN INDIVIDUALLY BORROW WITHOUT<br />
REQUIRING A LOAN COUNCIL PROGRAM. THE LOAN COUNCIL FURTHER<br />
APPROVED WORKING ARRANGEMENTS THAT WOULD ALLOW THE STATES,<br />
IF THEY WISHED, TO ESTABLISH CENTRAL BORROWING AUTHORITIES<br />
TO RAISE FUNDS, INTER ALIA, ON BEHALF OF ' SMALLER'<br />
AUTHORITIES. THE COMMONWEALTH IS PHILOSOPHICALLY ATTACHED TO THE<br />
CONCEPT OF PROVIDING GENERAL PURPOSE RATHER THAN SPECIFIC<br />
PURPOSE FUNDING FOR BOTH STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS.<br />
BUT WHILE MAJOR EMPHASIS IS PLACED ON THE TAX SHARING<br />
ARRANGEMENTS, THERE REMAIN SEVERAL AREAS WHERE SIGNIFICANT<br />
CONTRIBUTIONS ARE MADE FOR SPECIFIC PURPOSES.<br />
COMMONWEALTH ROAD FUNDING<br />
IN THE BUDGET, THE COMMONWEALTH ANNOUNCED THE ESTABLISHMENT<br />
OF THE AUSTRALIAN BICENTENNIAL ROAD DEVELOPMENT ( ABRD)<br />
PROGRAM. THIS IMAGINATIVE PROGRAM IS A MAJOR INITIATIVE<br />
INVOLVING EXPENDITURE OF ABOUT $ 2,500 MILLION TO<br />
SIGNIFICANTLY UPGRADE AUSTRALIA'S ROAD SYSTEM BY 1988.<br />
REVENUE RAISED BY WAY OF A SURCHARGE ON PETROL AND DIESEL </p>
<p>FUEL EXCISE WILL BE PAID INTO A SPECIAL TRUST FUND FROM<br />
WHICH THE AUSTRALIAN BICENTENNIAL ROAD DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM<br />
WILL BE FINANCED.<br />
THE PROGRAM HAS THE FOLLOWING BICENTENNIAL OBJECTIVES:-<br />
TO BRING THE NATIONAL HIGHWAY SYSTEM TO ACCEPTABLE<br />
STANDARDS;<br />
STO ASSIST THE DEVELOPMENT OF MAJOR URBAN AND RURAL<br />
ARTERIAL ROADS AND, WHERE DESIRED BY THE STATES, TO<br />
SASSIST WITH APPROVED URBAN PUBLIC TRANSPORT PROJECTS;<br />
STO ACCELERATE THE CONSTRUCTION OF CURRENT DEVELOPMENTAL<br />
ROAD PROJECTS, INCLUDING ROADS OF NATIONAL TOURISM<br />
IMPORTANCE; AND<br />
TO ASSIST LOCAL GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES TO UPGRADE THEIR<br />
ROAD SYSTEMS. </p>
<p>11<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN BICENTENNIAL ROAD DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM IS<br />
ADDITIONAL TO THE EXISTING COMMONWEALTH FIVE YEAR, $ 3,650 MILLION<br />
ROADS PROGRAM. UNDER BOTH PROGRAMS, FUNDS ALLOCATED IN<br />
1982/ 83 TOTAL $ 914 MILLION ( AN INCREASE OF $ 229 MILLION OR<br />
33% OVER 1981/ 82) AND $ 1,208 MILLION IN 1983/ 84 ( AN INCREASE<br />
OF $ 294 MILLION OR 32% OVER 1982/ 83).<br />
WITH REGARD TO LOCAL ROADS, $ 27 MILLION HAS BEEN ALLOCATED<br />
UNDER THE AUSTRALIAN BICENTENNIAL ROAD DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM<br />
DURING 1982/ 83 TO ASSIST LOCAL GOVERNMENT UPGRADE THEIR<br />
LOCAL ROAD SYSTEMS. WHEN COMBINED WITH THE FUNDS* ALREADY<br />
BEING PROVIDED UNDER THE FIVE YEAR PROGRAM, THIS WILL BRING<br />
THE TOTAL COMMONWEALTH CONTRIBUTION FOR LOCAL ROADS TO<br />
( ABOUT $ 200 MILLION, AN INCREASE OF SOME 24 PER CENT OVER THE<br />
1981/ 82 ALLOCATIONS.<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN BICENTENNIAL ROAD DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM MARKS<br />
AN IMPORTANT STEP FORWARD IN THE COMMONWEALTH'S EFFORTS TO<br />
UPGRADE THE AUSTRALIAN ROAD SYSTEM. THIS PROGRAM, AS WELL<br />
AS THE ASSISTANCE PROVIDED UNDER OUR FIVE YEAR ROADS PROGRAM,<br />
SHOULD ALLOW THE AUSTRALIAN ROAD SYSTEM TO BE DEVELOPED TO<br />
A HIGH STANDARD BY 1988 ENABLING SUBSTANTIAL ECONOMIC AND<br />
SOCIAL BENEFITS TO BE DERIVED BY ROAD USERS AND THE NATION<br />
AS A WHOLE.<br />
AERODROME LOCAL OWNERSHIP PLAN<br />
ALSO IN THE TRANSPORT FIELD, THE COMMONWEALTH BUDGET PROVIDED<br />
FOR A VERY SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN FUNDING FOR THE AERODROME<br />
LOCAL OWNERSHIP PLAN. IN 1982/ 83 $ 40 MILLION WILL BE SPENT </p>
<p>I<br />
12.<br />
ON WORKS AT SUCH WIDELY SPACED CENTRES AS TAMWORTH, CAIRNS,<br />
DEVONPORT, COFFS HARBOUR, BUNDABERG, PORT HEDLAND AND WYNYARD.<br />
THE AERODROME LOCAL OWNERSHIP PLAN IS LONG STANDING GOVERNMENT<br />
POLICY AND A CO-OPERATIVE ENDEAVOUR BETWEEN COMMONWEALTH AND<br />
LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO PROVIDE, OPERATE AND MAINTAIN AERODROMES<br />
SERVING LOCAL COMMUNITIES. THE AERODROME LOCAL OWNERSHIP PLAN<br />
IS ALSO CONSISTENT WITH GOVERNMENT PHILOSOPHY AS EXPRESSED IN THE<br />
RCF ANNOUNCEMENT THAT STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE CLOSER<br />
TO THE RECIPIENTS OF MANY SERVICES AND ARE BETTER PLACED TO<br />
ADMINISTER THEM.<br />
JTHROUGH THE PROVISIONS OF THE AERODROME LOCAL OWNERSHIP PLAN<br />
THE COMMONWEALTH UNDERTAKES TO UPGRADE AERODROME MOVEMENT<br />
AREAS-TO AN AGREED STANDARD TO MEET CURRENT AND FORESEEN<br />
AVIATION NEEDS, AT FULL COST TO ITSELF AT THE TIME OF TRANSFER.<br />
THE COMMONWEALTH ALSO AGREES TO PROVIDE FUNDS FOR FIFTY PER CENT<br />
OF AGREED AERODROME DEVELOPMENT AND MAINTENANCE COSTS, INCLUDING<br />
TERMINAL FACILITIES, ON A CONTINUING BASIS. THE LOCAL<br />
AUTHORITY ACCEPTING OWNERSHIP OF THE AERODROME RECEIVES THE<br />
FACILITY WITHOUT COST OR CHARGE BY THE COMMONWEALTH AND<br />
RETAINS ALL REVENUES RAISED FROM THE AERODROME AS OFFSET<br />
AGAINST ITS SHARE OF DEVELOPMENT AND MAINTENANCE COSTS.<br />
LOCAL GOVERNMENT ALSO WILL BENEFIT SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE<br />
$ 201 MILLION BEING MADE AVAILABLE BY THE COMMONWEALTH IN THE<br />
NEXT TWO YEARS FOR CAPITAL PROJECTS TO ASSIST THE AGED AND<br />
HANDICAPPED OF OUR COMMUNITY, ANNOUNCED BY THE MINISTER </p>
<p>13.<br />
FOR SOCIAL SECURITY, SENATOR THE HON. FRED CHANEY, ON<br />
11 AUGUST 1982.<br />
AGED OR DISABLED PERSONS' HOMES<br />
UNDER THE AGED OR DISABLED PERSONS HOMES ACT 1954 LOCAL<br />
GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES ALONG WITH RELIGIOUS, CHARITABLE<br />
AND CERTAIN OTHER ORGANISATIONS, ARE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE<br />
ASSISTANCE FOR THE CAPITAL AND OPERATING COSTS ASSOCIATED<br />
WITH THE PROVISION OF CERTAIN KINDS OF ACCOMMODATION FOR<br />
THE AGED.<br />
GRANTS ON A $ 2 FOR $ 1 BASIS UP TO CERTAIN MAXIMUM LIMITS MAY<br />
'-BE MADE TO MEET THE COST OF ERECTION, EXTENSION OR PURCHASE<br />
OF THE ACCOMMODATION. THE MAXIMUM SUBSIDIES ARE REVIEWED<br />
PERIODICALLY, AND FOR APPROVED PROJECTS COMMENCING AFTER<br />
1 JULY 1982 THE SUBSIDY LIMITS HAVE BEEN INCREASED FROM<br />
$ 12,100 TO $ 14,000 FOR A SINGLE UNIT AND FROM $ 14,035 TO<br />
$ 16,240 FOR A DOUBLE UNIT OF ACCOMMODATION, WHILE A MAXIMUM<br />
) OF $ 1,920 A UNIT IS PROVIDED FOR LAND.<br />
IN 1969 THE ACT WAS AME1NDED TO PROVIDE FOR THE PAYMENT OF<br />
PERSONAL CARE SUBSIDIES IN RESPECT OF PERSONS AGED EIGHTY<br />
YEARS AND OVER RESIDENT IN HOSTEL ACCOMMODATION AND<br />
RECEIVING PERSONAL CARE SERVICES PROVIDED BY AN APPROVED<br />
ORGANISATION. IN 1973 THE SUBSIDY WAS EXTENDED TO HOSTEL<br />
RESIDENTS AGED LESS THAN EIGHTY YEARS WHO REQUIRE, AND ARE<br />
RECEIVING, APPROVED PERSONAL CARE. THE SUBSIDY HAS BEEN </p>
<p>INCREASED FROM $ 20 TO $ 30 PER PERSON A WEEK FROM JULY 1982.<br />
PAYMENTS TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT UNDER THIS PROGRAM IN 1982/ 83 ARE<br />
ESTIMATED TO BE JUST OVER $ 8 MILLION, DOUBLE THE AMOUNT<br />
PROVIDED IN 1981 / 82.<br />
IN ADDITION, UNDER THE STATES GRANTS ( HOME CARE) ACT OF 1969<br />
THE COMMONWEALTH PREVIOUSLY AGREED TO PROVIDE $ 4 MILLION A<br />
YEAR FOR THREE YEARS FROM 1980/ 81 FOR CENTRES, RECOMMENDED<br />
BY STATE GOVERNMENTS, WHICH PROVIDE WELFARE SERVICES<br />
MAINLY FOR ELDERLY PEOPLE.<br />
THIS IS OF PARTICULAR INTEREST HERE IN ALICE SPRINGS, AS<br />
[-MY COLLEAGUE SENATOR KILGARIFF OPENED THE ALICE SPRINGS<br />
SENIOR CITIZENS CENTRE IN WELLS STREET JUST LAST WEEK. IT<br />
IS A VERY GOOD EXAMPLE OF WHAT CAN BE ACHIEVED THROUGH<br />
CO-OPERATION BETWEEN VARIOUS LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT AND<br />
DIFFERENT SECTIONS OF THE COMMUNITY. THE COMMONWEALTH<br />
GOVERNMENT AND THE ALICE SPRINGS TOWN COUNCIL HAVE<br />
CONTRIBUTED A TOTAL OF $ 90,000 TOWARDS THE COST OF THE<br />
RENOVATION OF PREMISES, PROVIDED BY THE TERRITORY<br />
GOVERNMENT FOR THE ALICE SPRINGS SENIOR CITIZENS'<br />
ASSOCIATION. CHILDREN'S SERVICES<br />
UNDER THE CHILDREN'S SERVICES PROGRAM GRANTS ARE MADE DIRECT<br />
TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES AND COMMUNITY ORGANISATIONS<br />
TOWARDS THE COST OF THE ESTABLISHMENT AND OPERATION OF A </p>
<p>RANGE OF CARE AND ASSOCIATED SERVICES FOR CHILDREN, INCLUDING<br />
EDUCATIONAL SERVICES FOR YOUNG CHILDREN.<br />
IN 1981-82 GRANTS PAID DIRECT TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES<br />
UNDER THE CHILDREN'S SERVICES PORGRAM TOTALLED $ 11 .5 MILLION,<br />
PAYMENTS IN 1982-83 ARE ESTIMATED TO BE $ 19.5 MILLION.<br />
DROUGHT RELIEF<br />
MUCH OF THE COUNTRY IS IN THE GRIP OF ONE OF THE WORST<br />
DROUGHTS ANY OF US CAN REMEMBER. WITH EXPECTATIONS OF THE<br />
WHEAT CROP BEING HALF THE LEVEL OF LAST YEAR'S AND GRAZIERS<br />
HAVING DIFFICULTY MAINTAINING HERD AND FLOCK SIZES COUPLED<br />
t-WITH UNFAVOU'RABLE MARKET CONDITIONS OVERSEAS THE<br />
IMPLICATIONS FOR THE ECONOMY AT NATIONAL, STATE AND REGIONAL<br />
LEVELS ARE OBVIOUS. A DISASTER OF THIS MAGNITUDE CREATES<br />
PARTICULAR PROBLEMS FOR GOVERNMENTS AT ALL LEVELS AND EACH<br />
HAS TO PLAY ITS PART IN RESPONDING TO THE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC<br />
CHALLENGE ISSUED BY AN ADVERSE ENVIRONMENT.<br />
THE GOVERNMENT HAS RESPONDED SWIFTLY AND POSITIVELY TO<br />
THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE CURRENT DROUGHT BY INTRODUCING<br />
TWO SUBSTANTIAL RELIEF MEASURES NOT PREVIOUSLY AVAILABLE,<br />
THE FODDER AND INTEREST PAYMENT SUBSIDIES. THESE MEASURES,<br />
ESTIMATED TO COST MORE THAN $ 350 MILLION, ARE BEING WHOLLY<br />
FUNDED BY THE COMMONWEALTH. THESE INITIATIVES DEMONSTRATE<br />
YET AGAIN THAT THE COMMONWEALTH IS PREPARED TO GO BEYOND<br />
THE CON4STRAINTS OF ESTABLISHED FUNDING ARRANGEMENTS IN<br />
RESPONSE TO NATURAL DISASTERS WHEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE </p>
<p>16<br />
SO SEVERE AS TO WARRANT SUCH ACTION.<br />
IN ADDITION, THE COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT HAS TAKEN THE<br />
LEAD IN ENCOURAGING THE STATES TO EXTEND THE RANGE OF RELIEF<br />
MEASURES ELIGIBLE FOR COMMONWEALTH ASSISTANCE UNDER THE<br />
ESTABLISHED NATURAL DISASTER RELIEF ARRANGEMENTS. THE<br />
SPECIFIC MEASURES VARY FROM STATE TO STATE AND CARRY-ON<br />
LOANS, FREIGHT SUBSIDIES FOR TRANSPORT OF STOCK, FODDER<br />
AND WATER, AND SLAUGHTER SUBSIDIES ARE DIRECTED AT PRIMARY<br />
PRODUCERS AND SMALL BUSINESSES. THERE ARE, HOWEVER, A NUMBER<br />
OF APPROVED NMEASURES IN DIFFERENT STATES WHICH PROVIDE<br />
iDIRECT ASSISTANCE TO SHIRES AND TOWN COUNCILS FOR EMERGENCY<br />
WATER SUPPLIES. WHERE A STATE IMPLEMENTS SUCH MEASURES, THE<br />
COMMONWEALTH FUNDS EXPENDITURE IN A FINANCIAL YEAR ABOVE THE<br />
STATE'S BASE AMOUNT ON A $ 3 COMM1ONWEALTH TO $ 1 SIATEI BASIS.<br />
A NUMBER OF APPROACHES HAVE BEEN MADE TO THE COMMONWEALTH<br />
BY SHIRES AND TOWN COUNCILS SEEKING FUNDS FOR SHORT-TERM<br />
JOB CREATION SCHEMES FOR THE DURATION OF THE DROUGHT.<br />
THE OVERALL AIM OF THE COMMONWEALTH'S APPROACH TO DROUGHT<br />
RELIEF, BOTH WITHIN THE NATURAL DISASTER RELIEF ARRANGEMENTS<br />
AND IN THE SPECIAL MEASURES INTRODUCED FOR THE DURATION OF<br />
THIS DROUGHT, IS TO HELP TO MAINTAIN THE VIABILITY OF<br />
DROUGHT-AFFECTED PRIMARY PRODUCERS AND SMALL BUSINESS SO<br />
THAT THEY CAN OPERATE AS NEAR TO NORMALLY AS POSSIBLE AND<br />
MEET NORMAL OPERATING EXPENSES SUCH AS RATES, EMPLOYEES'<br />
I </p>
<p>17<br />
WAGES ETC. THIS HAS FLOW-ON EFFECTS FOR OTHER SECTORS OF<br />
THE LOCAL EOCNOMY HELPING TO MAINTAIN ACTIVITY AND.<br />
EMPLOYMENT. THIS APPROACH HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN THE PAST<br />
AND IS MORE LIKELY TO MAINTAIN PERMANENT EMPLOYMENT IN<br />
RURAL AREAS THAN SHORT TERM JOB CREATION SCHEMES. IN THIS<br />
REGARD THE COMMONWEALTH IS DISAPPOINTED THAT ONE STATE,<br />
NEW SOUTH WALES, HAS NOT SEEN FIT TO IMPLEMENT THE COMMONWEALTH'S<br />
PROPOSAL THAT CARRY-ON LOANS BE EXTENDED TO SMALL BUSINESSES.<br />
D THIS PROPOSAL WAS FORMULATED HAVING IN MIND THE PARTICULAR<br />
PROBLEMS OF SMALL BUSINESSES IN DROUGHT-AFFECTED RURAL TOWNS,<br />
AND I UNDERSTAND THAT ALL OTHER STATES HAVE AGREED TO IT.<br />
ACIR I SHOULD NOW LIKE TO TURN TO A VERY IMPORTANT ASPECT OF THE<br />
DEVELOPMENT OF RELATIONS BETWEEN THE THREE SPHERIES OF<br />
GOVERNMENT IN AUSTRALIA. APART FROM INSTITUTING THE TAX<br />
SHARING ARRANGEMENTS WITH STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT THE<br />
COMMONWEALTH ACTED SHORTLY AFTER ITS ELECTION IN<br />
DECEMBER 1975 TO ESTABLISH A BODY, WITH REPRESENTATIVES<br />
FROM THE COMMONWEALTH, STATE AND LOCAL SPHEI--S AND FROM THE<br />
GENERAL COMMUNITY, WHICH COULD EXAMINE IN AN OBJECTIVE AND<br />
ANALYTICAL WAY, THE ROLES AND RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE<br />
THREE SPHERES OF GOVERNMENT. THE CREATION OF THE ADVISORY<br />
COUNCIL FOR INTER-GOVERNMENT RELATIONS REPRESENTS ONE OF<br />
THE MOST SIGNIFICANT INITIATIVES IN THIS AREA SINCE FEDERATION.<br />
BY MEANS OF ITS REPORTS, DISCUSSION PAPERS AND INFORMATION </p>
<p>18<br />
PAPERS AND THROUGH THE OPPORTUNITIES IT PROVIDES FOR<br />
POSITIVE INTERACTION BETWEEN GOVERNMENTS, IT HAS ALREADY<br />
HAD A CONSIDERABLE INFLUENCE ON THE WAY WE VIEW OUR OWN<br />
AND EACH OTHERS' RESPECTIVE ROLES IN THE GOVERNMENT OF THE<br />
NATION. THE COMMONWEALTH WAS PLEASED WITH THE AGREEMENT OF STATE<br />
GOVERNMENTS AND YOUR ASSOCIATION TO WELCOME OUR HOST<br />
TERRITORY AS A FULL MEMBER OF ACIR.-WE ALL LOOK FORWARD<br />
TO THE SPECIAL CONTRIBUTION WHICH THE TERRITORY'S<br />
REPRESENTATI* VES CAN MAKE, GIVEN THEIR SPECIAL VIEWPOINT<br />
rAS A GOVERNMENT IN TRANSITION TO STATEHOOD AND AS AN AREA<br />
WHERE LOCAL GOVERNMENT IS AT AN EARLY STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT.<br />
FINALLY, IT IS CLEAR THAT, DESPITE THE DIFFICULT<br />
CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH WE ALL FACE, THE COMMONWEALTH HAS MADE<br />
AND IS CONTINUING TO MAKE A SIGNIFICANT COMMITMENT TO SUPPORT<br />
LOCAL GOVERNMENT AS A SEPARATE BUT INTEGRAL PART OF THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION. I<br />
THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THIS IMPORTANT<br />
CONFERENCE WHICH HAS A NUMBER OF WEIGHTY MATTERS TO CONSIDER<br />
IN THE THREE DAYS OF ITS DURATION.<br />
