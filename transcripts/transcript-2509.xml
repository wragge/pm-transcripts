T1HE FOLLOWING STATEMENT WAS GIVEN riO THE PRESS ON 6/ 1/ 1972 IN THE<br />
NAME OF " A SPOKESMAN FOR THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
ACCESS TO COMMONWEALTH-ARCHIVES<br />
The recent release by the British Government, under its<br />
' archives policy, of official records including Cabinet papers from<br />
the Second World War, has given rise to questions about access to<br />
Australian Government records, a spokesman for the Prime Minister<br />
said today. The archives policy of the Commonwealth Government was<br />
reviewed in December 1970. A statemcnt announcing the new policy<br />
a was then made. In accordance with this policy, the general run of<br />
records is, with certain specific exceptions, subject to a " this ty<br />
year access" rule.<br />
0 Cabinet papers because of their special nature were<br />
differentiated. Under the decisions taken in December 1970, the<br />
fifty year rule was retained for access to these papers and release<br />
was also to require the Prime Minister's approval and consultation<br />
with the Leader of the Opposition where such papers originated under<br />
a Labor Government. The Prime Minister stated today that further consideration<br />
would be given to the policy of access to Government decuments.<br />
