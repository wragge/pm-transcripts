<p>The 2013 White Paper outlines the capabilities that the Australian Defence Force will need in the coming years to address strategic challenges.</p>
<p>Maintaining a capable ADF, including through appropriate force posture and preparedness settings, is central to Australia's continued effectiveness in contributing to sustainable security in our region.</p>
<p>The Government is committed to ensuring that the Australian Defence Force has the capability and culture it needs to effectively serve Australia's national security interests. </p>
<p>It will ensure that we have one of the most capable military forces in the region to protect Australia's strategic interests and support regional security and toundertake the four priority tasks required of it by Government:</p>
<p> * 	Principal Task One: deter and defeat armed attacks on Australia;<br />
 * 	Principal Task Two: contribute to stability and security in the South Pacific and Timor-Leste;<br />
 * 	Principal Task Three: contribute to military contingencies in the Indo-Pacific region, with priority given to Southeast Asia; and<br />
 * 	Principal Task Four: contribute to military contingencies in support of global security.</p>
<p>To provide the future force to meet these tasks, the Government remains committed to delivering the core capabilities identified in the 2009 Defence White Paper.</p>
<p>Since 2009, the Government has approved more than 125 proposals for new or enhanced defence capabilities with a total value of over $17.3 billion. Over this period, Defence has taken delivery of a number of major systems, including C-17 heavy lift aircraft, F/A-18F Super Hornet combat aircraft, Bushmaster protected mobility vehicles and two large amphibious/sea lift vessels. By the end of this decade, the ADF will also take delivery of three Air Warfare Destroyers, two Landing Helicopter Dock amphibious ships and the initial two F-35A Joint Strike Fighter aircraft.</p>
<p>Since 2009, the Government has also taken decisions to acquire or progress priority acquisitions including ten C-27J Battlefield Airlift aircraft, the EA-18G Growler electronic attack capability, Australia's new air combat capability, the replacement land vehicle fleet and future submarine capability.</p>
<p>Building on these acquisitions, the 2012 Force Structure Review assessed capability priorities against the backdrop of Australia's contemporary strategic environment.</p>
<p>The Review confirmed the need to deliver priority ADF capabilities for Navy, Army and Air Force within available resources in the near term, while continuing to progress enabling capabilities essential to the ADF being a capable, integrated joint force.</p>
<p>In addition, significant new capability commitments outlined in the 2013 Defence White Paper will assure Australia's air combat capability as we transition to the Joint Strike Fighter, and enhance our maritime security capabilities while contributing to the long-term sustainment of Australia's critical naval shipbuilding industry. </p>
<p>Examples of major planned acquisitions are outlined below.</p>
<p>Navy Capabilities</p>
<p>The Government remains committed to replacing the existing Collins Class fleet with an expanded fleet of 12 conventional submarines that will meet Australia's future strategic requirements. The future submarines will be assembled in South Australia.</p>
<p>The Government has taken the important decision to suspend further investigation of Future Submarine options based on military-off-the-shelf designs in favour of focusing resources on progressing an â€˜evolved Collins' and new design options that are likely to best meet Australia's future strategic and capability requirements.</p>
<p>The Government intends to replace the capability currently provided by the supply ships HMAS Success and HMAS Sirius at the first possible opportunity. This will include examination of options for local, hybrid and overseas build or the leasing of an existing vessel. The Spanish Navy vessel Cantabria is assisting Australia's afloat support requirements while HMAS Success is in refit. This operational experience, along with other information and activity, will contribute to Defence's understanding of relevant capabilities as options are developed.</p>
<p>The Government will also bring forward the replacement of Australia's Armidale Class Patrol Boats, with both Australia's patrol boats and the Pacific Patrol Boats being replaced preferably by proven designs.  A multirole vessel remains a possible longer-term project, subject to technological maturity and an ability to provide operational flexibility with lower costs of ownership.</p>
<p>Army Capabilities</p>
<p>The Government is committed to a range of capability improvements to ensure that land forces remain both highly credible and sustainable for their roles in support of the Principal Tasks.</p>
<p>In response to the increasing complexity and lethality of land operations, the Government is committed to acquiring deployable protected and armoured vehicles offering improved firepower, protection and mobility compared to existing systems. This will include new medium and heavy trucks to replace Army's existing ageing fleet.</p>
<p>Air Force Capabilities</p>
<p>In 2012, the Government announced its commitment to acquiring the EA-18G Growler electronic attack aircraft capability based on converting 12 of Australia's current F/A-18F Super Hornet aircraft to Growlers.</p>
<p>The 2013 White Paper outlines the Government's decision to acquire 12 new-build EA-18G Growler aircraft.  This decision will retain all 24 Super Hornets in their current air combat and strike capability configuration.  This decision will assure Australia's air combat capability through the transition period to the Joint Strike Fighter.</p>
<p>The Government remains committed to acquiring the fifth-generation F-35A Joint Strike Fighter aircraft for Australia.  Australia's existing Super Hornet aircraft, together with the future Growler and Joint Strike Fighter capabilities will provide a world class air combat force capable of controlling the air and electronic environments and conducting effective land and maritime strike. </p>
<p>Joint Capabilities</p>
<p>The White Paper also outlines key areas for investment in capabilities which support the whole ADF and Defence more generally. These include an enhanced amphibious capability based on the introduction of Australia's two new Canberra Class Landing Helicopter Dock ships in the middle of this decade, and cyber,intelligence, communications, Space Situational Awareness, Command and Control and simulation capabilities.</p>
<p>Defence will also analyse the value of further investment in unmanned aircraft for focused area, overland intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, including for use in border security operations. This will include the potential expansion of the role of these assets in the ADF to include interdiction and close air support, subject to policy development and Government consideration.  Domestic and international policy and legal considerations will be important elements of any Australian consideration of armed unmanned aircraft in the future. </p>
<p>The Government's planned capability enhancements are costed and affordable, while building a solid foundation for future enhancements, if needed, as strategic and fiscal circumstances evolve. </p>
<p>Additional details on the Government's plans for developing the future ADF will be provided in an updated four year Defence Capability Plan and six year Defence Capability Guide which will be released in coming months.</p>
