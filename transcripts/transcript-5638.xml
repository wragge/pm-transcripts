DELIVERY ( 8.3OPM)<br />
PRIME -MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA MONDAY, AUGUST 17 1981<br />
QUADRANT'S 25TH ANNIVERSARY DINNER<br />
I am very happy to be here tonight to celebrate with you the<br />
anniversary of Quadrant. Little magazines traditionally<br />
suffer from a high rate of infant mortality and few of them<br />
attain their majority. That Quadrant has done so, that indeed<br />
it seems set to go on to a vigorous and robust middle age, is<br />
very much a matter for congratulation.<br />
The extent of Quadrant's success in pursuing its goals and<br />
the status it has achieved in the Australian community and<br />
overseas are reflected in the composition of this gathering<br />
tonight. May I say that I am particularly pleased to see so<br />
many leaders of the business community here to pay tribute to<br />
an intellectual journal. It reflects a very healthy state of<br />
affairs. As I have sought to emphasise on a number of occasions over<br />
recent months, it is of the utmost importance that businessmen<br />
should realise the-relevance of ideas, of theory, to their<br />
activities and interests. If the market economy is to survive<br />
and thrive it must rest on the support of people, on a clear<br />
and widespread understanding in the community of its great<br />
merits and also on an awareness of what threatens it. And, in<br />
turn, if the market economy is to enjoy that support, the<br />
intellectual case for it and against its enemies must be<br />
made, clearly, forcefully and repeatedly. Ensuring that this case<br />
is made, and supporting those who can make it ef fectively,<br />
is not an ' optional extra' for business, not a matter of<br />
engaging in a bit of high-minded patronage. It is essential.<br />
I am glad that this is being understood by an increasing<br />
number of leaders in the business community.<br />
From its inception, Quadrant has sought to promote and<br />
exemplify excellence in literature and the other arts, and<br />
I am told by people better able to judge than myself that<br />
it has succeeded admirably in this respect. But it has been<br />
concerned to do more than that: it has sought to explore<br />
explain and defend the conditions necessary for culture and<br />
intellectual activity generally to flourish freely. It has<br />
understood and has insisted on emphasising the essential<br />
nexus between cultural freedom, a liberal democratic policy,<br />
the free market and effective defence against external tyranny. ./ 2 </p>
<p>2<br />
As far as this aspect of Quadrant's activity is concerned,<br />
I do not need to depend on anyone else's judgment to arrive<br />
at a conclusion. I am sure that in stressing the interdependence<br />
of these components of a free and open society Quadrant is<br />
absolutely right. Cultural freedom is one of the highest<br />
human aspirations and an indispensable condition for a<br />
civilised society. At the same time it presents a great and<br />
permanent challenge to mankind. In some sense it is always<br />
under threat, always in danger.<br />
The most obvious threat to it comes from the totalitarian<br />
mentality, and wherever totalitarians have come to power<br />
they have given the highest priority to trying to crush it.<br />
In terms of their own perverted standards they have been<br />
right to do so, for it represents a fundamental challenge<br />
to their attempt to exert total control over the whole of<br />
society. The successful resistance to their efforts represents<br />
the most noble and heroic story of our epoch.<br />
In democratic societies cultural freedom substantially<br />
exists, but its existence should never be taken for granted,<br />
should never be a matter for complacency. There are always<br />
forces which in the name of received truth, morality, order,<br />
tradition or simply a quiet, comfortable life would seek to<br />
circumscribe it.<br />
The strength of Liberal pluralism is that it distributes<br />
and limits power in ways which prevent any of these forces<br />
from prevailing and which allow a substantial and continuing<br />
competition between ideas. Theconcept of a free market is as valid<br />
in this sphere as it is in the economic one. The authority<br />
and power of the state are not available to any particular<br />
group; instead they are used to hold the ring, to ensure that<br />
all groups and viewpoints are allowed to compete freely, to<br />
promote opportunities for unfettered creative activity.<br />
Beyond this danger lies, and those who argue for a positive,<br />
large-scale commitment and involvement in culture on the part<br />
of the state are displaying a fundamental ignorance not only<br />
of liberalism but of culture itself. James McAuley, the founding<br />
editor of Quadrant, once satirised such a view:<br />
" By the waters of Babylon<br />
I heard a public works official say:<br />
" A culture that is truly Babylonian<br />
has been ordered for delivery today"."<br />
It is a familiar error: if something is good and desirable<br />
the state should provide it. To which the Liberal reply is:<br />
if something is good and desirable, people should be left<br />
free to pursue it with the minimum of restraint. / 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
Political arrangements can remove impediments and threats.<br />
But beyond that cultural freedom depends essentially on a<br />
positive commitment to a way of life on the part of individuals.<br />
It is a way of life which is characterised by a commitment<br />
to truth over convenience; to liberty over comfort and<br />
security; to creativity and production over consumption;<br />
to the autonomy of cultural activity over supposedly overriding<br />
social and political needs. Thatis the way of life which<br />
Quadrant has stood for and promoted. The survival of Quadrant<br />
over 25 years has not been due to a lucky accident. It has been<br />
due to the dedication and conviction of a group of people.<br />
I note that the seminar you have just held in Canberra had the<br />
title, " How the tide has turned". Well, for most of Quadrant's<br />
life the tide had not turned. Whatever was true of the community<br />
at large, in many -tellectual, academic and cultural circles<br />
it was common during much of this time for liberalism to be<br />
described as exhausted'; for any concern with defence to<br />
be equated with ' militarism' or ' paranoia'; for any concern<br />
with subversion to be condemned as ' McCarthyism'; for any<br />
solidarity with allies to be described as ' subservience'.<br />
At the same time, faced with any domestic social or economic<br />
problem, the reflex action of many intellectuals was to demand<br />
action by the state to remedy it and to advocate the giving<br />
of more power to the state for that purpose.<br />
The 25 years of Quadrant's existence have been years of<br />
intense ideological conflict, a fact of which I am well aware<br />
as those years coincide almost exactly with my own political<br />
life. The magazine came into existence at the height or<br />
was it the depth? of the Cold War in the mid 1950s. It was<br />
the Australian manifestation-of an effort throughout the<br />
Western world to rally those intellectuals who believed in<br />
the values of liberal democracy to the defence of those values.<br />
There was an urgent need for such a defence. At that time,<br />
astounding as it may now seem, there were still many in the<br />
West who suffered from the illusion that the Soviet Union<br />
was a force for progress and hope. There were many more<br />
who were undermined by doubt and confusion, to such an extent<br />
that not only were they unable to defend their own societies<br />
but often felt constrained to attack those who did. It is to<br />
the great credit of those, like the Quadrant group, that they<br />
refused to be intimidated in this atmosphere.<br />
In the 1960s and early 1970s, the position represented<br />
by Quadrant faced a different kind of challenge the<br />
challenge of a trendy, ' progressivism' manifesting itself<br />
in a cult of protest and an indulgent concern with ' selfrealisation'.<br />
Paradoxically, the unprecendented prosperity<br />
produced by the private enterprise economies of the West after<br />
the Second World War led to a denunciation of those societies<br />
as materialistic and selfish, the denunications coming mainly<br />
from those elements in society who had enjoyed most of the<br />
benefits. In the face of this assault, many who should have<br />
known better lost their nerve and betrayed their values.<br />
In the eyes of the ' racically chic', what was fashionable<br />
prevailed over what was true. If all this took us by surprise,<br />
it should not have done. / 4 </p>
<p>-4<br />
In an astounding perceptive and prophetic book written in the<br />
late 1920s, the Spanish writer,. Ortega y Gasset had foreseen<br />
the essence of it all. He had predicted the coming of what<br />
Tom Wolfe labelled the " me generation" by identifying the<br />
" psychology of the spoilt child" as a fundamental trait of<br />
mass society the pyschology, that is, that leads men to<br />
believe themselves exempt'from all restrictions and<br />
responsibilities and claim an overriding priority for<br />
" the free expansion of their vital desires"<br />
As far as the irrationality of the cult of protest in<br />
the 1960s is concerned, perhaps he said all that needs<br />
to be said in one sentence when he observed:<br />
" In the disturbances caused by the scarcity<br />
of food, the mob goes in search of bread, and<br />
the means it employs is generally to wreck the bakeries."<br />
The book I refer to is, of course, The Revolt of the Masses,<br />
andI commend it to you.<br />
As far as international affairs of this period were concerned,.<br />
things were different in some respects, in that the trauma<br />
of the Vietnam War led to a legitimate and genuine difference<br />
of opinion about a real issue. But here, too there was<br />
intellectual corruption in the form of an attempt to<br />
revise history in such a way as to hold the West responsible<br />
for the origins of the Cold War and illusion in the form<br />
of a naive belief in ' detente' as the solution for the conflict<br />
between free and totalitarian systems.<br />
During most of this period therefore the editors and<br />
contributors of Quadrant have been swimming against the<br />
tide in upholding traditional liberal values and institutions,<br />
insisting that the West must be prepared to defend itself<br />
and in exposing the intellectual emptiness and danger of many<br />
prevailing trends.<br />
In doing so, I am sure that they have paid a price in<br />
terms of acceptability and reputation. We should all be<br />
grateful that they and some others not too many have<br />
been prepared to do so. For if the tide has indeed now<br />
turned, and I agree that there are good grounds for<br />
believing that it has, it is not simply because of the<br />
ineluctable working of some impersonal historical ' forces'<br />
It has required the commitment of individuals. There is no<br />
substitute for such commitment.<br />
And if it is true that things are in many ways signficantly<br />
healthier now, as I believe they are, this is because people<br />
now have a clearer idea of what is at issue, because we have<br />
put illusions aside. The first task in overcoming these difficulties<br />
and problems, is to perceive the threat clearly. Much of the<br />
problem of the last 25 years has been that many people failed<br />
to discern the nature of an issue which is essentially simple.<br />
And if more people are now seeing the truth as it is and the<br />
facts as they are, we owe it, to a considerable extent, to the<br />
influence of Quadrant. </p>
<p>5<br />
But ladies and gentlemen, if in terms of the attitudes and<br />
beliefs current in Western societies things are healthier<br />
now than they have been for years, the challenges facing<br />
our societies are still very formidable. The Soviet Union's<br />
military power is greater than it has ever been and given<br />
the combination of problems and opportunities which face<br />
it, it may be tempted to exploit that power if it is not<br />
confronted by a resolute West.<br />
The need to create a co-operative, constructive relationship<br />
between the rich and poor states of the world remains and<br />
is urgent. Without it there will be increasing discord and<br />
instability. Internally, countries of the West face serious<br />
economic and social challenges.<br />
This combination of problems is certain to provide a severe<br />
test of nerve in the coming years and we can be sure that,<br />
rather than face that test, many will look for explanations<br />
and solutions based on illusion and appeasement. The job of<br />
countering that tendency, of holding and building on the<br />
grouhd that has been won, remains and will in fact always<br />
remain. There are so many battles that must be fought and re-fought<br />
so that while we may win today, we know that we shall have<br />
to fight again tomorrow. If we were ever to think that we<br />
had won the fight for political, economic and cultural<br />
freedom, so that the struggle could be put aside, then we<br />
would lose our freedom.<br />
Quadrant has always understood that truth. With that in mind,<br />
I ask you to join me in a toast: To Quadrant the next 25 yeatrs. </p>
