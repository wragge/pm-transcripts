<p>I  am pleased to announce that the President of Israel, His Excellency Mr Chaim Herzog, has accepted an invitation to visit Australia in November as a guest of the Government.  </p>
<p>From its foundation Israel has shared with Australia an abiding commxitment to democratic principles and a parliamentary system of Government.</p>
<p>The Jewish community in Australia has made a deep and wide-ranving contribution to the development of our national culture and traditions. </p>
<p>President Herzog's visit will enhance further the warm relationship between our two countries.</p>
<p>Further details will be announced at a time closer to the date of  the visit.</p>
