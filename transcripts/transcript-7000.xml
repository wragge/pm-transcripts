<p>I Â am pleased to announce that the President of Israel, HisÂ Excellency Mr Chaim Herzog, has accepted an invitation to visitÂ Australia in November as a guest of the Government. Â </p>
<p>From its foundation Israel has shared with Australia an abidingÂ commxitment to democratic principles and a parliamentary system ofÂ Government.</p>
<p>The Jewish community in Australia has made a deep andÂ wide-ranving contribution to the development of our nationalÂ culture and traditions.Â </p>
<p>President Herzog's visit will enhance further the warmÂ relationship between our two countries.</p>
<p>Further detailsÂ will be announced at a time closer to the date ofÂ Â the visit.</p>
