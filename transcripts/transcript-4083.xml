ELECTORAL TALK<br />
Just on 100 days ago the Australian people elected the<br />
Liberal-National Country Party coalition to lead the nation<br />
for the next three years.<br />
They rmade-no bones about what they wanted.<br />
First, they asked us to rescue the nation from a level of<br />
inflation and unemployment that was attacking the social<br />
fabric of every section of society. A~ climate of uncertainty,<br />
doubt, and fear put strong pressure on family relationships.<br />
It hit business, large and small. -Farmers crie-d out in vain for<br />
help a independent IAC reports on the ru: ral indus-try were<br />
cons isten~ tly ignored.<br />
Australians also asked us to restore decency and integrity<br />
back into Government. They wanted politician--that were<br />
accountable first-to the Parliament,<br />
As Leader of the new Government, I told Austra'ians that<br />
our first commitment was to beat and then shackle inflation.<br />
I said it would be a full three year job.<br />
We could not simply wave a magic wand. Unlike Labour we could<br />
not just close our eyes and hope the problem would vanish.<br />
We could not constantly look for scapegoats, yet still do nothing.<br />

We had to start being responsible and accountable to the<br />
Australian electorate for our actions. We had to look at our<br />
own expenditure, and balance it against receipts. In other<br />
words, we had to start making decisions that would hurt for<br />
a while; we had to start saying<br />
Today Australians are acutely aware of Labour's legacy -the<br />
highe'st unemployment since the Depression, a $ 7,000 million<br />
deficit over two years, business confidence shot to ribbons<br />
and the real worth of pensions ana welfare prograrimes<br />
destroyed by inflation.<br />
Australians know of our task to help rebuild the private<br />
business sector and the rural community. They know we have<br />
to slow down the massive growth in the Federal Governnent sector.<br />
Australians now know that everything has a price, including<br />
Government programmes. Everyone pays. Under Labour the<br />
programmes got out of hand, they v'ere often badly administered<br />
and a5 a result they ran inpfficiently and at great cost.<br />
During my Government's first 100 days in office, we have<br />
returned to responsibility in economic management.<br />
Our economies in the public scrvi: e, the Bland inquiry, our<br />
monetary measures, have knitted together to start Australia back<br />
on the road to economic recovery.<br />
The Government's programmes are now~ well administered in the<br />
Parliament. Many people do not seem to understand that a<br />
vitally important part of Government is the dull and<br />
often difficult slog of spending hours behind a desk as a manager.<br />
I said earlier that Australians also wanted us to restore integrity<br />
to the national Parliament, and to Government. </p>
<p>In the first 100 days in office the Guvernment has launched<br />
its policy to restore authority and responsibility back to<br />
the States and local government.<br />
Under the policy the States will once again be responsible<br />
for the money they spend.<br />
We are already examining how we will introduce a system of<br />
personal income taxation, which will at last protect peoples'<br />
earnings against inflation.<br />
This will stop government rais. ng its tax revenue without telling<br />
the people what it is doing.<br />
It will make Government honest again. If they want to raise taxation<br />
they will have to say so.<br />
Politicians in Australia have mad(-too many promises. Australia<br />
cannot afford them all. Politicians have sought to buy votes<br />
by promising more than the nation's resources permit governments<br />
to provide.<br />
In other words, the Government's aim is to give people greater<br />
control over their own earnings. People will be able spend<br />
that money more wisely for themselves than it has been spent<br />
in the past by big government.<br />
Our programmes will bring inflation under control, and secure<br />
jobs for all who want to work. Australia will once again<br />
start to produce more and the resultant real wealth will enable<br />
us to provide the services the schools, aid to the disadvantaged,<br />
protection for the environment that the nation requires and<br />
that people today expect. </p>
