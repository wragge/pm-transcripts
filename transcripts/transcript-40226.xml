    <content><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and the Minister for Social Services, Christian Porter, today held discussions with the Islamic Council of Victoria (ICV) and a delegation of young Muslim leaders.</p>
<p>As the peak body for Muslim organisations in Victoria, the ICV represents more than 150,000 Muslims through its 47-member organisations located throughout the State.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister and the ICV spoke about fostering resilient communities, increasing the participation of Muslims in all aspects of Australian life, challenging extremist propaganda from those who prey on vulnerable youths and ensuring that Australians of all backgrounds can work together to uplift this nation.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister spoke about the contribution of Australian Muslims to our vibrant and successful multicultural society. He and Minister Porter heard from a representative group of accomplished young Muslim leaders who are at the forefront of civic participation and who are embracing opportunities to shape a more rewarding future for all Australians. The Prime Minister encouraged them to play an active role in strengthening Australia’s diverse and tolerant social fabric.</p>
<p>The discussions at ICV followed a visit to the Islamic Museum of Australia (IMA), where the Prime Minister and Minister Porter observed a series of informative exhibits that illustrate the long and rich history of Islamic civilisation and the contribution Muslims have made to Australia.</p>
<p>The museum exhibits demonstrate that, throughout our history, Muslims have been at the forefront of innovation, exploration and education and are a vital and integral part of the rich mosaic of Australian society.</p>
<p>In March 2015, the Government pledged $500,000 to assist the IMA with its important role and create a national online education programme.</p>
<p>The President of the Islamic Council of Victoria, Bayram Aktepe, said:</p>
<p>“The Muslim communities of Victoria welcome today’s unprecedented visit by an Australian Prime Minister. Our leaders, and our young leaders of the future, welcome Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull’s fresh tone and positive message regarding the threat of terrorism and challenges of extremism. I have no doubt that his commitment to mutual respect and unity will reduce levels of disengagement from family, community and wider society. We look forward to working closely with the Turnbull Government to further enhance our social cohesion and advance this great nation of ours.”</p>
<p>The Prime Minister commended the ICV and the Board of the Islamic Museum of Australia for their tireless work promoting community harmony, mutual respect and understanding.</p>
