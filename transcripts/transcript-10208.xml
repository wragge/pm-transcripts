New Year's Message<br />
to be released on New Year's Eve ( embargoed 6am 1/ 1/ 97)<br />
New Year's Day is one of our national days which provides a good<br />
opportunity to remember how lucky we all are to be Australians.<br />
I have long believed that those things which we all have in common as<br />
Australians and binds our nation together are far more important and<br />
enduring than our differences, those things which push us apart. Our<br />
national traditions of tolerance, freedom, openness, democracy and a fair<br />
go, with a hint of scepticism mixed in for good measure, bind us all<br />
together. We were well served by our common values and traditions when<br />
Australia started off on the road of independent nationhood. Those same<br />
enduring values will continue to strengthen and develop our country as we<br />
move beyond the dawn of the next century.<br />
Australians can stand proudly for our nation and our achievements, ranging<br />
from the cultural to those on the sporting field. As President Clinton<br />
remarked when he and Mrs Clinton visited us not so long ago, Australia's<br />
achievements are far out of proportion to our population. Not that we<br />
won't continue to grow and improve we have only started to discover our<br />
2-<br />
potential. But the enduring values and traditions which make up our<br />
national psyche will help guide a future which can seem hazy and<br />
uncertain. We are all tremendously fortunate to live in a naturally beautiful land<br />
whose natural wonders and cities and regional towns offer an enormous<br />
range of lifestyles and leisure options. We can be proud that our way is to<br />
ensure that all Australians, irrespective of their race, colour, beliefs or </p>
<p>country of origin, are accorded respect and dignity as individuals and are<br />
given an equal entitlement to achieve their aspirations, free from<br />
intimidation. There are regrettably few countries which can boast<br />
Australia's great record of upholding freedom of speech, religion and<br />
association. There will always be room for us to improve ourselves and our nation<br />
indigenous Australians come particularly to mind. But all Australians can<br />
be safe in the knowledge that we move towards the new millennium our<br />
rich traditions and common values which will continue to bind us together<br />
and keep Australia great. </p>
