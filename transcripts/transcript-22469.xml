    <content><![CDATA[<p>  The death of the King of Tonga, HM King Taufa'ahau Tupou IV, is a great loss for the Kingdom of Tonga.</p>
<p> King Taufa'ahau ruled Tonga for 41 years and held political authority and influence in Tonga's government.  Before assuming the role of King in 1965, His Majesty made a valuable contribution to Tonga by serving as the Minister for Education, the Minister for Health and as Premier.</p>
<p>  Australia has very good relations with Tonga, underpinned by generous development and defence cooperation programmes.</p>
<p>  On behalf of the Australian Government and people, I extend my heartfelt sympathy to King Taufa'ahau's family and to the Government and people of Tonga.</p>
<p>  Australia will be represented at the State Funeral for King Taufa'ahau by the Governor-General, His Excellency Major General Michael Jeffery AC CVO MC.</p>
