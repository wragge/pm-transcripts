PRIME MINISTER PRESS STATEMENT NO. 308<br />
23 August 1974<br />
GRANTS TO SOUTH WESTERN SYDNEY COUNCILS<br />
Four Councils in the south western region of Sydney<br />
will receive special grants totalling $ 837,000 under a historic<br />
Australian Government scheme.<br />
They will benefit from the Government's decision to<br />
approve the first grants ever to be made to reduce inequalities<br />
between local government areas throughout Australia. For the<br />
first time since its creation in 1933, the Grants Commission<br />
has recommended grants for local government areas.<br />
The Government, which last year empowered the<br />
Commission to recommend aid for local government areas in<br />
addition to claimant States, has approved the body's proposals.<br />
The Commission, an independent and non-political<br />
body, recommended that $ 837,000 be allocated to the Sydney<br />
south western region in 1974/ 75.<br />
The four Councils in the region to benefit from the<br />
grants are:<br />
Camden municipal Council $ 79,000<br />
Campbelltown City Council $ 235,000<br />
Liverpool City Council $ 445,000<br />
Wollondilly Shire Council $ 78,000<br />
The grants will be paid to the Councils through the<br />
New South Wales Government. The Australian Government has<br />
accepted the Grants Commission recommendation that no conditions<br />
be attached to the way in which the councils spend their allocations<br />
in 1974/ 75. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
The grants to the Sydney south western region are<br />
part of a total of $ 56,345,000 to be made available to local<br />
government organisations throughout Australia in 1974/ 75.<br />
Councils in New South Wales will receive $ 21,359,000<br />
of this amount. This is the first time that New South Wales has<br />
received any funds as a result of Grants Commission recommendations.<br />
The Commission was established in 1933 to provide<br />
recommendations for special grants to be paid to claimant States<br />
under Section 96 of the Constitution.<br />
At various times in the past 41 years these States<br />
have included Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia<br />
and Tasmania. The basis of making such grants has been the<br />
recognition that at various times some States have been less<br />
advantaged than others, both in terms of finance and services.<br />
Because of its strong overall financial position<br />
compared to other States, New South Wales has never qualified<br />
for Grants Commission allocations.<br />
It will now benefit as a result of the Grants<br />
Commission Act which was introduced by the Australian Government<br />
last year. This empowered the Commission to examine not just<br />
inequalities between States but also inequalities that exist<br />
between regions in the one State.<br />
This recognises that while a single State may be in<br />
a strong financial position overall, some areas within it may lack<br />
adequate services and facilities.<br />
Local Councils in such areas may not have the financial<br />
resources to overcome those deficiencies and even the relevant<br />
State Government may not be able to provide adequate assistance.<br />
It has become quite obvious that if the disabilities<br />
of some areas of Australia are to be overcome the national<br />
Government must provide special grants.<br />
That is the principle which has guided the Grants<br />
Commission and the Government in their deliberations.<br />
National Government assistance for Councils is long<br />
overdue in Australia. Neither the Australian nor State Governments<br />
in the past have been prepared to provide adequate assistance<br />
to enable local government to provide the many essential services<br />
which the community now demands of it. </p>
