ADDRESS BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON PJ. KEATING MI', TO<br />
THlE INTERNATIONAL INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS ASSOCIATION<br />
NINTH WORLD CONGRESS, SYDNEY, 31 AUGUST 1992<br />
A NEW CHARTER FOR INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS IN AUSTRALIA<br />
It's appropriate indeed that Australia is ablc to host this ninth congress of industrial<br />
relations experts, because we have quite an intcresting story to tell you about where<br />
we have come from in our industrial relations, where we are now, and where wc are<br />
going.. As you know, the way a country runs its industrial relations, the way the interests of<br />
employees and employers are reconciled, the way in which a country handles<br />
change in the workplace, tell you a great deal about that country.<br />
The industrial relalionship is the key one in the working lives of most people. t can<br />
be a great strength or a great weakness.<br />
For well over a century Australia has attracted the interest and curiosity of<br />
practitioners and theorists of industrial relations. In the great constitutional debates<br />
of the 1890' s our founding fathers gave the proposed Commonwvealth a power to<br />
settle interstate industrial disputes by conciliation and arbitration. When we<br />
became a nation in 1901 one of the first things we did was to set up a<br />
Commonwealth tribunal which could exercise this powver to settle disputes a<br />
power which rapidly became one of setting wa~ ges and conditions directly or by<br />
example for most Australian employees.<br />
It was a system which served Australia quite well I think, but the news I have to<br />
deliver today to those of our visitors who still think Australian industrial relations is<br />
run this way, is that it is finished. Not only is the old system finished, but we are<br />
rapidly phasing out its replacement, and have now begun to do things in a new way. </p>
<p>EL: 31. Aug. 92 10: 42 No. 001 P. 02/ 1l'<br />
2<br />
When we arrived in office in 1983 the old system was clearly on its last legs.<br />
Inflation was running at 11.5 pcr cent. We were exhausted by industrial warfare.<br />
The profit sharc had been squeezed down. Manufacturing was being obliterated.<br />
Unemployment was still rising, and of course thc economy was in thc trough of a<br />
recession. All this was happening behind high tariff barriers and a fixed exchange rate, with a<br />
current account deficit in the early eighties nearly twice the size as a proportion of<br />
GDP it is today, and the starting point deficit we inhcrited for our first budget<br />
heading towards 5 per cent of GDP.<br />
So it was a rough time.<br />
The Arbitration Commission was doing its best but it had just about run out of<br />
possibilities. Every principle had got a run at one time or another basic wage,<br />
total wage, relativitics, work valuc, absorption, non absorptions, flow ons, no flow<br />
ons, indexation, no indexation, minimums and maximums, industry decisions and<br />
national decisions.<br />
Every principle, except the simplc and straightforward principle of working<br />
together to find outcomes which left us all better off.<br />
Every procedure, except the procedure of finding a national consensus, arrived at<br />
with the full participation, the full authority and prestige of the national government<br />
as well as the industrial parties.<br />
The only thing we had going for us was that the trade unions and employers had<br />
reluctantly come to see that it couldn't go on the way it had.<br />
We also had a very enlightened central leadership in the union movement, and a<br />
Prime Minister whose entire suite of talents developed during a long and eventful<br />
career were ideally fittcd to the task of conducting a national summit to reconcile<br />
the waring industrial parties.<br />
So we entered an Accord with the national federation of trade unions, which in this<br />
country is called the ACTU.<br />
In one way or another the Accord has been essential to the favourable outcomes we<br />
were able to make over then'ext dfecade.<br />
TEL </p>
<p>TEL: 3<br />
Over the eighties the Accord agreements were frequently changed and renegotiated,<br />
because the world changed rapidly around us, and there was good will on both sides<br />
that allowed us to keep the agreement flexible.<br />
By the end of the eightics we had agrccd on a principle of keeping wage<br />
movements competitive with our trading partners. We had also agreed on the<br />
principle of what we called a " social wage".<br />
By this we mean that where the government puts in health care, family assistance,<br />
quality education, income support for the disadvantaged and so forth, these too<br />
should be considered part of the Accord compact part of the deal between the<br />
Australian government and Australian cmployees.<br />
This idea of the " social wage" is the key to understanding the way our Accord<br />
works. While we focused wage movements on a central determination of the full bench of<br />
the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, all the industrial parties the<br />
unions, the government, the employers and thc Commission rapidly went about<br />
the job of preparing the ground for far bigger changes to come.<br />
We pressed for the amalgamation of unions. In the last six years we have halved<br />
the number of federally registered unions. We pressed for the simplification and<br />
renovation of awards, so that today there are fewer categories, fewer demarcation<br />
disputes, fewer gradations. We urged unions to use a single bargaining unit in<br />
negotiations, so that even where there was more than one union, all unions would<br />
consent to one agreemcent. We encouraged a review of minimum rates, so that the<br />
relationships between the minimum wages of different skills levels and so forth<br />
were looked at again and brought up to date.<br />
While that was going on in the industrial system, we were also changing the<br />
structure of our economy.<br />
Remember in 1983 we had a fixed exchange rate, high tariffs, high inflation, low<br />
profits and a recent history of warfare in industry. But by the late eighties and early<br />
nineties things were very different.<br />
We had had years of experience with a floating dollar. We had deregulated finance.<br />
We had put the government business enterprises on a commercial footing, so they<br />
had to make commercial decisions about pay increases. We had begun to reduce<br />
industry protection, and we had announced that protection would be reduced<br />
through the nineties, so the pressure would remain on for increasing efficiency and<br />
TELJ: A8-1. 9 10: 42 No. COO1-T. 2J </p>
<p>TEL 4<br />
competitiveness. We had seen that we had to internationalise our economy to<br />
preserve and enhance our living standards, and we could only successfully<br />
internationalise if we became more competitive.<br />
You might say that the whole climate and culture changed.<br />
We began to see results.<br />
By thc latcecighties we had restored the profit share. We had increased<br />
emplomentby one fifth the fastest cmployment growth in the OECD. We had<br />
began to change the industrial composition, so that manufacturing output was more<br />
than a third greater at the beginning of the nineties than it had been when we came<br />
to office.<br />
Wc also had evidence that we were beginning to successfully internationalise.<br />
Because of very moderate wage growth our competitiveness against other countries<br />
had increased by one tenth._ Exports had doubled, and manufacturing and service<br />
exports had tripled. More and more of our exports were going to Asian markets,<br />
locking us in to the fastest growing region of the world.<br />
And while all that was going on, industrial disputes for which this country was<br />
once notorious dwindled away. Last year we had the lowest number of disputes<br />
for thirty years.<br />
We did all this while also extending universal health care, child care, and funding a<br />
great explosion in education opportunities. And we did it while bringing both<br />
government spending and taxes down, so that we ended up with one of the lowest<br />
ratio of both spending and taxcs to GDP in the whole OECD.<br />
These were all very big changes, so big that we are only now beginning to realise<br />
what has happened. As even one of our critics conceded on the weekend it has<br />
actually happened. He wrote that it sounds like a lot of political puff, but the funny<br />
thing is that it has actually happened. It's actually there. Exports really are at 23<br />
per cent of GDP. Just shy of a quarter of everything we produce in this country is<br />
now sold abroad. We really have tripled manufacturing and service exports. We<br />
really havc had our greatest exporting successes in recent years with elaborately<br />
transformed manufactures like motor vehicles, boats, electrical equipment and<br />
industrial machinery. It's all there, it's all real, and if we don't throw it way it will<br />
continue and get better. TEL: 1~ 03: 142. flNuo. gU. U912 '-U' 4/ 11 </p>
<p>TEL: 31. Aug. 92 10: 42 NcvUU1 F-. Ut' 171<br />
These were the successful results, but more importantly for the way Australia<br />
works was the fact that we had by the beginning of' thc nineties accumulated nearly<br />
a decade's experience with the Accord. We trusted each other. The ACThJ has<br />
always delivered on its commitments. We found that the Accord stood up not only<br />
in hard times, but also in good times. In the early eighties boom money wages<br />
increased 20 per cent. When we went through a boom in the late eighties money<br />
wages increased by less than a third of that. We came out of the recession of<br />
1982/ 83 with inflation at 11.5 per cent. We are coming out of recession this time<br />
with inflation under 2 per cent.<br />
All this meant we were ready for another change.<br />
We had always recognised that we could not indefinitely focus all wage movements<br />
in a uniform movement. We had always recognised that the price of bringing<br />
inflation down and employment up through adjusting wages mainly in a single<br />
national decision would be some loss of flexibility which we would later wish to<br />
recover. So a few years ago we began putting in place a transition to a much more<br />
flexible system, under which the vast majority of decisions over wages and working<br />
practices would bc made at the workplace level, often within an industry<br />
framework. Four years ago we amended the law under which the AJRC operates to<br />
allow thc certification of agreements. In a speech in Melbourne in 1989, 1<br />
foreshadowed the switch, and in our submissions to the national wage case in 1990<br />
and 1991 we argued for the introduction of workplace bargaining based on<br />
productivity increases. The AIRC queried us at first but late last year it cleared the<br />
obstacle, and this year we have amended the act to encourage the making of<br />
workplace bargains throughout the country.<br />
So now we arc quite firmly entering a new era.<br />
In the last couple of years we have had more change in the workplace than in<br />
decades before. We have a couple of hundred agreements registered already, and<br />
there are many more coming forward. We have now got some very good examples<br />
of where we want the whole system to go agreements made by Sheraton, Toyota,<br />
GMH Holden, Email, Concrete Constructions and Southern Aluminium, to mention<br />
a few. All told we have many more people here working under registered<br />
enterprise agreements than under registered employment contracts in the New<br />
Zealand. We will about double that number when we bring the Australian Public<br />
Service into workplace bargains, and the Minister for Industrial Relations Peter<br />
Cook has already opened negotiations to do just that. </p>
<p>TEL:--31. flug. 92 10: 42 No. UU1 I'-UO/ 11<br />
6<br />
By this timc next year wc will have half the workforce under workplace bargains,<br />
and within a few years it will be the characteristic, the usual, the normal way in<br />
which our industrial relations arc conducted.<br />
Bargaining is the way, but arching over it we have an agreement with the ACTIJ<br />
that wage increases will be consistent with keeping our inflation rate comparable<br />
with our trading partners. This is a very important commitment, which entrenches<br />
our very low inflation rate, and our competitiveness. It's an agreement we can rely<br />
on one with teeth. The union movement has the ability to control the timing and<br />
extcnt of claims. And we as a government have already said that our commitment<br />
to superannuation increases over the decade, and to general minimum wage<br />
inceases from time to time, would bc reconsidered if wages growth started to<br />
outrun the level compatible with low inflation.<br />
Frankly, I think we could run into big trouble if we press ahead with workplace<br />
bargaining without an agreement on inflation.<br />
Those who think workplace bargaining can be carried out without an agreement on<br />
restraining inflation are, I think, naive.<br />
Not only would we lose our very low inflation, but in the attempt to get it back<br />
government then has to depend on high interest rates to counter inflationary wage<br />
increases. This inevitably leads to higher unemployment.<br />
In this new system there remains an important role for the Australian Industrial<br />
Relations Commission in setting minimum rates in awards, and in so doing<br />
providing a safety net below which employees cannot fall. It will also have an<br />
important role in helping the parties to reach enterprise or industry agreements, in<br />
vetting single cnterprise agreements to make sure the employees have not been<br />
disadvantaged, and in vetting agreements which go beyond a single enterprise to<br />
make sure they are based on genuine productivity enhancements and relate to an<br />
industry rather than an to a craft or occupation.<br />
As the Commission reviews its guiding principles this year, we will be putting to it<br />
that it should adopt this role.<br />
So we are entering a whole new chapter in the long story of industrial relations in<br />
Australia. But sometime before May next year we will also have to make a choice.<br />
A choice of great consequence for our future. </p>

1 have to get a little trenchant here, a little partisan, but I know you people in the<br />
industrial relations world are quite comfortable with a spirited debate.<br />
You have enough cxperience to know that industrial relations goes right to the heart<br />
of what a country is about.<br />
This decision will rnot be about whether we switch to a system where employers<br />
and employees and their unions reach bargains in their workplace or industry.<br />
That is something we are already doing.<br />
It is not a dccision about whether wage changes should bc based on productivity<br />
movements, and on the mutual exploitation of productivity gains arising from<br />
changes in work practices.<br />
Again, that is something we are already doing.<br />
The real choice we must make in this country is between continuing a cooperative<br />
approach which has brought important, tangible and unquestionable benefits, or<br />
forcing employers and their employees into an industrial war from which neither<br />
would gain.<br />
The choice is whether we keep low inflation or throw it away.<br />
Whether we have an Accord or not.<br />
Whether we have a safety net for the poorly paid or not.<br />
Whcther people are forced off current awards without having a say or not.<br />
Whether they can count on their leave entitlements and their pay packet or not.<br />
Whether we have a quick and casy means of enforcing agreements or not.<br />
Whether we have ati umpire to make sure workplace agreements are fair and that<br />
people are not coerccd into bad deals or not.<br />
Whether employees are guaranteed rising superannuation contributions made by<br />
employers on their behalf through this decade or not.<br />
Whether we should accept a government responsibility to train the young and<br />
retrain adults or not. TEL </p>
<p>T3E1L : Rug. IO 4 2 N 0 0 1F UT5 I<br />
8<br />
Whether peoplc genuinely secking work should have incomne sport if they need it<br />
for as long as they need it or not.<br />
Whether we should press ahead with first order reforms like increasing productivity<br />
at the workplace and enhancing the quality of our workforce, or whether we should<br />
instead go the way of tenth order bogus reforms, like a consumption tax.<br />
These are the choices, and today I want to state quite unequivocally where my<br />
government stands.<br />
I want to offer a charter for the new era in industrial relations.<br />
In this charter I will make these undertakings on behalf of the Australian<br />
govcrnment. We undertake to maintain the inflation agreement with the ACTU, so that inflation<br />
in this country never again gets out of line with inflation in our trading partners, and<br />
the products of Australian industry remain competitive in world markets.<br />
We undertake to keep a safety net under the low paid and the poorly organised.<br />
We undertake to make sure workplace agreements are fair.<br />
We undertake to enforce agreements with simple procedures.<br />
We undertake not to force employees off awards.<br />
We undertake to allow employees to be covered by their unions.<br />
We undertake to train the young and retrain adults, to enhance our skills and the<br />
quality of our workforce.<br />
We undertake to build secure and comfortable retirements for Australian<br />
employees, and to build Australian saving, by increasing the superannuation<br />
guarantee throughout this decade.<br />
We undertake to provide an unquestioned right to income support to people who<br />
are genuinely seeking work, and to provide training and restraining programs for all<br />
who can benefit from them.<br />
TEL </p>
<p>TEL: 31. FAug. 92 10: 42 No. OU1 -U' 1<br />
9<br />
We undertake to not introduce a consumption tax, and wc undertake to fulfill our<br />
commitment to dramatically reduce the marginal tax rate on the income of most<br />
employees. And we undertake to take care of people to help working families with good child<br />
care, goad education and quality health care.<br />
What this charter comes down to is this.<br />
We will not belittle Australians in their working lives.<br />
We will not take away their rights in the factories shops and offices where they<br />
spend at least a third and often well over half of their waking hours.<br />
We will not cancel their say about how their work is organised and how it is<br />
rewarded. We will not prcpare for the 2 1st century by reinvoking thc rules and relationships<br />
of the 19th century.<br />
In our pursuit of economic efficiency, of greater output, we will not lose sight of<br />
the fact that we want greater output, greater efficiency, only as a means of<br />
improving the quality of our lives not at the expense of the quality of our lives,<br />
No doubt many of you who arrived over the weekend have had a chance to look<br />
around our lovely harbour here, and see some of the splcndours of waterfront<br />
Sydney. In a little while you'll be seeing a video of Sydney, which will show you more of<br />
the glamorous bits.<br />
But if you really want to see what this country is about, how we really live and<br />
what we really aspire to if you want to understand why the choice we are going to<br />
make will so important to this country I suggest you get on a train to a suburb like<br />
Bankstown. Bankstown is where my family comes from, where I grew up, where I've spent<br />
most of my adult ycars. I represent Bankstown in Parliament. </p>
<p>T: 31. Rug9.92 1O: 42 No. UUI F-7I1JTP--<br />
If you go therc you'll see it is very big suburb of simple family homcs, most with a<br />
garden. You'll see people of Anglo and Trish descent like my family, but these days<br />
you'll also see people from Italy and Greece, China and Vietnam, Turkey and<br />
Lebanon, all getting on reasonably well. You wont see spectacular sights like the<br />
harbour, but you will see churches and community centres, hospitals and clinics,<br />
public swimming pools and playing fields.<br />
This is suburban Australia, which is where most Australians live, but it is not<br />
wealthy or privileged or clitist.<br />
It's a good life out there for most peoplc, with good houses, good schools and good<br />
medical care and access to good colleges for kids who want to go on. Thcre is child<br />
care for working families, and quality treatment for everyone in public hospitals.<br />
Thcre is more unemployment there now than we arc prepared to accept, but we are<br />
rapidly expanding training schemes for unemployed youngsters, and retraining<br />
schemes for unemployed adults, and we are funding projects in the local<br />
community which can employ people quickly, while the economic expansion now<br />
underway comes through to provide long term jobs.<br />
It's safe by the standards most cities, and it's a neighbourhood where people still<br />
look out for one another.<br />
It's a world which has changed a lot over the last decade new factories being<br />
built, old ones being closed.<br />
Children moving off into new occupations in the -service industries, which their<br />
parents would not have dreamed of. Much more pressure to compete and be<br />
successful at school and at college or university. Much more pressure to match the<br />
best the world can produce.<br />
It's been a tough decade in many respects, one in which the economy has imposed<br />
many new demands.<br />
But part of the deal has always been that working people in places like Bankstown<br />
have some control in their working lives, some predictability, some assurance that<br />
their pay packets and conditions will be protected.<br />
Some assurance that they and their families can rely on good health care, good<br />
education and safe neighbourhoods.<br />
These things are all part of what I said earlier was our " social wage".<br />
TEL </p>
<p>TEL: 11<br />
They are all part of the compact the Australian government has made with<br />
Australian employees.<br />
As I say Bankstown is not a place for spectacular scenery, but what we have out<br />
there are things we value very highly, things we are prcparcd to work hard for and<br />
keep for our children.<br />
Things we will not lightly throw away.<br />
Things Australians have worked hard for, and which this government will fight to<br />
protect. They are things the charter I have announced today is designed to safeguard.<br />
