PRIME MINISTER<br />
SPEECH BY T13E PRIME NMqNSTER THE HON P J KEATING, MY<br />
FOR THE PRIME MINISTER FOR THlE SOUTH PACIFIC ENVIRONMENT<br />
uMIN S S mMEEIG, HERITAGE HOTEL BRISBANE,<br />
16 AUGUST<br />
I am very pleased to be able to speak to you today both as Prime Minister of Australia<br />
and as Chair of the South Pacific Forum.<br />
This is an important meeting the first time Environment Ministers from the South<br />
Pacific Forumn have ever met together.<br />
So it is very disappointing that the event which has brought it about is such an unhappy<br />
one France's decision on I' 3; Juxne to resume the testing of nuclear weapons in the<br />
Pacific. The response to that decision both within this regon and outside it was swift and strong.<br />
Much swifter and stronger, I am sure, than the Government of France expected.<br />
The reactions reflected, I think, a sense of betrayal. Betrayal by one of the current<br />
nuclear powers, which had only recently pledged to exercise the ' utmost restraint! in<br />
testing. Betrayal by a democracy. A betrayal of the hopes all of us felt with the end of<br />
the Cold War that the world might finally free itself from the awful threat of nuclear<br />
destruction. The French decision was a bad decision, because it put at risk our efforts to secure two of<br />
the basic pillars of a non-nuclear world the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and<br />
universal membership of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.<br />
And within this region the region, far-from France, where the test are to be conducted<br />
it raised particular concerns, of course, about the environmental damage the testing<br />
program rmght cause.<br />
In response to Frances decision many countries around the world have raised their voices<br />
in protest Action has been taken by countries individually, in regional forums and<br />
globally in the United Nations and other international organisations. </p>
<p>For its part, the South Pacific region contains some of the worlds smallest and most<br />
ecologically vulnerable states. But all of them are in a profound material and spiritual<br />
relationship with the Pacific Ocean. And through the South Pacific Forum especially,<br />
their voice has been heard in this international outcry.<br />
Immediately after the French Government's announcement, a Ministerial Mission from<br />
the Forum visited Paris to express our concerns directly to the French-The delegation<br />
was led by the Australian Foreign Minister, Senator Evans. President Dowiyogo of<br />
Nauru, who is with us at this meeting, was present, too, together with representatives of<br />
Papua New Guinea, New Zealand and Western Samoa.<br />
Since then, a Regional Action Committee has been set up with the assistance of the<br />
Forum Secretariat to coordinate our responses to the testing program. It will meet again<br />
tomorrow here in Brisbane.<br />
We are taking actions in other parts of the world, too. For example, Forum diplomatic<br />
representatives i Washington from the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated<br />
States of Micronesia, Western Samoa, New Zealand and Australia have made joint<br />
representations on nuclear issues to members of Congress and the Administration.<br />
I want to take this opportunity to thank Secretary General Tabai, in particular, for the<br />
enormous effort he has put into developing and coordinating the Forum response.<br />
The campaign against French nuclear testing by Forum members has been strong and<br />
consistent And I believe it has already been useful for example, in encouraging the<br />
welcome French decision on 9 August to pursue a zero threshold in the negotiations for a<br />
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. But there is much further to go.<br />
We wI have a further opportunity to review where matters stand at the Forum meeting<br />
in Madang next month.<br />
An important point to underline is that none of the responses to the testing decision by<br />
forum members has been motivated by hostility to France or to its role in the Pacific.<br />
Still less have our actions been the result of any antipathy towards the French people or<br />
French culture. It has concerned me whenever that line has been breached in public<br />
protests. We are opposed, simply, to this single bad decision. And we want to see it changed.<br />
Over recent years, with the Maftignon Accords in New Caledonia and the 1992 French<br />
moratorium on nuclear testing, our region's relations with France had probably never<br />
been better.<br />
That is the situation we want to sec again a productive and creative French engagement<br />
with this region. </p>
<p>But the testing decision has apin raised questions about how well the French<br />
Government understands the attitudes and concerns of the people of this region.<br />
Because the region's response should not have come as a surprise to President Chirac or<br />
his advisers.<br />
Our history of opposition to the testing of nuclear weapons and the dumping of nuclear<br />
waste in this region has been long and consistent<br />
It has been expressed in a number of ways over many years: in communiques and<br />
declarations of successive South Pacific Forum meetings; in the 1985 Treaty of<br />
Raratonga and in the 1993 South Pacific Regional Environment Protection Convention.<br />
This meeting is a further practical expression of our concern about the nuclear issue. I<br />
want to thank my colleague, John Faulkner, for the arrangements he has made to bring it<br />
about. You will be focusing on the environmental consequences of the French Governments<br />
decision. Australia's Chief Scientist Professor Michael Pitman has brought together a<br />
scientific advisory group of scientists with nuclear, geological, seismic, meteorological<br />
and marine expertise to provide you with scientific advice.<br />
You will have an opportunity to review this evidence and to consider a possible<br />
monitoring regime for the region. Your recommendations will provide a very important<br />
input into the discussions when Forum leaders meet next month in Maclang.<br />
Soon after President Chirac announced his decision about testing I wrote an article for<br />
the French newspaper LeMonde as Chairman of the South Pacific Forums in which I<br />
tried to convey to ordinary French people why it is that we in the Pacific oppose the<br />
testing program SO stron gly.<br />
I wrote that " There is a world of difference between studying a map of the Pacific in<br />
Europe and living on the shores of the ocean in Sydney or Brisbane or Auckland or Suva.<br />
" The map puts these places a long way from Mururoa. But when you live in these places<br />
you know that, vast thought it is, the South Pacific is one environment and it binds all<br />
those who share it."<br />
That knowledge which we all share is why this meeting is being held. It is why the issues<br />
you are considering are so important.<br />
It is why people in all the Forum countries will join me in wishing you well in your<br />
discussions. </p>
