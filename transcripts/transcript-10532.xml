    <content><![CDATA[<p>JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, how confident are you on getting Tony Blair on side on greenhouseÂ gases?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:Â Well, I'm very confident that Australia will go to the Kyoto Conference offering in aÂ very constructive way to play its part but putting forward a proposition that protectsÂ the Australian national interest. My job is to look after Australia. Mr Blair's job is toÂ look after Britain. Obviously, we come from somewhat different points of view on Â this issue and there is no point in pretending otherwise because Britain'sÂ circumstanccs art different from Australia's but I'll be seeing him this afternoon andÂ I'm quite certain that. consistent with the capacity of our two countries to work thingsÂ through, I'm quite certain that although we have different vantage points whereÂ appropriate we will agree to disagrce.</p>
<p><br />JOURNALIST: Do you think you'll be out on your own at CHOGM on the issue?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:Â I wouldn't expect so, but at the and of the day it's not a question of whether you'reÂ out on your own or not, it's whether you're doing the right thing by Australia, andÂ there is no doubt in the world that the stance that I am taking is in Australia's nationalÂ s on that criteria and according to that benchmark that I choose to be Â nothing else.</p>
<p>JOURNALSIT:Â intres might support Australia's position?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:Â  the faintest idea. 1 don't think it's a qiiestion of lining up one supporting theÂ I don't think that's the issue at all. The issuc is what is in the best interests of'Â , italia and I can just say to the Australian public that as Mrmc Minister I'll beÂ iocating Australia's iterest. I'll naturally be doing it in a co-operative way andÂ ir position includes making a very significant contribution to the reduction ofÂ jeenhouse gases but judge mec by what I do for Australia. not according to anythingÂ else.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, negative inflation. A good result. Any implications for interest rates,Â do you think?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:Â Oh, it was a magnificent result. I mean this is astonishingly good economic news.Â This is the lowest intlation rate in 35 years. Australia has a government which has gotÂ the fundamentals in the Australian economy right in a way that we haven't seen forÂ or more yeart.. You have the best convergence of economic fuindamentals now. ItÂ bodes well for very strong economic growth and that's important for employmentÂ because if we can but through the 4 per cent growth figure, and this lays theÂ foundation for it, then we Can start to sec unemployment come down because theÂ passport to lower unemployment is strong growth and you can't have strong growth ifÂ you have inflationary pressures and we don't have them. This is a tremendousÂ outcome for Australia and sends a very positive signal to the business communityÂ </p>
<p>JOLRNALIST: On interest rates?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:Â on all fronts. Inm not going to speculate about interest rates, you know that, IÂ won't do it. But you couldn't have a better inflationary situation. You have got aÂ strong budget situation and our budgct position is very strong indeed. Thc dcisionsÂ we took in the first two budgets have mnade the ground work for a strongly growingÂ Ausitralian econormy and I'm absolutely delighted. We took the hard decisions early.Â We've been criticised. We've been derided but we are now starting to see the fruits ofÂ thai fiscal rectitude and it is going to be seen in higher growth, fafling uncmploymentÂ and a much bctter output next year.<br />Thank you.</p>
