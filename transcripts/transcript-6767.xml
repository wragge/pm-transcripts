COMMONWEALTH HEADS OF GOVERNMENT MEETING<br />
THE NASSAU COMMUNIQUE<br />
OCTOBER 19.85<br />
Commonwealth Secretariat<br />
Cable Beach Hotel<br />
Nassau<br />
22 October 1985 </p>
<p>1HE NASSAU I) CLARATION ON ^ RLD ORDE(<br />
1. On the Fortieth Anniversary of the kounding of the United Nations,<br />
we, the Comnonweslth leads of Government assembled at Nassau, recall to all<br />
countries and peoples tho need for world order and the central importance of<br />
the United Nations system in which all should participate and from which all<br />
should benefit. In the world of today and of tomorrow, international<br />
co-operation is not an option but a necessity.<br />
2. We believe that at this historic moment our world society should<br />
take stock of its considerable achievements as well as its failures, and<br />
allow hope and encouragement from the former to strengthen resolve in<br />
redressing the latter. Yet these very achievements make the more disturbing<br />
any movement away from aultllateralism and' internationalism from a world<br />
aspiring to be governed by fair and open rules towards unilateral action and<br />
growing ascendance of power in all spheres: economic, political and<br />
military. We warn that a return to narrow nationalisms, both economic and<br />
plitical, in a climate of tension and confrontation between nations<br />
ightened by the nuclear arms race, Invites again the dangers from which the<br />
world set out to rid itself at San Francisco n 1945. We issue that warning<br />
mindful that the nuclear menace ieperils all peoples and nations and the very<br />
survival of our human species.<br />
3. The conduct of relations between nations necessitates adherence to,<br />
and preservation of, certain accepted international norms and principles. A<br />
retreat from these norms and principles Indreases the threat to the sovereignlty,<br />
independence, unity and territorial integrity of states. In particular,<br />
we are concerned that the world com4nlty face up to the nature and<br />
needs of small states, many of them among our membership, respond to their<br />
particular vulnerability with imagination and resolve and work to create an<br />
environment for their protection and support.<br />
4. As a Coqonealth whose great majority live in poverty, we believe<br />
it imperative that that world community redouble its efforts to enlarge the<br />
prospects of social and economic advance for three-quarters of the human<br />
race. We recognise the progress achieved in developing countries in the last<br />
four decades through domestic effort and international support. However, the<br />
world must make better use of its collective resources to secure more equitable<br />
progress for all. In a global community of acknowledged and increasing<br />
interdependence between nations, which is undergoing rapid technological<br />
advance and which has the resources to meet the needs of all, the continuing<br />
disparities that divide the world's rich and poor are a daily reminder that<br />
only partnership and collective effort and reognition of economic realites<br />
will give a fresh thrust to growth and devel pment for all. There is th a<br />
pressing need to renew the consensus on international co-operation ior<br />
development within the United system and to revitalise multilateral institutions<br />
to meet the goals of our global society for sustainable economic growth<br />
within a framework of stability.<br />
S. We recognise that the United Nations and its institutions are not<br />
without imperfections, but are convinced tha-the solutipn lies not In their<br />
rejection but in their rejuvenation Usiig the system effectively is as<br />
important as changing it. We therefore we come the efforts of the United<br />
Nations Secretary-General and others to enhance the efectiveness of the<br />
world body and its capacity to prevent and resolve conflicts, and pledge to<br />
work to this end. </p>
<p>6. In the spirit of international democracy to tdiich we attach imprtance<br />
we hope that all nations will demonstrate the desite to seek accord and<br />
the will to negotiate constructively wh~ ich are crucial to the success of<br />
Elobal Institutions. We believe that tlie Comonwem 1this way of doing<br />
Cuiness. of seeking consensus based on equality . and justice between nations,<br />
serves as an example for all.<br />
7. Therfore, as leaders of the Comonweealth comrising One thousand<br />
million people and third of the world's nations, and mindful that obligations<br />
devolve upon us separately and collectively:.<br />
-We comit ourselves and our nations to work tirelessly<br />
In the pursuit of a wirld marked -not by<br />
disorder and the use of campetitive power but one<br />
governed by the principles of ' collective ihternational<br />
co-operation and res t for the rights of<br />
all nations and peoples as h necessary fotuidation<br />
for lasting peace and assured economic and social<br />
developmsent;<br />
-We reaffirm our comsituent to the principles and<br />
precps of the Chiarter of the'United Nations, and<br />
totegoal of strengthening the United Nations<br />
system as the central Instrument of peace, se curity<br />
and co-operation among nations. As we ourselves<br />
categorically reject the use or, threat of force as<br />
a means of settling disputes wo appeal ! to all<br />
governiments to work to strengtl6e the institutions<br />
which contribute to orderly resolution of<br />
differences between nations and which sustain peace;<br />
-We re-dedicate ourselves to th principles of<br />
self -determination, non-racialismlhu= freedo<br />
and equality, and co-operation ' between nat~ Ons, in<br />
the service of iuternatioa understandino,<br />
development and world peace, 4Aich have guidedth<br />
Cinonwealth throughout Its evolton;<br />
-We pledge ourselves to play a full part in'revitahiin<br />
International co-operation for de" lopment<br />
and concerted action to confront the cruciax Iss$<br />
of international economic Inequality;<br />
* We call upon the world ty to0o iCcOM M rct a<br />
framework of collective seuriy based on mutual<br />
trust and shared Interest. I1 nations have a<br />
stake in disarmaet. Ne therefore look Eoi urgent<br />
agreement in reversing the ! erms race and an<br />
signlf icant reducns, and e" e tual eliminition Of<br />
nuclear and other weapons of malt, destruction;<br />
-We Invite all peoples and na~ ions to join in a<br />
universal effort to fulfil these, objections.' </p>
<p>believing that the tbm. of t 6 11tAi1mthit vrary celebrutions,<br />

Adopted by Heads of Governent<br />
21 October, 18S. </p>
<p>ThE coWOWELV ACM= R ON SJflDN MICA<br />
We consider that South Africa's continuing refusal to dismantle<br />
apartheid, its illegal occupation of Namibia, and its aggression alainst its<br />
neighbours constitute a serious challenge to the values and principles of the<br />
Comowealth, a challenge which Cmmonweulth countries cannot ignore. At New<br />
Delhi we expressed the view that " only the eradication of apartheid and the<br />
establishment of majority rule on the besis of free and fair exercise of<br />
universal adult suffrage by all the people in a united and non-fragmented<br />
South Africa can lead to a just and lasting solution of the explosive<br />
situation prevailing in Southern Africa." We are united In the belief that<br />
reliance on the range of pressures adopted so far ies not resulted in the<br />
fundamental changes we have sought" over ma*. years. The growing crisis and<br />
intensified repression in South Africa mean that apartheid must be dismantled<br />
now If a greater tragedy is to be averted and that concerted pressure must be<br />
brought to bear to achieve that end. We consider that the situation calls for<br />
urgent practical steps.<br />
2. We, therefore, call on the authorities in Pretoria for the following<br />
steps to be taken in a genuine manner and as a matter of urgency:<br />
Declare that the system of apartheid will be dismantled<br />
and specific and meaningful action taken in fulfilment<br />
of that Intent.<br />
Terminate the existing state of emergency.<br />
Release imediately and unconditionally Nelson Mandels<br />
and all others imprisoned and detained for their opposition<br />
to apartle id.<br />
Establish political freedom a nd specifically lift the<br />
existing ban on the African National Congress and other<br />
political parties.<br />
Initiate, in the context of a suspension of violence on<br />
all sides, a process of dialogue across lines of colour,<br />
politics and religion, with a view to establishing a<br />
non-racial and representative government.<br />
3. We have agreed on a number of measures which have as their rationale<br />
impressing on the authorities in Pretoria the c* peiling urgency of<br />
dismantling aprtheid and erecting the structures of democracy in " nuth<br />
Africa. The latter, in particular, demands a process 6f dialogue inv. ving<br />
the true representatives of the majority black populatioo of South Africa. We<br />
believe that we must do all we can to assist that process, while recognising<br />
that the forms of political settlement in South Africa are for the people<br />
that country all the people to determine.<br />
4. To this end, we have decided to establish a small group of eminent<br />
Commonwealth persons to encourage through all practicable ways the evolution<br />
of that necessary process of politica dialogue. ie art not unmindful of the<br />
difficulties such an effort will encounter, inctLiudit the possibility of<br />
initial rejection by the South African authorities, but, we believe It to be<br />
our duty to leave nothing undone that might contribute to peaceful change in </p>
<p>South Africa aind avoid tiw dreadful prospect of vrolent conflict that looms<br />
over South Africa, threatening people of a11 races in the country,, and the<br />
peace and stability of the entire Southern Africa region.<br />
S. We are asking th President Of Zaai and the . Prim Ministers of<br />
Australia.. The Beam Canada, India. the United zing~ om and Zimbabwe to<br />
develop with the Secretary-General the modalities of this effort to assist the<br />
process of political dialogue io South Africa. We would look to the group of<br />
eminent persons to seek to facilitate the processes of dialogue referred to in<br />
paragraph 2( e) above anid by all practicable means to advance the fulfilment of<br />
the objectives of this Accord.<br />
6. For our part, we have as an earnest of our opppettion to apartheid<br />
reached accord on a programe of cqmmon action as follows:<br />
we declare the Cominwealth's support for the strictest<br />
enforcement of the madatory arms ebargo, against South<br />
Africa. in accordance with United Nations Security Council<br />
Resolutions 418 anid 558 and comit ourse~ ves to prosecute<br />
violators to the fullest extent of the law;<br />
( 11) we reaffirm the Gleneagles Declaration of 1977, which<br />
called upon Ciorealth -meehrs to take every practical<br />
stop to discourage sportinig contacts with South Africa;<br />
( lit) we agree upon, and commend to other governments, tho<br />
adoption of the followin further economic measures<br />
against South Africa, thl cb have already been adopted<br />
by a number of mater countries:<br />
a ban on all now government loans to the<br />
Governmenit of South africa and its agencies;<br />
a readiness to take unilaterally. ihat action<br />
may be possible to preclude the Import of<br />
Krugerrand;<br />
Wc no Goveruemnt funding for trade missions to<br />
South Africa or for prticipation in exhibitions<br />
and trade fairs in South-Africa;<br />
Wd a ban an thesale and export of oputer<br />
eq~ ipment capable of use by South African<br />
military forces,, police or securty forces;<br />
a ban on nowcontracts for te and<br />
export of nuclear goos, materials and<br />
technology to South Africa;,<br />
Mf a ban on the sale and export of oil to<br />
South Africa;<br />
a strict and rigorously controlled embargo<br />
on Imprts of arms, Ammunition, military<br />
vehicles and paramilitary eqaipinent from<br />
South Africa; </p>
<p>01) an soargo on all military coli'ration<br />
with South Africa; and<br />
discouragement of all cultural and scientific<br />
events except wbere these contrite towards<br />
the ending of apartheid or have no possible<br />
role In prmotiq it.<br />
7. It is our hope that the process and measures we have agreed upon<br />
will help to bring about concrete progress towards the objectives stated<br />
above in six months. The Heads of Governent mntioned in peragraph 5 above,<br />
or their representatives, will then met to review thp situation. If in<br />
tleir opinion adequate progress has not been made within this period, we<br />
agree to consider the adoption of further measures. S~ o of us would, in<br />
that event, consider the following steps mong others:<br />
a ban on air links with South Africa;<br />
a ban on now investment or reinvestment ' of profits<br />
earned in South Africa;<br />
a ban on the import of agricultural proAucts from<br />
South Africa;<br />
the termination of double taxation agreements with<br />
South Africa;<br />
the termination of all goverment assistance to<br />
investment in, and trade with, South Africa;<br />
a ban on all government procurement in South Africa;<br />
a ban on government contracts with majority owned<br />
South Arican companies;<br />
a ban on the promotion of tourism to South Africa.<br />
8. Finally, we agree that should all of the above measures fail to<br />
produce the desired results within a reasonable perioa, further effective<br />
measures will have to be considered. Many of us have either taken or are<br />
prepared to take measures which go beyond those listed 4bove, and each of us<br />
will pursue the objectives of this Accord in all the . wys and through all<br />
appropriate fore open to us. We believe, however, that in pursuing this<br />
Prograune jointly, we enlarge the prospects of an orderly transitirv to<br />
social, economic and political justice in South Africa and peact md<br />
stability in the Southern Africa region as a whole.<br />

1. Comonwealth Heads of Government net in Nassau rm 16 to 22 October<br />
1985. Of the 46 countries which attended 41 were represented by their Heads<br />
of State or Prime Ministers. Thei-Prime Minister of Thi Bahamas, Sir Lynden<br />
Pindling, was in the Chair.<br />
2. Heads of Government sent a message of felicitation to Her Majesty<br />
the Queen as Head of the Comonwealth. They expressed great pleasure at the<br />
opportunity of meeting in Nassau and deep appreciation of the excellent<br />
arranSements made for the Meeting and the generous hospitality extended to<br />
them by the Government of The Bahamas.<br />
3. Heads of Government warmly welcomed their colleagues from Brunei<br />
Darussalsm, which had joined the Commonmalth on resiming Independence in<br />
1984, and from St. Vincent and the Grenadines and the Republic of Maldives,<br />
which had become full members since the last Meeting.<br />
4. Heads of Government expressed their deep sense of loss at the death<br />
of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi of India, who had chaired their last eeting,<br />
and of President Forbes Burnham of Guyana and Prime Minister Tom Adams of<br />
Barbados, and recalled their significant services to the Commonealth.<br />
In reviewing international developments since their last Meeting,<br />
Heads of Government were concerned by the continuing evidence of a declinein<br />
comitment to co-operative approaches to the ordering of global affairs.<br />
Meeting as they did while the General Assembly of the United Nations was<br />
marking the fortieth anniversary of the founding of the world body, Heads of<br />
Government felt impelled to voice their concerns, and their hopes for the<br />
future, in their separate Nassau Declaration on World Order. Their views on<br />
a maber of other important problems and issues are set out below.<br />
Di sarmemnt<br />
6. Heads of Government welcomed the reactivtiop of bilateral arms<br />
talks between the United States and the Soviet Union. iThey recogised that<br />
these negotiations would be significantly influenced by the forthcoming<br />
meeting in November between General Secretary Gorbachev and President Reagan,<br />
and stressed the importance of a constructive and positive outcome. They<br />
urged the two leaders to achieve their declared objective of preventing an<br />
arms race in space and terminating it on earth.<br />
7. As world civilisation was already under threat from existing nuclear<br />
arsenals, they appealed to the two leaders to halt the ! wclesr arms race and<br />
begin without delay the process of reversing it through significant measures </p>
<p>of nuclear disarmament. Mwost stressed In particular ths e red to prevent a<br />
now and uncontrolled arms race in outer spae.<br />
B. Recognising the significant contribution which the cessation of<br />
nuclear testing within the framework Of an effective nuclear disarmament<br />
process would represent, they called upon wiclear weapons states to<br />
facilitate and pursue vigorously through the Comuittee on Disarfaament the<br />
early resolut ion of outstanding problems, including the problem of<br />
verification, over a Comprehensive Test ban Treaty Zn the meantime most<br />
Heads of Government stressed the need for earnest e~ ffozit to be made for an<br />
immiediate halt to the testing of nuclear weapons. Most Heads of Government<br />
recalled the importance of the consensus declaration ' of the Third Review<br />
Conference of the NonProlifeoration Treaty,<br />
9. Heads of Government expressed special concern. that some countries<br />
might be involved in the actual or potential manufacture' of chemical weapons,<br />
and urged that a global aid verifiable agreement to ban the development,<br />
production, stockpiling and deployment of chemical weapons be achieved as<br />
soon as possible.-<br />
small States Heads of Government welcomed the Report, ' Vulnerability: Small<br />
States in the Global Society'. pre ared by the Consultative Group set up<br />
following their New Delhi Meeting. Trey expressed their appreciation of the<br />
comprehensive and sensitive analysis of the situation of small states and of<br />
the unique problems that arise from their inherent high level of<br />
vulnerability. They believed the Report would holp to increase international<br />
awareness of the link between the well-being of mall states and wider<br />
concerns for peace and security, and that this would enlarge the<br />
for creative international responses. Heads of Government,<br />
hoiever, stressed that action to reduce the vulnerability of these states<br />
should not diminish their status as independent, sovereign and equal members<br />
of the world comm~ unity. Efforts should be directed, at working for the<br />
realisation of a global environment safe for small states and conducive to<br />
their economic viability.<br />
11. Heads of Government welcomed the wide range of approaches suggested<br />
in the Group's Report directed at enabling small states to become more<br />
self-reliant both through their own initiatives and through bilateral and<br />
multilateral action. They also endorsed the Report's emphasis on the<br />
increased potential for action at the regional level. Noting with appi -val<br />
that some governments had already established programmes of support for .11<br />
states, they urged continuing appraisal of these progrmme in the light of<br />
the Report. They also encouraged other governments in a position to do so to<br />
establish similar programmes.<br />
12. Headis of Government drew particular attention to the analysis and<br />
recomendations pertaining to the economies of small states. In respect of<br />
immediate International action, they called on international i~ nancial<br />
institutions to pay due regard, In providing access to their resources, to<br />
the structural problems which impede economic divers if Icat ion and which are<br />
compounded by the relatively higher per capita costs for installing and<br />
maintaining infrastructure including transportation, the latter being of </p>
<p>particular significance to small island States. They tomeded the Report'i<br />
reCoeuendat ions regarding graduation from IDA and the IM, and supported the<br />
view expressed In the Report that " relatively high per capita income leveli<br />
give a distorted view of actual development achievement. We regard It aC<br />
extremely important that graduation should not be applied to s" all statel<br />
until there is assurance of adequate availability of capital from othei<br />
sources". They stressed too the relevance support for regional efforts ti<br />
bolp overcome the problems, anating from small size. Recognising thi<br />
Inevita~ bility of 4h relative openness of their leconomies and theli<br />
susceptibility to external and internal shocks, they called also for earl,,<br />
attention to the rec~ mendations concerning favourable access to produci<br />
inarkets and to international safety-ret arrangements.<br />
13. Heads of Government stressed the particular p~~ oblems being faced b,<br />
small land-locked states In Southern Africa, especiallyl at this time, and the<br />
need f or increased assistance for domestic and regilonal efforts to overcomi<br />
their transportation and other special problems<br />
14. Heads of Government asked the $ acre tary-Genera I to undertake<br />
appropriate action to folo-up the Report's conclusio~ s and recommendationi<br />
and to ensure that small states continue to receive priority in the econamit<br />
and developaiental assistance rendered by the Secretariat. They welcomed th<br />
fact that Report pointed directions In which mfill states could taki<br />
measures to increase their national security capacity and urged the roed œ oi<br />
a sustained Coimonwealth -wide effort to ensure tiia maximum benefit I!<br />
derived from it. They also undertook to consider such appropriate forms ol<br />
collective support as have been referred to in the Report, Doth within th<br />
Conoealtb and through the United Nations. In addition, they called for<br />
meeting of Commonwealth officials to formulate a programme of action ti<br />
implement the recomendations and to press for international action wheri<br />
required. Heads of Government drew particular attention . to the recommendation<br />
that the United Nations should strengthen its capaity to safeguard th,<br />
security of vulnerable states and that the United Nations Secretary-Genera<br />
should play a more active role, In the spirit of Article 99 of the Unite,<br />
Nations Charter, in responding to requests from a state feeling itself unde<br />
military threat.<br />
16. Heads of Government also stressed the importance of the role the.<br />
the Comonvealth Secretar, eea&amp; ol ly nassigacut<br />
anticipating a security crisi. 7. eea col payi asstn a wr<br />
17. Recognising the importance to small states of participation I&amp; th<br />
work of the United Nations, Heads of Government expressed appreciat ion of th<br />
support given by Australia for the office in Now Yfork accommodating thb<br />
permanent missions at the United Nations of several stiall ember states fro<br />
the Asia-Pacific region. They also requested the Comsonwealt<br />
Secretary -General to explore the possibility of the' extension of simila<br />
facilities to other regional groups that migt seek such assistance for th<br />
consideration of member governments. They also agreed to consider th<br />
Possibility of collective funding and requiested the Secretary-General t<br />
prfeent proposals to member states. </p>
<p>18. In commending tie Report to the lnternational cosunity Heads of<br />
Govenrrnt asked the Secretary-General to facilitate its circulation both<br />
within and beyond the Camme6ealth.<br />
Southern Africa<br />
19. Heads of Government, having set out in their leparate statement,<br />
' The Comonalth Accord on Southern Africa', a united Voximmwealth response<br />
to the continuing problem of apartheid In South Africa also addressed the<br />
other najor issues of the region: the question of South Africa's continued<br />
llel occupation of Namibia and the regime's acts of aggression against its<br />
neighbouring states.<br />
ZO. Heads of Govermwont were gravely concerned that Numbia' s<br />
independence had been further delayed. They considered: the establishment of<br />
the so-called interim administration as null and void &amp; d renewed their call<br />
for the imediate implementation of Security Council iesolution 435 ( 1978)<br />
which they reaffirmed as the only acceptable basis fo bringing Namibia to<br />
independence. In accordance with this position, they again rejected attempts<br />
to delay Namibia's freedom by linking it to the withd~ awal of Cuban troops<br />
from Angola. They also stressed that the policy of " coistructlve engagement"<br />
had failed to end South Africa's Intransigence over Namibia as well as over<br />
apartheid. 21. Heads of Goverment recalled that in New Delhi they had agreed that<br />
if South Africa continued to obstruct the iplementation of Resolution 435,<br />
the adoption of appropriate measures under the Charter of the United Nations<br />
would have to be considered. They also agreed that the action which they<br />
envisaged in their separate Accord on South Africa should be directed equally<br />
towards ensuring South Africa's compliance with the wishes of the<br />
international community on the question of Namibia.<br />
22. Heads of Goverment recalled that when South Africa entered into<br />
pacts with Angola and Mozambique early in 1984, the hope had been expressed<br />
that they would lead to peace in the region. But far from breaking the cycle<br />
of violence, South Africa had continued to occupy Anplan territory and to<br />
launch attacks against that country. It had also continuod its<br />
destabilisation programe against its neighbours as evidenced in its<br />
self-confessed active support for UNITA, the Angolan rebel movement, and in<br />
the support given to the MNR, the rebel movement in bzambique. Heads of<br />
Government again called for the iuediate withdrawal of all South African<br />
troops from Angola and an end to all assistance to dissident movements ii the<br />
relion. They also called upon all states to do everything in their pow to<br />
refrain from any actions which might entailed support for or encourage South<br />
African attacks on or continued insurgency in these countries.<br />
23. Heads of Government condemned the South African regime's continued<br />
attacks on those neighbourin% cowtries which have refused to enter into<br />
pacts with it. They especially deplored the brutal attack against Botswana<br />
a Commorwesith country, in June 1985. In this regard they expressed full<br />
support for Security Council Resolution 568 ( 1985) which called for an end to<br />
all such acts of aggression and demanded that Sotth Africa make full<br />
compensation to Botswana œ or the loss of life, injury and damage to property. </p>
<p>24. Heads of Government approved the report of the Commonwealth<br />
Comittee on Southern Africa and in comending its work asked it to continue<br />
paying particular attention to developmnts in Namibia and South Africa.<br />
Heads of Government agreed that the progrsne to counteract<br />
apartheid propaganda they had launched in New Delhi should be continued.<br />
26. Heads of Governmnt welcomed the progress made by Comonwealth<br />
training programes for South African and Namibian refugees and agreed that<br />
these be expanded.<br />
Cyprus 27. Heads of Government reaffirned the position they took at New Delhi<br />
and their support for the independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity,<br />
unity and non-aligned status of Cyprus, and reiterated their condemnation and<br />
non-recognition of the unilateral declaration of independence by the Turkish<br />
Cypriot authorities in November 1983. They declared that they would not<br />
recognise, and denounced, the subsequent measures designed to consolidate the<br />
secessionist state in the area of Cyprus which to their deep regret remains<br />
under foreign occupation. They noted with satisfaction that no other country<br />
besides Turkey had recognised or given assistance to the illegal entity.<br />
Heads of-Government stressed the importance of securing compliance with<br />
Security Council resolutions calling for the withdrawal of the unilateral<br />
declaration of independence and the continuation of the United Nations<br />
Secretary-General's mission of good offices, and, in particular, Security<br />
Council Resolutions 541 and 550. They strongly supported his latest<br />
initiative and expressed the hope that all parties would co-operate fully<br />
with him so that the negotiations could lead to a just and peaceful<br />
settlement in accordance with the Charter principles and United Nations<br />
resolutions on Cyprus. They also urged that no action be taken which might<br />
exacerbate the situation.<br />
28. Heads of Government commended the work of the Commonuealth Action<br />
Group on Cyprus they had set up at their last Meeting and the support it had<br />
given to the United Nations Secretary-General's good offices mission. As an<br />
expression of their continuing solidarity with the Government and people of<br />
Cyprus and their colleague, the President of Cyprus, they agreed that the<br />
Group should continue to monitor developments and assist the<br />
Secretary-General's efforts.<br />
Belize 29. Heads of Government reaffirmed their full support for the effor. of<br />
the Government of Belize to maintain its territorial integrity and<br />
consolidate its independence in the context of the claims to a part of its<br />

readiness to co-operate in the search for a settleent and the mandate<br />

They welcomed the adoption of the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty by<br />
the South Pacific Forum on 6 August 1985 at Rarotonqa as an important step in<br />
global and regional efforts to prevent nuclear proliferation. They noted that<br />
consultations would be held on the draft Protocol3 to, tho Treaty to enlist<br />
the support of nuclear wapon states for the Treaty and its Protocols.<br />
33. Heads of Government recognised that continued nuclear testing In the<br />

the search for such a settlement should be continued in a constructive manner.<br />
A a further mm* nn of ensuring lastinj peace iand stability in the<br />

towards agreement on the preparatory work for the long delayed United Nations<br />
Conference on the Implementation of the 1971 Declaration of the Indian Ocean<br />
as a Zone of Peace. They emphasised the importance of the Conference in view<br />
of the continuing military presence of outside powers, in the Indian Ocean<br />
against the wishes of most littoral and hinterland states. They reiterated<br />
the need to carry forward the preparations in order that the holding of the<br />

in Central America. At the New Delhi Meeting they had noted with great<br />
concern the escalation of tensions which posed a threat to the peace and<br />
stablility of the region with potentially dangerous consequences for<br />
international security. They stressed the urgent need to reduce these<br />
tensions and to achieve a lasting peace through dialogue and negotia ons.<br />
Despite progress in some areas, the situation had not improved in Ajor<br />
respects. In this context they expressed their continuing support for the<br />
Contadora Group's efforts to promote dialogue with the aim of finding lasting<br />
solutions to the region's problems and promoting its development. Believing<br />
that the Contadora Act of Peace and Co-operation in Central America of 7<br />
September 1984 had significantly assisted the negotiating process, they urged<br />
all states to refrain from carrying out, supporting or promoting political.<br />
economic or military actions which sight aggravaLe the situation in the<br />
region, and particularly in Nicaragua, or impede the Group'a efforts.<br />
Mediterranean 39. Heads of Government noted with concern the continuing dangerous<br />
situation of accumulation of forces in the M4. dlterranean region and the<br />
persistence of unresolved conflicts. They called for restraint and expressed </p>
<p>the view that the prospects of reduction of forces and armaments in the<br />
region would be enhanced through a Just and durable settlement to all the<br />
problems in the region.<br />
Heads of Government noted initiatives bein$ taken by various<br />
Mediterranean countries with the objective of transforming their region into<br />
a zone of peace, security and co-operation. They reaffirmed that security,<br />
co-operation and confidence-building in the Mediterranean and in Europe are<br />
closely interrelated.<br />
41. In this context, they noted with interest the results and Jecisions<br />
of the first meeting of Foreign Ministers of Non-kligned M~ editerranean<br />

preliminary basis for furthear initiatives towards peace in the region.<br />

arising from the unretolvod problems of the Middle East, especially the<br />
Palestinian issue, continued to pose a grave threat to international peace<br />
and security. They stressed the need to intensify efforts to achieve a<br />
settlement on the basis of relevant United Nations resolutions, Israel's<br />
withdrawal from territories occupied since 1967 and recognition of the<br />
inalienable rights of the Palestinian people to a national homeland, Qz well<br />
as the rights of all states in the region to live in peace within secure<br />
borders. They hoped that the Jordanian-Palestinian agreement of February<br />
1985 would assist progress towards a framew~ ork for durable peace. Host Heads<br />
of Government reaffirmed their view that the Palestinian Liberation<br />
Organisation, as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian<br />
people, must be involved on an eqwil footing in negotiations for a settlement.<br />

whichi continues in various areas of Lebanon and reaffirmed their support for<br />

Tey renewed their call for an urgent search for a nog otiatod settlemnt,<br />
based on the withdrawal of foreign troops and fit, 1 respect for the<br />
Independence, sovereignty and non-ali~ ned status of Afghanistan, and strict<br />
observance of the principles of non-intervention and non-intarierence, which<br />
would leave the Afghan people free to determine their n future. They also </p>
<p>roeaCflrmod the right of Afghan refugees to return to their hoi6s in safety<br />
and honour.<br />
Terrorin 46. Heads of Government were deeply concerned at the growing incidence<br />
of terrorism world-wide with its increasing toll on innocent lives. They<br />
condemned all terrorist activities whether perpetrated by individuals, groups<br />
or states, and resolved to counter them by every means possible. They in<br />
particular acknowledged the duty of governments to refrain from acts of, and<br />
encouragement to, terrorism in the territories of other states, and to resist<br />
the demands of terrorists, including demands for safe haven. They stressed<br />
the need for states to co-operate more closely in prev'enting and combating<br />
all form of terrorism and promoting appropriate action through competent<br />
international organisations. They also agreed to strengthen their adherence<br />
to the relevant legal instruments including those adopted under the auspices<br />

to the ratification process without unnecessary delay.<br />
World Ecornic Situation<br />
49. Heads of Government expressed concern at the continuing difficult<br />
world economic situation and its ipact on developing countries. They<br />
recognised that there were positive features such as the control of inflation<br />
and a recovery in output in most developed countries. However, they also<br />
noted that the recovery bad generally slowed down. They were concerned at<br />
the fragility and unevenness of the recovery and its failure, so far, to<br />
benefit most parts of the developing world. In spite of progress mac on<br />
some fronts, there were deep uncertainties about economic prospects.<br />
Heads of Government noted that the economic position of the vast<br />
majority of developing countries remained grave, especially in sub-Saharan<br />
Africa, with per capita incomes falling from levels which were already<br />
seriously inadequate. Balance of payments pressures, aggravated by falling<br />
comodity prices, onerous debt servicing obligations and redued, or in soe<br />
cases reverse, capital flows had imposed severe constraints on growth.<br />
51. Heads of Government stressed the mutuality of intorest between<br />
developed and developing countries. They welcomed the growing recognition in </p>
<p>industrial countries of the reality of interdependence, OrWdt0 the ne to<br />
broaden the basis of expansion through bolder, co-ordinatedi action. In this<br />
regard they noted the growing importance of thle liyiks between finance andi<br />
trade. They also noted the view of leading developed countries that exchange<br />
rates should better reflect fundamental conditions than, has been the case.<br />
They urged all countries, and particularly the major developed countries, to<br />
show greater concern for the repercussions of their policies on the<br />
developing countries. They recognised that the critical situation fads<br />
developing countries necessitated urgent action to improve the external<br />
onviromment higher growth and a rollback of protectionist measures<br />
espacially in industrial countries; loier interest rates; and significantly<br />
increased external assistance and foreign investment as well as continuing<br />
efforts to improve their domestic economies.<br />
52. Heads of Governmsent considered -the finel R prt of the Consultative<br />
Group on International Econmic Action, which they hd set up at their Now<br />
Delhi Meeting, and expressed appreciation of the Grop Is work. They noted<br />
its contribution to the holding of the special Springl~ ashington wnetings of<br />
the Development and interim COauittees in 198S. Heads of Government recalled<br />
the Statement on Economic Action which they had issued at New Delhi. They<br />
considered it important to develop an active dialogue on the functioning of<br />
the International monetary and financial systeu. In this context they noted<br />
that the Spring 41986 meetings of the Developwmnt and Interim Committees would<br />
provide an opportunity for in-depth examination of the relevnt issues, In<br />
the light of the reports by the Group of 10 developed countries and the Group<br />
of 24 developing cot. mtriez.<br />
Financial Flows<br />
53. Heads of Government noted the sericuo decline, roince thoy last met,<br />
in financial flows to developin countrieg. Thoro had boon a substantial<br />
fall In multilateral ofticial Tlaws, bank lon~ ing, foreiin inetmont cM~<br />
export credit, and stagnation in cencessional flows. Net flows of rewoircos<br />
to developing cotmtries as a % whole hzd boccae naative.<br />
54. Heads of Govermgent reviewed the developing country debt problem and<br />
acknowledged the continuing validity of the concern expressed in the Report<br />
of the Coumonwealth Expert Group on Debt. Despite action by bank.%,<br />
international financial institutions aMa governments to stabilise it, the<br />
situation rmeiried precarious. They welcomed the Report's detailed attention<br />
to the 5erious debt problems of many low-income developing coamtries, to<br />
which insufficient attention had been paid by the international comunity.<br />
Heads of Government emphasised the importance attached to the -ole<br />
of multilateral institutions in chaane111inZ resourcos to developin<br />
countries. They welcomed the growing consensus reflected at the SeOul<br />
meetings of the World Bank and the IMP on the need for these institutions to<br />
have a considerably enlarged role in supporting growth-oriented adjustaent.<br />
They noted the proposals of the United States Administration in this repard,<br />
and looked forward to early elaboration of the detailo. They called for a<br />
substantial general capital increase to peruit the World Bank to fulfil the<br />
larger role envisaged for it. In the case of the small island economies this<br />
role should, in the prevailing economic circumstances, include a reviGV of<br />
the graduation policy which has been progressivoly applied to those </p>
<p>economies. In relation to low-income countries it was crucial to secure a<br />
substantially Increased replenlishment for IDA 8, with strict respect for the<br />
timetable envisaged by the Development Co= ittee.<br />
56. HeadA of Government recognised the need for adjustment in countries<br />
drawing on Do resources. They also acknowledged that in many cases<br />
adjustment had to take place over a longer period, with conditionality<br />
appropriate to the circusgtances of the country concerned and the time period<br />
roquIrod. While closer co-ordination betwoon the I) 4P and the World Bank use<br />
necessary, there was growiln8 concern about cross-condittonalIty; they<br />
emphasised the value of the Secreturiat making a carefu study of this issue<br />
as requested by Finance Ministers. Heads of Government welcomed the<br />
reactivation of the IW Trust Fund and noted that Eurth9r resources would be<br />
required for structural adjustment lending on similar concossional terms to<br />
low-income countries. They applauded the decision of Irdta end China not to<br />
avail themselves of the Trust Fund, so permitting other low-income countries<br />
to benefit more from the limited resources available.<br />
57. They also emphasised the Fund's surveillance role, and in particular<br />
the need for strengthening the Fund's surveillance of the economic policies<br />
of ma) or industrialised countries. They agreed that a more equitable sharin<br />
the burden of adjustment should be one of the principal aims of<br />
multilateral surveillance.<br />
58. They endorsed the view of the World Bank's Task Force that<br />
concessional resources were gener3lly weli used and that an increaso in such<br />
flows was needed. They ur3ed donor countries to redouble their efforts to<br />
increase concessional flows in line with internationally asreed targets and<br />
as far as possible to give priority in the distribution of such additional<br />
aid to low-income countries, particularly the least developed. They also<br />
emphasised the vital importance of private capital, In: this connection they<br />
expressed appreciation of the Secretariat's practical ' ork in relation to<br />
capital markets and foreign investment.<br />
International Trade<br />
59. They noted with concern that the benefits of the recovery in world<br />
trade had not been uldely shared. Commodity prices had fallen, worsenin the<br />
terms of trade of many coamodity exporting countries. They regretted the<br />
lack of progress in the negotiation of international coiodity agreements and<br />
in establishing the Comnon Fund. They also called for improvd access to the<br />
IF's Compensatory Financing Facility to offset export earnings instabilit,.<br />
Heads of Government noted with serious concern chat, since they iast<br />
met in New Delhi, there had been an alarming increase in protectionist<br />
pressures, an Increase in trade barriers outside the GATT and a proliferation<br />
of discriminatory trade practices. Protectionism was a grave threat to world<br />
economic growth and resunption of progress on trade liberalisation was<br />
urgently needed. Heads of Government therefore affirmed the importance of a<br />
new round of multilateral trade negotiations in the GAT" in helping to<br />
restore confidence in the multilateral syeton and roverse protectionism.<br />
They noted the statement by the GT Contracting Parties that a preparatory<br />
process on the proposed new round of multilateral trade negotiations had now </p>
<p>been initiated and they looked forward to On early agreemont on an AMRc And<br />
timetable for the new round. They emphasised, however, that sustantive<br />
progress would occur only if the interests of all participants receive<br />
&amp; 4oquate attention, and there is respect for the principles enshrined in the<br />
Tokyo Round. They urged that the large amount of preparator technical work<br />
on new issues should not delay or prevent urgeintl neee proes on<br />
outstanding GATT mandates, notably those arising from the 1982 Ministerial<br />
Work Prograume.<br />
61. Heads of Government believed that consultations amorl Coinonwalth<br />
countries could assist their preparation for negotiations. They requested<br />
the Secretary-General to assist member governments, particularly those not<br />
permarently represented in Geneva, to prepare for their Oarticipation in the<br />
new round. With this in view, they asked him to give priority to ongoing<br />
work in this area and prepare a comprehensive paper an issues of concern to<br />
Comoir. alth governments.<br />
Sub-Saharan African Problems<br />
62. Heads of Government paid particular attention to the multiple<br />
problem faced by sub-Saharan African countries, very! many of whm were<br />

approach adopted by the Organisation of African Unity in the Declaration<br />
issued at its su~ it meeting in July. On internal policies, they noted the<br />
convergence of views, s reflectod in the S&amp; mit Declaration, and welcomed<br />
the determine measures already taken. They exprossod satisfaction with<br />
national and international reief efforts and noted that more favourable<br />
weather had eased the immiediate food crisis in many African countries. They<br />
eimphasised that the region's long-term problems could not be solved without<br />
the application of appropriate agricultural technolog and improved<br />
infrastructure. In add iti on, development of industrial andservice sectors,<br />
as well as moderation of population pressures, were of vital importance in<br />
the promotion of balcznced growth.<br />
63. Heads of Government noted that for domestic poicies to work it was<br />
neessary to create a more Eavourable external economic environment and to<br />
increws the inward flow of resources. They stressed the problem of<br />
sub-Saharan African Indebtedness, emphasising that it differed qualitatively<br />
from that of other regions. They cal led f or urgent consideration of measures<br />
to ease the debt burdens of countries in. sub-Saharan Africa. In this<br />
connnection, most Heads of Government endorsed the czll of the Organism ton<br />
of African Unity for a conference involving creditors, debtors and . he<br />
international financial institutions to consider measures to ease the burden$<br />
of these countries. As ain imuediate step they stressed the necessity * for<br />
additional concessional financing and increased flexibility in debt servicing<br />
Arrangements. 64. Heads of Government noted with special interest the Report, ' African<br />
Agriculture: Building for the Future', comp3iled by a Commonwealth Action<br />
Group, following a recommendation at the 1984 meeting of Commonweelth Senior<br />
Officials. They endorsed the conclusions and recommiendation~ s on the role the<br />
Comonwealth, and the Secretariat, could play in helping to Gs* tho<br />
constraints on -long-term development in Africa. They Qiabed the </p>
<p>Secretary-General to ensure that the Group's reccumendations are I lemeuted<br />
as 5sedily aS possble. They requested Couonwsith An ricultural inisters<br />
to follo0w up r Report at their Novemb~ er 198S meeting. They expressed<br />
appreciation at the speed with which the CMF had already responded to urgent<br />
requests for assistance and the greater emphasis it was giving to Africa and<br />
ariculture in its ope rations. They emphasised the useful consultative role<br />
te Secretariat could play in assisting project preparttion to speed upq the<br />
use of external. finance and in assisting agricultural policy development, In<br />
which it was asked to take due account of the role of women in agriculture.<br />
Poplstion and Deve1lpmnt<br />
Heads of Government noted the recommendations of the International<br />
Conference on Population in Mexico City in August 1984. They recognised the<br />
close but complex linkb between population growth, resources, the enivironment<br />
and living standards. They reiterated their continuiing fire * support for the<br />
agreed population progrraes of the United Nations and other multilateral<br />
organisations. They felt that the Commonwealth should co-oporate more<br />
actively with current national and international programes In this field.<br />
Drug Abusb and Illicit Traffickin<br />
66. Heads of Government were deeply concerned at t6e rig in incidence of<br />
drug abase and illicit drug traffickire that was seriously threatening the<br />
social fabric and security of many countries. They recognised that it called<br />
for a wide range of responses. includling urgent attention to problems. affecting<br />
young persons and to the rehabilitation of its victims. They agreed that<br />
governm~ ents should co-operate, both to counter the internation, 2l traffic in<br />
illicit drugs and to deny to those convicted of drug trafficking the proceeds<br />
of their crime and looked to the early implementation of a ibchem for<br />
enhanced co-operation between Com~ onvalth countries in'this regard.<br />
67. Heads of Government were also disturbed by the extent to which the<br />
profits made by drug traffickers were used In criminal and -subversive<br />
activities often across international borders. They invited Commonealth Law<br />
Ministers to explore measures to counter this trend. While supporting ale<br />
work of existin international organisations in the field of narcotics comtrol,<br />
Heads of Government welcomed the proposal of the United Nations<br />
Secretary -General for the convening of an international, conference at a high<br />
political level in 1987 to deal with all aspects of drug abuse and<br />
trafficking and expressed the hope that action would be. expedited on the<br />
related proposed now Convent ion.<br />

establishment of the Commonwealth Secretariat, Heads of Government expressed<br />
their ware comendation of the role of the Secretariat in service to the<br />
