<p>E&amp;OE............</p>
<p>  LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>  Well, Prime Minister John Howard joins us in the studio this morning. Good</p>
<p>   morning again.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Not quite talkback radio.</p>
<p>  LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>  Not quite, but.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  This will do.</p>
<p>  LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>  Should former prime ministers, all of them, follow the lead of American</p>
<p>   Presidents - when they leave the Oval Office at the White House they move</p>
<p>   into private life and stay out of the public arena?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Oh look, I don't think you can impose that kind of vow of silence on anybody.</p>
<p>   People are entitled to say what they think in this world. It's a democracy.</p>
<p>   But, equally, they have to have what they say analysed. And what Mr Keating</p>
<p>   said at the weekend was just plain wrong and demeaning and I think it a</p>
<p>   exhibited continuing inability on his part to come to terms with what happened</p>
<p>   to him three-and-a-half years ago.</p>
<p>  LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>  Are you personally offended by what he and Kim Beazley have had to say about</p>
<p>   your position on East Timor and your motives for that position, I mean,</p>
<p>   "domestic opportunism", "sabre rattling"?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, I totally reject it. I mean, I'm used to personal insults from Mr</p>
<p>   Keating and, to a lesser extent, Mr Beazley, but both of them are into it</p>
<p>   on this issue. Now, I thought Mr Beazley supported of the troop deployment.</p>
<p>   And I've tried to run a fairly bipartisan approach on this. I invited Mr</p>
<p>   Beazley and Senator Lees to go with me when we visited the troops. They</p>
<p>   were fully involved. I've offered him briefings. I can't understand this.</p>
<p>   A Prime Minister's meant to explain why governments do things. This is the</p>
<p>   biggest military operation Australia's been involved in since the Vietnam</p>
<p>   War. I mean, if I didn't go out there and explain to the Australian people</p>
<p>   why we're doing it I guess Mr Beazley and Mr Keating would criticise me</p>
<p>   for not telling the public enough. I think you've got to take the public</p>
<p>   with you on foreign policy issues. You can't just hand tablets down from</p>
<p>   the mountain. That was Mr Keating's approach. And he kept the security treaty</p>
<p>   with Indonesia secret until it had been concluded. He thought that was clever.</p>
<p>   I don't think the Australian people did. So, I just say to both of them,</p>
<p>   look, I've got an obligation to explain, to answer questions, to point out</p>
<p>   why, and I'm going to go on doing that. Bob Hawke did it in the Gulf War.</p>
<p>   He was on every radio station imaginable explaining why the Government was</p>
<p>   doing it. Because when you send young men and women overseas in the name</p>
<p>   of Australia it's a very serious thing and you've got an obligation to tell</p>
<p>   people why and also answer their questions and listen to their criticisms</p>
<p>   if they don't like it.</p>
<p>  LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>  Well then answer this question for me - how damaging is this apparent breakdown</p>
<p>   in a bipartisan approach to foreign policy on this particular issue?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, I prefer to take, at this stage, the charitable view that what Mr</p>
<p>   Beazley is doing is searching around for a point of political criticism</p>
<p>   without actually disagreeing with what we've done. Now, maybe I'm being</p>
<p>   charitable to him but I think in the national interest I'd prefer to believe</p>
<p>   that that was the situation because it doesn't help us, it doesn't help</p>
<p>   anybody for there to be a breakdown in bipartisanship. I had understood</p>
<p>   this deployment had their total support. Indeed, one of the criticisms of</p>
<p>   us earlier was that, quote, "we weren't doing enough" and now</p>
<p>   not only don't we need to explain that I'm allegedly trying to exploit it</p>
<p>   - look, I'm not trying to exploit anything. I haven't found the last few</p>
<p>   weeks easy. I don't think any of us have because it's a very serious issue.</p>
<p>   And the last thing I'm trying to do is score political points out of this.</p>
<p>   We're perfectly happy to have a go at the Labor Party on other domestic</p>
<p>   issues where there are strong differences of opinion but on something like</p>
<p>   this, I think, as far as possible, as we did with the Gulf War when we were</p>
<p>   in Opposition, you should try and stop the political backbiting and get</p>
<p>   behind it.</p>
<p>  LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>  I think in fairness to Kim Beazley, though, he's not questioning our deployment,</p>
<p>   the deployment of Australian troops to lead the peacekeeping force.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, as I said a moment ago, I'm trying, I mean, I'm taking that view.</p>
<p>   You asked me about the breakdown and I said I'd prefer to take the view</p>
<p>   that he still supports the deployment but he's trying to, sort of, score</p>
<p>   a political point off me. Well, I mean, I suppose he feels he has to do</p>
<p>   that but it's pretty thin. I mean, what's his criticism, that I've explained</p>
<p>   it to the Australian people. He talks about locking in support from overseas.</p>
<p>   We've got a dozen countries committed. Only a few days ago I was on the</p>
<p>   phone to the Canadian Prime Minister talking about Canada's commitment.</p>
<p>   Canada announced the commitment of a reinforced infantry company. Ten days</p>
<p>   ago or so I was on the phone to the Japanese Prime Minister. I mean, I have</p>
<p>   personally spoken to the leaders of probably a dozen countries over the</p>
<p>   last few weeks. We're constantly on the ball doing that. But you can, you</p>
<p>   know, walk and chew gum at the same time. You can lock people in but also</p>
<p>   go out and explain to your own people, which is your obligation, why we're</p>
<p>   doing it.</p>
<p>  LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>  Could the Whitlam, Fraser, Hawke and Keating administrations have done more</p>
<p>   for East Timor? I mean, Keating is saying, Paul Keating is saying no and</p>
<p>   Kim Beazley has defended Labor's record on East Timor.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, let me quote Laurie Brereton. Laurie Brereton says yes. Now, I mean,</p>
<p>   everybody can take their own pick. And there's a limit to how much you should</p>
<p>   rake over the coals of the past but there's no doubt that what we have done</p>
<p>   in relation to East Timor is a departure from the approach of former governments.</p>
<p>   Now, circumstances are different. I accept that. The important thing is</p>
<p>   whether it is right, not who's done it. And it is right and it does have</p>
<p>   a lot of support in the Australian community because it's right and it's</p>
<p>   in our national interests that we do so.</p>
<p>  LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>  Is Paul Keating too close to Indonesia, was he, is he and is he too close</p>
<p>   to be impartial and objective on an issue like this?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  He was certainly, in my view, obsessed with the relationship between the</p>
<p>   two countries and quite obsessed with the personal character of the relationship</p>
<p>   between himself and the former President.</p>
<p>  LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>  Although in fairness, one must say it wasn't until recently that your party</p>
<p>   changed its attitude on East Timor.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Yes, but we didn't invest quite the same degree of, sort of, ultra reliance</p>
<p>   on the relationship that I believe Mr Keating did. But, look, that is in</p>
<p>   our past. I think the reaction of most Australians was, well look, they</p>
<p>   felt as though they were hearing old battles. I mean, that was just, that</p>
<p>   was a flashback to the 1996 election campaign. It's now 1999.</p>
<p>  LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>  Okay, well let's talk about 1999. How close is Jakarta to breaking diplomatic</p>
<p>   relations with Australia? Laurie Brereton says close.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  I don't believe diplomatic relations will be broken. I hope they won't be</p>
<p>   and there's no need because we have no long-term quarrel with the people</p>
<p>   of Indonesia. We've been a good friend of Indonesia's over the years, not</p>
<p>   an uncritical friend but a good friend. And I don't think the sensible people</p>
<p>   in Jakarta, from the President down, want relations broken and I would say</p>
<p>   to those who are advocating it that that's not in the interests of Indonesia.</p>
<p>   We need to live with each other. We have to live next to each other on a</p>
<p>   basis of mutual respect. The relationship has got to be realistic. You can't</p>
<p>   invest too much in it but you shouldn't lightly put it aside. And I think</p>
<p>   people who talk about breaking the relationship are really advocating that.</p>
<p>   LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>  The National Security Sub-Committee meets today, is it going to give John</p>
<p>   Moore the green light for a morale-boosting trip to East Timor to visit</p>
<p>   the troops?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, we meet on a regular basis but I don't think that will be the major</p>
<p>   thing we're looking at. We just get regular reports on what happens. Look,</p>
<p>   that's something that will be dealt with in the normal way at the right</p>
<p>   time.</p>
<p>  LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>  Would you like to go before he does?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Oh look, it's not a question of who wants to go first. It's just a question</p>
<p>   of doing what is the right thing by the men and women there. I mean, I will</p>
<p>   be advised in relation to all of those matters by the people on the ground</p>
<p>   and by the Australian Defence Forces. I'm following a very strict rule in</p>
<p>   relation to this issue, I don't get involved in operational comments. That's</p>
<p>   not fair to General Cosgrove or to Admiral Barrie. They have a remit from</p>
<p>   the UN. They are there in the name of our country and I want to respect</p>
<p>   their role and to give them their due as in our system the political decisions</p>
<p>   are taken by us.</p>
<p>  LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>  Let me ask you a question Paul Keating directed to you in that speech at</p>
<p>   the weekend in Sydney, and presumably is still waiting for an answer - does</p>
<p>   your Government now support ethnic self-determination anywhere?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Ethnic self-determination anywhere - no, we're not arguing that at all.</p>
<p>   That's not the issue here. This is not ethnic self-determination. It's a</p>
<p>   question of whether people who've, in a properly supervised ballot under</p>
<p>   the aegis of the United Nations, have voted 80 percent for independence,</p>
<p>   whether they ought to have it. I mean, for Mr Keating to drag ethnic self-determination</p>
<p>   into this is to distort the issue and to create a goal that we're not necessarily</p>
<p>   seeking or advocating. You look at each situation on its merits. And on</p>
<p>   the merits, these people are entitled to have what they voted for. I mean,</p>
<p>   80 percent, in anybody's language, is a big majority. I mean, even the New</p>
<p>   South Wales' right would have to admit that if the other side got 80 percent</p>
<p>   they'd have to surrender power.</p>
<p>  LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>  Final question - when does self-defence become hot pursuit?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, it's a very technical argument and I'm not going to get into it because</p>
<p>   when.this thing's been raised before. I think unfair comments have been</p>
<p>   made about the person who gave the answer. It's a technical issue. I think</p>
<p>   General Cosgrove put it very well.</p>
<p>  LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>  Thanks for your time.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Pleasure.</p>
<p>  [Ends]</p>
