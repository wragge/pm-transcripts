    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Geelong and Corangamite region is the first to benefit with the Turnbull Government announcing funding for the first wave of successful projects under the Regional Jobs and Investment Packages.</p>
<p>The initiative is part of the Australian Government’s commitment to stimulate jobs and drive economic growth in Australia’s regions.</p>
<p>After an extensive assessment process involving strong community input, 21 projects totalling $20 million will be delivered in Geelong and Corangamite region, providing residents with a range of employment and investment opportunities.</p>
<p>More than 600 new jobs will be generated through the construction phase and a further 600 ongoing jobs will be created, with just over 200 of those ongoing jobs in advanced manufacturing.</p>
<p>The Coalition is committed to supporting regional Australia and as part of that commitment it is essential we help regions such as Geelong and Corangamite unlock their potential by investing in key projects that support their economic future.</p>
<p>This $220 million pilot programme, being rolled out in 10 regional locations across the nation, has been designed to diversify regional economies - particularly those that have undergone large structural changes - to help drive economic growth and job creation in these communities.</p>
<p>The 21 organisations set to benefit from today’s announcement highlight both the innovation and future business prowess of the region.</p>
<p>A range of projects will be delivered through this package including Australia’s first commercial carbon fibre manufacturing facility, which will help drive regional innovation.</p>
<p>Projects also include the delivery of an ecotourism facility on the Great Ocean Road, a new additive manufacturing and engineering centre at Geelong’s innovation precinct, and further investment in Geelong’s Waterfront – all of which will provide jobs and support the region for years to come.</p>
