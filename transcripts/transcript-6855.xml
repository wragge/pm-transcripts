TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW ON 7.30 REPORT 5 MARCH 1986<br />
SINGLETON: Today the Hawke Government turned three years old. it<br />
is not surprising perhaps that most Australians are very divided<br />
on the Hawke brand of Labor politics. Depending on your point of<br />
view, Bob Hawke has either abandoned Labor's tradition roots or<br />
he is the most brilliant politician since Robert Menzies. Well<br />
Bob Hawke is speaking with Pru Goward in Canberra.<br />
GOWARD: Mr Hawke, looking back over the three years Labor<br />
started with a commitment to national land rights. It now seems<br />
to be settling for anything that the States.. will accept which.<br />
gives Aborigines in each of those States some land. Now do you<br />
described that as a necessary sacrifice of principle, party<br />
principle for the sake of being a pragmatic government?<br />
PM: No I don't describe that way.<br />
GOWARD: How would you describe it?<br />
PM: Well, what I said at the Press Club again today, I think, is<br />
the appropriate response. It is the case, that for a range of<br />
reasons, Australians seem to have a different attitude now than<br />
they had in 1967 when they, by massive votes, gave powers to the<br />
Federal Government in this area. Now any government has to<br />
operate reasonably within touch of prevailing attitudes. It<br />
cannot go away beyond them. Now what we have been able to do<br />
through negotiations with the western Australian Government for<br />
instance is to bring about a situation where there will be secure<br />
tenure for Aboriginal people over a significant area of land in<br />
Western Australian. The Western Australian Government has agreed<br />
to that. We in turn will be putting with the Western Australian<br />
Government in to providing infrastructure to provide better<br />
facilities for Aboriginal people. Now Mr Holding has assured me<br />
that in respect of other States the negotiations are moving<br />
towards producing a situation which is the objective of the land<br />
rights situation, that is secure tenure for Aboriginal people in<br />
regard to land with which they have a traditional association.<br />
GOWARD: Mr Hawke, there are people on your back bench who are<br />
unhappy with anything less than national land rights<br />
legislation and there are obviously Ministers of your own who are<br />
unhappy with these Budget negotiations. Is that evidence of<br />
serious philosophical differences within the party which you will<br />
have to really fight to contain this year? </p>
<p>2<br />
PM: 140.<br />
GOWARD: Mr Hawke, surely the leaks and counterleaks from<br />
Ministers this week over the Budget are some indication of the<br />
seriousness of the cuts you are having to contemplate?<br />
PM: Well, I don't think that follows as a matter of logic. As<br />
you heard people say at the National Press Club today, leaks have<br />
been a feature of political life for a very, very long period.<br />
They are certainly not unique to this Government. And as I said<br />
at the Press Club I am proud of the fact that my ministers in the<br />
areas of welfare are going to fight as hard as they can to try<br />
and protect the people, the interests of people they represent.<br />
That is what their job is. I wouldn't respect them if they didn't<br />
do it. we will get the right outcome.<br />
GOWARD: Mr Hawke, just finally looking at the problems in the<br />
bush. What do you think your talks in the United States over the<br />
export enhancement program could realistically achieve for<br />
Au st ral1ian s?<br />
PM: There are going to be two parts to the talks. one is<br />
concerned with the export enhancement program Pru, and I believe<br />
on the indications that we have that the President and his<br />
administ-ra-tion share completely our view that this program should..---~<br />
not operate in a way which would be to the detriment of<br />
Australian producers. And so I hope that we will be able together<br />
to, and in discussions with correct congressional leaders, to<br />
ensure the sort of protection to which our Australian rural<br />
producer are entitled. The second part of our talks will be<br />
concerned with trying to ensure that, in the summit meeting that<br />
is going to be held in Tokyo in the near future of the seven,<br />
that President Reagan will take into those talks a strong<br />
position in regard to international trade particularly in regard<br />
to rural commodities.<br />
GOWARD: But Australian farmers really are pretty small fry<br />
compared with the competing interests of the United States and<br />
the EEC?<br />
PM: No I don't accept that. The United States attitude towards<br />
Australia reflects a number of concerns and not just as a<br />
comparative judgment between the position of their own farmers<br />
and their fight with the European Community. Their relationship<br />
with Australia is important in a whole range of areas including<br />
international relations, security considerations. And I don't<br />
believe that they want in any way to prejudice the relationship.<br />
GOWARD: Mr Hawke, just finally on BHP. Are you confident that a<br />
ministerial inquiry will clear the way for BHP to change hands if<br />
that is what the market wishes<br />
PM: No that is not the way it sees it we will clear the way. I<br />
from the beginning have been totally consistent about this. I<br />
have never used the word public inquiry by the way. If you just<br />
watch...... GOWARD: Ministerial inquiry. </p>
<p>PM: No. There is some suggestion that I have changed position. I<br />
am simply saying that I have said at all points what needs to be<br />
done and that is what is going to be done. That is that the<br />
Government is going to monitor and look at those questions which<br />
really directly involve the public interest including<br />
particularly the viability and integrity of the steel industry.<br />
Now I and my Ministers will be talking to both BHP and Mr<br />
Holmes-a-Court to secure guarantees and undertakings about these<br />
issues of the public interest. If we are satisfied that those<br />
interest are protected then, I believe, it is a matter for the<br />
market. GOWARD: And by public interest do you merely mean the bounties<br />
and subsidies<br />
PM: I don't merely mean that. I mean a commitment to continued<br />
investment in the steel industry, a commitment to the<br />
continuation of the steel industry in its existing locations, a<br />
commitment to expand the steel industry to take advantage of the<br />
opportunities that have been created by our steel industry plan<br />
which have transformed the Australian steel industry from one<br />
which in 1982 was going to be closed down to one where in which<br />
now the productivity of the steel industry has been doubled,<br />
where instead of-boe-ing struggling,--perhaps not going to survive,<br />
it is export competitive oriented. We are going to ensure that<br />
that's maintained.<br />
GOWARD: And you don't think that concern with that sort of<br />
public interest might make share markets and international<br />
finance markets a bit uneasy?<br />
PM: On the contrary, I would think that any sensible judgment by<br />
the markets and by international finance would welcome a<br />
determination on the part of the Australian Government to see<br />
that there was going to be retained within Australia a strong<br />
viable competitive export oriented steel industry.<br />
GOWARD: Mr Hawke, thank you.<br />
PM: Thank you Pru.<br />
