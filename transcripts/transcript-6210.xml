PRIME MINISTER<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
CONFERENCE ON TECHNOLOGY<br />
26 SEPTEMBER 1983 CANBERRA<br />
BARRY JONES' INITIATIVE IN PROMOTING THIS<br />
CONFERENCE STEMMED FROM A KEEN APPRECIATION OF THE<br />
CONTRIBUTION THAT TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION MIGHT MAKE TO THE<br />
FUTURE GROWTH OF THE AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY. BARRY'S ROLE,<br />
INCLUDING THROUGH HIS WELL-KNOWN PUBLICATION SLEEPERS WAKE,<br />
IN STIMULATING COMMUNITY AWARENESS AND UNDERSTANDING OF THE<br />
COMPLICATIONS OF TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE HAS BEEN OF<br />
CONSIDERABLE IMPORTANCETHE<br />
LABOR GOVERNMENT WAS ELECTED'TO GET AUSTRALIA<br />
MOVING AGAIN : TO STEM AND THEN TO REV ERSE THE DECLINE IN<br />
EMPLOYMENT; TO RAISE THE LIVING STANDARDS OF AUSTRALIANS;<br />
AND TO RE* S-TORE AUSTRALIANS' SENSE OF : JERN . AT. ION AS A FAIR<br />
SOCIETY IN WHICH THE FRUITS OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY ARE<br />
DISTRIBUTED EQUITABLYTHESE GREAT COMMITMENTS CAN BE FULFILLED ONLY<br />
THROUGH STRONG AND STEADY ECONOMIC GROWTH OVER LONG PERIODSSUSTAINED<br />
ECONOMIC GROWTH IS GOING TO REQUIRE THE<br />
PROGRESSIVE ADOPTION OF PRODUCTIVE NEW TECHNOLOGIES,<br />
STRUCTURAL CHANGE IN THE ECONOMY, AND HIGH LEVELS OF<br />
INVESTMENT FROM HOME AND ABROAD-</p>
<p>2.<br />
SUSTAINED ECONOMIC GROWTH WILL PROVIDE THE MEANS OF<br />
ASSISTING AUSTRALIANS IN NEED, THROUGH THE GRADUAL<br />
DESTRUCTION OF THE SCOURGE OF UNEMPLOYMENT, AND THROUGH<br />
ADEQUATE AND EFFICIENT SOCIAL WELFARE POLICIES.<br />
AND THE RESTORATION OF AUSTRALIA AS A SOCIETY THAT<br />
IS BROADLY UNITED AROUND THE GREAT NATIONAL GOAL OF<br />
PROVIDING ADEQUATELY FOR ALL CITIZENS IS NECESSARY IF<br />
AUSTRALIANS ARE TO ACCEPT THE CHANGE AND THE STRESS<br />
ASSOCIATED WITH RAPID ECONOMIC GROWTH AND TECHNOLOGICAL<br />
INNOVATION. THUS OUR COMMITMENTS TO TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE, TO<br />
ECONOMIC GROWTH AND TO THE EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION OF THE<br />
BENEFITS OF GROWTH ARE PART OF THE ONE GREAT PROGRAMME OF<br />
NATIONAL ECONOMIC RECOVERY.<br />
YOUR SPECIAL CONCERN HERE TODAY, TECHNOLOGY, IS OF<br />
CENTRAL IMPORTANCE TO THAT PROGRAMMETHE<br />
EFFECTIVENESS WITH WHICH WE APPLY NEW<br />
TECHNOLOGY NEW TECHNOLOGY FROM ABROAD AS WELL AS NEW<br />
TECHNOLOGY WHICH WE DEVELOP OURSELVES WILL DETERMINE THE<br />
EFFICIENCY OF OUR INDUSTRY, ITS COMPETITIVE PERFORMANCE AND<br />
ITS CAPACITY TO GROW. / 3 </p>
<p>THE EFFECTIVENESS WITH WHICH WE USE NEW TECHNOLOGY<br />
WILL DETERMINE WHETHER WE CAN REVERSE THE LONG DOWNWARD<br />
SLIDE IN OUR LIVING STANDARDS RELATIVE TO OTHER COUNTRIESFROM<br />
ONE OF THE HIGHEST PER CAPITA INCOMES IN THE WORLD<br />
THIRTY YEARS AGO, TO ONE OF THE LOWEST OF THE INDUSTRIAL<br />
COUNTRIES WHEN MY GOVERNMENT TOOK OFFICE SIX MONTHS AGOOUR<br />
WORK PATTERNS AND INDUSTRIAL STRUCTURES WILL<br />
NEED TO CHANGE IN RESPONSE TO NEW CHALLENGES AND<br />
OPPORTUNITIES-CYCLICAL FACTORS RELATED TO RECESSION<br />
ABROAD, AND COINCIDENCE OF BAD LUCK AND BAD MANAGEMENT AT<br />
HOME IN THE PERIOD PRECEEDING my GOVERNMENT'S ELECTION TO<br />
OFFICE, EXPLAIN PART OF OUR CURRENT ECONOMIC DIFFICULTIESBUT<br />
PART OF OUR DIFFICULTIES IS STRUCTURAL, REFLECTING THE<br />
ENTRENCHMENT OF LOW PRODUCTIVITY AND INAPPROPRIATE<br />
PRODUCTION PATTERNS IN MANY PARTS OF OUR ECONOMYTHE<br />
DEVELOPMENT AND APPLICATION OF NEW TECHNOLOGY<br />
MUST BE EMBRACED AS ONE OF THE DRIVING FORCES BEHIND THE<br />
PROC7.3S OF ECONOMIC CHANGE WITH IMPORTANT CONSEQUENCES FO;'\<br />
THE COMPETITIVENESS OF INDUSTRIES. THERE'IS NO ESCAPING THE<br />
FACT THAT INDUSTRIAL INNOVATION IS ESSENTIAL To AUSTRALIA'S<br />
FUTURE ECONOMIC WELL-BEING, NOT ONLY IN INDUSTRIES PRODUCING<br />
GLAMOROUS NEW PRODUCTS, BUT THROUGHOUT ESTABLISHED<br />
INDUSTRIES As WELLiu i e/ 4. </p>
<p>CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY OVER TIME WILL PLACE<br />
PRESSURES ON SOME INDUSTRIES TO CONTRACT WHILE PROVIDING NEW<br />
OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE EXPANSION OF OTHERS-THE COST OF<br />
ADJUSTMENT IN SOME CASES IMAY BE CONSIDERABLE. THE COMMUNITY<br />
AND NOT JUST THOSE AT THE FACE OF CHANGE MUST BE PREPARED TO<br />
BEAR PART OF THE BURDENTHERE<br />
IS A GROWING AWARENESS IN AUSTRALIA THAT OUR<br />
MAJOR COMPETITORS, ESPECIALLY THOSE WITHIN OUR OWN REGION,<br />
ARE UNDERTAKING NEW LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS, ADOPTING NEW<br />
BUSINESS STRATEGIES AND APPLYING NEW TECHNOLOGY-OUR<br />
LOCATION IN THE MOST DYNAMIC, FORWARD-LOOKING PART OF THE<br />
WORLD IMPOSES ON OUR INDUSTRIES A NEED TO DEVELOP NEW<br />
TECHNOLOGIES -NEW PRODUCTS AND PROCESSES IF WE ARE TO<br />
COMPETE EFFECTIVELY. RAPID GROWTH OF OUR TRADING PARTNERS<br />
WILL PROVIDE MANY MARKET OPPORTUNITIES FOR FUTURE<br />
EXPLOITATION IF WE CAN IMPROVE OUR COMPETITIVE PERFORMANCE.<br />
WHILE THE CHALLENGES ARE GREAT, AUSTRALIANS NEED<br />
NOT BE DAUNTED OR SEEK TO AVOID THEM. IN FACT, AUSTRALIA IS<br />
BETTER PLACED THAN MANY AUSTRALIANS APPRECIATE. WHILE THERE<br />
IS'PLENTY OF ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT OF OUR EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM<br />
AND RESEARCH ESTABLISHMENT, THEY ARE MUCH HIGHER IN QUALITY<br />
THAN IN MOST COUNTRIES WITHIN OUR REGION AND REASONABLY GOOD<br />
BY THE STANDARDS o? INDUSTRIAL COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLDIT<br />
IS AN ADVANTAGE THAT OUR CHILDREN GROW UP SPEAKING </p>
<p>ENGLISH, THE LANGUAGE OF MODERN TECHNOLOGY-IN COMBINATION<br />
WITH OUR STRONG RESOURCE BASE THESE HUMAN RESOURCES SHOULD<br />
ENABLE AUSTRALIA TO MOVE FLEXIBLY AND EFFECTIVELY TO TAKE<br />
ADVANTAGE OF THE EMERGING OPPORTUNITIES. MANY OF THE<br />
TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVAT IONS NOW INr THE PI PEL INE F IT IN WELL<br />
WITH EXISTING AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRY STRUCTURES AND FACTOR<br />
ENDOWMENTS-OUR COMBINATION OF RESOURCE ENDOWMENTS IS VERY<br />
DIFFERENT FROM THOSE OF OTHER COUNTRIES AND OFFER THE BASIS<br />
UPON WHICH AUSTRALIA SHOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE A DISTINCTIVE<br />
CONTRIBUTION-WHETHER WE CAN REALISE THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS<br />
OF OUR SITUATION DEPENDS IN PART ON OUR DEALING EFFECTIVELY<br />
WITH SIGNIFICANT INSTITUTIONAL RESISTANCES TO CHANGECONCERN<br />
ABOUT NEW TECHNOLOGY INCREASING<br />
UNEMPLOYMENT IS OBVIOUSLY AMONG THE MOST IMPORTANT<br />
CONSIDERATIONS IN THIS REGARD-INNOVATION OFTEN LEADS TO<br />
DIRECT DISPLACEMENT OF LABOUR AT THE POINT WHERE TECHNOLOGY<br />
IS INTRODUCED. THIS IS ESPECIALLY THE CASE IF TECHNOLOGICAL<br />
CHANGE, RATHER THAN INTRODUCING PRODUCTS AND CREATING<br />
ENTIRELY NEW INDUSTRIAL BASES, INSTEAD IS GEARED SIMPLY TO<br />
IMPROVING THE PROCESS OF MANUFACTURING AND THEREBY TO<br />
CUTTING COSTSOVER THE LONGER TERM TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE IS GOING<br />

EMPHASIS ON EMPLOYMENT, SOCIAL SECURITY AND POLICIES<br />
DIRECTED AT EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION MORE GENERALLY, THE<br />
IMPROVED ECONOMIC CLIMATE WILL INCREASE THE FUNDS AVAILABLE<br />
FROM PROFITS FOR PRODUCT AND PROCESS INNO-VATION. THE LABOR<br />
GOVERNMENT'S POLICIES WILL FURTHER ENCOURAGE THE USE OF<br />
PROFITS FOR TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENT. AND THE 1983-84<br />
BUDGET DIRECTLY INCREASES THE FLOW OF FUNDS TO SCIENCE AND<br />
TECH NO LOGYWE NEED NOT AWAIT THE FULL REALISATION OF NATIONAL<br />
ECONOMIC RECOVERY BEFORE INTRODUCING IMIPROVED TECHNOLOGYCOUNTRIES<br />
WHICH APPEAR TO HAVE HANDLED THE RECESSION BEST,<br />
BOTH WITHIN OUR OWN REGION AND ELSEWHERE, HAVE USED NEW<br />
TECHNOLOGY TO MAKE THEIR EXISTING INDUSTRIES AS EFFICIENT AS<br />
POSSIBLE. , THEY HAVE ENCOURAGED A HIGH LEVEL OF RESEARCH AND<br />
DEVELOPMENT SO AS TO GENERATE NEW GOODS AND SERVICES, AND<br />
HAVE MADE A MAJOR INVESTMENT IN THEIR EDUCATION AND RESEARCH<br />
SYSTEMS-. S </p>
<p>OUR SUCCESS IN USING NEW TECHNOLOGY WILL DEPEND ON<br />
THE QUALITY OF OUR GENERAL EDUCAT ION SYSTEM, AND RESEARCH<br />
SYSTEMS, AND OF OUR CAPACITY AS A SOCIETY TO MANAGE<br />
STRUCTURAL AND TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE IN A WAY THAT PLACES THE<br />
LEAST POSSIBLE STRESS ON INDIVIDUALS AFFECTED BY IT-WE<br />
MUST WORK TO ENSURE THAT H IGH STANDARDS OF A BASIC EDUCAT ION<br />
ARE MAINTAINED WHILE WE INCREASE PARTICIPATION RATES-WE<br />
MUST LINK OUR EFFORTS IN TRAINI NG AND RETRAIN ING TO THE<br />
DEVELOPMENT OF CONSULTATIVE PROCESSES FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION<br />
OF CHANGE. AND WE MUST MAINTAIN HIGH SCIENTIFIC STANDARDS<br />
IN OUR RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS WHILE INCREASING THEIR<br />
INTERACTION WITH AND RELEVANCE TO INDUSTRY. THESE ARE<br />
THEMES THAT I PROPOSE DEVELOPING IN MORE DETAIL IN MY<br />
ADDRESS TO THE AUSTRALIAN COMPUTER CONFERENCE LATER TODAYIN<br />
THE FINAL ANALYSIS THE SUCCESS WITH WHICH<br />
AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRY UTILISES TECHNOLOGY TO HEIGHTEN<br />
COMPETITIVENESS WILL DEPEND ON THE ABILITY OF THE WORKFORCE<br />
TO ADAPT TO, AND WORK EFFICIENTLY WITH, THE NEW TECHNOLOGIES<br />
BEING INTRODUCED. TRAINING OF THE WORKFOiLCE TO MAXIMISE THE<br />
BENEFITS OF MORE SOPHISTICATED CAPITAL PROCESSES IS<br />
CRITICAL-IT IS IMPORTANT TO PLAN FOR THE CREATION OF A<br />
BASE OF SKILLS ACROSS THE WHOLE WORKFORCE THROUGH THE<br />
GENERAL EDUCATION SYSTEM, AND ALSO TO ENSURE THE ADEQUATE<br />
RETRAINING OF THE EXISTING WORKFORCE TO HANDLE NEW<br />
TECHNOLOGIES MORE CAPABLY-./ 11 </p>

DURING THE 1970' S ALMOST TWO-THIRDS OF THE GROWTH<br />
OF FEMALE EMPLOYMENT CONSISTED OF PART-TIME JOBS WITH ALL<br />
THE DISADVANTAGES NORMALLY ASSOCIATED WITH PART-TIME AND<br />
CASUAL EMPLOYMENT: POOR CONDITIONS AND THE REALITY OF<br />
LOW-SKILLED ACTIVITY, WITH FEW CAREER OPENINGS, W'OMEN HAVE<br />
ALSO BEEN CONCENTRATED IN " tTRADITIONALLY FEMALE" i ACITIVITIES;<br />
CLERICAL AND SALES AND SERVICE OCCUPATIONS STILL ACCOUNT FOR<br />
OVER 60 PER CENT OF THE FEMALE WORKFORCE IN AUSTRALIA, OUR<br />
EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM IS TENDING TO PERPETUATE THESE TRENDS,<br />
LESS THAN 30 PER CENT OF LAW AND MATHEMATICS GRADUATES ARE<br />
FEMALE AND THE PROPORTION IS LESS THAN 2 PER CENT AMONG<br />
ENGINEERING GRADUATES. WOMEN ARE ALSO SHOULDERING A<br />
DISPROPORTIONATE BURDEN OF UNEMPLOYMENT AND RECEIVE<br />
SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER INCOMES ON AVERAGE THAN DO MALES,<br />
W1HAT WILL BE THE LIKELY IMPACT OF TECHNOLOGICAL<br />
CHANGE ON THE SOCIO-ECONOMIC POSITION OF WOMEN WORKERS?<br />
IN ALL PROBABILITY THEY WILL BE AMONG THE MOST SERIOUSLY<br />
DISADVANTAGED IF TECHNOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENTS ARE EFFECTED IN<br />
THE ABSENCE OF AN APPROPRIATE POLICY FRAMEWORK,<br />
THE I, L. 0, HAS CONCLUDED'T* HAT. IT IS NOW NOT APPROPRIATE<br />
TO TALK ABOUT THE LABOUR MARKET IN A GENERAL SENSE, WE NOW<br />
HAVE A SITUATION THE I. L. 0, DESCRIBES IN TERMS OF A PRIMARY<br />
AND SECONDARY LABOUR MARKET, THE FORMER IS CHARACTERISED<br />
BY HIGH STATUS, STABLE EMPLOYMENT, HICH SKILL REQUIREMENTS,<br />
HIGH EARNINGS AND GOOD PROSPECTS FOR ADVANCEMENT, THE LATTER<br />
DISPLAYS THE OPPOSITE TRAITS LOW STATUS, HIGH _/ 13 </p>
<p>TURNOVER AND EMPLOYMENT INSTABILITY, LOW SKILL REQUIREMENTS,<br />
LOW EARNINGS AND FEW ADVANCEMENT OPPORTUNITIES. IN THIS<br />
DUAL LABOUR MARKET WOMEN DOMINATE THE SECONDARY IMARKFT,<br />
UNLESS RADICAL CHANGES ARE CONSCIOUSLY SOUGHT IN<br />
THE TRADITIONAL LABOUR MARKET POSITION OF WOMEN, THE ENTRY<br />
AND ADVANCEMENT POSSIBILITIES OF WOMEN TO THE NEW<br />
TECHNOLOGICAL ELITE AMONG THE WORKING PROPULATION WILL BE<br />
CONSIDERABLY RESTRICTED. RELATIVELY FEW WOMEN ARE QUALIFIED<br />
TO PROCEED INTO JOBS THE NEW TECHNOLOGY IS CREATING OR INTO<br />
TERTIARY STUDIES THAT MAY LEAD TO THE HIGHER TECHNOLOGICAL<br />
JOBS.-IT IS AN IMPORTANT RESPONSIBILITY OF GOVERNMENTS TO<br />
ENSURE THAT THE ADJUSTMENT BURDEN ASSOCIATED WITH THE IMPACT<br />
OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES IS AS FAR AS POSSIBLE EQUITABLY BORNE BY<br />
ALL GROUPS IN THE LABOUR MARKET, JUST AS IT SHOULD BE TO<br />
ENSURE GREATER EQUITY IN ACCESS TO EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES<br />
RESULTING FROM NEW TECHNOLOGIES.<br />
THE PROBLEMS OF DISADVANTAGED GROUPS HOWEVER GO<br />
DEEPER THAN THE ADEQUACY OR INADEQUACY OF POLICIES DEVELOPED<br />
TO MEET-THEIR PARTICULAR NEEDS. THEIR SITUATION UNDERLINES<br />
THE NECESSITY OF BUILDING A COMMUNITY CONSENSUS AROUND HOW<br />
WE MIGHT BEST MOVE TO MEET THE RAPIDLY CHANGING DEMANDS OF A<br />
HIGHLY COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT. </p>
<p>THE BEST WAY TO MAXIMISE THE POSITIVE SOCIAL<br />
EFFECTS OF NEW TECHNOLOGY, AND TO REDUCE THE NEGATIVE, IS<br />
THROUGH THE FULL PARTICIPATION OF ALL CONCERNED IN<br />
DELIBERATIONS ON HOW THE NEW TECHNOLOGY IS INTRODUCED. A<br />
COMMON THREAD RUNNING THROUGH THE EXPERIENCE Or' THOSE<br />
COUNTRIES MOST SUCCESSFUL IN HANDLING THE INTRODUCTION OF<br />
MODERN TECHNOLOGIES HAS BEEN THE WILLINGNESS OF THE SOCIAL<br />
PARTNERS OF GOVERNMENT, UNIONS AND EMPLOYERS TO CONSULT<br />
WITH EACH OTHER AT THE NATIONAL, INDUSTRY AND ENTERPRISE<br />
LEVEL AND TO ANTICIPATE AND RESOLVE PROBLEMS WHICH SEEM TO<br />
BE OF CONCERNTHIS WILL SOMETIMES BE AN AREA IN WHICH INVESTMENT<br />
IN CO-OPERATION AND SOCIAL HARMONY, AT SOME ECONOMIC COST<br />
IN THE SHORT TERM, YIELDS HIGH ECONOMIC AS WELL AS SOCIAL<br />
RETURNS IN THE LONG-TERM-IT CAN MAKE SUSTAINED ECONOMIC<br />
GROWTH POSSIBLE, WHEN IT WOULD OTHERWISE BE FACED BY<br />
INCREASINGLY STRONG SOCIAL AND POLITICAL RESISTANCES. JAPAN<br />
PROVIDES A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THIS-JAPAN'S<br />
INSTITUTIONALISATION OF CONSULTATION BETWEENi GOVERNMENT,<br />
UNIONS AND EMPLOYERS HAS BEEN AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN ITS<br />
ABILITY TO CAPITALISE ON THE BENEFITS OF TECHNOLOGICAL<br />
CHANGE-. s i1/ 15 </p>
<p>THE STEEL INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE PACKAGE OFFERS AN<br />
LAAMPLE OF HOW WE SHOULD AIM TO PROCEED. THERE AN<br />
INTEGRATED APPROACH WAS ADOPTED AFTER AN EXTENSIVE PROCESS<br />
OF CONSULTATION WITH ALL PARTIES. THERE WAS A RECOGNITION<br />
THAr NOT ALL JOBS COULD BE RETAI NED, BUT AT THE SAME TIME<br />
THE INDUSTRY ACKNOWLEDGED THE NEED TO ENHANCE ITS<br />
COMPETITIVE POSITION THROUGH INVESTMENT IN NEW TECHNOLOGIESALONGSIDE<br />
OUR EFFORTS THROUGH EDUCATION AND<br />
TRAINING, AND OTHER MEANS OF INCREASING AUSTRALIANS'<br />
CAPACITY TO MAKE USE OF OPPORTUNITIES PROVIDED BY NEW<br />
TECHNOLOGY, AND THROUGH CONSULTATIVE PROCESSES AND OTHER<br />
MEANS OF MAKING RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE ACCEPTABLE TO<br />
AUSTRALIANS, IT IS IMPORTANT THAT AUSTRALIA MAKES SUFFICIENT<br />
WELL-DIRECTED INVESTMENT IN THE DEVELOPMENT AND ADAPTATION<br />
OF NEW TECHNOLOGY. THIS EFFORT MUST ENCOMPASS NOT ONLY PURE<br />
RESEARCH, IN WHICH OUR ACHIEVEMENTS ARE IMPRESSIVE, BUT ALSO<br />
APPLIED AND INDUSTRIAL RESEARCHTHE<br />
ENCOURAGEMENT OF R&amp; D IN AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRY, OF<br />
INNOVATION AND OF A CLIMATE WHERE RISK-TAKING ON NEW<br />
PRODUCTS CAN FLOURISH, RATES HIGH AMONlG THE LABOR<br />
GOVERNMENT'S PRIORITIESI, i a / 16 </p>
<p>16.<br />
QUESTIONS ARISE WHEN WE REFLECT UPON THE DRASTIC<br />
DECLINE IN AUSTRALIA'S RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORT IN4<br />
RECENT YEARS. By COMPARISON WITH MANY COUNTRIES, AUSTRALIA<br />
DIVERTS A RELATIVELY SMALL PERCENTAGE ONLY 1.03 PER CENT<br />
OF ITS GDP TO THE FINANCE OF RESEARCH A. ND DEVELOPMENT. THE<br />
QUESTIONS ARE MORE DISTURBING WHEN IT IS RECOGNISED THAT A<br />
RELATIVELY LOW PROPORTION OF R&amp; D WAS PERFORMED IN THE<br />
PRIVATE SECTOR. AUSTRALIAN BUSINESS ENTERPRISES IN 1979<br />
ACCOUNTED FOR ABOUT ONLY ONE-FIFTH ON THE NATIONAL R&amp; D<br />
EFFORT, WHILE IN MOST ADVANCED OECD COUNTRIES THEY ACCOUNTED<br />
FOR OVER 40 PER CENT OF THAT EFFORT.<br />
AS A SMALL ECONOMY RICH IN NATURAL RESOURCES, WE<br />
HAVE DEMONSTRATED BOTH IN THE RURAL AND MINING FIELDS AN<br />
IMPRESSIVE CAPACITY TO GENERATE HIGH-QUALITY RESEARCH-WE<br />
ARE IN THE FOREFRONT, BOTH OF INNOVATION AND APPLICATION OF<br />
NEW TECHNOLOGY, IN MANY ASPECTS OF OUR PRIMARY PRODUCTIONTHE<br />
SAME UNFORTUNATELY HAS NOT BEEN THE CASE IN OUR<br />
MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY-WOULD EXPECT THE ADAPTATION OF<br />
OVERSEAS DEVELOPMENTS TO CONTINUE TO BE A PRINCIPLE SOURCE<br />
OF NEW TECHNOLOGY FOR AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRY-IN MANY AREASBUT<br />
ALONGSIDE THIS) IT IS IMPORTANT THAT LOCAL ENTERPRISES<br />
MOVE MORE DELIBERATELY TO ENHANCE THEIR OWN RESEARCH<br />
CAPACITIES. / 1s7 </p>
<p>17.<br />
LOOKING AT THE TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCE IN OUR PRIMARY<br />
AND SOME OF OUR SERVICE INDUSTRIES, ALONGSIDE THE SLUGGISH<br />
PACE OF CHANGE IN MUCH OF MANUFACTURING, I CANNOT HELP<br />
THINKING THAT AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENTS MUST ACCEPT A GOOD DEAL<br />
OF RESPONSIBILIIY FOR POOR PERFORMANCE IN THE LATTER AREA.<br />
SOME FORMS OF PROTECTION AGAINST IMPORTS HAVE DULLED THE<br />
ENTREPRENEURIAL SPIRIT AND REDUCED THE COMPETITIVE PRESSURES<br />
FOR HIGH PERFORMANCE BY A NUMBER OF AUSTRALIAN<br />
MANUFACTURERS. AS A CONSEQUENCE, I SUGGEST THAT THE<br />
SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY CAREFULLY CONSIDERS THE IMPLICATIONS OF<br />
ANY DEMANDS FOR HIGH PROTECTION FOR AUSTRALIAN PRODUCTS<br />
EMBODYING NEW TECHNOLOGY.<br />
ACROSS THE WHOLE RANGE OF ACTIVITIES, AUSTRALIA'S<br />
RECORD IN TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION IS NOT UNIMPRESSIVE. IN<br />
PURE AND SOME APPLIED RESEARCH IT COMPARES FAVOURABLY WITH<br />
THAT OF LEADING DEVELOPED COUNTRIES. THE FANTASTIC<br />
PERFORMANCE IN RECENT DAYS OF AUSTRALIA 11 BEARS THIS OUT.<br />
IN THAT CASE THE COMBINATION OF AUSTRALIAN TECHNOLOGICAL<br />
SKILL, EFFECTIVE TEAM WORK AND DEDICATED COMMITMENT TO AN<br />
OBJECTIVE HAS PUT AUSTRALIA AHEAD OF THE REST OF THE<br />
INDUSTRALISED WORLD-/ 18 </p>
<p>THERE IS OTHER EVIDENCE OF AUSTRALIAN SUCCESS IN<br />
', RODUCT DESIGN. SEVEN OF THE THIRTEEN AWARDS PRESENTED AT<br />
rHE TENTH ANNUAL I NTERNAT I ONAL TECHNOLOGY EXCHANGE FAIR I I<br />
MARCH 1982 WERE WON BY AUSTRALIAN PARTICIPANTS AND THIF: RE<br />
iAVE BEEN A NUMBER UF MANUFACTURING SUCCESSES WHICH HAVE<br />
ATTRACTED WORLD ACCLAIM, INCLUDING IN RECENT YEARS<br />
HARVESTERS, AUTOMATIC TOTALISATORS, YACHT WINCHES, THE WINE<br />
CASK, THE POP-TOP CAN, THE ROTARY CLOTHESLINE, BRAND NAME<br />
PROJECTORS AND WET SUITS, THE ATOMIC ABSORPTION<br />
SPECTROPHOTOMETER AND THE SELF-TWIST SPINNING MACHINE.<br />
OUTSIDE MANUFACTURING, WE HAVE LONG BEEN WORLD LEADERS IN<br />
RURAL TECHNOLOGY, MINING AND METALLURGY, THE INTERSCAN<br />
AIRPORT APPROACH SYSTEM IS AN IMPRESSIVE RECE1, T ADDITION TO<br />
A LONG HISTORY OF TRANSPORT INNOVATION.<br />
BUT WE DO HAVE AN OBVIOUS WEAKNESS IN THE<br />
COMMERCIAL EXPLOITATION OF MANY OF OUR GOOD IDEAS-WHILE ON<br />
ONE REPUTABLE MEASURE AUSTRALIA IS RESPONSIBLE FOR SOME<br />
2 PER CENT OF THE WORLD'S SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE, WE CAN ONLY<br />
CLAIM 0.7 PER CENT OF THE PATENTS ON WHICH TECHNOLOGICAL<br />
INNOVATION IS BASED AND CAN ONLY COUNT 0.3 PER CENT OF<br />
TECHNOLOGY-INTENSIVE EXPORTS AND 0.1 PER CENT OF SALES OF<br />
TECHNOLOGY WITHIN THE OECD COUNTRIES. 19<br />
111. 71 </p>
<p>THIS RECORD IS PATHETIC. THlE GAP BETWEEN RESEA\ RCH<br />
AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT MUST BE CLOSED. THE SLOW RATE OF<br />
TECHNOLOGY TRA\ NSFER INTO NEW PRODUCTS AND PROCESSES MUST BE<br />
ACCELERATED-INDEED WE MUST GO BEYOND THI s. APART FROM<br />
PRODUCT INNOVATION, NONVPRICE COMPETITION THROUGH QUALITY<br />
CHARACTER IST ICS HAS BEEN A MAJOR ELEMENT IN THE I NDUSTR IAL<br />
SUCCESS OF OTHER COUNTR IES. WE MUST THEREFORE LEARN NOT<br />
ONLY HOW TO DEVELOP THE PRODUCT -WE MUST ALSO FOCUS ON WHAT<br />
IS REQUIRED TO MARKET IT.-<br />
THE PROBLEM IS IN PART ONE OF PRIORITIES AND<br />
EFFECTIVE CHANNELS OF COMMUNICATION. AUSTRALIA'S RESEARCH<br />
INSTITUTIONS ARE TOO ISOLATED, BOTH INTELLECTUALLY AND<br />
PHYSICALLY, FROM INDUSTRY; ACADEMIA HAS GIVEN INSUFFICIENT<br />
ATTENTION TO POSSIBLE ECONOMIC APPLICATIONS OF ITS RESEARCH;<br />
AND INDUSTRY HAS NOT CONDUCTED ENOUGH OF ITS OWN IN-HOUSE<br />
R&amp; D. I AM PLEASED THAT THE SITUATION IS BEGINNING TO<br />
IMPROVE WITH UNIVERSITIES ESTABLISHING INDUSTRY LIAISON<br />
UNITS, CSIRO USING A VARIETY OF MEANS TO BUILD CLOSER<br />
INTERACTIVE LINKS WITH INDUSTRY, RESEARCH ASSOCIATIONS BEING<br />
FORMED AT THE INDUSTRY LEVEL, AND INNOVATION CENTRES BEING<br />
ESTABLISHED IN SOME STATES. THE VICTOR MOWER THAT<br />
LAUNCHED RECENTLY PROVIDES A GOOD EXAMPLE OF WHAT CAN BE<br />
ACHIEVED BY EfFECTIVE CO-OPERATION BETWEEN GOVERNMENT<br />
SPONSORED RESEARCH AND PRIVATE SECTOR COMMERCIALISATION.<br />
SUCH MOVES ARE NECESSARY IF AUSTRALIA IS TO BE ABLE TO<br />
COMPETE EFFECTIVELY IN A RAPIDLY CHANGING WORLD-</p>
<p>AUSTRALIA'S INDUSTRIAL VIABILITY IS DEPENDENT ON<br />
N14OVATION, ADAPTATION AND COMMERCIAL EXPLOITATION. THIS<br />
I'F:, NMENT IS DETERMINED TO PROVIDE AN ECONOMIC AND<br />
P,,. ITICAL CLIMATE IN WHICH INDUSTRIAL INNOVATION CAN<br />
I SH THE MAI N ROLE OF GOVERNMENT I S TO PROV I DE THE<br />
MACRO-ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT, INCLUDING THE POLICIES DIRECTED<br />
AT ACHIEVING A FAIR DISTRIBUTION OF THE COSTS AND BENEFITS<br />
OF GROWTH, WITHIN WHICH ECONOMIC CHANGE CAN OCCUR. BUT IN<br />
SOME AREAS THERE IS A NEED FOR MORE DIRECT INTERVENTION TO<br />
INFLUENCE BUSINESS DECISIONS, WHEN IT SEEMS THAT THE MARKET<br />
IT NOT WORKING TO ACHIEVE AN EFFICIENT ALLOCATION OF<br />
RESOURCESTHE GOVERNMENT IDENTIFIED ONE SUCH AREA OF MARKET<br />
FAILURE IN THE FINANCING OF SMALL, INNOVATIVE MANUFACTURING<br />
FIRMS. THIS MARKET FAILURE SEEMED TO LEAD TO<br />
UNDER-INVESTMENT IN THESE ACTIVITIES, VIEWED FROM THE<br />
INTERESTS OF THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE.<br />
ACCORDINGLY, WE HAVE RECENTLY TAKEN ACTION TO<br />
ENCOURAGE THE DEVELOPMENT OF A SUBSTANTIAL VENTURE CAPITAL<br />
MARKET IN AUSTRALIA. TAX CONCESSIONS ANNOUNCED THE WEEK / 21 </p>
<p>BEFORE LAST SHOULD LEAD TO SOME $ 140 MILLION BEING AVAILABLE<br />
TO HIGH RISK INDUSTRY VENTURES. A MANAGEMENT AND INVESTMENT<br />
COMPANY LiCENCING BOARD IS BEING ESTABLISHED TO ADMINISTER<br />
THE PROGRAM AND TO LICENCE MANAGEMENT AND INVESTMENT<br />
COMPANIES. SUCH COMPANIES AFTER ASSESSING EACH VENTURE IN<br />
TERMS OF TECHNICAL AN MARKET PROSPECTS FOR ITS PRODUCTSWILL<br />
BE ABLE TO PROVIDE NOT ONLY CAPITAL BUT ALSO OFTEN<br />
BADLY NEEDED MANAGEMENT SKILLS-WITH THESE STEPS A<br />
REASONABLE BALANCE HAS I BELIEVE BEEN STRUCK BY THE<br />
GOVERNMENT BETWEEN SUPPORT FOR POTENTIALLY VALUABLE<br />
ENTERPRISES AND THE COST THEY SHOULD LEGITIMATELY PLACE ON<br />
THE REST OF THE COMMUNITYTHE<br />
GOVERNMENT IS ALSO CONCERNED TO INCREASE THE<br />
FLOW OF RESOURCES DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN PROMOTING STRUCTURAL<br />
CHANGE DIRECTED AT RAISING NATIONAL PRODUCTIVITY. TO THIS<br />
END, WE MOVED TO EXPAND THE AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES<br />
DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION'S LENDING POWERS. WE ARE ENHANCING<br />
THE AIDC'S ABILITY TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF<br />
AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRY-ITS GEARING RATIO IS BEING INCREASED<br />
FROM 8: 1 TO 15: 1; THE GOVERNMENT WILL GUARANTEE AIDC's<br />
BORROWING TO ALLOW IT T. 0 MOVE INTO THE VENTURE CAPITAL<br />
MAARKET IN A BIGGER WAY; AND THE AIDC WILL NOW BE ALLOWED TO<br />
EXTEND LOANSITO THE SERVICES SECTOR AND TOURISM-THESE<br />
MEASURES ARE IN ADDITION TO THE $ 12.5 MILLION CAPITAL<br />
INJECTION PROVIDED IN THE 1983-84 BUDGET FOR THE AIDC WHOSE </p>
<p>22.<br />
STATUTORY CAPITAL BASE IS NOW TO BE RAISED FROM $ 100 MILLION<br />
TO $ 150 MILLION. THIS SUPPORT REPRESENTS PRACTICAL ACTION<br />
BY THE GOVERNMENT AIMED AT ASSIST ING THE F INANCING OF THE<br />
NECESSARY RESTRUCTURING AND REVITALISATION OF AUSTRALIAN<br />
I NDUs rRYTHE UPGRADING OF AUSTRALIA' S TECHNOLOGICAL BASE IS<br />
ESSENTIAL IF THE COMPETITIVENESS OF AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRY IS<br />
TO BE IMPROVED. ACCORDINGLY INDUSTRIAL RESEARCH AND<br />
TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT WAS ACCORDED A VERY HIGH PRIORITY IN<br />
THE 1983-84 BUDGET. MORE THAN $ 71 MILLION WAS ALLOCATED TO<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMEN4T<br />
INCENTIVES SCHEME A RISE OF MORE THAN 30 PER CENT ON THE<br />
1982-83 ALLOCATION); $ 23 MILLION WAS ALLOCATED TO CSIRO<br />
RESEARCH PROGRAMS RELEVANT TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW<br />
TECHNOLOGIES AND $ 1.2 MILLION WAS PROVIDED FOR THE<br />
ESTABLISHMENT OF SIROTECH, A COMPANY DEDICATED TO<br />
ENCOURAGING A HIGHER DEGREE OF PRIVATE SECTOR INVOLVEMENT IN<br />
PROMISING NEW TECHNOLOGIES DEVELOPED BY CSIRO.<br />
A FURTHER $ 8.5 MILLION WAS EARMARKED FOR MULTIPLIER<br />
AGENCIES, RESEARCH ASSOCIATIONS AND OTHER PROGRAMS TO<br />
PROMOTE AND DEVELOP HIGH TECHNOLOGY GROWTH INDUSTRIES,<br />
INCLUDING ANALYSIS OF NEW MARKET OPPORTUNITIES AND SUPPORT<br />
FOR INNOVATION CENTRES AND ASSISTANCE TO INVENTORSADDITIONALLY,<br />
THE GOVERNMENT HAS PROVIDED FUNDS FOR A / 213 </p>
<p>23.<br />
NATIONAL RESEARCH FELLOWSHIPS SCHEME DESIGNED TO BRIDGE THE<br />
GAP BETWEEN INDUSTRY AND ACADEMIA.-THE SCHEME WILL GENERATE<br />
CROSS-FLRTILISATION OF KNOWLEDGE AND TALENT WHICH IS A<br />
PRE'_ hiEEtJISITE FOR DEVELOPMENT OF INDUSTRY BASED ON THE BEST<br />
AV A I LABLE T ECHNOLOGY<br />
IT SHOULD ALSO FACILITATE CLOSER LINKS BETWEEN<br />
INDUSTRY ANJD RESEARCHERS AND TERTIARY EDUCATION AND PROVIDE<br />
A SKILLED WORKFORCE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF HIGH TECHNOLOGYTHE<br />
AUSTRALIAN RESEARCH GRANTS SCHEME FOR 1984 HAS ALSO BEEN<br />
INCREASED BY 16 PER CENT OVER THE 1983 CALENDAR YEAR<br />
ALLOCATION-IT CAN BE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO CONTRIBUTE<br />
SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE STRONG PROGRAM OF BASIC RESEARCH<br />
ESSENTIAL TO AUSTRALIA'S DEVELOPMENT.<br />
TOGETHER THESE MEASURES REPRESENT VERY SIGNIFICANT<br />
SUPPORT FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND SHOULD NOT ONLY<br />
STIMULATE THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW INDUSTRIES) BUT ALSO<br />
CONTRIBUTE TO THE BROADER GOALS OF ECONOMIC GROWTH,<br />
STRUCTURAL ADAPTATION BY EXISTING INDUSTRIES AND GREATER<br />
ORIENTATION OF AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRY TOdARDS EXPORTSWE<br />
HAVE IN THIS COUNTRY THE INTELLECTUAL<br />
WHEREWITHAL TO ADOPT A NEW ATTITUDE THAT ALLOWS US TO MAKE<br />
BETTER USE OF NEW TECHNOLOGY FOR OUR NATIONAL PURPOSES-WE<br />
HAVE GOOD SCHOOLS AND UNIVERSITIES, STABLE GOVERNMENT AND<br />
THE OBVIOUS POTENTIAL TO BUILD A GREAT FUTURE, BASED ON THE<br />
DEVELOPMENT AN~ D APPRECIATION OF INNOVATIVE INDUSTRIAL<br />
S TR UCT URES-~./ 214 </p>

SOME WILL SAY TO THIS THAT AUSTRALIA IS NOT YET<br />
READY; THAT THE COST OF ADJUSTMENT IS UNACCEPTABLY HIGH;<br />
THAT PROTECTION MUST BE PROVIDED AGAINST THE GROWING POWER<br />
OF OVERSEAS COMPETITION. TO THEM I CAN SIMPLY SAY: " I HEAR<br />
YOU, B3UT CANNOT AGREE"-<br />
OUR FUTURE IS IN OUR OWN HANDS. WE MUST ADDRESS<br />
THOSE ECONOMIC CONSTRAINTS AND POLICY FAILURES WHICH HAVE<br />
HAMPERED THE PROCESS BY WHICH TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION IS<br />
CONVERTED INTO REAL INCOME GROWTH RATHER THAN UNEMPLOYMENTWE<br />
MUST RECOGNISE THE NEED FOR ADAPTATION IN TRADITIONAL<br />
INDUSTRIES AND A GROWING ROLE FOR NEW TECHNOLOGY-BASED<br />
INDUSTRIES WHERE OPPORTUNITY FOR NEW PRODUCTS, AND<br />
CONSEQUENT GROWTH ABOUNDS-IF NOTHING ELSE, THE<br />
INCREASINGLY COMPETITIVE CHARACTER OF THE WORLD AROUND<br />
SHOULD FORCE THIS RECOGNITION ON USTHE<br />
TASK BEFORE US IS TO MAKE TECHNOLOGY WORK FOR<br />
AUST RALIA. WE CAN CREATE THE INDUSTRIAL CAPABILITY, FIRST<br />
IN THE DOMESTIC MARKET AND THEN IN EXPORTS. THE RESULTANT<br />
GROWTH AND BENEFITS TO ALL WILL MORE THAN JUSTIFY THE<br />
EFFORT. 4 4 4 4.<br />
