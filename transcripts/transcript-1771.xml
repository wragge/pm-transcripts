FOR PRESS: -8 FEB 1968<br />
LIBRAg FM. NO. 16/ 1968<br />
MORE FLCOCD AID FOR NEWV SOUTH VWALES<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr John Gorton<br />
The Commonwealth Government has agreed to a<br />
request from the 1Nlew South Wales Government that it join with the<br />
State in providing $ 50, CX on a dollar-for-dollar basis for the<br />
relief of personal hardship and distress suffered by people in the<br />
North Coast and North-WVest regions of New South Wales as a result<br />
of recent further major flooding in those areas.<br />
It will be recalled that in June last year, the<br />
Commonwealth agreed to provide $ 5C, CC0 on a dollar-for-dollar<br />
basis with the State for this purpose, and an additional $ 20, CCC was<br />
made available in Auguct following further flooding.<br />
In addition to the immediate relief of distress, this<br />
total Commonwealth assistance of $ 120, OC0 may be used for making<br />
essential repairs to houses and for repairing and replacing essential<br />
items of furniture and equipment to the extent necessary to provide<br />
reasonable living conditions for those who, due to lack of adequate<br />
financial resources, would otherwise suffer personal hardship.<br />
In accordance with the constitutional division of<br />
responsibilities, provision of relief following natural disasters is<br />
a matter which falls within the province of the States. However,<br />
in recognition of the need on humanitarian grounds to take special<br />
action for the quick alleviation of individual cases of hardship,<br />
successive Commonwealth Governments have adopted the policy of<br />
assisting State Governments in financing relief schemes where the<br />
damage has been severe or widespread, but the initiative in setting<br />
up these schemes rests with the State concerned. The Commonwealth<br />
participates at the request of the State and on the basis of matching the<br />
amount of money which the State customarily makes available.<br />
