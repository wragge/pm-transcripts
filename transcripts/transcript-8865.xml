JR: Can I just say as an opening comment that the talks<br />
this morning have gone very well, both between Prima<br />
Minister Keating and myself and the office and now<br />
with twelve Cabinet Ministers. They have been very<br />
good diecusaionG, we have covored the range of<br />
issues that are important to both countries. I have<br />
been very pleased,<br />
PM: And likewise. This is a natural opportunity to look<br />
at Australia and New Zealand's both relationship one<br />
to the other, but as well our strategic<br />
circumstances in the world In which we live and the<br />
region and the world mote generally. So we have<br />
been able to do those things and then as well as<br />
that discus all the bilateral things as well.<br />
J; Was the contentious issue of benefits discussed at<br />
all Prime Ministers?<br />
PM: We discussed It and I think it has been an issue<br />
under discussion now for some time and one which I<br />
think we will have further discussions on.<br />
J: And what elements Prime Minister?<br />
PM: They will be discussions at Minister level. When is<br />
it Jim, a few months tine?<br />
JD; About a months time. The Ministers are scheduled to<br />
meeL from New Zealand and Australia in about a<br />
month. That meeting was In place, they will pick up<br />
the issue and move it forward. We made it clear<br />
that we are talking about pensions, we are not<br />
talking about benefits. The tenor of te disCuSsion<br />
was constructive, the Ministers will now pick it up<br />
and move it forward, I'm quite certain they will do<br />
that and I would hope they can move it forward<br />
reasonably quickly. </p>

J: Mr Keating, is Australia talking about pensions or<br />
unemployment benefits as well?<br />
PM: We are talking in terms of discussions we've had<br />
today they have been about pensions rather than<br />
benefits and as the Prime Minister has said that ig<br />
the basis on which ministerial discussions will now<br />
ensue.<br />
J: Do you want that to be wider though Mr Keating?<br />
PM: No, from our point of view that is fair enough.<br />
J; Did you discuss defence issues today?<br />
PM: In the general yes.<br />
J: Are you seeking more ol a role from New Zealand in<br />
defence terms, more defence expenditure?<br />
PM: The important thing between our countries is that we<br />
maintain that sort of operational capacity together,<br />
I'm not sure whether it is qulte the word but<br />
operability between us and that the whole question<br />
about keeping core forces together, their competence<br />
As an issue of Importance for both of.<br />
J: Prime Minister what about the Kangaroo exercises?<br />
JB; That is not something either directly in the control<br />
of Prime Minister Keating or myself. The answer to<br />
your question is yes, but you will be aware of<br />
course of the AmeLican position on that and until<br />
that changes we won't be able to do so, but New<br />
Zealand would certainly welcome the opportunity of<br />
re~ oinlng those exercises. Both the Prime Minister<br />
and myself agree that it is important, that our two<br />
forces operate in a coherent fashion, one<br />
Integrating with the other or complementing the<br />
other and that is certainly an ambition. we both<br />
believe in the five power defence arrangement which<br />
we are members of as again as a strategic, sensible<br />
arrangement. So all that we have no difficulty on.<br />
I think we should Vo, we do have a luncheon that we<br />
are supposed to both appear at and God knows what<br />
you'll say if both of us don't appear at it and I<br />
know Prime Minioter has a press conference later as<br />
well.<br />
PM: I'm happy to take more detailed questions lator.<br />
Thank you.<br />
JB: Thank you.<br />
