NATIONAL PRESS CLUB LUNCHEON,<br />
HOTEL CANBERRA. CANBERRA 14TH SEPTEMBER 1964<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, the Rt, Hon. Sir Robert Menzies.<br />
Mr. Chairman I've bean misled and I've been misled by that<br />
deplorable character Maley ( Laughter). I understood from him<br />
that today was my 301h anniversary. I am no doubt quite wrong,<br />
but there you are. But I thought it was I didn't look it up,<br />
and when I had people coming to me earlier and saying " Many<br />
happy returns of the day", a somewhat fantastic wish you will<br />
agree, I was still under the illusion that it was today, but<br />
now it's tomorrow. So I suppose I'll have to make a little<br />
speech and then make it retrospective to tomorrow, hoping that<br />
I survive so long. Now I was told that what you would like to hear,<br />
as briefly as possible would be some retrospective views of<br />
affairs, people, since I came here first in 1934. Or as Ray<br />
Maley, with that exquisite capacity for an original phrase<br />
that characterises the Press, said to me " Wandering Down<br />
Memory Lane" ( Laughter). Well, I will first of all wander down it about<br />
Canberra itself because at that time in 1934, Canberra had<br />
6,000 people, and you could positively stroll around the whole,<br />
beat the bounds, in two hours with no difficulty, Now it's a<br />
large place and getting larger. In 1934, it did not have<br />
municipal self-government, a state of affairs that still continues.<br />
( Laughter) Back in 1934, in the Lyons Government, we had a<br />
Budget I haven't had a chance of looking up the precise<br />
figures but I would say something of the order of œ 75 Mo for<br />
the year, the Commonwealth Budget. I, myself, in 1939 by a<br />
temporary but speedily corrected error, became Prime Minister<br />
and introduced the first œ 100M. Budget. Happy daysl ( Laughter)<br />
Even then, I have no doubt that some of the newspapers here<br />
represented complained of the gross extravagance of public<br />
expenditure and said that it ought to be cut down, We spent in a<br />
delirium of excitement in 1935-6-7, around that time, œ 15M. a<br />
year on social services and it's no-. w somewhere between œ 400M,<br />
and œ 5OOM. and is conceded by everybody to be grossly inadequate<br />
( Laughter) but that was the position at that time.<br />
We had, in theory, an External Affairs Department.<br />
We didn't really have a Department, we had a Minister for External<br />
Affairs, because George Pearce about whom I will say something<br />
later on, was Minister for Defence and Minister for External<br />
Affairs. Instead of masses of young men and women who now have<br />
their being in the External Affairs Department and who are the<br />
masters of all the most subtle intricacies of the United Nations'<br />
procedure, so important for somebody, in those days, George<br />
Pearce, the Minister," Hoddy" Hodgson he was the Department,<br />
and there was the stenographer and she was the other part of the<br />
Department. ( Laughter) We had a High Commissioner in London.<br />
We had no other diplomatic representative anywhere in the world.<br />
Those were days of noble simplicity. Today, of course as you<br />
know we have High Commissioners and Ambassadors aroun the<br />
world and we have an External Affairs Department of a fully<br />
sophisticated kind with all sorts of aspects of international<br />
affairs being dealt with. Very hard to believe that when I was </p>
<p>-2-<br />
first here in this very place, in this hotel, we had none of<br />
these things. I don't think we had any Trade Commissioners at<br />
that time. We may have had. If we had, they existed in<br />
perhaps New Zealand and Canada, but we had no organised Trade<br />
Commissioner service of the kind that we now have. In other<br />
words, these were days of almost Spartan simplicity in administration.<br />
The complexities of international trade the complexities<br />
of international affairs had not yet fully developed,<br />
they had not yet been complicated by all the explosive effects<br />
of the Second World War and those events that happened after the<br />
Second World War and I th-nk the result was, in those days,<br />
with fewer Min. sters than we now have, it was found possible to<br />
have a certain amount of civilised leisure Ministers were<br />
well known to be seen on the late lamented golf course, playing<br />
golf. Indeed their fraternity with the Heads of Departments<br />
on the old Canberra golf course postponed the introduction of<br />
the Lake for a long, long time, ( Laughter) Which reminds rne<br />
that of course we had no lakeo We had none of these things<br />
that we are nw beginning to take for granted.<br />
Now I just said to you that there was a certain<br />
simplicity about life. That's quite true. If there was a<br />
conference in Iondon it was a conference between a limited<br />
number of people all of whom understcod each otheri It had<br />
none of the complexities that have come with the new Ccmmonwealth.<br />
Indeed, nobody in those dayz could have envisaged<br />
what was going to happen as colony after colony came to self-<br />
Governm-nt and to independent statehood,<br />
Well, of course inevitably, moving over thirty<br />
years, the complexity of matters to be dealt with by governments<br />
has expanded almost by geometrical progression, I can give<br />
evidence about this because I ii the only extant creature who<br />
was a Prime Minister in 1939 and 1940 and 1941 and who is still<br />
a Prime Minister in this year of grace '" Grace", I think, is<br />
the right word. ( Laughter) But anyhow, I ghcught that I had<br />
plenty to do at that time and indeed I did, I worked seven<br />
days a week and there are only seven days in the week. I would<br />
say that the complexity and mass of matters coming across my<br />
table today is double or treble what it was a-that time,<br />
twenty-five years ago,, This goes for everything,<br />
The sturdy individualists in the country who resent<br />
any political interference apply for it every week. The<br />
manufacturers who oh, I must be careful because I have to<br />
speak to them this week sometime ( Laughter) what I will<br />
call the sturdy believers in private enterprise who think the<br />
Government ought to keep out of it are with us every week or<br />
with the Tariff Board every week or with something or other<br />
every week. There is hardly a section in the community today<br />
that doesn't in one breath protest its undying hostility to<br />
government activity and in the next breath, pray for it.<br />
It isn't a wonderful or a remarkable or a regrettable<br />
thing that the number of Ministers has perhaps almost doubled<br />
since I first came to Canberra, it has been necessary and I<br />
venture to say that if the complexity of modern affairs and the<br />
demands made on governments both continue their pressure, there<br />
will be more Ministers and more Ministers in time to come, and<br />
a bigger and bigger Parliament in time to cone.<br />
I mention it to you because I know it is not of your<br />
own malice but under the instructions that you will be given, or<br />
Sa e * a./ 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
your successors will be given, that you must criticise every<br />
increase of any kind, and say that it is nonsense; that what<br />
the Government needs is fewer Ministers and not more. Well,<br />
all I can tell you is that if we had fewer there would be one<br />
interesting consequence, because if you reduced the number of<br />
Ministers and you thereby increased the responsibilities coming<br />
to each Minister, you would make him more and more dependent on<br />
his Departmental officers. You have only to reduce the number<br />
of Ministers far enough to create ultimately a complete<br />
bureaucracy. It's worth thinking about,<br />
A Minister must have sufficient opportunity and<br />
time, if he is a seriously-minded person to master the problems<br />
of his Department, and if he does, he will be able to place the<br />
proper value on the highly competent professional advice that<br />
he will get from his Department. Eut if he is so pressed<br />
always against the clock, that he just has to say, " Well, look<br />
I haven't time to answer this problem, So-and-so, my Departmental<br />
Head is a very wise and experienced fellow and ho reccmmends<br />
so-and-so, i11' say eyes'", Now this is worth thinking about,<br />
It is worth thinking about.<br />
Cabinets don't cost mucho Really they don't if you<br />
look at the broad saeep of national affairs. I would sooner have<br />
too many than too few, because I believe that the best kind of<br />
government arises when Ministers have enough cnergy and time to<br />
think about their own problems and to form viewJ, and enough<br />
time to put the proper value on the advice they will get, as<br />
they will get iz, from vhat in my opinion is one of the greatest<br />
civil services in the world. But we must have balance, and<br />
that's why, looking back over this time, I see an enormous<br />
increase in numbers and I believe that it's been justified.<br />
Well now, I must push on. I've said to myself for<br />
the last two or three days, " How does the standard of debate in<br />
the House compare new with what it was thirty years ago?" Well,<br />
I think on the whole it's better. There are two reasons which<br />
make me interested to find myself admitting to myself that it<br />
is better. One is that there are two very good reasons why it<br />
should be worse. One reason is that people, constituents ( I have no<br />
complaint about my own; they have remarkable patience and<br />
endurance) but people, constituents, will write an enormous<br />
amount of correspondence to a member, a private Member of<br />
Parliament, and if he is going to answer them and deal with all<br />
the details that they want him to deal with and go to the various<br />
Departments and got the necessary answers, then he's going to<br />
have a pretty small amount of time to sit down and do that good<br />
hard sweat and study that is necessary if anybody is going to<br />
make a considerable speech.<br />
The volume of constituency work, of course, grows<br />
and grows and grows every year because we are always having some<br />
new proposal, there is some new social service, there are some<br />
new changes in the rules of social services, there are changes<br />
in trade treaties, changes in the tariff schedules. There are<br />
masses of things of this kind, and on all of them, the Member<br />
is going to be at the receiving end. Therefore, when I consider<br />
their constituency and correspondence and interviewing work, I<br />
would have expected as a more or less detached observer, to find<br />
that the standard of debate had fallen since those more spacious<br />
and leisurely days when I first came to Canberra. Now I am<br />
happy to say I don't think the standard of debate has fallen,<br />
on the whole. I can hear, I think, a higher percentage of<br />
thoughtful constributions to debate than I could have at that time.<br />
08o 0 </p>
<p>I was a bit nervous about broadcasting. Very<br />
nervous about it because,...... broadcasting, of course has one<br />
great advantage which all you gentlemen of the Press will<br />
understand perfectly. : It does mean that if anybody cares to<br />
listen to you, he does know what you said, ( Laughter). You<br />
understand me perfectly, But I gather that only abou* one or<br />
one and a half per cent, of the people listen. That's, as a<br />
corrective factor not perhaps as great as it might have been,<br />
But in the early days, I felt that it was almost ludicrous when<br />
the broadcasting came in and we had these things standing up<br />
you know, these microphones. Somebody described it as looking<br />
like the petrified forest.<br />
In those days, gentlemen, private members who sat<br />
round here, would be seen to be moving very anxiously to the<br />
nearest microphone when they were about to deliver a speech.<br />
There was then a non-technical theory that you had to be close<br />
to the wretched instrument to be heard by your constituents.<br />
And indeed, some of you will remember that on one celebrated<br />
occasion one member of happy memory was having a little<br />
difficulty with his upper denture in the course of making a<br />
speech. There was a certain clatter and occasionally a hissing<br />
and a certain amount of obscurity which produced, I regret to<br />
say, some laughter in the House. He said, " It's all right. It's<br />
my upper set. By the way, Doc., ( addreasing his dentist who<br />
lived in some place 500 miles away), by the way Doc, don't forget<br />
Itve goc an appointment witn you on Saturday morning," ( Laughter)<br />
Well, there's another comment I'll make. on thar, I<br />
thought that broadcasting with this business of getting into<br />
line with The microphone would produce mo-e and more set speeches<br />
and less and less debate. I think in the long .' un that hasn't<br />
happened. It did in the start. It was quite clear that ic<br />
didn't matter what Jones, Brown or Robinson had said, Smith was<br />
going to say his piece into the nearest microphone and his<br />
constituents, as he hoped, would be listening to him and they<br />
would then understand, I think all that has rather died away.<br />
I think on the whole there is more debating in the i; rue sense,<br />
more cut and thrust more answering of arguments to and fro now<br />
than there was in the two or three yeals after broadcasting was<br />
introduced. And from that point of view, I think there is much<br />
to be thankful fore<br />
I would think, on the whole, the average level of<br />
debate, yes, has risen, There are many thoughtful speeches, I<br />
was tempted to think that might be due, particularly in recent<br />
years to a rising level of educational attainment, until I<br />
remembered myself that formal education let's remember it<br />
has hardly ever been the test of distinction in the political<br />
field, George Pearce, about whom I will speak a little later,<br />
who was a very great Parliamentarian, was a bush carpenter.<br />
His formal education terminated no doubt, when he was thirteen<br />
or fourteen years old. You can t go by that. Some people have<br />
talents and improve them all the way through their lives and some<br />
people have some talents and improve them early and neglect them<br />
later. The real test is whether a man has a continuing mental<br />
attack on the problems that he deals with. And from that point<br />
of view, I think that the debate which has improved, I think has<br />
not improved solely because of formal education though that s<br />
of great assistance, but has improved because it is increasingly<br />
seen how serious a matter the government of the country is.<br />
Now I wish I could say that I thought the standard of<br />
reporting had risen. I don't think it has, quite frankly. I<br />
remember saying to John Curtin, when he was Leader of the<br />
Opposition, " You know, John, you can splak, why do you read?"<br />
and he said, " Well, I ar an old journalistic sweat, but you know,<br />
0 0 01 </p>
<p>if I want to be reported, I must hand it out.', Now,, there is a<br />
bit of truth in this,, isn't there? A bit of truth. A recent<br />
debate in the House tat 1 listened to with great interest<br />
consisted of one speech that was read and a reply that was<br />
brilliant and destructive of the whole argument, but it was<br />
the first one that arrived. I don't think, if you will allow<br />
me to say so, that the standard of reporting has been maintained,<br />
and that is, I think to a substantial extent, the responsibility<br />
of Ministers who real out Second Reading speeches and of other<br />
people who read out speeches in the course of debate and find it<br />
convenient to hand them over.<br />
The whole glory of Parliamentary debate is that it<br />
is debate, that it has cut and thrust and nobody ever produced<br />
any cut or thrust by the more process of producing a piece of<br />
paper. This is the clash of minds. It is the debate which<br />
swerves from one side to the other under the pressure of events,<br />
which accommodates itself to a new argument, to a new thought,,<br />
This is the most fascinating thing in the world.<br />
It is because of this, you know, that W inston, when<br />
the House of Commons wasi to be rebuilt after the W~ ar, said,<br />
" We will not have it any bigger. de will not have a House of<br />
Commons that can hold all the Members of the House of Commons,<br />
Peoples strangers to his way of thiinking, thought, " Well how<br />
crazy.' 3 But they did it.~ because the whole idea was tha if you<br />
have a place so vast and wide that all tho intimacy of discussion<br />
disappears, you might as well have Parliamentary debate corducted<br />
by a series of essays printed and distributed and a division list<br />
at an appropriate time. The importance ol' Parliamentary debate<br />
is, I think, something, wel~ in myrid, it is something essential<br />
to the continuation of democracy. And that's why I am glad to<br />
say that I think, on the whole, the average level of debate is<br />
better now than it was when I came up here.<br />
Now, Itvo been going a long time and therefore<br />
perhaps I might just say a few words to you about some of those<br />
who have boen here and who are no longer alive. It would be<br />
impertinent of me to discuss the living. -But there have been<br />
some very interesting people here and I have time only to mention<br />
four or five of them to you.<br />
There was Mr. Lyons himself, the first Prime Minister<br />
under whom I served. He had a bland manner. He had a genial<br />
manner. He was the perfect family man. This has great appeal<br />
in Australia, and vory properly but it is sometimes not realised<br />
that Lyons was a positively brilliant Parliamentarian. I don't<br />
think I ever knewr a better. Let mne explain to you what I mean.<br />
You fellows have all known, you've seen this. Question<br />
time, and Se-and-so has got a curly one and unless a Minister<br />
knows what it is about, he may easily foozle it a little or he<br />
may be driven back into a series of requests to put it on the<br />
Notice Paper; this is a testing time, Question Time Without<br />
Notice, remember on two or three occasions when I was his<br />
Attorney-Generaol going to Mr. Lyons and saying, " I just heard a<br />
very nasty question, a very difficult question is going to be put<br />
to you today. It is a rather complicated matter and there is no<br />
earthly reason why you should have heard of it." And he would<br />
say " Well, no, I haven't, but do you knew about it?" And I<br />
would say, " Yes, I've managed to." And he would say, " Well, sit<br />
down and tell me." Then I would explain this matter as best I<br />
could. And then I went away in my then youth and innocence, saying<br />
to myself, " I hope he remembers what I've told him." 1 This was a<br />
.6<br />
5 </p>
<p>-6-6<br />
stupid thought of mine because sure enough, up came the question<br />
and, sure enough, up Lyons got and made a repy so charming, so<br />
bland, so accommodating, which didn't answer a single point<br />
( Laughter) that I had mentioned, that when he sat down, the<br />
questioner who had begun full of malice, would be seen smiling<br />
and saying, " Thank you very much." ( Laughter) Now, this is not<br />
to be sneezed at. ( Laughter)<br />
When they say a man is a great Parliamentarian,<br />
you must never just think that means he has been in Parliament<br />
a long time. It means that he knows every noise and every creak<br />
in the machinery and he understands the human beings who are in<br />
Parliament and is able to proceed without becoming involved in<br />
avoidable arguments or talking himself out of his own Bill.<br />
We've seen all these things happen, haven't we? I think that<br />
Joe Lyons was a great Parliamentarian. I learned a lot from<br />
watching him and listening to him. Not enough, but a lot.<br />
Well, then, the next man I want to mention is the<br />
late Mr. Scullin. Now, he was Prime Minister before I came here.<br />
He was Prime Minister from the end of 1929 until the end of 1931,<br />
beginning of 1932 and I came here about this time in 1934, and<br />
when he had been defeated and when the United Australia Party<br />
came in, Scullin became the Leader of the Opposition as a former<br />
Prime Minister and he held that post for oh, I've forgotten<br />
two or three years perhaps. Then he announced he was retiring<br />
from it. I was staying in this Hotel( which then, of course,<br />
I hasten -Lo say, was not as good as it is now) and so was he and<br />
we walked down together to the House, and I said " Sir, why are<br />
you retiring or is that an impertinent question?" He said,<br />
" No. I don't mind telling cu. You see I had a short but<br />
very torrid time as a Prime Minister." ( Ho encountered the whole<br />
blast of the Depression). " Well, I know what happens in the<br />
Prime Minister's Office. I know how many matters are the subject<br />
of despatches, of cables with other governments and other people<br />
and there are some things you would love to be able to talk about<br />
which you can't talk about because they are in a certain stage<br />
of negotiation. Now ( he said) the only man who ought to be the<br />
Leader of the Opposition is a fellow who has never had that<br />
responsibility so he can put all the embarrassing questions in<br />
the world. I can't and I won't because I know what is going on<br />
inside the Administration and so, I am disqualified by former<br />
office." I was very impressed by this though I didnt<br />
follow the example ( Laughter) lateronmyself. But let it be remembered,<br />
this was completely illustrative of Jim Scullin. He was a very<br />
fine man. He was a nan of sensitive honour and integrity. Ho was<br />
indeed. I don't think he was a very great thinker, if I may say<br />
so, with respect, you know. He wasn't one of the great statesmen<br />
in that sense, but he was a man of intelligence and activity<br />
and an acutely conscientious man, and I think that the Labour<br />
Party was indeed fortunate to have a man of his quality, even<br />
for this brief period in which it was in office in 1930 and<br />
1931. Now, of course, no talk about these people would be<br />
complete without mentioning Billy Hughes. ' ell, I can't say<br />
too much about this because I saw Hughes only in his declining<br />
days 1934, well, he was never going to be Prime Minister again.<br />
He had a beautiful waspish wit which could be produced out of a<br />
blue sky in Cabinet, but quite frankly, his ideas were no longer<br />
constructive and his estimates of public opinion, an element to<br />
which he attached a great deal of importance, were not very<br />
frequently right. Now, I don't know. I am going to read / 7 </p>
<p>-7-<br />
Fitzharding's book on Billy with loving care because I would lile<br />
to discover a few things about him. All I want to say is that in<br />
my time there was nothing about that he had to do or say which<br />
would exhibit more than a gleam of what he must have been at an<br />
earlier stage in his life. But his wit was devastating, and his<br />
use of his deafness, masterly. ( Laughter)<br />
ii rnenii2El on onk u cujlcn, fuL-axaaple, he brought<br />
up a proposition in the Lyons Government which was so hopeless<br />
that even the rest of us, in our ignorance, realised how hopeless<br />
it was; he didn't get a supporter. Everybody said, " No" for a<br />
variety of reasons. Now in those days those old days, we didn't<br />
have a Secretary to the Cabinet, we didnit have Jack Bunting<br />
sitting around or somebody making notes. The Junior Honorary<br />
Minister we even had those at that time, illegally but the<br />
Junior Honorary Minister was supposed to retain some memory<br />
and the Minister concerned would put his submission over and get<br />
the Prime Minister to say " approved". This was the record.<br />
I remember one day when Billy had brought up some proposition<br />
which was really too bad for words you see ( Laughter) and we<br />
all picked it to pieces, Out he had taken his little machine out<br />
of his ear and so at the end of it all , he picked up his submission<br />
and passed it over to Lyons and said, " Well, I take it you can<br />
sign this." ( Laughter) I said something just a while ago about George<br />
Pearce. You know, there was a great legend about Pearce. Because<br />
He had gone in almost at the same time as t3illy, though from<br />
another State, because he had followed Billy's fortunes in<br />
crossing the floor of the House, the tradition was that George<br />
Pearce was a sort of Vj. car of Bray. I would just like to tell<br />
you that in my opinion, speaking about Canberra, I have never. sat<br />
in Cabinet with an abler man than George Pearce. This ne~ ds to<br />
be said in justice to his memory. He was a man of extraordinary<br />
experience, of course, and he ' had great wisdom and he wasn't just<br />
somebody who could say, " Oh well, you know, I remember." He<br />
would . analyse a problem just like that, and having analysed it,<br />
he didn't leave all the loathsome bits and pieces on the table as<br />
so many people do, if they analyse a problem, but he Ilways knew<br />
which one to pick out and say, ,, Vell, now, that's the thing.<br />
Thats'sthe determining factor," and give you his reasons for it,<br />
and his influence on these matters was tremendous and not negative<br />
but positive at all times. Some day, justice will be done to<br />
George Pearce. As it is, I look back on my great good fortune<br />
to have sat in a Cabinet with him for three years, as one of the<br />
things in my life. Well, then, I have just time to mention quite<br />
briefly two men who deserve far more than some mention. One is<br />
John Curtin and one is Ben Chifley. I can speak a little about<br />
them because they have gone.<br />
Curtin and Chifley will never be understood until<br />
you realise that they were utterly different. I have never known<br />
two men more unlike. They were great friends but two men more<br />
unlike, I would never expect to see, because Curtin's instincts<br />
were towards a sort of broad philosophical approach to matters.<br />
He liked nothing better than to sit down and put his feet on<br />
the table and have a talk to you about something that didntt bear<br />
on the Bill before the House but bore on the general philosophy<br />
of politics or indeed of the world. He was not the greatest<br />
speaker in the world, with great respect, because he leaned. too<br />
much to long Latin endings which rather blurred the fine edge of<br />
his speech. But he was a very good speaker, of course, and<br />
would have been greater but for that. This was part of his I<br />
so. o./ 8 </p>
<p>0 </p>
<p>8-<br />
makeup. He did have the kind of mind which liked to range over<br />
a wide variety of problems and if he had had the opportunity<br />
in his life of professing one of these subjects in a university,<br />
he would have done it with great distinction. He was, of course,<br />
a charming man, a delightful man, and a good friend.<br />
Chifley was just about the opposite because his<br />
mind didn't range over a wide variety of objects. He dealt with<br />
the economic problems and financial problems. He had had no<br />
preliminary training for them. He achieved a complete mastery<br />
of them. He didn't aspire to be a great speaker because his<br />
voice was against him but he still spoke to the point, and he<br />
was a great man to be able to sit down with and discuss matters<br />
with. I would say that he had immense strength in a narrow<br />
field. Curtin's strength was distributed over a variety of<br />
fields. I think that if John Curtin hadn't had Ben Chifley as<br />
Treasurer, his Government might have fallen earlier or something<br />
else might have fallen out differently. Two utterly different<br />
men. Now, it is easy to say that Chifloy.... well, he<br />
was an enginedriver and he lacked formal education. True<br />
enough, and yet, you know, one of the interesting things about<br />
that man was that I discovered over a period of years that he<br />
had what I thought, at any rate, an almost immaculate literary<br />
judgment. He read widely, his judgment was good, he could<br />
determine what was shoddy and rwht was not. It was an illuminating<br />
experience to sit with him on the Literary Fund when from<br />
time to time we advised about publications and fellowships and<br />
the like. He had clear views, strong views; I thought<br />
tremondously informed and sound views on these matters and it<br />
was entirely to his credit that while I was thinking of some<br />
very periphrastic way of explaining this, you know, so as not<br />
to hurt anybody's feelings, he was quite capable of sitting<br />
up and saying, " Well, if you don't mind, Miss So. and-so, I<br />
think it's all bloody nonsense," ( Laughter) which shows the<br />
immense advantage in life of having for a time been an enginedriver<br />
and not a barrister. ( Laughter)<br />
So there they were, two different men. The Labour<br />
Party, if I may say so, has great reason to be thankful to them<br />
and I venture to say that onch of them in his turn contributed<br />
to making tnis Parliament a place of some distinction. Let me<br />
saLy gentlmen it is a place of some distinction. It has had,<br />
over the whole of its history, a number of men of great<br />
distinction and we do well to recognise that. I get pleasure<br />
out of it as I look back over these thirty years. Indeed, as<br />
I look back over the thirty years and remember all the people<br />
who mattered who emerged like that, I take leave to doubt<br />
whether I will have many happier memories at the end of my<br />
life than recalling them and the work that they did. </p>
