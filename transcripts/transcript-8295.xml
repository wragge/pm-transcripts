SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
PARLIAMENTARY DINNER IN HONOUR OF THE<br />
PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF TURKEY, MR TURGUT OZAL<br />
CANBERRA 9 MAY 1991<br />
President Ozal and Mrs Ozal,<br />
Distinguished Guests,<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
Tonight marks a watershed in the history of relations<br />
between Australia and Turkey.<br />
Mr President, you are the first head of State of the<br />
Republic of Turkey to visit this country, and as such you<br />
are a particularly welcome guest in Australia and in<br />
Canberra. It is indeed an honour to have you here, and it<br />
is a pleasure to be able to return the hospitality that you,<br />
and the people of Turkey, so generously extended to me and<br />
to the large party of Australians who visited your country<br />
in April 1990.<br />
That visit, as you know, was centred on the 75th Anniversary<br />
of the Gallipoli campaign.<br />
With the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the<br />
National Party, I was privileged to visit the shores of<br />
Anzac Cove and the heights of Lone Pine and to do so in<br />
the distinguished company of a number of Australian veterans<br />
of the Gallipoli campaign original ANZACS who despite<br />
their advanced years embody still the courage, the<br />
endurance, the good humour and the sense of service that<br />
today represents, for all Australians, the best of the ANZAC<br />
tradition. Mr President, Turkish and Australian soldiers endured great<br />
hardship and made great sacrifices in the almost<br />
unimaginably difficult campaign that began on 25 April 1915.<br />
It is commonplace to speak of such campaigns as ' senseless'<br />
and certainly, we must ensure that never again will the<br />
nations of the world engage in such costly and short-sighted<br />
conflict. </p>
<p>But it is clear too that those of us on whose behalf that<br />
terrible price was paid not only honour our predecessors<br />
we also recognise that their sacrifice was not in vain.<br />
For Australians, Gallipoli was our coming of age as a nation<br />
a traumatic experience that taught us, and proved to the<br />
world, the quality of our character and the magnitude of our<br />
potential. For Turkey, the campaign was also a milestone on the road to<br />
nationhood; the leadership and skill displayed by Kemal<br />
Ataturk in defending his homeland at Gallipoli paved the way<br />
for his building of the modern state of Turkey.<br />
It may seem paradoxical that a war should lie at the base of<br />
the warm and generous friendship which now exists between<br />
us. But the strong bond between our two countries is a<br />
tangible fact of contemporary life, not merely an artefact<br />
of history.<br />
That truth was so vividly shown last year at Gallipoli,<br />
personified by the emotional reconciliation by veterans of<br />
our two armies.<br />
Mr President, it was because of your own role, through that<br />
visit, in developing relations between Turkey and Australia,<br />
that you were invested yesterday as an Honorary Companion of<br />
the Order of Australia. We congratulate you on that award.<br />
Mr President,<br />
On Anzac Day this year, we in Australia saluted our veterans<br />
of another war the Gulf War.<br />
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on 2 August last year posed a<br />
direct threat to the basic principles of international order<br />
which we uphold. It threatened to take from our grasp the<br />
great hopes which we held, in the wake of the Cold War's<br />
conclusion, for a saner and safer world.<br />
Saddam Hussein violated those principles but he faced a<br />
world newly but tenaciously committed to upholding them.<br />
It was in the most basic sense an issue that affected all<br />
nations Australia, distant from the Middle East/ Gulf<br />
region; Turkey, immediately proximate to it and a neighbour<br />
of Iraq.<br />
Australians are proud of the contribution that we made to<br />
the success of the multinational response to this challenge.<br />
Proud as we are, Mr President, it is a matter for deep<br />
satisfaction to be able to tell you how much we appreciated<br />
and respected the contribution of Turkey to our common<br />
cause. </p>
<p>As a front-line state, Turkey's role in achieving a<br />
successful outcome was critical; its support for the<br />
multilateral coalition was vital.<br />
By actively supporting the sanctions regime imposed on Iraq,<br />
Turkey suffered much more than most in particular, through<br />
the crucial closure of the pipeline carrying Iraqi oil to<br />
the Mediterranean. Later, when it came to war, Turkey's<br />
assistance to allied military efforts helped ensure their<br />
success, and. helped shorten the conflict.<br />
Although the war itself is over, there remains much to be<br />
done before we are able to say that peace and stability has<br />
returned to the region.<br />
The spirit of multinational cooperation which reversed<br />
Iraq's aggression in Kuwait must be sustained and entrenched<br />
if we are effectively to tackle and to resolve the<br />
deepseated problems of the region and of the global<br />
community. Foremost in our minds is the plight of the refugees fleeing<br />
persecution in Iraq. The outflow of refugees from Saddam's<br />
regime provided yet another challenge to the world.<br />
Australia has played its part in the global endeavour to<br />
contain the massive dimensions of this human tragedy.<br />
Again, however, it must be recognised: Turkey's contribution<br />
to the handling of this new crisis has been vital.<br />
Beyond this profound humanitarian challenge lies the great<br />
question of how to so order the affairs of the world as to<br />
build on the progress of recent years the conclusion of<br />
the Cold War; the warmer superpower relationship; the<br />
negotiated agreements for disarmament; the resolution of a<br />
number of regional conflicts; the upholding of the Charter<br />
of the United Nations in the Gulf War.<br />
Middle power diplomacy, which we both practise, will be a<br />
key element of the foundations upon which such progress can<br />
be constructed and Turkey, at the crossroads of Europe and<br />
the Middle East, is well placed to contribute to both<br />
regions during the years ahead.<br />
There is cause to hope that the spirit of cooperation<br />
witnessed during recent months may pave the way for a<br />
broader understanding of the possibilities of cooperation.<br />
But there will be no easy solutions to the long-standing<br />
problems which remain.<br />
Mr President:<br />
Without doubt one such issue is the dispute in Cyprus. As<br />
we discussed in our talks this morning, this is an issue on<br />
which Australia and Turkey differ. </p>
<p>As you know, Mr President, Australia has consistently upheld<br />
UN Security Council resolutions 541, 550 and 649. We uphold<br />
the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of<br />
Cyprus. We have consistently expressed opposition to the<br />
unilateral declaration of the Turkish Republic of Northern<br />
Cyprus in 1983.<br />
We have also been extensively involved in efforts to restore<br />
peace in Cyprus through our assistance to the United Nations<br />
peacekeeping force. Our position is that all parties should<br />
achieve a solution in accordance with the mediation of the<br />
United Nations Secretary-General.<br />
Mr President, we fully recognise your important personal<br />
role in these issues and the consistent support that you<br />
have expressed for a resolution of this problem in<br />
accordance with the principles articulated by the United<br />
Nations Secretary-General. We recognise Turkey's interest<br />
in and influence on this question, and we urge all parties<br />
to participate constructively and openly in inter-communal<br />
negotiations. In our discussions this morning I also raised Australia's<br />
concerns about reports relating to human rights in Turkey.<br />
As you know Australia takes a consistent approach to human<br />
rights world wide.<br />
While noting our concerns, I also acknowledge your own<br />
personal efforts to improve human rights in your country,<br />
including the recent package of important legislative<br />
reforms, which we see as an important positive move on this<br />
issue. Mr President<br />
Yesterday you inspected the Snowy Mountains Scheme, to see<br />
whether it can help you with the Greater Anatolian Project<br />
underway in Turkey.<br />
Australia has the experience and expertise in engineering,<br />
irrigation and agricultural technologies available to assist<br />
Turkey in that project if you wish. There is the potential<br />
for benefits to be derived by both countries. Austrade has<br />
already received the support of the Turkish Government in<br />
assisting with the provision of services and technology to<br />
the project.<br />
In trade too, there is the potential for further expansion.<br />
Both our Governments have achieved substantial restructuring<br />
of our national economies, to make our countries more<br />
efficient and effective competitors in international<br />
markets. I pay tribute to your own leadership in the<br />
process of reforming the Turkish economy. </p>
<p>The liberalisation of international markets is essential to<br />
both our economies. Like Australia, Turkey has suffered<br />
from the distortion of third country markets, resulting from<br />
EC arnd US export subsidies. We are well aware of the<br />
potential for stagnation of the world economy, and for the<br />
strangulation of our own economies, should these policies<br />
continue. We urge EC leaders to show the political will and<br />
strength to reach a satisfactory resolution of the Uruguay<br />
Round. The wellbeing of both our countries depend on this.<br />
Mr President,<br />
For all the importance of the other issues I have discussed<br />
so far, the links between our two countries are best<br />
exemplified and maintained by the presence in Australia of a<br />
large and vibrant Turkish community.<br />
Australia is proud that, in particular since World War II,<br />
we have attracted to our shores millions of new settlers<br />
from more than 130 nations around the world.<br />
In 1967 Turkey and Australia signed an agreement to<br />
facilitate the migration of Turks to Australia. Some 40,000<br />
Turkish people have since come to settle in Australia.<br />
Let me say Mr President that these new members of the<br />
Australian community are welcome among us.<br />
We have been enriched by their contribution to our<br />
multicultural society. And we respect the way in which they<br />
have contributed to our society and economy while also<br />
keeping alive the traditions of the Turkish language and<br />
culture. That thousands of Turkish settlers have realised their<br />
dreams for themselves and their children in this country,<br />
while carefully guarding their immense Turkish heritage,<br />
should be, and is, a matter of great satisfaction to the<br />
vast majority of the Australian people.<br />
Mr President,<br />
Australia is truly a land of immigrants. Well over one in<br />
five Australians were born in another country. Over one in<br />
ten Australians came to Australia from a country where<br />
English is not the principal language. Overseas-born<br />
Australians and their children now form some 40 per cent of<br />
our population.<br />
Within this diversity, it is important that all Australians<br />
be able to express and share their individual cultural<br />
heritage, to practise their religion, to speak their<br />
language. It is also important that all Australians be<br />
treated equally, without disadvantage because of race,<br />
culture, religion, language, gender or other reason. </p>
<p>6.<br />
Within this diversity, too, it is important that all<br />
Australians unite around an overriding commitment to<br />
Australia, to its institutions, its interests and its<br />
future. There must be understanding and trust between our<br />
many communities in Australia as we work and live together.<br />
Integral to this vision of a multicultural society is the<br />
political freedom of all Australians to express their views<br />
including their views about events in their old homelands.<br />
But we do not see Australia as a place in which communal<br />
rivalries and divisions of the old world should be played<br />
out in a new community.<br />
Certainly, Australia does not conduct its foreign policy on<br />
any basis other than what we Judge to be best for Australia<br />
and for all Australians.<br />
Mr President,<br />
I have looked forward to your visit since my visit to Turkey<br />
last year. I welcome this opportunity to discuss world<br />
events with you and to advance the relationship between our<br />
countries. In once more welcoming you I express the hope that the<br />
friendship between Turkey and Australia will continue to<br />
prosper and to deliver increasing benefits to both our<br />
peoples and countries. </p>
