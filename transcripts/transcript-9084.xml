PRIME MINISTER 148/ 93<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
NATIVE TITLE BILL GOVERNMENT AMENDMENTS<br />
The Government this morning circulated a number of carefully considered proposed<br />
amendments to the Native Title BUi.<br />
The amendments have been prepared for several reasons:<br />
I a number respond to the recommendations of the Senate Legal and<br />
Constitutional Affairs Committee's report on the Bill<br />
U a number respond to legitimate concerns put to the Government by Aboriginal<br />
interests.<br />
HI a number are merely technical improvements or clarifications.<br />
TV importantly. other proposed amendments involve fine tuning of land<br />
management processes arising from the Bill and in particular are designed to<br />
make even clearer the certainty the Bill provides to economic interests and<br />
other g~ rant holders, on such matters as renewal of pastoral and mining leases.<br />
The proposed Government amendments take into account a wide range of views and<br />
interests across all sectors of the community. They represent as does the Bill itself a<br />
balanced package. They all improve the Bill.<br />
The Opposition's strategy of blanket opposition to all Government amendments is<br />
counter-productive and against the interests of all Australians, including industry<br />
groups and Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders.<br />
The fact that the Opposition announced their strategy this morning. prior to circulation<br />
of the Government amendments, proves that they are not prepared to consider theseamendments<br />
and indeed the provisions of the legislation as a whole. on tneir mer-its.<br />
Their approach sells out the very interests they claim to be representing.<br />
