PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA WEDNESDAY, 23 SEPTEMBER, 1981<br />
SUPPLIES FOR ANGURUGU<br />
RAAF aircraft will fly out of Darwin today to transport<br />
essential food and medical supplies to the Angurugu<br />
Aboriginal settlement on Groote Eylandt.<br />
The Government has agreed to the urgent request for<br />
assistance by the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory<br />
Government. The people of Angurugu have been cut off by the current<br />
Marine Engineers dispute. Barges which normally deliver<br />
supplies to the island have been held by union action at<br />
Weipa and Cairns.<br />
Despite three requests, the last of these this morning, the<br />
union has refused to release the barge from Weipa which could<br />
have delivered these essential supplies within 28 hours.<br />
The situation at Angurugu has been described as desperate<br />
and local medical personnel say there is a real danger<br />
for community health. About 3,500 kilograms of essential<br />
Å“ supplies including baby food will be taken to Angurugu.<br />
The Government is not prepared to allow the welfare of this<br />
isolated community to be put in jeopardy by industrial<br />
disputation. 000---</p>
