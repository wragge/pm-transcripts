CIECY AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
aAUST RALI<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE RT. HON. WILLIAM<br />
McMAHON, CH, MP, IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,<br />
CANBERRA<br />
NATIONAL URBAN AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT<br />
AUTHORITY BILL 11 OCTOBER 1972<br />
I move that the Bill be now read a second time.<br />
On 19 September, I made a statement to the House<br />
announcing that the Government proposed to take new initiatives<br />
to work with the States towards urban and regional development<br />
objectives. I said that the Government had decided that it will<br />
take immediate stens financially and in other ways in a co-ordinated<br />
programme with the State Governments.<br />
The introduction of this bill fulfils the commitment<br />
I then gave to introduce interim legislation into Parliament this<br />
session. Although the lecgislation is interim, the new authority<br />
set up by the bill will nevertheless be required to operate with<br />
vigour and in accord with its charter from the outset.<br />
In a vast country which is developing as rapidly<br />
as Australia, it is most important that the Government take<br />
responsible action which will influence the distribution of<br />
population and economic activity to the economic and social<br />
advantage of the nation.<br />
The stresses and strains of growth are having an<br />
impact on the living conditions and the environment of the entire<br />
Australian community. These-pressures which are being felt in<br />
many countries, present issues of national moment warranting<br />
co-operative action between the Commonwealth and the States. We<br />
have the experience of the United Kingdom, France and Canada amongst<br />
others to draw on. The Government believes that unless we ermbark on a<br />
vigorous, imaginative and responsible programme of urban and regional<br />
development, in partnership with the States, our efforts to secure<br />
a better quality of life for the Australian community through a wide<br />
variety of existing programmes will he compromised. / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
The consequences of the imabalance caused by the<br />
concentration of population and employment around the principal<br />
Australian cities with the resulting problems of congestion and<br />
pollution are such that action must now be taken.<br />
The trend to increasing concentration is already<br />
evident to a degree which is causing concern. If no action is<br />
taken, the problem will become more acute as our population<br />
grows from 13 million to possibly 22 million over the balance of<br />
the century. The increasing concentration of population in our<br />
great cities will magnify the consequences of increasing population<br />
growth. It is the geographical distribution of population and<br />
industry rather than total scale which calls for our attention.<br />
We believe it is widely accepted that these are<br />
national problems requiring urgent attention, and that the<br />
Commonwealth should participate with the States in solving<br />
them. We believe that a properly conceived and well<br />
managed programme of urban and regional development will be<br />
approved and welcomed by the community generally.<br />
It is clear that the Commonwealth and States<br />
must work together. It is also clear that there will be a need<br />
for additional expenditure and the Commonwealth stands ready<br />
to contribute its share.<br />
As, importantly, we will shape our own policies<br />
and programmes where appropriate so as to ensure that urban and<br />
regional implications are fully taken into account. The<br />
implementation of a successful national programme of urban and<br />
regional development could mark a turning point in the social and<br />
economic life of this country.<br />
Our efforts must be successful. Therefore, they<br />
must be properly conceived.<br />
The Commonwealth/ State Officials' Committee on<br />
Decentralisation which conducted its researches in the Australian<br />
context concluded that the only type of decentralisation which<br />
offers significant prospects of success is selective decentralisation.<br />
As stated on 19 September, the Commonwealth<br />
endorses this conclusion and favours the development of a small<br />
number of carefully selected centres, having regard to factors likely<br />
to be favourable to their gro. wth.<br />
Later on, with -he benefit of more experience and<br />
the availability of more resonrces, it can be expected that<br />
additional centres will be selected for accelerated growth. We<br />
will want to identify and encourage the balanced growth of submetropolitan<br />
centres as an a. ternative to growth in the existing<br />
city areas. / 3 </p>
<p>' 14p </p>
<p>In co-operation with the States, we will look for<br />
those sub-metropolitan centres that offer the greatest potential<br />
for rapid development. These will be centres near to but distinct<br />
from the existing major cities.<br />
It is our view that the development of regional<br />
growth centres and sub-metropolitan centres projects capable of<br />
being defined, programmed and financed offers the most direct<br />
and beneficial means of immediate Commonwealth involvement.<br />
As I have emphasised, however, the action to be<br />
taken must be taken in consultation and partnership with the<br />
States. Our early discussions with the States will have as their<br />
first objectiv the fullest urderstanding of the nature of the<br />
problems to be overcome. We will be seeking tc establish how best the<br />
combined resources of the Commonwealth and State Governments<br />
can be marshalled to tackle these in an economic way and in the<br />
interests of the nation as a whole.<br />
As I have said previously, it will be necessary to<br />
guard against the cost of development of selected centres being<br />
inflated by increases in land values directly attributable to<br />
the policy initiatives of the States and the Commonwealth.<br />
This bill is the first ston towards implementation of a new<br />
Commonwealth initiative. It is, however, designed to establish the National<br />
Urban and Regional Development Authority on a oroper and sound<br />
basis and to enable it to commence its work immediately. The<br />
nature of any later legislation will, of course, be determined in<br />
the light of experience. Nevertheless, the name given to the<br />
Authority clearly indicates the Government's longer term intent.<br />
We are concerned with national objectives in urban<br />
and regional development and we are concerned with development<br />
itself. Ours is a practical approach and the concept of a statutory<br />
authority and of the title chosen for it reflects our practical aims.<br />
It is proposed that the Authority be constituted by<br />
a Commissioner. I have already announced that with the oassage<br />
of the legislation, the Government proposes to invite Sir John<br />
Overall to serve as the first Commissioner and to guide the new<br />
organisation in its initial establishment period.<br />
The Government is fortunate in having a person<br />
as experienced and so able as Sir John to call on until his<br />
retirement in July next year.<br />
The bill also proviles for the Commissioner to be<br />
assisted by a Deputy Commissioner. The appointment of statutory<br />
office holders will be effected as so on as possible after the<br />
bill is passed. The duties of the Authority are stated in Clause 12.<br />
It will be required to investigate and report to the Prime Minister<br />
3 / 4 </p>
<p>4--<br />
on matters relating to urban or regional devclopment. This<br />
investigation and ;!~ lvice would be desiqnel to assist the Government<br />
in making decis. o: ns having urban and ragional implications.<br />
It will also be designed to assist the Government in<br />
its consideration of the grant of financial assistance to a State<br />
in connection with urban or regional development.<br />
Such matters zas the selection of centres f or the<br />
promrotion of rapid growth, the particular stops by which this might<br />
be encouraged, Practical arrangements for ranid develonment, and<br />
financial questions including the scale of Commonwealth supportF<br />
are relevant to the establishment of a co-or* dinated progratmme.<br />
Advice woculd! bfe available to the Government from<br />
the Authority on the terms an6 co-nuitions on which finincial<br />
assistance for urban ana regional develomment might be granted by<br />
Parliament. The bill ,-rovides for the Authority to have power<br />
to do all things that are necessary or convenient for the performance<br />
of its functions. It may undertake nilot or experimental projects,<br />
studies, including feasibility studies. It may enter into consultative<br />
engagements with professional crrounps and Ge-v, rnment agencies,<br />
and provide information and a( dAvic2 to other authorities.<br />
Provision is mad e in the Bill br the Authority to<br />
comply with any O. irections qivi~ n &gt;-the Prim_-minister with respect<br />
to maltrs to be invest igated bythe Authority. This clause will<br />
ensure, for examni; le, that -1ecisions reached by the 1r1inisterial<br />
Council, consisting of tlhe Prime Minister and the Epremiers, to which<br />
I referred in my statement in this House on 19 Sentember, are<br />
followved through in the o~ perations of the Au-th1ority.<br />
In addition to the norma. provision for an annual<br />
rczport, the Authority is required to report to the: Prime Minister<br />
not later than 30 June 1973 on matters relating to urban and. regional<br />
development during the five-yoar T.) eriod thc-reaftar.<br />
It is not the ' 1ovevrnment'-s interntion thp~ t the_<br />
Authority should produce th time a definitive Stato. ment on a<br />
national urban and regqional cevcoont strategy. The Governmient<br />
does, however, propose to rmova Jin an expnendiUture seanse commencing<br />
fro~ m the financial year 1973/ 7,1. It will be the resi~ onsibility of the<br />
: Iu t ho r ity, therefore, to advis the -Government in time-L for its<br />
Budcaet considerations in 1973 of the broad directicn in which<br />
Commonwealth activities in urban and regional kdevelopment might<br />
be sha'e-O over the f ive-vyear perioO. Th'Lis will not be a final<br />
bluonrint but rather the f-irqt stateme= nt of aun active--nrogramme.<br />
The stceps involved in its rre'-ration -will be discussed by the<br />
Ministerial Council. Funds will be' made available during this<br />
present financilal year 1972/ 73 ' or the initial operations of the<br />
A uthority. The Pill, inf course, contains aporonriate provisions<br />
relating to officers' rights, staff, audit and finance. </p>
<p>The Bill establishes an Advisory Committee of up to<br />
twelve members including the Commissioner. The Committee will be<br />
comprised of persons who, by virtue of their knowledge and experience,<br />
can assist the Authority in the performance of its duties. This is<br />
a formal Committee created by the Statute with membership appointed<br />
by the Prime Minister and designed to ensure the availability of a<br />
wide range of advice and response to the Authority.<br />
At the level of Governments, I have already mentioned<br />
that we propose tho e! 3t. ablishment of a Ministeria'l Council consisting<br />
of the Prime Minister and Premierzs as the-orincipal body for<br />
consultation and co-ordination in the field. -f urban and regional<br />
development. I have alroady written to the Premiers about the<br />
Commonwealth'~ s intentiono.<br />
Members havct already noted from my remarks that the<br />
Authority will be responsible to me as Prime Minister. This central<br />
place in the machinery of Government will add strength to the discussions<br />
between me and my State colleagues.<br />
Mr Speaker, this Bill is amongst the most important<br />
legislation introduced into the Federal Parliament during the postwar<br />
years. It marks our recognition that there is a direct contribution<br />
that the Commonwealth Government can make in national urban and<br />
regional development for the benefit of all Australians. Commonwealth<br />
assistance for urban and regional development is not new. What is<br />
new is Commonwealth participation with th~ e states in a co-ordinated<br />
programme of urban and regional development.<br />
Our objectives will not be achieved easily or overnight.<br />
But it is imnortant to make a start in the prevailing climate of<br />
accord about the need for new initiatives and the broad nature of<br />
them. We will pursue these objectiv2s vigorously.<br />
I commend the Bill to the House. </p>
