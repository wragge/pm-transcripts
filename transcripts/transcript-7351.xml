PRIME MINISTER CANDARA<br />
MESSAGE FOR THE BICENTENNIAL PROFESSIONAL ENGINEERS'<br />
WEEK 1988<br />
1 welcome the opportunity to provide a message for<br />
Professional Engineers' Week.<br />
My Government has placed much emphasis on the need for<br />
Australian manufacturing industry to become more<br />
internationally competitive. The development of<br />
policies designed to promote this international<br />
competitiveness has brought with it en awareness of the<br />
crucial part to be played by the engineering profession<br />
in this process.<br />
Along with this awareness of the role to be played by<br />
the engineering profession has come an acceptance that<br />
being an engineer entails much more than was previously<br />
expected. In the modern international economy it is no<br />
longer sufficient to design and build a product.<br />
Engineering firms have to know how to market their<br />
products and skills. They must have the willingness to<br />
meet increasingly stringent client requirements and the<br />
flexibility to keep ahead of a rapidly changing<br />
technical end competitive environment.<br />
in this Bicentennial Year, it is appropriate for all<br />
Australians to acknowledge the contribution of<br />
engineers, past and present, to the development of this<br />
country. I believe their future role to be even more<br />
important. R J L Hawke 1561 </p>
