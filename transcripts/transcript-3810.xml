JjAUST ALIA.<br />
PRIME MINISTER Press Statement No. 528<br />
1 July 1975<br />
DR CAIRNS<br />
Yesterday I was shown a letter in the following<br />
terms:-" SECRET ( CREST) TREASURER Parliament House,<br />
Canberra 2600.<br />
March 7, 1975.<br />
Alco International Pty. Ltd.,<br />
6 Southam Court,<br />
BULLEEN, Vic. 3105<br />
Attention: Mr George Harris<br />
Dear Sir,<br />
The Australidi Wvghmoui i itk d ih v hq<br />
available loan funds from overseas. In the event of<br />
a successful negotiation which may be introduced or<br />
arranged by you, and provided the interest rate for<br />
a term loan does not exceed 8% per annum in total,<br />
we would be prepared to pay a once only brokerage fee<br />
of 2 deducted at the source to you and/ or your nominees.<br />
We would need to be satisfied about the sources of the<br />
funds and the size of the loan would have to be appropriate<br />
to our needs.<br />
Yours sincerely,<br />
( Signed) J. F. CAIRNS SECRET"<br />
On the face of it this letter is inconsistent with a<br />
reply which Dr Cairns gave in the House of Representatives on<br />
4 June 1975 ( Hansard, p. 3294):-</p>
<p>2<br />

" OVERSEAS LOAN<br />
Mr LYNCH I ask the Treasurer: Did he, in a<br />
letter dated on or about 5 March, offer a commission<br />
of 2 per cent on any loan money<br />
arranged by the recipient of the letter or his<br />
company? Dr J. F. CAIRNS The answer is no. At no<br />
stage did I offer a commission of 2 or any<br />
other amount or give any authority whatever<br />
to any person to do anything other than make<br />
inquiries. Mr Malcolm Fraser No brokerage fee?<br />
Dr J. F. CAIRNS No brokerage fee. Would<br />
O the honoirable member like to ask more questions?"<br />
O I have asked Dr Cairns to give me a written<br />
explanation of the discrepancy tomorrow.<br />
I have also told Dr Cairns that Mr Phillip Cairns'<br />
reported activities concerning housing projects in the<br />
Melbourne metropolitan area would make it possible for him<br />
to make a profit from his position on Dr Cairns' staff.<br />
A: = tted in evidence to the Joint Parliamentary<br />
Committee on e Pecuniary Interests of Members of the<br />
Parliament, Z rezard it as improper for ministerial staff to<br />
put thems.. es Dr allow themselves to be put, in such a<br />
position. nave therefore asked Dr Cairns to give me a<br />
written exl-a-=: ion of this matter also tomorrow.<br />
