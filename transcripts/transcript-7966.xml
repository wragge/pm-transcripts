S541 George Street<br />
WSYDNEY NSW 2000<br />
Dear Carl<br />
The Federation of Ethnic Communities' Councils of Australia<br />
( FECCA) recently issued a news release indicating the<br />
priority issues for 1990 and seeking the views of political<br />
parties. Outlined below are the policies of the Australian Labor<br />
Party on each of those issues.<br />
I should be grateful if you could bring this response to the<br />
attention of your members, and advise themi accordingly.<br />
aIssun 1. Preservation and enhancement of multiculturalism<br />
Wi. e. equitable participation, fair go, fair share, fair say<br />
for Australians froma ethnic backgrounds.<br />
As I indicated forcefully when I launched the Labor<br />
Government's policy on Immigration, Ethnic Affairs and<br />
Mu. Lticulturalism on Thursday, my Government is totally<br />
committed to the importance of multicultural policies<br />
to manage our ethnic diversity in the best interest of<br />
all Australians. It is for this reason that I launched<br />
last year a National Agenda for a Multicultural<br />
Australia with concrete initiatives funded at $ 89m. My<br />
Government believes in ensuring that migrants are able<br />
to participate equitably in our society as soon as<br />
possible and for that reason is totally opposed to<br />
Coalition plans to extend the length of residence<br />
required for citizenship from two to four years. </p>
<p>Isang Ensuring all publicly funded services respect and<br />
recognise Australia's culturally diverse population and<br />
their organisations as integral part. of Australian<br />
community services.<br />
My Government is proud that In 1986 it implemented an<br />
Access and Equity atrategy to ensure that all<br />
Australians gain equal accss to culturally-appropriate.<br />
services. Nearly all Government departments have now<br />
produced their first Access and Equity plans and will<br />
be obliged to report on their initiatives in their<br />
Annual Reports. Some $ 2.9m over three years has been<br />
set aside for initiatives in the areas of community<br />
services and health, local government and consumer<br />
education. Grants have been provided to ethnic<br />
community organisations, including FECCA, to help<br />
ensure that Government services and programs recognise<br />
Australia's culturally diverse population.<br />
Isue Giving equality of opportunity and protection from<br />
all forms of discrimination to Australian women of<br />
non-English speaking background.<br />
Australian women of non-English speaking background<br />
often face a double disadvantage in gaining equality of<br />
opportunity. It is for that reason that my Government<br />
established the Non-English Speaking Background Women's<br />
Council in August 1989 and has recently increased its<br />
annual budget by 25% to allow greater involvement by<br />
community organisat ions.<br />
~ us 4-Ensuring that Australians of non-English speaking<br />
background have a more equitable share in training and<br />
retraining opportunities.<br />
In one of the Government's major decisions in the<br />
multicultural area, we recently established at a cost<br />
of $ 7 million over three years, the National Office of<br />
Overseas Skills Recognition ( NOOSR) to ease the<br />
accreditation of overseas experience and skills for<br />
migrants. This year NOOSR expects to spend $ 2.2m on<br />
bridging courses for 500 oversas-trained<br />
professionals. -It has also ensured that training<br />
opportunities have been equally available to<br />
-6-non-English speaking background Australians and that<br />
English language training has been provided as part of<br />
the necessary retraining of our workforce. </p>
<p>1Zsmza Recognise, support and integrate the self-help<br />
efforts of ethnic communities to provide for the specific<br />
needs of their members, particularly the elderly.<br />
My Government is fully committed to ensuring that the<br />
elderly of ethnic communities are able to live in<br />
dignity. In 1986 a four year $ 40 million package was<br />
earmarked for residential care for ethnic older people<br />
and this level of support has since been increased to<br />
million.<br />
16= 0_&amp; L, The further development of the National Policy on<br />
Languages with a clear priority on English for all,<br />
community languages, wider availability of language<br />
services. I am extremely proud of the fact that I introduced<br />
Australia's first National Policy on Languages in 1987.<br />
In my next term that policy will be further developed.<br />
In particular the Fourth Hawke Government will continue<br />
to support a balanced program of second language<br />
teaching including community languages. It will also<br />
establish a National Bureau of Language Services to<br />
provide better interpreter and language services across<br />
the nation.<br />
18ant2a 7. giving the Special Broadcasting service its own<br />
legislative base and charter adequate public funding; to<br />
oppose commmrcialisation; to extend viewing areas.<br />
My Government will provide the SES with its own<br />
legislative base and charter committing it to<br />
multicultural and multi-lingual broadcasting. At a<br />
capital cost of $ 25 million SOS TV will be<br />
progressively extended to the La Trobe Valley, Bendigo,<br />
Ballarat, Darling Downs, Darwin, Spencer Gulf,<br />
North-east Tasmania, Cairns and Townsville. A new<br />
three-year initiative will, through the Public<br />
Broadcasting Foundation, provide an extra $ 1.4 million<br />
funding annually to SBS radio and public broadcasting<br />
stations to establish a networked ethnic news and<br />
current affairs service to serve ethnic communities<br />
both in the cities and rural area.<br />
-lawje. L.. Maintaining the Office of Multicultural Affairs to<br />
advise the Prime Minister directly and be responsible to<br />
him. The Hawke Labor Government set up the Office of<br />
Multicultural Affairs ( OMA) in 1987. The Office has<br />
justified its creation in the most comprehensive and<br />
convincing way and will remain in my Department and<br />
report directly to me. </p>
<p>œ aSSze.. 9-Ensuring the continued existence of the Human<br />
Rights and Equal opportunity Commission in particular its<br />
services to non-English speaking background Australians in<br />
the area of Human and Legal Rights.<br />
we are opposed to Coalition plans to abolish the<br />
Commission. Under Labor the Human Rights and Equal<br />
Opportunity Commission will be maintained as an<br />
independent statutory body. It has played an important<br />
role for non-English speaking background Australians.<br />
Its National Enquiry into Racist Violence will underpin<br />
the Governent's commitment of 85.7 million for<br />
improved commuunity relations to which, unfortunately,<br />
the Coalition has expressed opposition.<br />
I99110 -J10-Ensuring the continued existence of the Australia<br />
Council and its programs for non-English speaking background<br />
Australian artworkers and artists.<br />
My Government will continue to support the Australia<br />
0 Council and in particular its efforts to ensure equal<br />
access for artists from non-English speaking background<br />
grants. The Council has this year received a 6 per<br />
cent increase in funding for its Arts for a<br />
Multicultural Australia Program. it is deeply<br />
regrettable that the opposition proposes to abolish the<br />
Australia Council.<br />
nsne_. L Tidying up the regulations of the Immigration Act<br />
to ensure the rights of Australian citizens and residents<br />
are not infringed.<br />
My Government is committed to the overhaul of the<br />
outdated Immigration Act and to the introduction of new<br />
regulations designed to improve the fairness,<br />
consistency and openness of the operation of migration<br />
policy. To the extent that there remain unintended<br />
consequences to the new regulations they will be<br />
changed. Some 200,000 has recently been set aside to<br />
establish a free advice service on the new regulations<br />
at Migrant Resource Centres in our capital cities.<br />
7su. 2, L Supporting a vigorous Immigration program which is<br />
non-discriminatory in terms of race and creed, and which<br />
gives clear and sensitive priority to family reunion and<br />
huma~ nitarian grounds.<br />
I am totally committed, no matter what the political<br />
cost, to maintaining a non-discriminatory immigration<br />
program. My Government will continue to ensure that<br />
family reunion and refugee migration comprise the<br />
largest portion of the intake. We are opposed to<br />
Coalition plans to reduce the proportion of family<br />
migrants. </p>
<p>u<br />
L~ a~ AL.. Ensuring that the expenditure savings of<br />
million forecast by the Coalition Parties' Economic Action<br />
Plan must not disadvantage applicants under the Family<br />
Reunion Program or special humanitarian programs.<br />
My Government is totally opposed to slashing<br />
million that might otherwise be spent on settlement<br />
services. It is equally appalled at the Coalition'sa<br />
proposal to prevent migrants having access to social<br />
security and invalidity pensions and unemployment<br />
benef its in their first year in Australia.<br />
Lot me say in conclusion that I look forward to working with<br />
FECCA, and other key ethnic organisations in my fourth term<br />
as Prime Minister.<br />
Together we can build a fair, just and tolerant Australia<br />
for our children and grandchildren.<br />
Yours sincerely<br />
R J L Hawks </p>
