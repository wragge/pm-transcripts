The Prime Minister, Mr. Menzies, said today that the<br />
Governor-General now approved the 30th September as the date<br />
on which Part II of the Australian National University Act<br />
should come into operation.<br />
The Prime Minister recalled that the legisla-tion,<br />
which was passed in the last session of Parliament, provided<br />
for the association of the Australian National University and<br />
the Canberra University College, but left open the date from<br />
whiich this association would formally operate. The effect of<br />
the Governor-General's proclamation is that the Canberra<br />
University College and the Australian National University would<br />
become one institution from the 30th September.<br />

authorities expected that the new Council of the Australian<br />
National University would meet for the first time on the<br />
September. It is necessary for the Council to meet on the<br />
first day of association to maintain continuity and to make<br />
certain formal arrangements necessary for the administration of<br />
the new i. istitution.<br />
