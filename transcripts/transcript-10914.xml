<p>Well to the Mayor, Tony Zappia, of the City of Salisbury, to my Federal</p>
<p> Parliamentary colleague, Trish Draper, other distinguished guests,</p>
<p> ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p>I finally have found out, Trish, where that photograph of you and</p>
<p> I with the Crows scarf has ended up. And she promised me that it would</p>
<p> end up in the bar of this particular bowling club and I've found</p>
<p> that this morning she is very much a person of her word.</p>
<p>Can I start by saying that I am very pleased indeed to be here at</p>
<p> the City of Salisbury. I'm particularly happy to be in Trish's</p>
<p> electorate. And I do take the opportunity of telling all of you as</p>
<p> citizens of this area just what a tremendous hardworking Federal Member</p>
<p> you have in Trish Draper.</p>
<p>Local political representation these days is less about your party</p>
<p> allegiance, although that's important, and it is increasingly</p>
<p> about the quality of personal representation that you bring. And a</p>
<p> local member who is in touch with her constituency, a local member</p>
<p> who understands that this electorate has a very significant number</p>
<p> of retired people, it has a lot of people who are concerned about</p>
<p> community services, it has people who are concerned about the stability</p>
<p> and quality of family life - somebody who understands those things</p>
<p> and communicates those concerns to her parliamentary colleagues is</p>
<p> a very effective representative of the district.</p>
<p>In our system of government, of course, we have a division of responsibilities</p>
<p> between the Local Government, the State Government and the Federal</p>
<p> Government. Sometimes you get some lines blurred on the edges where</p>
<p> there is concurrent responsibility and there are some things that</p>
<p> are unquestionably our responsibility at a national level. And one</p>
<p> of the things that we undeniably have total responsibility for is</p>
<p> the overall state of the Australian economy.</p>
<p>I was very happy yesterday to open the runway extension to Adelaide's</p>
<p> airport. And those runway extensions are going to give a very vital</p>
<p> new trading link and commercial link between the city of Adelaide</p>
<p> and the people of South Australia and those very important export</p>
<p> markets in South East Asia. And it's another illustration of</p>
<p> our commitment as a Government to building infrastructure within the</p>
<p> Australian community. Australia is a very big country. And no matter</p>
<p> who is in power, federally or State, and no matter what your politics</p>
<p> are you must recognise we need to spend money on public infrastructure.</p>
<p>We committed ourselves and we were the first Federal Government in</p>
<p> the history of Australia to commit ourselves to support the construction</p>
<p> of the Darwin to Alice Springs Railway. Now that particular project</p>
<p> is very important to South Australia. It's very important to</p>
<p> the Northern Territory. But let me tell you, as a Sydney boy, it's</p>
<p> something that people that all over Australia regard as a very important</p>
<p> element of nation building. And nation building includes a commitment</p>
<p> to valuable public infrastructure. And the Adelaide airport extension</p>
<p> and the Darwin to Alice Springs Railway are examples of the commitment</p>
<p> of the Government to that public infrastructure.</p>
<p>The Government's other commitments in the area of making the</p>
<p> economy run well obviously include following the right policies to</p>
<p> protect Australia from the impact of the Asian economic down-turn.</p>
<p> Now you all know about that, you've all read about it and it</p>
<p> is the most significant economic downturn that those countries have</p>
<p> experienced in something like 30 or 40 years. The Japanese economy,</p>
<p> so important to Australia because Japan is Australia's largest</p>
<p> overseas market, our best customer. Japan buys more from Australia</p>
<p> than any other country by far and the country that buys the next largest</p>
<p> quantity of goods and services from Australia is Korea. And those</p>
<p> two countries together, Japan and Korea, make up over 30% of the total</p>
<p> export market of Australia. So what happens in that part of the world</p>
<p> does affect us. We can't say well we don't want to know</p>
<p> you, we don't want to have anything to do with you because that's</p>
<p> unrealistic. And we have to understand that it does have an impact</p>
<p> on us. And what we have tried to do over the last two-and-a-quarter</p>
<p> years is to make sure that the Australian economy is strong enough</p>
<p> and resilient enough so that the impact from Asia is less than it</p>
<p> would otherwise be. We can't stop it having any impact, that's</p>
<p> quite unrealistic, but what we've done over the last two-and-a-quarter</p>
<p> years is to reduce, very markedly, the impact. And things would have</p>
<p> been a lot worse from Asia over the last year if we hadn't taken</p>
<p> some of the measures we've taken. I know some of those measures</p>
<p> have been criticised but when you put them all together they have</p>
<p> in fact given Australia a strength and protection that we wouldn't</p>
<p> otherwise have had.</p>
<p>There is a lot of discussion at the moment about our plans to change</p>
<p> Australia's taxation system. Many of you have spoken to me about</p>
<p> it this morning. And the details of that policy are going to be out</p>
<p> very soon and we are very close to completing those details. We do</p>
<p> need a better system for Australia's sake. Not for the sake of</p>
<p> the Liberal Party or the sake of the Government or the sake of John</p>
<p> Howard or Peter Costello. We want a new and better system in this</p>
<p> country because it will be good for Australia. It will be a fairer</p>
<p> system and it was one of those things that will help make us even</p>
<p> stronger against the impact of the Asian economic downturn.</p>
<p>I mean, what your Government should be doing at the moment is looking</p>
<p> around and seeing what it can do to make Australia better and stronger.</p>
<p> And we don't have a system at the moment that is all that fair</p>
<p> and we do need a system that brings more fairness but it's a</p>
<p> system that will fully protect retired people. I want to say to the</p>
<p> retired people of Australia, you have nothing to fear, indeed you</p>
<p> have much to gain from a fairer and different taxation system. And</p>
<p> I ask all of you to wait and have a look at the detail and you won't</p>
<p> have too long to wait and you will see that what I say is true. We</p>
<p> must be willing to change things that are good for Australia. Part</p>
<p> of the art of good Government and the mark of a good sensitive Government</p>
<p> is to hang on to those things from our past which are valuable and</p>
<p> enduring and important. We have a lot of traditional values as Australians</p>
<p> that I don't want to see changed. We are an egalitarian society,</p>
<p> we believe in the old Australian adage of mateship. We believe in</p>
<p> looking after each other and sharing adversity and helping each other</p>
<p> and whenever there's a great calamity or tragedy in Australia</p>
<p> the best of the Australian spirit comes out. We saw it last year in</p>
<p> that appalling tragedy in Thredbo in the Snowy Mountains. We see it</p>
<p> in bushfires, we see it in other national calamities.</p>
<p>So they're qualities about Australia that I wouldn't want</p>
<p> to see changed, in a hundred years I wouldn't want to see any</p>
<p> change in those sorts of things.</p>
<p>They are other things about Australia that I don't want to see</p>
<p> changed. I don't for example want to see this flag draped on</p>
<p> the wall behind me changed. I support that flag very, very strongly.</p>
<p> That flag is a wonderful expression of our history and that's</p>
<p> why one of the first things that I did as Prime Minister was to ask</p>
<p> the Parliament to pass a law saying that the Australian flag could</p>
<p> never be changed without that issue being put to a vote of all of</p>
<p> the Australian people. And my suspicion is that because of that law</p>
<p> it will never get changed because I don't believe the majority</p>
<p> of the Australian people will ever vote to change it.</p>
<p>So they are some of the things about Australia that I don't want</p>
<p> to see changed at all. Nor do I want to see the cooperative spirit</p>
<p> that exists between our local communities and their local and state</p>
<p> governments change. I don't think we should change our Federal</p>
<p> system of government. We divide responsibility between the national</p>
<p> government, the state government and the local government.</p>
<p>There is much about Australia that is all right as it is and I'm</p>
<p> not somebody who believes in change for change's sake. But part</p>
<p> of my responsibility as Prime Minister is to argue for change in those</p>
<p> things that I believe are good for Australia. You look at each issue</p>
<p> and you say is the present situation continuing to be good for Australia?</p>
<p> And if it is you hang on to it, you preserve it, and you argue against</p>
<p> change. If on the other hand it's something that you believe</p>
<p> ought to be changed for the good of Australia, you then go out and</p>
<p> argue for and you advocate change.</p>
<p>That's why I support changing our tax system. Not because I've</p>
<p> got any personal hang-up about it or some ideological commitment.</p>
<p> But I just happen to believe that it would be good for Australia if</p>
<p> we had a taxation system that encouraged us to export. It would be</p>
<p> good for Australia if we had a taxation system that was harder for</p>
<p> cheats to prosper from. It would be good if we had a taxation system</p>
<p> that paid greater recognition to the cost of bring up children. It</p>
<p> would be good if we had a taxation system that recognised the severe</p>
<p> cost disabilities of many of our rural industries. And can I say to</p>
<p> all of you that there is no state in Australia that would benefit</p>
<p> more because of its heavy reliance on the manufacturing industries</p>
<p> of this country. There is no State that would benefit more from the</p>
<p> sort of taxation reform that we have in mind than the State of South</p>
<p> Australia. Because the present taxation system, the present wholesale</p>
<p> tax system is massively discriminatory against manufacturing industry.</p>
<p> It penalises manufacturers and it particularly penalises manufacturing</p>
<p> exporters.</p>
<p>And I believe my friends that when all of the details of this are</p>
<p> unveiled and as I say we're getting near to completing the task</p>
<p> but it is a big task, it's an important task. I believe that</p>
<p> the great majority of Australians will see it as the next necessary</p>
<p> step towards making this country more competitive of giving this country</p>
<p> more fairness and of giving this country a greater capacity to compete</p>
<p> in a difficult world environment.</p>
<p>It is because of what's happening in Asia that it is necessary</p>
<p> for us to press ahead with essential changes and reforms. That is</p>
<p> not a reason for us to go slow rather it is a reason for us to press</p>
<p> ahead.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen thank you very much for coming this morning.</p>
<p> I'm often asked as I do interviews around Australia and I talk</p>
<p> to journalists and commentators, I'm often asked what is the</p>
<p> best part of the job. The best part of the job is the opportunity</p>
<p> to meet different groups of Australians in settings like this. To</p>
<p> come into a local community, to talk to people where they might regularly</p>
<p> come and meet their friends, have a cup of tea or a drink or play</p>
<p> bowls or whatever the activity may be, indoors or outdoors. And no</p>
<p> community is the same, that's the remarkable thing about it,</p>
<p> every community has it distinctive characteristics. I know a little</p>
<p> of the history of this area, I know a little of the different contributions</p>
<p> made by different immigrant communities after World War II to the</p>
<p> character of the City of Salisbury. It's different from other</p>
<p> parts of Adelaide and they're different again from parts of Melbourne</p>
<p> and Sydney and Brisbane. And it's a constant fascination and</p>
<p> a constant privilege to have the that opportunity of visiting so many</p>
<p> local communities.</p>
<p>And it is a reminder to me that the only way we as Australians can</p>
<p> achieve the goals that all of us share for our country and that is</p>
<p> a better and fairer society and a secure society as we go into the</p>
<p> next century is that we have to work together. The Government can't</p>
<p> do it all on it's own. It's not very good at doing certain</p>
<p> things, the Government, but it's good at doing other things.</p>
<p> Local organisations can't do it all on their own but they do</p>
<p> a magnificent job and individuals can't always do it on their</p>
<p> own either and it's only through a shared endeavour of individuals</p>
<p> and local communities and government working together that we can</p>
<p> share and achieve our goals.</p>
<p>Thank you for having me. Trish thank you for the tremendous job that</p>
<p> you're doing as the Federal Member for this electorate. I think</p>
<p> it's absolutely superb, she's a great representative of</p>
<p> this people of this electorate, she's a very valued colleague</p>
<p> and friend and I ask you to, whenever the time may be appropriate,</p>
<p> to look favourably upon her in the most practical of all ways.</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>
