FOR PRESS: P. M. No. 90/ 1969<br />
CHRISTMAS MESSAGE TO THE FORCES<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton, has sent the<br />
following message to the Australian forces:-<br />
" To all Australian servicemen and women at home<br />
and abroad, I send best wishes for Christmas and<br />
the New Year.<br />
so Speaking on behalf of the Government and your fellow<br />
Australians, I want you to know that we appreciate<br />
your contribution to our security and well-being.<br />
In particular, our thoughts at this time are with<br />
S those of you who are separated from your families,<br />
and especially those serving in Vietnam. You are<br />
doing a vital job for Australia, and for the stability<br />
of that part of the world in which we live.<br />
To you all, wherever you may be serving, I say a<br />
very warm " thank you". I wish you as happy a<br />
Christmas as circumstances will permit, and a<br />
safe and successful New Year.<br />
While we look hopefully to the seventies for a<br />
peaceful solution to world problems, there is no<br />
0 doubt that Australia will continue to depend on its<br />
Armed Forces to guarantee security and progress<br />
in the decade ahead. Sincerely,<br />
JOHN GORTON."<br />
