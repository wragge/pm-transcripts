Prime Minister Julia Gillard and Queensland Premier Anna Bligh officially launched work on the $16 billion Santos Liquefied Natural Gas Project near Gladstone today.</p>
<p>The project, which is one of Australia's largest energy projects, is expected to generate $9 billion a year in exports and create more than 5,000 construction jobs and nearly 1,000 long term operational positions.</p>
<p>Speaking at the site of the project, the Prime Minister said it was a significant day for the people of Gladstone and Queensland, as well as Santos and its partners.</p>
<p>Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) will play an important part in the global transition towards a cleaner energy future.</p>
<p>Australia is currently the world's fourth largest exporter of LNG and projects such as this one are projected to take this ranking to second by 2015.</p>
<p>The Gladstone project demonstrates the global attractiveness of Australia as an investment destination and as a reliable trading partner for energy commodities.</p>
<p>It is further evidence of the important role LNG has to play as we transition to cleaner fuel sources.</p>
<p>The Gladstone project will create jobs for Australians and deliver significant local, state and national economic benefits.</p>
<p>The project will also generate new training opportunities. Eighteen Masters degree scholarships will be offered at the University College London's campus in Adelaide as part of the project.</p>
<p>These new scholarships, jointly sponsored by Santos, KOGAS and UCL, build on Santos' existing $10 million contribution to establish UCL's School of Energy and Resources.</p>
<p>The Gladstone LNG Project is subject to more than 300 Commonwealth environmental conditions, in addition to those imposed by the Queensland Government.</p>
<p>The first cargo from the Gladstone Liquefied natural gas project is scheduled to be exported from 2015.</p>
<p>This project will be joint venture between Australian company Santos, Malaysia's PETRONAS, Total of France, and KOGAS of Korea (subject to regulatory approval).</p>
