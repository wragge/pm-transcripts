PRIME MINISTER<br />
E. O. E. PROOF ONLY<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF PRESS CONFERENCE, ROCKHAMPTON, 25 JUNE 1985<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr H-awke, how do you think it looks for the<br />
Government going into the Summit with mr-re than half the<br />
Mlinistry oppos'ed to the preferred option?<br />
PM: I think it looks very good going.-int.-the Summit, not<br />
just for the Government, but for the Australian community.<br />
There has been very very widespread community debate and T<br />
think that by the time we get into the Summit the opportunity<br />
will be there for a detailed examination of the inadequacies<br />
of the existing system and of the plusses and minuses of<br />
various avenues for improving that existing system. Now<br />
the Ministry will have every opportunity in the ' post summit<br />
situation of expressing its views. And, I believe, the sort<br />
of views that will emerge in that post summit situation are<br />
not necessary the same as they are now. The more the<br />
Government's package is being opposed and you discuss the<br />
issue with people, Z think more are emerging as accepting of it.<br />
JOURNALIST: What is the current state of play, Prime Minister,<br />
Qwith the question of exemptions to the consumption tax? Are<br />
we having exemptions or not?<br />
PM. No, the current position is that the Government stated<br />
in its preferred position that to grant exemptions creates a<br />
number of difficulties, both in-administration, the possibility<br />
of evasion, and in continuing lobby pressure for addition to<br />
the range of exemptions. But having said, I mean I have to<br />
say, as I have said continuously,-that. we are going into the<br />
Summit with a-n open mind. we have, I think, manifestly<br />
clicharged the obligatiopi upon us to go out and explain the<br />
White Paper to explain what we see as the benefits of the prefer-2<br />
option. That does not mean that we are not going to listen to<br />
discussions and arguments for the possibilities of change. We wLido<br />
that. And for that reanon, therefore, Peter, I can't at this<br />
point be dogmatic about the question of the final shape of the<br />
package. if I were dogmatic about that now, it would be making a<br />
nonsense of the statements that I have been making that the<br />
Summit is a real process. And it is. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Would you concede though that alterations to<br />
the package now seem inevitable, given that there has been<br />
so much opposition, both from business, the ACTU, and even<br />
within ALP ranks? Just generally, not specifically.<br />
PM: The opposition ' highlighted I mean I could<br />
tell you from experiences I have had and that Paul Keating<br />
has had as we~ e t around the country and explain~ the package<br />
to pepple who have staed off with reservations or even<br />
opposition. And then once you have had discussions with<br />
them or talk with them, their view changes. Now, I think<br />
it's too early tdosaythat it is inevitable there be change.<br />
The obligation I have, and I take this opportunity here Qfks'gÃ±<br />
i; TAhe_. The obligation I have got the people of Australia is<br />
that we are open to change.<br />
JOURNALIST: Does that include zonal charges or zonal<br />
allowances for people living in country areas?<br />
PM: Well, there is already, as you know, zonal allowances<br />
and that jr l ikov" wc$ k 6j4, F discussion at the Summit<br />
XC pople war."+ ) o cAeZd that aspect. It already exists.<br />
Now, whether it is adequate and there need to be changes,<br />
wey would like to hear from any people at the Summit who have<br />
a p-ar+ ir concern about that aspect because there is no doubt<br />
that it Mof, ) mt-tthis great country of ours the vast spread<br />
geographical spread there are arguments strong arguments<br />
for Mdv, They 44eA. a, G recognised. Whether they are<br />
adequate enough or properly differentiated is a legitimate<br />
matter to be raised.<br />
JOURNALIST: At the weekend Mr Crean said that the ACTU<br />
was still not satisfied with the distribution to the income<br />
scale of the tax cuts, that he wanted more benefit for<br />
lower income earners. Is there room for negotiation in that<br />
area? PM: It's not a question of negotiation. UI -ot<br />
at the Summit that people will discuss that if they reel that<br />
the very substantial benefits. that are available for<br />
distribution in the event of the imposition of a broad based<br />
consumption tax. If they feel that that distribution is not<br />
the most appropriate, then let them argue it. I would have<br />
thought that the distribution that has been suggested in the<br />
preferred option C isa reasonable one, but I'm certainly<br />
open to hear argument as to why a different distribution<br />
may be better. Now, ou 4IP oL negotiation, I would<br />
want the matter to be discussed at the Summit, and I think<br />
the At * r 0 &amp; ud / 44" 6 a~ 4A 4' z~ j A~~~ c<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, do you expect or hope that the Summit<br />
will produce a communique? </p>
<p>3.<br />
PM: I haventt got any feelings about that. I think it-.<br />
a~. quite different situation to the Summit of April 1983<br />
It would be less likel1y, I would think# that you would be<br />
able to shape a communique which would have the unanimity<br />
bar on 4 April 1983. 1 don't think you<br />
would get the same unanimnity, but you may be able to get<br />
some broad sort of statement about reform and directions<br />
for reform, but I really haven't put my mind on that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Would you need a communique which would meet<br />
pninciple nine -' that is broad community support f or your<br />
option? PM:. I don't think you need a communique to satisfy<br />
principle'nine. it's just in the area of tax every<br />
particular word can mean a lot to people who are there.<br />
But we have established an agenda committee and this is a<br />
matter that the agenda committee through the course of the<br />
week of the Summit can look at, and if it emerges in a way<br />
that a sensible communique can be shaped# then that is what<br />
will happen.<br />
JOURNALIST: Sir, what is your reaction to the visit of<br />
30,000 farmers to Canberra next Monday. How much time<br />
would you be giving to these visitors?<br />
PM: Well, let me say these things. Firstly, I can understand<br />
the concern that has been expressed by the members of the<br />
f arming community right round Australia. This riot march<br />
in Melbourne which of course was preceded by marches in<br />
Adelaide and Perth. They are in a position where the*<br />
net incomes of farmers are determined by two things prices that<br />
basic. ally*. determined on overseas-* markets and rising cost<br />
structure in this country. And I can understand their<br />
concern. That is why to this point I have had many<br />
meetings both with the executive and with the leadership of<br />
the National Farmers Federation and why at this very stage<br />
I am engaged with officers of my Department and other<br />
relevant Departments in trying to see what can be done to assist<br />
in the area of farm costs. So that's the first thing I say that<br />
we are concerned with the issue. Secondly, I doubt that I will<br />
be addressing the rally but what I had in mind is that I would<br />
receive a deputation from the farmers' rally at some stage<br />
uuring Monday if that's what they would like to do.<br />
JOURNALIST: _ Is your Government willing to risk marginal<br />
country seats with the introduction of a consumption tax?<br />
PM: Well I have made it quite clear all the way along that<br />
what this Government is about is making the decisions which<br />
we believe are necessary to get this economy in proper shape.<br />
And there is a very marked contrast between this Goverlnent and<br />
our predecessors. I have said on a number of occasions that<br />
they knew what had to be done in regard to deregulating the<br />
financial system. They did the work but didn't have the<br />
political courage to make the decisions. The same thing in<br />
regard to the entry of foreign banks. The same thing in regard<br />
to floating tne aoÃ± i. ar. * k71ey kxicsw w1aml-la Lo dcclc,~ i<br />
because they were always looking over their shoulder and saying </p>
<p>* what might happen to us here. Who might fre upset there.<br />
They put the interests of Australia second before their own<br />
perceived self-political interests. Now that's not the way<br />
we've operated. That's not the way. I intend to operate in<br />
the future. The interests of Australia are far more important<br />
to me than simply saying well what is it that I should do which<br />
is going to maximise political advantage. Having said that<br />
J believe that the people of Australia are increasingly making<br />
their decision between my Government and the opposition who<br />
are increasingly that is the Opposition being revealed<br />
as hopelessly divided and without principle in this area. After<br />
all who comes to the tax debate with creait. Mr Peacock and<br />
the opposition who created and stimulated the tax avoidance<br />
industry so that billions of dollars have been avoided by a<br />
relatively privelioged few and that corresponding burden imposed<br />
upon the mass of Australian. And no wonder, as I said in<br />
Adelaide at the weekend, no wonder they refused the invitation<br />
to come to the Summit because they couldn't come with clean<br />
hands. So you ask about political judgement that will be made<br />
by the elctorate. I am making the point that I believe that<br />
increasingly the Australian electorate is making the judgement<br />
that the Opposition are hopeless and not to be trusted in this<br />
area, even those who may not agree with certain elements of<br />
what this Government is proposing. ItB giving us full credit<br />
for having the courage to face up and tackle this issue. I<br />
believe that by the time the decisions are taken by this<br />
Government then they will have a lot of time then to be capable<br />
of explanation to the Australian people. By the time the next<br />
election comes the whole tax issue will be a tremendous plus<br />
to this Government and correspondingly a very big minus, as it<br />
should be, for the Opposition parties.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, what sort of support do you need from<br />
the Trade Union movement for your tax package. Both you and<br />
Mr Keating have madeiit clear that you can't proceed unless<br />
the ACTU agree to discounting before the court. But what will<br />
you do if a couple of major unions stand out and oppose the<br />
consumption tax. Will you proceed even though that means damage<br />
to the Prices and Incomes Accord.<br />
PM: I am not going to answer that question in its hypothetical<br />
formn but its a question the substance of which of course deserves<br />
to be answered. We have made.. it clear, Paul, as you know, that<br />
if the preferred option were-to proceed with a substantial<br />
broadly based consumption tax being imposed then you could not<br />
have a situation where unions and their members having been<br />
more than compensated for the price increase associated with<br />
the broadly based consumption tax more than comnpensated by a<br />
reduction in direct tax, then sought to double dip. Now, I am<br />
strongly c( onf irmed in the strength of the Government's position<br />
if you like by the unqualified statements that have been made<br />
by the leadership of the ACTU, that they understand that in a<br />
position where there was compensation via the direct tax route<br />
there couldn't be legitimately a seeking of compensation by<br />
way of wage increases as well. Now the leadership of the ACTU<br />
have made it quite clear. So the logical. thing to -say is this.<br />
Well, where the leadership of the ACTU from the beginning of<br />
1983 has given its support to the Accord, then you ask yourself~<br />
the question, will they be able to give the same leadership in<br />
the situation you are talking about. Now I have no reason to<br />
bo14or 4-h~ t hairinu aivpn th. lcadershiD and delivered before<br />
that they wouldn't be able to do it again. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, the National Farmers' Federation<br />
says you have given them an undertaking to seriously consider<br />
exemptions to fuel Does that mean you will also<br />
consider exemptions on the same basis for industries like the<br />
aviation and road transport industries.<br />
PM: Well lets get this position straight. It is true that<br />
the National Farmers' Federation put up a case to me generally<br />
about the cost of inputs and within that general framework<br />
they addressed themselves particularly to the question of fuel.<br />
And I undertook that I would consider the detailed submissions<br />
that they wanted to put to us there at the Su~ mmit and the<br />
National Farmners' Federation representing as they do the<br />
farming community of this country, they are entitled to be heard<br />
and I certainly will take account of what they've got to say.<br />
Now there are no further implications to be drawn from that.<br />
I will listen and the Treasurer and Government will listen<br />
closely to what the people have to say about the economic<br />
implications of any of the proposed tax changes and in the<br />
end we will make the decisions which we believe are most likely<br />
to guarantee equity and economic efficiency. And I repeat<br />
the farmers are entitled to put their case because, as distinct<br />
from a lot of other significant sectors of the Australian<br />
community who are able to determine to some extent themselves<br />
the prices they will receive for their products on the domestic<br />
market, farmers are overwhelmingly at the whim of international<br />
market mechanisms.. And the additional element in their concern<br />
which I fully understand is that that international market<br />
mechanism within which their prices are fixed is not one where<br />
relative economic efficiency is the determinant. They have<br />
been successively hurt by the distortions of the international<br />
market mechanism which have been affected by the activities<br />
and practices of the European community. And where they see<br />
themselves as amongst the most efficient farmers in the world<br />
which they are and having their markets decimated as they<br />
have been by the inefficient practices condoned by European<br />
governments, then they are naturally disturbed. They are<br />
entitled to be. And it is for that reason that I pay particulEattention<br />
to what they've got to say.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mxr Hawke, is one representative at the Summit<br />
then sufficient for the farmers voice. Apparantly there is<br />
only one farmer<br />
P14: You want to catch up. There are many more than one.<br />
There are three now from the National Farmers Federation.<br />
I contacted Mr M~ cLachlan and asked him whether he would like<br />
to have more than the one, and would three do. And he said,<br />
yes, that would be fine. So, there are three comingJ from<br />
the. National Farmers Federation. Of course in addition to<br />
that, 14r Michael Davidson, cx head of the National Farmers<br />
Federation, will also be present in his capacity as a mcmber<br />
of EPAC.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, can you Just give us an<br />
instance where a group have changed their attitude publicl 1<br />
on the tax proposals, after having spoken to you and<br />
Mr K( eating.<br />
P14-A group? </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Or anybody?<br />
PM-. Yes I can. On Sunday past I was in Adelaide and<br />
at a meeting of about 500 people at a luncheon. And I<br />
was speaking to them after I had addressed them. And<br />
literally scores of people said to me, well, I was a bit<br />
worried about that, but I see what you are about now. We<br />
support it. And I have had that thing happen a lot to me<br />
in personal diocussions and group discussions. And<br />
certainly Mr Keating has had precisely that experience.<br />
But you have got to also take this point into account.<br />
If you talk about a group l. ike the ACTU it is natural<br />
enough with the constituencies they have got, and being<br />
part of an overall movemnent that they are going to, I think,<br />
keep their options somewhat open. I believe that by the<br />
time we get into the Summit and the immediate post Summit<br />
situation, some of those individuals who have been expressing<br />
a view with an eye to their own immediate constituency,<br />
may well have a different view in the light of the detailed<br />
analysis that will be able to be undertaken. at the Summit.<br />
The other point I make is that the ACTU and welfare groups<br />
in the -period leading up to the Summit are having a lot<br />
of work done in analysis of the work that we as a Government<br />
have done both well not both but in regard to matters<br />
like this. The assumptions that.. are made about expenditure<br />
patterns, the assum~ ptions that are made about savings<br />
ratios and so on, the assumptions that are made, therefore,<br />
about compensation levels that are necessary to cover the<br />
price increases that would be associated with the<br />
introduction of a broad based consumption tax. Now the<br />
more work that they do on analysing the assumptions that<br />
have been involved in our work,. then the more the possibility<br />
is that they will be satisfied as to the general adequacy<br />
and accuracy of what has been done. You have got to<br />
understand this I apologize to some extent for the length<br />
of this answer, but I think it is necessary and relevantthat<br />
there isn't an argument against an indirect tax as such.<br />
It is the argument that an indirect tax of itself can have<br />
a regressive effect. It can impose an unduly harsh burden<br />
absolutely and relatively upon low income people. Now, the<br />
more the work is done to show that the compensatory rncchanisms<br />
are adequate to overcome that regressive effect, so that<br />
neither in absolute nor in relative terms are the needy<br />
disadvantaged, the more likely it is, I think, that you got<br />
acceptance of that approach.<br />
JOURNALIST; Mr Hawke, over the course of the last couple<br />
of weeks both yourself and the Treasurer, Mr Keating, have<br />
put a lot of your personal prestige squarely on the line r<br />
supporting option C. Do you agree that the assessment<br />
made by a number of people in the business and financial<br />
community that the Governint can only retrent from a<br />
consumption tax at the cost oS-destroying the authority and<br />
credibility of both yourself and of Mr Keating? </p>
<p>PM: No, of course I don't. The authority and the<br />
credibility of-Mr Keating and myself and the Government<br />
generally is on the firmest possible foundations. That<br />
is the achievement of having turned this economy round<br />
from the disaster into which it was plunged by seven years<br />
of conservative government into a position of record<br />
economic growth. The record creation of jobs the<br />
halving of inflation the tackling of the fundament issues<br />
of our exchange rate of Commonwealth/ State financial<br />
relationships de-regulation of the financial markets<br />
all of those things together constitute an extraordinarily<br />
impressive record of economic achievement unmatched by any<br />
previous Prime Minister and Treasurer, I would suggest in a<br />
comparable period. And that is the basis upon which we will<br />
be judged. Now, in regard to the tax process. Let me remind<br />
you of what it has been. In the election campaign I said<br />
that we would make tax reform a central part of this<br />
Govenrment's second term of office. I just didn't leave<br />
it at that. I said we would follow a very specific<br />
process and I outlined the nine principles that would be<br />
applied. in doing that I then said that we as a government<br />
would go ahead and do the hard yakka the hard work of<br />
analysing the existing tax system and exploring avenues for<br />
reform. We have done that. we have done it in a way which<br />
has never before been tackled in this country. We then<br />
said we would take the product of that work after its<br />
analysis in the White Paper throughout the community.<br />
We would then take it to a national Tax Summit so that the<br />
community, including the business community, could examine<br />
that work. We said that wie were not seeking to impose,<br />
but we were seeking to do as much work as we possibly could,<br />
both in analysis of existing inadequacies and the opening<br />
up of possible avenues of reform. We remain of the view at<br />
this stage on all the evidence available to us that the<br />
preferrrcd option that we have suggested is the best way of<br />
going. If, out of the process of the Summit, and<br />
immediately following the Summit, there emerges some more<br />
general view that there is a preferred way to go, that will<br />
not be inconsistent with the whole process that the<br />
Treasurer and I have indicated would be followed from the<br />
time of the election campaign.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you Baying you won't back away from the<br />
12h% consumption tax?<br />
PM: I suggest you read the transcript of what I have just<br />
said. The answer to that question is contained in what I<br />
have just said.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, what are the odds then of getting the<br />
Option C up?<br />
PM: Come on. I'm not running a book, Greg. You pcople have<br />
got more time to engage in those esoteric pursui:* ts. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, given the fact that the package<br />
is very finely balanced in internal construction<br />
PM: That's a nice way of putting it. Thanks, Paul.<br />
JOURNALIST-the fiscal dividend, the actual extra<br />
dollars that we get in our pockets at the end of this<br />
being about $ 1 billion, is a relatively small number<br />
compared with the big numbers that are involved the<br />
14.3 from the intake of the consumption tax and scoon<br />
if those big numbers do get thrown out at all, then that<br />
little number at the bottom, which is what we are left with,<br />
could be thrown out a lot, could it not?<br />
PM. well of course you are displaying some knowledge,-but<br />
not a complete knowledge of this finely tuned mechanism<br />
that you talk about. Fiscal dividend the phrase fiscal<br />
dividend refers to that amount of revenue which would be<br />
'. forthcoming as a result of tax avoiders and evaders having<br />
to pay the 12 W consumption tax. Of course that is not the<br />
total amount which is available additionally for distribution.<br />
YOu have the fact that in the part A option A which is<br />
common to all the broadening of the direct base you have<br />
there also a very significant additional source of revenue.<br />
So, you take the two together, you are then starting to<br />
look at the areas wihere you can calculate what the basis<br />
of benefit to people in by wag-of reduction of the direct<br />
taxes. It is not just the fiscal dividend. Fiscal dividend<br />
is one part. Now, you are right in saying* '. that you only<br />
get that fiscal dividend that element of it which may be<br />
in the order of $ 1 b1 lion you only get that by way of<br />
the broad based consumption tax. And indeed that is one of<br />
the very strong reasons that we put in favour of preferred<br />
option C. because we regard it as offensive if you like, thiat<br />
people in this community would be left in a position where<br />
they still would pay no tax into the revenue. And there would<br />
still be a number of people in that category if you didn't<br />
nave a broad based consumption tax, because it is clear, as tb<br />
paper points out, that you would have to have such a massive<br />
army of people in the tax avoidance and evasion area of the<br />
Tax Office if you were going to have any possibility of<br />
ensuring that everyone paid their tax. So its only through<br />
the existence of a broad based consumption tax that you can g(<br />
that fiscal dividend and that's something that I think the<br />
people of Australia should be reluctant to miss getting, prov.<br />
and always provided, that they can be satisfied that the<br />
compensatory mechanism that's put in place is going to cover<br />
the otherwise regressive features of a broad based consunptio.<br />
tax. 13ut if the people of Australia do say that thcy don't<br />
want a broad based consumption tax, then they are ensuring<br />
that there will be a very significant loss of revenue availab<br />
to them and ' available to Governmnent to reduce the direct tax<br />
further. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Mr. Hawke, much of the credibility of the tax<br />
package dep~ nds on the assumption<br />
the inflationary impact of it, there has been some qu~ estioning<br />
from the ACTU and indeed within the Ministry in the last few<br />
days of Treasury figures, have you had any further<br />
diacussions about them and are you completely satisfied they<br />
are correct.<br />
PH: I have'nt at this stage had any further discussions abou~ t<br />
them, Michelle. But I have had nothing brought--to miy<br />
attention from those around me to suggest that those analyses<br />
to which you refer are inadequate. But let me say this to you,<br />
that by the time I get back to Canberra, which will be<br />
Thursday afternoon, I will be going through the whole range of<br />
assumptions and analyses before I go into the Summit with my<br />
own advisers and with the people from Treasury, so that in the<br />
light of all the work that has been done elsewhere, of which<br />
they will be aware, so that I can be in a position to make,<br />
by the time I go into the Summit, make the judgement<br />
about-the adequacies of all the critical assumptions and<br />
assessments.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, last week you challenged the<br />
business community to tell you where you could cut<br />
Government spending further, since then some of them said<br />
they would be happy to do that provided you gave them the<br />
relevant economic information on which to base the review.<br />
Would you be prepared to give them that information.<br />
PM; Well, I find it a little bit surprisi ng for them to<br />
suggest that with the whole range of information thats<br />
available to them that they can't give details about areas<br />
in which they would suggest expenditure cuts can be made.<br />
Let me make this point, however. This Talx Summit is not<br />
about expenditure levels and it indeed is somewhat amazing<br />
that the business community should be attempting to put<br />
some pressure upon this Government in regard to -the exercise<br />
of discipline in these areas. Because this Government has<br />
shown more discipline about its levels of expenditure and<br />
has imposed more constraints upon itself now than any other<br />
Government has in the past, and I simply say that we will be<br />
in that way bringing down the level of the defici-' both in<br />
absolute terms and very substantially as a proportion of GDP.<br />
-We'll have virtually by the time we get into this Dudget, we<br />
have halved the deficit as a proportion of GDP frcm that which<br />
we inherited, and this hasn't happened by accident, its<br />
happened because we've been prepared to exercioe discipline p&gt;<br />
ourselves in these areas. Now, outside of the structure of<br />
the Tax Summit, if the business community want to go to the<br />
details then we are more than happy to do it. They've got<br />
enough information upon which they can do it.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, are you happy with the commrents that<br />
Mr Howe made on Sunday given that lie attended all the Cabinct<br />
discussions, he obviously doesn't agree with you that the<br />
compensation provisions are adequate. </p>
<p>JA.~<br />
PM: Yes, I've got no unhappiness about that. I spoke with<br />
Brian on the Friday, he was over in Perth. We had a very<br />
amicable discussion and I pointed out that I knew he had some<br />
questions that he still neeeded to be satisfied about and I<br />
certainly did'nt regard, nor did he, regard his observations<br />
as an attack~ upon the Government and I must say I valued the<br />
contribution that Brian Howe has made in the discussions in<br />
the Cabinet on this matter arnd I am sure he will continue<br />
to make very useful contributions in the discussions that<br />
we'll have to have after the Summit in coming to our final<br />
conclusionls. JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke.. in the latest opinion polls the State<br />
Labor Opposition has dropped I think Mr Warburton<br />
blamed. that on the Queensland electricity dispute and the<br />
ongoing occurrences there. I was wondering, given the attempt<br />
to involve the Federal Government in that, whether you<br />
accepted any of the repercussions that is the 7% drop.<br />
PM:-No. I don't accept any particular responsibility.<br />
( 1 What goes to make up the decisions in the minds of people<br />
in any particular State is a combination of factors. I would<br />
have thought, if you want to talk about the current position<br />
in the State of Queensland, and not only current hut what<br />
it is going to be like in the montha ahead, that its a fair<br />
bet that the Government position is going to worsen because<br />
its becoming increasingly clear to the people of Queensland<br />
I think as more evidence comes out, that its the worst<br />
managed, worst run economy of all the States in Australia in<br />
a time where unemployments is declining in the rest of<br />
Australia, its increasing here. Actual jobs have been lost.<br />
Its got the worst unemployment and employment record by a<br />
very long way. Its price movement has been well above the<br />
national average. Its sales of registrations of new motor<br />
vehicles is way below the national average and in dwelling<br />
commencements, a very important sector of economic activity,<br />
it is pitiful and pathetically below what is happening<br />
in the rest of Australia. This evidence is becoming clearer<br />
and-clearer. And as that evidence of the economic incompetence<br />
of the Queensland Government continues to come through, I belicvc<br />
, that the position of the Government will deteriorate and the<br />
position of the Opposition will improve. As will, of course.,<br />
the influence of the evidence aboub industrial disputes,<br />
also work in the same way. In the rest of Australia we are<br />
moving to historically low levels of industrial disputation,<br />
because the rest of Australia is getting the benefit of our<br />
consensus approach in this area. So the rest of Australia is<br />
benefitting from it. Which is the State where you've got<br />
industrial disputation getting worse and worse, not just in<br />
relation to theSEQEfl dispute, the State of Queensland. The<br />
Premier has had the opportunity here in this State of using<br />
his methods of saying to the people of Queensland this is how<br />
you can got industrial relationships working. And he's done<br />
infinitely worse than any State in Australia, infinitly Worsc<br />
againat the whole of the national average. I just happen to<br />
believe that as these things become more and more appairent<br />
Bo will the people of Queenisland make their judlgemerit. h\ s c<br />
will also., may I say, against his outright misreprosentations<br />
f-hat's a nice way,. a polite way of putting it. I won't use<br />
the more direct way of saying it. His outright<br />
m~ ocpC5Ct~ t1OlBatnout now QuaN f~ M1riae a xith the'<br />
Commonwealth Government. </p>
<p>What he is attempting to do is t6 blame everyone else for<br />
his own incompetency. First it is the unions he blames<br />
them for his own economic incompetence. Then it is the<br />
Commonwealth Government it is their fault. But<br />
increasingly the people of Queensland will come to the<br />
inescapably true conclusion that the reason why Queensland<br />
on every relevant statistic is doing worse than the rest<br />
of Australia is because they have the worst economic<br />
management. </p>
