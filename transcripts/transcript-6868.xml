PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 19 March 1986<br />
I have formed a special Country Task Force to monitor the social, economic<br />
and political requirements of Australians living outside the metropolitan<br />
area.<br />
The Task Force's brief is to listen, assess and report directly to me on<br />
issues of importance to country people, largely through visits to<br />
particular country areas. The first visit will be to Warwick in the<br />
southern Darling Downs area, on 25-26 March.<br />
The Task Force will also concentrate on areas outside the State capitals<br />
where rapid change is occurring with significant effects on people's lives.<br />
The Task Force is based on the Government Caucus Primary Industry<br />
Committee. It is to be chaired by the member for Macmillan, Barry<br />
Cunningham, who also chairs the Caucus committee.<br />
The Task Force will deal with all rural and socio-economic issues,<br />
including small business, women's affairs, care for the elderly, job<br />
generation and primary production. It will be directed as much to people<br />
living in provincial towns and cities as to the farm sector.<br />
The initial visit to the southern Darling Downs will be followed by visits<br />
to the south west of Western Australia in April and to central Victoria in<br />
June. Other visits will be made later in the year and throughout 1987.<br />
The establishment of the Prime Minister's Country Task Force is the result<br />
of almost 12 months preliminary work.<br />
This includes meetings with the Caucus Primary Industry Committee and the<br />
Minister for Primary Industry, John Kerin, who fully supports the program.<br />
The establishment of this Task Force reflects the fact that almost 25 per<br />
cent of Government parliamentarians directly represent country people.<br />
This makes the Australian Labor Party the parliament's strongest party<br />
representing country people.<br />
The Task Force will meet with a wide range of community groups, listen to<br />
their points of view before then reporting to me on issues of concern.<br />
This will allow us to be as fully informed as possible.<br />
Our objective is to provide long term, lasting solutions to problems<br />
confronting country people rather than short-term ' band-aid' measures.<br />
The Task Force will also provide an opportunity to explain Government<br />
measures which may affect country Australians. </p>
