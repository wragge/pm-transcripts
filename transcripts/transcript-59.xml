MINISTER FOR TRADE FOR WASHINGTON TALKS<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister ( Mr. Menzies)<br />
The Prime Mvinister ( Mr. Menzies) announced today that<br />
the Minister for Trade ( Mr. McEwen) would leave for the United<br />
States on Thursday to discuss a number of trade matters in<br />
Washington. Mr. Menzies said the visit would be short and Mr. MeEwen<br />
would return to Australia before he himself left for abroad.<br />
Mr. Menzies said that Mr. McEwen's talks would cover a<br />
range of subjects which could be best dealt with on a Ministerial<br />
level at " on the spot" d. 4scussions. Mr. MoEwen had a full<br />
understanding of Australia's and tIr United States' trade<br />
problems, and a short personal visit was more convenient at this<br />
time, in view of the fact that Mr. MoEwen would not be able to be<br />
out of Australia during his ( Mr. M~ enzies) absence overseas.<br />
Mr. Menzies said that Mr. McEwen would be away less than<br />
three weeks and during that time the Minister for Defence<br />
( Mr. Townley) would be Acting Minister for Trade.<br />
