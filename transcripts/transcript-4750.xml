~ PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 9 JULY 1978<br />
GIPPSLAND FLOODS<br />
The Prime Minizs= er today announced Commonwealth support for<br />
additional relief measures in respect of the recent flooding<br />
in the Gippsland area of Victoria.<br />
Hr Fraser has advised the Acting Premier of Victoria that the<br />
Commonwealth -as agreed to increasing the loan limit to $ 50,000<br />
where, in add-zion to the usual losses, the affected primary<br />
zroducer also suffered a heavy loss of those structural<br />
inmprovements assistance necessary for the proper conduct<br />
of the farm. : he Commonwealth has also agreed that loans of<br />
this size wo.--d need to have provision for repayment over a<br />
longer period than the norm, and that a maximum period of<br />
years would appear appropriate.<br />
Mr Fraser also said " although we have received no formal<br />
request from the State for support of fencing grants, in this<br />
case I am prepared to say now, that we would agree, if the<br />
Victorian Government requests it, to support such a measure in<br />
respect of the damage by the Gipplsand floods. I have informed<br />
the Acting Premier of this and I await his response".<br />
Mr Fraser went on to say that natural disaster relief and<br />
restoration are signigicant state responsibilities. Traditionally,<br />
the Commonwealth has provided financial assistance to a State<br />
when expenditure on approved measures is beyond the capacity of<br />
the State to meet. Commonwealth/ State agreement on measures is<br />
not intended to limit the range of measures which a State can<br />
implement. The Prime Minister pointed out that " on occasions, some measures<br />
proposed by a State may not appear appropriate from a national<br />
perspective and will therefore not receive Commonwealth support.<br />
This does not mean that the State cannot implement these<br />
measures if it considers them of sufficient priority to warrant<br />
its meeting eir full cost from its own resources."<br />
" Nevertheless, -he Commonwealth, as always, stands ready to help<br />
the States the natural disaster assistance arrangements.<br />
Our prompt respcnse from the outset of the Gipplsand flooding<br />
and present of assistance to Victoria is evidence of our<br />
continuing := zern for Australians affected by natural disasters,"<br />
said Mr 000----</p>
