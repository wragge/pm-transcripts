NEW ZEALAND TOUR 1967<br />
LUNCHEON GIVEN BY MR. HOLYOAKE, PRIME MINISTER<br />
OF NEW ZEALAND IN HONOUR OF MR. HOLT, PRIMS<br />
MINISTER OF AUSTRALIA<br />
. ELLIBTON, NE ZEALAND 3RD FE3RUaRY, 1967<br />
Text of Speech MaJ'e by Mr. Holt<br />
Prime Minister: thit distiguished Australian emigrant, Mr.<br />
,; att: Your Excellencies: Mrs. Stevenson and other Parliamentary<br />
colleagues: Ladies and Jentlemen:<br />
First, Prime Minister and I do not know that I will go<br />
on saying " Prime M'vinister" because I am liable to lapse into<br />
something more familiar through force of habit, but first, Prime<br />
IMinister may I thank you very warmly indeed on behalf of my wife<br />
and myself for what you have said so generously and in such warm<br />
and friendly terms about us and about the people I have at this<br />
time the honour to lead. I stand in this room recalling memories<br />
which do not seem all that long distant in point of recollection<br />
although it was about 16 years ago in point of time, because my<br />
first and only previous visit to this beautiful country of yours<br />
was as the leader of the Australian Delegation to the Commonwealth<br />
Parliamentary Association, and I recall us having eaten in this<br />
room and hearing oratory no less extensive than that to which you<br />
are to be subjected here today, and I have always held very<br />
pleasant recollections of New 2ealand from that visit. You were<br />
kind enouh to see to it that I then was able to visit some<br />
considerable nart of this northern island, and that is really<br />
my justification for spending so much time in the South on this<br />
occasion. I hope in the years t. come there will be many more<br />
visits and that I shall see very much more of this country than<br />
will be possible even through the length of this particular visit.<br />
It is always good to come amongst friends, and it is even<br />
better to come amongst friends who have common interests, common<br />
purposes to serve, who can themselves act in a way that is<br />
beneficial to you and give you the opportunity to act in a way<br />
which is beneficial to them.<br />
And I must say in passin Yr. ' att, following your<br />
reference to trade between our two countries, that it is the desire<br />
of my Government that any agreements we make on matters of trade<br />
should serve not just the interests of one country, but should be<br />
mutually beneficial for both our countries, and if you find, or if<br />
experience proves that this is not the way the Agreement is<br />
working out if it does not serve our common purposes as fully as<br />
we would both hope, then you will find a helpful and constructive<br />
Australian attitude in order to make that possible, and my<br />
colleague, the Minister for Trade, will be over here to confer with<br />
his opposite numoer, your Deputy Prime Minister, very shortly, and<br />
it will be in that spirit that he will do so: and that is largely<br />
because of the feeling that we have for each other, but it is also<br />
attributable to the recognition that a growiig, prosperig,<br />
developing, strengthening New Zealand is of advantage and strength<br />
and help in promoting the prosoeritv of the country I represent.<br />
So here is enlightened self-interes't given an opportunity to express<br />
itself, and exoress itself in an environment of friendship and<br />
co-operation together.<br />
You spoke, I think, Prime Minister, of the historic fact<br />
/ 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
that in 1901 some consideration was given to a closer union<br />
politically-with our two countries, and there have been people<br />
in our Parliaments since that time there may have jeen one or<br />
two in yours: they have been less vocal so far as I have been<br />
aware who have continued to advocate this. I view that prospect<br />
of course with rather mixed feelins. I don't in fact regard it<br />
as a practical prospect in the future that I can look to, because<br />
you very properly have stressed the Few , ealand identity which<br />
means so much to you, and your independence which means so much<br />
to you, but I have sometimes thought of your situation and I am<br />
speaking in particular of you, Prime Minister as oeing a very<br />
happy and lucky one to be head of a Tovernment in a country which<br />
has only one House of Parliament, whose Jovernment is drawn from<br />
only one political party, and which has a unitary system of<br />
Jovernment. Nov, I lea'd a coalition and I am on very good terms<br />
with the members of my coalition but it is a coalition. I lead<br />
it in a Parliament that has two Chambers and in a Federation which<br />
has six States. Now, if there were to ue other members of that<br />
Federation with the strength of mind and independence of spirit<br />
that I have gathered is revealed in this country, those problems<br />
would oe very much more complex than they are at the present time.<br />
' hat you were saying, Mr. att, about the difficulty you have in<br />
getting people overseas to recognise the separateness of our<br />
countries is in one sense, I think, fortification and confirmation<br />
of this degree of friendship that exists between us, and confirms<br />
what you have been saying, Prime inister, that our situation is, so<br />
far as I could ascertain it ar) und the world, unique. I don't<br />
know any two peoples, any two independent countries, that are<br />
closer together in appear: nce, in manner in haoits of life in<br />
identity of interests than we find exist between Australia and<br />
New ' ealand. And that, of course, is the -rime reason, or certainly<br />
one of the prime reasons, of my visit here on this occasion. As<br />
I said yesterday, I felt it Tas my first duty if I could zo abroad,<br />
to go abroad to see our own troops serving Australia in the countries<br />
where they were located, and this developed into something of a<br />
South East Asian mission in the result, oecause these became<br />
formal visits, although the original purpose was for me to make<br />
contact with our own people and have them feel how proud we were<br />
of them how grateful we were for the services they were rendering<br />
us and the common cause of freedom. And then, of course there<br />
was the conference of Prime Ministers the need to establish early<br />
contact with those two great leaders who mean so much to both<br />
our countries, President Johnson and Prime Minister J'ilson. You and<br />
I were together then, later at the Prime Ministers' Conference, and<br />
then the quite historic vanila Conference, the fruits of which we<br />
expect to see of benefit certainly to this area of the world and<br />
to the free world as a whole as the years go on. 3ut when I was<br />
planning the tasks ahead for 1967, having got the election out of<br />
the way, the first priority on my list was to make contact with<br />
my friends here in I2ew Zealand and I am very glad that this has<br />
been possible and you were so kind as to open That invitation up<br />
to me. I spoke of our similarities. You chose to find some distinctions<br />
between us in our manner of speech, and I suppose that is so. l. e<br />
Australians are far less conscious of the fact that we have a<br />
different and not particularly attractive national accentuation<br />
which is observaole to others but which so frequently passes us<br />
unobserved amongst ourselves. I had early evidence of that when<br />
I went on my first visit to the United Kingdom again with a<br />
Parliamentary Delegation, the C. of those aays, in 1948, and on<br />
my first night at the Savoy I asked for a whisky and soda. The<br />
waiter brought along a mixture which, while interestin in<br />
appearance, didn't seem quite to suggest the specification I had<br />
proposed. I tasted it. It was very a-reeable, but certainly was<br />
not what I had requested. So I said, Hey, what's this you've<br />
brought me". " vhat you asked for, Sir, a whisky cider". I am<br />
quite certain that Keith would have no such trouble with the A. B. C.<br />
or B. i. C. accents that we hear so effectively from him. </p>
<p>-3-<br />
Right Hon. Keith Holyoake Mine's a whisky and water.<br />
Right Hon. Harold Holt . ell, he is safer with whisky and<br />
waer perhaps, but if he ever did ask for a whiskv and soda<br />
he would get it in ample measure and correctly to specifications.<br />
There is one matter which does not seem to ha've altered much.<br />
Perhaps I should hesitate to mention it. '., hen I was in this<br />
room before, I seem to recall explaining to us then that this<br />
really was not ty ical of " ellington weather and that the tood<br />
weather would fo low later. _ ell, I have no problems on tiat<br />
score. Coming from Australia, any rain is welcome. ,. hen I was<br />
asked what I Thought about the climate this morning as we went<br />
to the . ar Memorial, I said " I only wish I could transfer some of<br />
this rain across to my own arid continent." This perhaps has<br />
some bearing, lr. Watt, on what you were saying aoout how this<br />
Trade Agreement was working out. I don't want to harp on this<br />
thing, but I would like you to have this special factor in mind.<br />
1ie have just oeen coming out and these processes of full<br />
restoration are not always speedy from what has proved to be<br />
one of the most serious droughts in part of Australia that we<br />
have ever experienced. It intrigues me that when some other<br />
country has fire, or flood, or some other natural disaster, the<br />
word goes out around the world and the hat goes round to well<br />
disposed countries, and wie are all hanpy to help a nei huour in<br />
distress. 7ell, I don't say that we have been in all that distress,<br />
but nooody seems to see drought in quite the same light, and yet<br />
in our country drought can have consequences far more serious<br />
financially and in relation to the smooth running of the economy<br />
than any of these natural disasters elsewhere. I illustrate this<br />
for you by pointing out that in this most recent drought we lost<br />
14,000,000 sheep, and in the State of New South ales we lost<br />
per cent of the cattle population of that State. Io'. the economy<br />
went on. Some people seem surprised and disappointed that it did<br />
not make the same rate of progress that we had made in more<br />
favourable years. I think we did very well to keep the economy<br />
running along as successfully as we d'id despite these great<br />
national and natural losses. but I do think thAt this as had<br />
some bearing upon the buoyancy of trade between our countries<br />
and I hope tha with more fav') uraole conditions now restored there<br />
should be some improvement in that respect.<br />
You have referred Prime aanidr ' Mri. s t. eart t echoed this<br />
that we have a great deal in common and we have many mutual interests<br />
to serve. really are a very fortunate set of pebbles in these<br />
two countries. . V'e h ve Joth been the inheritors of that splendid<br />
British tradition of democratic institutions and Parliamentary<br />
Jovernment and the acceptance of the principles of freedom and<br />
justice, the dignity and individual liberties of our citizens. This<br />
itself was a great heritage, and we have ueen the inheritors together<br />
of a rich European culture which we have oeen able to apply to the<br />
circumstances of these countries " Down Under". And we have been<br />
favoured oy resources which have enabled each of us to build up a<br />
standard of livin. r which ranks amongst the highest to be found<br />
anywhere around the world. Despite our short'histories, ; e have<br />
built these standards and that of course has a Dearing upon our<br />
significance, certainly in this region of the world, and in the<br />
world at large. You feel nerhaps even more acutel: than , e do the<br />
fact that in terms of nopulation we are small coun'tries in the<br />
world scene. : e are still pushing on to our first 12,000,000: you<br />
are moving on, I gather, to your third million. But we would be<br />
treating ourselves with less than the significance that is due to<br />
us if we were simply to look at this matler in terras of population.<br />
First of all there is the well known fact that great countries<br />
are the countries which produce great men. They are not to oe<br />
counted in heads of population. They are to oe counted in the<br />
quality of the people that they produce and lew; Zealand need bow<br />
its head to no country in the quality of the people it produces and<br />
the contribution which these people have made to the world in many<br />
fields of science of culture, of endeavour. You have produced your<br />
Rutherfords, your ellers, your Hillary9, * and scores of others<br />
whom if time permitted me I could mention, and we, your closest / 4 </p>
<p>friends, your allies, and your partners salute a great people<br />
here in New Zealand.<br />
But the other thing is that you and we by virtue of the<br />
capacity we have shown to increase the nroduction of our countries,<br />
do have a rating internationally out of all proportion to our<br />
numbers, and I can illustrate this for you 1 think, quite simply<br />
in this fashion. Let us take India and Indonesia for my first two<br />
examples. Indonesia has just on nine times the population of<br />
Australia. It has one-third the value of gross national product<br />
of Australia. India, with 42 times the population of Australia, has<br />
just about double the value of gross national product of my country,<br />
and you can translate these illustrations into New Zealand terms.<br />
You can see that when you have only got somethin under 12,000,000<br />
people but you rank with one of the highest standards of living in<br />
the world and you rank amongst the first 10 or 12 trading nations of<br />
the world, then you do possess a significance out of all relation to<br />
your numbers. But the matter goes even deeper than that. It is my<br />
firm belief that if your country and mine together are to have a<br />
greatness of destiny in the not too distant future I am not speaking<br />
of any point of time close ahead or even in our lifetimes, but in<br />
historical terms, in not too distant a future it will be because of<br />
the influence, the assistance the encouragement and the example<br />
that to ether we have been able to exert in relation to the area in<br />
the world in which we live, and in particular in South East Asia and<br />
the Pacific region, and we do have an influence beyond all<br />
relationship to our numoers. I know that your views are welcomed and<br />
respected by the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and the President<br />
of the United States. In my first week of office, I was invited<br />
both by the President of the United States and the Prime Minister of<br />
. reat Britain to continue the personal and intimate correspondence<br />
with them which they had developed with my distinguished predecessor.<br />
ow, Sir Robert was, as you know a man of international stature,<br />
and he was so reco'nised around the world and one could understand<br />
the great men of other countries seeking nis views and respecting them,<br />
out when they put that same invitation to a fledglin-Prime Minister<br />
little known outside his own country and only recently confirmed in<br />
office I think that established that it was the views of the<br />
Australian people that they were anxious to have, the judgment of an<br />
Australian Jovernment, a judgment and view which would oe expressed<br />
frankly, honestly, forthrighlly, and with every intention to help in<br />
finding solutions which were acceptable to us all. This happens to<br />
us, it happens to you, and we are so placed by Providence in this<br />
area of the world and with our oackground of democratic traditions<br />
and with our high standards of economic achievement to be able to<br />
help people in This part of the world. And we are finding, as I am sure<br />
you are finding, that increasingl our advice is jeing sought by the<br />
countries of the regrion. . e don' have to muscle our way into<br />
institutions like the Asian and South Pacific Association of<br />
Countries, or the Asian Development Jank, or other organisations of<br />
that sort. We are sought quite eagerly, we are welcomed<br />
fullheartedly, and we know that we have a contribution there which we<br />
can make. Australia and New Zealand, because of all these things which<br />
lie open to us because in the Commonwealth of Nations, this Lreat<br />
multiracial gathering , jwhich becomes more complex and difficult to<br />
hold together as the additions are made to its numaers, you and we<br />
think so much alike about the problems that arise there that our<br />
joint strength can make a significant contribution there. And so it<br />
goes around the world where we meet together for these international<br />
purposes. We have a common interest in helping to build satisfactory<br />
trading arrangements so that the nrimary products of our two countries<br />
can be marketed on the basis of a reasonaole return to the producer<br />
and in an orderly way, avoiding, if we can or as far as i'e can not<br />
the hazards of the season only Providence can lQok after that for<br />
us, and we must as realists accept the fact that there will be these<br />
fluctuations but avoiding as far as it is humanly practicable to<br />
so organise matters, these sharp fluctuations on world markets for<br />
primary staples, so as to avoid all those dislocations which occur </p>
<p>in our economic circumstances. In these, in so many ways, we have<br />
common interests to serve. In this area of the world we can make<br />
a' joint contribution to security, as we do through the Commonwealth<br />
Strategic Reserve as we are doing in our joint contributions in<br />
the conflict in Viet Ham looking like you, not as people who seek<br />
the field of wr because of an appetite for conflict but searching<br />
for a just and endurin; peace which will enable us all to get on with<br />
the . ob of building a better world order in the countries of Asia.<br />
So that there is every good reason, apart from kinship, apart from<br />
natural identity of habit of life and attitude of mind, for us to<br />
remain close together in relation to these common purposes. And a<br />
visit of this kind and visits of your people back to us, not merely<br />
Prime Ministers but others, can help to serve those purposes. I<br />
would mention Mr. i. att, that we have tried to assist this in<br />
another direction in my country uy making one of the perquisites of<br />
the Member of Parliament a journey to New Zealand at dovernment<br />
expense if he will choose to make that journey. This is the only<br />
country outside of the territories under our own immediate control<br />
to which we extend this privilege. Someone rather unkindly suggested<br />
this morning to me," ell, this looks as if we were regarding New<br />
Zealand as one of our own territories," to which I could only answer<br />
you can't win: that's clear." Aut I had hoped it would be<br />
seen as another manifestation of our intimacy, of our friendship,<br />
and of our recognition that we do have so many common interests<br />
to serve. Now, Prime Minister, as you krow, there were two gestures<br />
I wish to make but just before I come to that, which is the<br />
concluding part of what I want to say, let me make a special<br />
reference to tourism, because you will recall I said something<br />
on this in the course of our discussions here together this<br />
morning. I believe that both our countries have a great deal to<br />
offer to the tourist from other parts of the world. You have long<br />
had a Minister of Tourism, and you have lon had a highly<br />
successful tourist traffic. . e have had, of course some and it<br />
has been rowing quite steadily. hen I reconstructed my own<br />
3overnmen recently, I appointed a young and promising 1inister to<br />
look after this special field under the general supervision of the<br />
Minister for Trade my Deputy Prime Minister, and the Minister<br />
for the Navy, Mr. Don Chipp as nart of his ministerial duties is<br />
now Minister in Charge of Tourist Activities. But thinking about<br />
this without any special knowlede of what is now being done and<br />
something of this may already be done it did seem to me that<br />
we could help each other in this direction if we used our own<br />
facilities and our own resources to encourage the tourist to each<br />
of our countries to include a visit to the other country as part<br />
of the tour. The American who comes here might beencouraged to<br />
go on to Australia rather than back to Honolulu. The Asian who<br />
comes down to us as the nearest point for him or for her might be<br />
encouraged to see something of the beauties of New Zealand. I am<br />
sure there is room for some fruitful co-operation in this particular<br />
field. I have raised it with your Prime minister and his Cabinet,<br />
and I hope that this matter can be followed up quite fruitfully.<br />
I was thinking, Prime Minister, of what little gesture I<br />
could make as a guest, with my wife and my party on your shores,<br />
to express the good will and the friendship symbolically of the<br />
Australian people for your own and one thing which came to mind<br />
was that I might be permitted to make a gift to the Jovernment<br />
and people of two pictures quite large pictures. One of them<br />
is a picture which has a strong historical association with your<br />
country. Indeed, I believe it was on loan to New Zealand over the<br />
period of The Queen's visit here and that is the picture drawn in<br />
chalks of the murder of Marian Dufresne back in 1770 or thereabouts<br />
a picture by Meriam. Some of you who saw it when it was over may<br />
recall it. It seemed to us that this was a part of your history<br />
and that this could be back with you in New wealand.. But to balance<br />
things out a bit, I thought you should also have an example from one<br />
of our most distinguished of the younger school of Australian painters,<br />
Sidney Nolan, who now, of course, has an international reputation / 6 </p>
<p>-6-<br />
and almost an international price I mi. ht add a picture of the<br />
Kimberleys. in Australia. This will endure as your history endures.<br />
I* hope for Sidney Nolan's sake his work endures and also to make<br />
the gift more en uring I hope you, Prime Minister, will accept<br />
these from us as a sym6ol of the good will and affection of the<br />
Australian people.<br />
The other matter which seemed to me to be worth discussing<br />
with you arose partly from the fact that as I knew I was coming<br />
here I devoted more time, I suppose in seven days, to a study of<br />
New Zealand, its climate, its geography, its economy, and its people<br />
than I had in the previous 30 years of puolic life, and I found<br />
many things in my reading and in discussion about your country with<br />
which I was not familiar, and indeed of which I had been previously<br />
ignorant and it pointed up t&gt; me really how much better we do<br />
need to know each other, having so much', as I have said earlier,<br />
in common. . h-it you said, Mr. . att, about more space being occupied<br />
in the Australian Press by news from New Zealand struck a responsive<br />
chord with me, and I would willingly surrender a good deal of<br />
editorial space in my own country to you for that purpose. But<br />
quite seriously I think that, too, is a matter which the press of<br />
my country mi. ht very well examine, and I shall look for an<br />
opportunity o? raising that matter with them. But this being the<br />
case, I thought " I: ow what way is there that we could encourage a<br />
better knowledge" and I thought we might make a quite modest<br />
commencement on this out one which I felt confident would appeal<br />
to your Frime Minister and his colleagues, and I have suggested<br />
that we invite to Australia under a system of scholarships, if<br />
you could call it that, each year, two New Zealanders to oe selected<br />
appropriately by representative peonle a man and a woman: I am<br />
sufficiently conscious of the vote of the ladies in my State, Lirs.<br />
Stevenson, to see that we deal evenly on this to come to<br />
Australia for, say, 12 months, if that seemed an appropriate<br />
length of time, to have some study perha:-s at the Australian<br />
National University, of our history, our economy and our institutions,<br />
but also to spend a -ood deal of their time going around Australia,<br />
no matter how remotev they may wish to proceed, and there to see<br />
some of our institutions in operation to see some of our develorment<br />
projects as they come to fruition and to return to New Zealand<br />
perhaps to go into public administration, the Department of External<br />
Affairs, the field of journalism, or the teaching profession,<br />
somewhere preferably where the knowledge that they had absorued<br />
could be passed on to their fellow New Zealanders. I would like to<br />
call them Anzac Scholars, because the Anzac spirit is still strong<br />
in the hearts and minds of our people. 17e do have a National Day<br />
on 26th January, but there is no day in the Australian Calendar<br />
celebrated with more solemnity and with due observance than this<br />
dav which commemorates the forging of that wonderful tradition<br />
between our two countries and if it did not seem inappronriate<br />
perhaps they could be called Anzac Scholars, but the name is less<br />
important than the fact. I mentioned this matter to your Cabinet<br />
this morning. I am lad to say that the suggestion was warmly<br />
received, and if it has the approval of your Jovernment I shall see<br />
that effect is given to it.<br />
So Mrs. Stevenson and Jentlemen, here we are bound together by<br />
inheritance of institutions, traditions, democratic practices,<br />
cultures, by the geography in which we find ourselves, inspired<br />
and stimulated togetier by the possibi. lities tht lie open to us<br />
for positive and constructive achievement in this area of the world<br />
in which we live, and while these things persist and they must<br />
persist as long as our independence en ures for our two countries<br />
then who can douot the strength and wa. rmth of the friendship between<br />
the people of New Zealand nd Australia. And if in my term of<br />
office as Prime Minister of my country I can do anything to serve<br />
that friendship and to strengthen the ties between us, you can<br />
confidently rely upon this being my purpose. / 7 </p>

Concluding Remarks by Mr. Holvoake<br />
' ell I'm sure you would all like me to say how much we have<br />
enjoyed that comprehensive and quite inspiring address from our<br />
Guest of Honour. I am sure you will also oe pleased to know that<br />
our Cabinet has already approved in principle of the two proposals,<br />
both imaginative, that Mr. Holt has himself produced the question<br />
of co-operation in the tourist industry, and reciprocity in Anzac<br />
scholarships have approved this princinle and we will certainly<br />
follow it up. Thank you for all these things that you have said to<br />
us Harold. Now of course the occasion is for giving gifts, and on behalf<br />
of the Jovernment and the people of New Zealand I want also to make<br />
a ift to the Prime Mlinister of Australia. I decided upon this gift<br />
oe ore I knew of the munificence and the imagination behind the two<br />
gifts which he has made. Those pictures are really priceless, they<br />
are invaluable. To add to the ma. nificence of the gift, the<br />
Firestone, the Maori picture I have forgotten the name now it<br />
was until now part of a very valued collection in Australia. It is<br />
not just an odd picture they have picked up somewhere. It is part<br />
of their own collection, and so it is of tremendous significance that<br />
Mr. Holt should say today " It is a part of our collection but we<br />
th -ught rightly it beloned in New Zealand" and he is giving it<br />
to our nation. I am quite sure that our National Art allerv or<br />
wherever it is decided that it shall repose, will be delighted and<br />
excited, and so will all the people of New Zealand, about both of<br />
these pictures. Also the paintin oby Nolan. I have not had a<br />
close study. I have asked that they should be displayed along a<br />
table somewhere. I understand they are just outside: if you wish<br />
to have a closer study they will be there.<br />
Now the gift I propose it will not oe displayed right now,<br />
but here is a copy of it. Some of you will have seen it, most of<br />
you will have heard of it. This is a publication by one of our<br />
noted publishing firms, A. I. Reed entitled " The New Zealanders",<br />
an exact copy or the Folio which Her 1ajesty The Queen gave to<br />
us as her Yift to the New Zealand Nation when she was last here in<br />
New Zealand the original from the library of ' indsor Castle from<br />
amongst her Collection. She thought this wis something we would<br />
like, and we treasure it, of course. A. H. Reed have made an exact<br />
copy of this. It is a beautiful piece of work: we think so anyway:<br />
and I am asking Harold Holt to take this back as a very humble gift<br />
compared with this gift to the people of ZZeeawl and to their<br />
collection of New Zealand treasures in Australia. It is a collection<br />
of prints by George Angus. They were made in 1846 or around that<br />
time. They were given to Her Lajesty The Queen. They really were<br />
in the first place I think it is shown in the script in the Folio<br />
dedicated to His Royal Highness Prince Albert at that time. It is<br />
quite a treasure, and I would ask you Harold, to accept this rather<br />
humble gift, alongside yours, as a token of our esteem for you and<br />
the people of Australia', and also as a mark of our deep appreciation<br />
of your visit to our country so early in your long tenure of office<br />
of Prime Minister. 7 Y </p>
