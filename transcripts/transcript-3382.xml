    <content><![CDATA[<p>PRESS STATEMENT NO. 322Â Â <br />11 September 1974</p>
<p>The Prime Minister today announced the membership ofÂ Â  the Australian National Advisory Committee for InternationalÂ Â  Women's Year.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister said that the Government hadÂ Â  been, fortunate in being able to obtain in the people selectedÂ Â  a blend and balance of expertise and experience.Â Â  Ms Elizabeth Reid, adviser on matters relating to women, willÂ Â  be the convener of this Committee; its other members are:</p>
<ul><li>Ms Shirley Castley child welfare officer in Tasmania</li>
<li>Mr Barry Egan Trade unionist</li>
<li>Ms Irene Greenwood lifetime fighter for women's rights in Western Australia</li>
<li>Ms Ruby Hammond -member of various South Australian aboriginal committees</li>
<li>Ms Jeanette Hungerford -Queensland occupational therapist</li>
<li>Ms Caroline Jones extensive media experience</li>
<li>Mr J. H. M. Oswin Secretary, Department of the Media</li>
<li>Ms Maria Pozos active amongst migrant women in Melbourne</li>
<li>Ms Ruth Ross physiotherapist, active in many voluntary and women's organisations in the Wollongong area.</li>
<li>Ms Diana Waite -experience in problems of women in remote areas, particularly the North West of Australia</li>
<li>Mrs Margaret Whitlam journalist and former social worker</li>
</ul><p>Â Â  It will be the responsibility of this Committee toÂ  advise the Government in the development of themes for-the Year and in the formulation of a national program. The Committee will provide a continuing link between the Australian Government,Â Â  women's organisations and the community as a whole.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister said that his government was determinedÂ Â  that International Women's Year would be a year of realÂ Â  significance and one during which substantial achievements areÂ Â  made in furthering the opportunities for women in our society.Â Â  His government had already introduced a great number of legislativeÂ Â  reforms aimed at removing discrimination against women. Nevertheless,Â Â  without a concerted effort towards reducing entrenched prejudicesÂ Â  and attitudes, the benefits of many of these reforms may not beÂ Â  fully realised.</p>
<p>The National Advisory Committee is in a unique positionÂ Â  to provide a point of national co-ordination for the diverseÂ Â  activities already taking place within the community in areasÂ Â  concerned with women. In addition through the National AdvisoryÂ Â  Committee a national program focussing on women, drawing attentionÂ Â  to both the disabilities they encountered as well as the greatÂ Â  contribution they make to Australian society, will mean that 1975Â Â  will be a year of significance in the history of social changeÂ Â  within Australia.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister added that it is the wish of theÂ Â  Government that the expert advice of the Australian NationalÂ Â  Advisory Committee will help to create conditions in whichÂ Â  women can fully express their sense of self-respect, dignityÂ Â  and freedom and can properly make their great contribution toÂ Â  Australian society. In this way both men and women, adults andÂ Â  children, will be helped towards a richer life.Â Â </p>
