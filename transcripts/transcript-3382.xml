    <content><![CDATA[<p>PRESS STATEMENT NO. 322  <br />11 September 1974</p>
<p>The Prime Minister today announced the membership of   the Australian National Advisory Committee for International   Women's Year.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister said that the Government had   been, fortunate in being able to obtain in the people selected   a blend and balance of expertise and experience.   Ms Elizabeth Reid, adviser on matters relating to women, will   be the convener of this Committee; its other members are:</p>
<ul><li>Ms Shirley Castley child welfare officer in Tasmania</li>
<li>Mr Barry Egan Trade unionist</li>
<li>Ms Irene Greenwood lifetime fighter for women's rights in Western Australia</li>
<li>Ms Ruby Hammond -member of various South Australian aboriginal committees</li>
<li>Ms Jeanette Hungerford -Queensland occupational therapist</li>
<li>Ms Caroline Jones extensive media experience</li>
<li>Mr J. H. M. Oswin Secretary, Department of the Media</li>
<li>Ms Maria Pozos active amongst migrant women in Melbourne</li>
<li>Ms Ruth Ross physiotherapist, active in many voluntary and women's organisations in the Wollongong area.</li>
<li>Ms Diana Waite -experience in problems of women in remote areas, particularly the North West of Australia</li>
<li>Mrs Margaret Whitlam journalist and former social worker</li>
</ul><p>   It will be the responsibility of this Committee to  advise the Government in the development of themes for-the Year and in the formulation of a national program. The Committee will provide a continuing link between the Australian Government,   women's organisations and the community as a whole.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister said that his government was determined   that International Women's Year would be a year of real   significance and one during which substantial achievements are   made in furthering the opportunities for women in our society.   His government had already introduced a great number of legislative   reforms aimed at removing discrimination against women. Nevertheless,   without a concerted effort towards reducing entrenched prejudices   and attitudes, the benefits of many of these reforms may not be   fully realised.</p>
<p>The National Advisory Committee is in a unique position   to provide a point of national co-ordination for the diverse   activities already taking place within the community in areas   concerned with women. In addition through the National Advisory   Committee a national program focussing on women, drawing attention   to both the disabilities they encountered as well as the great   contribution they make to Australian society, will mean that 1975   will be a year of significance in the history of social change   within Australia.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister added that it is the wish of the   Government that the expert advice of the Australian National   Advisory Committee will help to create conditions in which   women can fully express their sense of self-respect, dignity   and freedom and can properly make their great contribution to   Australian society. In this way both men and women, adults and   children, will be helped towards a richer life.  </p>
