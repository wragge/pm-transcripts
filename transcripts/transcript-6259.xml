SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
MEDIUM AND LONG TERM GROWTH STRATEGIES<br />
SYDNEY CHAMBER OF COMMERCE 10 NOVEMBER 1983<br />
I am glad to be able to speak to the Chamber of<br />
Commerce of Australia's largest city at this turning point<br />
in our country's economic fortunes.<br />
I would like to talk to you about matters that are,<br />
I think, as high in your own -priorities as in those of my<br />
Government. I am going to talk about the requirements for the<br />
return to strong lonq-tern growth in the Australian economy.<br />
There is now widespread agreement that Australia<br />
has turned itf; back en the disastrous economic decline that<br />
began in 1981, and can look forward to strong growth in<br />
production over the next year or so.<br />
this alone will not solve Australia's economic<br />
problems. The effects ot the , agnation, the high and rising<br />
unemployment, that have been features of Australia's<br />
economic life over th: npast decade, cannot be banished by<br />
one or two years of growth.<br />
Australia needs strong growthi over a long period.<br />
Australia needs to replace the entrenched<br />
underperformance of the last decade with persistent growth<br />
in productivity, output and employment.<br />
We must use the next year or so of declining<br />
inflation and strong growth in output, to prepare ourselves<br />
for longer-term growth.<br />
This will require changes in attitude and appro-ich<br />
in all parts of the comnunity, not least in business. </p>
<p>But I believe that Australians, realising the huge<br />
social and economic costs of the poor recent economic<br />
performance, are ready to consider thosc changes.<br />
People are, of course, much more ready to accept<br />
change directed at promoting economic qrowth in an<br />
environment of optimism about the future.<br />
That is why our first task was to correct the huge<br />
macro-economiLc problems of inflation, declining output and<br />
declining employm': nt which we inherited.<br />
People are also much more ready to accept change<br />
dire'ted ac promoting economic growth if they believe that<br />
the benefits~ of growth are being shared eqiitably.<br />
' That is why the emphasis of my Government on social<br />
equity, including our commitment to an effective social<br />
welfare system based on need, which we see as being<br />
important in itself, is also an integral part of our effort<br />
to restore sustained economic growth.<br />
I will return to the policies and the attitudes<br />
which will be necessary for sustained long-term growth.<br />
But first let me review the evidence on the<br />
economic recovery that is now under way and which will<br />
provide an opportunity to address more fundamental problems<br />
inhihiting ianp-term growth in the Australian economy.<br />
We~ aro undoubtedly assisted by the United StE-tes having<br />
entered a strong recovery phase, which it seems will<br />
continue for some time yet and which has already begun<br />
to spread to other major industralised economies.<br />
This has already assisted our export performance in some<br />
metals, and will eventually boost sales of a wider range<br />
of gooO's and sarvices.<br />
Domestic demand has begun to pick up over recent months,<br />
with consumer spending on retail sales and motor<br />
vehicles having risen from the depressed levels of<br />
earlier this ydar.<br />
Though there is some concern about the spread of rust,<br />
the wheat harvest seems likely to be a record ani rural<br />
production and incomes are forecast to recover strongly<br />
from the drought depressed levels of the last year or </p>
<p>The pick-up in the housing sector is particularly<br />
impressive Housing loan approvals by major lenders in the<br />
three months to August were 28 per cent higher than<br />
a year ago; and<br />
Building approvals rose 12.4 per cent in the three<br />
months to September to be 22 per cent above a year<br />
ago.<br />
Interest rates have been falling, even over the months<br />
in which we have been borrowing most of the funds<br />
required to finance the 1983-84 Commonwealth deficit.<br />
Inflation has moderated to single digit rates, with<br />
excellent prospects for further large declipes over the<br />
next year.<br />
Consumer and business confidence are each strengthening.<br />
The various indexes of production activity show a steady<br />
improvement over recent quarters; and<br />
Employment has ceased its downward slide and there is<br />
every indication that the Budget time forecasts of a<br />
stready improvement over tho course of this financial<br />
yer will be realised or exceeded. The latest figures<br />
shcw that 82,000 Kew jobs were created, on a seasonally<br />
adjusted basis, between April, when we changed the<br />
course of Australian economic policy at the Summit, and<br />
October This year.<br />
The latest survey of the tertiary sector undertaken<br />
by your ow. federal body showed, in the words of the<br />
Chamber, " A significant up-turn in tertiary sector trading<br />
results during the September quarter and the prospect of a<br />
fortner imprcve~ nent in the December qu-rtar".<br />
The sirvey also indicated impreed prospects for<br />
profitabilitv and a '.. ow
Other private sector surveys covering other areas<br />
in the economy are showiny a similar picture.<br />
All in al-the signs are that this will be an<br />
excellent year compared with those of the recent past.<br />
Indeed, growth through the current financial year,<br />
estimated at about 5 per cent for non-farm product and over<br />
6 per cent in total product at the time of the Budget, and<br />
now looking better with revision of estimates of farm<br />
output, is strong by longer historical standards. </p>
<p>There is an even more remarkable turnaround in the<br />
trend, from decline throuqh 1982-83 to strong expansion this<br />
year. However, given the severity of Australia's economic<br />
problem, the prospect of one good year provides no reason<br />
for complacency. We should also remenber that the recovery, as<br />
alw-ys in the early stages, is as yet unbalanced.<br />
Private investment is expected to be weak over the<br />
course of this year, with much of the growth being<br />
attributable to one-off influ. nces such as the rural<br />
recovery and the turnaround in the inven-ory cycle.<br />
The most important task for the Government,<br />
therefore, is to broaden this recovery anJ sustain it into<br />
th.* future. This will require action in several areas.<br />
First, we need to ensure that all major sectors<br />
contribute appropriately to growth, so that no single sector<br />
is stre-tched beyond sustainable ex: pansion, and that<br />
bottle-necks in specific areas do not retard th-overall<br />
improvement. The short lived recoveries in the past decade have<br />
all been narrowly based and too reliant an development in<br />
one or two sectors.<br />
This was particularly true of the 1980/ 81 up-turi<br />
which was largely generated by resources-related investment.<br />
Secondly, we must set our macro-economic policies<br />
to avoid the instability in interest rates, costs and prices<br />
that have aborted incipient recovery at several points in<br />
the past deca. e.<br />
We are aware of the danger that the coincidence of<br />
an excessive Budget deficit with strong gro,-th in private<br />
investment in the course of recovery could strain financial<br />
markets, raise interest r-. tes, and threaten recovery.<br />
This was one subject of representations by the<br />
Australian Chamber of Commerce, to myself and senior<br />
economic ministers in Canberra a month or so ago.<br />
W. believe that the early financing of the current<br />
financial year's deficit, with the Commonwealth making<br />
relatively light demands in financial markets after<br />
Christmas, allows substantial recovery of private borrowing<br />
in the first half of the New Year, to meet seasonal as well<br />
as longer-term investment needs. </p>
<p>In the next financial year and beyond, we intend<br />
limiting the Commonwealth's borrowing to levels that are<br />
consistent with strong growth in private investment in the<br />
course of recovery.<br />
In preparing next year's Budget, we will have<br />
regard to the prospective increase in the private sector's<br />
need for funds and we will ensure that the borrowing<br />
requirement of the public sector is adjusted in a manner<br />
consistent with this.<br />
It is also essential that we capitalise on the much<br />
smaller increases in consumer prices that are expected next<br />
year to entrench lower inflation levels and expectations.<br />
We believe that the Prices and Incomes Accord, and<br />
monetary policies designed to accommodate growti but not<br />
avoidable inflation, can achieve this result.<br />
But they will, of course, require the support of<br />
the whole community, most importantly in ensuring full<br />
compliance with the recently announced wage-setting<br />
principles of the Arbitration Commission.<br />
At the time of the Economic Summit some work was<br />
published which showed that, to reduce unemployment even to<br />
the levels which we might have considered tolerable just a<br />
few years ago we r'm1st consistently achieve economic growth<br />
of the order cE 4 to 5 pe, cent per annum over many years.<br />
Our economy has not . ianaged to achieve growth of<br />
that order consistently cver a number of years for a de:-ade.<br />
This is a state of affairs about which none of us<br />
can be complacent. What has caused this poor economic performance an-!<br />
what, therefore, can . we do to rectify the situation?<br />
Obviously I do not intend to nrescnt a blue-print<br />
tonight. However, I would like to raise somc of these<br />
matters with you and to give n indication of the<br />
Government's approach to tnem.<br />
Strong, sustained economic growth, at rate<br />
sufficient to make a substantial contribution to destroying<br />
the scourge of unemployment, requires movements in new<br />
directions across the whole range of economic policy and<br />
performance. In the araa of macro-economic policies, the new<br />
approaches which we have implecmented this year are necessary<br />
also for long-term growth. </p>
<p>We need steady expansion of demand at rates that<br />
will support strong growth but not inflation.<br />
We also need moderation in all income claims,<br />
within the overall constraints imposed by the growth in<br />
national productivity, and the requirement to allocate<br />
equitably the benefits of growth.<br />
The Prices and Incomes Accord provides a framework<br />
that allow adjustment to new circumstances as they enerqe.<br />
Strong growth over long per iods rc qui res high<br />
I? vels of investment from home anc1abroad.<br />
Australia's high rate of savings out of incomes<br />
provides a good basis for high levelj of domestic<br />
investmnent. Mos'. important oi' all is our investment ; n human<br />
skills our most valuable resource for economic growth.<br />
My Government is committed to raising the<br />
proportion of our young people who expe~ rien~ ce higher levels<br />
of formal education, to ensuring that the content of that<br />
education is appropriate to the complex modern world, and to<br />
improving support for a wide range of training and<br />
re-training on the job.<br />
Substantial first steps were taken along these<br />
lines in this year's Budget.<br />
Confidence in the durability of growth, long-term<br />
stability in policies, and policies that encourage the<br />
efficient allocation of resources to their most productive<br />
uses are also important to the maintenance of hiqh levels of<br />
investment. Even greater departures from past approaches are<br />
required in the area of micro-economic policies.<br />
As a society and national economy, AuIstralia must<br />
be more careful than in the past to allocate resources t)<br />
their most productive uses.<br />
This requirement is equally important in the public<br />
and private sectors.<br />
In the public sector, my Government has given<br />
special attention to the careful allocation of resources to<br />
high priority activities.<br />
The restoration of Australia as a fair society<br />
cannot be achieved without public expenditure at something<br />
like the levels of the recent past. </p>
<p>But we can get much more economic growth, and much<br />
more social equity, from the levels of expenditure that we<br />
have inherited. We have established new mechanisms, including the<br />
Expenditure Revie-w Co) mmittee of Cabinet, for controlling<br />
expenditure in line with the requirements of growth and<br />
e q uity. But it is not an easy matter to re-allocate<br />
resources in line with national priorities.<br />
The political pressures to maintain ineffective<br />
patterns of expenditure are formidable.<br />
As examples of these pressures, I need do no more<br />
than refer to the dishonest political campaigns against our<br />
reform of sunerannuation taxation, our propose&amp; assets test<br />
on old-age pensions, and our decision not to commit over<br />
half a billion dollars of taxpayers' money to construction<br />
of an Alice Springs to Darwin railway before having the<br />
benefits of a careful independent economic evaluation.<br />
We are determined to resist pressures for<br />
irreicponsible public expenditure.<br />
But we will be assisted greatly if we have the<br />
support of bodies like this Chamber in our commitment to<br />
efficient and equitable patterns in public xpenditure.<br />
Efficient allocation of resources to their most<br />
productive uses in the private sector depends on government<br />
regulatory policies as well as upon attitudes within the<br />
private sector itself.<br />
We recognise that there are many features of the<br />
regulatory environment that has developed in Australia that<br />
inhibit growth. our general approach is to let markets do their job<br />
where thev are working efficiently, but to intervene where<br />
this is necessary' to correct market failure, or to Eachieve<br />
s,: me clear equity objective.<br />
. We will soon be receiving the Report of the Martin<br />
Committee, which is examining the system of regulation of<br />
financial markets in the light of my Government's social and<br />
economic objectives. We expect that there is scope for reform of the<br />
fnancial system, to promote growth at the sime time as<br />
enh. ncing progress towards ouir objective? Of building a more<br />
equitable Australia. </p>
<p>It is widely accepted that the taxation system we<br />
inherited often discourages the allocation of resources to<br />
their most productive uses, at the same time as it<br />
distributes the burden of t3xation inequitably.<br />
The taxation changes in the May Economic Statement<br />
and the Budget represent progress towards a more efficient<br />
and equitable taxation system.<br />
We have been seeking further reforms which would<br />
promote efficient resource allocation and growth, for<br />
example through the rationalisation of distorting levies and<br />
charges in the resources sector.<br />
At this stage we are also seeking, through EPAC, to<br />
put together the data base relevant to further consideration<br />
of these issues.<br />
WitL the benefit of this information, the<br />
Government will consider feasible options on further<br />
taxation reform.<br />
We all have doubts about whether past industry<br />
policies are appropriate in current circumstances.<br />
As a nation, our prospects for growth will be<br />
enhanced the more we commit our resources to industries<br />
which are more productive, relative to other industries, in<br />
Australi than in other cuntries.<br />
Our growth opportunities are enhanced by our<br />
location in the Western Pacific, the most dynamic region of<br />
the contemuacy world economy.<br />
But we will be able to use these opportunities only<br />
if our econcmy is open to high levels of international<br />
trade. This gives . pecial relevance to the ongoing debate<br />
in Australia about the appropriateness of the existing<br />
levels and poittern of protection.<br />
We are committed to maintaining current levels of<br />
protection while the economy remains in recession.<br />
But we look forward to opportunities for gradually<br />
reducing protection in a future environment of confidence in<br />
sustained growth.<br />
In this context, it is sometimes overlooked that<br />
for our most highly protected industries, which are<br />
protected by quotas on imports, effective protection can be<br />
reduced by rationalisation of domestic production to raise<br />
productivity and reduce costs, even if there is no increase<br />
in the volume of imports. </p>
<p>For example, we believe that there is considerable<br />
scope for cost reduction along these lines in the motor<br />
vehicle industry, to make domestic production much more<br />
competitive relative to imports.<br />
My Government has no ideological objection to<br />
becoming directly involved in efforts to encourage more<br />
efficient patterns of production in industries which have<br />
been receiving high levels of government assistance, in<br />
order to realise pote-ntial for clear gains in efficiency.<br />
More generally, our industry policies will be<br />
designed to promote the expansion of our most productive<br />
industries, and strong growth in productivity in all our<br />
industries. Importantly this means making effective use of new<br />
technologies, whether developed in Australia or absorbed<br />
from abroad. Sustained economic growth will require the<br />
progressive adoption of such technologies both by new and<br />
existing industries.<br />
The effectiveness with which we apply new<br />
technology will determine the efficiency of Australian<br />
industry, its competitive performance and its capacity to<br />
grow. For Australia small business has an especially<br />
important. role to play.<br />
The Chamber's recent creation of the Small Business<br />
Association of New South Wales is a timely recognition of<br />
this. We rely upon small businesses for a great deal of<br />
the innovative and enterpenerial talent so necessary to our<br />
economic growth. As such, they are major source of new jobs<br />
particularly in the tertiary sector.<br />
Australia needs a strong, viable and diverse small<br />
business sector.<br />
This was recognised at the national Economic<br />
Summit in Canberra and small business is now represented on<br />
EPAC. The realization of Australia's potential for<br />
sustained strong growth will require many groups in our<br />
society to accept faster rates of chanqe than they have in<br />
the recent past : structural change in the economy; changes<br />
in technology; changes in the location and content of work. </p>
<p>This will be possible only if there is broad<br />
consensus in Australia about the desirability of change.<br />
This broad consensus can be achieved only in the<br />
context of policies designed to achieve an equitable<br />
distribution of the benefits of growth.<br />
This broad consensus can be achieved only if there<br />
is close consultation at all levels of our society about the<br />
effects of change.<br />
The Government has promoted consultation through<br />
the National Economic Summit Conference and the Economic<br />
Planning Advisory Council, and through a wide range of less<br />
formal consultations with business, workers and community<br />
groups, including on occasions like this.<br />
We are keen to promote consultation, for example on<br />
the introduction of new technology, at all levels in the<br />
work place. The Labor Government sees these concerns for social<br />
equity and consultation as necessary parts o-f a better<br />
Australian society.<br />
They are also integral parts of our ambition to<br />
sustain economic growth in Australia.<br />
My Government aims to restore Australia to the<br />
front rank of the world's economies.<br />
We have been putting appropriate policies into<br />
place and now look to all Australians to rise to the<br />
challenge. </p>
