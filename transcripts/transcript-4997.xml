PRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT 24 MARCH 1979<br />
INTERVIEWV WITH CHANNEL NINE AT LITTLE ATHLETICS ASSOCATION<br />
Question:<br />
Mr. Wran has chosen to ignore the threats of a cut in State<br />
funds in connection with the 37 1/ 2 hour week. How do you<br />
feel about that?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Mr. Wran has got a commitment, obviously, to the power workers<br />
and I suppose to the extreme left in his own Party. He was<br />
an advocate, on an earlier occasion. Hie lost before the<br />
Industrial Commission and now, as Premier, he is not prepared<br />
to allow that Industrial Commission to make a judgement again.<br />
The Commonwealth sought to intervene in the case because of<br />
the flow-through effects and Mr. Wran said ' no, we are not going<br />
to have the Commonwealth intervening we are not even going<br />
to let our own Industrial Commission make a judgement. The<br />
State Government is going to legislate.' It's 37 1/ 2 hours<br />
reviewed inthe year, and then he is talking about a 35 hour<br />
week. Now if there are productivity gains that are so great<br />
that enables this to happen without putting up the cost of<br />
power, and I would doubt that, clearly what Mr. Wran ought to<br />
do is to give all housewives in NSW cheaper power and industry<br />
in the State cheaper power and that would help in the fight<br />
against inflation and help in getting more people back into jobs.<br />
Question: Don't you think, though, that it is a little drastic to<br />
threaten to cut State funds?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
There are arrangements which involve, automatically, to a degree,<br />
increased payments from the Commonwealth to the State if State<br />
wages go up and if wages generally go up. When Mr. Wran pursues<br />
policies that encourage wages and the costs in this way to go<br />
up quite unreasonably and totally irresponsibly, then he can't<br />
expect the Commonwealth to subsidise him for it. We are just<br />
not going to. I think that what Mr. Wran is doing is he<br />
tries to say that it won't flow through. Mr. Hawke says it has<br />
got to flow through. Quite clearly he has given in on a particular<br />
industrial dispute. It will create additional industrial<br />
disputes as other people argue for the same terms and conditions.<br />
The Commonwealth is committed to doing everything it can to achieve<br />
full economic recovery. We are seeing the first signs of that<br />
in an optimism throughout Australia which just hasn't been there<br />
for many many years. This sort of action by the State Government<br />
is virtually a deliberate act of sabotage and Mr. Wran needn't<br />
think that wc are going to co-operate. There will be nothing<br />
to argue about in relation to this. If he pursues this course<br />
the Commonwealth will decide for itself what action it thinks<br />
it ought to take and it will take that action. It is not a<br />
question of negotiation really. It is not anything to fight about.<br />

Prime Minister: ( continued)<br />
He's stated the position. We will have to respond<br />
to it.<br />
Question: But he says that any reaction from you in the way of cutting<br />
funds will indirectly affect a third of Australia's population.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
That's nonsense. What he has done has affected New South Wales<br />
by taking this action instead of reducing power charges and<br />
reducing the weekly gas bill and power bills to the people of<br />
this State. If it leads to increased costs in this State, as it<br />
would, it will mean that it will be harder to get people back<br />
into employment. It is Mr. Wran's action that is putting<br />
the charges and the difficulties on the people of New South Wales.<br />
It is a very old game for the State Premiers to say they have<br />
not responsibility; the responsibility rests in Canberra.<br />
Mr. Wran is going to have to take responsibility for this.<br />
