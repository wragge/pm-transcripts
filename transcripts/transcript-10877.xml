    <content><![CDATA[<p>Australians have been shocked by the news of the terrorist attacks</p>
<p> against US embassies in Nairobi and Dar Es Salaam.</p>
<p>On behalf of all Australians, I offer our heartfelt condolences to</p>
<p> the families of those who have been killed or injured. They include</p>
<p> at latest count scores of local citizens and a number of Americans</p>
<p> amongst the dead and over a thousand injured.</p>
<p>Terrorism is by its nature cowardly and indiscriminate in its consequences.</p>
<p> These bombings demonstrate once again the appalling scourge it continues</p>
<p> to be to the world. The Australian government condemns those responsible.</p>
<p>We are thankful that, according to our high commission in Nairobi,</p>
<p> it appears that no Australians have been harmed in Nairobi or Dar</p>
<p> Es Salaam.</p>
<p>We are committed to working with our allies and friends to combat</p>
<p> the threat posed by terrorism and will cooperate in any way that might</p>
<p> be useful in efforts to uncover the perpetrators of these bombings.</p>
<p>I offer my sympathy to the presidents of the United States, Kenya</p>
<p> and Tanzania as they respond to the attacks.</p>
<p> 8 August 1998</p>
