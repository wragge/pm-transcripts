PRIME MINISTER<br />
EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY CHECK AGAINST DELIVLERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
OPENING OF FREMANTLE TOWN HALL<br />
16 NOVEMBER PERTH<br />
It's not often a Prime Minister gets the opportunity to open<br />
a building which is 99 years old. The Fremantle Town Hall<br />
was already a fairly venerable building when I was a boy in<br />
these parts and I could never have guessed I would be<br />
involved in this official ceremony in 1986. So Mr Mayor, it<br />
was a great honour you did me when you extended your<br />
Council's invitation to be here today to open, or to be more<br />
precise, to reopen this marvellous building.<br />
Fremantle Town Hall has seen this city grow from a small<br />
coastal port less important, in fact, than the then<br />
bustling port of Albany to its present status as the<br />
acknowledged western sea gateway to our great nation.<br />
It is perhaps a commentary on the " Wild West" nature of<br />
Fremantle almost a century ago that the original opening of<br />
the Town Hall was attended by rather more drama than we want<br />
to see here today. In fact, someone shot one of the<br />
Councillors, a man by the name of Snook. The good Mr Snook<br />
may have spoken for too long, and I will bear that message<br />
well in mind today.<br />
Earlier today I was involved in a ceremony to mark the<br />
commencement of the People's Day Program. The concept of<br />
People's Day is'an inspiring one a day of caring as a<br />
community. It would be hard to think of a better example of community<br />
caring than the restoration of this Town Hall to its grace<br />
and beauty of a hundred years ago. We fully acknowledge the<br />
vision of the Fremantle Council in initiating and planning<br />
the project, and I can say with some pride that the<br />
Commonwealth Government contributed $ 3.2 million to ensuring<br />
its completion. But in the final analysis the success of<br />
the restoration depended on the skill, experience, and<br />
dedication of individual craftsmen and workers. I<br />
understand that all sorts of problems were encountered as<br />
efforts were made to make the restoration as authentic as<br />
possible. What we see today is virtually the same sights,<br />
colours, and textures that greeted our forebears on that day<br />
in June 1887 when the populace of Fremantle turned up in<br />
their thousands to admire their new Town Hall. </p>
<p>And it is pleasant to note that the expectations of the<br />
people of Fremantle in regard to the quality of local<br />
government dispensed from their Town Hall were not<br />
disappointed. Fremantle has maintained, from its earliest<br />
days, an enviable standard of public service at the local<br />
government level a standard still being met today.<br />
For far too long, too little recognition has been given to<br />
the important role that local government plays in the<br />
administration and welfare of this country. Such cursory<br />
regard is hard to understand when one realises that local<br />
government, of the three spheres of Government, has the most<br />
immediate and obvious impact on the daily lives of many,<br />
perhaps most, Australians. Local government plays a key<br />
role in providing essential facilities and services at the<br />
grass roots level of Australian society. But for decades,<br />
local government could with justification have been called<br />
the poor relation of the public sector in Australia. When<br />
we were elected in 1983, we resolved to do our best to<br />
correct this situation.<br />
Our first action was to establish the first Ministry for<br />
Local Government in 1983.<br />
Since then we have expanded and developed the Commonwealth<br />
Office of Local Government. In contrast to its condition<br />
before 1983, it now has the resources and expertise to<br />
effectively advise the government on local government<br />
matters and to fight the local government cause within the<br />
Commonwealth bureaucracy.<br />
We have backed our words of support for local government<br />
with funds. In the year just completed, 1985/ 86, the<br />
government provided over $ 1 billion to local government a<br />
level of 50% higher than in the last year of the Fraser<br />
Government. And for this year we have taken steps to ensure that the key<br />
part of local government's funding from the Commonwealth<br />
the Untied General Purpose Assistance Grants is maintained<br />
in real terms. As a result, local government has been<br />
placed in a more advantageous position than the States, as<br />
was also the case in 1985/ 86.<br />
In these times of economic difficulty and constraint, the<br />
new general purpose funding arrangements for local<br />
government represent a significant vote of confidence by my<br />
government in local government. The City of Fremantle will<br />
receive $ 948,000 this year under these arrangements an<br />
increase of 9.39% over last year's figure.<br />
An important feature of the new financial assistance<br />
arrangements for local government is the way in which<br />
co-operation between the three spheres of government is<br />
fostered. I </p>
<p>3.<br />
Under the new arrangements provision is made for all three<br />
spheres local government, the states and the Commonwealth<br />
to be involved in drawing up the principles that will<br />
determine the distribution of funds between councils in each<br />
state. Another significant factor in encouraging greater<br />
co-operation between governments has been the introduction<br />
of the local government development program.<br />
Under this program we have spent over $ 11m since 1983<br />
funding some 430 projects directly involving 327 councils,<br />
in all the States and the Northern Territory. These<br />
projects have concerned all aspects of local government<br />
activity, including the development of skills in management,<br />
planning, environmental improvement and service delivery.<br />
The results of these projects are now becoming available and<br />
action is underway to disseminate the experience gained<br />
throughout the local government community. Priority will be<br />
given to this task in the year ahead.<br />
Because of our recognition of the essential role played by<br />
local government we have taken other steps to strengthen and<br />
improve local government's position.<br />
In last year's budget we introduced new arrangements to<br />
permit the deductibility for income tax purposes of expenses<br />
incurred in local government elections. This was a reform<br />
long overdue and brought the local government situation into<br />
line with that applying to State and Commonwealth elections.<br />
We have taken steps to ensure that local government is<br />
represented at key national economic forums. The Australian<br />
Council of Local Government Associations is represented, for<br />
instance, on the Economic Planning Advisory Council and<br />
makes a valuable contribution to its work.<br />
We have encouraged and assisted local government in its<br />
rightful claim to be included in the Australian<br />
constitution, supporting your representatives at the<br />
Constitutional Convention in Brisbane last year and ensuring<br />
that local government is adequately represented on the<br />
Constitutional Commission we established recently.<br />
I am hopeful that firm recommendations will now come from<br />
the Constitutional Commission, enabling us to proceed to<br />
changes in the Constitution which will give local government<br />
proper recognition. There is no doubt in my mind that such<br />
recognition is long overdue.<br />
We remain committed to supporting local government as the<br />
key area of the public sector in providing many essential<br />
community services. Its direct contact with the local<br />
community places it in a unique position to meet these vital<br />
tasks. </p>
<p>4.<br />
But I must not forget the reason for my invitation to be<br />
here today. Let me express the wish that the second century<br />
of local government in Fremantle will be at least as<br />
successful as the first. With that wish, I have pleasure in<br />
again declaring the Fremantle Town Hall open. </p>
