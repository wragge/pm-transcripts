FOR PRESS 5 MARCH 1979<br />
Commonwealth Assistance to Queensland<br />
in respect of Cyclone " Kerry"<br />
The Prime Minister today announced that he had written to<br />
the Premier of Queensland agreeing to certain relief measures<br />
under the Natural Disaster Assistance Arrangements in<br />
respect of damage caused by Cyclone " Kerry".<br />
Mr Fraser said " I have informed Mr Bjelke Petersen that<br />
the Commonwealth concurs in the implementation of certain<br />
measures to assist those suffereing personal hardship and<br />
distress, and for the restoration of public assets and<br />
emergency protection and repair work by State, local and<br />
semi-government authorities under the same terms applying<br />
to the damage done earlier this year by Cyclone " Peter".<br />
Mr Fraser also said that as damage from Cyclone " Kerry"<br />
had followed so closely on previous flood damage in North<br />
Queensland during January and February ( including that caused<br />
by Cyclone " Peter"), the Commonwealth had agreed to the lot<br />
being treated as one disaster for administrative purposes<br />
under the Natural Disaster Assistance Arrangements, as<br />
this gould be of significant help to Queensland. </p>
