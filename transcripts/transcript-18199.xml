The Australian Government warmly welcomed Gilad Shalit's release from captivity today.</p>
<p>Mr Shalit was captured in a raid by the armed wing of Hamas in June 2006.</p>
<p>He has been held in the Gaza strip by Hamas since that time.</p>
<p>Gilad Shalit's captivity was as inhumane as it was unjustified. </p>
<p>In addition to his detention, he was deprived of the right to be in contact with his family.</p>
<p>Through five long years, Gilad Shalit was in the thoughts of Australians, many of whom campaigned for his release.</p>
<p>We wish Gilad and his family well for their reunion and for their future. </p>
