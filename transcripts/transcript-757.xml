.1963 AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP CON'VENTION<br />
THE RIGHT HONORABLE SIR ROBERT MENZIES, M. P.,<br />
PRI. E MINISTER OF AUSTRALIA.<br />
Sir, Mr. Calwell, Dr. Schnyder, ladies and gentlemen;<br />
Arthur Calwell and I have both had a pretty good<br />
write-up or a speak-up this morning, I because I have now<br />
become a thistle and he because he has just become a celebrated<br />
author. It used to be said, " Oh that mine adversary had<br />
written a book." Well, he has written a book. What is more,<br />
I am going to buy a few copies to present to my friends for<br />
the very good reason that if it turns out that what he has<br />
written is unconvincing it will do me a lot of good, and<br />
if it is convincing I shall have to mend my methods.<br />
As for being a thistle, I met my old friend and<br />
political opponent, John Dedman, yesterday and I dare say that<br />
he is here this morning. He took up with me the question of<br />
the interpretation of the motto of this order which I had<br />
thought to mean, " Wha daur meddle wi' me!" " Who dares to<br />
meddle with me!" But he assured me, if I remember accurately,<br />
that the interpretation is, " Meddle with me and I will jag you".<br />
I will check up on that and tell him about it when I see him.<br />
The accent of this conference is on youth. Really<br />
remarkable things have happened in my own political liftime.<br />
It does not seem so long ago although it is about 25 years ago<br />
that we had some experts brought to Australia who issued, with<br />
all the confidence of statisticians, a prognosis of future<br />
population trends in this country. They assured us that the<br />
population of Australia woul never be more than 7,500,000,<br />
that it would reach that total about 1975 and that, thereafter,<br />
the population would begin to decline. You know, one cannot<br />
argue about figures. Thqre they were.<br />
.4 </p>
<p>Another remarkable thing was undoubtedly happening at<br />
that time. Through the activities of' medical science and because<br />
of important measuxes of public health the expectation of life in<br />
Australia was growing very rapidly. For example, the expectation<br />
of' life of' a male child when I was born was about 50 years. Now,<br />
it is about 70 years. This process was going on. Therefore, a<br />
remarkable demographic fact was establishing itself' in Australia.<br />
That was that the number of people who were of what we call<br />
pensionable age kept increasing and the number of' people who<br />
were actively contributing in the earning phases of' their<br />
life was becoming a smaller proportion of' the population.<br />
That was the position just before the war and it was on those<br />
assumptions that a variety of things took place. You all know<br />
how these have been falsified in the light of' history. But<br />
nothing has done so much to falisify them as the immigration<br />
programme. And inside the immigration programme nothing is more<br />
remarkable than the proportion of' young men and women boys<br />
and girls to the total increase, through this means, in our<br />
population. The Minister was kind enough to have me provided with<br />
a figure or two. That is what Ministers are for when the<br />
Prime Minister has to open something. I was astonLshed<br />
although I should have known them at the figures. There<br />
have been 672,000 post-war immigrants who were under 21 years<br />
of' age on their arrival. A total of' 700,000 children have been<br />
born to immigrant parents over this period. In other words<br />
and. Mr. Heydon assures me the figures are correct one quarter<br />
of our people in Australia under 21 years of age either came<br />
here with their parents or were born here to imniigragits since<br />
the war. This has been, one of the most remarkable events<br />
ini our hinstory. Its sigxnificance can hardly be over-estjwmated..<br />
It presents pa challep'r tpu-saM oreJA qtltyg it preq~ pts<br />
to us a great sou roe Q f sa-6isf action, bec. 4' use it means that </p>
<p>3.<br />
the ratio which our earning population bears to the whole is<br />
increasing. Indeed, it has been increasing steadily since the<br />
war. It has been a silent social revolution which has been of<br />
immense value to Australia as a whole.<br />
There is another thing I should like to say which<br />
has been prompted by what I have just been saying about the<br />
proportion of young people in our community. We talk, do we not-<br />
I know you do, because you come here year by year with great<br />
public spirit about the problems of assimilation. Perhaps.<br />
we tend to believe that the problem is one of the native-born<br />
Australians let us say the old Australians conscientiously<br />
setting about the process of assimilating other people who have<br />
come into the country. But let us not forget that the receiving<br />
body, the total Australian people the body corporate of the<br />
Australian people has itself changed materially. It now<br />
includes a tremendous percentage of groups of children who<br />
have come here or who have been born here of those who came here.<br />
In other owrds, the assimilating body itself is not static. This<br />
body includes in its many hundreds of thousands people who,<br />
to use this wretched word, have been assimilated into the<br />
Australian community. So year by year, decade by decade, it has<br />
become a remarkably new community. It means that we are not to<br />
get into our heads stuffy ideas that some of us are of the old<br />
brigade and it is very nice of us to be dealing with people<br />
who arrive here. We must realise that, although some of us as<br />
individuals may not have changed very much, Australia as a<br />
community is experiencing a sea change into something rich and<br />
strange. These conventions provide a magnificent opportunity<br />
for us to reflect on some of these truths, to broaden our<br />
understanding of the problem with which wqe are dealing, to<br />
take pride in the past, and to exhibit courage and determination<br />
for the future. </p>
<p>It is a very great pleasure to me to be here. It<br />
is indeed a very great pleasure for me to be accompanied by my<br />
wife who, I would have you know, is at least as responsible for<br />
the twins as I am. The older I grow the more I realise that,<br />
although a good deal of hostility is to be found in the wo rld<br />
I know something about that there is a tremendous lot of<br />
generosity. People give one credit for the strangest things.<br />
Many years ago nobody rushed up to me and said, " What an<br />
extraordinary chap you are to have a family of a couple of sons<br />
and a daughter". Oh, no! That was the merest commonplace.<br />
Nowadays, if I go to a club or some other place where men gather<br />
together I find myself saying to somebody, " You have some grandchildren,<br />
have you not, old chap?" He replies, " Oh yes, I have<br />
seven." Then I preen myself and say, " I have nine". Then he<br />
congratulates me and shakes hands with me. Not only for the<br />
earlier reasons I have mentioned but also for this reason, I<br />
think that this is a rapidly improving community.<br />
Sir, I shall not occupy your time further. As I<br />
have said, it is a privilege for me to be here. It is a very<br />
great piece of luck that before I have finished I have remembered<br />
why I am here. I declare the convention open.<br />
