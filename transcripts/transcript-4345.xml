JOHN ARMSTRONG'S DEATH<br />
John Armstrong was a very distinguished Australian whose<br />
tragic dcath will be deeply felt by his countrymen in all<br />
walks of life.<br />
There is no doubt that John Armstrong was first and last<br />
a loyal and fervent Australian. He was proud of his<br />
country.<br />
As, a Minister in Ben Chifley's Cabinet, John Armstrong<br />
pushed hard for an Australian Honours system. In his<br />
24 years service as a Senator representing New South Wales,<br />
he displayed a great capacity for hard work and a wil. lingness<br />
to make a real contribution to the substance of parliamentary<br />
life. He bought verve and style to the office of Lord Mayor<br />
of Sydney.<br />
As High Commissioner to Great Britain, John Armstrong served<br />
Australia's interests with considerable distinction and with<br />
characteristic flair. His earthiness, humour and forthright<br />
manner won many friends for himself and for his country.<br />
The Australian Labor Party and the Australian people have<br />
lost a loyal and faithful servant and a fine ambassador.<br />
On behalf of the Australian Government I extend my deepest<br />
sympathy to Mr Armstrong's wife and family. </p>
