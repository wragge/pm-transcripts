SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
RAC/ CEPR CONFERENCE DINNER<br />
" THE ECONOMICS OF ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY"<br />
CANBERRA 11 OCTOBER 1990<br />
It is a very positive sign to see academics and policy<br />
makers coming together, as they are today and tomorrow in<br />
this Conference, to discuss some of the most momentous, and<br />
complex, policy issues of the day.<br />
If we are going to solve some of the critical environmental<br />
problems that face Australia and the world then we certainly<br />
need to draw upon the combined intellectual resources of<br />
universities, public administration and business.<br />
So I commend the Resource Assessment Commission, and the<br />
Centre for Economic Policy Research here at the Australian<br />
National University, for so actively contributing to the<br />
discussion and advancement of policies that will make<br />
Australia, and the world, a better place to live in.<br />
As a starting point, let me refer you to some comments I<br />
made earlier this week while announcing the agreement<br />
reached by the Commonwealth and New South Wales Government<br />
on the future of the South East forests. I told a press<br />
conference that I believed that it will be even harder in<br />
the future than it has been over the past seven years to<br />
integrate effectively environmental and economic decisionmaking.<br />
That of course is precisely why over the last couple of<br />
years I have initiated new processes to analyse and resolve<br />
these issues notably the ecologically sustainable<br />
development working groups and the Resource Assessment<br />
Commission. These processes are designed to bring together<br />
the full range of relevant interests developers, unions,<br />
environmentalists, and State Governments and to hear the<br />
full range of their views, so that the recommendations for<br />
decisions that. 1 merge will be based on the broadest base of<br />
knowledge that can be assembled. Differences within the<br />
community that would otherwise, and inevitably, hamper the<br />
resolution of these issues will I trust to a considerable<br />
extent be resolved while decisions are being reached.<br />
&amp; LI) </p>
<p>This is a very large challenge for us all and it will demand<br />
hard work and a continued preparedness to look at the other<br />
person's point of view.<br />
And essential to the success of the effE*~ t, of course, will<br />
be an improvement in the quality of the analytic skills that<br />
we all bring to environmental issues.<br />
In this context, one of the most notable, and welcome,<br />
developments in the discipline of economics over the past<br />
decade has been the broadening of its scope to encompass<br />
some of our key concerns about the environment.<br />
Not so many years ago, the environmental effects of<br />
industrial and resource developments were not considered by<br />
economists to be important factors or, if their importance<br />
was conceded, they were believed to be unquantifiable and<br />
thus, by default, outside the scope of orthodox analysis.<br />
That orthodoxy is now changing.<br />
Economics of course is essentially concerned with the<br />
attainment of human well-being. That re mains unchanged.<br />
What is new is the recognition first at the level of the<br />
community, and then rapidly percolating throughout<br />
Government, academia and the professions that human wellbeing<br />
these days depends on many issues including,<br />
critically, the quality of the natural environment.<br />
Economists now better understand that the degradation of the<br />
natural environment has costs for the economy, for society<br />
and for individuals. And they accept that those costs can<br />
be counted, and must be counted, so as to arrive at a more<br />
complete assessment of our overall well-being.<br />
Let me point to three innovations in the discipline of<br />
economics which are helping us incorporate environmental<br />
effects explicitly into economic analysis of policy.<br />
First, economists are seeking to develop new methods for<br />
valuing damage done to the environment. Putting a price on<br />
environmental damage forces us to recognise that the<br />
benefits of a development have to be set against any costs<br />
it incurs in the form of environmental damage.<br />
Second, there has been a burst of activity in the area of<br />
environmental accounting in other words, in attempting to<br />
incorporate into our system of national accounts the costs<br />
of depletion of natural resources. The Australian Bureau of<br />
Statistics is currently developing methods to adjust<br />
Australia's national accounts to reflect some of the costs<br />
of economic growth to the natural environment, and I await<br />
the outcome of this work with great interest. 2 V </p>
<p>Third, and as a result of all the foregoing, economists are<br />
helping develop policy options that may minimise damage to<br />
the natural environment. There are now vigorous debates<br />
over the merits of economic policy instruments such as<br />
poll~ ution taxes, carbon taxes, tradeable permits and other<br />
market based incentives for protecting the natural<br />
environment. All these advances in economic analysis are playing, and<br />
will continue to play, a major role in helping to resolve<br />
environmental questions. I know the Resource Assessment<br />
Commission is actively employing them all in its efforts to<br />
assess the questions that I have referred to it, and to<br />
develop the options that the Government should consider.<br />
Let me also express here, as I have elsewhere, my<br />
appreciation of the fact that conservation organisations<br />
representing the views and concerns of millions of<br />
Australians have also accepted the challenge of integrating<br />
economics and environmental protection.<br />
The contribution they are making to the Resource Assessment<br />
Commission inquiries is a very welcome and constructive one.<br />
Of course, like any large groups, these conservation<br />
organisations embrace a diversity of opinions. And as I<br />
said earlier this week, there are some parts of the<br />
erironmental movement who will never be satisfied unless<br />
theay get 100% of their ambit claims. To those people I say<br />
that in confronting these complex issues no one, and<br />
certainly no Government, has the luxury of just being able<br />
to apply one criterion, be it economic or environmental.<br />
The important thing is to arrive at an integrated decision,<br />
and it is that truth that is now very widely accepted<br />
th~ roughout the community.<br />
But there is another important aspect to the way the<br />
Resource Assessment Commission is going about its task.<br />
We can't expect economics to supply the whole solution to<br />
our environmental problems even the enlarged concept of<br />
economics I have outlined this evening. Economic values<br />
ar~ e, still, mostly expressed through the mechanism of<br />
p: xices, and prices are not a good measure for the ethical or<br />
aesthetic values that are also tied up in any consideration<br />
of the environment.<br />
There is no doubt in my mind that there are some extremely<br />
important ethicsJ,, issues underlying many of the<br />
environmental ds! utes which we witness in our society and<br />
in the world today. The question of species preservation is<br />
an ethical issue more than an economic issue; the<br />
preservation of sacred sites, the retention of areas of<br />
n~ atural wilderness these are necessary actions but they<br />
cannot be easily explained or justified within the<br />
parameters of economic analysis. Price tags are not easy to<br />
pin on them. </p>
<p>So I am pleased that the Resource Assessment Commission as<br />
an explicitly interdisciplinary body is identifying and<br />
assessing the range of economic, ecological, social,<br />
cultural and ethical issues that are integral parts of<br />
environmental and resource-use disputes.<br />
The-Commission has been asking individuals and organisations<br />
making submission to its inquiries to state forthrightly the<br />
ethical and moral values which underlie their positions.<br />
This is commendable because frequently, the disputes in<br />
question come down to differences in the basic values people<br />
hold. This is nowhere more clearly shown than in the difficult<br />
questions surrounding Kakadu. The Commission's inquiry into<br />
mining in the Kakadu Conservation Zone is due to report to<br />
me next April, with a draft report made public at the end of<br />
the year. Many people have suggested that asking the<br />
Commission to produce its first report on the Kakadu issue<br />
was a ' kiss of death', since the positions of the main<br />
parties in the Kakadu issue are so very deeply entrenched.<br />
Let me simply express my very great confidence that I will<br />
receive from Justice Stewart and the RAC Commissioners a<br />
report that reflects the independence, professionalism and<br />
high calibre of their work and that of the Commission's<br />
staff. I am wholly confident that whatever conclusions the<br />
Commissioners reach will be reached only after all the<br />
issues have been weighed up, so as to determine where the<br />
best interests of Australians as a whole truly lie.<br />
Further down the track is the RAC inquiry, that I<br />
foreshadowed in my Environment Statement last year, into<br />
Coastal Zone Management issues. The Government has decided<br />
that an initial reference will address Building, Tourism and<br />
Associated Development. I appreciate that the management,<br />
conservation and development of the coastal zone involves a<br />
huge range of very complex issues, and I have recently<br />
written to State Premiers and Territory Chief Ministers<br />
proposing detailed consultations on draft terms of<br />
reference. Consultation will also take place with other<br />
relevant interest groups prior to finalising the terms of<br />
reference. I am grateful for your invitation to address you tonight and<br />
I regret that I can't stay for dinner. You probably know<br />
that I have an appointment in the Cabinet Room this evening<br />
at which these very issues I have been talking about the<br />
integration of economic and environmental considerations<br />
will be once again confronted, this time in relation to the<br />
question of greenhouse gas emission targets.<br />
You will appreciate that I can't tell you anything about the<br />
substance of our deliberations themselves.<br />
But I do want to say this. When the decision is made, I<br />
urge you to look closely at it, and to consider the issues<br />
that underpin it. </p>
<p>When we reached our decision in Cabinet over Wesley Vale<br />
last: year, we were accused, by those people who didn't study<br />
the full decision properly, of being too green.<br />
When we announced our decision this week over the South East<br />
forests, the same lack of careful study led us to being<br />
labelled excessively pro-development, with our so-called<br />
green credentials fading.<br />
But the truth is, not surprisingly, more complex for what<br />
we have done consistently is to make decisions on their<br />
merits, and not on the basis of lobbying campaigns or of<br />
emotional appeals by any side. So it's not a question of<br />
being pro-green or pro-development. It's a question of<br />
being pro-Australian, and the sooner we get our collective<br />
minds around that concept the better we will all be.<br />
This Conference will help play an important role in that<br />
task, and I wish you well in that. ;~ s~ ci<br />
