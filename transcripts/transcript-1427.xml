CITIZENS' DINNER<br />
MELBOURNE<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, Mr. Harold Holt<br />
3RD NOVEMBER, 1966<br />
Mr. Chairman, My Lord Mayor, Mr. Perrett, Organizing Genius Noel<br />
Curphey, Distinguished Gentlemen I don't say " Guests" because I'm<br />
not too sure about that<br />
I suspect you've been mulcted as most of us have this sporting<br />
week here in Melbourne. But thank you very warmly indeed for the way in<br />
which you have not only greeted the toast, and if I may, Mr. Perrett, I<br />
would like to say how much I thank you for your generous words and for<br />
this scroll which I shall cherish as long as I shall live and which I believe<br />
will be carried around as a reference for such employment as they may<br />
need by the members of my family.<br />
I am particularly appreciative of what you have had to say about<br />
that remarkable woman, my wife. It is not generally known that her second<br />
name is Kate not Kate for short, but Kate for long. And Kate is the<br />
daughter of a Scots -born McDonald. So if I can't become a Knight of the<br />
Thistle, at least I am keeping close to the Scots! She also happens to be<br />
so we believe on her paternal side, a direct descendant of Charles Dickens,<br />
and I only wish she had taken time off to write a speech for me tonight as<br />
appropriate as that that Mr. Perrett has just employed. But having read<br />
this rather lyrically-expressed description in the menu and having heard<br />
that warm-hearted and somewhat ebullient tribute from Mr. Perrett, I feel<br />
a bit like the company that has decided it hasn't quite lived up to its<br />
prospectus. At least while the words are still in the prospectus it feels it<br />
has got to keep on trying and declare a useful dividend sometime. Well<br />
that is what I am hoping to do for this wonderful country which it is my<br />
great honour and pride to lead as Prime Minister at this time.<br />
A very great man in my judgment at any rate who served us<br />
magnificently as Governor-General, wrote to me some little time ago on<br />
a matter which had interested him, and he concluded what he had to say in<br />
his letter to me with the sentence: " What a fascinating time to be Prime<br />
Minister of Australia! And surely there is not one of you around this<br />
room who wouldifr echo that sentence. There may be all the problems, all<br />
the worries, all the tribulations I thought I'd reached the peak of these<br />
when I was Treasurer. I used to look at my distinguished leader and think,<br />
" tIt's all right for you, all this honour and glory, while I'm doing so much<br />
of the work in the background here". I suppose Billy McMahon feels that<br />
way about me now. But when I discovered that I was the goldfish in the<br />
bowl, I realized how much one had foregone of some of the pleasanter<br />
things that one found to do in earlier Ministerial representation. But it<br />
is a well-accepted sacrifice that's not the word, because it is an honour<br />
and a distinction which I treasure, and I hope that I can prove worthy of it.<br />
You've been kind enough tonight to encourage me to believe that already<br />
: in somewhat less than a year I have been able to project not only my own<br />
individuality but something of the thrusting, eager, individualistic<br />
adventurism of this wonderful country of ours to the rest of the world.<br />
And I believe this is how the rest of the world is viewing us at this time. </p>
<p>-2<br />
It Is, as was so well said, a fascinating time, and I will say more about<br />
that a little later.<br />
I should warn you that Noel Curphey has organized everything so<br />
magnificently that the band that you have heard playing so splendidly here<br />
tonight actually comes from the heart of my electorate. You may have seen<br />
me go along a little earlier and tell the boys how well they were doing. Well,<br />
this is not entirely related to the events of the next few weeks, but I hadn't<br />
seen much of them since January and one doesn't want to be overlooked In<br />
these matters entirely. But he thought of everything, and as I look around<br />
this room here tonight, I not only sense a friendly warmth but I can see so<br />
many friendly faces of people who have known me from my earliest days<br />
in politics, some even beyond, and people who are eminent in their own<br />
class. Now Keith Rigg down here, he is known to you as a very capable<br />
executive in his own area of activity. But If you had seen Keith Rigg leading<br />
me on to the field in my shorts as the youngest member of his cricket team<br />
at Wesley, you realize the awe in which I still hold Keith Rigg. At least he<br />
got up close to Test standard and I worshipped him as a younger member of<br />
his school. And I see other people who are leaders in their own sphere. Now<br />
right down here In front of me is Graham Kennedy, the king of televisioni<br />
and how often when I've been asked to do a stunt In front of this terrifying<br />
medium have I thought, " I only wish I had this fellow's savoir faire and<br />
technique for this particular operation". All around, you see, there are<br />
the leaders. Now on my right here is the man I always believed brewed just<br />
about the best beer to be found anywhere in the world, until Maurie Nathan<br />
had the " courage" to take him on! I should tell you, giving me my guidelines<br />
a little earlier, Noel Curphey said to me, " Now there are not going<br />
to be any other politicians or public servants here tonight" and as you will<br />
have discovered, both categories at times can prove difficult or embarrassing<br />
to a Prime Minister. I saw two very distinguished members of the<br />
Commonwealth Public Service of yore here tonight-, both carrying wellearned<br />
knighthoods, in Sir Giles Chippindall and Sir John Jensen, and I<br />
dips my lid to them figuratively. They are great men who have done great<br />
work for Australia and may I say to them how delighted I am that they<br />
should have come out tonight to honour me in this way.<br />
But we do have a wonderful tradition in our Public Service which<br />
we ourselves have inherited from the British Public Service, and I mention<br />
this because I know there has been some controversy in relation to one<br />
member of the Service in recent times. There is this well-founded<br />
practice in England, firmly established and with very rare exceptions,<br />
followed here, that the members of the Service do not enter into public<br />
discussion or controversy. There are very good reasons for that because<br />
there is a special relationship which exists between the Public Service in<br />
this country and the Parliament and the Ministry.<br />
Now, this is not universally the case In the United States. They<br />
have a rather different system. The Secretary of a particular Department<br />
is by practice the Minister of that Department. He is the policy-maker.<br />
In our country, policy-making responsibility is carried by the Ministry and<br />
the individual Minister of a particular Department. He brings his policy<br />
recommendations to his colleagues in the Cabinet and they either accept<br />
them or reject them, and what is then accepted becomes the policy of a </p>
<p>-3<br />
government, exclusively drawn from the Parliament and responsible to<br />
that Parliament. It can only survive while it maintains a majority support<br />
in that Parliament, and eventually when election time comes around,<br />
responsible to the electorate which put the Members there in the first<br />
place. And so under our system, the public servant is not the policymaker<br />
In the sense that he takes the decis ions on policy. He is the<br />
administrator, and he must be prepared to serve all parties who may<br />
secure a majority vote with the same faithful service, the same objectivity<br />
as he would any other. It is for him to carry out the policy which the<br />
government, responsible to the Parliament a. nd to the electorate, has<br />
decided upon. Now, it is quite clear that there are occasions when, with<br />
the authority of the Minister concerned, explanations are publicly given by<br />
members of the Service. During the introduction of decimal currency, I<br />
asked my officers of the Treasury to go around explaining how this thing<br />
was to work, and they did with objectivity and discretion, and that is the<br />
way the system works and should work at all times.<br />
Now, if there are departures from that tradition without the<br />
authority of the Minister, then It is to be regretted, and I merely mention<br />
the matter here tonight to a body of very responsible and experienced people<br />
because I don't want any doubt either in Australia, or importantly for us<br />
at this time, outside Australia. Whereas in the United States the Secretary<br />
of the Department is also the policy-maker, I don't want anybody to have any<br />
misunderstanding as to where we are. W7% e, as the Government, I as the<br />
leader of that Government, we are responsible to the people who have the<br />
democratic decision as to whether they approve or disapprove of the things<br />
we are doing. The Public Service, very properly, is protected against<br />
arbitrary Ministerial action or capriciousness, and they are protected<br />
because their role as administrators is clearly recognized.<br />
That doesn't mean that men of the calibre of Giles Chippindall or<br />
John Jensen haven't in their time been respected and trusted advisers of<br />
their respective Ministers, but they have known that the Minister has the<br />
responsibility for the decisions which are subsequently taken and that<br />
guided their own advice and their own actions accordingly. And they also<br />
knew that at the turn of the political wheel, they had to give that same<br />
objective advice to whoever succeeded them as the democratic choice.<br />
Now, gentlemen, I don't want to dwell on purely political matters<br />
heire tonight. A. very dear colleague of former times of mine, who I know<br />
is a friend of many of you in this room, once describing a critic said of<br />
him, " You know, this fellow would put politics into the Lord's Prayer".<br />
Well I find that on the eve of an election, anything almost that is said<br />
becomes political by whomever it is said close to the political scene. And<br />
so if I appear to be political at any point in what I say, do have that reservation<br />
in mind: Would I have thought this political if he had said it six months after<br />
an election has occurred? I don't wish to be political in any party sense.<br />
But I do wish to say something to you tonight about this marvellous<br />
country of ours, its opportunities and its problems. When you consider<br />
that we have an Australia approximately the size of the United States of<br />
America in area if you leave Alaska out of the picture I always have to<br />
make that reservation, otherwise it spoils the comparison. And even leaving<br />
Alaska out puts me out of sorts perhaps wi-th people in that country, so rich<br />
in promise but so cold in appearance. Therefore to makce the comparison </p>
<p>-4<br />
apt, and I think it is good enough, we talk about what I might loosely<br />
term metropolitan United States and Australia. We have approximately the<br />
same area of country to hold and administer here in Australia, and we like<br />
to think of ourselves as a young country that is not doing too badly. We<br />
are pushing on with our growth and our development, but whenever I get<br />
a little too complacent on that score, I remind myself that when the United<br />
States made Its declaration of Independence, in 1776, the total population<br />
of that country was less than four million people. just twelve years later<br />
our first settlement was established by the landing at Botany Bay. Well,<br />
they are now moving up to their two hundred millions of people. They've<br />
become the mightiest economic and military power in the world. They've<br />
done It by giving expression to the spirit of enterprise, those principles of<br />
individual freedom and personal liberty that I believe every man and woman<br />
in this room cherishes in this country of ours. They've gone out, they've<br />
taken their risks and finally they have come to a point where, having put<br />
Europe back on Its feet after the ravages of war, they, under a leader who<br />
has the courage and the imagination, the vision and the drive to see that if<br />
those same prlncples and that same drive, that same generosity were to be<br />
applied to the free countries of Asia, then the whole future of the world could<br />
be transformed for the better and that is what he aims to do.<br />
I have come, I think, to know this man very well and the longer I<br />
know him the more I find to admire in him and, more, I am touched by his<br />
sincerity and the earnestness of his determination to use the tremendous<br />
unsurpassed power that rests in his hands for the betterment of the human<br />
race and that was manifested through our recent Conference. It must have<br />
emerged in his contacts with you all here in Australia, but in Manila we had<br />
as successful a Conference as I ever hope to attend with as warm a cooperation<br />
amongst the seven heads of government sitting round the table<br />
there as I ever expect to experience. Not just as a " Council of War" as<br />
opponents and critics tried to present It, but as a meeting of people who<br />
wanted security, of course, for free people in Asia as indeed they would<br />
want it for free people everywhere, but who wanted also to see a world in<br />
which there was a prospect, some hope, some prospect of advancement for<br />
the hundreds of millions of people who are living today in conditions which<br />
we would regard as under-privileged, under -nourished, under-educated,<br />
under-provided for in practically every way that we consider dear and<br />
proper for ourselves.<br />
Now we are a very fortunate people, not only in the country we<br />
occupy but because of the standard that others who have gone before us, and<br />
we In our turn, have been able to achieve. It is quite a remarkable thing<br />
that this country, a small country in terms of numbers, should have built<br />
up in not very hospitable territory, one of the highest living standards in<br />
the world, that we should be able to point to the highest percentage of<br />
home-ownership in the world, that among the amenities of life we should<br />
rank third in that necessity as It has become the motor car that despite<br />
the fact that we have to bring capital into this country for our own<br />
development we rank amongst the first four or five countries in the world<br />
in the aid that we give out to others per capita of our population; these are<br />
all things that we can take some modest satisfaction about. We have just<br />
come through a year, or two years, of great difficulty for this country,<br />
not felt so much here in Victoria, but one of the most severe droughts in<br />
Australian history. Our sheep population which normally climbs up by<br />
several million a year dropped by 14 millions. In New South Wales they<br />
lost 25T, of their cattle population and yet we maintained a level of<br />
employment and activity which for this country was remarkable, facing </p>
<p>conditions which not so many years ago would have spelled economic<br />
disaster for us.<br />
We have built in a lot of insurances around ourselves. We have<br />
now the variety, the diversification of Industry and enterprise which<br />
enables us to meet these shocks as they come along and I am sure most<br />
of us who have had a fairly long experience of government were heartened<br />
by the way in which Australia took, without scar cely a falter in its stride,<br />
this severe handicap of the severe depression in New South Wales and<br />
Queensland of the last couple of years. It involved us as a Government in<br />
some quite unorthodox and unusual actions in the way of drought relief,<br />
in fostering the sugar Industry, in providing the finance for those whose<br />
stock had been affected to replace the stock, or at least provide the means<br />
by which this could be done.<br />
But this, I am glad to say, Is not only the modern approach. We<br />
have all managed to learn something out of the more tragic experiences of<br />
the past. I came into politics in the 1930' s. When I stood for Parliament<br />
we had just come from a period which would be scarcely credible to the<br />
young people of this generation when thirty out of a hun dred trade unionists<br />
were registered as unemployed. These things pass quickly from our minds.<br />
The Government today would probably be thrown out of office if it allowed<br />
21to 3% O of unemployment to develop and stay there without being able to<br />
take action effective action to remedy that position. When I came into<br />
politics 8 or 10% 0 of unemployment was regarded as, well, not a bad state<br />
of affairs. In 1937 the Trade Unions successfully applied for a prosperity<br />
loading on the Basic Wage when the registrations were around 8 or<br />
But we have learnt something and in the last twenty years full<br />
employment hasn't been a visionary goal, It has been a reality almost<br />
without exceptional months during that long period of time. Now I know<br />
that occasionally those who have to carry on a business, who have to look<br />
at their order books, look at the state of profitability of their industry,<br />
they feel that things are by no means as good as they ought to be and that<br />
there has been an experience of which many of you in this room I know have<br />
shared. But when you consider the long haul, that virtually since the end<br />
of the war, this country has never had, except for one month in that period,<br />
more than 3% 7 of registered unemployment ( and that is in one of those<br />
months which incorporates the registration of the school leavers who had<br />
yet to be placed it didn't last for longer than a month), we can count<br />
ourselves as pretty fortunate people.<br />
Now I said something about savings and that brings me to the<br />
point this is not merely a prosperous country, but that prosperity is<br />
spread with justice, with equity, with fair dealing around the community<br />
as a whole. I went to the trouble coming here to get the latest figures that<br />
I could take out on how the Australian people are currently situated in<br />
relation to their savings and I found that there are more than seven<br />
million life assurance policies held in this country of eleven and a half<br />
million people, that the cover taken out well it was in 1965 which is the<br />
latest figure I have ( at the 31st December) and the later figure would be<br />
considerably higher but then it was just 15 billion dollars of cover under<br />
those policies. When we come to Australians' capacity to save I say<br />
this because there is a disposition in some parts of the world or amongst<br />
some people to think of us as a rather thriftless lot but in point of fact </p>
<p>-6-<br />
there is only one country recorded in the world that saves a bigger<br />
proportion of its gross national product for fixed capital investment and<br />
that is Japan. We save 2757, the United States 175%, the United Kingdom in<br />
1965 18% O. I haven't got the 1966 figures. These are from the United<br />
Nations Bulletin of Statistics. But that's a pretty remarkable thing to have<br />
in this country. With the ravages which occur from time to time, the<br />
drought and floods which eat up savings that people have accumulated against<br />
such emergencies, It is remarkable that we should rank next to the<br />
industrious, enterprising people of Japan as amongst the great savers of<br />
their resources in the world.<br />
So we don't just wait for capital to come flowing in from other parts<br />
of the world; 90%. of our investment comes from our own resources. We<br />
are very glad to have the extra spurt to our development that comes to us<br />
from the capital which comes in from overseas and there have been many<br />
useful, happy marriages between capital from overseas, from the United<br />
Kingdom, from America or some other part of the world and an Australian<br />
enterprise. That's the way we like to see it with a good Australian equity<br />
participation in the enterprise that is developed here In this country. It is<br />
one of the matters on which we have been working as a Government. But<br />
we know that if we are to grow we have to bring in people. We bring in<br />
people to an extent which in relation to our population is considerable.<br />
We'd like to bring more. We've absorbed those people very successfully.<br />
I don't know any country which could claim a more successful<br />
absorption of the migrants who have come here than Australia can and<br />
this is largely because I believe there Is that national characteristic of<br />
mateship, that willingness to help the fellow who is battling to find his<br />
way In life which Is so prominent a feature of our community life, and<br />
that has helped to make It a success. When I was Minister I wondered how<br />
we would get on with the unions about this business and how we'd get the<br />
various crafts to take these people in with them; how the community would<br />
absorb them; how generously would they treat them; how warm-hearted<br />
would be their acceptance of them. What a tremendous success it has<br />
been. On Saturday I greet here the Prime Minister of Malta and we have<br />
in Australia the second largest community of Maltese in the world. It is<br />
not a community in the sense that they're packed tight in some pocket and<br />
living under themselves but spread around as the Italians have spread, the<br />
Greeks and the Dutch and of course the largest influx of all at the present<br />
time, I'm happy to say our kith and kin from the British Isles. And this<br />
is how we would want it. But If we are going to bring people we have to find<br />
the employment for them and we can't absorb them on the land because<br />
although the rural industries have achieved miracles of performance by the<br />
way in which they built up their productivity, they are doing it with fewer<br />
people than they did probably before the Second World War. So, largely,<br />
we have to look to the manufacturing industries and the service industries<br />
in order to absorb our growing population. And I think when you see the<br />
figures, the next lot of figures out on employment, you will realize how<br />
successfully we are absorbing those who come in, the school leavers as<br />
their time comes to go into the working community, the industrial and the<br />
commercial community. What opportunities persist in this country of<br />
ours! Now we are favoured in two other ways. One by a bountiful<br />
providence, which although it has provided us with soil that takes labour </p>
<p>-7<br />
and skill and new techniques to master for complete success, has given<br />
us a fabulous treasurehouse of mineral wealth which we are just beginning<br />
to discover perhaps not even fully but we are discovering in great<br />
abundance at this time. Who would have thought in the years when I<br />
first came into politics that Australia would turn up the second largest<br />
bauxite reserves in the world or rather the largest single reserve<br />
of bauxite in the world.<br />
In the 1950' s we had a policy of clamping down on the export of<br />
iron ore. Our known reserves didn't amount to more than about 4CUC<br />
million tons and now somebody has turned up successively, one after the<br />
other, discoveries, quite remarkable discoveries In Western Australia,<br />
and our present reserves are estimated at somewhere between 15, 000<br />
and 18, 000 million tons of Iron ore of rich grade.<br />
In recent weeks, phosphate rock, one of the great deficiencies<br />
of this country, has been discovered, I hope in considerable quantities.<br />
That has yet to be established or made known. But the nickel discoveries<br />
of recent times, the manganese deposits which B. H. P. are working success<br />
fully on Groote Eylandt; almost every month, or it seems to those of us<br />
leading busy lives, every week, some great new discovery adding to our<br />
natural wealth is turned up. Fortunately we have had the enterprise and<br />
so far we have been able to marshal the capital either from overseas or<br />
amongst our own resources to see that these things are brought to<br />
fruition. But It's not that aspect of Australia that I turn to finally with you.<br />
It is what Australia has discovered of Itself in relation to its own area of<br />
the world that has suddenly become tremendously vital and exciting for us.<br />
Again in the early years I spent in politics, governments, ministers and<br />
the community as a whole had their gaze directed to the extent that it<br />
went outside the Commonwealth of Australia to the British Isles, with<br />
perhaps one journey In a lifetime to the Continent of Europe. This was<br />
the sort of dream that people who were able to accumulate rather more<br />
wealth or savings built up in their minds, to get back to what was then<br />
described as " home", to the British Isles and then perhaps a few gay weeks<br />
on the Continent. That was about as good as anybody would hope for. To<br />
the North of us were countries barely known, certainly not thought of<br />
great consequence to us. Those of us who In our schoolboy days kept a<br />
stamp album would get the postage stamps and think they were very<br />
picturesque. And that was about all that It meant to us. It took Pearl<br />
Harbour, the events of the Second World War, to make us realize haw<br />
close we are to our neighbours in the North. I went up to Vietnam earlier<br />
this year. I left Canberra still answering questions up to the end of<br />
Question Time at 11. 15. That evening I was talking in Singapore to<br />
members of the Government there and the following morning I was talking<br />
to Australian troops in Saigon. That's how close all of this is to us.<br />
Saigon Is closer to Australia than Brisbane Is to Perth and when<br />
we had a Conference of Commonwealth Prime Ministers In London quite<br />
recently I had to remind some of our African colleagues at one stage<br />
because they spent the first six days of an eight-day Conference talking<br />
about Rhodesia and, admittedly, it is a difficult problem, the situation<br />
there. But finally I had to come in when they proposed another adjournment<br />
on this matter and say, " Well look, we've been talking for six days on this<br />
one matter while we haven't mentioned the affairs of nine-tenths of the rest<br />
of human kind". And to bring the point home I had to point out that Saigon<br />
was very much closer to Darwin than Salisbury, the capital of Rhodesia,<br />
was to Sierre Leone. It was the Prime Minister of that country who made </p>
<p>-8<br />
the longest speech of the Conference. " In fact", I said, " we are a thousand<br />
miles closer to Salisbury where we are and It is time we started talking<br />
about Vietnam and the problems of this area of the world.<br />
But they are not only problems of danger, and we know at the<br />
moment that we are involved in a great struggle there. When I say we<br />
are playing a small and relatively modest part, I think we can take pride<br />
in the fact that our part there is not seen as small as the numbers might<br />
otherwise suggest because the skill and gallantry of our soldiers has made<br />
its impression on the United States and all other peoples of the world and<br />
certainly upon our allies In South Vietnam. We are all under debt to them,<br />
and you made a passing reference, Mr. Perrett, to National Service. Let me<br />
say that In Vietnam a National Serviceman Is at one in purpose in endurance<br />
and In courage with the Regular Servicemen whom he has gone to join.<br />
And while I am on this subject let me just say a word. VWe were<br />
talking about migration, about the decison to call the aliens into National<br />
Service. I know there have been complaints and criticisms about this in<br />
some countries. Not all! I was very pleased to see what the Prime Minister<br />
of Malta had to say on this subject. I thought it was full of good sense and<br />
a sense of the fitness of the situation. And that is, we haven't thought to<br />
call up any young man of the appropriate age group who doesn't declare<br />
himself an " intending permanent resident of this country". And if he has<br />
come here with the firm and declared intention of staying here permanently,<br />
well we think it appropriate that he should take the same chance with the<br />
native-born Australians in the defence of this country. And I say to any<br />
who choose to criticise us from these other countries, we have in Australia<br />
at this time a community of about 270, 000 italians, 130, 000 Greeks, 100, 000<br />
Dutch, some of them of course naturalized, but these were their origins.<br />
Does it seem unreasonable that some proportion and it is a small proportion<br />
of their fellow countrymen of the appropriate age group should join in helping<br />
to protect them, their families and their possessions? I think It is entirely<br />
right and proper.<br />
I said that the thing I was really wanting to draw attention to finally<br />
was the Australian situation in this area of the world. We have come to<br />
know something of the problems of the area, but also something of the<br />
tremendous opportunities that will open up for us. Three-fifths of the<br />
world's population live East of Suez and they're tending to increase more<br />
rapidly than others to the West of Suez, not merely because they're a<br />
prolific people and have normally a high birthrate ( partly induced by the<br />
fact that in past centuries there has been a very high death rate and a<br />
relatively short life expectancy) but because public health measures are<br />
Improving and medicine and treatment are Improving, so that population<br />
is growing more rapidly than popul ation West of Suez. And it is in all<br />
probability that the population of the area will have doubled by the end of<br />
this century. Now that presents in a sense some dangers for Australia but it<br />
also presents tremendous opportunities for us. We are a natural supplier<br />
of raw materials and foodstuffs with great scope for expansion In all these<br />
directions. Here are the growing markets of Asia as consumers increase<br />
and their standards of living increase. And in this context just imagine<br />
what it could mean to Australia if President Johnson's dream of a better<br />
Asia, better educated, better fed, better clothed, better housed, better<br />
serviced by industry, building their own industry, what that can mean to<br />
this young relatively under-populated country. </p>

Perhaps that is the thought, Mr. Chairman, that I should leave<br />
with you in your minds tonight. We are living in an exciting country, at<br />
an exciting phase of its history. We are accepted in a way which would<br />
not have seemed credible to us so many years ago. When I came into<br />
office, thanks to the great personality and capacity of my predecessor,<br />
I was Immediately offered by Prime Minister Harold Wilson, and by the<br />
Pr esident of the United States, President Johnson ' t continue the same<br />
intimate communications and correspondence that had been built up over<br />
the years by Sir Robert Menzies with the leaders of these two great<br />
democracies. From the outset I was welcomed as a trusted friend,<br />
colleague and confidant and the influence that Australia is able to exert<br />
by our own communications, the views to our two great friends in these<br />
countries, is of tremendous consequence to us but also makes Australia<br />
a very much larger figure in the opinion of the rest of the world. Don't<br />
think that we are dragged along at the coat'-tails of either of them. We<br />
are consulted, we are trusted, the views we put are respected and I have<br />
reason to know that on occasion they have been in themselves quite decisive<br />
in their interests. And so we face together a future of gr eat promise, not promise of<br />
things which will come to us simply because we wish it so but because of<br />
an energetic, friendly people, who find that the means are there if we have<br />
the courage and the enterprise to take advantage of them. And It is my<br />
fervent hope that I will have a few more years yet as your own political<br />
leader in which to play some part in making of this Australia of ours the<br />
land that all of us wish it to be.<br />
Thank you for the way in which you h~ ve honoured me here<br />
tonight. </p>
