PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCE, RAAF BASE FAIRBAIRN, 21<br />
SEPTEMBER 1990<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Keating's attack on Nobby Clark?<br />
PM: I haven't really caught up with all that. I've been<br />
away doing other things.<br />
JOURNALIST: call the NAB insolvent and then<br />
corrected himself yesterday.<br />
PM: I'm sure he's looked after himself well. I haven't<br />
had a chance to read it all but I don't think that's the<br />
most important thing that's happened this week.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you confident that special conference<br />
will accept Cabinet resolutions on Monday?<br />
PM: I think it's shaping up pretty well, thanks.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, is it good for public confidence<br />
in our financial sector for the Treasurer to be calling<br />
one of our major banks insolvent?<br />
PM: I haven't seen the financial system collapse as a<br />
result. JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, Mr McLean the other day described<br />
the Government as diseased and said on Monday it needed a<br />
good dose of medicine. Are you confident he can't<br />
persuade centre left to that view?<br />
PM: I would think that would be the case, yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: What's your reaction to the claim that there<br />
was an assassination plot against you in 1988?<br />
PM: I didn't lose a moments sleep. I think there was a<br />
little bit of hyperbole going on there.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you confident you'll get ACTU support<br />
this afternoon for the resolutions?<br />
PM: I'm fairly confident about the outcome on Monday and<br />
all that will lead up to it. </p>
<p>2<br />
JOURNALIST: Will you be participating in those talks<br />
with the ACTU this afternoon?<br />
PM: Well I don't know. I'm available if necessary.<br />
JOURNALIST: The Service Station Association has<br />
predicted that petrol could be $ 1.00 at the end of the<br />
year and they've asked to reduce the fuel excise. Is<br />
that something the Government would consider?<br />
PM: I'll have a look at all these things when I get<br />
back. I just don't speculate on a speculation.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, did you telephone special<br />
conference delegates and suggest that if they didn't<br />
accept this resolution the Government would be in<br />
trouble? PM: I've had a number of telephone conversations both<br />
before I left and there was some talk on the phone while<br />
I was away. I've covered a range of issues in those<br />
conversations, all of which are calculated to get the<br />
right outcome on Monday.<br />
JOURNALIST: Would the Government be in trouble if the<br />
Caucus doesn't accept the resolution?<br />
PM: I don't, you know, I don't contemplate our position<br />
not being accepted.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Tuckey, the person who's been responsible<br />
for insulting a lot of your Members, has yesterday broken<br />
down in Parliament himself. Your reaction to that?<br />
PM: I hadn't heard that and if he has I'm sorry to hear<br />
it. Politics is a tough game and very, very tough and if<br />
any Member has been hurt to a point where it has that<br />
impact, I don't get any pleasure out of that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, are you concerned that you may<br />
have upset South East Asian nations by calling on Japan<br />
to play a more strategic role in the region?<br />
PM: I wouldn't have upset South East Asian nations. I<br />
believe I have very good relations with all of them and<br />
they would understand exactly the whole context of the<br />
observations I've made.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is it the case though that you'd like to<br />
kind of play a super powers role in<br />
PM: No, no, no, no. What I've said is that one of the<br />
facts which distinguishes the end of the 20th century<br />
from the immediate post-war period is that Japan is an<br />
economic giant, an economic super power and it is<br />
inevitable and appropriate that in the political world<br />
there should be some reflection of that and that is a<br />
view which I notice is shared by Europeans and others and </p>
<p>.11! 3<br />
it's inevitable that there will be some adjustments. I<br />
haven't attempted in any way to prescribe what those<br />
adjustments should be. But I know that just as sure as<br />
we are of any fact in life is that will happen and it's<br />
appropriate that it be done in a way which the members of<br />
the United Nations are happy with and in a way which<br />
involves a considerable amount of discussion. But it<br />
will happen, ok.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, just on the Raiders.<br />
PM: Last one, yes. You look as though you were there<br />
right from when I left.<br />
JOURNALIST: Who's going to win tomorrow in Sydney?<br />
PM: The Raiders.<br />
JOURNALIST: The Raiders?<br />
PM: On Sunday. I mean they haven't changed it, have<br />
they? JOURNALIST: By how many points?<br />
PM: Well I've got to about 6, about 6.<br />
JOURNALIST: Don't you think it would be nice to see the<br />
Panther's win for the first time though?<br />
PM: Well I understand yes, it would be nice for them.<br />
It would bee good for the region and it's a great region<br />
that they're representing. But you know, I'm a fairly<br />
strong supporter of the Raiders and all my friends in<br />
Penrith will understand that. I just hope that it's a<br />
good, tough game and I'm sure it will be. Thanks.<br />
