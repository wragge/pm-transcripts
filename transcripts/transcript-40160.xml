    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong></p>
<p>Thank you very much Admiral. Weâ€™ve just had a very good briefing and discussion with the CDF and I am very conscious that I am the only thing standing between you and breakfast. So I want to thank you very much for your service. Australia is so proud of you; your professionalism, your commitment. You really do us proud and you are doing vitally important work, not just for Iraq, not just for the region, but for the whole world. We have a global struggle against terrorism and you are in the front line. I want to thank you very much for your work, for your courage, for your professionalism and your dedication to this important cause, and I look forward to speaking with as many of you as I can and getting your insights from the very front of this important struggle. Thank you very much.</p>
