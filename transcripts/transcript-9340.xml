TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
SYDNEY AIRPORT<br />
MONDAY 29 AUGUST, 1994<br />
J: Mr Keating, you mentioned moving into Asia and jsiness. Do you<br />
think Australia's interests would be better served by a free trade area<br />
in Asia or a GATT consistent area?-<br />
PMV: Australia's interests are going to be buffered by getting trade barriers<br />
down. There are so many of them in the Asia-Pacific these days that<br />
getting them down is what it is all about. And, it is going to be a<br />
difficult task, to do it, but something which we'll all benefit from. So,<br />
the whole question about whether this is MFN or preferential is really<br />
ancillary to the main point, let's get the barriers down.<br />
J: Are you too far ahead of business, given the Asia-Pacific Business<br />
Network's opposition..?<br />
PM: I've never heard of that organisation so therefore, obviously their view<br />
doesn't matter very much.<br />
J-You were talking about airline competition which has freed up but has<br />
remained largely a duopol1y, are you concerned about that?<br />
PM. I think one of the things Australia has got from aviation, it has got<br />
lower prices but it has kept its companies intact who have learned to<br />
be in a competitive environment. This idea that you need to smash<br />
companies up to deregulate, and have then, a whole multiplicity of<br />
companies which then eventually evaporate is the messy way the<br />
Americans went through deregulation. I think, the way we are doing it<br />
is far better for consumers, for safety and for airlines.<br />
J: Do you welcome Mr Cowley's support for the privatisat ion of the<br />
Federal Airports Corporation?<br />
PM.-I'm not here to go around the world for sport, are there any other<br />
questions? </p>
<p>ends. TEL: 29. Aug. 94 12: 30 No<br />

J: How do you think Mr Hewson will go as the policy conscience of the<br />
Liberal Party?<br />
PM: The thing about the Liberal Party is, I think, it is irretrievably divided.<br />
And, It Is no wonder they've got no policies because they run around,<br />
they spend all of their time fighting themselves. I mean,-Alexander<br />
Downer, if he wants to look strong and command loyalty and respect<br />
you do it by inducing it, you don't do it by petulantly striking people<br />
down. And, I think, what's going to happen here is that the sort of<br />
divisions that we've seen in the Liberal Party in the eighties are going<br />
to continue. .010 P. 02/ 02 </p>
