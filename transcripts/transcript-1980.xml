The Prime Minister of Australia, Mr. John Gorton, said<br />
today that he had arranged for a meeting on Friday with Mr. Healey,<br />
Mr. Holyoake, Mr. Lee Kuan Yew and Tunku Abdul Rahman.<br />
They would discuss the place anddate for the next Five<br />
Power meeting to be held later this year. Friday's meeting, which will<br />
be held at the Australian Prime Minister's suite at the Savoy Hotel, is<br />
not expected to last more than 30 minutes.<br />
