COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA<br />
SPEECH BY<br />
The Rt Hon. J. G. GORTON, M. P.<br />
ON<br />
REDUCTIONS IN COMMONWEALTH<br />
GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE<br />
Ministerial Statement<br />
[ From the ' Parliamentary Debates', 16 February 19711<br />
Mr GORTON ( Higgins-Prime Minister)<br />
by leave-Mr Speaker, I recently spoke<br />
to the nation on the state of the economy<br />
and on the likely inflationary effects of the<br />
Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration<br />
Commission's award of a 6 per cent<br />
increase in wages and salaries. I said then<br />
that in order to decide what action should<br />
be taken now, Cabinet had sought to<br />
discover the areas in which demand seemed<br />
to be growing most strongly. One of those<br />
areas is the public sector-spending by<br />
governments-and we believe one of the<br />
first lines of attack on rising costs and prices<br />
should be to restrict what is being spent in<br />
that area.<br />
When our Budget was introduced last<br />
August it was estimated that total ' Commonwealth'<br />
expenditure would be $ 7,883m.<br />
I should say here, I think, that although<br />
called Commonwealth expenditure, this<br />
amount included $ 2,708m for reimbursement<br />
grants and other payments to the<br />
States. Indeed, such payments made up<br />
more than one-third of the Commonwealth<br />
Budget. The total increase was 11.2 per<br />
cent more than the year before. But since<br />
that Budget was formulated the Government<br />
has been faced with significant additional<br />
expenditure. The national wage case<br />
decision and other wage, determinations are<br />
estimated to add directly, in the rest of this<br />
financial year, S88m to the Commonwealth's<br />
own wage and salary bill in 1970-71. In<br />
11791/ 71 addition, those wage determinations,<br />
because they have led to an increase in<br />
average wages greater than was expected,<br />
will require the Commonwealth to pay an<br />
additional $ 20m to the States under the<br />
formula between the Commonwealth and<br />
the States. In addition, we will need to pay<br />
some $ 58m to the States in this financial<br />
year to recompense them for the loss of<br />
the receipts duty tax on which they had<br />
budgeted. Mainly as a result of these two<br />
outlays, payments to the States are now<br />
expected to exceed the Budget estimates by<br />
some $ 83m, and emergency payments<br />
associated with recent floods will doubtless<br />
increase the outlays required.<br />
Other additional demands on our<br />
resources since the Budget was brought<br />
down include the provision of $ 12m as a<br />
capital advance to the Australian Wool<br />
Commission, and we believe some $ 6m will<br />
be required this finanicial year for rural debt<br />
reconstruction and farm adjustment. We<br />
must also expect increases in costs of the<br />
material used by the Government. So all in<br />
all, it is estimated by the Treasury that the<br />
net increase in expenditure since the Budget<br />
was prepared would amount to approximately<br />
$ 242m, if departments were provided<br />
with the sums they have asked for.<br />
This is the background against which wve<br />
have decided that we should make reductions<br />
in what would otherwise have been<br />
spent. </p>
<p>Having made a complete and detailed<br />
survey of Commonwealth expenditures, we<br />
propose to reduce the amounts which<br />
departments have sought by some $ 75m in<br />
the remaining months of this financial year.<br />
These reductions are made across the whole<br />
range of Commonwealth departments, but<br />
they do not involve any reductions in our<br />
payments to the States. Our object has been<br />
to effect reductions in the Commonwealth<br />
expenditures for Commonwealth purposes.<br />
We have not sought to achieve this at the<br />
expense of the States. A dissection of the<br />
reduction of $ 75m as between the main<br />
categories of Commonwealth expenditure<br />
is provided in a table which,* with the<br />
concurrence of honourable members, I<br />
incorporate in Hansard.<br />

Further details of the various reductions<br />
will be provided as necessary by individual<br />
Ministers. These reductions are spread right<br />
across the board, but it will be observed<br />
that the areas where the more substantial<br />
savings have been made are defence, capital<br />
works and capital advances, and departmental<br />
running expenses. We were particularly<br />
anxious to effect economies in<br />
administrative expenditures, including the<br />
overtime and salary expenditures of Commonwealth<br />
departments. At the same time<br />
we have endeavoured to avoid reducing<br />
expenditures on essential development activities. In more general terms we have<br />
sought to reduce the contribution of Commonwealth<br />
expenditures to total demand<br />
and to curb the Commonwealth's demands<br />
on the labour market.<br />
Thus the reductions in departmental<br />
expenditures will involve restraint on Public<br />
Service employment. The Public Service<br />
Board reported to me that a routine<br />
statistical projection made prior to my<br />
instructions indicated an increase in<br />
1970-71, in full-time employment under the<br />
Public Service Act, of 4.6 per cent on the<br />
numbers employed as at 30th June 1970.<br />
In 1969-70 the comparable increase was 4.8<br />
per cent, whilst the increase in total<br />
civilian and defence forces employment in<br />
the community was 4 per cent. The Board<br />
advised me that my instructions for<br />
restraint on establishment increases could<br />
benefit the health and soundness of administration<br />
in the Commonwealth Service, and it<br />
suggested that a limitation should be placed<br />
on the increase in Service employment.<br />
The Public Service Board has now<br />
reported to me that in its discussions with<br />
departments, it has stressed the Government's<br />
policy of restraint but has not<br />
endeavoured to impose arbitrary cuts in<br />
employment in particular directions. The<br />
Board's recommendation, which has been<br />
accepted, was that departmental increases<br />
in employment, which will be kept to the<br />
minimum, should not exceed at 30th June<br />
1971 an overall increase in the Service of<br />
3.4 per cent as compared with numbers<br />
employed under the Public Service Act on<br />
30th June 1970. This is a reduction of<br />
about 25 per cent on the projected increase<br />
in employment disclosed in the Board's<br />
earlier survey; or put another way, the<br />
Board's original projection was that the<br />
Service would grow by 10,534 in 1970-71.<br />
This growth has been cut by 2,735.<br />
The Commonwealth has, I believe,<br />
moved quickly and firmly in the area<br />
available to it. It is necessary to do so. For<br />
as we see it, the best interests of the community<br />
require that inflation shall be overcome,<br />
and one of the first steps to this end<br />
must be action to restrain our own<br />
expenditures. I present the following paper:<br />
