USSR Speech by the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR,<br />
Mr Aleksey Kosygin, at a dinner in honour of the Prime Minister of<br />
Australia in Moscow on 14 January 1975<br />
The official visit of Prime Minister Whitlam to<br />
the Soviet Union and Soviet-Australian talks<br />
which have begun in the Kremlin today are a<br />
very signal event in relations between our<br />
countries, not only because this is the first visit<br />
by a Head of Government of Australia to the<br />
Soviet Union in the history of our relations. This<br />
visit culminates, as it were, the positive work<br />
carried out to date in many areas of cooperation<br />
between the Soviet Union and<br />
Australia, and, on the other hand, enables both<br />
countries to outline ways and means to raise<br />
these relations to a higher level. The talks just<br />
opened show that both sides have a desire to do<br />
this. Regrettably, we cannot yet say that the history<br />
of Soviet-Australian relations is rich in traditions.<br />
I think the reason for this was not a lack<br />
of interest in each other or of a real basis for<br />
development of our relations. Anyway, as for<br />
the Soviet Union, we have invariably shown<br />
readiness to develop equitable and mutually<br />
beneficial co-operation with Australia. I am not<br />
of course saying this to recapitulate the past. It is<br />
much more important that Soviet-Australian<br />
relations today are marked by new positive tendencies<br />
and shifts, which at the same time are a<br />
significant feature of international relations in<br />
general. Major changes are under way in the world.<br />
There is an ever more active search for solutions<br />
to problems facing not only individual countries<br />
but all mankind. These are above all the problems<br />
of war and peace, of improving international<br />
relations on a just and democratic<br />
basis. These are the problems of economic and<br />
scientific-technical development and social progress, the solution of which is a key to a more<br />
secure and better future for peoples.<br />
It is possible to say with confidence today that<br />
the world on the whole is evolving in a direction<br />
encouraging for all champions of peace and<br />
progress, and this consolidates the people's<br />
faith in the future and in the possibility to make<br />
life on earth worthy of man.<br />
This is demonstrably shown by many facts. If<br />
we take the sphere of international relations,<br />
there are above all the current assertion of the<br />
principles of peaceful co-existence of states<br />
with different social systems, the emergence in<br />
the world arena of many new states as active<br />
members of international intercourse, the continuing<br />
process of the relaxation of international<br />
tensions and the development of peaceful cooperation<br />
among states. There is also the overall<br />
strengthening of the positions of those forces<br />
which stand for the settlement of the historical<br />
contest between different social systems on the<br />
lines of peaceful co-existence, rather than on<br />
military lines. The Soviet People has an extensive<br />
plan of action in the field of domestic and<br />
foreign policies, which we are consistently putting<br />
into practice. It is the decisions of the 24th<br />
Congress of our Party and the plenary meetings<br />
of its Central Committee and the Congressendorsed<br />
peace program, on whose basis we<br />
build our relations with Australia as well. We are<br />
working for the realisation of the aims of our<br />
peace-loving foreign policy not by opposing<br />
some states to others, but are striving to do<br />
everything possible to join efforts in this direction<br />
with as large a number of states as possible<br />
which are also interested in strengthening<br />
peace. This approach is clearly visible in the </p>
<p>position of the Soviet Union on the questions of<br />
enhancing security and co-operation in Europe,<br />
in our proposals concerning collective security<br />
in Asia and in many other foreign-policy initiatives<br />
of our country, such as the holding of a<br />
world disarmament conference. We stand for<br />
making the process of detente irreversible and<br />
safeguarding a lasting peace for all nations by<br />
promoting broad and equal international cooperation<br />
and by strengthening mutual understanding<br />
and trust between states. ' Everything<br />
possible should be done,' said General<br />
Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee<br />
L. I. Brezhnev, ' to ensure that the peoples of the<br />
world live free from war, live in security, cooperation<br />
and intercourse with each other. Such<br />
is the urgent call of our times.'<br />
During the talks with the Australian Prime Minister<br />
we intend to devote serious attention to the<br />
questions of bilateral co-operation between the<br />
two countries. I think that unutilised possibilities<br />
and great reserves are available in many areas<br />
of our relations-in economic, scientific, technical,<br />
cultural and, last but not least, political-in<br />
the matter of strengthening our co-operation in<br />
the interests of peace and the security of<br />
nations. It appears to us that the Soviet Union and<br />
Australia can more effectively join efforts, in<br />
particular, in solving such important international<br />
problems as the ending of the arms<br />
race, disarmament, the implementation of the<br />
Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear<br />
Weapons, the total prohibition of all nuclear<br />
weapon tests, the solution of the questions of<br />
maritime law and a number of other problems.<br />
The foundation for the further deepening of<br />
Soviet-Australian co-operation in international<br />
affairs is seen by us in that the Governments of<br />
both countries adhere to close positions in<br />
evaluating the significance of the relaxation of<br />
international tension, in understanding the<br />
need that detente should spread to all areas of<br />
the world.<br />
Both the Soviet Union and, obviously, Australia<br />
are interested in peace and stability ensured in<br />
Asia, too, particularly in those regions of the<br />
continent where the situation continues to be<br />
tense and fraught with war danger.<br />
This concerns primarily the situation in the Middle<br />
East. A just and lasting settlement in that region can be achieved only on the basis of the<br />
Security Council and UN General Assembly<br />
Resolutions, on the basis of the withdrawal of<br />
Israeli troops from all the occupied Arab territories,<br />
on the basis of the exercise of the legitimate<br />
rights of the Arab people of Palestine,<br />
including their right to self-determination and<br />
their own statehood, and the safeguarding of<br />
the security and independence of all states in<br />
the region. We believe that the way to a stable<br />
political settlement there passes through the<br />
earliest reconvening of the Geneva Middle-East<br />
Peace Conference.<br />
To ensure peace in Asia means also to bring to a<br />
conclusion the political settlement in Indo-<br />
China, to secure undeviating compliance with<br />
the Paris Agreement on Viet-Nam by all parties<br />
to it, to put an end to the armed provocaticns of<br />
the Saigon regime against the Republic of<br />
South Viet-Nam and to its attempts at undermining<br />
the foundations of a political settlement.<br />
The Soviet Union will continue doing everything<br />
possible for the solution of the problems of<br />
peace and security in Asia, just as, naturally,<br />
elsewhere. At the same time, we respect the<br />
proposals of other states aimed at attaining this<br />
goal. We do justice to the foreign-policy sl: eps of<br />
the Australian Government in support of the<br />
process of easing tensions, and we are prepared<br />
to develop co-operation with Australia in the<br />
matter of ensuring international security on an<br />
acceptable basis.<br />
In recent years, the Soviet Union and Australia<br />
have secured, through joint efforts, a certain<br />
progress in the development of mutual economic<br />
relations. We shall strive to make our trade<br />
with Australia, our economic ties with it, stable<br />
and long-term. For this, Australia's business<br />
circles and Soviet foreign trade organisations<br />
should know better the markets and possibilities<br />
of each other; they should be able correctly<br />
to appraise the prospects for the economic<br />
development of our countries, their role in the<br />
international division of labour not only today,<br />
but also tomorrow. The great importance of this<br />
is borne out, specifically, by the big shifts and<br />
upheavals that have of late taken place in the<br />
West in international trade and in economy as a<br />
whole. Apparently, Australia with its natural resources,<br />
great territory and possibilities in industry and </p>
<p>agriculture will be acquiring a new importance it seems to us, testifies to a mutual aspiration to<br />
in the world as one of the promising and big ensure success of Soviet-Australian talks and<br />
participants in international economic co-give a new impetus to the further development<br />
operation. And we would like to wish success in of Soviet-Australian co-operation.<br />
this to the Australian people for whom the<br />
Soviet people entertain the kindest sentiments.<br />
We have always respected the people of<br />
Australia, doing justice to their capacity for<br />
work, persistence in overcoming difficulties,<br />
and to their mastership of industrial and agricultural<br />
production. Our people remember that<br />
in the years of World War II we were bound by<br />
ties of allied relations and that Australian soldiers<br />
contributed to the rout of the fascist<br />
enemy. The 30th anniversary of this victory will<br />
be celebrated by the peoples and Governments<br />
of the Soviet Union and Australia, in<br />
strengthening peace as the objective basis on<br />
which our countries can build and extend their<br />
co-operation for the benefit of both peoples and<br />
in the interests of peace and progress.<br />
I would like to express satisfaction with the fact<br />
that our talks with the Prime Minister and other<br />
Australian statesmen began in an atmosphere<br />
of mutual understanding and frankness which,<br />
A march -past in honour of the Prime Minister at the War Cemetery in Leningrad. </p>
<p>Speech by the Prime Minister of Australia at a dinner given in his<br />
honour by the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR In<br />
Moscow on 14 January 197<br />
It is a great pleasure to be in Moscow as the first<br />
Australian Prime Minister to visit the Soviet<br />
Union. Australians admire the immense<br />
achievements of the Soviet people in building<br />
and rebuilding their great nation. As wartime<br />
allies we admired the strength, the stamina, the<br />
solidarity, the sheer courage of your people in<br />
defending their motherland from fascist aggression.<br />
In the past two days my party and I<br />
have been vividly and poignantly reminded of<br />
the heroism of your countrymen in the defence<br />
of Leningrad, in the defence of Moscow, in the<br />
defence of Volgagrad. No country has suffered<br />
more in war, no country has fought in war with<br />
greater valour, no country has survived the<br />
devastation of war with greater strength and<br />
resolution. I believe these experiences and<br />
these great qualities have strengthened your<br />
determination to work for a peaceful world.<br />
Here in the Kremlin, here in this splendid hall, I<br />
am nearing the end of a pattern of visits to the<br />
major powers which I commenced shortly after I<br />
became Prime Minister and which reflects the<br />
independent and diversified foreign policy<br />
which my government has proclaimed. Since<br />
we came to office my Foreign Minister and I<br />
have between us visited every continent. We<br />
have visited the capitals of the five permanent<br />
members of the United Nations Security Council.<br />
This global context of our diplomacy is<br />
important, first because we consider it necessary<br />
to demonstrate to other governments and<br />
leaders the important new directions of<br />
Australia's policies. Secondly, the global context<br />
is significant because I believe it is the<br />
proper perspective in which to view our relations<br />
with your Government. Your huge, diverse,<br />
multi-national state occupies one-fifth of<br />
the world's land surface, stretching from the<br />
Baltic Sea to the North Pacific. The Soviet Union<br />
is one of the world's two strongest powers. Our<br />
policies acknowledge this fact. We recognise<br />
that your interests, like your responsibilities, are<br />
global. Australia believes that as a vigorous and forward<br />
looking middle power, it is essential for us<br />
to make what contribution we can tc the<br />
strengthening of detente between the Soviet<br />
Union and the United States. We must do more<br />
than that. We must do our best to make dEtente<br />
both irreversible and universal. As I said at the<br />
United Nations General Assembly last September,<br />
the Australian Government wAholeheartedly<br />
endorses the progress towNards<br />
detente which we have witnessed so far. We<br />
recognise that detente is a continuing and a cooperative<br />
endleavour. We would like to see it<br />
widened to include relations between all the<br />
major powers. Nevertheless, it is appropriate to<br />
record in both capitals Australia's warm appreciation<br />
of the progress made and cour encouragement<br />
for further achievements.<br />
I said this in Washington last October. I said it<br />
today in Moscow, because in the final analysis<br />
the peace of the world depends on Moscow and<br />
Washington. Like other medium and smaller powers,<br />
Australia welcomes detente, not oni' t for the<br />
relative stability and freedom from fear which it<br />
promises, but because it has helped create the<br />
conditions in which middle powers like ourselves<br />
can pursue more independent policies.<br />
The old rigidities of the cold war have passed,<br />
not least because so many ideological barriers<br />
have been dismantled. My Government has<br />
now established diplomatic relations With every<br />
state geographically placed between the Soviet<br />
Union and Australia. This is a mark of the new<br />
realism in our policy. Just as we have diversified<br />
our relations with the United Sates, so in<br />
different ways we are diversifying our relations<br />
with you.<br />
Your country's military and indlus-irial might,<br />
like that of the United States, places you in a<br />
pre-eminent position to influence the future of<br />
our planet. I have acknowledged the global </p>
<p>extent of your interests. Such power, such<br />
interests, bring with them great responsibilities.<br />
Australia looks to the superpowers to maintain<br />
the utmost mutual restraint in their relations<br />
with each other and towards other nations. On<br />
such restraint peace and progress ultimately<br />
depend. We look to you for responsible leadership<br />
and action to meet the urgent global problems<br />
of human need and suffering. Thus we<br />
hope, for example, that the Soviet Union and<br />
the United States will co-operate in an adequate<br />
international system of grain reserves to<br />
alleviate the uncertainties and shortages of<br />
supplies in world food resources.<br />
The other great area of responsibility which<br />
attaches to the great powers is the nuclear arms<br />
race and the increasing risk of the proliferation<br />
of nuclear weapons. I expressed Australia's<br />
deep concern on these vital issues, and outlined<br />
some positive steps which the international<br />
community could take to meet these challenges,<br />
in my address to the last session of the<br />
United Nations General Assembly. Statements<br />
by many other leaders reflected the same grave<br />
apprehensions and concern. My Government<br />
has declared its commitment to practical and<br />
effective international disarmament measures.<br />
We have ratified the Non-Proliferation Treaty<br />
and subsequently concluded the Mandatory<br />
Safeguards Agreement with the International<br />
Atomic Energy Agency. Yet we observe some<br />
flagging of international concern over the<br />
consequences of nuclear proliferation. We are<br />
disappointed by the lack of universal support in<br />
our own and other regions for the Non-<br />
Proliferation Treaty, which we consider the<br />
essential foundation for a safer world. Perhaps<br />
we have lived in the shadow of mutual destruction<br />
for so long that we have become accustomed<br />
to it. Can we dare to be complacent about<br />
our very survival?<br />
Since raising our concern for these issues at the<br />
United Nations I have visited each of the three<br />
depository powers of the Non-Proliferation<br />
Treaty. In Washington three months ago, in<br />
London in December, and now here in Moscow.<br />
I have made the same point. We look to the depository<br />
states to maintain international interest<br />
in the Non-Proliferation Treaty and to promote<br />
and enlarge its membership. In this year of the<br />
NPT Review Conference we see a special opportunity to revitalise the commitments undertaken<br />
in this treaty, to strengthen the basis of<br />
peace and awaken us from the nightmare of a<br />
world in which nuclear weapons are widespread.<br />
I was glad to note that in the historic<br />
Vladivostok communique of 24 November,<br />
Comrade Brezhnev and President Ford stressed<br />
the importance of increasing the effectiveness<br />
of the Treaty. We therefore look confidently to<br />
the Soviet Union for constructive leadership on<br />
this issue, not only by virtue of your special position<br />
in relation to the Treaty, but because of<br />
your important role as Co-Chairman of the Conference<br />
of the Committee on Disarmament.<br />
Mr President, I have spoken frankly on matters<br />
of great consequence to us all. Nothing less<br />
would have been appropriate to the dignity of<br />
this unique occasion. Nothing less would adequately<br />
have reflected the true nature of our<br />
relations. These relations are now-though unhappily<br />
they have not always been-characterised<br />
by greater frankness, by greater realism,<br />
by greater seriousness, by greater understanding.<br />
My visit will serve to strengthen this understanding<br />
and bring our peoples much closer<br />
together. For example, I shall be signing agreements<br />
between the Soviet Union and Australia<br />
on science and technology and on cultural<br />
exchanges. We have much to learn from you in<br />
the scientific and technical fields, you I hope<br />
may have something to learn from us. We<br />
warmly welcome the prospect of a Cultural<br />
Agreement between us. Australians deeply<br />
respect and admire the culture of the Soviet<br />
people-the glorious fruits of which I have seen<br />
and heard at first hand during my present visit<br />
to the Soviet Union.<br />
In these and other ways we shall develop the<br />
range of contacts between us. A world in which<br />
states, regardless of their different social systems,<br />
can communicate their views and<br />
interests clearly and confidently is a world more<br />
amenable to peaceful change and peaceable<br />
policies. I regard the relations between our<br />
countries as a constructive element in the creation<br />
of such a world. I regard my visit to your<br />
country, and the warm hospitality you have extended<br />
to me and my party, as an important<br />
contribution to the strengthening of friendship<br />
between the Soviet and Australian peoples. </p>
<p>Joint Communique issued at the conclusion of the visit by the Prime<br />
Minister of Australia to the USSR on 16 January 1975<br />
At the invitation of the Soviet Government the<br />
Prime Minister of Australia, the Hon. E. G.<br />
Whitlam, paid an official visit to the USSR from<br />
12to 16 January 1975.<br />
During his stay in the Soviet Union Mr Whitlam<br />
and his party visited Moscow and Leningrad.<br />
They had an opportunity to see how the Soviet<br />
people live and work, as well as to acquaint<br />
themselves with their achievements in the fields<br />
of economics, science, education and culture.<br />
The Prime Minister of Australia laid wreaths at<br />
the Tomb of the Unknown Solider in Moscow<br />
and at the Piskarovskoye Memorial Cemetery in<br />
Leningrad. The Prime Minister and his party were everywhere<br />

atmosphere and in a spirit of mutual understanding,<br />
the parties had a constructive<br />
exchange of opinions on major international<br />
issues of mutual interest as well as on matters<br />
concerning Soviet-Australian relations and the<br />
prospects of their development.<br />
Both sides noted that the positions of the Soviet<br />
Union and Australia coincided or were close on<br />
a number of important international problems.<br />
They noted the significant developmenls which<br />
had taken place in recent years towards<br />
strengthening international peace and cooperation<br />
and consolidating the spirit ol detente<br />
in international relations.<br />
Both sides agreed to make every effort ' o ensure<br />
that relaxation of tension spread to all regions of<br />
the world and that the steady progress towards<br />
detente became irreversible.<br />
Both parties noted the importance of the agreements<br />
and arrangements concluded between<br />
the USSR and the USA, directed at the further<br />
improvement of the international climate and,<br />
above all, the importance of the agreements on<br />
the prevention of a nuclear war and the limitation<br />
of strategic arms.<br />
The Soviet Union and Australia note with satisfaction<br />
the considerable advances towards<br />
strengthening security and developing peaceful<br />
co-operation in Europe and expres: s their hope<br />
that the Conference on Security and Cooperation<br />
in Europe will be successfully<br />
concluded in the near future.<br />

importance to strengthening peace and stability<br />
in Asia and expressed their determination to<br />
contribute in every possible way to relaxing<br />
tensions further, to ensuring security and to<br />
creating conditions for making Asia a continent </p>
