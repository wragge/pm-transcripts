TELEVISION INTERVIEW GIVEN BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />

Recorded on 13 November for replayonWded~ 8Nv~ r17<br />
Chairman Reg Leonard<br />
Panel John Wakefield<br />
Alan Underwood.<br />
Good evening to you. In a few days we will be voting in the Senate Election.<br />
In this the last of four interviews with Commonwealth Party Leaders, it is my privilege<br />
to introduce the Right Honourable the Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton. Good evening<br />
to you, Sir. Now, the Prime Minister obviously has a very wide field to cover, and I<br />
suggest we might start off with defence with the first questio'nfrom John Wakefield.<br />
Q. Mr. Gorton, you contend strongly that our presence in Vietnam is essential.<br />
Why then isn't the Eighth Battalion being replaced, and can you explain, please,<br />
your chanige of policy or, replacements?<br />
PM Yes, I contend that our presence in Vietnam is escential and thatai<br />
American presence in Vietnam is essential until such time as the South<br />
Vietnamese will be strong enough to be able to look after themselves. Before<br />
the last general election, I stated that should the situation reach the position<br />
where significant withdrawals of American troops could take place, the'n I would<br />
expect to see that some Australian troops were phased into that withdrawal.<br />
Well, there were significant American withdrawals, and because what wie<br />
promise we perform, Australian troops were phased into that withdrawal.<br />
Q. DoeS this mean, Mr. Gorton, that we are now approaching some ai the<br />
goals vie sought when we first went into Vietnam?<br />
PM I think we are much closer to the goals. The goals we sought were a<br />
situation where South Vietnam could defend itself and its people could decide<br />
what kind of a government they wanted to elect. I thinkc that we, as a result<br />
of building up the Vietnamese Forces, as a result of building up Vietnamese<br />
morale, I believe, on all the information t hat I have that we are closer to<br />
these goals.<br />
Q. Senator Gair said on this programme about ten days ago that we should<br />
bomb Hanoi you may have read that. Now do you agree with Senator Gair<br />
on that or, alternatively, do you think it makes sense for us to allow the<br />
enemy ships to come in there, into the ports down along North Vietnam, twelve<br />
of them a day sometimes, to bring in all these war goods? </p>
<p>PM Well, we wouldn't be bombing Hanoi, of course. It would be the United<br />
States who bombed Hanoi if anybody bombed Hanoi, and I have no doubt at all<br />
that the United States is -not considering carrying out any bombing raids on<br />
Hanoi. Now you asked me a second part of that question, and I think in the<br />
narrow military sense, it probably doesn't make sense not to flatten your<br />
enemy altogether, but in a broader sense, looking at the possibilities of what<br />
might occur if that escalation took place, then I think that it does make<br />
perhaps overall sense.<br />
Q. Sir, the North Vietnamese or the Vietcong have had no hesitation wihatever<br />
about pummelling Saigon.<br />
PM No.<br />
Q. You don't believe ' in reprisals?<br />
PM Well, I wouldn't want to go-that far. I do believe in doing what one can in<br />
those circumstances, provided and this is after all, a judgment for the<br />
United. States to make who will eventually have to bear the great burden, of<br />
this that kind of retaliation doesn't lead to an escalation which leads to a<br />
really great conflagration.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, a couple of seconds ago you mentioned that one pos. sible<br />
course in the war in Vietnam was to flatten the e-nemy. Well, if you don'tdo<br />
that, can you see any early end to the war, and how will it come about will<br />
it be by military means or by negotiation?<br />
PM Well, I am not able to put an answer to your question about an early end,<br />
or any particular time scl<br />
Q. Well President Nixon says 1972. He doesn't say why.<br />
Pm. Well I am not saying why, either nor commenting on President Nixon.<br />
I am just saying I am not prepared<br />
Q. You are not even saying 1972 now?..<br />
PM I am just saying I can not put a time scale on with any confidence. But you<br />
asked me how it would end. Ncw the basic fact that will bring it to an end will be<br />
military victory. You will find Mr. Whitlam and Mr. Barnard and their<br />
supporters wandering around this country saying there can't be a military<br />
victory fcor either side. But you don't find the NLF or the people from North<br />
Vietnam saying that because they know a military victory will eventually<br />
decide this matter. I don't mean that it alone will decide it, but out of the<br />
military success will grow either negotiations, which I think is possibly less<br />
likely, or just a dribbling away of the war and a cessation of it in the way<br />
we sawin the Malayan Emergency. </p>
<p>Q. just so all Australians will be clear, Mr. Gorton, you think suff icient<br />
pressure is now being exerted by the Allies to win a military victory in<br />
Vietnam?<br />
PM I think the military situation is improving and that as pressure is kept on<br />
in the way it is, there is a real opportunity that the South Vietnamese willi be<br />
able to continue to build up their forces so that they can deny military<br />
success to the enemy.<br />
Q. Do you subscribe to the contention of some of Mr. Vlhitlam's critics as<br />
you know he has advised young National Servicemen who oppose the war in<br />
Vietnam not to serve there. They claim this is treaso: L. Would you go that far(<br />
PM I can--' t give you a legal opinion on whether it is legally treasonable or not.<br />
I am not a lawyer so I can't answer that. But I think it is thoroughly<br />
reprehensible and extremely irrespo, sible advice for a man who aspires to<br />
be Prime Minister to give. You can't confine this to saying to people " Don't<br />
serve in Vietnam if you don't like it. You have got to say " Don't serve<br />
anywhere where you feel that you don't like it. And what is more, that would,<br />
of course, make it almost impossible to run our military forces. What's<br />
mnore it is absolutely rotten advice because it puts a chap in a situation where<br />
he can disobey an order, get a dishonourable discharge, get punished, and the<br />
reasonable advice is to say " Join the CM1F if you don't want to go somewhere."<br />
Q. During this campaign, Mr. Gorton, Mr. Whitlam has referred many<br />
times, and particularly on this programme, to the role which he would lik.-e<br />
Indonesia to play in Australia's defence. Now, quite frankly, I can't<br />
understand it. Can you?<br />
PM Nor really, because I am not sure whether he wants it as a bulwark of an<br />
umbrella. As I read what he said, he said Indonesia would be a bulwark against<br />
Communist China. the best bulwark there was. I supo. pose against Communist<br />
China attacking down this way. Then he said Indonesia would be a bulwark for<br />
Communist China presumably to protect Communist China against attack<br />
from Hong Kong or somewhere: And in the intervals, it was going to be an<br />
umbrella for us. So I an-i not quite clear just what role he has cast the Indonesians<br />
for. But may I add this. It is a strange role because just last year, I think it<br />
was, the Victorian Labor Party came out with an article violently attackNing<br />
the Indoriesians and the present Indonesian Governmeuit, and saying anythipg<br />
Australians can do to get rid of this violent and reactionrary government<br />
ought to be done. Now that is a strange way to win friends and influence<br />
umbrellas.<br />
Q. What do you think, Primr Minister, might be the reaction of Indonesi-ans<br />
that they shculd be the bulwark in other words the ham in the sandwich?<br />
Pm Well if they notice at all what Mr. Whitlam says, I think they would treat<br />
it with the regard due to what he says. </p>
<p>Q. Mr. Gorton are you worried about reports that the Russians, if they do not<br />
control the situation in the Indian Ocean, are very well on the way to controlling<br />
it.<br />
PM I don't think any Australian, or anyone else in this part of the world can<br />
regard with equanimity the increase In Russian strength in the Indonesian<br />
Ocean, and I think that our attention must be more directed towards that area.<br />
That is why Learmonth has been built, that is why the naval base is being built<br />
in the West.<br />
Q. Well, it has been very freely stated and I don't think it has been denied<br />
that our arrnagements with the Americans regarding W~ oomera and Pine Creek'<br />
at Alice Springs, is that we give them ground facility -for the receptio , n of<br />
photographs which are taken by satellites which show possibly military installations<br />
in Aisa, ir-luding China and Russia, 1"' hich are relayed back to America. Now<br />
for that privilege, what do we get in return from the Americans?<br />
PM Well, can I first make it clear that I am not agreeing with your statement<br />
of what function these bases carry out. I have no right to say what they carry<br />
uut, other than to say that they are entirely defensive and have no off ensive<br />
capacity at all. They are joint bases. They are built according to Article 2<br />
of the AN'ZUS Treaty which provides for this kind of mutual help. Did you say<br />
did we have a cast-iron guarantee that the Americans would.<br />
Q. For that privilege, what do we get in return?<br />
PM Well this is done really under the terms of the AN'ZUS Treaty, and I thinl.<br />
Australia gets a great deal as a result of the ANZUS Treaty. Let us put it<br />
another way. If we didn't have the ANZUS Treaty, or if we had it and didn't<br />
adhere to it and ignored it, then I think we would be in. a much worse situation<br />
than we are having the ANZUS Treaty and adhering to it.<br />
Q. Have you, or have we Australians any firm assurance that the Americans<br />
will stand by us if we are in trouble?<br />
PM We have got the provisions of the ANZUS Treaty which I suppose, legally,<br />
since it provides in the case of attack for the two Governments to consult, could<br />
be held out to be not a legally binding contract. But insofar as treaties between<br />
two countries can go, this treaty goes. And, again, if we didn't have it, we<br />
would really be in an infinitely worse situation; and damaging it, as I believe<br />
the Labor Party would, is to damage Australia.<br />
Q. Sir, I will invite you now to transfer your thoughts to some of the local<br />
problems domestic problems.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, you have condemned the 35-hour week proposal. What thein<br />
must happen in our economy before it could become feasible? 0 </p>
<p>PM I think we should be producing sufficient to ensure that from that production<br />
we are able to provide the materials for the schools and the hospitals and the<br />
water supplies and the other public facilities that are required, and providing<br />
enough so that the real wages could rise. We don't want to reach a situation<br />
where we are producing the same amount as we are now with fewer people or<br />
with a shorter week. Surely Australia wants more and more production to be<br />
channelled into all these fields.<br />
Q. Do you think that production at this present level is inadequate?<br />
PM Well, it is inadequate to meet our needs as quickly as we would like to<br />
meet them.<br />
Q. Mr. V htilam when he was on this programme, seemed unusually embarrassed<br />
when we started to talk about Mr. Hawke's 35-hour week. Now, Sir, do you<br />
personally believe that the political wing of the ALP would support a<br />
week?<br />
PM Well, not let us leave my personal beliefs out of it. I would like to read<br />
you an extract from a letter Dr. Cairns wrote in 1968<br />
" At a special conference of the Party, Mr. Whitlam did two things.<br />
He apologised to the Federal Executive for his public attack on it and<br />
said ' I now undertake to work within the framework of the Party and<br />
to accept the decision of its properly-constituted authorities.<br />
So he has accepted that binding. And the last Conference of the Labor Party, held<br />
in August last year, said<br />
" Conference considers that an effective political campaign be<br />
undertaken in conjunction with the ACTU to achieve our objective<br />
of a 35-hour week.<br />
So leave my personal opinion out of it. He has promised to do what this says<br />
he has got to do.<br />
Q. Mr. Hawke challenged you to a debate on the 35-hour week. Why don't<br />
you accept it?<br />
PM I don't think he challenged me to a debate. I think he dobbed Mr. Whitlam<br />
in, really, although Mr. Whitlam later said he knew about it. He say, " Yes,<br />
yes, yes" when he answered that question on the grounds that " what I tell you<br />
three times is true". But I think Mr. Hawke actually said he would like<br />
Mr. Vlhitlam and himself to debate with myself and xr. Snedden. I am not<br />
going to provide a forum for either Mr. Hawke or Mr. Whitlam. But<br />
Mr. Snedden said he would be glad to debate it with Mr. Whitlam. We haven't<br />
heard from Mr. Whitlam since because the last debate he has was on his call<br />
for mutiny with Mr. Malcolm Fraser and he got done like a dinner' / 6 </p>
<p>Q. Isn't it a singularly futile exercise to get up and spout<br />
PM I'm quite sure it is interruping each other. There is a certain amount of<br />
debate about the 35-hour week going on right now out in the hustings.<br />
Q. Mr. Gorton, in this programme last week, Mr. Whitlam emphasised again<br />
that he could abolish the means test within six years, or in six years, arnd the<br />
cost would be peanuts. Those were his words. What do you feel about that?<br />
PM Well, I think it a typical Whitlam statement. If you regard $ 300 million<br />
as peanuts, then I suppose fair enough, it's peanuts. But it would, ever. on<br />
his ownr figures, cost $ 300 million to abolish the means test, and that only if<br />
the pension didn't move up in the meantime. Now you could do an awful lot<br />
with that money for people wvho have got nothing but the pension.<br />
Q. We all appreciate, Prime Minister, that questions o. n, pensions are generally<br />
associated with the House of Representatives election. But there has been so<br />
much talk about it. Can, you elaborate at all?<br />
PM I don't think even in a House of Representatives election, in my experience,<br />
people have really gone around saying " I propose to raise the pension by this<br />
much or that much or anything else. I haven't heard it there. All I can say<br />
on this field is that I believe, and I think the figures show it, that in all1 fields<br />
of social welfare, including the base pension, we hav2-done more than any other<br />
government has done in a comparable time. And I am determined to go onl<br />
doing it.<br />
Q. Wh-at the pensioner wants to hear tonight, in view of sharply-rising costs, is<br />
some hint that he is going to get relief.<br />
PM. Yes, but I have said all along that I think it quite wrong to give indications<br />
of any kind inthe course of an election campaign. It wouldn't be right.<br />
Q. A Se;:.. iate election campaign, you mean?<br />
PM Well, really<br />
Q. They could be given in a House of Representatives campaign<br />
PM Well, possibly. But after all, the Budget came in just a little while ago.<br />
Q. just talking about inflation, Mr. Gorton. We have asked Senator Gair and<br />
Mr. Whitlamn and Mr. M/ cEwen just exactly what they propose to do about<br />
inflation. Not one of them seemed to have the answer to it. Now, have you?<br />
/ 7 </p>
<p>PM I have got a partial answer to it and a suggestion. The partial answer is that<br />
we should continue Budgets as we are budgeting, which provide for a very large<br />
domestic surplus in order to be a weapon against inflation, and that we should, as<br />
we have done, lower the expenditure on new expenditure for the Commonawealthi.<br />
We have given the Stater, more this year but our expenditures on new things has<br />
only risen by $ 70 million, I think, in the Budget as agaiinst $ 130 million last<br />
year. But over and above that, I have got a suggestion, and that is that if the<br />
Arbitration Court would bring down its decisions having regard to the rise in<br />
productivity, that would be one of the greatest blows that could be struck against<br />
inflation.<br />
Q. Nowi, let's get that one. That is a statement of momentous importance. Ann<br />
I right, Sir, in saying, that you think the Arbitration Court should mould its<br />
decisions in the light of the level of productivity at the time it makes its awards?<br />
PM I believe it should take into accoL'-it when it is making decisions or awards<br />
of one kind or another the level of productivity, the increase in productivity, arid<br />
the effect on the economy of the country.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, do you feel this isn't being done now by the Commission?<br />
PM Well, I don't think I should answer that question in set terms. But I was<br />
asked a question of what cculd be done about inflation and I suggested.<br />
Q. On inflation again, just before we get off it, Prime Minister. What is<br />
your Government doing to set an example to the private sector?<br />
PM Well, as I said, we have budgeted for quite a large domestic surplus this<br />
year. That, I suppose, is not setting an example, so much as using a weapon.<br />
But we have reduced t he new expenditure in this year's Budget as compared<br />
to last year's Budget. But you can't reduce it too much because so much of<br />
the B udget is taken up with things that people really must have. For example,<br />
the second highest item in the Budget is social welfare, and so on help for<br />
schools, for the States....<br />
Q. In your Budget, you increased things like sales tax and petrol tax a-. Id company<br />
tax and interest rates and PMG charges. Now how can you argue, Mr. Gorton,<br />
that these things are not already adding to our inflatio. n' 1<br />
PM I don't think we did increase interest charges in the Budget. We introduced<br />
them as. a weapon against inflation incidentally, as a classic weapon against<br />
inflation.<br />
Q. just to slow things down </p>
<p>PM Before the Budget came in. Yes, to slow demand down. To slow down the<br />
amount of money borrowed and therefore the demand that money would generate.<br />
Well, we did that before the Budget, although the long-term bond rate was raised<br />
in June and that might be what you are thinking of. I don't think that company<br />
tax an increase in company tax would have any effect on inflation, or rising<br />
prices at all. I just don't think anybody would say it did.<br />
Q. What about as an effect on company returns?<br />
PM It has an effect on company returns, I admit, but I don't think on the<br />
general level of prices. Sales tax, yes, on those items on which it is imposed,<br />
but we didn't impose it on the whole level of sales tax. Only on things which<br />
are mostly sort of luxuries well, there were furs and jewels. But there was<br />
perhaps one item of necessity, that was cosmetics. I must admit that. But<br />
by and large it wasn't on staple items really itemshat are required. Sales<br />
tax, petrol tax would have some effect not a great deal because most of the<br />
petrol is used by private motorists. But it undoubtedly must have some effect.<br />
Q. Don't you consider liquor and cigarettes essentials"<br />
PM Well, I like them.....<br />
Q. For most people. Not for you, but for every Australian, or the majority<br />
of Australians?<br />
PM Not-as essentials. No. I don; t. But of course the major Australia u drink<br />
is beer what is consumed most and nothing was done to raise the excise obeer<br />
or on spirits. V-1ine was the only excise that wa s imposed, . and that ils<br />
scarcely an essential.<br />
Q. You know, years ago, when Harold Holt increased the sales tax o_ cosmetics,<br />
there was such a row he had to withdraw it. You may remember that. There<br />
hasn't been any such scream this time when you do it.<br />
tM Perhaps Australian women are getting much better looking without<br />
artificiai aids.'<br />
Q. Do you think they are necessities for women? Cosmetics?<br />
Chairman We are getting on to awfully dangerous ground. Let us get on to<br />
Commonwealth/ State relations.<br />
Q. Mr. Gorton, can you see any alternative to the present Commonwealth/<br />
State relations and this annual bartering, and now it is becoming even<br />
more frequent don't you think it is almost denigrating the Premiers the<br />
way they have to go cap in hand / 9 </p>
<p>PM I don't think it is denigrating the Premiers. But I think we all have to<br />
understand that the overall responsibility for managing the economy is the<br />
Commonwealth's and I think the Premiers themselves would unquestionably<br />
agree to that. It has been suggested that an alternative might be to lay aside<br />
a certain field of income tax or income tax for the States. I would not support<br />
that. I don't believe Australians would be at all happy to have two income<br />
taxes which one Government could raise and another Government could drop<br />
and varying between the sections of Australia. I really think that would be<br />
retrogressive. Indeed, the abolition of uniform income tax would not be good<br />
for States like Queensland.<br />
Q. What is the Government doing for the farmer? Why are we in this parlous<br />
price throughout all our primary industries.....<br />
I think we are in the parlous price for two reasons one because of the<br />
cost increases which you mentioned that the farmer has to bear, and the other<br />
because world markets seem to be closing down on their requirement for our<br />
produce or the money they are prepared to pay for it. Dairy produce the<br />
European Economic Community has got running out of its ears. There has<br />
jeen a green revolution going on in the growing of cereals, and so on. Beef<br />
and sugar are not bad so far. Tobacco is all right, but wool is an industry<br />
that has been really badly hit and this because of the drop in prices. What<br />
are we doing? Well we have had a long programme of subsidising superphosphate,<br />
of taxation concessions, of zone allowances, of things of that kind, quite a lot<br />
of things of that kind, and we are now tackling the wool one as best we can by<br />
setting up the Wool Commission which, as you know, is designed to see that<br />
people will pay....<br />
Q. It started only two days ago, it is too early to say how it went.<br />
PM It is indeed, but sirce it was announced, and maybe fortuitously, the price<br />
of wool did begin to rise. Now it won't solve the problem, we have got to do<br />
more than that.. And one of the things we have done..,. promised to is<br />
to set up this Rural Finance Insurance Corporation to insure long-term loans<br />
for farmers who are good credit risks, the way there ic a Housing Insurance<br />
Corporation.<br />
Q. Canada has recognised Red China now. Do you think that will cost<br />
Australia any big wheat orders?<br />
PM I doubt it. Red China seems to be singularly unconcerned about whether<br />
countries recognise it or not. It buys where it thinks it is cheapest. </p>
<p>Q. Can you see any sense in our continuing not to recognise Red China?<br />
PM Well, one thing that immediately comes to mind is Red China's insistence<br />
that Taiwan should be recognised as a part of Red China. I don't believe it would<br />
be right or proper or moral to take 12 million people.....<br />
Q. That didn't worry Canada, did it Mr Gorton?<br />
PM Well, I am not responsible for what Canada does...<br />
Q. No, but if they can do it, we can do it.<br />
Chairman The United States did last week did modify its attitude about<br />
Communist China's admission to the United Nations. I think it would accept<br />
now both Chinas. Does that influence your thinking at all?<br />
PM We haven't altered our own gove. nmental attitude on this.<br />
Q. Why can't we recognise both Chinas?<br />
PM I have always understood one of the reasons is that Communist China has<br />
strong objections to both Chinas being recognised.<br />
Chairman -Gentlemen, can we get on to something as we have only a few<br />
minutes some of the Party problems that face leaders in the country?<br />
Q. We presume, Mr. Gorton, that one of the great worries that you have got<br />
in the Senate election is that you might finish up with a hostile Senate. Wv~ hat<br />
do you think the chances are for that?<br />
PM I think it is unlikely, but until the numbers go up, it is always possible.<br />
It is a possibility. I think it is unlikely, but it is a danger and I do thinlk people<br />
should know it and should realise the difficulty this would cause.<br />
Q. Do you think you car, get a clear majority without having to be propped<br />
up by the DLP?<br />
PM We would have to be very lucky.<br />
Q. Since the last time you mentioned it has Mr Whitlam told any more<br />
what did you say " a string of falsehoods" or something?<br />
PM A string of falsehoods exactly that is what I said.<br />
Q. Factual falsehoods. ./ 11 </p>
<p>PM tvThat is what he quoted, but actually in my initial opening speech, I said<br />
" a string of falsehoods". Well, there was a statement that we had had a five<br />
per cent rise in inflation last year, which wasn't true. There was a statement<br />
that the Treasurer had admitted that which wasn't true. There was a whole lot<br />
of them. I can't remember them. But since thep, he has added a few. Yes, he<br />
has made a statement that nothing has been done to help South Australian<br />
Railways, and there was no money in the Budget for it. In fact the money is in<br />
the Budget for it, as I have pointed out, and it was stanted in the Budget speech.<br />
That is one falsehood. There are a couple of other things which verge on it.<br />
He indicated the other day there wasn't such a thing as a Five-Power Pact. Now,<br />
I suppose legally it has'L-It been signed, but there is agreement between Five<br />
Powers, and this I thinkr tends to be close to falsehood.<br />
Q. I was wondering whether we could ask you two rather personal questions.<br />
Do you feel that at last you have a united team behind you and that all the ruptures<br />
of your earlier months of office are behind you.<br />
PM I think that is becomning evident.<br />
Q. Would you say that you personally have changed since you became P1rime<br />
Minister? And could you tell us in what way you have changed if you havei<br />
PM I dorn't know whether I have changed or not. Other people have to look at that<br />
and say whether I have changed or not. I really can't an_-swer that.<br />
Q. After Mr. McEweri has gone back to his farm, or taken this roving ambasSador<br />
trade Job or whatever it is, what do you think is going to happen to the Country<br />
Party? Do you think it will retain its present strength or it will be more docile?<br />
PM I think it will be under good leadership whoever they choose to lead it. And<br />
I think it will continue to be a good partner in the Coalition Government. I doin't<br />
expect it to be either docile or aggressive. I expect . it to be a co-partn~ er.<br />
Q. just another word, personally from you, on Mr. McEwen. Have you any<br />
plans for him as a sort of senior Trade negotiator?<br />
PM No, I haven'tt. But the way this whole question arose is that somebody asked<br />
him at a press conference if he were asked to do something, would he do itI and<br />
he said, yes, he would. Now, when I say I haven't got any plans, it doesn't meanl<br />
that I am saying he wouldn't be useful. It is just that we had never discussed it<br />
all.<br />
Q. Why do you want the Commonwealth to collect offshore mineral resources<br />
royalties instead of the States? ./ 12 </p>
<p>12.<br />
PM I do it. I made it perfectly clear that the legislation we brought in and I<br />
nean clear to all State Premiers, and publicly clear that should this legislation<br />
pass, then any minerals discovered, the States would get 60 per cent of the<br />
royalties of, just as they do, or perhaps a bit more than they do from the offshore<br />
petroleum legislation. So the short answer is I don't.<br />
Q. When do you expect this legislation to be through? Undoubtedly it is going<br />
to be challenged, I suppose.<br />
PM I wouldn't like to put a timetable on it, but sooner or later this question<br />
has got to be resolved one way or the other. The question of where the real<br />
legal responsibility lies. But royalties.... the States have, and indeed the<br />
running... the way their Mines Departments work...<br />
Q. All the hard work, yes.<br />
PM For 60 per cent of the return.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, you are a Victorian. Can you explain to us nobody on<br />
the Labor side can why Mr. Whitlam can't settle the issue of the Victorian<br />
ALP State Executive?<br />
PM Well, I suppose because first of all he has been insulting the people In<br />
the Victorian ALP Executive perhaps with reason. Then he has bee: n, saying<br />
the most intemperate things about them for quite a lo-: g time, including that he<br />
is going to stop them runn: ing on unity tickets, which he has never done. So<br />
there is a lot of bad blood there. And I think that the people on the Victorian<br />
State Executive are probably stronger than Mr. Whitlarn.<br />
Q. Do you think that the last week's criticism by Mr. Griffith of Shortland<br />
will have any lasting effect in New South Wales?<br />
PM I don't know whether it will have a lasting effect or not, but it is a most<br />
interesting window into the Caucus room because you will have noticed<br />
Mr. VMhtlam, quite belatedly in the campaign has sudde: ly become a great<br />
champion of an immediate pension rise, and now this little glimpse of what<br />
happened inside Caucus that Mr. Griffith has given us is very interesting. You<br />
remember he said " When I ( Griffith) urged higher pensions he ( Whitlam accused<br />
me of featherbedding the pensioners." Well, thereit is.<br />
Q. Well I am sorry we cannot pursue that a little further. It would have<br />
been a most interesting subject I think, but our time has run out. We are<br />
grateful indeed, to you Prime Minister, for having spared the time.<br />
Thank you very much and goodnight. </p>
