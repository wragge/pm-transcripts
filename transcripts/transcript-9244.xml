PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
DOORSTOP, SALVATION ARMY CENTRE, MELBOURNE,<br />
FRIDAY, 27 MAY 1994<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
PM: Let me just say a couple of things about the Salvation Army and what<br />
you've just seen here. These are the sorts of things which Australia<br />
needs to do to encourage those who have missed out in society and<br />
missed out in the work force, who are untrained or who are homeless<br />
and how the White Paper which the Government introduced two weeks<br />
ago can help to see people case managed, trained, placed in a job<br />
and where, as a society, we pick them up and we don't just forget them<br />
as the rest of us move on into the recovery of the 1990s. So, the<br />
Salvation Army as a voluntary organisation will be a case management<br />
agency and one of the challenges to the Government now is to build<br />
the administrative system to deliver all the White Paper policies. And<br />
it will be with organisations like the Salvation Army that this will<br />
happen and the sort of co-operative, interested work which you are<br />
seeing here where there is not the rigidities of the work place that a lot<br />
of the benefits of self esteem and experience, these are the things<br />
which, I think, the long term unemployed, the homeless because the<br />
thing you've got to remember about a lot of people who are homeless,<br />
particularly kids, you've got to be awfully street smart to survive.<br />
They're mostly very intelligent and it is a matter of focussing their<br />
intelligence into things which they can do and this is what this is about.<br />
So, I'm looking forward to seeing a change in the next couple of years<br />
in the way in which we introduce the White Paper, apply the White<br />
Paper to the problems of the unemployed in this country. And, what<br />
I've seen today, here, is a tremendous example of the innovation which<br />
the Salvation Army has been able to bring to helping homeless kids,<br />
people who have been institutional ised get experience, get their self<br />
esteem up, make products that actually sell and run as a business, Of<br />
course, it has grown here by about 300 per cent, the turnover here, in<br />
the last year or two. </p>
<p>J: Prime Minister, on issues like this where you are relying on voluntary<br />
agencies like the Salvation Army to do so much, they are finding their<br />
funding base increasingly difficult the Red Shield Appeal was down<br />
for instance what happens when these agencies can't meet the need<br />
that is confronting them?<br />
PM: We will be paying case managers on a fee basis. We have set up an<br />
organisation to actually operate the case management business as a<br />
market. This organisation called ESRA which will see the<br />
development of a case management agency in competition with the<br />
CES. So, we will actually be paying a fee, we won't be simply saying<br />
to organisations like the Salvation Army, you cover the industry cost of<br />
it. In other words, it will be in the interest of voluntary agencies to<br />
actually take up the White Paper proposal.<br />
J: Mr Keating, are you impressed so far by the performance of the-<br />
Opposition's new frontbench?<br />
PM: I must say I thought if Mr Downer is starting to say that he is going to<br />
show some strength, he could start by dismissing Senator Bishop from<br />
the position of Shadow Health Minister. I mean, for somebody trying<br />
now to run an argument which was won in this country 20 years ago,<br />
that there are very clear links between smoking and health, smoking<br />
and cancer, I should have thought there are some things where people<br />
get things wrong, and in the tolerance of public life you can say well,<br />
that's one they got wrong, but ok, then move on. But, you don't get a<br />
thing like this wrong. This is just plain negligence, incredible<br />
negligence and a terrible arrogance speaking to buttress the interests<br />
of cigarette companies against the common good of the community. I<br />
think, Mr Downer ought to say, look I'm sorry about this Bronwyn, this<br />
is going to hurt me as much as it is going to hurt you, but out you go.<br />
J: Mr Downer said though, he is not going to do anything you tell him and<br />
that actually you are engaging in 1930 style class war rhetoric in your<br />
attacks on him.<br />
PM: I know, and don't the media run some of that simple simon stuff. Look,<br />
I made two points which he says are class war tactics. They are not at<br />
all. One is, I repeated what Dr Hewson said that Mr Downer's<br />
leadership was decided by an exclusive group of the Victorian Liberal<br />
party that is simply just a point of fact. The second point I made is I<br />
don't believe that any leader of a major party today, in 1994, ought to<br />
belong to clubs that exclude women. I mean, what sort of society<br />
would we be if the policy behind that kind of intolerance were to be<br />
applied generally in the community. I noticed Mr Downer has run<br />
around saying I've never been to a club and everything like this, look,<br />
the fact is the club I belong to and I've gone into thousands of times in<br />
my life, a club that must be burnt into the Liberal party's memory where<br />
I accepted victory on election night the Bankstown Sports Club in<br />
Sydney 25,000 members, men and women who participate freely and </p>
<p>enjoy each others company. But, the notion there is some sort of basis<br />
of superiority and a basis of privilege, wherein a club or its<br />
membership say to women you can't be involved here is something<br />
that the Downer's didn't tolerate.<br />
J: ( inaudible)..<br />
PM: Just understand this, don't let Mr Downer pass this off as some class<br />
matter. This has got nothing to do with class, it is simply to do with<br />
social comment. It is a matter of a social point to be made and the<br />
social point is that women should not be excluded from institutions in<br />
our country, least of all, of course, clubs.<br />
J: in parliament?<br />
PM: I've been in public life for 25 years and I've faced them all.<br />
J: Do you think the new Opposition front bench is looking a bit tougher<br />
than the front bench you've had to face in the past?<br />
PM: Well, are we talking about toughness or crassness? Because if<br />
barracking for cigarette companies against the interests of young<br />
Australians, who are basically who they are trying to hook into the<br />
habit of smoking, if that's tough, well, that's not the sort of toughness<br />
Australian politics needs. I would have thought, also, the appointment<br />
of Mr McLachlan as the environment spokesman, just laughs at every<br />
person that has a serious interest in the environment. So, there are a<br />
lot of, I think, poorly placed people here. But I noticed Dr Hewson said<br />
that he was making it very clear that he thought there was a lot of<br />
preference here, they were very pointed comments by Dr Hewson.<br />
Yesterday he said well, a lot of people who supported Mr Downer have<br />
been rewarded here and then he went on to say some other things, but<br />
he made the point that he didn't think it was appropriate. It is not going<br />
to be an entirely happy little gathering.<br />
J: ( inaudible) and right across Mr Downer's agenda ( inaudible<br />
PM: Yes, you see that's what Dr Hewson did say. He's expecting to speak<br />
across the agenda and he's there basically to you see Mr Downer is<br />
trying to say we're going to run a broad inclusive kind of policy which,<br />
by the way, doesn't include women in particular places, but an<br />
inclusive policy while all the drys in the economic area sit in the key<br />
economic jobs and they're saying Fightback, which they committed<br />
themselves to absolutely including Mr Downer, who is now trying to<br />
reform himself as a dry.. you see, you've got this terrible dichotomy..<br />
Malcolm Fraser has made his leadership by recruiting Mr Staley and<br />
all of them in Melbourne getting him up. Malcolm has never been<br />
happier than the last week. This is Malcolm's best week since 1983.<br />
He is as happy as a sand boy, he's got Mr Downer up, he can't stop<br />
smiling, he's writing columns, he's on radio stations, he's doing press </p>
<p>comment, he's in seventh heaven. Now, the Fraser government was<br />
the blancmange government of the post-war years. The government<br />
that did nothing. So, Mr Downer is going to be the leader of a<br />
government like Mr Fraser, but he's got all the hard edged economic<br />
guys in the economic jobs who believe in Fightback. So, Fightback<br />
has been on the scrap metal heap, but will soon be seeing all the tin<br />
men of Fightback crawling out of the heap, coming back. Because<br />
that's basically all the Liberals believe in. They believe in the hard<br />
edged economic things of Fightback as their leader is now trying to put<br />
another complexion on the hard edged philosophy of Fightback. Now,<br />
remember this, the hard things about Fightback were not simply the<br />
consumption tax, but the $ 10,000 million cuts to government spending<br />
that would affect the whole social welfare system and organisations of<br />
the kind we've seen today. All that is still there. Mr Downer told us<br />
that a week ago in the Budget reply, that he is going to basically base<br />
his changes on cuts to government spending. He calls it efficiencies in<br />
government. Read: efficiencies for cutting into the social wage.<br />
So, just understand the contradictions here. You've got Mr Downer<br />
seeking to emulate Mr Fraser in, if you like, the broad rhetoric, but the<br />
non-reformist policies of the Fraser years coupled with all the hard<br />
edged people put into the economic jobs who are all inherent to<br />
Fightback. Now, you know what that means for the rest of you I can<br />
tell you fun and games. Fun and games as this dichotomy emerges<br />
over time. They have to be one thing or the other.<br />
J: ( inaudible) Downer a formidable opponent, what do you think<br />
about that?<br />
PM: Well, why should I take any notice of that. Paul ( Kelly) also thought<br />
they were going to win the last election.<br />
ends </p>
