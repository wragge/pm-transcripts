FOR PRESS P. M. No. 35/ 1966<br />
POSTAL DISPUTE<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr. Harold Holt<br />
A Committee of Cabinet has discussed further today<br />
the situation arising from the Australia-wide stoppage last<br />
Friday in the Mail Exchange Branches of the Post Office organised<br />
by the Australian Postal Workers' Union, and the further<br />
industrial action since taken in the capital city exchanges at<br />
the instigation of the A. P. W. U. The Union has taken its action<br />
to try to secure its demands regarding the manning of the<br />
mechanical letter sorting equi ment being installed by the Post<br />
Office, capable of performing the task of letter sorting very<br />
much more speedily and efficiently than the existing manual<br />
methods. These actions by the Union are in gross and flagrant<br />
breach of the undertaking given by its representatives as a<br />
vital condition of the terms of settlement on 8th April, 1964<br />
of the Sydney Mail Office dispute of that time. The President<br />
of the Mr. Monk the Federal President of the A. P. W. U.,<br />
Mr. F. Waters and the Federal Secretary of the A. P. VW. U., Mr.<br />
G. Slater, all personally signed that agreement. The undertaking<br />
given was in the following terms<br />
" For their part, the A. C. T. U. and the A. P. W. U.<br />
will not support any stoppage of work on any<br />
industrial issue in future but will negotiate<br />
and failing agreement, will go to Arbitration.<br />
In the event of the men stopping work the<br />
A. C. T. U. and the A. P. W. U. agree that the<br />
prescribed penalty provisions of the Act will<br />
e appropriately applied."<br />
Mr. Monk has referred to the action of the A. P. W. U.<br />
as a repudiation of this agreement. As a signatory to the<br />
agreement, he has refused to associate himself with the breaches<br />
of an undertaking so clearly given.<br />
The Commonwealth Government takes a most serious view,<br />
both of the Union's action in disrupting an essential public<br />
service and in violating its undertaking.<br />
Inconvenience and hardship and economic loss are being<br />
caused to the public by the bank-up of millions of letters.<br />
There are serious delays in the handling of all mails, whether<br />
commercial or private, including delays both ways in overseas<br />
mails, and interruptions affecting letters to and from servicemen<br />
at home and overseas. These all result from the course of action<br />
which the Union is pursuing in breach of its pledged word.<br />
Mr. Calwell has stated quite falsely that there has<br />
been a continued refusal by the Postmaster-General, Mr. Hulme,<br />
to have adequate consultations. There has been no refusal, or<br />
failure, or reluctance on the part of Mr. Hulme to confer with<br />
the A. C. T. U. and representatives of the A. P. W. U. on matters in<br />
dispute. He has already talked with Mr. Monk and the officers<br />
of the A. P. W. U. As recently as 29th March, I wrote a personal / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
letter to Mr. Monk telling him that in the spirit of the 1964<br />
agreement, Mr. Hulme would again confer with Mr. Monk and with<br />
the General President Mr. ' aters, and the General Secretary<br />
Mr. Slater, of the A. P. v. U. " to discuss the extent to which the<br />
present staff should be employed on the letter sorting machines<br />
and related matters." The Union rejected this offer. Without<br />
regard to the public convenience or to its own written undertaking,<br />
it chose direct action instead.<br />
Following persistent attempts to secure areement by<br />
negotiation, the Pub hc Service Board and the Post Office have,<br />
in a further attempt to remedy the situation invoked the<br />
Arbitration process contemplated under the 1964 agreement.<br />
Application has been made to the Public Service Arbitrator,<br />
Mr. E. A. Chambers. Mr. Chambers has written to the A. P. W. U.,<br />
the Federated Public Service Assistants' Association the<br />
Director-General of Posts and Telegraphs, and the Public Serviee<br />
Board, referring to the great public importance of maintaining<br />
the normal flow of the mails, and also to the specific agreement<br />
by the Amalgamated Postal Workers' Union and the A. C. T. U. to<br />
have recourse to arbitration. He is convening a conference<br />
for 5 p. m. on Wednesday, 6th April, to resolve outstanding<br />
issues raised by the applications.<br />
The Government looks to all participating in the<br />
conference with Mr. Chambers to produce a basis for an immediate<br />
resumption of normal operations. There is a duty to all<br />
sections of the community to achieve this. Quite patently, no<br />
responsible government can tolerate continuing interference<br />
with the effective performance of the postal service.<br />
CANBERRA, April, 1966. </p>
