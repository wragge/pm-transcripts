VISIT BY THE PRIME MINISTER OF INDIA<br />
MRS INDIRA GANDHI<br />
LUNCHEON AT PARLIAMENT HOUSE,<br />
CANBERRA 22 MAY 1968<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon. J. G. Gorton<br />
Prime Minister, Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen:<br />
It is my very pleasant task to propose the toast of our<br />
distinguished guest. I think it is impossible for me edequately to express<br />
on behalf of myself or of those Australian people who are here, or Prime<br />
Minister, who are in their thousands watching you now and waiting to hear<br />
you speak the intense admiration which we have of you as a person, and<br />
the great pride and excitement that we feel in this nation because on this<br />
occasion we have been visited for the first time by the Prime Minister of the<br />
great Republic of India. I think that when August comes this year, it will be just:<br />
twenty-one years since the flag of India flew from the old Red Fort at Dell~ i,<br />
as a symbol of the political independence which had been gained as a result<br />
of a struggle of some quarter of a century, a struggle, Prime Minister, in<br />
which you and your distinguished family, together with countless other of<br />
your countrymen were engaged in, a struggle which occupied all the thoughts<br />
of your early life. I have heard, and you have confirmed to me that the story is<br />
not apocryphal, that at the age of three or five or some very early age of that<br />
kind, you began to make political speeches standing on a table at the home of<br />
your distinguished father, with a captive audience, and I have not only envied<br />
you this early start, but I have also had borne in upon me the fact that fromn<br />
that time until the time the flag of free India flew from the old Red Fort<br />
Delhi, you were entirely engaged upon this struggle. In it you lived and<br />
breathed and had your being, and in his heady excitement of striving against<br />
sone thing, which appeared stronger at the time, for an ideal which you believed,<br />
and those with you believed to be more important than the hardships which<br />
struggling against it entailed, because you believed that, eventually you<br />
achieved that political freedom which for so long you had sought.<br />
It was a struggle, I like to think, Prime Minister you<br />
may not agree with me not against a harsh, oppressive, overbearing,<br />
corrupt power, but against an alien power and one which was in your coun try,<br />
and one which you respected but wished to leave your country so that politically<br />
you could run your own lives.<br />
I can only, as from a distance, feel in myself the excitement<br />
there must have been, the heady wine there must have been during those<br />
years, and congratulate you on having with your countrymen finally achieved<br />
that for which you had so long fought. But this was just the beginning, this<br />
attainment of political freedom.<br />
That freedom having been attained, then those who had b~ een<br />
successful were at once faced with the immensely significant requirements of<br />
economic freedom, ( for political freedom of itself is not enough) and faced with </p>
<p>-2<br />
immense problems problems which to a country like ours almost stagger<br />
the imagination of seeking to take and raise the standards of what is now<br />
530 million people in a nation which each year adds to its population, the<br />
same number as is the total population of our nation of Australia. Having<br />
to build up almost from nothing an industrial base and industrial muscles,<br />
having to face in such a vast country the terrific incursions of drs~ ughts in<br />
particular areas1 having to provide for those whcq having followed your<br />
banners toward political freedom now required some material advancement<br />
as a result of having achieved that, having at the same time to provide for<br />
the defence of that political freedom and those boundaries of India against<br />
incursions which were first feared and then in fact occurred, having all<br />
these problems to cope with, you had to show that a democratic country<br />
because through all these times you remained a democractic country could<br />
cope with these kinds cf problems and could provide for the citizens of<br />
their nation an improving standard of material things.<br />
So from that first struggle, that first excitement of seeking<br />
political freedom, these problems came upon your country and in time you<br />
became the leader who must decide how best they could be met. During<br />
that time, you have managed, Prime Minister in your country to increase<br />
the average expectancy of life from 32 years to, I think, 49, you have<br />
mai~ eI to build up an industrial capacity much greater than that with which<br />
you started, you have managred to resist and to repel incursions upon your<br />
frontiers. It looks as if you will, in this present plan, overcome the<br />
agricultural disadvantages which have dogged you for so long and will manage<br />
to be able to provide from within the borders of India the food which India<br />
requires. These are no mean achievements, Prime Minister, and<br />
these if they are maintained, as 1 am sure they will be, will stand as an<br />
example to other nations in Asia that great problems can be met by<br />
democratic processes, that great problems can be overcome by democratic<br />
processes, that there is more than one way to improve and increase the<br />
economic well-being of a nation, and that it is not necessary to surrender<br />
political liberty in order to do this, If this indeed turns out to be the fact,<br />
Prime Minister, then I can think of very little that would be of more<br />
significance for the future of the world and the peoples who will live in<br />
the various countries of the world.<br />
I" is not for me to speak long, Prime Minis ter, in this,<br />
but may I take your mind back to a time when you were left alone because<br />
your family were all in gaol, and when you had written to you by your<br />
distinguished father a poem which I know must lose much in translation<br />
but which yet I would like to express to you who have not forgotten it and<br />
to others who have not yet heard it:<br />
Wlhere the mind is without fear<br />
And the head is held high.<br />
Where knowledge is free<br />
Where the world has not been broken up into<br />
fragments<br />
By narrow domestic walls<br />
WVhere words come out from the depths of truth<br />
Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards<br />
perfection<br />
VWhe re the clear stream of reason<br />
Has not lost its way into the dreary desert sands of<br />
dead habit<br />
Where the mind is led forward by thee<br />
Into ever-widening thought and action<br />
Into that heaven of freedom, my Mther,<br />
Let my country awalke. / 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
Prime Minister, the man who wrote that poem did much to<br />
see that it was translated into fact. Prime Minister, you are doing much<br />
to see it is translated into fact. it is something which your country and<br />
mine can both ta., e as something of a guidance for the future, and i wish,<br />
Prime Minister and hope, Prime Minister, that for many years to come you<br />
will be aole to continue to try to see that the se. itiments expressed in your<br />
father's verse are expressed in actual fact in the country that you lead and<br />
that you lead it with the same high courage, political perspicacity, elegance,<br />
modesty and grace with which you have led it so far. </p>
