    <content><![CDATA[<p>More than 400 jobs will be created under the North West and Northern Tasmania Innovation and Investment Fund, with the announcement of the 36 successful projects by the Prime Minister, Premier of Tasmania and Federal Innovation Minister.</p>
<p>The joint $17 million initiative of the Australia and Tasmanian Governments was launched in response to factory closures in the region and to provide families and communities with sustainable jobs and economic stability.</p>
<p>The announcement was made at Penguin Composites, which will receive over $1.3 million to expand workshop capacity at two sites and to fund new plant and equipment, generating 46 new jobs. The company makes fibreglass, composite and metal products for industry applications.</p>
<p>In total, the 36 projects will result in an additional $34 million investment in the region and will create high-wage, high-skill jobs in a diverse range of industries, including agriculture, meat processing, manufacturing, transport, construction, biotechnology and printing.</p>
<p>The strong response from local businesses, which had to match government funding, is a measure of the confidence in this region.</p>
<p>Funding ranged from $50,000 to over $2 million. Among the successful projects are:</p>
<p>     * Forth Farm Produce, of Forth, which received over $2 million to construct and fit-out a purpose-built broccoli and bean grading and packing facility. It is expected to generate 54 new jobs.</p>
<p>     * VEC Civil Engineering, of Ulverstone, awarded over $1million to develop new precast beds for the construction industry and purchasing of equipment. The project will create 30 new jobs.</p>
<p>     * Greenham Tasmania, of Smithton, awarded over $1.1million to expand its meat processing facilities to increase capacity and facilitate the development of a new range of value-added beef products. The project will create 25 new jobs.</p>
<p>By working together, governments and the business community can build a better future for North West and Northern Tasmania.</p>
