<p>Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payments (AGDRP) have now been extended to people severely affected by flooding in Bundaberg.</p>
<p>The flooding has had a devastating impact on the Bundaberg community, with many families now waiting in evacuation centres for the flood waters to recede.</p>
<p>With the community now looking towards recovery, individuals who have been impacted by the severe weather and associated flooding can claim payments of $1,000 for each eligible adult and $400 for each eligible child from the Australian Government.</p>
<p>While this assistance is now available, some areas of Bundaberg remain under threat and people should stay safe until the immediate threat has passed. That means, if it is not safe to leave your home or evacuation centre to make the claim, please wait until it is safe to do so.</p>
<p>People can lodge a claim by calling the Australian Government Emergency Information Line on 180 22 66 from 8am to 8pm local time, seven days a week, or online at humanservices.gov.au/disaster.</p>
<p>Today's announcement means that Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payments are now available in the severely affected communities of Bundaberg, Gladstone, Gympie and Fraser Coast following this flooding event.</p>
<p>This assistance is over and above the support already being provided by the Commonwealth and Queensland Governments under the jointly funded Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements (NDRRA).Affected residents may also be eligible for personal hardship and distress assistance administered by the Queensland Government under the NDRRA, which are designed to act as emergency payments.</p>
<p>Further information about Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements for individuals is available from <a href="http://www.qld.gov.au/community/disasters-emergencies/recovery-after-disaster/">http://www.qld.gov.au/community/disasters-emergencies/recovery-after-dis...</a></p>
