JJ4UTRAAX~ CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
FOR JI hL MONDAY OCTOBBR 27 1980<br />
AUSTR'FALIAN ASSOCIATION FOR TH. E<br />
WE7MN NITI ELBOURNE<br />
I am grzateful for the invitation to Tamie and me to be with<br />
you toni-ght. In particular, it is a great pleasure to celebrate<br />
withtYgzhe e31ab2. iahmP,. nt ol new scientific chair, at the<br />
Weizmann -Institute in jqtael.<br />
I amn honoured that you have decided to name this chair after<br />
me.-The hol~ u t I c tb~ nYo w ledge that the Weizmnann<br />
Institute will always be synonymtous with excellence in<br />
scientific researchi. Such research is a most exacting discipline<br />
requir4-gpai4+-e~ k-qgand o4teRndisheartening experimentation.<br />
It demands patience, rationality, open-mindedness, intellectual<br />
honesty, and above all, humility.<br />
The -truly great scientists have had, in addition to these<br />
qualities, a breadth of vision and an appreciation of the<br />
human condition which have enabled the~ m to recognise the<br />
a practical ~~ a~ t1nttcrsearch.<br />
Dr Chaimn Weizmann demonstrated an active and profound awareness<br />
of t-bizs-ATid -it is-only-iittinq--that his influence has inspired<br />
the academic ideals and the structure of the Institube which<br />
bears his name. However, Dr Weizmann was more than a great<br />
scientist.. He was also a great stater: man who, from his early<br />
years in Russia, dedicated himself to the goal of establishing<br />
a homeland for his people. lie was in the forefront of the<br />
Zionist movement through a momentous fifty years of Jewish<br />
hitr. i dtee h-ord-ins: Ognsto for<br />
well over a quarter of a century. L<br />
He wAnspres nt~ aL~ tiaeBaasle Conference in 1897 when<br />
Theodore Herzl, the father of modern Zionism, introduced to<br />
the world at large, the concept and ideas of the movement.<br />
But if Theodore Herzl was truly the father of Zionism, then<br />
surely Dr Wzmann was the father of its produbt, the State<br />
of Israel. lie was President of the Zionist movement at crucial<br />
times between the Basle Conference and the proclamation of<br />
Israel 1-Tn---ir9e4cao gn-it on--o-f -his enormous contribution<br />
he was appoiinted the first President of Israel.-</p>
<p>Dr Weizmanp was not an idealogue. Nor was he an agrgressively<br />
single-minded radical. His great qualities were those he put to<br />
such good use as a scientist patience,_ perseverence and cruiet<br />
reason. HiB contribution as a statesman is epitonusaed -by tEhat<br />
landmrnak in the history of Jewish nationalismn, the Balfour<br />
Declaration of 1917. This statemnent of intent by the British<br />
Gover~ nment was the product of years-i--aet d~ plvaacy on 1<br />
Weizmann s part. It was not only a. tribute to his powers of<br />
reason but also a measure of the high regard in which he was<br />
held by the British Government of the day,.<br />
There ' were many other occasions where Dr Weizmannts diplomatic<br />
qualities achieved milestones on the road to Jewish statehood;-<br />
and these include the commitment o7f President Truman to the<br />
idea of a Jewish -state in Palestine after World War 11.<br />
These qualities were displayed by P~ r Weizmann thiroughout his<br />
life. It is not surprising thereforu-thatalWu~ 1sa<br />
dedicated J'ewish nationalist, lie remained sensitive to the<br />
position of the Arabs in Palestine. Ile was a visionary who saw<br />
no contradiction in the propositio.-ñ h t~-: sras-l--couI4--ave<br />
territorial integrity,/ And peace w. ith the Arabs. Today, for the<br />
first time since the creation of the state, Israel is in direct<br />
-negotiation with an Arab country. The potential benefits of<br />
a just and lasting peace in the Middle atnoolyoth<br />
region, but-to all mankind, are enormous. Fa-ilure to continue<br />
along the pathi that has now been takien would be fraught with<br />
danger-and would pose great tlhreat-to-ñ n'tern-at una' 1-p2' S-ce aTr--'<br />
security.<br />
Of course, Israel has an awesome responsility-n t h i xc n<br />
It is a challenge wnd a responsibility that Dr Weiznann would<br />
have relished. in the formidable task that lies ahead, the people<br />
of Israel may be assured of the firm commitment of my government<br />
to Israel's fundamental and non -negotiabl5 e ri ght to live within<br />
secure and recognised boundaries. Rut we also believe that no<br />
comprehensive peace will be possible without a recognition<br />
that the Palestinians have a leg it i mate-r'* ghtti-ru-htorpand<br />
of their own alongside lerael's.<br />
It must be the hope of all of us th a t,-inth e<br />
y ears ahead, people with the integrity and the vision of<br />
Dr Wleizmann can sit downi on both sides of the negotiating<br />
table and hammer out the details of* such a peace. Of course,___<br />
its achievement will be a complex matter, frRaugh w, r ahVe<br />
and serious dangers. If it was ever thought to be simply an<br />
e quation involving Israel and the Arab states, then surely the<br />
events of the last few. years have de-ati4e y'e sueh-a-FAn~ ti-ei-l-___<br />
We face increasing instability in the region, highlightiflg the<br />
dif ficulties faced by the West in maintaining its SuPplieas of__ iiL..<br />
The inte6rests of the Soviet Union are all too.-. plain. In short,<br />
there are many strands Influencing affairs in the Middle East,<br />
and the difficulties in securing a just peace between Israel<br />
and her Arab neighbours is only one of"' tn5-festrnids.<br />
In all this we should have three paramount objectives, which are<br />
not going to be easy to achieve togeth4-.--a<br />
peace betwieen Israel and the Arab states, the maintenance of oil<br />
supplies to the West, and the exclusion of the Soviet Union ' from<br />
v-itcrea. 6ed influence over an area of such vast Importance. </p>
<p>3-<br />
The achievement of these objective8 will require a degree of<br />
statesmanship from all interested parties which we cannot<br />
automatically assume will be forthcoming. For inevitably there<br />
-Wt~ TT-bf temnptations to engage in political bargaining, political<br />
trade-offs, and political expediency. There might. appear enticing.<br />
but they offer no lasting solutions to the real problems.<br />
Stat hi-pfnw-th ~-prvai 1----statemans hip of the kind which was<br />
amply demonstrated by Dr Weiamann during his distinguished career.<br />
However, -to~ nighith-emphasi,, jnt our memory of Dr Weizmann<br />
is on his scien~ tific achievement and his leadership of scientific<br />
teams. In 1933, he founded a centre for scientific research in what<br />
was then British-mandatedPalestine. The Institute was an<br />
tfsIP 1dt i ( 5 0 O. enti e4 xcellence and rapidly achieved<br />
international recognition. Greatly expanded, it later became<br />
known as the Weizmann Institute and aimed its work inktially<br />
~ a~ t-jec-to-pe~ it t--territory's economy. Initially.. such<br />
research work concentrated on agricultural problems.<br />
When war came, the research laboratories were turned over to the<br />
development and productioinL-a-pharmaceuticals for the allied.<br />
fYorces in the Middle East,<br />
Thi clseco-operation between research and its practical<br />
ilvpvn~ tatT~ t -har en 1aYnhtiined and is one of the major<br />
reasons why the Institute is world renowned. In fact,<br />
throughout his scientific career, Dr Weizxiann chose to wor; k in<br />
th o~ a-za. a s _ o-seiG-h i ch--" ti 1d ' provide practical benefits<br />
-t the problems~ faced withiin his country.<br />
In this way, he set himself adomble discipline of quality and<br />
of releva~ nce. He understood early that the probl-ems of development<br />
in Israel would have to be tackled by Israel itself; that<br />
research conducted somewhere else would be unlikely to lead<br />
tcr-Hte--knds-f--ttons--th-aiwoxild be relevant to Isael's<br />
envi ronmnent.<br />
Much Of Lh-is approach4has a-f-affd-liar ring to us because our<br />
early pioneers, in their attempta to develop this country,<br />
soon found that the harsh Australian environment was unsuited<br />
to many of the methods that were operating successfully In other<br />
parts ol tie world. Over the years, we have had to build up<br />
skills and scientific expertise in a number of fields of<br />
particular relevance to Australia. Under great pressures and<br />
con4 er--ed witbh ve-ry-sL9gnifñ--mit difficulties, Israel has done<br />
the same. Atnd, faced with economic and military adversity,<br />
the Iqie?. mann Institute has become a centre of scientific excellence.<br />
It is perhaps significant that the institute has had a deep<br />
involvement in the area of imnmuniology. For this is also the field<br />
of two ofAustralia's most distinguished scientists,<br />
Sir RaTFalrane B~ urnett, the -Patron of your Association, and<br />
Sir Gusta~ v Nossal, your President.<br />
I kno~ w-y-u--wi-4--&amp; gree-trith rne-whren I say that both these<br />
men embody all the qualities of the truly great scientists.<br />
Like Dr W4eizmann, their influence has been felt in other<br />
areas outside theirfield ofspecaaisation, and in the community<br />
atire of course, science is not the monopoly of any particular<br />
country or ideology. That is why scientific co-operation is increasingly<br />

being seen as an important element of developing relations<br />
between particular countries. In a world of increasing complexity,<br />
t aakes-. little sense for countries to duplicate each other's<br />
research work when, through co-operation, the burden and benefit<br />
of scientific research can be spread.<br />
B-o-nd the scientific benefit of such co-operation which involves<br />
not only the exchange of reseaoh papers and results, but also<br />
visi. ts by scientists and discussion of common problems, there is<br />
S he--ienef it of-a growing understanding of each other's country.<br />
I am proud of the strong relations which have developed between<br />
Australia and Israel since the establishment of that state<br />
thirty-one years ago. Our two countries have much in common, not only as<br />
relatively new states, but also in the emphasis which our peoples<br />
place on individual freedom and true Parliamentary democracy.<br />
These elemants are basic to society in both countries.<br />
It thenefore gives me great pleasure to celebrate a development<br />
such--e-a-the establishment of a scientific chair at the<br />
Weizmann Institute which I am confident will contribute<br />
significantly to-relations between Australia and Israel.<br />
And I thank you again for the honour you confer on mes and<br />
Australia in allowing the new chair to bear my name. </p>
