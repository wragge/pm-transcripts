PRIME MINISTER<br />
RESIGNATION OF SENATOR SHORT: APPOINTMENT OF<br />
SENATOR ROD KEMP<br />
The Assistant Treasurer, Senator Jim Short, has tendered his resignation from<br />
the Ministry. I have accepted that resignation.<br />
Correspondence between us, which explains the new circumstances which have<br />
promoted the resignation is attached. Senator Short first advised me of these<br />
new circumstances during a telephone conversation yesterday.<br />
His resignation is a source of deep regret for me. Senator Short has been a hard<br />
working and effective minister. At all times he has behaved with complete<br />
honesty and integrity. Not even his harshest critics in recent days have said<br />
that he lacked either of these qualities. I have decided to appoint<br />
Senator Rod Kemp to the position of Assistant Treasurer. He will retain the<br />
position of Manager of Government Business in the Senate. He will be assisted<br />
in that role by Senator Ian Campbell.<br />
The new Parliamentary Secretary to replace Senator Kemp now that he has<br />
bBeeanl ratppointed to the Ministry will be Mr Michael Ronaldson, the member for<br />
His Excellency the Governor-General has indicated to me that the swearing in<br />
of the new Minister and Parliamentary Secretary can take place tomorrow.<br />

Senator the Hon. Jim Short<br />
Assistant Treasurer<br />

My dear Minister<br />
I have your letter of yesterday advising of a specific approval which you<br />
had given, as Assistant Treasurer, to an application by the ANZ Banking<br />
Group for the grant of a banking licence to ANZ Grindlays Bank<br />
Limited. Given that you had not recalled this specific act dealing with the ANZ<br />
when we held our discussions last Wednesday, I agree with you that the<br />
circumstances of the matter have now changed.<br />
With considerable sadness, therefore, I feel I must accept your<br />
resignation. At no stage have you acted dishonestly or improperly. The ANZ<br />
approval itself was a routine matter. You followed the advice of both the<br />
Reserve Bank and The Treasury.<br />
I thank you for your dedicated work as Assistant Treasurer over the past<br />
seven months. In that role and, in particular, as a member of the<br />
Expenditure Review Committee, you played a crucial part in putting<br />
together the first Budget of the new Government which has won such<br />
wide respect in the community. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
You may be assured that your qualities of integrity and commitment are<br />
widely admired amongst your colleagues.<br />
With warm personal regards to both you and Jan,<br />
Yours sincerely<br />
Howard)<br />

Prime Minister<br />
O Parliament House<br />
CANBERRA ACT 2600<br />
Dear Prim Minister<br />
I refer to the events of recet days coucering my longstandinag shzeoding in the ANZ Bank. As<br />
I haVe already advised you, I sold my shareholdiug onth emarket oni Thursday, 10 October, and will<br />
be donating to charity the after-tax profit derived from holding t&amp; e sbares between mid March 1996<br />
and 10 October.<br />
In the past day, my staff have beezn checking the hundreds of Ministeral approvals I have made<br />
since becoming Assistant Treasurer.<br />
In the area of the administ in of the banldng laws, I have given several dozen approvals. The<br />
check has revealed tha~ one of thes approvals related to the ANZ Banking, Group. In June 1996,. 1<br />
gave approval to a request by the ANZ Banking Group to the at of a banking licence to XNZ<br />
GlrindlAYs Bank Limited pursuant to the Lanae's movc from the UK to Australia as purt of a<br />
consolidation of the ANZ Blanking Group's activities.<br />
The request wa rouine, and my approval was given on the recommendation of both the Reserve<br />
Bank arnd the Treasury. There were no grounds on which the request might have been decided<br />
duffermitly. My approval was influenced i no way whatsoever by the fact of my sharholding in<br />
the ANZ Bank.<br />
When I spoke with you on Wednesday evening, I had not recalled having given this particular<br />
approval and simlilarly during the Senat sittings on Thursday.<br />
Now that myr attcnion has been, drawn to that approvaL, I feel that the circumlstances of the mater<br />
have changed. In the light of this, and having given the deepest consideration to all the<br />
circumnstances, I have decided to tender to you my resignaiion as Assistant Treasure.<br />
Ih avc sought % bioughoumt y lfeto act aall times with high integrity. My decision to resign afrera<br />
careless and personally distressing oversight reflects this puiniciple-</p>
<p>2<br />
I do so with the deepest sadness. After mor than elevn years in Opposition, most of then as a<br />
samor Shadow Ministwr. I was greatly privileged and honourd to have been chosen by you in<br />
March to become a Minist in the fist Howard Government I believe I have made an important<br />
contribution to the Government in its first months, and I very much reget that I will now be leaving<br />
the Ministry.<br />
In doing so, I assure you and the Government of my continuing total suppo, and I extnd to you<br />
every best wish for many years to come as an outsmandng Prime Ministe of our great naion.<br />
Yours sincerely </p>
