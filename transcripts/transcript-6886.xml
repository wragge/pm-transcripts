TRANSCRIPT OP INTERVIEW WITH HEATHER EZWART. WASHINGTON. 16 APRIL 1986<br />
EWART: Mr Hawro, what do you really have to offer Australia<br />
as a result of these talks?<br />
PM: I have a capacity to say to them two things I think are important.<br />
Firstly, that We have a commitment from the people of the United States<br />
that the framework will be available for continued discussions by ua on<br />
behalf of Australian farmers am to the implementation of elements of the<br />
United States arm program where that implementation could impact adversely<br />
on our interete. And secondly, I have the unqualified comitment of<br />
the Piesident b≈ì the United States that the United States will take a<br />
leading tole in the upcoming multilateral trade negotiations to put trade<br />
in agriculturel products at the forefront of the agenda.<br />
EWART: But that does really go that much beyond what John Dawkins was<br />
assured during him recent visit here?<br />
PM Yes, It b ilds upon the very valuable work that the John Dawkins did.<br />
And aa I said before I left Australia the groundwork had been done and I<br />
have nov buil that into a position where I have been able to talk with<br />
the President and get the commitmant of the President. And that's a<br />
commitment at the highest level.<br />
EWART: But do you think the comnitment that the United States will try<br />
and push for agriculture on the agenda at the next round of multilateral<br />
trade negotia ions was perhaps something he intended doing anyway?<br />
PMH: I think tiere is an enhanced perception by the United States of the<br />
importance of this iesue not merely immediately for themselves and their<br />
relation with the European Community but the importance for us and the<br />
reat of the world. I think we have been able to add to their perception<br />
of the importance of this.<br />
EWART: But in reality, you can't alter the trade war between the<br />
United States and the European Community, can you?<br />
PM: I certainly can't wave a magic wand and say here is an end to the<br />
trade war, t6at's true. But what I can do is to import into thair<br />
consideratioqa a range of rational argument which takes it beyond the<br />
immaediate coisidarations which I believe would serve to confirm the<br />
view that an end has to be brought to this international trade war because<br />
there must be an end to the situation where one. large group says, her.<br />
is the subsidy. The other group sys here i. a bigger * ubsidy. The other </p>

2.<br />
groups says here 1s a bigger one. That ultimately is destructive.<br />
EWARTz But as th trade war is continuing, do you accept that the<br />
T-ng term impact f1or Australian farmers remains fairly gloomy?<br />
I<br />
P1: I'm not the long term outlook is gloomy. I am just saying that<br />
In the immediate sense it is gloomy and it can only be improved And have<br />
some basis upon which you can have optimism. For the longar term future<br />
if action is begun to be taken this year to get the negotiations to have<br />
agriculture on the agenda, what has happened in the past is that you have<br />
had a different sit of rules and virtually no sanctions against people are<br />
involved in the bhidies and exports of agricultural products against the<br />
very strict anct ons which apply to manufactured goods. Now, manufactured<br />
goods have to be qonsidered in the same way as they have been, but<br />
agricultural trade has to be put into the same category. So, under the<br />
rules of GATT the same saactions apply. I think we, by our efforts, are<br />
adding our additional impetus to the understanding that that has got to be<br />
done.<br />
EWART: Turning n~ v to Libya, why at your news conferenc were you refucing<br />
to spell out whatar the American action on Libya was justified?<br />
PM: Well, that is your interpretation. What I have said is I am not going<br />
to get into the bvsiness I put it as a squalid auction of saying where<br />
am I on some support meter. I, and Bill Hayden, from the very beginning<br />
on Tuesday of thif week, have tried to analyse the situation on the basis<br />
of trying to point to where we go in the future and what could happen in the<br />
future. And we h# ve the position where some have chosen to interpret it in<br />
one way and othrs in the opposite. I am not going to get into that<br />
auction. We havei said that force in international relations is not<br />
acceptable, partifularly the use of terrorism, and that the essential<br />
condition for bripging an end to this concept is the repudiation by Libya<br />
of the direction export and control of terrorism against innocent civilians.<br />
And on that basis in the United Nations we have tried to point to possible<br />
ways in the future to the resolution of this matter. Now, that La what we<br />
are going to continue to do. You can try as much as you like to say, use<br />
a word or not a w rd, but, as I say, it's a squalid exercise.<br />
EWART: The Uni t! P States Administration is describing Australia's response<br />
as strongly supportive and that is the way it is going to be reported in the<br />
media here. Does. that concern you at all?<br />
PM: I am not concerned about interpretations that are put on. There has been<br />
an opposite interpretation by Mr Howard. As I have said. different interpretations<br />
by other people. What I am about is tn state the position. We have done it<br />
consistently in Canberra, in New York. and in Waehingtoh.<br />
EWART: Why do you think the Administration would be making that<br />
description, thoqgh?<br />
PH1: You will have to ask the Administration. / 3 </p>
<p>APR. 18 ' 86 18: 22 AUSTRALIAN DIPLOMATIC NETWORK P. 09 3.<br />
RW. RT: Well, do yu think the UnitedStates action has done anything to stop<br />
internati mal terrorism?<br />
PM: Well, I think it should have made clear to those who are involved in<br />
it that as far as : he United States is concerned theft patience is not<br />
unlimited. I mean they've taken a clear stand there. There Is some<br />
evidence of dissension to the point of fighting amongst elaments of the armed<br />
forces in Libya. t may have involved some undermining of Gaddefi's<br />
position, I don't nov. But, again. I'm not really going to $ et into that<br />
speculation. My j b as Prime Minister, and Bill Hayden's job as 7oreign<br />
Minister, in to tr7 and use our best endevours to particularly through<br />
our membership ofhe Security Council to try and find a way in which<br />
there can be some negotiation or its equivalent, In this matter.<br />
EWART: lis there been any response to your call to the United States<br />
to publicise its evidence concerning Libyan terrorist activities?<br />
PM: No, no posit2ve response. I have put the came. I acknowledge end<br />
accept that the Uited States has to make its decision in the light of the<br />
obvious advantage that there would be in the publication of this evidence<br />
against, on the ofher hand, their concern at the exposure of their<br />
intelligence capaities. It would be presumptuous for me to tell them what<br />
they ought to do. That is ultimately their decision. What I can do as<br />
a concerned person is to point to, what I consider would be the advantages<br />
of publication.<br />
EWART: What are those advantages?<br />
PM: Well, clearl' there are those who are saying that this is a fabrication.<br />
It Is not authenttc and it can't be compelling. Now, all I can say Isa<br />
I have seen the eyidence, I have had the briefing. I fi-nd the material<br />
authentic. I fin; it compelling. A </p>
