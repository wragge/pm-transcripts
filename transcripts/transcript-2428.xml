FOR PRESS: PM No. 61/ 1971<br />
ADDITIONAL AID FOR EAST PAKISTAN REFUGEES<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr. William McMahon<br />
The Government today discussed the plight of East Pakistan<br />
refugees in India now aggravated by the serious outbreak of cholera.<br />
It decided to authorise additional assistance of up to<br />
$ 500, 000 for relief to be drawn upon in the light of advice from the<br />
authorities in India as to what is most needed.<br />
This amount is additional to the $ 500, 000 already promised<br />
by the Government, of which $ 240, 000 has already been committed.<br />
Other forms of assistance, including tax deductibility for<br />
gifts were considered, but the Government concluded the most effective<br />
help it could give was further direct assistance.<br />
Further details of the Government's decision will be<br />
announced by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Bury, in a<br />
subsequent statement.<br />
