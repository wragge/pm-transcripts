FOR MEDIA 15 DECEMBER 1986<br />
GOVERNMENT TO PROTECT NATIONAL ESTATE VALUES IN TASMANIAN<br />
FORESTS The Prime minister, the minister for Primary Industry, Mr<br />
John Kerin, and the Minister for Arts, Heritage and<br />
Environment, Mr Barry Cohen, announced today that the<br />
Government will oppose forestry operations in National<br />
Estate areas of Tasmania until it is satisfied that National<br />
Estate values are protected or there are not feasible<br />
alternatives. This followed Cabinet consideration of Tasmanian forestry<br />
operations today.<br />
Cabinet agreed that Mr Kerin should, in accordance with the<br />
1985 memorandum of Understanding, actively pursue<br />
negotiations with the Tasmanian Minister for Forests, Mr<br />
Groom, with a view to reaching agreement on feasible<br />
alternatives to forestry operations continuing otherwise<br />
than in areas currently being logged in the Lemonthyme,<br />
Southern Forests, Douglas River and Jackey's Marsh/ Quamby<br />
Bluff/ Western Tiers National Estate areas.<br />
In the event that agreement is unable to be reached, the<br />
Commonwealth will again pursuant to the Memorandum of<br />
Understanding seek agreement with the Tasmanian Government<br />
to establish a formal review to determine whether there are<br />
such prudent and feasible alternatives: see the attached<br />
draft Terms of Reference.<br />
If the Tasmanian Government should not agree to a review<br />
along the lines proposed, then the Commonwealth will<br />
establish it pursuant to its own enquiry powers.<br />
The objective would be to complete any review before the<br />
next logging season commences towards the end of 1987.<br />
The object of the proposed consultations and, if necessary,<br />
formal review process, is to settle once and for all the<br />
question as to whether feasible alternatives do exist, as<br />
has been claimed by the conservation movement, to logging in<br />
the contentious National Estate areas. </p>
<p>The Ministers said that they were conscious in reaching this<br />
decision of the importance of the forestry industry to the<br />
State of-Tasmania and of its important economic, social and<br />
employment implications. They believed that a full<br />
examination now of the key and contentious National Estate<br />
areas will ensure that future operations can proceed without<br />
contention and confrontation. It will lay a basis for the<br />
continuing strengthening of forestry production in Tasmania<br />
in a way that protects National Estate values.<br />
During the course of the consultations and any subsequent<br />
review the Commonwealth will oppose forestry operations<br />
continuing in the area of the Lemonthyme in which the<br />
Commonwealth's Advisory Committee on Tasmanian Forestry<br />
Operations recommends no forestry operations take place, the<br />
Southern Forests ( except for areas currently being logged)<br />
and the Douglas River region.<br />
If forestry operations should commence in the Lemonthyme or<br />
Southern Forests areas during the course of the proposed<br />
consultations and any review, the Commonwealth will seek<br />
their protection under the ' universal heritage' provisions<br />
of the World Heritage Properties Conservation Act.<br />
The Government is convinced that for the period of the<br />
review at least there are ample feasible alternative sources<br />
of supply available to replace those in the three areas.<br />
Accordingly, not a single job need be lost as a result of<br />
the Government's decisions.<br />
The Ministers said that as far as Jackey's Marsh is<br />
concerned, logging would continue for the remainder of this<br />
season in the present coupe, as surveys of plant species had<br />
been carried out and steps had now been taken to protect<br />
these plant species in the immediate logging area. However,<br />
the Ministers expressed their concern regarding any future<br />
logging in Jackey's Marsh and will include this area in the<br />
proposed consultations and, if necessary, review.<br />
The Government's decision has been conveyed to the Tasmanian<br />
Government, and the Commonwealth looks forward to the<br />
Tasmanian Government's co-operation in seeing that National<br />
Estate values are protected and jobs are maintained. This<br />
is in the interests of all Australians, the Ministers said. </p>
