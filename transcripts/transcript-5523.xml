PRIE MINIST[ ER<br />
FOR MEDIA TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 24 1981<br />
CONDOLENCE MOTION SPEECH<br />
FOR THE. LATE HON. . ERIC ROBINSON<br />
0 On Wednesday 7 January, Honourable Members of this House<br />
were shocked to hear of the sudden and untimely death of<br />
Eric Robinson.<br />
The loss to this nation, to this Parliament, to his friends<br />
and his colleague4 is a heavy one.<br />
I move that this House expresses its deep regret at the death<br />
on 7 January 1931 of the Honourable Eric Laidlaw Robinson, a<br />
Member of this House for the Division of McPherson since 1972,<br />
a Miniszer of the Crown from 1975 to 1980, the President of the<br />
Queensland Division of the Liberal Party from 1968 to 1973;<br />
and places o, record its appreciation of his influential and<br />
wide-ranzing public service, and tenders its deepest sympathy<br />
to his widow and family.<br />
Eric Robinson's time and energies were given up almost entirely<br />
to Parliamentary life, to the Ministry to Party and community<br />
affairs. To an enormous extent, he lived his life for politics.<br />
He did not keep his public career at arm's length from his private<br />
life. One'thingthat many Honourable Members will remember is<br />
the generous way in which he opened his home to his colleagues;<br />
in politics. Whenever a venue was needed, his home was always<br />
available. Eric was alert to the needs of the community. He sought to<br />
provide the kind of representation McPherson electors wanted.<br />
He represented them truly and well.<br />
Eric was a strong Party man. He believed in the Liberal Party<br />
as a force for good in Australia, and devoted his energies to<br />
strengthening it in Queensland. He was President of the Liberal<br />
Party for five years in Queehsland before he entered Parliament. ./ 2 </p>
<p>2-<br />
He believed in Liberalism above all else.<br />
He believe strongly in the free enterprise system, and supported<br />
the containment of government expenditure. He knew that this<br />
was the right path to a better life for Australians.<br />
He saw adherence to these principles a s the foundation of progress<br />
in our community. In his own electorate, he was surrounded<br />
by the tremendous development and progress that can occur<br />
when the energy and initiative of people are mobilised by the<br />
opportunities freedom provides.<br />
Eric Robinson will be remembered particularly f6r his role<br />
as a man who had a practical understanding of business.<br />
He was himself successful in business, after the responsibility<br />
for his family affairs had been thrust upon him at a young age.<br />
He. built up his family's sporting goods business from a single<br />
outlet into a chain that extends up and down the Queensland<br />
coast.-<br />
As a result of this, he knew the needs of the business<br />
community. And he wished to help business to flourish<br />
throughout Australia.<br />
The result of his efforts was that the business community<br />
often looked to him for a lead. He was always prepared to<br />
give that , lead., The business community has been grateful<br />
for that,-, and its benefits have been widely felt in the<br />
community generally.<br />
But Eric Robinson was not just a practical man. His<br />
pragmatic judgments were informed by deeply held convictions<br />
and pi~ izcinles. These principles underlay his day-to-day<br />
responses. He did his best to ensure that his principles<br />
were given practical expression.<br />
We all know that Eric Robinson stood up strongly for his<br />
principles and convictions. He fought for them with determination.<br />
But there were. many occasions when he was prepared to set aside<br />
his own personal feelings for the sake of what he saw as the<br />
greater good.<br />
I did not agree with Eric on all things. This is well known,<br />
and it is not unusual in politics. But it would be right to<br />
say that our disagreements were more about means than about<br />
ena. s , about matters of judgment<br />
rather than matters of principles. And my differences witL-h him<br />
did not diminish my respect for him nor for his contribution<br />
to the Liberal cause.<br />
Eric was a man-whose outward calm hid the strength of his<br />
feelings. often it seemed that he was impervious to criticism,<br />
and that nothing could hurt him. But he felt things far more<br />
deeply than was understood by people who knew him only casually.<br />
I value my knowledge of Eric Robinson, and of the things we<br />
did together. His untimely death is a reminder that public lifeb<br />
can be very severe and demanding. The demands of a person's own<br />
conscience and sense of duty can be enormous. The strains of<br />
office, the strength of feeling, the pressures of time and the<br />
requirement for immediate action, make many demands and Eric<br />
extend ed himself to the full and beyond in meeting them. </p>
<p>-3-<br />
Eric Robinson inspired loyalty and conviction, both among his<br />
own staff and among his public service advisers. He worked long<br />
and hard, but retained the capacity to enjoy life a capacity<br />
which was appreciated by all his associates. We will miss hi-m<br />
in this House, in our deliberations, and in the everyday contact<br />
of political life.<br />
There is a further feature of Eric Robinson's life, which was<br />
the indispensible foundation of everything that he did. It<br />
was at the base of his entire accomplishment. He was totally<br />
and utterly devoted to his family. His love and loyalty to his<br />
wife, Narelle, together with her , constant presence and support,<br />
gave to this man continuing strength and perspective in the<br />
atmosphere of Canberra politics. And in expressing our<br />
gratitude to Narelle Robinson for her contribution to her<br />
husband's public service, we express our deepest sympathy to<br />
her and her family at this time.<br />
