PRIME MAINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA WEDNESDAY, 10 FEBRUARY 1SI82<br />
COMMONWEALTH' ASSISTANCE FOR FLOODS IN THE SOUTHi-WEST REGION<br />
OF WESTERN AUSTRALIA<br />
I have written to the Premier of Western Australia concerning<br />
the extensive flooding which has taken place in the South-West<br />
of the State. The Commonwealth has agreed that a number of<br />
relief measures proposed by the Premier would be eligible<br />
for Commonwealth assistance under the natural disaster relief<br />
arrangements. These measures have been estimated to cost a total of*<br />
million and include:<br />
grants for relief of personal hardship and distress<br />
grants for restoration of public assets to pre-disaster<br />
standard and emergency protection and repair work by<br />
State, local and semi-government authorities<br />
concessional loans to primary producers in working<br />
occupation of their properties for purchase of<br />
feed, restocking and restoration purposes, and<br />
freight subsidies for the transport of fodder,<br />
stock to and from agistment, and fence posts.<br />
The subsidy on the transport of fence posts is an additional<br />
measure to those provided under the arrangements, and the<br />
Commonwealth has agreed to its inclusion for this disaster<br />
only in recognition of the severity of the floods.<br />
Under the nat~ ural disaster relief arrangements the Commonweal. th<br />
provides $ 3 : or $ 1 of State expenditure on approved relief<br />
measures above the State's base figure for expenditure on al.<br />
major natural disasters in a financial year.<br />
I have noted the work of State emergency services in acting to<br />
contain the damage in what was a major flood situation. It is<br />
particularly noteworthy that there has been no loss of life in<br />
this emergency. 000---</p>
