CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATE BANQUET PAKISTAN<br />
6 FEBRUJARY 1989<br />
Prime Minister,<br />
It gives me enormous satisfaction to bring greetings from<br />
Australia to you and the Government and people of Pakistan as you<br />
once again assume your place among the democratic family of<br />
nations. It is also a great personal pleasure to be the first head of<br />
government making a bilateral visit to Pakistan since your<br />
election as Prime Minister.<br />
The last Australian Head of Government to visit Pakistan was the<br />
previous Labor Prime Minister, Gough Whitlam, who was received by<br />
your l~ ate father, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, in January 1975.<br />
Prime Minister,<br />
In your autobiography, you quote the great American<br />
revolutionary, Thomas Paine: " Tyranny, like hell, is not easily<br />
conquered; yet we have this consolation with us, that the harder<br />
the conflict, the more glorious the triumph".<br />
You and the people of Pakistan have indeed been through difficult<br />
years. But as you yourself wrote, you kept the flame of<br />
democracy alive during those years, and now with the restoration<br />
of democratic rule, you have won the glorious triumph of which<br />
Paine wrote.<br />
Your personal struggle in support of representative government<br />
and democratic processes has been much admired in Australia and<br />
throughout the world. There is no need for me to dwell on the<br />
cost of this struggle to you and your family.<br />
But I do say that the successful and peaceful elections held last<br />
year, and your firm commitment to strengthening democracy in<br />
Pakistan, give cause, for the greatest optimism and deserve the<br />
congratulations and support of the international community. </p>
<p>Prime Minister,<br />
As a former political prisoner yourself, you have already, since<br />
you assumed office, been active in advancing human rights issues,<br />
including the release of large numbers of such prisoners. You<br />
have also announced policies to alleviate illiteracy and poverty,<br />
to improve the status of women in society, to tackle corruption<br />
and to combat the narcotics trade.<br />
These initiatives together make up an important and chal] lenging<br />
agenda for domestic reform. Your commitment to combat drug abuse<br />
and the cultivation and trafficking of narcotics is one area in<br />
particular where my Government is very keen to assist your<br />
efforts and enhance our co-operation.<br />
Prime Minister,<br />
Now that representative government has returned to Pakistan, we<br />
should look for opportunities to build a more substantial.<br />
bilateral relationship between our two countries.<br />
In this task we start from a reasonable base of existing links<br />
between us.<br />
Australia was one of the first countries to open diplomatic<br />
relations with Pakistan, with an Australian diplomatic mission<br />
being established early in 1948.<br />
Australia's first Muslim community consisted of people from what<br />
is now Baluchistan and the North-West Frontier province of<br />
Pakistan. This community built Australia's first mosque, and<br />
some of their descendants are numbered among the 250,000 Muslims<br />
who live in Australia today.<br />
Since the independence of Pakistan, our two countries have worked<br />
together on a range of political and humanitarian issues,<br />
including those associated with the Soviet occupation of<br />
Afghanistan. Sport provides another sort of link, one that draws our peoples,<br />
not just our governments, together.<br />
Names like Mushtaq Mohammed, Asif Iqbal, Sarfraz Nawaz and,<br />
today, Imran Khan, Javed Miandad and Abdul Qadir are as familiar<br />
to Australians as they are to Pakistanis. We look forward to<br />
your cricketers making a full test tour of Australia next year.<br />
In addition to our shared obsession with cricket, hockey and<br />
squash, our two countries have much in common. </p>
<p>And yet Prime Minister we can do better. We can add new<br />
substance to the relationship. This, I believe, is particularly<br />
so in the field of trade and economic co-operation.<br />
These are areas which, if developed properly, could see<br />
significant benefits accruing to both countries. We need to<br />
encourage a greater understanding in our respective business<br />
communities of the opportunities that exist, and we need to<br />
encourage proposals for expanding business and commercial links.<br />
One specific form of activity awhich could be pursued more<br />
vigorously is the setting up of joint ventures, particularly<br />
those centred on the transfer of technology.<br />
Prime Minister,<br />
In suggesting closer economic co-operation, I am aware that our<br />
two economies are at different stages in their development, and<br />
that there is a number of immediate challenges which you face in<br />
the economic sphere.<br />
I know that among your current concerns is the shortfall in<br />
Pakistan's wheat supply because of the drought. I would ' Like to<br />
take this opportunity to assure you publicly that my Government<br />
is sympathetic to these concerns. To this end we will provide an<br />
immediate emergency aid contribution of 25,000 tonnes of wheat<br />
valued at some A$ 5.5 million.<br />
Australia has always stood ready to provide humanitarian<br />
assistance to people in need and we hope that this contribution<br />
can assist in overcoming the difficulties facing your people.<br />
In addition to the immediate food aid, my Government is also<br />
interested in enhancing our development co-operation program with<br />
Pakistan. I look forward to exchanging ideas with you tomorrow<br />
on what we might be able to do.<br />
Prime Minister,<br />
One of the greatest challenges facing us as we move towards the<br />
last decade of the twentieth century, a century sadly<br />
characterised by bloody global and regional conflict, is<br />
establishing the basis for a peaceful and more prosperous<br />
twenty-first century. We cannot leave as our legacy to future<br />
generations an international order that is characterised by<br />
instability, intolerance and fear. </p>
<p>There are encouraging developments, as a result of moves by the<br />
Soviet Union, the United States and China, to replace the<br />
confrontation of the past with constructive dialogue. In my<br />
recent meetings with the leadership of these countries, I have<br />
been impressed by their determination to tackle difficult<br />
questions and to take forward issues that were once the subject<br />
of impasse or intertia. Australia has done whatever it can to<br />
encourage that process.<br />
One issue that has affected both of us is Afghanistan, which was<br />
not only a cause for regional and international instability, but<br />
also a focus of humanitarian concern.<br />
The conclusion of the Geneva Accords leading to the withdrawal of<br />
SSoviet troops from Afghanistan was an important and commendable<br />
achievement. It highlighted the very positive changes underway<br />
in the Soviet Union and was a profound demonstration of the way<br />
in which improved superpower relations can have a direct and real<br />
impact on regional disputes.<br />
The international community appreciates the substantial<br />
contribution by Pakistan in providing a safe haven for the<br />
estimated 3.5 million refugees from Afghanistan. As you know,<br />
Australia has rendered assistance to these refugees through<br />
contributions of food aid and other assistance worth over<br />
million. We have also pledged a contribution of $ 20 million to<br />
the appeal launched by the United Nations special co-ordinator<br />
for Afghanistan to assist Afghan refugees in returning to their<br />
homeland. Another area in which we have witnessed the positive benefits<br />
from this new spirit of co-operation between the superpowers, is<br />
in the field of disarmament, where important commitments have<br />
been made to reduce the nuclear and other weapons arsenals which<br />
threaten our very existence.<br />
In South Asia, Australia has watched with concern the threat of<br />
nuclear proliferation. It was in this context that we welcomed<br />
the recent initiative taken by you and Prime Minister Gandhi in<br />
signing an agreement prohibiting attacks on each other's nuclear<br />
installations. It is our hope that this agreement will lead to<br />
further steps which can help to assure that the nuclear programs<br />
pursued in the region are directed solely towards peaceful<br />
non-explosive uses.<br />
I would like to restate the Australian Government's firm<br />
conviction that the widest possible adherence to the Nuclear<br />
Non-Proliferation Treaty is essential if we are to eliminate the<br />
spectre of a nuclear holocaust. </p>
<p>Prime Minister,<br />
We acknowledge Pakistan as an important member of the South Asian<br />
region. Australia, indeed the world, has a clear interest in<br />
stability and peace in South Asia. It is for this reason, as<br />
well as the potential for improving the living standards of the<br />
member countries, that we welcome the dialogue and co-operation<br />
being forged through the SAARC. It is for the same reason that<br />
we applaud the steps which you, so early in your period in<br />
office, and Prime Minister Gandhi in India have taken to reach<br />
out to one another and reduce the tensions which have too often<br />
affected relations between your countries.<br />
Let me place on record that Australia warmly welcomes your<br />
Government's decision to rejoin the Commonwealth. We have always<br />
supported this and speaking for Australia would welcome without<br />
hesitation your representing democratic Pakistan at the next<br />
Commonwealth Heads of Government in Kuala Lumpur in October.<br />
I began, Prime Minister, by referring to your autobiography.<br />
Since the author does not exist who resents favourable quotation,<br />
let me end in the same vein.<br />
" Nobody who loves Pakistan," you wrote, " can help dreaming of a<br />
great and prosperous future for our country and for the people.<br />
But drastic steps must be taken to preserve that vision."<br />
You are ushering in a new period in Pakistani history a period<br />
of hope and reform, and we hope, of peace and prosperity.<br />
We wish you well as you undertake the hard work that lies ahead<br />
of you.<br />
I thank you for your hospitality, and I look forward to welcoming<br />
you soon to Canberra. </p>
