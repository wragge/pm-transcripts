    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Turnbull Government is taking decisive action to reduce energy prices for Australian families and businesses.</p>
<p>It is simply not good enough that some consumers cannot always afford to turn on their lights, heating and equipment. This must stop.</p>
<p>Too many families are not on the best power deal. That is why today we took further action.</p>
<p>We are pleased to have secured agreement from retailers on immediate measures and ongoing changes, to be backed by law, to put families and small business first.</p>
<p>The commitments include:</p>
<ul><li>Contacting all the customers now who are on expired discounts and telling them how much they can save on a better deal.</li>
<li>Requiring companies report to the Government and ACCC what they are doing to get families on to a better deal and how many families remain on expired deals.</li>
<li>Developing simple, plain English, fact sheets with understandable comparison rates.</li>
<li>Support a change to the electricity rules requiring companies to inform customers when their discount benefits end, setting out the dollar impact of doing nothing.</li>
<li>Ensuring families and individuals on hardship programs will not lose any benefit or discount for late payment.</li>
</ul><p>These are the immediate actions we have secured to help ensure families are not paying more for their power than they should.</p>
<p>The industry and government will continue to work together over the coming months to make more changes that will ensure families do not have to pay a cent more for electricity than they need to.</p>
<p>These significant reforms build on those already achieved by the Turnbull Government to drive a more affordable and reliable energy system.</p>
<p>We are already:</p>
<ul><li>Driving down gas prices through our export licensing regime and reforms to pipelines.</li>
<li>Stopping energy companies gaming the system, restricting appeals that lead to higher prices.</li>
<li>Directing the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to forensically examine energy companiesâ€™ behaviour.</li>
<li>Encouraging innovation and new technology, including the development of the game-changing Snowy Hydro 2.0.</li>
</ul>]]></content>
