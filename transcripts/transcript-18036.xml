Today Australia is mourning the loss of a great artist and a true Australian national treasure, Margaret Olley.</p>
<p>On behalf of the nation we extend our deepest sympathies to Margaret's family and friends at this difficult time.</p>
<p>Famous for her colourful and sensitive works that focused on everyday objects and domestic interiors, Margaret led an extraordinary career that spanned over six decades and included numerous solo exhibitions around Australia and abroad. </p>
<p>Margaret will also be remembered for her spirited and candid character, her passionate and generous mentoring of young Australian artists and her many donations to the arts.</p>
<p>In 1990 she established the Margaret Hannah Olley Art Trust which funded many important acquisitions by public art institutions in Australia. </p>
<p>Margaret also donated a great number of her own pieces and those by her artist friends, including Arthur Boyd and Donald Friend, to be enjoyed by all Australians.</p>
<p>Margaret was twice the subject of an Archibald Prize-winning painting, first at the outset of her career by William Dobell in 1948 and again, six decades later by Ben Quilty in 2011.</p>
<p>The symmetry of these prize-winning portraits is fitting of a woman with such a fine career.</p>
<p>In 1991 Margaret was awarded the Office of the Order of Australia for service as an artist and to the promotion of art and in 2001 was awarded the Centenary Medal for services to Australian society and art.</p>
<p>In 2006, Margaret was awarded our nation's highest civilian honour, the Companion of the Order of Australia, for service as one of Australia's most distinguished artists, for support and philanthropy to the visual and performing arts, and for the encouragement of young and emerging artists. </p>
