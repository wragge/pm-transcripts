    <content><![CDATA[<p>In his first real incursion into the policy debate since resuming the Labor leadership, Mr Beazley has fallen at the first hurdle.</p>
<p>Delivering his address to the Australian - Melbourne Institute Sustaining Prosperity Conference, Mr Beazley claimed to embrace the reforms of the Hawke and Keating Governments.  Yet in 1996 he walked away from this agenda, reluctant to be identified with the policies of his Labor predecessors.</p>
<p> More tellingly, in his remarks today the Leader of the Opposition said:</p>
<p>"The scope for productivity gains from the old reform agenda of deregulation, privatisation and industrial relations reform is largely exhausted."</p>
<p>This is a remarkable admission.  The most pressing policy reform at present, and one that will deliver the greatest benefits to Australia, is further reform of the workplace relations system.  More flexibility in employment conditions will translate into greater job opportunities and better real wage outcomes, especially at a time when the unemployment rate is close to a thirty year low.</p>
<p>The Labor Party failed to come up with a credible workplace relations policy at the last election, and Mr Beazley now believes that such reforms are irrelevant.</p>
<p>Likewise, Mr Beazley considers that there is no need for further regulatory reform.  One of the critical issues in the current infrastructure debate, however, is whether regulatory bottlenecks are impacting on the operation of Australia's ports and other export-related infrastructure.</p>
<p>Mr Beazley continues to demonstrate his shortcomings in developing sensible public policy.  </p>
