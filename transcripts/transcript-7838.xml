TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCE, WARRAGUL ARTS CENTRE<br />
1 DECEM4BER 1989<br />
E OE PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: I was wondering why this is your second visit to<br />
Warracgul in such short a time. Are you concerned about Mr<br />
Cunningham retaining McMillan?<br />
PM: No, no. He will increase his majority. But there've been<br />
good reasons for coming here and as I indicated in my remarks in<br />
there I like the region very much. It's been an important part<br />
of my life when I lived in Melbourne. But when I was down then<br />
it was to do things that were appropriate to be done here. on<br />
this occasion it seemed to me that it was a very good place in<br />
which to launch our rural program. Barry will increase his<br />
majority whenever the election is held, as he deserves to. An<br />
outstanding Member.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you concerned by the NSW Labor Council's<br />
findings that you're in trouble at the next election?<br />
PM: It was not a finding of the NSW Labor Council. I understood<br />
it was some draft document which someone there put down some<br />
thoughts at apparently a period when our fortunes weren't at<br />
their most brilliant. But I would've thought if you wanted to<br />
get your money on now as to outcomes it's quite clear which side<br />
you should be on. I just noticed the Sun headline. It said<br />
jitters'I. We need to look at the end of this week in Parliament<br />
who's got the jitters and it ain't us boy.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you saying that report was out of date?<br />
PM: I'm saying it had no status. It wasn't a finding, it wasn't<br />
a decision of the Labor Council. I could you provide you with<br />
papers that are floating around the Liberal Party that would make<br />
you shudder. I could find you papers, draft papers and ideas in<br />
our Party at times that I'd shudder at. What you've got to worry<br />
about is what will be the decision of the union movement. Now<br />
the Labor Council of NSW is part of the ACTU. Now they didn't<br />
shuffle around a few draft papers in Adelaide at their meeting<br />
this week. They unanimously decided, including the Labor Council<br />
of NSW, that they would be supporting the Labor Government in its<br />
re-election next year. That's a very sensible decision. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: If I could ask you perhaps about the Queensland<br />
election, your prediction and why you haven't been there.<br />
PM: I have been there and I went up there w'ith Mr Goss and we had<br />
a very very f ine time together in Mt Isa. So the. premise of the<br />
question is not right. As to the outcome, I believe that at last<br />
truth, ' beauty and justice will triumph and that Queenslanders at<br />
last will rid themselves of the corruption and the darkness which<br />
has featured in Queensland politics for all this period now of<br />
more than 30 years. The Queenslanders realise that there is<br />
basically one issue and one issue alone, that is are they going<br />
to get rid of corrupt government and have decent, clean and<br />
competent government. And they know that there is only one way<br />
they can do that. This isn't a partisan It's not as though<br />
you've got here's two or three over there out of which one could<br />
provide an alternative. The fact is that the only alternative<br />
government for Mr Goss would be a combination of the two parties<br />
that have been up to it in their eyeballs in all this for the<br />
greater part of this last 32 years. So the only way to cleanse<br />
Queensland politics is by electing Goss. I believe that's what<br />
will happen.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you predicting a close victory or<br />
PM: No, you'd be silly to be talking about landslides. I think<br />
on all the private indications I've got as well as the public<br />
polling I think it will be a clear victory. But<br />
JOURNALIST: chance, or roughly.<br />
PM: Yes, it's of that sort of order, 52 can do it. And of course<br />
it depends upon how the vote is actually distributed between<br />
electorates. I mean we'vo seen a pattern of politics in<br />
Australia over the last few years where you can get quite<br />
sophisticated distributions within electorates. But all I can<br />
say is on all the evidence available to me I think that<br />
Queenslanders do know what the issue is. That is, do we want to<br />
get rid of corrupt government yes. How do we do it? Is there<br />
any way other than voting for Goss answer, no. Therefore,<br />
conclusion I believe Goss will be elected.<br />
JOURNALIST: On another subject, if I could just ask your<br />
feelings on the possibility of the pilots rejoining the<br />
arbitration system<br />
PM: I've made it quite clear all along that that's what I wanted<br />
them to do. I mean from the beginning of this issue I urged<br />
them, don't go outside the system. That was Hawke's consistent<br />
position. I said stay in the system, you can't operate outside<br />
it and we will not accept the position of your operating outside<br />
it. Now they wouldn't accept that advice at the beginning. It </p>
<p>looks as though after all this trauma that they've inflicted on<br />
themselves and on the country, it looks as though they understand<br />
that it's only in the system. Now what they've done is lodged<br />
the application. Obviously the Commission will have to consider<br />
it. The Commission has said there are three conditions that<br />
they'll need to abide by. I trust that the AFAP will do that<br />
because at no point have I wanted to see a smashing of the AFAP.<br />
Quite the contrary. My position would be if they accept those<br />
conditions that the Commission has laid down, conditions may I<br />
say which are not special for the AFAP. They're the same as<br />
every other organisation has to abide by. I hope they'll accept<br />
those conditions and that then they'll make an application to be<br />
bound and that the Commission will hear that and make the<br />
decision on its merits. In that way what will happen is what<br />
should've happened, as I've said, from the very beginning.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, have you got anything to say about the<br />
Aquino government and its problems?<br />
PM: Yes, I can say that I've been kept nformedjfrom early this<br />
morning about developments and the advice that I have is that the<br />
Aquino government should survive. The President seems to have<br />
the support of the majority, the significant majority of the<br />
armed forces. That's the latest report I've got. I have sent<br />
a message to President Aquino indicating of course the support<br />
of the Australian Government and people for her duly elected<br />
government. JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, with the election date. When are you<br />
making your announcement?<br />
PM: Oh mate, good try.<br />
JOURNALIST: You alluded in there before that you might make an<br />
announcement within the next few weeks.<br />
PM: I didn't. I said I couldn't give you a scoop here. But<br />
good try. I'Id love to be able to do it in Warragul but I'm sorry<br />
mate, sorry.<br />
ends </p>
