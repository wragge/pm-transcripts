FOR PRESS NO. 51/ 1967.<br />
VICTORIAN ELECTION RESULT<br />
Comment by the Prime Minister, Mr, Harold Holt.<br />
Sir Henry Bolte is to be congratulated on a notable<br />
political victory and a personal triumph.<br />
It is a real achievement to be confirmed with so large<br />
a majority after 12 years in office.<br />
The result is a tribute to his firm, forthright, positive<br />
and constructive leadership. The people of Victoria clearly want<br />
a party which stands for all sections of the community and is<br />
strong enough to resist sectional pressures.<br />
The result reflects the strength of Liberalism in<br />
Victoria and is consistent with the result there in the Federal<br />
elections. It is to be hooed that the Legislative Council will<br />
respect the sweeping mandate given to the Premier and his Government<br />
in the Legislative Assembly. He h:-s the entitlement of democratic<br />
endorsement to go steadily ahead with the programme he placed<br />
before the electorate. It is good to know I can Inok forward to a continuance<br />
of the constructive cooper. tion which has marked my own<br />
relationship as Leader of the Federal Government with Sir Henry<br />
in his capacity as Leader of the Government of Victoria.<br />
CA 1ERRA. 30TH APRIL, 1967. </p>
