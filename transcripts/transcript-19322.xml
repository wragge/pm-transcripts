<p>Australians diagnosed with cancer will benefit from better collection and reporting of national cancer data under a new funding initiative announced today.</p>
<p>The clinical management and outcomes of many cancers depends on the stage of disease at diagnosis.</p>
<p>However, there is currently no national cancer data in this area, leaving gaps in our knowledge.</p>
<p>We must fill this gap if we are to continue to lead the world in cancer care.</p>
<p>The Gillard Government will provide Cancer Australia with $2.4 million over the next four years to collect, collate and report national data on:• The stage of the disease when cancer is diagnosed;• The treatments applied at each stage; and• How frequently cancer recurs after treatment.</p>
<p>An estimated 125,000 people will be diagnosed with cancer this year, with this figure expected to rise to 150,000 in 2020.</p>
<p>Improved cancer data will help to improve cancer care.</p>
<p>National collection and reporting of this data will fill a significant gap in our knowledge by identifying areas that may benefit from new approaches to the delivery of best practice cancer care.</p>
<p>It will also provide important insight into variations in survival outcomes by cancer type and of the cancer pathway after diagnosis.</p>
<p>Through this funding, Cancer Australia will also develop a framework to monitor and report on a set of indicators that will benchmark cancer control efforts in Australia, nationally and internationally.</p>
<p>Cancer Council Australia chief executive Professor Ian Olver AM said evidence was the key to effective cancer care.</p>
<p>"Cancer survival statistics help provide the big picture. But we need data sets on stage at diagnosis, recurrence and responsiveness to treatment to guide best practice," he said.</p>
<p>Cancer Australia is the Australian Government's national agency providing leadership in cancer control to improve outcomes for those affected by cancer, their families and carers.</p>
<p>This initiative will start on 1 July 2013. </p>
