<p>I am pleased to announce that I have appointed Mr Blair Comley PSM as Secretary of the Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism.</p>
<p>I recently appointed the current Secretary of that Department, Mr Drew Clarke PSM, to fill the vacancy in the Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy.</p>
<p>Mr Comley has been Secretary of the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency since 2011.  Prior to this appointment, Mr Comley was a Deputy Secretary in the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency and previously held a range of senior positions in the Treasury.  He also represented Australia for three years on economic matters at the OECD and was the Acting Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Office of Financial Management</p>
<p>Mr Comley's knowledge and experience mean that he is well placed to take on the role of Secretary of the Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism.</p>
<p>Having received a report from the Secretary of my Department, as required by the Public Service Act 1999, I have appointed Mr Comley for a period of five years from 11 March 2013. </p>
<p>I will make a further announcement in relation to the position of Secretary of the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency shortly.</p>
