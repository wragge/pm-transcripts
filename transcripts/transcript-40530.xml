    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Commonwealth Government will provide $10 million to progress planning and early works for Brisbane’s Cross River Rail and to support the establishment of the Cross River Rail Delivery Authority.</p>
<p>This is an opportunity for the Commonwealth Government to work with the Queensland Government to ensure a long-term and integrated solution to reduce congestion in the CBD, improve public transport services and strengthen urban renewal and amenity opportunities offered by Cross River Rail.</p>
<p>More work is required on how the Cross River Rail project will interact with other transport projects such as the proposed Brisbane Metro.  The Commonwealth Government encourages all levels of Government to work together to develop integrated transport solutions. </p>
<p>The Commonwealth Government will be represented on the Cross River Rail Delivery Authority Board.</p>
<p>This funding complements the $50 million allocated by the Queensland Government in the 2016-17 State Budget to Cross River Rail.</p>
