EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
4AUSTRALIA C<br />
PRIME MDIISTER T<br />
FOR MEDIA 22 APRIL 1979<br />
ADDRESS TO FEDERAL COUNCIL PERTH<br />
Australia is moving ahead again. Recovery is underway.<br />
billion of investment projects are ready to go, or are in their<br />
final feasibility stages around Australia.<br />
Private investment grew by 24 percent in 1978. Investment in<br />
mining grew by 56 percent and the mining industry expects<br />
an increase of 32 percent in 1979.<br />
There is a major surge in investment in aluminium, projects:<br />
in New South Wales the $ 500 million Alurnax aluminium smelter,<br />
in Victoria the $ 350 million Alcoa smelter, here in Western<br />
Australia the $ 200 million Alcoa aluiiui refinery at Wagerup;<br />
and in Queensland the $ 540 million Comalco aluminium smelter<br />
at Galdstone. As well, Alcan has announced that it will expand<br />
its smelter at Kurri Kurri. All this is the best part of a<br />
$ 2,000 million investment expansion in this single area. We<br />
have the power, the bauxite, the political stability and the<br />
economic policies that adds up to an immense aluminium. industry<br />
for Australia.<br />
Oil exploration is taking off. Between 83 and 143 exploration<br />
wells will be drilled this year. Even the lower end of this<br />
scale would be the best result for seven years. The North West<br />
Shelf project is being proved up by a $ 50 million feasibility<br />
study. This has the potential to be Australia's greatest<br />
single resource development. Exploration is going ahead in<br />
the Exmouth Plateau, one of the most intensive deep water<br />
undertakings anywhere in the world, in an area often regarded<br />
as offering our best chance of a further major oil discovery.<br />
Resource projects are only part of the story. Last year<br />
inflation came down to less than 8 percent, the lowest annual<br />
figure since 1972. Our renewed competitiveness is the catalyst<br />
for a revival of manufacturing investment. In 1978 manufacturing<br />
investment increased by 21 percent. Since the beginning of<br />
this year ICI has announced a $ 500 million petrochemical plant<br />
in Victoria. GMH will go ahead with a $ 210 million enqine<br />
complex in Victoria. / 2 </p>

wheat; payments and our better export receipts. but-the<br />
Governinent has bceen concerned about the rate of growth in the<br />
money stzpjly. We have taken action to moclify this growth.<br />
Trhe Government has determined that up to ai further $ 300 million<br />

OnG of the false assuimptionB current nMongst peOPle USed to<br />
interest rates for new . tssues of Coftmnonwalth bonds being<br />
announced three or four tiLmes, a year is that iterest rate policy<br />
is reflected solely in newj issuo rates. In -" act people ought<br />
to look at the rates the Rleserve Bank uvs in its ownl<br />
market operat~ op. Hlad they done thlis over racent weeks, they<br />
would have seen that the D3ank has been mioving or. interestC<br />
rates, and has been trading at rates signlificantly higher than<br />
those prevailing : 3ix months ago, The Goverroe'nt has m~ ade it<br />
plain that it lo dezermined to maintain an~ elfectivc maonetary<br />
stance, and the Treasurer will ba makilig a statemnnt on<br />
monetary policy later today.<br />
Greater aotlvity in Australia,, hi-gher bee,, f and oJi. 1 priceas<br />
and wage clacisions that were too lenient have lea to a pausef<br />
in tha downwarde thrust in the C. P. I. Sinc; A Noveaber there<br />
has also bmen a rise in inflation in a nww. ber of overaeas<br />
countries. In the two mornths to February 1979 cons~ ver prices<br />
ros in the U. S. A by 2.1 percent, jn tha U. K. by 2.3 parcent, I.<br />
and in Germany by 1.7 percent. Theze rises were all wall above<br />
the rises in the samre two months of 1978. Many econoMists<br />
predict tha~ t in 1979 inflAtion will riae in most Comm~ onI<br />
Market aountries. One eztirnate is for inflation rates ol<br />
12 percent for tha United Kingdom~, 11 percent for France, and<br />
percent for Italy.<br />
Because there are in-flationary pressures both overseas and in<br />
countries) we must rainforca the figJht agaitist inflation.<br />
We must consolidate the gains wo have made, We must not blow<br />
the recovery. Australia could blow recovery by irresponsible<br />
m~ onetary and f iscal policies. This will not happen. Australia<br />
could also blow t1-he recovery by Irreoponaible wage demands,<br />
by a rash of strikes and dispu1tes. The Gov*. rrument Is<br />
determined to use all its powers to prey-ant this.<br />
with any rocovery there is the danger of the resurgence of<br />
inflation especially when wage claims are pressed too hard<br />
and especially if mapnufacterers believa that they can take<br />
advantage of a better trading position to put ' up their prices<br />
unreasonably. The Government will be vigilant on both front8.<br />
we will sup yort the PJTr and the Arbitration Commission. The<br />
Prices Just ication Tribunal is coirrently exanImning the food<br />
proces2sing industry. mir. Fife has stated that the PJT, under<br />
its revised Act, will inguire into industries whoze prices have<br />
a m~ ajor impaot on the Consumer Price Index, or which have a<br />
aign ficant impact upon-thle level of prices in other industries. </p>
<p>Zxo; Dsalv: wage dinad5-are a sexcto%) threat to Att. tralia's<br />
f vtuxo.. Tihay could abort rejotcy, The * great: -iajority of<br />
wage earnerm understand this. Thzey Y-now -that excesIoive waga<br />
demnds lead to more inflation and would undermin-e* the<br />
competitive base we have built kup over the last thrc-e years<br />
and de-4 oy Jobr, for AustrzlionS. We have no intention of<br />
allowing' Chat to happen.<br />
But the problen. not just one of wage claims. A numbor of<br />
unionz unc strikes, bans, go-slows and disrt~ ptions with<br />
total irresponsibility and total disregard for other psople.<br />
These ac-t-ions seem derpigned to sabotaige the recovery. The<br />
political philonophy of some trade union leaders thrives on<br />
recession, stagnation, disruption and instability in Australia.<br />
Strikes, and bans and Ind~ ustrial diiSruptiOn harl the striker<br />
and his firm. TLhey haym the comtnunity.<br />
There have been too many disruptions in recent wieeks. None of<br />
these aotions was necessary. They were totally disruptive,<br />
Thsey were solf inb because they disregar-ded the hurt done to<br />
othier people. But it is not only selfish so often strikes~<br />
are fruitlass anid stupid. OnG of the mio~ t pointless things about<br />
so many industrial disputes is that people go out strike and<br />
do not realise how much thany are htirting theslveq. IfC people,<br />
before going on strike, did their su-ins th ey would see that the<br />
sensible~ thing to do ia to let the issue go to the Arbitration<br />
Comm~ icion. The strik~ ers themselvo: 3 lose pay a loss they<br />
maay not be able to recover for years even if they oucceed in<br />
forcing their demands through.<br />
Do the union leaders lose their wages? So often the answer is<br />
no. Nobody wine in strikes and it is precisely because nobody<br />
winz that we have an arbitration systemn the impartial umpire<br />
to enable us to resolve disputes withouit harming anyone. We<br />
need to give that umpire a fair go. This Government will not*<br />
sit back and see this nation hecld to ransomn by irresp1, onsible<br />
wion loaders.<br />
if people go on citrike, put on bans and limitationsr instead of<br />
going to the Arbitration Cormnisiofl'-in the area of Govern~ ant<br />
employment we are already rigorously applying the " no work<br />
as directed, no pay" princple, -and wher-e there is no work for<br />
other people as a result of a strive we are already applying<br />
stand down provisions. The Governmnt's view is that the<br />
Cl~-_ aiission 5h'ould not prooeed to hear a unionL's wage c3. ainm<br />
while di-rect industrial action is continuing, In the case of<br />
two recanic industrial disputes thte pabnt ino~ ugtr. st. rike and the<br />

Given the problemx that confleonted Australia when we tooloffice<br />
it was obvious that getting the economy right was going<br />
to be a major task for the Governm~ ent. It iS oloAr that we have<br />
had a sigrtific. cint succes; s in this area, but our concern with<br />
economic matters has not becri at the exponse o~ e other Liberal<br />
goals. We have nioved alongJ the path of enlightened and<br />
liberal reform ; yhich is central to our idantity as a<br />
Liberal~ Gojve = ent. We have pravidcd nflective help for th~ sa<br />

The Liberal Party is uniquely situated to lead Australia<br />
into the eighties. Our policies are directed towards<br />
people, towards the needs and aspirations of all Australians.<br />
We have a commitment to sound economic management., and<br />
forward-looking policies. We have a record of economic<br />
achievement. We are a Government of reform in social<br />
welfar&amp;, in law, and ingovernment. We are committed to<br />
individual freedom, to working for a caring and tolerant<br />
society. Australia is a great country with vast resources<br />
and a great people. With a Liberal Government, we can<br />
realise Australia's enormous potential. With a Liberal<br />
Government, Australia can go into the eighties with confidence.<br />
