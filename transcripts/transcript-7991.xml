PRIME INISTE<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH RAY MARTIN, MIDDAY SHOW,<br />
22 MARCH 1990<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
MARTIN: Welcome PM.<br />
PM: Thanks.<br />
MARTIN: You've had seven years in office, you've spent<br />
the best part of 20 million bucks on trying to convince<br />
the electorate that you should win this election. Why<br />
haven't you convinced them?<br />
PM: Well, I thought it was a bit of an even split there,<br />
but we've got, we've got a bit of a hard fight on our<br />
hands. MARTIN: Let's ask again. Those who think Bob Hawke has<br />
the answers put your hands up. Can I be honest?<br />
Here's your chance.<br />
PM: Yes, let's ask.<br />
MARTIN: Well those who don't think he has? Alright go<br />
ahead. So you've only convinced half.<br />
PM: Yes, well half, half plus one will be enough, but I<br />
admit I know that people here in this audience and out<br />
there in Australia have had some tough times and I just<br />
want to make this point. I've been in public life all my<br />
adult life. I've worked for ordinary Australians all my<br />
life and I wouldn't impose hardship for the sake of doing<br />
it. We just reached the point where we had to slow<br />
things down a bit because we were importing too much and<br />
I--know it's hurt and I'm sorry about that. But now the<br />
banking industry is saying the rates can come off and<br />
they will.<br />
MARTIN: I want to talk about that<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
MARTIN: I mean, I suggest one of the reasons people have<br />
some doubts about both sides is the headlines and what<br />
they've seen over the last five weeks. In some ways the </p>
<p>Alice in Wonderland headlines for non economists, people<br />
simply reading it<br />
PM: Sure.<br />
MARTIN: Such as jobless up, housing down, Government<br />
happy. Or today's brink of recession, headlines we see,<br />
Australia in the brink of recession and a headline that<br />
says Keating, beautiful figures. How do they make sense<br />
out of that?<br />
PM: Well, it's hard for people who are, are not<br />
economists to, to understand the complexities of the<br />
figures, but could I quickly try and make it as simple as<br />
I can? We were growing that fast that we were sucking in<br />
too many imports we couldn't afford so we had to slow<br />
things down a bit. Obviously when you do that people get<br />
hurt and I, I don't like that but now what the banking<br />
industry is saying that that's worked and they say after<br />
next Saturday when we're returned, that the rates can<br />
come off.<br />
MARTIN: Is the banking industry saying that<br />
PM: Yes, they are indeed.<br />
MARTIN: On the front page, front page of today's paper<br />
had Nobby Clark, who's the boss of the National Australia<br />
Bank saying what you've done in the monetary policy<br />
is akin to Atilla the Hun.<br />
PM: Yes, well Nobby Clark is two things. He's the head<br />
of a bank and he's also a lifelong identification with<br />
the Tories. Now when he wants to make comments like<br />
Atilla the Hun that's not objective bankers' talk. I, I<br />
prefer to rely on what the Reuters screen said the night<br />
before last and they said that rates will come down<br />
assuming that Hawke's re-elected.<br />
MARTIN: Bob, but you know, I mean, John Hewson is an ex<br />
professor of economics, Andrew Peacock has got some<br />
background, so did John Howard as being Treasurer of this<br />
country. They, you can do anything with statistics. You<br />
can say we're on top of things, they say we're in a<br />
recession. PM: Well, the, there's no-one who can say on the basis<br />
of yesterday's statistics that we're in a recession. Noone<br />
and no-one has said because it's impossible to say<br />
we're in a recession.<br />
MARTIN: How about brink of a recession.<br />
PM: No because, look, the technical things I want to<br />
avoid, but when you, when you get up a set of national<br />
accounts you do two sides. You look at increase in<br />
spending, increase in income. On the increase in </p>
<p>spending side it's a positive 0.7 percent. On the income<br />
side it's 0.2 minus.<br />
MARTIN: Now we're about to lose them.<br />
PM: I know.<br />
MARTIN: As you say, you, you don't want to get<br />
technical, all I'm say is you say no,<br />
PM: recession.<br />
MARTIN: Well, headlines of papers say it<br />
PM: Well, look I<br />
MARTIN: the papers say it. Are they all wrong and<br />
you're right?<br />
PM: No, but the economists are not saying it.<br />
MARTIN: The front page of the Herald this morning<br />
brink of recession.<br />
PM: Front page of the Herald says brink of recession.<br />
That doesn't say that economists are saying it.<br />
MARTIN: The Australian Financial Review says recession,<br />
question mark.<br />
PM: Question mark, question mark. You're perfectly<br />
entitled to say question mark, is there one? The answer<br />
is no, there's not.<br />
MARTIN: We've got pensioners here, a group who've<br />
probably heard politicians, heard politicians for the<br />
last 60 years.<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
MARTIN: on the eve of an election say, I can do it<br />
right for you and most times they lied.<br />
PM: Well, let me, say as far as pensioners are<br />
concerned, when I was at the ACTU the representative of<br />
the pensioners, Marjorie Noonan, came to me, a young<br />
research officer said, can you work out with me some way<br />
of trying to get a formula to look after pensions. I<br />
said let me work on it. I came up with the idea that<br />
what should happen is that pensions should be a<br />
percentage of average earnings. In other words, as you<br />
and I in the workforce, as our earnings increase, those<br />
who've set, created this world for us in this country,<br />
their pensions should come up as we go. So we got the<br />
idea of 25 percent of earnings. When I came to office<br />
the pension was 22.7 percent of earnings. Now, in just a<br />
couple of weeks time as a result of legislation, it will<br />
be over 25 percent of earnings the highest it's been </p>
<p>for 40 years. So I've gone from being a research officer<br />
who worked out the concept to the Prime Minister who's<br />
done it.<br />
MARTIN: We've had the Pensioners Association on here,<br />
Bob, and they say that both Parties really don't care<br />
about pensioners because inflation hits the little nest<br />
egg that they have<br />
PM: The Australian Pensioners Federation have come out<br />
and said that pensioners should vote for Labor. That's<br />
the largest group and they've said you should vote Labor.<br />
MARTIN: What, what, in fact, as you know<br />
PM: But the largest one has said they should vote for<br />
Labor and it's not surprising. I mean, 22.7 percent when<br />
Hawke comes in, it's now 25 percent. We've increased the<br />
purchasing power by seven percent, they reduced it by two<br />
and a half percent. I mean, who would you go for?<br />
MARTIN: Does your life, does you economy seem rosy you<br />
people who are on pensions?<br />
PM: No-one's saying it's rosy.<br />
MARTIN: But I mean, that, that's the danger. I mean, we<br />
went through this last night when you spoke to Jana as<br />
well. There's a picture abroad that somehow the economy<br />
is under control, that somehow things are good<br />
PM: No, but..<br />
MARTIN: But people who come in here every day don't<br />
think things are good.<br />
PM: No, I'm not trying to say that things are good for<br />
everyone, but what I do say amongst other things, is<br />
this. Look at the jobs we've created. Now we've created<br />
Jobs, 1.6 million of them, five times faster than the<br />
other mob, twice as fast as the rest of the world we've<br />
created jobs. We've got investment higher than it's ever<br />
been. We've got manufacturing industry now exporting<br />
cars to Japan.<br />
MARTIN: And we've got a debt of $ 120 billion, the<br />
fareign debt and we've got 17 percent interest rates.<br />
PM: Yes, but, part of that, part of that debt has been<br />
the investment coming in to restructure our industry. I<br />
mean, you can't now have BHP being a major exporter of<br />
steel without it having imported machinery and equipment<br />
to put itself in a position<br />
MARTIN: But you know, I mean, as I just said a moment<br />
ago, you can do anything with statistics. You're saying<br />
this at the moment and all the papers Australians are </p>
<p>reading this morning say recession question mark, despite<br />
what you say.<br />
PM: Well, what I'm say is that all the papers were<br />
telling us at the end of last year, in the latter part of<br />
the year, they were telling me what you've got to do is<br />
slow the economy down, we can't keep having this level of<br />
imports. We've done that. The high interest rates have<br />
worked and now they can come off.<br />
MARTIN: Did you tell us in ' 87, did you predict in the<br />
' 87 election that interest rates would fall within three<br />
years? PM: And interest rates did fall after ' 87. They came<br />
down dramatically after the election in ' 87.<br />
MARTIN: So what, 17 percent now?<br />
PM: Yes, and then they went up because<br />
MARTIN: But they went up again.<br />
PM: Yes, they went up again and they went up because we<br />
had a situation in this country of excessive demand.<br />
I've said that I and all the Government economists, like<br />
every economist in this country, underestimated the<br />
strength of demand that we got in this country.<br />
MARTIN: What's to stop you, in two years time when<br />
things don't go according to your predictions at the<br />
moment saying, well we didn't expect that.<br />
PM: Well all I can say is that what the Australian<br />
people have to, have to do on Saturday a very simple<br />
choice. They're going to wake up on, on the following<br />
day with either Bob Hawke as Prime Minister or Andrew<br />
Peacock. Now Bob Hawke has got a predictable wages<br />
outcome, Andrew Peacock has said he doesn't know, but<br />
everyone else says the wages will explode under them.<br />
MARTIN: He says they won't of course.<br />
PM: Well<br />
MARTIN: He sat here and said they won't explode.<br />
PM: He said when he was asked what will the outcome be<br />
and he said ' who's to know'.<br />
MARTIN: But you said last year in the West Australian<br />
election, you said that interest rates were going to come<br />
down before the end of the year.<br />
PM: Yes and I believed, on all the evidence available,<br />
that would be the case.<br />
MARTIN: But they didn't. </p>
<p>PM: Well, what happened. I've just said, we<br />
MARTIN: But, I know what you said<br />
PM: Let me make the point, Ray, let me make the point.<br />
MARTIN: These people have heard that, Bob. They've heard<br />
that for the last six years of their lives.<br />
PM: And they've heard me be honest and say, like every<br />
economist, like every economist in this country in the<br />
private sector, in the public sector we underestimated<br />
it. I'm saying, I mean, can I be more honest than that?<br />
We all, every economist, underestimated the strength of<br />
demand. We were wrong.<br />
MARTIN: Alright. Couple of quick yes, no answers before<br />
we bring your lovely wife out.<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
MARTIN: Will the Democrats preference decide the<br />
election on Saturday?<br />
PM: Preferences not only of Democrats, but<br />
independents-<br />
MARTIN: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: Yes, they will be decisive.<br />
MARTIN: And have you spent a million dollars as Richard<br />
Farmer writes, chasing that second preference vote?<br />
PM: I don't know what the figure is. I mean, there's<br />
obviously been a lot of advertising. I don't know, I<br />
doubt if it's a million, but we've obviously spent a fair<br />
bit. MARTIN: But certainly in my 25 years of covering<br />
politics, I've never seen a candidate, senior candidate,<br />
come out on camera and say give us your second<br />
preference. PM: Yes, well, simply because we are in a different<br />
world now, not only in Australia but right around the<br />
world, environment has become an issue of dimension it<br />
never did before. In this country and all around the<br />
world, there are an increasing number of people who are<br />
saying our first concern is the environment. And I've<br />
simply said alright, if your first concern is the<br />
environment and you're going to give your first vote to<br />
someone, make sure that you make sense of your concern by<br />
giving your determinative preference to the Party whose<br />
got the best record on the environment.<br />
MARTIN: Alright, yes, no, if we can. </p>
<p>PM: Yes, sure.<br />
MARTIN: If you had to choose, is Victoria the key State<br />
on Saturday. Will that make or break?<br />
PM: It's one of the key States.<br />
MARTIN: Well<br />
PM: Well, I mean, how can I possibly say it is the key<br />
State when, if I pick up seats in Queensland and<br />
Tasmania, that that's not key. I mean it is one of the<br />
key States, yes.<br />
MARTIN: OK. Charles Blunt predicted here in this chair<br />
an eight seat win for the coalition. How much are you<br />
going to win by?<br />
PM: I think we'll hold something like our present<br />
majority. MARTIN: Eighteen.<br />
PM: Something of that order.<br />
MARTIN: Alright, if you lose, will you quit Canberra?<br />
PM: I've said I'd put myself in the hands of the Party.<br />
I'd, if they pressed hard for me to stay, I'd have to<br />
think about it.<br />
MARTIN: If you lose and stay, would you quit the<br />
leadership? PM: Oh no, if I stayed it would only be because they<br />
wanted me to stay in the leadership.<br />
MARTIN: So if they didn't offer that, you'd<br />
PM: Well, it's not a question of offer. I mean, I won't<br />
be pressing, I won't be pressing for it. But, I mean,<br />
that's entirely hypothetical. I do believe that, I hope<br />
the audience and all the viewers there will understand<br />
I'm trying not to be cocky or complacent about it, but I<br />
think, I think that we'll win.<br />
[ Commercial break]<br />
MARTIN: Alright, the status of women. Of the one<br />
thousand plus candidates who are running in this Federal<br />
election, less than two hundred are women and most of<br />
them happen to be Independents. So, the status of women.<br />
Mrs Hawke, welcome, would you please welcome Mrs Hawke.<br />
You're always honest and frank, as your husband is, what<br />
has your old man done for the status of women in<br />
Australia? </p>
<p>MRS HAWKE: A great deal, a great deal. I've watched it<br />
with interest. Seven years is quite a long time and he<br />
hasn't been twiddling his thumbs. In respect of women<br />
there's been a great deal done. Immediately he upgraded<br />
the Office of the Status of Women by renaming it so and<br />
took it into his own Department which meant there was<br />
better access to the Prime Minister's Department for the<br />
women. The Office has been very vibrant and Affirmative<br />
Action was, of course, a very exciting thing. First, the<br />
two year pilot study, and then the enactment of the<br />
legislation MARTIN: Could we come back to I'm sorry, could we come<br />
to that point that I just made then, that only two<br />
hundred of the one thousand candidates are women. What's<br />
happened to women in representing women in politics?<br />
MRS HAWKE: Well, that's at the Federal Government level.<br />
In State politics there are more women.<br />
MARTIN: But he's the Federal Government.<br />
MRS HAWKE: Yes, but you see for women and it takes<br />
time for all this to filter through, and it's not unique<br />
to Australia, the imbalance in male and female<br />
representation MARTIN: We're one of the worst though, accordingly to<br />
today's figures we're one of the worst. I just wonder<br />
whether you, I mean, again<br />
MRS HAWKE: But let me insist..<br />
MARTIN: Go on.<br />
MRS HAWKE: that at State government level, for<br />
instance we have a Premier in Western Australia, and a<br />
beauty she is<br />
MARTIN: But I just wondered<br />
MRS HAWKE: and also, taking it back to local<br />
government, where women who are doing traditional roles<br />
and even working in career jobs too, can more easily<br />
participate in local government the percentage is<br />
higher again. So that's going to take time to filter<br />
through.<br />
MARTIN: Be honest, do you think that blokes can<br />
represent women in terms of needs and desires?<br />
MRS HAWKE: Some blokes can represent women better than<br />
others. I think they need to be good listeners, to<br />
understand and to make a distinct effort in terms of<br />
their research and outreach, and this has been done in an<br />
extraordinary way by developing the Agenda for Women by<br />
this Federal Government. It's been a taskforce which has<br />
gone out into all different areas of women's condition, </p>
<p>rural women, Aboriginal women, women in traditional<br />
roles. All of that has been thoroughly taskforce<br />
researched and<br />
MARTIN: With respect though, Mrs Hawke, that's sounds<br />
like words. I mean, it just sounds like I mean, do<br />
you think that men ladies, do you think that men can<br />
represent what you want? Or do you need women?<br />
( audience response]<br />
MARTIN: So, I know, I accept that it takes time..<br />
MRS HAWKE: if you that information, that honest<br />
inquiry into what women's needs are, as expressed by<br />
women, not as expressed by men, that's the important<br />
thing.<br />
MARTIN: Well that's but they're not there you see.<br />
We've got Ros Kelly in the Cabinet, that's the only<br />
woman. PM: [ inaudible]<br />
MRS HAWKE: But you don't have to be a women to listen to<br />
women and to understand.<br />
MARTIN: But why not have women? Fifty-one per cent of<br />
our audience, of our<br />
MRS HAWKE: [ inaudible]<br />
MARTIN: population are women.<br />
MRS HAWKE: ( inaudible]<br />
MARTIN: Bob?<br />
PM: Well, I just make the I agree with what Hazel's<br />
0saying, and I..<br />
MARTIN: I'm sure you do.<br />
PM: No, no. When I don't, I tell her.<br />
MRS HAWKE: Yes.<br />
PM: Let me say this. I think that women are capable of<br />
representing men's interests. I think that Ros Kelly,<br />
who, you mentioned her, she can represent the interests<br />
of men. But I take the view that more women ought to get<br />
into the political process.<br />
MARTIN: Where are they?<br />
PM: Well, they are coming through. There are many, many<br />
more now than there were at the beginning of the 1980s. </p>
<p>MARTIN: But there's have to be, Bob, would there,<br />
there'd have to be. Because, I mean, they are fifty-one<br />
per cent of our population<br />
PM: [ inaudible]<br />
MARTIN: but the major parties do nothing for them do<br />
they? PM: That's not right to say the major parties do<br />
nothing. We've got a lot of women in our Caucus, but I<br />
want to see more.<br />
MARTIN: How can you speak about women? In this<br />
campaign, how often have you actually said here's the<br />
vision for women at the end of the line?<br />
PM: I tell you what, I stood up in Perth and made a<br />
major speech, with Premier Carmen Lawrence standing next<br />
to me, and announced a very significant program for<br />
women. MARTIN: Alright. What do you think? If you understand<br />
women, you obviously understand this lady, what do you<br />
think is the single most important issue for Australian<br />
women? PM: I think the most important, the single most<br />
important issue for Australian women is that we change<br />
the education system to ensure that the women of the<br />
future are going to be the product of an education system<br />
that, when a girl goes into the education system, she is<br />
going to have the same opportunity of access for<br />
training, for any vocation or profession. So that we<br />
will not, in the education system, hive off women so that<br />
they're only going to into that vocation or to that<br />
vocation. That's the single most important thing we can<br />
do, to have an education system which gives equality of<br />
opportunity to women.<br />
MARTIN: Now, I haven't been on the campaign trail with<br />
you, so you may have said that, but I certainly have not<br />
read or heard or seen on television, you saying anything<br />
like that.<br />
PM: [ inaudible]<br />
MARTIN: Let me tell you what people here say, because we<br />
get two hundred a day who come in here and about sixty<br />
per cent of them are women. They don't really care about<br />
bracket creep and they don't care much about GDP, or very<br />
much about national account figures. But they talk about<br />
their families, and they talk about violence in our<br />
community. PM: Yes.<br />
MARTIN: They talk about drugs in our community. </p>
<p>PM: Yes.<br />
MARTIN: They talk about immigration in our community.<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
MARTIN: They talk about selling off the farm to<br />
Japanese. That's what they talk about, regularly.<br />
They're not racists, but that's what worries them.<br />
PM: Well, let me say this in regard to some of those<br />
features that you've talked about. They talk about their<br />
children. The single most important thing for anyone<br />
who's concerned about their children is the opportunity<br />
for education. And I think the single thing of which I'm<br />
proudest after seven years of Prime Minister is that when<br />
I came to office, only one in three of Australian kids<br />
stayed on in the education system. We had a pattern of<br />
privilege in education. Now, it's two out of three,<br />
nearly two out of three of our kids stay on in school<br />
because I've more than doubled the education allowances<br />
going to low and middle income families. That's the<br />
single most important thing that you can do for families,<br />
is to say that your kid is going to have the same<br />
opportunity of developing his or her talents in the<br />
education system. And that's what we've done.<br />
MARTIN: Mrs Hawke, those issues that I raised, obviously<br />
they're close to your family and they're close to all our<br />
families. Again, please be honest, do you think that<br />
those issues get enough attention? Such as violence in<br />
the community. I mean, it hasn't been raised in this<br />
election, but every woman and child is concerned.<br />
MRS HAWKE: They have been raised in this campaign, maybe<br />
you've missed them, but..<br />
MARTIN: I've covered it pretty closely.<br />
MRS HAWKE: not only in the campaign, there's been a<br />
great deal done. And in fact, for at least the last<br />
three to four years, I've been speaking to girls'<br />
seminars, Year 10 girls mainly, to encourage them to<br />
stay on at school and finish it and to keep science<br />
and maths subjects going so that their horizons are<br />
wLdened and their opportunities are much greater.<br />
MARTIN: Could I ask the audience please. Have you<br />
heard, in all the campaign that you've read and seen on<br />
television or on radio, have you heard any of the<br />
candidates talk about hard drugs, about violence in our<br />
community? [ audience response] </p>
<p>MARTIN: about immigration, apart from this furore<br />
that we've had in the last few days? About Japanese<br />
investment apart from the city?<br />
[ audience response]<br />
PM: Well let me go to the question of drugs. Just<br />
earlier this week I announced a new program under which<br />
we are going to ensure that the proceeds from the crimes<br />
in which people are involved in trading in drugs, that<br />
those proceeds are going to go fifty per cent of the<br />
proceeds from the conviction of people who trade in drugs<br />
fifty per cent of those proceeds are going into the law<br />
enforcement agencies to increase their financial<br />
capacity. And the other fifty per cent is going into<br />
funds to help the victims of drug usage. Now that was a<br />
specific announcement that I made at the beginning of<br />
this week, and allocated the money to do it.<br />
MARTIN: What about getting the mister bigs, what about<br />
reducing the<br />
PM: Let me say this in regard to mister bigs. When I<br />
came to office, we set up the NCA, the National Crime<br />
Authority. I was opposed at the time that I set it up by<br />
the Opposition, they said no we're against that, simply<br />
because we did it. But now, they've conceded the fact<br />
that under the operations of the National Crime Authority<br />
which I set up, there have been major busts, major busts<br />
of major crime rings in this country and it's happened<br />
because, with the National Crime Authority, I've<br />
co-ordinated their work with the work of State police<br />
authorities and we've busted.<br />
MARTIN: Well you know better than I know that politics<br />
is not and what you've said I accept as fact but you<br />
know better than I do that politics is about perception.<br />
And the perception is that drugs are rampant in our<br />
community and that nothing's been done. The perception<br />
is again, the Daily Mirror ran a poll yesterday, and they<br />
said that the silent issue in this campaign is<br />
immigration. No-one is talking immigration. The people<br />
who come in here want to talk immigration<br />
PM: Yes, well I'll talk about immigration.<br />
MARTIN: so they're not racists, but you're not<br />
PM: You say they're not racists, you say they're not<br />
racist, and I accept they're not racist. Let's talk<br />
about immigration.<br />
MARTIN: But why hasn't it been the issue, why haven't<br />
you been out there saying<br />
PM: Because, because it has a bipartisan position. The<br />
Opposition supports our immigration program. There is no<br />
issue between the Opposition and the Government on </p>
<p>immigration. No issue at all. So, if they agree with<br />
our position, why don't we get up and say, alright,<br />
there's no issue, now I'm going to pick a fight with you.<br />
MARTIN: But your own Commissioner, Stephen Fitzgerald,<br />
said in that report on immigration, said that the<br />
government, whichever government, should calm fears in<br />
Australia. There are great fears about Asians in<br />
Australia. PM: Well, you say there are great fears about. Asians in<br />
Australia, some people have apprehensions. Look, just<br />
let me give you my history. When I grew up as a kid, do<br />
you know what their fears were about? Do you who used to<br />
be the object of hatred?..<br />
MARTIN: The Italians and the Greeks probably.<br />
PM: The Greeks and the Italians. The wops, the dagoes,<br />
that was the language. And I fought against it. And<br />
then, after it was the wops and the dagoes, the Greeks<br />
and the Italians, and it required people of guts and<br />
decency to stand up for them, and I did. And now it's<br />
Asians. And you'll have Bob Hawke standing up there, in<br />
favour of them. Because all I ask of people who come to<br />
this country is one thing, and that is that they commit<br />
themselves to Australia. That they are Australians. And<br />
this country is a country of immigrants. As I look out<br />
into your audience, the fact my friend is that, right<br />
now, forty per cent of every person out there, forty per<br />
cent of all Australians are either immigrants or the son<br />
or daughter of an immigrant. We are a country of<br />
immigration. We've been built up and strengthened by the<br />
British, the Irish, the Scots, the French, the Greeks,<br />
the Italians, and now we're getting more from Vietnam,<br />
these people, and we are a stronger, better country<br />
because basically Australians are tolerant. Sure<br />
MARTIN: [ inaudible]<br />
PM: sure some of them make an..<br />
MARTIN: I'm talking about perception, it's not just some<br />
we're talking about<br />
PM: and what I'm talking about the responsibility of<br />
leadership. The responsibility of political leadership<br />
is not to succumb to the lowest common denominator. And<br />
I tell you what..<br />
MARTIN: We're not talking about that..<br />
PM: No, but what I'm saying..<br />
MARTIN: we're not talking about that at all.<br />
PM: I will talk about immigration, and when you say<br />
people are concerned about Asians and so on, I will not </p>
<p>dodge the responsibility that I have for this and future<br />
generations of Australians. If you want to do one single<br />
thing which will hurt the kids of Australia, it's this.<br />
Develop a perception in Asia that Australians are<br />
anti-Asian because, I tell you what, Asia will say OK<br />
Australia and Asia is the faster growing region of the<br />
world if Australia gets a reputation that we are<br />
anti-Asian, then we doom our kids and the next generation<br />
to third class citizenship. Because Asia will say,<br />
alright, if you think we're inferior human beings, we'll<br />
buy our wheat, our wool, our meat, our coal, our iron<br />
ore, and our bauxite from people who don't treat us as<br />
third class citizens<br />
MARTIN: I accept that, I accept that that's good logic<br />
and I certainly don't take second place to you when it<br />
comes to racism.<br />
PM: I'm sure you don't.<br />
MARTIN: All I'm saying is perceptions. And I'm<br />
saying that Australians read in the newspapers, Surfers<br />
Paradise being bought. They read in the newspapers<br />
pieces of this land being bought. Now, in the past it<br />
was or the from America or the Brits or the<br />
Germans or whatever. Now it happens to be Japanese and<br />
Chinese. PM: OK...<br />
MARTIN: That's the perception Bob<br />
PM: Yes, but<br />
MARTIN: the perception.<br />
PM: And that's what I'm saying. If you keep saying<br />
that's perception and don't give them the facts then the<br />
perception will grow. The fact is, let me give you the<br />
figures about investment<br />
MARTIN: But until mentioned Polls the other day, this<br />
wasn't even raised in this debate.<br />
PM: And why? And why? Because until he raised it, you<br />
know what the position, what the position of the<br />
Opposition was? They have spelled out, in regard to the<br />
Polls, in answer in the Sydney Morning Herald, they have<br />
said that they supported the idea. They supported it.<br />
It was a non-issue. The Liberals and the National Party<br />
fully supported the idea, as did Greiner. Then, in a<br />
miserable twist of politics, just six days before the<br />
election, having said they fully supported it, they then<br />
dashed off onto this concept of an enclave when the<br />
fundamental principle that we laid down, and which has<br />
been followed by your Will Baileys, by your John<br />
Elliotts, everyone who's been engaged in it, is that this<br />
shall be an enclave and it's not confined to Japanese. </p>
<p>We are trying to attract to Australia the best technology<br />
that we can from North America, from Japan, from Europe,<br />
so that Australians, an increasingly well educated<br />
Australian workforce, will have married to it the best<br />
technology from overseas. So that my kids, and your<br />
kids, and their grandchildren are going to have a well<br />
equipped Australian industry which is going to be able to<br />
compete in the world. And that was the position of the<br />
Opposition, that was the position of the Opposition until<br />
a week before the election.<br />
MARTIN: You don't think, I mean we're almost out of time<br />
and I just want to get a couple of quick questions in<br />
with Hazel anyway. But I mean you don't think that that<br />
poll that came in last night, the Morgan poii, that<br />
showed, that indicated that the Libs were in front, the<br />
Liberal Party is in front of you<br />
PM: That shows that we would win the election.<br />
MARTIN: but the result of the Polis debate, this<br />
debate PM: That showed that we would win the election.<br />
MARTIN: Alright. Hazel, can I ask you, we've seen Mr<br />
Peacock campaigning with his daughters and we've<br />
certainly seen a lot of you campaigning in this one. Do<br />
you, you don't feel you're being used as a political tool<br />
in this, or are you enjoying it?<br />
MRS HAWKE: I'm enjoying it very much and I don't feel<br />
now, and I never have, felt that I've been manipulated or<br />
used as a political tool. It would be a denial of my<br />
human rights and my individuality if I weren't able to<br />
take part as I want to and as I see fit. And I just<br />
MARTIN: What do you think you add?<br />
MRS HAWKE: Pardon?<br />
MARTIN: What do you think you add to the campaign?<br />
MRS HAWKE: Well I don't claim to add anything, I'm doing<br />
what I<br />
MARTIN: What are you doing then?<br />
MRS HAWKE: Pardon?<br />
MARTIN: What are you doing?<br />
MRS HAWKE: Well I'm taking part as just in, as part of a<br />
team. I'm not a politician and I don't talk policy or<br />
politics. But I am part of a general team. You see,<br />
there's only a few players in this election who are<br />
actually politicians. There are staff and advisers and </p>
<p>people who, one way or another, help because they've got<br />
a commitment<br />
MARTIN: And about<br />
MRS HAWKE: and I've got a commitment too.<br />
MARTIN: And about ten million voters as well. Now<br />
listen, if this bloke was to lose, and there's a headline<br />
in today's paper here saying my Bob could handle defeat,<br />
the front page of the paper. But if he was to lose,<br />
could you put up with him at home?<br />
MRS HAWKE: Absolutely. Anyway, he wouldn't sit at home<br />
twiddling his thumbs I can guarantee. He's got too much<br />
energy. MARTIN: Alright, we thank you both and we wish you both<br />
well. PM: Thank you.<br />
MARTIN: Thank you Hazel, thank you Bob Hawke.<br />
