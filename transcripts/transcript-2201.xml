MIS<br />
PRESS, RADIO AND TV CONFE~ RENCE GIVEN BY<br />
THE PRIME MINISTER, MR JOHN GORTON, AT<br />
PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA, A. C. T. March 1970<br />
PRIME MINISTER Well, gentlemen of the Press, I understand you<br />
have a predilection for press conferences and now for the next thirty<br />
minutes I am in your hands while we have one.<br />
Q. David Solomon from the " Australian". In Sydney<br />
today the Federal Treasurer described the way the economy was shaping<br />
as sufficiently menacing to be taken very seriously. Last Thursday,<br />
you said that in raising interest rates the Government had already taken<br />
the action necessary to control the economy. Do you still believe that<br />
no further Government action will be necessary?<br />
PM: I don't think you are quite accurate in saying what<br />
I said last Thursday. I think this was in answer to a Question in the<br />
House, if I remember correctly. You will remember that in the<br />
Governor-General's Speech, I said that the economy had been, over the<br />
past, kept well under control " reasonably under cont rol" I think were<br />
the words, but that it needed constant and close attention, and that this<br />
raising of interest rates was one of the methods indicating that it was<br />
getting close attention. The speech made by the Treasurer today<br />
pointed out, as you will know if you read it, a number of the indices<br />
which indicate a possibility of too much pressure. It also had in it,<br />
as you will have read, that there were countervailing factors, that<br />
there was grcing to be much less liquidity in the next three months of<br />
this year and that he described the position as, I think the word was<br />
" ambiguous" not completely clear which way it would go. This, I<br />
think, is where the position is at the moment.<br />
Q. John Commins, ABC. In short, is the Government<br />
conteamplating s supplementary Budget?<br />
PM: No.<br />
Alan Barnes, Melbourne Age. Prime Minister,<br />
Mr. Bury in his speech referred to the effect of public sector spending<br />
as being one of those major pressures. Do you intend to take this into<br />
account when framing your Budget and your spending for the rest of<br />
the year? / 2 </p>
<p>PM: Mr Barnes, we always take into account the question<br />
of public spending, of public requirement, of expenditures on education,<br />
on grants to the States, all these matters are taken into consideration<br />
along with the prognostication of the likely private demand and the<br />
Budget is framed accordingly. I am sure you wouldn't expect me to give<br />
any indications of how it would be framed at this stage, except that we<br />
believe it will be framed in a way that will see that inflation does not<br />
occur.<br />
Q. Frank Chamberlain, AFP and Macquarie. Mr<br />
Prime Minister, could you elaborate on what Mr Bury has said about<br />
the economy? Would you use the kind of words he uses as " menacing"<br />
and, further, would you associate this with the rural march in<br />
Melbourne earlier this week?<br />
PM: No, I wouldn't associate it with the rural march in<br />
Melbourne because Mr Bury indicated, right at the beginning of his<br />
speech, that the economy had been progressing well and there had been<br />
growth and prosperity in all sectionij, except for the rural section.<br />
He made that clear in the speech when he gave it. And I don't think<br />
I can elaborate very much on what he said. He pointed to the indices<br />
which are now appearing. Ther'e is a very tight labour market. Thero<br />
is housing construction running at record rates. There is a number<br />
of indices which I would not describe, myself, as menacing, but as<br />
potentially menacing, but they have to be set up against the effects of<br />
the domestic surplus for which we budgeted this year and for the<br />
declining liquidity which is going to take place for the next three months<br />
of this year at least so I am informed by the Reserve Bank and the<br />
Treasury.<br />
Q. You knew that the speech was to be made, did you?<br />
PM: Oh, yes. I read it.<br />
Q. Mr Prime Minister, on the rural march in Melbourne.<br />
Mr. Malcolm Fraser was reported as saying that he advocated compulsory<br />
acquisition of the wool clip as the only satisfactory method of running<br />
the wool industry. Is this Government policy, or is it your view on it?<br />
PM: Well, according to NU Malcolmn Fraser, it is not<br />
even an accurate report. / 3 </p>
<p>Q. Peter Samuel, Bulletin. Mr. Gorton on wool,<br />
could you give us an indication of your attitude towards the proposal<br />
for a subsidy for wool.<br />
PM: Yes, Mr S muel. I don't believe that a subsidy<br />
for wool can be any long-term solution for the problems the wool industry<br />
faces. There is a lot of things which could be done to help wool, such<br />
things as core testing and sample selling and the wool villages of which<br />
you have heard, and trying to cut down the number of times the wool<br />
is handled. All of these things can save a certain amount per bale.<br />
I doubt whether they would save more, in aggregate, than perhaps<br />
6 cents a pound, maybe a little bit more. I am not setting anything<br />
definite. But that is not going to be sufficient to be a real solution to it.<br />
I think we need, and I believe Gunn's Committee set up is exam ining<br />
into these aspects we need to know just what is, the grade of wool<br />
which is bringing us the greatest amount afe overseas exchange, just<br />
what is most in demand, and in the long run a subsidy, I believe, mould<br />
not meet the needs of the wool industry, it is a palliative rather than<br />
a solution. Q. Rob Chalmers, Chani-, el C. Prime Minister, mh ile<br />
on the rural question, last month, the Leader of the Country Party said<br />
in a public statement that the position of primary industry was so serious<br />
in economic terms that the Country Party had resolved to apply a new<br />
measure of determination and boldness in followiing measures of<br />
support in the coming Session of Parliament,..~<br />
PM: This was a statement by whom?<br />
Q. By the Country Party Leader, Sir?<br />
PM: Oh, yes.<br />
Q. Have you yet seen in Cabinet any of these new<br />
measures of support in this Session?<br />
PM: Do you think I could just continue with the question<br />
that you asked, because it might, hanging in the air, leave a slightly<br />
inappropriate situation. 1 think you will remember that the Leader of<br />
the Country Party made it clear that this was not an indication that the<br />
Liberal Party was in any way hanging back, and th-at Liberal Party<br />
Members representing rural seats were also disturbed, and we / 4 </p>
<p>were all disturbed about it, and I think that is where the situation rests.<br />
There has been, I think, a significant attack on the wheat problem. A3<br />
you know, quotas were introduced, and quotas are going to be considerably<br />
less next year than they are this year. They are going to be<br />
per cent less and this has been recommended by the wheat people, and<br />
this is very responsible. And I am sure we will -progress to a situation<br />
A 0 which one wishes to arrive at. The Dairy &amp; i ae Scheme is still<br />
running into difficulties with the States, but in the last two days, I have<br />
reason to believe that those difficulties might begin to be resolved<br />
quite quickly, but I can't say because it is not entirely within my decision.<br />
The rural industry which you have mentioned is, in my view, in a<br />
very horrible situation. I have known what it is vhen I was on the land<br />
in the early days to sit waiting for the telephone to ring and not ' Know<br />
whether it would be somebody saying, " You owe me for the fertiliser!<br />
you bought to put on the orchard. Why don't you pay it?" " You owe<br />
me for the spray, why don't you pay it?" Or perhiaps it was the bank<br />
manager saying, " You have gone over your limit"', and you were<br />
struggling to put enough into your land to 7produce the next crop, hoping<br />
the next crop would pay offf. I know what this is, and this is a great<br />
social problem for the -woolgrower today not all woolgrowers, but<br />
far too many of them, and the solution to it is not easy to see; but<br />
certainly matters of handling, and quite probably matters of selling<br />
methods of selling could be the solutions. At the moment we are<br />
waiting for some indication from a quite significant Committee vh ich<br />
has been set up by Sir William Gunn, and we are all discussing it in<br />
Cabinet quite " seriously" is not a strong enough word but<br />
attempting to decide what we can see as the best solution for this.<br />
Q. Laurie Oakes, Melbourne Sun : Prime Mnister<br />
on Vietnam. You said in December that the Australian Government<br />
wanted some Australian troops phased into the next major US withdrawal.<br />
Are you in a position to say, Sir, how far plannin~ g for withdrawal has<br />
progress in the last four months2 Can you tell us how many troops<br />
are likely to come home and when, and can you also give us some idea<br />
of the relevance of Mr Fraser's trip to Vietnam next week with regard<br />
to withdrawal?<br />
PM: Well, this trip would be a part of the discussions<br />
that have been going on. I don't believe that I could go any further than<br />
than other than to say that our position has -not changed, indeed it wasn't<br />
only last December it was in the Governor-General's speech, and I<br />
think in a Question in the House since then, that the position has been<br />
made clear that if it is regarded the situation enables a significant / s </p>
<p>further withdrawal of Anrcit roops, then we will expect some<br />
Australian troops to be phased into that withdrawal. Now, the discussions<br />
have been going on about this. Mr Fraser's trio will have sonething to<br />
do with it, but I don't believe I should go any further than that at the<br />
moment.<br />
Q. Hugh Armfield, Melbourne A-. ge Was the New<br />
Zealand Defence M-nister, Mr Thompson correct when he said here<br />
recently that the South Vietnamese were ready and willing to take over<br />
from Australian and New ZEealand Forces in Phuoc Tuy?<br />
PM: I haven't seen anything to substantiate that. If the<br />
suggestion is that the South Vietnamese are ready and eager and willing<br />
to take over all the activities in Phuoc Tuy Provi-nce, I have seen nothing<br />
to substantiate that.<br />
Q. Cameron Foro'es, Newsday Prime Minister, does the<br />
Australian Government view with any disquiet such actions by the Saigon<br />
Government as arose in the case of the gaoling of the representative<br />
Chou and the disquiet this evidently caused in sorne sections of the<br />
Vietnamese population?<br />
PM: I wouldn't want to interfere or to express opinions on<br />
the actions of another government which, after a'il, I would remind you, is<br />
an elected government, and one vi ich has been elected under probably the<br />
most difficult conditions that any government has had to face during an<br />
election. Let us not forget that this government is in a coun try which is<br />
in the throes of war, and before we place too much emphasis on the<br />
sort of thing you have mentioned, let us remember that England in the<br />
last war when it was in the throes of war -Aound it necessary Mr Churchill<br />
found it necessary to put into gaol somebody who either was or had been<br />
a Member of the Parliament.<br />
Q. Max Grant, Melbourne Herald and 3DB Mr Prime<br />
MInister, there has been some speculation about the provision of the<br />
Nimmo Committee Report which suggests that doctors may be excluded<br />
if they don't co-operate with the common fee scheme. Would you like<br />
to say how you feel about that at this stage?"<br />
PM: The suggestion in the N-Immo Committee Report was<br />
for a participating doctor scheme and all it recommended was that it<br />
would wish doctors to hang up in their consultiing-rooms placards, as it<br />
were, saying " This is what I charge This is the ccmmon fee. / 6 </p>
<p>and that only those doctors who did that should be participating in the<br />
scheme and that patients who went to doctors who did not do that mould<br />
not have their bills paid. We have decided not to accept this recommendation,<br />
and I think that is all I can say on that at the moment.<br />
Q. Would you reconsider that one day, Mr Gorton, if the<br />
scheme were running into difficulties?<br />
PM: I have strong hopes that the scheme will not run into<br />
trouble, but clearly all things can change,. and at the monment we have not<br />
adopted that.<br />
Q. Alan Barnes. I understand Dr Forbes reported to<br />
Cabinet yesterday on this matter. Can you tell us how you are going to<br />
make the health scheme work when doctors in three States repudiated<br />
the AMA leaders on whose advice you based the scllaeme?<br />
PM: I You tell me how you understand that Dr Forbes reported<br />
to Cabinet on this matter? He made no statements about it.<br />
A. I read it in the papers, Sir:<br />
PM: You asked me whether I thoughit the scheme mo uld wourk<br />
if what you described as " doctors were against it". I think it should be<br />
made clear that there are divisions in the medical profession. To the<br />
best of my knowledge, I don't know of specialists who are opposed to<br />
the scheme which we propose. There have been suggestions that general<br />
practitioners are opposed to it. I don't believe that general practitioners<br />
would refuse to treat patients. I don't believe that general practitio * ners<br />
would refuse to take such action as wo uld enable their patients to be<br />
reimbursed by the Government and the Fu-nds for tae treatment the<br />
general practitioners give them, I think that the greneral practitioners.<br />
will find that their fears are unfounded and I hope and believe that the<br />
scheme will work. You know what the problem is here. There is only<br />
one real area of disagreement. We want to introduce a scheme which<br />
will protect the patient against the higher charges that a specialist<br />
now makes. At the moment he is not protected. 1i order to do that it<br />
will be necessary to give, from the insurance funds and from the<br />
Government, more reimbursement to a patieint who goes. to a specialist<br />
than is given to a patient who goes to a general practitioner. This protects<br />
the patient. This ensures that there is no economic bar to a patient who<br />
needs to get specialist attention and this is whiat wie want to get, but the<br />
general practitioners are fearful that this will 1 end to all sorts of people<br />
who don't really need specialist treatment. This is their fear. It is<br />
just a fear. We don't think it will happen, but if it did happen, we mould / 7 </p>
<p>be just as interested in Beeking to stop it from a Government point of<br />
view as they are, because our objective is to see thiat those who need<br />
it get it, not those who don't need it. That should be able to be worked<br />
out.<br />
Q. What is the Government's timetable, Sir? on<br />
legislation on introduction of the scheme?<br />
P M; We should be introducing this scheme very soon<br />
after the next sitting of Par-liament, that is, whe. 2 wie meet after April 7,<br />
Q. Arising from Cabinet, are there any compromises,<br />
any watering-down of the Government's proposals71<br />
PM; No, we haven't got any, but it is a scheme which we<br />
have indicated, If it is shown that there are anomnalies in the scheme after<br />
it is introduced or when it is in operation, then oZ course we would be<br />
prepared to look at them and seek to overcome them, but not to the extent<br />
of abrogating our main objective which is to protect the patient against<br />
specialist charges.<br />
Q. Laurie Cakes : On the same subject, Prime Mlnistpr,<br />
have you yet chosen the membership of the National Health Insurance<br />
Commission?<br />
PM:' No, not yet, Mr Cakes.<br />
W~ dlace Brown, Courier Mail Prime Minister,<br />
when do you hope to work out the aspects of the , Iimmo recommendations<br />
that require State co-operation. In particular, what do you think of the<br />
particular Nimmo recommendation that says the Commonwealth should<br />
pay the full $ 2 a day benefit in respect of public ward patients in<br />
Queensland, instead of the 60 cents it pays at the moment for uninsured<br />
patients?<br />
PM: Well, I think that these matters, being the subject<br />
of discussion between Dr Forbes the Minister for Health and our Govern<br />
ment and the State Governments, and being in the course of discussion<br />
between them, are not ones that I should express opinions on at this<br />
time. But I hope that they will be worked out. inaeed, it is<br />
necessary that they should be worked out. e / 8 </p>
<p>Q. Max Hawkins, Brisbane Telegraph Mr Fraser<br />
is making a trip not only to Saigon, but to Washington to talk about the<br />
Fill1 plane and its problems. How soon after he returns do you expect<br />
the Government will be able to announce a firm decision whether we get<br />
it, cancel it or want to take another plane?<br />
PM; 1 would expect that soon after he returned we would<br />
be in a position where we could start looking to see whether there were'<br />
alternate planes that were available. I wouldn't like to give you a specific<br />
answer to your question of how soon after his return would it be<br />
possible to make a really final decision because there have been so many<br />
changes in rogard to the F IlIl coming unexpectedly. everything seemed<br />
to be all right and then it turns out that it is not all right, that it might<br />
be chancing my arm a bit to say, " Well, in a week or a fortnight" or<br />
something of that kind, but you can be quite sure that we mould be seek~ ng<br />
to do it as soon as we possibly could on our judgment of the facts as<br />
presented. Q. Peter Samuel of the Bulletin again During the election<br />
campaign you said, I think, that you were very strongly against the Russians<br />
getting a naval base in the Indian Ocean area. There have been reports<br />
that Singapore is offering its naval base facilities to the Russians. I<br />
wouder if you could tell us what the attitude of your Government is to that?<br />
PM: Well, I don't believe that we could by force majeure<br />
stop it but we would not like to see it, and would express our opinions<br />
that we would not wish to see it. I don't thinkc you could go any furt..-<br />
than that.<br />
Q. Have you done that alreadyr<br />
PM: Oh, I think if you read the statement of the Minister<br />
for Defence, and the Minister for External Affairs, you will see a pretty<br />
clear indication that we don't wish to see a military presence of that<br />
kind by the Russians in this area.<br />
Q. Have you made any move to speak to Singapore about<br />
it? The Singapore Government?<br />
PM: I haven't spoken to Singapore about it. I doubt<br />
whether it has reached a situation where it would be necessary to do that.<br />
/ 9 </p>
<p>Q. Alan Reid Sir, reverting to wool. Whether Mr Fraser<br />
was reported accurately or inaccurately, have you or your Government formed.<br />
any opinion on the desirability or otherwise of a Wiool Acquisition Scheme,<br />
and if so, what are these views?<br />
PM: Well, I think I told you Mr Reid, that there was a<br />
Committee looking into the question, a whole number of questions in<br />
relation to wool. I wouldn't say that we had form-ed a view for an<br />
acquisition shceme. An acquistion scheme, a variation of the present<br />
method of selling, a temporary subsidy, a whole variety of possible<br />
courses is open, and I can't go any further than that at this stage.<br />
Q. Sir, on the question about Singapore, did you, as<br />
some commentators did, read implications in the statement of the<br />
Minister for External Affairs regarding his desire to see Britain return<br />
or remain in the area? W~ as there any implication in this that in the<br />
long term we would need them to be there before we stayed in the<br />
long term?<br />
PM: No, I didn't read that into it at all. I just read into<br />
it a plain statement that it would be a lot better anad a lot more militarily<br />
acceptable to us if they stayed than it would be if they left. This is in<br />
fact what we have been saying from the start, but they seemed to have<br />
made their minds up, unless of course there is a change of government<br />
in Britain.<br />
Q. Have you any official news you can give us, Sir,<br />
about the situation in Cambodia and South-East Asia's unrest in general?<br />
PM: I don't think I can give you anything more than I have<br />
read in the newspapers. I have had a report today from External Affairs<br />
on it, but the situation seems to be that the Government there is now<br />
describing itself as a Gi rnbodian Government, instead of the Royal<br />
Cambodian Government just what that means you can read into it<br />
what you wish and they are indicating they wqish the Vietcong and the<br />
North Vietnamese to leave their country. They horpe to be able to<br />
do this by negotiation, by discussion. Well, whether they will be able<br />
to do it by negotiation or discussion or not, time w~ ill show. But of<br />
cou rse one of the difficulties in these situations L-that the North<br />
Vietnamese always refuse to admit that they are there in the first place<br />
and therefore don't feel they can discuss getting out. </p>
<p>Q_ Bob Baudino, Sydney D-: ly Telegraph Sir, could I<br />
take you back to Mr Bury's speech. You have mnentioned that you did read<br />
the speech. Could I ask you did you read it before or after the event?<br />
PM: I read it before the event.<br />
Q. Fred Brenchley, Newsday j-t the declaration of the<br />
poll, last November in your electorate of Higgins, you said that in view<br />
of the Government's losses in the election, its policies had to be reviewed.<br />
I would like to ask you if this review has now been completed, and do we see<br />
the results of it in the Governor -General's Speech to Parliament or is there<br />
more to come? In other words, should we have more policy initiatives like<br />
the Industry Development Corporation?<br />
PM: I believe that you have a Government which will never<br />
run out of policy initiatives or new forward-looking, steps forward-looking<br />
eyes and advancing steps. You have certainly seen some of the actions<br />
which we foreshadowed at the time.<br />
Q. Tom McNeil, Australian Associated Press In your<br />
Policy Speech you said the Government's aim was to reduce the burden<br />
of income tax on the lower and middle inconne ear-ners. In the light of<br />
the economy situation at the moment, is this aim still capable of achievement?<br />
Is it still your Government' s aim to do this, starting from this<br />
next Budget?<br />
PM: In my Policy Speech, I said that we would aim during<br />
the life of this Parliament to reduce the burden of income tax on lower and<br />
middle income earners so that at the end of three years they would be<br />
paying a given sum I think $ 200 million or words to that effect less than<br />
they would normally be paying. This is still our aim, and this is an<br />
aim we will attain. I don't propose to go any further than that.<br />
Q. Warren Duncan, ABC: Getting back to Cambodia.<br />
Prince Sihanouk is reported to be trying to form his own private army<br />
to try and get himself back.-to power. What wou. ld our attitude be towards<br />
the Prince in this move?<br />
PM Our attitude toward the Prince in that move?<br />
Q. Yes, in his forming a private army?<br />
PM: I should think that we would quite properly leave it<br />
to the Cambodians to decide. / 11 </p>
<p>Q. Have we any Australians there at all, apart from<br />
diplomats?<br />
PM: Absolutely none that k-now of.<br />
Q. Mr Prime Minister, followin-g up the question on the<br />
income tax distribution, I know it is not the policy of the Government to<br />
reveal what is coming up in the Budget, but bearing in mind that it was the<br />
subject of your Policy Speech, could you tell us at least if you have in<br />
mind to do something about it in this coming Budget?<br />
PM: What we have in mind to do, Mr Willesee is to carry<br />
out the intention which was expressed in the Pciicy Szch.<br />
Q. In this Budget?<br />
PM: W-hat we have in mind to do is to carry out the intention<br />
expressed in the Policy Speech.<br />
Q. Gould I ask you specifically if you intend to do anythiing<br />
about it in this Budget?<br />
PM: I heard you ask that but I am sure you didn't expect an<br />
answer.<br />
Q. The Governor-General's speech, though, did contain<br />
a suggestion that you would start action in the current Budget, in the next<br />
Budget. Will that be changed?<br />
PM: I don't know which part of the Governor-General's Speech<br />
you are specifically talking about, Mr Solominon, but I am not going to answer<br />
questions as to what is going to be in the next Budget.<br />
Mr. Eggleton: I think we have time for-just one more question.<br />
Q. A related subject, Sir, Some of the economists tell<br />
us that the present t roubles in the economy date baick to your rather<br />
generous Budget last time, and they forecast further problems in your<br />
election promises and the promises you made to the State Premiers. In<br />
view of the economic situation, or perhaps if it gets worse, would you<br />
be prepared to delay some of your promises to ease the economic situation? / 12 </p>
<p>12.<br />
PM: I think it is a very interesting question because I<br />
remember at the time some of the economists writing quite strongly about<br />
the terrifically inflationary Budget when it was brought in " economic<br />
vandalism" I think was a headline I remember. Then about a month<br />
or so ago I remember the same economists writing how wrong they had<br />
been and how I think the quotation was " Gortoa' s got the laugh on us."<br />
I believe and I have reasons not of my own but from the economists<br />
who have the responsibility in the Reserve Bank of Australia and in the<br />
Treasury that in spite of the indices which are now appearing for the<br />
rest of this financial year the fears that the economists showed at first,<br />
and damped down at second, will not be realised. Now the second part<br />
of your question was Would we, should inflation appear more likely,<br />
seek to do something about it in the coming Budget, and the only answer<br />
I can give you is tLat. the Government would in the future, as it has in<br />
the past, have as one of its main objectives the balanced growth of the<br />
economy and the avoidance of significant inflation.<br />
Q. Do you think, Mr Prime Minister that the Treasurer<br />
is crying wolf rather too strongly?<br />
PM: I think what the Treasurer is doing is drawing atteriion<br />
to potentialities and to possibilities, and I thinkc he is right to point that<br />
out.<br />
Mr. Eggleton MTr. h angkgl eyoonu: gentlemen and thank you Prime Minister. </p>
