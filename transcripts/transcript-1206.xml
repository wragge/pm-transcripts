NATIONTAL LIBRARY<br />
PRESENTATION OF-DEAKIN PAPERS<br />
Papers of critical importance to the record of Australian history were<br />
received today by the Prime Minister for the National Library in Canberra.<br />
They are the personal papers and records of Alfred Deakin, one of the major<br />
figures in the Federation Movement, three times Prime Minister and the<br />
dominating personality of the early Commonwealth.<br />
They were presented by Deakints eldest daughter, Mrs, Ivy Brookes who,<br />
along with her husband, the late Herbert Brookes,, -roserved and added to them.<br />
Deakin's other daughters, Lady Rivett and Lady White also took part in the<br />
ceremony. The mass of papers, filling 20 large cartons, cover in great detail<br />
political developments from Deakin's entry into Victorian politics in 1879<br />
to his retirement from the Commonwealth Parliament in 1913.<br />
Correspondence between Deakin and many of the prominent figures of his<br />
day is there; so are his private diaries and note books on issues and<br />
personalities of the day.<br />
Trained in the law and a practising journalist, Deakin was something of<br />
a compulsive writer who possessed as well the ability to describe events and<br />
people with a stark clarity.<br />
Despite the tempo of the events in which he was involved he was able to<br />
set down, also in manuscript, the text of a number of books. These included<br />
his brilliant Federal Story, published after his death and republished in<br />
1963. He also found time to contribute regularly to the Morning Post in England<br />
over a considerable number of years a surprisingly impartial account,<br />
preserved in the papers, of Australian politics includina those events in which<br />
he was a principal.<br />
The great value of the papers is that the extent of them is allied with<br />
a detailed record which he alone could provide to clarify many apparent<br />
mysteries of the political events of his period. They formed the basis of<br />
the recently published biography of Deakin by Professor La Nauze and will<br />
interest scholars for all time.<br />
