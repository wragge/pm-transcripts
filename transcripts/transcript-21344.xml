<p> Prime Minister ... Australian troops [inaudible]...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well very much so, it's a reminder that they're doing dangerous, very important work. We admire their bravery and their professionalism and think of them very much. It just brings home to us that this is not a picnic - it's very hard and it's very dangerous and they're very brave.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Do you ever get concerned that people see that kind of attack, those type of pictures and would use that as ammunition to say - hey let's get these guys out?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think people will see that this is a serious moment in Iraq's history, that if terrorists win now it's a huge setback for all of us in the Middle East. It's a big win for the terrorists and a real body blow for the prospects of democracy in the Middle East.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>As you say, seeing that confrontation come so close to the Australians it really does ram home the dangers - are you quite happy with all the logistical support and all the hardware that our troops do have over there at moment.... considering the stress.....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I am, they are very well trained. They are superbly trained but like all soldiers, they put their bodies and their lives on the line and when they go on duty and that's why we should support them and admire them and compliment them for their bravery and professionalism.</p>
