SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE UNITED NATIONS<br />
AUSTRALIA AND A WORLD WITHOUT NUCLEAR WEAPONS<br />
PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA, 24 OCTOBER 1995<br />
Thank you for coming today to this commemoration of the 50th anniversary of<br />
the signing of the Charter of the United Nations.<br />
I want to give particular thanks to the members of Australia's National<br />
Committee for the 50th Anniversary and to its co-chairs, Gareth Evans and<br />
Roger Shipton.<br />
The Committee encouraged debate about how the United Nations should<br />
respond to the challenges of the next century. It has played a great role as a<br />
catalyst, encouraging a very wide range of organisations to create their own<br />
anniversary activities. And in a particularly appropriate focus, it has<br />
encouraged the involvement of youth in these discussions. We have a vivid<br />
illustration of that in the postcards from primary schools all over the country<br />
which are displayed around the room.<br />
As we have seen again over the past few days, this 50th anniversary has<br />
already generated another round of critical debate about the role and<br />
functions of the United Nations. Practically everyone, it seems, has a view of<br />
how the UN could operate more effectively, or cost less, or do more, or do<br />
less.<br />
This is no bad thing when an organisation matters as much as the United<br />
Nations does. I've done it myself. And no doubt I will do it again. But not<br />
today. Or not much, anyway.<br />
Because on its 50th birthday the UIN is entitled to a bit of a celebration, a<br />
reminder to us all of what it has done in that half century to build a more<br />
humane, enlightened, tolerant and secure world.<br />
And Australians, especially, should join in the celebrations. Because through<br />
all the ups and downs of those fifty years, the UN has had few better friends<br />
than this country.<br />
When the Secretary General, Dr Boutros Boutros-Ghali, visited Australia in<br />
April to take part in our conference on global cultural diversity he said to me </p>
<p>that he judged countries not so much by their size and GDP as by their ideas<br />
and commitment.<br />
In financial terms, Australia is the thirteenth largest contributor to the United<br />
Nations. We pay our dues on time and in full. But I think that by the<br />
Secretary General's measure we have been even more important to the<br />
organisati on.<br />
We were there at the beginning of course.<br />
Dr Herbert Vere Evatt, was instrumental in drawing up the Charter. He<br />
battled long and hard to ensure that the voice of the smaller nations would be<br />
heard in its deliberations.<br />
And the great feminist pioneer Jessie Street, the only woman in the<br />
Australian delegation to the 1945 San Francisco Conference, helped to<br />
secure in the preamble to the Charter a reference to equality between men<br />
and women the only human right explicitly so mentioned.<br />
Fifty years on, most of you in this room are here because in one way or<br />
another you have been carrying on the work of those Australian pioneers.<br />
And many other Australians have been there before you.<br />
Australians were the first peacekeepers to serve under United Nations<br />
auspices when we sent military observers to Indonesia in 1947 during the<br />
independence struggle. Since then, Australian military and police personnel<br />
have served with great courage and distinction in Europe, Asia, Africa, the<br />
Middle East and the Caribbean.<br />
Australians have a distinguished record as aid workers, as diplomats working<br />
on disarmament, as health experts dealing with smallpox or AIDS.<br />
The Australian government and ordinary Australians have been able to<br />
contribute, including through one of the world's largest humanitarian<br />
resettlement programs, to the wonderful work of the United Nations High Commissioner for<br />
Refugees, in providing help and sanctuary to the millions of people who have<br />
been forced from their homes by conflict and disaster over the past fifty<br />
years. Australians have played a prominent role in the system of human rights<br />
protection created under the UN's auspices. Eminent Australians, including<br />
people such as Phillip Alston and Elizabeth Evatt, have served in their<br />
personal capacity on the expert committees which monitor implementation of<br />
the core human rights treaties.<br />
Part of the reason for holding this reception today is publicly to thank all of<br />
you and your predecessors for your service to the interests of this country<br />
and the international community through the United Nations. </p>
<p>But another reason for this gathering today is to thank the United Nations for<br />
what it has done for Australia.<br />
Because the United Nations has given us a forum where nations can resolve<br />
differences in an environment bounded by agreed rules and norms. It has<br />
provided a space in which the challenges facing humanity can be discussed<br />
and our experiences shared.<br />
For all its faults and imperfections, it is impossible to imagine a world without<br />
it without international forums for the discussion of human rights, setting<br />
universal standards, and developing measures to prevent human rights<br />
abuse. A world without bodies to address issues like the status of women<br />
and racial discrimination or to give voice to the aspirations of indigenous<br />
peoples.<br />
A world without the capacity to negotiate the pressing trans-national<br />
challenges of the environment or to tackle the most difficult problems of<br />
economic development.<br />
But in addition to these large issues the United Nations also affects for the<br />
better the lives of ordinary Australians through the web of international<br />
agreements which have been negotiated under its auspices. These cover<br />
issues as diverse as weather monitoring and prediction through the World<br />
Meteorological Organisation; improved labour standards and protection of<br />
workers' rights through the International Labor Organisation; safety standards<br />
in civil aviation and maritime transport; the placement of satellites and even<br />
the transfer of mail between countries.<br />
But for all the good work which the UN does in such areas, its ultimate<br />
success or failure will have to be judged by the impact it has on international<br />
security. Because above all else, the people who drafted the Charter 50 years ago,<br />
who had just experienced a global conflict the most destructive in all of<br />
human history were motivated by the desire to rid the world of the scourge<br />
of war. But their hopes were almost immediately crushed with the coming of<br />
the cold war. For the first time, the international community had to<br />
contemplate the possibility that another world war would destroy our<br />
civilisation.<br />
The UN system has a great responsibility to help the world avoid such a<br />
catastrophe. The disarmament goals of the international community are set<br />
in resolutions adopted by the General Assembly.<br />
The vital international treaties to turn these goals into reality are negotiated in<br />
the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva. And the ultimate recourse for<br />
enforcing compliance with international disarmament obligations lies with the<br />
UN Security Council, as we have seen in the Council's actions on Iraq and<br />
North Korea. </p>
<p>This central role of the United Nations makes today's occasion an appropriate<br />
one to make a major announcement about Australia's arms control and<br />
disarmament policy.<br />
In all the debate and anger over the past months about the French<br />
Government's decision to resume nuclear testing in the South Pacific, there is<br />
one point which consistently recurs in our thinking about the issue.<br />
I have made that point publicly. It is that, however strong our opposition to<br />
them, those tests at Mururoa, and China's continued testing, are not<br />
themselves the core of the problem. They are instead a symptom of the<br />
problem the deeper and more troubling problem of nuclear weapons in the<br />
world. The reason we have seen such a huge outpouring of public concern about<br />
the French tests, not only in this region where they are being held, but also in<br />
Europe and Japan and elsewhere, has been a feeling that we have been<br />
cheated robbed of the chance of a world free of nuclear weapons.<br />
With the end of the cold war, we all breathed more easily. We allowed<br />
ourselves to think that the nuclear threat, the nightmare of two generations,<br />
had finally passed. The thought of nuclear weapons and nuclear war faded<br />
from our minds.<br />
But the reality has not faded. Fifty thousand nuclear war heads remain in the<br />
arsenals of the five declared nuclear powers. And it is no less real and<br />
frightening that others not just the so-called threshold states of India,<br />
Pakistan and Israel, but others like Iraq wait and work to acquire nuclear<br />
weapons. The French decision to resume testing announced within weeks of the<br />
indefinite renewal of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty was an outrage<br />
and a folly. It has produced an entirely understandable wave of anger around<br />
the world. But we may yet be able to derive something positive from it<br />
because it has jolted us back to the reality of nuclear weapons in the world.<br />
I now feel a growing certainty that some great good might yet be got out of<br />
the present bitterness if we make this the moment to take on the challenge of<br />
nuclear weapons.<br />
I believe we can turn the global outrage at French and Chinese testing into<br />
something broader and more ambitious I mean the creation of a world totally<br />
free of nuclear weapons.<br />
This has often been talked about in the past, of course. It is a goal which has<br />
been forcefully articulated by Professor Joseph Rotblat, who won this year's<br />
Nobel Peace Prize. It has long been an aim of Australian policy.<br />
However, to most people, including me, it has always seemed an<br />
unachievable ambition, at least in our own lifetimes. </p>
<p>The strategic uncertainties and deep political suspicions of the cold war<br />
would surely have made this goal impossible.<br />
But that world has now changed.<br />
We still have conflict, of course. We still have competing national interests.<br />
But the strategic framework in which nations operate has changed profoundly<br />
and I believe it is now possible to contemplate getting a concrete program to<br />
achieve a nuclear weapons free world.<br />
Because the truth is that the sort of world we now have, with nuclear powers<br />
committed to reducing their arsenals and unlikely to use their weapons<br />
offensively, will not continue forever. We can be certain of this.<br />
Unless we take action now, the nuclear competition that characterised most<br />
of the second half of this century will very likely return and probably in a<br />
much more unstable and multipolar form.<br />
The world must extricate itself from the circular argument that we need<br />
nuclear weapons because we have nuclear weapons.<br />
The nuclear powers cannot be excluded from this: they must understand that<br />
the most likely threats to their security lie in the proliferation of nuclear<br />
weapons. This is a point we have made often about the French tests and the way they<br />
cut across the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the most important arms<br />
control treaty ever negotiated within the UN system.<br />
I notice that former French President Giscard D'Estaing made a similar point<br />
in an article in the French press on 12 October. He said that " the increase in<br />
the number of states, be they big or small, who manage to develop nuclear<br />
weapons, now constitutes for France a threat just as serious, if not more<br />
serious, than that of a strategic strike decided by one of the rare countries<br />
with nuclear weaponry."<br />
I believe that a world free of nuclear weapons is now attainable. It can be<br />
done and it will be in the best security interests of Australia and our allies and<br />
friends if we do it.<br />
As we saw in the Gulf War, new technology has given weaponry an accuracy<br />
that substitutes precision for brute explosive force, and with far less risk to<br />
civilians than those from nuclear weapons.<br />
With the collapse of the Soviet Union, we have also seen how real is the<br />
potential for catastrophic nuclear accidents.<br />
The Government believes the time has come for more determined movement<br />
towards the goal of a world free of nuclear weapons. </p>
<p>There is no magic wand we can wave to make this happen. As with the long<br />
negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament to get rid of chemical<br />
weapons, ultimate success may be decades away. And getting there<br />
involves security issues of the greatest complexity and profundity. We do not<br />
minimise the difficulties or the dangers.<br />
Success depends ultimately on having the will as well as the ambition. The<br />
Chemical Weapons Convention, endorsed by the UN General Assembly in<br />
1992, has shown that where there is a will there is a way to put the genie<br />
back in the bottle. We proved it was possible to rid the world of a whole class<br />
of weapons of mass destruction. And the verification problems for a total ban<br />
on nuclear weapons should be easier to solve than those for a ban on<br />
chemical weapons.<br />
A key building block for a nuclear weapons-free world is already in place with<br />
the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, article VI of which commits the nuclear<br />
weapon states to " pursue negotiations in good faith on effective measures<br />
relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date and to nuclear<br />
disarmament". But this generalised statement of principle is not nearly enough.<br />
What we need now is action to achieve the abolition of all nuclear weapons.<br />
These are the next steps the Government has in mind.<br />
In our own region we want an end to nuclear testing by France and the<br />
closure of the Mururoa test site.<br />
For nearly 50 years since the beginning of the nuclear weapons era the<br />
Pacific has been used as a testing ground. The Americans began testing in<br />
the Pacific in 1946 and continued until 1962; the British tested in Australia<br />
from 1952 until 1963; and the French are still testing in French Polynesia.<br />
In 1983 the Australian Government set the objective of ridding the region of<br />
testing and began its campaign to declare a South Pacific Nuclear Free<br />
Zone. With the announcement on 20 October by France, the United<br />
Kingdom and the United States that they would sign the protocols of the<br />
South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty in the first half of 1996, we can say<br />
that we are on the point of achieving our objective and ending a dark period<br />
of the region's history.<br />
The Government's deep regret, of course, is that France is not drawing the<br />
logical conclusion from its intention to sign the SPNFZ protocols and ending<br />
its tests now as we urge it to do.<br />
We also want the nuclear weapons states to support the African Nuclear<br />
Weapon Free Zone Treaty, which is being presented to the current session of<br />
the General Assembly, as well as the South East Asian Nuclear Weapon<br />
Free Zone which is nearing completion. </p>
<p>We believe that progress towards a nuclear weapons free world would be<br />
given a major boost through the creation of linkages between existing or<br />
potential nuclear weapons free zones in the South Pacific. Latin American.<br />
Africa and the Indian Ocean which already cover most of the southern<br />
hemisphere. Globally, the most immediate priority has to be the conclusion of a genuinely<br />
comprehensive test ban treaty by mid-1996, followed by its early entry into<br />
force. Australia, together with Mexico and New Zealand, is presenting a<br />
resolution to the current session of the General Assembly to entrench this<br />
deadline. In Geneva, Australia has been consulting closely with key countries on ways<br />
to expedite the CTBT negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament to take<br />
advantage of this opportunity. Over the next few months the Government will<br />
be devoting substantial resources as we did for the Chemical Weapons<br />
Convention to doing what we can to help bring this about.<br />
Next, we want to see the immediate start and early conclusion of negotiations<br />
on a convention to ban the production of fissile material for weapons<br />
purposes the so-called " cut-off" convention. And we want to see the<br />
development of a regime requiring all states to declare and account for their<br />
present stocks of fissile material, as another necessary prelude to the<br />
elimination of nuclear weapons.<br />
We want to encourage the further strengthening of international safeguards,<br />
in particular by building up the International Atomic Energy Agency's ability to<br />
detect illegal undeclared nuclear facilities.<br />
We want universal membership of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty,<br />
particularly by the nuclear threshold states of India, Israel and Pakistan.<br />
But as I said earlier, Australia is determined to pursue the complete<br />
elimination of nuclear weapons.<br />
We want the nuclear weapons states to carry out their commitment to the<br />
elimination of their nuclear stockpiles by adopting a systematic process to<br />
achieve that result.<br />
The next steps towards this are the adherence by the United States and<br />
Russia to the destruction timetable under START, and further nuclear<br />
reduction agreements between the United States and Russia, with the<br />
earliest possible involvement of the United Kingdom, France and China.<br />
We acknowledge the need as we always have, for a system of stable<br />
deterrence to be maintained while the reduction and eventual elimination of<br />
nuclear weapons is being achieved. </p>
<p>All these elements constitute a program which will set norms for international<br />
behaviour, establish new international legal obligations and further develop<br />
international control mechanisms which will serve as an essential framework<br />
for the safe and secure elimination of nuclear weapons.<br />
I am writing to other heads of government who share Australia's concerns,<br />
suggesting that we look at the means by which we can advance the cause of<br />
a nuclear-weapons free world. I hope a new coalition of international<br />
interests will emerge from these consultations.<br />
As its contribution to this, the Government will establish a group of<br />
knowledgeable and imaginative individuals from around the world. In a major<br />
series of meetings in Australia, this group will be tasked to produce a report<br />
to be submitted to the next United Nations General Assembly and to the<br />
Conference on Disarmament in Geneva.<br />
The group will examine the problems of security in a nuclear weapons-free<br />
world and suggest practical steps towards the goal, including the ways of<br />
dealing with stability and security in the transitional period.<br />
Next week, the International Court of Justice will be hearing a case referred<br />
to it by the UN General Assembly, asking it to give an advisory judgement on<br />
the legality of the use and threat of use of nuclear weapons. We believe, and<br />
will argue before the Court, that it would be best for the Court not to make a<br />
judgement the legqality of nuclear weapons is a different matter, of course,<br />
from their utility or strategic value or even their morality.<br />
A judgement by the Court that the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons is<br />
gal, even if only in some limited circumstances, runs the profound risk of<br />
achieving precisely the opposite of what those seeking the Court's opinions<br />
want namely the encouragement of others who want to join the nuclear club.<br />
Even a judgment that nuclear weapons use or threat is illegal unless very<br />
carefully framed to deal with how that conclusion might be put into practical<br />
effect would likely be ignored by the nuclear powers and, as a result, serve<br />
no purpose other than to weaken the standing of the Court itself.<br />
The Government has now decided, however, that Australia will also argue to<br />
the court that if, despite the good reasons for not making a decision, the court<br />
is minded to make a decision in the case, it should decide in favour of the<br />
illegality of those weapons. The Foreign Minister, Senator Evans, will travel<br />
to The Hague to present this case on the Government's behalf on<br />
October. We are not naive about our role in this enterprise to make the world free of<br />
nuclear weapons. We are a nation of only medium size and weight in the<br />
world, and we are not a nuclear power. </p>
<p>On the other hand, we are skilled at multilateral diplomacy and have<br />
demonstrated on issues like the peace process in Cambodia and APEC and<br />
the Chemical Weapons Convention and the protection of Antarctica as a<br />
wilderness reserve and the campaign against apartheid, that we have the<br />
energy and ideas and the capacity to create coalitions with others, to make a<br />
real difference in the world.<br />
With the same energy we gave to those projects we will now commit<br />
ourselves to the goal of a nuclear free world.<br />
Reflecting on the history of nuclear strategy, the American writer Fred Kaplan<br />
says that nuclear strategies were contrived to disguise the real nature of the<br />
nuclear bomb. It is in fact, he writes, " a device of sheer mayhem, a weapon<br />
whose cataclysmic powers no-one really had the faintest idea of how to<br />
control. The nuclear strategists had come to impose order but in the end<br />
chaos still prevailed."<br />
The world has a chance just now to find a way out of the chaos. The chance<br />
will not last long. We can help the world to grasp it, even show the way.<br />
At the beginning of the United Nations' second fifty years, there could be no<br />
better way for us to show our commitment to the ideals which motivated the<br />
men and women who drew up the Charter than by working, like them, to turn<br />
a coalition of noble ideas into a concrete and enduring reality. </p>
