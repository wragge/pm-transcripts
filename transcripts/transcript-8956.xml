SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE RON P. J. KEATING, UP<br />
LUNCHEON IN HONOUR THE HIS EXC ELL ENCY DR VON WEIZSAECKER,<br />
PRESIDENT OF THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY,<br />
PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA, 6 SEPTEMBER 1993<br />
On behalf of the Government and people of Australia, I<br />
extend to you and your party the warmest welcome to<br />
Australia. Might I say that as one who rarely goes through a day<br />
indeed would f ind it dif ficult to ge~ through a day<br />
without listening to Beethoven or Brahms or Richard<br />
Strauss, I am in almost constant touch with your<br />
homeland. But, of course, Australia's links w ith your country go<br />
well beyond the legacy of music which Germany has left<br />
the world.<br />
Nearly a quarter of a million Australians have German<br />
ancestry and their contribution to our industry and<br />
culture has been profound.<br />
To take the most obvious and tangible example, the wine<br />
before you is purely Australian, but the Australian wine<br />
industry was fundamentally the creation of German<br />
settlers in the nineteenth century.<br />
German emigrants were there on the frontiers of<br />
Australia's development almost from the beginning in<br />
exploration, in agriculture, industry and intellectual<br />
life; and in the post war period they have continued to<br />
play a prominent role in building modern multicultural<br />
Australia. The bonds of friendship between us are made so much<br />
stronger because these historical and cultural links are<br />
strong.<br />
Mr President, let me say that your reputation precedes<br />
you. </p>
<p>As we Australians consider the future of our own<br />
constitutional arrangements, it is of more than casual<br />
interest to us to observe how effectively you have used<br />
the office of head of state to promote an enlightened<br />
view of Germany's international role in the changed<br />
circumstances your country is now experiencing.<br />
And, Mr President, we regard with great admiration your<br />
appeals for tolerance and civility in addressing new<br />
social challenges in the reunified Germany.<br />
Through you we extend our greetings to 80 million Germans<br />
re-united in freedom after four decades of division.<br />
in doing so we know we greet a friend, a partner, a<br />
people with whom we have more than a little in conmmon and<br />
who face challenges similar to our own.<br />
As we approach the end of the twentieth century we are<br />
both confronted with a world of increasing complexity and<br />
dynamic, gometimes bewildering, change.<br />
The hopes engendered by the sudden end to the Cold War<br />
have been dashed in many cases the post Cold War era<br />
sometimes seems bleaker than we ever could have imagined.<br />
Developments in Central and Eastern Europe and the former<br />
Soviet Union have necessarily been a major preoccupation<br />
of the German government, and Germany has done a great<br />
deal to assist cotntrieg in these regions towards<br />
democracy and economic efficiency.<br />
In Australia we admire Germany's constructive engagement<br />
in these problems.<br />
In this fluid post Cold War environment Australia has<br />
also focussed its attention on regional dialogue and an<br />
emerging sense of regional common interest and identity.<br />
We have promoted the establishment of the APEC process<br />
which builds on the growing linkages and immense dynamism<br />
of the Asia-Pacific economies.<br />
With a world economy struggling to emerge from recession,<br />
we desperately need the contribution that a fair and open<br />
multilateral trading system can make to sustained global<br />
growth.<br />
Germany is in a powerful position to advance the cause of<br />
such a system. Your country's influence in Europe is<br />
crucial to a successful outcome of the Uruguay Round.<br />
You will be aware that, particularly through the Cairns<br />
Group, Australia has done all it can to bring the Round<br />
to a positive conclusion. </p>
<p>Mr President, for many years Germany has played a<br />
constructive role in disarmament and non-proliforation,<br />
on the environment, and on international development.<br />
we value your willingness to help keep the international<br />
peace; including in Cambodia, which for nearly 20 years<br />
stood out as the focal point of suffering and instability<br />
in South-East Asia, rather as Yugoslavia tragically does<br />
today in South-East Europe.<br />
We know that the development of a more engaged<br />
international role for Germany is no easy task. We know<br />
it is complicated by frequently conflicting expectations<br />
abroad. It must be disconcerting to be at once<br />
criticised for exercising too much power and too little.<br />
For our part, we regard the Federal Republic as a good<br />
international citizen and we welcome your commitment to<br />
assuming all the responsibilities associated with being a<br />
member of the UN and a major player within the<br />
international community.<br />
We also welcome the fact, Mr President, that Germany<br />
continues to look beyond Europe. We are pleased that the<br />
German government and business community are seeking to<br />
cooperate with the countries of the Asia-Pacific region.<br />
Your visit underlines this interest.<br />
Just as we see scope for enhanced direct business<br />
cooperation between Australia and Germany, so we will be<br />
seeking opportunities for joint ventures in the region.<br />
The presence of senior Germany business representatives<br />
at a major trade and investment conference in Melbourne<br />
in November we hope will lead to practical developments<br />
of this kind.<br />
Mr President, far from diminishing our ties with Europe,<br />
we believe that Australia's increasingly strong links<br />
with Asia will make us a more attractive partner for<br />
European business, politics and culture.<br />
We do not forget our long-standing links with you; nor do<br />
we fail to recognise the opportunities which exist for us<br />
in both the mature markets of Western Europe and the<br />
evolving markets in Eastern Europe.<br />
Germany is a perfect example of a valued European trading<br />
partner both an important market and an important<br />
source of investment.<br />
In 1992 Germany was Australia's eighth-largest trading<br />
partner with total two-way trade of $ 4.3 billion; and<br />
there is $ 6.4 billion in German capital stock invested<br />
here. </p>
<p>Although we will remain a competitive and reliable<br />
supplier of raw materials to German industry, we also<br />
have, I believe, much to offer as a partner in<br />
manufacturing and there is perhaps no better example of<br />
this than the construction of the ANZAC ships which I<br />
understand you saw last week at Williamstown in Victoria.<br />
New areas for cooperation are emerging.<br />
Our two countries recently signed a memorandum of<br />
understanding on environmental cooperation. Australian<br />
firms are engaged in restoring the environment of the new<br />
Eastern states of Germany.<br />
Australia is to be the partner country at the 1995 Cebit<br />
Information Technology Fair in Hanover.<br />
In the same year, the Australia Abroad Council is<br />
planning to hold a major promotion in Germany, the focus<br />
of which is likely to be Art and New Technologies.<br />
And we have big plans to convert more and more Germans to<br />
the pleasures of drinking Australian wine and eating<br />
Australian food.<br />
Despite our differing regional focus, our relationship is<br />
strong and full of potential. Certainly the prospects<br />
are extremely bright f or our companies to work together<br />
with yours in our nearby markets, whether they be in the<br />
Asia-Pacific or in Eastern Europe, Russia and other parts<br />
of the former Soviet Union.<br />
Kr President, of course our success in the future will<br />
depend in a large part on the extent and the quality of<br />
the contact between our two peoples. If we bring to our<br />
relationship some of the spirit and imagination, the<br />
energy and ideas which the early German settlers brought<br />
to Australia, we are very likely to succeed.<br />
The legendary German explorer, Ludwig Leichhardt, wrote<br />
back to Germany in 1842:<br />
Few come here to stay. But many change their minds<br />
when they have come to discern the attractions of<br />
this rich country, and to find its disadvantages<br />
less irksome. Families of this kind he said who<br />
are taking an interest in the colony, and who have<br />
come to look upon it as their own country,<br />
constitute, in fact, its only real wealth. And it<br />
is through them that a powerful state will gradually<br />
arise, a state which may possibly consign old Europe<br />
to oblivion.<br />
One does not have to believe the last part to see the<br />
truth in the first. For it is true that Australia's<br />
success is built on the faith of those who, abandoning<br />
the old world, made this new world country unequivocally<br />
their home.<br />
T 0 Ob I T T f(' T !-A </p>
<p>And it is also true, Mr President, that 19th century<br />
settlers and late 20th century tourists and business<br />
people alike, have come to Australia and found that the<br />
attractions far out-weighed the disadvantages.<br />
We hope there will be many more such people, Mr<br />
President, and that you will in future, number yourself<br />
among them. That you will leave Australia assured of the<br />
friendship and good-will which exists between us. And<br />
that you will come again.<br />
I now invite the Leader of the Opposition to join me in<br />
welcoming the President. </p>
