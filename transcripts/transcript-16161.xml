    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Rudd Government is close to finalising the first stage of consultations to develop an historic National Compact with the non-profit sector.</p>
<p>The Compact is part of the government's reform program to build an Australia for the 21st century.</p>
<p>âThe Compact will represent our commitment to work in partnership with non-profit organisations to build stronger communities and improve the lives of all Australians,â Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said.</p>
<p>Similar compacts or partnerships have worked well overseas to provide a mechanism for discussion and agreement on important issues, including providing better services to local communities, families and individuals.</p>
<p>The non-profit sector includes community groups, sporting associations and peak not for profit bodies which help create strong, active and connected communities.</p>
<p>At the end of June 2007, there were 40,976 ABN registered not-for-profit organisations in Australia, as well as 600,000 organisations that would not fall within the ABN registration requirements.</p>
<p>âWe are now finalising the first phase of consultations with the non-profit sector  -  these have taken place in Sydney, Perth, Hobart, Adelaide, Townsville, Brisbane, Darwin and Alice Springs with consultations scheduled for Melbourne and the ACT next week,â Mr Rudd said.</p>
<p>These consultations have been jointly led by Senator Ursula Stephens, Parliamentary Secretary for Social Inclusion and the Voluntary Sector, and the Australian Council of Social Service.</p>
<p>âMany matters have been raised during the consultations including the importance of the Compact as vehicle for change, an opportunity to redefine the non-profit sector's relationship with Government,â Mr Rudd said.</p>
<p>âA National Compact would build on initiatives already commenced to improve the relationship between community organisations and Government and to help them do their important work:</p>
<p>     * We have acted to end the use of âconfidentiality clauses' in funding contracts which stopped organisations from speaking to the media.</p>
<p>     * We have commenced discussions with State and Territory Governments to reduce the red tape burden on non-profit organisations so they can focus on the needs of the individuals and families they serve.</p>
<p>     * We have also asked the Productivity Commission to construct a new tool to measure the contribution of the non-profit sector to communities and the economy, including the value of volunteers,â Mr Rudd said.</p>
