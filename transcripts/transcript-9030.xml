ADDRESS BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
OPENING OF NEW SBS PREMISES, SYDNEY<br />
NOVEMBER 1993<br />
It is a very great pleasure to be here this evening at the opening of the new<br />
premises of the Special Broadcasting Service.<br />
I'm delighted that SIBS has moved to Artarmon, alongside other networks. As<br />
it should be, because for a long time it has been in the media mainstream.<br />
In fact, for a long time it has been a groundbreaker a leader rather than a<br />
follower. A service which has directed Australian eyes to looking both at this<br />
country and its place in the world in a new way.<br />
SBS has taught us truths about the Australian identity which not so long ago<br />
we found it convenient to ignore truths which some people, whose names<br />
probably spring easily to mind, still sadly seem unwilling or unable to come to<br />
terms with.<br />
It has also been an important weapon in the fight against the sporadic efforts<br />
of a few to incite outbreaks of racism and cultural paranoia in this country, not<br />
least by its ability to expose the absurdity and intellectual dishonesty of such<br />
positions. This new building Is very appropriate for SBS. Not only does it provide a<br />
home for the service which is consonant with its image elegant, economic<br />
and efficient but it also provides a home for the complete service, bringing<br />
radio and TV under the same roof for the first time.<br />
That I think is important, because for some people, particularly those who<br />
speak no language other than English, the glamour of SBS television makes<br />
it easy to overlook the fact that radio is such a crucial part of the service. A<br />
part which is in such demand that it will soon be going national.<br />
In fact I understand that it will go national next year on Australia Day.<br />
And that is most appropriate. </p>
<p>It is fitting that it do so because SBSs strength is that it reaches into real<br />
Australia. Multicultural Australia.<br />
It does so by providing, principally through its radio service, an indispensable<br />
source of information and advice to newly arrived migrants advice about<br />
their rights, advice about their responsibilities. Information without which they<br />
would have much less chance of participating fully as Australians in the<br />
development of this country.<br />
It also does so by giving Australians perspectives on issues which they<br />
cannot get elsewhere. Not only through its news and documentary services,<br />
which are second to none, but also through its commitment to valuing<br />
creativity, to celebrating variety, to championing a view of Australia as a<br />
country rich in human resources, and most of all, ideas.<br />
How nice it is to see a media service which puts a premium on ideas and their<br />
dissemination! Valuing ideas, I have to say, doesn't seem to be something which is<br />
preoccupying a lot of other people in the media at the moment. Rather there<br />
seems to be an obsession with the superficial and the trivial; with the cheap<br />
headline rather than the in-depth analysis of issues which are of real concern<br />
and importance.<br />
We need the media to play its part in broadening our vision.<br />
We need it to help educate Australia about issues which are vital to our<br />
future, and which we need to resolve now. Issues which include<br />
fundamentally our multicultural population about the competitive edge they<br />
can give us in selling our products overseas, in opening up new markets in<br />
the Asia Pacific region, where all the action is. Where Australia has to<br />
perform. We need the media to promote Australia as a sophisticated and socially just<br />
society. As a country with which other countries see the advantage of being<br />
associated. As a country which takes itself seriously.<br />
When did we last see a major newspaper story or TV feature from another<br />
network which acknowledged that multicultural Australia was one of the great<br />
success stories of this country's history? Or one which considered the<br />
opportunities multiculturalism has opened up for us?<br />
But if a critic on the most unsubstantial evidence attacks the principles and<br />
working of multiculturalism it is front page news.<br />
In truth, multiculturalism is a given a fact of our normal life. </p>
<p>We need SBS, if only to remind us of this truth. And it is to the credit of the<br />
people who have shaped SBS people like Nick Shehadie, like Brian Johns<br />
and now Malcolm Long that they have been resolute in their commitment to<br />
this principle.<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen<br />
This is a Government which is steadfastly committed to a multicultural<br />
Australia. Human decency demands it. Economic efficiency and<br />
commonsense requires it.<br />
Our policies of cultural pluralism have been among the most innovative and<br />
creative in the world. They have also been the hallmark of a decent and far<br />
sighted society.<br />
In a world often afflicted by ethnic and cultural tension, bitterness and<br />
bloodshed, Australia stands among those few countries which have avoided<br />
such conflicts.<br />
And we have done so while celebrating rather than sacrificing our diversity.<br />
While we need to guard against complacency, it is true to say that under the<br />
umbrella of an overall commitment to the nation and its uniting values and<br />
institutions, a society of great richness and variety and remarkable harmony<br />
has evolved.<br />
SIBS is both a symbol and a microcosm of that society.<br />
It gives me great pleasure to formally open its new home. I congratulate all<br />
associated with the design and building of these new premises and I wish all<br />
associated with SBS a most successful future.<br />
Thank you. </p>
