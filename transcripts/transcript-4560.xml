U5' 3 HALIA<br />
FOR PRESS 26 NOVEMBER 1977<br />
For the past week the leaders of the Labor Party have failed to<br />
tell the public in clear terms whether they would protect people<br />
from having their tax increased simply because of inflation.<br />
They have been desperately confused and have repeatedly contradicted<br />
one another.<br />
The Shadow Treasurer, Mr. Hurford, was expected -to give the<br />
definitive statement by the end of the week. He failed to do<br />
SO. He cancelled his press conference.<br />
It is quite clear that -the Labor Party would abolish what is called<br />
tax indexation. In other words, they would if they were in office,<br />
greatly increase the personal income tax the public must pay. They<br />
would3 not do t-his in an open way through legislation, but by stealth.<br />
That is, as your income increased through inflation ( which their<br />
speniding policies would encourage) they would take a higher<br />
proportion of it in tax.<br />
Let ire demonstrate how important it is to maintain tax indexation.<br />
As a result of -the two indexation adjustments, my Government has<br />
already made in 1976 and 1977, the person on average weekly<br />
earnings of about $ 200 a week with dependent spouse is now paying<br />
$ 9 a week Less tax than someone who was on the same income in<br />
1975/ 76. The person on the same income without dependent spouse<br />
is now paying $ 6 a week less. Labor propose to do away with the<br />
projection which allows such tax savings.<br />
The unstated reason why Labor do not want to protect taxpayers<br />
against inflation is that Mr. Whitlam wants the money to pay for<br />
his big spending programme. This is precisely what he did in<br />
1972/ 75. That is why my Government introduced tax indexation<br />
to try to st1--op it happening again.<br />
But the posi--* z-even worse than this. The Labor tax grab knows<br />
no bounds. Whitlam, Mr. Hayden and Mr. Hurford would repeal<br />
the laws xv~.-rovide for tax cuts -from February next year.<br />
Mr. Hurf' 7o-r in justification of this plan that these tax<br />
cuts aive S--nificant benefit only to the wealthy. This is not<br />
-true. / In the </p>
<p>2<br />
In the first place, the tax cut provides for 225,000 taxpayers,<br />
or 4.1 per cent of all taxpayers, on low incomes, to pay no<br />
tax. Labor proposes to reimpose tax on these low income<br />
earners. Secondly, the February tax cut provides for substantial tax<br />
savings throughout the income ranges, totalling $ 400 million<br />
this year and $ 1,470 million next year. Labor want to take it<br />
all back to pay for their great plans.<br />
To show there has been no redistribution of the tax burden, I<br />
will be publishing information next week on tis matter.<br />
This shows tat the proportion of total personal tax which<br />
is payable by taxpayers on higher incomes is not significantly<br />
changed by the new tax arrangements which will operate from<br />
February 1978.<br />
My Government does believe in redistribution from the Government<br />
sector to the people. The Labor Party want to redistribute<br />
income back to the Government. It is the central part in<br />
their thinking. That is why they are planning a huge increase<br />
in personal income tax. I </p>
