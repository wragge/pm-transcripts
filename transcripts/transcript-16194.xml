    <content><![CDATA[<p>Governments have many tasks.</p>
<p>But none is more important than the defence of the nation.</p>
<p>None is more important than ensuring the security of the nation.</p>
<p>The men of foresight who drafted Australia's Constitution were clear on this point.</p>
<p>One power they explicitly gave to the new Commonwealth Government was that of Defence.</p>
<p>For 107 years since Federation, Commonwealth Governments have debated, shaped, and implemented the nation's defence policy.</p>
<p>It is a policy that has been through many changes.</p>
<p>And the changes reflect the evolution of the modern independent nation that we now have.</p>
<p>In the pre-World War One era we saw ourselves as part of the Empire  -  with the words of Andrew Fisher still ringing in our ears down the corridors of time.</p>
<p>In World War One, through the work of Charles Bean in many ways, we began to see ourselves as something different, something unique.</p>
<p>It was the story of Gallipoli  -  so clearly and directly told by Bean  -  that helped shaped that national identity.</p>
<p>During the course of the Second World War our defence relationship with the United States deepened and was the harbinger of our future alliance.</p>
<p>The birth of the alliance reflected a new and different stage in our evolution.</p>
<p>Throughout the years of the Cold War, our defence policy clearly cemented our role as a US ally.</p>
<p>At the same time, we increasingly contributed to United Nations peacekeeping operations as we began to fulfil our role as a middle power that wanted to make a contribution to a stable global order.</p>
<p>As our defence policy has developed, the role of the press and the historians has been critical.</p>
<p>Perhaps no single individual has been more important than Charles Bean.</p>
<p>100 years ago  -  in 1908  -  he began his career as a journalist.</p>
<p>His first assignment that year was to cover the visit to Australia of the US Great White Fleet.</p>
<p>He did so from the flagship of the Royal Navy squadron on the Australian station, HMS Powerful.</p>
<p>And, after his assignment, he published a book about the experience of sailing around the South Pacific.</p>
<p>But his book was more than a retelling of this journey.</p>
<p>It also contained in it the argument for an independent Royal Australian Navy.</p>
<p>He was not alone in advocating the need for an Australian navy distinct from the Royal Navy.</p>
<p>He was joined by Deakin.</p>
<p>And more strongly by Fisher and the latter's demand that this be a separate command to the Imperial Fleet.</p>
<p>But his writing  -  even before his reporting from Gallipoli brought him to wider attention  -  set an example of what quality writing on matters of national security can do.</p>
<p>Early on Bean was making a contribution to the debate about the defence of the nation.</p>
<p>Bean set the standard here.</p>
<p>His was a unique contribution.</p>
<p>His writings about Gallipoli told, in simple, direct language, how Australian men fought at Gallipoli.</p>
<p>He told the story of the conflict from the point of view of the soldier.</p>
<p>He told the real story.</p>
<p>And in doing so he told Australians about themselves.</p>
<p>He told Australians that theirs was a nation to be proud of.</p>
<p>That their representatives in the horror of the trenches of Gallipoli were showing the qualities that made us great  -  determination, commitment to one another, and courage.</p>
<p>Bean of course then carried this reporting to the next level with the official histories.</p>
<p>The histories are one of the most important and seminal works in Australia's history.</p>
<p>They tell the story of Australians at war.</p>
<p>And they set a new standard for military history writing around the world.</p>
<p>Bean made military history about the men fighting the battles, not only about the generals setting the strategy.</p>
<p>It was a uniquely Australian approach.</p>
<p>An egalitarian military history.</p>
<p>Not one written for the General Staff.</p>
<p>In telling the history so powerfully, Bean also made the military an important part of our history.</p>
<p>More than any other individual, he was responsible for telling the story of ANZAC and making it a thread that weaves its way through the fabric our national character.</p>
<p>Bean is an example of how journalism can be a powerful influence not just on the development of policy  -  but also in shaping the national soul.</p>
<p>Bean, in his own way, became the narrator of the nation's story.</p>
<p>And in some respects, after Lawson and Paterson, the first narrator of the nation's soul.</p>
<p>Certainly, for me, Bean's history of Australia's involvement in the First World War together with Manning Clark's general history of Australia, had something to do with my own intellectual foundation.</p>
<p>And I believe fashioned some of the primal forces of Australian nationalism.</p>
<p>This is as true today as it was 100 years ago when Bean began his career.</p>
<p>Because in a democracy, it is critical that we have a well-informed national debate about defence policy and the conflicts in which we are involved. </p>
<p>Our military forces today are operating at a very high tempo.</p>
<p>The major combat commitment we currently have is in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>We have almost 1100 Australian troops deployed there.</p>
<p>And, rightly, it attracts the interest of the media.</p>
<p>In recent months we have seen the debate in Australia and internationally turn to the question of whether we are making progress in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>In short, I believe that the answer is that we are making progress  -  even though this is slow and subject to setbacks.</p>
<p>I would also argue that we must make progress.</p>
<p>I would like to speak tonight about why we are involved in Afghanistan, what we are trying to achieve and how we are trying to achieve it.</p>
<p>Our commitment to Afghanistan is critical.</p>
<p>It is critical because it is clearly in our national interest.</p>
<p>First and foremost, we have seen the dangers of allowing Afghanistan to fall under the heel of the Taliban.</p>
<p>We have a direct security interest in strategic denial  -  preventing terrorism by denying terrorists free access to Afghanistan  -  and at the same time helping that nation to overcome 30 years of civil war to become a more stable state.</p>
<p>Under the Taliban, the people of Afghanistan lived in an environment of oppression and extreme poverty with the constant threat of violence.</p>
<p>This was a period where the basic needs of Afghans were left ignored  -  indeed people's lives went backwards  -  amid the pursuit of a violent ideology.</p>
<p>It was an ideology that bred hatred.</p>
<p>It was an ideology that brutalised women.</p>
<p>It was an ideology that found fellow travellers in Osama Bin Laden and Al Qaeda when they were ejected from Sudan.</p>
<p>The end result was the death of 3000 people in the United States in September 2001, including 10 Australians.</p>
<p>The end result was a global terrorism movement that roamed the world and reached into South East Asia, Europe and the rest of the world.</p>
<p>That threat is yet to be eradicated.</p>
<p>In fact, our successes in disrupting terrorism have made some complacent about the threat.</p>
<p>But we should not be complacent.</p>
<p>Al Qaeda and the terrorist groups with which it is linked continue to train.</p>
<p>They continue to plan.</p>
<p>They continue to seek opportunities to attack.</p>
<p>We felt the immediacy of the threat from terrorism on 12 October 2002 when 88 Australians were killed in Bali.</p>
<p>Those behind the attack had trained in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>So, a more stable Afghanistan  -  one that supports security rather than offers succour to those who seek to undermine it  -  will make for a more secure world.</p>
<p>This goal is something we share with the 40 nations contributing in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>And it is a goal endorsed by the United Nations Security Council.</p>
<p>It is a goal that has been authorised and is supported by the Government of Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Beyond the immediate and direct threat of terrorism, we have a second national interest at stake.</p>
<p>Working with our partners in Afghanistan, we show that we are a committed to doing our fair share to tackle international security challenges as an engaged middle power and as a real partner in our alliance with the United States.</p>
<p>We are a regional power with both regional and global interests.</p>
<p>It is right for us to play a role in meeting global security challenges.</p>
<p>We do not just talk about security cooperation.</p>
<p>We are also prepared to do our fair share of the work.</p>
<p>It is dangerous work and it is hard work, and our diggers' lives are on the line every day.</p>
<p>It is part of being a real ally of the United States.</p>
<p>It is part of being an active member of the United Nations.</p>
<p>It is part of contributing to a stable international order  -  and not just being a passive observer of events.</p>
<p>There are, therefore, two compelling reasons for our commitment to Afghanistan.</p>
<p>The first is preventing the spread of terrorism by directly taking on this threat and helping Afghanistan to rebuild itself into a more peaceful and stable state.</p>
<p>The second is demonstrating our capacity to play an active role in enhancing international security  -  both with our allies and with the wider international community.</p>
<p>If our primary objective is to prevent Afghanistan from again becoming a place where terrorist organisations can find refuge and train and plan, and export their terrorism to other nations, we need to provide the conditions for a stable government to develop.</p>
<p>Afghanistan needs security, good governance and economic opportunity.</p>
<p>This is a long-term challenge and we are in for the long haul.</p>
<p>There will be setbacks along the way.</p>
<p>Success is not guaranteed.</p>
<p>And we offer no blank cheque.</p>
<p>In the short term, the most important task is disrupting the insurgency to allow the Afghan Government space to develop.</p>
<p>It is difficult for any government to deal with a violent insurgency campaign, let alone a government that is new and comes to power with few structures and organs of state in place.</p>
<p>History shows us that counter-insurgency operations take a decade or more to win and a key part is winning the support of the population.</p>
<p>Our troops have shown that you can have success against an insurgency.</p>
<p>But disrupting the insurgency is not enough in itself.</p>
<p>We also need to assist the Afghan Government as it matures.</p>
<p>That means helping the Afghan security sector  -  the police and the armed forces  -  to develop.</p>
<p>We need to provide training and support.</p>
<p>We need to show that well trained forces under the command of a civilian government offer the best chance for stability  -  for the government and for the population.</p>
<p>We need to build the confidence of the people of Afghanistan that they can build a future free from the fear and intimidation of the Taliban.</p>
<p>And we need the support of the Government of Pakistan to ensure stability in its border regions with Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Stability in Afghanistan and around its borders will lead to a better future for the people of Afghanistan, for its neighbouring countries such as Pakistan and for the wider world.</p>
<p>Instability in Afghanistan would put further pressure on Pakistan from extremists.</p>
<p>But what we are trying to achieve is more than just rebuilding the security sector.</p>
<p>Working with the Government of Afghanistan and our international partners and other donors, we are also trying to rebuild a nation.</p>
<p>That means rebuilding infrastructure and institutions.</p>
<p>Hospitals, schools and government organs need to have both their physical structures and their knowledge bases rebuilt.</p>
<p>It is an enormous challenge.</p>
<p>It will take years.</p>
<p>It will require a huge investment of funds  -  we have already committed $600 million in development assistance since 2001.</p>
<p>The task of rebuilding a nation is still more complex than building security, infrastructure and institutions.</p>
<p>It is also about helping people to rebuild their lives.</p>
<p>Afghanistan needs training opportunities and education assistance for its people so that they and future generations do not have to rely on violence as a means to fulfil their daily needs.</p>
<p>This will also help to curb economic reliance on the narcotics trade.</p>
<p>Afghanistan needs farmers to feed its people.</p>
<p>It needs people with trade skills to help build and maintain infrastructure.</p>
<p>This will all take time to build and it will take assistance from countries like Australia.</p>
<p>We need to help Afghanistan build security, good governance and economic opportunity because it helps us to achieve our goals.</p>
<p>Australia's primary focus as part of the International Security Assistance Force coalition is the province of Oruzgan.</p>
<p>It is just one of Afghanistan's 34 provinces.</p>
<p>It is an isolated, rural and poor area of Afghanistan.</p>
<p>It has some of the lowest levels of primary education and some of the highest levels of infant mortality in the country.</p>
<p>But we have made progress.</p>
<p>Our military forces have had a positive impact there.</p>
<p>Our personnel in the province work with their Dutch and Afghan security partners to provide stability.</p>
<p>In recent weeks Defence has released details of successful operations to target insurgent leaders.</p>
<p>At the same time the Reconstruction Task Force has also worked to build schools, provide basic training in trades like carpentry and has rebuilt bridges and irrigation systems.</p>
<p>Oruzgan Province also demonstrates the importance of having a coherent military and civilian strategy  -  something that Australia has pushed for in discussions with our NATO partners.</p>
<p>It is not a matter of either or.</p>
<p>Nor is it a matter of one first and then the other.</p>
<p>The civilian and the military are two parts of one strategy.</p>
<p>They cannot be separated.</p>
<p>Either without the other is unsustainable.</p>
<p>This brings some real challenges when dealing with a province like Oruzgan.</p>
<p>It is not that civilian structures have to be rebuilt.</p>
<p>They have to be established.</p>
<p>And they have to be established in a way that recognises and complements existing traditional structures.</p>
<p>Complex power relationships exist in Oruzgan between villages, tribal groups and other interest groups.</p>
<p>All have a stake in the status quo.</p>
<p>The challenge is to work with these groups where possible to build a more stable environment.</p>
<p>To get a long-term solution to Afghanistan's internal tension (both in Oruzgan province and nationwide), there will need to be a carefully integrated civilian, political and military strategy.</p>
<p>The Government of Afghanistan has to win over its opponents and show them that a peaceful future is not only possible but is far preferable to a future of ongoing violent conflict.</p>
<p>As it works to overcome the challenges it faces, the Government of Afghanistan will need our support.</p>
<p>We need to work closely with our partners to achieve the goal we all seek.</p>
<p>Now that Australia has a voice in the NATO councils that set the strategy for the task in Afghanistan we are better placed to make a more meaningful contribution.</p>
<p>The NATO Summit in April in Bucharest which I attended helped to strengthen international commitment.</p>
<p>We welcomed in particular announcements of increased troop commitments by France, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States.</p>
<p>We welcomed the United Nations' commitment to increasing its effort and presence in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>And we welcomed agreement on a process to assess progress in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Given the investment we are making, we need robust analysis of progress.</p>
<p>The International Support Conference for Afghanistan held in June sustained the momentum of the NATO Summit.</p>
<p>At the Conference, the international community pledged 20 billion dollars of support and the Afghan Government launched its own national development strategy.</p>
<p>Our Afghanistan policy is a comprehensive one.</p>
<p>We have a strong military commitment  -  one that includes training and mentoring as key roles.</p>
<p>We have a broad development assistance program  -  one that helps to build skills and soft and hard infrastructure.</p>
<p>But the challenges that remain are enormous.</p>
<p>And the resources that are needed are significant.</p>
<p>But Australia remains committed.</p>
<p>We will subject our commitment to annual review against the mission we have set for ourselves.</p>
<p>Against the integrated civilian and military strategy agreed with NATO.</p>
<p>And against the application of those strategic objectives to our particular charge in Oruzgan province.</p>
<p>Where once again I underline publicly the appreciation for the work being done on the ground by our troops and our diplomats in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Still in harm's way.</p>
<p>All doing their work with absolute professionalism  -  in the great tradition of those who wore the uniform of Australia before them.</p>
<p>There will be more casualties.</p>
<p>This is a dangerous theatre of operations.</p>
<p>But the mission is important for Australia. </p>
<p>100 years ago C.E.W. Bean became a journalist.</p>
<p>In 1914 he became Australia's first official war correspondent.</p>
<p>And, in the trenches at Gallipoli where he was only overlooked for the Military Cross because he was a civilian, he showed a great dedication to the people around him.</p>
<p>And a great dedication to the truth.</p>
<p>It is a remarkable achievement that Bean was at Gallipoli from the very first day  -  and as a result of a wound he sustained during the campaign, he carried a reminder around with him for the rest of his life  -  a bullet in the leg.</p>
<p>It is a remarkable achievement that he followed the Australians to every one of the major battles they were in on the Western Front.</p>
<p>He was determined that the story of the Australian soldiers be told to the Australian people.</p>
<p>And at the end of that conflict  -  and over the next 23 years  -  he produced an official war history unlike anything the world had ever seen.</p>
<p>Of course, Bean's efforts also led to the establishment of this great Australian War Memorial.</p>
<p>This great temple to our great Australian war dead.</p>
<p>This temple to the 100,000 names inscribed on its walls.</p>
<p>A temple to the million and more who have worn the uniform of Australia.</p>
<p>Bean's epitaph lies equally in the words of his history and in the stories of this building.</p>
<p>In both, Bean gave the nation its memory.</p>
<p>And in doing so, inspires the nation in the crafting of its future.</p>
<p>C.E.W. Bean  -  a great Australian who will transcend the ages.</p>
