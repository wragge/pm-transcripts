<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What more could we, or should we, be doing about India and Pakistan?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We just must continue to express the disgust, the outrage and the</p>
<p> genuine worry about the future that I'm sure that all Australians</p>
<p> hold. I thought a few years ago that one of the things we could look</p>
<p> forward to in the next century was a freedom from the worry about</p>
<p> nuclear war that had hung over so many Australians who grew up between</p>
<p> the end of World War II and the late 1980s. Unfortunately, what has</p>
<p> happened in India and Pakistan in recent days has put real doubt on</p>
<p> that.</p>
<p>I think all of the countries of the earth have to mobilise the greatest</p>
<p> diplomatic effort we have seen in decades to drive home the folly,</p>
<p> the danger, the crazy path down which these two countries have gone.</p>
<p> I worry that other countries will try to imitate them. There is no</p>
<p> place in the modern world for copy cat nuclear behaviour and unfortunately</p>
<p> when countries such as India and Pakistan do what they've done</p>
<p> there is always a danger of that.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Is there a case for complete cessation of all aid?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>That's always a problem, Peter, because in doing so you hurt</p>
<p> the most vulnerable and you perhaps drive them inwards on themselves</p>
<p> and they seek more comfort in the self congratulation of the people</p>
<p> who cheer in the streets often in ignorance of the real consequences</p>
<p> of what they're cheering for.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard are you disappointed with your Government's slump in</p>
<p> the recent Morgan Poll?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Polls go all over the place.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
