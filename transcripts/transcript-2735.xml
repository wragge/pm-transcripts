PRIME MINISTER PRESS STATEMENT NO. 4<br />
7 December 1972<br />
TAKiEOTR FREEZE<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr. Whitlam, has frozen a taceover<br />
offer by a U. K. company for a controlling interest in a Victorian<br />
valve manufacturer. An interim order has been gazetted today to prevent<br />
the transfer of any shared in the Victorian company for three<br />
months. The Victorian co. pany is M. B. John and Hattersley Ltd.<br />
Its main activity is the design and manufacture of valves and<br />
fittings for pipelines and pressure vessels.<br />
With total assets of about $ 22 million and net tangible<br />
assets of about $ 13 million, it is believed to be the largest<br />
manufacturer of industrial valves in the Southern Hemisphere.<br />
The takeover offer has been made by Pegler-Hattersley<br />
Ltd., the largest manufacturer of industrial valves in the U. K.<br />
Pegler-Hattersley already owns 20.8 per cent of the<br />
issued capital of M. B. John and Hattersley.<br />
On 28 November it invited M. B. John's shareholders to<br />
accept an offer of $ 2.30 a share for up to a further 40.8 per<br />
cent of the Victorian company's issued capital.<br />
This would have given Pegler-Hattersley a 61 per cent<br />
interest in M. B. John and Hattersley.<br />
Mr. . Thitlem has therefore decided to issue an interim<br />
order under Section 13( 6) of the Companies ( Foreign Takeovers)<br />
Act, prohibiting implementation of the takeover offer for three<br />
months. He did this after discussions with Mr. Frank Crean,<br />
and the Treasury.<br />
The order will enable an examination to be made to<br />
determine whether or not the takeover is contrary to the national<br />
interest. The gazettal of the order will prevent the transfer of<br />
any shares in M. B. John and Hattersley from today.<br />
