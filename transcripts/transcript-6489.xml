SPEECH BY THE PRIME MIN4ISTER<br />
OPENING OF NATIONAL FILM AND-SOUN4D ARCHIVE BUILDING<br />
CANBERRA, 3 OCTOBER 1984<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen,<br />
Max Gillies has just brought George Wallace back to us<br />
all. There's something aboait our mate George Wallace<br />
that's not only entertaining and he was one of our<br />
greatest comedians but also very endearing. He was<br />
the little Aussie battler: independent, never over-awed<br />
by authority or pretension. And-he always won in the<br />
end, as his films and radio shows preserved * in the<br />
National Film and Sound Archive demonstrate.<br />
George is the sort of bloke who'd enjoy a goodl party<br />
like this. The opening of national buildings and<br />
national institutions are often solemn occasions. But<br />
not tonight: that wouldn't suit George and it doesn't<br />
suit us.<br />
This splendid evening has been put togEther to mark the<br />
permanent housing of a new kind of national institution,<br />
an institution devoted to the popular cultural<br />
expression of our age, and dedicated to the preservation<br />
of some of the best manifestations of Australian<br />
character and imagination.<br />
This is appropriately a night for light-hearted<br />
celebration, because we are dealing with media which are<br />
synonymous with entertainment, immediacy, and the stdff<br />
of our life and times and dreams.<br />
But our purpose is serious.<br />
The most popular and pervasive cultural phenomena of our<br />
time moving images and sound recordings -are<br />
threatened. </p>
<p>Not only do the laws of physics and ch' mistry limit<br />
:-heir life span but there is also a widespread<br />
inclination to regard such material as expendable or of<br />
secondary value.<br />
To succumb to such thinking is t~ o make a big mistake.<br />
Anyone with an historical sense would appreciate that a<br />
great deal is bound up with the survival and<br />
accessibility of this major form of record and art<br />
characteristic of our cenitury.<br />
Too much of this great national heritage has already<br />
been irretrievably lost.<br />
of the silent films made in Australia before 1930 no<br />
longer survive.<br />
To put a stop to such losses -the loss of these vital<br />
expressions of Australia's national creativity the<br />
Government has established the National Film and Sound<br />
Archive. The Archive will ensure the development of the necessary<br />
skills, facilities, ethos and methods, needed for<br />
Australia to preserve our heritage. Its work will<br />
ensure the acquisition, preservation and continuing<br />
accessibility of films, radio and television programs,<br />
sound recordings and associated items thiat are in I<br />
their own right of lasting cultural value whether as<br />
historical record, art, entertainment, or otherwise.<br />
More than that: the Archive will represent and promote<br />
this heritage nationally and internationally. Through<br />
it Australians may take due pride in their past, present<br />
and future achievements in these media.<br />
The film and sound media have an impressive and<br />
distinctively Australian tradition.<br />
Their birth is coincident with the emergence of<br />
Australian nationalism nearly 100 years ago.<br />
This makes them, by definition, of particular cultural<br />
importance to us.<br />
Indeed, Australia has one of the oldest film industries<br />
in the world our first film ( significantly of a horse<br />
race the Melbourne Cup) was made in 1896, years before<br />
many European countries began making films.<br />
In that same year Henry Lawson wrote a story called " The<br />
Australian Cinematograph", and in doing so presaged the<br />
concept then unknown of the story film. </p>
<p>In 1906, with " The Story of the Kelly Gang", Australia<br />
invented the concept of the modern feature film<br />
subsequeitzly the ecoliomic foundation of film industries<br />
the world over.<br />
With sound recordings we have almost from the beginning<br />
of the medium, produced worlCd-renowned recording artists<br />
and film and radio stars. That grand tradition<br />
continues and is well represented tonight.<br />
Here we also pay our respect equally to those greats<br />
behind the scene, the directors, producers, writers,<br />
technicians: the people on the other side of the camera<br />
or the microphone.<br />
We all recognise that the travelling picture show man<br />
and a spreading network of rad-io stations kept<br />
Australia's sparse and scattered population in touch<br />
with the outside world from the 1920' s onward.<br />
It shaped our perception of it, broadened our<br />
horizons in those days " when the world beyond was wide".<br />
Indeed, when Australia first introduced the basic wage<br />
it was the only country to take the cost: of a weekly<br />
family visit to the pictures into its calculation.<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen,<br />
Australians have expressed their national identity most<br />
directly and most potently through the screen and sound<br />
media. That is what has so often made Australian films and<br />
sound recordings interesting and attractive to people<br />
overseas, as much as to Australians.<br />
The establishment of the National Film and Sound Archive<br />
is the expression in institutional terms of a need, long<br />
felt by both participants and observers, to guarantee<br />
the preservation and availability of this fragile but<br />
vital heritage.<br />
Its establishment is a cultural landmark for Australia.<br />
It also has made clear the Government's intention to see<br />
this work given the status and resources it deserves, as<br />
well as to see long-standing problems properly addressed<br />
and solutions found.<br />
This is the culmination of much hard work and effort by<br />
many people. I should particularly like to mention with<br />
appreciation the energetic and effective role played . by<br />
my own Senior Adviser, Bob Hogg in helping achieve this<br />
result. jyfrfl~~ r r. </p>
<p>The decision, once announced, was implemented without<br />
delay. This building, which formerly housed the Australian<br />
Institute of Anatomy, has been initially refurbished by<br />
the National Capital Development Commission in order to<br />
allow prompt occupation by the Archive. The National<br />
Capital Development Commission, in conjunction with the<br />
Archive, is currently preparing plans for the earliest<br />
possible complete refurbishment and extension of the<br />
building in order to provide the necessary specialist<br />
facilities for storage, access, preservation, and for<br />
the general public.<br />
The 1984 budget provided for the approximate doubling of<br />
funds and included provision for additional staff and<br />
equipment. I expect the Archive to be very busy in the months<br />
ahead. The Bicentennial National Travelling Film retrospective<br />
has already been announced as part of the official<br />
celebrations in 1988.<br />
The Archive,' in conjunction with the Australian<br />
Bicentennial Authority, will shortly commence initial<br />
planning for this year-long event.<br />
In April 1986, the Archive will host the Congress of The<br />
International Federation of Film Archives, the first<br />
time such a gathering has been held in the southern<br />
hemisphere. In conjunction with this, the Archive will organise a<br />
training school for Film Archive Administrators from<br />
developing countries, especially those in the<br />
Asia/ Pacific region.<br />
On that unprecedented occasion, Australia's stature in<br />
film archiving, as well as its special regional role,<br />
will be on show to Lhe world and Australia will properly<br />
take its place as a responsible and significant<br />
contributor to international affairs in this field.<br />
Similar opportunities will be sought in the field of<br />
international sound archiving.<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen,<br />
Part of the Government's vision for the Archive is that<br />
it should be accessible in the fullest sense to all<br />
Australians. </p>
<p>While that vision has many facets, ane cannot be<br />
realised overnight, some iT~ portant steps in that<br />
direction will be taken during tne coming moaths.<br />
As from tomorrow, this building, and this Exhibition<br />
Hall, will be open to the public. A simple beginning<br />
perhaps, but, I am sure, the start of what will be many<br />
exhibitions and activities in the months and years<br />
ahead.<br />
As well, access restrictions to the co. llections, which<br />
were introduced over two years ago, are to be<br />
progressively lifted as staff numbers are built up.<br />
A copying service will also be provided to radio<br />
broadcasters to allow the Australian community to enjoy<br />
historic recordings in the colle! ction.<br />
In due course the Archive will release selected material<br />
for public sale on videocassette and LP recordings.<br />
The Archive's interstate offices will also provide<br />
access services.<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen,<br />
We are obviously at the beginning of an. exciting<br />
venture. I personally have much pleasure in declaring open this<br />
building as the permanent headquarters of the National<br />
Film and Sound Archive. " 9 </p>
