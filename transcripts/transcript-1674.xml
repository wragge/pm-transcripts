CA PRICORNIA BY-ELECTION<br />
Comment by the Prime Minister, Mr Harold Holt<br />
It is not surpr. sing that the Labor Party has retained<br />
in a by-election a seat it has held for the last six years.<br />
No doubt it w4ll try to make much of its victory, but<br />
a close analysis of the poll figures at Saturday's end of count gives it<br />
little cause for encouragement. Compared with the count at the same<br />
stage in the general election of 1c6,. the Labor vote has increased by<br />
less than 1 per cent, that for the Government parties is up by 6 per<br />
cent, while there was a decline of 4 per cent in the DLF vote.<br />
The Labor vote of 53. 4 per cent is still appreciably<br />
below the percentage of 56. 1 per cent it gained in the general elections<br />
of 1C63, when the Liberal/ Country Party coalition secured a majority<br />
of 26 seats. By-elections notoriously run against governments and<br />
there can be few on record when a government has actually ga. ned a<br />
better percentage of the vote than " t did at the preceding general election.<br />
A 11 parties stressed the issue of development. V. hile<br />
the circumstances of a by-election offer the Government small prospect<br />
of success, it is to be regretted that Central Queenslanders have passed<br />
up the opportunity to place in the National Parliament an able spokesman<br />
in the Derson of Frank Rudd who has devoted so much of his time and<br />
energies to furthering the objectives of development in that area.<br />
