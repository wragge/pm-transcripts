TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J KEATING MP,<br />
INTERVIEW WITH JOHN LAWS, RADIO 2uE, 30 SEPTEMBER 1992<br />
E 6 OE PROOF COPY<br />
JL: How are you alright?<br />
PM: Fine thanks.<br />
JL; I suppose you've come dashing In here to tell me whon<br />
the election is.<br />
PM: No, I haven't.<br />
JL: They rang me up last night and said, he and that's how<br />
they said it with some reverence wants to come in, I<br />
8ai it's obviously to tell me when the eletioni is8<br />
going to be.<br />
PMi JL; Really, couldn't you tell me when the election is going<br />
to be, couldn't you give me a hint?<br />
PMI I don't think it's going to be before Christmas, put it<br />
that way.<br />
JL: Would you like it to be before Christmas? I rather<br />
fancied the sluond Saturday in December.<br />
PM: NO, I tnink the public are entitled to value out or<br />
these polls and this one goes until about the middle of<br />
next year, so that's probably the most likely time.<br />
JL: You want to give us value?<br />
PM: Always.<br />
JL: Mr Hogg certaIjnly gave us value yesterday in this " Poles<br />
Apart" stuff that he released, trying to get to the<br />
e-derly people, is that sporting?<br />
PM; I think it's entirely legitimate for b political party<br />
to respond to a program like this with if you like, a<br />
manual ) n the various changes and what they mean<br />
changes proposed by the Opposition.<br />
JL: I think it's a bit tragic that in a way and I think<br />
you'll probably agree, that the Opposition haven't, </p>

because of lock of ability or lock of opportunity sold<br />
the GST package properly, so we really don't quite<br />
understand it and consequently we can't totally trust<br />
what's in " Pole5 Apart" can we?<br />
PM: Well it will make obvious points and that is, look<br />
. Eightback" 8o-called iS bSi81lly a crude tax switch,<br />
It'a a-wich from the taxing of income to a taxing of<br />
expenditure with polloies grafted onto the edge. One is<br />
to basically get rid of Medicare the other is to change<br />
the industrial relations system. Now we think all that<br />
iu going to be inflationary.<br />
JL: Well Medicare is a bit of a monster and<br />
PMt No, it's not, no.<br />
JL: Well it's only not a monsteor because the good old tax<br />
payers of Australia who were promised there wouldn't be<br />
an increase in the tax levy by the afore mentioned<br />
Dub", have increased the payment that they make<br />
to Medicare and consequently Medicare hae survived. But<br />
had the afore mentioned Prime MinIster bean truthful<br />
when he said that he wusn't going to increase the levy<br />
Medicare would be on its bottom.<br />
PM: Not really, no. What Medicare succeeded in doing is<br />
giving people universal access to health insurance, to<br />
health cover, health protection at a national cost about<br />
two thirds of that of the United States, about eight per<br />
cent of GDP, eight per of the size of the total economy.<br />
We've Rept that eight per cent constant all through the<br />
despite the fact that people know there's been a<br />
great proliferation of services. What you compare now<br />
to say ten years ago, the number of diagnostic Imaging<br />
and pathology and the varlous teats and services people<br />
receive today are much reaterx then then, yet the cost<br />
is still the same. So Medicare has been quite<br />
successful.<br />
JL: But the cost isn't the eome, the lev has been<br />
increased.<br />
PM: The national cost is the same. The Commonwealth always<br />
paid muney intu health insurance, even before Medicare.<br />
JL: The Commonwealth didn't, we did.<br />
PM: The Budget did.<br />
JL: Where did you get your money?<br />
FM: Are we going to have one of these semantic arguments?<br />
JL: No, you see you can't just brush it aside as that.<br />
People have allowed charming politicians like yourself<br />
to simply brush these things aside * TI make us feel<br />

good; the Government did that for us, oh what a<br />
wonderful our money.<br />
PM: That's why I made the overall point, it's not a matter<br />
of the tcansfers, the tax payers to the Commonwealth<br />
budget to health because there are a whole lot of people<br />
poying different things there. There are people who use<br />
the health system more, some people pay less. The whole<br />
question is what is the cost to the nation? And it's<br />
about eight per cent of GDP, it's about two thirds of<br />
the American cost and yet you still get doctor of<br />
choice, universal access to heolth insurance. we won't<br />
have a position in this #; ountry like they've got in<br />
America where millions of people are walking around<br />
uninsured, millions of people in America are sick and<br />
can't afford to protect themselves.<br />
JL: OK, let's not get too deeply Into Medicare, but let's<br />
also be realistic about it, you don't pay anything, the<br />
tax payers pay everything, your Government said that the<br />
levy wouldn't increase, your Government lied, the levy<br />
did increase and consequently Medicare has survived, but<br />
only for thQSC roosons.<br />
PM: The levy has increased, but what has it increased for<br />
basalealy to give public patients better access to<br />
public hospitol core. In other words it is a modest<br />
increase, very modest, couple of decimal points on* it<br />
is to make it beater tgr people to get access to public<br />
hospital. Under John Hewson's proposal he says well<br />
that's all gone, you go and Insure yourself, I'll let<br />
the doctors set the fees, the common fee will be set by<br />
the AMA not by Medicare schedules and then basically the<br />
system will charge what the traffic will bear and if you<br />
don't like the price go and Insure yourself, it will<br />
cost $ 30 o wetA and we say don't you think that's a bit<br />
unfair John, particularly for low to middle income<br />
families to shell out another $ 30 a week for health<br />
insuranc? He says well if they went health cover<br />
that's what they'll hove to pay. Basically John's into<br />
lifting doctors salaries.<br />
JL: Has he said that?<br />
PM; me told the AMA. You see John Oates unions, he'll tell<br />
you on your program hQw uilaoi. s cs&amp; this and the unions<br />
are that<br />
JL: I think hate mignt be a bit hostile?<br />
PM: No, I don't think so, but lets say he has no regard for<br />
unons eloept the AMAunion, the doctors union. He<br />
addreseed them on Sunday about four months ago and told<br />
them that they could fix the fees for medical services<br />
in Australia.<br />
jL: Ie probably has about as much time fvr unions as Brian<br />
Howe has for doctors.<br />

PM: Brian I think ha* a greater sneaking regard for doctors<br />
than John has for unions.<br />
JL: He'd just rather die than let us know?<br />
PM: Maybe.<br />
JL: This document, 200 pages of It, there are not too many<br />
people who are going to read OO pages.<br />
PM; NO, it's basically a manual for anyone interested in it<br />
the media, members of our own Party. " Fightback" was<br />
a proposal which was dropped on the table about a year<br />
ago, it had a dream ride in the media, the media didn't<br />
take it to pieces; it's getting some scrutiny now and<br />
this is an attempt, a manual of all the various<br />
proposals and a cofwnentory on those proposals and a<br />
reference to the toots.<br />
JL: Yes, you're not including me in the media are you?<br />
PM; No, I'm just saying the broadsheet media in the main.<br />
JL: Because I took it to pieces, particularly in the area of<br />
tariffs, I trust I woe right though.<br />
Fm; You have, but from last NovemDer on this thing was at<br />
the time, hailed as something new. I think people now<br />
understand that what it is baeielly a crude switch in<br />
taxations with a few other quite nasty policies grafted<br />
one<br />
JL: Yes, but you thought it was a good idea at one time, so<br />
dd I think it was a good idea at the time you did in<br />
1985 when you diecussed it with me. You thought It was<br />
a good ideo,<br />
PM: That was the only chance Australia hod basically to go<br />
to a consumption tx, that was basically with a Labor<br />
Government, that was doing it with a fully compensated<br />
change, over compensation for people down the bottom<br />
JL; Are you sorry you didn't do it?<br />
PM; and discounts in the wage system for inflation.<br />
That way you could have possibly accommodated such a<br />
change, but again it wasn't 15 per cent and now I've<br />
just been to Japan; they've introduced a three per cent<br />
consumption tax and it seized their whole commerce up,<br />
they had fights in the Diet, shop keepers brawling with<br />
cuutu. n= ze, 15 per cent will just absolutely seize this<br />
CounLry up.<br />
JL: It seems very complex and as I say I don't Know whether<br />
It's lack of opportunity or lack of ability, but they<br />
haven't expldied it very well ana to many people it<br />
does seem very complex and to the elderly people that<br />

<p>30. Sep. 92 18: 00 No. 008 P. 05/ 19<br />
you have aimed this document of yours at seem very<br />
confused by it, but best I don't ask you to explain it,<br />
best I ask them to explain it and I think it would be<br />
important that they do because I do believe that what<br />
you've done lil this " Poleo Apart" document is be a bit<br />
alarmist. Did you read it before it was released?<br />
PM; I haven't read all of it, only bits and pieces of it,<br />
it's a relatively biV document.<br />
JL: Two hundred pages and 1 dO think It is a bit alarmist.<br />
But listen just before we get away from the doctors,<br />
it' seeme to me that Lebor isn't terribly good a<br />
resolving white collar disputes and you would agree that<br />
this is a white collar dispute, didn't have much luck<br />
with those pilots. You're going to have your very Own<br />
pilot dispute on your hands With this one unless you do<br />
something.<br />
PM; This is the doctors yQU mean?<br />
JL: Yes.<br />
PM: The proposal for this additional training came from the<br />
AMA and the College of General Practicioners, it was a<br />
yroopl thot came to us from them. The objection to it<br />
s from a lot of younger doctorv.<br />
JL: Yes, most of them a that additional training because<br />
they want to.<br />
PM; They don't have to and it they do it they eoUrs a<br />
benefit from what's called the Family Medicine Program.<br />
JL; Why are they having a fight with you?<br />
PM: A lot of young doctors think that the system is<br />
basically there, thw unes who are disputing this,<br />
thinking the system Is there to give them the income to<br />
which they believe they have become entitled and yet the<br />
AMA itself I think, and the general Practicioners<br />
society have said that a program which does have the<br />
emphasis on deliverIng health care in ways which are<br />
more affordable for the community at large does confer<br />
upon everybody a benefit and if doctors undertake the<br />
oours~, the extra two years; they'll secure an<br />
additional income benefit from the so-called Family<br />
Medicine Program. If they don't wish to, the don't have<br />
to, so I can't quite see what the argument is about,<br />
JL: I think it would be worth keeping an eye on, frankly<br />
because I think it could be a hell of a mess.<br />
PM: Probably.<br />
JL: One you don't want.<br />
PM: Worth keeping an eye on i'm sure.<br />

JLz The. Asian.-trip; you've now been accused of tugging the<br />
forelock of Japan which conjures up a fascinating<br />
picture in one4 mind. What's your response to that, or<br />
need I ask?<br />
PM; I'm pretty happy with the results of that visit. I'd<br />
like to put Australia in a position where we can respond<br />
to the big chngees now unfolding in the region. About<br />
sixty per cent of our exports now go to North Asia John,<br />
about sixty per cent, so we are largely integrated with<br />
the region. What I was seeking to do both in Japan and<br />
Singapore was to eutablish Australia's position, to say<br />
that we wont to trade with the region. TO say we want<br />
to trade with the region, to bring the United States<br />
into the region through APEC in a more institutionally,<br />
commercially closer way thot is, to have them there not<br />
just in strategic terms, but to have them there more in<br />
invtutment and institutional terms and in so doing give<br />
Australia a more secure place in the part of the world<br />
that's growing fastest and the part of the world where<br />
most of our trade is going.<br />
JL: Yes, i know you'll be delighted to know that in your<br />
absence it seemed that the biggest worry thaT Mr Fischer<br />
and hui hat had was the fact that not one single<br />
solitary grain of Riverina rice is SOld in Japan. Mr<br />
Fisvher seemed to fail to understand that it wasn't Bold<br />
in Japan because the Japanese wouldn't let it sell in<br />
Japan because they were protecting their own markets and<br />
yet he couldn't understand about tariff rates here in<br />
AuVtralia. Did you get anywhere with rice for example,<br />
have you broken down any trade barriers at all?<br />
PM: I just made the point that if mhe GATT, this is the<br />
General Agreement on Trude and Tariffs, the thing which<br />
has been under discussion for a couple of years, this is<br />
a world trading background which is the international<br />
arrangement where we're now discuesing agriculture<br />
insisting upon is so-called tarifflcation of<br />
agriculture. That la the protective device not be<br />
quotas, but only be price devices such as tariffs.<br />
JL: What's the device that they have in Japan?<br />
PM: At the moment they have 1uotas,<br />
JL. Not tariffs?<br />
PM: No tariffs.<br />
JL: But it is protecting the industry?<br />
PM: It is, but it's not a price protection, a quota is an<br />
infiiity level of tariffs, in other wolds it doesn't<br />
come in at any price, whereas a tariff has a price. So<br />
the Europeans and the Americans want so-called<br />
tariffication of agriculture which in Japan's case<br />
TEL: </p>
<p>30. Sep. 92 18: 00 No. 008 P. 07/ 19<br />

includes rice. I argued that case to the Japanese, but<br />
again when you look at important as Mr Fiacher may think<br />
rice exports are to Japan, they are nothing in<br />
comparison to iron ore, coking coal, motor vehicle<br />
engines, all the other things that give ve 8 $ 20 billion<br />
trade with Japan and a $ 6 billion trade surplus. So I'd<br />
be preLty cOazy to go up there and say look, you can put<br />
all that asunder for rice, we are not<br />
JL: Yes, but the thing I don't understand and you can<br />
explain it to me is that we have Mr Fischer on one hand<br />
or anybody else for that matter, It'u not fair to cite<br />
him necessarily sayÂ¾ 1i that we can't eell rice in Japan,<br />
we can't sell rice in Japan because Japan proteots its<br />
industry and yet the same Mr Fischer and other People of<br />
his ilk want to free up induatry in Australia so that<br />
they can sell as many of their motor cars to us as they<br />
like. Isn't he being a bit contradictory? I moan he<br />
wants them to free up; What they're doing is obviously<br />
protecting their industry, he's not prepared to protect<br />
our induetry<br />
PM: it's a big agricultural question, A lot of the ruling<br />
pt&amp; L y tho LDP the Liberal Democratic Party of Japan<br />
a lot of ita support comes from the countryside and<br />
comes from rice growers and it's a political thing. In<br />
a sense therY-r like the National Party of Australia In<br />
some respects in teams of their rural component and<br />
their protectitig rice. In my view they're fighting a<br />
losing b ttle because rice will be as we said earlier<br />
talIrfea, that is it will have price Mechanisms applied<br />
JL; So they will have, just so we all understand, they will<br />
have on rice what we at the moment have on motor cars?<br />
PM: Exactly, but they'll have it at a level where people can<br />
bring rice to Japan and jump the barrier because the<br />
barrier will only be a price barrier, it won't be a<br />
quota barrier as it is now. At the moment they say no,<br />
no, no at any price. Whereas we're saying give us a<br />
price to ae if we can better It.<br />
JL; Ok, if they're prepared to protect their industry<br />
understandably, and you are to a degree, prepared to<br />
protect our industry, but only to a degree, why would it<br />
be that the Coalition doesn't want to protect our<br />
industry and yet they're complaining that we can't sell<br />
our prodvQk, a particular product to Japan? Japan is<br />
just doing what we should be doing.<br />
PM: Tariffs have been a long running, as long as I've been<br />
in public life John which is now twenty three years,<br />
tariffs have been an issue. What the Menzies and McEwen<br />
governmenuiL did was build a tariff wall around Australia<br />
which bsicall. y rendered Australian Industry<br />
uncompetLtLve, gave us the dearest cars in the world,<br />
gave us very high prices and didn't give us the export<br />

potential we should have had. What we did as a<br />
Government, this Governament in 1998 we started to phase<br />
tariffs down to 1992 and then a year ago in 1991 we<br />
adopted a new phase down which will take us to the year<br />
2000.<br />
JL: Ok, but if the lowering of those tariffs from 57 per<br />
cent or whatever they were in 1988-89 down to 25 per<br />
cent or whatever they are now, that should have caused a<br />
dreaoe in the cost of motor cars.<br />
PM: It has.<br />
JL: It hasn't,.<br />
PM: Yes it has.<br />
JL: No it hasn't, and the importation of motor cars has<br />
increased by 50 per cent in that perlod of time.<br />
PM: Can I say this, the Ford Company say that the basic Ford<br />
Falcon vehicle today which is i think $ 23,000 before the<br />
tariff cuts would have been $ 33,000, but the general<br />
point is I don't accept Dr Hewson's argument that you<br />
can keep a motor induotry at zero tariffs because I<br />
went to Toyota lout week tn Japan, tney're producing on<br />
the one run 300,000 vehicles. On the one run here, the<br />
best we can produce is about 38,000, in other words<br />
about one tenth.<br />
JL; The best we could do in a whole year is 300,000.<br />
PM: The best we can do in a year is 300,000 that is from six<br />
monufocturere from six models. There's not any chance<br />
In my view of the Australian motor vehicle industry<br />
staying alive at a zero tariff. Why would Toyota for<br />
instance, want to build a car in Australia with a morket<br />
this amall when it can basically Just get better<br />
economies out uC its existing lineg of production? I<br />
don't accept the zero tariff and while the Government<br />
has brought tariffs down from 253 per cent for motor<br />
qoro down to an effective rate of 35 per cent by the<br />
year 1996, it's that 35 per cent which will guarantee<br />
the viability of the Toyota investment in Melbourne, the<br />
Mitsubishi investment in Adelaide and I don't believe<br />
that those car compnniea can survive at zero. I think<br />
anybody and this includes in particular Dr Hewuun whu<br />
takes the view that it's zero and if they survive good<br />
on them, and if they don't bad luck. That simply means<br />
we won't have a mutor industry and if we don't have a<br />
motor industry we won't have a firm manufacturing base<br />
in this country.<br />
JL: So we should have a motor industry?<br />
PM: Absolutely. TEL: </p>
<p>30. Sep. 92 18: 00 No. 008 P. 09/ i:<br />
9<br />
JL: Well if we should have a motor Industry and the tariffs<br />
have been reduced at the rote they have been from 57 per<br />
cent in 1988, the cost really hasn't come down of motor<br />
care and the importation of motor cars has Increased by<br />
per cent, then surely you can't take away any more<br />
toriffe on thot.<br />
PM; We had these discussions with the motor companies in<br />
1990-91, I vaw the Executive Vle President of Ford, USA<br />
who was then in charge of the non-continental USA Ford<br />
investments and their export markets, I spoke to the<br />
Toyota company, I spoke to all the people. With a bit<br />
of whinging and moaning the long and short of it is they<br />
indicated they would live with the Government'a phase<br />
down and after we announced that in 1991, Toyota company<br />
made it's announcements. But again that is for an end<br />
point of 35 per cent protection.<br />
JL: But you're talking about coming down to 15 per cent.<br />
PM: That's 15 nominal, an effective rate of 35 per cent by<br />
the time you throw in te export faclLitation and<br />
everything else<br />
JL: Ok, if next year and what I'm saying is right because<br />
you would have known that I did te numbers, we have<br />
increased the importation of motor cars since 1988 by<br />
per cent, the small four door, four seat passenger cars,<br />
increased by 50 per cent. If we continue to increase<br />
the importation of motor cars then surely that's going<br />
to self distruct, will you then sit down with the motor<br />
industry and say look we don't seem to be selling more<br />
local cars, if we're Impofting more surely we should<br />
reassess this, are you prepared to reassess it?<br />
PM; We're exporting now $ 1 billion worth of cars since then.<br />
Since 1988 it's true that tariffs have come down and It<br />
is true that imported care have come up, but we are now<br />
exporting a billion aollars Worth of motor vehicles and<br />
motor vehicle engine$ and components.<br />
JL: I understand all that's true.<br />
PM; It's all part of the run John. To say to a motor firm,<br />
you make a new engine but you can export so many hundred<br />
thjousand units of this to Japan or SOmewhere else makes<br />
it viable for them. So it's the total package which<br />
they're living with and the Indications we have is tnat<br />
they are living. We've got no indication from any of<br />
the companies; Toyota, Ford, General Motors, any of them<br />
that even though this is putting structural pressures on<br />
them that in the end they can live with it. What I'm<br />
saying is they can't live with zero, they can live with<br />
an effeotive rate of 35, a nominal rate of 15, but tney<br />
can't live with zero and that's what Dr lIewson is<br />
seying, r'be qayiI) g give them zero anO they should take<br />
it like a man and know what's good for them.<br />

<p>30. Sep. 92 18: 00 No. 008 P. 10/ 19<br />
JL; Ok, if next year all indications are that it's not<br />
working the way tt should work, are you flexible? Are<br />
you prepared to sit down with the motor industry and<br />
reassess it, that's the question?<br />
PM; But we were flexible. The time to have asked me that<br />
was two years ago in 1990 when basically we sat down and<br />
said look where should this end point be? Should it be<br />
an effective rate of 35, an effective rate of 50, an<br />
effective rate of 20. That's when the flexibility was<br />
displayed by the Goverinment and we put into place know<br />
what we thinK, well it's a cnange from the year 1988 to<br />
1996-97, it's a very long Change, it's nearly a decade<br />
of Qhange. In other words it gives companies a decade<br />
to adjust.<br />
JL; Yes, you're telling me that you've been flexible, but<br />
you're not answering the question, are you going to<br />
continue to be flexible?<br />
PM; We don't have to be beoause the things announced.<br />
JL: So the answer ia no?<br />
PM; No.<br />
JL: That the decision is made and that's immovable.<br />
PM: Absolutely, because we've got it right and the proof of<br />
the pudding is the fact OLuat Toyota ie going to invest<br />
$ 800 million in Victoria and it did it after we made the<br />
announcement. But by the same token, the Government<br />
should be user friendly to the industry and that is<br />
where they do run into problems, we try and sort them<br />
out for them and again we've done that in these export<br />
facilitation plane, that's one of the reasons why now<br />
the Japanese company are selling the motor vehicle<br />

part of those imports of care are Mecedes cars, but<br />
there is a credit for Australia; they are now one of the<br />
biggest markets for Australian aluminium wheels out of<br />
Adelaide. So we give them a benefit which allows them<br />
to import more competitively, but part of the benefit is<br />
a cost for them; that is they take loads of aluminium<br />
wheels for Mecedee. You see Mecedee Benz cars running<br />
around in Europe, but running around on aluminium wheels<br />
made in Adelaidu.<br />
JL: What about the rural sector, what help are you going to<br />

for trhe gucal sector?<br />
PM: tic McLachlan who is the Liberal spokesman on industry<br />
was formerly the President of the National Farmers<br />
Federation and the zarmers have said for years that the<br />
tot. iff is a monkey on their back, it's a cost that they<br />
as primary exporters have had to wear, that is largely<br />
true. But it ia a case ( f tiever going to extremes,<br />

taking the view that tariffs should go to zero, tO have<br />
the farm lobby get square with manufacturers is not<br />
wise, it's not sensible and I don't think It's<br />
Australian. We've all got to git on in this country and<br />
we've got to make sure people get their share of the<br />
cake, but at Vhe same time there's got to be a bit of<br />
give and take. Now if the farm community given<br />
expression by people like Mr McLachian saying look we've<br />
taking the high tariff medicine for years witn Mr<br />
MOEwen, paradoxically was leader of the National Party<br />
and Mr Fraser and the reeV of them, now's our chance to<br />
get square so we'll chop into the car companies with a<br />
zero tariff, whlln you've got the mining industry arguing<br />
the same<br />
JL: out how will that benefit the rural industry?<br />
PM; The cost of tariff protection is the rural industry<br />
are paid on an international basis for their products,<br />
they get the international price for wheat,<br />
international price for various products. Whatever<br />
input costs they bear, tre higher input costs have come<br />
by the protection which local industry Aave had by % ne<br />
tariff. They've haa to pay the tariff yet not be<br />
recompensed by the internatiOnal market. So they argue<br />
they've carried the burden, too great a burden, and that<br />
has been largely true. but with a tariff coming down<br />
now they've really hod a very good the farmers have<br />
kicked an enormous goal in the last six to eight yeazby<br />
a reduction in tariffs. To go and try and drive the<br />
nails into the manufacturing industry and into the car<br />
industry by zero tariffs is on the part of soMe ex-farm<br />
leaders like Mr McLachlan going right over the top to<br />
try and extract a bounty or a penalty based on old 1970s<br />
prejudices about how much the farm lobby paid in<br />
tariffs. It shows no wisdom and in my view no<br />
comprehenslon of the fact that the farm conmunity have<br />
picked up an enormous benefit in competitiveness, now<br />
lower tariffs and they should live with the Government<br />
phase down.<br />
JL: Getting back to the original question le what are you<br />
going to do about the rural sector. The short answer is<br />
nothing.<br />
PM; No, that is a different thing. I thought you meant in<br />
relation to tariffs. The problem with the rural sector<br />
is not of their own making, some of thpir own making.<br />
There ore three thiigs: the ones nor of their own<br />
making Iiavo btuj) drought, the second has been wheat<br />
prices noL of their own making, and the one of their<br />
own making has been wool. They decided to double the<br />
price of wool, and the world sai* ' thank you we don't<br />
wnt; U it; tiiyinue'. So they let the atock pile build up<br />
and finally we are to abandon the wool price scneme * no<br />
that hurt farmer; s on the way through and it's now<br />
starting to improve. But wool prices have started to<br />
atabJlRSe again, wheat prices haven't been too bad* The<br />

Government, we guaranteed $ 3 billion to underwrite the<br />
wool stock pile, we spent about $ 1 1/ 2 billion in<br />
national Interest cover or insurance on wheat sales in<br />
the markets that might not have otherwise been<br />
commercial. The Government has basically put about<br />
billion on the line for the farm community. And alsO<br />
things like structural adjustment, rural adjustment<br />
schemes ( BAS), that is helping farmers who are really<br />
nuver going to be viable to get off the lend and pay<br />
them, help them leave, to pay their Gebts out and also<br />
carry on financially...<br />
JL: What happens to that land?<br />
PM: Well some of it should never have been farmed, only some<br />
Of it was farmed at a time when wheat prices were very<br />
high, you could take eub-optimal farms and make them<br />
work. But once the surt of cost of interest rose and<br />
then the prices came down, it came, again, sub-optimal.<br />
JL: So are you saying that the Government will buy these<br />
people out of the farms?<br />
PM: Well we help them, that is the people, there are two<br />
parts of the yural adjustment scheme RAS so called. One<br />
IS carry on finance, for -to'e who -re viable, but who<br />
have just bud difficulties we give them concessionl<br />
loans, but for those woo know they have got no chance,<br />
we help them get out of it.<br />
JL: And what do you do with the land?<br />
pmt Well boeioally it goes back to, it ts either aggregated<br />
into bigger parcels, or it is not farmed anymore,<br />
JL: What happtv to it them, it just becomes Crown land?<br />
PM; No, it probably ends up being privately owned, but it<br />
may be farmed less intensively, See our soils are Often<br />
not strong, and in some places people who have been<br />
using land for agricultural purposes, which might work<br />
in the very htgh paid seasons, but doesn't work in the<br />
low paid seasons.<br />
3L: By the lOOk of it you'll be going to the Polls with<br />
unemployment at more than 10 per cent, it seems that the<br />
argument concerni~ ig unemployment has shifted, that<br />
rathor we've got involved in tariffs and your overseas<br />
Vivit, wluoh was very important to us admittedly, but we<br />
seem to forgetting about unemployment. Hopefully you're<br />
not.<br />
PM: No and that's why the Government has got all the<br />
instruments at its disposal flat chat to try and do<br />
something about it. We've got fiscal policy. We've got<br />
$ 2 billion being spent in this year from the One Nation<br />
statement, most of it being spent from 1 July. we've<br />
got the additional spending in the Budget. We've got<br />

interat rates at low levels. The whole thing Is geared<br />
up now to basically see the economy rise, And we are<br />
coming into recovery. In the year to June the economy<br />
grew by 1.6 per cents By contrast in the eame year the<br />
British economy contracted, declined by 1.5 per cent.<br />
So we are actually now doing better in terms of growth<br />
then most comparable countries, And this year we hope<br />
to gee that strengthen to about 3 per cent.<br />
JL: Some figures come out yesterday from the Bureau of<br />
Statistics, that I imagine would have been brought to<br />
your attention, showing unemployment amongst migrants at<br />
12.5 per cent, with Australian born workers 9.9 per<br />
cent. Now isn't that a bit crazy, I mean more migrants<br />
are receiving dole payments than Australian born<br />
workers?<br />
PM; it's partly the problems that migrants have and that's<br />
why we have considerably stopped up spending onEnglish<br />
as a secondangu~ ago, that program, to deal with'<br />
d id v a nt' e, whether the disadvantage be with migranta<br />
Bi' 6i) ier workers, to give them a chance to get back Into<br />
the workforce. But employment will grow as the economy<br />
grows. The link between growth in the general economy,<br />
growth in GDP and employment is such a tight link. Onoe<br />
we start seting that growth in employment coming., But<br />
John the other thing ie, Is the country is more<br />
productive. Now yesterday I went to two places In<br />
Victoria. I join Joan Kirner and went to the<br />
Williamstown dockyard where AMECON have just handed over<br />
the second frigate to the Navy, built under cost and<br />
under time, and the Navy told me it's the first time<br />
they have had a ship presented to them without faults on<br />
its ship trials. Of higher quality of the same ship<br />
built in the United States.<br />
JLt OK, but we are rather &amp; hifting from the point.<br />
Pm: I just want to make Chis point here. The same in<br />
respect of clothing, textile and footwear. Now in both<br />
companies, the productivity of that plant had gone up<br />
800 per cent. That means we are getting more product<br />
from fewer people, in other words we are now a very<br />
productive oountry, businesses are stripped down, but<br />
the flip side of that productivity; that is getting more<br />
output from fewer people is that there are fewer people<br />
in work. So the answer has to be that we've got to grow<br />
the economy even faster to take those people up.<br />
JLi Yes, wouldn't another answer be to stop bringing people<br />
to this country if the can't get a job when they get<br />
here? if we've got 12.5 per cent migrants unemployed,<br />
12.5 per cent as opposed to 9.9 per cent of people who<br />
were bqrn in Australia, isn't that a nonsense? That<br />
we're simply briniging people from other parts of the<br />
world in order to pay them money? </p>

people here then they can bring they're mothers and<br />

3L: And we tax payers pay for them.<br />
PM: The thing to the level of unemployment amongst migrants<br />
is admittedly higher than the general community, but not<br />
that much higher. A part of that reason is basically<br />
because they're disadvantaged one way or another and the<br />
anlswer is to do two things. Deal with the disadvantage,<br />
be it English or what have you or the teaching of<br />
English.<br />

if you go to a lot of technical colleges around Sydney<br />

can't get a job and are going to be disadvantaged? It<br />

PM; I know, but look they're not a majority and those who<br />
are many of them are women who were formerly at homne<br />
and are nlow looking for work and they've gone to train<br />
themselves and good on them. But of the reason that<br />
unemployment iv In Australia over 10 per Gent is because<br />
of the very high number of people looking for work. If<br />
we had the same participation rate, that is the number<br />
of people looking for work as say the United States has<br />
got, we'd have an unemployment rate of about 5.5 per<br />
cent or 6 per cent. In fact we had the same<br />
participation rate today that John Howard had in 1982,<br />
we'd have an unemployment rate of 6.5 per Cent. The<br />
reason it's 10.5 is because the ' 80a were so full of<br />
employment that people, not unreasonably, have raised<br />
their expectations about getting a job and are looking<br />
f or work and good on them.<br />
JLs That's fine, but then we had that thing that was called<br />
the recession we had to have which was announced by you.<br />
Pm: it was certainly the slow down we had to have, we<br />
couldn't go on importing.<br />
JL: it wao your word -recession..<br />
PM: I know, we couldn't go on spending twice our rate of<br />
production and that's what we were doing. We had<br />
spending running at 9 per cent end production at<br />
john let's make this point and it's the point I made in<br />
Asia Auritralia has made the great economic<br />
transition, in 1982 14 per cent of Australia's<br />
pcJuwtion went to exports, today it's 23 per cent.<br />
That is nearly a quarter of everything the country<br />
produces goes to exports, the difference in that is 9<br />
per centage points of the total economy, 9 per cent of<br />
GDP. That today is worth $ 36,000 million; $ 36 billion.<br />
Could you imagine where Australia would be now had we<br />
left with the old Liberal policies of the ' 809 with $ 36<br />
billion out of our trade accounts? Yesterday we had the<br />
Balance of Payment figure out, $ 900 million for the<br />
month, about $ 14 billion for the year, imagine where<br />
we'd be if there was a $ 36 billion gap in our exports<br />
that now exists which didn't. exist a decade ago? I'll<br />
tell you where'd we'd be, we'd be prostrate. We'd be<br />
like South America, we would have been one of those<br />
banana republics you and I talked about in the middle<br />
180s. We saved ourselves in the 809; nlow sure we've had<br />
a recession on the way through and we're now growing,<br />
but now the place is much more fully employed, we had<br />
phenomenal rates of growth In employment in the<br />
when I become Treasurer the total production of<br />
Australia was worth $ 200 billion, that woo in 1983,<br />

we've got 7,6 million In employment. We've mode the<br />
huge switch to export, we've actually made the great<br />
leap that we didn't think out of the tariff well, we<br />
bounded over it right into Asia, right Into those<br />
exports markets,<br />

did when you were in Asia is going to make it even<br />

JL: out It doesn't make life easier for those people who are<br />
listening to us all over Australia now who haven't got a<br />

We're not going to say what Dr Hewson's ay-Tfyoure<br />

the voluntary agencies, down to St Vincent do Paul or<br />
the Salvos, we're saying you still have a decent social<br />
security system, we pick you up and carry you along if<br />
you happen to be unemployed.<br />
JL: I know you' re adying that, but there are still a lot of<br />
people who are hungry and all the talk about overseas<br />
trade might be tremendously important from a univeraial<br />
point of view, but from a national point of view for<br />
thos people who are hungry, the place doesn't look to<br />
good. And look at the attitude of the place at the<br />
moment, look at the attitude of Australia, a third of<br />
the people like you, a third of the people like John<br />
Kewson and a third of the people don't know who they<br />
like so that means that both of have virtually got two<br />

the German Deutschmark and French Franc, in the end they<br />
couldn't got the productivity in their country out so<br />
its busted out of the link, they've been in a chaotic<br />
financial position. Look at us last week Britain<br />
dropped its interest rates by one per centage point and<br />
it was news all around the world. we've had 13 one per<br />
centage points changes since 1990 accomplished with<br />
total smoothness, we' vo had a 12 or 13 per cant decline<br />

happened over there? They're growing minus 1.6 they are<br />
actually contracting, they haven't made the </p>

technological leap, they can't jump into Europe; compare<br />
with them say to us, we've made the great change.<br />

there's 90 per cent of people in employment, they've got<br />
lower interest rates by 8, 9 10 per centage points than<br />
tWo years ago, the economy is now growing somewhere in<br />
the order Of1.5, 2 per cent heading towards 3,<br />
