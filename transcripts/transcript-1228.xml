    <content><![CDATA[<p>FOR PRESS P. M. No. 11/1966</p>
<p>I have given careful thought to my future in the lightÂ of what seems best for the Government and the country. In theÂ result, I have decided to resign from the Prime MinistershipÂ forthwith.</p>
<p>It is my duty to my colleagues and to the AustralianÂ people whose acceptance of me as leader for so many years has beenÂ a great source of strength to me to state as plainly as possible Â my reasons for this decision. It is also my duty to the electorsÂ of Kooyong, whose generous loyalty to me, in spite of my rareÂ appearcnces in my own constituency, has enabled me to perform myÂ public duties without personal electoral anxiety. I shall alwaysÂ be grateful to them.</p>
<p>I have been Prime Minister for a total of over 18Â rears. Two of these years were in the war period. Sixteen haveÂ been consecutive since 1949. Prior to 1949, I led the OppositionÂ for six years, during a period in which we were heavily outnumbered,Â and my own responsibilities and labours were both intense andÂ sustained.</p>
<p>During the last 16 years I have never taken a realÂ holiday; on a few occasions a fortnight or more, mostly only aÂ few days.</p>
<p>Since I became Leader of the Opposition at the end ofÂ 1943, I have been responsible for the conduct of no less than eightÂ general elections, in addition to two separate Senate Elections.Â The strain of election campaigns is something that the onlookerÂ cannot be expected fully to understand.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the complexities of government, both domesticÂ and international, have grown enormously.</p>
<p>It would be idle for me to pretend that all these yearsÂ and tasks have not affected me. There is an accumulating wearÂ and tear of which I have been increasingly conscious for some years.Â The thought of going through another election campaign would depressÂ me. Speech-making has become a burden, since every speech presentsÂ its own problems. Though I still work long hours, IÂ can no longerÂ sustain the very long hours of work which once delighted me.</p>
<p>In short, I am tired; my pace has slowed down; IÂ could not properly continue in office for very much longer and atÂ the same time do justice to the growing problems of the nation.</p>
<p>By the normal date of the next election in DecemberÂ of this yearÂ I would be 72 years old. Feeling as IÂ do, I wouldÂ not be justifiedÂ in asking the people to re-elect me for a further Â term. It would not be fair to them, or, for that matter, toÂ myself. For I would not be willing to contest such an electionÂ without having decided that, if successful, I would remain for aboutÂ two years at least after the election. To do otherwise would be unthinkable and electorally deceptive.Â </p>
<p>So my choice has narrowed down to this. Should IÂ continue to make myself available for the next three years orÂ thereabouts, or go now, at a time when my succesor will have theÂ better part of a year in which to establish his own leadership,Â Cabinet, and policy. Our people have become accustomed to me, forÂ better or worse, for so many years that it would be grossly unfairÂ to my successor to give him insufficient time to make his own markÂ in his own way. IÂ am sure that the right thing for me to do isÂ to make way now. There are extremely able people in and supportingÂ the Government. They will continue to have my confidence and, I hope and believe, that of the electors.</p>
<p>As for my own future, in such years as I may hope toÂ have, I would like to say this. Thirty-seven years of ParliamentaryÂ life, both State and Federal, twenty-six of them as a Minister orÂ Prime Minister, have given me little if anyÂ private life as most Â people know it. I would like a period of freedom, without strain;Â not,Â of courseÂ abandoning my interest in world and AustralianÂ affairs, but without the constant pressures which public politicalÂ office inevitably entails.</p>
<p>I am more grateful than I can ever say for the generousÂ support which I have enjoyed so long, both inside and outsideÂ Parliament. Even in defeat there was much to learn, and manyÂ personal encouragements to appreciate.</p>
<p>I hope that the people, not only in the GovernmentÂ parties but all over Australia, will accept my announcement as oneÂ of a decision taken after deep and anxious thought, weighing myÂ duties properly, and with the interests of cur country, in aÂ period of rapid changes and acute problems, much in my heart andÂ mind. Beyond doubt, the affairs ofÂ the world at large, and of Â Australia in a period of dramatic development, are increasing inÂ weight and complexity. They demand the services of men and womenÂ of ull vigour and flexibility of mind, feeling at their best andÂ able to do their best.</p>
<p>Before I " sign off" I would wish to say how much I haveÂ owed over the years toÂ my wife, who has made great sacrifices ofÂ family life in what both she and I have believed to be the publicÂ interest. You have our thanks and our good wishes.</p>
<p><br />CANBERRA,<br />20Â January, 1966.</p>
