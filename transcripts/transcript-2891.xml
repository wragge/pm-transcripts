THE PRIME MINISTER'S PRESS CONFERENCE<br />
AT PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA<br />
TUESDAY, 10 APRIL, 1973<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Thanks ladies and gentlemen. There were<br />
a few procedural matters. There were about a score of decisions<br />
which I can tell you from this morning's Cabinet meeting.<br />
It will save your time here if I tell you the names of the<br />
Ministers from whom you can get the details. They are expecting<br />
your questions. There are a couple that I can give you myself.<br />
Yesterday Mr Hamer, the Premier of Victoria, telegraphed<br />
me with the suggestion that we might follow up what Mr Crean had<br />
said about State jurisdiction in matters of prices by having a<br />
Premiers Conference to discuss a national incomes and prices<br />
policy. The Cabinet accepted the suggestion this morning.<br />
I have telegraphed Mr Hamer. I think he has released the telegrams<br />
at 5.00 this afternoon. I was proposing to but I was in the House<br />
as you know. We've suggested that there should be a Premiers<br />
Conference to discuss prices and incomes matters and all other<br />
aspects of inflation. I have suggested Friday, 4 May. That is the<br />
earliest week-day that my overseas commitments or the sittings of<br />
the House would permit me to attend. I've suggested that Mr Crean<br />
and Mr Enderby ( because he has jurisdiction over the territories)<br />
should accompany me.<br />
Cabinet also decided to hold again this year the usual economic<br />
consultations, presumably in June. The same organisations with<br />
whom consultations were held last June will be invited to have<br />
consultations. We shall, however, ask the various consumer<br />
authorities and associations to confer with us.<br />
We decided on the forms of revaluation assistance to secondary<br />
industry. They will be on similar lines to the scheme already<br />
announced to primary industry and will be limited to cases of<br />
hardship. Dr. Cairns will give you the details. Mr Bryant will<br />
give you the details on the establishment of an Aboriginal Land<br />
Fund. Also on the system of mining royalties on Aboriginal<br />
reserves in the Northern Territory. Senator Murphy will give you<br />
the details of a scheme for a $ 2 million grant to the States to<br />
supplement legal aid services this year. Also details of legislation<br />
relating to offences at sea. The situation is that if somebody from<br />
Australia were to take a pot-shot at visitors, in say, the Gulf of<br />
Carpentaria beyond the ordinary territorial limits, there is no<br />
Australian legislation making it an offence. Mr Jones will tell<br />
you about the foreign ownership of air service organisations and<br />
airport business concessions. Mr Daly on proposed legislation to<br />
provide two seats in the House of Representatives for the Australian<br />
Capital Territory, and two senators from each of the Territories<br />
those senators to be elected on the proportional system and to be<br />
elected, both of them, on the same date as there is an election<br />
for the House of Representatives. Dr. Cass on the Joint<br />
Parliamentary Committee on Environment. v .2/ </p>
<p>Mr Stewart will give you the details of legislation to regulate<br />
the operations of travel agents. Also amendments to the<br />
Public Works Committee Act so that the Committee only has to deal<br />
with works which are estimated to cost $ 2 million or more. The<br />
establishment of a national archives system. Those two latter matters-<br />
Mr Stewart will be representing Senator Willessee. Senator Bishop<br />
will give you the proposals for reasons to be given for the<br />
decisions under the Repatriation Act and the Seamen's War Pension<br />
and Allowances Act.<br />
Also the expansion of the capacity of Repatriation hospitals<br />
to allow their use for non-repatriation patients. Mr Crean will<br />
tell you of income tax treatment of domiciliary care benefits.<br />
Senator Cavanagh on behalf of Senator Wriedt will tell you about<br />
amendments to the Fisheries Act and the Continental Shelf Living<br />
Natural Resources Act. Mr Bowen, the proposed amendments to the<br />
Posts and Telegraph Act. Mr Hayden, additional computer capacity<br />
for the Department of Social Security, and Dr. Patterson the joint<br />
study with'Western Australia on the Pilbara.<br />
Are there any questions?<br />
Q: Prime Minister, if I could refer to statements made by you<br />
in the House last Thursday that an ASIO representative had given<br />
a wrong report on an inter-departmental meeting held on 2 March,<br />
what consideration is being given by the Government to protecting<br />
ordinary citizens against incorrect reports about them by ASIO,<br />
and in the case of a person seeking employment in the Public Service<br />
but is rejected because of an adverse report from ASIO, would the<br />
Government give that person the opportunity of examining information<br />
in the report and the right of appeal against any errors in it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The Government is committed as you know in the<br />
terms of the Australian Labor Party's platform to providing a means<br />
of judicial appeal against decisions which are based upon security<br />
reports. We won't be able to bring in the legislation this session,<br />
but you will remember what the platform had to say about that,<br />
generally in the context of the proposed Superior Court.<br />
Perhaps I should say this: the reports which ASIO makes are given<br />
to, say, the heads of Commonwealth Departments and also to the<br />
Department of Immigration respectively for prospective public<br />
servants who are to be appointed or existing public servants who<br />
are to be promoted and migrants who seek naturalisation. The<br />
Heads of the Departments make what use they think fit of those<br />
reports. The ASIO isn't an executive body.<br />
Q: On the prices and incomes question: do you favour the<br />
national prices income policy that of the national Labor<br />
Government? PRIME MINISTER: I'll discuss that in more detail after the<br />
meeting with the Premiers.<br />
Q: Do you feel in any way that this is merely a pre-election<br />
gimmick by Mr Hamer?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, I do not. There are different views of<br />
course on the efficacy of prices and incomes policies but in the<br />
short term such as President Nixon brought in for I think six<br />
months and then extended for a further period, there is good reason<br />
to believe that they can be effective, but I want to make it plain<br />
3/ </p>
<p>that we don't believe that prices and incomes policies are the<br />
only cure for inflation. There are a very great number of aspects<br />
of inflation, some, of course, within Federal jurisdiction such<br />
as various forms of subsidies or deductions, and some in the State<br />
field. Clearly however, in our Federal system, if there is to be an<br />
effective policy on inflation and you'll notice we'll use the<br />
phrase "~ all other aspects of inflation" it is necessary to have<br />
a combined Federal and State program. Mr Hamer for instance said<br />
" with the relevant constitutional powers divided as they are between<br />
the Federal Government and the State Governments, the implementation<br />
of such a policy could only be effective given close understAnding<br />
and co-operation between the Commonwealth and the States".<br />
He is quite right.<br />
Q: Sir, how about incomes? Nobody has the constitutional power<br />
in respect of incomes, do they?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No. The Federal Parliament could not pass laws<br />
freezing incomes except for its own employees. State Parliaments<br />
could only pass legislation freezing incomes in respect to people<br />
covered by State awards. There would be an immediate application<br />
to the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission for<br />
any persons whose incomes were so frozen.<br />
Q: Do you favour an overall freeze Sir? Incomes<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Let me discuss it at this meeting.<br />
Q: Mr Hamer's been the one who's called most for a Premiers<br />
Conference. Do you think in view of his coming election that he<br />
will try to bring up the whole matter of finances and<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, no. He's not suggested that in the<br />
telegram he sent yesterday or the letter which, I presume,<br />
might have come today, but which the telegram yesterday embodied.<br />
Q: Would you be prepared to discuss these matters with them,<br />
since<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The meeting will be on the subjects of the<br />
telegram.<br />
Q: Will the Premiers Conference chaired by you be open to the<br />
Press? PRIME MINISTER: They always are. Even my predecessors had<br />
Premiers Conferences open to the Press.<br />
Q: It's very rare<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Aren't you thinking of the Loan Council?<br />
Q: No, sir.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well I'll see what the Premiers Conference says<br />
on this.<br />
Q: Sir, can I ask you a question about your visit to London<br />
please? I think you said some time ago it's not possible for<br />
the State Parliaments to abolish appeals to the Privy Council.<br />
That would need the approval of the Queen on the advice of the<br />
British Government, Sir, will you be asking the British Goyernment </p>
<p>to advise the Queen to abolish appeals from the States to the<br />
Privy Council?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: We will be discussing this Mr Heath and'I<br />
and I hope that we will arrange we mightn't be able to arrange<br />
it during the brief time I'm in London but I would aim to<br />
promote the position where this is determined by arrangements<br />
between the British and the Australian Governments.<br />
Q: Prime Minister, another question... ( British Broadcasting<br />
Corporation) on the eve of your visit to Britain, how would<br />
you characterise in general terms the differences between your<br />
Government's attitudes towards Britain and that of the previous<br />
Liberal Government?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I suppose I'd better be getting used to these<br />
general questions it was the German T. V. last week that asked<br />
a similarly wide question. I think Britain should realise that<br />
the change of government in Australia after 23 years of unchanged<br />
government has brought to a head a whole number of matters which<br />
it accumulated over many years. It's true that in many respects,<br />
economic matters in particular, trade matters, the links between<br />
Britain and Australia are much thinner than they used to be,<br />
but I don't think that Britain should think that there's any<br />
lessening of the other ties the ties of sentiment between<br />
Australia and Britain. Australians regard Britain with veryi<br />
great affection, but very obviously, for geographic, historic,<br />
commercial reasons, the ties are less formal, less institutional<br />
than they were.<br />
Q: Can you be slightly more specific, Prime minister. What is<br />
the future of the British investment in Australia in the light<br />
of what's been called the new nationalism?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes, there'd be no difference in the Australian<br />
Government's attitude towards investment from Britain than there<br />
is towards investment from any other country. Britain, I don't<br />
think, any longer expects to have any particular privilege<br />
or immunity in Australia. Britain realises that Australia is<br />
a completely independent country and Britain would, I'm sure,<br />
realise that the attitude towards overseas investment in Australia<br />
from whatever source is much the same as the attitude towards<br />
overseas investment from overseas including Britain became in<br />
Canada under Diefenbaker and his successors. Very obviously<br />
Australia wants overseas investment where that will give her access<br />
to skills which she hasn't got in sufficient quantity herself or<br />
give her access to markets which she can't penetrate adequately<br />
by herself, but we are becoming more selective in investment from<br />
overseas. Australia is a very safe place for investment. We believe<br />
that we ought to have some say in where the investment goes.<br />
Q: Prime Minister, the judicial inquiry that Mr Snedden proposed<br />
that you have rejected in the interests of<br />
PRIME MINISTER: the House rejected that...<br />
Q: you said in the interests of the former Government. You're<br />
not generally quite so charitable. Is there some other reason?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, I gave the reasons.. 9. </p>
<p>Q: Sir, in the A-M program on the A. B. C. today, Labor Minister<br />
Cameron very trenchantly criticised the Treasury wholly on the<br />
advice given by the Treasury to the Reserve Bank, and I quote:<br />
" Almost every pred-iction the Treasury and the Reserve Bank make<br />
even about simple things usually turns out to be wrong, so don't<br />
bewilder me by asking me questions about what the Reserve Bank<br />
should have done or is going to do or what the Treasury experts<br />
are recommending". Do you share Mr Cameron' s views on the<br />
inefficiency of the advice given by the Treasury?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I never doubt the accuracy with which you<br />
represent the views expressed by my colleagues. I can't believe<br />
that Mr Cameron could have said anything so irresponsible.<br />
Q: It's in the transcri pt, sir.<br />
Q: Mr Whitlam, how strong is the Labor Party's commitment to<br />
low interest rates if the needs of economic management were to<br />
dictate perhaps that higher interest rates were necessary?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The only excuse I can see for high interest<br />
rates is inflation. We hope to keep both low.<br />
Q: Sir, has your Government taken any action or will it take<br />
action in the United Nations or elsewhere over the gaoling after<br />
the secret trial in Salisbury of the journalist, Peter Niesewand,<br />
and could I. invite your opinion?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The attitude I must express on any conduct by<br />
the rebel regime in Zembabwee is the same as that expressed by my<br />
predecessors. Legally it is still a British colony. Accordingly<br />
any representations that Australia makes must go through Britain.<br />
Britain has already protested. The Australian Government will be<br />
supporting all the resolutions which the United Nations has hitherto<br />
passed on the Smith regime and I would imagine be supporting any<br />
further measures which are found necessary to bring it to acceptable<br />
courses of conduct. Perhaps I should make it more pointed there.<br />
The Australian Government would not have any communications with<br />
the Smith regime. our predecessors didn't, to their credit.<br />
We certainly shall not.<br />
Q: Mr Whitlam, there was an announcement today on the banking<br />
arrangements for Papua New Guinea but there was no mention of whether<br />
New Guinea should have its own currency. Will this question arise<br />
soon and have you any views on it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: It's only a matter of time isn't it? Of course<br />
New Guinea will be having its own currency but it's not my province<br />
to express a view on it. This is a matter which is determined<br />
between the two countries. Nauru, for instance, still uses<br />
Australian currency. Maybe New Guinea will for some time.<br />
Q: In view of the continuing increase in job vacancies will you<br />
support an increase in the migration intake in the next financial<br />
year PRIME MINISTER: This hasn't been discussed by Cabinet in the<br />
light of the latest employment figures. That report which the<br />
Department of Urban and Regional Development has produced and which some<br />
of you have secured really comes to the nub of our migration problems.<br />
The migrants can't be told where they'll go. They do, in fact, go </p>
<p>to Sydney and Melbourne and the most crucial urban problems in<br />
Australia occur in Sydney and Melbourne and one of the big<br />
contributors to those problems is migration. In general terms,<br />
fewer migrants will be coming to Australia.<br />
Q: Thank you, Mr Whitlam. Does your expression of confidence<br />
in Senator Murphy's incident mean that you intend leaving him in<br />
control of ASIO or have you considered an ASIO report directly<br />
to you in future?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The administrative arrangements orders make the<br />
Attorney-General responsible for ASIO. The phone-tapping<br />
legislation makes the Attorney-General responsible for ASIO.<br />
Q: Prime Minister, following on your answer to Bill Norman<br />
regarding the report that.....<br />
You said Cabinet had not discussed this in relationship to the<br />
latest employment figures. Has it discussed the overall question<br />
of migration and do you agree that the Urban Affairs report could<br />
point to a suspension of migration for a period?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No. There'll be no suspension. Do you mean a<br />
cessation of all migration? We are concentrating as we promised<br />
on family reunion instead of government recruiting. We are not<br />
intending in any way to stop family reunion or to deter family<br />
reunion. The migrants who are happiest here, the ones who stay<br />
here longest are those who already have relatives here and who are<br />
sponsored by those relatives, they will still be coming. But we<br />
will not, as our predecessors were accustomed to do, sponsor<br />
migrants as a Government.<br />
Q: This is finished. We will not be sponsoring any migrants<br />
by the Government?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well I won't go as far as that, but the emphasis<br />
has changed as you know. We won't be stopping migrants who've<br />
already been promised a passage or whom their relatives here are<br />
hoping to nominate. There are proposals for there are still<br />
programs for the Government paying for people whose skills are<br />
needed here but there's not the old blanket, you know, all<br />
applicants from some countries being able to get passages and so on. </p>
