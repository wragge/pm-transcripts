CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
ALP STATE CONFERENCE<br />
SYDNEY 11 JUNE 1989<br />
Delegates, Before I turn to address my main theme today, I want to say<br />
something about the events of the past week which have so<br />
dramatically captured the world's attention: the tragedy<br />
which has been unfolding in China.<br />
Ever since Gough Whitlam made his dramatic visit to China as<br />
Opposition Leader in 1972, successive Australian Governments<br />
have put enormous effort into developing a genuinely<br />
constructive relationship with China, built on our mutual<br />
interests and respect.<br />
I have personally devoted much time and energy to the<br />
relationship with China, and up until this point it has been<br />
a most valuable and rewarding effort.<br />
We have worked tirelessly with our Chinese friends as they<br />
embarked upon and progressively implemented a far sighted<br />
program of reform which has brought great benefit to the<br />
people of China.<br />
It is my sincere hope that China will get back onto that<br />
course, enabling a continuation of the high level of<br />
cooperation that has been so productive for both our<br />
countries.<br />
But the events that have taken place in China over the past<br />
week cast a dark shadow over that.<br />
It is still too early to make an accurate assessment of<br />
where things might now go and the implications for the<br />
region. But the sheer scale, callousness and barbarity of the<br />
slaughter in Beijing cannot but affect substantially the<br />
international standing of the leaders who ordered and<br />
condoned such action. </p>
<p>They stand condemned by their own people and by all<br />
countries with a concern for the fundamental rights and<br />
dignity of human beings. That concern transcends national<br />
boundaries. The Australian Government has taken firm and decisive steps<br />
to underline to those who perpetrated this massacre that<br />
their action cannot be cost-free and cannot be neatly<br />
compartmentalised. Clearly, the action we and others have<br />
taken will need to be kept under review against developments<br />
in China itself.<br />
However, as I have said, it is my hope that sanity will<br />
prevail and that true leadership will once again emerge in<br />
China. I am confident that all delegates present here today<br />
would join with me in that sentiment.<br />
We extend, too, our sympathy to the Chinese-Australian<br />
community, sharing their profound sense of mourning for<br />
those who have lost their lives, and for those whose ideals<br />
and aspirations for their nation have been so barbarously<br />
crushed. Delegates, Almost 100 years ago, the Australian Labor Party was founded<br />
on a deep and enduring commitment to the creation of a more<br />
just society.<br />
Through the succeeding decades, as our Party was organised<br />
at the State and national levels, that commitment never died<br />
and it never diminished.<br />
But it was when Labor Parties began to receive the electoral<br />
mandate of the people, and were called upon to form<br />
Governments, that Labor's real task started: translating<br />
its commitment into programs and policies for the betterment<br />
of Australian society.<br />
It's one of the healthy features of our Party and it's<br />
certainly a feature that distinguishes us from our<br />
opponents that we tend to spend a lot of time analysing<br />
the rate of our progress towards that goal, and debating the<br />
merits and demerits of particular strategies.<br />
But that only shows how seriously we take our<br />
responsibilities to those who elect us, those who support us<br />
and those who need us.<br />
This state of New South Wales knows better than most the<br />
dynamism of these Labor Governments and the magnitude of<br />
their achievements over the years.<br />
At the Federal level, being in Government is, for us, still<br />
a relatively rare experience. Since Menzies defeated<br />
Chifley in 1949 we have led Australia for less than ten<br />
years. </p>
<p>So we have not acquired the born-to-rule disdain, or<br />
indulged in the profligacy of lost opportunities, that<br />
characterised the decades of conservative rule.<br />
When we do win Government we are determined to stay in<br />
Government not for its own sake but because we have that<br />
special responsibility for reform, a commitment to change,<br />
an obligation to all Australians and we set about our task<br />
with foresight and with energy.<br />
That's what Fisher did in the years after 1910 when, for the<br />
first time, the Australian people gave a Federal Government<br />
a mandate in both Houses of Parliament.<br />
That's what Curtin did when he was thrust into leadership of<br />
a nation already at war, though grievously unprepared for<br />
the challenges ahead of it.<br />
That's what Chifley did in the years after the war, setting<br />
the stage for reconstruction of the economy and its<br />
transition to a peacetime footing.<br />
It's what Whitlam did when he set about his program of<br />
reawakening Australian society after 23 years of<br />
conservative rule.<br />
These were massive achievements true evidence that the<br />
commitment to social justice that motivated the founders of<br />
our Party was alive and well, constantly reinvigorated by<br />
new generations of Labor activists.<br />
But these were not blind dogmatists, afraid to adapt the<br />
Party's strategies to meet the changing needs of the<br />
Australian people. As our Party matured, those planks of<br />
our platform judged to be outmoded have been thrown out.<br />
Curtin changed his mind on conscription for World War Two;<br />
Whitlam repudiated the repugnant but once fundamental plank<br />
of White Australia.<br />
What such changes were about was refining the strategies we<br />
employ to achieve our goals.<br />
The goal itself the original vision, of a more just<br />
Australian society has never changed. Nor will it..<br />
So what does our commitment to social justice mean as we<br />
enter the 1990s and prepare to celebrate the one hundredth<br />
anniversary of our Party?<br />
How do we make a truly just society in the era of the global<br />
economy; the nuclear era; the era when development is needed<br />
as never before to feed the people of the world but<br />
threatens as never before to ravage the planet we live on?<br />
I judge it one of my very great privileges to be in<br />
leadership of a Party and a Government that, I am confident,<br />
are equipped as none others to answer that question. </p>
<p>New South Wales consistently provides Federal Caucus with<br />
men and women of the highest calibre. Across the factions,<br />
they have proven again and again their dedication,<br />
determination and commitment to the great goals of our<br />
Party.<br />
This Party and this Government understand the global<br />
problems, and the problems of the Australian community,<br />
because we are in touch with the people.<br />
What I find one of the most stimulating and rewarding<br />
elements of my job is getting out of Canberra, meeting<br />
people in the cities and towns and country areas of<br />
Australia and hearing for myself their views and concerns.<br />
Being in touch means travelling, meeting ordinary<br />
Australians, and listening and talking with them being in<br />
touch means being confronted every day with evidence,<br />
through the media and directly, that one's plans are or are<br />
not being fulfilled being in touch means discussing with<br />
industry groups and trade unionists and interest groups,<br />
their views about the direction of Government policy. I do<br />
all that and that's what keeps me informed and in touch<br />
with the needs and aspirations of Australian people.<br />
It's especially rewarding when this involves seeing the<br />
decisions we have made in the Cabinet room in Canberra<br />
transformed into bricks and mortar, into real measures to<br />
protect our environment, and into new opportunities for the<br />
less privileged in our society.<br />
We often talk in Canberra, for example, about the retention<br />
rate of our schools which is the technical term referring<br />
to the proportion of school kids who stay on at school to<br />
finish Year 12 rather than leaving early.<br />
You have probably heard me say many times that this<br />
Government has massively increased the retention rate of<br />
Australia's schools.<br />
There can hardly be a better proof of our commitment to<br />
egalitarianism, and of our capacity to put in place the<br />
essential preconditions of a more just society, than this.<br />
The year before we came to office, in 1982, the retention<br />
rate had crept up by just one percentage point over the last<br />
five years of the Fraser-Howard-Peacock government and stood<br />
at 36 per cent one of the lowest rates of the Western<br />
world. Only one in three school students was finishing Year<br />
12. After six years of this Government that rate now stands<br />
at 58 per cent and by the early years of the next decade it<br />
will be 65 per cent getting on for double what it was in<br />
1982. You get a vivid picture of what these statistics mean when<br />
you actually visit a school and talk to the students and<br />
teachers and parents. </p>
<p>Back in March, as part of a visit I made to the Hunter<br />
region, I visited the High School in Singleton and I spoke<br />
to an extraordinary crowd: 1200 primary and secondary<br />
school students and teachers drawn from ten schools in the<br />
district. On just about every visit I make to an electorate in New<br />
South Wales and interstate I make similar school visits.<br />
The official part of the visit is brief handing over a<br />
flag or planting a tree.<br />
The really important part is simply listening to the kids.<br />
We talk about the importance of staying on at school to<br />
acquire the skills to contribute to society in a meaningful<br />
way and to have a rewarding life.<br />
And so when I hear Andrew Peacock claim that he could create<br />
a more egalitarian society he actually made that claim in<br />
Parliament recently! I know that is a nonsense.<br />
You know it too. And most importantly, the people know it.<br />
They know that in the schools the kids are finishing their<br />
studies they're not dropping out like they used to when<br />
Peacock and his colleagues were last in office.<br />
That is egalitarianism. That is social justice. That is<br />
Labor in action, building a better society for Australians.<br />
Let me give you another example: youth unemployment.<br />
By themselves, the statistics tell a straightforward story.<br />
When we came to office, unemployment among young Australians<br />
aged 15 to 19 was nearly 30 per cent 28.8 per cent, to be<br />
exact. Now after six years, we have virtually halved it.<br />
Nationally, it's 14.8 per cent and in NSW 14 per cent.<br />
But that is a dry way of presenting an achievement that, for<br />
those individuals who have found work as a result of my<br />
Government's policies, is of massive dimensions.<br />
Throughout Australia, in shopfronts and community centres,<br />
there is springing up a new and very special kind of<br />
organisation called SkillShare.<br />
SkillShare is a unique joint venture between the Federal<br />
Government and community groups designed to provide job<br />
training to people who have been unemployed for long<br />
periods, or who face special disadvantages in getting back<br />
to work.<br />
Courses are offered in, for example, computing or office<br />
skills or hospitality skills or metal work and instead of<br />
this being just textbook training, it is practical training<br />
relevant to the needs of the community. </p>
<p>So not only does the individual gain in acquiring better job<br />
skills but the community benefits in harnessing that<br />
person's talents for the duration of the course and then,<br />
ultimately, as a permanent member of the workforce.<br />
I have visited SkillShare projects all over Australia<br />
including, recently, at the Randwick Employment Access<br />
Centre in Jeanette McHugh's electorate. I presented<br />
certificates to a recent group of graduates from the<br />
SkillShare courses.<br />
In the Cabinet room we design programs and we allocate funds<br />
in a way which we hope will deliver real benefits to people,<br />
and solve real problems.<br />
So when I come to see such a centre in action, and meet the<br />
students and the staff there, I get the satisfaction of<br />
knowing that our endeavour has succeeded. I put faces to<br />
the statistics about declining youth unemployment, and I see<br />
the proof that young unemployed people are getting the edge<br />
they need for a decent start in life.<br />
And it's the same throughout New South Wales, across the<br />
whole spectrum of government policy embracing every section<br />
of the community.<br />
In March, I visited a nursing home in Strathfield and saw<br />
at first hand the care and respect being shown our elderly<br />
citizens thanks to the commitment of dedicated staff backed<br />
by Government funds.<br />
In April, I launched our Womens' Health Policy at Westmead<br />
Hospital in Parramatta a policy based on a massive process<br />
of consultation with women around the nation about their<br />
most fundamental needs and concerns.<br />
At ethnic clubs and balls throughout Australia such as the<br />
Cypriot Club in Stanmore that I visited in March and at<br />
citizenship ceremonies like one in Tamworth on Australia<br />
Day, I heard the concerns of ethnic Australia and witnessed<br />
the decision of hundreds of people born overseas to declare<br />
their commitment to their new homeland.<br />
At the BHP Rod Mill in Newcastle, I heard managers and<br />
workers tell me about the revival of the steel industry an<br />
industry critical to Australia's future but which, in the<br />
early 1980s, looked like being shut down. Had that been<br />
allowed to happen, steel cities like Newcastle and<br />
Wollongong-would have lost their lifeblood. So under the<br />
Government's Steel Plan, agreed to with employers and<br />
unions, we have seen a massive $ 1.8 billion investment that<br />
will provide jobs and exports for years to come.<br />
And next Wednesday I'll be opening a new child care centre<br />
in Marrickville. Throughout Australia, a steadily<br />
increasing number of child care places is being funded by<br />
the Commonwealth, providing working parents with the<br />
confidence that their children can be safely cared for while<br />
they work. </p>
<p>Child care is a vital test of a Government's commitment to<br />
the living standards and the quality of life of working<br />
Australian families. And our record is proud: by 1992,<br />
this Government will have created 98,000 new child care<br />
places a trebling of places since we took office.<br />
So take it all together and see what Labor in action means:<br />
It means real Australian people, breadwinners in real<br />
Australian families, finding real work in real jobs<br />
nearly 1.5 million of them in jobs we have created since<br />
we came to office.<br />
It means real dollars being spent to help real<br />
Australian families in genuine need including the<br />
unprecedented assistance provided by the Family<br />
Allowance Supplement, and other payments to low income<br />
families, which is lifting 500,000 Australian families<br />
out of poverty. This Government is each year spending<br />
nearly $ 9 billion more in real terms on social justice<br />
programs than was being spent under the conservatives.<br />
And Labor in action means not just directly helping<br />
those members of our community who are particularly<br />
disadvantaged, but also, and even more fundamentally,<br />
restructuring the entire economy, so as to remedy the<br />
conditions that determine the prosperity of the<br />
community as a whole.<br />
Under Labor, we are achieving the most far reaching changes<br />
ever seen in the Australian workplace, through the historic<br />
process of award restructuring. This will lead to more<br />
productivity, better career paths and not least, better<br />
remuneration to Australian workers.<br />
Under Labor, we have, through hard work and tough decisions,<br />
created a budget surplus for two successive years the<br />
first in 35 years, and a surplus that has funded real,<br />
permanent, tax cuts of unparalleled magnitude.<br />
I stress the word ' permanent'. I know interest rates are<br />
hurting some people paying off their homes. But it is<br />
necessary to keep them high for as long as it takes to slow<br />
down the economy because otherwise we would face an<br />
economic disaster in which the dollar would fall and<br />
interest rates would skyrocket. So interest rates are lower<br />
now than they could otherwise be.<br />
Unlike high interest rates, the tax cuts as well as the<br />
increased family payments are permanent and will mean<br />
enduring increases in the disposable income of families long<br />
after high interest rates have become a bad memory.<br />
Delegates, Forty one years ago almost to the day, Ben Chifley delivered<br />
to this Conference one of the great political testaments of<br />
our Party. </p>
<p>on 12 June 1948, in a speech called ' These Things Are Really<br />
Worth Fighting For', Prime Minister Ben Chifley defined for<br />
this Conference and for history what he felt the Labor<br />
Movement was on about.<br />
It couldn't have been more simple.<br />
" The problem ( the Labor movement) has set out to right," he<br />
said, " is in seeing that all the community are in a position<br />
to have a decent standard of living. That is the ultimate<br />
goal of the Labor movement whatever the reversals in that<br />
long long road."<br />
He went on: " I think it is tragic, in the world in which<br />
there has been so much scientific development, that men and<br />
women in a community cannot individually be assured of a<br />
reasonable standard of living when unemployment, due to<br />
uncontrollable causes, or sickness, or needs, or attention<br />
to their family, overtakes them, and that they cannot be<br />
assured of security for their own future when they grow old<br />
and security for their children."<br />
" These things," he declared, " are really worth fighting<br />
for."<br />
Today, what are the things we think are worth fighting for?<br />
Is it not the same goal, so simply expressed here 41 years<br />
ago the goal of seeing that all members of the community<br />
have a decent standard of living?<br />
That is the goal we are working towards. It's a goal that<br />
is considerably closer to attainment for the nearly<br />
million more Australians in jobs for the parents using<br />
child care services for the kids completing their studies<br />
for the families receiving the benefits of tax cuts and<br />
higher family payments announced in the April Statement<br />
for the two million Australians sheltering under the<br />
umbrella of Medicare who would otherwise not have the<br />
security of health insurance.<br />
That is what we are fighting for. And they are the people<br />
for whom we fight.<br />
Could these Australians have any confidence, under a Liberal<br />
Government, that their interests were being safeguarded or<br />
their standards of living protected?<br />
Of course not. Andrew Peacock had his chance to stand up<br />
for these people and he failed them. He was a member of a<br />
failed Government, and then he was the failed Leader of a<br />
failed opposition.<br />
So he has already run his race.<br />
It's Up to Labor to govern. </p>
<p>Delegates,<br />
When the founders of our great Party envisaged a more just<br />
society, they, rightly, saw Government as the proper<br />
instrument to achieve that goal.<br />
Today the public sector the Federal Commonwealth plays<br />
as compassionate, as creative, as catalytic a role in the<br />
achievement of social justice as any of our founders could<br />
realistically have wished.<br />
And through the Accord with the trade union movement we have<br />
created as effective a partnership between the political and<br />
industrial wings of our movement as has ever existed a<br />
partnership yielding real and lasting benefits to all<br />
Australians. Of course we haven't created the perfect society.<br />
Of course hardships and needs persist.<br />
As Chifley predicted, there are reversals as we travel the<br />
' long long road'.<br />
But that only makes it more important, for the good of all<br />
Australians, that Labor travel that road and attain its<br />
goal. It is the goal that Labor must attain.<br />
Because only Labor can attain it.<br />
With your help, we will attain it. </p>
