SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
AUSTRALIAN FINANCIAL REVIEW<br />
POST BUDGET DINNER<br />
SYDNEY 22 AUGUST 1990<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen,<br />
It's a pleasure once again to address the Financial Review's<br />
post-Budget dinner.<br />
Even by its own high standards, the Financial Review has been<br />
playing a significant role lately in public policy debates,<br />
particularly in the area of telecommunications and shall we<br />
say a strikingly informative role. I can't say I'm totally<br />
delighted about that but I presume your circulation manager<br />
is over the moon.<br />
I daresay there were some in this audience who believed that<br />
the March Federal election would be followed by John Hewson' s<br />
first budget rather than Paul Keating's eighth.<br />
It wa a tight election campaign just as we said it would be.<br />
But victory was always within our grasp. The conservatives had<br />
again loaded up their saddlebags with the lead of disastrous<br />
policies and indifferent leadership.<br />
But the enduringly significant reason we won in March is not<br />
because 1he= were so hopeless; we won, and we won well, on ou~ r<br />
merits. We had the right ideas, the clear strategy for the nation, and<br />
the decisive leadership to secure Australia's future in the<br />
1990s and beyond. The Australian people accepted that, and<br />
their mandate to us for continued reform was positive and<br />
explicit. Over recent weeks, and culminating in last night's Budget, we<br />
have shown that their judgment was totally accurate and their<br />
faith in us was completely justified.<br />
We did this in two ways:<br />
First, by continuing the hard work and discipline of seven<br />
years to get the right macro-economic settings to secure<br />
Australia's future while delivering on our campaign<br />
promises; and </p>
<p>Second, on those firm foundations, by delivering immediate<br />
and substantial instalments on a sweeping reform agenda<br />
for our fourth term in office.<br />
Tonight I want to address each of these in turn.<br />
And I say at the outset, in discussing the macro-economic<br />
aspects of the Budget, that I am under no illusions about the<br />
significance of our inflation, current account and debt<br />
problems. Equally, I am convinced that the policies we have got in place<br />
the only ones that can remedy those difficulties are now<br />
doing so effectively.<br />
The imbalance between demand and supply that could undermine<br />
the long-term viability of the Australian economy has been<br />
removed. Demand is falling as a result of the tight application of<br />
fiscal, wages and monetary policies while our supply response<br />
is being improved through the high levels of education,<br />
training, employment and investment we have created, and<br />
through our sustained and effective attention to micro-economic<br />
reform. There are clear signs that this dual approach is working.<br />
Without labouring the points, let me briefly give you some<br />
statistical evidence for that.<br />
last financial year, Gross National Expenditure<br />
increased by less than 3 percent compared with more<br />
than 8 percent the previous year.<br />
In the same period, growth in Gross Domestic Product<br />
has also slowed, although importantly not as much as<br />
demand.<br />
Accordingly, net exports made a positive contribution<br />
in 1989-90. In the June quarter 1990 net exports<br />
contributed nearly 2 percentage points to growth;<br />
imports fell by 10 per cent.<br />
Employment growth is easing, but it is not<br />
collapsing. Employment in fact grew marginally in<br />
the three months to July, and the only reason<br />
unemployment has risen is because the participation<br />
rate has reached record heights a vote of<br />
confidence by ordinary Australians in the prolonged<br />
resilience of the labour market under our policies.<br />
Business investment has eased back to more<br />
sustainable levels, but will this year remain at<br />
around 12 per cent of GDP still considerably higher<br />
than the average of the previous two decades.<br />
Inflation has been on a downward trend for the last<br />
four quarters, falling from a quarterly rate of 2.3<br />
per cent in September 1989 to 1.6 per cent in June<br />
1990. </p>
<p>So the economy is responding well to our existing policies<br />
aimed at lowering demand and enhancing supply. Care is still<br />
required, of course, as we manage the line between demand<br />
restraint and avoidance of recession.<br />
But there is good reason to be confident that we will make<br />
further progress in the coming year confidence borne out by<br />
the Budget forecasts of a 6 per cent inflation figure and a<br />
drop in the current account deficit of around $ 3 billion to<br />
per cent of GDP.<br />
Exports are forecast to grow at 7.5 per cent while imports will<br />
fall 3 per cent. That means all growth is coming from net<br />
exports precisely the goal we have been working to achieve.<br />
Given this, our policy settings are thoroughly appropriate to<br />
the times.<br />
First, monetary policy has been eased, resulting in a fall of<br />
about four percentage points in professional rates since early<br />
this year.<br />
Second, wages policy remains tight under the Accord with wage<br />
rises through this financial year lessened by our ability to<br />
deliver further tax reductions.<br />
Third, in fiscal policy, this Budget is the third in a row in<br />
which the public sector as a whole makes no demand on<br />
Australia's scarce savings.<br />
At $ 8.1 billion, the Commonwealth Budget surplus is our fourth<br />
consecutive surplus. They are the only four Commonwealth<br />
surpluses achieved in the nearly four decades during which<br />
comparable records have been kept. This surplus is sufficient<br />
to offset all the borrowing requirements of our business<br />
enterprises, and of State and local government deficits.<br />
Those who seek further resources from the Commonwealth need to<br />
understand better that in this sense, the surplus is already<br />
being used. It is not available to spend on some other<br />
purpose. It follows, too, that the public sector borrowing requirement<br />
should remain at zero or better for as long as our current<br />
account deficit remains unacceptably high.<br />
The rigour and success of our policy approach is also reflected<br />
in the Forward Estimates published in this Budget.<br />
Over the last few years, we have achieved a massive reduction<br />
in Government outlays from a peak of 30 percent of GDP in<br />
1984-85 down to 23.5 percent in this Budget. This brings the<br />
size of Commonwealth outlays as a share of the economy back to<br />
the level of 1974 no mean feat given the less buoyant<br />
economic circumstances that prevailed while this Budget was<br />
framed. In three years' time, the outlays to GDP ratio is forecast to<br />
fall to 21.6 per cent the level of the 1950s. </p>
<p>The Treasurer made this point forcefully last night and it<br />
needs to be firmly reinforced here: that reduction in<br />
Commonwealth spending does not reflect any reluctance or<br />
incapacity on the part of this Government to meet newly<br />
emerging social priorities.<br />
Commonwealth spending is shrinking in relation to the total<br />
size of the Australian economy. But we are delivering real and<br />
effective assistance to ordinary Australians in areas that<br />
either did not exist two or three decades ago or, if they did,<br />
were much less comprehensively served:<br />
child care, aged care, the family allowance supplement,<br />
schools, universities, the environment.<br />
We have made Australia both a fairer and a better place to live<br />
while meeting the imperatives of our broader economic<br />
circumstances. This Budget puts Australia further down this path.<br />
We fully delivered on our election promises to cut income tax<br />
from 1 January; to begin delivering improved services to outer<br />
suburbs; to devote further effort to the protection of the<br />
environment; to establish the new network of Cooperative<br />
Research Centres.<br />
As we said during the campaign, all our new policy initiatives<br />
were fully funded.<br />
For the future, let me make these two fundamental points.<br />
First, after years of exhaustive scrutiny and restraint, most<br />
government programs now reflect our reading of the services and<br />
programs the community expects Governments to provide. The<br />
need, and the capacity, for continued big real cuts in outlays<br />
has largely gone.<br />
We have now reached the point where further substantial real<br />
cutbacks would require us to tell the most disadvantaged in the<br />
community that they must bear a greater share of the overall<br />
economic adjustment burden than anyone else. This position<br />
could never be reconciled with the social justice objectives of<br />
my Government.<br />
Second, and counterbalancing the first, the Government retains<br />
the full capacity to make fundamental reforms which yield long-<br />
-term efficiency gains and savings. The reforms announced last<br />
night in relation to programs for the disabled and to<br />
pharmaceutical benefits, and the reform of unemployment<br />
benefits announced during the election campaign, represent<br />
fundamental and durable advances in social justice. They are<br />
very sound public policy.<br />
In all those cases we have secured significant social policy<br />
reforms and substantial longer term benefits to taxpayers and<br />
the economy as a whole.<br />
That combination is of course the abiding hallmark of Labor's<br />
continuing reform in social policy. </p>
<p>It is no coincidence that these reforms arise from careful,<br />
thoughtful and compassionate reviews of the relevant policy<br />
areas. So it is with justified anticipation that I point to<br />
our announcement of forthcoming reviews in housing and health,<br />
and pilot projects in access to services in disadvantaged<br />
areas. These reviews will yield important harvests in years to come:<br />
improved services for individual Australians, and improved<br />
targeting and efficiency.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
One of the fixed principles this Government has adopted in<br />
setting economic policy is that the annual budget process<br />
should not necessarily or automatically be thought of as the<br />
sole vehicle of decisions.<br />
We've always had the view that if a decision needs taking now,<br />
we will take it now for example, in a February or May<br />
Economic Statement. In the same way, if an issue isn't ready<br />
for decision, we won't risk getting it wrong by needless haste.<br />
That's the right context in which to see the telecommunications<br />
issue.<br />
Those who express dismay that telecommunications wasn't<br />
resolved in the Budget are falling victim to the fetish that<br />
process is more important than outcome.<br />
They ignore the fact that when we do conclude this issue, after<br />
the Special Conference next month, it will be a fully<br />
considered and widely understood decision.<br />
What we are doing on telecommunications is what we have always<br />
done in this Government we are conducting a debate that will<br />
yield an effective and enduring solution for the nation's<br />
welfare as a whole.<br />
That solution will be guided by these objectives:<br />
the creation and guarantee of competition in the<br />
telecommunications system<br />
the maintenance of a fully publicly owned<br />
telecommunications entity; and<br />
the guarantee that ordinary customers will benefit<br />
from the new structure including through the<br />
protection of Community Service Obligations.<br />
The debate is taking place within those guidelines; the outcome<br />
that will result will stand in the sharpest possible contrast<br />
to the conservatives' undebated prejudice simply to sell off<br />
Telecom. </p>
<p>In the meantime, as this Budget shows, we're getting on with<br />
other critical tasks of micro-economic reform in the<br />
pharmaceuticals industry, in petroleum taxation and in the<br />
per cent increase in funds to get efficient and effective<br />
national regulation of companies and our securities markets off<br />
the ground.<br />
Let me add two points about the new Australian Securities<br />
Commission. First, as well as slashing a lot of frustrating red-tape, the<br />
ASC will also strike at the deeply disturbing evidence that has<br />
been emerging about corporate malpractice and abuse. These<br />
practices have brought Australia's financial markets into<br />
disrepute. The ASC is equipped with the resources to use civil remedies<br />
and has the full blessing of my Government to do so if the<br />
corporate sector is not able to get its own house in order.<br />
Legal and moral responsibilities to shareholders and creditors<br />
are not to be evaded without penalty.<br />
Second, the creation of the ASC demonstrates the more general<br />
need for better coordination of State and Federal<br />
administration. The old NCSC was hamstrung in the end,<br />
fatally by the delays and difficulties entailed in the<br />
requirement for any reforms to be approved by seven parliaments<br />
around the nation.<br />
In this area, duplication and inefficiency has now been<br />
resolved by the establishment of a new Federal authority. In<br />
other cases different solutions will be necessary, and as I<br />
said in my speech on Federalism last month it is imperative, as<br />
we approach the centenary of Federation, that we find such<br />
solutions.<br />
The process of reform is to be initiated at a special Premiers'<br />
Conference to be held at the end of October.<br />
I have established a Commonwealth-State Relations Secretariat<br />
within my Department to provide continuing support, for which<br />
million has been provided in the Budget.<br />
But this is a task which should not be left solely to the<br />
politicians. I have said, for example, that I would be<br />
prepared to seek a constitutional amendment to achieve fouryear<br />
terms for the Federal Parliament if there is bipartisan<br />
support for the proposal.<br />
If the corporate sector genuinely believes, as I think you do,<br />
that three-year terms are a handicap to efficient business,<br />
then it is up to you to make your views known, to exert<br />
pressure on politicians to see that the referendum does take<br />
place, and to give it your vocal support when it does.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
In the months since the election, while preparing this Budget,<br />
my Ministers and I have been generating the outline of a<br />
sweeping reform agenda for the 1990s. </p>
<p>Looking forward from last night we have outlined the broadest,<br />
the most far-reaching, the most exciting strategy for change<br />
that we have contemplated at any stage since we were elected in<br />
1983. It is an agenda for reform of Australia's airline and<br />
telecommunications industries, and for further reform of the<br />
country' s manufacturing industries.<br />
It is an agenda for reform of the nation's railway and roads<br />
systems. It is an agenda for reform of Commonwealth-State relations and<br />
removal of the duplication of government services.<br />
It is an agenda for social justice for disadvantaged people<br />
living on the fringes of our urban sprawls and an agenda to<br />
yield further fundamental reforms in health and housing.<br />
It is an agenda for achieving ecologically sustainable<br />
development by better integrating economic and environmental<br />
considerations in our decision-making processes.<br />
It is an agenda for the creation of a clever country through<br />
continued improvements in education and training opportunities.<br />
And, of course, it is an agenda for the stabilisation of the<br />
nation's international indebtedness, while reducing inflation<br />
and continuing to create new jobs for Australian workers.<br />
The Federal Budget announced by Paul Keating yesterday delivers<br />
a real instalment on every one of these extensive agenda areas.<br />
At the same time, the Gulf crisis, coming after the spate of<br />
critical developments in superpower relations, Eastern Europe,<br />
the Asia Pacific region and, not least, the imminent business<br />
end of the Uruguay Round, means that in foreign policy terms we<br />
are as busy as we have ever been.<br />
So there you have it: this Government displaying the energy<br />
and determination to do precisely what we promised in the<br />
campaign we would do to achieve great national goals:<br />
a modern, growing economy, earning its income, paying its<br />
way through exports to the markets of the world, reequipped<br />
and restructured in its attitudes, its<br />
institutions and its technology; and<br />
a self confident and vigorous partner in the world economy<br />
and in the economy of our region the region of the<br />
future.<br />
With the Government's eighth Budget, those goals are now<br />
considerably closer at hand. </p>
