PREIM ERAINSTER PRESS STATEMENT NO. 576<br />
October 1975<br />
PRIME MINISTER'S STATEMENT ON A. B. C. TELEVISION<br />
Recall these words:<br />
" The basic principle which I adhere to strongly<br />
is that a Government that continues to have a<br />
majority in the House of Representatives has<br />
a right to expect that it will be able to<br />
govern."<br />
Fine words.. fine pririciple.. The basic principle<br />
of our Australian parliamentary democracy. That man of<br />
principle is the present Leader of the Opposition, Mr<br />
Fraser. He said those words just a few days after he<br />
replaced MLr Snedzen. as Leader of the Opposition. He has<br />
asserted that. principle again and again. He knows the<br />
course of honour, of decency, of democracy. Yet today<br />
he has made statements which can only mean that he is willing<br />
to overturn his principles and overturn the basis of ' our<br />
system. He has said that he intends to use the accidental<br />
numbers he thinks he controls in the Senate to delay<br />
passing the Budget until the morney runs out.<br />
In other words he intends to produce chaos in order to<br />
prevent the Government being able to govern., This is<br />
not just what Sir Robert Menzies has described as a<br />
falsification of democracy, not just the pursuit of what<br />
Sir Robert Menzies described as " the purely opportunist demands<br />
of those who find constitutional convention irksome"<br />
it is constitutional revolution.<br />
The House of Representatives the people's<br />
House alone determines who shall govern Australia.<br />
Only seventeen months ago, the people for the second time<br />
in less than eighteen months, elected the Australian<br />
Labor Party to govern for a further three years.<br />
I state again the basic rule of our parliamentary<br />
system: Governments are made and unmade in the House of<br />
Representatives in the people's House. The Senate cannot,<br />
does not, and must never determine who the Government shall be. </p>
<p>2.<br />
That principle has been upheld since<br />
federation. ' t has never been broken or challenged<br />
except during this Government's life. It has been<br />
scrupulously observed on at least twenty occasions<br />
since federation when the Opposition had the numbers<br />
in the Senate to reject Supply.<br />
our majority in the House of Representatives<br />
has never been threatened. The House of Representatives<br />
has passed the Budget. Bud~ gets and all money bills must<br />
originate in the House of Representatives, The Senate<br />
cannot even amend them but it can delay them. And<br />
this is what Mr Fraser proposes. And how will he do<br />
Q this? By using the numbers in a stacked Senate which<br />
is not even the same Senate which the people elected<br />
only seventeen months ago.<br />
It is in the words of Mr Killen, the Liberal<br />
0 Member for Moreton in Queensland " a tainted Senate".<br />
In May 1974 the people of Australia elected a Senate<br />
in which the Government had twenty-nine Senators<br />
and the Liberal and Country Party also had twenty-nine<br />
Senators, there were two Independents. The Labor Partythe<br />
Government received 200,000 votes in the elections<br />
for the Senate over all our opponents combined.<br />
But because two State Premiers flouted another great<br />
constitutional convention the Government now has only<br />
twenty-seven Senators. ./ 3 </p>
<p>3.<br />
It is this unrepresentative Senate, this tainted<br />
Senate, which Mr Fraser intends tco use as a weapon to strike<br />
down the democratically elected Government of Australia<br />
to render it incapable of carrying out the program which<br />
it was elected to carry out.<br />
A week ago it was generally thought that Mr Fraser<br />
would stick to his principles. Last weekend the Liberal<br />
Party Council the faceless men off the Liberal Party met<br />
in Canberra and apparently gave Mr Fraser his ridingr<br />
instructions. I make it clear that the Government will not yield<br />
to pressure. We will not yield to blackmail. We will ' not<br />
be panicked. Wie will not turn overT the Government of this<br />
country to vested interests, pressure groups and newspaper<br />
proprietors whose tactics would destroy the standards and<br />
traditions of parliamrentary government.<br />
The business of Government will go on.<br />
Mr Fraser has no credible answers -to the great<br />
problems that Australia shares with all other comparable<br />
countries. As the elected Government we will continue our<br />
fight against the effects of world-wide recession and<br />
unemployment. For that reason our Budget must be given a<br />
chance to work. There must be no disruption to the process<br />
of economic recovery.<br />
Let there be no mistake about the gravity of<br />
Mr Fraser's intention. Parliamentary democracy is a<br />
complex and fragile thing around the world it is under<br />
challenge. And'now it is being challenged in Australia<br />
by the very man who professes to be a man of principle. </p>
