FOR MEDIA THURSDAY' 24 APRIL' 1980<br />
ADDRESS TO THE COMBINED ELECTORATES DINNER<br />
Thank you for your welcome. It is good to be back amongst you;<br />
amongst people who have worked hard in the past in the successful<br />
support of the Liberal Party. I know that in what you have done<br />
you have been driven by a commitment, not just to individuals but<br />
also to ideals.<br />
* They are ideals which find their, political expression in our<br />
philosophy of liberalism ideals which are active through our<br />
political beliefs arnd our political behaviour.<br />
They are active:<br />
* through our commitment to the-individual and our faith,<br />
in his initiative and his willingness to accept<br />
responsibility<br />
* through our care and concern for those in genuine need<br />
* through our belief in the rule of law as the best means<br />
of securing our freedom.<br />
* through our dedication to economic growth, high<br />
productivity and efficient services achieved through<br />
freedom and competition in our enterprises-<br />
And liberalism, thirough its determination that economic power<br />
should not be concentrated in Government, but dispersed throughout<br />
the community, offers individuals a chance to work out their own<br />
futures in their own way.<br />
It is our dedication to these ideals which enables individuals<br />
to live in an orderly and law-abiding society, free to choose,<br />
to save and to invest; free to be ambitious, independent and<br />
industrious; and free to take risks, seek rewards and make profit.<br />
These freedoms will underwrite our prosperity in the decade ahea6.<br />
But because we can never secure them for all time, we must work<br />
to achieve ' a greater public involvement in our efforts to<br />
protect them.<br />
We can always do more to recruit people from the political<br />
sidelines; get them on our side; pick them on our team; and carry<br />
them with us on to the ' political battlefield. </p>
<p>And there, in the decades ahead, the sure victory of liberalism<br />
over socialism awaits those who are committed enough and<br />
conscientious enough to work for it.<br />
Indeed, our achievements of the last four years have already<br />
provided us with a platform for progress in the<br />
They have been won against a difficult inheritance following three<br />
Labor years of economic and investment decay.<br />
And in spite of an increasingly difficult international economic<br />
situation, we can confidently look forward to a decade of new<br />
opportunities and expanded development.<br />
But success id rarely accidental.<br />
It derives from a plan and a conviction; and a capacity to carry<br />
both of these through.<br />
For four years, we have waged a successful fight against inflation<br />
induced by the Labor Party.<br />
Not only did we face a state of high recorded inflation, but also<br />
Labor had fed a state of inflation in public expectations about<br />
what government could provide.<br />
Yet in what one newspaper article this week called " desperate<br />
measures", the Labor Party continues to promise an expanded role<br />
for government, a role which promises wider and more extravagant<br />
government spending programmes.<br />
This kind of behaviour would only plant the psychology of inflation<br />
deeply within the nation.<br />
Any society that does not attack the causes of inflation is little<br />
better than a society that fails to respond to systematic breaches<br />
of thelaw.<br />
For inflation robs people of their freedom and thoir security.<br />
To restore these to individual Australians, when we came to office<br />
we began to use all the economic weapons at our disposal to attack<br />
inflation; restraint in public expenditure, reduction of the budget<br />
deficit, responsible monetary policies and increasing resistance to<br />
excessive wage increases.<br />
As a result, we enter the 80s with an inflation rate of 10 per<br />
cent highly favbourable compared with that in the USA of over<br />
14 per cent and in the UK of over 19 per cent.<br />
Because of our economic strength, we have been able to lessen the<br />
impact of overseas developments on our economy at a time when<br />
inflation and interest rates have been rising rapidly overseas.<br />
Contributing to our economic strength has been our ability in the<br />
last three years to reduce the rate of growth in Commonwealth<br />
budget outlays to virtually zero in real terms.<br />
Yet in the three years under Labor they averaged an annual growth<br />
rate of over 10 per cent. </p>
<p>Obviously to accommodate this, taxes went up and as the Labor<br />
Government grabbed more and more of the national wealth,<br />
individuals suffered, industry was squeezed and investment dried<br />
* up, as inevitably it must.<br />
That is why, since we came to government, we have sought to<br />
-transfer economic power and decision making to individuals, and<br />
-the private sector has responded magnificently.<br />
Now, as we enter the 80s, Australia can look forward with optimism<br />
to new levels of investment activity and economic growth.<br />
And without economic growth, no government can properly provide<br />
the standard of living to which citizens aspire.<br />
Without economic growth we cannot provide job opportunities and<br />
welfare programmes to those in need.<br />
Without economic growt h, progress towards one goal can only be<br />
achieved by impoverishing something or someone else.<br />
One of our major claims to government in the 80s is our capacity<br />
to offer economic responsibility in the context of controlled<br />
inflation. This claim is well-founded<br />
with inflation two percentage points below the average of OECD<br />
countries; and growth in non-farm GDP expected to be 3 per cent<br />
or better for the current financial year. Most importantly, our<br />
growth has cnrelargely from our increased competitiveness.<br />
In the year ended December 1979, the value of our total<br />
exportEs was 33. per cent above the level of the previous twelve<br />
months. And the value of our manufactured exports increased by even more<br />
38 per cent.<br />
Inevitably, these trends have contributed to our improved employment<br />
position.<br />
While unemployment remains too high, total employment in the year<br />
to0 February 1980 rose by over 155,000.<br />
Trhese are significant advances and they have been achieved in<br />
spite of difficult international problems.<br />
TChere is no doubt that the international scene has been complicated<br />
by the instability in the Middle East and the massive escalation<br />
: Ln oil prices.<br />
But these developments only serve to remind us of the real<br />
opportunities that exist in Australia as a result of the ch . anges<br />
n the world economic and energy order.<br />
What we are facing in Australia is not the kind of crisis that<br />
i~ s facing some industrialised countries as a result of energy<br />
shortages. Rather, we are facing a decade of opportunity. 4 </p>
<p>4<br />
And it is an opportunity that Australia is uniquely placed to<br />
meet. Already, we are one of the few net energy exporters among OECD<br />
countries.<br />
We possess substantial reserves of uranium and black and brown<br />
coal.<br />
We have significant reserves of liquid petroleum gas and natural<br />
gas. Arnd the possibilities for alternative sources of oil from shale<br />
and coal liquefaction demonstrate that in a world increasingly<br />
short of energy supplies, Australia occupies a privileged position.<br />
The Government's role in response to this privilege is designed<br />
to achieve three objectives:<br />
Greater exploration and development of all our energy resources.<br />
Conservation of our scarce energy resources, and greater use of<br />
alternatives to our present oil supplies.<br />
This total strategy can only be properly served by forward-looking<br />
policies of government which set the climate in which these<br />
objectives can be achieved.<br />
The key element in our strategy is our oil parity pricing policy.,<br />
which is already contributing significantly to meeting these<br />
objectives. It represents the Government's determination, in the light of the<br />
changing international energy situation to secure, in the short<br />
term and in the long term, adequate supplies of local fuel.<br />
Far from being a problem for Australia's energy users-, our oil<br />
parity. pricing system is, in fact, the long term solution to<br />
their needs.<br />
It is calculated deception to talk of cheaper petrol when the end<br />
result of such a practice would be no petrol at all.<br />
our oil pricing policy will ensure a better energy base for all<br />
our industries and a more secure future for all Australians.<br />
It is a policy which is being pursued by all but one or two<br />
countries throughout the world.<br />
Yet our political opponents pretend to the electorate a sense of<br />
indignation that the Government has pursued this course._<br />
Behind the pretence is a desire to create in the public mind the<br />
fact that the Labor Party could provide cheaper petrol.<br />
They cannot and they will not.<br />
Mr. Keating has made it quite clear that his proposals for the<br />
taxation of oil revenues-will not mean cheaper petrol. </p>
<p>What Labor does admit is that it will impose a resources tax to<br />
replace the present oil levy.<br />
And in Mr. Keating's own words, the motorist will be no better of f<br />
In February this year, he said:<br />
" The debate aboutithe resources taxes doesn't matter<br />
much to the motorist at all. What does matter is if,<br />
over time, the resources tax collects more than the<br />
levy and I expect it wills?.<br />
By placing a penal tax on the oil industry whiqh would raise more<br />
money than the levy, there could be no chance of cheaper petrol<br />
for the motorist.<br />
In fact, such a tax would kill off investment in oil exploration<br />
and development, reduce our self-sufficiency and make us beggars<br />
for fuel on the international market..<br />
* There, owe would not be paying, as we are today, the lowest world<br />
price for crude oil.<br />
Rather, we would be forced on to the spot market where we would<br />
have to pay the kind of prices that take advantage of limited<br />
supply and unlimited demand.<br />
We have a responsibility to the next generation of Australians and<br />
to Australia's energy future to see that this does not occur.<br />
What is not gen erally understood is that even with parity pricing<br />
for oil, the price of super grade petrol in Australia at 32-33<br />
cents a litre is amongst the cheapest in the Western world; on a<br />
par with the USA and comparing more than favourably with New Zealan.<br />
at 43 cents a litre; Germany at 59 cents; the UK-at 61 cents; Japan<br />
at 62; the Netherlands at 67; Italy at 72 and France-at 75 cents<br />
a litre.<br />
our fuel prices, relative to those throughout the world, place us<br />
in a more privileged position than we sometimes imagine.<br />
That is why all industry which is heavily dependent on increasingly<br />
scarce local fuels, should take note of a recent observation, in<br />
relation to Labor's oil pricing policy, by the Vice-Chairman of<br />
the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association when he said:<br />
" We hope the opposition clearly understands that the<br />
industry's current assessment of what we deduce from<br />
their resource tax scheme is quite negative, and in<br />
the event of their coming to power, an unacceptable base<br />
on which to continue exploring".<br />
This is a clear warning that our increasing energy self-sufficiency<br />
and the momentum to national development would be in severe jeopardy,<br />
under Labor.<br />
There is too much at stake for us to allow this to happen.<br />
The last four years have seen a welcome resurgence in investment<br />
activity. </p>
<p>Expenditure on exploration has gradually risen in response to<br />
Government incentives and improved economic health.<br />
In 1979 it totalled $ 228 million and in the first half of 1980<br />
is estimated at $ 170 million.<br />
Further, it is estimated that total expenditure on exploration<br />
and development will exceed $ 500 million in 1980.<br />
The recent announcement by Esso/ BHP that development expenditure<br />
in the Bass Strait will exceed one billion dollars over four years,<br />
is a striking illustration of the revived confidence in Australia's<br />
oil exploration and development industry.<br />
A~ nd that confidence is burgeoning in other energy related<br />
industries.<br />
overseas investors are increasingly being attracted to Australia<br />
by the prospect of abundant supplies of electricity based on our<br />
large reserves of easily mined coal.<br />
These supplies are available in Australia at very competitive rates.<br />
Their production costs are considerably lower than power prices<br />
in other developed countries; much less than those in Japan; and<br />
cheaper than power costs from new generating plants in the USA.<br />
This advantage is already evidenced by the level of investment in<br />
the bauxite, alumina and aluminium. industries which require massive<br />
inputs of electricity.<br />
billion of projects are either under construction in these<br />
industries or about to co.<br />
All of these are expected to be completed by the mid-<br />
As well as this, a further $ 6 billion worth of projects in the<br />
aluminium industry are seeking an investment home in Australia.<br />
Such initiatives demonstrate some of the new resource based<br />
development opportunities that are now available to investors.<br />
* And there are others.<br />
As well as th~ e use of coal in the provision of cheap electricity,<br />
Australia will benefit in the 80s from the increasing export<br />
potential availab-e through our abundant coal reserves.<br />
The international energy agency estimates that Australia's annual<br />
coal exports will rise from 38 to 200 million tonnes by the year<br />
2000.<br />
This kind of ' expanded development in the utilisation of our natural<br />
resources means that with the right policies and aggressive<br />
management, the decade ahead looms as one of promise.<br />
Yet the new energy-related development in Australia is only part<br />
of the story. </p>
<p>Most recent figures indicate that almost 17 billion dollars worth<br />
of mining and manufacturing projects are about to go ahead in<br />
Australia, or are in the final stages of preparation.<br />
And even these figures, if anything, understate the likely<br />
expenditure on-energy exploration and development in Bass Strait<br />
and the North-West shelf and do not include the giant Rundle shale<br />
oil project in Queensland.<br />
What all this means is that Australia is already very much on the<br />
go in the<br />
Profitability has increased and confidence has returned to the<br />
national economy.<br />
And to secure a confident and aggressive private sector working<br />
within a responsive economic environment is a central objective<br />
of our policy determinations.<br />
But it is not the sole objective of o ur policy initiatives.<br />
Rather, it is a means by which other goals are more easily achieved.<br />
For the end result of all that we are doing, is the well-being of<br />
individual Australians.<br />
In moves directed to the well-being of Australian families and<br />
Australians in need, the Government has initiated beneficial reforms<br />
over the last four years.<br />
We h ave introduced family allowances designed to help low income<br />
families.<br />
By July 1, the spouse rebate will have increased * from $ 400 to<br />
$ 800 during our term of office.<br />
The sole parent rebate has risen from $ 200 to $ 560 in the last<br />
four years, and in this period we extended the supporting parents'<br />
benefit to include supporting fathers.<br />
This is very substantial assistance to single income families.<br />
Further, soon after we came to office, we acted upon our commitment<br />
to the needs of handicapped children by increasing the handicapped<br />
child's allowance by 50 per cent.<br />
But even then it was only paid to the severely handicapped.<br />
In 1977, we widened the eligibility for the allowance to include<br />
substantially handicapped children whose family income is low.<br />
A * nd in recognition of the special needs of handicapped students,<br />
in 1978, we extended the allowance to cover students over 16 and<br />
under 25 who-are not in receipt-of an invalid pension.<br />
The Gdvernment, along with individuals, accepts a responsibility<br />
to see that there is dignity for people in old age. </p>
<p>In significant moves designed to achieve this, the Government has<br />
replaced the complex means test for aged pensions with an easily<br />
understandable income test; and, in the last four years has<br />
approved the building of over 500 self-contained hostel and nursing<br />
home projects for the aged and disabled.<br />
It is a necessary concomitant of our improved economic health that<br />
we are able to provide these benefits to those in need, while at<br />
the same time improving the capacity of individual Australians to<br />
provide for themselves.<br />
The most important reform in this regard has been our modification<br />
and simplification of the taxation structure.<br />
A number of times, we have increased the tax-free income which may<br />
be earned before tax first becomes payable by individuals or<br />
families. In this way, approximately 300,000 Australians have been exempted<br />
from paying tax on their income.<br />
The announcements by the Treasurer last month mean that a further<br />
50,000 Australians will be relieved from paying any tax.<br />
Just as significantly, the Government has cut marginal tax rates<br />
with the result that 90 per cent of Australian taxpayers are now<br />
paying tax at the lowest marginal rate.<br />
Because of this reform, a majority of taxpayers are able to<br />
increase their income through overtime or part-time work without<br />
moving into a higher tax bracket.<br />
These reforms are consistent with our commitment to lowering taxes.<br />
It is a commitment which is not shared by our political opponents.<br />
Indeed, the Leader of the Opposition last year expressed the<br />
view that, " the challenge to traditional democratic socialism i<br />
the rapid spread of philosophies based on lower taxes<br />
and smaller government".<br />
Such a condemnation of our low tax and smaller government philosophy<br />
is shared by Labor's Spokesman on Economic Affairs who acknowledgefi<br />
in June, 197., that his Labor Party faced,<br />
" a mammoth t-ask in rebuilding the public sector and<br />
maybe an equally mammoth task in convincing the electorate<br />
that it should pay a higher level of tax to enable us to<br />
do so".<br />
But our political opponents are not daunted by the task of raising<br />
revenue through higher taxation from the Australian community.<br />
In December last year, Mr. Hayden when reminding us that his<br />
revenue raising programmes were "' somewhat more radical than had<br />
been outlined up to 1972"' warned us about our taxation future<br />
under Labor when he said: </p>
<p>have committed my organisation to a capital gains<br />
tax, a resource rental tax, a levy on domestic oil<br />
produacers, a number of initiatives in the tax area and<br />
other measures of that nature<br />
In what constitutes an elaboration of the " other mreasures" the<br />
Opposition's Spokesman on Economic Affairs has said that it is<br />
" wrrong" that we do not have " some form of tax on capital, be it<br />
dEath duties, capital gains tax, wealth tax or perhaps some kind of<br />
combination of those, or all three"<br />
It: is our responsibility to make sure that these taxation threats<br />
are understood by all Australians.<br />
For they would sound the death knell of enterprise and economic<br />
freedom.<br />
Especially when t he commitment to higher taxation is complemented<br />
by, a commitment to an extravagant extension of centralised<br />
government with no regard for the consequences this would have on<br />
th~ e economy.<br />
Indeed, the Adelaide Conference of the ALP last year ended with no<br />
anti-inflationary policy but with a total commitment to massive<br />
additional expenditure.<br />
And the same Conference bound a future Labor Party to the establishmeni<br />
of' more than thirty different councils and statutory authorities as<br />
well as more than a dozen forms of government intervention.<br />
Such extravagances would involve the use of taxpayers' money to do<br />
what private enterprise ought to be doing.<br />
As a consequence, by government favouritism for their own enterprises,-<br />
the Government would jeopardise the existence of private enterprise.<br />
This particularly applies in the sensitive area of resource and<br />
energy exploration and development.<br />
As well as this, Labor has grandiose plans for expanded programmes<br />
which they would administer through existing structures.<br />
They have already announced a " make-work" scheme estimated to cost<br />
taxpayers $ 1,000 million in spite of the fact that overseas<br />
experience has shown that such programmes do not add to employment<br />
bu~ t merely impose an additional burden on taxpayers.<br />
In. housing and health they have committed themselves, on the most<br />
conservative estimate, to expenditure of no less than $ 500 million.<br />
If amounts of money of this kind existed to be spent, would-. the<br />
public willingly let it be wasted on resurrected, re-named Labor<br />
failures.<br />
Some of these schemes were abandoned by Labor in the<br />
Re-cycled again under a new name, they would fail again.<br />
Butt the increasing intensity of the ALP's drive to centralising<br />
political and economic power in Canberra would perhaps surprise<br />
Victorians least of all.. 0 </p>
<p>Because such a goal to centralise power is essential to the<br />
achievement by the socialist left of its grand plan.<br />
And up until recently, Victoria has been the home of the socialist<br />
left.<br />
Indeed, one Labor M. P. in Victoria was quoted in the Melbourne<br />
AgEe recently as saying:<br />
" As it is, the socialist left has a big say in most other<br />
functions of the Party. They control the Party's newspaper<br />
" Labor Star". They run the head office. They run the<br />
weekly radio programme on 3KZ and the. Party's Administrative<br />
Committee. If they get any more control, there won't be<br />
anything left for anyone else".<br />
T his lament is now echoed throughout Australia.<br />
Aknd as a Bulletin article of March 11 said:<br />
" Mr. Hayden has done more for the socialist left than they<br />
could have ever managed for themselves".<br />
' rhe wages policy that he steered through the ALP Conference, was<br />
Partly instigated by Mr. Roulston, praised by Mr. Hartley, and<br />
opposed by Mr. Hawke as " a gutless sell-out to the Left".<br />
Further, Mr. Haydenintervened in the Queensland Branch of the ALP, handing<br />
the balance of power aye? to the socialist left;<br />
and dumped Dr. Klugman after Mr. Hayden had criticised<br />
him for being too concerned about communism..<br />
And the socialist left, in control of the Labor Party in Tasman ia,<br />
recently dumped the National President of the Party and Deputy<br />
Premier, from a respectable position on the Labor " How to Vote"<br />
ticket. Presumably, through all this, Mr. Hayden is sustained by Mr.<br />
Hartley's agreement, as recently as * yesterday, that Mr. Hayden is<br />
" the best Labor leader for the socialist left..."<br />
The pernicioup spread of left wing socialist philosophy into the<br />
recesses of the Labor organisation is most manifest in the<br />
opposition's respo~ nse to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and<br />
its subsequent inertia in support of the Government's condemnation<br />
of the Soviet Union.<br />
Senator Georges, whom Mr. Hayden personally appointed to act as<br />
his proxy at the Queensland ALP State Conference has argued that:<br />
" There is more dignity and morality in the Soviet Union<br />
than there is in our own society and in many Western societies".<br />
And carrying this threatening comment to the bizarre he argued, 11 </p>
<p>" Culturally, ( the Soviets) have achieved more and no<br />
doubt physically they have achieved more than most<br />
countries and possibly that is the basis of our objection<br />
to the Olympic Games".<br />
It is no wonder a journalist in the Melbourne Age only a week ago<br />
was prompted to remark that<br />
"... some aspects of Labor policy as presented by. senior<br />
spokesmen are remarkably similar to those of one or<br />
other of the Australian Communist groupings".<br />
Mr. Hayden has moved from a position of commendable purpose in<br />
mid-January when he argued that,<br />
" an effective boycott of the Moscow Olympics undoubtedly<br />
would be a major psychological weapon employed against<br />
the Soviet Union",<br />
To a position today of failing to act-upon this conviction; of<br />
failing to do anything to secure an effective boycott.<br />
At a time when there is a new and significant opportunity for the<br />
free world to indicate that there is some bread we will not break<br />
with the perpetrators of murder in Afghanistan, the ALP, almost<br />
alone amongst major world political parties, demonstrates that it<br />
is prepared to stand morality and the cause of humanity on its head.<br />
The attempts of the ALP to divide Australia from its allies; and<br />
to destroy the collective efforts we must make to contain naked<br />
aggression and preserve national and individual freedom; these<br />
attempts will tail, as they should, and those who have espoused<br />
them will fail with them.<br />
The 1980s have already presented us with new and testing challenges.<br />
These challenges serve to remind us that in spite of~ our natural<br />
and human resources and the great freedoms we enjoy, we need to do<br />
more than just rely on remaining a lucky country.<br />
The fact that we cannot rely on luck is well-evidenced by Labor's.<br />
past record of Government and the catalogue of its existing<br />
promises. This must challenge us to pursue, in what-ever we do, individual,<br />
economic and national success.<br />
Let us work together towards that success and the making of a<br />
better Australia.-<br />
Lot us not baulk in the face of struggles; because struggles in<br />
life give us strength.<br />
As a faumous American poet said,<br />
* It takes fight for principles to make fortitude; it<br />
taes crisis to give courage and singleness of purpose<br />
to reach an objective".<br />
What ' better text can there be for our nation to meet the challenges<br />
and acc" pt'tbO opportunities of the decade ahead.<br />
