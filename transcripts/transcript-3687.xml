PIUu' Z MPISTER Press Statement No. 490<br />
7 April 1975<br />
CANCELLATION OF SECOND ORPHAN-FLIGHT<br />
A second charter flight by a Qantas aircraft<br />
which was to have departed this afternoon to bring a second<br />
group of Vietnamese orphans for adoption in Australia has<br />
had to be cancelled. The Prime Minister, in announcing the cancellation<br />
of the flight, said the Australian Embassy in Saigon had<br />
been advised late this morning by the Deputy Prime Minister<br />
of the Government of the Republic of Vietnam, Dr Dan, that<br />
the quota of orphans for emergency evacuation from South<br />
Vietnam had been filled, and that there was no present<br />
intention to consent to additional blanket waivers for<br />
bulk emergency evacuations. The Australian Ambassador<br />
in Saigon has been given to understand that the Government<br />
of the Republic of Vietnam wishes to review its practices<br />
following the initial emergency evacuation and is reverting<br />
to the normal adoption procedures. The Australian Ambassador<br />
has reported that, following the first emergency evacuation,<br />
there are very few Vietnamese children who have been<br />
released to the adoption agencies.<br />
Mr Whitlam said that the Australian Government<br />
noted the Republic of Vietnam's position and the implication<br />
that the most pressing problem which had faced it in relation<br />
to the tragic problem of orphans, the innocent victims of<br />
war, had been relieved by the emergency uplift in which<br />
Australia had participated.<br />
The Prime Minister said that urgent consideration<br />
was now being given to the means by which the considerable<br />
quantity of relief supplies which had been assembled by<br />
the Government and private agencies in Australia for<br />
humanitarian use in South Vietnam, and part of which was<br />
to have been sent on the Qantas charter flight, could be<br />
delivered to South Vietnam.<br />
