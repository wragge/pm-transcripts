    <content><![CDATA[<p>Today I announce a minor reshaping of the Executive  -  underlining the Australian Government's core priorities of nation building for recovery and strengthening Australia's national security</p>
<p>Yesterday I announced the appointment of Senator the Hon John Faulkner as Minister for Defence.</p>
<p>Senator Faulkner served with distinction as Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister for Defence Science &amp; Personnel, and Minister for the Environment, Sports and Territories in the Keating Government. He also served as Leader of Opposition in the Senate from 1998 through to 2004 and National President of the Australian Labor Party in 2007-08.</p>
<p>Since December 2007 Senator Faulkner has served as Special Minister of State and Cabinet Secretary. He will remain Vice-President of the Executive Council.</p>
<p>Senator Faulkner replaces the Hon Joel Fitzgibbon MP as Minister for Defence. Mr Fitzgibbon was a first class Minister who was instrumental in the delivery of the Defence White Paper and discharged his functions with a genuine compassion and concern for our men and women in uniform.</p>
<p>Today I am pleased to announce the further changes to the Ministry.</p>
<p>Senator the Hon Joseph Ludwig will become Cabinet Secretary and Special Minister of State and continue in his role as the Manager of Government Business in the Senate.</p>
<p>Senator Ludwig is a former barrister who has served in the Senate for more than a decade, including as Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate from 2001 through to 2007 and Manager of Government Business since December 2007.</p>
<p>The Hon Chris Bowen MP will enter Cabinet and be appointed Minister for Financial Services, Superannuation and Corporate Law, and Minister for Human Services. Minister Bowen has served with distinction as Assistant Treasurer since December 2007 and has overseen significant reform in improving fairness and integrity in the tax system and in important areas of consumer rights.</p>
<p>The Hon Dr Craig Emerson MP, Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors and the Service Economy and Minister Assisting the Finance Minister on Deregulation, will also become Minister for Competition Policy and Consumer Affairs. Minister Emerson's significant achievements in working with small business to reduce red tape will prove valuable experience in his expanded role.</p>
<p>Senator the Hon Nick Sherry will be appointed Assistant Treasurer. Senator Sherry is a former Shadow Assistant Treasurer and was Parliamentary Secretary for Primary Industry, Energy and Resources during the Keating Government.</p>
<p>The Hon Brendan O'Connor MP will be appointed Minister for Home Affairs, taking on the critical portfolio with responsibility for policing and law enforcement and the administration of Australian territories. Mr O'Connor's wealth of experience from his strong handling of the employment participation role during the global recession positions him very well to take on this critical national security role.</p>
<p>The Hon Warren Snowdon MP will be appointed Minister for Indigenous Health, Rural and Regional Health and Regional Services Delivery. As a proud resident of Alice Springs, Minister Snowdon is a tireless advocate for Australians living in rural and remote areas.</p>
<p>The Hon Kate Ellis MP will be appointed Minister for Early Childhood Education, Childcare and Youth and will continue as Minister for Sport. Establishing a Ministry for Early Childhood Education and Childcare for the first time reflects the importance the Australian Government places on these policy challenges.</p>
<p>The Hon Greg Combet AM MP will enter the Ministry as the Minister for Defence Personnel, Materiel and Science and the Minister Assisting the Minister for Climate Change.</p>
<p>Mr Combet is well prepared for this important position having previously served as the Parliamentary Secretary for Defence Procurement. He will also continue his important role in relation to the Government's Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme by being appointed as Minister Assisting the Minister for Climate Change.</p>
<p>Senator the Hon Mark Arbib will enter the Ministry as the Minister for Employment Participation and the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on Government Service Delivery. This will build on the work Senator Arbib has carried out in his role as Parliamentary Secretary for Government Service Delivery, in assisting with the roll out of the Government's historic nation building infrastructure investment.</p>
<p>The Hon Maxine McKew MP will become Parliamentary Secretary for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, to further assist in this infrastructure roll out, with a particular focus on community infrastructure and local government.</p>
<p>The Hon Gary Gray AO MP has been appointed Parliamentary Secretary for Western and Northern Australia. Mr Gray's extensive knowledge of the West and the Northern Territory, and its particular challenges for the future in terms of resource, land and infrastructure management and development make him ideally positioned to take on this role.</p>
<p>Jason Clare MP will be appointed as Parliamentary Secretary for Employment. This will build on his current role as Special Adviser to the Prime Minister on Local Employment. As a Member from Western Sydney Mr Clare has firsthand knowledge of the impact the global recession is having on local jobs around the country.</p>
<p>Mark Butler MP will be appointed as Parliamentary Secretary for Health. Mr Butler will bring to this new role his broad experience working with Government, providers, staff and professionals in the health sector, particularly in hospitals and in aged care, in his home state of South Australia.</p>
<p>Richard Marles MP will be appointed as Parliamentary Secretary for Industry and Innovation. Mr Marles has a comprehensive understanding of the challenges faced by industry through more than ten years in the labour movement, and is well positioned to work across industry developing strong foundations for our emergence from the global recession.</p>
<p>After nearly 28 years of service in the New South Wales and Commonwealth Parliaments, the Hon Bob Debus MP has indicated to me that he will not recontest his seat of Macquarie in New South Wales.</p>
<p>In the context of the current reshuffle and the challenges of the global recession, Mr Debus has made the decision to retire from the Ministry in order to facilitate a strong team for the future to continue the Government's response during these challenging times.</p>
<p>Mr Debus has made an extraordinary contribution over this time, including in his dedicated service as Minister for Home Affairs. His discipline and integrity are legendary, and his application to the complex and challenging task of our national security has been outstanding.</p>
<p>On a personal note, I would like to thank Bob for his work over such a long period of time, and underscore the significance of his contribution to the Governments of New South Wales and Australia.</p>
<p>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Ageing, Senator the Hon Jan McLucas, has informed me of her decision to step down from her portfolio responsibilities.</p>
<p>She does so in order to focus on her role as Senator for Queensland, given the particular challenges faced by regional, rural and provincial Queensland during the global recession.</p>
<p>Senator McLucas has made a significant contribution through her role as Parliamentary Secretary, and has provided valuable support to the Health Minister in a major area of policy reform and a priority area for the Government. </p>
