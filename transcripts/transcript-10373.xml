THE HON. JOHN HOWARD MIP<br />
SPEECH AT THE LAUNCH OF THE<br />
NATIONAL CAMPAIGN AGAINST VIOLENCE AND CRIME<br />
F O F </p>
<p>To first of all the South Australian Attorney General, Trevor Griffin I particularly<br />
thank him for his attendance and his cooperation with the launch of this national<br />
strategy. To my other Parliamentary colleagues, ladies and gentlemen. Our Coalition<br />
Law and Justice Policy for the last election stated quite emphatically that every<br />
Australian was entitled to feel safe in their own homes and on the streets. We all know<br />
that Australians are very concerned about violent crime and we know that although the<br />
overall picture is not totally discouraging, there are pockets of increasing incidents of<br />
crime. The dominant image we've had to date and when we think of addressing the<br />
scourge of violence and crime in our community is of the blue line, is of policing and<br />
can I take the opportunity of saying at the outset of these remarks of mine, words of<br />
strong praise for the men and women of the police services of Australia. They have an<br />
immensely difficult job. It in fact is a despicable, they are a placed in despicable<br />
circumstances by the behaviour of people who break the law and they have copped<br />
through the agencies of royal commissions and so forth in recent years a very heavy<br />
battery and undoubtedly there are areas of corruption and malfeasance in parts of the<br />
police services.<br />
But overall w e should never, ever lose sight of the tremendous role that they play in a<br />
particular community and I wouldn't want the opportunity of this launch to go by<br />
without sticking up for the men and women of the police services of Australia. I think<br />
they do a terrific job.<br />
But addressing violence in crime is not just about policing. Police and policing are of<br />
course primarily and properly so the responsibilities of the state andl territory<br />
authorities. The Commonwealth has an important role to provide in offering a<br />
co-operative framework to assist the states and the territories and to ensure that our<br />
strategies and actions reflect world's best practice. Today we're taking that<br />
responsibility in the experience of Australia to a new and unprecedented level and<br />
before detailing the National Campaign Against Violence and Crime, let me outline<br />
work already being done which reflects our broad approach to supporting our </p>

communities, addressing violence and crime and making our nation a safer place in<br />
which to live.<br />
Since March 1996 the Government has undertaken and supported a range of<br />
substantial initiatives aimed directly at reducing the incidence of crime and violence in<br />
Australia. We've had the national implementation of the firearms control resolutions<br />
from the special Australasian Police Ministers' Council meeting of May 1996. We've<br />
had the National Register of Convicted Paedophiles, We've had the convening of the<br />
Aboriginal Deaths in Custody Summit set down for later this year. We've had famiily<br />
violence intervention projects, domestic violence database and the domestic violence<br />
summit to be convened later this year and to which my Government is very strongly<br />
committed, We've had the National Women's Safety Survey, we've had strengthening<br />
family strategy to help prevent child abuse, the National Youth Suicide Strategy, the<br />
youth homelessness pilot programme, the rural and remote domestic violence initiative<br />
and firearms safety information these programmes right across the broad spectrum of<br />
Government activities.<br />
But what is being launched today takes this kind of commonwealth leadership<br />
involvement in standard setting and strong commitment to new levels. The National<br />
Campaign Against Violence and Crime reflects the Federal Government's commitment<br />
to building stronger communities, reducing the level and fear of crime in our<br />
communities and protecting the vulnerable the aged, the young, minorities who may<br />
be subject to unfair and unacceptable abuse and discrimination.<br />
In broad terms the campaign is going to compile the best kcnown tactics for preventing<br />
and addressing violence and crime, help put them in place in Australian communities to<br />
test those tactics and programmes, ensure their effectiveness and then ensure that all<br />
Australians are empowered to take the best possible means to tackle violence and<br />
crime in our society.<br />
The first year priorities will be very important. They will be residential burglary,<br />
domestic violence, fear of crime and young people. This is a wide range Of Crime<br />
prevention strategies, national research and implementation projects. This is the first<br />
time there has been a truly national strategic approach to violence and crime, the<br />
Commonwealth in partnership with the states and territories and tapping into the<br />
expertise which already abounds and exists at those levels. The national campaign is all<br />
about knowing the best approaches, testing those approaches and then implementing<br />
them across the country. The aim is not just best practice, this is practical applications<br />
for Australian society.<br />
Surveys constantly show that there is a major concern about violence and crime in our<br />
communities. According to McNair in 1994, 72% of Australians viewed violence in<br />
crime as the number one issue of concern. 77% were concerned about violent crime<br />
and residents in the ACT, New South Wales and South Australia perceive burglary as<br />
the number one problem in their neighbourhoods. The campaign's national initiatives<br />
will address the need to research, develop, evaluate and implement national crime<br />
prevention projects. These projects will focus on crime prevention, fear of crime,<br />
residential burglary, domestic violence perpetrator programmes, early intervention with </p>

children, young people's use of public space and homeless youth and preventing<br />
violence at public events.<br />
In implementing the campaign and in addressing violence and crime generally, there is<br />
a large contribution from state and territories. We believe it's time that all governments<br />
worked together to crack down on crime in our community. Australians all want to<br />
feel safer in their homes, in public places, on the streets, on the playing fields and<br />
watching sport. The Campaign Against Crime and Violence will make Australia a<br />
safer place in which to live and in concluding my remarks, could I also acknowledge<br />
the presence here today of Shane Stone, the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, this is one of those occasions and this is one of those issues<br />
which draws together all of the governments of Australia across party lines and putting<br />
other divides aside. This strategy of ours cannot work unless it is done cooperatively.<br />
We are working with the states. We don't adopt a " Commonwealth knows best"<br />
approach to this. I recognise that the reservoirs of expertise and understanding about<br />
crime and violence in our community are very much at a state and territorial level.<br />
And the purpose of this campaign is to demonstrate the strong commitment of my<br />
Government to tackling the problem, our willingness to help devise a national strategy<br />
and our very strong desire to work in partnership with the states and territories.<br />
There is a lot written and said about the responsibilities of Government in a modemn<br />
society. I can't think of a more solemn responsibility than to give to the citizens of<br />
that society a greater sense of personal and physical security and safety and to the<br />
exctent that this campaign can contribute to that, then it will be successful.<br />
Thank you. </p>
