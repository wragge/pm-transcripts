<p>Prime Minister Gillard announced today the commencement of the third phase of the PNG-Australia Policing Partnership, which will see enhanced Australian support for the modernisation and reform of the Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary.</p>
<p>Australia's support for the Constabulary will include Australian Federal Police assistance for the recruitment and funding of Australians or international police to occupy four key in-line positions, including the Assistant Commissioner (Reform) and Commandant of the Bomana Police Training College.  It will also include additional AFP advisory support to the RPNGC.</p>
<p>The AFP will also offer Constabulary personnel attachments to the AFP, Northern Territory Police and Queensland Police, as well as additional training and mentoring opportunities.</p>
<p>This builds on the success of previous phases of the program, which since 2008 has supported capacity development, training and infrastructure upgrades for RPNGC facilities.</p>
<p>The overall package of new and existing programs will comprise 19 AFP personnel and four externally recruited in-line officers at a total cost of $56.6 million over four years.</p>
