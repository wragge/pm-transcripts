<p> Well thank you very much Paul for those very warm words of welcome</p>
<p> and might I say extremely entertaining and enthusing speech. I acknowledge</p>
<p> my parliamentary colleagues, Kerry Chikarovski, Joe Hockey, Jillian</p>
<p> Skinner, Brendan Nelson, Andrew Humpherson and all the other distinguished</p>
<p> guests. Ladies and gentlemen I am very pleased to be here for a number</p>
<p> of reasons.</p>
<p>Firstly, but not only, I am delighted to be associated with a project</p>
<p> for which Paul Ramsey has been the basic inspiration. I have an immense</p>
<p> personal regard for Paul. He is a very dedicated enthusiastic, optimistic</p>
<p> Australian. The only limitation on this country's future prospects</p>
<p> is that we don't have eighteen and three quarter million people</p>
<p> who are simultaneously positive, talented, optimistic and hopeful</p>
<p> about the future and Paul is one of those blokes who always leaves</p>
<p> you a little more enthusiastic and a little more energetic and a little</p>
<p> more encouraged to do something positive and to do something good</p>
<p> after you have had a yarn to him. Whether it is in communications</p>
<p> or the private health field or whatever, he is always out there punching</p>
<p> very hard to make a positive contribution. After hearing some of his</p>
<p> tales of earlier years and what they did with those Jesuits I am glad</p>
<p> that I didn't go teach at Riverview.</p>
<p>But ladies and gentlemen the other of a number of reasons why I am</p>
<p> very pleased to be here today is that is an opportunity to say something</p>
<p> about a constant theme of mine in recent days and that is the concept</p>
<p> within our society of a social coalition. We all, I guess, want the</p>
<p> best for our country, we all want Australia to be a strong country,</p>
<p> we want it to be a fair country and we want it to be a decent society.</p>
<p>We all want there to be proper underpinnings so that the poor in our</p>
<p> community are well looked after, but we also want a society that encourages</p>
<p> people who have aspirations to do better, to work hard in the belief</p>
<p> that they get some return. I think we all agree on that whatever our</p>
<p> backgrounds are, whatever our politics are and whatever our views</p>
<p> are about public policy issues. I think we also recognise that there</p>
<p> is no one section of our society that can achieve those goals operating</p>
<p> on it's own.</p>
<p>There used to be a view in society probably 20 or 30 years ago that</p>
<p> you solved every problem by handing it over to the Government, particularly</p>
<p> the Federal Government, and that if you just got the Federal Government</p>
<p> to establish a program and pour a lot of money into it then that would</p>
<p> solve every difficulty. Then I think we went through a bit of a reaction</p>
<p> to that to a belief that the Government was hopeless at everything</p>
<p> and it had really no role in society at all except perhaps for providing</p>
<p> the wherewithal to defend the country and provide the Police and a</p>
<p> few basic services and that everything should be left to the private</p>
<p> sector.</p>
<p>Now, I think that we have realised that that doesn't quite work</p>
<p> either important though the private sector is, and dedicated though</p>
<p> all of us are to it. I think though what we have come to believe,</p>
<p> quite rightly in more recent years is that we all do have to work</p>
<p> together in a very co-operative way and that is why I talk frequently,</p>
<p> not only in areas like health and education and social security but</p>
<p> I talk very frequently in a lot of areas about the need to build this</p>
<p> social coalition, about the need for people to work together. The</p>
<p> Government does have a role, the private sector has a role, health</p>
<p> professionals, in the case of health policy have a role and of course</p>
<p> the great charitable religious and welfare organisations of our society</p>
<p> also have a very important role. What we really want to do is to find</p>
<p> the best combination, with each of those sectors of society contributing</p>
<p> those things that they can do best. In many ways our public health</p>
<p> and our private health system, collectively the Australian health</p>
<p> care system has the beginnings, I believe, of the very effective social</p>
<p> coalition.</p>
<p>It is fashionable unfortunately in this country and everybody is a</p>
<p> bit guilty of it, the politicians are guilty of it on occasion, the</p>
<p> media is guilty of it and other people in society are guilty of it,</p>
<p> of knocking the health care system of this country. I want to say</p>
<p> something very strongly in defence collectively of the health care</p>
<p> system. It may have its faults and it may need further reforms and</p>
<p> it may need further innovations but I don't believe there is</p>
<p> a better health system anywhere else in the world. Paul's joke</p>
<p> about the pilot not landing in Moscow is true and the reality is that</p>
<p> if you're a battler and you're earning $30 000 or $40 000</p>
<p> a year or the currency equivalent of that somewhere else in the world,</p>
<p> is if you're going to get ill get ill in Australia. Don't</p>
<p> get ill in the United States, don't get ill certainly in the</p>
<p> old Soviet Union, with great respect to the many people who have come</p>
<p> from the UK health system who maybe here today it is preferable to</p>
<p> get ill in Australia rather than the United Kingdom and overall I</p>
<p> think we do have a very good health system. That doesn't mean</p>
<p> to say it is perfect but it has a lot of things going for it. To start</p>
<p> with we have undoubtedly some of the best health care professionals</p>
<p> in the world, Australian doctors, Australian surgeons are world renowned,</p>
<p> we all know that. And the quality of care delivered by nursing professionals</p>
<p> in all Australian hospitals is of an exceptionally high standard.</p>
<p>We have always punched above our weight as far as medical research</p>
<p> is concerned. And I reminded myself of this when I had the opportunity</p>
<p> last Friday of opening the new gene therapy unit at the Peter McCallum</p>
<p> Institute in Melbourne of just how remarkably has been the impact</p>
<p> of the great names in medical research that have come out of this</p>
<p> country. When you think of the contribution of the all the institutes,</p>
<p> of the Walter and Eliza, of the Garvan and the list goes on, of the</p>
<p> Peter McCallum. And in the last budget I was very proud of the fact</p>
<p> that we committed ourselves to double Â double - the amount of</p>
<p> money being given by the Federal Government to health and medical</p>
<p> research in this country. And we did that because we believe that</p>
<p> Australia is very good at that and we have very good researchers and</p>
<p> very good doctors and that is money well invested and well spent to</p>
<p> build a better future.</p>
<p>We do have very good health outcomes. And we also have a very good</p>
<p> partnership between the public system and the private system. And</p>
<p> you can't build a successful health care system anywhere in the</p>
<p> world without having the two of them. The Government has a role through</p>
<p> the public hospitals. And like so many Australians I've seen</p>
<p> the tremendous quality of work that is performed in public hospitals</p>
<p> in this country. And without that skill and care and dedication the</p>
<p> lives of many Australian families would be the poorer as a consequence.</p>
<p> But we've got to supplement that with the role of the private</p>
<p> hospital. And I think the role of the private hospital was heavily</p>
<p> discounted for a very long time. And I am pleased that we as a government</p>
<p> have done a lot more to encourage private hospitals. We've done</p>
<p> a lot more to encourage people back into private health insurance.</p>
<p> It's a hard battle getting people back into private health insurance</p>
<p> and you won't do it unless you give them incentives. You won't</p>
<p> do it unless you continue assiduously as many have done. And this</p>
<p> hospital is part of that process, of tackling the problem of gaps</p>
<p> in relation to private health insurance. And I make no apology for</p>
<p> the fact that we are investing $1.5 billion a year or more into encouraging</p>
<p> people, giving people an incentive, to remain in private health insurance.</p>
<p> Because it was always part of the Australia that I grew up in that</p>
<p> you had a strong public hospital system underpinned by private health</p>
<p> insurance which people were encouraged to enter and remain a member</p>
<p> of. And that provided a strong supplement of support for the private</p>
<p> hospital system because the one complements the other and there are</p>
<p> things that are done in private hospitals that can only be done within</p>
<p> the ambience of the private sector. And equally there's a broader</p>
<p> social responsibility which is discharged by both the public hospitals</p>
<p> working together with the private hospitals.</p>
<p>And I was glad that Paul made the point that the North Shore Public</p>
<p> Hospital and this hospital work together in a co-operative way. They</p>
<p> do not see each other as rivals. They see each other as co-contributors</p>
<p> to the State health system and that is enormously important. And that</p>
<p> same principle applies, of course, in other areas where you have both</p>
<p> private and public provisions such as education. They're not</p>
<p> rivals. They're co-contributors for the same overall system,</p>
<p> giving people maximum amount of choice and giving them the available</p>
<p> options that they ought to have in our kind of society.</p>
<p>So, ladies and gentlemen, I am really very pleased indeed to be here</p>
<p> today. I'm pleased to honour the philanthropic contribution of</p>
<p> Paul Ramsey to Australian society, to honour the contribution of his</p>
<p> hospital to new standards of excellence and care and comfort when</p>
<p> people are ill. It's certainly located in an easily accessible</p>
<p> part of Sydney. It's not far from Kirribilli, I don't object</p>
<p> to that. And it is a hospital that I know in the short time that it's</p>
<p> been open has already set new standards of comfort and excellence</p>
<p> and care and that is tremendously important. But most importantly</p>
<p> of all it is dedicated to the relief of human suffering, it is dedicated</p>
<p> to a caring approach to human life, it is dedicated to looking after</p>
<p> people when they need assistance and it is dedicated to the better</p>
<p> values and the better aspirations of the Australian community. So</p>
<p> in declaring this hospital formally open may I pay tribute to the</p>
<p> doctors and the nurses and all the other staff who work here. I've</p>
<p> always had an immense admiration for health care professionals in</p>
<p> this country. Their dedication and their skill and their compassion</p>
<p> is always deserving of our understanding and our respect. I thank</p>
<p> them. I thank Paul for his leadership and all the other members of</p>
<p> the board. And I have great pleasure in officially declaring the hospital</p>
<p> open.</p>
