TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
PRESS CONFERENCE, PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA,<br />
14 DECEMBER 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
PM: Well I would like to tell you that the Cabinet has today decided that<br />
Australia will enter into a security agreement with Indonesia. The text<br />
has been agreed over a number of meetings between President<br />
Soeharto and myself over the past 18 months and after it goes through<br />
Executive Council the agreement will be signed next Monday in<br />
Jakarta. The agreement asserts, in formal terms, for the first time that Australia<br />
and Indonesia have common interests in the peace and security of the<br />
region and that we intend to cooperate in support of those interests.<br />
The agreement is intended to make an enduring and powerful<br />
assertion within the region and outside it that the long term strategic<br />
interests of Australia and Indonesia coincide.<br />
This is a major strategic development for Australia and for the region<br />
and a development of fundamental importance in our bilateral<br />
relationship with Indonesia, it is about providing for Australia's future<br />
and creating greater certainty about that future.<br />
The agreement, which is of treaty status, commits the two<br />
Governments to the following things: consult at Ministerial level on<br />
a regular basis about matters affecting their common security and to<br />
develop such cooperation as would benefit their own security and that<br />
of the region; ( ii) consult each other in the case of adverse challenges<br />
to either party or to their common security interests and, if appropriate,<br />
consider measures which might be taken by them individually and<br />
jointly and in accordance with the processes of each Government; and,<br />
( iii) promote, in accordance with the policies and priorities of each,<br />
cooperative activities in the security field. </p>
<p>As is the case and usual practice, the full text will be released after the<br />
signing on Monday.<br />
Now this is a significant and natural extension of the cooperation we<br />
have built up with Indonesia in recent years. It demonstrates that each<br />
of us has confidence in the security intentions of the other. In other<br />
words, we are putting on the table and we are saying formally that the<br />
things that we are saying and doing to and with one another, the<br />
agreements that have been entered recently between our defence<br />
forces, the discussions we have between Foreign Ministers and at<br />
Heads of Government. It is there to demonstrate that each of us has<br />
the confidence in the security intentions of the other.<br />
I have said before that Australia is no threat to Indonesia and<br />
Indonesia is no threat to Australia. This has been the basis of our<br />
defence planning for many years. But it is important that it is<br />
understood by the people of each country. You also remember me<br />
saying that the emergence of President Soeharto's new order<br />
Government in the 1960s was the event of most positive strategic<br />
significance to Australia in the post-war years.<br />
The consequences for Australia of having a hostile or even unfriendly<br />
Government in Indonesia over that period would have been<br />
incalculable including for the percentage of our national resources we<br />
would have spent, or would be spending, on defence.<br />
The agreement builds on all the work that both sides have put into<br />
building up the depth and diversity of the relationship between the two<br />
countries. The interests we now have between us are varied and,<br />
of course, they are not new. You will know about the things we have<br />
done together on the Cambodia peace settlement where Australia and<br />
Indonesian diplomats and our armed forces worked closely together.<br />
You know of our collaborative work on the ASEAN Regional Forum<br />
and, of course, more recently on APEC.<br />
The agreement is, essentially, about building a structure for the future<br />
of Australia, to reduce uncertainties over the next 10 to 20 years and<br />
with it Indonesia is offering us the opportunity to shape the region.<br />
The agreement will reinforce the security of the region as a whole by<br />
demonstrating to our friends and neighbours that Australia and<br />
Indonesia will continue to build a close and cooperative relationship.<br />
There are several things, though, that the agreement does not do. It is<br />
not an assertion that we have common internal policies or<br />
philosophies, or that we endorse everything that Indonesia does<br />
internally or vice versa. It does not involve us in the internal affairs of<br />
Indonesia, or compromise our approach on human rights. There is a<br />
reference in the text to adverse challenges in the agreement and </p>
<p>this has application only to external challenges, not those that might<br />
arise from internal developments.<br />
The agreement does not cut across Australia's commitments under<br />
ANZUS, or the Five Power Defence Arrangements, or our Joint<br />
Declaration of Principles with Papua New Guinea, or indeed<br />
Indonesia's membership of ASEAN and the non-aligned movement. It<br />
does not cut, or undermine, or contradict, our regional and multilateral<br />
approaches to building up security dialogue and confidence, such as<br />
our joint support for the ASEAN Regional Forum.<br />
It is not a defence pact or alliance with an automatic agreement on<br />
support in the event of attack. It is couched in simple terms, simple<br />
and unambiguous terms, and means what it says.<br />
Now I said earlier that the discussions on the agreement have been<br />
running now for about 18 months. The proposal was first discussed by<br />
the Security Committee of Cabinet in February 1994. In the<br />
1993 Strategic Review, we stated that more than with any other<br />
regional nation, a sound strategic relationship with Indonesia would do<br />
most for Australian security.<br />
I first raised the matter with President Soeharto in 1994. He took it up<br />
with me again at our meeting in Bali and we, more or less, completed<br />
negotiations during our bilateral discussions in Osaka. During those<br />
meetings, I had a personal emissary representing me. That person<br />
has been General Peter Gration and he, accompanied by<br />
Allan Gyngell ( PM's Senior Adviser International), had made visits to<br />
Indonesia to settle some of the discussion, terms and sense of the<br />
agreement. The agreement will be signed in Jakarta by Gareth Evans and the<br />
Indonesian Foreign Minister, Mr Ali Alatas, in the presence of<br />
President Soeharto and myself. The two Defence Ministers Senator<br />
Ray and Mr Sudradjat will be present as will the Australian Chief of<br />
the Defence Force, General Baker and the Indonesian Defence Force<br />
Commander, General Feisal Tanjung.<br />
The agreement, of course, is not a promise that Indonesia and<br />
Australia will never disagree on issues. We have the Five Power<br />
Defence Agreement with Malaysia and Singapore and we found on<br />
various matters, trade matters and the like, we have had<br />
disagreements from time to-time. We have got, of course, an<br />
agreement of a different variety with ANZUS and, of course, you know<br />
we had disagreements with the United States from time to time.<br />
No relationship, with as much substance as ours, will ever be free of<br />
disagreement and I don't think either of us will be inhibited from<br />
expressing such differences frankly and arguing out our case as we </p>
<p>have done, obviously, with Indonesia. But those policy disagreements<br />
come and go and, of course, over time as the political leadership of the<br />
countries will change.<br />
So I believe the agreement represents another stage in the<br />
development of Australia's relationship with Indonesia. Indonesia is<br />
our largest neighbour, the world's fourth most populous country, the<br />
largest Muslim country in the world, the immediate past Chair of the<br />
non-aligned movement, and on some measures, based on purchasing<br />
power parity already the tenth largest economy in the world.<br />
On the other hand, of course, we are a modern, technologically and<br />
scientifically advanced society, with a huge resource base we enjoy<br />
in a Continent in a country we share without borders and, of course,<br />
we are as we all know a rich and dynamic multi-cultural society.<br />
I think I am convinced that Australia and Indonesia have much to<br />
contribute in partnership. I think we have a great opportunity here to<br />
shape the security environment of the region.<br />
This is, as I said earlier, a chance to say that in an enduring powerful<br />
way, within the region and outside it, that the long-term strategic<br />
interests of Australia and Indonesia coincide. And our first chance to<br />
put down in formal terms that Australia and Indonesia have common<br />
interests in the peace and security of the region, and that we intend to<br />
cooperate in support of those interests. Thank you.<br />
J: Prime Minister, have you discussed this with any other regional<br />
nations, or with the United States, as we said we would do in that<br />
strategic review?<br />
PM: I have discussed this with the United States Ambassador, and we will<br />
be moving around... in fact, General Gration will be visiting as will<br />
other representatives of Australia a number of countries to make<br />
clear what it means. In fact, General Gration will be travelling early<br />
next week to a number of capitals Washington, Tokyo and Beijing,<br />
Kuala Lumpur, Singapore, Wellington, Port Moresby to explain the<br />
background of the agreement in person.<br />
J: Prime Minister, does this make Indonesia the next closest nation to us<br />
after the United States?<br />
PM: Well, I have said before that no nation is more important to us than<br />
Indonesia. It's our largest nearest neighbour, and the clarity and the<br />
integrity of this agreement makes very clear their importance to us.<br />
Of course, in defence and security terms, ANZUS and our relationship<br />
with the United States has always been central to Australian defence<br />
and foreign policy, and it remains so. </p>
<p>J: Mr Keating, does this agreement mean a practical increase in defence<br />
cooperation and possible exchanges of intelligence information?<br />
PM: Well, I think it might be worth reminding you in August 1995, the<br />
Vice CDF and his Indonesian counterpart co-signed a letter outlining<br />
the principles along which bi-lateral defence relations will be<br />
developed, and that letter was endorsed by the Defence Ministers of<br />
our inaugural meeting in Perth in August of this year. Now in that, our<br />
Defence Ministers agreed to meet annually, Indonesia presented it's<br />
White Paper on Defence, Ministers agreed on the need to develop<br />
inter-operability and commonality between our regional defence forces,<br />
and they endorsed the following objectives in the following fields:<br />
operations and exercises, training, communications and electronic<br />
warfare, logistics, intelligence, strategic consultations, and contacts<br />
and visits. They also agreed a new management a structure to<br />
co-ordinate all cooperative activities, comprising a defence policy<br />
committee headed at the three-star level, and a defence co-ordination<br />
committee at it's executive arm. And you might remember of course,<br />
that in terms of co-operative activities, Indonesia has participated in<br />
the Kangaroo 95 exercises, port visits by ships of each Navy, annual<br />
special force troop exchange exercises, and we are increasing, of<br />
course, the number of trained people from ABRI here in Australia.<br />
So, there is now a real formal structure there in place, and this just<br />
provides, I think, a better setting for the development of that structure.<br />
J: What will you say to those Australians of East Timorese background<br />
and their supporters who will be undoubtably critical of this?<br />
PM: Well, I think this is not an either-or issue. The Austral ia-I ndonesia<br />
relationship is a relationship, I think, of many parts and great depth.<br />
And I think what we have seen both over time in the development of<br />
this issue by the Foreign Minister, by the Defence Minister and their<br />
counterparts there, by the relationship I have had with President<br />
Soeharto, by those collaborative things we have done that we have<br />
mentioned Cambodia, the development of the ASEAN regional forum,<br />
APEC that we now have a broad relationship with Indonesia.<br />
It's a relationship of substance, and it is I think within that<br />
relationship of substance that human rights are an integral part of our<br />
dialogue, and that they are very much at the core of our sense of<br />
ourselves. And I have told you a number of times now that<br />
whenever we feel a desire or a wish to make clear where we stand on<br />
human rights, or any human rights issue including Timor we make<br />
that clear. I have put my views to President Soeharto forthrightly, as<br />
I know the Foreign Minister does regularly with his counterpart etc.<br />
None of that is changed by this agreement none of that is changed by<br />
this agreement. You know, it is inevitable that we are going to agree<br />
on some issues, and disagree on others. But when we do so, we will<br />
do it directly. But we will do no service to Australian interests, or the<br />
interests of the people of Indonesia were this to become a single-issue </p>
<p>relationship, and I don't think any service to the people of East Timor,<br />
either.<br />
J: Prime Minister, to get a fix on this is this more than a non-aggression<br />
pact, but less than a Treaty?<br />
PM: It has Treaty status, but it is not a defence pact which implies a military<br />
response. What it makes clear is that each country will consult the<br />
other in the case of challenges to either one of us, or our common<br />
security interests, and if appropriate, consider measures which might<br />
be taken by them either individually or jointly in accordance with their<br />
national processes.<br />
J: So it could involve Australian troops, or Australian defence forces,<br />
being involved in defence of Indonesia?<br />
PM: Yes, but it doesn't have automaticity it doesn't have auotomaticity.<br />
Can I say, the agreement is squarely in the same family of agreements<br />
as the Five Power Defence Agreement, and our Joint Declaration of<br />
Principles with Papua New Guinea. I mean, for instance, the<br />
Five Power Defence Agreement has words like this: " that their<br />
Governments would immediately consult together for the purpose of<br />
deciding what measures should be taken jointly or separately in<br />
relation to such attack or threat".<br />
In the Joint Declaration of Principles with Papua New Guinea it says<br />
' the two governments will consult at the request of either about matters<br />
affecting their common security interests in the event of external armed<br />
attack threatening the national sovereignty of either country. Such.<br />
consultation would be conducted for the purpose of each government<br />
deciding what measures should be taken, jointly or separately, in<br />
relation to that attack.'<br />
So, it is in the genre or the family of those agreements. Whereas<br />
ANZUS says things like this ' for the purpose of article 4, an armed<br />
attack on any of the parties is deemed to include an armed attack on<br />
the metropolitan territory of any of the parties or on island territories<br />
under its jurisdiction in the Pacific on its armed forces, public vessels or<br />
aircraft in the Pacific. It declares ' it would act to meet a common<br />
danger in accordance with the Constitutional processes under article 4.<br />
Under article 3 it says ' the parties will consult together whenever in the<br />
opinion of any of them territory integrity, political independence or<br />
security of any of the parties is threatened. There is other language<br />
in the ANZUS agreement which has much more clear and automatic<br />
responses whereas this is very much an agreement in the family of the<br />
agreements that we have under the FPDA and with Papua New<br />
Guinea. </p>
<p>Can I also say that Indonesia has no such agreement with any other<br />
country. This is the first agreement of its kind. It has made clear its<br />
non-aligned status, but that said, this is the first agreement of its kind<br />
with any country and as I say, it is an agreement in the genre or in the<br />
family of those we now have with Malaysia and Singapore and Papua<br />
New Guinea.<br />
J: .( inaudible) Coalition support for this? Is this a bipartisan issue?<br />
PM: I would hope so. I think that there has been a strong degree of<br />
bipartisanship about issues relating to the security of Australia. We<br />
have seen that around ANZUS. We have seen it around other treaties<br />
and I expect we will see it around this.<br />
J: Are you interested in pursuing more bilateral agreements with other<br />
regional countries?<br />
PM: Not necessarily, no. I think, if you look at our immediate area we have<br />
the Declaration of Principles with Papua New Guinea. We have this<br />
agreement of treaty status with Indonesia and then with Malaysia and<br />
Singapore we have the five power defence agreement which includes,<br />
of course, New Zealand.<br />
J: Prime Minister, you said in the Financial Review that East Timor does<br />
remain a problem for Australia and for Indonesia and you think it<br />
should be dealt with. What do you mean by that, are you simply<br />
raising a point whenever these discussions come up or..<br />
PM: Indonesia has come from, in a post colonial period, a country virtually<br />
destitute in terms of resources and wealth to a country growing at eight<br />
or nine per cent a year now, which has got a substantial economy,<br />
where the distribution of wealth is widening, where prosperity is<br />
becoming obvious for anybody who visits and now it is playing a larger<br />
role, of course, with APEC, with the ASEAN Regional Forum and to<br />
some substantial extent in international terms that is marred by the<br />
difficulties it has had with Timor. I think this is a problem for Indonesia,<br />
but I think the Indonesian government thinks this too and I'm sure it is<br />
thinking about ways in which this matter can be accommodated within<br />
the plurality of that sprawling archipelago of ethic groupings and<br />
religious groupings.<br />
J: What can you do?<br />
PM: That is, principally, for Indonesia to think of. I mean, we have all got<br />
ideas of what they can do, but it is not, I think, my place here to be<br />
telling Indonesia what it might do about it. But, it certainly has been<br />
my place in the past to say that we believe respect for human rights<br />
and the liberties of individuals is upper most in any society. </p>
<p>J: Prime Minister, could Indonesia improve its agreement standing with<br />
us and others by being more frank in its acknowledgment of its<br />
mistakes in East Timor such as the Diii massacre.<br />
PM: Well, I think, there is a great, you know, if you look at the<br />
contradictions of Indonesia, you have had debate about the closures of<br />
newspapers last year and yet AlVI Australia television a lot of ABC<br />
content, items of television content which go to our values, the rights of<br />
individuals, Timor, all these issues, are beamed into Indonesia every<br />
day of the week. The growth of satellite television received material,<br />
there are satellite dishes popping up all over the country. This is a<br />
place which doesn't have that tightness that you see in authoritarian<br />
regimes. It is a country that is growing. President Soeharto is opening<br />
the economy up by one successive deregulatory package after<br />
another, he has signed up and is, of course, the founding person in the<br />
APEC declaration at Bogor. So, any leader in any government which<br />
is opening its economy up, growing its private sector, trading with the<br />
rest of the world can't hope, as I'm sure the President doesn't for a<br />
moment, that Indonesia's political society and polity is in some way<br />
constrained or perpetually constrained.<br />
So, I think, we need to understand that contradiction. Yes, you will see<br />
examples of what we believe are incursions against free speech, but<br />
what you are also seeing is a massive opening up of the economy and<br />
a huge deluging of that society with news and views and information<br />
from all around the world. We can all nominate some exceptionally,<br />
tightly run societies, this is not one of them.<br />
J: Do you believe this move will have the support of Australian public<br />
opinion?<br />
PM: I think so and when ever we have seen polling on this, when asked the<br />
question whether a serious and important relationship with Indonesia<br />
is in Australia's best interest, it is always answered in an overwhelming<br />
way. I think, Australians have got a very mature view about this. This<br />
is our largest nearest neighbour, we are bound to them by our<br />
geography in perpetuity and we have to build the structures that<br />
provide the trust and the integrity of developing our relations together<br />
and having our impact upon the region.<br />
J: Prime Minister, does this agreement puts in a position where Australia<br />
might have to choose between Indonesia and one of its other friends in<br />
a situation where, for example, of a contretemp between Indonesia and<br />
say Papua New Guinea, in the past Indonesia and Malaysia..<br />
( inaudible)..<br />
PM: Indonesia and Papua New Guinea have a document themselves about<br />
lessening tensions, about doing things each party undertaking<br />
things to lessen tensions. None of our friends in the region are likely, </p>
<p>in any way, to threaten Indonesia and I believe that Indonesia has no<br />
territorial designs on Papua New Guinea and they have made clear in<br />
their official text how important it is to keep those issues down. So, I<br />
don't see this as a real possibility.<br />
J: from the Australian side, was part of it a concern within the<br />
government about Indonesia's part in the post-Soeharto period?<br />
PM: No, it is just that we have gone on for too long saying to one another<br />
privately that President Soeharto's government has held this sprawling<br />
archipelago together, of diverse ethnic and religious groupings, but we<br />
have never made in any formal way or put together in any formal way<br />
the gestures which make this clear. In many respects the Australia-<br />
Indonesia debate has been, in a sense, compromised by the sole<br />
issue of Timor and it is the responsibility of every Australian<br />
government, certainly this is my view, that it is the responsibility of the<br />
government to have a proper broad relationship with our largest<br />
nearest neighbour. You might remember, in 1991, just before I had the<br />
first Caucus vote on the leadership, I said then, that Indonesia was the<br />
country with which we are yet to put the full constellation of foreign<br />
policy instruments in place and relationships in place. And while we<br />
have got a good and, I think, enduring relationship now which has<br />
come from the work of Gareth Evans and Robert Ray and others and, I<br />
hope, my own, I think, this anneals those efforts, polishes those efforts,<br />
provides a framework for those efforts which makes clear that the<br />
government of Australia regards a relationship with Indonesia as<br />
central to its view of the region.<br />
J: Is part of your reason for going to Malaysia to speak with Dr Mahathir<br />
about this matter..<br />
PM: I would be very surprised if Malaysia, like Singapore, wouldn't regard<br />
this as a completely healthy sign for stability in the region, in the area,<br />
and I had thought in fact I had discussed going to Malaysia with Prime<br />
Minister Mahathir during the Commonwealth Heads of Government<br />
Meeting in New Zealand and my firming up of the dates of a visit is one<br />
I am going to make now in conjunction with delivering the Singapore<br />
Lecture in Singapore. You might recall that the Commonwealth Heads<br />
of Government Meeting was a meeting held before the APEC meeting<br />
in Osaka and it was at the APEC meeting in Osaka that final<br />
substantial agreements were arranged between President Soeharto<br />
and myself. So, my visit to Malaysia was really set before this was set<br />
in place.<br />
ends </p>
