PI: Can I first say I am delighted to be making my first<br />
visit to the Republic of Korea. Korea is a long<br />
standinq friend and trading partner of Australia and<br />
an increasingly influential player in regional<br />
affairs. It is therefore valuable to have this<br />
opportunity to zeet President Kim Young-Sam and to<br />
talk with him about our bilateral relationship and<br />
also the wider interests we share in the region.<br />
Could I say that this morning I had an excellent<br />
discussion with President Kim and we covered a lot<br />
of ground and I was struck by the extent of our<br />
agreement on all the issues we discussed. As a<br />
career politician I took pleasure in congratulating<br />
bin on being Korea's first civilian President in<br />
more than thirty years. I also congratulated his on<br />
the support he has received for his bold program of<br />
economic and government reform.<br />
He talked about Worth Korea, including the nuclear<br />
program and he thanked me for Australia's strong<br />
support on that issue, we talked in detail about the<br />
Important relations each country has with the United<br />
States, Japan and China. We agreed on the need to<br />
maintain our close defence alliance with the United<br />
States and to develop, in addition, security<br />
dialogues with regional countries. We were in firm<br />
agreement on APEC, on the need to carry forward its<br />
trade liberalising agenda. We also agreed to hold,<br />
as soon as possible, a meeting of APEC leaders. We<br />
discussed our bilateral relationship between<br />
Australia and Korea and agreed it was in sound<br />
shape. We talked about the need to have our economic<br />
relationship expand and diversify and to take<br />
advantage of Australia's standard of skills in areas<br />
like telecommunlcations, computer software and<br />
environmental technology. We agreed to establish a<br />
joint economic committee of senior officials which<br />
will provide a more integrated apprQach to Our<br />
widening relationship. overall( a'-;. jectie! n -n </p>
<p>I FL. 2<br />
this visit re 3dtaol13ft a stronq worxina<br />
relationship with Presidenr Aim and his Government;<br />
to carry forvard our dialogue on APEC and other<br />
regional iseues and overall to demonstrate<br />
Australia's p-tential to have a wider economic<br />
relationship vith lorea. I thInk we've made a good<br />
start. And nov I as happy to take your questions.<br />
J: Kr Prime Minister, could you tell us regarding the<br />
regional security dialogue, could you expand on it?<br />
Would It be an 3EC-3Le multilateral forum?<br />
PH: go, no we see APEC as having a role in the econmic<br />
dialogue as essentially an economic institution. lut<br />
a wider regional security dialogue can occur outside<br />
Of the formal treaty arrangements between the United<br />
States and Korea, the United States and Japan and<br />
the United states and Australia. That is, instead of<br />
simply along those lines of treaties and formal<br />
discussions we can also have discussions about<br />
security issues within the region.<br />
J: I have two questions. Number one, you were<br />
mentioning about upgrading the current APEC<br />
ministerial meeting to a Summit. How do you propose<br />
to resolve the problem of representation by the socalled<br />
" three Chinas' Chinese Taipei, Hong long<br />
and Mainland? my second question is also on the<br />
regional security dialoque. There are speculations<br />
here that security dialogue will take place within<br />
the existing frameworks of APEC and ASREXM' TANC.<br />
How so you expect to develop those two frameworks<br />
and do you see any competition between those two?<br />
PM: I don't see APEC having a role in regional security<br />
issues. It is one which has been currently built<br />
around that is, any economic discussion<br />
built around the post-ASAN Ministerial Council<br />
Meeting. And that I think is working quite well and<br />
providing a discussion beyond the formal treaty<br />
discussiofs which most of us have been in. On A PEC<br />
itself I think that one of the matters which I'll be<br />
speaking to the Premier of China about will be the<br />
prospect of China's representation at an APEC<br />
leaders' meeting and its views in relation to the<br />
other economies of Taiwan and Kong Kong. And I think<br />
that maybe after that time we'd be able to have a<br />
clearer idea of where China and the other economies<br />
stand. Suffice to say I'd be very surprised it China<br />
wouldn't see an invitation by President Clinton to<br />
covens a leaders' meeting as an opportunity.<br />
J: Prime Minister you talked in your speech today about<br />
asking America to convene a meeting. Are you putting<br />
pressure on then to convene the meeting and when do<br />
you think it might be? I<br />

PIE: No, I think that were APEC countries to be<br />
represented on a leaders basis it would give it more<br />
political authority and therefore the horsepower it<br />
meds to do things. But aqain, that's not A matter<br />
-of urgency from our point of view. I think it ought<br />
to happen but it's not a matter of urgency. Ad<br />
therefore while there has been some interest on the<br />
United states in coneidering holding such a seeting<br />
Svhether it is this year or next year or the year<br />
after I think is Immaterial to the holding of<br />
It. So, ye're not putting any pressure on the United<br />
States to hold a meeting. Ta is a view coming from<br />
within the adinistration about the usefulness of<br />
AP<br />
J: Australia enjoys more than two billion dollars trade<br />
surplus with Korea, but actually Australia levies<br />
more than thirty percent on imported Korean<br />
textiles, fabrics and cars. Korea only levies at ton<br />
percent of custom tariff and so that means<br />
( inaudible).. another barrier for that. And also<br />
Australia is one of the major countries to<br />
( inaudible)... for the anti-dumping to the Korean<br />
oommodities. So what do you think about that, and<br />
the second thines is there is a little<br />
disappointment from the Korean side because this<br />
time there are no ministers or high ranking<br />
officials from the trade side it seess like<br />
Australia is not putting their efforts to<br />
diminishing trade surpluses with Korea.<br />
P: I think there a just a couple of points to make<br />
about that. The first is that Korea has a, largely,<br />
balance of trade with the United States but ye have<br />
a large imbalance of trade with the United States.<br />
Our current account deficit is of the order of about<br />
sixteen billion and we have a trade deficit with the<br />
United States of the order of about seven billion.<br />
So, what may be your trade surplus, from time to<br />
time, with the nited Statesis our trade deficit.<br />
And I think seeing that in the broad picture is the<br />
vay to see it. Secondly, and I think the reason why<br />
we say have a surplus with Korea at the moment<br />
and I emphasize at the moment is that your<br />
economy has been growing quite strongly and<br />
therefore you have been requiring raw materials<br />
etcetera from Australia. We. on the other hand, have<br />
been growing over the last couple of years quite<br />
slowly. And therefore the demand for Korean exports<br />
has been slower and therefore, in a sort of<br />
temporary way, that trade gap has opened. As we<br />
speed up I think you'll see a more even and more<br />
natural balance in the trade.<br />
PH: On the other questions of access, Australia will<br />
have a general manufacturing tariff of 5 per cent by<br />
1997 and 15 per cent for motor cars. No quotas.<br />
Complete transparency, no quota..', a provides " th. </p>
<p>TEL: 4<br />
opportunity for any country that's competitive and<br />
that includes Korea to seek to sell its products<br />
within Australia. So, we are preaching the lowering<br />
of trade barriers and we are doing what we preach.<br />
Finally, anti-dumping measures affect about i per<br />
cent only of Korean exports to Australia. I think<br />
it'es just a handful of cases. fe don't use antidumping<br />
measures as a protective device. And the<br />
other thing is, I think, Korea Is currently<br />
exaaining the adoption of Australian. anti-dumping<br />
techniques and policies for its own economy. So,<br />
that tends to suggest to me that the Government of<br />
Korea understands this point vell if others don't.<br />
J: Inaudible.<br />
PH: In answer to the last part of the question, that Is<br />
the first I've heard of that notion and certainly<br />
that is the notion that one should have a caravan of<br />
business people with one to denote one's seriousness<br />
about issues. This is not the view of the<br />
Government of Korea, I am sure. The President<br />
didn't raise the question of anti-dumping today. He<br />
alluded to the trade surplus but in the context of<br />
Australia supplying Korea's inputs for its worldwide<br />
trade and therefore, its trade balances with other<br />
countries to whom it supplies goods offsets the<br />
imbalance Australia enjoys with Korea for its raw<br />
materials. I think the President also understood my<br />
point, that is that with tariffs coming down to very<br />
low levels by the late 1990s, a total absence of<br />
quotas and total transparency in protection that<br />
there are opportunities to grow and we can see that<br />
in the very rapid 20 per cent growth of exports in<br />
the last year. Exports from Korea to Australia.<br />
So, I think the Government of Korea sees this in a<br />
proper economic and trading context.<br />
J: Priame Niister, have you perceived yet any Korean<br />
interest in our land debate on Aboriginal land title<br />
and if there is any interest or knowledge what's<br />
been the reaction to some of the more vigorous<br />
opposition to the land title movement?<br />
P1: No, there was no reference to it whatsoever.<br />
J: Could you explain what are the priorities for the<br />
Joint Economic Committee? Can you also comment on<br />
why it was established as a ministerial group as is<br />
the case I think, with our two other major trading<br />
partners, Japan and the United States, given the<br />
rapid growth Korea has as our major trading partner?<br />
PM: Well I think as In many things one is better to feel<br />
one's way before one dashes to a ministerial group<br />
and much can be gained, I think, by a bette.<br />
understanding of the two econoit.* ou; tIh. e two;.<br />

bureaucracies each having a better knowledge of the<br />
@ thor country and the issues in trade and<br />
Ivestment. That will be the primary focUs of this<br />
buresacratic ~ ruin Tat in to understand the<br />
issues in tra r* n" nveetmekat and to understand<br />
then in sucb a way as to be able to ef feet changqes<br />
between the two countriles which enlhanlce our trade<br />
and investment opportuftities. We think there is a<br />
great complementary quality In these two economies<br />
and even though we have a substantial trade between<br />
us It has been to date largely centred around raw<br />
materials and we need to diversity that Into<br />
manufactures and services from bot directions so,<br />
this would be the purpose of the group. Thatos not<br />
to say there will stil1 lof course be meetings of<br />
Foreign Ministers and Trade Ministers periodically,<br />
and Industry Ministers an was the case with Minister<br />
LOO's visit here recently.<br />
Prime Minister, what sort of ass5esmet did you get<br />
froom President Kim about the North Korean decision<br />
to back away from the earlier decision to quit the<br />
NPT!. Did you get a sense that it's a permanent<br />
decision or that North Koreans might revisit back<br />
and acre broadly, whtat sort of assessment did you<br />
get on the state of tension?<br />
H: Well, I think the President made clear to me that he<br />
was pleased by the halt to the withdrawal by worth<br />
Korea frou tihe Nuclear non-Proliferation Treaty and<br />
International Atomic Energy Agency processes and<br />
inspections. So far as it gooe, the halt is at<br />
least a step in the right direction thouqh it<br />
doesn'lt resolve the question of international.<br />
inspections, credible International inspections of<br />
North lorea's facilities. I made clear to the<br />
President that Australia does support credible<br />
international inspections of North Korea's<br />
facilltips and of course, we both agreed the<br />
Peninsula would be better without the further<br />
development of nuclear programs leading to weapons<br />
and the influence this may have in deutabilislng or<br />
upsetting at least the region in torus of strateg ic<br />
concerns. So I thInk the President was happy Vith<br />
Australi; FS view which we had put not ju~ st privately<br />
but in international for&amp; which We bad put publicly:<br />
On the second part of the question about tensions on<br />
the Peninsula, a very large part of North Korea's<br />
GRP is spent on defence. From memory upwards' Of<br />
per cent from an econoImy Which in somewhat<br />
debilitated, this ts a very large expenditure and a<br />
shift of resources# an unwarranted shift of<br />
resources this Obviously makes for tension not just<br />
in the Peninsula but in the area because we're led<br />
to believe that China does not support the<br />
development of a nuclear WeaPOO-8 , Agram by-North.<br />
Korea either. But again, IWtjb n(* ~ p~ a~ </p>
<p>TEL 6<br />
the Governmen~ ft in Korea, the Goverl3Oft Of 1orea has<br />
lwivihe tis ansoflnow for Many years and t<br />
tink waths tsanSn that context a debate<br />
oant~ ilbd to at least no vithdrawal from th04 e<br />
aslin resumption of discussionsU about the LIport<br />
ofa North Korean Naclear Program-<br />
3: I know there are a lot of Koran compatriots in<br />
Australia. Do you hove any policy in the future to<br />
accept more Korean Lumigrants and if you have any<br />
such policyo plea" s let us know.<br />
PI: Well, Australia has the highest per capita<br />
immigration~ policy in the western world. We take<br />
sore people per head of populationl if you take a<br />
five year average at any time than any comparable<br />
Country. Australia has a non-dism intr<br />
Limiration program, that is non-discriminatory as<br />
to race or religion. There is a perception in the<br />
Korean consciousness through your education system a<br />
knowledg 0Of hustralia's migration program in the<br />
past whch discriminated In favour of furopeans.<br />
This has long since p66sed twenty years ago and that<br />
io why now we have got a very multicultural<br />
Population with almost half the intake each year now<br />
coming from Asia. SO this is a substantial change<br />
on twenty year. ago and that is why nov there is a<br />
very substantial Korean population in Australia, a<br />
very large Vietnamese comunity, a very large<br />
Chinese community, a substantial Japanese coiMunity<br />
along with communities froz the Middle East, Western<br />
ftropeo etc.<br />
J: PriNe Minister, from your discussionstdy i Q<br />
got any Indication at how Korea perceive todyde q<br />
prospect ' Of Australia becoming a republic an4<br />
whether that would have any spin-of fs in terms of<br />
Our acceptance In the region or our trading<br />
relationships?<br />
PIw Woo there was no expressed reference to Australia<br />
becoming a republic. itiki onre uha<br />
Korea they expect a natink to manis ownh atny<br />
and T think that point ie trosably beont destny<br />
for then. Pobbybeodcosn<br />
Thank you one and all.<br />
