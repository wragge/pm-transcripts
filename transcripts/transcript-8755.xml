PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, TIlE HON PJ. KEATING, MP<br />
GOVERNMENT SUPPORT FOR CHRISTMAS APPEALS<br />
When I launched the Sl. Yin-cent de Paul'sChristmas Appeal-in Bankstown on 27<br />
November, I said the Government would look at ways of getting. extra assistance to<br />
those families who are doing it hard this Christmas.<br />
I am pleased to announce today that the Government will match dollar for dollar<br />
cash donations by the Australian public to major voluntary agencies for their<br />
Christmas appeals.<br />
We will build upon the generous contributions of Australians to material aid<br />
organisations like the Smith Family, St Vincent de Paul and the Salvation Army.<br />
These contributions enable agencics to provide tangible assistance such as toys and<br />
presents for children, food hampers and Christmas dinners to thousands of<br />
Australians so that they can enjoy the sort of Christmas that most of us take for<br />
granted. This is a time when some money to help can go a long way. We call upon the<br />
Australian people to open their hearts and their pockets and give to help those in<br />
need this Christmas.<br />
