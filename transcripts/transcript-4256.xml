ELECTORAL TALK<br />
The Federal Treasurer, Phillip Lynch, renewed the Government's<br />
offer of a fair and reasonable partnership for foreign investors<br />
when he addressed a conference in Sydney this week.<br />
He was careful to emphasise that the Government's priority<br />
remains domestic economic policy. There is good reason, he<br />
reported to the conference in Sydney, for confidence in Australia's<br />
economic prospects.<br />
The Treasurer reminded the overseas businessmen that Australian<br />
strategy is squarely in line with international views on<br />
economic management. He repeated the Government's resolve to<br />
deal with the economic problems which we inherited.<br />
For rural industry in Australia there is nothing new in the<br />
message that the fight to control inflation and restore economic<br />
stability must take priority.<br />
The last few years have been difficult ones for farmers. Yet<br />
unless we successfully attack inflation there will not be the<br />
jobs or the incentive to invest on which primary industry and<br />
manufacturing industry both depend.<br />
The Government has taken a series of major steps aimed at<br />
restoring profitability to industry. To make more resources<br />
available to the private sector, some $ 2.6 million was sliced<br />
off forward estimates for the current year, thus holding growth<br />
in the budget back to 11%.<br />
We did that to make more money available to taxpayers and to<br />
other spheres of Government.<br />
This has been particularly important for Local Government,<br />
which are now receiving a guaranteed share of national income<br />
tax revenue.<br />
Threir proportion of the revenue this year will increase by<br />
percent to 140 million dollars.<br />
Legislation to give effect to this grant will be coming into<br />
Parliament shortly. it will reach local governments, once<br />
procedures are established, as an annual lump sum early in<br />
each financial year. / 2 </p>
<p>Your Government has taken this action because we consider<br />
that the burden on ratepayers in many parts of Australia<br />
4 have been too heavy.<br />
This is especially so in rural areas and we hope that<br />
Shire and Municipal Authorities will now, with these<br />
additional funds, be able to hold rates steady, or even<br />
reduce them.<br />
There are always requirements for more funds. There are<br />
always good uses to which Government authorities can put<br />
extra dollars.<br />
But when the. Gross National Product is static or actually<br />
declining, as it was for the last year or two of the last<br />
government, then all spheres of government must understand<br />
that they cannot go on taking more and more out of the<br />
pockets of taxpayers and ratepayers.<br />
As wall as the new level of assistance for local government,<br />
we will be introducing in this session of Parliament,<br />
legislation for an Income Equalizatian Deposit Scheme.<br />
The scheme will be brought in to apply to income earned this<br />
year. 0<br />
The Income Equalization Deposit. Scheme is a long term measure<br />
designed to produce more equitable taxation for farmers who3e<br />
incomes fluctuate wildly because of weather, or world commodity<br />
prices. It will not help those farmers this year who have little or<br />
no income at all. But it is evidence of the Government's<br />
firm desire to. see primary industry put back on a sound<br />
footing.<br />
Another long term reform will be the establishment of a rural<br />
bank. This is going ahead. We hope that existing banks will<br />
take part in it but if they do not wish to be involved the<br />
rural bank will be established in any case.<br />
As well as being able to provide long term finance, the<br />
Rural Bank will have funds available for the purchase of<br />
equipment so that farmers do not have the burden of high<br />
interest rates under hire purchase agreements.<br />
Many other measures have been taken since the Government<br />
came to office. Some of them short term, others long term.<br />
None of these measures alter the fact that general economic<br />
recovery is critical for a restoration of profitability for<br />
rural industry.<br />
That recovery has begun. It is clearly going to be slow<br />
after the battering which the economy took under the former<br />
administration.<br />
We said before the last election that it would take a full<br />
three y', 7-ars. Ho-, yevecr I wcald liie o rcucto the wu:; ds<br />
of the Treasurer when he was speaking to international<br />
investors in Sydney this week there is now good reason for<br />
confidence in Australia's economic prospects. </p>
