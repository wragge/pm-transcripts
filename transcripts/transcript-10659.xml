<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It is not a rich man's package. It is a package that will</p>
<p>   encourage average Australians to work harder. It will protect low</p>
<p>   income earners but most importantly of all it will help the whole</p>
<p>   country to grow stronger and that is why I am so committed to it.</p>
<p>PEACOCK:</p>
<p>Now essentially this new GST that you are putting in is the tax</p>
<p>   for the States, it'll be paying the States' way. Why would</p>
<p>   they want it when currently their income is growing by 3.6, I think,</p>
<p>   a year and your growth estimate is at 2.7, they'd be losing</p>
<p>   wouldn't they?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No they won't. Over a 10-year period from just after its introduction</p>
<p>   this will produce, we estimate, about $25 billion more revenue than</p>
<p>   they would receive under the present arrangements. The States for</p>
<p>   time immemorial have said they wanted a growth tax, well now they</p>
<p>   have it.</p>
<p>PEACOCK:</p>
<p>Well is that growth assured with the Asian economies the way they</p>
<p>   are?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well is anything, you know, anything in relation to growth at a</p>
<p>   particular level assured. You can't do better than to say to</p>
<p>   the States, you want freedom, you want the capacity to have a growth</p>
<p>   tax, you want that independence, well here it is. No Prime Minister</p>
<p>   has in the history of Federation made a more generous offer to the</p>
<p>   States of Australia.</p>
<p>PEACOCK:</p>
<p>So we put that GST aside and we then look at the income tax cuts</p>
<p>   and the various other changes that you are making, where are you</p>
<p>   getting the money for them?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well there's a combination of things. We are obviously, because</p>
<p>   of the GST, you get a growth dividend, you get dividends from the</p>
<p>   black economy and you get some money out of the surplus and if you</p>
<p>   look at the figuring you find in different ways contributions are</p>
<p>   being made. And it's a very balanced package and, of course,</p>
<p>   it all adds up. </p>
<p>PEACOCK:</p>
<p>Isn't all that money though available to equally to Labor</p>
<p>   without a GST, I mean they can raid the surplus just the same as</p>
<p>   you have and they can try to get the black economy as everybody</p>
<p>   has always promised but never delivered?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well the last person to promise personal tax cuts without restructuring</p>
<p>   the system was Paul Keating before 1993. Remember L-A-W law, what</p>
<p>   did he do? He whisked away the tax cuts and for good measure he</p>
<p>   put up all of the existing indirect taxes without giving the pensioners</p>
<p>   and the battlers any compensation. The Labor Party if it wins the</p>
<p>   next election will do the same thing. So I say to the Australian</p>
<p>   people, beware of Labor Party leaders offering tax cuts without</p>
<p>   a GST.</p>
<p>PEACOCK:</p>
<p>So your answer is yes, Labor could do it but it is a question of</p>
<p>   credibility, you don't think they would?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Not only it is a question of credibility but this package is interlocked.</p>
<p>   You can't start putting and taking without the whole thing</p>
<p>   unraveling. And if you look at the detail of it you will see that</p>
<p>   many of the dividends that enable certain things to be done are</p>
<p>   as a consequence of the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax,</p>
<p>   the cash flow benefits that go to small business won't be there</p>
<p>   without the GST. The reductions in business costs. You can't</p>
<p>   give the bush a $3.5 billion cut in fuel costs without the changes</p>
<p>   that we have proposed.</p>
<p>PEACOCK:</p>
<p>Okay, what about the tax mix? Now there is, you have agreed, some</p>
<p>   switch in the mix. There's a switch of what is it, $10 billion</p>
<p>   between income tax and indirect taxes?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well it's in the order of 0.7 per cent of GDP which incidentally</p>
<p>   is virtually the same as the indirect tax increases that Mr Keating</p>
<p>   and Mr Beazley hit us with in 1993 without any compensation for</p>
<p>   the battlers and the pensioners.</p>
<p>PEACOCK:</p>
<p>Now in terms of the equity of this package, it appears to favour</p>
<p>   upper income people just as much, if not more.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, no it doesn't because you don't just look at the</p>
<p>   dollar amounts. It stands to reason that somebody on $100,000 will</p>
<p>   in dollar terms get an attractive tax cut because he is already</p>
<p>   paying a lot of tax. But if you look at the proportionate increases</p>
<p>   the greatest proportionate beneficiaries are middle income families.</p>
<p>   I mean look at this, a dual income family 9.9 per cent on $35,000,</p>
<p>   you are not going to tell me that person's elite are you?</p>
<p>PEACOCK:</p>
<p>Same list though if we look at it Prime Minister....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It's a very good list Matt, it's a very, very good list.</p>
<p>PEACOCK:</p>
<p>$5,000 income, they get a benefit of 2.4 and if you go to the top</p>
<p>   of the scale they are getting 6.7 per cent.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes but have a look at the middle there, I mean don't ignore</p>
<p>   the middle. It's fantastic 9.9 per cent, beat that.</p>
<p>PEACOCK:</p>
<p>I can see this argument can go on for some time. How much time</p>
<p>   do you think it should go on for, I mean we haven't had time</p>
<p>   to examine it. Do you think we need until Christmas for the population</p>
<p>   to understand it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Matt, I said before it was released that I would allow sufficient</p>
<p>   time to the Australian people to understand it.</p>
