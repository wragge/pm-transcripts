TRANSCRIPT OF PRESS CONFERENCE AT RICHMOND RAAF BASE -04/ 02/ 86<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, there were a lot of concerns about the<br />
conditions of these planes. You expressed some yourself before<br />
you finally agreed that this would go ahead. I assume that now<br />
those concerns are over you are happy with the state of the plane<br />
and the condition of it?<br />
PM: well, obviously it is more important that those who have an<br />
expert knowledge be happy about this and I am assured that they<br />
are and I accept their indications. It has taken more time and it<br />
has been somewhat more expensive than we were originally led to<br />
believe. I think some 4,000 plus hours have been involved, as I<br />
am told, in refurbishing this plane and getting it ready for its<br />
operations. And again I pay tribute to the Air Force, our great<br />
Royal Australian Air Force for the work they have done as well as<br />
the other people that have been involved. Yes, I am told that it<br />
is right because we have to remember that the conditions there<br />
under which they will be operating are very, very difficult.<br />
There is further work to be done in Bordeaux in France in regard<br />
to heavy air frame work but from what they tell me, they are<br />
confident that it is going to pass those tests there in Bordeaux.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, what is the extent of the Government's<br />
generosity on this occasion? How much has it cost?<br />
PM: Well, the estimate for the refurbishing of this aircraft,<br />
the one aircraft, is about $ 1.5 million which is beyond what we<br />
were lead to believe originally.* It was thought that we might be<br />
able to do two for about that price. But at the same time the<br />
level of demand and need in Ethiopia is declining somewhat, so we<br />
will review the operation of this aircraft and just see how it<br />
goes. But the important thing is that this great aircraft is in<br />
good shape to do the important job it will be doing on behalf of<br />
all of Australia.<br />
JOURNALIST: And what about the operating costs? There was some<br />
talk a while ago that Mr Geldof was a little disappointed that we<br />
weren't helping foot that bill?<br />
PM: Well, no, we made it quite clear what we were doing and the<br />
operating costs can be met in a variety of ways. I note that they<br />
are looking at a variety of sources of funds. They will be met. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Can you give any guarantee if there will be a second<br />
plane?<br />
PM: Well there is not a question of a guarantee at this point.<br />
We will examine how this one operates and we'll be guided by the<br />
indication of the needs that exist. Let me say that I am informed<br />
that the level of monthly distribution in tonnage is estimated to<br />
be dropping from 10,000 tonnes per month, I believe, to about<br />
5,000 tonnes per month in March and it may be down to about 2,500<br />
tonnes per month in May. There has been a significant and<br />
unforeseen improvement, so the level of demand may not be as<br />
great as when we were first talking about this.<br />
JOURNALIST: Who will be guiding you on that the Red Cross?<br />
PM: Yes. They are the people with whom we are specifically<br />
dealing? JOURNALIST: Does the extra cost in refurbishing this plane make<br />
the Government a bit more reluctant to do another?<br />
PM: Well, it coincides, as I say, with a reduction in the level<br />
of tonnages which need to be distributed because there has been a<br />
number of things happening. There has been an opening up of the<br />
road system in Ethiopia beyond what had previously been<br />
anticipated. And with that and other changes that have occurred,<br />
the level of need is not as high as it was. So we will look at it<br />
JOURNALIST: When will you make that decision?<br />
PM: Well, we will be informed by those who are operating there<br />
constantly on how it is going. That information will be fed<br />
through to us from now on. But all I am saying is on the material<br />
that I have read just recently, it raises the question of whether<br />
the level of need for aircraft will be as high as when we first<br />
made the decision to make two available.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, you spoke about a review of this aircraft.<br />
When would that be likely to come?<br />
PM: I am really talking about a review of the need generally.<br />
Obviously we will have reports as to how this aircraft is going.<br />
But that was not put in terms of saying its operation is in a<br />
conditional state. It is not. We are now ready to go and there is<br />
a job to be done. The only question is whether into the future<br />
the level of need that was put before where two were talked about<br />
is going to be the case.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, given the decision that the<br />
Government has finally made to supply this aircraft for the Red<br />
Cross, have you set a precedent now where you may, shall we say,<br />
be requested for further supplies of similar material in the<br />
future? PM: I don't know about precedents. We were confronted, the<br />
people of Australia were confronted with a extraordinary<br />
situation of vast human need there and clearly it was appropriate </p>
<p>to make a response which was within our capacities. Now, I don't<br />
talk about precedents in these sorts of situations. We look at<br />
need as it arises. AS I say, it is not only externally, in this<br />
country at the moment we have a disaster which has hit us with<br />
Cyclone Winifred and it's pleasing that in those circumstances,<br />
some of the same sorts of resources are immediately available to<br />
assist need in this country. I repeat the services that are<br />
provided by our armed forces, the Air Force, the Army and Navy<br />
are often overlooked in what they do in Australia. So I think<br />
it's a matter of pride to us all that as well as having very<br />
efficient armed services in this country which carry out their<br />
primary responsibility, they are also there to be called upon in<br />
circumstances like this and within Australia.<br />
JOURNALIST: Right, Mr Hawke, just the fact there is a shortfall<br />
of airlift capability in the Air Force and the fact that these<br />
things have been sitting unsold for 7-8 years. Would there be any<br />
thought to in fact keeping them in Australia for this sort of<br />
work? PM: well, the decision about the overall disposal or retention<br />
of aircraft is a matter for the Defence Forces themselves. I am<br />
not here to make an off-the-cuff decision in the light of the<br />
provision of this aircraft as to what the decisions of our armed<br />
forces will be about their equipment. Our main thought in<br />
Government since we have been in is to ensure that the equipment<br />
needs of armed services, including the Air Force, are met. The<br />
major concentration of our significant and steady increase in the<br />
real levels of expenditure for the armed services has been<br />
centred upon equipment. We want to make their equipment as<br />
relevant and modern as we possibly can. AS that is done,<br />
obviously there will be other equipment which becomes<br />
obsolescent. Now, how that is disposed of is obviously a matter<br />
primarily of decision for the forces concerned.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, about the university in Sydney's west. Do<br />
you have any view either way on whether or not there should be<br />
one here? There is a recommendation.<br />
PM: Well, that is something that is being looked at.<br />
JOURNALIST: Can I just ask you what the latest is as far as<br />
is concerned? I<br />
PM: Yes, I asked the Minister for Primary Industry, Mr Kerin, to<br />
go up there immediately. He did that yesterday, went up there<br />
early morning and I am now awaiting a report from Mr Kerin and,<br />
of course, we have indicated, and I asked him to indicate that<br />
the processes of emergency relief will be put in train. We will<br />
be awaiting a report from the appropriate sources including a<br />
report from the Queensland State Government. The normal resources<br />
of the disaster relief, emergency relief will be made available.<br />
JOURNALIST: Members from the Caucus Economic Committee have made<br />
comments about what might happen with the falling oil prices.<br />
what do you predict at this stage? </p>
<p>4<br />
PM: Well, I am glad to notice Mr Brown, in his statement and in<br />
his subsequent statements on the radio can be expressed, as he<br />
should do, his complete confidence in the Government's handling<br />
of this matter. We will be, as we have made it clear, considering<br />
a submission on this matter in the relatively near future and we<br />
will be making those decisions which are necessary for the<br />
continuation of the sound economic policies which we have<br />
provided for this country in the three years we have been in<br />
Government. We have done the job, if I might say so, admirably to<br />
this point. We are going to continue to do it.<br />
