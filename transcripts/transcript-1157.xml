COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA<br />
SPEECH BY<br />
The Rt. Hon. SIR ROBERT MENZIES,<br />
M. P.,<br />
ON<br />
DAUSTRALIAN ECONOMY<br />
Ministerial Statement<br />
[ From the " Parliamentary Debates," 21st September 1965]<br />
Sir ROBERT MENZ[ ES ( Kooyong-<br />
Prime Minister).-I present the following<br />
paper-Economic Inquiry-Report of Committee<br />
( Volumes I and 11 and Index).<br />
I am not proposing to move that the paper<br />
be printed because, as honorable members<br />
will understand from a glance at the bulk<br />
of the report-a bulk that is not at all out<br />
of place-a number of minor corrections<br />
and alterations of form have come up on<br />
" vision for incorporation. These, of course,<br />
being dealt with. None of them involve<br />
substance. They will not affect the reading of<br />
the report by honorable members. But it<br />
does seem to me that when the paper comes<br />
-~ form part of the Parliamentary Paper<br />
ies it is desirable that it should be in<br />
cs final corrected form. Therefore, I intend,<br />
if the House will agree, to present the report<br />
later in its final form in substitution for<br />
what I present today. Ont that occasion I<br />
will move that the paper be printed. Even<br />
then, I would value some discussion at that<br />
time with the Chairman of the Printing<br />
Committee because some arrangements are<br />
in hand for publishing this in book form,<br />
as he will understand. I have arranged for<br />
the report in the form in which I have presented<br />
it to be circulated to honorable members.<br />
Now I ask for leave to make a<br />
statement in connection with the report.<br />
Mr. SPEAKER.-There being no objection,<br />
leave is granted.<br />
Sir ROBERT MENZIE! 3.-On 1 3th February<br />
1963, 1 announced the appointment<br />
of a Committee of Economic Inquiry, consisting<br />
of Dr. J. Vernon--now Sir James<br />
11886/ 65 Vernon-Professor Sir John Crawford, Professor<br />
P. H. Karmel of Adelaide, Mr. D. G.<br />
Molesworth * and Mr. K. B. Myer. These<br />
are all men of distinction in economic and<br />
business affairs; they have devoted immense<br />
effort and much time to their labours, and<br />
have produced a report of great significance.<br />
Some suggestions made by the Committee<br />
are not acceptable to us, but this does not<br />
qualify our deep appreciation of the Committee's<br />
work.<br />
In reading the report, honorable members<br />
will have in mind the terms of reference.<br />
They are set out on page 1 of the report,<br />
and I therefore do not need to refer to<br />
them in extenso. They sought an inquiry into<br />
and a report upon many questions of fact<br />
and of tendencies having in mind that the<br />
objectives of the Government's economic<br />
policy are a high rate of economic and<br />
population growth with full employment,<br />
increasing productivity, rising standards of<br />
living, external viability, and stability of<br />
costs and prices".<br />
We were asked by the Chairman, before<br />
the terms of reference were finally settled,<br />
to add a clause that would enable the Committee<br />
to suggest steps which appear to<br />
be necessary or desirable to conform with<br />
and further the objectives of the Government's<br />
economic policy This, for reasons<br />
which will appear later in this statement,<br />
the Government refused to do. But it did<br />
add to the terms of reference the final<br />
clause-The Committee will report the conclusions<br />
reached by it as to the bearing which all or any<br />
of the matters so ascertained have upon the<br />
achievement of the economic policy objectives<br />
above stated. </p>
<p>I mention these matters at the outset, because<br />
it is necessary to have them in mind<br />
when considering some aspects of the report.<br />
For the truth is that, in addition to an<br />
exhaustive and most valuable examination<br />
of the facts involved in the terms of<br />
reference, the Committee has in fact, in<br />
many instances, offered its opinions or suggestions<br />
on matters of policy. We have no<br />
feeling of resentment about this. Indeed,<br />
we should perhaps have realised from the<br />
beginning that a group of -talented men<br />
charged with this task would wish, having<br />
made their statistical and other investigations,<br />
to examine the bearing of the results<br />
upon the general economy and thus to offer<br />
opinions or suggestions. But it will at once<br />
be seen, Sir, that the report, because of<br />
the facts concerning the terms of reference<br />
which I have just related, must be read<br />
and evaluated subject to two reservations.<br />
The first is that, in a free and self<br />
governing country, policies will be political.<br />
Under the party system, opposing political<br />
parties will, not infrequently, have opposing<br />
policies. In no case is a political policy<br />
the product of purely expert opinion on<br />
technical matters. It must cover a wide area<br />
of localities and circumstances. It must<br />
be flexible enough to meet the problems of<br />
international and domestic change. It is<br />
commonly pursued and applied in the light<br />
of much accumulated experience and<br />
political judgment.<br />
Secondly, it follows that, when it deals<br />
with statistical or technical or objectively<br />
economic matters, this report is entitled to<br />
and will be studied with profound respect.<br />
My own Government will derive great<br />
value and assistance from it. But where<br />
the report makes what will doubtless be<br />
regarded as advices on political policies,<br />
such advices must be regarded, in the wellknown<br />
legal phrase, as obiter dicta, and<br />
not as possessing Iome binding authority.<br />
No government, from whatever side of the<br />
House it may come, and indeed no parliament,<br />
can abdicate its own authority and<br />
responsibility for national policy. It will<br />
welcome the assistance of experts, but its<br />
tasks will take it far beyond the limits of<br />
economic expertise. Political policy in a<br />
democratic community does not depend<br />
upon purely economic considerations. I will<br />
come back to this when I have something to<br />
say about the various proposals made by<br />
the Committee for the establishment of advisory bodies in various fields. But at this<br />
stage it might perhaps be useful to offer a<br />
general view. That general view may be<br />
illustrated by a particular example in<br />
relatively recently Commonwealth history.<br />
In the early 1940' s, proposals were submitted<br />
to the Australian Agricultural<br />
Council which, as honorable members<br />
know is a ministerial body, for the establishment<br />
of an institute of agricultural<br />
economics, with wider functions and powerthan<br />
the present Bureau of Agricultmu<br />
Economics, and with complete freedom<br />
independently to carry out and publish the<br />
results of research into a whole range of<br />
matters affecting primary industries. These<br />
proposals were rejected, as my friend ti<br />
honorable member for Lalor ( Mr. Pollar<br />
will recall, for reasons which were admirably<br />
summed up by the present permanent<br />
head of the Department of Primary Industry<br />
when he made his presidential address<br />
to the annual conference of the Australian<br />
Agricultural Economics Society in Sydney<br />
in February 1963. I quote his words-<br />
Governments were asked to finance an organisation<br />
removed from political control which could<br />
report on the matters of policy but let the chips<br />
fall where they may. It is not hard to imagine<br />
Governments shying away from the concept of a<br />
body which was committed to publish all its reports<br />
and advice on policy but whose findin<br />
could be used in evidence against Governmen,<br />
which did not adopt them. On matters of fact<br />
there could be little argument, political or otherwise,<br />
against immediate publication; on matters of<br />
policy it could quite often happen that the published<br />
report of the independent authority pre--<br />
sented only half the story. To be realist;<br />
Governments----We are speaking about Governments from<br />
both sides of the Househave<br />
political convictions which might not<br />
always be in line with the philosophy espoused by<br />
the Institute. What the protagonists of this scheme<br />
were really supporting was a system where policy<br />
should be guided only by expert advice when<br />
policy is often a compound of a number of<br />
factors, only one of which can necessarily be<br />
expert advice.<br />
Dr. J. F. Cairns.-Now the Prime<br />
Minister is getting ready to throw out the<br />
report. Sir ROBERT MENZIES.-So far I have<br />
proceeded, I venture to say from the ocular<br />
demonstration, with the great approval of<br />
those on the other side of the chamber who<br />
have had experience in these matters.<br />
Dr. J. F. Cairns.-We will see whether<br />
we agree with it. </p>
<p>Sir ROBERT MENZIES.-The honorable<br />
member never agree; with his leaders.<br />
I do not care a hoot whether he disagrees<br />
with me. He is looking forward to a govern<br />
ment of economists, and will profess to be<br />
one. It will, of course, at once appear to<br />
honorable members that, if the only problems<br />
in dealing with economic policy in a<br />
nation were purely technical, Parliament,<br />
,' T1( ich is not technical, and a Cabinet which<br />
-:) not technical might as well hand over to<br />
a group of technicians. In such a case<br />
democracy would have cceased and a technocracy<br />
would have begun. In this matter,<br />
of course, my views are in common with<br />
,2%, ose of the real leaders on the other side<br />
, c the chamber. We hope and believe that<br />
these observations, which it is necessary to<br />
make, will not be misunderstood or resented<br />
by the Committee which has served us all so<br />
well. When honorable members look at the<br />
magnitude of the volumes which I place<br />
before them, they will at once realise that<br />
to invite Parliament to discuss the report<br />
too soon would be to ignore the importance<br />
and complexity of the re: port and to ask<br />
Parliament to summarise and absorb in a<br />
days matters of such moment as to<br />
-pquire prolonged examination. Since the<br />
Government received this report, members<br />
of the Cabinet have devoted to it weeks of<br />
study and Cabinet itself days of discussion,<br />
and even now I would say that we are not<br />
a position on many of the matters<br />
ii. tamined by the Committee to offer definitive<br />
views or, in some cases, useful comments.<br />
At one stage we thought we might try to<br />
produce a precis or sumrrary of the report<br />
in order to help not only honorable members<br />
but the public generally to appreciate<br />
the matters involved.<br />
Mr. Webb.-When is the Prime Minister<br />
going to put on the black cap?<br />
Sir ROBERT MENZIES.-Does the<br />
honorable gentleman not want to hear about<br />
this? A precis for him would need to be<br />
childishly simple. This is notorious. Every<br />
time he opens his mouth he proves it.<br />
Mr. Bryant.-Where is the report, anyhow?<br />
Sir ROBERT MENZIE;.-It is here, Sir. Mr. SPEAKER.-The honorable member<br />
for Wills will restrain himself.<br />
Sir ROBERT MENZIES.-Let the honorable<br />
member have a copy of the report. He<br />
says: Where is the report? I have tabled<br />
it. Mr. Hayden.-The Prime Minister does<br />
not understand the report.<br />
Sir ROBERT MENZIES.-I could never<br />
aspire to the honorable member's profound<br />
intelligence. I admit myself his humble<br />
inferior, but at least I have devoted weeks<br />
to studying this report. He has devoted<br />
weeks to thinking only of silly interjections.<br />
We have decided that to try to produce a<br />
precis of the report would not be practicable.<br />
Any summary which was brief enough<br />
to be read would be open to the criticism<br />
that some matters dealt with by the Committee<br />
had not been included. Any summary<br />
which strove to avoid this criticism would<br />
tend to become so long that it would become<br />
too long and not adequately readable.<br />
What we must, I think, face up to is that<br />
this report, the result of most valuable and<br />
painstaking and conscientious examination,<br />
has a magnitude both in scope and detail<br />
never approached by. any former inquiry.<br />
It would not achieve its purpose if any of<br />
us yielded to the temptation to take individual<br />
observations out of context. It is<br />
therefore, we think, important that, the report<br />
having been tabled-I am sure that<br />
the Leader of the Opposition will agree with<br />
this-Parliament should have a full opportunity<br />
of reading it and considering it before<br />
any debate on its contents occurs. It<br />
would be doing less than justice to the Committee<br />
and its report if we were precipitately<br />
to engage in argumenfs which did not<br />
arise from a full opportunity for consideration<br />
and judgment.<br />
However, in tabling the report after a<br />
period of time in which the Government<br />
has had a chance of examining and considering<br />
it, I will make some observations<br />
which may be helpful. I do not, of course,<br />
propose on behalf of the Government to<br />
make any dogmatic remarks. But I will take<br />
two examples which will serve to illustrate<br />
the differences which exist between a purely<br />
economic approach and the necessarily<br />
wider and more complicated approach of<br />
the political policy maker. One is migration.<br />
On this, the Committee has suggested that </p>
<p>the net immigration target should not be<br />
raised above 100,000 a year, at least until<br />
the late 1960' s.<br />
We, while respecting the reasons submitted<br />
by the Committee, are bound to take<br />
into account a variety of factors. The contribution<br />
made by migrants to the development<br />
of Australian resources depends upon<br />
more than overall numbers. The higher the<br />
percentage of wage-earners-and particularly<br />
of the types or skills that we need<br />
-the less important will it be to restrict<br />
overall numbers. Migrants of the type we<br />
want are not equally available from year<br />
to year. Circumstances in what I will call<br />
the " supplying" nations will vary from<br />
year to year, and so will the emigration<br />
attitudes of the Governments of those<br />
nations. Add to this that the building up of<br />
our population by migration has enormous<br />
significance for the growth and security of<br />
Australia and for that business confidence<br />
which promotes investment and expansion,<br />
and it will be clear tl. at the Government<br />
cannot accept an artificial ceiling on migration<br />
for a term of year3. We will therefore<br />
continue our present policy of securing as<br />
large a flow of migrarts as Australia can<br />
usefully absorb, and of deciding the target<br />
number each year.<br />
My second example has to do with the<br />
problem of economic growth. I had something<br />
to say on this in my policy speech<br />
before our last election. I said-<br />
We will press on with growth in no timid or fainthearted<br />
way. We believe, and confidently expect<br />
that over the next five years, given good government,<br />
growth should at lea: e; quta l a total increase<br />
of 25 per cent. in the gross national product, in<br />
terms of constant prices.<br />
What I stated there was a belief that,<br />
given certain fundamental conditions our<br />
economy, drawing upon its known resources,<br />
energies and capabilities and obeying<br />
its ordinary initiatives, was equal to adding<br />
a full quarter to the " real" national<br />
product over a five year period.<br />
The Committee, however, goes a good<br />
deal further than this. Its approach in fact<br />
is basically different. It appears to set up<br />
a certain rate of growth, measured statistically,<br />
as something very like a ruling purpose<br />
for economic policy-although, to be<br />
sure, it recognises that the achievement of<br />
this growth rate should not be pursued to<br />
the detriment of all other objectives. It<br />
suggests that a growth rate of 5 per cent. per year is possible but difficult; a good part<br />
of the report thereafter is devoted to the<br />
question of how the difficulties might be<br />
overcome. In the process, a thesis appears<br />
to be developed that this 5 per cent. growth<br />
rate will be achieved only if there is a conscious<br />
diversion of resources from some areas<br />
of activity to others. Amongst these preferred<br />
areas of activity, manufacturing<br />
industry is given high place.<br />
But this view of things leads on to<br />
considerations of the very first consequenc'<br />
By what means is this diversion of resources<br />
to be accomplished? Indeed, as a matter of<br />
basic policy and interest, are we disposed<br />
to engage in a large scale diversion of<br />
resources-in defiance, as it were, of tl<br />
distribution that would occur if the norm.<br />
demands of the community and the corresponding<br />
initiatives of producers were to<br />
be given free play? After all, we are a<br />
private enterprise economy. In such an<br />
economy, the demands set up by the people<br />
who are the buyers are the normal stimulant<br />
for increased industrial investment and<br />
activity. What the Committee appears to<br />
have had in mind is that those demands<br />
should, where necessary, be re-directed.<br />
Now, in individual cases we would not care<br />
to deny this. We have ourselves, in pur<br />
suance of our own economic policies, take<br />
action now and then to reduce the demand<br />
for some particular commodities in order<br />
to meet some inflationary position; and no<br />
doubt any government would continue to do<br />
so. But to essay a widespread re-directio'"(<br />
of'resources within the economy to achieJ)<br />
some pre-ordained statistical result is a very<br />
different matter.<br />
It seems to us that the Committee has,<br />
particularly in the light of its so-called projections<br />
in Appendix N-to which I will<br />
later make some reference-predicated<br />
a degree of planning and direction of the<br />
economy which in our opinion would not be<br />
either appropriate or acceptable in Australia.<br />
I can illustrate this by saying something<br />
about its proposals on the use of taxation<br />
for the purpose of diverting resources to<br />
selected purposes. The Government is a<br />
protectionist" government and has a firm<br />
belief, well justified in the light of events,<br />
in the significance and future of manufacturing<br />
industry. I do not need to elaborate that.<br />
But when the Committee develops its<br />
theories we must sound a note of warning. </p>
<p>For example, it proposes that toencourage<br />
manufacturing industry, there should be programmes<br />
involving various incentives and<br />
more generous depreciation allowances.<br />
Now all of these, no doubt, have merits<br />
which deserve proper consideration. We<br />
have, in fact, had some of them under<br />
scrutiny. But, setting aside the possible-or, some<br />
might say, the probable-long term benefits,<br />
lheir immediate result would be to diminish<br />
revenues. And particularlynow when<br />
e burden of defence expenditure is not<br />
only large but growing anC. at a time when<br />
employment is not only full but in some<br />
occupations over-full, this would confront<br />
11he Government with a choice between<br />
, f1icit budgeting-at a time when inflationary<br />
pressures are high-and increasing other<br />
taxes. The Committee, though no doubt it<br />
realised these matters, alo proposes that<br />
the Government should increase its taxation<br />
anyhow more than its expenditure in order<br />
that by this means-that is. surplus budgeting-<br />
saving for public authority expenditure<br />
should increase.<br />
Along with this it suggests that there<br />
should be various tax concessions for business.<br />
This leads to the clear inference that,<br />
there must in its view be increased taxes<br />
r a variety of purposes, these should fall<br />
tlargely upon personal incomes or upon consumer<br />
goods. It seems to us, however, that<br />
if there were to be a series of increases in<br />
personal taxation, this could very well reduce<br />
,.-Ivings and thereby reduc'e investible capital,<br />
well as demand. Quite conceivably, therefore,<br />
it could defeat the purpose which the<br />
Committee appears to have in mind, which<br />
is to increase investment in industrial<br />
enterprise. I emphasise that we are not offering dogmatic<br />
views. On the contrary, we will continue<br />
to give the deepest consideration to<br />
what has been put before us by so powerful<br />
a Committee. But we dowant to take this<br />
early opportunity of saying to the House<br />
that taxation policies are affected by many<br />
considerations. Some of them are economic;<br />
some of them, particularly at the present<br />
time, are international; some of them are<br />
domestic. No government can, in pursuit of<br />
a general theory, abdicate its responsibility<br />
for a taxation policy which may well vary<br />
from year to year according to circumstances<br />
of inflation or stability or recession<br />
or, as we now know, f~ om a large and growing diversion of resources to the defence<br />
of the country, the preservation of its<br />
future, and the giving of appropriate aid<br />
to other countries, particularly those which<br />
are facing the acute problems of new independence<br />
and a search for economic<br />
autonomy. I now turn to the views expressed by the<br />
Committee on investment from overseas.<br />
The general approach of the Government<br />
to such investment was stated by me, on<br />
behalf of the Cabinet, in the policy speech<br />
of 1963, as follows-<br />
Investment from overseas countries has taken<br />
an important place in our economy. Over the last<br />
fifteen years it has amounted to over œ 1,500 million.<br />
This investment has produced great advantages,<br />
but under some circumstances produces problems<br />
which need to be handled with care and understanding.<br />
As, from a national Australian point of<br />
view, we would wish to see new capital from<br />
overseas employed for the great purpose of developing<br />
new industries or extending existing ones with<br />
all the benefit of overseas skills and experience,<br />
we will always have a particularly warm welcome<br />
for new capital designed to these ends.<br />
We also believe that fears and misunderstandings<br />
are least where there is an Australian participation<br />
in shareholding and management, and most<br />
when there is no more than a mere change of<br />
ownership without more. There is, we believe, a<br />
growing recognition of this in the minds of intending<br />
investors.<br />
I quoted that because it is sometimes forgotten<br />
that that was the view of the Cabinet,<br />
as expressed by me in 1963. Nobody would<br />
quarrel with it today.<br />
The terms of reference to the Committee<br />
invited a factual assessment of the significance<br />
of overseas investment in the Australian<br />
economy. The Committee has gone<br />
beyond this. It has offered a view that it<br />
would be in the best interests of Australia if,<br />
for some years ahead, new capital from<br />
overseas could be limited to the level of<br />
recent years, that is. about œ 150 million<br />
per annum. It has proposed selective<br />
controls on overseas investment and suggests<br />
a consultative body to advise the Reserve<br />
Bank on the administration of such controls.<br />
We express no opinion on these suggestions<br />
at present. We have been making<br />
the necessary preparations for a full<br />
Cabinet review of the problem, the practical<br />
difficulties of which, I hope, we all<br />
recognise. We will, when all Ministers<br />
have been able to participate in it, make a<br />
considered statement of policy on these<br />
matters. But, so that no prejudgments one </p>
<p>way or the other may arise from the<br />
Committee's report, I should issue a warning<br />
note. The Committee itself says that<br />
overseas investment has been " a powerful<br />
force assisting the growth of the economy<br />
That is right. It acknowledges that increases<br />
in population, productivity and employment<br />
in the postwar period would have been hard<br />
to sustain without it.<br />
Mr. Jones.-What does the Minister for<br />
Trade and Industry say about it?<br />
Sir ROBERT MEN ZIES.-He agrees<br />
with every word I am &amp; aying, if that is of<br />
any interest to the honorable member.<br />
Mr. Jones.-He mentioned selling a bit<br />
of the farm every year.<br />
Sir ROBERT MENZIES.-The honorable<br />
member will never read the report. He<br />
will live on a few slogans. So I continue<br />
with this considered statement about the<br />
report. So far, I would think we were all<br />
on common ground.<br />
Dr. J. F. Cairns.-Hear, hear!<br />
Sir ROBERT MENZIES.-Oh, the boy<br />
is at it again. The report goes on to raise<br />
two major questions, the answers to which<br />
are of great importanca to all of us on<br />
both sides of the House. The first is: Will<br />
the cost of servicing overseas investments<br />
become unduly onerous in our balance of<br />
payments? Dr. J. F. Cairns.-That is the end of the<br />
common ground, is it not?<br />
Sir ROBERT MENZIES.-How does the<br />
honorable member know? Listen to him. He<br />
is the only fellow who understands these<br />
things. The second major question is: Is<br />
there a danger of having too great a proportion<br />
of the ownership of enterprises in<br />
Australia in foreign hands? We need not<br />
worry about this. These are two decidedly<br />
important questions. That is why I said,<br />
although the honorable member was so busy<br />
talking that he did not hear, that the<br />
answers to these are of great importance to<br />
all of us on both sides of the House. It is<br />
not my purpose, in this statement, to give<br />
definitive answers to these questions. The<br />
Government will certainly continue to face them, and will seek to arrive at balanced<br />
judgments. As to the first question, the<br />
Committee says that the costs cannot so far<br />
be said to have represented a serious<br />
balance of payments problem. But it is<br />
apprehensive about the future.<br />
Mr. Reynolds.-I bet it is.<br />
Sir ROBERT MENZIES.-May I repeat,<br />
for the benefit of one or two honorable<br />
members opposite, that the Committee sa<br />
that the costs so far cannot be said to ha" v.<br />
represented a serious balance of payments<br />
problem, but it is apprehensive about the<br />
future. It has made a statistical projection,<br />
commencing with the year 1959-60-because<br />
most of -these projections begin<br />
that year-which leads it to the conclusion<br />
that, by 1974-75, the servicing of overseas<br />
investment will become a severe burden on<br />
the balance of payments. We do not brush<br />
this problem aside. It will be considered and<br />
dealt with. But in the meantime one comment<br />
must be made, so that a proper perspective<br />
may be achieved. It can be calculated<br />
that had the assumptions used by the<br />
Committee, as from 1959-60, the beginning<br />
year, been borne out-their assumptions,<br />
that is, in respect of earnings on capital<br />
invested here and profits retained in AiV&gt;*<br />
tralia-and given the actual capital inflort/<br />
that has taken place, the amount of income<br />
payable abroad, on their projection, in the<br />
past five years would have been of the order<br />
of œ 860 million. But, in fact, we know from<br />
statistics already published that -the amour<br />
of income actually payable has been abou,<br />
œ 250 million less than this. As honorable<br />
members will see, the point of this comment<br />
is, not that we ignore -the problem or its<br />
possible magnitude, but that, as the Committee<br />
in its report said, very wisely,<br />
" attempts to forecast in quantitative terms<br />
the behaviour of the economy 10 or<br />
years ahead are extremely hazardous, can<br />
prove positively misleading, and are almost<br />
certain to be inaccurate"'. There is one, so<br />
far, in which the inaccuracy is œ 250 million.<br />
The answer to the second question, that<br />
relating to the foreign ownership of Australian<br />
enterprises, is also one not to be<br />
hastily arrived at. As I indicated on behalf<br />
of the Government in the policy speech of<br />
1963, we much prefer what might be called<br />
developmental investment to takeovers of<br />
existing enterprises involving a mere change </p>
<p>of ownership. But again, the Committee's<br />
report, based upon its statistical projections,<br />
must be read with some reserve. Thus, the<br />
Committee, starting its calculations with<br />
1959-60, with a figure of 25 per cent. of<br />
foreign ownership of Australian companies,<br />
calculated that by 1964-65 the percentage<br />
would have risen to 34 per cent. But in<br />
fact, because the circumstiinces do change,<br />
an estimate for 1964-65 based on the<br />
Committee's own assumpticon makes the pro-<br />
-' jtion less than 24 per cent. In other words,<br />
/ has fallen since 1959-60. None of this is,<br />
of course, to say that projections ought not<br />
to be attempted as aids to thought and<br />
exposition. What I have said is by way of<br />
warning-for the reasons stated by the<br />
) mmittee itself-against regarding statis-<br />
,, cal prophecies as having some binding or<br />
even highly persuasive authority. The circumstances<br />
change from time to time, both<br />
internationally and domestically, and it is<br />
the task of statesmanship to deal with them<br />
as they arise, and, of course, to anticipate<br />
them if possible.<br />
Nothing I have said subtracts from the<br />
central truth, on which the Committee and<br />
the Government are at one, that capital<br />
inflow, in the long term, is not to be<br />
-regarded as. the solvent of balance of pay-<br />
' Knts difficulties. As a Government, we<br />
pay constant and positive attention to<br />
increasing our exports and to the trend and<br />
nature of our imports, so that, while we<br />
welcome the arrival of that really productive<br />
-\ apital which a developing country needs,<br />
should not become so dependent upon<br />
it for our overseas balances as to threaten<br />
our own national control over our national<br />
development and resources. I said earlier<br />
that I would make some reference to some<br />
of the Committee's particular recommendations<br />
for the appointment of special<br />
independent commissions or councils. It<br />
will be sufficient for my purpose to mention<br />
two of the most significant, because one<br />
cannot cover the whole of this ground. The<br />
Committee has suggested the setting up of a<br />
Special Projects Commission with the power<br />
to investigate proposals for major developmental<br />
projects, to advise -governments on<br />
them, and to publish its findings. True, the<br />
Committee perceived that there were, and<br />
are, difficulties in arranging for projects<br />
involving the agencies of more than<br />
one government. This fact has substantially<br />
affected our own method!; of dealing with such problems over many years. But the<br />
Committee believes that these difficultiesmight<br />
be largely overcome if an independent<br />
Special Projects Commission were created<br />
with power to investigate proposals for major<br />
development projects. The Commission would<br />
need a skilled staff to carry out cost-benefit<br />
analyses, which we consider a necessary basic<br />
step in project planning. The Commission should<br />
investigate projects at the request of the Commonwealth<br />
or State Governments, or on its own<br />
initiative. Finally, and most important, the Commission<br />
should be required to report to the Commonwealth<br />
Parliament on its activities each year,<br />
giving detailq of investigations requested, those<br />
completed, and the stage reached with those<br />
uncompleted. Now I point out that the Commonwealth<br />
Government has available to it some<br />
extremely expert advisers already, such as<br />
the Bureau of Agricultural Economics, the<br />
Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial<br />
Research Organization, the Bureau of<br />
Mineral Resources, the Snowy Mountains<br />
Authority, and other bodies forming part<br />
of or serviced by the Department of<br />
National Development. The point of distinction<br />
is that these agencies, in relation<br />
to any special project, advise the Government<br />
and enable it to conduct informed<br />
discussions with the relevant State or States,<br />
which also have experts of great ability and<br />
experience. The Special Projects Commission suggested<br />
by the Committee is an entirely<br />
different thing. It is to investigate projects<br />
at the request of the Commonwealth or<br />
State Governments or on its own initiative.<br />
It is to report to the Commonwealth Parliament<br />
so that its views will be publicly<br />
known and may come to achieve a degree<br />
of authority. To the extent that this result<br />
came about, both Commonwealth and State<br />
Governments, whatever their party complexions,<br />
would find themselves subject to<br />
pressure, and even coercion into the adoption<br />
of policies or projects which, between<br />
them, they might not select at all. Add to<br />
this that all projects involve the expenditure<br />
of public funds, some of them on the<br />
grand scale. I do not believe that any<br />
government, responsible for its own budget<br />
and conscious of the impact of its own<br />
budget upon economic policy generally,<br />
would be content to transfer authority in<br />
these fields to an independent body acting<br />
on its own initiative and with no responsibilities<br />
to the government of the day. </p>
<p>I may tell the House, if it needs to be<br />
informed, that my own Government, at an<br />
earlier time, gave the closest thought to<br />
suggestions that have been made for some<br />
kind of development commission and rejected<br />
the idea, substantially for the reasons<br />
that I have just menticoned. I find it difficult<br />
to imagine that another government<br />
drawn from the present Opposition would<br />
take any different view.<br />
The Committee has also suggested the<br />
formation of an " Advisory Council on<br />
Economic Growth", with a wide charter<br />
and powers, which " would be of material<br />
assistance to the government and to the<br />
community in general in the making of<br />
economic decisions These words clearly<br />
contemplate-as indeed does the nature of<br />
the suggested Advisory Council-that the<br />
views of the Council would be published<br />
from time to time and that those views<br />
would be designed to advise the Government<br />
in relation to the making of what must<br />
be, though of course related to economics,<br />
high decisions of political policy. We<br />
unhesitatingly reject this idea.<br />
Mr. Reynolds.-Is tue Prime Minister<br />
accepting any of this report?<br />
Sir ROBERT MENZIES.-When the<br />
honorable member has read the report he<br />
will be able to answer that question. He is<br />
all right. He is a great education authority.<br />
He should get busy reacing the report.<br />
Mr. L. R. Johnson.--The Prime Minister<br />
is politely rubbishing this report.<br />
Sir ROBERT MENZIES.-My politeness<br />
might well be imitated by the honorable<br />
member. In the Australian democratic<br />
system of government based upon the consent<br />
of a free community, no government<br />
can hand over to bodies outside the government<br />
the choice of objeczives and the means<br />
of attaining them in important fields of<br />
policy, particularly when such bodies<br />
would, through the power of publication,<br />
come to exercise what have described, I<br />
hope not extravagantly, as a coercive influence<br />
upon governments. There is a very<br />
great difference between the appointment of<br />
a special committee, like the one whose report<br />
is now before us, and the giving of<br />
publicity to its views, because such an<br />
appointment is purely ad hoc; it is set up,<br />
as was the Brigden Committee many years ago, to give us all the benefit of a close<br />
and primarily factual review of the<br />
economy as a whole. To have such a body<br />
continued in one form or another as a standing<br />
body of what would come to be regarded<br />
as authoritative advice would have the<br />
dangers I have described. Political policies<br />
cannot be based upon pure economics and,<br />
for the sake of the adequate handling of<br />
international problems, of defence, and of<br />
social and industrial justice and progress,<br />
we hope they never will.<br />
The Committee's terms of reference included<br />
an inquiry into the availability of<br />
credit. Its chapter on this subject concludes<br />
with a paragraph proposing a full-scale<br />
study of the credit system. I should say<br />
word about this. As honorable membe. j<br />
will understand, inquiries into the monetary<br />
and banking system of a country are major<br />
matters. They involve investigations of a<br />
long and closely detailed kind, not only<br />
within the main elements of the banking<br />
system and other financial institutions, but<br />
also among those interested in, or affected<br />
by, money and banking, which means, of<br />
course, virtually the whole community.<br />
Such inquiries, fascinating though they are<br />
to many, should be initiated only when there<br />
are very strong reasons for doing so.<br />
Dr. J. F. Cairns.-Are they not?<br />
Sir ROBERT MENZIES.-No. A glance<br />
back at history here and elsewhere would<br />
show that they have arisen only in particular--<br />
situations calling for far-reaching investigL<br />
tions. We are not in any such situation now.<br />
Indeed, if there is one broad conclusion to<br />
be drawn from the review which the Committee<br />
has made, it is that on the whole<br />
our monetary system has functioned pretty<br />
well. Furthermore, we would have the greatest<br />
reluctance in proposing an inquiry which<br />
could or might be taken to portend further<br />
major changes in the banking structure. For<br />
a period of 15 years beginning with the<br />
banking legislation of 1945, there was great<br />
turmoil and contention and much parliamentary<br />
debate in that area. Our 1959<br />
legislation, which separated the Corporation<br />
banks from the Reserve Bank, appears to<br />
have proved its own merit, not least by<br />
achieving a settlement of large issues. We<br />
would not wish to raise doubts as to the </p>
<p>continuity of the existing legislative arrangements.<br />
The Committee has raade various proposals<br />
which affect tariff policy. So far as the<br />
Tariff Board is concerned, it is clear that<br />
certain of the proposals are far-reaching and<br />
probably contentious, going beyond an<br />
evaluation of actual protection and bearing<br />
on protection policy. Perhaps I might, with<br />
advantage, because I do not want to answer<br />
all those questions, state again what I said<br />
here in the House when I announced our<br />
decision to institute the inquiry. I said<br />
then-The Government wishes to make it clear that it<br />
has the firmest intention of preserving the full<br />
independence of the Tariff Board as an advisory<br />
body established by Parliament, its system of open<br />
. and public inquiry and it. h; ig h public standing<br />
and prestige. These things are of the very essence<br />
of the Tariff Board system which has, over many<br />
years, served Australia well and has won admiration<br />
and respect overseas.<br />
The Tariff Board is, to repeat, an advisory<br />
body. It is not a policy-making body-although<br />
its recommendations necessarily have a considerable<br />
influence on policy-and it is not an executive<br />
body. Its principal and best-known function<br />
is to consider, on reference from the Government,<br />
applications for protection by way of tariffs<br />
or bounties or, alternatively, proposals for the<br />
reduction of such protection. It also has power on<br />
its own initiative to review existing duties, to con-<br />
': C2l-duct inquiries on certain matters and to report<br />
su to Parliament.<br />
But tariff policy as such is the responsibility of<br />
the Government. Only Parliament can enact<br />
tariffs; only the Government proposes tariff legislation<br />
to Parliament.<br />
The Committee's observations on protection<br />
S and the Tariff Board should and will be<br />
if/ examined against the principles which I<br />
have just stated.<br />
I conclude by expressing the hope that<br />
it will not be thought that, because we<br />
have found it necessary to single out some<br />
important matters for special commentand<br />
in some cases for Government decision-<br />
we are intending to qualify the value of this report as a whole. On the<br />
contrary, and to take only a few examples,<br />
the report will prove, and is proving, of<br />
great value to us in the consideration of<br />
such matters as research and development,<br />
decentralisation, the application of research<br />
to primary production, rural credit, the<br />
form of the tariff, and the role and functioning<br />
of the Tariff Board. In all of these<br />
a great deal of work is being done, and<br />
will be all -the better done in the light<br />
of the Committee's report. We acknowledge<br />
the value of the Committee's observations<br />
on export promotion, in which field<br />
we have been and are greatly assisted by<br />
the confidential and therefore frank advice<br />
given to us for some years by the Export<br />
Development Council.<br />
There are many other matters covered<br />
by the report. They are all being put in<br />
study by the relevant Ministers and, where<br />
necessary, by the Cabinet, and can be dealt<br />
with as they arise in debate. I will not<br />
overload an already long statement by trying<br />
to mention them all. The whole report<br />
is such that we would not wish honorable<br />
members, or the the public generally, to<br />
pay attention to special parts of current<br />
interest, while neglecting the whole.<br />
I therefore conclude by repeating that<br />
although, as it seemed to us to be necessary,<br />
I have indicated some queries and perhaps<br />
some criticisms, we are convinced that<br />
every part of the report will deserve the<br />
closest study. It will provide all interested<br />
persons, whether technical or not, with a<br />
compilation of economic information<br />
unequalled in my time in this Parliament.<br />
It is a fortunate country which can enlist<br />
in its voluntary service men of such experience<br />
and distinction as those who constituted<br />
this Committee.<br />
I present the following paper-<br />
Economic Inquiry-Report of Committe-<br />
Ministerial Statement, 21st September 1965.<br />
BY AUTHORITY: A. J. ARTHUR, COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT PRINTER, CANBERRA.<br />
