SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
21ST ANNUAL JOINT MEETING OF THE AUSTRALIA/ JAPAN<br />
AND JAPAN/ AUSTRALIA BUSINESS COOPERATION COMMITTEES<br />
MELBOURNE 26 OCTOBER 1983<br />
It is with great pleasure that I join you tonight<br />
on the occasion of your twenty-first Joint Meeting.<br />
Your committees have been at the forefront of<br />
extraordinarily productive exchanges over the years to the<br />
benefit of both our countries.<br />
Your success demonst. rates very clearly how a close<br />
relationship can flourish when people from two countries sit<br />
down and discuss common problems in a frank and open manner.<br />
Your efforts have contributed importantly to<br />
broadening our two countries' understanding of each other.<br />
They have strengthened the relationship and<br />
provided a sound basis for growth in mutual trade.<br />
But we cannot afford to rest on the gains already<br />
achieved. I<br />
The recession has made deep inroads into overall<br />
growth of global output, employment and international trade<br />
and has seen measures adopted which are seriously eroding<br />
efficiency in the use of national and international<br />
resources. Both Australia and Japan have a shared interest in_<br />
redressing this situation.<br />
We have a joint interest in the maintenance and<br />
extension of an open trading and payments system.<br />
It may be the case that little more than half of<br />
the value of world trade is now transacted on the basis of<br />
the non-discriminatory provisions of the GATT system and<br />
that bilateralism has increasingly come to supersede<br />
multilateral approaches. </p>
<p>But as countries whoze prosperity critically hinges<br />
on vigorous growth in international trade we need to act<br />
together to enSUre the. mainteniance oL conditions necessary<br />
to a strong and resilient world economic and trading system.<br />
I can think of no better place to start than with a<br />
rev-iew of issues current in the Australia/ Japan trading<br />
relationship. Contemporary Australia is dedicated to an open,<br />
non-discriminatory international trading system.<br />
We see our future as being closely linked with the<br />
maintenance and further development of our partnership in<br />
the dynamic economic growth of the Asia/ Pacific region.<br />
Within this region of growth, we are ready to stand<br />
on our own competitive capacity.<br />
Naturally these perceptions find a particular<br />
reflection in Australia's trading relationship with Japan.<br />
There is no doubt about the fundamental importance<br />
to both Australia and Japan of the bilateral economic<br />
relationship. It is a striking fact that. Australia's export trade<br />
with Japan is greater then our trade with our next four most<br />
important trading partners put together.<br />
Japan is now overtaking the United States as our<br />
most important overseas supplier.<br />
But if anything I fear constant reiteration of<br />
recoqnition of this interdependence over recent years may<br />
have blunted awareness of important changes taking place,<br />
particularly within Japan.<br />
The key change has been that in the last two to<br />
three years Japan ' s economic growth has slowed again<br />
following the earlier movement to a lower growth trajectory<br />
following the first oil shock.<br />
In a buyers' market Japan has cut back markedly on<br />
imports from Australia, both in quantity and price.<br />
The basic materials industries are now among the<br />
low growth sectors of the Japanese economy.<br />
It is quite possible that activit~ y in these<br />
industries may have plateaued permanently.<br />
While there will be some short-term recovery due to<br />
cyclical factors, the inescapable fact is that Japanese<br />
industry is restructuring and forward planning is directed<br />
to the promotion of high technology industry and products. </p>
<p>These industries will consume less energy and less<br />
basic metals. Fortunately for Australia, other markets are now<br />
opening up in newly industralising countries of the region.<br />
But those markets should not be considered a<br />
substitute for the Japanese market.<br />
The Japanese market will continue to be vitally<br />
important for Australia.<br />
The slower growth in total Japanese demand for<br />
resources that is now in prospect focuses attention on<br />
Japan's import souircing policies.<br />
Japan has been experiencing increasing pressure to<br />
give other resource suppliers privileged ( and, in our view,<br />
economically unjustified) access to its markets, either to<br />
offset imbalance in other parts of a larger commercial<br />
relationship or for broad political/ strategic reasons.<br />
On this point my Government was very pleased,<br />
indeed relieved, to receive the assurances the Japanese<br />
Trade Minis', ter and Foreign Minister recently gave senior<br />
Australian Ministers that Japan has no intention of solving<br />
trade problems with third countries at the expense of<br />
Australia. The Australian Government had been deeply concerned<br />
at the weight of pressure being applied to Japan and regards<br />
it as critically important to avoid a response that is at<br />
the expense of such close and reliable partners as<br />
Australia. But there is another aspect to the sourcing problem<br />
which continues to cause Australia concern.<br />
The development of equity tied mining arrangements<br />
by Japan is soon going to im,, pact heavily on both the coal<br />
and iron ore trade.<br />
I have heard it said that new Canadian coking coal<br />
mines which have significant Japanese equity and loans have<br />
contracted tonnage representing 12-15 per cent of a more of<br />
less static Japanese import demand for coking coal. This<br />
could be accommodated only if the new su~ pplies were forced<br />
into an already oversupplied market.<br />
The United States, being the higher cost producer<br />
may, as some observers suggest, be the ' swing supplier' in<br />
this sitUation. </p>
<p>But whlether or not this less ineff icient outcome is<br />
chieved depends on the the considerable bilateral pressure<br />
being exerted on Japan by the United States to ease its huge<br />
trade surplus by importing more US products, including coal.<br />
Similar factors are at work in the iron ore trade.<br />
The pattern of increased Japanese overseas<br />
investments in alternative raw material. resources and iron<br />
and steel. production could threate-n the share of the<br />
Japanese market available to more efficient Australian raw<br />
material produce-rs.<br />
For example, one major iron ore project in another<br />
country has recently received significant Japanese financial<br />
support in the form of equity and loan funds respectively;<br />
and there are commitments by Japan to purchase ore from the<br />
project when it comes onstream.<br />
For Australia this can only create problems.<br />
Maintenance or improvement of our market share will<br />
be the more difficult.<br />
For coal, both coking and thermal, the issue is<br />
more one of growing unease over the value of long-term<br />
contracts and uncertainty about the stability of the market.<br />
This has been highlighted recently by severe<br />
cutbacks on existing suppliers who have long-term contracts<br />
and proven performance.<br />
These suppliers have made investments on the<br />
assurances provided by Japanese buyers within long-term<br />
con tracts. It is a matter for regret and real concern that<br />
those assurances have not been fully honv-ured at the samc<br />
time as the buyers are mounting investments and uindertakinq<br />
commitments elsewhere.<br />
But there is another aspect to the Situation which<br />
cannot be ignored.<br />
Considerable difficulty has beeon encountered in<br />
obtaining adequate and reliable information on Japanese<br />
future demand prospects and in assessing the extent to which<br />
countracted tonnages were likely to be taken up.<br />
Levels of forecast demand have brought forth<br />
over-supply. Australian producers are now geared to supply much<br />
larger markets than are now or potentially open to them. </p>
<p>The transformation in Japan's energy demand<br />
structure and the consequent reported downward revision of<br />
approximately 20 per cent in the Japanese government's<br />
energy demand forecast for 1990 carry major implications for<br />
our energy resource trade.<br />
Obviously, Australian sales of raw materials and<br />
energy resources to Japan will remain large in absolute<br />
terms but we cannot ]. ook to the kind of cjrowth we have come<br />
to expect in the past.<br />
This ha s significant conseqnences for Australian<br />
development and for our entire induIstrial structure.<br />
For some products Australia may have to face<br />
cutbacks in sales to Japan.<br />
This is now the reality.<br />
But I believe strongly that Australia is, and will<br />
remain, a reliable, competitive supplier of resource goods<br />
and traditional commodities.<br />
This belief is grounded in recognition of:<br />
the importance of Japan's market to Australian<br />
industries serving the raw materials trade, and the<br />
associated advantages of working within a<br />
large-scale established trading relationship;<br />
the highly competitive position of Australian<br />
suppliers vis a vis suppliers in North America,<br />
China, South Africa and Latin America and<br />
the commitment of my Government to ensure that the<br />
industrial framework in Australia buttresses the<br />
underlying competitiveness of these industries.<br />
Australia should bc and oxpects to be given fair<br />
access to the presently limited Japanese market. If one<br />
party takes advantage of short-term market fluctuations to<br />
change arrangements temporarily in its own favour, there<br />
will be no satis * factory basis for long-term commercial<br />
relationships. Australia's record in handling the necessary<br />
adjustments to-dislocations in the raw materials and<br />
agricultural trade is testimony to our reliabilty as an<br />
economic partner. Australia, for example, met its full commitments to<br />
supply beef to Japan throughout the very severe drought of<br />
1982--83 and is committed to continue to do so. </p>
<p>We do not seek privileged treatment on the basis of<br />
non-commercial considerations.<br />
Australia is not in the business of seeking special<br />
favours in the international market place but asks only for<br />
a careful appreciation of our capacities and for a long-term<br />
perspective to be applied to present difficulties.<br />
We expect recognition by Japan of the'particular<br />
and enduring advantages of trading with Australia.<br />
As a country Australia has:<br />
very large reserves of a wide range of high quality<br />
minerals and other resources, particularly energy<br />
resources geographical proximity to Japan<br />
large-scale, low--cost operations<br />
political stability and<br />
common security interests and membership of the<br />
Western alliance.<br />
The continued complementarity and interdependence<br />
of Australia and Japan is an inescapable reality.<br />
This is not to deny that both Japan and Australia<br />
have a legitimate interest in diversifying supply sources<br />
and markets. The growth of Asean and of the niewly industralising<br />
countries of this region offer significant opportunities<br />
that are already of considerable interest to both Australia<br />
and Japan. Due regard must be had, however, to the effect of<br />
diversification on exisiting facilities and infrastructures<br />
established ( often on the basis of long-term contracts) in<br />
the expectation of continued non-discriminatory access to<br />
each other's markets.<br />
Australia cannot go on expanding production while<br />
some mines are selling at a loss.<br />
We need to sort out the real basis and operational<br />
validity of traditional long-term contracts with Japan.<br />
We need to achieve mutual recognition of the<br />
dangers of encouraging over-supply initially for the<br />
supplier but in the longer-term equally for the consumer. </p>
<p>This danger becomes real once market uncertainty<br />
prevents investments from proceeding and artificially low<br />
prices force the closure--or abandonment of mines and<br />
facilities that would otherwise operate economically.<br />
To avoid these problems it would be useful to<br />
increase information sharing between our industries and to<br />
develop common perceptions with competitor Supplier<br />
countries. Our membership of several international agreements<br />
and study groupe could facilitate such consultation.<br />
As a productive first step, these efforts could be<br />
directed to improving the accuracy of demand forecasts.<br />
Clearer and more effective guidelines about the<br />
future requirements of Japanese industry for Australain<br />
resource materials are needed.<br />
An equally clear statement of Australia's<br />
situation its development plans and problems would also,<br />
I am sure, be of value to Japan.<br />
Sufch matters should be the subject of effective and<br />
continuing consultations at both the business and<br />
Governmental levels. This would, I believe, be of<br />
substantial value to producers and consumers alike.<br />
Sir John Crawford's recent proposal at the<br />
Australia-Japan Economic Issues Symposium for an<br />
" international forum on security of supply and market access<br />
in the resources trade, notably in coal", is more ambitious.<br />
It is nevertheless, as recent circumstances suggest, timely;<br />
it merits serious consideration by all parties concerned.<br />
Mr Nagano,<br />
Closely linked with consideration of Australian<br />
competitiveness must be an assessment of our reliability as<br />
a supplier. Although I beli6ve concern on this point has often<br />
been exaggerated and motivated more by an interest in<br />
negotiating leverage than in realities, the point is<br />
sufficiently central to merit close attention.<br />
Last year Brian Kelman of CSR presented at this<br />
meeting a carefully considered analysis of Australian<br />
industrial relations in the context of the trade in natural<br />
resources between Australia and Japan. </p>
<p>The picture which emerged bears repeating:<br />
Time lost due to strikes in Australia was about<br />
average by world standards<br />
Most. Japanese buyers of Australian commodities<br />
experienced little or no inconvenience or<br />
additional cost due to industrial disputes in<br />
Australia There were a couple of industries in Australia with<br />
a worse than average past record, but in these<br />
cases the current situation had either improved or<br />
was improving<br />
In at least one of these latter industries, the<br />
most competitive supplies available to Japan<br />
continued to emanate from Australia.<br />
Had Mr Kelman conducted his analysis this year I am<br />
sure the picture would have been even more positive<br />
There was a significant decline in the level of<br />
industrial disputes nationwide in the 12 months to<br />
Juily 1983; only 289 working days were lost per 1000<br />
employees compared with 6-71 days the year before.<br />
In part this situation reflects the impact of the<br />
recession; it also reflects more effective industrial<br />
relations a trend which State and Federal Labor<br />
Governments are well placed to nurture, and are intent on<br />
co-operating to do so.<br />
While we can take satisfaction from this trend, it<br />
offers no grounds for complacency.<br />
Industrial disputes have caused problems which we<br />
could all have done without.<br />
Whatever the progress that has been made, room for<br />
improvement on all sides still exists.<br />
The Australian iron ore industry has had a<br />
particularly chequered record.<br />
Although there has been no occasion since Australia<br />
began shipping ore to Japan that production by the Japanese<br />
mills was interrupted due to disruption of Australian<br />
supplies, the situation at the Pilbara has for a long time<br />
been difficult and a source of legitimate concern.<br />
Some of you would be aware that back in 1976, as<br />
President of the ACTU, I addressed a meeting at the Pilbara<br />
on industrial relations issues in the iron ore industry. </p>
<p>Subsequently, in January 1977, 1 led a delegation<br />
to the Japanese steel mills to discuss the same issues.<br />
Now in Govcrnment I have given high priority to<br />
improvement of Australian industrial relations in general<br />
and Pilbara industrial relations in particular.<br />
The Western Australian Premier, Brian Burke, and<br />
his senior Ministers, share our views on the priority of<br />
these industrial questions.<br />
Some of you may have seen reports recently in the<br />
West Australian papers about the possible establishment of<br />
an Iron Ore Industry Consultative Council involving State<br />
and Federal Governments, unions and employers.<br />
This is currently the subject of active<br />
consultations among interested parties.<br />
Consistently with my Government's approach to<br />
matters of this kind, we would want any new institutions to<br />
have the positive support of all interested parties.<br />
If any new plan is to be successful, those affected<br />
need to conlcur with it and be involved in bringing it to<br />
completion. If it could be achieved I would see the<br />
establishment of a tripartite body along these lines as a<br />
most significant development.<br />
This joint initiative constitutes a particularly<br />
clear demonstration of Australia's comnmitment to maintaining<br />
and improving its performance as a reliable supplier.<br />
The Western Australian and Commonwealth<br />
Governments look forward to a fresh start: in industrial<br />
relations in the Pilbara.<br />
But the current situation requires more than just<br />
getting our own house in order.<br />
Australians must also be more active in the<br />
international market place.<br />
We need to expand the base of our exports to Japan<br />
and to do this we need to know better what the Japanese<br />
market wants. The Japanese economy continues to grow and<br />
represents a lucrative import market for those countries<br />
able to supply its needs at this advanced stage of its<br />
development. </p>
<p>Japan's high adincreasing living standards will<br />
generate opportunities for items such as high quality<br />
processed foodstuffs a~ nd high technology manufactures,<br />
leisure and sporting goods, high fashion items, travel and<br />
recreation, and the products of the services industry,<br />
particularly education services.<br />
If Australians Eire sufficiently concerned with<br />
innovation and q4uality, and do their homework thoroughly, we<br />
will not be denied a place in that market.<br />
I beliieve that wie even have some natural<br />
advantages in these new areas as well.<br />
Our small scale, highly differentiated<br />
manufacturing industry could be well suited to filling<br />
niches in this highly sophisticated market.<br />
We can succeed with a carefully conceived and<br />
committed approach aimed at understanding Japanese needs and<br />
developing our capacity to meet them.<br />
The assurances given to both Mr B~ owen arid Mr Hayden<br />
earlier this year by their Ministerial counter-parts in Tokyo<br />
that Japan swill co-operate constructively with Australia In<br />
the context of Japan's program of import expansion give me<br />
further confidence. I welcome these assurances as a measure of Japan's<br />
desire, shared by Australia, to see the relationship<br />
flourish. This squares well with Australia's aim to<br />
strengthen manufacturing productitity, upgrade our resource<br />
based processing, manufacturing and exporting, and take full<br />
advantage of the existing opportunities for stronger<br />
technolog ical co-operation.<br />
That said, the huge anid strategic raw materials<br />
trade remains of critical interest in the Australia/ Japan<br />
relationship. Neither our business communities nor our<br />
Governments can afford to neglect the problems involved in<br />
that trade. Where Australia is competitive, as we are in<br />
energy, raw materials, agricultural and other commodities,<br />
Australia can legitimately expect the maintenance of its<br />
established shares in the Japanese market, especially in<br />
these times when the market is tough.<br />
past This is not simply a matter of clinging to the </p>
<p>.2 .11.<br />
Instead it is a matter of recognising the<br />
importance of building across the business community, t". c<br />
governments, the geneoyal. community in Australia, Japan and<br />
other Western Pacific countries a climate for open trade<br />
pol icies. Our two countries share a strong interest in the<br />
maintenance of strong trade expansion and economic growth<br />
throughout our region.<br />
This implies an even more open, vigorous and active<br />
partnership between Australia and Japan.<br />
It requires business in Australia and Japan to<br />
recognise our strong mutual interest in efficient patterns<br />
of trade; in drawing supplies from the most competitive<br />
sources, independently of external political or commercial<br />
pressures. The reward of our success will be the m. iintenance<br />
of our region as a centre of economic dynamism without equal<br />
in today's world. </p>
