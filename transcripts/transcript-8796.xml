ADDRESS BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP TO THE<br />
1992 AUSTRALIAN OF THE YEAR AWARDS PRESENTATION LUNCHEON,<br />
26 JANUARY 1993 ADMIRALTY HOUSE<br />
Ladies and gentlemen<br />
On this, like any other Australia Day, there is a great deal to celebrate.<br />
We might start with the most obvious, but perhaps the most often ignored: I mean the<br />
continued good health of one of the world's oldest democracies.<br />
Or a standard of living which remains among the highest in the world.<br />
We might celebrate the enviable freedom and comforts of life in Australia. And the<br />
degree of security with which only a handful of other countries compare.<br />
We could begin by celebrating these things, and giving thanks to those generations of<br />
Australians whose monumental labour and faith and love for this land bequeathed them to<br />
US. On this Australia Day we might draw strength from their example and pledge ourselves to<br />
match their inspiration.<br />
And it is useful to look back for a moment. It will remind us that we are not the first<br />
generation to be confronted by a great challenge, or the first to feel that the going was<br />
tough, or the first to need a sustaining faith in their country and their fellow Australians.<br />
This post war generation might be guilty of bearing a myth about Australia. Perhaps<br />
because we inherited the post-war growth and stability I suspect it was we who allowed<br />
the idea to grow that Australia's history was an uninterrupted progression to better and<br />
better things. And perhaps we conveyed that idea to our children.<br />
Possibly we lost some of the essential truth when, in our scepticism, we ceased to instruct<br />
our kids in the pioneering legends.<br />
Perhaps that is something we should remedy.<br />
The idea that good fortune has nearly always smiled upon Australia tends to obscure the<br />
fact that what has been built here the people have built. 5637 </p>
<p>Australians of any age woul d always tell you that it was their great good luck to live here:<br />
but those who farmied in the Mallee, or dug coal out of the Uthgow pits, or worked in the<br />
nation's factories in the earlier years of industrial capitalism were, more often than not,<br />
creating a fortunate life for the next generation, not their own.<br />
Essentially this country was conceived in the imagination of its people, and delivered to<br />
us by their labour.<br />
One hundred years ago Australia lay deep in drought and Depression. Out of that decade<br />
emerged the Federation.<br />
Thirty years later there was another Depression, and out of that came people with the<br />
strength to fight a war.<br />
Between the two depressions there was another war which took the lives of 60,000 young<br />
Australians from a population of just four and a half million.<br />
These were the legendary Australians: the pioneers, those who struggled through the<br />
hardest of hard times, those who defended this country in 1942.<br />
They have been enshrined in literature, art and monuments and we should never forget<br />
them. In the past year two of the people who helped put those generations forever in the realm of<br />
Australian legend, Sydney Nolan and Paul Hasluck, died. The year before we lost<br />
Manning Clark..<br />
Suddenly it seems the old generation is passing. It leaves a gap which we feel can never<br />
quite be filled.<br />
Yet it is also an unmistakeable sign that responsibility has passed into our hands. Our<br />
lucky post-war generation now has to find the right direction. We have to make our own<br />
history. That is the challenge that is the message, I think, for this Australia Day 1993: to make<br />
sense of our history, make sense of who we are, make the most of our time.<br />
No generation of Australians has faced a greater challenge than the one we face<br />
certainly not in peace-time.<br />
And I would say, as well, that none has shown a greater willingness to squarely face<br />
reality and do what has to be done.<br />
These are difficult times. Not so hard on people as those in the past I have mentioned,<br />
partly because those events made us both wiser and more compassionate.<br />
Today we do not have a third of the workforce unemployed, but a tenth. And we have a<br />
social net in place which was not there sixty years ago.<br />
This is not the challenge of war or depression.<br />
It is the no less difficult challenge of maintaining the momentum of an economic<br />
revolution while restoring employment.<br />
5638 </p>
<p>3<br />
It is the challenge of finding our place in that region which until now has been most<br />
foreign to us Asia. And by finding our place there, securing the freedom comforts and<br />
security our generation has enjoyed.<br />
It is about managing a post industrial revolution and navigating a passage to the places<br />
where our future lies.<br />
These are not options, but imperatives.<br />
And responding to them will require the same qualities of courage and perseverance, and<br />
imagination and faith as those other moments in our history have demanded.<br />
The tragedy of the recession has been the good work undone.<br />
We created one and three quarter million and a half jobs in the eighties and we have lost<br />
three hundred thousand of them.<br />
We have to get them back.<br />
With our tradingpartners either in recession or growing more slowly than we are, it will<br />
not be easy.<br />
It is now apparent that the wild lending of the late eighties and the subsequent collapse in<br />
asset prices has left the banking system poorly placed to fund the production and<br />
investment necessary to get the economy moving.<br />
To compound the problem, Australian companies like those in other countries are now<br />
seeking &amp; reterpToductivity through substitutingnew efficiencies for jobs.<br />
In these circumstances there might be a temptation to think that the unemployed are the<br />
casualties of progres as the environment was in the conquest of the land, as people were<br />
in the industrial age, as cities have been in the rush to development.<br />
But the sacrifice of people to the winds of change, or to ideological fashion is precisely<br />
what Australians resisted in the 1980s, when other countries now manifestly to their<br />
great cost allowed it to happen.<br />
In my reading of the history of Australia this century it is precisely what Australians have<br />
always resisted.<br />
It seems to me it has always been the judgment of most Australians that a true democracy<br />
has a social dimension. That governments have social responsibilities.<br />
So the fight against unemployment will go on. The challenge to get those jobs back is an<br />
imperative. The recession struck a blow at our confidence: all of us have felt it.<br />
It did not strike us all equally, but it seems to me that it is our equal responsibility to strike<br />
back: to re-group and re-build.<br />
And the best way of doing that is to seize the opportunity which the past decade of change<br />
has already delivered to us. ' 15639 </p>
<p>We have to continue the transormation of Australia from a country dependent entirely on<br />
the export of commodities, to a country which also manufactures goods and services<br />
which the world wants to buy.<br />
And we have to continue to go where the greatest growth by far is, where the window of<br />
opportunity is open, where we cannot afford not to go to Asia.<br />
T'his is a fight we cannot afford to lose.<br />
And I can say after ten years of fighting it, and watching Australians fight it, I cannot<br />
believe that we will lose it.<br />
As I'e said more than once this year, I know we can make the change because of the<br />
change we have already made.<br />
Yesterday I spoke at another Australia Day gathering one associated with Sydney's<br />
Olympic bid.<br />
It was appropriate to point out there that Australia had done marvellously well on the<br />
international sporting scene in the past twelve months.<br />
Nowhere did we do better than at the Barcelona Olympics, of course.<br />
And we can perhaps learn from our athletes that the world should hold no fear for us. If<br />
we wed talent with resourcefulness and dedication we can compete with the world and<br />
win. In the same speech also pointed out that we had competed just as successfully on other<br />
fronts where those qualities matter.<br />
In the arts, for instance. Young Australian ballet dancers won gold medals at the Genee<br />
Awards in London. They won all the medals gold, silver and bronze. They won all of<br />
them in the previous year as well.<br />
A young Australian achieved the rare distinction of being appointed to the Vienna<br />
Philharmonic Orchestra.<br />
An Australian film, Strictly Ballroom, picked up a swag of prizes around the world and<br />
topped the box office both here and in Great Britain.<br />
An Australian actress, Judy Davis, won three of the most prestigious American acting<br />
awards and is widely predicted to win at least another two, including an Oscar.<br />
The list of these artistic achievements is as long as those in sport and the lesson is the<br />
same. We can win in the world.<br />
What is true of these successes is true of business. And it has proven to be.<br />
For among the prizes won this year we might also list BliPs successful tender to develop<br />
the oil and gas reserves of Vietnam.<br />
We might include all those companies which made things in Australia and sold them<br />
overseas.<br />
5640. </p>
<p>That would be a longer list than anyone here would have the patience for. But the figures<br />
constitute one very important reason why I believe that Australia will succeed.<br />
Our total exports have increased in the past five years by more than 40 per cent.<br />
Our exports of elaborately transformed goods have increased by more than 100 per cent.<br />
We have increased our exports to Asia by 70 per cent.<br />
These reflect the dramatic recasting of Australia's economy.<br />
They reflect something else just as fundamental. They reflect a sea change in the way we<br />
do things, the way we think about our future, the way we think about the rest of the world.<br />
The change has occurred in boardrooms and on the shop floor. It can be seen in the<br />
growth among Australian companies of a commitment to international best practice. It<br />
can also be seen in the enterprise agreements which trade unions and managemern across<br />
Australia are signing every day.<br />
There is a new cooperative culture in Australia. There is a new recognition that our<br />
success depends on a common effort. We have learned what the successful economies of<br />
the world learned long ago, and we have learned it very quickly that cooperation is<br />
more productive and more competitive.<br />
There is another lesson that should be learned from those successful countries:<br />
There is a role for government.<br />
Care for people remains paramount even in times of transition especially in<br />
times of transition.<br />
The change we want comes most easily when it comes with the least damage to<br />
the social fabric.<br />
Yet while we can learn from these examples, they will not provide us with our solutions.<br />
The way forward for Australia is not the Japanese way, or the way of Singapore, any more<br />
than it is the British way, or the German, or the American.<br />
What we do will be appropriate to our circumstances, our needs, our culture, our<br />
character. It will call on our strengths and they are many: we are strong in education; in<br />
democracy; in cultural diversity and social harmony.<br />
We remain immensely strong in natural resources, including an environment which is<br />
both unique and, by world standards, relatively undamaged.<br />
The great spaces of Australia are a strength. So is the efficiency of our primary producers,<br />
and the clean air, water and soil in which they grow their products.<br />
We're strong in so far as we include in the dynamic of our country a very large proportion<br />
of our people. We include a considerably greater proportion of our people in the<br />
workforce than does, for instance, the United States. 5641 </p>
<p>We have taken in the past decade more women into the workforce, and we lead the world<br />
in implementing the United Nations Convention on the elimination of all forms of<br />
discrimination against women.<br />
We are strong because we are a liberal democracy. We are strong because we are<br />
progressive. And, as we make this great transition, the more we invest in the lives of our people the<br />
stronger we will be.<br />
For if there is one thing I have learned in the past few years it is that the people of<br />
Australia are our greatest resource.<br />
It is they who have adapted to the change, it is they who have risen to the challenge of the<br />
future, it is they who have both borne the burden and not infrequently pointed the way.<br />
I said yesterday that these difficult times are not yet over. We cannot realistically expect<br />
to achieve all our goals before the end of the decade. We will have to continue to adjust:<br />
by I mean all of us governments, business, trade unions, communities.<br />
But change breeds change; and ingenuity fosters ingenuity and faith is infectious.<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen<br />
In this past year it has been my privilege to speak at a number of events commemorating<br />
the deeds of Australians during the second World War: legendary deeds at Kokoda, Milne<br />
Bay and the Coral Sea.<br />
It was also the 50th anniversary of El Alamnein, Singapore and Darwin.<br />
In this same year I was privileged to be present on the long overdue occasion of our<br />
recognising the courage and sacrifice of those who served in Vietnam.<br />
I spoke at events organised by the various and collective ethnic communities of Australia,<br />
and there it was possible to get a picture of the extraordinary progress that we have made<br />
towards an open, tolerant, pluralist society. A far richer society than the one in which I<br />
grew UP.<br />
I spoke at events organised by groups representing women in Australia, and could not help<br />
but reflect on the advances we have made towards genuine equity and, therefore, more<br />
genuine democracy.<br />
Last year I had the opportunity to speak at several events about our great need to achieve<br />
in this decade social justice for Australian Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders.<br />
We are committed to a process of reconciliation. We are determined to end two centuries<br />
of discrimination and injustice. The response since spelling out these ambitions in<br />
Redfern Park two months ago convinces me that the great majority of Australians are<br />
committed to them too.<br />
Last year I visited Indonesia, Singapore and Japan. It was plain not only that an historic<br />
opportunity exists for us in the region but that the region expects us to seize it. We are<br />
expected to succeed.<br />
5642 </p>
<p>Last year it was my duty to find the words to sy when men and women of the Australian<br />
armed forces were sent to pursue the interests of democracy and peace in Cambodia, and a<br />
few months later it was my gxeat privilege to visit them in Phnom Penhi.<br />
Last month I went to Townsville to farewell our troops as they left for Somalia on a<br />
similar mission.<br />
What became apparent in the course of last year is that this generation of Australians is<br />
carving out a place in the world. It is growing its own legends.<br />
This generation of Australians is making its own history.<br />
We Australians need look no further than what we have done and what we are now doing<br />
to find our inspiration. We need look no further than ourselves.<br />
There is no better message for Australia Day 1993.<br />
Thank You. 5643 </p>
