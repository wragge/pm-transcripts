\ AUST&gt; AIA,<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 28 March 1984<br />
The Prime Minister of Burma, U Mauting Maung Kha, will visit<br />
Australia on 2-7 April 1984. He will be accompanied by his<br />
Minister for Foreign Affairs, U Chit Hlaing and his Minister<br />
for Mines, U Than Tin.<br />
This will be the first high-level Burmese Government visit to<br />
Australia since the visit of President U Ne Win in 1974. It<br />
follows Mr Hayden's visit to Burma in November last year.<br />
I look forward to meeting Prime Minister U Maung Maung Kha in<br />
Canberra, and discussing regional and bilateral issues. The<br />
meetings and discussions will contribute to strengthening the<br />
friendly links between our two countries.<br />
Prime Minister U Maung Maung Kha's itinerary will include<br />
visits to Victoria, Queensland and New South Wales where he<br />
will inspect projects involving the development of Australian<br />
natural resources.<br />
Ministers and senior officials travelling with the Prime Minister<br />
will be having discussions with their Australian counterparts during<br />
the visit. </p>
