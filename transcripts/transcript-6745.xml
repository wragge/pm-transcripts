TRANSCRIPT OF TERRY WILLESEE TONIGHT 27 SEPTEMBER 1985<br />
WILLESEE: Do you know as yet whether any of the monies paid<br />
to Dr Armstrong can be recovered?<br />
PM: Well, I have sent now all the papers to the Solicitor-<br />
General, I can't answer that question until I get an answer<br />
from the Solicitor-General.<br />
WILLESEE: Would you like to recover those monies?<br />
PMl: I ' would like the appropriate processes of the law<br />
and morality to apply and I can't respond in respect to the<br />
legal position until I am advised by the Solicitor-General.<br />
WILLESEE: Ho0w did Mr Reid explain to you that a 6 year<br />
payout to Dr Armstrong when an agreement existed to<br />
pay only four months notice on termination?<br />
PM: WEll, Mr Reid's position is that he believed, according<br />
to his understanding of the law as it was put to him, despite<br />
the fact that the letter said only four months notice was<br />
required, that there could be some threat of wrongful dismissal<br />
if there weren't the full payout. Now, the letter which<br />
constituted the contract of employment, which was shown<br />
to me for the first time las~ t/, inm ugmetado<br />
all those who advise/ 111crystal clear in this regard.<br />
WILLESEE: Has Mr Reid made a genuine mistake?<br />
PM: As in the case of my request that Dr Armstrong be removed,<br />
so in the case of Mr Reid. I am not in the business of trying<br />
to attack the individuals concerned, go to why what happened<br />
did happen. All I must be concerned with is %.. hat happened and<br />
what happened was not acceptable and in those circumstances I<br />
had no alternative but to ask for the resignation.<br />
WILLESEE: Mr Hawke, there is a lot we don't know, the general<br />
public, about what has been going on. Have there been<br />
any personality problems behind all this?<br />
PM: Well, I don't know, Terry, I don't know. And I certainly<br />
haven't, in any of the decisions that 1 have taken in t1n:'. s<br />
matter, allowed any suggestion of personal consideration to<br />
enter into it. They haven't entered into my consideration<br />
or my decision. </p>
<p>WILLESEE: I i5-possible the $ 240,000 part of Dr Armstrong's<br />
payout may in fact be non-taxable?<br />
PM: WEll, it has been so constructed to achieve that result.<br />
And that is why, in part, I have referred this matter to the<br />
Solicitor-General to see whether, in fact, it is within the<br />
law to have done that. What is certain is that there has<br />
been a tax minimisation contrivance. And in my conversation<br />
with Mr Reid on the phone on the 10th of September and then<br />
by letter on the 17th of September, I made it crystal clear<br />
by reference to tax minimisation that that was not on as far<br />
as the Government was concerned.<br />
WILLESEE: Mr Hawke, you reacted when you heard taxation<br />
being discussed in relation to these payouts. Why didn't<br />
you react when you first saw those rather exorbitant looking<br />
figures that were going to Dr Armstrong? Why no reaction then?<br />
PM: There are two separate issues. And I want to go to them.<br />
As to the amount. The question of the amount arose because<br />
in the conversation I had on the phone with Mr REid on the<br />
19th of August, he told me on the phone that there would<br />
be a large amount of this order because what was necessary<br />
under the contract was to buy the contract out. He said he<br />
has got 6 years to run and that the level of salary he enjoyed<br />
plus the associated long service leave entitlements, annual<br />
leave entitlements, that you are up in that ball-park figure.<br />
So the amount followed from what he had said to me in regard<br />
to the requirements under the contract.<br />
WILLESEE: So you believe you had no alternative but to<br />
accept those figures?<br />
PM: Yes, of course. When the Chairman said to me on the<br />
phone that this was what was required and as under the law<br />
which he properly insisted he had the responsibility of<br />
negotiating this matter, then I understood he was going<br />
away and negotiating in those terms. So the amount came<br />
as no surprise. I notice that the composition was different.<br />
But the question of tax which I now go to as the second issue,<br />
didn't occur in my thinking there when I saw that amou. nt. I<br />
saw it was a different composition, but I just had nc thought<br />
in my mind that the Bicentennial Authority, in finalising this<br />
matter, would involve itself in tax minimisation or possibly<br />
avoidance. I mean it just didn't occur to me. Then ' hen I<br />
spoke on the 10th of September to Mr Reid, when I first said<br />
to him, look I am puzzled about the difference in the composition.<br />
I mean it is not 6 years payment out of an amount of salary,<br />
but you have got certain salary and long service leave<br />
entitlements. And then this great big hunk in there, he said<br />
well this goes to the question of tax advantage for Dr ArmstrongÃ¸<br />
As soon as that was said, the question mark immediately arose<br />
and I said to him, this is on the 10th, well look, if there<br />
is any question of tax minimisation or avoidance, that is nnt<br />
on and I want you to lot me know in writi. ng just -, ha<br />
involved. And I followce that up with a ij tter<br />
when I came back from New Guinea on the weekend, on t:. e iA<br />
I wrote and spelt that out. So there is the relatior. i; hip<br />
between the amount, Terry, and the tax issue. </p>
<p>WILLESEE: And that takes us up to last night?<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
WILLESEE: Well, the Bicentennial Board has problems at the<br />
top. And when an organisation has problems at the top it<br />
usually filters through. Do you plan any other action with<br />
the Board?<br />
PM: I am very glad you asked that question, Terry, because<br />
it focusses attention where it should be, at the future of<br />
the Authority. And there are just two or three things I<br />
would like to say about that. Firstly, in fairness to<br />
Mr Reid and Dr Armstrong, the impression shouldn't be left<br />
that nothing has been done. A great deal has been done and<br />
I am certain that with the things that are now to be done,<br />
which I will go to in a moment, that Australians can look<br />
forward to a 1988 in which there will a great year, not just<br />
of celebration but of the undertaking of projects which will<br />
have lasting value. Now let me come to the point as to what<br />
we are doing to strengthen, if you like, the operation of the<br />
Authority. I preface it by saying Terry, that I have to operate<br />
under a piece of legislation which separates and distances<br />
the Government and. ' the Parliament from the operation of the<br />
Authority. But what we are doing, I am grateful to Mr John<br />
Utz, who is a member of the Board and the Chairman of the<br />
New South Wales Bicentennial Authority. He has accepted<br />
the interim chairmanship of the Authority. We will together,<br />
I believe, in the near future, appoint a new Chief Executive,<br />
and then as soon as possible get a new Chairman after the<br />
interim chairmanship of Mr John Utz. Secondly, I will be<br />
discussing with M~ r Utz, ways in which we can strengthen the<br />
accountability and reporting process of the Authority to<br />
the Government so that there is a closer relationship between<br />
us, than in a sense is strictly, legally operable under the<br />
legislation of our predecessors.<br />
WILLESEE: Mr Hawke, thanks for those two points. Arnd we have<br />
to wrap it up. Before we go, two things more important.<br />
Two grand finals this weekend, what are your tips?<br />
PM: In Melbourne, all the evidence suggests that Essendon<br />
should win, I will be barracking for the Hawks, but if you<br />
were betting you would have-to bet on Essendon. And in<br />
Sydney, St George. I am going to their breakfast on Sunday<br />
morning, and I must barrack for them although I have a great<br />
respect for the capacities and the club of Canterbury.<br />
WILLESEE: Sounds like an each way bet?<br />
PM: No, I am saying St George.<br />
WILLESEE: Thanks Mr Hawke. Have a good weekend.<br />
PM: Thank you.<br />
ENDS. </p>
