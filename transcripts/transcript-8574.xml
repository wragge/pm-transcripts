TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE MON P J REATING, PIP<br />
PRESS CONFERENCE, CANBERRA<br />
JULY 1992<br />
EGOE PROOF ONLY<br />
PM: A few of you have asked me for comments, as you know<br />
I have just returned, you have asked me for comments<br />
on the unemployment numbers yesterday and I thought<br />
I would give you a few introductory remarks and then<br />
take questions.<br />
The first thing I will say is that the Government is<br />
very disturbed by yesterday's numbers. While we<br />
could see some employment growth there the number of<br />
people joining the workforce meant that the outcome<br />
was entirely unacceptable to us and I think we<br />
understand entirely clearly what that means in human<br />
terms. The pressure that this condition puts on<br />
individuals and on families is profound and<br />
therefore the Government's priority will be as it's<br />
been, certainly since I became Prime Minister, and<br />
that is restarting the economy, getting growth<br />
coming through and getting employment growing more<br />
strongly. The one thing we won't do in any of this is panic,<br />
because there is no point In doing so, the<br />
structures the Government have in place, I think,<br />
mean that we will be having more of the One Nation<br />
money coming through, which was announced in<br />
February and remember we announced about $ 500<br />
million of it to be spent in the last financial<br />
year, the bulk of it to be spent in this financial<br />
year, and I have got every expectation we will spend<br />
every cent of it. And as well as that we have got<br />
the natural stabilisers in the Budget working, with<br />
a shift in the Budget balance from Y surplus of $ 8<br />
billion to a deficit somewhat above $ 10 billion, a<br />
substantial shift of $ 18 billion plus, whatever it<br />
might be, which is of course cushioning the impact </p>
<p>of the recess ion. We have got the cocks fully open<br />
on interest raiteis. So on the monetary front, on<br />
fi; C-al 0Policy, on the One Nation spending coming<br />
through, the next thing will be, as the Treasurer<br />
said yesterday, that the Government is determined to<br />
make the Budget an employment Budget, and we will be<br />
spending money there but directly on the unemployed<br />
rather than indirectly, for a fiscal boost to the<br />
economy directly on the unempyq0. And that will<br />
also include naturally whatever spending<br />
consequences may emerge from the meeting on youth<br />
unemployment and the measures and policies which<br />
emerge from that gathering as well. Some of you<br />
will recall, of course, that when I announced the<br />
One Nation package I had said in the context of the<br />
period I had spent in the backbench that the economy<br />
was very weak and that I thought that it needed<br />
stimulating, and I think that what yesterday and the<br />
recent period reveals is that it was weaker then we<br />
thought. But there was some general criticism of<br />
One Nation on the basis that we provided a fiscal<br />
stimulus for an economy which was already growing.<br />
And that, therefore, I had inherited an economy<br />
already on the up-swing and I had found myself<br />
caught with the rhetoric of slower growth, and that<br />
it was convenient therefore to pursue the One Nation<br />
spending. It is now obvious that the One Nation<br />
spending was entirely necessary and some of the<br />
comment around at the time about how it was going to<br />
blow fiscal policy, how the Government had given up<br />
on responsible economic management, 811 of that can<br />
now be seen for what it is, a misjudgement. Now the<br />
fact is one Nation was necessary and will be coming<br />
through for the economy at the right time. But I<br />
think what all of this means is that the economy has<br />
to start growing again, and we do believe it is<br />
growing to grow in the 4 per cent area over the<br />
course of the year. Now that being the case,<br />
obviously employment is going to lag, and employment<br />
has been lagging, and now additional people have<br />
joined the workforce, the participation rate has<br />
risen and therefore the unenpomntr rate has gone<br />
up. So the growth comes t hrough slower, the<br />
atructure is in place to bring it through, that is,<br />
the general shift in the Budget balance, the<br />
interest rate structure and the additional spending<br />
of one Nation, and for those caught in unemployment,<br />
now 8 substantial group of people, we will address<br />
them directly in the Budget with Labour market<br />
programs and with the programs which emerged from<br />
the Youthj MetngSummi~ t and also with some industry<br />
assist'ance measurer, and possibly some measures also<br />
designed with a regional focus, where regional<br />
unemployment is having an influence. So I think I<br />
will leave my introductory remarks and invite<br />
questions. </p>
<p>J: Prime Minister today John Haf y of the Trades<br />
Hall Council in Victoria _ suggested one way to<br />
overcome any fiscal difficulty would be to abandon<br />
the promised tax cuts. George Campbell of the metal<br />
Workers Union says that the Government should<br />
seriously be looking at raising tIaxes in some areas.<br />
Have you any sympathy with these causes?<br />
PM: The tax cuts are not the issue for this year or this<br />
year's Budget. I mean this year's Budget will be<br />
about focussing first of all the spending of the One<br />
Nation money, and then focussing any additional<br />
support on those directly affected by unemployment.<br />
So again I repeat, the change in the Budget balance<br />
which is the better part of $ 20 billion, plus the.<br />
low interest rates, plus the One Nation spending is<br />
going to hit the economy at the right time in terms<br />
of that response. Now if the economy grows as we<br />
expect it will, I have got no reason to doubt it<br />
won't, then we are living with the lag of<br />
employment, unfortunately.<br />
J: When are you expecting unemployment to start<br />
moderating, Prime Minister?<br />
Pm; I can't give you a quarter by quarter view on that,<br />
but there is obviously going to be substantial<br />
employment associated with growth of any order in<br />
the sort of 4 per cent area. Now, where the<br />
unemployment rate will then rest will depend upon<br />
the participation rate, that is the number of people<br />
out there looking for work.<br />
J: Have we bottomed out yet?<br />
Pm: in terms of employment?<br />
J: Unemployment, yes.<br />
PM: It depends on where participation goes. As the<br />
Treasurer said yesterday, this is a statistically<br />
uncertain measure, and the trend rate is the one to<br />
look at. The trend rate is at 10.8 per cent. Now<br />
the Government did forecast in the Budget 10.75 per<br />
cent as the peak, the trend rate yesterday on the<br />
numbers was 10.8 per cent. So it's very hard to<br />
say. But what we saw with employment was employment<br />
actually grew in the month by 26,000.<br />
J: Mr Dawkins avoided saying the worst had passed<br />
yesterday. Are you now prepared to say the worst<br />
has passed?<br />
PM: It's not a matter of being prepared to say that at<br />
all. I'm not going to make a forecast about next<br />
month's participation rate. </p>
<p>J: Mr Keating, would you say you'll spend directly on<br />
the unemployed in the Budget, can you be more<br />
specific about that. Is it dangerous not to spend<br />
on productive things?<br />
PM: When we did the One Nation package we found it<br />
impossible to get more programs into place and spend<br />
more money in the public sector. At the time there<br />
were no more State programs that we could use or<br />
Commonwealth programs. That is, no programs that at<br />
the time the States said they could reasonably get<br />
up in the required time frame. As well as that, we<br />
thought that the balance in the One Nation spending<br />
at about $ 2.3 billion was correct. So for the<br />
programs that we had in place we thought that was<br />
well and good. But what we were envisaging now,<br />
rather than simply rely upon the employment effect,<br />
either direct or indirect of that spending, what<br />
we'll be seeking to do in the Budget is to support<br />
those people who are actually affected. Support<br />
them personally and directly. And I think that's<br />
the qualitative difference in seeking any remedy for<br />
the unemployed in that way, as distinct from adding<br />
a bigger fiscal stimulus to the economy in general<br />
or the public sector in particular.<br />
J: When you say it's support personally do you mean<br />
higher benefits, or do you mean short term make-work<br />
schemes, or training?<br />
PM: Labour market programs the design of which will be<br />
revealed in due course.<br />
J: With these disastrous unemployment rates are you<br />
prepared to accept that your policies to date have<br />
failed?<br />
PM: Which policies do you mean?<br />
J: Economic policies.<br />
PM:. Do you mean the ones that have taken Australia from<br />
an industrial museum to give it a future, or do you<br />
mean the cyclical ones?<br />
3: In fairness, Mr Keating, you've been Treasurer,<br />
you're now Prime minister, you're facing<br />
catastrophic unemployment figures. I'm asking you,<br />
do you now accept that your policies have failed?<br />
PM: No. What we are seeing here is a largely cyclical<br />
response in the economy to the cycle of change. But<br />
to make a judgement about the Government's policies<br />
over the last nine years, the measure of failure<br />
would be to have the same size labour market as<br />
then. And the labour market is 1.5 million larger<br />
than it was, or 22 or 23 per cent larger than it was<br />
in 1983. Now what one desirably would like is to </p>
<p>come off the boom of the late ' 808, having been<br />
through a period of adjustment on the current<br />
account and inflation, without profound employment<br />
effects. We've not been able to do that. But<br />
again, what I say is that the structure of the<br />
policy that we have in place is the best one for<br />
pulling the economy out.<br />
J: How much worse does it have to get before you're<br />
prepared to accept that it's not just a cyclical<br />
problem, that you've got a structural problem in<br />
your policy, that you have failed?<br />
PM: I'm not sure you understand what the word structural<br />
means. Structural means that if you're trying to<br />
compete with countries nearby with labour rates of<br />
$ 7 a week, if you think that you don't need to<br />
adjust yourself to those kind of structural changes,<br />
I think you're mistaken. The fact of the matter is<br />
that Australia has been through a very profound<br />
structural change, but the largest part of the<br />
unemployment we are experiencing now is cyclical.<br />
And the quicker the economy starts growing again,<br />
the better, and everything we've done on the macro<br />
side and on Interest rates and on fiscal policy, I<br />
believe, will pull it out more quickly than any<br />
other prescription around.<br />
J: Mr Keating, you're the Prime Minister now because<br />
you believe you could fix this, and you've simply<br />
failed to date. You've made it worse, not better.<br />
PM: I said i would commit myself to getting the economy<br />
restarted and providing jobs growth. We are saying<br />
in forecasts that the economy will grow through the<br />
year, and employment is already growing. It's not<br />
growing as much as we would like, but it's already<br />
growing.<br />
J; Do you believe in the next six months we'll see the<br />
unemployment rate up about where it is or getting<br />
worse? In other words, the forecast you've just<br />
made now may be a long time coming, in fact it may<br />
not even come before the next election Is due.<br />
PM: There are two factors. If the growth comes through,<br />
there will be an employment response. The magnitude<br />
of the employment response will depend on two<br />
things. Firstly, productivity how much<br />
3roductivity there is there? That is, how much of<br />
the growth will translate into productivity vis a<br />
via jobs. And secondly, where will the<br />
participation rate go? And it may be that in the<br />
economy picking up, people will be encouraged to<br />
rejoin the workforce so their participation rate may<br />
rise. on the other hand, it may not. So I think<br />
you'll have to wait till the Budget till we give </p>
<p>you, again, forecasts about employment and<br />
unemployment.<br />
J: Mr Keating, you said that the deficit will be<br />
something over at $ 10 billion. lIfbow-iiuch more over<br />
billion?<br />
PM: Well we're not certain. As Mr Dawkins said to you<br />
yesterday, there's been a fall away in the revenues<br />
in part built upon the success we've had with<br />
inflation. Lower inflation means ipso facto lower<br />
revenues, and lower revenues mean that the Budget<br />
balance shifts further into deficit in the short<br />
term. The important thing is the structure that<br />
sits underneath the Budget is a sound one, and I<br />
contend the ' 80s provided for Australia a lot of<br />
youthful work on fiscal policy which does leave us<br />
in the position where now you can contemplate the<br />
spending we have in One Nation, and what we may do<br />
in the Budget and the impact of the natural<br />
stabilisers, the natural decline in the Budget<br />
balance, at the same time seeing it by the middle<br />
come back into surplus.<br />
J: On the labour market programs that you mentioned<br />
earlier for the older unemployed, exactly what do<br />
you have in mind make work schemes, red schemes<br />
revisited?<br />
PM: I think, Russell ( Barton), you'll have to wait till<br />
we settle the design of those programs, of which<br />
work is proceeding. But again, the Budget is not<br />
that far away.<br />
J: I'm just talking about the concept. Will it be<br />
direct Government spending to higher unemployed<br />
people, is that the Idea?<br />
PM: It will be Government spending on labour-market<br />
programs, We are contemplating at least two issues<br />
here. That is, the youth unemployment issue which<br />
I'll be directly addressing at that meeting on youth<br />
unemployment, and the labour market more generally<br />
in the Budget.<br />
3: Mr Keating, despite the decree as to whether the<br />
unemployment is cyclically caused or not, do you<br />
accept that there comes a time when rising<br />
unemployment becomes politically fatal to any<br />
Government and aren't we at that point?<br />
PM: The political fatality would rest in whether people<br />
think an addition of 15 per centage points of the<br />
consumption tax which would be an anti-employment<br />
thing would be better. Whether they think tighter<br />
monetary policies, higher interest rates, a cut in<br />
fiscal policy, a 15 per cent consumption tax, a<br />
massive addition to inflation and to interest rates </p>
<p>would be better. Now I contend it wouldn't better<br />
and all that we would do is simply endanger the<br />
recovery for a prolonged period of time. So<br />
Australia had to come off the spending levels of the<br />
late 1980s, the questions which are being put to me<br />
today as directly as they are were being put to be<br />
about the current account deficit two or three years<br />
ago, and it was then all about imports and the<br />
Government took remedial action to bring our demand<br />
within our product growth. But in a recovery phase<br />
the structure which is there, which the Government<br />
has put into place, is the appropriate structure.<br />
To go now to a massive impost upon spending through<br />
8 consumption tax, a massive addition to inflation,<br />
a massive addition to interest rates, a $ 10 billion<br />
cut to fiscal policy is going to do what? It is<br />
going to murder employment. The Coalition's<br />
policies would murder employment.<br />
J: With the increase in the deficit, does this mean<br />
that the ' One Nation' tax cuts are still<br />
deliverable?<br />
PM: Yes, I think so. Fiscal_ poli~ gy in Australia in the<br />
1980s became exceptionally strong and is standing us<br />
in good stead now.<br />
3: So the undertaking that the budget balance would be<br />
restored in five years, is that still in tact?<br />
PM: Yes, I think so.<br />
J: Prime Minister, earlier you said that the Government<br />
understands enti~ rely clearly what it means in human<br />
terms, do you think it would be appropriate to offer<br />
an act or at least an indication of contrition to<br />
those nearly one million Australians who are<br />
unemployed?<br />
PM: What have you got in mind?<br />
3: Well it's up to you, you are the Prime minister.<br />
PM: We all get these sort of questions and I have said<br />
over and over again that the Government understands<br />
the damage caused by unemployment, it's disturbed by<br />
it, feels it very poignantly, has done all the<br />
macro-economic, broad economic things it can<br />
possibly do to set the system up for growth again,<br />
and in the meantime try and look after those who are<br />
directly disadvantaged. That doesn't mean cutting<br />
their unemployment benefits after nine months, it<br />
doesn't mean producing an underclass of people who<br />
are off unemployment benefits after nine months, or<br />
employed people who are working at employment rates<br />
near the dole. This has never happened in<br />
Australia. </p>
<p>J: Does it mean saying sorry?<br />
PM; Look Dennis ( Grant) don't try silly drama with me.<br />
I've made my position on this clear for years.<br />
J: Do you accept responsibility for the 953,000 people<br />
out of work?<br />
PM: I take responsibility on behalf of the Government<br />
yes. But remember this about the private sector of<br />
Australia, I don't take responsibility for the<br />
massive crude spending of the late 19809 and I take<br />
responsibility also for getting our imports under<br />
control and getting our inflation rate back into the<br />
best order in the world and these were all joint<br />
responsibilities on a responsible Government.<br />
J: Mr Keating, do you accept that whatever may happen<br />
to the exact employment figures, we face the<br />
probably permanent situation of a large body of<br />
probably permanently unemployment people who will<br />
end up being a sort of underolassed, making the<br />
traditional notions of fairness and equity really<br />
disappear?<br />
PM: I think the answer to that is in the negative. I<br />
don't think we need a large or will see a large body<br />
of permanently unemployed people, I don't think we<br />
should accept it, I don't think that structural<br />
unemployment means that at all because I think a lot<br />
of it is cyclical and the Australian way has always<br />
been to pull everybody along, give them a job, to<br />
give them a place in society, to look after them<br />
when they are down, when they're unemployed or their<br />
sick and that's what this society must do. it<br />
shouldn't chop them off after nine months, it<br />
shouldn't turn our young people into an economic<br />
subclass. It should pull Australians along, give<br />
them their proceeds of the growth, give them their<br />
share of the growth. The traditional way Australia<br />
has divied out the share of the growth is through<br />
employment, and that's why in the 1980s the<br />
Government committed itself absolutely to employment<br />
as indeed it's doing now, but it's waiting for the<br />
response in the economy.<br />
J: But after each of the cycles over the last twenty<br />
years we have been left with a larger body of<br />
permanent long-term unemployed.<br />
PM: That's right, but it's not at 10 per cent levels.<br />
it's at something much below that, probably less<br />
than half that. At the peak of the cycle in the<br />
1980s we had unemployment under four per cent in<br />
some capitals.<br />
3: Yes, but it's still a lot higher than it was twenty<br />
years before that. </p>
<p>PM: True, but again twenty years before that We didn't<br />
have the countries of the Asia-Pacific making<br />
manufactures and other things In competition with<br />
us. Australia, like many industrial societies is<br />
going through a change and a technological change.<br />
We didn't have jobs being displaced by computers and<br />
it simply means that one has to commit oneself to<br />
more growth. If technological Change means there's<br />
more Output with smaller employment, the answer is<br />
to have more output. That's what we tried to do<br />
through the 1980s, that's what we're trying to do<br />
now.<br />
J: Would you comment please on the much higher growth<br />
-in yA-m work than in full-time work and what do<br />
you see as the implications of that both in economic<br />
terms and short term and longer term?<br />
PM: It's been a feature of the whole of the 1980s a<br />
shift to part-time work, and although the work force<br />
grew in aggregate there was a shift in the<br />
competition between part-time and full-time<br />
employment. Partly this is in consequence for the<br />
higher participation rate by women in the workforce,<br />
It may also be a consequence of the change to a more<br />
service-oriented economy, or also a consequence to<br />
the change to an economy which is now living with<br />
higher technology and technological capacity. So I<br />
don't think one can be profound about the change.<br />
J; Can you see it skewing the statistics as we've been<br />
used to knowing them?<br />
PM; Maybe, but I think if the economy does growth<br />
sufficiently strongly, if we've got low inflation in<br />
place and Australia's well resourced with a<br />
technological able workforce, it can grow strongly<br />
particularly in the 1990s and it will pull up a lot<br />
of employment both full and part time.<br />
J: Mr Keating, Mr Dawkins said yesterday that<br />
Australians who do have jobs are quite well of f now<br />
because of the drop in interest rates. Do you think<br />
that in the light of that and in the light of<br />
yesterday's figures that we should delay the<br />
national wage case that's coming up?<br />
PM: He made the point for those in employment and<br />
particularly those who have mortgages, their<br />
positions improved quite sharply as mortgage rates<br />
have come down to quite low levels. This may not<br />
have come by way of disposable income because some<br />
people have chosen to repay their mortgage faster,<br />
I'm not sure banks have actually offered, I think<br />
only the Commonwealth Bank has offered to reduce<br />
repayments, I'm not sure the other three have.<br />
Perhaps they should if people want that weekly </p>
<p>relief rather than paying a mortgage off more<br />
quickly. Where we go on wages will be a matter for<br />
judgement, but obviously the labour market will<br />
condition our thinking about it and that's something<br />
to think about. But again, generally economies with<br />
no wages growth are economies with no demand growth.<br />
