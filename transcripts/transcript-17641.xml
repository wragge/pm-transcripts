Today I announce that my Chief of Staff, Amanda Lampe, has resigned and will be replaced by Ben Hubbard.</p>
<p>Amanda's personal circumstances have changed and she has decided to move on. She will leave at the end of March, allowing for a 2-month transition period.</p>
<p>I wish to thank Amanda for her significant leadership during her time as my Chief of Staff in the Prime Minister's Office and the Deputy Prime Minister's Office.</p>
<p>Amanda's extensive experience and skills have been invaluable and I wish her and her family the best for the future.</p>
<p>Mr Hubbard has accepted my offer to become my Chief of Staff and will begin on Monday, 7 February.</p>
<p>He brings significant public administration, stakeholder and management experience to the role.</p>
<p>He is the outgoing Chief Executive Officer of the Victoria Bushfire Reconstruction and Recovery Authority and has previously served as my Chief of Staff when I was Deputy Opposition Leader and Deputy Prime Minister. </p>
