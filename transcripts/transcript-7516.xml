FOR MEDIA 3 MARCH 1989<br />
I have today signed an agreement with the Victorian Premier,<br />
Mr Cain, guaranteeing substantially increased Commonwealth<br />
funding for the State's public hospital system over the next<br />
five years.<br />
As a result Commonwealth/ State funding arrangements for<br />
public hospitals have entered a new era.<br />
For the first time, the Federal Government has agreed to<br />
index the grant not only to take account of general cost<br />
increases, but also to reflect ageing and growth of the<br />
State's population.<br />
older people are major users of hospital services and the<br />
new funding arrangements will ensure the grants keep pace<br />
with the general ageing of the population.<br />
This new formula will give Victorian public hospitals more<br />
than $ 250 million in extra Federal funds over the next five<br />
years. Under the new Medicare hospital agreements, Victoria will<br />
receive $ 793 million in 1988/ 89, including $ 3.5 million<br />
towards the cost of treating AIDS patients and $ 9.4 million<br />
to fund a range of incentives designed to improve the<br />
efficiency of the public hospital system.<br />
The Premier has indicated that the incentive money will<br />
enable the State to develop innovative approaches to reduce<br />
the need for admission to hospital or to facilitate early<br />
discharge. This year's initiatives will include extra day<br />
surgery procedures, additional home nursing services and the<br />
formation of palliative care teams in metropolitan and<br />
country areas.<br />
The new agreement provides proof of Labor's continuing<br />
commitment to the principles of Medicare, and specifically<br />
reinforces the right of public patients to free access to<br />
hospital services according to medical need.<br />
Both of our governments are totally committed to ensuring<br />
that Medicare patients continue to receive comprehensive,<br />
high quality care. In addition to the already substantial<br />
funding provided by the State, the new Commonwealth grant<br />
will enable Victoria to maintain the fine record of its<br />
public hospitals. </p>
