    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Great War which we remember today was the most cataclysmic conflict in human history, at least in military terms.</p>
<p>It was also the crucible in which our nation was formed.</p>
<p>Of a population of under 5 million; more than 400,000 volunteered, more than 300,000 served overseas, more than 150,000 were wounded and more than 60,000 never came home.</p>
<p>It was sacrifice on a stupendous scale.</p>
<p>Of those who returned, all bore the scars – seen and unseen. Our nation bore the scars. It still does.</p>
<p>As well as suffering, there is another legacy; a legacy of comradeship under fire, of service and sacrifice, of duty in a good cause.</p>
<p>Of the original ANZACs the official war historian Charles Bean said, “their example rises, as it will always rise, above the mists of ages; a memorial to great hearted-men and for their nation, a possession forever.”</p>
<p>And so today we remember all of them, we remember all who have worn our country’s uniform – we remember them – and dedicate ourselves to be worthy of their example.</p>
<p>Lest we forget.</p>
