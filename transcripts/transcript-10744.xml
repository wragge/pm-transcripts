<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>Well Mr Howard it is great to see you again, welcome to Midday.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well it's good to be back. Hello everybody.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>Well Mr Howard, we took the liberty this morning of asking our</p>
<p>   audience here to give us a few questions to direct them to you.</p>
<p>   So on their behalf...now, I'm sorry, where are you from</p>
<p>   again?</p>
<p> [AUDIENCE INTERJECTION]</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Where from?</p>
<p>KENNERLEY: </p>
<p>Everybody over in the corner...absolutely jam-packed, fun-filled</p>
<p>   today. And as I said, the audience has very kindly given us some</p>
<p>   questions to pose to you. We have Mrs Betty Pawsy from Emu Plains.</p>
<p>   Betty, where are you? She's up on the left there Prime Minister.</p>
<p>   Betty tells us she doesn't mind the GST on most things but</p>
<p>   not on food or essentials. Well that is sort of a statement, what</p>
<p>   is your response to Betty's suggestion?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well my response, Betty, is that if you leave out food then there'll</p>
<p>   be pressure to leave out something else. And the best way to accommodate</p>
<p>   peoples concerns on that is to make sure that you have adequate</p>
<p>   compensation for people on low incomes. I mean pensioners will get</p>
<p>   a 4 per cent increase from the 1st of July 2000 when</p>
<p>   it comes in and that will always be 1.5 per cent ahead of any increase</p>
<p>   in the cost of living. And over and above that there'll be</p>
<p>   other changes in relation to self-funded retirees. We are getting</p>
<p>   rid of provisional tax. We are introducing a 30 per cent tax deduction</p>
<p>   for the cost of private health insurance. And, of course, we are</p>
<p>   having right across the range reductions in personal income tax.</p>
<p>   The biggest challenge we face is to fix a system that is no longer</p>
<p>   working. I know it would be easier for me to go to the election</p>
<p>   and just offer you tax cuts and say the system is good and we can</p>
<p>   survive with it. But I face the reality that the present tax system</p>
<p>   is crumbling and unless we change it and we substitute a new system</p>
<p>   we are not going to get enough revenue in the years ahead to support</p>
<p>   our education services, our medical services or our police. And</p>
<p>   so I have not taken the easy option. The easy option is to offer</p>
<p>   a tax cut and not offer any reform or change or any of the hard</p>
<p>   bits. But I have come to the people and I have said I have put it</p>
<p>   all on the line and I face the reality that we need to change the</p>
<p>   present system if we are to have a stable economic base into the</p>
<p>   next century. And I think that is the open, honest thing to do.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>Betty, all or nothing, does that satisfy you?</p>
<p>BETTY PAWSY: </p>
<p>No, not really.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>Okay, well let's move on to Sue Bennett from Penrith. Sue</p>
<p>   is asking Âhow will the GST affect the cost of sending children</p>
<p>   to school?'</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well you have got to look at the family's income, the average</p>
<p>   family will be $40 to $50 a week better off. The education fees,</p>
<p>   as such, will not be subject to a GST but anything that is outside</p>
<p>   the normal provision inside a curriculum would be. The cost of uniforms</p>
<p>   would be affected if that's what you are asking but then there</p>
<p>   will be tax cuts in the family pocket to more than compensate for</p>
<p>   that.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>Sue, do you have a specific question there?</p>
<p>SUE BENNETT:</p>
<p>If the child excursions and those sorts of things....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I am sorry, I can't hear you.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>Child excursions.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well if it's part of the curriculum it is not covered.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>Okay. Here we have another question from Bill at Artarmon. ÂOur</p>
<p>   cricketers are heading off to Pakistan for a tour after the Commonwealth</p>
<p>   Games, is it safe, given the latest rounds of terrorist attacks</p>
<p>   Â and, of course, just on this morning's news we saw Planet</p>
<p>   Hollywood in Capetown being bombed in retaliation Â do you</p>
<p>   think it's safe for our cricketers to go to Pakistan?'</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well the latest information is yes. It's one of those situations</p>
<p>   that can change quite rapidly but the latest information we have</p>
<p>   is that it is still safe. If we had any information to the contrary</p>
<p>   the Government would naturally advise the Australian Cricket Board.</p>
<p>   But at the moment the information is that it is still quite safe</p>
<p>   and we don't want to interrupt sporting links. Sporting links</p>
<p>   soothe out political tensions and it is always a bad thing to, at</p>
<p>   the drop of a hat, interrupt the sporting contact between two countries</p>
<p>   and we are very loathe to do that.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>When was the last time you talked to Bill Clinton?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I spoke to Bill Clinton on the telephone earlier this year when</p>
<p>   he rang me to discuss the possible participation of Australians</p>
<p>   in the Gulf exercise. </p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>This was like third down, I put it order, this is from Melina.</p>
<p>   ÂShould Bill Clinton resign from the Presidency because of</p>
<p>   the Monica Lewinsky case and sex scandal?' I am only asking</p>
<p>   the questions here.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well it is not...I am not an American citizen. I am an Australian</p>
<p>   Prime Minister and it is a matter for the American people. But can</p>
<p>   I say, I think President Clinton has been a very good President,</p>
<p>   I think he has been. And I think he has been a good friend of Australia's.</p>
<p>   In my own dealings with him I have found him direct and I have found</p>
<p>   him very positive. His own political situation is in the hands of</p>
<p>   the American Congress and the American people just as my political</p>
<p>   future is in the hands of you. That's how the system operates.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>She does go on to ask, Âwhat would you do if you were in his</p>
<p>   shoes?'</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>There are some questions that are just too hard!</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>Now we were talking about cricket Mr Prime Minister, in fact, I</p>
<p>   am sure you are aware it is Don Bradman's birthday. He turns</p>
<p>   90 tomorrow. Is there something you would like to say or a tribute</p>
<p>   like.....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I would like to say to you Don: you are the greatest living</p>
<p>   Australian without any argument. You are not only the greatest cricketer</p>
<p>   Australia has produced and the world has seen but you are also an</p>
<p>   Australian legend and an Australian icon. You brought hope and inspiration</p>
<p>   to a depression weary Australian nation in the 1930s and the extraordinary</p>
<p>   thing about you is that although it's almost 50 years since</p>
<p>   you stopped playing cricket your name is still the greatest name</p>
<p>   in world cricket. It is said that the two best known Australian</p>
<p>   names on the Indian sub-continent are Don Bradman and Allan Border</p>
<p>   by a country mile. And what is so marvellous about Don Bradman is</p>
<p>   his values, his love of sport for the sake of the game and not just</p>
<p>   the dollar, the fact that he is a modest understated man, a person</p>
<p>   who has shunned publicity but has without doubt been, I think, the</p>
<p>   most properly celebrated Australian of this century.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>Very well said. And I think we should all sing Happy Birthday</p>
<p>   for Mr Don Bradman tomorrow. [Sings Happy Birthday] Gee you</p>
<p>   are in fine voice at the moment Mr Howard.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well it's very, very easy. It's a labour of love to participate</p>
<p>   in the singing of that for such a man.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>Fantastic. Okay, we move on to more questions. From M Keen from</p>
<p>   Oberon. Hello M Keen. Hi, nice to have you with us. Will the levy</p>
<p>   come off petrol before the GST is added?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The price of petrol at the bowser will not go up so the answer</p>
<p>   to your question is that it will happen simultaneously. The excise</p>
<p>   will come down by the amount that's equivalent to the GST and</p>
<p>   the price will not go up 1 cent at the bowser. But better than that,</p>
<p>   in the bush the price of diesel, it's going to fall dramatically</p>
<p>   all over Australia but what that's going to mean particularly</p>
<p>   in the bush is that the cost of transporting goods is going to fall</p>
<p>   quite sharply because we're going to reduce the excise on diesel</p>
<p>   from 43 cents a litre to 18 on trucks...heavy trucks and rail.</p>
<p>   But on top of that if you are in business anywhere in Australia</p>
<p>   the price of your petrol used for business will fall by 7 cents</p>
<p>   a litre because the GST, you'll be able to reclaim it if you</p>
<p>   use the petrol for business. So for the ordinary motorist, no increase</p>
<p>   at all at the bowser. For somebody in business, 7 cents a litre</p>
<p>   cheaper because you get the GST back because it's a tax on</p>
<p>   your business inputs. And for the bush generally a big reduction</p>
<p>   in the cost of transport. About $3.5 billion off the cost of transport</p>
<p>   and that is very significant for a country as big as Australia.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>Terrific. Margaret Mooring from South Penrith. Margaret. Now here's</p>
<p>   one everybody in Australia has been asking. Margaret wants to know</p>
<p>   what date is the election. Margaret, come on you try and encourage</p>
<p>   the Prime Minister. I'd love him to tell you. It would be terrific</p>
<p>   for us if he told us now.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well Margaret, I haven't decided, I really haven't. It's</p>
<p>   not that I'm indecisive it's just that you always assess</p>
<p>   a lot of things. I mean we are due to have an election sometime</p>
<p>   between now and March of next year. It won't be this weekend</p>
<p>   and it won't be the weekend of the football Grand Finals I</p>
<p>   can promise all you, and that it definitely won't be. That</p>
<p>   would be sacrilegious to do that. But I honestly haven't made</p>
<p>   up my mind. Obviously I'm thinking about it and I'm talking</p>
<p>   to some of my colleagues and as soon as I've made up my mind,</p>
<p>   naturally I'll speak to the Governor-General and make an announcement</p>
<p>   if I get his permission. So that's how the system works. But</p>
<p>   at the moment I haven't. I've gone around Australia explaining</p>
<p>   the value of the proposals we're putting forward and the fact</p>
<p>   that we think it is time for this country to have a new tax system</p>
<p>   for the new century but also talking about other things. This election</p>
<p>   won't only be about taxation. It will be about a number of</p>
<p>   other things as well.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>Margaret, he's not going to tell you.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't know. I'm sorry Margaret.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>John Singleton was on the program last week. I, in fact, asked</p>
<p>   him what he thought of the tax package and this what he had to say.</p>
<p>SINGLETON: </p>
<p>As far as John Howard's tax package is concerned I think</p>
<p>   it's an improvement but it's a long way for me from being</p>
<p>   the answer. I would have started it and saying: hey! How come the</p>
<p>   Government spends so much money and do they really need to spend</p>
<p>   this? Do we really need all these departments in Canberra that are</p>
<p>   duplicated in the States.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>Why do we?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I don't think there's as much duplication as John</p>
<p>   suggests. Can I say to have the former Labor Party advertising man</p>
<p>   saying it's an improvement on the present system is a fantastic</p>
<p>   rap. That's all I can say. I mean it is....I mean remember</p>
<p>   John's background.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>Yes, he use to do the Labor Party commercials. But has he not got</p>
<p>   a point saying why is the Government spending all this money and</p>
<p>   there's duplication. You don't believe that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No I don't believe that, given the level of services that</p>
<p>   we've got to promote. You take something like education. I</p>
<p>   mean there's a federal education department but the Federal</p>
<p>   Government has responsibility for universities. We have responsibility</p>
<p>   for independent schools and we provide the State government with</p>
<p>   a lot of money for State schools. So the idea....</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>Is there room for tightening up?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>There's always room for tightening up. I mean...</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>Then why hasn't it been done?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well there has been. Welfare cheats, we've clocked them back</p>
<p>   to the tune of $46 million a week since we've been in Government</p>
<p>   and one of the elements of the taxation plan I announced 10 days</p>
<p>   ago is a crackdown on tax avoidance through the abuse of trusts.</p>
<p>   And one of the great benefits of a GST is that it spreads the net</p>
<p>   more widely and you'll pick up a lot of money from the cash</p>
<p>   economy. A GST is harder to dodge than any other tax on Earth and</p>
<p>   that is one of it's great advantages because when people dodge</p>
<p>   their tax all of us pay more because we're the honest tax payers</p>
<p>   who are part of the PAYE tax system.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>Very quick ones to finish. You've been asked the worst political</p>
<p>   mistake you've ever made.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I think, I suppose one of the worst political mistakes I've</p>
<p>   made was to assume that because we won the last election with a</p>
<p>   huge majority that the parties who we defeated would allow the legislation</p>
<p>   we wanted to put through to go through the Senate without opposition.</p>
<p>   I assumed that because we'd won the last election with a majority</p>
<p>   of 44 seats then the Labor Party and the Democrats in the Senate</p>
<p>   would take their cue from what the public said and let our legislation</p>
<p>   through. Instead of that they delayed and in some cases obstructed</p>
<p>   outright. So that was a miscalculation on my part.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>You misjudged them. You're politicians.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, no I just assumed that if the public had something then they</p>
<p>   would have agreed.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>And what will your address be in the year 2000?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well that will be in the hands of the Australian people. Like any</p>
<p>   other Prime Minister of this country I would like to be re-elected</p>
<p>   but I don't take you or any of your fellow country men and</p>
<p>   women for granted. It's a matter for the Australian people</p>
<p>   to decide. I've tried to do my best. I think I've made</p>
<p>   some great improvements. I've got the country out of the red</p>
<p>   and back into the black. We've got very low interest rates,</p>
<p>   the lowest in 30 or 40 years. And I'm very proud of the fact</p>
<p>   that this country's now got a surplus rather than a deficit</p>
<p>   of $10.5 billion. I've displayed the courage to say to the</p>
<p>   Australian people you can't have tax reform and tax goodies</p>
<p>   and income tax cuts without fixing the system. I mean that's</p>
<p>   fairies at the bottom of the garden stuff to believe you can have</p>
<p>   all the goodies without the harder bits.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>Our dollar, if I may just as we finish, our dollar hitting a real</p>
<p>   low last night. When do you take action when our dollar's so</p>
<p>   bad.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well Kerri-Anne, I'm sorry to be difficult but Prime Ministers</p>
<p>   and Treasurers should never, and I never have and never will, as</p>
<p>   a Prime Minister, talk about the level of the dollar. It's</p>
<p>   just one of those things that...it is not in the interest of</p>
<p>   our country that I answer questions like that because some of those</p>
<p>   people who make their money out of speculation and who don't</p>
<p>   really worry much about the national interest might try and interpret</p>
<p>   my remarks in a particular way and I don't want that to happen</p>
<p>   because that might damage our country.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>I accept that. </p>
<p>Thank you very much Prime Minister for joining us today.</p>
