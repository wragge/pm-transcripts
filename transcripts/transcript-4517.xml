_ XAUSTV~ LIA Ll<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 16 OCTOBER 1977<br />
AUSTRALIAN WOOL CORPORATION OVERSEAS BORROWING<br />
The Government has decided that the Australian Wool Corporation<br />
should be allowed to borrow overseas against the value of its<br />
overseas stocks to finance the Corporation's inventory of wool<br />
held outside Australia.<br />
This decision has been taken because of the considerable<br />
advantage which will result for the Corporation and for wool<br />
growers. The Prime Minister said that the Premiers would clearly require<br />
to be consulted about the new borrowing authority. He said that<br />
he would be putting the matter to the Premiers at the Premiers'<br />
Conference scheduled for 21 October. </p>
