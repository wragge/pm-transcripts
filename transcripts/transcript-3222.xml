PRIME MINISTER PRESS STATEMENT NO. 239<br />
26 April 1974<br />
BY-LAW POLICY<br />
The Prime Minister announced today that following discussions<br />
with a wide range of industries and industry associations, the<br />
Government had decided to publish a Green Paper on by-law policy<br />
under which goods enter Australia free of duty where local products<br />
are not suitably equivalent or reasonably available. The Green Paper<br />
would draw together the options available to the community in this<br />
important area of policy.<br />
The Prime Minister said that he welcomed the co-operation<br />
which had been so readily given by industry to the work of the<br />
interdepartmental group, chaired by his Department, which is<br />
examining the matter. The Government has in mine' that the Green Paper<br />
will provide a basis for further industry comment and community<br />
discussion. The Prime Minister mentioned that by-law entry accounts<br />
for about 25 per cent of all imports. The implications of any<br />
change in the system are therefore very far-reaching.<br />
