<p>The Prime Minister is continuing to makeÂ satisfactory progress.</p>
<p>Hoowever, as viral pleurisy normally takesÂ five to seven days to run its course, Mr. Holt will haveÂ to remain in bed for a day or two yet. He is hopefulÂ that he will be back in Parliament during the week outÂ this will depend on his further progress.Â </p>
<p>His doctor gave him a thorough check-up todayÂ and confirmed that there were no complications.</p>
