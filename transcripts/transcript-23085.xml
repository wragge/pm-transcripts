    <content><![CDATA[<p>I was very pleased to join Indonesian Vice President, His Excellency Professor DrÂ Boediono, today to launch the Australia-Indonesia Centre.</p>
<p>The Centre will strengthen Australiansâ knowledge and understanding of this vitally important neighbour and will strengthen business, education and research links between the two countries.</p>
<p>The Australian Government will contribute $15 million towards the Centre, which will also receive support from participating institutions and the private sector.</p>
<p>The Centre will be based at Monash University and will initially be a partnership with the Australian National University, the University of Melbourne, the University of Sydney and the CSIRO.</p>
<p>The Centre will also undertake joint research on significant issues which confront both countries, including infrastructure and food security.</p>
<p>Australia and Indonesia are great friends, and I hope this Centre, which I announced during my first visit to Indonesia as Prime Minister in September, will contribute to that friendship.</p>
<p>Along with the New Colombo Plan, the Centre is another sign of the Governmentâs commitment to strengthen links with Indonesia.</p>
