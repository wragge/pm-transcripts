PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP, PARLIAMENT HOUSE, 19 FEBRUARY<br />
1990<br />
E O E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, have you been able to<br />
discuss the State Bank situation with Mr Cain or Mr<br />
Jolly? PM: I haven't anything to say about that at this stage.<br />
I had some brief conversation initiated by them, but I<br />
haven't got anything to say about that at this stage.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you think Mr Jolly should go, Mr Hawke?<br />
PM: No, I saw that beat up on the front page of The Age<br />
for which there is no foundation. Mr Davidson spoke<br />
neither to me or to Mr Hogg. There is absolutely no<br />
foundation for that story.<br />
ends </p>
