PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIE MINISTER, TIRE HON P. J KEATING MP,<br />
AND BRITISH PRIME MINISTER, THRE HON JOHN* MAJOR, DOORSTOP,<br />
LE MERIDLEN HOTEL, LIIMASSOL, THURSDAY, 21 OCTOBER 1993<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
JM: The Prime Minister and I have had the opportunity of discussion upstairs. We<br />
have been able to range over a whole serie; of international matters, but<br />
predominantly we have concentrated our time on the agenda here at this Heads<br />
of Government meeting. I was delighted with what the Prime Minister had to<br />
say at the opening ceremony about the necessity for an agreement on the<br />
Uruguay round. I took the opportunity this allernoon of re-emphasising that<br />
message. What is very striking about the disi.-ussions we have got here, we<br />
have one third of the nations of the world present at this conference<br />
representing one quarter of the worlds population and a very powerful feeling<br />
from countries all around the world that it is vitally important we can reach an<br />
agreement to the Uruguay round this year. Wc have a further discussion on it<br />
tomorrow and I rather expect that feeling will ) e taken a good deal further. I<br />
won't elaborate on other issues for the moment. I will invite the Prime Minister<br />
to say a word or two and then we'll take questicons for a few moments.<br />
PJK. I can only add to what the Prime inister has said, that I myself was struck by<br />
the genuine concern by those represented about the GATT and the Uruguay<br />
round, the very strong expressions of opinion that came this morning in the first<br />
half dozen speeches the speeches in respome to the welcome of President<br />
Clerides and then in more formal session this . afternoon again, the theme was<br />
repeated. So, there is I think, a very clear und-erstanding that there has been a<br />
very large transfer of wealth from the developing countries to the developed<br />
world via the terms of trade through low ; ommodity prices and that an<br />
outcome in the Uruguay round has to be an outcome to serve everybody, not<br />
just the developed countries in things such as intellectual property rights and<br />
services, but also to give the third world, the developing world, a chance to<br />
improve their incomes and get access to bigger markets. So, it is very much a<br />
live issue here I am pleased to say.<br />
J: Gentlemen, how much more can you achieve fr om GATT with just a strongly<br />
worded statement out of the Commonwealth, have you Mr Keating suggested<br />
that the Prime Minister could push France harder through the EC? </p>
<p>PJK: I complemented the Prime Minster on the positions that he has taken<br />
consistently on the GATT now for some years and again more recently in his<br />
urging's which he has made with member state., of the European Community.<br />
We can't ask any more than that those of us of the Cairns group, but there is n<br />
doubt that the December 15 deadline is not going to be extended by the<br />
American Congress; this is a real deadline and I think that there has to be<br />
pressure brought upon France in particular, probably including by the industrial<br />
members of the French economy as well as though, more generally the world<br />
community.<br />
3M: If I can add something to that. It is a fairly clear choice by the end of this year<br />
either we have an agreement on the Uruguay round and a substantial increase<br />
in the volume of world trade that will help ev.-ry developed and developing<br />
country around the world, or we have no agreement and a very real danger of<br />
protection, retaliation, collapse in the levels of world trade and a rapid growth<br />
of unemployment. I do not think that is putting the situation too starkly it is<br />
as clear cut as that. Faced with that, I think t1~ ere is no doubt that everyone<br />
must make concessions whatever their domestic. difficulties with the intention<br />
of reaching an agreement.<br />
J: Prime Minister, Mr Keating, did Dr Mahathir's re: marks on GATT reassure you<br />
for the possibility of doing a deal with him on the APEC issue?<br />
P3K: I do not think the two are related. The point is that there is an expansion<br />
occurring world wide. The American economy is picking up, early next year<br />
we expect the Japanese economy to start to groxA again, more solidly and this is<br />
the right time in a low inflationary cycle, in a clear upturn after the problems of<br />
the late 1980s and early 1990s that we have a chance to really improve the<br />
velocity of trade without, as the Prime Minister Eays, seeing countries fall back<br />
into trading blocks or trade tactics which would be pointless with a good<br />
outcome of the GAIT.<br />
J: Mr Major, do you agree with Mr Keating that mcere pressure should be put on<br />
France?<br />
JM: I think more pressure should be put on everyone who hasn't yet found<br />
themselves in a position to agree to a conclusion 10 the Uruguay round. France<br />
is often mentioned France is not the only impediment to be overcome, there<br />
are other ones as well. I think it is necessary for every nation to look at what<br />
needs to be done and judge what the impact woud be if we were unsuccessful.<br />
I think right the way across Europe that is well understood.<br />
J: Prime Minister, that common ground amongst everybody who is here, what<br />
can you achieve beyond simply restating it? What will you do to push the<br />
process forward?<br />
JM: We have a lengthy discussion on that tomorrow. I think those are matters for<br />
discussion tomorrow. </p>
<p>J: Mr Keating, what is your prediction now for the outcome of that round, are<br />
you hopeflul of success?<br />
PJK: I am still hopeful of success. It has had seven y(; ars in the making, there are so<br />
many obvious benefits for so many countries in the round and I think that on<br />
balance, even those who have expressed difficultes will, on balance, be winners<br />
from it and can't believe that in the end they will see it fai as a consequence of<br />
intransigence on one point or another.<br />
J: Mr Keating, apart from GATT did you discuss the prospects of Australia<br />
becoming a republic?<br />
PJK: No, no, no the Prime Minister and I had a chat about that in London, I think<br />
you might remember and we didn't discuss it tday. This is an issue in our<br />
constitutional life which will take some time 1o be resolved, but like most<br />
national debates of substance they take time.<br />
J: Did you talk about the future of the Commonwealth?<br />
JM: I think when many people look at the Commonwealth, they think it is just<br />
bound together loosely with intangible ties. I think that understates what the<br />
Commonwealth does and understates it quite dramatically. Many of the<br />
principles that we agreed at Harare two years ago are now being put into<br />
practice. A number of Commonwealth countrieE that weren't democracies two<br />
years ago are now democracies. The level of trade in the Commonwealth is a<br />
very dramatic instance of the close relationship that exists between countries<br />
often on different parts of the globe. I think those people who stand back and<br />
say well, the Commonwealth may have been of !; ome use years ago, but it is a<br />
little out of date now, I believe they are absolutely and totally wrong and I<br />
think this conference will prove it.<br />
J: Mr Keating, would you see a republican Australia stay a part of the<br />
Commonwealth?<br />
PJK: Entirely and definitely because I think that as the Prime Minister has said,<br />
intangible though some of these links may be, it is the intangible quality, the<br />
common ground, the common history, in many respects, of course, the<br />
common language and the success the Commonwealth has had in such weighty<br />
matters as South Africa in just recent times. I think it is very difficult to get a<br />
grouping of nations states together today for w. iat ever reason. But to have<br />
one with a history like this representing such a large part of the worlds<br />
population and production is a unique opporturtity to, I think, not only raise<br />
matters of international significance, but actually ; eek to remedy some of them.<br />
JM: Thanks very much indeed.<br />
