JOURNALIST: 14r Hawke, Glen Ella says South Africa is not s~ ji<br />
a bad place. What do you think of that? i<br />
PM: Well, I have not soon what Glan Ella has said. Rd 1L' 111<br />
don't viant to involve myself in any observations about len,<br />
I think that the world has an overwhelming amount of ev dant'<br />
that tho society of South Africa is totally objectionab. e<br />
JOURNALIST: Has he clmbarrassod you this week?<br />
PH: No, he hasnnt ambarrarissd me.<br />
JOURNALISTa Why did the Governent, Mr Hawkin, not put ore<br />
pressure on the Rugby Union to ban these players? I<br />
PH: Wall, that's something that I would rather loavo f r a<br />
later date. I havo at this ataga no roacon to baliavo hct<br />
the Auatralian Rugby Union ia going to participate or<br />
condona Auotralion involveint at an official level, a<br />
team lovol in compatition with South Africa, but the Hisnt i<br />
as you know, hao written to the Australian Rugby Union, landH<br />
I am optimiotic that out of the discuotiions that wiill t4eI<br />
place botvioen tho Minister anid the Rugby Union that wo %-4ill I.<br />
not have any infringement at that level of the Glaeaglos 1<br />
Agra= nt.<br />
i. JOURNALISTs Prigie N~ inistor, have you boon kept abrao of ' 1<br />
Aaonatan ivch ' Tvr. n .1ays s&amp; mnedia 1a~ e * Lma<br />
concern? .1<br />
PH: No, all I have Boon at this stage is the reforence 1cto<br />
twelve, I think, individuala. That is an initial cable tal<br />
I1 h~ vo -got. I will cortainly be seeking to romain fulN<br />
informed, but X have no more details at this etage.<br />
JOUIM3LIST: Do you think the frontlinie totatoo in Afric-wi 21<br />
oupport the coimitteo proceca? it would oem to be,.<br />
lanet ouprficially, a cof tening of thoir hLardlina poui ion<br />
to dicniantle nparthaid now, a they have said. 1<br />
PM: N~ o, but I think, Grog, that thrat queation in that orm0=<br />
mis-un eoFotandJ what we are talking about. If we viora j* U13t.,<br />
talking about a comittoe procaca, then I boliove thkt i<br />
