    <content><![CDATA[<p>Since coming to government, my colleagues and I have been putting in place our Economic Action Strategy to build a strong and prosperous economy for a safe and secure Australia.</p>
<p>The Budget, to be delivered on Tuesday night is another big step forward in strengthening our economy.</p>
<p>For many months, the Government has been carefully and methodically working on this Budget.  We’ve had an audit report, we’ve dealt with the experts and we’ve undertaken detailed economic analysis.</p>
<p>It will be a responsible Budget and it will be a fair Budget.  It will be fair because all of us will play our part.</p>
<p>By sharing the load, we lighten the load – and together we can chip away at the debt and deficits that are currently costing Australians $1 billion every single month in interest, in dead money.</p>
<p>While the debt and deficit problem that we face is not of our making, the Coalition Government is taking responsibility for getting the Budget back on track.</p>
<p>And we are honouring our commitments to end the waste, to get the Budget under control and to build the infrastructure of the 21st century.</p>
<p>Our legislation to scrap the carbon tax is ready to be passed – this carbon tax is a $550 a year hit on the average Australian family.  </p>
<p>So on Tuesday, Australians will see that the Government is keeping its commitment to repair the Budget, to strengthen the economy and to invest in the roads of the future.  </p>
<p>This is an important time for our country – the Government will build a stronger, more sustainable economy where every Australian can share in the benefits.</p>
