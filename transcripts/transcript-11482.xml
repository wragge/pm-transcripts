    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE...................................................................................................</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Today's interest rate rise, is that the first of a number that will</p>
<p> be generated by the GST [inaudible]...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, it's really got nothing at all to do with the GST. The average</p>
<p> housing loan will still be $266 a month cheaper than what is was when</p>
<p> we came to office.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Will we see more interest rate rises as the GST kicks in?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Interest rates are set by the Reserve Bank and it's quite clear</p>
<p> from the Reserve Bank's statement this morning that this has really</p>
<p> been influenced by international factors. There's no reference at all</p>
<p> to the GST in the Governor's statement. So the line that it's</p>
<p> got something to do with the GST is wrong and the reality is that interest</p>
<p> rates now are miles below what they were when Labor was in power and the</p>
<p> average mortgage is $266 a month lower than in March of 1996.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[Inaudible] expected isn't it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I didn't make any prediction about rates.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>You and the Treasurer though had said that you didn't see any signs</p>
<p> that the economy was overheating. Do you think the Reserve Bank has?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, the Reserve Bank says that the economy is not overheating. If you</p>
<p> have a look at the Governor's statement you'll find that he</p>
<p> confirms what I said and what the Treasurer said. He spoke of the international</p>
<p> influences. The reality is that the world economy now is stronger than</p>
<p> what it was a year ago and central banks around the world are marginally</p>
<p> adjusting interest rates in an upward direction. There's wide speculation</p>
<p> that the Federal Reserve in the United States will lift interest rates</p>
<p> by half of one per cent or perhaps a little less in the next 24 hours.</p>
<p> Against that background, the Governor believed that this adjustment was</p>
<p> necessary but it's an adjustment that still leaves the average home</p>
<p> mortgage $266 a month better off than four years ago.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>This is going to hit regional areas hard though with average home loans</p>
<p> now going up by $30 a month because of the full half per cent increase.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, the average homebuyer is $266 a month better off than what he or</p>
<p> she was in March of 1996 and that's the bottom line. And the bottom</p>
<p> line is that even after this interest rates in Australia are dramatically</p>
<p> lower  dramatically lower  than what they were when Labor</p>
<p> left office in March of 1996.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>So the timing and the rise, is that appropriate in your view?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, the Governor explained the reasons for the Reserve Bank's</p>
<p> decision. As you know we have an arrangement where official interest rates</p>
<p> are set by the Reserve Bank and not by the Government and the Reserve</p>
<p> Bank has explained the reasons for the rise and those reasons do not include</p>
<p> the GST. He does not suggest that the economy is overheating and he talks</p>
<p> very freely about international factors.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr MacFarlane has always talked about the need though to be pre-emptive.</p>
<p> Half a per cent is fairly large in pre-emptive terms isn't it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, he's put it in the context of the international situation</p>
<p> and I think you ought to read his statement. It was a decision taken by</p>
<p> the Reserve Bank under the arrangement whereby it independently sets official</p>
<p> interest rates.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Queensland farmers say this will impact them significantly. What do you</p>
<p> say to them?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, interest rates are dramatically lower now than what they were in</p>
<p> March of 1996, that's the reality.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, you have acknowledged the high unemployment problem in</p>
<p> the Tweed area, have you got any measures that you are looking at to try</p>
<p> and improve things up here at all?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, continuing to run a high growth economy, continuing to ensure that</p>
<p> employment throughout the country grows, that business conditions are</p>
<p> good. If we can get our GST reforms through and implement it which we</p>
<p> are in the process of doing then that will produce cheaper fuel in regional</p>
<p> Australia and will generally make for a better export climate. There are</p>
<p> some characteristics of this region, you know as well as I do, which mean</p>
<p> that the unemployment rate might always be a little above the national</p>
<p> average. It seems to be the kind of area that is appealing to people who</p>
<p> have a particular lifestyle and I think you have to make allowance for</p>
<p> that. It's unreasonable to expect that the unemployment rate here</p>
<p> will be exactly the same as in other parts of Australia. But it has come</p>
<p> down, it's now, what, five per cent lower than what it was a couple</p>
<p> of years ago and that's a very significant improvement.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[Inaudible] to stop regional services leaving the bush has already come</p>
<p> unstuck this morning, it revealed a plan to remove 28...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Are you talking about that story in the Sydney Morning Herald?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Yes, I am.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, that story totally distorts what the Government has done. The headline</p>
<p> was wrong. The story inaccurately and dishonestly represented what the</p>
<p> Government has done. The service provided there is the money the Government</p>
<p> provides for the Job Network system. We provide a large amount of money,</p>
<p> we call for tenders and whoever presents the best tender gets the money</p>
<p> and therefore with our money provides the service. Sure, Employment National</p>
<p> offices activities have gone but they have been more than replaced by</p>
<p> the Government funded private providers. Therefore the Commonwealth service</p>
<p> is better now, not worse, better than what it was under the old system.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, aren't there some potential problems however if a further</p>
<p> [inaudible] a national service with linked offices is diminished and replaced</p>
<p> by more discreet terms?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The test, Michelle, is whether you help the unemployed and whether you</p>
<p> have got a proper spread. And the new system is helping the unemployed</p>
<p> 50 per cent more than under the old system and I think it's splitting</p>
<p> hairs to allege that one provider is less able to provide the service</p>
<p> than another. Employment National didn't provide a competitive tender</p>
<p> and it's quite wrong of anybody to suggest that because Employment</p>
<p> National has missed out that the service has been diminished. The service</p>
<p> has been increased. The private providers are very effective. I have been</p>
<p> told in regional towns around New South Wales that the private providers</p>
<p> are most welcome. The new network is producing 50 per cent better outcomes</p>
<p> than the old Commonwealth Employment Service. And in the end it's</p>
<p> how you help the unemployed that determines the value of the employment</p>
<p> service.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[Inaudible] there's a town in Queensland, Murgon, closed their meatworks...they</p>
<p> want you to visit.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I can't do that. I mean, you know, I'd like to visit</p>
<p> every town in every part of Australia but I have a Cabinet meeting next</p>
<p> week. I will be going to rural Queensland as part of my continuing pattern</p>
<p> of visiting regional and rural parts of Australia. But this proposition</p>
<p> that every time you embark on a regional tour you are somehow or other</p>
<p> failing if you don't go to every town in every State is a little</p>
<p> bit rich. I notice the acting Premier of Victoria, Mr Brumby, was running</p>
<p> that rather infantile line.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, [inaudible] by the return of Cheryl Kernot and the circumstances</p>
<p> surrounding that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I wish her a full recovery in her health. I would wish that of</p>
<p> anybody in Australia. Beyond that I don't have any comment.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[Inaudible] for the Labor Party?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't have any comment on that. I think the liability for the</p>
<p> Labor Party is its lack of policy. And Mr Beazley has been Labor leader</p>
<p> for almost four years and he has no employment policy, he has no taxation</p>
<p> policy. Labor's liability is its policy vacuum.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Are you concerned that instability may arise from the continuing stand-off</p>
<p> in Indonesia between General Wiranto and the President?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, Indonesia's going through a very difficult transition phase</p>
<p> and it has our understanding and our sympathy. The new President is strongly</p>
<p> committed to democracy, he's strongly committed to a more open political</p>
<p> system. I welcome the fact that there is a serious investigation being</p>
<p> conducted into what occurred in East Timor and there's a determination</p>
<p> on the part of the authorities to bring people to account. Beyond that</p>
<p> I think any comment is really intruding a little into the internal affairs</p>
<p> of another country. Thank you.</p>
