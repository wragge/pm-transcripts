FOR '. EDIA TUESDAY, 22 JULY, 1980<br />
THE LAUNCHING OF DR. JOHN HICKMAN' S BOOK,<br />
" ONE STEP AT A TIME" ADELAIDE_____<br />
One of the most pleasing results of a cask such as this is the<br />
insight it provides into the life of one man, like Dr. Hickman,<br />
proceeding through life's experiences, one step at a time.<br />
Here is an entertaining and informative story of the day-to-day<br />
problems caused by physical disability.<br />
Because of books like this, we are made to stop and think about<br />
what it means to be a disabled person in the modern world.<br />
And such reflection is important.<br />
Dr. Hickman brings to his task, most admirable credentials.<br />
Most of us are familiar with his scholarship; it has been<br />
widely acclaimed.<br />
But one of the attractions of this book is that Dr. Hickman<br />
leaves the scholastic world behind and gives us a simple<br />
story of determination and perseverance; which reveals to us,<br />
the courage, humour and humanity of its author:<br />
The experiences he describes are quite outside our but<br />
Dr. Hickman writes so vividly and presents his reflections so<br />
well, that we become part of these experiences both the<br />
lighthearted and the heavyhearted.<br />
Underlying all this, the book is a story of triumph over<br />
barriers that, to many, prove insurmountable.<br />
Regrrett-)' bly, many of the; e barriers still exist;. not just th,<br />
obvious physical barriers that confront the physically disabled,<br />
but also, the more subtle barriers that are built into the<br />
attitudes and prejudices of many people when they are dealing<br />
with the disabled.<br />
This book gies us an ex-cellent ple of an incividual<br />
confronting these barriers. But it is also an example of ohe<br />
way in which obstacles can be overcome; abilities and<br />
potential realised. / 2<br />

The book demonstrates how important it is, with disabled<br />
people, to emphasise the capabilities of the people rather<br />
than the problems created by the disability.<br />
In fact the phrase " disabled people" is an unhappy phrase<br />
which attracts attention to disabilities first rather than<br />
to the positive abilities, aptitudes and interests possessed<br />
by people with handicaps.<br />
This book rcarinds us of the si. gn i-ana assets anC potential<br />
for growth possessed by one person with disabilities; and<br />
in doing so it reminds us of the continuing challenge to<br />
provid3 . h-a approp iate opportunities and proper en2ironment<br />
for all -hp eope i handicaps.<br />
I know these have been provided by the Crippled Childrens'<br />
Association of South Australia since its inception in 1939.<br />
In fact, Dr. Hickman's book is testimony to the fact that<br />
the Association's motto, " Hope and Opportunity", is not just<br />
a slogan but an active commitment to those with disabilities.<br />
Dr. Hickman's account of his school days at Ashford House<br />
demonstrates how the hope and the opportunity that he found<br />
there complemented the support and encouragement he received<br />
at home.<br />
I have no doubt that many people owe their start in life to<br />
Ashford House and the Crippled Children's Association of<br />
South Australia.<br />
The dedication of people like Miss Daphne Gum, the Director of<br />
Ashford, to the needs of handicapped children, must never pass<br />
unacknowledged. One of the most striking features about Dr. Hickman's book is<br />
the limited emphasis that he assigns to his own achievements.<br />
Many of us have read about these achievements the triumph<br />
over difficulty; gaining a Ph. D; and obtaining a research<br />
post at the A. N. U.<br />
These arc achievements to which Tost of us would never aspire;<br />
about -which any of us would be justifiably proud.<br />
Yet, in his book, Dr. HIickman passes over this sort of thing<br />
rather lightly.<br />
It th~ a t the rea milestones of his career, are when he<br />
comes to terms with some of the s implest tasks of everyday<br />
living; spending a night away from home; cooking . a meal for<br />
himself; emptying the vacuum cleaner; even hitting<br />
Sir Garfield Sobers for six; and taking on the bureaucracy<br />
and occasionally winning. / 13<br />

Problems like these confront many disabled people in<br />
our community every day.<br />
Because this book offers a means of understanding these<br />
problems, it is necessary reading for us all, a positive statement<br />
about life lived with disability.<br />
Towards the end, in a chapter which Dr.. Hickman has called,<br />
" Why Bother", he says, " to sor-eone who is born with<br />
disabilities, being handicapped is natural".<br />
Such a statement is in keeping with the confidence and<br />
determination of the book's title One Step At A Time.<br />
It is a motto for us all, in whatever we do..<br />
It is an approach that we can profitably carry with us as<br />
we go forward into the International Year for Disabled People<br />
in 1981.<br />
This year has the wholehearted support of the Federal<br />
Government; and we are looking forward to it being a year of<br />
action and achievement for handicapped people in Austral. ia.<br />
And this must be sustained in succeeding years.<br />
Improved care for the disabled is central to the Government's<br />
commitment.<br />
Over many years now, we have provided finance to community<br />
organisations through the handicapped persons' welfare<br />
programme. In this way, the Government has helped in the establishment<br />
and operation of facilities for handicapped children and<br />
adults.<br />
Last year, the Government provided substantial funds to<br />
eligible voluntary organisations under this programme.<br />
We also encouraged the development of rehabilitation programles<br />
to assist handicapped people who want so much to play a useful<br />
part in the community.<br />
Because of our belief in the great need. for this type of<br />
assistance to be more freely available, the Government<br />
in 1977 widened the eligibility criteria for remedial and<br />
training programmes.<br />
Wherv formerly, rehabilitation had been available only to tho.,; e<br />
with a reasonable prospect of employment; in November 1977,<br />
this was extended to the mentally and physically handicapped<br />
to enable them to live independently in their own homes. / 4 </p>
<p>-4-<br />
From that date onwards, this rehabilitation has been<br />
provided free of charge.<br />
And last year, the Commonwealth Government made increased<br />
provision for this purpose.<br />
Of course, declaring 1981 as the International Year for<br />
Disabled Persons gives a new and important focus to all<br />
these activities.<br />
Above all, such a declaration provides all Australians<br />
with an opportunity-to contribute to our national commitment<br />
to handicapped people and I urge them to do so.<br />
The CoIronrealth Mini. r: for Social Securi ty, Se. tor<br />
Dame Margaret Guilfoyle, has been given special responsibility<br />
for the co-ordination of Australian activities for this year<br />
and planning for a number of special projects is already<br />
under way.<br />
There have been meetings of a Council of Commonwealth and<br />
State Ministers at which activities for the year have<br />
been discussed.<br />
And there are State level planning committees composed of<br />
Government and non-Government representatives, local action<br />
and special interest groups.<br />
One of the themes selected for IYDP in Australia is " Access<br />
to Community Life".<br />
Two aspects of this theme are the need to increase the<br />
awareness in the community of the rights, abilities and potential<br />
of disabled people, and the promotion of their integration<br />
into community life through the elimination of barriers.<br />
Dr. Hickman's book brings a new understanding and a new<br />
confidence of the way in which these barriers can be confronted<br />
and overcome.<br />
The spirit, purpose and conviction which are alive in<br />
One Step At A Time must be translated into all we do, all the<br />
ti. me, for disabled persons.<br />
I would like to congratulate the publishers, Rigby Lirited.<br />
We all have good reason to be grateful to them;. not only because<br />
of the lessons we can learn from reading the book; butalso,<br />
because it is, in itself, an entertaining book.<br />
It is good humoured, sometimes very funny, and, above all, very<br />
readable. It is proof, if any more were needed, of the remarkable person<br />
that Dr. Hickman is. His achievements and now this text have<br />
inspired us all. It has been a great pleasure to be here with<br />
you today, and I am delighted to officially launch One Step At<br />
A Time. 000---</p>
