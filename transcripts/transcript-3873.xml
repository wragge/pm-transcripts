PRIME MINISTER'S WEEKLY BROADCAST<br />
RELBUDGiET<br />
SUNDAY 31 . AUGUST -1975<br />
I WANT TO DISCUSS WITH YOU SOME ASPECTS OF THE<br />
BUDGET WHICH THE PARLIAMENT HAS BEEN DEBATING DURING<br />
THE PAST WEEK., YOU WILL REMEMBER THAT THE BUDGET MADE A<br />
SWEEPING REFORM OF THE INCOME TAX SYSTEMx IT'S BEEN<br />
PERFECTLY CLEAR FROM THIS WEEK'S DEBATE THAT THE OPPOSITION<br />
HAS NO CREDIBLE ALTERNATIVE TO OUR ECONOMIC STRATEGY AND<br />
CERTAINLY NOTHING TO COMPARE WITH OUR TAX REFORMS<br />
MR FRASER'S PROPOSALS OFFER NOTHING WHATEVER TO THE PEOPLE<br />
MOST IN NEEDx THE GREAT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN US IS THIS:<br />
WE ARE REFORMING THE PERSONAL INCOME TAX SYSTEM TO GIVE<br />
RELIEF TO THE MAJORITY OF TAXPAYERS AND MAKE THE SYSTEM FAIR<br />
TO ALLx THE BEST THAT MR FRASER COULD PROPOSE IS SOME<br />
TINKERING WITH THE EXISTING TAX SCALESx UNDER THE OLD SYSTEM<br />
DEDUCTIONS FOR MEDICAL EXPENSES, EDUCATION, SUPERANNUATION<br />
AND OTHER EXPENSES WERE WORTH MYCH MORE TO THE WEALTHY MAN<br />
THAN TO PEOPLE ON LOWER INCOMESx THE WEALTHY MAN PAID LESS<br />
FOR THE THINGS WE ALL NEEDx UNDER OUR NEW SYSTEM, NOT ONLY<br />
WILL MOST PEOPLE HAVE MORE MONEY TO SPEND AFTER TAX IS<br />
DEDUCTED; BUT EVERYONE'S DEDUCTIONS FOR EXPENSES WILL BE<br />
WORTH EXACTLY THE SAME" </p>
<p>2,<br />
HERE'S A FIGURE TO REMEMBER: OVER THE NEXT<br />
TWO FINANCIAL YEARS THE AMOUNT COLLECTED IN PERSONAL<br />
INCOME TAX WILL BE NEARLY ONE BILLION DOLLARS LESS<br />
THAN IT WOULD HAVE BEEN UNDER THE OLD LIBERAL<br />
SYSTEMX THAT'S A MASSIVE SAVING TO THE TAXPAYERX<br />
AND DON'T FORGET THAT OUR TAX CUTS AREN'T SOME VAGUE<br />
PROMISE: THEY ARE ALREADY IN OPERATIONA BECAUSE<br />
THEY INVOLVE SUCH EXTENSIVE AND COMPLEX CHANGES IT<br />
WON'T BE POSSIBLE TO GET THE EXTRA MONEY INTO YOUR<br />
PAY PACKETS UNTIL THE BEGINNING OF THE NEW YEARX<br />
BUT IN FACT YOUR TAX SAVINGS ACTUALLY STARTED TO<br />
ACCRUE ON THE FIRST OF JULY LASTx ,/ 3 </p>
<p>APART FROM ANYTHING ELSE, THE DEBATE THIS<br />
WEEK HAS SHOWN JUST HOW JUDDLED AND EVASIVE ARE THE<br />
OPPOSITION'S ECONOMIC POLICIES, BECAUSE-WE HAD TO<br />
TACKLE INFLATION THERE WERE SOME THINGS IN THE BUDGET<br />
THAT NONE OF US LIKE, WE ANNOUNCED HIGHER CHARGES ON<br />
CIGARETTES, BEER, SPIRITS, PETROL AND RATES FOR POSTAGE<br />
AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS, WE SAW THESE AS AN ESSENTIAL<br />
PART OF OUR PLAN TO RAISE REVENUE AND REDUCE THE<br />
BUDGET DEFICIT. AS SOON AS THESE CHANGES WERE ANNOUNCED<br />
THEY WERE ATTACKED BY THE OPPOSITION. MR FRASER HIMSELF<br />
ATTACKED THEM IN HIS SPEECH ON TUESDAY NIGHT. YET<br />
WITHIN 24 HOURS MR LYNCH, THEIR DEPUTY LEADER, WAS<br />
FORCED TO ADMIT THAT EVERY ONE OF THESE HIGHER CHARGES<br />
WOULD BE SUPPORTED BY THE OPPOSITION, IN OTHER WORDS,<br />
AS SOON AS THE OPPOSITION WERE FORCED TO DO THEIR SUMS,<br />
THE MOMENT THEY HAD TO JUSTIFY AND EXPLAIN THEIR<br />
POLICIES, THEY ADMITTED THAT OUR ECONOMIC MEASURES<br />
WERE . SOUND AND JUSTIFIED. WE HAD THE EXTRAORDINARY<br />
SPECTACLE OF THE OPPOSITION LEADER IN THE SENATE,<br />
SENATOR WITHERS, ATTACKING THE NEW CHARGES AT THE VERY<br />
MOMENT MR LYNCH WAS SUPPORTING THEM. </p>
<p>YOU'LL NOTICE THAT THE OPPOSITION ARE<br />
ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT CUTTING GOVERNMENT TEXPENDITURE.<br />
MR FRASER SAID HE WOULD SAVE $ 1000 MILLION IN EXPENDITURE<br />
CUTS. YET HE AND HIS COLLEAGUES KEEP ON PROPOSING<br />
MEASURES WHICH WOULD PUSH EXPENDITURE FURTHER AHEADMORE<br />
FOR DEFENCE, MORE FOR THE SCHOOL, WITH THE HIGHEST<br />
FEES, MORE FOR CADET CORPS, MORE FOR CERTAIN INDUSTRIES. 1<br />
THEY NEVER SPELL OUT CLEARLY WHERE THEIR CUTS IN EXPENDITURE<br />
WOULD COME FROM. MR FRASER GAVE A LIST OF SO-CALLED<br />
SAVINGS IN HIS SPEECH THIS WEEK, IT SIMPLY DOESN'T<br />
BEAR EXAMINATION. HE TALKED OF SUSPENDING OUR GROWTH<br />
CENTRE PROGRAM, OF CUTTING BACK LOANS FOR NEW HOUSING,<br />
OF SCRAPPING OUR LEGAL AID SERVICE, OF ABANDONING URANIUM<br />
EXPLORATION, OF DISPOSING OF OUR GAS PIPELINES,<br />
* THESE PROPOSALS WOULD BE DISASTROUS ENOUGH IN THEMSELVES,<br />
BUT THEY STILL WOULDN'IT LEAD TO SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIES.<br />
TRY AS HE MIGHT, MR ERASER COULDN'T MAKE HIS SAVINGS ADD<br />
UP TO ANYTHING LIKE $ 1000 MILLION. MR LYNCH HAD TO<br />
EXPLAIN LATER THAT MR FRASER WAS ONLY GIVING EXAMPLES<br />
OF THE CUTS THE OPPOSITION WOULD MAKE. IN OTHER WORDS0,<br />
MR FRASER IS HOLDING OUT ON US. IT DOESN'T TAKE MUCH<br />
IMAGINATION TO SEE WHERE THE REAL CUTS WOULD COME FR . M<br />
IF THE LIBERALS HAD THEIR WAY. THEY WOULD COME FROM<br />
OUR PROGRAMS FOR THE CITIES, FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT*<br />
FOR BETTER PUBLIC TRANSPORT, FOR DECENT SCHOOLS, FOR<br />
BETTER HEALTH SERVICES AND HOSPITALS, FOR ADEQUATE SOCIAL<br />
SECURITY. THE PEOPLE WHO-WJOULD PAY FOR MR FRASER'S<br />
ECONOMIC POLICIES ARE THE POOR, THE NEEDY, THE SICK,<br />
THE CHILDREN, THE AGED, THE PEOPLE WHO LIVER IN NEWER<br />
SUBURBS AND COUNTRY TOWNS.<br />
.1 </p>
<p>MR FRASER'S POLICIES WOULD MEAN A SAVAGE ATTACK -ON<br />
THE LIVING STANDARDS OF THE VAST MAJORITY OF<br />
AUSTRALIANS, IT IS EASY TO SEE MR FRASER'S DILEMMA.<br />
WHILE HE APPROVES OF THE SIZE OF OUR DEFICIT AND<br />
HAS SAID AS MUCH HE STILL ADVOCATES FURTHER<br />
CUTS IN TAXES MAINLY TO BENEFIT THE WEALTHY AND<br />
MORE EXPENDITURE ON SUCH THINGS AS THE SUPERPHOSPHATE<br />
BOUNTY MAINLY TO BENEFIT WEALTHY FARMERS LIKE<br />
MR FRASER HIMSELF, WELL, HE CAN'T HAVE IT BOTH<br />
WAYS, THE SYDNEY MORNING HERALD NO FRIEND OF<br />
THE GOVERNMENT SUMMED IT UP THIS WAY:<br />
" IT WOULD SIMPLY NOT BE POSSIBLE TO STEP INTO<br />
-GOVERNMENT AND IMMEDIATELY KNOCK A FURTHER $ 1000<br />
' MILLION OFF GOVERNMENT SPENDING OVERNIGHT,,, UNTIL<br />
THE NECESSARY SPENDING CUTS HAVE BEEN MADE MR FRASER<br />
COULD NOT RESPONSIBLY INTRODUCE HIS TAX CUTS, FOR TO<br />
DO SO WOULD BE TO RUN THE RISK OF EXPANDING THE DEFICIT,<br />
AND MR FRASER RECOGNISES THAT THE DEFICIT MUST, IF<br />
ANYTHING, BE REDUCED," </p>
<p>64<br />
IN OTHER WORDS, THE OPPOSITION'S REMEDIES<br />
JUST DON'T MAKE SENSEx THEY IGNORE REALITIESx THEY<br />
CONCEAL THEIR TRUE PURPOSESx OUR BUDGET IS THE ONLY<br />
SERIOUS AND PRACTICAL WAY TO TACKLE INFLA'TION, ONLY BY<br />
TACKLING INFLATION CAN WE REDUCE UNEMPLOYMENT. ONLY BY<br />
TACKLING INFLATION CAN WE BOOST BUSINESS CONFIDENCE AND<br />
GET INDUSTRIES TO INVEST IN MORE PLANT AND MORE JOBSA<br />
THE FIGHT AGAINST INFLATION MUST COME FIRST, MR FRASER'S<br />
ANSWER TO INFLATION IS TO PROMISE INDEXATION OF TAXESX<br />
THAT IS, HE WANTS TO GEAR TAXES TO INFLATION,, THAT'S<br />
NOT A REMEDY FOR INFLATION; IT'S A WAY OF SAYING THAT<br />
INFLATION IS INEVITABLE, THAT WE SHOULD BUILD IT INTO THE<br />
SYSTEM) THAT WON'T GIVE MUCH CONFIDENCE TO THE BUSINESS<br />
COMMUNITYX IF I WERE A BUSINESSMAN I'D RATHER HAVE A<br />
GOVERNMENT PREPARED TO TACKLE INFLATION THAN A GOVERNMENT<br />
THAT SIMPLY ACCEPTS IT AND TRIES TO CONCEAL ITS EFFECTSA<br />
IN THE LONG TERM THERE IS A CASE FOR TAX INDEXATION AND WE<br />
CERTAINLY HAVEN T RULED IT OUT, BUT IT S A VERY POOR<br />
SUBSTITUTE FOR GENUINE TAX REFORM, IT DOESN'T CHANGE<br />
THE EXISTING TAX SCALES, IT DOESN'T GIVE TAX RELIEF TO<br />
THOSE WHO NEED ITx </p>
<p>IT'S AN INTERESTING COINCIDENCE THAT OUR<br />
TAX REFORMS THE GREAT AND ENDURING THEME OF OUR BUDGET*-<br />
HAVE COME AT A TIME WHEN THE GOVERNMENT IS COMPLETIN G ITS<br />
FIRST 1000 DAYS IN OFFICE,, THOS. E 1000 DAYS CERTAINLY<br />
HAVEN'IT BEEN EASY,
ECONOMIC RECESSION, WHEN UNEMPLOYMENT IN EVERY COMPARABLE<br />
COUNTRY HAS REACHED ITS HIGHEST LEVEL SINCE THE DEPRESSIONX<br />
WE'VE HAD TO CONTEND WITH A WORLDWIDE UPSUR GE OF INFLATIONx<br />
WE'VE HAD TO CONTEND WITH WILFUL OBSTRUCTION OF OUR POLICIES<br />
IN THE SENATE AND BY THE STATES. YET DESPITE ALL THIS WE<br />
HAVE MANAGED TO HOLD OUR OWN,. THE RECESSION. IN AUSTRALIA<br />
HAS BEEN MUCH LESS SEVERE THAN IT HAS BEEN IN OTHER<br />
COUNTRIESx AND THROUGH ALL THIS WE HAVE BROUGHT INREFORMS<br />
AND ACHIEVEMENTS OF LASTING BENEFIT TO ALL<br />
AUSTRALIANS., WE HAVE WIDENED THE EDUCATIONAL HORIZONS OF<br />
EM ERY AUSTRALIAN CHILD, WE HAVE FREE UNIVERSITIES, WE HAVE<br />
INTRODUCED MEDIBANK AND THE LEGAL AID SERVICE, WE HAVE LAID<br />
THE FOUNDATIONS FOR BETTER TRANSPORT AND HOUSING AND DECENT<br />
CITIES, WE HAVE GIVEN A NEW DEAL TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND<br />
BROUGHT NEW AND PERMANENT STANDARDS OF SOCIAL WELFARE AND<br />
SECURITY. WE HAVE ABOLISHED CONSCRIPTION AND ENDED OUR<br />
TRAGIC INVOLVEMENT IN VIETNAM,, WE HAVE REVITALIZED THE ARTSx<br />
WE HAVE BROUGHT NEW HOPE TO THE ABORIGINES, THE MIGRANI'S<br />
THE UNDERPRIVILEGED IN THE COMMUNITY&gt;, AND NOW, WITH OUR<br />
LATEST BUDGET, WE HAVE BROU GHT RADICAL REFORM TO THE<br />
TAXATION SYSTEM x THOSE 1000 DAYS HAVE BEEN STRENUOUS AND<br />
DIFFICULT AND SOMETIMES PAINFUL BUT LOOKING BACK, THEY'IVE<br />
BEEN WELL WORTH ITA </p>
