PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA WEDNESDAY, 4 FEBRUARY, 1981<br />
EXPOSITION PROPOSAL FOR 1988<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr. Malcolm Fraser, and the Premier of<br />
*. New South Wales, Mr. Neville Wran, today announced that their<br />
two Governments had completed the examination of proposals<br />
to stage a Modified Universal Exposition in Sydney as part<br />
of the Bicentenary celebrations.%<br />
Mr. Fraser and Mr. Wran stated that a great deal of thought<br />
and initiative had been devoted by the Australian Bicentennial<br />
Authority to the development of plans for the Exposition and<br />
they wished to place on record their appreciation of these<br />
efforts.-However, it was clear that a very substantial capital<br />
outlay which could be up to*$ 1,000 million, would be required<br />
to ensure t-he successful staging of the Exposition. The<br />
Governments had reluctantly concluded that it was impractical Eor<br />
them to agree to make the necessary funds available, being<br />
conscious of their heavy commitments for basic infrastructure<br />
in support of industry and services such as hospitals and schools.<br />
The two Governments were determined, however, that Australia's<br />
Bicentenary should be celebrated in a manner fitting to such a<br />
significant event. They would therefore co-operate to the<br />
maximum in arrangements to achieve this objective and give<br />
recognition to the historic role of Sydney in such celebrations.<br />
For its part the Commonwealth Government would also be asking the<br />
Australian Bicentennial Authority to put before it options for<br />
activities to take place in all States in 1988 on a scale smaller<br />
th-an that envisaged for the. Exposition.<br />
The-Prime Minister indicated that he would propose to list these<br />
for consideration at the next Premier's Conference.<br />
