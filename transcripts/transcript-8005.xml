PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 20 APRIL 1990<br />
The Government is concerned at the actions of the Soviet<br />
authorities in cutting essential supplies to Lithuania.<br />
These actions are inconsistent with what in fact is urgently<br />
needed now a genuine dialogue between Moscow and Vilnius<br />
aimed at achieving a negotiated settlement in an atmosphere<br />
free of tension.<br />
I have written to President Gorbachev expressing our concern<br />
and urging the Soviet Government to take early steps towards<br />
a negotiated settlement on this issue. I am hopeful that<br />
his policy of perestroika, which has resulted in so many<br />
positive changes in just a few years on the international<br />
stage, will also influence the Soviet Government's actions<br />
in this matter and prevent an already delicate situation<br />
from deteriorating. Clearly, it carries potentially serious<br />
consequences for the improving international climate.<br />
Australia has already recognised for many years the legal<br />
right of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia to exist as<br />
independent States. Like many other Western Governments, we<br />
have refused to accept in international law the<br />
incorporation of the three Baltic States into the Soviet<br />
Union in 1940.<br />
It is the Government's earnest hope that this issue can be<br />
handled peacefully, with sensitivity, and with respect for<br />
human rights. 1; 8 13<br />
