PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCE, SHANGRI-LA HOTEL, KUALA<br />
LUMPUR, 22 OCTOBER 1989<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, what's your response to the CHOGM<br />
declaration on South Africa? Are you happy with the with<br />
the way it worked out?<br />
PM: Yes, the declaration has embraced the five point plan<br />
that I proposed at the meeting here, it's been embraced. I<br />
think we now have a basis on which the Commonwealth, we can<br />
proceed to build upon the combination of external and<br />
internal pressures that have developed to give some evidence<br />
now of change, the beginnings of change in South Africa.<br />
JOURNALIST: The fact that Margaret Thatcher, the leader of<br />
the biggest and most influential nation, wouldn't support the<br />
thrust of your package, doesn't that in a very significant<br />
way damage its effectiveness?<br />
PM: No, I don't believe so. of course if you read the<br />
declaration you'll find that what the British Government has<br />
done is to associate themselves with most of the declaration<br />
but particular paragraphs in which they indicate they can't<br />
accept. But significantly there's no dissent from the<br />
British Government on that important part of the declaration<br />
which calls on the rest of the world to apply the existing<br />
sanctions that are being applied. Now I regard that as a<br />
very significant development.<br />
JOURNALIST: is it a softening of the line?<br />
PM: By the British?<br />
JOURNALIST: Yes.<br />
PM: Well it's not for me to insert what the British<br />
Government are doing in terms of hardening or softening. I<br />
mean you would need those questions of Mrs Thatcher. But I<br />
don't want to be carping about Mrs Thatcher because I think<br />
she found herself in a difficult position in that the rest of<br />
the Commonwealth countries have a unanimous position, she has<br />
differences of emphasis in regard to certain matters, </p>
<p>-2-<br />
( PM cont) including particularly the force of sanctions.<br />
But I think that Mrs Thatcher attempted to be as cooperative<br />
as she could be given the position that she's got and<br />
certainly with the statement that has come out of Langkawi we<br />
do have a position I think of very considerable strength.<br />
JOURNALIST: Has Mrs Thatcher finally acknowledged that<br />
sanctions are doing the job?<br />
PM: Well it's very difficult for anyone, whether it's Mrs<br />
Thatcher or not, to take any other position when the leading<br />
officials within South Africa, both of Government, the<br />
Minister for Finance and the late Governor of the Reserve<br />
Bank have themselves asserted two things that I said at the<br />
press conference here before, the two things that are<br />
important. One, that sanctions are having a very significant<br />
effect of constraint upon economic growth in South Africa;<br />
and secondly, associated with that acknowledgement, the<br />
statement that those things will continue until such time as<br />
they get their political act right. Now when leading South<br />
African figures are saying that, it doesn't come easily for<br />
anyone else to deny those facts.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is there an assumption in the statement that if<br />
South Africa doesn't do anything in the next six months that<br />
the Commonwealth will impose some sort of tougher sanctions?<br />
PM: I think you read it for what it says. That is that I<br />
think as a Commonwealth we have been proper in acknowledging<br />
that with the election of President de Kierk there has been<br />
some indications of change. We have not been taken in by<br />
those changes to say that the end of apartheid is in sight<br />
but we have, I think, responsibly said that it makes sense to<br />
give some period of time to see whether those embryonic<br />
changes are fleshed out into more significant moves. That's<br />
why I said in my intervention here before we left Kuala<br />
Lumpur that it seemed to me that it would be appropriate for<br />
the Committee of Foreign Minister to meet about April. That<br />
position has been embraced within the Langkawi declaration on<br />
South Africa. Now that will mean that in that period of six<br />
months we can see whether, as I put it before, the executive<br />
decisions are taken which are capable of being taken before<br />
the Parliament meets. Now we're taking, as it were, a<br />
positive and optimistic view that some of these changes will<br />
take place and so that if that were the case you wouldn't<br />
need to be considering whether in fact you can put more<br />
pressure on. I think the Commonwealth has expressed the view<br />
that it's going to position itself to consider that<br />
possibility if it's necessary and speaking for myself and I<br />
guess my opinion is significant in that it's our<br />
proposals that have formed the foundation of the </p>
<p>-3-<br />
( PM cant) Commonwealth's statement on South Africa I think<br />
that it is important that we give an indication of hope and<br />
take a positive approach that these changes will occur. Let<br />
me say this: that you would appreciate that I've had now<br />
lengthy discussions here and at the Retreat with the leaders<br />
of the frontline African States and I can say that it is<br />
their hope too that these positive changes that we've already<br />
seen will grow and develop so that there is no need to<br />
consider a strengthening of action. Indeed, it's the hope of<br />
all of us that we could reach a position where sanctions<br />
could be eased because you'll recall the language I've used<br />
that we've never wanted sanctions f or the sake of sanctions,<br />
the phrase I have used, and which has recommended itself to<br />
my colleagues in the Commonwealth is that sanctions are to<br />
bring South Africa not to it's knees but to the negotiating<br />
table. JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, if can I just ask one question.<br />
Mrs Thatcher says that the impact of sanctions has not<br />
influenced the policies of the South African regime. If it<br />
hasn't been sanctions, what's it been?<br />
PM: I don't accept that analysis. Obviously from what I've<br />
said before and when you have the statement of de Plessis,<br />
the Finance Minister and de Kock, the late Governor of the<br />
Reserve Bank, saying that there must be changes because of<br />
the economic pressures and when you see on the eve of the<br />
Commonwealth meeting the release of these prisoners, then<br />
it, in my respectful observation, it defies any logic to say<br />
that sanctions haven't had their effect, they obviously have.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, they've endorsed your proposal for an<br />
independent agency to monitor financial links and Australia's<br />
putting up some money. Could you say how much and what form<br />
that agency will take?<br />
PM: No, I can't say how much we will put up. The amount<br />
that Australia I don't think we'll have to put it all up<br />
there will be support from others. But we have taken the<br />
lead in this area of financial sanctions. As you'll1<br />
appreciate it's appropriate that we should give a lead, we<br />
will, and what we will now have is further discussions with<br />
our own people and others in the commonwealth to see what<br />
particular institution that exists within the Commonwealth<br />
and in an appropriate centre where there is access to<br />
relevant lines of financial information, where it will be<br />
best situated. We don't have any because it's our idea<br />
we're not saying where it should be. I would want it to be<br />
in a place where it can be most effective. </p>
<p>-4-<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, you've also said that it's a<br />
significant development that Mrs Thatcher is at last<br />
recognising existing sanctions. Why do you think she's made<br />
this? PM: Look I've not at any stage tried to put myself in the<br />
mind of and to speak for Mrs Thatcher, it would be<br />
presumptious of me to do that. To the extent that it's<br />
appropriate for me to make some observations about the effect<br />
of anything she's said or done, I think that that's fair<br />
enough. But I don't want to put myself in Margaret<br />
Thatcher's mind. I think if you've got questions as to what<br />
she's thinking it's appropriate if you can to ask her.<br />
JOURNALIST: Did Mrs Thatcher give any indication to the<br />
Comonwealth leaders today that she'd be issuing her own<br />
statement on South Africa which she's done tonight?<br />
PM: No, there was no indication that that would be done.<br />
But I don't think she had any obligation to<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you think this weakens the force of the<br />
unanimous PM: No, not at all. I mean if you have a position where in<br />
the document that was accepted at Langkawi, if there is an<br />
indication in that that the British Government reserves its<br />
position on certain of the paragraphs as is done, well that's<br />
fair enough that the Leader of the British Government should<br />
indicate their position in that respect. And no-one can<br />
argue with that.<br />
JOURNALIST: the environmental statement, there's a<br />
paragraph in there that says that they don't want to tie aid<br />
and trade to environmental conditions. Where does this leave<br />
Australia's environmental statement?<br />
PM: In no different position from where we are. Let me<br />
just quote you the actual wording of the statement on that,<br />
if I could just see it, I mean I don't want to get in your<br />
way in all. But it says that we've agreed to strengthen and<br />
support the development of international funding mechanisms<br />
and appropriate decision making procedures to respond to<br />
environmental protection needs which will include assisting<br />
developing countries to obtain access to and transfer of<br />
needed environmental technologies and which would take<br />
account of proposals for international environmental<br />
protection funds. So that point deals with the concept of<br />
general assistance. But then specifically on the question of<br />
the relationship between development and environmental<br />
concerns, specifically this is what it has to say and there's </p>
<p>( PM cont) two parts to it which you need to understand<br />
to respond to your question: " sustainable development implies<br />
the incorporation of environmental concerns into economic<br />
planning and policies." I mean there's the recognition of<br />
the relationship between sustainable development and the<br />
incorporation of environmental concerns. But they then say:<br />
" environmental concerns should not be used to introduce a new<br />
form of conditionality in aid and development and financing."<br />
Now we're in a position where in the past we have in our<br />
developmental programs incorporated our concern for<br />
environmental issues. So what we've done in the past is<br />
totally consistent with what's contained in the declaration.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, on the developments on Antarctica over<br />
the weekend, the release from Paris called it a Land of<br />
Science rather than a World Wilderness Park. Is there any<br />
significance in that?<br />
PM: Get your question right. It combined the two. It<br />
referred to Wilderness Land of Science.<br />
JOURNALIST: inaudible<br />
PM: Well, you want to get your information right.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, was there any discussion at the<br />
Retreat about Cambodia and the impending problems there? Do<br />
you think it's an issue the Commonwealth should deal with?<br />
PM: No, not specifically. You'll recall that the world<br />
political situation was the subject of the first day's<br />
discussion here in KL and it didn't specifically come up in<br />
the two major Retreat sessions, which were predominantly<br />
concerned with the environment, with South Africa and with<br />
the role of the Commonwealth in examining the question of<br />
looking to the next decade, as it were what are the<br />
emphases that the Commonwealth will need to take into account<br />
and in turn what may that involve for the actual shaping and<br />
staffing and servicing by the Secretariat. Those were the<br />
major issues that were discussed up there. But of course one<br />
of the great virtues of the Retreat is that it enables a lot<br />
of informal discussion and I can say that Cambodia was one of<br />
the matters that I did discuss with some of the leaders<br />
there. JOURNALIST: Do you expect Hong Kong to be raised in the next<br />
couple of days, Mr Hawke? </p>
<p>-6-<br />
PM: Well again, in the first day's discussion on the world<br />
political scene, Hong Kong was mentioned and again, I've had<br />
some bilateral discussions on that with Mrs Thatcher.<br />
Whether that will come up again now, I doubt it. This is the<br />
sort of thing that you're able to discuss very usefully<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you able to say what you discussed with her?<br />
PM: Just briefly to say that we recognise the pressures that<br />
have been created for Hong Kong by the events of June 4 and<br />
the need for confidence to be given to Hong Kong. And that's<br />
a position that we both share.<br />
JOURNALIST: Did Mr Namaliu make any specific requests of you<br />
with respect to the situation in Bougainville?<br />
-PM: No, I'm having an extensive bilateral with him in the<br />
morning. I'm meeting with him at 7.30 in the morning.<br />
JOURNALIST: Sonny Ramphal said it was the clearest<br />
and strongest statement on South Africa that has ever come<br />
from the Commonwealth. Do you agree with that?<br />
PM: I suppose, summoning all the modesty I can, I think<br />
that's not a bad statement.<br />
JOURNALIST: What happened in the big showdown on the golf?<br />
PM: I thought you were never going to ask.<br />
JOURNALIST: inaudible<br />
PM: No, no wait a minute, wait a minute. A very important<br />
question has been asked here, what happened in the golf.<br />
Australia beat New Zealand.<br />
ends </p>
