    <content><![CDATA[<p>Today, Australia has lost an icon.</p>
<p>Richie Benaud OBE was part of all our lives.</p>
<p>To most Australians Richie Benaud was cricket.Â  He personified its traditions and its values.</p>
<p>While many Australians only know Richard Benaud as the voice of cricket, we should not forget that in his day he was a cricketer with few equals.Â  It was why he was so insightful as a commentator.</p>
<p>As a player his record has withstood the test of time.Â  He led the Australian side from 1958/59 through to 1963/1964, never losing a series in his 28 Tests as captain.</p>
<p>As captain, he was first to lead a full Australian tour to India and Pakistan in 1959/60.</p>
<p>He was the first cricketer to reach a Test double of 2,000 runs and 200 wickets.</p>
<p>Given the special place Richie Benaud has in our national life, I have asked that on the day of his funeral flags fly at half-mast.</p>
<p>I extend my condolences and the condolences of the Australian people, to his wife Daphne and his family and friends.</p>
