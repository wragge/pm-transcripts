PM I41/ 962<br />
PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT OF NORTH : EST ' USTRALIA<br />
Staemnt bAcn Prime initr Rt. Hon. John McEwen M. P.<br />
I conferred today in company with the Treasurer, Mr.<br />
Holt, and the Minister for National Development, Senator Spooner<br />
with the Premier of Western Australia, Mr. Brand and the Minister<br />
for the North West, Mr. Court. They put before us various<br />
proposals related to the farther development of the north of<br />
Jestern Australia. It will be recalled that in the speech delivered by the<br />
Governor-General on the occasion of the Opening of Parliament in<br />
February of this year, it was stated on behalf of the Commonwealth<br />
Government that we believe in the development of the north of<br />
Australia, a development which we regard as cssential. We<br />
reaffirmed our determination to continue our efforts in that<br />
field, pointed to assistance already given to basic public<br />
works in the north of Australia. Those include, in the case of<br />
Jestern Australia, the Ord River Scheme and the programme of beef<br />
roads. 4e referred also to the important research work being<br />
conducted through the Bureau of Miineral Resources, the Commonwealth<br />
Scientific and Industrial Research Organization and the Bureau of<br />
Agricultural Economics. said at that time that we would<br />
continue economic and scientific research and survey work with a<br />
view to the production of developmental plans. We recognized that<br />
in these matters the co-operation of the State Governments would<br />
be essential and this would be sought. The present talks are in<br />
accordance with this general statomont of policy.<br />
The proposals put before us by the Premier and Mr. Court<br />
offer, in their judgment, good economic prospects and would<br />
contribute to the strength of the Australian economy either by way<br />
of increased export income earnings or by the replacement of<br />
certain current imports, do have agreed to study these matters<br />
closely with appropriate Commonwealth officers and will arrange,<br />
where that appears desirable, for consultation to take place<br />
between officers of the Cormmonialth Government and the . Jestern<br />
Australian Govrnment. Some of the matters would involve<br />
budgetary provision by the Commonwealth Government and these will<br />
be given appropriate Cabinet consideration.<br />
