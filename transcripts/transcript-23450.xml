    <content><![CDATA[<p>In a little over two weeks, the Treasurer will hand down the Budget.</p>
<p>Itâs the first Budget for this Government and it is part of our Economic Action Strategy.</p>
<p>It will be a Budget of long-term structural reform and it will be a Budget that keeps our commitments.</p>
<p>The Government will make a range of decisions which are important for Australia's long-term economic strength, because the most fundamental commitment that we gave at the election was to build a strong and prosperous economy for a safe and secure Australia.</p>
<p>In this Budget, we will strengthen the economy so that families have more jobs, lower power bills and overtime more opportunities to get ahead.</p>
<p>The abolition of the carbon tax will save the typical family $550 a year.</p>
<p>The Budget will also deal with Laborâs legacy of debt and deficit, stretching out as far as the eye can see.</p>
<p>Under the previous government, Australia ran up the five largest deficits in our history.Â  They also left a projected $123 billion in future deficits and $667 billion in accumulated debt.</p>
<p>Already the interest bill on Laborâs debt is more than $10 billion each and every year.Â  Thatâs dead money.Â  Wasted money.Â  Itâs money that could be better used on services and helping families and pensioners to get ahead.</p>
<p>This Government understands that you canât fix the economy without fixing the Budget.Â  Equally, we understand that when you strengthen the economy, you strengthen the Budget.</p>
<p>So this Budget will regain control of our nationâs finances â so that all Australians can have confidence in their economic future.</p>
