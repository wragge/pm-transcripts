PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT PRESS CONFERENCE JAPAN NATIONAL PRESS<br />
CLUB, 2 FEBRUARY 1984<br />
E AND 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
PM: THANK YOU. I WANT TO SAY THAT AT THE OUTSET THAT I' M<br />
EXTRAORDINARILY PLEASED WITH THE OUTCOME SO FAR OF MY FIRST<br />
VISIT TO JAPAN AS PRIME MINISTER OF AUSTRALIA. ! T'S ENABLED<br />
ME TO ESTABLISH THE GOOD PERSONAL RELATIONS AND THE RAPPORT WITH<br />
YOUR PRIME MINISTER NAKASONE. AND IN THOSE DISCUSSIONS I HAVE BEEN<br />
ENCOURAGED BY THE CLOSE IDENTITY OF VIEWS BETWEEN US ON A RANGE OF<br />
GLOBAL AND REGIONAL AND POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC<br />
ISSUES. IT'S PROVIDED ME AN OPPORTUNITY TO MEET OTHER SENIOR<br />
JAPANESE MINISTERS, INCLUDING THE DIRECTOR-GENERAL OF THE ECONOMIC<br />
PLANNING AGENCY AND THE MINISTER FOR FINANCE, AND THE FORMER FOREIGN<br />
MINISTER DR OKITA.<br />
IN THOSE MEETINGS IT HAS BEEN POSSIBLE TO HAVE SOME VERY FRANK AND<br />
DIRECT EXCHANGES WITH THE TOP ECHELON OF JAPANESE BU . SINESS<br />
AND INDUSTRY, PARTICULARLY FOLLOWING MY LUNCHEON MEETING YESTERDAY<br />
WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF THE FIVE JAPANESE ECONOMIC<br />
ORGANISATIONS AND LATER THIS AFTERNOON I WILL BE MEETING WITH LEADING<br />
JAPANESE BANKERS.<br />
MORE SPECIFICALLY, THE JOINT STATEMENT ISSUED BY PRIME MINISTER<br />
NAKASONE AND I FOLLOWING OUR MEETING YESTERDAY MORNING UNDERLINES<br />
OUR COMMON COMMITMENTS AND UNDERTAKINGS ON GLOBAL AND REGIONAL<br />
AND ECONOMIC ISSUES AND~ qN SPECIFICALLY BILATERAL ISSUES.<br />
AND I WANT TO SAY THAT THE WARMTH OF THE PRIME MINISTER's<br />
WELCOME AND INDEED THAT OF HIS GOVERNMENT IS VERY MUCH APPRECIATED<br />
BY MYSELF ON BEHLF OF ALL AUSTRALIANS, AND WE LOOK FORWARD<br />
TO WELCOMING PRIME MINISTER NAKASONE TO AUSTRALIA IN MID-1984.<br />
OUR TWO COUNTRIES SHARE A COMMON COMMITMENT TO WORKING FOR GLOBAL<br />
DISARMAMENT, AND FOR ENSURING THAT NUCLEAR WEAPONS ARE NOT<br />
REDEPLOYED TO NORTH ASIA. IN OTHER WORDS WE HAVE A COMMON INTEREST<br />
IN SEEING THAT ANY DISCUSSIONS IN THE INF CONTEXT TO RESOLVE THE<br />
EUROPEAN CONCERN ABOUT THE BUILD-UP OF WEAPONS THERE IS NOT<br />
SATISFIED AS FAR AS THE SOVIET SIDE IS CONCERNED BY THE<br />
REDEPLOYMENT OF W4EAPONS FROM THAT AREA TO THE SOVIET FAR EAST.<br />
AND WE HAVE AGREED THAT IN THIS AREA, SPECIFICALLY AS WELL AS<br />
OTHER SPECIFIC GLOBAL AND REGIONAL ISSUES SUCH AS, FOR EXAMPLE,<br />
KAMPUCHEA AND THE MIDDLE EAST, THAT AUSTRALIA AND JAPAN SHOULD WORK<br />
MORE CLOSELY TOGETHER THAN IN THfE PAST. WE HAVE MANY COMMON<br />
INTERESTS AND IT IS AGREED THAT IT IS IMPORTANT TIIAT WE<br />
REVITALISE THE RELATIONSHIP IN THE POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC AREAS. </p>
<p>THE DISCUSSIONS THAT I HAVE HAD WITH SENIOR GOVERNMENT<br />
ECONOMIC MINISTERS AND INDUSTRY AND BUSINESS LEADERS HAS ENABLED ME<br />
TO STRESS THAT AUSTRALIA WOULD BE VERY CONCERNED IF IN AREAS IN<br />
WHICH THE GOVERNMENT HAS DIRECT INFLUENCE, SUCHl AS IN THE AREA OF<br />
BEEF QUOTAS, THE AUSTRALIAN MARKET SHARE WAS TO BE ERODED IN THIS<br />
COUNTRY BY ANY NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN JAPAN AND THIRD COUNTRIES.<br />
SIMILARLY, I HAVE STRESSED THAT IN AREAS SUCH A SIRON ORE AND COAL<br />
EXPORTS WE WISH ONLY TO BE GIVEN, AS WE PUT IT IN AUSTRALIA,<br />
A ' FAIR PARTICULARLY AT A TIME THAT JAPANESE LEADERS ARE<br />
ENCOURAGED BY OUR IMPROVING INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS RECORD IN AUSTRALIh.<br />
AND I WANT TO SAY THAT I WAS SATISFIED W4ITH THE HEARIN4G THAT I HAD<br />
ON THESE MATTERS, AND WE WILL BE VERY CLOSELY MONITORING DEVELOPMENTS<br />
IN THOSE AREAS.<br />
THE MAIN COMPONENT OF AUSTRALIA'S EXPORTS TO JAPAN WILL OBVIOUSLY<br />
CONTINUE TO BE IN PRIMARY PRODUCTS, INCLUDING MINERALS.<br />
BUT AT THIS POINT WHEN CLEARLY THERE ARE IMPORTANT STRUCTURAL CH4ANGES<br />
TAKING PLACE IN BOTH OUR ECONOMIES, IT'S IMPORTANT THAT AUSTRALIA<br />
SHOULD BE AGRESSIVE IN EXPLOITING NEW MARKET CPPORTUNITIES IN THIS<br />
COUNTRY FOR MANUFACTURED GOODS AND SERVICES. AND IN THIS RESPECT<br />
I AM VERY PLEASED WITH DEVELPMENTS THAT HAVE OCCURRED OUT OF THE<br />
DISCUSSIONS THAT I'VE HAD HERE. IN RESPONSE TO SUGGESTIONS FROM<br />
( INAUDIBLE) WE WILL BE HAVING AN AUSTRALIAN EXPORT MISSION TO JAPAN<br />
WITHIN A COUPLE OF MONTHS. AND THERE WAS A POSITIVE RESPONSE TO MY<br />
SUGGESTION THAT AS THERE ARE JAPANESE EIIPORT EXPANSION MISSIONS TO<br />
THE UNITED STATES, AND TO THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY, I<br />
SUGGESTED THAT THERE SHOULD BE SUCH A MISSION TO AUSTRALIA AND THERE<br />
HAS, AS I SAY, BEEN A POSITIVIE RESPONSE TO THAT. SO THOSE TWO<br />
THINGS, I BELIEVE, WILL CONCRETELY START TO GIVE EFFECT TO OUR<br />
COMMITMENT TO BE LOOKING FOR NEW MARKET OPPORTUNITIES. AND IN<br />
ADDITION TO THAT WE WILL BE UNDERTAKING JOINT MARKET RESEARCH.<br />
I HAVE BEEN ENCOURAGED BY THE COMMON VIEW THAT PRIME MINISTER<br />
NAKASONE AND I HAVE ON THE NEED FOR A MORE OPEN MULTILATERAL TRADING<br />
SYSTEM, AND PARTICULARLY ON THE NEED FOR A NEW MTN ROUND, AND I WILL<br />
BE PUR SUING THESE DISCUSSIONS IN THE OTHER ASIAN CAPITALS WHICH I'LL<br />
BE VISITING WITH A VIEW fO TRYING TO PREPARE THAT DEGREE COMMONALITY<br />
THAT WE CAN ACHIEVE FROM THE COUNTRIES OF THE REGION IN RESPECT OF<br />
SUCH A ROUND. WE BOTH ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IN THE PAST THERE HAS BEEN AN<br />
EXCLUSION OF COMMODITIES OF INTEREST TO OUR COUNTRIES AND OTHER<br />
COUNTRIES IN THE REGION. AND GIVEN THE SUBSTANCE OF THE ECONOMIES OF<br />
OUR COUNTRIES IN THE REGION IT IS APPROPRIATE THAT WE TRY AND<br />
ACHIEVE AS FAR AS POSSIBLE A COMMON REGIONAL POSITION IN PREPARATION<br />
FOR SUCH A POSSIBLE NEW ROUND.<br />
I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT I HAVE WELCOMED THE VERY SUPPORTIVE REACTION<br />
OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR IN JAPAN TO MY GOVERNMENT'S ECONOMIC<br />
POLICIES, PARTICULARLY THEY HAVE WELCOMED THE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT<br />
IN THE INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS SITUATION IN AUSTRAL. IA, RESULTING FROM<br />
THE PRICES AND INCOMES ACCORDv AND AS WELL THEY HAVE APPRECIATED<br />
OUR APPROACH TO MACRO-ECONOMIC POLICIES GENERALLY AND TO FOREIGN<br />
INDUSTRY AND INDUSTRY POLICY. </p>
<p>FINALLY MIGHT I SAY THAT THE QUESTION OF INDUSTRY POLICY WILL BE<br />
THE SUBJECT OF A MAJOR SPEECH THAT I-LL BE MAKING IN OSAKA TOMORROW<br />
AND I SIMPLY CONFINE MYSELF HERE TO SAY TH4AT WHILE THE JAPANESE MODEL<br />
CLEARLY IS NOT CAPABLE OF TOTAL TRANSLATION INTO AUSTRALIA IT DOES<br />
HAVE MUCH IN CONSENSUS BUILDING WITHIN OUR COMMUNITY, A CONSENSUS<br />
WHICH I REGARD AS ESSENTIAL TO THE STRUCTURAL ADJUST11ENTS THAT<br />
WILL HAVE TO TAKE PLACE IN AUSTRALIA IF WE ARE GOING TO BE ABLE<br />
AS A NATION TO BENEFIT FROM BEING PART OF THIS DYNAMIC GROWTH REGION,<br />
RATHER THAN TO DECLINE RELATIVELY IN LIVING STANDARDS TO OTHER<br />
INDUSTRIALISED COUNTRIES OF OUR REGION.<br />
JOURNALIST THE JOINT PRESS STATEMENT THAT WAS ISSUED<br />
YESTERDAY IT WAS STRESSED THAT IT IS OBVIOUS THAT THE ASIAN PACIFIC<br />
REGION IS GOING TO BE THE MOST DYNAMIC AREA OF THE WORLD<br />
IN THE 21ST CENTURY. AMBASSADOR MANSFIELD OF THE UNITED STATES<br />
ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF AGO STRESSED AT THIS PRESS CLUB THAT THE<br />
21ST CENTRURY IS GOING TO BE THE AREA OF THE PACIFIC. THE FORMER<br />
AND LATE PRIME MINISTER OHIRA HAD A VISION OR CONCEPT OF<br />
PAN-PACIFIC SOLIDARITY AND PROFESSOR ( INAUDIBLE) A POSSIBILITY OF<br />
ESTABLISHING PACIFIC TRADE AND DEVELOPMENT ORGANISATIONS. MY<br />
QUESTION TO PRIME MINISTER HAWKE IS THE FOLLOWING. DO YOU INTEND TO<br />
TAKE IMAGINATIVE INITIATIVES IN THIS REGARD?<br />
PM: WELL I DON'T KNOW WHETHER I WOULD DESCRIBE OUR APPROACHES<br />
AS IMAGINATIVE INITIATIVES. THAT'S WHAT YOU PEOPLE GET SO WILL<br />
PAID FOR, TO DESCRIBE WHAT WE HUMBLE POLTICIANS DO. BUT<br />
LET ME PUT THESE POINTS. FIRSTLY, WE DON'T HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL THE<br />
21ST CENTURY TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE AREA TO WHICH YOU REFER<br />
WILL BE THE FASTEST AND MOST DYNAMIC GROWING AREA OF THE WORLD.<br />
IT ALREADY IS. AND THEREFORE WE ARE AS A GOVERNMENT MAKING<br />
DECISIONS NOW WHICH WE THINK ARE RELEVANT TO THAT FACT. WE HAVE<br />
NO REASON TO BELIEVE THAT IT WILL BE ANY DIFFERENT IN THE 21ST<br />
CENTURY. THE SORTS OF THINGS THAT WE ARE CONCERNED TO DO ARE<br />
AS FOLLOWS. FIRSTLY, TO ESTABLISH GOOD RELATIONS, IN THE<br />
POLITICAL SENSE, WITH THE COUNTRIES OF THE REGION BECAUSE IT<br />
IS MY VIEW AND OF MY GOVERNMENT THAT AUSTRALIA IS INEXTRICABLY<br />
AND FOREVER A PART OF TRTE REGION. WE ARE NOT SOME EUROPEAN<br />
OUPOST ON THE RIM. WE ARE PART OF THE REGION. SO THE INITIATIVES,<br />
IF YOU LIKE, FIRSTLY ARE TO ESTABLISH CORDIAL RELATIONS WITH THE<br />
GOVERNMENT OF THE AREA. SECONDLY, IT IS NO GOOD JUST BEING<br />
FRIENDS AND BEING ABLE TO SAY HOW DO YOU DO IN A CHUMMY FASHION.<br />
WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE DECISIONS THAT WE TAKE IN THE AREA<br />
OF TRADING RELATIONS AND SPECIFICALLY IN OUR STRUCTURAL POSITION<br />
IN AUSTRALIA ENABLE US AS I HAVE PUT IT BEFORE TO ENMESH<br />
AUSTRALIA INTO THAT DYNAMIC GROWING ECONOMY. IF WE DON'T DO THAT<br />
WE ARE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET EITHER THE BENEFIT FROM<br />
THAT GROWTH OF THE REGION OR TO MAKE SOME CONTRIBUTION TO IT.<br />
THIRDLY, AND INITIATIVE THAT I HAVE TAKEN WHICH WAS FIRST<br />
REFERRED TO EXPLICITILY IN BANGKOK IN NOVEMBER WAS TO SUGGEST<br />
INTERNATIONAL TRADING SYSTEM AND THAT WE WANT THEREFORE TO SEE<br />
A NEW MTN ROUND. AND REALLY IT MEANS THAT FIRST OF ALL THE<br />
COUNTRIES OF THE REGION SHOULD MEET IN ADVANCE TO TRY AND IDENTIFY<br />
THE COMMON INTERESTS THAT WE HAVE. IT WILL BE NO. GOOD HAVING<br />
A NEW MTN ROUND LIKE THE LAST WHICH EXCLLUDED PRODUCTS OF OBVIOUS<br />
INTEREST TO US, LIKE AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS, PROCESSED MINERALS<br />
TO NAME SOME OF INTEREST TO US AND OTHER TYPES OF GOODS OF INTEREST<br />
TO COUNTRIES IN THE REGION WHICH WERE PREVIOUSLY EXCLUDED. SO<br />
WE ARE TAKING AN INITIATIVE WHICH WERE PREVIOUSLY EXCLUDED. SO WE </p>
<p>ARE TAKING AN INITIATIVE IN THAT RESPECT. IN REGARD TO AN<br />
ORGANISATIONAL CONCEPT THAT YOU REFERRED TO IN YOUR QUESTION:<br />
THAT H4AS BEEN FLOATED IF YOU LIKE IN A NUMBER OF QUARTERS. WE<br />
TAKE THIS POSITION IN REGARDS TO SUCH AN ORGANISATIONAL CONCEPT:<br />
WE BELIEVE THAT THE TIME IS NOT READY FOR IT NOW BUT INSOFAR AS<br />
DISCUSSIONS ARE TAKING PLACE, THE MOST RECENT IN BALI AT THE END<br />
OF 1983, WE ARE PREPARED POSITIVELY TO PARTICIPATE IN THESE<br />
DISCUSSIONS, TO HAVE WORKING COMMITTEES LOOIKING AT ASPECT OF THE<br />
CONCEPT. BUT WE DO NOT TAKE THE VIEW THAT ORGANISATIONALLY THE<br />
COUNTRIES OF THE REGION YET WANT TO GO TO THAT STAGE. IT MAY BE<br />
SOMETHING FURTHER DOWN THE TRACK. WHAT IS IMPORTANT NOW FOR<br />
AUSTRALIA, AND I THINK FOR THE REGION, IS THAT WE AS I SAY DO<br />
EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN TO BE PART OF THE REGION IN OUR TRADING<br />
RELATIONSHIPS AND RECIPROCALLY TO MAKE THE ADJUSTMENTS THAT ARE<br />
NEEDED TO BE MADE IN AUSTRALIA, AND TO SEE THAT WE AS A REGION TRY<br />
AND HAVE A COMMON APPROACH TOWARDS A NEW MTN ROUND.<br />
JOURNALIST: PRIME MINISTER, YOU'VE HAD GOOD LUCK OR GOOD<br />
EXPERIENCE WITH THE FREEING UP OF THE AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR AND<br />
YOU'RE GOING TO MEET BANKERS THIS AFTERNOON. YOU'VE HAD TWO<br />
STUDIES COMMISSIONED TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT SHOULD BE DONE<br />
WITH THE BANKING SYSTEM IN AUSTRALIA. WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO<br />
DO AND WHEN DO YOU THINK IT WILL BE DONE?<br />
PM: THE QUESTION REFERS TO THE CAMPBELL COMMITTEE REPORT<br />
WHICH WAS UNDERTAKEN BY THE PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT. WHEN WE CAME<br />
IN WE ASKED A COMMITTEE HEADED BY MARTIN TO REPORT ON THAT<br />
TO US IN THE LIGHT OF GOVERNMENT OBJECTIVES. THAT REPORT HAS<br />
ONLY RECENTLY BEEN RECEIVED BY THE TREASURER, MR KEATING. HE<br />
WILL BE MAKING A SUBMISSION TO THE CABINET SHORTLY AFTER MY<br />
RETURN AND IT WOULDN'T, THEREFORE, BE APPROPRIATE FOR ME IN<br />
ANY DETAIL TO SUGGEST PRECISELY WHAT WOULD HAPPEN. LET ME<br />
HOWEVER, MAKE THESE OBSERVATIONS. FIRSTLY, IN FLOATING THE<br />
DOLLAR YOU WILL BE AWARE THAT WE ALSO AT TH4AT TIME RELAXED A<br />
NUMBER OF CONTROLS THAT HAD BEEN OPERATIVE. THIS WAS INDICATIVE<br />
OF THE VIEW THAT WE THOUGHT WAS IN AUSTRALIA'S BEST FINANCIAL<br />
AND ECONOMIC INTERESTS WHICH WOULD BE SERVED BY SOME FREEING UP<br />
OF THE SYSTEM. AND THAT'S THE FIRST POINT THAT I WOULD MAKE.<br />
THE SECOND IS TO SAY THAT IN THIS AUDIENCE WHAT I HAVE HAD CAUSE<br />
TO SAY RECENTLY IN AUSTRALIA WHEN PEOPLE HAVE RAISED THE SAME<br />
SORT OF QUESTIONS. AND THAT IS TO SAY THAT WITH TH4E GREAT SENSE<br />
OF LABOUR HISTORY THAT WE HAVE IN OUR COUNTRY I FIND IT A LITTLE<br />
BIT DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND WHY OUR PARTY, THE LABOR PARTY IN<br />
AUSTRALIA, SHOULD HAVE ANY DEEP AND ABIDING SENSE OF COMMITMENT. TO<br />
THE EXISTING PRIVATE BANKS IN AUSTRALIA, W4HO DON'T HAVE A GREAT<br />
RECORD OF UNDYING COMMITMENT TO OUR CAUSE. ON THREE OCCASIONS<br />
IN THE PAST TH4E SCULLIN GOVERNMENT, THE CHIFLEY GOVERNMENT<br />
AND THE WHITLAM GOVERNMENT THEY WERE RATH4ER AT THE FOREFRONT<br />
OF THE DEMISE OF THOSE GOVERNMENTS. SO I SIMPLY MAKE THAT POINT<br />
AS A MATTER OF HISTORICAL INTEREST, WHIICH I THINK IS NOT<br />
ALTOGETHER IRRELEVANT TO CURRENT CONSIDERATIONS. FROM THOSE TWO<br />
OBSERVATIONS YOU MAY DRAW A CONCLUSION AS To MY OWN THINKING,<br />
BUT BEING A DEMOCRATIC PRIME MINISTER I, OF COURSE, DON'T MAKE<br />
DECISIONS I AWAIT A CONSIDERATION OF TH4IS MATTER BY OUR<br />
CABINET AND OUR PARTY.<br />
JOURNALIST: PRIME MINISTER, I BELIEVE THE QUESTION OF DUMPING<br />
OF NUCLEAR WASTE IN THE PACIFIC CAME UP IN THE TALKS YESTERDAY.<br />
1W1AT WAS THE EXTENT OF THE UNDERSTANDING SOUGlHI BY MR NAKASONE.<br />
WHAT WAS YOUR RESPONSE AND WAS IS YOUR OPINION OF T1HE WH4OLE<br />
BUSINESS. </p>
<p>PM: PRIME MINISTER NAKASONE DID RAISE THIS ISSUE IN THE<br />
DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN US AND MY RESPONSE WAS IN THESE TERMS.<br />
I SAID THAT AT THE MEETING OF THE SOUTH PACIFIC FORUM COUNTRIES<br />
WHICH WE HOSTED IN AUSTRALIA LAST YEAR, ALL THE COUNTRIES OF<br />
THE FORUM INCLUDING, OF COURSE, AUSTRALIA RAISED THEIR SERIOUS<br />
CONCERN ABOUT PROPOSALS FOR THE DUMPING OF LOW LEVEL NUCLEAR<br />
WASTE BY JAPAN IN THE PACIFIC. AND I INDICATED TO MR NAKASONE<br />
THAT CONCERN THAT WE SHARED WITH THE COUNTRIES OF THE SOUTH<br />
PACIFIC AND I SAID THAT I WELCOMED THE INDICATIONS THAT<br />
JAPAN HAD POSTPONED AT LEAST, AS I UNDERSTOOD IT, UNTIL 1985<br />
ANY SUGGESTION THAT THEY MAY PURSUE THAT COURSE OF ACTION<br />
WHICH HAD BEEN RAISED AS A POSSIBILITY EARLIER. AND FURTHER<br />
THAT I ALSO WELCOMED THE INDICATIONS AVAILABLE THAT JAPAN<br />
WAS PURSING MORE VIGOROUSLY THE POSSIBILITY OF THE STORING<br />
OF SUCH LOW LEVEL WASTE ON LAND RATHER THAN THE DUMPING<br />
AT SEA. I INDICATED TO MR NAKASONE OUR INTEREST THAT THAT<br />
COURSE SHOULD BE FOLLOWED.<br />
JOURNALIST YOU HAVE SAID THAT THE BEEF QUOTA WILL NOT<br />
BE ERODED BY ( INAUDIBLE) INCREASIN THE MARKET. DID YOU MEAN<br />
THAT YOU WANT TO RETAIN THE SAME QUOTA WHICH EXISTED PREVIOUSLY,<br />
OR ARE YOU SAYING THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THE QUOTA EXPANDED<br />
IF THAT IS TO BE EXPANDED WITH THE UNITED STATES IN ACCORDANCE<br />
( INAUDIBLE). AND ANOTHER QUESTION, ARE YOU SIMPLY SAYING THAT<br />
YOU WOULD LIKE THE QUOTA EXPANDED OR IN THE FINAL ANALYSIS<br />
ARE YOU ASKING FOR LIBERALISATION OF THE MARKET FOR AUSTRALIA BEEF.<br />
IF THAT IS THE CASE, THAT IS IF IT IS THE LATTER, THEN<br />
HAVE YOU MENTIONED THIS TO PRIME MINISTER NAKASONE.<br />
PM: LET ME REMIND YOU OF THE ACTUAL WORDING OF THE JOINT COMMUNIQUE<br />
WHICH IS RELEVANT TO YOUR. QUESTION THE JAPANESE<br />
SIDE BELIEVES THAT THE POSITION OF AUSTRALIA AS A SUPPLIER<br />
OF PRIMARY PRODUCTS WILL NOT DECLINE SO LONG AS THESE AUSTRALIAN<br />
PRODUCTS MAINTAIN THEIR COMPETITIVENESS AND THEIR STABLE SUPPLY<br />
IS ASSURRED. THE JAPANESE SIDE CONFIRMS THAT IT HAD NO INTENTION<br />
OF DEALING WITH THE TRADE PROBLEMS OF THIRD COUNTRIES AT THE<br />
EXPENSE OF AUSTRALIA. N. 0W WE INTERPERET THAT TO MEAN THAT<br />
AUSTRALIA WILL MAINTAIN ITS SHARE OF THE JAPANESE BEEF MARKET.<br />
PICKING UP YOUR QUESTION THIS WAY-OBVIOUSLY THE IDEAL POSITION<br />
FOR US WOULD BE THAT THE TOTAL LIBERALISATION OF THE BEEF MARKET<br />
FOR US WOULD BE THA<br />
HERE. BUT IN THE SITUATION OF LESS THAN THAT IDEAL POSITION WHERE<br />
THESE IS TOTAL LIBERALISATION, THEN I PUT TO YOU THAT FOLLOWING<br />
THE ASSURANCES CONTAINED IN THAT JOINT COMMUNIQUE I AM CONFIDENT<br />
THAT ANY INCREASE IN AMERICAN BEEF SALES WOULD BE ACCOMPANIED<br />
BY AN INCREASE IN AUSTRALIAN SALES. AS I SAY WE LOOK FORWARD<br />
TO THE EVENTUAL REMOVAL OF JAPANESE BEEF IMPORT QUOTAS. BUT<br />
WHILE THEY EXIST OUR POSITION IS THAT AUSTRALIAN BEEF SALES<br />
TO JAPAN SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO EXPAND AS RAPIDLY AS ANY OTHER<br />
COUNTRY'S. JOURNALIST: I RELAISE YOU'VE BEEN ASKED THIS QUESTION A FEW<br />
TIMES IN RECENT DAYS. BUT IF I COULD ASK IT ONCE MORE THERE'S<br />
BEEN SOME DISCUSSION THAT AUSTRALIA MAY BE SACRIFICED IN THESE<br />
AGREEMENTS THAT ARE BEIN4G MADE BETWEEN JAPAN AND) THE U. S.<br />
REGARDING BEEF IMPORTS. COULD YOU COMMENT<br />
ON THIS ONCE MORE AND A SECOND AND SEPARATE QUESTION DO YOU<br />
HAVE ANY FEELINGS ABOUT PRESIDENT REAGAN'S PLANS TO RUN FOR REELECTION. </p>
<p>P M: I'VE OBVIOUSLY JUST ANSWERED THE FIRST QUESTION AND<br />
THERE'S NO POINT IN REPEATING IT AGAIN. IN REGARD TO THE<br />
SECOND THAT DESPITE THE FACT THAT SOME PEOPLE MIGHT THINK THAT<br />
THERE IS SUCH A THING AS AN INCUMBENTS' UNION I REFRAIN, OF<br />
COURSE, FROM INTERVENING IN ANY WAY IN THE INTERNAL POLITICAL<br />
AFFAIRS OF ANOTHER COUNTRY. I SIMPLY SAY AS A FACT THAT I<br />
HAVE ENJOYED GOOD PERSONAL RELATIONS WITH PRESIDENT REAGAN.<br />
THAT IS A FACT. BUT, OF COURSE, THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS OF<br />
THAT GREAT DEMOCRACY, THE UNITED STATES, ARE FOR THE UNITED<br />
STATES AND NEITHER PRESIDENT REAGAN NOR HIS DEMOCRATIC<br />
OPPONENTS WOULD WELCOME MY INTERVENTION IN THEIR INTERNAL<br />
AFFAIRS ANY MORE THAN I WOULD WELCOME THEIRS IN OURS.<br />
JOURNALIST WOULD YOU CONCEDE THAT THE NUCLEAR DUMPING ISSUE IS<br />
AT A DELICATE POINT BETWEEN AUSTRALIA AND JAPAN. AND<br />
SECONDLY, HOW CONCERNED ARE YOU THAT THAT COULD DEVELOP INTO<br />
A PROBLEM THAT COULD ERODE THE GOOD RELATIONS AUSTRALIA AND<br />
JAPAN HAVE DEVELOPED IN THE POST-WAR PERIOD?<br />
PM: WHETHER IT IS A DELICATE ISSUE IS A MATTER OF CHOICE OF<br />
WORDS. IT'S A SIGNIFICANT ISSUE. AND I AM CONFIDENT THAT<br />
THE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT AND PEOPLE ATTACH4 SUCH IMPORTANCE TO THEIR<br />
RELATIONS WITH NOT MERELY AUSTRALIA BUT THE LARGE<br />
NUMBER OF INDPENDENT NATIONS IN THE PACIFIC REGION THAT<br />
THEY WIL TAKE INTO ACCOUNT OUR CONCERNS. I'M SURE THAT<br />
THEY WILL DISCUSS THIS ISSUE WITH US AND I AM H4OPEFUL THAT<br />
IT CAN BE RESOLVED IN A WAY WHICH WILL NOT LEAD TO THE<br />
COMPLICATIONS WHICH YOU ALLUDE TO IN YOUR QUESTION.<br />
JOURNALIST: I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE YOUR COMMENTS CONCERNING<br />
THE RECENT RISE OF EXPANSION OF JAPANESE MILITARY AND DEFENCE<br />
EPXPENDITURE WITH REGARD. TO PEACE AND STABILITY OR SECURITY...<br />
PM: THIS WAS A MATTER THAT WAS DISCUSSED BETWEEN PRIME<br />
MINISTER NAKASONE AND MYSELF. I THINK THERE WERE TWO OR THREE<br />
POINTS THAT OUGHT TO BE MADE AND WHAT I WOULD SAY IS CONSISTENT<br />
WITH THE DISCUSSIONS THAT MY FOREIGN MINISTER, MR HAYDEN, HAD,<br />
WHEN HE WAS HERE IN JAPAN. FIRSTLY, I WOULD SAY THAT JAPAN IS<br />
A SOVEREIGN NATION AND IT CAN'T BE TREATED AS A LESS THAN<br />
SOVEREIGN NATION, A SECOND CLASS COUNTRY. IT HAS THE RIGHT<br />
TO MAKE ITS DECISIONS IN THESE MATTERS. HAVING SAID THAT WE<br />
HAVE CONVEYED TO TH4E JAPANESE GOVERNMENT, BOTH MR HAYDEN AND<br />
MYSELF, OUR INDICATION OF THE SENSITIVITIES THAT EXIST BOTH WITHIN<br />
JAPAN ITSELF AND IN THE REGION ABOUT ANY SUGGESTION<br />
THAT THERE SHOULD BE SUCH AN EXTENSION OF JAPANESE EXPENDITURE<br />
IN THE DEFENCE AREA THAT JAPAN COULD BE SEEN TO BE ADOPTING<br />
ANY STANCE WHICH WAS OTHER THAN WHAT WAS NECESSARY FOR THE<br />
PURPOSES OF ITS OWN DEFENCE AND ( BL) FOR THE PROPER GIVING<br />
EFFECT TO ITS DEFENCE RELATIONSHIP AND MUTUAL SECURITY<br />
RELATIONSHIP AND UNDER THE OBLIGATIONS OF THE MUTUAL SECURITY<br />
TREATY WITH THE UNITED STATES. WE HAVE INDICATED THAT WE<br />
BELIEVE THAT TH4E OBLIGATIONS WH4ICH JAPAN IS BEGINNING<br />
ACCEPT IN RESPECT TO THE DEFENCE OF THE SOUTH4 WEST AND THE<br />
SOUTH EAST ARE CONSISTENT WITH THAT DEFENCE STANCE.<br />
THOSE ARE THE CONSIDERATIONS THA-r BOTH MR HAYDEN, MY<br />
FOREIGN MINISTER, AND I PUT TO THE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST WOULD YOU ACCEPT THAT IF AUSTRALIA IS TO DEVELOP<br />
ITS ECONOMIC AND TRADING RELATIONS WITHIN THE REGION, THAT IT<br />
NEEDS TO SCALE DOWN QUITE SIGNIFICANTLY THE LEVEL OF INDUSTRY<br />
PROTECTION WHICH CURRENTLY EXISTS TO GIVE NATIONS IN THE AREA<br />
ACCESS TO THE AUSTRALIAN MARKET. IF YOU DO COULD YOU TELL US<br />
BY HOW MUCH AND WHICH INDUSTRIES AND WHERE.<br />
PM: LET ME MAKE THESE POINTS IN RESPONSE TO THAT. IT'S<br />
AN IMPORTANT QUESTION. YOU WILL KNOW THAT PRIOR TO THIS VISIT<br />
THAT I'M UNDERTAKING TO JAPAN AND OTHER ASIAN COUNTRIES THAT<br />
WE HAVE SENT AHEAD AN ECONOMIC EXPERT FROM MY OWN STAFF AND<br />
ALSO FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF TRADE. AND WHAT HAS BEEN CONVEYED<br />
NOT MERELY FROM THEM BUT FROM OTHER SOURCES IS THAT THE ATTITUDE<br />
IN THE ASIAN COUNTRIES TO OUR LEVEL OF PROTECTION IS NOW NOT<br />
ONE WHERE THAT HAS BEEN POINTED OUT OF ITSELF AS A CURRENT<br />
CAUSE FOR CONCERN. THERE IS A PERCEPTION AS IT'S REPORTE<br />
TO ME OF AN UNDERSTANDING THAT AUSTRALIA IS SERIOUS ABOUT<br />
APPROACHING THE QUESTION OF RESTRUCTURING IT'S INDUSTRY<br />
IN A W4AY WHICH TAKES ACCOUNT OF THOSE FACTORS THAT I REFERRED<br />
TO IN MY EARLIER ANSWER ABOUT BEING PART OF THIS REGION.<br />
AND INDEED WE CAN POINT TO ACTION UNDER OUR GOVERNMENT WHICH<br />
GIVES WEIGHT TO THAT PERCEPTION. TO BE PRECISE THE NATURE<br />
OF OUR STEEL INDUSTRY PLAN, AS YOU KNOW, WAS SUCH AS TO<br />
BE ACCEPTABLE NOT ONLY WITHIN AUSTRALIA BUT UNDERSTOOD BY<br />
COUNTRIES IN THE REGION. THERE IS A PERCEPTION THAT WE ARE<br />
SERIOUS ABOUT OUR APPROACH TO RESTRUCTURING AUSTRALIAN<br />
INDUSTRY. THAT LEADS ME SECONDLY TO SAY THAT IN THAT<br />
SENSE IT'S NOT IMPORTANT OR INDEED HELPFUL FOR ME TO SAY<br />
NOW THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT PERCENT REDUCTION IN OUR<br />
TARIFF LEVELS OR TO AT-THIS POINT IDENTIFY THAT PARTICULAR<br />
INDUSTRY AND TO SAY IT WILL BE DONE BY SUCH AND SUCH A DATE.<br />
WHAT IS IMPORTANT IS THAT WE NEED NOW WITHIN AUSTRALIA TO<br />
EXTEND A DISCUSSION WITH INDUSTRY BY WHICH, OF COURSE, AS YOU<br />
KNOW, I ALWAYS INCLUDE THE TRADE UNION MOVEMENT SO THAT<br />
THERE WILL BE AN UNDERSTANDING. BUT AS WE CONTINUE NOW WITH<br />
THE SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC RECOVERY THAT IS TAKING PLACE THAT<br />
WE TOGETHER ADOPT A RANGE OF MECHANISMS WHICH IS GOING TO<br />
GIVE EMPHASIS TO THOSE INDUSTRIES WHICH HAVE THE GREATEST<br />
OPPORTUNITY FOR GROWTH WITHIN AUSTRALIA AND WH4ICH ALSO<br />
ARE OF A SORT THAT FIT IN WITH WHAT I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT<br />
IN REGARD TO ATTEMPT TO EXPAND OUR LEVEL OF MANUFACTURED<br />
EXPORTS AND SERVICES TO THE ASIAN PACIFIC REGION. SO WHAT<br />
I'M SAYING GREG IS AND THIS IS NOT AVOIDING YOUR QUESTION,<br />
I'M SIMPLY SAYING THAT THE IMPORTANT THING IS THAT THE AREA<br />
UNDERSTAND THAT WE ARE SERIOUS AND THAT WE HAVE GIVEN EVIDENCE<br />
OF IT. THAT THE AUSTRALIAN COM4MUNITY UNDERSTANDS THAT THE<br />
GOVERNMENT IS SERIOUS AND THAT NOW WE UNDERTAKE THE PROCESSES<br />
OF DISCUSSION. * AND ALSO START THE PROCESSES OF ASSISTANCE WHICH<br />
WE HAVE, OF ENCOURAGEMENT FOR NEW INDUSTRIES THAT W4E HAVE, AND<br />
MY VIEW THEREFORE IS THAT WE WILL GIVE PRIORITY TO THE DISCUSSIONS,<br />
WE WILL GIVE PRIORITY IN THE DECISIONS WE TAKE, TO SUPPORTIVE<br />
MECHANISM AND MEASURES WHICH WE'LL ENCOURAGE RELEVANT<br />
INDUSTRIES EXISTING AND NEW. AND AS TO TIMETABLE I CAN'T<br />
SAY THEREFORE THAT WITHIN 12 MONTH4S YOU 14ILL BE ABLE TO POINT<br />
TO SOME SIGNIFICANTLY RESTRUCTURED, BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT YOU<br />
WILL BE ABLE TO SAY WTTHTN THAT SORT OF TIMETABLE T1HAT THERE </p>
<p>WILL BE AN ACCEPTANCE WITHIN AUSTRALIA OF T14E SERIOUSNESS OF<br />
GOVERNMENT AND OF INDUSTRY AND OF TH4E TRADE UNIONS TO ADOPT THIS NEW<br />
APPROACH. MAY I FINALLY MAKE THIS POINT THAT I DON'T THINK IT'S<br />
FAIR TO EXISTING AUSTRALIAN EMPLOYER AND TRADE UN4ION INTEREST TO<br />
ASSUME THAT THEY ARE IMPLACABLY OPPOSED TO THESE NEW SORTS OF<br />
INITIATIVES. I THINK THAT THERE IS EVIDENCE WITHIN THE TRADE UNIONS<br />
AND WITHIN INDUSTRY THAT THERE IS AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE NEED TO<br />
CHANGE. AS I WILL BE SAYING IN MORE DETAIL TOM4ORROW WHEN I<br />
ADDRESS THIS SUBECT, IT IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR US IN AUSTRALIA NOW<br />
TO POINT TO AN EXISTING SITUATION AND SAY THAT MUST BE KEPT BECAUSE<br />
IT WILL PROVIDE EMPLOYMENT FOR PEOPLE AT THIS POINT OF TIME.<br />
WHAT WE'VE GOT TO HAVE IS A LONGER RANGE VISION AND SAY NOT<br />
WHAT IS JUST IMPORTANT FOR PART OF THIS GENERATION BUT WHAT<br />
IS MOST LIKELY TO BE SIGNIFICANT FOR A BETTER STANDARD OF<br />
LIVING FOR THE NEXT GENERATION.<br />
JOURNALIST: I UNDERSTAND FROM YOUR DISCUSSION WITH PRIME<br />
MINISTER NAKASONE THAT YOU HAVE TALKED ON THE PROBLEM OF THE<br />
MIDDLE EAST. IF IT IS POSSIBLE I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THE<br />
CONTENT OF THAT DISCUSSION. I ALSO WOULD LIKE TO KNOW YOUR<br />
BASIC POLICY AND BASIC THINKING TOWARDS THE MIDDLE EAST,<br />
IN PARTICULAR CONCERNING LEBANON...<br />
PM: PRIME MINISTER NAKASONE AND I AGREED AS IS OBVIOUS<br />
THAT THE MIDDLE EAST CONTINUES TO BE ONE OF THE TENSION AND<br />
POSSIBLE FLASHPOINTS IN THE WORLD. AS FAR AS OUR ASSESSMENT<br />
OF THE PRESENT POSITION IS CONCERNED TH4ERE IS NOT A GREAT<br />
DEAL OF GROUND IT SEEMS TO ME FOR ' OPTIMISM. AS FAR AS THE<br />
PRINCIPLES ARE CONCERNED THAT UNDERLINE THE APPROACH OF MY<br />
GOVERNMENT, THEY ARE AT ONE AND THE SAME TIME EASY OF<br />
STATEMENT BUT VERY DIFFICULT OF ACHIEVEMENT. THE BASIC<br />
PRINCIPLES WHICH UNDERLINE OUR APPROACH TO THE MIDDLE EAST<br />
ARE THE RIGHT ISRAEL TO EXIST AS A SOVEREIGN STATE BEHIND<br />
SECURE AND RECOGNISED BORDERS AND ALSO A RECOGNITION OF<br />
THE RIGHT OF THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE. IF NECESSARY OUT OF<br />
NEGOTIATIONS ( INAUDIBLE) IF THAT IS WHAT IS WANTED, IT'S<br />
A MATTER FOR DECISION -QVT OF THE NEGOTIATION PROCESSES.<br />
BUT TO GET TO THE STAGE: OF NEGOTIATION OF COURSE IS A GREAT<br />
PROBLEM. SO WITH ALL THAT WE, WITH OUR LIMITED CAPACITIES<br />
TO MOVE IN INTERNATIONAL FORA, WE PRESS THAT THERE BE ACTION<br />
TO RESOLVE THE CONFLICT IN LEBANON. WE BELIEVE THERE SHOULD<br />
BE A WITHDRAWAL OF ALL FOREIGN FORCES FROM THE LEBANON AND<br />
THAT QONLY THOSE FORCES SHOULD BE THERE WHICH ARE AT THE<br />
REQUEST OF THE GOVERNMENT OF LEBANON. NOW CLEARLY, AS YOUR<br />
QUESTION IMPLIES, THERE ARE GOWING DIFFICULTIES OVER THE<br />
COMPOSITION OF THE FOREIGN FORCES THAT ARE THERE AT THE REUQEST OF<br />
THE LEBANESE GOVERNMENT AND INDEED IT IS ARGUABLE THAT IT MAY BE<br />
A BETTER SITUATION IF YOU COULD HAVE A<br />
UNITED NATIONS SPONSORED FORCE THERE. BUT YOU MAY GIVEN THE<br />
COMPOSITION OF THE UNITED NATIONS, THE DIFFICULTIES THAT<br />
1WOULD INTRINSICALLY BE INVOLVED IN ACHIEVING THAT POSITION<br />
( TAPE BREAK) I AN M4Y GOVERNMENT SAY THAT WE WILL DO WHAT<br />
WE CAN IN OUR LIMITED WAY TO CONTRIBUTE TO TH4E DISCUSSIONS<br />
THERE. NOW IF YOU'RE BEING OBJECTIVE ABO3UT YOUR ASSESSMENTS<br />
OF THE PRESENT POSITION I WOULD THINK YOU W4OULD HAVE TO SAY THAT<br />
IT'S A VERY PESSIMISTIC SITUATION PESSIMISTIC IN REGARD TO<br />
THE LEBANON AND IN REGARD TO THE WIDER CONFLICT BECAUSE YOU </p>
<p>CAN'T IDENTIFY GROUPS, ONE GROUP HERE AND ANOTHER GROUP<br />
THERE. YOU CAN SAY TH4ERE IS ISRAEL,.,' IN RESPECT OF THE ARAB SITATE'S<br />
YOU CAN SAY THEREIS ISRAEL.\ IN RESPECT OF THE ARAB STATES<br />
THERE IS CONFLICT' THERE BETWEEN THEMb! WITHIN THE PLO NOW THERE<br />
IS CONFJACI IN REGARD TO THAT'. ORGANLSATION AND YOU HAVE TWO<br />
OF THE ABUTTING INATIONS TO ISRAEL SYRIA AND JORDAN<br />
DIAMETRICALLY OP~ POSED IN PHEIR APPROACH ' BOTH TO THE BORDE-R ISSUES<br />
AND TOWARDS THE PLO ITSELF. ; SO YOU'VE ; GOT A CONFLICT OF DIFFICULTIES<br />
AND I; WISH I COULD SAY OTHER THAN THIS# BUT I HAVE A CONSIDERABLE<br />
DEGREE OF PESSIMISM IN TH4E IMMEDIATE SENSE ABOUT THE POSITION IN<br />
THE MIDDLE EAST.<br />
PMH: WOULD I JUST ADD VERY BRIEFLY THIS OVSERVATION TH4AT<br />
OF COURSE ONE OTHER ELEMENT IN TH4E AREA WHICH IS I KNOW OF<br />
VERY CONSIDERABLE CONCERN TO JAPAN IS THE<br />
CONTINUING CONFLICT BETWEEN IRAN AND IRAQ. YOU ARE SO DEPENDENT<br />
UPON THE OIL SUPPLIES THAT COME THROUGH THE STRAIT OF HORMUZ AND<br />
WE DID DISCUSS THIS, PRIME MINISTER NAKASONE AND MYSELF, AND I<br />
UST WOULD INDICATE IN THIS CONTEXT THAT WE APPRECIATE THE<br />
FACT THAT JAPAN IS THE ONLY COUNTRY IN THE NON-COMMUNIST<br />
AREA, OR IF NOT IN ANY PART OF THE WORLD, WHICH HAS THE<br />
CAPACITY TO TALK TO BOTH IRAN AND IRAQ. THEY. HAVE BEEN<br />
TALKING AND WE CERTAINLY ENCOURAGE AND WELCOME ANY EFFORT<br />
THAT JAPAN CAN MAKE TO TRY AND GET SOME RESOLUTION TO WHAT<br />
HAS BEEN INTRINSICALLY A DISASTROUS CONFLICT FOR THE PEOPLE<br />
OF THE AREA AND POTENTIALLY SUCH A DISASTROUS CONFLICT FOR<br />
THE REST OF THE WORLD.<br />
PM: I'M ALWAYS RELUCTANT TO SAY AN ADDITIONAL WORD AS THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN PRESS CONTINGENT WILL TELL YOU. I SIMPLY SAY THAT<br />
WE ATTACH FUNDAMENTAL IMPORTANCE TO THE RELATIONS BETWEEN OUR<br />
TWO COUNTRIES. WE HAVE SO MANY THINGS IN COMMON AN<br />
IMPORTANT ECONOMIC AND TRADING RELATIONSHIP, COMMON PERCEPTIONS OF<br />
THE SECURITY INTERESTS OF THE AREA, A SHARED ALLIANCE RELATIONSHIP<br />
WITH THE UNITED STATES, AND ASSURED COMMITMENT TO TH4E PROCESSES<br />
OF PARLIAMENTARY DEMOCRACY. THERE ARE FEW COUNTRIES IN OUR<br />
REGION WHICH SHARED SUCH FUNDAMENTALS AND MY GOVERNMENT WILL<br />
BE WORKING TO SEE THAT IIN THE MOST CONSTRUCTIVE WE CAN, WE<br />
BUILD UPON THO0SE IMPORTANT FUNDAMENTALS THAT BOND US TOGETHER.<br />
( GIFT PRESENTED)<br />
PH: COULD I JUST MAKE THIS POINT AND SAY THANK YOU. I<br />
READ SOME FASCINATING FIGURES ABOUT KOALAS. IT WAS SUGGESTED THAT<br />
ONCE A KOALA STAYED IN THE ZOO THERE WOUL-D BE AN INCREASE IN VI$ IuTORS<br />
TO THE ZOO FROM 6 MILLION TO ABOUT 10 MILLION. I THOUGH4T IF<br />
WE COULD PERHAPS GET A PERCENTAGE OF THE ENTRANCE FEES WE COULD<br />
DO A LOT TO STRENGTHEN THE TRADE BALANCE BETWEEN OUR TWO<br />
COUNTRIES. </p>
