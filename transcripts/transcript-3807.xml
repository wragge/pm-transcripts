J\ USTRAI/ M GoI . N! EiET_ OFFICES<br />
LAST FRIDA':, WITH THE PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH W1ALES AND THE<br />
LORD MfAYOR OF SYDNEY, I SIGNED AN AGREEMENT BY WHICH<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT WILL PROVIDE $ 17 MILLION FOR<br />
THE RESIDENTIAL REDEVELOPMENT OF OOLOOHOOLOO.<br />
THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THAT<br />
OCCASION TH1I S. BOTH BRING TO AT LEAST PARTIAL<br />
FRUITION, CNERTAKINGS MADE IN 1972.<br />
THOSE UNDERTAKINGS MEANT A REVERSAL OF EXISTING PLANS<br />
UNDER THE PRE'IOUS GOVERNMENT. IT WAS PROPOSED,<br />
YOU WILL RE'EM3ERI THAT NEW COMMONWEALTH OFFICES WERE<br />
TO BE BUILT " i ' OOLOOPOOLOO A FULL TWO MILES FROM<br />
SYDNEY iHAT WAS HARDLY A MODEL OF<br />
DECENTRALI A' 1. IT TOOK NO ACCOUNT OF THE GROWING<br />
PRESSURE CN r ACILTIES AND SERVICES OF THE<br />
CENTRAL CiTY . EA AND OF ITS TRANSPORT SYSTEM.<br />
IT TOOK NO OOF. :: TH2EN T SPECIAL CHARACTER OF WOOLOOMOOLOO<br />
AS A RESIDE: T: LL AREA. IT TOOK NO ACCOUNT OF THE<br />
CONVENIENCE : 3 AVAILABILITY OF STAFF. IT TOOK NO<br />
ACCOUNT OF T E ' LACE AND PACE OF DEVELOPMENT OF THE<br />
METROPOLIT.. i -AREA OR OF THE NEEDS OF THE PEOPLE IN<br />
THE WESTEP' REGION. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
So FRIDAY'S OCCASION AND TODAY'S BOTH FULFIL SPECIFIC<br />
UNDERTAKINGS GIVEN BY TOM UREN AND ME IN 1972,<br />
THERE IS MORE TO IT THAN THAT HOWEVER. BOTH<br />
THESE MATTERS REPRESENT A CRUCIAL PART OF OUR WHOLE<br />
. PROGRAM OUR BELIEF THAT THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT<br />
MUST BE DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN THE PLACES WHERE MOST<br />
AUSTRALIANS LIVE, IN CITIES AND CENTRES.<br />
IT'S FITTING ENOUGH THAT THIS FIRST PART OF THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT OFFICES IN PARRAMATTA THE<br />
TAXATION CENTRE SHOULD BE OPENED ON THE LAST DAY<br />
OF THE FINANCIAL YEAR AND READY FOR BUSINESS ON THE<br />
FIRST DAY OF THE NE FINANCIAL YEAR, THERE ARE<br />
STAFF C.-F : A" TATION OFFICE ALREADY HERE.<br />
IHIS OFFICE -EESEET3S THE FIRST MAJOR PRACTICAL STEP<br />
TCWARDS IMPLE'_'-TI'CUR POLICY OF DISPERSING THE<br />
? P'BLC SER'/ I-E -T SL-METROPOLITAN AND REGIONAL AREAS,<br />
THIS OFFICE -E= E -' LL BE THE LARGEST BRANCH OF ANY<br />
DEPARTMENT CF ThE AUSTRALIAN PUBLIC SERVICE OUTSIDE<br />
CANBERRA. AS FAR AS THE TAXATION OFFICE ITSELF<br />
IS CONCERNED, THIS MOVE IS THE FORERUNNER OF A PLANNED<br />
DISPERSAL TO CENTRES IN CAMPBELLTOWN, ALBURY-WODONGA, AND<br />
TO DANDENONG AND BROADMEADOWS IN IELBOURNE.<br />
THIS CENTRE ITSELF IS EVENTUALLY PLANNED TO HOUSE<br />
5,000 PUBLIC SERVANTS, </p>
<p>-3-<br />
ONE VERY I =-CTANT ASPECT OF THIS PROGRAM OF DISPERSAL<br />
IS TO BRE.-. -, WN ANY FALSE BARRIERS BETWEEN THE<br />
PUBLIC SEr,': CE AND THE COMMUNITY WHICH IT SERVES<br />
AND OF WHICH IT IS AN INTEGRAL PART. THERE IS<br />
NOTHING MORE UNREAL, IN SOCIAL TERMS, IN ECONOMIC TERMS,<br />
IN POLITICAL TERMS, THAN TO DRAW DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN<br />
PUBLIC EMPLDYEES AND PRIVATE EMPLOYEES.<br />
IE HAVE A :. 1XED ECONOMY AND EACH SECTOR OF THE ECONOMY<br />
IS INTERDE=_ EN. ENT, THIS BUILDING MAY BE A GOVERNMENT<br />
BUILDING, SUT IT' S COMPLETION DEPENDS UPON SCORES<br />
OF PRIVATE CONTRACTS THE BUILDING ITSELF, THE EQUIPMENT<br />
IN IT, THE SERVICING OF IT AND THE PEOPLE EMPLOYED IN IT.<br />
A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF WHAT IS CALLED ' GOVERNMENT SPENDING'<br />
ENDS UP IN F. AC AS PRIVATE SPENDING.<br />
T-: E DISTINTC-I: ETEEN THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTORS<br />
IS E. UALLY . L--EAL '-EN IT COMES TO EMPLOYMENT,<br />
FOR EXAMPLE, E 3AN
IN i1EW SOUT--ES, PART OF IT. HOW UNREAL IT IS<br />
TO SUGGEST 7--T OFFICERS. IN THE PRIVATE HEALTH FUNDS,<br />
BECAUSE CL-ASsI-ED AS PRIVATE EMPLOYEES, ARE IN SOME<br />
WAY DIFFER. E:? ;-ORE PRODUCTIVE THAN THEIR COLLEAGUES<br />
IN MEDIBANK. INDEED LARGE NUMBERS OF EMPLOYEES HAVE<br />
TRANSFERRED= =: CM ONE BUREAUCRACY, IF YOU LIKE, TO<br />
ANOTHER; " EST. ERDAY'S PRIVATE FUND EMPLOYEE IS TOMORROWS<br />
MEDIBANK'S EMPLOYEE. HIS VALUE TO THE COMMUNITY REMAINS<br />
THE SAME; THE COMMUNITY. PAYS NOT ONE CENT MORE FOR<br />
HIS WORK OR FOR THE SYSTEM IN WHICH HE WORKS. </p>
<p>ANOTHER PLE THE EMPLOYEES IN THIS BUILDING ARE<br />
NOT ONLY -3LIC SERVANTS, BUT TAXPAYERS LIKE THE REST<br />
OF THE CC'. JNITYq EVEN THE TAX COLLECTOR PAYS INCOME<br />
TAX, IN A COUNTRY LIKE AUSTRALIA, WHERE ONE<br />
QUARTER OF US ARE ON THE PUBLIC PAYROLL FEDERAL.,<br />
STATE OR LOCAL IT IS A VERY FALSE DIVISION INDEED<br />
TO MAKE BETrEEN PRIVATE EMPLOYEES AND PUBLIC EMPLOYEES.<br />
I FIND IT :. OT ONLY UNREAL, BUT RATHER REPREHENSIBLE<br />
AS AN ATTEY. T TO DIVIDE A COMMUNITY ON A VERY FALSE<br />
AND FOOLISH DISTINCTION, I CANNOT SEE TO WHOSE<br />
ADVANTAGE IT IS, POLITICALLY OR ANY OTHER WAY,<br />
TO GENERATE THIS DIVISION, TO CREATE THIS DISTINCTION,<br />
THE IDEA OF THE AUSTRALIAN PUBLIC SERVICE BEING AN<br />
ISOLATED ELTE IN CANBERRA IS A MYTH,<br />
T-E PROGRA ? AA. T. ENTAL DISPERSAL IN AREAS LIKE<br />
THIS SO THA~ S-L: VCA NTS ARE SEEN TO BE WHAT<br />
THEY TRULY ? E A REAL AND INDISPENSABLE PART OF<br />
THE REAL CCI' " TY AND OF THE WHOLE COMMUNITY<br />
WILL, I TRUST, -EL? DISPEL THAT MYTH. </p>
<p>IHAVE THAT THIS BUILDING PUTS INTO PRACTrICE OUR<br />
BELIEF lIN *. TIONAL INVOLVEMENT, NATIONAL RESPONSIBILITY<br />
IN AUSTRALT: A'N CITIES AND CENTRES, THERE IS OF COURSE,*<br />
ANOTHER SIDE TO THE COIN, W4HEN THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT<br />
BECOMES INVOLVED, IT MUST ALSO SHARE RESPONSIBILITY<br />
FOR THE LCC..-l _ CONS. EQUENCES OF ITS PLANS.<br />
THE -: GROTh, AT COMES FROM THE ESTABL ISHMENT OF A<br />
CENRE AND OUR OTHER ACTIVITIES IN THIS REGION<br />
PLCETADUNAL PRESSURE ON LOCAL RESOURCES AND<br />
LOCAL SERI/ ES.<br />
THERE 1~ S TO B A FOLLOW THROUGH AND A FOLW-P<br />

IF THAT IS FORTHCOMING, THE PROGRAMS OF WHICH THIS<br />
