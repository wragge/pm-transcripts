    <content><![CDATA[<p>I was saddened to learn today of the death of my friend and former colleague, Russell Trood.</p>
<p>Russell was a good friend, a generous mentor and a wise counsel. He was one of Australia's finest foreign policy minds, respected and admired by all sides of politics. He served Australia as a scholar, as a diplomat and as a Senator.</p>
<p>He was an optimistic, dedicated and above all unfailingly decent man.</p>
<p>Australia’s relations with, and understanding of our neighbours in the Asia Pacific have been enhanced by Russell’s tireless efforts over many years.</p>
<p>The way in which Russell fought the aggressive thyroid cancer that overtook his life was characteristically stoic and brave. </p>
<p>Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife, Dale, his two children, James and Phoebe, and his many friends.</p>
