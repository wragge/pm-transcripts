PRIME MINISTER 88/ 93<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON PJ. KEATING, MP<br />
MABO THE TRUTH ABOUT CONSULTATION<br />
From thu moment the High Court handed down its decision the Government has been<br />
determined to develop a response in keeping with both the letter and spirit of the Mabo<br />
judgement. As I said in Parliament in June, and on many occasions since, in ending at last the<br />
absurd doctrine of terra nudlius and recognising the dispossession and shameful<br />
treatment of indigenous Australians, the Mabo judgement has done all Australians a<br />
great scrvice, and created the basis for reconciliation.<br />
Nothing in the Mabo judgement was ever of itself going to deliver justice. It created<br />
the basis for justice; but delivering justice depended on the nation's response.<br />
There have been unhelpful reactions from many quarters around the country, but there<br />
is no doubt that the great majority of Australians want to see justice delivered and the<br />
economic interests of Australia secured.<br />
This is the core of the Government's response and it will form the core of our<br />
legislation. The spirit and the letter of the High Court decision will be followed.<br />
Ambit claims and appeals to prejudice will be ignored.<br />
The Government has consulted widely and with goodwill.<br />
The Aboriginal community was the first to be consulted by Government following the<br />
Maho dcision. At least 30 members of the Aboriginal community met the Cabinet for<br />
almost three hours. A smaller, reprcsentative group returned to consult with the<br />
Ministerial Committee for two hours. Numerous other meetings have taken place<br />
b-tween Commonwealth officials and the Aboriginal community over the past year. I<br />
have met Mr Dodson on three occasions for periods of up to an hour in my office. I<br />
also met representatives of the Land Councils for more than an hour before last week's<br />
Cabinet meeting on Mabo.<br />
These facts expose the accusations of lack of consultation as patently untrue and<br />
unworthy of those who made them. </p>
<p>It seems [ hat despite several meetings held in good faith with the Aboriginal<br />
community dhe Government can secure only private decision and agreement which<br />
does not translatte into public agreement.<br />
If Aboriginal people seck justie and equity they must provide leaders who accept the<br />
responsihility of lcadership. Some Aboriginal leaders have accepted this responsibility,<br />
others, clearly, have not.<br />
The Aboriginal community asked for a right to be consulted. It also asked for proper<br />
protections in relation to actions affecting native title and the Commonwealth<br />
legislation will provide them. It is therefore patently untrue to say that Aboriginal<br />
people's views about devclopment will not be taken into account.<br />
The Governmnent intends to proceed with its legislation which is workable, just and in<br />
die long term interests of all Australians. We have a responsibility to delivcrjusticc for<br />
past and prescnt wrongs and I am determined to do all I can to see that justice<br />
delivered. But we also have a responsibility to the future of Australia and future gencrations of<br />
Australians, and it is my duty to do all I can to deliver that as well.<br />
As I have said before, a mature, national trsponsc to Mabo can deliver both.<br />
