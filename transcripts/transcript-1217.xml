FOR P1~ NEoS. 9S9P/. 1916% 5!<br />
M1ESSAGE FROM TH{ E PRflE MINISTER, SIR ROBERT IENZIES<br />
December, 1965<br />
NE~ iv YEAR DIESSAGE<br />
I extend New Year greetings to all of my fellow Australians.<br />
We wish for, and expect, a continuation of prosperity at<br />
home; but at the same time we recognise that our domestic prQsperity<br />
can be substantially influenced by events abroad.<br />
So. in this New Year greeting, I would like to take a quick, 4<br />
but not, I hope, a superficial look, at three immediate problems<br />
which affect peace, and therefore have some relationship to our own<br />
security and progress, and the kind of New Year we may expect.<br />
I take our neighbouring problems first.<br />
Indonesia's " confrontatio'of Malaysia and Singapore continues.<br />
This is an unhappy state of affairs, Australia is directly involved<br />
because of our commitments to aid the defence of Malaysia, whose<br />
right to independent existence we firmly uphold,<br />
I hope that in 1966 Indonesia, with which country we desire to<br />
live at peace and with mutual understanding, will not pursue policies<br />
which create quite unnecessary hostilities and which are inconsistent.<br />
with the great principles of non-aggression and the mutual recognition<br />
of the sovereignty of lawfully established government. The major<br />
interests of both Indonesia and Australia are in peace, a common<br />
understanding, mutual aid, and the raising of living standards.-4<br />
In South Vietnam we are supporting the resistance of the<br />
Government and of the United States and other nations to what is,<br />
quite clearly, armed aggression from Communist North Vietnam and<br />
subversive action inspired and directed and supplied from the ot,-<br />
The Vietnam camp: aign is complex, difficult and costly in both<br />
lives and money. I warmly share the feelings of those who would<br />
like to see it brought to an end by genuine negotiations for peace.<br />
But negotiations must be conducted in good faith on both<br />
sides. The only statements that have been made by the Government<br />
of North Vietnam show clearly and consistently that it will not<br />
negotiate for peace except on conditions the most important of which<br />
are that ' foreign" troops in South Vietnam should be withdrawn, thus<br />
abandoning the South Vietnamese Government and people, and that the<br />
future government and institutions of South Vietnam should be decided<br />
by the so-called " Liberation Front", a creature of the Communist<br />
Government of North Vietnam. In short, they wish the future of<br />
South Vietnam to be decided only by the Communists.<br />
We believe, as do the U. S. A. and other non-Communist nations,<br />
that these conditions are unacceptable. So far as Australia is<br />
concerned, a Communist victory in South Vietnam would strike a<br />
deadly blow at every now free nation in South-East Asia, and bring<br />
international Communist aggression ever nearer to our own shores.<br />
2/<br />
FOR PRESS </p>
<p>While passionately desiring peace based upon the abandonment<br />
of aggression, vwe in Australia must therefore, in 1966, stand firm<br />
in our alliances, while always hoping that there may be a genuine<br />
recourse to the conference table.<br />
Our third problem, though we are geographically remote from<br />
it,. and are in no sense a party principal, is that of Rhodesia.<br />
On behalf of the Australian Government, and I believe on your<br />
behalf also, I have stated these principles.<br />
The first is that the declaration of Independence by the then<br />
Government of Rhodesia was an unlawful act, and cannot be legally<br />
recognised by us,<br />
The second is that we think it proper, by economic and<br />
financial means, to support the Government of Britain in its attempts<br />
to persuade Rhodesia to abandon its course of action and return to<br />
proper negotiations for a steady progress towards general adult<br />
suffrage, with a proper educational programme to ensure that before<br />
too long the ultimate majority will be reasonably qualified to assume<br />
the powers and responsibilities of self-government.<br />
The third is that a new constitutional settlement should be<br />
sought without the employment of armed force.<br />
A good future for Rhodesia, whose eople have worked hard for<br />
the growth and prosperity of their own country, cannot be built upon<br />
a. foundation of hatred and bloodshed. Racial differences can always,<br />
among sensible people, be settled by negotiation and co-operation.<br />
But racial hatreds, expressed in acts of war, could write a terrible<br />
chapter in the history of Africa: could bring dissolution to a<br />
multi-racial Commonwealth; and could serve to destroy that<br />
international understanding which, since the Second War, a hundred<br />
nations have been struggling to achieve.<br />
This is a much longer New Year message than I have issued<br />
before. But my desire is to make it clear that while we wish each<br />
other the greatest possible happiness, we would not want to have it<br />
at the expense of the unhappiness of millions of other human beings.<br />
" Je Mistralians are not war-mongers. -Je love peace, and<br />
desire it for all. But what we believe in, we will help to defend.<br />
I have referred to three problems. ' Ply New Yeai-wish, and<br />
yours, is that 1966 will see tlaose problems solved in an atmosphere<br />
of peace, justice and goodwill.<br />
