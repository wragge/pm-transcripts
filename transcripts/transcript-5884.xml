COMMONWEALTH ASSISTANCE TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT<br />
The Acting Prime Minister, John Howard, announced today that<br />
local authorities will this year receive from the Commonwealth<br />
an increase in general revenue assistance.<br />
Premiers have been advised that $ 424.49 million will be made<br />
available to the states for passing to local government authorities<br />
as general revenue assistance in 1982-83 under arrangements<br />
provided by the Commonwealth in the Local Government ( Personal<br />
Income Tax Sharing) Act 1976. This represents an increase of<br />
almost 21% over the allocation for 1981-82.<br />
The amounts to be paid to each State in 1982-83, together with<br />
the corresponding amounts for 1981-82 are:<br />
Local Government tax sharing entitlements 1981-82 1982-83<br />
New South Wales 128.06 154.93<br />
Victoria 89.30 108.04<br />
Queensland 59.16 71.57<br />
South Australia 30.18 36.51<br />
Western Australia 32.95 39.86<br />
Tasmania 11.23 13.58<br />
TOTAL ( round 350.87 424.49.<br />
The funds provided to the States under these arrangements are<br />
allocated to individual local government authorities by the<br />
States. Under general guidelines provided in the Commonwealth<br />
legislation, at least 30% of the funds are to be distributed<br />
to all Councils on a per capita basis, which may be weighted<br />
for area or population density, with the balance being allocated<br />
on a needs basis which is the subject of prior inquiry and report<br />
by the individual States Grants Commission.<br />
The funds will be made available to the States for payment<br />
to each local government authority as soon as possible after<br />
the States Grants * Commissions have completed their assessment<br />
and the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister in Federal<br />
Affairs has been notified that the proposcd distribution </p>
<p>-2<br />
is in accordance with the legislation.<br />
General revenue assistance to local government has increased<br />
from $ 80 million under the previous Labor Government to<br />
$ 140 million in 1976-77, $ 165.33 million in 1977-78, $ 179.43<br />
miAllion in 1978-79, $ 221.74 million in 1979-80, $ 300.79 million<br />
in 1980-81, $ 350.87 million in 1981-82 and $ 424.49 million in<br />
1982-83. As a result, local government will have received<br />
about $ 1783 million in untied grants in the seven years of<br />
the tax sharing arrangements.<br />
In addition to the funds provided to the States, the<br />
Commonwealth has made provision, under the Memorandum of<br />
Understanding between the Commonwealth and the Northern<br />
Territory, for an amount of $ 2.03 million to be made available<br />
in 1982-83 to the Northern Territory Government for<br />
onforwarding to the local government authorities in the<br />
Terkitory ($ 1.68 million in 1981-82).<br />
The Commonwealth Government's tax sharing arrangements have<br />
thus provided a very substantial source of funds to local<br />
government bodies throughout. the country. Just as<br />
importantly, the funds are provided without strings giving<br />
local governments the freedom, and the responsibility, to<br />
determine their own expenditure priorities. </p>
