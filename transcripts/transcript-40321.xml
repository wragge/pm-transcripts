    <content><![CDATA[<p>A new era of Antarctic engagement was announced today by the Turnbull Government, with the launch of the Australian Antarctic Strategy and 20 Year Action Plan.</p>
<p>The Turnbull Government is providing $255 million in funding over the next ten years to enhance Australia’s Antarctic logistics and science capabilities.</p>
<p>This includes $55 million for infrastructure and $200 million for sustainable ongoing funding for the Australian Antarctic program.</p>
<p>This is the most significant package of measures ever developed to build Australia’s role as a leader in Antarctica.</p>
<p>Providing new operational funding and modernising the Australian Antarctic program will enable Australia to continue to deliver world-class science, and run our Antarctic operations safely and efficiently.</p>
<p>The acquisition of a world-class icebreaker for resupply and multi-disciplinary science represents the largest ever investment by Australia in our Antarctic program.</p>
<p>A deep-field overland science traverse capability and mobile research station infrastructure will provide essential support for critical Antarctic science.</p>
<p>We have committed to scope further options to establish year-round aviation access between Hobart and Antarctica.</p>
<p>This follows the successful trial of heavy lift cargo flights using Australian Defence Force C-17As this Antarctic season.</p>
<p>Under the Antarctic Treaty system, Antarctica is designated as a natural reserve, free of mining and devoted to peace, environmental protection and cooperative international science.</p>
<p>These investments allow us to work even more closely with other countries to strengthen this important and unique Treaty system.</p>
<p>The Australian and Tasmanian governments will continue to work to enhance Tasmania’s status as a global Antarctic research hub and the premier Gateway to East Antarctica, including the expansion of infrastructure in Hobart to accommodate the new icebreaker.</p>
