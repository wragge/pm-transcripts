PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 18 APRIL 1991<br />
JOINT STATEMENT WITH THE MINISTER FOR<br />
ABORIGINAL AFFAIRS, ROBERT TICKNER<br />
The Government has given further consideration to its<br />
historic initiative to address the process of reconciliation<br />
between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and the<br />
wider community.<br />
We have been heartened by the response to our previous<br />
announcement in December and the discussion paper that was<br />
issued. The Minister has spoken to or been in contact with<br />
leaders of political parties at the Federal and State<br />
levels, Aboriginal leaders and organisations, the churches,<br />
business, trade union, and community organisations.<br />
It is evident that many people have read the discussion<br />
paper, and are coming forward to express their support.<br />
On the basis of assurances of support for the general thrust<br />
of the initiative from political parties, Aboriginal and<br />
Torres Strait Islander leaders and community organisations,<br />
such as the major churches, we are to proceed forthwith in<br />
drafting legislation to establish the Council for Aboriginal<br />
Reconciliation. The Council, when established, will be responsible for<br />
setting the broader approach to the reconciliation process<br />
and its eventual outcome. The Council members, both<br />
Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal, will have a significant role<br />
to play in developing and overseeing the awareness and<br />
education campaign which will be the cornerstone of the<br />
reconciliation process.<br />
