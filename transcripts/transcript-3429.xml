    <content><![CDATA[<p>PRIME MINISTER PRESS STATEMENT NO. 350<br />23 October 1974<br />UNIVERSAL CHILDREN'S DAY<br />More than 110 nations join in observing Univeral<br />Children's Day on 23 October. It is 20 years since the day<br />was first proclaimed by the United Nations.<br />The special theme of this year's day is " lA Future for<br />Every Child". UNICEF and the International Union for Child<br />Welfare, the International Co-sponsors of the day, have chosen<br />this theme to emphasise the individual importance of every<br />child, even in a crowded world.<br />In the next 30 years, according to the best estimates,<br />the world's population of more than 3,500,000,000 will almost<br />double. Already the majority of the world's children are<br />deprived of many basic needs. Some 30% under the age of five<br />are seriously malnourished.<br />When problems of sheer global survival confront the<br />human race it is important to redouble our efforts on behalf<br />of the world's children. There are more children suffering<br />from extreme privation today than there were 20 years ago.<br />About 70% of UNICEF money goes to equip health centres,<br />schools, day-care arid community centres, directly benefiting<br />millions of infants and children. Nearly 30% goes to training<br />nurses, midwives, health and nutrition field workers, primary<br />school teachers and supervisors, child welfare and day-care<br />workers. In observing Universal Children's Day we should keep<br />in mind the well-being of all children, the enhancement of the<br />quality of their lives and the promotion of equality of<br />opportunity for both children and their parents. We in<br />Australia may hope to provide a model for the rest of the world<br />in the care of our own Children, but we must bear in mind our<br />responsibility to all children, wherever they may live. " A<br />Future for Every Child" means no less than a future for our<br />planet. CANBERRA. A. C. T.</p>
