TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
OPENING OF THE ABC SOUTHBANK CENTRE, MELBOURNE<br />
NOVEMBER 1994<br />
E&amp; EO PROOF COPY<br />
Thank you indeed Mark, Mrs Armstrong, David Hill, Haddon Storey and Mrs<br />
Storey, my ministerial colleague Michael Lee, Senator Alston, the City<br />
Commissioner, distinguished members of the ABC board, the Melbourne<br />
Symphony Orchestra and ladies and gentlemen.<br />
It is a great pleasure to be here at this, the opening ceremony of the Southbank<br />
complex because for too many years the ABC has lived in rabbit warrens in<br />
Sydney and Melbourne Melbourne the same as Sydney and I was delighted, in<br />
the years I was Treasurer, to try and assist the ABC into a major focus facility in<br />
Sydney and we have been able to do it as well here in Melbourne, and I<br />
congratulate the board and the Managing Director for seeing these great<br />
developments come about. It is, as the Chairman said, a delight that it is in<br />
Southbank, and Southbank is a delightful area. It is an area Melbourne has<br />
always had the view. there has always been the view that Melbourne has had<br />
the lungs of the great parks around the city, and it has. But I think Southbank<br />
proves another point, and that is the breadth and the breathing has got to be in<br />
the built environment too, and we see it in the great cities of the world like Paris.<br />
and we have seen it in cities that have seen their best and may be coming again<br />
cities like Berlin, where the built environment matters, and Southbank has<br />
shown this to Melbourne. And there is, I think, now somewhat of a celebration<br />
about it, and I was also pleased to be involved if only in a small way -with a<br />
number of Premiers who have been developing this John Cain and Joan<br />
Kirner who is with us today and now the current Government of Victoria.<br />
This is a great development for Melbourne, and I felt the other night when the<br />
Festival was on the opening of the Festival at the Canadian Opera, where I<br />
might say that the MSO sounded tremendous strength was coming from them. </p>
<p>Afterwards we went down to the Riverside, and there was a real celebration<br />
there. And there was even a clap for the Melbourne Casino they even got<br />
their hands together as the candles lit up, everybody put their hands together, so<br />
there was a great feeling of joy about the place. And why shouldn't there be?<br />
The fact is, to have the ABC here right in the centre of all this is, as Mark<br />
said, we're going to see Southbank become the area a focused area for<br />
television production and multi-media as well. Indeed, a real milieu of arts and<br />
culture, and it's entirely significant that the ABC should be here as Australia's<br />
pre-eminent cultural organisation, because the ABC is undoubtably and<br />
absolutely Australia's pre-eminent cultural organisation, an essential part of the<br />
cultural fabric of this country. There is a word that is being thrown around at the<br />
moment called convergence. You now, in this day and age of acronyms and<br />
words, every couple of years there is a new big one that floats around the<br />
current new big one is convergence. It means many things, but I think in this<br />
context it means the convergence of what the ABC has to offer, and what<br />
Melbourne has to offer. Because I think there is a real convergence here, and<br />
we saw it the Festival which was directed very competently by Leo Schofield in<br />
the last few weeks we saw it in that flood of energy, and we have seen it over<br />
the years with the fact that Melbourne is a great city a city of ideas, of art of<br />
music, of football, of sport and the convergence of these two gives us a<br />
chance if Creative Nation means anything, we'll certainly see a lot of creativity<br />
here at Southbank with the ABC.<br />
In the Creative Nation statement I had the pleasure of launching just a few<br />
weeks ago, it was my very great pleasure to see and to announce that the<br />
Commonwealth would establish a national music academy here in Melbourne,<br />
that Melbourne would be the home of the $ 60 million television production fund,<br />
and also the home of the Australian Cultural Foundation and six multi-media<br />
centres. And I am hoping that, along with all things else which Melbourne has in<br />
terms of art and cultural sophistication, that these things will add new dimensions<br />
to Melbourne, and see it emerge as in South-East Asia as one of the places<br />
where art and culture and particularly Australian culture can emerge. There<br />
is a great chance for Australia in the information technology, and in art and<br />
culture, because we have always had whether it be in literature or in music or<br />
in film and television and last night we were celebrating our film awards the<br />
capacity to really add something to the technological availability of educational<br />
and entertainment materials. Entertainment has been an industry which has<br />
largely been locked up with the United States I think we now have the chance<br />
to challenge that, and we can challenge it in the market to which we are closest<br />
and which shares the same time zone as us. And that must give us enormous<br />
opportunities to be up there, because many other cultures.. . the information<br />
tech , nology culture has, and it will not be exclusively an English-speaking<br />
culture, but there is a very large component from the English-speaking countries<br />
there. And I think there is a real cultural impediment certainly at this point of its </p>
<p>development of some countries which have mastered very great technological<br />
advances, such as Japan, running into something of an impediment in dealing<br />
with information technology. But there is no such impediment on Australia.<br />
So that's why I think it is important to get our culture and our technology<br />
together, and I suppose as Mark and David said earlier, eloquently, this building<br />
is going to be a mix of the two fifty studios, eight of them entirely digitalised<br />
being the home of all this creative capacity. It's the very essence if we have to<br />
find it in a building of what this jump into multi-media means, here at<br />
Southbank. But I think this capacity to project ourselves into this world is very<br />
great indeed, but that's why I say " you can't do this unless you're confident about<br />
yourself". You can't be out there as some sort of derivative culture saying " oh, is<br />
there a place in here for You have got to go out there and bang the doors<br />
in, and you can only ever do that when you are entirely confident about where<br />
you are and what you have become. And that is why I have always thought the<br />
republic means so much to us not simply so much for the constitutional<br />
change, but for the sense that it brings. You can't go around the world saying<br />
" here we are, here's our culture, here's what we can add, but by the way, we're<br />
borrowing the monarch of another country while we're at it." Now, we all know<br />
that act is over, it's just a matter of when it runs out. And I always say to my<br />
Tory friends, " come on board, better late than never there's always a place for<br />
you"-. Anyway, what we are talking about is energy it's the energy of the city, of<br />
Melbourne here, it's the energy of the ABC, it's the energy of the creative people.<br />
If multi-media, the transmission of our values, the transmission of our thought, of<br />
our culture is about anything, it is about energy. And we are seeing a real stir in<br />
the energy of this country someone has put a big acupuncture needle into<br />
Melbourne and Sydney, and in Perth and Adelaide, and the energy is well and<br />
truly flowing. And so what we have to do then is sort of direct it around the world<br />
so we can enjoy it and so can others. The ABC, of course, has been a bearer of<br />
culture and tradition for this country for as long as any of us can remember, and<br />
not just that, a trailblazer it's not just the bearer, it's also a trailblazer. And its<br />
charter has been to focus on Australian culture, and I think this charter is going<br />
to be more important as the years go on as we see homogenised<br />
entertainment around the world, as Hollywood tries to extend its hegemony over<br />
the world information highway. As we -start to see the capacity for major<br />
broadcasting companies to actually have that sort of impact, standing by one's<br />
culture is going to be, and promoting one's culture and developing one's culture<br />
is going to be exceptionally important to this country. Not just for what we can<br />
do abroad, but most particularly, what we do at home. So the charter values of<br />
the ABC its charter role in news, current affairs, sport, drama, ideas,<br />
information all the things it does, and does well, we will need it to do even<br />
more of* as the, if you like, the international assault comes, and come it will with </p>
<p>pay television, and with satellites and with the computer linkages through the<br />
information highway.<br />
So let's think that in developing this building at Southbank, we are getting ready.<br />
We are getting ready to be able to project our culture and to develop it in the<br />
context of this great international change which is with us. The ABC, of course,<br />
has responded to this challenge not just now, but has in these years and in a<br />
number of ways with Australian Television International as a case in point,<br />
which is an entirely valuable projection of our values and our culture. And I am<br />
often told, when I go to Indonesia for instance, that the Indonesian cabinet<br />
many members of it watch ATVI news of an evening, and if you are really<br />
lucky, if you get the time right, you can even watch Question Time it comes<br />
through, and then you appreciate that part of the Standing Orders which takes<br />
the interjections out and all the rest. But it's there. And that healthy, robust<br />
celebration of our democracy we have on our news services and in our<br />
Parliament, is out there and the values are being transmitted. And I think that's<br />
a tremendous thing.<br />
And the same with pay television the Government, with the Board and the<br />
Managing Director, have seen a role for the ABC in pay television. It's going to<br />
be tricky getting it right, as it is for anybody in this business. Whether it's going<br />
to be satellite delivered or terrestrially delivered, the fact is the Government<br />
believes that the ABC if we're going to have pay television transmission into<br />
homes then the ABC should be there. It will be up to the ABC as to who it<br />
packages its product with, how it does it and where it gets the value. But the fact<br />
is it has got two channels there, and of course, in the end as many channels as it<br />
likes as the fibre-optic cable is rolled out, and as much as it can sell in programs<br />
and packages. But it should be there, and it can be there, and I think it is<br />
important that it is there.<br />
We have also seen remarkable changes with radio. I think it has been a great<br />
job done with radio across the continent great variety, great quality. In the last<br />
year we have seen five major international awards to ABC radio, fifteen major<br />
Australian awards and in the last five years, we have seen an increase in the<br />
audience reached from 25% to 40% of the population. That is a tremendous<br />
change that is a revolution in communications really for a medium which has<br />
been around a very long time. And all of the networks lead in Australian content.<br />
Of course with that, Radio Australia is now, still at this point, broadcasting to<br />
about 50 million listeners, and JJJ that ground-breaking network for young<br />
Australians is now being extended to rural Australia. So there has been a<br />
tremendous change in radio, and we all appreciate the quality of ABC radio<br />
because I think almost one-third to half the country listen to it every week. So<br />
this -isa nother thing. </p>
<p>But the ABC has its history also in what it does in drama and in music, and let<br />
me say a couple of things about the orchestras, given that we have made them<br />
the subject of some discussion in the Cultural Statement, and the MSO is with us<br />
today. I have always doubted whether Australia could actually with 18 million<br />
people build an orchestra of the standard of the Berlin Philharmonic or the<br />
Vienna or others, but it has always been my great ambition that we could. And<br />
given the fact that because the ABC started the city orchestras as radio<br />
orchestras, we have over a period of time, been able to give our cities very high<br />
standard orchestras, and that has been a great thing for Australia. We are a<br />
tremendously urbanised country, with two very large concentrations in Sydney<br />
and Melbourne, and the SSO and the MSO have sought to service those<br />
communities with their orchestras. So the Government has had two approaches<br />
to this: one, that we try and establish a national music school that can actually<br />
feed an orchestra by the people who operate and teach in it, and by its product,<br />
and maybe build one organically continue to build an orchestra organically or<br />
another approach, which is essentially to try and encourage the individual<br />
development of an orchestra by getting the cheque book out and trying to<br />
develop it and to buy in the skills we need to make it into that international<br />
standard. We have chosen that route for the Sydney Symphony Orchestra, and<br />
that option is available for the MSO. My advice to the MSO is to say to Aunty<br />
" thank you Aunty, we love you, but we are leaving you but please leave us<br />
room to come home occasionally". But that is a matter for you, and you can<br />
make your mind up about that.<br />
One of the things we are seeing from this lI'm delighted that the ABC has said<br />
that the MSO will be its flagship orchestra that has already encouraged the<br />
Victorian Government to donate $ 600,000 a year towards it, to expand its string<br />
section and make it stronger. Well today, I would like to top that up to $ 1 million<br />
so at least the orchestra can expand its string section, and we can see what the<br />
ABC is prepared to do with it. I will be very interested to see, we have always<br />
had some competition between the SSO and the MSO, and what a good thing<br />
competition always is, and we are going to see more of it, and the nation will be<br />
the winners from that and not just here, but abroad as well, so good luck to you.<br />
Could I just say a couple of things about the Managing Director, because he has<br />
been in the news these days? I say this David, after 8 1/ 2 years you have got<br />
the right to leave anywhere. When I walked into my Chairman after 8 1/ 2 years<br />
as Treasurer and told him I was leaving, he wasn't particularly pleased, but I still<br />
left. Admittedly I came back a bit later to do something else. An old friend of<br />
mine, Jack Lang I'm always getting Jack Lang quoted back to me by my<br />
opponents said to me " The only reason they will ever take you Paul" he said,<br />
" is if they really want you". Well, you can make those sort of comebacks in<br />
public life I'm not sure if you can leave as Managing Director of the ABC and<br />
then make a comeback probably that is a bit of a tall order. But, 8 1/ 2 years is<br />
a very long time, and for an institution.. . and David has certainly knocked a lot of </p>
<p>the rough edges off the ABC, and all the developments I have spoken of this<br />
building, the building in Sydney, and they are not just buildings they are<br />
actually the bringing together of hubs of creativity the shift into Asia, the growth<br />
in radio, the changes in the management of the ABC are very great changes<br />
indeed, and they should be logged in the national consciousness as we see the<br />
ABC move through these various eras of change, at the pace of change today<br />
with multi-media coming the way it is, with pay television coming the way it is,<br />
getting ready for that, and working it out and let me tell you this, nobody quite<br />
knows where all these technologies are going, and trying to keep a foot on all of<br />
them is one of the things which the ABC has done under David's leadership, and<br />
I think this is something well done on its behalf. I did see today across the<br />
headlines in The Australian: " Hill forced out says Downer". Now I thought he<br />
was referring to Robert Hill. Now I know it is a teensy-weensy bit horrid of me to<br />
say that, but the fact is moderates I don't know what price they have on the<br />
scalp of moderates in the Liberal Party, but it is very high. At any rate, it<br />
wasn't it turned out you had to read down the story to see he was talking about<br />
you David, and that's is why I thought I would say that whenever you go and I<br />
think you have said you were going in June after 8 1/ 2 years, it is one hell of<br />
an innings, and good on you.<br />
So perhaps let me conclude where I began and say it is more than a pleasure to<br />
be here. To see these complexes put together, and to know it is such a<br />
tremendously strong underpinning of the ABC, and to know what the ABC has<br />
meant to Australia down throughout the decades, and to know now as we see<br />
the threat of homogenisation heading towards us, just how centrally important<br />
this unique cultural institution is. To be here, at Southbank, in this year, when<br />
these changes are right upon us, there's a sense of poignancy about it which I<br />
think we all feel and understand. Annita and I are delighted to be here today,<br />
and it is with very great pleasure indeed that I declare the Southbank Complex<br />
open. Thank you.<br />
ends. </p>
