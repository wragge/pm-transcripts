    <content><![CDATA[<p>Thank you so much and it is great to see so many people here, early, on a Parliamentary sitting day to demonstrate their concern and to do their bit for awareness of ovarian cancer.</p>
<p>This is a very, very serious disease. It is a very serious killer of women. Let’s not mince our words – this is a cancer that afflicts many, many people.</p>
<p>In any one day about four women are diagnosed with ovarian cancer. Tragically, far too many of them lose that fight.</p>
<p>All of us must do what we can to try to ensure that we do better in the battle against ovarian cancer.</p>
<p>Government must do more. I am pleased to say that the Government is investing some $80 million in infusions for people with ovarian cancer.</p>
<p>So many Australians have been at ovarian cancer awareness events over this month.</p>
<p>It is great that the month was kicked off with a teal coloured Old Parliament House. It is great that so many people right around our country have been at ovarian cancer awareness breakfasts, morning teas and other events.</p>
<p>My own daughters will be doing something for ovarian cancer this week.</p>
<p>And of course, we are all here today in very significant numbers.</p>
<p>It is good to have the Leader of the Opposition here, Bill Shorten. It’s good to see so many other Parliamentary colleagues here this morning.</p>
<p>Some years ago, Pat Farmer and I walked up and down a very, very tall building to raise money for ovarian cancer. Pat did 100,000 steps up and down Centrepoint Tower. I was only able to manage 50,000 steps myself but every time any one of us does something like attending an event such as this; we are taking a step towards greater awareness, better care and ultimately a cure.</p>
<p>So, I am very pleased to be here this morning, but I am particularly pleased to see so many people from all sides of the Parliament here.</p>
<p>The struggle against disease, the struggle for a healthier society is a bipartisan effort. It unites all of us.</p>
<p>Cancer is no respecter of persons. Cancer doesn’t acknowledge an ideology. Cancer is a killer and we must do everything we can to raise awareness, to help those with it and to find a cure.</p>
