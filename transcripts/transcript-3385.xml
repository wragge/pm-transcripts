11 SEPTEMBER 1974<br />
SPEECH BY-THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S YEAR<br />
INAUGURAL MEETING OF THE NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE, CANBERRA<br />
ONE OF THE REGULAR AND OFTEN UNNOTICED<br />
ACTIVITIES OF THE UNITED NATIONS IS ITS DESIGNATION<br />
OF INTERNATIONAL YEARS FOR THE PURPOSE OF DRAWING<br />
ATTENTION TO MATTERS OF HUMAN SIGNIFICANCE. ' FOR<br />
INSTANCE IN THE PAST DECADE THERE HAVE BEEN<br />
PROCLAIMED SUCH YEARS AS<br />
INTERNATIONAL CO-OPERATION YEAR ( 1965)<br />
INTERNATIONAL YEAR FOR HUMAN RIGHTS ( 1968)<br />
INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION YEAR ( 1970)<br />
INTERNATIONAL YEAR TO COMBAT RACISM AND<br />
RAC. IAL DISCRIMINATI. ON ( 1971)<br />
WORLD POPULATION YEAR ( 1973)<br />
* IN THE PAST, IN AUSTRALIA, THESE YEARS HAVE<br />
BEEN CELEBRATED WITHIN THE COMMUNITY THROUGH THE ACTIVITIES<br />
OF VARIOUS ORGANISATIONS, BUT RARELY HAVE GOVERNMENTS<br />
TAKEN THESE YEARS SERIOUSLY ENOUG-H TO PLAN FAR-REACHING<br />
AND IMAGINATIVE PROGRAMS AIMED AT ACHIEVING THE OBJECTIVES<br />
OF THE YEAR. My GOVERNMENT HAS DECIDED THAT THERt IS<br />
MUCH MORE THAT CAN BE DONE, AT A NATIONAL LEVEL, TO<br />
ASSIST AND CO-ORDINATE THE CELEBRATION OF THESE<br />
YEARS$ / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
THE STRUGGLE FOR UNIVERSAL HUAN RIGHTS<br />
IS A PROTRACTED AND PERHAPS AN UNENDING STRUGGLE.<br />
INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S YEAR IS CONSIDERED TO BE<br />
ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT IN THAT THE GOVERNMENT. IS<br />
DETERMINED THAT ITS ACTIONS AND PHILOSOPHIES<br />
ADOPTED IN THE INTERNATIONAL FORUM BE MATCHED WITH<br />
THOSE PURSUED AT HOME. IN THE UNITED NATIONS,<br />
AUSTRALIA IS BECOMING KNOWN AS AN OUTSPOKEN CONTENDER<br />
FOR BASIC HUMAN RIGHTS. WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE HAVE<br />
A CONTINUING OBLIGATION TO DO ALL IN OUR POWER TO<br />
-PROMOTE RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS.<br />
To MY MIND, THE UNIVERSAL DECLARATION OF<br />
HUMAN RIGHTS IS ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT AND<br />
ENLIGHTENED ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE UNITED NATIONS, AND<br />
IT IS FROM THIS FUNDAMENTAL COMMITMENT TO THE DIGNITY<br />
OF PEOPLE THAT 1975 WAS UNANIMOUSLY PROCLAIMED ON<br />
18 DECEMBER 1972 BY THE UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY<br />
TO BE INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S YEAR,<br />
IT IS WORTH CONSIDERING THE FACT THAT IT<br />
WAS THOUGHT NECESSARY TO NOMINATE A YEAR FOR ALL<br />
NATIONS TO MAKE A CONCENTRATED EFFORT TOWARDS ENSURING<br />
THAT WOMEN ENJOY THE DIGNITY OF BASIC HUMAN RIGHTS, / 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
THAT THEY AKt INTEGRATED INTO SOCIETY AND THAT<br />
THERE IS A RECOGNITION OF THE IMPORTANCE OF THEIR<br />
CONTRIBUTION TO SOCIETY,<br />
IT IS WORTH CONSIDERING THIS FACT BECAUSE<br />
IT IS A SOBERING THOUGHT THAT WOMEN THROUGHOUT THE<br />
WORLD HAVE TO BE GRANTED AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE HEARD.<br />
THE FORMATION OF A NATIONAL ADVISORY<br />
COMMITTEE, AND THIS ITS INAUGURAL MEETING, IS'AN<br />
INSURANCE THAT AUSTRALIA WILL FACE THE RESPONSIBILITY<br />
* THAT THIS YEAR PLACES UPON US.<br />
IT IS MY HOPE THAT YOU WILL BE ABLE TO<br />
MARSHALL, CO-ORDINATE AND ENCOURAGE THE DEDICATION,<br />
ENERGY AND ENTHUSIASM OF ORGANISATIONS AND WOMEN<br />
WITHIN THE COMMUNITY, AND THAT IN ADDITION YOU WILL<br />
PROVIDE A NATIONAL DIRECTION TO THIS ACTIVITY SO THAT<br />
1975 IS NOT ONLY A YEAR OF SIGNIFICANCE IN ITSELF<br />
BUT THAT IT WILL HAVE MADE A LASTING CONTRIBUTION<br />
TOWARDS REDUCING THE PREJUDICES AND LACK OF OPPORTUNITY<br />
FROM WHICH WOMEN SUFFER. IT IS ALSO MY HOPE THAT THIS<br />
YEAR WILL ENSURE A LASTING RECOGNITION OF THE GREAT<br />
CONTRIBUTION THAT WOMEN HAVE MADE, AND CONTINUE TO<br />
MAKE, TO AUSTRALIAN SOCIETY, S./ 14 </p>
<p>GOVERNMENT LEGISLATION CAN ONLY ACHIEVE SO<br />
MUCH AND I SHALL NOT PRETEND TO YOU THAT ANY GOVERNMENT<br />
CAN ACHIEVE IMMEDIATELY FOR AUSTRALIAN WOMEN THE REVOLUTION<br />
REQUIRED TO ALLOW THEM TO DEVELOP FULLY AS INDIVIDUALS,<br />
FOR INSTANCE IT MUST BE SAID THAT, EVEN IF<br />
WE WERE TO REMOVE ALL THE INEQUALITIES OF OPPORTUNITY<br />
AND OF STATUS, IT STILL WOULD NOT BE ENOUGH, WE HAVE<br />
TO ATTACK THE SOCIAL INEQUALITIES, THE HIDDEN AND<br />
USUALLY UNARTICULATED ASSUMPTIONS WHICH AFFECT WOMEN<br />
NOT ONLY IN EMPLOYMENT BUT IN THE WHOLE RANGE OF THEIR<br />
OPPORTUNITIES IN LIFE,<br />
THIS IS NOT JUST A MATTER FOR GOVERNMENTS<br />
AND FOR ACTION BY GOVERNMENTS IT IS A MATTER OF<br />
CHANGING COMMUNITY ATTITUDES AND UPROOTING COMMUNITY<br />
PREJUDICES, AND INSOFAR AS THIS REQUIRES A RE-EDUCATION<br />
OF THE COMMUNITY THEN CLEARLY GOVERNMENTS ALONE CANNOT<br />
BE EXPECTED TO DO THE WHOLE JOB, YOU ARE PROBABLY AWARE<br />
OF WHAT WE HAVE DONE, ONE OF THE PURPOSES OF THE<br />
HUMAN RIGHTS BILL WAS TO PERMIT AUSTRALIA TO RATIFY<br />
THE CONVENTION ON THE POLITICAL RIGHTS OF WOMEN, WHICH<br />
WAS ADOPTED BY THE UNITED NATIONS IN 1952 AND CAME<br />
INTO FORCE IN JULY 1954, AUSTRALIA IS NOT A PARTY TO<br />
THE CONVENTION ON THE POLITICAL RIGHTS OF WOMEN AS<br />
THERE IS STILL LEGISLATION IN TWO STATES, SOUTH AUSTRALIA </p>
<p>AND TASMANIA, THAT DOES NOT YET FULLY CONFORM WITH<br />
THE REQUIREMENTS OF THAT CONVENTION, THIS CONVENTION<br />
PROVIDES THAT WOMEN SHALL BE ENTITLED TO HOLD PUBLIC<br />
OFFICE AT AUSTRALIAN AND STATE LEVEL ON EQUAL TERMS<br />
WITH MEN, WITHOUT ANY DISCRIMINATION, ACTION HAS<br />
ALREADY BEEN TAKEN TO AMEND AUSTRALIAN LEGISLATION<br />
RELATING TO THE PUBLIC SERVICE TO REMOVE PROVISIONS<br />
THAT OFFEND AGAINST THIS CONVENTION, -IT ISEXPECTED<br />
THAT AUSTRALIA WILL RATIFY OR ACCEDE TO THAT CONVENTION<br />
AFTER THESE DEFECTS HAVE BEEN OVERCOME, EITHER AS A<br />
RESULT OF THE PROPOSED HUMAN RIGHTS ACT OR BY THE<br />
ENACTMENT OF SPECIFIC LEGISLATION ON THE SUBJECT,<br />
MY GOVERNMENT HAS ALREADYfESTABLISHED<br />
A NATIONAL COMMITTEE ON DISCRIMINATION IN EMPLOYMENT<br />
AND OCCUPATION, OTHER ACTION TAKEN BY THE GOVERNMENT<br />
IN THE AREA OF WOMEN'S EMPLOYMENT INCLUDE:<br />
SUCCESSFUL INTERVENTION IN DECEMBER 1972<br />
IN PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION COMMISSION<br />
TO HAVE ESTABLISHED THE. PRINCIPLE OF EQUAL<br />
PAY FOR WORK OF EQUAL VALUE, CONSULTATIONS<br />
WITH STATE GOVERNMENTS HAVE LED TO MOST<br />
STATES AGREEING TO THIS PRINCIPLE, </p>
<p>-6-<br />
THE PROVISION OF TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES FOR<br />
WOMEN WISHING TO ENTER OR RE-ENTER THE<br />
LABOUR FORCE AFTER A PERIOD OF DOMESTIC<br />
RESPONSIBILITY,<br />
THIS COMING YEAR WILL ALSO SEE THE BEGINNING<br />
OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE GOVERNMENT'S NEW PROGRAM<br />
FOR THE CARE AND EDUCATION OF YOUNG CHILDREN, IN NO<br />
OTHER COUNTRY IN THE WORLD HAS SUCH AN AMBITIOUS PROGRAM<br />
BEEN ATTEMPTED, THIS PROGRAM RECOGNISES THE NEED FOR<br />
EDUCATIONAL, HEALTH AND WELFARE COMPONENTS IN CHILD<br />
CARE; IT RECOGNISES THE NEED FOR THESE SAME SERVICES<br />
FOR CHILDREN WHETHER THEY BE LOOKED AFTER AT HOME OR<br />
ELSEWHERE, IT WILL BREAK DOWN THE TRADITIONAL<br />
DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN OCCASIONAL CARE AND REGULAR CARE,<br />
BETWEEN PRE-SCHOOL EDUCATION AND CHILD MINDING, ALL<br />
CHILDREN WHETHER THEY BE LOOKED AFTER AT HOME OR<br />
ELSEWHERE WILL HAVE ACCESS TO LOCAL CENTRES DESIGNED<br />
TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR EDUCATIONAL, HEALTH, PSYCHOLOGICAL<br />
AND OTHER NEEDS, THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS PROGRAM<br />
WILL PLACE AUSTRALIA AMONGST THOSE COUNTRIES MOST<br />
GENUINELY CONCERNED WITH WELFARE OF THE YOUNG.<br />
FURTHERMORE, THE SCHOOLS COMMISSION HAS<br />
ESTABLISHED A COMMITTEE TO LOOK INTO THE RELATION<br />
BETWEEN SOCIAL CHANGE AND THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN<br />
AND GIRLS, RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THIS COMMITTEE .17 </p>
<p>-7-<br />
' WILL BE INCLUDED IN THE REPORT TO BE PRESENTED TO<br />
PARLIAMENT IN THE COURSE OF NEXT YEAR, IT3 TERMS OF<br />
REFERENCE ARE FAR-REACHING AND ITS TASK A DIFFICULT ONE,<br />
FOR NOT ONLY MUST IT PINPOINT THOSE AREAS OF EDUCATION<br />
WITHIN WHICH WOMEN ARE DISADVANTAGED, BUT IT MUST ALSO<br />
MAKE SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE ACTION,<br />
MANY OTHER GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS HAVE<br />
PROGRAMS PLANNED FOR THE COMING YEAR,<br />
IN THE FIELD OF WOMEN'S HEALTH, THE FIRST,<br />
AND BASIC, INIATIVE TAKEN BY THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN<br />
THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE LEICHHARDT WOMEN'S COMMUNITY<br />
HEALTH CENTRE IN SYDNEY, THE AIM OF THI. S CENTRE IS TO<br />
S MEET A NEED EXPRESSED BY WOMEN FOR A HEALTH SERVICE<br />
STAFFED BY WOMEN DIRECTED SOLELY TOWARDS THE SPECIAL<br />
HEALTH NEEDS OF WOMEN, THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT INIATIVE<br />
OF A COMPLETELY NEW DIMENSION DERIVING DIRECTLY FROM<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT'S BROAD POLICY PERSPECTIVES<br />
AND THE COMMUNITY HEALTH PROGRAM WILL BE ACTIVELY<br />
DEVELOPED TO GIVE IT PRIORITY,<br />
GREATER PARTICIPATION BY, WOMEN AT ALL LEVELS<br />
OF HEALTH CARE PLANNING, DELIVERY AND ADMINISTRATION<br />
IS BEING ACTIVELY PROMOTED AND THIS POLICY IS PROVIDING<br />
WOMEN WITH INCREASING OPPORTUNITIES OF INFLUENCING THE<br />
DIRECTION WHICH HEALTH CARE IS TAKING IN THE COMMUNITY, / 8 </p>
<p>-8-<br />
IN THE FIELD OF ABORIGINAL HEALTH, ABORIGINAL<br />
WOMEN ARE BEING INVOLVED TO AN INCREASING DEGREE IN THE<br />
DELIVERY OF HEALTH CARE TO THEIR OWN PEOPLE.<br />
THE INITIATIVE OF MY GOVERNMENT WHICH MAY<br />
HAVE THE MOST FAR-REACHING CONSEQUENCES IS THE<br />
ESTABLISHMENT OF A ROYAL COMMISSION INTO HUMAN<br />
RELATIONSHIPS. IT IS THE TASK OF THIS COMMISSION TO<br />
INVESTIGATE THE STRESSES THAT SOCIETY PLACES UPON<br />
RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN PEOPLE, IN WHAT WAYS INADEQUATE<br />
HOUSING, INSUFFICIENT MONEY, TOO MANY OR TOO FEW<br />
CHILDREN, THE AVAILABILITY OR OTHERWISE OF CONTRACEPTIVE<br />
COUNSELLING AND THE ADEQUACY OF MEDICAL CARE AFFECT<br />
PEOPLE AND THEIR RELATIONSHIPS. THIS COMMISSION HAS<br />
BEEN ASKED TO PRESENT REGULAR INTERIM REPORTS AND HENCE<br />
WILL ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO THE SUCCESS OF THE COMING YEAR.<br />
WE MUST HOWEVER ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE INEQUALITY<br />
OF WOMEN'S POSITION IN SOCIETY IS DEEPLY EMBEDDED NOT<br />
JUST IN THE INSTITUTIONS BUT ALSO IN THE PSYCHOLOGY OF<br />
THE SOCIETY. IN THIS RESPECT THOSE WOMEN'S ORGANISATIONS<br />
ARE CORRECT WHICH SAY THAT THE FIRST AND FUNDAMENTAL STEP<br />
TOWARDS FREEDOM IS AWARENESS BY WOMEN THEMSELVES OF THEIR<br />
REAL INEQUALITY, OF THE EXTENT OF THEIR SOCIAL, POLITICAL,<br />
ECONOMIC AND CULTURAL DISCRIMINATION AND DEPRIVATION. ,/ 9<br />
i-</p>
<p>-9-<br />
I HAVE MENTIONED THE GENERAL RESPONSIBILITY<br />
THAT THE NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE HAS FOR DEVELOPING<br />
THEMES AND PROGRAMS FOR THE YEAR WHICH WILL BE OF BENEFIT<br />
TO ALL WOMEN IN AUSTRALIA, WHATEVER THEIR EDUCATION, THEIR<br />
CULTURAL BACKGROUND, THEIR ECONOMIC STATUS, THEIR<br />
OCCUPATION, THEIR BELIEFS OR THEIR WAY OF LIFE. IN SO<br />
DOING YOU ALSO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TACKLE THIS<br />
BASIC PROBLEM OF EMBEDDED ATTITUDES NOT ONLY BY<br />
ENCOURAGING THE GROWTH OF COMMUNITY ACTIVITY IN AREAS<br />
AFFECTING WOMEN BUT ALSO BY GIVING A SIGNIFICANT BOOST<br />
' TO THE LEVEL OF AWARENESS AMONGST WOMEN AND MEN OF THE<br />
EXTENT OF THESE PROBLEMS.<br />
IT IS FOR THIS REASON AND BECA'USE OF OUR<br />
COMMITMENT TO CHANGE IN THIS AREA THAT MY GOVERNMENT<br />
IS DETERMINED THAT SUFFICIENT TIME AND FUNDS BE<br />
AVAILABLE TO ACHIEVE THESE ENDS AND IT IS ALSO FOR<br />
THIS REASON THAT MUCH TIME AND THOUGHT WENT INTO THE<br />
MEMBERSHIP OF THE NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE. WE<br />
WANTED, AND WE HAVE, A GROUP OF PEOPLE WHOSE UNIQUE<br />
EXPERTISE AND EXPERIENCE IS DEEPLY GROUNDED IN THEIR<br />
UNDERSTANDING OF AND DEMONSTRATED COMMITMENT TO?. AUSTRALIAN<br />
WOMEN, THEIR PRESENT AND THEIR FUTURE. </p>
