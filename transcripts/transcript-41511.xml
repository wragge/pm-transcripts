    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong></p>
<p>President Widodo, it’s wonderful to be here with you, with our Foreign Ministers in Julie Bishop and Retno Marsudi.</p>
<p>I just want to say to all of you here - I was just saying to the President who came down with us; the great success of Australia as a multicultural nation – and it is a remarkable success – is because we are united by political values. Which are of freedom, democracy, the rule of law, equality of men and women and mutual respect.</p>
<p>And it is that respect which the President embodies in the leadership he shows when he says that Indonesia proves that democracy, Islam, moderation, respect are absolutely compatible.</p>
<p>Standing next to me is one of the most important leaders and role models in the world today, I’m so honoured to be with him today. He’s a dear friend, as is Iriana, a dear friend of Lucy’s and we had a beautiful dinner last night at home.</p>
<p>So Jokowi, welcome.</p>
<p><strong>HIS EXCELLENCY MR JOKO WIDODO, PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA:  </strong></p>
<p>Good morning, I’m happy to meet all of you, the young generation of Indonesia and Australia in Sydney.</p>
<p>So why are the Australian Prime Minister and myself, the President of Indonesia, here to meet you today in the middle of our busy ASEAN-Australia Summit Schedule? Because you are the future.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong></p>
<p>Yes, you are.</p>
<p><strong>PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA: </strong></p>
<p>You will one day lead the country and lead the world.</p>
<p>Both Indonesia and Australia are multicultural societies. Being a diverse society is beautiful; it will be beautiful if we all respect each other.</p>
<p>I hope from you, young age, you adapt the value of tolerance and peace. We need millions of ambassadors like yourself to spread values of tolerance and peace.</p>
<p>We need a million of bridge builders like yourself to connect different people from all over the world.</p>
<p>So enjoy your networking here, make friends, for the Indonesian students here today, and enjoy your stay in Sydney.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
