General Cosgrove, Assistant Defence Minister Mal Brough, Wing Commander, ladies and gentlemen. It is of course, now Anzac Day back home and I think it';s just terrific that I';ve had the opportunity here tonight in Dohar to present these Active Service Medals to a representative group of defence personnel. I want to thank all of you on behalf of the Australian people for the fantastic job you continue to do in our interest and on our behalf and you are not forgotten. You are greatly revered and admired. There are 2,000 men and women serving in the Australian defence forces in different parts of the world. There is naturally and very understandably a special focus on what is occurring in and around Iraq and you are very much in the thoughts and the hearts of all of the Australian people. You do a great job. You bring us great honour. We wish you well and our thoughts and prayers stay very much with you and thank you very much. And I look forward to meeting as many of you as I can tonight over something that is very Australian - a barbecue.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
