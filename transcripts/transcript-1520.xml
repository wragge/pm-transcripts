FOR PRESS: P. M. No. 40/ 1967<br />
AUSTRALIAN HELP FOR ITALIAN FLOOD RESTORATION<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr. Harold Holt<br />
The Commonwealth Government will provide an<br />
amount of $ 30, 000 to assist in restoration work made necessary by the<br />
disastrous floods in Italy last year.<br />
Australia will undertake the restoration of one room in<br />
the National Library of Italy in Florence together with its contents which<br />
were extensively damaged. The services of a restoration expert will also be<br />
provided to help restore paintings damaged in the floods.<br />
In this way, Australia will be playing its part in<br />
helping to preserve the cultural heritage not only of Italy but of Western<br />
civilization.<br />
