AUSTRALIAN INTERNATIONAL AWARDS SCHEME<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam. announced<br />
today the intention of the Australian Government to<br />
increase the number of Australian International Awards<br />
( AIAS) for Commonwealth Carribean countries to<br />
approximately ten each year. Nominations for awards<br />
would generally be for short-term specialist and<br />
post-graduate studies although undergraduate nominations<br />
would be considered in special cases. The Australian<br />
Government would wish to honor the priorities set by the<br />
nominating Government on types of training. It will<br />
consider and attempt placement in virtually any field<br />
which can be defined as contributing to economic and<br />
social development.<br />
