    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Shadow Minister for Work, Family and Community, Tanya Plibersek MP, has misrepresented my answer to a question in Parliament today.</p>
<p>  Ms Plibersek asked me whether, under the welfare to work changes, a single mother with a seven-year-old child would be subject to penalties if she did not take a job because she could not find child care.</p>
<p>   I responded that I understood the rules to be applied are those applied to Newstart Allowance.  Under these rules, Centrelink decides whether a penalty applies to a job seeker who does not take up a job offer, and does not apply a penalty if the job seeker has a good reason for not taking the job.</p>
<p>  This will continue to apply under the new arrangements.  If no suitable child care is available, or the cost of care would result in a very low or negative financial gain from working, the parent will not be required to accept the job.</p>
