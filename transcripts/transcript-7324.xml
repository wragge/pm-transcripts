CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH FOR THE<br />
PRIME MINISTER'S OLYMPIC DINNER 11<br />
MELBOURNE 20 MAY 1988<br />
Kevan Gosper,<br />
Don Trescowthick,<br />
Olympic Champions of the Past and<br />
Competitors of the Future,<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen.<br />
Hazel and I are very pleased to welcome you to the Prime<br />
Minister's Olympic Dinner.<br />
I suppose this is the closest most of us wi-ll ever get to<br />
appearing on centre court at the National Tennis Centre<br />
even if we are wielding knives and forks rather than tennis<br />
racquets. I congratulate the organisers for creating such a successful<br />
dinner. This is the biggest fundraising event in Australia's<br />
sporting history.<br />
Your presence here tonight has raised more than one million<br />
dollars towards the cost of sending Australia's team to the<br />
Olympics this year.<br />
That's on top of the two million dollars which the Federal<br />
Government is contributing.<br />
That provides a tremendous springboard for the effort of<br />
raising ten million dollars to cover the costs of sending<br />
our team to Calgary for the winter Olympics and to Seoul for<br />
the Summer Olympics in September.<br />
Australia's got a tremendous record of achievement in the<br />
Olympic Games and a proud record of support for the<br />
Olympic cause.<br />
We're one of only three nations to have participated at<br />
every Olympic Games. 582 </p>
<p>in 1956 we hosted one of the friendliest and most successful<br />
Games ever held.<br />
And a: look * aro~ nd' Che'tablts at -the Olympic medal winneris<br />
. Who. are h. ret6ni ght shows that we have produced a great<br />
crop of Olympic champions and it is our belief that we can<br />
continue to add to the ranks of those champions.<br />
This year we're sending to Seoul our largest Olympic team<br />
ever a team of 290 sportsmen and sportswomen supported by<br />
officials for a total contingent of about 370 people.<br />
Among them are the champions of the future -men and women<br />
capable of bringing home gold to Australia.<br />
All of them, drawn from the cream of Australian sports,<br />
represent the finest exponents of the Olympic spirit:<br />
friendly competition in pursuit of excellence.<br />
Damon Runyon said, " it may be that the race is not always to<br />
the swift, nor the battle to the strong but tha( E-is the<br />
way to bet.' Runyon's words, cynical though they.~ Iay sound,<br />
indicate the increasingly tough and competitive world our<br />
Olympic sportsmen and women face. But we have thrown up<br />
champions against the odds before and I am sure we will do'<br />
so again.<br />
our team is already hard at work, preparing themselves<br />
mentally and physically for what will probably be the<br />
greatest sporting event of their careers.<br />
It's up to the rest of us to help them with that work to<br />
lend our support to the fundraising effort to ensure a<br />
successful mission to Seoul.<br />
For ultimately, sending a team of this size and calibre to<br />
an Olympics is not something governments can, or should, do<br />
alone. The effort should be a co-operative one.<br />
It should involve private companies, community organisations<br />
and individuals.<br />
Tonight's success can give us confidence that we will get<br />
that involvement and that together we will send to Seoul the<br />
best prepared and best equipped team Australia has ever sent<br />
to any Olympics.<br />
So it gives me great pleasure now to launch the 1988<br />
Olympathon. 0 0 6~ 5 8 3 </p>
<p>Ladies and Gentlemen,<br />
I referred a few minutes ago to the 1956 Games, held in this<br />
city, and we have just seen Debbie Flintoff light the torch<br />
which burned throughout those games.<br />
As you all know, a number of Australian cities, including<br />
Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane, have expressed some interest<br />
in hosting the 1996 Games.<br />
I'm not in a position now I don't think anyone i s to<br />
express support for the bid by any of these cities. It's<br />
still a very long way down the track.<br />
But at this stage we can at least agree that it is very<br />
pleasing to see the interest and enthusiasm being generated<br />
throughout Australia about the possibility of hosting<br />
another Olympic Games, whether it be in 1996 or at a later<br />
time. In the day to day grind of our lives it is often easier to<br />
focus on those things that divide us as a commuility."<br />
But events such as the Olympics whether hosting them or<br />
participating in them remind us of the far more important<br />
qualities we share how very much we all have in common.<br />
At its best, the Olympic spirit offers the world a unique<br />
and compelling alternative, a reminder of how ifisignificant<br />
are our differences and how overwhelmingly logical it is to<br />
promote where possible constructive and friendly<br />
co-operation throughout the world.<br />
It's fitting that, as the Patron in Chief of the National<br />
Appeal Committee of the Australian Confederation of sport<br />
for the Disabled, I recall at this dinner the fact that in<br />
Seoul, Australia will also be represented by about 200<br />
disabled athletes who will be competing in the Summer<br />
Paralympics. I'm sure I speak for you all in wishing them<br />
well both in their fundraising effort and in their athletic<br />
performances at the Paralympics.<br />
So in every way, the Olympics represent the best in<br />
Australian sporting prowess our commitment to excellence<br />
at the highest level.<br />
Our athletes go to Seoul to compete with pride and they take<br />
with them the hopes of their fellow Australians, the best<br />
wishes of the whole Australian community, and through this<br />
Olympathon the total community support they need and<br />
deserve. 6 58 4 </p>
