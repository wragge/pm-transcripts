    <content><![CDATA[<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Now Prime Minister, you have had a chance to talk to your compatriot</p>
<p>   over in Papua New Guinea, Mr Skate. Can you tell us, having seen</p>
<p>   the devastation, what his opinion of it is?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well he's appalled. I spoke to him yesterday and he, of course,</p>
<p>   is absolutely devastated and overcome by this calamity that has</p>
<p>   hit his country. I am pleased to say that the mobile hospital team</p>
<p>   from Australia is now in place in the worst affected area. I was</p>
<p>   informed a few moments ago that the roads into that area are now</p>
<p>   open so that it is possible to get assistance in and to look after</p>
<p>   the survivors more effectively. The latest indications are that</p>
<p>   the death toll could be 1000 or more. Given the chaos in a tragic</p>
<p>   situation like this, it's very hard to make an accurate count.</p>
<p>   I know that all Australians will feel for the people of Papua New</p>
<p>   Guinea in this most appalling natural disaster. As a country, as</p>
<p>   a close friend and neighbour and helper we will do all we can to</p>
<p>   help the very unfortunate people of this country whose living standard</p>
<p>   is low and they now have visited upon them this terrible, personal</p>
<p>   disaster.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>And our defence forces, what role will they play.....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>well we already have three C130's in the country. Another</p>
<p>   one is on the way and our defence personnel, as always, have responded</p>
<p>   quickly and effectively, quite magnificently. And on behalf of the</p>
<p>   Australian people I congratulate the ADF on their speedy response</p>
<p>   and the effective humanitarian way in which they're rendering</p>
<p>   assistance to these very unfortunate people.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>With the roads reopening would you expect that relief to get through</p>
<p>   virtually unimpeded or mostly.......</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well the information I have is that with the roads being opened</p>
<p>   it's easier to get help in and it's easier to carry the</p>
<p>   injured and maimed people, many of whom have very severe fractures,</p>
<p>   out of the area and perhaps treat them in hospitals elsewhere in</p>
<p>   the country. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>And Mr Skate's response to Australia offering.....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well yesterday when I spoke to him, Mr Skate was very grateful</p>
<p>   for the speedyr Skate was very grateful</p>
<p>   for the speedy way in which Australia had responded and I know that</p>
<p>   I'll be speaking to him again in the next couple of days. We</p>
<p>   are very keen to help in whatever practical way possible.</p>
<p>  [ENDS] </p>
