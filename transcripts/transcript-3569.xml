DARWIN EMERGENCY: MESSAGE FROM STATE PREMIERS<br />
The Prime Minister's office has released the text of<br />
messages received today from the Victorian and Western Australian<br />
Premiers offering assistance in the Darwin emergency.<br />
Mr. Hamer's message reads: " I am happy to offer any<br />
resources of the Victorian Government which may be of use in<br />
the Darwin disaster. These resources include emergency<br />
accommodation, medical help, hospital facilities and technical<br />
assistance. Please advise me of any help required through<br />
our State Emergency Service or Disaster Control Victoria Police."<br />
Sir Charles Court's message reads: " As a State which<br />
has felt the devastation and the anguish of cyclones on many<br />
occasions we can understand the feelings of the Darwin people<br />
at this time. All Western Australians send their deepest<br />
sympathy and assurance that any assistance we can give is<br />
available for the mere asking. Please advise if there is any<br />
way you feel we can help. We have many people experienced in<br />
cyclone damage emergencies."<br />
