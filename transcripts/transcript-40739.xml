    <content><![CDATA[<p>Australia condemns North Korea’s latest ballistic missile launch which is a clear breach of United Nations Security Council Resolutions and a further threat to regional and global peace and stability.</p>
<p>Australia calls on North Korea to cease its provocative behaviour, abandon its nuclear and missile programs and engage constructively with the international community.  There is a pressing need to improve the welfare of North Korea’s impoverished people, rather than divert resources to develop nuclear weapons and missiles.</p>
<p>On 30 November, Australia co-sponsored UN Security Council Resolution 2321 which placed additional UN sanctions on North Korea.  Further sanctions on North Korea are under consideration.</p>
<p>We will work with the international community in response to North Korea’s actions.  We support efforts to forge regional and multilateral solutions to enhance security across the Indo-Pacific and deal with this threat.</p>
<p>Australia will continue autonomous sanctions against North Korea.  We will work with the Republic of Korea, Japan, China, and our other friends and partners to increase the cost to North Korea of its continuing reckless and dangerous conduct.</p>
