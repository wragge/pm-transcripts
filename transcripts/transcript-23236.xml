    <content><![CDATA[<p>As Parliament comes back, I want to stress our plan to build a strong, prosperous economy.</p>
<p>That plan is about creating more jobs with lower taxes, less red tape and policies that encourage everyone to “have a go”.</p>
<p>These are our commitments and we are implementing them.</p>
<p>Already the Government has given environmental approval to $400 billion in new projects and that means more jobs and more exports.</p>
<p>The Commission of Audit is underway to give you better value for your tax dollars.</p>
<p>In March, the Parliament will dedicate a day to repealing red tape – making life easier and less costly for everyone and in May, the Budget will be handed down to address Labor’s $667 billion debt legacy.</p>
<p>By July, Labor’s Carbon Tax and the Mining Tax should be history – especially if Labor wakes up to itself.</p>
<p>We’re working with the states to build the infrastructure of the 21st century.</p>
<p>We’re working on free trade agreements with our key trading partners and, importantly, we’re bringing back the Australian Building and Construction Commission – as the tough cop on the beat in that troubled industry.</p>
<p>We don’t want honest workers to be ripped off by dishonest union bosses.</p>
<p>So that’s the plan that the Parliament should support and it’s a plan that will strengthen the economy and allow families and small businesses to plan their future with confidence.</p>
