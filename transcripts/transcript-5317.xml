PRIME MINISTER THURSDAY 3. APRiL A19' 8O<br />
From the Press Office, f: S<br />
SUMMARY OF 12.30 NEWS<br />
The Opposition Spokesman on Health, Dr. Blewit vac e ' o<br />
searching enquiry into the Department of Health idiscd'r how<br />
computer error, resulting in overpayment of pharm sts remained<br />
undiscovered for so long. The Minister for Health told Parliament<br />
last night that chemists have been overpaid by the Federal Government<br />
by as much as $ 235 million in the past seven years. Dr. Blewitt<br />
said there was now severe doubt about the Department's ability to<br />
supervise the payments. He said it was unpardonable that the error<br />
had remained undiscovered for so long and he called for much more<br />
searching reviews of pharmacy payments in the future.<br />
Dr. Blewitt<br />
It is quite clear that we need a much more searching enquiry<br />
particularly into the supervisory abilities of the Department of<br />
Health. Because an overpayment of this size of something like<br />
or 60 cents per prescription is of such a nature that I think<br />
it's unpardonable that the Department was not aware at least of<br />
the problem-even if it wasn't clear about the source or the size of<br />
the problem.<br />
The Minister for Health, Mr. MacKellar said today that steps had<br />
been taken to ensure that overpayments to chemists by the Federal<br />
Government did not continue. The error was caused by lack of<br />
testing procedures when the pharmaceutical benefits scheme was<br />
computerised in 1972-73. Mr. MacKellar said the Department of Health<br />
had instituted more testing procedures as computer programmes<br />
were developed. As a result of the Public Service Board Enquiry<br />
which revealed the mistake other Government Departments have been<br />
advised to make sure that they had similar programming checks.<br />
The Attorney General's office has advised the Government that the<br />
overpayment to chemists cannot be recovered by law.<br />
Latest reports from Bristol say the rioters have now dispersed after<br />
police units armed with riot shields moved back into the St. Pauls<br />
area in what the Press Association describes as a massive show of<br />
co-ordinated force. This followed more than 6 hours of rioting by<br />
about 400 young West Indians who went on the rampage through the<br />
predominantly black district burning, looting and fighting police.<br />
The violence began after police raided a club suspected of illegal<br />
dealing in drugs in liquor. 25 police were reported injured but<br />
none seriously.<br />
The French Government has unveiled plans for nuclear power to<br />
reduce the role of oil to 30 per cent of the country's energy needs<br />
by 1990. France currently depends on oil for 56 per cent of its<br />
energy. Under the multi million dollar plan nuclear power will be<br />
expected to provide 30 per cent of energy needs by. 1990 compared<br />
with less than 5 per cent last year. The plan also calls for far<br />
reaching energy saving measures during the next decade in industry,<br />
housing, offices, transportation and electricity. More than $ 15,000<br />
million are to be invested in industry to reduce oil consumption.<br />
The uranium company P an Continental Mining has denied entering into<br />
firm contracts with a Japanese company for the sale of yellow cake<br />
from its Jabaluka deposit. Pan Continental's Chairman, Mr. Grey<br />
in a statement today said the company was well aware it could not </p>
<p>negotiate sales contracts until the Jabaluka project received the<br />
Government approval. Mr. Grey said his company had been very<br />
embarrassed by recent statements attributed to the Japanese company<br />
that it had been given exclusive rights for the sale of Jabaluka<br />
uranium in Japan. Mr. Grey said the Japanese company had been<br />
approved as Pan Continental's sole marketing agent but only if and<br />
when the governments gave the go-ahead for Jabaluka. No sales<br />
contracts could be entered into without this approval.<br />
In response to Iran's demands over the American hostages, President<br />
Carter has given a more forceful pledge that the United States will<br />
be restrained in words and actions as long as progress is being<br />
made to end the crisis. Mr. Jody Powell read a statement the day<br />
after Dr. Bani Sadr had insisted on a formal statement that the US<br />
would refrain from provocation or propaganda against Iran.<br />
