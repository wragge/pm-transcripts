EMBARGOED UNITIL DELIVERY,<br />
PARLIAMENTARY STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
ON THE ECONOMY AND EMPLOYMENT<br />
THURSDAY, 14 NOVEMBER 1991<br />
Mr Speaker, A~<br />
Australia today is at a point of t"* storic ~ onvergenq6 the<br />
hurt of the recession is at its Pbint of maximum impact;<br />
yet, simultaneously, and by no me" 4 Voinc~ tfbal the<br />
gains and rewards of the long hard 99ss o6 btructuring<br />
are within our grasp.<br />
The immediate focus of this Statement is on the problem of<br />
unemployment. But through that prism, I want today to look<br />
ahead to the prospects and promise for this nation.<br />
In this Statement today I bring to the people of Australia a<br />
message of fundamental confidence. It is a message grounded<br />
firmly on the facts, not only the factual evidence of<br />
recovery, but: upon the most important fact of all that the<br />
work of this Government over the years, and the response of<br />
the Australian people, have brought us together to the<br />
threshold of a new era of achievement.<br />
In the specific context of unemployment, let me begin with<br />
this unqualified assertion: this Labor Government has an<br />
unalterable commitment to preventing the present levels of<br />
unemployment from becoming a permanent feature of the<br />
Australian economy and the Australian society. I say to<br />
this House what I have said repeatedly outside: I have not<br />
spent the whole of my thirty-three years in public life in<br />
the Labor Movement of Australia to acquiesce in allowing the<br />
present high levels of unemployment to continue.<br />
Mr Speaker,<br />
Some weeks ago, I initiated an examination of what action<br />
the Government could take to respond to the current severe<br />
unemployment situation. In the same period, the<br />
ParliamentaryF Labor Party's Working Group on Unemployment<br />
under the Chairmanship of the Honourable Member for Page, Mr7<br />
Harry Woods, has worked with great diligence to produce a<br />
constructive report. Further, in accordance with<br />
undertakings I gave in my address to the ACTU Congress in<br />
September, I met with representatives of the ACTU on<br />
29 October to consider their proposals to alleviate<br />
unemployment. I have also had the benefit of consultation<br />
within the Economic Planning Advisory Council.<br />
As an outcome of our analyses and these consultations, I<br />
shall be detailing, later in this Statement, measures<br />
related to the unemployment problem.<br />
These measures build on the strategy for reducing<br />
unemployment already put in place by the Budget. </p>
<p>2.<br />
The measures include:<br />
initiatives in the post-secondary area to ensure<br />
that our young men and women have access to<br />
training, in the long-term-as well as in the<br />
shorttp-rm. High quality investment in additional<br />
training now will deliver a workforce better<br />
suited to the challenges of the future;<br />
a further expansion of labour market programs to<br />
assist the unemployed obtain and upgrade skills.<br />
This will not only help prepare for the recovery<br />
but will ensure a proper safety net is provided<br />
for those who have been most affected by the<br />
recession; the acceleration of infrastructure projects in the<br />
areas of road. rail, post-secondary education, and<br />
snienca, with benefits for our traded goods<br />
industries and for the quality of teaching and<br />
research in our educational and scientific<br />
institutions; and<br />
facilitation of the development of new industries<br />
and restructuring of existing industries.<br />
These measures total some $ 313 million in calendar year<br />
1992. They are measures which meet the critical tests of<br />
advancing our economic strategy, while maintaining the<br />
integrity of the Budget.<br />
Since the Budget, we have been carefully watching economic<br />
developments to ensure that the Budget strategy for<br />
sustainable recovery with low inflation is on track. It is<br />
on track, and we are determined that it stay on track. This<br />
Government will not be diverted from its fundamental<br />
economic strategy and its goals:<br />
sustainable recovery to provide sustainable job<br />
growth, and rising living standards<br />
and, above all, the goal of building an<br />
internationally competitive economy.<br />
Mr Speaker,<br />
There may be some who would argue that the Government,<br />
satisfied as we are that the fundamental economic strategy<br />
is on track, should pay no regard to the representations of<br />
the ACTU, and others, on the matters dealt with in this<br />
Statement. </p>
<p>Not only do 3: reject that argument, but I go further. The<br />
very fact that our strategy is on track the fact that the<br />
great objective of creating a restructured, low inflation,<br />
international~ ly competitive, economy is now within our grasp<br />
is in larget measure a result of the constructive cooperation<br />
and restraint that has been practised by the<br />
working men and women of Australia. That is, precisely, a<br />
reason to listen to those who represent them.<br />
Their members have experienced unemployment, not only<br />
through the recession, but through the process of long-term<br />
industrial restructuring we are pursuing.<br />
Yet in the representations they have made to us they have<br />
not asked for this process to be slowed. They understand,<br />
accept and are committed to its continuation, in the<br />
knowledge that it is in the long-term interest of their<br />
country. And, of course, Mr Speaker, the views of the union movement<br />
reflect the growing concern at all levels of the community,<br />
as the statistical projection of unemployment of more than<br />
per cent, made in May, has become the harsh reality.<br />
Nobody feels this concern more deeply than I. It is a<br />
concern fully shared by every member of my Government. That<br />
is why we accept it as our inescapable duty to take whatever<br />
action we responsibly can to restore sustainable job growth<br />
as soon as possible.<br />
Given this Government's unsurpassed record of job creation<br />
since 1983, there can be no doubt about our commitment to<br />
this goal and our capacity to achieve it. This is a<br />
Government which from its inception has been absolutely<br />
committed to sustainable job growth.<br />
Mr Speaker,<br />
Budget-time forecasts were for growth of around<br />
3 3/ 4 per cent through the course of 1991-92. The main<br />
sources Of gr. owth were expected to be business restocking,<br />
housing investment, and moderate growth in private<br />
consumption. Net exports were also expected to contribute<br />
to growth. I<br />
Indicators available since the Budget support those<br />
forecasts: we are coming out of recession. The early<br />
stages of recovery are clearly evident in the trend growth<br />
now apparent in the housing and retail sectors, and there<br />
are now positive signs pointing to recovery in other<br />
sectors. BuiLlding approvals for private dwellings increased<br />
by around 15 per cent in the September quarter. Retail<br />
sales have shown renewed strength, growing by 2.9 per cent<br />
in real term.; in the September quarter. Indexes of consumer<br />
sentiment are significantly above their levels of a year<br />
ago. Business surveys indicate that the outlook for sales,<br />
profits, and investment is beginning to improve. </p>
<p>Our international trading performance has improved markedly.<br />
We are on track to record a current account deficit in the<br />
order of $ 14 billion in 1991-92, considerably lower than in<br />
recent years both in absolute terms and as a proportion of<br />
GDP. While unemployment has reached unacceptable levels, the<br />
level of employment has stabilised in the last four months,<br />
halting the falls in employment that have been occurring<br />
since mid-1990. The recent improving trend in full-time<br />
employment is encouraging.<br />
All this is consistent with the view that the economy is in<br />
the early stages of recovery. This is not to deny that<br />
unemployment may rise further. But the essential point is<br />
that the evidence of the recovery has begun to appear.<br />
Mr Speaker,<br />
A central objective of the Budget strategy is to ensure<br />
that, as the recovery proceeds, the Budget will move back<br />
into surplus. This will free national savings for<br />
productive investment by the private sector. In this way,<br />
the current account will be safeguarded and the economy set<br />
on a sustainable growth path.<br />
Since the Budget was drawn up, the immediate risk that<br />
private calls on national savings would grow faster than<br />
public calls were falling has lessened. This lessening is<br />
attributable to two main factors:<br />
first, the forecast reductions in inflation have<br />
been factored into community expectations more<br />
rapidly than we had hoped;<br />
and second, there has been a worsening of the<br />
drought, leading us to be less sanguine about<br />
prospects for the rural sector.<br />
These domestic developments have taken place against the<br />
background of some uncertainties about the economic<br />
prospects for our major trading partners.<br />
The changes have not been of a magnitude to cause us to<br />
revise the Budget forecasts for overall activity. However,<br />
they have reduced the risk that any supplementary measures<br />
would see the public sector's call on national resources<br />
become unsustainably high. This reduced risk is<br />
particularly true of measures targetted to the period<br />
immediately ahead.<br />
In short, there is now some scope to do more to prepare for<br />
new jobs and opportunities.<br />
But, Mr Speaker, we must continue to recognise the limits<br />
which responsible economic management imposes, at this<br />
critical point in the recovery. </p>
<p>To fail to doi so would be to throw away the real gains which<br />
underlie the present economic situation, and which underpin<br />
the splendid prospects ahead for this nation, as a strong,<br />
competitive, low inflation economy, enmeshing itself in the<br />
economies of the world's fastest growing region.<br />
To maximise the benefit to the economy at this stage of the<br />
cycle, the measures I announce today are concentrated in<br />
calendar year 1992, and wherever possible, in the first half<br />
of 1992.<br />
EDUCAT ION AND TAIN~ ING<br />
Mr Speaker,<br />
I have said that a major thrust of these measures is<br />
directed towards expansion of education and training<br />
programs. In this area, I announce today proposals involving gross<br />
expenditure in calendar year 1992 of $ 130 million.<br />
Education and. training are basic to the Government's<br />
strategy of building a competitive Australia. And they are<br />
basic to the more immediate hopes and aspirations of many<br />
thousands of individual Australians, especially among our<br />
young people.<br />
Community demand for education and training is at its<br />
highest level ever. The proportion of our young people<br />
remaining to the end of secondary school has virtually<br />
doubled in a decade and student numbers at our universities<br />
have risen by over 50 per cent.<br />
A different situation, however, applies in vocational<br />
education and training, including TAFE. While student<br />
demand for TAFE and training has continued to increase<br />
strongly, labour market conditions and budgetary priorities<br />
of State Governments, who have the responsibility in this<br />
area, have combined to limit the training opportunities made<br />
available in this essential sector. In consequence, the<br />
level of unmet demand for TAFE has risen steeply in recent<br />
years. This situation demands urgent action. I may say, Mr<br />
Speaker, that one of the major disappointments arising from<br />
the Premiers' decision not to attend the Special Premiers<br />
Conference in Perth next week is that it will make<br />
resolution of these problems even more difficult.<br />
The problem has been highlighted by the Finn Report on<br />
Post-compulsory Education and Training. The Finn Report<br />
poses major challenges for all Governments, State and<br />
Commonwealth. We must respond to these challenges. It is<br />
time TAFE took its rightful place within the education<br />
system of Australia. </p>
<p>The Government has decided to provide extra funding in 1992<br />
to enable additional enrolments in post-school education,<br />
mainly in TAFE. In total, a sum of $ 115 million will be<br />
provided for post-secondary education and training. A<br />
further $ 15 million in higher education capital funding will<br />
be brought forward from 1994. This additional funding will<br />
be allocated mainly to provide additional TAFE places, and<br />
to meet urgent needs for equipment and building<br />
refurbishment in both TAFE and universities.<br />
For 1992, the Government expects that these measures will<br />
provide an additional 40,000 students with opportunities to<br />
gain vocational skills. The States will be required at<br />
least to maintain their expenditure in real terms in 1992,<br />
pending the negotiation of longer term arrangements. They<br />
have also agreed to co-operate in maximising the number of<br />
places provided from the additional Commonwealth funding.<br />
Looking to the longer term, the Commonwealth will continue<br />
to pursue its offer to the States of a new set of funding<br />
arrangements for vocational education and training, designed<br />
to upgrade the capacity and status of our TAFE and training<br />
institutions. I see this as an urgent national priority.<br />
LABOUR MARKET PROG. RAMSq<br />
Mr Speaker, the unemployed have borne the heaviest cost of<br />
the recession. Despite the economic recovery which is now<br />
underway, the number of long-term unemployed will continue<br />
to rise for some time to come. If we are to harness in full<br />
the opportunities provided by recovery, we must strengthen<br />
the skills of job-seekers and particularly the long-term<br />
unemployed. It makes economic sense to do so by ensuring<br />
that skills shortages do not emerge during the recovery.<br />
More importantly, social justice demands that we do so.<br />
Today, I announce enhancements to the Employment Access<br />
Program, Skillshare and the Self-Employment Assistance<br />
program to enable larger numbers of the long-term unemployed<br />
to obtain the skills needed to take advantage of new job and<br />
business opportunities as these emerge from the recovery.<br />
The enhancements will provide increased opportunities for<br />
some 56,000 unemployed people in 1992, including:<br />
an increase in training places that will prepare an<br />
additional 31,000 people for labour market re-entry;<br />
an increase in the JOBSTART program, providing an<br />
additional 15,500 job subsidy placements;<br />
an increase in the Special Intervention Program to<br />
provide an additional 9,000 especially disadvantaged<br />
with assistance early in their period of unemployment. </p>
<p>With these enhancements, in addition to those announced with<br />
the implementation of the Newstart Program, at least 300,000<br />
unemployed people will be assisted by the CES through labour<br />
market programns in 1992.<br />
This additional assistance will involve gross expenditure of<br />
$ 78 million in 1991/ 92, and $ 124 million in 1992/ 93. This<br />
will raise total labour market program expenditure from<br />
$ 400 million in 1990/ 91 to an estimated $ 774 million in<br />
1992/ 93.<br />
ACCELERATION OF INFRASTRUCTURP SPENDING<br />
We have ident~ ified areas where some major Commonwealth<br />
infrastructure spending could be accelerated spending<br />
which would have occurred anyway because of its essential<br />
nature or high economic returns for the nation.<br />
Today I announce expenditures totalling $ 112 million in<br />
calendar year7 1992 to improve our economic infrastructure.<br />
Such improvements will bear directly on the competitiveness<br />
of our export: sector.<br />
The task of internationalising the Australian economy<br />
requires an internationally competitive transport<br />
infrastructu3: e. This year, we have made major advances in<br />
this area with the establishment of the National Rail<br />
Corporation; the National Road Transport Commission; and<br />
continuing rapid reform of our shipping industry and<br />
dramatic developments in the reform of our waterfront<br />
industry.<br />
We will bring forward $ 82 million of roads expenditure on<br />
the National Highway System and Arterial roads, and provide<br />
million for what will become the rail network of the<br />
NRC. This spending will provide industry with a better,<br />
more efficient transport system. In doing so, it will<br />
support the continued expansion of our export sector. At<br />
the same time, it will provide a direct boost to employment<br />
and confidence.<br />
I also announce today that we will provide $ 10 million<br />
immediately -to CSIRO to upgrade its facilities. These funds<br />
will be fully spent in 1992. This decision will ensure that<br />
CSIRO researchers will have the physical infrastructure<br />
necessary to maintain their vital work.<br />
INDUSTRY DEVRLOPMENT<br />
The Government is acutely aware of the problems that are<br />
being encountered as the Australian economy undertakes its<br />
essential restructuring: our exporters are entering new, highly competitive<br />
markets; </p>
<p>many of our traditional firms are confronting<br />
radical change and a requirement to make<br />
substantial new investments;<br />
new firms are struggling to establish themselves<br />
and often new technologies.<br />
Today I announce measures designed to assist in each of<br />
these areas.<br />
The Government will allocate an additional $ 10 million to<br />
the Development Import Finance Facility ( DIFF) in 1992. The<br />
funds will enable us to offer finance to Australian firms<br />
for significant new projects in China, India and South East<br />
Asia. The decision will allow the DIFF to meet more of the demand<br />
on its funds. The existing backlog meant that projects in<br />
power, communications, transport and resource processing had<br />
been held over. In all those sectors, Australia is rapidly<br />
establishing international competitiveness.<br />
Mr Speaker,<br />
Since my March Statement, a number of companies in the<br />
textile, clothing and footwear industries have demonstrated<br />
their commitment to the Government's objective of creating<br />
strong and viable industries industries which will be<br />
competitive and in which jobs will be secure.<br />
To reinforce this commitment, the Government will bring<br />
forward $ 15 million in calendar year 1992, to be available<br />
for restructuring purposes approved by the Textile Clothing<br />
and Footwear Development Authority.<br />
The Australian Industry Development Corporation ( AIDC) has<br />
recorded a profit of $ 9.6 million for 1990-91. The<br />
Corporation has asked to retain this profit as additional<br />
capital to help meet the demand for equity in new project<br />
development. We recognise that additional capital is needed<br />
particularly for new investments in resource processing.<br />
The Government has therefore agreed that the profit should<br />
be retained by the Corporation.<br />
The Government has also decided to extend the Commonwealth<br />
guarantee on the Corporation's liabilities to 1998. This<br />
recognises the importance of the Corporation's role in<br />
industry development, by enabling it to minimise its<br />
borrowing costs.<br />
In the March Statement, I announced a major extension of<br />
sales tax exemptions available to business. The legislation<br />
is currently before the Senate. Allowing for the flow-on<br />
effects of reducing costs earlier in the production chain,<br />
the exemptions will provide a total benefit to business of<br />
more than $ 1 billion in a full year. </p>
<p>Mr Speaker,<br />
My Statement today focuses, and properly does so at this<br />
time, on the matter of most immediate concern to the people<br />
of Australia, the problem of unemployment. I do not seek to<br />
disguise the magnitude of the problem. And we should all<br />
acknowledge the fact that even when the recovery is fully<br />
underway, and job growth restored, substantial reduction of<br />
unemployment levels will take time. To grasp this reality,<br />
one only has to recall the post-recession experience last<br />
time. Even w. hen this Government had achieved average job<br />
creation of 230,000 a year, as it did over the period to<br />
mid-1990, the: associated fall in unemployment was gradual<br />
compared with the spectacular growth in jobs.<br />
But in acknowledging that, let me say, Mr Speaker, it is<br />
time, beyond time, to stop talking down the Australian<br />
economy. The central fact is that the Budget strategy is on<br />
course. The economy is recovering. And we will emerge from<br />
the recession with a stronger economy than before.<br />
Let me illustrate this truth by pointing to the results of<br />
the structuraEl reforms we have already achieved.<br />
Exports Of ma~ nufactured goods have increased by 112 per cent<br />
in real terms since 1983-84. Within manufacturing, exports<br />
of manufactured metals have risen by 62 per cent and exports<br />
of the more complex non-metal manufactured goods have<br />
increased by 147 per cent. Over the same period, exports of<br />
services have increased by 77 per cent.<br />
The official OECD statistics show that Australia's<br />
manufactured export performance in the past five years has<br />
been by far t: he best in the OECD. They show that, in real<br />
terms, annual growth of manufactured exports has averaged<br />
over 15 per cent in-Australia compared with the OECD average<br />
of 6 per cent. Australia's rate of manufactured export<br />
growth has even outpaced that of the four Newly<br />
IndustrialisiLng Economies of Asia South Korea, Taiwan,<br />
Singapore and Hong Kong. These trends emerged well before<br />
the recession and have continued throughout the recession.<br />
These facts are a remarkable tribute to the drive and<br />
initiative o~ f much of our business sector. It is a<br />
performance which presents an example and a challenge to the<br />
whole business community.<br />
As I have indicated, the performance in many service areas,<br />
notably tourism, has also been strong.<br />
Overseas tourist arrivals have more than doubled in just<br />
five years. The numbers are expected almost to treble again<br />
by the year 2000, to around 6 million.<br />
These projections lend compelling force to the Government's<br />
decisions in relation to aviation. </p>
<p>Following yesterday's decision by Federal Cabinet to approve<br />
the construction of a third runway at Sydney airport, the<br />
Federal Airports Corporation expects preliminary work to<br />
begin within a month and major construction contracts to be<br />
let early next year.<br />
As well as generating many thousands of sustainable new jobs<br />
at the airport and in directly related activities in the<br />
years ahead, the third runway will provide the capacity to<br />
meet the projected strong growth in tourist traffic.<br />
In addition, the Government will shortly examine a proposal<br />
for the development of a general aviation airport at<br />
Badgerys Creek, Sydney's designated international airport.<br />
Based on preliminary design work already completed, it is<br />
envisaged that this new aerodrome would be operational in<br />
1994.<br />
Mr Speaker,<br />
The strong performance in the manufacturing and service<br />
industries has been buttressed by the continuing strength of<br />
the mining sector.<br />
My Government has recently announced a new process aimed at<br />
encouraging major development projects including mining and<br />
minerals processing, agriculture and forestry.<br />
The process for approving major projects in these areas will<br />
be speeded up, although I emphasise that proper<br />
environmental standards and Aboriginal and heritage issues<br />
will not be by-passed.<br />
The strength of the manufacturing, services and mining<br />
industries stands in sharp contrast to the current plight of<br />
the rural sector.<br />
Many farmers have been hit by drought, compounding the<br />
severe downturn in farm prices, caused mainly by the trade<br />
war between the European Community and the United States.<br />
As part of our commitment to easing the burden on the rural<br />
sector, the Government has massively increased funding for<br />
the Rural Adjustment Scheme from $ 62 million in 1990-91 to<br />
$ 173 million in 1991-92. Further, we have just announced<br />
arrangements to link RAS assessments to social security<br />
benefits. It has to be acknowledged, however, that enduring relief<br />
will not occur unless there is liberalisation of<br />
agricultural trade. The farmers of Australia can be assured<br />
that this Government will continue to do all we can, in the<br />
coming crucial weeks of the Uruguay Round, to ensure it<br />
reaches a successful conclusion. </p>
<p>Mr Speaker,<br />
As I said at the outset, we now have an historic opportunity<br />
to move into the 21st century with a dynamic, reinvigorated,<br />
modern Australian economy. We have a unique opportunity to<br />
break the cycle of boom and bust. We have the opportunity<br />
to become one of the vibrant growth economies of the Asia-<br />
Pacif ic region.<br />
To seize this historic opportunity, we as a Government and a<br />
nation must embrace a set of key objectives and policies,<br />
designed to reinforce and accelerate the<br />
international. isation of the Australian economy.<br />
Australia's course is clear:<br />
We must lock in the gains of low inflation. We must keep<br />
our nerve and resist demands for artificial solutions to the<br />
recession. We must ensure that new investment continues to flow into<br />
our competitive, international industries with the economic<br />
recovery. We must continue the vigorous pursuit of micro-economic<br />
reform. We must continue the thrust towards the " Clever Country".<br />
We must continue to assert maximum possible pressure for a<br />
successful conclusion to the Uruguay Round of Multilateral<br />
Trade Negotiations.<br />
We must, consistent with the commitment to growth, maintain<br />
in perpetuity our matchless environmental assets through<br />
policies for ecologically sustainable development.<br />
That is this Government's national agenda for growth and<br />
reform. It is an agenda for jobs. It is an agenda for<br />
lasting, sustainable growth.<br />
The measures I have announced today advance that agenda.<br />
So today, Mr Speaker, I convey to the people of Australia a<br />
message of hope and confidence in the future of our great<br />
and unique nation. There is, simply, no nation in the world<br />
so well-placed by virtue of its inner resources its<br />
material resources, certainly, but much more important, its<br />
human, social and political resources to weather the<br />
present storms, at home and abroad, and emerge from them,<br />
not only secure, but strengthened. Now is a time for<br />
strength of purpose, to ensure that Australia emerges from<br />
the recession with resilience, assured of its abilities,<br />
confident that it can take its place as a leading competitor<br />
in a tough, competitive world. </p>
<p>12.<br />
For our part, we in the Labor Government will not falter.<br />
We owe that to those who have suffered through the<br />
recession. We owe it to all Australians. We owe it to the<br />
splendid future which is within the grasp of Australia, as<br />
we move towards the 21st century together. </p>

OFFSETS -76.4 -44.2 -64.4<br />
NET COST 64.1 34.3 59.5<br />
Additional funds for Employment Access Program ( EAP), Self Employment Assistance Program<br />
( SEAP) and Formal Training Assistance ( FTA) for the Skilishare program will increase the<br />
opportunities for unemployed persons, particularly the long-term unemployed, to access training and<br />
other programs appropriate to the current labour market conditions. The measures are additional to the<br />
$ 210m increase in the Budget in allocations to this area for 1991-92.<br />
Expansion of the Employment Access Program will allow greater numbers of jobseekers to undertake<br />
training to equip them with skills relevant to longer term labour market requirements. An increase in<br />
JOBSTART funds is also provided.<br />
Increased funding of the Self Employment Assistance Program will allow 500 additional placements<br />
for supported self-employment opportunities for the unemployed in 1991-92 and 1992-93.<br />
Additional Formal Training Assistance ( FTA) for Skillshare provides for greater numbers of long-term<br />
unemployed to undertake training courses for which FTA is payable under the Skillshare program.<br />
The costs of the above measures are partly offset by reductions in unemployment benefits outlays. </p>
<p>2. EDUCATION ANID TRAINING PROGRAMS<br />

OFFSETS -46.7 -23.1 -47.6 -49.1 -50.5<br />
NET COST 101.8 50.4 83.1 56.5 58.2<br />
Increased allocations for additional places and capital refurbishment in the post secondary education<br />
and training sectors will increase opportunities for school-leavers, from the 1992 calendar year. These<br />
increases are an initial Commonwealth response to the level of unmet demand for training, and the<br />
findings of the Finn Committee which identified the need for significant increases in the levels of<br />
training. Normal income support associated with these places will be provided under AUSTUDY<br />
Additional funds will also be advanced from 1994 for small scale renovations in higher education<br />
institutions. These projects are funded on a dollar for dollar basis with institutions.<br />
The costs of these measures are partly offset by reductions in unemployment benefits outlays from<br />
higher student numbers.<br />
3. TRANSPORT INFRASTRUCTURE<br />
Roads Expenditure<br />
The Government has decided to bring forward into 1992, $ 82m of funding for national highways and<br />

The increased allocation of funds in 199 1-92 and 1992-93 should enable an increase in construction<br />
and maintenance activity o'n a number of roads in all States and Territories in 1992. Approximately<br />
will be spent on the National Highway System, the balance being national arterials and other<br />
significant roads. The State distribution of funding is NSW $ 21.0m, Victoria $ 16.5m, Queensland<br />
$ 16.0m, WA $ 11.0m, SA $ 11.0m, Tasmania $ 3.5m, NT $ 2. Om and ACT </p>

An amount of $ 20m is to be ' made available to NSW and ' Victoria to accelerate priority capital<br />
upgrading of the rail network which will underpin the operations of the National Rail Corporation<br />
( NRC). The Commonwealth will be seeking the agreement of the other participants in the NRC to<br />
these funds being recogn~ sed as part of the Commonwealth's equity contribution to the National Rail<br />
Corporation. 1991-92 1992-93 1993-94 1994-95<br />

In the March 1991 Statement " Building A Competitive Australia" the Government recommitted itself<br />
to the provision of up to $ 120m through the Industries Development Strategy for the TCF industries<br />
over the period to 30 June 1995. A number of companies have been in discussions with the<br />
Government and acceleration of the release of funds is warranted. ( Currently $ 15m per annum is<br />
provided in the Forward Estimates for 1991-92 and 1992-93.) Projects approved by the TCFDA to be<br />
assisted under this Strategy will be announced by the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce<br />
in due course.<br />
Development Import Finance Facility ( DIFF)<br />
Cost of Measure: 1992 10.0 1991-92 1992-93 1993-94 1994-95<br />
DIFF assists Australian exporters of capital goods and services to compete against aid supported<br />
foreign suppliers in developing countries for government-owned, developmentally sound projects.<br />
DIFF takes the form of an aid grant which is used to soften the interest and payment terms of an export<br />
credit loan provided by thie Export Finance and Insurance Corporation ( EFIC) to fund a development<br />
project. Projects are selected in consultation with the recipient developing country to ensure that they<br />
have the highest developmental priority. </p>

Southbank Building Project ( Melbourne)<br />
Cost of Measure: Calendar 1992 $ m<br />
0.7 1991-92 1992-93 1993-94 1994-95<br />
The Government is to provide an interest subsidy to the ABC to enable borrowings of up to $ 15m to be<br />
made for this project estimated to cost $ 44.5m. The subsidy ( up to $ 1.5m per annum) will cover<br />
delay in the rationalisation in th6 Corporation's property portfolio in Melbourne and will ensure that<br />
construction of the project proceeds immediately.<br />

Cost of Measure: 1992 9.6 1991-92 1992-93 1993-94 1994-95<br />
The AIDC has determined its 1990-91 profit as $ 9.6m. The Government has agreed that the profit be<br />
retained in the Corporation to expand its scope for supporting development projects, rather than<br />
returned as a dividend to the Commonwealth as occurred in the previous year. ( The 1991-92 Budget<br />
estimated a return of $ 8.8m.) </p>
<p>3. CHANGES TO THE 1991-92 BUDGET ESTIMATES<br />
The following table presents an update of the 1991-92 and forward years estimates published at the<br />
