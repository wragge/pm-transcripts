PRESS STATEMENT NO. 32<br />
January 1973<br />
ABORIGINAL ADVANCEMENT<br />
The Australian Government decided today to allocate<br />
a further $ 10.85 million for Aboriginal Advancement projects in<br />
1972/ 73. Federal Cabinet decided that most of the extra<br />
allocation would be divided to expansion of advancement programs<br />
through the States, by way of supplementary Grants under Section<br />
96 of the Constitution. The decision followed a submission to<br />
Cabinet by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr. Bryant.<br />
Grants totalling $ 14.5 million in 1972/ 73 were<br />
authorised by the States Grants ( Aboriginal Advancement) Act<br />
1972 but a substantially greater sum could have been used<br />
particularly on housing and on special works projects.<br />
Apart from grants for the expansion program through<br />
the States, funds are needed to meet other urgent proposals<br />
involving direct funding by the Commonwealth. Included among<br />
these is the cost of implementing, during the rest of 1972/ 73,<br />
an A. L. P. policy undertaking to meet all legal costs of Aborigines<br />
appearing before the courts.<br />
It is estimated that $ 850,000 will be needed to meet<br />
these costs during the rest of the current financial year.<br />
A sum of $ 1.5 million which was pledged to Western<br />
Australia for Aboriginal housing on December 11 will be part of<br />
the extra $ 10.85 million allocation.<br />
