    <content><![CDATA[<p>My first official visits to Papua New Guinea and India will focus on trade, security, economic growth and education.</p>
<p>I will spend 7-9 April in Papua New Guinea and 9-12 April in New Delhi and Mumbai.</p>
<p>During my time in PNG, I will meet with Prime Minister Peter O’Neill and visit the Kokoda Track to commemorate the 75th Anniversary of the New Guinea Campaign in World War Two.</p>
<p>The visit is an opportunity to build upon our bilateral economic relationships in the Pacific, and will involve multiple business events, including a joint Australia-PNG Entrepreneur and Innovation Showcase.</p>
<p>I look forward to reflecting on our strong shared history, and cementing the special relationship with our neighbour.</p>
<p>In New Delhi, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and I will discuss the enormous opportunities for collaboration between Australia and India.</p>
<p>With converging political, economic and strategic interests, we will use the meeting to strengthen our relationship even further for the benefit of both nations.</p>
<p>India is the world’s fastest growing major economy. Two-way trade exceeded $19 billion in 2015-16 and there is scope for significant growth.</p>
<p>With the Minister for Education and Training, Senator the Hon Simon Birmingham, I will address a dinner to celebrate our partnership in education, recognising how Australian expertise in skills training can help India to meet its goal of training 400 million people by 2022.</p>
<p>In Mumbai, meetings with leading Indian CEOs and business people will focus on growing two-way trade and investment. Australian energy and resources are helping to power India’s growth, while our collaboration on innovation and technology will open new business opportunities in the future.</p>
<p>Australia is home to a vibrant Indian community which makes a significant contribution to the fabric of our multicultural society. It provides a vital bridge between our two countries, and this visit will ensure that the ties between India and Australia become even stronger.</p>
