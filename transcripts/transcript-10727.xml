    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE.................................................................................................</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, what do you make of Peter Costello's remarks</p>
<p>   (inaudible) about taking over the leadership?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh, I guess with a big party when you have done a lot of things</p>
<p>   and you are pursuing a very active reform agenda you will always</p>
<p>   get a few rumblings.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>But Mr Costello hasn't outrightly denied that that's</p>
<p>   the case. Is that a concern to you?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>........there are some in your party who may have done that.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Glenn, in any political party you'll always have, particularly</p>
<p>   if it's big and a big majority, you'll always have a few</p>
<p>   people who are a bit unhappy with the boss, that's always the</p>
<p>   case. Bob Menzies had it, every Prime Minister's had it. I</p>
<p>   am not concerned by it at all.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, has the Treasurer passed on any of those rumblings</p>
<p>   to you?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We have a lot of discussions. The Treasurer has been a very good</p>
<p>   Treasurer and a very good Deputy, and a very good friend.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, what came out of the Cabinet meetings with regards</p>
<p>   to Telstra?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We are still part heard. We are still going on, the meeting, that</p>
<p>   is.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Will you go to the next election seeking a mandate for the full</p>
<p>   sale of Telstra?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Didn't you hear my speech, Michael?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Yes. Same question.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Really? I have lost my powers of advocacy, the answer is yes.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Is it more likely now the Government will sell Telstra in stages</p>
<p>   and the next tranche will take it up to 49 per cent?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Fleur, that was always going to be on the cards. It was never going</p>
<p>   to be possible to sort of do it all at once. Never.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Is 49 per cent a good figure to take it up to?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I like 51, particularly when it comes to elections.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, how is it in any way helpful for your Deputy to</p>
<p>   publicly acknowledge that there are people after your job?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think people are always after the top job in politics. There's</p>
<p>   nothing unusual about that. I mean, I'd be the last person</p>
<p>   in Australian political life to decry ambition.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>So have you spoken to the Treasurer about his remarks this morning?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I don't see any particular need as of now to have done</p>
<p>   so. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Won't those rumblings increase though while the polls stay</p>
<p>   so low?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh look, the polls are no good at the moment. I understand that</p>
<p>   but they'll get better and we'll win the election but</p>
<p>   it was inevitable in the wake of what happened in Queensland that</p>
<p>   some people were going to get disoriented and some people were going</p>
<p>   to run around a little bit in disorder but that'll settle down,</p>
<p>   and particularly when the tax package is released. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>But the polls aren't a short-term thing though, your Government</p>
<p>   has been showing up badly in the polls for quite some time now.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I don't want to have a long debate about the polls but</p>
<p>   I seem to recall two months ago in the wake of the budget in Newspoll,</p>
<p>   which some people take more notice of than others, we were back</p>
<p>   to where we were straight after the 1996 election.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>So the tax policy will be the circuit breaker you think?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I don't use terms like circuit breaker but what you have</p>
<p>   at the moment is people expectantly waiting for the policy and it's</p>
<p>   obviously a very big event in the life of the Government and it</p>
<p>   will obviously help shape people's attitudes towards the Government</p>
<p>   and they'll see that the Coalition stands for tax reform. And</p>
<p>   there's Kim Beazley and Pauline Hanson holding hands against</p>
<p>   tax reform. I think it will fix their mind on who is for progress</p>
<p>   and who is for regression and who is for the future and who is for</p>
<p>   the past.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Are you disappointed you didn't get a boost out of the passage</p>
<p>   of the Wik legislation?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well everything is relative when it comes to boosts, Michael. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, have you felt coming to Bendigo just a slight apprehension</p>
<p>   knowing that Pauline Hanson is speaking on the same day?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, should I?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Has there been any, knowing that there's a protest reaction...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I don't know what other people are doing in relation</p>
<p>   to her visit. Let me take the opportunity of saying, however, that</p>
<p>   violent demonstrations against Mrs Hanson are undemocratic, they</p>
<p>   are not in the pattern of Australian politics and you could almost</p>
<p>   believe that those demonstrators were being paid by One Nation because</p>
<p>   what those demonstrators are doing is attracting sympathy towards</p>
<p>   Mrs Hanson. Those people are very foolish if they imagine that those</p>
<p>   sorts of demonstrations are going to drive people away. </p>
<p>People don't want violence. I find the sight of an 85 year</p>
<p>   old man with his face bleeding, staggering into a meeting, disgusting</p>
<p>   Â– absolutely disgusting. And the people who are responsible</p>
<p>   for that kind of behaviour are the enemies of democracy and free</p>
<p>   speech in this country. I think that sort of behaviour is absolutely</p>
<p>   disgusting and so far from that helping expose the futility of the</p>
<p>   Hanson agenda, and it is a futile agenda, it will in fact attract</p>
<p>   sympathy to the person and that is regrettable because I think people</p>
<p>   should just stand back and have a look at what she is saying and</p>
<p>   what the solutions are and then the support will peel away. But</p>
<p>   if you think by yelling abuse, throwing punches, shouting obscenities</p>
<p>   and engaging in mindless chants, you are going to change anybody's</p>
<p>   mind you don't understand the mood and the temper of the Australian</p>
<p>   people.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, can I ask one thing about this morning's ceremony.</p>
<p>   You said it was one of the highlights of your Prime Ministership.</p>
<p>   Was it all the more important because of the family connection?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes it was, I did feel...my as you know, my father and grandfather</p>
<p>   fought together on the Western Front. My father was 20 and my grandfather</p>
<p>   was 45 and I have always felt because of that an emotional identification.</p>
<p>   I think he was just a wonderful old man. I think, he's 107,</p>
<p>   he's our oldest digger and I just thought it was a terrific</p>
<p>   occasion. I mean that man embodies so much of what we believe in</p>
<p>   ourselves as Australians - his youth, his sense of adventure, his</p>
<p>   commitment, his reckless sort of indifference to too much authority,</p>
<p>   all of those things we love about Australia, he embodied and I thought</p>
<p>   it was a fantastic ceremony. I was very moved by it.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>(inaudible)</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't know how you can be in Coalition with a party whose</p>
<p>   economic policies are virtually indistinguishable from those of</p>
<p>   the Labor Party.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>So you rule out (inaudible)?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I have already ruled it out, full stop, kaput, finished. Thank</p>
<p>   you.</p>
