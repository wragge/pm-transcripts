PRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT -7b/ 107T<br />
Prime Minister Interviewed at Fairbairn on departure to Darwin<br />
7 September 1978<br />
Question: Prime Minister, how real is the danger of the Uranium development<br />
being set back by the-Northern Land Council?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I wouldn't think so. The stories in the paper this morning<br />
were imaginative. One of then, said " Fraser is rushing up<br />
to have discussions and negotiations". Well I've been planning<br />
to go up for the opening of the Northern Territory Parliament<br />
certainly for months. It's obvious that while in the Northern<br />
Territory I would be having discussions with a variety of<br />
people. Question: Will Ranger get going on time?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I believe it will, yes.<br />
Question: Doesn't approval of a road though imply that the project itself<br />
will be approved?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
No. Not at all.<br />
Question:<br />
Why would they build a road then through reserves?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
It's their risk. It has been made perfectly plain that that's<br />
SO. Question: Just one other point. The Caltex Oil Company has asked you<br />
to overrule the PJT andgive more money.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I saw that in the newspapers this morning too. Let's see<br />
what happens when I'm approached, if an approach comes. to me.<br />
direct. / 2 </p>
<p>2.<br />
Question: Do you think it's fair though that they should get the full<br />
impost of your tax applied?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
All I know about this is what I've read in the newspapers,<br />
and so I'm not going to o-mmm any more than that.<br />
