JOINT STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J<br />
KEATING MP, AND THE PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH WALES, THE HON<br />
NICK GREINER MP<br />
GLEBE ISLAND BRIDGE<br />
Following today's announcement by the Prime Minister of<br />
the broad range of transport and other infrastructure<br />
initiatives which will benefit the State of New South<br />
Wales, the Prime Minister and Premier Nick Greiner, today<br />
announced that work on the Glebe Island Bridge can<br />
immediately move ahead with a view to completion of the<br />
project by 19395.<br />
In light of -the implications of the Economic Statement<br />
initiatives for the longer term road funding<br />
responsibilities of the Commonwealth and the States, New<br />
South Wales ' has been assured of the fiscal capability to<br />
proceed with the 4 year Glebe Island Arterial Project.<br />
The Prime Minister also re-affirmed that the Commonwealth<br />
would contribute $ 65.85 million to the Project in the<br />
life of the existing Commonwealth roads program which<br />
ends in 1993.<br />
In making the announcement, the Premier explained that<br />
the new bridge, which will remove a major bottle-neck in<br />
traffic flow between Sydney and its western environments,<br />
will carry six lanes of traffic. It will have an overall<br />
length of 800 metres and a main span of 345 metres across<br />
the entrance; Blackwattle Bay. The bridge deck is to be<br />
suspended by cable from two towers of 120 metres height.<br />
Mr Greiner announced that the contract for construction<br />
of the bridge will be awarded to Baulderstone Hornibrook<br />
in conjunction with the French company, Campenon Bernard.<br />
The tender price is approximately $ 69 million in 1990<br />
dollar terms. The total Glebe Island Arterial Project,<br />
which is approximately 2 kilometres in length, will have<br />
a final cost, in out-turn dollars, of approximately $ 160<br />
million. </p>
<p>2<br />
Work on the site will commence virtually immediately,<br />
with the creation of new jobs expected to reach<br />
approximately 200 by the end of the year. An additional<br />
800 jobs are likely to be created off-site by the new<br />
Project. The Prime Minister and the Premier look forward to the<br />
benefits that this link, together with the City-West<br />
Link, will provide as an east-west route from the City to<br />
the F4 at Concord. The Glebe Island Bridge will also<br />
enable better access to Sydney's inner ports and is an<br />
important project in the context of the infrastructure<br />
required for the Olympic Games in Sydney.<br />
