    <content><![CDATA[<p>PM. No. 87/ 1972<br />RELEASE OF LXND FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF LIVING AND<br />OTHER AREAS FOR RESIDENT ABORIGINAL COMMUNITIES IN_<br />THE NORTHERN TERRITORY<br />Statement by the Prime Minister, the Rt. R~ on. William<br />McMahon, CH, MP. 12 OCTOBER 1972<br />Following discussions I have had today with Lord<br />Vestey, the Government has accepted with pleasure the offer by<br />Lord Vestey to give some 35 square miles of land ( about 22,400 acres)<br />from the Vestey lease of Wave Hill Station in the Northern<br />Territory. The offer by Lord Vestey has been taken up in the<br />context of the Government's acceptance of the recommendations of the<br />Gibb Committee that a policy be adopted to enable community living<br />areas for aborigines to be established on land in pastoral properties<br />and under the control of the aborigines themselves.<br />In accordance with this policy, the area of Crown land<br />on which the Government welfare centre at Wave Mill is located will<br />be extended to include land at Wattie Creek which has been the site<br />of a camnping area for aborigines for some time.<br />The offer by Lord Vestey includes an area of 1lC square<br />miles near Wattie Creek which the Gurindji People have asked be<br />leased to them for use in a cattle mustering project. Government<br />of ficials will be discussing with the people at Wattie Creek in<br />the near future their proposal for a lease and the sort of<br />financial assistance they would need to enable the best use to be<br />made of the land.<br />The land to be released by Lord Vestey will enable the<br />site at Wattie Creek to be further develoned with Government<br />assistance and made available for le2asing to the local community. / 2</p>
<p>The area-includes the site of-ths-new-bores which<br />will provide additional supplies of water to Wattie Creek End<br />the Wave Hill centre. Mater is now being piped to Wattie Creek<br />from these bores and this has overcome the water supply problem<br />experienced there in recent months.<br />I am pleased to be able to say that a number of<br />other pastoralists in the Northern Territory have also agreed<br />in principle to the release of land for the development of<br />living areas for resident aboriginal communities. These<br />pastoralists have responded to the Government's announcement<br />of the acceptance of the Gibb Committee recommendations.<br />Further discussions about implementing recommendations<br />of the Gibb Committee report will be undertaken at a meeting<br />of the Northern Territory Pastoral Lessees Association at<br />Kitherine next month.<br />CANBERRA, 12 October 1972 I</p>
