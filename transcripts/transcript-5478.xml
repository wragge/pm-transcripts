R4, I<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA WEDNESDAY 5 NOVEMBER 1980<br />
WORLD CONSERVATION STRATEGY<br />
I have written to the Premiers and the Chief Minister of the<br />
Northern Territory concerning the development of a National<br />
Conservation Strategy incorporating the proposals outlined in the<br />
World Conservation Strategy launched in Australia and thirty<br />
other countries on 6 March, 1980.<br />
The World Conservation Strategy seeks to integrate conservation.<br />
and development objectives with the aim of sustaining the use<br />
of living resources ( ie ecosystems and species) for future<br />
generations. The Strategy suggests this will require increased communication<br />
between conservationists, developers and users of living<br />
resources and in some situations priorities must be changed.<br />
The Commonwealth believes that the development of National<br />
Conservation Strategy is a desirable initiative. The National<br />
Strategy would be an expression of jointly developed national<br />
objectives and priorities and would provide guidance for those<br />
responsible for the use of living resources.<br />
The Commonwealth acknowledges the need to refer specifically, as<br />
appropriate, to areas of particular interest to Commonwealth,<br />
State and Northern Territory Governments on the basis of<br />
existing responsibilities.<br />
The Commonwealth has, therefore, proposed that a Steering<br />
Committee be established of Commonwealth, State and Northern<br />
Territory officials, to co-ordinate the development of the National<br />
Conservation Strategy.<br />
The Commonwealth has also suggested that the National<br />
Conservation Strategy be developed in two phases:<br />
The first phase culminating in a National Seminar<br />
at the end of 1981 would result in a draft Strategy.<br />
The second phase would prepare the Strategy for the<br />
approval of governments and would culminate in a<br />
National Conference at the end of 1982 for the<br />
purpose of considering the National Conservation StratEgy<br />
and identifying action plans and nomin-ating priority<br />
measures for implementing the objectives of the<br />
National Strategy. / 2<br />

The community has a significant contribution to make<br />
towards the development of the Strategy and non-government<br />
organisations will be fully consulted. Every opportunity<br />
will be taken to publicise the matter.<br />
All who have read the World Conservation Strategy will agree<br />
that it is an important, timely and well-reasoned document.<br />
Although Australia's record in this field is commendable, the<br />
Strategy provides a framework for a major collaborative<br />
undertaking by all levels of government, non-government<br />
organisations and the community to further develop and<br />
implement a National Conservation Strategy which will have<br />
the support of all Australians now and in the future.<br />
