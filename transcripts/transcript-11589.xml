    <content><![CDATA[<p>I reject totally Prof David Penington's claim (today's Age)</p>
<p> that I or my office sought to influence the comments about supervised</p>
<p> injecting rooms published in the Annual Report of the International Narcotics</p>
<p> Control Board.</p>
<p>My views on this matter are well known. To suggest that there was any</p>
<p> intervention to induce a report in particular terms is not only false</p>
<p> but offensive to the Board and to the government.</p>
<p>Professor Penington is entitled, like any other citizen, to his views</p>
<p> on the drug problem. Many of them I share. Some of them I do not.</p>
<p>He will be well aware that the International Narcotics Control Board</p>
<p> has been consistently opposed to injecting rooms and that therefore its</p>
<p> latest criticism is barely surprising.</p>
<p>He has admitted that he had no evidence to back his unfair claim about</p>
<p> my office.</p>
<p>In those circumstances therefore, Professor Penington should never have</p>
<p> made the claim.</p>
