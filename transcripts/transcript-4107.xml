CONFERENCE OF THE REGIONAL GALLERIES ASSOCIATION<br />
The Regional Galleries Association Conference brings<br />
togethcr the people most directly concerned with<br />
' developing and managing Victoria's regional galleries.<br />
The regional gaileries of Victoria represent a most<br />
significant achievement in community artistic life in<br />
Australia. They are important not merely because they arc<br />
repositories of good examples of Australia art.<br />
The active Association a~ id the annual activities of the<br />
galleries in mourting exhibitions do much to encourage<br />
Australians to a wider appreciation of the quality of<br />
art in their own country.<br />
I am of course particularly pleased that this Conference is<br />
being held in Hamilton. The Hamilton Art Gallery is probably<br />
the best provincial gallery in Australia. The Hamilton<br />
. gallery's collection of decorative art is, I understand,<br />
not only unequalled in Australia, but has many pieces which<br />
are of international standard.<br />
The Government in Victoria has of course been very active in<br />
the promotion of the arts. The Federal Government has<br />
also taken an active role through the Australia Council.<br />
The Visual Arts Board of the Council has provided substantial<br />
assistance for exhibitions which hav3 toured galleries throughout<br />
Australia. There is to be an increasing emphasis on funds provided<br />
; hrough the Australian Gallery Directors Council for<br />
exhibitions to regional galleries. The exhibition " Sculpture<br />
of Thailand" is to be shown at nine centres throughout Australia<br />
including the Victorian Arts Centre in Melbourne and the<br />
Mildura Arts Centre.<br />
The Government intends to continue its support for the creative<br />
and performing arts in Australia.<br />
Australia has an extraordinarily rich artistic tradition.<br />
There is hardly an area of the arts where Australia has<br />
not excelled. ./ 2 </p>
<p>Previous Federal Liberal aiid Country Party Governments<br />
took a k-een interest in encou~ raging the cre~ ative and<br />
per-forming arts in Australia. They established the<br />
Commonwealth Literary Board, the Australian National<br />
Gallery, the Arts Council, and they took the first steps<br />
in the establishment of the Film Corporation. I am pleased<br />
to recall that as Minister I took an active part in<br />
establishing the Canberra School of MNusic.<br />
A Government Parties Committee has now been established<br />
under the Chai-manship of David Hamer to assist it in developing<br />
the arts in Australia. During the Parliamentary recess this<br />
Committee will be visiting all States and meeting with<br />
people involved in the arts.<br />
i have been personally concerned that the Government's<br />
activities in promoting' creative artists endeavour<br />
in Australia should remain with the Department of Prime<br />
Mi-nister and Cabinet and the committee I have just referred<br />
' to will be reporting directly to me.<br />
You will all know that the Government is very concerned at<br />
thie present time that the Federal Government operates within<br />
the limits of the resourcos available to it. We are<br />
particularly concerned to eliminate wasteful expenditure.<br />
Every area of Government spending is being examine-d in the<br />
enquiry we are presently making. I need hardly say that<br />
Government activities in the arts area are under very<br />
close examination at present. I do not want to -pre-empt<br />
r'he results of that examination which is still. proceedingby<br />
being too specific in my comments todlay.<br />
It may however hRlp to ease any concern there may be if I<br />
re-emphasise the broad purposes of the Government in this area.<br />
The Government fully intends -to encourage the contiaued growth<br />
and development of the arts-. in Australia. In particular,<br />
it is our intention to encourage the development of Australian<br />
art rather than costly purchases overseas. We intend,<br />
for example, to give effect to the National Gallery's policy<br />
of giving priority to the purchase of Australian arts.<br />
Alongside this policy Australia must of course be open to<br />
influence from overseas. Great art inevitably must cross<br />
political frontiers. We have announced our intention to<br />
support a more vigorous sponsorship of exhibitions which will<br />
give Australians ready access to the art and culture of<br />
other countries. Australians are and ought to be in the<br />
vanguard of the artistic world.<br />
The rlovernmeint's principal. present concern to restore economic<br />
prospierity to Australia will not be allowed to obscure the<br />
fact Australia is more than aa efficient economy. Australia<br />
can be a part of a vital world culture and the Government<br />
intends to play a part in encouraging this development.<br />
The regional galleries have a most significant role in this exciting<br />
prospect, both as repositories of Australian art and as exhibitors<br />
of the art of other countries. 3 </p>
<p>3.<br />
The regional galleries of Victoria have already made ? n<br />
important contribution and I have no doubt that this<br />
contribution will be even greater in the future.<br />
I have great pleasure in declaring the 19th annual conference<br />
of the Regional Galleries Association of Victoria open.<br />
