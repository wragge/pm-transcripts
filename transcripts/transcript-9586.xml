PRIME MINISTER 44/ 95<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
FRAMEWORK AGREEMENT BETWEEN AUSTRALIA AND<br />
THE EUROPEAN UNION<br />
Senator McMullan, who is leading the Australian delegation to the<br />
Australian/ European Commission ( EC) Ministerial Consultations in Brussels will today<br />
raise with EC Vice President Sir Leon Brittan, the development of a formal framework<br />
for future relations between Australia and the European Union.<br />
Last month, I wrote to EC President Santer to propose that Australia and the<br />
European Union develop such an agreement in order to strengthen the already healthy<br />
ties between us.<br />
This follows on from fruitful discussions that I held in Brussels in June last year with<br />
the then EC President Delors and some of his commissioners. An agreement would<br />
help stimulate closer cooperation on trade and investment issues, and closer dialogue<br />
on the many common economic and social policy issues that EU countries and<br />
Australia face.<br />
The European Union is a very important partner for Australia and a major source of<br />
foreign investment. Two members the United Kingdom and Germany are among<br />
our top ten trading partners. During my visit to Germany and the Netherlands in<br />
March as to the United Kingdom and France last year I impressed on their leaders<br />
the opportunities that restructuring and growth in the Australian economy offered<br />
European companies, and Australia's value as an investor in Europe and supplier of an<br />
increasingly diverse range of exports. This was underlined by the success of Australia's<br />
participation in CeBIT, the world's largest information technology fair, at Hannover<br />
earlier this year.<br />
Apart from the prospects for expanding bilateral economic links, I emphasised that, as<br />
a confident, competitive and technologically advanced economy closely integrated with<br />
the Asia-Pacific region, Australia was ideal as a base for European business operating<br />
in the region.<br />
The Government's proposal of an agreement reflects our recognition of the important<br />
interests Australia has in Europe. An agreement will help us build new and dynamic<br />
relations with the European Union and its member States into the next century.<br />
