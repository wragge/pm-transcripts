PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF RADIO INTERVIEW WITH DON CHIPP, RADIO 3AK,<br />
CHANNEL 9 STUDIO, RICHMOND j-g c-rL~ 1e4910<br />
CHIPP: My big moment of the week, the Right Honorable<br />
Prime Minister of Australia, the Right Honorable R J<br />
Hawke, good morning Prime Minister.<br />
PM: G'day Don.<br />
CHIPP: How are you?<br />
PM: Feel great thanks mate.<br />
CHIPP: Gee you're looking well.<br />
PM: Thank you very much.<br />
CHIPP: Except for that scar on you elbow, how did you<br />
get that?<br />
PM: I was having a game of tennis, the first in about<br />
three or four years with my old mate Singo, your mate,<br />
and went diving for a volley and took a bit of skin off.<br />
CHIPP: You like to win don't you?<br />
PM: Beats the hell out of losing mate.<br />
CHIPP: Its more than that, it is almost a fanaticism<br />
with you isn't it, winning?<br />
PM: I think it is an insult to yourself and to your<br />
opponent not to try to win.<br />
CHIPP: And how do you feel after, if you lose?<br />
just try to win next time.<br />
CHIPP: I got beaten for the gift once by half an<br />
inch and I have no regrets whatsoever because I tried my<br />
hardest. PM: Thats right, that is what I mean about trying to<br />
win. I mean I think it is an insult to yourself and your<br />
opponent not to try your hardest to beat him.<br />
CHIPP: You have got a good opponent this time, he is<br />
coming up well as he did last time against you. </p>
<p>PM: Yes ' 84 I think was a pretty unreal sort of<br />
campaign, I think some, he'd set sort of expectations<br />
about this year which I think were rather unrealistic<br />
expectations.<br />
CHIPP: You think you're ahead?<br />
PM: I don't want to make that sort of assertion, just<br />
let me say this, that going back to your first point,<br />
I've tried my hardest, I've given it my best shot and we<br />
seem to be travelling pretty well Don and I will be going<br />
flat out until next Friday evening.<br />
CHIPP: I don't know whether I represent the typical<br />
swinging voter out there in those marginal seats that are<br />
going to determine the winner. But to me the biggest<br />
issue by far is the foreign debt. In 1975 it was<br />
billion. In 1985, ten years later it had grown to $ 67<br />
billion and now in 1990 it is $ 118 billion growing by<br />
about $ 2 billion a month. Does your Government take any<br />
responsibility for this, after all you have been there<br />
most of the seven years, during the last seven years of<br />
your Government the major growth has taken place.<br />
PM: Ok, let's look at whats happened in respect of the<br />
Government part of it. I have wiped it out. I, in the<br />
last three years, have done what no government has ever<br />
done before and that is had a surplus in the Government<br />
business, $ 17 billion. We have used that $ 17 billion to<br />
wipe out our debt, we are in fact now net creditted at<br />
$ 4.4 billion.<br />
CHIPP: When you say we you mean the Commonwealth<br />
PM: Commonwealth Government and we are net creditted as<br />
far as the Australian people are concerned, through the<br />
Commonwealth Government, they owe not a cent we are net<br />
international creditors. 65% of the debt is in private<br />
hands, now lets understand what that means, it means that<br />
the private sector, enterprise in the private sector have<br />
made commercial decisions, they believe that they can<br />
with the decisions they have made, the borrowings they<br />
have made, can generate the income which will cover their<br />
debt. Look at the other side of it. Access economics,<br />
billion Don, $ 45 billion of projects which they<br />
i-dentify that are actually under way, or for which the<br />
actual commitment has-. been made and they say in respect<br />
of that $ 45 billion it will generate $ 5 billion per annum<br />
of foreign earnings. So its been used to restructure<br />
Australian industry and earn us more income, that doesn't<br />
mean we should be complacent about it, but we are doing<br />
the things that are necessary from a Government's point<br />
of view to lower it.<br />
CHIPP: I put to you that up to ten years ago I would<br />
agree with what you have just said, that that capital<br />
inflow or the private indebtedness, was private </p>
<p>investment coming in but isn't it true the last ten years<br />
has been essentially borrowings which has just been<br />
brought in to hold up the balance of payments on current<br />
account deficit.<br />
PM: But it is borrowings which is being used.<br />
Borrowings which are being used to restructure Australian<br />
industry. CHIPP: By Mr Bond and Mr Skase.<br />
PM: And also, what about Mr Jackson for instance<br />
yesterday who just announced a massive profit. A man in<br />
an enterprise which is operating with spectacular success<br />
in Australia overseas, and who I might say made the<br />
observation that the industrial relations climate created<br />
by my Government is the best that it ever has been and<br />
which has been an important part of their success.<br />
CHIPP: I will concede that your Government, per se,<br />
hasn't run up the debt but it has been run up by private<br />
enterprise during your tenure, now what a Government has<br />
got to do surely, is to set the economic climate that<br />
those private enterprises who did run up the debt can<br />
export more than we import as a whole over the past few<br />
years. PM: OK lets look at what we have done as a Government in<br />
those circumstances and compare it by way of contrast to<br />
the Opposition. Three elements. Firstly, we have got a<br />
wages policy which has meant that Australian industry can<br />
become more competitive, a 12.2% reduction in unit labour<br />
costs which has meant in the last four years a 54%<br />
increase in the exports of manufactured goods 54%, we<br />
are exporting now Don, we are exporting cars and car<br />
parts, Australia is, to Japan and the United States,<br />
unheard of before. Steel industry, you know, when I came<br />
to office in ' 83 BHP were going to shut down the steel<br />
industry, we now in this last year, three quarters of a<br />
billion dollars worth of steel exported overseas and in<br />
the next three years it is going to be trebbled. So we<br />
have got the wages policy which is secondly, we have<br />
got our budget policy right, as I said to you just a<br />
moment ago $ 17 billion surplus in the last three years.<br />
We have got the situation where the Government is<br />
reducing its calling on the savings of the community so<br />
thert that has been available to the private sector, they<br />
don't have to call to the same extent now as a result of<br />
what I'm doing on the overseas market and thirdly, we<br />
have got the plan in place for the future for savings<br />
with superannuation. Don when I came to office<br />
superannuation $ 17 billion, now $ 100 billion-and by<br />
the end of this decade $ 6-700 billion. In other words,<br />
mobilising the savings of the community so that there<br />
will not be the need for Australian industry to call on<br />
overseas. Now in respect of each one of those the<br />
Opposition hopeless. </p>
<p>CHIPP: Conceded that, but surely you would have to admit<br />
that in the field of removing restrictive work practices<br />
which are rampant in export industries like meat, like<br />
coal and many others, you haven't made the progress that<br />
you would like to.<br />
PM: Absolutely wrong. Well no I'm sorry<br />
CHIPP: Come on there is a meat factory just closed down<br />
here in Victoria through union practices.<br />
PM: Wait a minute. Certainly we would like to have done<br />
more. Always, any Government would like to have done<br />
more than it has done and I don't condone restrictive<br />
work practices wherever they exist, but, what I am saying<br />
to you in terms of what we have done. I remind you of a<br />
challenge which I issued at the end of last year Don, and<br />
you are a man who likes challenges and you like<br />
challenges to be answered. I issued a challenge, a very<br />
specific one to the Opposition at the end of last year,<br />
we are talking about micro-economic reform. I said when<br />
I came to office 30 of the previous 33 years you mob ran<br />
this country, now I said to them, you point to me one<br />
period in your 30 years in office where you came within a<br />
bull's roar of doing in terms of micro-economic reform<br />
what I have done in seven years and Don that challenge<br />
was made at the end of last year and hasn't been<br />
answered, why, because they can't. The reform that we<br />
have brought about<br />
CHIPP: It has been answered in terms of their<br />
alternative industrial relations policy<br />
PM: No it hasn't<br />
CHIPP: It is a policy it hasn't been tried I admit but<br />
it has been answered to that extent<br />
PM: My challenge was you show me one point in your<br />
years when you did anything which came within a bull's<br />
roar. In other words what I am saying is their record<br />
where they had 30 years and didn't do anything<br />
CHIPP: But not look at the past, lets look at the<br />
future. Their industrial relations policy on paper<br />
PMt Is a recipe for disaster.<br />
CHIPP: Well who says so?<br />
PM: Sir Richard Kirby. You heard him yesterday. Sir<br />
Richard Kirby said it is a recipe for disaster.<br />
CHIPP: I wouldn't go that far<br />
PM: I will tell you who else said it yesterday, Allan<br />
Jackson. Allan Jackson of BTR Nylex who just announced<br />
this over a billion dollar profit, one of the most </p>
<p>successful enterprises in this country and operates<br />
overseas as well and he said that the Hawke industrial<br />
relations policy had created the best industrial<br />
relations climate that they had ever had and that the<br />
Opposition policy didn't match it.<br />
CHIPP: Well I'll give you a bit of music for a change<br />
Prime Minister. Sir Richard Kirby, former President of<br />
the Arbitration Commission, actually said that the wages<br />
accord which you struck with the ACTU was the greatest<br />
industrial relations triumph since 1907 Mr Justice<br />
Higgins set the basic wage. Look I come back to this<br />
debt. Look ordinary people are suffering and you know<br />
they are suffering and you have said you wouldn't make<br />
them suffer unless they had to suffer by high taxes, high<br />
interest rates, inflation<br />
PM: What's this high taxes?<br />
CHIPP: High taxes in terms, not in terms of what it was<br />
but 48 cents in the dollar is a high tax.<br />
PM: Well lets come on. Lets do this tax thing in two<br />
ways. Firstly, lets look at what I have done and the<br />
simple fact is that you know because we have talked about<br />
it before. They walked out of office with a top rate of<br />
cents in the dollar and a bottom rate of 30 cents in<br />
the dollar, why? Very simple Don, because they refused,<br />
they refused to get the tax from those with the greatest<br />
capacity to pay. Just let me Don give you one quote,<br />
because I know you will be appalled by it<br />
CHIPP: But you are still comparing yourself with them.<br />
I'd rather you the question is naked and unadorned<br />
and tell me what, don't you agree<br />
PM: I'm telling you what I'm doing, I'm telling you what<br />
I have done and what we will continue to do but it is<br />
legitimate in terms of pointing out what we have done<br />
when you talk about high taxes to show what we have done.<br />
This quote<br />
CHIPP: In relation to the Liberals<br />
PM: Yes but this quote that I give is one of the most<br />
damning indictments, one of the most damning indictments<br />
of' our opponents. And this is not just about the past,<br />
this-is about the future because this is what they would<br />
go back to. This is what Professor Russell Mathews said<br />
Don, just read this, this is what he said at the end of<br />
their period of office<br />
CHIPP: Well he's hardly a left-wing radical is he?<br />
PM: Thats right. He's certainly not a labor spokesman,<br />
he said this " the essential problem is to make the rich<br />
pay any income tax at all" now why? He was saying that<br />
why the essential problem to get the rich to pay any </p>
<p>income tax at all was you had the absence of a Capital<br />
Gains Tax. Now I brought the Capital Gains Tax in, which<br />
means that those with the greatest capacity to pay are<br />
paying. That is why in part we have been able to bring<br />
the top rate down from 60 cents in the dollar that they<br />
walked out of office with, 60 down to 47 and the lowest<br />
rate from 30 down to 21, because I'm making those with<br />
the capacity to pay, pay. Now that is the past and the<br />
present and what is the future? This mob are promising<br />
to take Australia back to the disaster of Australia being<br />
the country of the tax avoidance system and the rich not<br />
paying. CHIPP: Point taken, point well made. I repeat I am<br />
paying too much tax Prime Minister. I have got a job New<br />
Year's eve reporting the election, every dollar I earn of<br />
that money I have got to pay 50 cents in the God damn<br />
dollar, now if that is not too high tax, tell me what is.<br />
PM: I'll tell you. What if I give you the facts about<br />
the OECD, that in the whole of the OECD there are only<br />
three countries, only three countries, with a lower<br />
taxation regime than Australia. In other words we are<br />
the fourth lowest in terms of taxation impact in the<br />
OECD. CHIPP: Ok you have made that point. I will leave high<br />
taxes out of this equation I don't need it. High<br />
interest rates, inflation, tight monetary policy, many<br />
bankruptcies, now ordinary people are suffering and I am<br />
not suggesting, in the context of this question, that is<br />
your fault, what I am saying is, essentially, it is the<br />
fault of the high-flying greedy entrepreneurs who have<br />
been allowed to borrow billions of dollars overseas and<br />
that is why these ordinary people have got to pay high<br />
interest rates, that is why I have got to go into<br />
bankruptcy. It doesn't seem fair.<br />
PM: Wait a minute. That is an over-simplification.<br />
CHIPP: Its not to them<br />
PM: Well let me put the point to you. What are the<br />
facts about growth? The facts about growth are these,<br />
that we have been having a rate of economic growth of<br />
4.4% per annum which is twice as fast as it was before<br />
aY~ d in that last year Don which is relevant to this<br />
period you-are. talking about, we just had an explosion of<br />
demand and consumption. Consumption actually increased<br />
by now production only increased by Now that<br />
meant the imports were coming in at a level we couldn't<br />
sustain and so I had to have higher interest rates<br />
because if we hadn't had it the economy would have<br />
collapsed. Now you talk about the fellows that have<br />
collapsed, your Bonds and so on, but at the same time as<br />
they have been making decisions which have been<br />
commercially unsound apparently, your Allan Jackson's<br />
that I talk about and a whole host of your other </p>
<p>companies in Australia have been making sound decisions<br />
which are making the Australian economy more competitive.<br />
Out of all these imports that were coming in, a whole<br />
stack of them are going into making our Australian<br />
industry more competitive and enabling us to increase our<br />
exports. To have a situation Don, I know you are proud<br />
of it, I don't have to say you should be proud of it.<br />
Surely we are all proud of the fact that now Australia is<br />
exporting cars and car parts to Japan and the United<br />
states. That we are now exporting steel, when I came to<br />
office they were going to shut the steel industry down.<br />
Now they are exporting steel all over the world. Don, I<br />
went to an enterprise in Adelaide last year, just an<br />
Adelaide suburb, manufacturing optical lenses. Now I<br />
can't tell you how proud I was about that. We went in<br />
there and they told me we are exporting all over the<br />
world. The United States, the toughest market in the<br />
world, took it over 50% of the market. Now those things<br />
are happening as part of the restructuring of Australian<br />
industry. CHIPP: Prime Minister you have got no argument from me<br />
that you should bring high interest rates down, you can't<br />
bring them down. Any other options you have got are all<br />
unpleasant, import restrictions, devaluing the dollar,<br />
they are just not on I agree with you, I agree with<br />
your policy, but all I am saying is it just seems unfair<br />
to me that the ordinary guy out there is paying high<br />
interest rates on his mortgage just to pay for the<br />
extravagances and the indulgances of a few entrepreneurs<br />
who borrow too much overseas.<br />
PM: That simply isn't right that that's why they were<br />
doing it. The level of demand is not simply the actions<br />
of one or two entrepreneurs, I mean if you look at the<br />
aggregates of the Australian economy it simply is not the<br />
case that why we have got high monetary policy is because<br />
a couple of people have blown their top. It just simply<br />
isn't true.<br />
CHIPP: Given that high interest rates are necessary at<br />
the moment for the reasons that you have given, to dampen<br />
domestic demand, you have predicted a fall of interest<br />
rates, your opponent Mr Peacock, extraordinarily has<br />
predicted a massive fall whatever that means<br />
PM-He is trying to jump<br />
CHIPP: Can you explain to me in simple language how with<br />
the balance of payments of $ 2 billion a month in deficit,<br />
inflation in our country as high if not higher than most<br />
OECD partners, a monthly foreign exchange shortfall still<br />
haven't been met by borrowings, how in the name of God<br />
are you going to reduce interest rates in the next 12<br />
months? PM: Very simple. Let me tell you the basic economic<br />
reasons and then I will give you a couple of quotes from </p>
<p>within the banking industry to confirm what I am saying.<br />
The reason why interest rates can come down is very<br />
simple, is that the policies that we have had in place<br />
are working, that is the level of activity is coming<br />
down. We had to have high interest rates, as you<br />
understand and accept, to lower the level of activity,<br />
that is happening the level of activity is coming down<br />
CHIPP: But your car sales for January were a record<br />
PM: I am telling you that the overall economic<br />
indicators Don show a decline in demand. If you look at<br />
the aggregrate figures it shows a decline in demand<br />
recognised, no-one is arguing that, the Opposition is not<br />
arguing it that the decline in demand is happening. The<br />
second thing Don is that the price of money to the banks<br />
is declining, that was decided before the election<br />
started and the prime rates have started to come down.<br />
The cost of money to the banks is declining and as the<br />
cost of money to them declines so they will move to a<br />
position where the charge that they make for money that<br />
they lend will come down and so you have got the<br />
combination, the inter-related combination of facts of<br />
the lowering of the level of activity, the lowering of<br />
the cost of money to the banks will mean that it will<br />
come down. Just let me give you the quotes from within<br />
the last 24 hours. St George Building Society the<br />
trends are still positive, a fall in interest rates the<br />
reasonable expection. The ANZ Bank spokesman the<br />
direction of change will be towards lower interest rates.<br />
These are the statements coming from within the banking<br />
industry on the basis of the fundamental economics that I<br />
have just put to you.<br />
CHIPP: You do not resile from former statements that you<br />
do not rule out a fall in home mortgage rates before<br />
Christmas. PM: Of course I don't.<br />
CHIPP: Prime Minister do you mind if my salary is paid<br />
for by playing an ad now. Could you just for about<br />
one minute.<br />
PM: I know you need the money.<br />
CftIPP: Prime Minister, can you give me an unequivocal<br />
guarantee that if you win, and health permitting, you'll<br />
serve at least two thirds of the next Parliament?<br />
PM: I can go further than that. I will serve the whole<br />
of the next Parliament, Don, and I've said this<br />
consistently and it's interesting what the environment is<br />
in which it'ls been necessary to repeat that, because<br />
paradoxically the reason it's coming up is because the<br />
Liberals have a leadership crisis. The Liberals have a<br />
leadership crisis and you know that. John Howard ousted<br />
by Andrew Peacock, unreconciled to it, who said he </p>
<p>doesn't trust him and so you ' ye got this terrible pinch<br />
in there and they know there's a problem, they know<br />
there's a public perception of the Liberal Party that<br />
can't govern itself and therefore can't govern the<br />
country. So what's, they try and divert their attention<br />
in saying oh, this bloke Hawke, you know, the mob seem<br />
to like him a bit so we'll try and create a furphy that<br />
you're not really voting for Bob Hawke you're voting for<br />
someone else. The fact is that I will run this full term<br />
CHIPP: My question is fair because you, in my view<br />
would be absolutely entitled after serving two years at<br />
least in this term to say well, look I'll give it away,<br />
I've got something else to do, but if you give a<br />
guarantee at least two thirds, but you've gone further<br />
than that, you've given three years out of the three.<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
CHIPP: Yes, well if you lose will you continue on in<br />
Parliament or will you resign?<br />
PM: Look I just simply don't think we, we will lose and,<br />
you know, that's, that's a hypothetical, you know, I<br />
don't really prepare to go to. Can I ask you a question?<br />
CHIPP: Well it's not an impossible situation is it?<br />
PM: No, of course it's not.<br />
CHIPP: I think it's fair to ask<br />
PM: Fair to ask.<br />
CHIPP: Prime Minister of Australia if he loses the<br />
election, will he continue<br />
PM: Well I've indicated and the straight, fair and<br />
honest answer is this. I mean, that's hypothetical I<br />
simply say to you this. If that were to happen I would<br />
put myself in the hands of the Party and if the Party<br />
thought and if they pressed me to stay in those<br />
circumstances, I would consider it and if it were their<br />
judgement that they thought they could do better with<br />
someone else, I would gladly accept that. I mean, the<br />
L-ftor Party in those circumstances wouldn't find Bob<br />
Hawke scrambling and gnawing away to try and stay in<br />
office and I would simply say to them in that, what I<br />
regard as a hypothetical situation, I'd simply say to<br />
them look, if you want me to stay on I'll think about<br />
it CHIPP: You go no further than that?<br />
PM: Well, I mean, obviously </p>
<p>CHIPP: Because you know Labor Party tradition and it's<br />
loyal to leaders and future, and former leaders.<br />
PM: Yes but I would be in their hands. The Labor<br />
Party has been very good to me and I love the Labor Party<br />
and my position would simply be, Don, well if it's your<br />
wish that I stay on in those circumstances I would<br />
seriously consider it. I don't know that in the end that<br />
I would, but I would seriously consider staying on. But<br />
on the other hand if their judgement was in those<br />
circumstances they thought they could do better with<br />
someone else, that would have my wholehearted<br />
endorsement. CHIPP: Prime Minister, in my judgement there's three big<br />
issues here in this election the economy and high<br />
interest rates and whatever, the environment and health.<br />
Now health, could I just ask you what's wrong with me,<br />
Don Chipp. What's wrong with you allowing me to..<br />
Medicare, Medicare levels, the levy, provided I give you<br />
evidence in my taxation return that I've taken out<br />
private health, private health care and that you make<br />
that private health care premium tax deductible. What's<br />
wrong with that?<br />
PM: Well, we've been there, done that as a country. You<br />
know really what the answer to your question is because<br />
we had a situation where that concept was tried.<br />
CHIPP: It was never compulsory though.<br />
PM: Yes, but what happened, Don, is, if you look at the,<br />
if you look at the statistics that were brought out<br />
yesterday and published in today's paper, the estimate is<br />
that 25 percent of taxpayers paid half of the Medicare<br />
levy. They pay $ 1.3 billion and the next 20 percent paid<br />
a quarter. In other words, those people who are best off<br />
in the community pay, as it would be expected, the<br />
greatest proportion of the Medicare levy. Now you allow<br />
those people to drop out in the way you're talking about<br />
and you just move straight back to the repetition of the<br />
situation I inherited when I became Prime Minister in<br />
1983.<br />
CHIPP: Except everybody would be insured, it would be<br />
compulsory I4<br />
PM: But you can't, you can't work it that way. What<br />
you're saying is really a repetition of what I inherited<br />
in ' 83. The concept that you'll allow people to, to opt<br />
out and the people that are best situated do that and you<br />
have, what I inherited, 2 million of my fellow<br />
Australians when I came to office, 2 million of my fellow<br />
Australians were uncovered, uncovered. Now that is an<br />
absurdity and that's why the overwhelming majority of<br />
Australians are in favour of the situation of Medicare.<br />
Why? Because it has the two features that the<br />
conservatives have never been able to bring in in all </p>
<p>their jumping and changing and hopelessness, the two<br />
features are universality, that means that not one of our<br />
fellow Australians, Don, not one of our fellow<br />
Australians has to fear the doctors' bill or the hospital<br />
bill. CHIPP: So if they're knocked over in the street, no-one<br />
need fear they'd be let lay there. I happens in most<br />
States of America.<br />
PM: Yes, well<br />
CHIPP: But both parties have got that in their policies<br />
haven't they?<br />
PM: They've got what?<br />
CHIPP: Universality.<br />
PM: No, no they haven't. As far as, as far as the<br />
conservatives are concerned, they haven't got a policy.<br />
They haven't got a policy. They've been seven years in<br />
Opposition and you had Mr Shack getting up and saying two<br />
things, two things Don. Firstly he said and the words<br />
will be, you know, down in the tablets of political<br />
history won't they, he said the record of, he said the<br />
Liberals and National Party haven't got a particularly<br />
good record in health and I don't need to remind you, he<br />
said, of our period in Government. In other words he<br />
said their record was hopeless in. Government and<br />
Opposition and the second thing he said, well we haven't<br />
got a policy yet, he said what we'll do if you elect us,<br />
we'll appoint a committee. They had seven years in<br />
Opposition, to get a, get a policy, they haven't got one<br />
and they've said well, we'll have a committee. You know<br />
who'll be on the committee? The representatives of the<br />
private health funds and the doctors and what a nice<br />
little, you know, they'll cook up between them, never<br />
have the interests of the, of the ordinary Australians at<br />
heart CHIPP: Prime Minister, would you mind taking some calls?<br />
Our switchboard has lit up like a firestorm?<br />
PM: Can I ask you a couple of questions first?<br />
CMIPP: Do you fancy yourself as an interviewer?<br />
PM: No I don't, but I mean<br />
CHIPP: You do, you know.<br />
PM: You've said that publicly<br />
PM: I'd like to do it yes. </p>
<p>CHIPP: I think that would be fascinating. You have in<br />
mind with the reputation you have worldwide that you<br />
could interview top, top world players, Gorbachev?<br />
PM: I don't want to get into an argument about it, but<br />
CHIPP: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: I don't want to but as Prime Minister<br />
CHIPP: your question?<br />
PM: Well, just a couple.<br />
CHIPP: Carlton's the answer and they're going to be<br />
Premiers. PM: Couple of questions. Now look, you know, you<br />
founded the Democrats. What do you think of the idea of<br />
the Democrats which you set up to go in the Senate to<br />
keep the bastards honest, to you know to quote that<br />
memoral phrase<br />
CHIPP: Well it kept you honest a few times.<br />
PM: Yes, and you're a great bloke to deal with I must<br />
say.<br />
CHIPP: Thank you.<br />
PM: What do you think about the idea of the Australian<br />
Democrats contesting seats in the House of<br />
Representatives? CHIPP: I've always been opposed to it because it puts<br />
the temptation before the candidates of the Democrats to<br />
be all things to all people. Now one of the things I<br />
used to love as a Democrat was that I only had to court<br />
percent of the vote to get the balance in the Senate.<br />
If you have to go out the House of Representatives,<br />
then you've got to go soft on those pressure groups that<br />
I once despised. For example, the Reverend Fred Nile's a<br />
sincere bloke, but part of my, part of the few joys of my<br />
Parliamentary career was getting stuck into Fred. Now I<br />
couldn't do that if I was looking for a House of<br />
R~ presentatives seat, the temptation and, to her credit,<br />
Janine. Haines has resisted it to my knowledge, but the<br />
temptation would be to dip your principles just a wee<br />
bit. PM: Could I ask you a second question? You founded the<br />
Democrats, I assume you'll vote the Democrats, but taking<br />
the particularly the issues like education, health<br />
and the environment, they're fundamentally important to<br />
the Democrats. Where would you say the second preference<br />
should go? </p>
<p>CHIPP: Well, that's I'd find it intolerable if you<br />
pressed me for an answer on that because how I vote is my<br />
business and it would be totally improper of me as a<br />
broadcaster to be advising my listeners how to vote. All<br />
I'd say is this in response to your question. I think<br />
I'd be fairly confident in saying it Democrats are<br />
thinking, sensible people. People who vote Democrat,<br />
they've thought about the issues, they've thought about<br />
the Parties and they cast their vote for a Democrat.<br />
They would then go through the policies of the other<br />
Parties, particularly the nuclear policies, particularly<br />
the health policy and particularly, more than anything<br />
else, the environment policy. I would have thought that<br />
the Democrat voters would give their second preference<br />
after voting Democrat to that Party that had the better<br />
environment policy, the better industrial relations<br />
policy and the better health policy.<br />
PM: And there's no doubt which Party, that comes the<br />
Labor Party.<br />
CHIPP: Well there is no doubt in your mind.<br />
PM: ( inaudible)<br />
CHIPP: Sorry?<br />
PM: Are you<br />
CHIPP: No comment. Prime Minister, do you mind taking a<br />
call or two?<br />
PM: I'd love to.<br />
CHIPP: We go to Richard and for those of you calling in,<br />
we've got a firestorm on this switchboard. If you could<br />
keep your questions very brief, I'd be grateful. Richard<br />
of Doncaster, talk to the Prime Minister of Australia.<br />
CALLER: Good morning, Don, Prime Minister. Thank you<br />
for this opportunity.<br />
PM: Thank you Richard.<br />
CALLER: All the obvious catastrophe, catastrophes of<br />
your Government concern me high taxation, record high<br />
home loan interest rates, some of these in part have<br />
increased, this week through the banking sytem, record<br />
high business loans that I believe are directly<br />
contributing to business failures, 10,000 since Christmas<br />
and continuing high inflation, particularly by world<br />
standards one of the highest, and so on. So these all<br />
affect the average Australian standard of living. What<br />
really worries me, however<br />
CHIPP: Come to your question please. </p>
<p>CALLER: What really worries me is the absence of any<br />
plan or commitment by the Government to solve the root<br />
cause of these cancers on our way of life and that is the<br />
continuing horrific balance of payments position.<br />
CHIPP: Alright, Richard, let's answer your questions and<br />
get rid of your mistakes and I'll do it in order.<br />
Taxation, you've already heard me talking to Don. The<br />
facts are the opposite of what you say. The facts are<br />
that when the conservatives walked out of office they<br />
walked out of office with a top rate of 60 cents in the<br />
dollar and the bottom rate of 30. I've reduced that<br />
to 47 and the bottom one from 30 to 21 and as I pointed<br />
out to Don, and Don concedes, basically because I have<br />
made those with the greatest capacity to pay pay where it<br />
was a matter of choice before by having the capital gains<br />
tax which these people now say they'll take of f and put<br />
billions of dollars back in the hands of less than one<br />
percent of the population which will mean very simply<br />
that ordinary people would pay more. The fact is that<br />
Australia is one of the lowest tax countries in the OECD.<br />
There are only three that have more. In regard to<br />
interest rates, record high. Untrue. 90 day bill rates<br />
reached 22 percent in April 1982 under the conservatives,<br />
they've never reached that under us. Inflation? When I<br />
came to office I inherited an inflation rate of 11<br />
percent and we have brought it down from that. It has<br />
never reached 11 percent under us. So unfortunately,<br />
Richard, on what you've paraded are prejudices and not<br />
facts.<br />
CHIPP: Helene from Carlton. Good morning, Helene.<br />
CALLER: Good morning Don. Prime Minister, a lot of<br />
people are worried about the foreign debt and balance of<br />
payments and the influence these have on interest rates.<br />
In your policy speech you said a lot of interesting<br />
things in relation to your future Government science,<br />
education and general social policies. While these are<br />
interesting in themselves, what impact if any can they in<br />
a practical sense really make on the economic issues<br />
which we're all so worried about?<br />
PM: Well, Helene, let me make the point that in my<br />
policy speech that was not the only time during this<br />
election campaign where I've addressed the issues that<br />
y~ u are talking about. And in fact we have three<br />
. fundamental,. three. f undamental.. policies in place directed<br />
towards the question of our foreign debt problem. Now<br />
let me just go to them quickly and point out for each of<br />
them the position of our opponents is disastrous. I<br />
pointed out to Don, we've got a wages policy in place<br />
which gives predictable outcomes which means that our<br />
industry has become more competitive and you've heard me<br />
talk about the things that we are now exporting, the<br />
manufactured goods we couldn't before. Against that<br />
tight wages policy, against that, you've got the<br />
certainty of a wages explosion from, from our opponents </p>
<p>which would mean, again, not only in regard to foreign<br />
debt but in regard to the economy, disaster. Second,<br />
you've got the budget policies. I have produced $ 17<br />
billion surplus in the last three years which has wiped<br />
out, wiped out, eliminated the Commonwealth Government<br />
overseas debt. We are credited to the tune of $ 4.4<br />
billion. The policies of our opponents would dissipate<br />
the surplus, they've got a between $ 6 and $ 7 billion<br />
fiscal hold and they'd give billions of dollars back out<br />
of the capital gains. And third, superannuation. We<br />
have a savings plan for the future which the Liberals<br />
would destroy.<br />
CHIPP: Des, from South Yarra. Good morning, Des.<br />
CALLER: Good morning Don.<br />
CHIPP: Talk to the Prime Minister.<br />
CALLER: Mr Hawke, you've stated that high interest rates<br />
are needed to reduce spending. I want to make three<br />
points. PM: Yes.<br />
CALLER: The first is that before high interest rates<br />
affect the importer, which is the real spending you're<br />
trying to get at, they destroy-the man in the street who<br />
can't pay his mortgage, the building industry that can't<br />
afford the costs, manufacturers have become<br />
uncompetitive and can't pay for their new machinery,<br />
exporters are no longer internationally competitive,<br />
farmers, retailers and so on. And the last person to be<br />
affected is the importer. Everyone else goes bust before<br />
them. The second point is that by stating strong<br />
economy you've proven you're incompetent of running a<br />
strong economy and what we want is a Government that can<br />
run a strong economy, not one that has to give us a<br />
poison pill high interest rates.<br />
CHIPP: Des, we've got to leave it there.<br />
PM: Let's deal with that. You're saying you destroy the<br />
export competitor. The fact is if that were so we would<br />
not have, as we've had over the last four years, a 54<br />
percent real increase in the export of manufactured<br />
gt~ ods. We have a situation now where we're exporting<br />
steel to the world where before, after seven years of my<br />
opponents they were going to shut down the steel industry<br />
Des, we have a situation where we're exporting cars and<br />
car components to Japan and the United States. Not<br />
compatible with your prejudicial assertion that export<br />
competiteness is being destroyed. I mean, it's a good<br />
idea when you're talking on these things to get rid of<br />
the prejudices and go to the facts. Now as regards the<br />
situation that you're talking about of people being<br />
destroyed, before you get to your, before you get to<br />
importers and it simply isn't the case. Let's look at </p>
<p>16<br />
what has in fact happened about running a strong economy,<br />
that you can't run a strong economy. Just let me give<br />
you the facts. The rate of economic growth in the seven<br />
years of my Government and these are facts, not opinions,<br />
Des, so please write them down and remember them and<br />
substitute the facts for your prejudice. The fact is<br />
that the average rate of growth in real terms of GDP in<br />
the seven years of my Government, 4.4 percent against the<br />
2.3 percent of the conservatives in their seven years,<br />
the rate of employment growth, Des, 3.5 percent per annum<br />
against their 0.7 percent per annum. In their last 12<br />
months the economy went into its worst recession in<br />
years with an additional quarter of a million people<br />
being found on the unemployment scrapheap. They<br />
destroyed the economy. Did what has never been done<br />
before in the history of this country, had simultaneous<br />
double digit unemployment and double digit inflation.<br />
We've rescued the economy and given a rate of employment<br />
growth which is twice as fast as the rest of the world.<br />
They're facts, facts, facts. So substitute facts for<br />
your prejudice, mate.<br />
CHIPP: Thanks Des. Go to Norm from Doncaster. Good<br />
morning Norm.<br />
CALLER: Good morning Don. Prime Minister, I'd like to<br />
ask you to clear up some confusion I have on capital<br />
gains tax.<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
CALLER: The Liberal Party advertisements from spokesmen<br />
quote some figures and percentages in relation to this<br />
tax, such as John Howard's ad strategy on four million<br />
Australians will be affected. Also the tax will be<br />
levied on people with salaries as low as $ 35,000 and<br />
superannuation payments will be by the tax. I agree<br />
with the principle of the capital gains tax where people<br />
with capacity should pay, but I don't hear any clear<br />
rebuttals from the Libs, on the Liberals claims by Labor<br />
Party people. Mr Hawke, I'd like to ask your comments<br />
and a clear definition of Labor's policy on capital gains<br />
tax. Who will it affect and its impact on<br />
superannuation?<br />
PM: Well, I'll tell you who it will affect. It will<br />
a&amp; ffect basically less than one percent of Australian<br />
taxpayers,. basically less than one percent and those<br />
figures have now basically been accepted by Mr Peacock<br />
and Dr Hewson after they tried to waffle around in the<br />
first place. And as far as superannuation is concerned,<br />
the situation with it is the industry itself conceded<br />
through its major funds that, properly managed,<br />
superannuation funds can more than offset any tax impost<br />
by the of imputation credits. But just let me give<br />
you two quotes which will in fact tell you, Norm, why in<br />
fact we must have the capital gains tax in this country.<br />
And you've heard me, what I said to Don before, as to why </p>
<p>it was necessary to make the rich pay. But let me just<br />
quote from The Age and the Melbourne Herald. The Age<br />
the principle the coalition is defending is the right of<br />
the rich to pay taxes only if they so choose. This<br />
principle is clearly abnoxious. And the Melbourne<br />
Herald, Norm, not one that's normally out there starving<br />
Labor policy this is what they said at the end of last<br />
year Mr Peacock proposes to turn back the clock and<br />
once again unleash the might of the legal accounting and<br />
financial professions in the drive to turn otherwise<br />
taxable income into tax free capital gains of five years<br />
standing. That is unacceptable, not only on equity<br />
grounds, said the Herald, but in terms of the very<br />
changes necessary to make Australia more competitive and<br />
more efficient.<br />
CHIPP: Prime Minister, I'm sorry we've got to leave it<br />
there. The clock is rolling on to ten and we've got to<br />
go to the news. I want to tell you how honoured I am and<br />
grateful I am to you for appearing on the program.<br />
PM: Don, it's been my pleasure to be with you and I<br />
thank you very much and to your listeners.<br />
