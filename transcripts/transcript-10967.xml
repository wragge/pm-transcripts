    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE.................................................................................................</p>
<p>Thank you very much Mr Vaile, to Mrs Carnell, the Chief Minister of</p>
<p> the ACT, to my many Ministerial and Parliamentary colleagues, ladies</p>
<p> and gentleman.</p>
<p>At various stages of our history the notion and the ideal of nation</p>
<p> building has always captured the attention and the affection of Australians.</p>
<p> It was the notion of nation building that drove the founding fathers</p>
<p> towards federation almost a hundred years ago. And it will, of course,</p>
<p> be very natural, as we come towards the centenary of federation, that</p>
<p> we think of the great nation-building events that have occurred in</p>
<p> the past and also turn our gaze to the nation-building events of all</p>
<p> kinds that will shape our future. And many of the policies of the</p>
<p> Federal Government are built around the ideal, the continuing ideal,</p>
<p> of nation building. And it is in the context of building the nation's</p>
<p> economy, in an even stronger way, that next week I will have something</p>
<p> to say about the Government's exciting plans to reform Australia's</p>
<p> taxation system. But I'm not about to give you a sneak preview</p>
<p> of that today. That will come next week. But it is true, as Mark Vaile</p>
<p> said, that we are experiencing, literally, the rebirth and the revival</p>
<p> of rail in Australia.</p>
<p>The rail system that the Government inherited a couple of years ago</p>
<p> was in need of change and reform and there was a very large financial</p>
<p> blackhole involved in that system. But we have followed a very clear</p>
<p> strategy to rebuild rail in Australia and largely, as a result of</p>
<p> that, the private sector is now reinvesting in rail throughout our</p>
<p> nation. The Alice Springs-to-Darwin and the Melbourne-to-Darwin inland</p>
<p> railway offer, potentially, enormous benefits to our nation. And by</p>
<p> announcing today the Canberra-to-Sydney consortium to proceed to the</p>
<p> confirmation stage, another building block is being laid in the revival</p>
<p> of Australian rail.</p>
<p>The proponents contend it will be achieved at no net cost to government</p>
<p> in keeping with the original condition. And they estimate that the</p>
<p> benefits to the nation will be in the order of $5.9 billion. There</p>
<p> will thousands of jobs created. There will be immense regional development,</p>
<p> particularly in the communities of Goulburn, Campbelltown and the</p>
<p> Southern Highlands.</p>
<p>And before announcing the consortium that has won the right to proceed</p>
<p> to a confirmation stage, I would like to pay a tribute to the four</p>
<p> consortia that put forward proposals. All four consortia provided</p>
<p> quality submissions that were visionary in their scope. I also acknowledge</p>
<p> publicly the members of the Joint Project Control Group, chaired by</p>
<p> Ron Brown, which has made this announcement possible. In consultation</p>
<p> with New South Wales and the ACT, the governments have accepted the</p>
<p> recommendation of the Independent Project Evaluation Committee. It</p>
<p> is with great pleasure I announce Speedrail as the successful consortium</p>
<p> for the Very High Speed Train rail link from Sydney-to-Canberra.</p>
<p>This train is to travel at up to 320 km/h to complete the Sydney/Canberra</p>
<p> journey in just 81 minutes, offering, in every sense of the word,</p>
<p> a competitive alternative to air travel. The $3.5 billion project</p>
<p> proposed by Speedrail will be one of the largest infrastructure projects</p>
<p> in Australia's history. Moreover 80% of the resources needed to complete</p>
<p> the project, by the year 2003 will come from within Australia. Thousands</p>
<p> of jobs will be created during the construction phase. Speedrail will</p>
<p> now enter a confirmation phase with the Federal, New South Wales and</p>
<p> ACT Governments to confirm access and financing arrangements to allow</p>
<p> the project to commence.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentleman, this is a bold and visionary initiative. And</p>
<p> while the Canberra to Sydney bids were assessed solely on the basis</p>
<p> of the criteria set down for this stand alone project, a Canberra-to-Sydney</p>
<p> line does leave open the possibility of extension to other cities.</p>
<p> Accordingly I have asked Mr Bob Mansfield to establish a committee</p>
<p> to examine the possibilities for expanding the scope of the Very High</p>
<p> Speed Train transport in Australia. My Government is immensely proud</p>
<p> to have played a major role in creating the environment in which the</p>
<p> private sector feels encouraged to invest in the future of Australia</p>
<p> and Australian transport.</p>
<p>I would like to pay particular tribute to the energy and commitment</p>
<p> of Mrs Carnell, the Chief Minister of the ACT. She has been a very</p>
<p> powerful advocate of this project and I congratulate her for that.</p>
<p> I did speak to Mr Carr yesterday afternoon and he regrets not being</p>
<p> here but he asked me to convey to the gathering the total support</p>
<p> of the New South Wales' Government towards the project. And I'd</p>
<p> also like to acknowledge the presence of the former Minister for Transport</p>
<p> and Regional Development, John Sharp, who played a very significant</p>
<p> part on the part of the Federal Government in the inauguration of</p>
<p> this project.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, as I said at the beginning of my speech the</p>
<p> notion and the concept of nation building has always been very close</p>
<p> to the hearts of Australians. It drove federation almost a hundred</p>
<p> years ago, it drove the great waves of post war immigration after</p>
<p> World War II, it has driven many decisions by many governments and</p>
<p> it has driven many investors who care about the future of our country.</p>
<p> And it is entirely appropriate as we approach the Centenary of Federation</p>
<p> that not only we reflect on those events that have built the nation</p>
<p> in the past and given us what we have now, but we also embrace those</p>
<p> projects and those ventures and those policy changes which will further</p>
<p> build the strength of the nation as we go into the 21st</p>
<p> century. Speedrail is a pragmatic and visionary expression of that</p>
<p> theme and that concept of nation building.</p>
<p>I congratulate the successful consortium, I thank the others who contributed,</p>
<p> I wish all those involved great success and I assure the project of</p>
<p> the unrelenting and continuing support of the Federal Government.</p>
<p> Thank you.</p>
