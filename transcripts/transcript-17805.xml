The Australian Government will provide a package of food aid to the town of Minami-Sanriku in Miyagi prefecture, where the Australian Urban Search and Rescue Team was deployed in the aftermath of the recent earthquake and tsunami.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Julia Gillard said the care package would provide the people of Minami-Sanriku with some much needed food and comfort as they recover from the March 11 disaster. </p>
<p>The request for food assistance and soft toys for the children came from the Mayor of Minami-Sanriku, Mr Sato, and the Japanese Government.</p>
<p>The Australian Government is very happy to be able to assist with this request on behalf of the nation.</p>
<p>We hope this food aid will help the people of Minami-Sanriku at this very difficult time, and in their immense task of rebuilding.</p>
<p>The care package includes:</p>
<p> * 	7,000 cans of soup, baked beans and canned spaghetti<br />
 * 	2,000 packets of chocolate biscuits (including Tim Tams and Chocolate Montes)<br />
 * 	372 packets of dried fruit<br />
 * 	5,000 Byron Bay cookies<br />
 * 	4,000 packets of beef jerky<br />
 * 	3,800 packets of canned Australian beef/curry pouches, donated through Meat and Livestock Australia<br />
 * 	Soft toys including 1,500 koalas from Tourism Australia</p>
<p>The Prime Minister said the majority of the package was already on its way to Minami-Sanriku, having arrived in Tokyo this morning.</p>
<p>Much of the food package has been delivered free of charge by Qantas, in a very generous gesture by the Australian airline.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister visited the ruins of the town centre with the Mayor and the Japanese Foreign Minister Takeaki Matsumoto.</p>
<p>With them was Australian Search and Rescue team leader Rob McNeil who showed the Prime Minister some of the areas where they carried out the harrowing search for survivors.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister then visited a nearby evacuation centre to talk with families whose homes were washed away on March 11.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister said she brought the best wishes and support of the nation who will continue to support the people of Japan as they rebuild from this devastating event.</p>
