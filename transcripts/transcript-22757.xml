    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Rudd Government will deliver up to $5.3 million to upgrade Townsvilleâs Tony Ireland Stadium to help secure the future of cricket and football in north Queensland.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister and Minister for Regional Australia today announced the funding in Townsville as part of the Governmentâs economic development plan for northern Queensland.</p>
<p>This funding will be matched by the Townsville City Council to deliver the $10.6 million project.</p>
<p>The 10,000-seat Tony Ireland Stadium is the only professional grade AFL and cricket facility in northern Queensland but its lighting prevents the staging and televising of most national and international matches.</p>
<p>That will change once the lighting and stadium upgrade has been completed.</p>
<p>This is good news for tourism and the economy, and it is good news for the north Queensland community.</p>
<p>Local families, schools and teams of all abilities and ages will be able to use a top-class facilities right in the backyard.</p>
<p>And it will allow Townsville to bring national international standard events to the Tony Ireland Stadium.</p>
<p>This upgrade will improve lighting from 200 lux to 1200 lux intensity, reinforce existing light poles, involve significant electrical works.</p>
<p>It is part of our positive plan for regional development in northern Queensland for the future.</p>
<p>The Government has been working with the northern Queensland Regional Development Australia (RDA) committees and stakeholders to identify priorities to support growth.</p>
<p>The region generates approximately $60 billion in gross regional product annually from mining, agriculture, energy, education and tourism.</p>
<p>North Queensland has an exciting future and the Rudd Government is committed to working with the community to support jobs and unlock future growth. </p>
