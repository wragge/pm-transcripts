EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
CAI ANNUAL DINNER<br />
CANBERRA 28 NOVEMBER 1985<br />
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN<br />
IT GIVES ME MUCH PLEASURE TO SPEAK ON THIS OCCASION OF YOUR<br />
ANNUAL DINNER. WE IN GOVERNMENT RECOGNISE THE IMPORTANCE OF<br />
THE CAI AS A MAJOR EMPLOYER GROUP AND AN INTEGRAL PART OF<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS SYSTEM. YOUR<br />
ORGANISATION HAS PLAYED A VALUABLE ROLE IN REPRESENTING A<br />
WIDE RANGE OF BUSINESS INTERESTS AND IN ASSISTING THIS<br />
GOVERNMENT DEVELOP POLICIES RELEVANT TO INDUSTRY.<br />
RECENTLY THERE HAVE BEEN SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT ASPECTS OF THE<br />
GOVERNMENT'S ECONOMIC STRATEGY, DESPITE THE VERY IMPRESSIVE<br />
TURNAROUND OF THE REAL ECONOMY SINCE THIS GOVERNMENT ASSUMED<br />
OFFICE. THIS QUESTIONING HAS BEEN GIVEN SOME FOCUS BY THE<br />
RECENT BEHAVIOUR OF THE AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR.<br />
TONIGHT, I WANT TO OUTLINE TO YOU WHY THE GOVERNMENT<br />
BELIEVES THAT THE FUNDAMENTALS OF OUR ECONOMIC STRATEGY ARE<br />
CORRECT. IN PARTICULAR, I WANT TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE<br />
GOVERNMENT'S PRICES AND INCOMES POLICY AND THE ACCORD.<br />
SINCE THE GOVERNMENT CAME TO OFFICE IN MARCH 1983, WE HAVE<br />
STEADFASTLY APPLIED A COHERENT ECONOMIC STRATEGY TO RESTORE<br />
SUSTAINED ECONOMIC GROWTH TO THE AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY, AND TO<br />
REVITALISE AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRY.<br />
DURING THAT PERIOD WE HAVE SOUGHT TO CORRECT THE IMBALANCES<br />
IN THE ECONOMY WHICH WE INHERITED IN EARLY 1983. THESE<br />
INCLUDED ENTRENCHED INDUSTRIAL DISHARMONY, DOUBLE DIGIT<br />
INFLATION, RISING UNEMPLOYMENT, A SUBSTANTIAL AND RISING<br />
BUDGET DEFICIT, A COLLAPSE IN THE PROFIT SHARE, POOR<br />
INTERNATIONAL COMPETITIVENESS AND A TIRED AND COMPLACENT<br />
INDUSTRIAL BASE.<br />
AND, IN EACH CASE WE HAVE SUCCEEDED.<br />
IMBALANCES SUCH AS THESE HAD BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR A DECADE<br />
OF POOR ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE AND, IF WE HAD NOT ACTED, WOULD<br />
HAVE CONTINUED TO DRAG ON OUR GROWTH POTENTIAL. </p>
<p>THE GOVERNMENT'S APPROACH TO THESE PROBLEMS HAS BEEN TO<br />
IMPLEMENT A RANGE OF COMPLEMENTARY ECONOMIC POLICIES.<br />
MOST FREQUENTLY OVERLOOKED ARE POLICIES TO IMPROVE<br />
AUSTRALIA'S ABILITY TO ADAPT AND TO MAKE THE MOST OF OUR<br />
OPPORTUNITIES. THESE INCLUDE POLICIES AIMED AT REMOVING REGULATORY<br />
IMPEDIMENTS TO DEVELOPMENT AND GROWTH.<br />
THEY ENCOMPASS TRADE POLICIES WHICH SEEK TO EXPAND<br />
AUSTRALIA'S OPPORTUNITIES TO EXPORT, PARTICULARLY IN THE<br />
ASIA-PACIFIC REGION,.<br />
THEY ENCOMPASS INDUSTRY POLICIES WHICH SEEK TO FOSTER NOT<br />
ONLY EFFICIENT AND FLEXIBLE INDUSTRIES, BUT ALSO FORWARD<br />
LOOKING, EXPORT-ORIENTED ENTERPRISES.<br />
THEY ENCOMPASS EDUCATION AND TRAINING POLICIES TO IMPROVE<br />
AND ENHANCE AUSTRALIA'S HUMAN RESOURCES AND RAISE SKILL<br />
LEVE. LS PARTICULARLY OF OUR YOUNG PEOPLE.<br />
AND, TO PROVIDE A SUITABLE MACROECONOMIC FRAMEWORK FOR<br />
STEADY FORWARD MOMENTUM, THEY INCLUDE MONETARY, FISCAL AND<br />
INCOMES POLICIES DESIGNED INITIALLY TO GET THE ECONOMY<br />
MOVING AGAIN AND THEN TO SUSTAIN GROWTH. IT IS TO THESE<br />
ELEMENTS OF OUR POLICY APPROACH THAT I WISH TO DEVOTE MOST<br />
ATTENTION THIS EVENING.<br />
IT IS NOW WELL ACCEPTED THAT THE AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY HAS<br />
PERFORMED EXCEPTIONALLY WELL IN THE FIRST PHASE OF ITS<br />
ECONOMIC RECOVERY. OUR ECONOMIC GROWTH RATES HAVE BEEN THE<br />
BEST OR CLOSE TO THE BEST IN THE WORLD. WE ARE CLOSE TO<br />
DELIVERING ON OUR COMMITMENT OF 500,000 NEW JOBS, WELL<br />
WITHIN THE THREE-YEAR TIME FRAME. MOREOVER, FOR THE FIRST<br />
TIME IN OVER THREE YEARS, THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS BELOW 8<br />
PER CENT.<br />
THE CONJUNCTION OF OUR POLICIES HAS BROUGHT MAJOR BENEFITS<br />
TO BUSINESS.<br />
THE INFLATION RATE LAST YEAR WAS THE LOWEST SINCE 1970-71.<br />
REAL UNIT COSTS OF EMPLOYING LABOUR HAVE FALLEN<br />
SUBSTANTIALLY IN EACH OF THE LAST TWO YEARS, PRODUCING ALSO<br />
A SHARP RESTORATION OF PROFITABILITY. INDUSTRIAL<br />
DISPUTATION HAS BEEN AT ITS LOWEST IN ALMOST TWO DECADES<br />
AND, OVERALL, THERE IS A MORE SECURE AND PREDICTABLE<br />
BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT.<br />
HOWEVER, WITH THOSE ACHIEVEMENTS BEHIND US, THE RECOVERY IS<br />
NOW ENTERING A MORE MATURE PHASE: A PHASE WHICH, IN EARLIER<br />
RECOVERIES, HAS PROVED TO BE ALL TOO SHORT-LIVED.<br />
THE GOVERNMENT IS CONFIDENT THAT, EVEN IF WORLD GROWTH<br />
MODERATES SOMEWHAT, AUSTRALIA WILL CONTINUE TO GROW SOLIDLY<br />
AND DO SO IN A WAY WHICH WILL NOT GENERATE EXCESSIVE<br />
INFLATION; WHICH WILL PERMIT THE NECESSARY IMPROVEMENT IN<br />
OUR CURRENT ACCOUNT; AND WHICH CAN THUS BE CONSISTENT WITH<br />
A SUSTAINED RISE IN OUTPUT AND EMPLOYMENT. </p>
<p>THE REASONS FOR OUR CONTINUED CONFIDENCE ARE THAT ECONOMIC<br />
POLICY HAS BEEN SET WITH THIS END IN VIEW FOR SOME TIME, AND<br />
THE RESULTS TO DATE, WHICH I ALLUDED TO EARLIER.<br />
THE DEPRECIATION, COUPLED WITH OUR POLICY RESPONSES, IS ALSO<br />
A MAJOR FACTOR IN THIS OUTLOOK.<br />
THE POLICY RESPONSES TO DEPRECIATION HAVE BEEN OF TWO KINDS.<br />
FIRST WE HAVE TAKEN DIRECT ACTION, WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THE<br />
ACCORD, TO INSULATE DOMESTIC COSTS FROM THE DIRECT<br />
INFLATIONARY EFFECTS OF DEPRECIATION AND THUS TO PRESERVE<br />
THE IMPROVEMENT IN OUR COMPETITIVENESS. I WISH TO RETURN TO<br />
THIS ASPECT LATER.<br />
SECOND WE HAVE SET MONETARY AND FISCAL POLICY ON A COURSE TO<br />
SLOW THE GROWTH OF DOMESTIC DEMAND FROM ITS PRESENT TOO<br />
RAPID PACE AND THUS TO ENSURE THAT THE STIMULUS TO GROWTH<br />
WHICH DEPRECIATION WILL PROGRESSIVELY IMPART CAN BE<br />
ACCOMMODATED WITHOUT ENCOUNTERING RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS.<br />
THIS IS BECAUSE WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT TOO RAPID A PACE OF<br />
EXPANSION WOULD RISK RE-IGNITING COST AND PRICE INFLATIONEVEN<br />
WITH THE RESTRAINING INFLUENCE OF THE ACCORD AND PUT<br />
FURTHER RECOVERY AT RISK.<br />
EXPANSION IN ADVANCE OF THE GROWTH OF THE CAPACITY OF THE<br />
ECONOMY TO SHIFT RESOURCES TO THE TRADEABLE GOODS SECTOR<br />
WOULD ALSO PUT AT RISK THE IMPROVEMENT IN THE CURRENT<br />
ACCOUNT WHICH ITSELF WOULD ALSO PLACE SUSTAINED RECOVERY<br />
AT RISK.<br />
OF COURSE NO ONE IN GOVERNMENT EXPECTED THE BENEFITS OF<br />
DEPRECIATION TO FLOW IMMEDIATELY AS WAS CLEAR FROM THE<br />
1985/ 86 BUDGET PAPERS. NOR WAS IT EXPECTED THAT THERE WOULD<br />
BE AN INSTANT SLOWING OF CREDIT AND DOMESTIC DEMAND WHEN<br />
POLICY INITIATIVES WERE TAKEN FOLLOWING THE DEPRECIATION<br />
EARLIER THIS YEAR.<br />
INDEED BOTH THE TREASURER AND I HAVE STATED CLEARLY THAT IT<br />
WOULD BE THE FIRST HALF OF 1986 BEFORE ANY SUBSTANTIAL<br />
IMPACT WAS LIKELY TO BE FELT IN EITHER CASE.<br />
BUT NEITHER CAN IT BE DENIED THAT THE SUBSTANTIAL<br />
IMPROVEMENT IN OUR COMPETITIVENESS WHICH HAS OCCURREDWHICH<br />
AMOUNTS TO AROUND 20 PER CENT OVER THE PAST YEARWILL<br />
IN TIME RAISE THE MARKET SHARE OF DOMESTIC PRODUCERS<br />
BOTH AT HOME AND IN WORLD TRADE AND THUS REDUCE THE CURRENT<br />
ACCOUNT DEFICIT AS A PROPORTION OF GDP.<br />
NOR DO I MAKE ANY BONES ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE HIGH LEVELS<br />
OF REAL INTEREST RATES WHICH HAVE PERSISTED SINCE EARLY IN<br />
1985 ARE INTENDED EVENTUALLY BEGIN TO SLOW THE GROWTH OF<br />
CREDIT AND TO ENSURE THAT DEMAND GROWTH IN 1985-86 IS<br />
BROUGHT DOWN TO THE BUDGET ESTIM4ATE OF 3 PER CENT.<br />
SOME OF THE RECENT COMMENTARY ON THESE MATTERS HAS BEEN MORE<br />
VOLATILE THAN THE EXCHANGE RATE. AT THE TIME OF THE LAST<br />
BUDGET SOME WERE SCEPTICAL THAT THE GOVERNMENT'S GROWTH </p>
<p>FORECASTS COULD BE ACHIEVED. MORE RECENTLY THERE WAS A<br />
CONCERN THAT THE ECONOMY WOULD EXCEED THOSE FORECASTS AND<br />
THAT THE EXPECTED IMPROVEMENT IN THE CURRENT ACCOUNT WOULD<br />
BE DELAYED AS A CONSEQUENCE. NOW THERE ARE SOME SUGGESTING<br />
THAT MONETARY POLICY IS TOO TIGHT AND THAT A SHARP<br />
CONTRACTION IS IN EARLY PROSPECT: SOME OF THIS PERSUASION<br />
QUOTE THE APPARENT WEAKNESS OF INVESTMENT IN THE SEPTEMBER<br />
QUARTER NATIONAL ACCOUNTS AS EVIDENCE IN THEIR CASE.<br />
THE GOVERNMENT'S POSITION ON ALL OF THESE PROPOSITIONS IS<br />
CLEAR. THE OUTCOME IN THE SEPTEMBER QUARTER NATIONAL<br />
ACCOUNTS IS QUITE CONSISTENT WITH OUR GROWTH FORECASTS<br />
WHICH PRESENTLY SHOW NON-FARM PRODUCT GROWTH IN 1985-86 AT A<br />
LITTLE LESS THAN 5 PER CENT.<br />
THAT FORECAST, IN TURN, IMPLIES A STEADY SLOWING OF DOMESTIC<br />
DEMAND THROUGH THE COURSE OF 1985-86 AND A CORRESPONDING<br />
RISE IN THE CONTRIBUTION TO GROWTH OF NET EXPORTS THE<br />
COUNTERPART OF THE EXPECTED IMPROVEMENT IN THE CURRENT<br />
ACCOUNT. THOSE WHO ARGUE FOR PESSIMISTIC INVESTMENT FORECASTS ON THE<br />
BASIS OF THE OUTCOME IN THE SEPTEMBER QUARTER WOULD DO WELL<br />
TO HEED THE STATISTICIAN'S WARNING ABOUT THE DANGERS OF<br />
RELYING EXCESSIVELY ON MOVEMENTS OVER A SINGLE QUARTER.<br />
BUSINESS INVESTMENT DECLINED SLIGHTLY IN THE QUARTER ( AFTER<br />
ADJUSTING FOR EXTRANEOUS INFLUENCES) BUT THIS FOLLOWED<br />
GROWTH OF 10 PER CENT IN THE JUNE QUARTER. IN FACT, THE<br />
TIMING OF INVESTMENT DECISIONS IN THE PERIOD IS MORE LIKELY<br />
TO REFLECT CHANGES IN THE ARRANGEMENTS RELATING TO THE<br />
INVESTMENT ALLOWANCE THAN MORE FUNDAMENTAL FACTORS. OVER<br />
THE SIX MONTHS TO THE SEPTEMBER QUARTER, BUSINESS INVESTMENT<br />
GREW AT AN ANNUAL RATE OF 14 PER CENT.<br />
SLOW GROWTH IN THE CURRENT HALF-YEAR IS CONSISTENT WITH THE<br />
LATEST ABS INVESTMENT INTENTIONS SURVEY WHICH NONETHELESS<br />
INDICATES A SUBSTANTIAL PICK-UP IN REAL INVESTMENT OVER THE<br />
COURSE OF THE YEAR. I WOULD ADD THAT THE SAME SURVEY ALSO<br />
INDICATES THAT INTENDED INVESTMENT IN MANUFACTURING IN<br />
1985-86 IS 25 PER CENT HIGHER THAN THE CORRESPONDING<br />
ESTIMATE A YEAR AGO. AMONGST OTHER THINGS, THIS IS<br />
CERTAINLY A POSITIVE SIGN THAT THE ECONOMY IS GEARING UP TO<br />
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE DEPRECIATION.<br />
MORE GENERALLY, THE ACCOUNTS DEMONSTRATE CLEARLY THE STRONG<br />
GROWTH IN PRIVATE DOMESTIC DEMAND AND OUTPUT WHICH IS<br />
CONTINUING, IN ADVANCE OF THE IMPACT OF SOME EARLIER<br />
TIGHTENING OF MONETARY AND FISCAL POLICIES. PRIVATE FINAL<br />
DEMAND ROSE AT THE SOLID ANNUAL RATE OF 4.4 PER CENT IN THE<br />
SIX MONTHS TO SEPTEMBER, AND OUTPUT AT 7.4 PER CENT. WITH<br />
THE STIMULUS FROM DEPRECIATION IN THE PIPELINE, THESE<br />
STATISTICS SHOW CLEARLY WHY THE GOVERNMENT HAS SET MONETARY<br />
AND FISCAL POLICY ON THEIR PRESENT MORE RESTRICTIVE COURSES.<br />
AS IS WELL KNOWN MONETARY POLICY WAS FIRMED EARLIER THIS<br />
MONTH, AT A TIME WHEN IT WAS NECESSARY TO PROVIDE A<br />
BREATHING SPACE WHILE FOREIGN EXCHANGE M4ARKETS WERE </p>
<p>UNSETTLED.. BUT IMPORTANT AS THE EXCHANGE RATE IS, MONETARY<br />
POLICY IS NOT SET SOLELY WITH AN EYE TO THAT PRICE.<br />
AS THE TREASURER AND THE GOVERNOR OF THE RESERVE BANK HAVE<br />
SET OUT ON A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS, THE CONDUCT OF MONETARY<br />
POLICY HAS BEEN GUIDED BY REFERENCE TO THE COMPLETE RANGE OF<br />
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS INCLUDING ACTUAL AND PROSPECTIVE<br />
INFLATION, GROWTH, EMPLOYMENT, INTEREST RATES AND VARIOUS<br />
MONETARY AGGREGATES.<br />
IT IS OUR ASSESSMENT OF THE OVERALL PERFORMANCE OF THE<br />
ECONOMY THAT HAS LED TO THE FIRM MONETARY POLICIES<br />
THROUGHOUT 1985 AND THAT STANCE WILL CONTINUE SO LONG AS<br />
IT IS JUDGED TO BE APPROPRIATE.<br />
FISCAL POLICY ALSO HAS BEEN ASSIGNED A MAJOR ROLE. BECAUSE<br />
OF THE DEPRESSED STATE OF THE ECONOMY AT THE TIME IT ASSUMED<br />
OFFICE, THE GOVERNMENT INITIALLY PURSUED MEASURED<br />
STIMULATORY POLICIES, WHICH HAVE BEEN PROGRESSIVELY WOUND<br />
BACK AS PRIVATE SECTOR RECOVERY HAS GATHERED MOMENTUM.<br />
AT 2.1 PER CENT OF GDP, THE COMMONWEALTH DEFICIT IS BUDGETED<br />
IN 1985-86 TO BE LESS THAN HALF THE PROSPECTIVE OUTCOME OF<br />
PER CENT WHICH WE INHERITED FROM OUR PREDECESSORS. AND,<br />
REFLECTING AGREEMENTS REACHED WITH THE STATES, THERE HAS<br />
BEEN A SIMILAR DECLINE ( OF 2.7 PERCENTAGE POINTS) IN THE<br />
AGGREGATE PUBLIC SECTOR BORROWING REQUIREMENT.<br />
I WOULD ADD THAT THIS HAS BEEN ACHIEVED EVEN WHILE<br />
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE IN ASPECTS OF THE<br />
SOCIAL WAGE IMPROVEMENTS WHICH HAVE FORMED AN IMPORTANT<br />
ELEMENT IN OUR AGREEMENT WITH THE UNIONS TO ACHIEVE A<br />
SUBSTANTIAL CUT IN REAL LABOUR COSTS BORNE BY EMPLOYERS.<br />
FISCAL POLICY WILL CONTINUE TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE PROCESS OF<br />
ECONOMIC ADJUSTMENT REQUIRED TO SUSTAIN GROWTH. THIS IS<br />
CLEAR FROM OUR WILLINGNESS TO ACCEPT UNPRECEDENTED FISCAL<br />
RESTRAINTS IN THE FORM OF THE TRILOGY, COUPLED WITH OUR<br />
COMMITMENT TO FINANCE THE TAX CUTS AGREED TO IN THE CONTEXT<br />
OF THE NEW ACCORD, NOT FROM ADDITIONAL BORROWINGS, BUT FROM<br />
ADDITIONAL EXPENDITURE RESTRAINT.<br />
AS I INDICATED EARLIER, THE ACCORD JUST AS IN THE FIRST<br />
PHASE OF AUSTRALIA'S ECONOMIC RECOVERY REMAINS AN<br />
ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF OUR POST-DEPRECIATION ADJUSTMENT<br />
STRATEGY. THE CENTRALISED SYSTEM OF WAGES FIXATION PROVIDES THE ONLY<br />
FRAMEWORK WITHIN WHICH IT WOULD HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE TO<br />
IMPLEMENT THE WAGES ELEMENTS OF THE ACCORD. THAT SYSTEM<br />
AND THE AGREEMENTS REACHED UNDER THE ACCORD HAVE DELIVERED<br />
A DEGREE OF DOWNWARD FLEXIBILITY IN OVERALL REAL LABOUR<br />
COSTS THAT IS UNPARALLELED IN RECENT AUSTRALIAN EXPERIENCE.<br />
WHO WOULD HAVE PREDICTED, THREE YEARS AGO, THAT DESPITE OVER<br />
TWO YEARS OF STRONG ECONOMIC UPTURN AND WITH PROSPECTS OF<br />
CONTINUED STRONG GROWTH THAT THE RISE IN AVERAGE WEEKLY<br />
EARNINGS OVER THE YEAR TO THE SEPTEMBER QUARTER, AT 4.1 PER </p>
<p>CENT, WOULD BE THE LOWEST ( EXCEPT ONLY FOR THE PREVIOUS<br />
QUARTER) SINCE 1966?.<br />
IN FACT, AS I BEGAN TO SAY EARLIER, WAGES MODERATION OVER<br />
THE PERIOD OF THE ACCORD HAS BEEN SUFFICIENTLY MARKED TO<br />
PERMIT A SUBSTANTIAL DECLINE IN REAL UNIT LABOUR COSTS IN<br />
EACH OF THE LAST TWO YEARS. THAT INDEX OF COSTS IS NOW<br />
BELOW THE AVERAGE LEVEL-OF THE LATE 19601S AND EARLY 1970' S.<br />
AND THE PROSPECT IS UNDER THE ACCORD THAT IT SHOULD BE<br />
NO HIGHER IN TWO YEARS TIME.<br />
I AM AWARE THAT THE RECENT DECISION BY THE ARBITRATION<br />
COMMISSION NOT TO COMMENCE DISCOUNTING FROM THE RECENT<br />
NATIONAL WAGE INCREASE HAS CAUSED DISAPPOINTMENT AMONGST<br />
SOME OF YOUR MEMBERS. LET ME REMIND YOU, HOWEVER, THAT THE<br />
FULL BENCH OF THE COMMISSION CONCLUDED FROM THE EVIDENCE<br />
BEFORE IT THAT THE ECONOMIC EFFECTS OF SPREADING A DISCOUNT<br />
OF 2 PER CENT BETWEEN THE NOVEMBER AND APRIL WAGE CASES<br />
WOULD BE MINIMAL AND TRANSITORY.<br />
THE GOVERNMENT'S DETAILED ANALYSIS SUPPORTS THIS CONCLUSION<br />
AND WE ARE OF THE VIEW THAT MOVEMENTS IN THE CPI WOULD BE<br />
VIRTUALLY THE SAME FROM THE MIDDLE OF 1986 UNDER. EITHER<br />
APPROACH. ON PRESENT ESTIMATES A DISCOUNT OF 2 PER CENT WOULD ALMOST<br />
PRECISELY OFFSET THE DIRECT EFFECT OF DEPRECIATION ON THE<br />
CPI RELEVANT TO THE DETERMINATION OF THE NEXT NATIONAL WAGE<br />
CASE.<br />
AS YOU KNOW OTHER OFFSETS HAVE BEEN AGREED BETWEEN THE<br />
GOVERNMENT AND THE ACTU. UNIONS HAVE AGREED TO MODERATE<br />
THEIR PRODUCTIVITY CLAIM TO A WAGE-EQUIVALENT OF 3 PER CENT,<br />
TO BE PAID IN THE FORM OF NEW OR IMPROVED OCCUPATIONAL<br />
SUPERANNUATION. THE PAYMENT OF THIS CLAIM AS<br />
SUPERANNUATION WILL FURTHER REDUCE THE EFFECT ON TOTAL<br />
LABOUR COSTS TO ABOUT 2 1/ 2 PER CENT, BECAUSE SUPERANNUATION<br />
PAYMENTS DO NOT TYPICALLY BEAR THE SAME IMPLICATIONS FOR<br />
ON-COSTS AS DO TRADITIONAL WAGES INCREASES. THIS COST'<br />
IMPACT IS TO BE SPREAD OVER A TWO-YEAR PERIOD AND THERE IS<br />
TO BE NO FURTHER CLAIM BASED ON PRODUCTIVITY UNTIL 1988.<br />
THE GOVERNMENT IS CONCERNED TO ENSURE THAT ALL ASPECTS OF<br />
THE AGREEMENT IN RESPECT OF THE PRODUCTIVITY CASE ARE<br />
HONOURED BY ALL CONCERNED.<br />
THESE INCLUDE THE REQUIREMENT THAT, EVEN THOUGH NEGOTIATIONS<br />
TOWARDS ESTABLISHING NEW SUPERANNUATION ARRANGEMENTS MAY<br />
PROCEED, THE COST IMPACT SHOULD NOT BE FELT BEFORE JULY 1,<br />
1986. THERE CAN BE ONLY VERY ISOLATED EXCEPTIONS TO THAT<br />
RULE. IN PARTICULAR NO PROPOSAL WILL BE ENTERTAINED BY THE<br />
GOVERNMENT WHICH SIGNIFICANTLY ADDS TO TOTAL COSTS BEFORE 1<br />
JULY AND THE GOVERNMENT IS CLOSELY MONITORING DEVELOPMENTS<br />
IN THIS AREA.<br />
I WOULD ADD THAT THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT SUPPORT INDUSTRIAL<br />
ACTION IN SUPPORT OF SUPERANNUATION CLAIMS. IN OUR VIEW<br />
SUCH ACTION IS INCONSISTENT WITH THE SPIRIT OF THE AGREEMENT </p>
<p>BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ACTU.<br />
THE GOVERNMENT WILL SHORTLY BE CIRCULATING FOR COMMENT<br />
INCLUDING TO THE CAI A SET OF DRAFT GUIDELINES TO GOVERN<br />
SUPERANNUATION SCHEMES. WE WILL WELCOME YOUR COMMENTS ON<br />
THE DRAFT.<br />
THE GUIDELINES WILL BE DRAWN UP TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT,<br />
CONSISTENT WITH THE NEEDS OF OUR RETIREMENT INCOMES POLICY,<br />
ONLY ARRANGEMENTS TO PROVIDE GENUINE SUPERANNUATION BENEFITS<br />
WILL BE ACCEPTABLE TO THE GOVERNMENT. SCHEMES WHICH DO NOT<br />
COMPLY WILL BE DENIED THE TAXATION CONCESSIONS OTHERWISE<br />
AVAILABLE TO ENCOURAGE THIS FORM OF SAVING.<br />
THE APPROACH WHICH WE HAVE TAKEN IN REACHING THIS AGREEMENT<br />
WITH THE ACTU TO MAKE A JOINT APPROACH TO THE CONCILIATION<br />
AND ARBITRATION COMMISSION ON THOSE MATTERS IS SIMILAR IN<br />
KIND TO OUR EARLIER AGREEMENTS IN RESPECT OF THE MEDICARE<br />
ADJUSTMENT TO THE CPI, THE FOREGOING OF CATCH-UP CLAIMS<br />
AFTER THE 1983 WAGES FREEZE, AND THE AGREEMENTS NOT TO SEEK<br />
WAGES INCREASES INCONSISTENT WITH THE PRINCIPLES LAID DOWN<br />
BY THE COMMISSION.<br />
THE AGREEMENT IN RESPECT OF PRODUCTIVITY RECOGNISES THE<br />
ENTITLEMENT OF UNIONS, UNDER THE PRINCIPLES, TO MOUNT SUCH A<br />
CLAIM TO SHARE IN THE GROWTH OF NATIONAL INCOME BUT SEEKS<br />
ALSO TO ARGUE FOR AN OUTCOME WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH THE<br />
NEEDS OF THE ECONOMY OVERALL.<br />
IN THIS CASE THE SIZE AND TIMING OF THE CLAIM, AND THE<br />
PROPOSAL THAT THE CLAIM BE PAID OVER TWO YEARS, ARE ALL<br />
SIMULTANEOUSLY DESIGNED TO CONTAIN INFLATIONARY PRESSURES,<br />
MAINTAIN OVER TIME THE IMPROVEMENT IN REAL UNIT LABOUR COSTS<br />
AND CONTRIBUTE TO PRESERVING THE IMPROVEMENT WHICH HAS<br />
OCCURRED IN OUR INTERNATIONAL COMPETITIVENESS. OF COURSE IT<br />
WILL BE FOR THE COMMISSION TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE AGREED<br />
APPROACH IS ACCEPTABLE, ON THE EVIDENCE TO BE PRESENTED TO<br />
IT.<br />
WHILE IT IS A FIRM PRINCIPLE THAT THE COST OF ANY<br />
PRODUCTIVITY AWARD SHOULD NOT EXCEED 3 PER CENT, IT IS<br />
ENVISAGED THAT EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES WILL HAVE SOME<br />
FLEXIBILITY WITHIN THE GENERAL GUIDELINES ABOUT ASPECTS<br />
OF ANY PRODUCTIVITY AWARD MADE IN TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT. I<br />
NOTE THAT THERE IS ALSO SOME LIMITED FLEXIBILITY. UNDER THE<br />
OPERATION OF THE CURRENT WAGES FIXING PRINCIPLES, TO<br />
ACKNOWLEDGE DEMONSTRABLE CASES OF INCAPACITY TO PAY NATIONAL<br />
WAGE INCREASES.<br />
HOWEVER, THE HALLMARK OF OUR APPROACH HAS BEEN TO SEEK<br />
OUTCOMES WHICH, WHILE PRESERVING EQUITY, DELIVER THE MAXIMUM<br />
FEASIBLE RESTRAINT IN AVERAGE OUTCOMES FOR LABOUR COSTS.<br />
AND, AS THE EVIDENCE WHICH I HAVE PRESENTED CLEARLY SHOWS,<br />
OUR APPROACH HAS BEEN HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL.<br />
IT IS UNDERSTOOD THAT THIS MAY, AT TIMES, BE AT THE COST OF<br />
A DEGREE OF FLEXIBILITY IN RELATIVE WAGES WHICH, IN OTHER<br />
CIRCUMSTANCES, COULD HAVE BEEN DESIRABLE. THIS REFLECTS THE </p>
<p>JUDGEMENT THAT, IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE STRONGLY GROWING<br />
AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY. WHICH OUR POLICIES HAVE PRODUCED AND<br />
AGAINST THE BACKGROUND OF AUSTRALIA'S INDUSTRIAL HISTORY<br />
AND, IN MANY WAYS, UNIQUE INSTITUTIONS THE PURSUIT OF<br />
APPROPRIATE OUTCOMES FOR LABOUR COSTS OVERALL SHOULD NOT BE<br />
JEOPARDIS ED.<br />
THERE IS A STRONG TEMPTATION FOR ME TO ENGAGE IN SOME<br />
POLITICAL POINT SCORING ON THIS MATTER BUT IN THE INTERESTS<br />
OF PROMOTING A MORE INFORMED DISCUSSION, I WILL CONFINE<br />
MYSELF TONIGHT TO ADDRESSING THE SUBSTANTIVE ISSUES IN THIS<br />
DEBATE.<br />
THE FIRST ISSUE IS TH. E FREQUENT ASSERTION THAT A LESS<br />
CENTRALISED APPROACH TO WAGES DETERMINATION WOULD IMPROVE<br />
JOB PROSPECTS.<br />
THE INTERNATIONAL EVIDENCE FOR THIS PROPOSITION IS AT BEST<br />
AMBIGUOUS. IN ITS EMPLOYMENT OUTLOOK, THE OECD INDICATED RESERVATIONS<br />
ABOUT THE SUPPOSED ADVANTAGES OF SECTORAL WAGE FLEXIBILITY.<br />
IT NOTED THAT DESPITE INCREASED DISPERSION IN MANUFACTURING<br />
EARNINGS IN THE UNITED STATES AND A NARROWING IN CANADA,<br />
WHICH IT HELD TO BE INDICATIVE OF GREATER FLEXIBILITY IN THE<br />
UNITED STATES, EMPLOYMENT IN MANUFACTURING HAS INCREASED<br />
MUCH MORE IN CANADA THAN IN THE US SINCE 1970.<br />
THE OECD ALSO WARNED THAT IT IS IMPORTANT NOT TO SEEK TO<br />
PURCHASE RELATIVE WAGE FLEXIBILITY AT THE EXPENSE OF AN<br />
UNDESIRABLE OUTCOME FOR THE AVERAGE WAGE LEVEL.<br />
OTHER STUDIES HAVE NOTED SIMILAR RESULTS. FOR EXAMPLE BELL<br />
AND FREEMAN'S EMPIRICAL EXAMINATION OF US EXPERIENCE LEADS<br />
THEM TO CONCLUDE:<br />
" THE BOTTOM LINE OF THE US EXPERIENCE IS THAT FLEXIBLE<br />
WAGES BY INDUSTRY HAVE NOT CONTRIBUTED TO EMPLOYMENT<br />
GROWTH".<br />
THEY FOUND THAT PRODUCTIVITY GAINS IN EXPANDING INDUSTRIES<br />
WERE TRANSLATED MAINLY INTO WAGE INCREASES RATHER THAN INTO<br />
MORE JOBS. NO DOUBT THIS REFLECTS THE USE OF INDUSTRIAL<br />
MUSCLE BY UNIONS IN EXPANDING INDUSTRIES.<br />
COMPELLING EVIDENCE OF THE DANGERS OF A LESS CENTRALISED<br />
APPROACH IN AUSTRALIAN CONDITIONS IS TO BE FOUND, HOWEVER,<br />
IN OUR EXPERIENCE IN 1981-82.<br />
LET ME RECALL FOR YOU THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE TIME.<br />
NON-FARM GROWTH IN THE YEAR BEFORE HAD JUST TOPPED 4 PER<br />
CENT, FOR ONLY THE SECOND TIME IN 6 YEARS. THE UNEMPLOYMENT<br />
RATE HAD EDGED DOWN TO 5.4 PER CENT IN JUNE 1981 AND ROSE<br />
PROGRESSIVELY THROUGH THE NEXT FINANCIAL YEAR. THE<br />
CORPORATE PROFIT SHARE IN 1980-81, STOOD AT JUST OVER 14 PER<br />
CENT AND LABOUR AND EMPLOYERS ALIKE SHARED HEIGHTENED<br />
EXPECTATIONS OF FUTURE GROWTH GENERATED BY THE RHETORIC OF<br />
THE SO-CALLED RESOURCES BOOM. </p>
<p>IT IS NOW A MATTER OF RECORD THAT, IN THE CONTEXT OF THE<br />
ABANDONMENT OF THE. CENTRALISED SYSTEM IN JULY 1981, WAGES<br />
GROWTH RAPIDLY ACCELERATED, REACHING A PEAK YEAR-TO RATE OF<br />
17 PER CENT.<br />
OF COURSE IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO PREDICT WITH ANY PRECISION<br />
WHAT ADDITION TO LABOUR COSTS WOULD OCCUR IF THE CENTRALISED<br />
SYSTEM WERE TO BE ABANDONED NOW. BUT WITH GROWTH STRONGER,<br />
THE PROFITS SHARE HIGHER ( AT 16 PER CENT IN THE LATEST<br />
QUARTER) AND THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE KNOWN TO BE DECLINING, IT<br />
REQUIRES A SOMEWHAT PERVERSE LOGIC TO CONTEND THAT THERE<br />
WOULD NOT BE SUCCESSFUL CLAIMS AND FAIRLY WIDESPREAD AT<br />
THAT IN EXCESS OF THOSE PERMITTED UNDER THE ACCORD.<br />
OF COURSE THE ESSENCE OF A DECENTRALISED APPROACH IS THE<br />
NEED FOR INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYERS TO BE CONVINCED OF THE MERITS<br />
OF THE CLAIM BEFORE THEM. IN AUSTRALIAN CONDITIONS THIS<br />
WOULD INEVITABLY GENERATE A SHARP RISE IN INDUSTRIAL<br />
DISPUTES, AND WITH IT THE PROSPECT OF SUCCESSIVE ROUNDS OF<br />
WAGES BARGAINING BASED ON COMPARATIVE WAGES JUSTICE.<br />
THESE MECHANISMS ARE COSTLY TO EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES<br />
ALIKE. ALONG WITH THE OBVIOUS COSTS OF LOST PRODUCTION,<br />
THEY REQUIRE THE DIVERSION OF EXCESSIVE MANAGEMENT RESOURCES<br />
TO DISPUTE SOLVING, AND ADD AN ELEMENT OF UNCERTAINTY TO ALL<br />
FORWARD PLANNING, AND TO ALL COSTINGS, INCLUDING WHEN<br />
TENDERING FOR EXPORT CONTRACTS.<br />
OUR CENTRALISED APPROACH SHARPLY REDUCES BOTH THE<br />
UNCERTAINTY ELEMENT AND THE RESOURCES REQUIRED FOR THESE<br />
PURPOSES. IT BEARS REMEMBERING THAT INDUSTRIAL DISPUTES ARE<br />
NOW A FRACTION OF THE LEVELS OF EARLIER TIMES. MOREOVER,<br />
THOUGH WE HAVE PROBABLY BECOME SO ACCLIMATISED THAT WE HAVE<br />
FORGOTTEN WHAT IT USED TO BE LIKE, IT IS ALSO TRUE THAT FOR<br />
MOST FIRMS THE EARLIER NEAR CERTAINTY OF FREQUENT AND<br />
PROLONGED INDUSTRIAL DISLOCATION HAS NOW BEEN REMOVED FROM<br />
THE PLANNING HORIZON. NONE OF THIS WOULD BE GUARANTEED IN<br />
THE ABSENCE OF THE ACCORD AND THE CENTRALISED SYSTEM OF<br />
WAGES FIXATION.<br />
IN RECENT TIMES THERE HAS BEEN SOME DISCUSSION INCLUDING<br />
BY THE OPPOSITION OF THE POSSIBILITY OF CREATING SOME<br />
HALF-WAY HOUSE BETWEEN THE PRESENT SYSTEM AND A COMPLETELY<br />
DEREGULATED LABOUR MARKET.<br />
THE PROPOSALS WITH MOST CURRENCY RELY ON SOME MECHANISMS TO<br />
PERMIT ( OR, IN SOME INSTANCES, ENCOURAGE) " OPTING-OUT" OF<br />
THE CENTRALISED SYSTEM. IN ONE CASE IT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED<br />
THAT ALL PENAL PROVISIONS UNDER INDUSTRIAL LEGISLATION BE<br />
WITHDRAWN. IN THE GOVERNMENT'S VIEW A SYSTEM WHICH RELIES STRONGLY ON<br />
COMMON LAW TO ENFORCE AGREEMENTS WOULD RAPIDLY BECOME<br />
UNWORKABLE. KNOWING THAT RECOURSE TO LAW WOULD BE A<br />
LENGTHY, EXPENSIVE AND CUMBERSOME PROCESS, IT IS HARD TO SEE<br />
HOW POWERFUL PARTIES ON EITHER SIDE WOULD NOT SEEK TO<br />
EXPLOIT THE INFLEXIBILITY OF THE SYSTEM, TO THE DETRIMENT OF<br />
THE ECONOMY AS A WHOLE AND THE OTHER PARTY TO THE AGREEMENT. </p>
<p>THE DIFFICULTY WITH OPTING OUT PROPOSALS MORE GENERALLY IS<br />
THAT, WITHOUT THE UMPIJRE, IT IS HARD TO SEE HOW OUTCOMES FOR<br />
AVERAGE WAGES COULD BE ACHIEVED WHICH THE PARTIES MIGHT EACH<br />
AGREE TO BE IN THE NATIONAL INTEREST, BUT WHICH INDIVIDUAL<br />
BARGAINERS CANNOT ABIDE BY IF WAGES GENERALLY ARE SPIRALLING<br />
UPWARDS UNDER THE DICTUM OF COMPARATIVE WAGE JUSTICE.<br />
CLEARLY THE STRONGEST INCENTIVES TO OPT OUT WOULD BE FOR<br />
THOSE UNIONS WITH THE MOST INDUSTRIAL MUSCLE OR IN<br />
PROFITABLE, PACE SETTING INDUSTRIES PARTICULARLY THOSE<br />
INDUSTRIES WHICH ARE MORE SHELTERED FROM INTERNATIONAL<br />
COMPETITION. DEALS CONCLUDED IN THESE SEGMENTS OF THE<br />
ECONOMY AND TRANSMITTED TO THOSE ENGAGED IN TRADE CAN ONLY<br />
BE TO THE DETRIMENT OF OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE.<br />
I CAN ONLY HEARTILY ENDORSE THE CAI'S ASSESSMENT IN ITS<br />
SUBMISSION TO THE HANCOCK INQUIRY THAT AUSTRALIAN EMPLOYERS<br />
DO NOT WISH TO TAKE THE " LEAP IN THE DARK" REQUIRED TO<br />
ESTABLISH A RADICAL DEPARTURE FROM CONCILIATION AND<br />
ARBITRATION.<br />
AGAINST THE BACKDROP OF OUR OTHER POLICY SETTINGS, THE<br />
ACCORD AND THE CENTRALISED WAGES FIXING SYSTEM ON WHICH IT<br />
IS BASED, HAS WORKED TO QUOTE THE OECD SECRETARY-GENERAL<br />
" BRILLIANTLY" TO GET AUSTRALIA'S ECONOMIC FUNDAMENTALS<br />
RIGHT. WE HAVE MECHANISMS IN PLACE TO PRESERVE TO THE<br />
MAXIMUM FEASIBLE EXTENT OUR COST COMPETITIVENESS IN THE WAKE<br />
OF THE DEPRECIATION. WE HAVE IN PLACE MECHANISMS WHICH WILL<br />
ENABLE THE NECESSARY TRANSFER OF RESOURCES TO OUR TRADEABLE<br />
GOODS INDUSTRIES TO BE ACCOMPLISHED AT LEAST COST TO THE<br />
LONGEVITY OF THE RECOVERY WHILE, ALL THE TIME, PRESERVING<br />
FORWARD MOMENTUM IN GROWTH AND JOBS.<br />
LET THERE BE NO DOUBT OF THIS GOVERNMENT'S DETERMINATION TO<br />
CONTINUE TO MANAGE THE AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY TO ENABLE ALL<br />
AUSTRALIANS TO PROSPER AND REALISE THEIR ASPIRATIONS IN THE<br />
1980' S, THE 1990' S AND BEYOND. </p>
