TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE MON P J KEATING, NP<br />
DOORSTOP, DARLING HARBOUR, SYDNEY, 22 JUNE 1992<br />
E OE PROOF COPY<br />
3: Prime Minister, one criticism of this is that's it nlot<br />
backed up by legislation.<br />
PM: X think this Government has obviously, this is not a<br />
claim it is a fact, a second to none environmental<br />
poiyi Australian politics. We're the people who<br />
have made all of the running on the environment in this<br />
country, preserved great areas for Australians the Wet<br />
Tropics in Queensland, the Southern forests and Gordon<br />
below Franklin Antarctica there's a long list of<br />
things which the Government has chalked up successes and<br />
we will in this. That is3we'll get Australians to change<br />
and know that waste is a huge environmental problem and<br />
that they just can't be putting out the garbage can<br />
thinking it disappears. The land fills are not there<br />
any more and that we're going to have to be more careful<br />
about how we dispose of waste and if we do it carefully<br />
we can have a better society, a cleaner place and a more<br />
profitable place and it just requires some care. 9ut it<br />
involves the whole community. Again it gets back to<br />
this inclusive approach, we say let's get the community<br />
involved. Our friends in the Coalition say let the<br />
Government do it and make decrees from the mount. The<br />
truth is with all of these programs you can only do them<br />
with community support and nothing needs that more than<br />
waste management.<br />
Ji Do you have any recycled paper in your office?<br />
PM: I do, yes. Most of the time.<br />
J: Was the speech on recycled paper?<br />
PM: I don't know, have a look.<br />
J: Prime Minister, what's your response to Premiers Kirner<br />
and oannon's call for a slow down in tariff _ eutin<br />
PM: I haven't seen their document. </p>
<p>J: But what do you think about their call for a slow down?<br />
They are not the only ones, they join the ACTU and<br />
business.<br />
PM: Let's see what they have got to ay?<br />
J: Do you think it's the right time to be talking about the<br />
environent when we've got such high unemployment?<br />
PM: I think this is a very labour intensive industry. with<br />
paper recycling, for example a high proportion of the<br />
newsprint of Australia picked up and recycled, that's a<br />
very labour intensive thing to be doing. It is true,<br />
because it is community based it requires a substantial<br />
amount of labour, so it is a very labour intensive thing<br />
and I think what's going to happen is that the whole<br />
waste management and better environment movement is<br />
going to be, if anything, labour intensive and job<br />
creating.<br />
J: Are the unemployed going to be invited to the youth<br />
summit?<br />
PM: There will be representatives there yeu.<br />
J: What's your reaction to Mr Greiner not accepting the<br />
findings of ICAC?-<br />
PM: Mr Greiner and the NSW Liberals have a political rather<br />
than a criminal matter on their hands. Obviously it<br />
will have to be resolved politically.<br />
J: Will it have an impact federally?<br />
PM: Obviously, I don't think it will.<br />
J: what's your reaction to an ANZ Bank studjy which suggests<br />
that interest rates may be forced up if you persist with<br />
the 4 per cent compulsory?<br />
PM: There are studies and studies aren't there. We've all<br />
seen those.<br />
J: Prime Minister, on another matter there were reports<br />
f rom ENO that Australian helicopters over there are<br />
still being used as 9unehips.<br />
PM: That's a claim, we're investigating that claim. People<br />
who operate those helicopters are entitled to carry<br />
weapons to defend themselves, but they are not entitled<br />
to use the weapons in an offensive manner. So we are<br />
making the appropriate investigations.<br />
3: Prime Minister, consumer confidence in the polls this<br />
morning has slumped in that the poll was taken even<br />
before the high unemployment figure last month came out.<br />
What are you going to do about that? </p>
<p>3<br />
PM: These things have been up and down over the course of<br />
the last twelve months so I think there's no doubt in my<br />
mind the economy in terms of output is recovering. The<br />
problem we are seeing is that the output is leading<br />
employment and we're going to see growth and production<br />
pick up, but not commensurate with employment, not for<br />
the moment that always lags production and it's doing<br />
the same thing now.<br />
