Prime Minister Julia Gillard today launched Ravenswood School for Girls' campaign to encourage teenage women to support action on climate change.</p>
<p>The campaign aims to sign up 10,000 teenage girls to reduce one tonne of pollution in a year.  Ravenswood is one of 30 NSW schools who have so far pledged support.</p>
<p>The campaign was created by the climate change action group 1millionwomen, who are joining daughters, mothers, sisters and grandmothers together to take action against global warming.</p>
<p>Speaking at the school, the Prime Minister said the concept of getting young women together to act on climate change is a practical yet powerful example of what can be done now to set our country on a path to a low carbon future.</p>
<p>We all have to work together and we need to start now if we want our children and their children to live in a country with a clean energy economy that drives green innovation and still has natural wonders that are the envy of the rest of the world.</p>
<p>All the young women taking part in 1millionwomen campaign are helping make sure that 2011 is the year that Australia takes action on climate change.</p>
<p>More than 41,000 women of all ages and backgrounds have joined the 1millionwomen campaign over the last two years.</p>
