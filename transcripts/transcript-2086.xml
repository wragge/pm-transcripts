FOR PRESS: R A R(<br />
P. M. No. 57/ 1969<br />
PROPOSED ROAD CONNECTION BETWEEN<br />
CANBERRA AND TUMLJT<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr. Gorton, and the New South<br />
Wales Chief Secretary, Mr. Willis, today announced that the<br />
Commonwealth and New South Wales Governments have agreed<br />
that the future direct road connection between Canberra and Tumut<br />
should follow a route via Wee jasper.<br />
The two Governments are in agreement that although<br />
there will be an ultimate need for a better road connection between<br />
Canberra and Tumut, the present need does not justify its construction<br />
at the expense of many works of greater urgency.<br />
Both Governments have accepted the recommendations<br />
contained in a report prepared jointly by the National Capital<br />
Development Commission and the Department of Main Roads, New<br />
South Wales. These authorities carried out a technical evaluation<br />
of alternative routes between Canberra and Tumut and the benefits<br />
likely to accrue to road users of those routes.<br />
The Commission undertook an assessment of the<br />
economic, land use and development, tourist and recreational aspects<br />
of the proposed routes while the Department prepared an assessment<br />
of the engineering aspects. The findings of these authorities were<br />
contained in a joint detailed report submitted to the Commonwealth<br />
and State Governments. The investigation followed representations by<br />
Parliamentarians, Local Government Authorities and other interested<br />
bodies for an improved and more direct road connection between<br />
Canberra and Tumut. Two possible routes were investigated, one<br />
via Wee jasper and the other via Brindabella.<br />
The Governments have supplied copies of the report<br />
to Commonwealth and State Parliamentary representatives of the area<br />
and to Local Government bodies directly concerned with the proposal<br />
for a direct road link between Canberra and Tumut.<br />
