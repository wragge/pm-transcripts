PREMIERS' CONFERENCE 19 JUNE 1975<br />
OPENING STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON. E. G. WHITLAM, M. P.<br />
THERE HAS BEEN MORE PREPARATION FOR THIS THAN FOR<br />
OTHER MEETINGS OF AUSTRALIAN HEADS OF GOVERNMENT. THE<br />
PREPARATION MUST BE HELPFULJ. OUR OFFICIALS HAVE MET. YOU<br />
HAVE PROVIDED US WITH BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND) WITH A JOINT<br />
STATEMENT OF YOUR PROPOSALS. WE HAVE RESPONDED TO THOSE<br />
PROPOSALS AND HAVE INDICATED MATTERS WHICH WE SEE AS OPEN FOR<br />
DISCUSSION TODAY. THIS MEETING WILL NOT REMOVE ALL THE<br />
MISUNDERSTANDINGS OR THE DISAGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
AND STATE GOVERNMENTS, BUT THE PREPARATION MEANS THAT WE MEET<br />
WITH A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE PROBLEMS BEFORE US. THIS<br />
DEVELOPMENT IS ONE WHICH I HAVE ENCOURAGED AND IN WHICH YOU<br />
HAVE ALL CO-OPERATED, AND I THANK YOU FOR THAT CO-OPERATION.<br />
A CRUCIAL ITEM OF OUR AGENDA IS, OF COURSE, THE<br />
REVIEW OF GENERAL REVENUE ASSISTANCE ARRANGEMENTS. HOWEVER,<br />
BEFORE TURNING TO THAT, I WANT TO REFER BRIEFLY TO CO-OPERATIVE<br />
K~ jANNING AND REGIONALISM WHICH I HAVE PROPOSED FOR LATER<br />
DISCUSSION. I MUST MAKE IT CLEAR THAT THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT<br />
DOES NOT REGARD THE PRESENT APPROACH TO DETERMINING REVENUE<br />
ASSISTANCE ARRANGEMENTS AS SATISFACTORY. STATE EXPENDITURES<br />
ARE LARGELY TAKEN AS GIVEN. THERE IS NO EXPLICIT CONSIDERATION o o / 2 </p>
<p>2,<br />
OF PROPER BALANCE BETWEEN STATE PROGRAMS AM) RELATED AUSTRALIAN<br />
GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS. INSTEAD, AND BY TRADITION, FINANCIAL<br />
FACTORS ARE CONSIDERED LARGELY IN TERMS OF THE YEAR<br />
IMMEDIATELY AHEAD.<br />
CO-OPERATIVE PLANNING<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT WILL BE SEEKING IN THE<br />
LONGER TERN A MORE RATIONAL AND CO-ORDINATED SYSTEM OF ASSESSING<br />
NEEDS, SETTING PRIORITIES AM) ALLOCATING RESOURCES IN THE PUBLIC<br />
SECTOR ONE BASED ON CO-OPERATION BETWEEN GOVERNMENTS. IT MAY<br />
TAKE YEARS TO DEVELOP A NEW APPROACH OF THE KIM) W4E HAVE IN<br />
MIND, OF THE KIM) DISCUSSED AMONG OUR OFFICIALS. BUT WE<br />
BELIEVE A START SHOULD BE MADE NOW.<br />
THE VIEW OF THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT IS THAT IN<br />
SEEKING BETTER CO-OPERATIVE PLANNING ARRANGEMENTS IT WOULD BE<br />
BEST TO BEGIN WITH PARTICULAR IMPORTANT FUNCTIONS WHERE THERE<br />
IS A CLEAR NEED FOR CO-ORDINATION AM) WHERE EARLY PROGRESS SEEMS<br />
POSSIBLE. THREE SUCH FUNCTIONS HAVE BEEN SUGGESTED IN THE<br />
DISCUSSIONS AMONG OUR OFFICERS TRANSPORT, HEALTH AM) URBAN<br />
DEVELOPMENT. LET ME ILLUSTRATE WHAT WE HAVE IN MIN) BY REFERRING<br />
TO URBAN AM) REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT WHERE IMPORTANT FACTORS<br />
DETERMINING DEVELOPMENT ARE PLANNED AM) FUNDED AT DIFFERENT<br />
LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT. THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT IS RESPONSIBLE<br />
FOR THE RETICULATION OF TELECOMMNICATIONS. THE STATE SEMIGOVERNMENTAL<br />
AM) LOCAL AUTHORITIES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE / 3 </p>
<p>3.<br />
RETICULATION OF WATER AND) SEWERAGE. THE NEED FOR OVERALL<br />
CO-ORDINATION IS OBVIOUS.<br />
MORE THAN $ 4,500 MILLION IS CURRENTLY BEING SPENT ON<br />
TRANSPORT EACH YEAR AND THAT IS MORE THAN 12 PER CENT OF<br />
GROSS NATIONAL EXPENDITURE. THE DECISIONS BY EACH LEVEL OF<br />
GOVERNMENT ON THE ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES TO THE MODES OF<br />
TRANSPORT FOR WHICH IT IS RESPONSIBLE SHOULD BE CONSISTENT<br />
S WITH THE DECISIONS BY OTHER LEVELS IF THIS MONEY IS TO BE<br />
WELL SPENT. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR DECISIONS ON THE ALLOCATION OF<br />
RESOURCES TO AIRPORTS AND AIRWAYS FACILITIES SHOULD BE MADE<br />
WITH KNOWLEDGE OF THE STATES? VIEWS ON THEIR PRIORITY RELATIVE<br />
TO OTHER MODES OF TRANSPORT. SIMILARLY WE WOULD EXPECT THE<br />
STATES' DECISIONS ON THE ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES TO PORTS TO<br />
S BE MADE WITH KNOWLEDGE OF OUR VIEWS.<br />
THERE HAVE BEEN IMPORTANT DEVELOPMENTS IN RECENT YEARS.<br />
SINCE 1969 ROADS ASSISTANCE HAS BEEN BASED ON A SURVEY UNDERTAKEN<br />
JOINTLY BY AUSTRALIAN AND STATE AUTHORITIES. THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
GOVERNMENT IS NOW REPRESENTED ON STATE URBAN TRANSPORT PLANNING<br />
BODIES. REGIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEES HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED TO<br />
PARTICIPATE IN THE PLANNING OF MAJOR AIRPORTS.<br />
APART FROM PARTICULAR DEVELOPMENTS, THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
TRANSPORT ADVISORY COUNCIL HAS BECOME THE MAJOR FORUM ON THE 4 </p>
<p>PROBLEMS OF PUBLIC TRANSPORT SERVICES, MAIN RAILWAY LINES AND)<br />
ROADS. THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT HAS RECENTLY TAKEN THE<br />
INITIATIVE IN INTRODUCING AVIATION MATTERS INTO ATAC, AND IN<br />
SEEKING CONSIDERATION THERE OF THE QUESTION OF RESOURCE<br />
ALLOCATION TO TRANSPORT GENERALLY. IT IS THIS LATTER<br />
DEVELOPMENT WHICH WE BELIEVE SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED AND<br />
ACCELERATED. I UNDERSTAND THAT ATAC WILL BE REVIEWING ITS<br />
MACHINERY AT ITS MEETING NEXT MONTH. I SUGGEST WE SHOULD ASK<br />
BOTH ATAC AND THE PORTS AND MARINE COUNCIL TO REPORT BACK TO<br />
US ON HOW BEST TO PROCEED WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF WIDER<br />
CO-OPERATIVE PLANNING ARRANGEMENTS OF THE KIND DESCRIBED.<br />
A SUJMMARY OF POINTS OF POSSIBLE AGREEMENT ON<br />
CO-OPERATIVE PLANNING HAS BEEN CIRCULATED TO YOU. I ASK YOU<br />
TO NOTE TEAT THEY ARE SIMPLY INTENDED TO FORM A FRAME OF<br />
REFERENCE AGAINST WHICH OFFICIALS AND MINISTERS CAN PROCEED<br />
WITH FURTHER EXAMINATION IN THE MONTHS AHEAD SO THAT MORE<br />
CONSIDERED REPORTS CAN BE PUT BEFORE US AT A FUTURE TIME.<br />
THERE IS NO COMMITMENT INVOLVED IN AGREEING TO THIS<br />
SET OF POINTS, OTHER THAN THAT FURTHER STUDY BE UNDERTAKEN<br />
CO-OPERATIVELY BETWEEN OUR OFFICIALS. ON THAT BASIS I WILL BE<br />
ASKING THAT PREMIERS INDICATE THEIR AGREEMENT WHEN WE CONE TO<br />
DISCUSSION OF THAT ITEM. </p>
<p>REGIONAL POLICY THE AUSTRALIAN GOV'ERNMENT HAS LAID CONSIDERABLE STRESS<br />
ON THE ADOPTION OF A REGIONAL APPROACH TO PLANNING AND DECISIONMAKING.<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN ASSISTANCE PLAN AND THE AREA IMPROVEMENT<br />
PROGRAM ARE EXAMPLES OF PROGRAMS DELIVERED ON A REGIONAL BASIS.<br />
A STATEMENT OF THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT'S REGIONAL POLICY WAS<br />
MADE BY ME ON 18 JUNE.<br />
IN BRIEF, THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT HAS ADOPTED, AS A<br />
BASIS FOR ITS REGIONAL POLICY, THESE OBJECTIVES:<br />
SERVICES AND PROGRAMS OF THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT<br />
SHOULD BE PROVIDED ON A REGIONAL BASIS UYNLESS IT IS<br />
INAPPROPRIATE TO DO SO, WITH REGARD TO EFFICIENCY,<br />
ECONOMY AND EFFECTIVENESS.<br />
REGIONAL BODIES OR ORGANISATIONS SHOULD BE GIVEN A<br />
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THOSE SERVICES WHEREVER POSSIBLE,<br />
NOTING THAT THIS RESPONSIBILITY MAY RANGE FROM DIRECT<br />
INVOLVEMENT IN DECISION-MAKING THROUGH TO CONSULTATION..<br />
PUBLIC PARTICIPATION IN PLANNING AND DECISION-MAKING<br />
FOR, AND IMPLEMENTATION OF, PROGRAMS SHOULD BE<br />
ENCOURAGED AND ASSISTED.<br />
STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED TO<br />
DELEGATE TO REGIONAL BODIES MORE RESPONSIBILITY FOR<br />
THOSE STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS WHICH ARE<br />
MOST APPROPRIATELY DELIVERED AT THE REGIONAL LEVEL AND<br />
TO FOSTER PUBLIC PARTICIPATION.<br />
ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
GOVERNMENT'S REGIONAL POLICY WILL NEED TO BE FLEXIBLE. THERE MAY </p>
<p>BE DIFFERENCES FROM STATE TO STATE, AND REGION TO REGION,<br />
BECAUSE OF PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES.<br />
REVIEW OF GENERAL REVENUE ASSISTANCE ARRANGEMENTS<br />
I NOW SHOULD LIKE TO MAKE SOME OBSERVATIONS ON THE<br />
ECONOMIC CONTEXT IN WHICH THE REVIEW OF GENERAL REVENUE<br />
ASSISTANCE ARRANGEMENTS IS TO BE MADE. I SHALL THEN<br />
DEAL MORE SPECIFICALLY WITH OUR VIEWS ON WHAT THE NEW<br />
FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE ARRANGEMENTS SHOULD BE.<br />
IN THE PAST EIGHTEEN MONTHS THE MAJOR ECONOMIES OF THE<br />
WORLD SEVERELY AFFECTED BY THE OIL PRICE RISE AND THE<br />
DESTABILISING EFFECTS OF THAT ON WORLD TRADE AND INVESTOR<br />
CONFIDENCE HAVE BEEN STRUGGLING WITH THE TWIN PROBLEMS OF<br />
RISING UNEMPLOYMENT AND RISING INFLATION. AUSTRALIA HAS NOT<br />
BEEN ABLE TO INSULATE ITSELF FROM THAT WORLD SITUATION.<br />
BUT IN AUSTRALIA AS IN OTHER COUNTRIES THE BATTLE IS<br />
NOW ON TO RESTORE A MORE BALANCED ECONOMIC ORDER, WE ARE SEEING<br />
ECONOMIC GROWTH BEGINNING AGAIN. THE RISE IN UNEMPLOYMENT SEEMS<br />
TO HAVE COME TO AN END AND 1975/ 76 PROMISES TO SEE EMPLOYMENT<br />
OPPORTUNITIES ON THE INCREASE AGAIN. BUT INFLATION REMAINS DEEPSEATED.<br />
FIRM AND RESPONSIBLE POLICIES WILL HAVE TO BE FOLLOWED<br />
IF IT IS TO BE BROUGHT UNDER CONTROL. INFLATION AT A RATE<br />
APPROACHING 20 PER CENT A YEAR IS INTOLERABLE. IT WRECKS<br />
CONFIDENCE, DISCOURAGES PRIVATE INVESTMENT, ROBS ORDINARY PEOPLE<br />
OF THE VALUE OF THEIR SAVINGS AND PREVENTS GOVERNMENTS FROM<br />
PURSUING CONSISTENTLY AND IN A PROPERLY PLANNED WAY THE IMPORTANT<br />
SOCIAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL PROGRAMS WE WERE ELECTED TO PURSUE. 7 </p>
<p>SOME OF THE UNCERTAINTIES THAT SURROUNDED THE OUTLOOK FOR<br />
INFLATION EARLIER THIS YEAR HAVE BEEN CLEARED BY THE DECISIONS OF<br />
THE CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION COMMISSION IN'THE NATIONAL WAGE<br />
AND METAL INDUSTRIES CASES. THOSE WERE RESPONSIBLE DECISIONS.<br />
GOVERMENTS MUST ALSO DO ALL THEY CAN TO CREATE AN ECONOMIC CLIMATE<br />
IN WHICH THE SUGGESTED WAGE DETERMINATION GUIDELINES HAVE THE<br />
PROSPECT OF BEING ADHERED TO. A BIG RESPONSIBILITY ALSO FALLS ON<br />
THE COMMUNITY ITSELF HERE AND, IN PARTICULAR, ON UNION LEADERSHIP.<br />
THIS CONFERENCE COULD PLAY ITS PART BY EXPRESSING A FIRM<br />
COMMITMENT BY GOVERNMENTS TO ACTION TO ENSURE OBSERVANCE OF THE<br />
PRINCIPLES SET OUT IN THE NATIONAL WAGE CASE DECISION IN PARTICULAR<br />
IN RESPECT OF PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT WITHIN GOVERNMENT CONTROL. WE WILL<br />
BE DISCUSSING THIS UNDER THE AGENDA ITEM ON WORKING PARTIES ON<br />
INFLATION BUT I MENTION HERE THAT I HAVE ASKED ALL MY MINISTERIAL<br />
COLLEAGUES TO ACT CONSISTENTLY IN HANDLING WAGE CLAIMS WHICH ARISE<br />
IN THEIR INDIVIDUAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY IN THE LIGHT OF THE<br />
NATIONAL WAGE CASE DECISION.<br />
FOR OUR PART, WE AIM TO ENSURE THAT THE RECOVERY IN THE<br />
ECONOMY STRENGTHENS AND CONTINUES BUT DOES NOT REACH A PACE THAT<br />
ONCE AGAIN LEADS TO A SCRAMBLE FOR RESOURCES. AN ORDERLY RECOVERY<br />
WILL HELP ACHIEVE A CLIMATE CONDUCIVE TO THE EXPANSION OF<br />
INVESTMENT THAT IS NECESSARY TO ENSURE CONTINUED PROSPERITY AND<br />
GROWTH OF EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES.<br />
LET ME NOW TURN BRIEFLY TO SOME OF THE FEATURES OF THE<br />
CURRENT ECONOMIC SCENE.<br />
THE OPENING MONTHS OF 1975 HAVE SEEN A STRONG RECOVERY<br />
OF CONSUMER DEMAND. COUPLED WITH CONTINUED GROWTH OF GOVERNMENT<br />
EXPENDITURE AND EXPORTS THIS HAS RESULTED IN A SIZABLE INCREASE IN<br />
TOTAL DEMAND IN SPITE OF DECLINING PRIVATE INVESTMENT.<br />
HOWEVER, DEMAND GROWTH HAS BEEN MORE THAN MET BY SUPPLY FROM .18 </p>
<p>SWOLLEN STOCKS. AS A RESULT THERE HAS BEEN LITTLE INCENTIVE TO<br />
INCREASE PRODUCTION AND EMPLOYMENT, BUT THIS IS EXPECTED TO<br />
STRENGTHEN FROM NOW ON AS STOCKS RETURN TO MORE NORMAL LEVELS.<br />
GROWTH IN THE VOLUME OF MONEY HAS BEEN EXCEPTIONALLY<br />
STRONG. THE PERIOD OF SEASONAL TIGHTENING OF LIQUIDITY AT<br />
THE END OF THE FINANCIAL YEAR IS PASSING WITH ONLY MINOR<br />
STRAINS ON FINANCIAL MARKETS; BANKS WILL ENTER THE SEASONAL<br />
UPSWING WITH EXTREMELY HIGH LIQUIDITY RATIOS.<br />
UNEMPLOYMENT SHOWED SIGNS OF IMPROVEMENT IN MAY AND<br />
A CONTINUED GRADUAL DECLINE IS CURRENTLY IN PROSPECT. THIS<br />
IMPROVEMENT OWES MUCH TO EXPANDED GOVERNMENT SPENDING BUT<br />
INDICATIONS ARE THAT THE TREND IN PRIVATE SECTOR EMPLOYMENT<br />
WILL SOON TURN UPWARDS ONCE AGAIN.<br />
THE BALANCE OF PAYMENTS POSES NO IMMEDIATE PROBLEMS<br />
BUT HERE AGAIN THE OUTLOOK FOR TWELVE MONTHS HENCE IS<br />
DEPENDENT ON THE COURSE OF DEMAND AND INFLATION.<br />
IT IS PLEASING TO NOTE THAT THE RATES OF INCREASE OF<br />
BOTH PRICES AND WAGES SLOWED SOMEWHAT DURING THE MARCH QUARTER.<br />
HOWEVER, EVEN THOUGH INFLATION RATES HAVE RECENTLY FALLEN<br />
SOMEWHAT THEY REMAIN HIGH; THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX INCREASED<br />
BY 3.6 PER CENT IN THE MARCH QUARTER AND 17.6 PER CENT IN THE<br />
YEAR TO MARCH. SUCH RATES ARE MUCH TOO HIGH AT THE OUTSET OF<br />
A RECOVERY PHASE AND FOLLOWING, AS THEY DO, SIMILAR RATES OF<br />
INCREASE FOR THE PAST TWELVE MONTHS. ONE THING IS CLEAR<br />
THERE HAS TO BE SOME ABATEMENT IN THE RATE OF INCREASE IN<br />
GOVERNMENT SPENDING IF WE ARE TO GET OUT OF OUR PRESENT TROUBLES.<br />
GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE ON FINAL GOODS AND SERVICES<br />
( AN APPROXIMATE MEASURE OF THE NATION'S PRODUCTION DIRECTLY </p>
<p>CONSUMED BY THE GOVERNMENT SECTOR) HAS RISEN FROM 20 PER CENT<br />
OF TOTAL NATIONAL EXPENDITURE TO 23 PER CENT IN THE COURSE OF<br />
A YEAR. AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT TOTAL BUDGET OUTLAYS INCLUDING<br />
ASSISTANCE TO THE STATES HAVE RISEN FROM BETWEEN 24 AND<br />
PER CENT OF GDP IN THE PRECEDING THREE YEARS TO OVER 30 PER<br />
CENT THIS YEAR. IN 1974/ 75 IT WAS APPROPRIATE TO MAKE USE OF<br />
RESOURCES THAT WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE REMAINED IDLE IN THE<br />
PRIVATE SECTOR, BUT THE SHIFT OF RESOURCES TO THE PUBLIC<br />
SECTOR CANNOT CONTINUE AT THAT RATE IF THE ECONOMY IS TO BE<br />
GOT BACK ON ITS FEET. IN THE COMING FINANCIAL YEAR THERE WILL<br />
NEED TO BE MODERATION IN PUBLIC SECTOR SPENDING.<br />
I COME TO THE MAIN FINANCIAL QUESTIONS WHICH ARE OF<br />
IMMEDIATE CONCERN TO THIS MEETING SPECIFICALLY THE MATTER OF<br />
GENERAL REVENUE GRANTS IN 1975/ 76 AND SUBSEQUENT YEARS AND THE<br />
MATTER OF THE LOAN COUNCIL PROGRAMS OF THE STATES AND THEIR<br />
AUTHORITIES IN 1975/ 76.<br />
THE PRESENT GENERAL REVENUE ASSISTANCE ARRANGEMENTS<br />
WERE ORIGINALLY SETTLED AT A PREMIERS' CONFERENCE [ N JUNE 1970.<br />
AT THAT TIME THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT UNDERTOOK TO REVIEW<br />
THE ARRANGEMENTS AFTER FIVE YEARS. ALTHOUGH THE LEGISLATION<br />
UNDER WHICH THE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE GRANTS ARE PAID -THE<br />
STATES GRANTS ACT 1973/ 74 HAS INDEFINITE APPLICATION INTO<br />
THE FUTURE, WE ACCEPT THE OBLIGATION TO REVIEW THE ARRANGEMENTS.<br />
THE SPECIFIC QUESTION BEFORE US IS WHETHER ANY CHANGES IN<br />
THE LEGISLATION TO WHICH I REFERRED ARE DESIRABLE. YOU HAVE<br />
PROPOSED RADICAL CHANGES IN THAT LEGISLATION. YOUR MAIN<br />
PROPOSALS ARE THAT THE BASE ON WHICH THE FORMUJLA GRANTS IN<br />
1975/ 76 ARE CALCULATED BE INCREASED BY $ 350 MILLION AND THAT<br />
THE PRESENT AVERAGE WAGES ELEMENT IN THE FORMULA BE REPLACED<br />
BY A NEW PROGRESSION FACTOR EQUAL TO 1.~ 5 TIMES THE INCREASE </p>
<p>IN AVERAGE WAGES EACH YEAR. I HAVE ALREADY INFORMED YOU<br />
THAT THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT DOES NOT ACCEPT THESE<br />
PROPOSALS. WE REJECT THEM FOR FOUR I14TER-RELATED REASONS.<br />
FIRST, WE REJECT THE CONCEPT ON WHICH THE STATES'<br />
PROPOSALS ARE BASED THAT IS, THAT THE GRANTS ARRANGEMENTS<br />
SHOULD BE BASED, IN EFFECT. ON REIMBURSEMENT OR COMPENSATION<br />
FOR INCOME TAX FORGONE. THAT CONCEPT HAS LONG BEEN<br />
ABANDONED. SUCCESSIVE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENTS HAVE TAKEN<br />
THE VIEW THAT IT IS MORE LOGICAL AND APPROPRIATE THAT THE<br />
0 GRANTS BE BASED ON THE STATES' FINANCIAL NEEDS RATHER THAN<br />
ON MOVEMENTS IN ONE OF THE REVENUE SOURCES FROM W# HICH THE<br />
FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE GRANTS ARE FINANCED.<br />
SECONDLY, WE HAVE DOUBTS ABOUT THE WAY THE BASIC<br />
CONCEPT HAS BEEN APPLIED. SPECIFICALLY, WE NOTE THAT THE<br />
PROPOSALS ARE, AT LEAST IMPLICITLY, BASED ON THE ASSUMPTION<br />
THAT PRESENT INCOME TAX RATES WILL REMAIN UNCHANGED<br />
INDEFINITELY. GIVEN THE EFFECTS OF THE PROGRESSIVE RATE<br />
STRUCTURE OF THE PERSONAL INCOME TAX AS WAGE AND SALARY RATES<br />
RISE, THAT SEEMS TO US TO BE A QUITE UNJUSTIFIED ASSUMPTION.<br />
WITHOUT DISCUSSING THIS ASPECT IN DETAIL, I CAN SUMMARISE<br />
BY SAYING THAT IN OUR VIEW IT MEANS THAT THE STATES' PROPOSALS<br />
ARE TOO GENEROUS EVEN BY THEIR OWN CRITERION.<br />
THE THIRD REASON IS A MORE COMPLEX ONE AND I CAN<br />
REFER TO IT ONLY BRIEFLY HERE. IT IS, IN ESSENCE. THAT<br />
ACCEPTANCE OF THE STATES' PROPOSALS COULD INVOLVE, IN TIMES<br />
OF RAPID INCREASES IN WAGE AND SALARY RATES, AN UNDUE TRANSFER<br />
OF FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY FROM THE STATES TO THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
GOVERNMENT, PARTICULARLY IN RESPECT OF BUSINESS UNDERTAKINGS<br />
AND SIMILAR ACTIVITIES. 000/ 11 </p>
<p>THE BURDEN OF FINANCING THESE SERVICES COULD WELL<br />
HE INCREASINGLY SHIFTEI) FROM Ti'll' USES OF THE SERVI(: ES. TO<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT'S BUIDGET AND THENCE TO TAXPAYIElRS<br />
IN GENERAL, WITIH THE SERVI]( 1CES IN OUESTION BECOMING, I N THAT<br />
SENSE, MORE AND MORE UNECONOMIC. THE PRINCIPLE THAT THE<br />
USER PAYS SHOULD SURELY APPLY TO TIHESE SERVICES JUST AS TO<br />
POSTAL AND OTHER SUCH SERVICES PROVIDED BY THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
GOVERNMENT. FINALLY, ALTHOUGH THE COSTS OF THE STATES'<br />
PROPOSALS CANNOT BE PREDICTED ACCURATELY ( AS THEY WILL<br />
DEPEND ON FUTURE MOVEMENTS IN POPULATION AND AVERAGE WAGES),<br />
IT IS CLEAR THAT THEY WOULD BE FAR BEYOND WHAT COULD<br />
REASONABLY BE EXPECTED TO BE BORNE BY THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
GOVERNMENT'S BUDGET. EVEN ON MODEST ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT<br />
MOVEMENTS IN POPULATION AND AVERAGE WAGES, THE ADDITIONAL<br />
GRANTS RESULTING FROM THE STATES' PROPOSALS WOULD RUN INTO<br />
MANY THOUSANDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OVER A FIVE YEAR AGREEMENT.<br />
ONE PARTICULAR POINT THAT WE HAVE NOTED IN THIS<br />
GENERAL BUDGETARY CONTEXT IS THAT THE STATES' PROPOSALS APPEAR<br />
TO INVOLVE ADDITIONAL AJSTRAIAN GOVERNMENT FUNDS IN 1975/ 76<br />
SU'FFICIENT TO MEET, AND ON THE FIGURES GIVEN TO US, POSSIBLY<br />
MORE THAN MEET, THE STATES' PROSPECTIVE BUDGETARY " GAPS" IN<br />
THAT YEAR ( ON THE BASIS OF EXISTING RATES OF TAXES AND CHARGES<br />
AND PROJECTEID EXPENDITURE 1, EVELS). PARTICULARLY IN THE LIGHT<br />
TIE AUSTIRALIAN GOVERNMENT'S OWN SEVERE BUDGETARY P* ROB,: lMS<br />
TIIAT ) lDO: NSO T SELEM TO US TO BE REASONABLE.<br />
ALTHOUGH THE AUSTRAIIAN GOVERNMENT THUS DOES NOT<br />
ACCEPT THE STATES' PROPOSALS, Wt BELIEVE NEVERTHELESS THAT / 12 </p>
<p>THERE IS A CASE FOR AN INCREASE IN THE LEVELS OF THE GRANTS<br />
IN 1975/ 76 BEYOND THOSE WHICH WOULD BE YIELDED BY THE<br />
EXISTING FORMULA AND THAT THERE IS A CASE FOR AN IMPROVEMENT<br />
IN THE ANNUAL GROWTH PRODUCED BY THAT FORMULA.<br />
IN COMING TO THAT JUDGEMENT WE HAVE HAD A NUMBER<br />
OF CONSIDERATIONS IN MIND. NOTABLE AMONGST THEM HAS BEEN OUR<br />
DESIRE TO ELIMINATE, OR AT THE VERY LEAST TO REDUCE AS FAR<br />
AS POSSIBLE, WHAT HAS BECOME KNOWN AS THE ANNUAL " WRANGLE"<br />
BETWEEN THE AUSTRALIAN AND STATE GOVERNMENTS.<br />
WE HAVE OBSERVED IN THIS CONNECTION THAT OVER THE<br />
LAST FIVE YEARS ASSISTANCE TOTALLING OVER $ 800 MILLION HAS<br />
BEEN PROVIDED TO THE STATES OVER AND ABOVE THAT WHICH WOULD<br />
HAVE BEEN YIELDED HAD THE ORIGINAL ARRANGEMENTS BEEN ADHERED<br />
TO THAT FIGURE, INCIDENTALLY, EXCLUDES ABOUT $ 600 MILLION<br />
IN ADDITIONAL GRANTS RESULTING FROM THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
GOVERNMENT'S AGREEMENT TO COMPENSATE THE STATES FOR LOSS OF<br />
RECEIPTS DUTY. OUR PROPOSALS ON THESE AND OTHER FINANCIAL MATTERS<br />
ARE SPELLED OUT IN DETAIL IN A DOCUMENT WHICH WILL BE<br />
CIRCULATED AT THE CONCLUSION OF THIS SPEECH, IN BRIEF, THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT IS OFFERING TO:-<br />
INCREASE THE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE GRANTS ABOVE<br />
WHAT THEY WOULD BE IN 1975/ 76 ON THE BASIS OF<br />
EXISTING LEGISLATION BY A TOTAL OF $ 200 MILLION;<br />
IMPROVE THE SUBSEQUENT RATE OF GROWTH OF THE<br />
GRANTS BY INCREASING THE PRESENT BETTERMENT<br />
FACTOR OF 1.8 PER CENT TO 3 PER CENT. / l 3 </p>
<p>13<br />
THERE WILL BE CLAIMS THAT THE INCREASE IN THE<br />
BETTERMENT FACTOR BY 1.2 PER CENT TO 3 PER CENT DOES<br />
NOT REPRESENT A VERY SIGNIFICANT CHANGE. HOWEVER, GIVEN<br />
THE MAGNITUDE OF THE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE GRANTS, THE<br />
EFFECTS, PARTI CULARLY GIVEN THAT THEY WOULD BE CUMULATIVE<br />
OVER THE YEARS, WOULD IN FACT BE SUBSTANTIAL. THE PRECISE<br />
EFFECTS OF OUR PROPOSALS CANNOT BE ESTIMATED. AS YOU WILL<br />
APPRECIATE, THEY WILL DEPEND ON FUTURE MOVEMENTS IN AVERAGE<br />
WAGES AND POPULATION. ON THE BASIS OF CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS<br />
ABOUT WAGES AND POPULATION GROWTH, HOWEVER, WE ESTIMATE<br />
THAT THE EFFECT OF OUR PROPOSALS WILL BE TO INCREASE THE<br />
GRANTS, OVER THE FIVE YEARS BEGINNING IN 1975/ 76, BY<br />
SOMETHING IN THE ORDER OF $ 2,200 MILLION. OF THIS, THE<br />
INCREMENT TO THE 1975/ 76 GRANTS WOULD ACCOUNT FOR AROUND<br />
$ 1,500 MILLION AND THE IMPROVEMENT TO THE BETTERMENT FACTOR<br />
FOR AROUND $ 700 MILLION.<br />
I EMPHASISE THAT THIS LARGE GAIN WILL BE<br />
ON TOP OF THE GROWTH IN ASSISTANCE FLOWING FROM THE<br />
PRESENT ARRANGEMENT. AS AN INDICATION OF THE GROWTH<br />
PRODUCED BY THE PRESENT FORMULA IT IS ESTIMATED THAT<br />
FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE GRANTS IN 1975/ 76 WILL BE AROUND<br />
$ 600 MILLION HIGHER THAN IN 1974/ 75 EVEN WITHOUT THE<br />
IMPROVEMENTS WE HAVE PROPOSED.<br />
THESE PROPOSALS, WHEN-ADDED TO OTHER INITIATIVES ./ 14 </p>
<p>14.<br />
WHICH THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT HAS TAKEN IN THE FIELD<br />
OF FEDERAL-STATE FINANCES, OR IN AREAS AFFECTING THOSE<br />
FINANCES, REPRESENT VERY RADICAL CHANGES INDEED. IN<br />
PARTICULAR I HAVE IN MIND THAT IN ASSESSING THE STATES'<br />
OVERALL FINANCIAL POSITION ACCOUNT MUST BE TAKEN OF OUR<br />
ASSUMPTION OF FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCING<br />
TERTIARY EDUCATION, THE NEW OR EXPANDED PROGRAMS OF<br />
SPECIFIC ASSISTANCE OVER A WIDE RANGE OF ACTIVITIES<br />
FOR WHICH THE STATES PREVIOUSLY HAD SOLE OR MAIN<br />
RESPONSIBILITY, OUR OFFERS TO TAKE OVER THE STATES'<br />
RAILWAYS, AND THE " MEDIBANK" SCHEME FOR SHARING THE<br />
RUNNING COSTS OF PUBLIC HOSPITALS, AS WELL AS THE<br />
PROPOSALS IN RELATION TO REVENUE GRANTS WHICH I HAVE<br />
JUST OUTLINED. IN RESPECT OF TWO OF THESE MATTERS MEDIBANK<br />
AND RAILWAYS NOT ALL OF THE STATES HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE<br />
OF OUR OFFERS AND THEIR BUDGETS, RELATIVE TO THOSE STATES<br />
WHICH HAVE, WILL SUFFER ACCORDINGLY.<br />
THE PLAIN FACT IS THAT IF ALL STATES ACCEPTED<br />
OUR OFFERS IN RELATION TO MEDIBANK AND THE TRANSFER<br />
OF RAILWAYS THEIR BUDGETARY PROSPECTS, BOTH SHORT AND<br />
LONG TERM, WOULD BE VERY MUCH BETTER INDEED THAN THEY<br />
ARE NOW. </p>
<p>WE HAD HOPED THAT ALL THE STATES WOULD HAVE ENTERED THE<br />
HOSPITAL SIDE OF MEDIBANK FROM 1 JULY 1975, UNDER THE PROPOSED<br />
HOSPITAL AGREEMENTS WE WOULD HAVE ASSISTED THE STATES TO THE<br />
EXTENT OF 50 PER CENT OF THE NET OPERATING COSTS OF PUBLIC<br />
HOSPITALS. TASMANIA AND SOUTH AUSTRALIA SAW THE VALUE OF WHAT<br />
WE WERE OFFERING AND WE HAVE ENTERED INTO AGREEMENTS WITH THEM.<br />
WE HOPE THAT QUEENSLAND WILL FOLLOW. NEW SOUTH WALES, VICTORIA<br />
AND WESTERN AUSTRALIA, INSTEAD OF HELPING US EXPEDITE THE<br />
INTRODUCTION OF THE SCHEME IN THEIR STATES, AS LATE AS<br />
MAY 1975 WERE WRITING TO ME PROPOSING NEW AGREEMENTS AGREEMENTS<br />
THAT I INFORMED THEM ON 12 JUNE WERE COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE.<br />
WITH GREATER CO-OPERATION THE HOSPITAL SYSTEMS 01" THOSE STATES<br />
WOULD BE BENEFITING FROM MANY MILLIONS OF DOLLARS PROVIDED BY THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT.<br />
NONE OF YOU NEED REMINDING OF THE MAJOR BUDGETARY BURDENS<br />
THAT ARE CAUSED BY THE LOSSES OF YOUR RAILWAYS SYSTEMS, I AM TOLD<br />
THAT THE ESTIMATED DEFICITS FOR THE RAIL SYSTEMS IN 1974-75 EXCEED<br />
$ 400 MILLION THREE TIMES AS MUCH AS THREE YEARS AGO CLEAR<br />
EVIDENCE OF THE HIGH PRICE AUSTRALIA AS A NATION, AND EACH STATE<br />
GOVERNMENT, IS PAYING FOR THE UNPLANNED, UNCO-ORDINATED APPROACH<br />
TO RAIL TRANSPORT AND INDEED TRANSPORT GENERALLY, UNLIKE AUSTRALIA,<br />
OTHER FEDERAL SYSTEMS OPERATE THEIR RAILWAYS ON A NATIONAL BASIS,<br />
TASMANIA IS NOW TO BE RELIEVED OF THIS WORRY, IT WILL<br />
ALSO RECEIVE POSITIVE FINANCIAL BENEFITS BECAUSE THE OFFSET TO ITS<br />
FORMULA GRANTS BASE WILL BE LESS THAN THE RAILWAYS DEFICIT<br />
OF WHICH IT WILL BE RELIEVED, TASMANIA'S NET GAIN<br />
WILL BE $ 303 MILLION. THE SOUTH AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT HAS SOUGHT<br />
A SIMILAR ARRANGEMENT IN RESPECT OF ITS NON-METROPOLITAN RAILWAY<br />
SYSTEM ITS NET GAIN TO THE " BASE" WOULD BE $ 25 MILLION. / 16 </p>
<p>I STATED IN MY 1972 POLICY SPEECH THAT MY GOVERNMENT<br />
WOULD ACCEPT THE OFFERS OF THE NEW SOUTH WALES AND VICTORIAN<br />
PREMIERS FOR A TRANSFER OF THEIR STATE RAILWAY SYSTEMS. DESPITE<br />
A FORMAL INVITATION THESE OFFERS HAVE NOT BEEN RENEWED. SIMILAR<br />
INVITATIONS HAVE BEEN MADE TO OTHER PREMIERS. IT IS OPEN TO THEM<br />
TO FOLLOW THE LEAD OF THEIR MORE PROGRESSIVE BRETHREN IN SOUTH<br />
AUSTRALIA AND TASMANIA. WE REMAIN PREPARED TO DISCUSS WITH EACH<br />
STATE THE TRANSFER OF ITS RAILWAY SYSTEM TO THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
GOVERNMENT. SURELY THIS IS ONLY GOOD SENSE GOOD SENSE FOR<br />
THE STATES' FINANCIAL POSITION, AN) GOOD SENSE FOR AUSTRALIA IF<br />
IT LEADS TOWARDS A TRULY NATIONAL RAILWAY SYSTEM.<br />
IT MAY BE SUGGESTED THAT THE ADDITIONAL FUND) S NOW<br />
OFFERED WILL DO TOO LITTLE TO DEAL SPECIFICALLY WITH THE MAIN<br />
FACTOR CAUSING THE STATES' BUD3GETARY PROBLEMS NAMELY INFLATION.<br />
IN CONSIDERING SUCH A VIEW, HOWEVER, IT HAS TO BE BORNE IN MIND<br />
THAT, PARTICULARLY TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE STATES' PAY-ROLL TAX<br />
REVENUES A HIGH PROPORTION OF THE ADDITIONAL COSTS TO THE STATES<br />
AR[ SING FROM INFLATION IS ALREADY AUTOMATICALLY RECOVERED BY<br />
INCREASED FORMULA GRANTS AN) TAX RECEIPTS. FURTHERMORE, IT SEEMS<br />
IMP3LICIT IN THE APPROACH PUBLICLY TAKEN BY SOME PREMIERS AT LEAST<br />
THAT FOR SOME REASON IT IS APPROPRIATE THAT INCREASES IN PUBLIC<br />
EXPENDITURES ATTRIBUTABLE TO INCREASES IN COST LEVELS SHOULD BE<br />
BORNE BY THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT'S BUDGETS RATHER THAN BY THE<br />
STATES'. THAT VIEW APPEARS, IN TURN, TO BE BASED ON A VIEW THAT<br />
INCREASES IN INCOME TAX, UNLIKE INCREASES IN OTHER TAXES, ARE<br />
SOMEHOW PAINLESS! IT IS SURELY NOW OBVIOUS TO US ALL THAT SUCH<br />
A VIEW IS MISTAKEN. 0/ 17 </p>
<p>17.<br />
THERE IS AN OUTDATED ATTITUDE THAT INCOME TAXES ARE LESS<br />
INFLATIONARY THAN INDIRECT TAXES. WAGE EARNERS ARE CONSCIOUS<br />
OF HIGH MARGINAL INCOME TAX RATES, WAGE CLAIMS ARE MADE ACCORDINGLY.<br />
FURTHER, THE MATHEWS COMMITTEE'S THESIS ON THE NEED TO INDEX INCOME<br />
TAX AND THE ASPREY COMMITTEE'S VIEWS ON THE SHIFT[ NG OF INCIDENCE<br />
TO INDIRECT TAXES ARE BOTH OPPOSED TO THIS OUTDATED ATTITUDE.<br />
THE VERY REAL BENEFITS WHICH WOULD ACCRUE TO THE STATES<br />
UNDER THE PROPOSALS I HAVE MADE SHOULD NOT BE OBSCURED OR LOST<br />
SIGHT OF IN THE COMPLEX OF MATTERS WHICH MIGHT BE RAISED TODAY.<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT PROPOSES THAT IF THE NEW SET OF<br />
ARRANGEMENTS TO COMMENCE IN 1975-76 IS TO BE FOR FIVE YEARS, IT<br />
OUGHT TO BE REVIEWED BEFORE THE END OF 1979-80. WE WOULD PROPOSE,<br />
ALSO AGAIN FOLLOWING PAST PRACTICE, THAT THE ARRANGEMENTS WOULD BE<br />
SUBJECT TO REVISION BEFORE THEN IF THERE OCCURRED SUBSTANTIAL<br />
CHANGES IN AUSTRALIAN/ STATE FINANCIAL RELATIONSHIPS, OR IN MAJOR<br />
FACTORS AFFECTING THOSE RELATIONSHIPS. IN PARTICULAR, THE<br />
ARRANGEMENTS WILL BE SUBJECT TO THE STATES CONTINUING TO<br />
REFRAIN FROM LEVYING TAXES ON INCOME,<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT'S PROPOSALS ARE MADE ON THE<br />
CLEAR UNDERSTANDING THAT SUBSEQUENT REQUESTS BY THE STATES FOR<br />
ASSISTANCE SUPPLEMENTARY TO THAT YIELDED BY THE FORMULA WILL NOT<br />
BE ENTERTAINED EXCEPT IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH ARE TRULY ABNORMAL<br />
AND UNPREDICTABLE, AND WITH WHICH THE STATES ARE CLEARLY UNABLE<br />
TO COPE UNAIDED. </p>
<p>THATIN TOTAL, IS OUR PROPOSAL ON REVENUE GRANTS FOR THE<br />
NEXT FIVE YEARS. IT CLEARLY OFFERS CONSIDERABLE BENEFITS TO THE<br />
STATES AND WE WOULD EXPECT IT TO BE ACCEPTED BY THE STATES. THE<br />
ALTERNATIVE TO A NEW SET OF ARRANGEMENTS IS THOSE WHICH WOULD<br />
CONTINUE UNDER EXISTING LEGISLATION AND THE STATES ARE, OF COURSE,<br />
FREE TO CHOOSE THAT ALTERNATIVE.<br />
I NOW TURN BRIEFLY TO THE MATTER OF GENERAL PURPOSE<br />
CAPITAL FUNDS FOR THE STATES AND THEIR AUTHORITIES IN 1975-76.<br />
IN A FORMAL SENSE, THESE ARE DECISIONS TO BE TAKEN IN AND BY THE<br />
LOAN COUNCIL. BUT THESE FUNDS ARE, OF COURSE, A MOST IMPORTANT<br />
ELEMENT IN THE STATES' FINANCES AND WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS<br />
APPROPRIATE THAT THE STATES BE INFORMED RIGHT AT THE BEGINNING<br />
OF THIS MEETING OF THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT; S PROPOSALS IN<br />
AGGREGATE. AGAIN, OUR PROPOSALS ARE SET OUT IN DETAIL IN THE<br />
DOCUMENT TO BE CIRCULATED.<br />
IN BRIEF AND ABSTRACTING FROM SPECIAL FACTORS WE HAVE<br />
IN MIND INCREASES IN THE LOAN COUNCIL PROGRAMS OF BOTH THE STATE<br />
GOVERNMENTS AND THEIR " LARGER" AUTHORITIES OF JUST OVER<br />
17 PER CENT. WE PROPOSE THAT, FOLLOWING THE PRACTICE OF SOME<br />
YEARS NOW NO OVERALL LIMIT BE SET ON BORROWINGS BY SMALLER<br />
AUTHORITIES. WE ALSO PROPOSE THAT, AS A MEASURE OF ASSISTANCE<br />
TO SUCH AUTHORITIES, THE BORROWING LIMIT FOR INDIVIDUAL<br />
AUTHORITIES BEFORE THEY HAVE TO BE INCLUDED IN THE " LARGER"<br />
CATEGORY BE INCREASED FROM $ 500,000 TO $ 600,000. / 19 </p>
<p>19.<br />
WHILE SPEAKING OF THE CAPITAL FUNDS TO BE MADE<br />
AVAILABLE TO THE STATES IN 1975-76 I MIGHT MENTION THE MATTER<br />
OF ADVANCES TO THE STATES FOR WELFARE HOUSING IN THAT YEAR. THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT'S DECISION ON THIS MATTER WILL BE MADE IN THE<br />
BUDGET CONTEXT ANID THE STATES WILL THEN BE INFORMED. THE STATES<br />
CAN, HOWEVER, COUNT ON GETTING NOT LESS THAN THE 1974-75 AMOUNTS.<br />
LOCAL GOVERNMENT I SHOULD NOT PASS FROM THIS DISCUSSION OF REVENUE<br />
ASSISTANCE WITHOUT ACKNOWLEDGING THE FINANCIAL PROBLEMS FACING<br />
LOCAL GOVERNMENT. THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT HAS TAKEN SIGNIFICANT STEPS<br />
TO MAKE LOCAL GOVERNMENT A MORE EFFECTIVE MEMBER OF THE FEDERAL<br />
SYSTEM. THE ROLE OF THE GRANTS COMMISSION HAS BEEN WIDENED TO<br />
INCLUDE LOCAL GOVERNMENT. IN 1974-75 THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT<br />
MADE UNTIED GRANTS OF SOME $ 56 MILLION TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT<br />
BODIES. OTHER ASSISTANCE HAS BEEN GIVEN TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT<br />
THROUGH THE AREA IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM, THE NATIONAL ESTATE,<br />
THE NATIONAL SEWERAGE PROGRAM AND THROUGH OTHER PROGRAMS IN<br />
SUCH FIELDS AS TOURISM AND RECREATION, TRANSPORT, EDUCATION,<br />
AND SOCIAL WELFARE. ABOUT THREE QUARTERS OF THE FUNDS<br />
ALLOCATED UNDER THE REDS PROGRAM HAS GONE TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT.<br />
THE CONDITIONS OF FINANCIAL STRINGENCY THAT ITE FACE<br />
TODAY ALLOW LITTLE ROOM FOR FURTHER INCREASE IN THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
GOVERNMENT'S ASSISTANCE TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT. CERTAINLY, THERE </p>
<p>COULD BE NO MOVE FROM RELIANCE BY LOCAL GOVERNMENT ON LOCAL RATES<br />
AS A PRIME SOURCE OF REVENUE AND AS A REGULATOR OF DEMAND FORSERVICES<br />
CONCLUSION THE PLACE OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT OF COURSE IS IMPORTANT<br />
TO OUR CONCEPTS OF REGIONALISM AND CO-OPERATIVE PLANNING.<br />
WE SEE REGIONALISM AND CO-OPERATIVE PLANNING, TOGETHER,<br />
RATIONALISING THE ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES BETWEEN THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
AND STATE GOVERNMENTS. THEY WOULD OVERCOME MANY OF THE CONCERNS<br />
THAT YOUR OFFICIALS HAVE EXPRESSED ABOUT CONDITIONS ATTACHING<br />
TO SPECIFIC PURPOSE PAYMENTS. THEY WOULD DECENTRALISE DECISIONMAKING<br />
TO THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL.<br />
S THE POSITION MY GOVERNM'ENT HAS ADOPTED IS NEITHER NOVEL<br />
NOR UJNIQUE. PROFESSOR RUSSELL MATHEWS, THE DIRECTOR OF THE CENTRE<br />
FOR RESEARCH ON FEDERAL FINANCIAL RELATIONS IN HIS 1974 REPORT<br />
POINTED TO THE NEED FOR AUSTRALIAN AND STATE GOVERNMENTS TO RECOGNISE<br />
THEIR INTERDEPENDENCE AND TO DEVISE EFFECTIVE MEANS OF CO-ORDINATING<br />
THEIR DECISION-MAKING PROCESSES.<br />
WE SHOULD SEEK, FOR THE LONGER TERM, ARRANGEMENTS THAT WILL<br />
COPE WITH CHANGING CIRCUMSTANCES AND CHANGING PRIORITIES AND WILL<br />
ENABLE THE ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES RAISED FROM THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
TAX-PAYER TO BE MADE ON THE BASIS OF THE NEEDS AND PRIORITIES OF<br />
ALL AUSTRALIANS. </p>
