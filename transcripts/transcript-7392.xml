SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
OPENING OF THE AUSTRALIA TELESCOPE<br />
CULGOORA 2 SEPTEMBER 1988<br />
Neville Wran,<br />

Barry Jones,<br />
Distinguished international and Australian guests,<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
Australia has always, from before its inception as a<br />
European settlement, been ansociated with the attempts of<br />
mankind to explore and to understand the universe.<br />
Aboriginal lore included many stories about the formation<br />
nnd behaviour of the celestial bodies.<br />
Captain Cook's voyages of exploration which led to the<br />
European discovery of the eastern coast of Australia: had as<br />
one of their aims the attempt to observe in the South<br />
Pacific the transit of Venus.<br />
And it is particularly fitting to recall, in our<br />
Bicentennial year, that on board the First Fleet was one<br />
Lieutenant William Dawes who had, within the first months of<br />
the settlement of Port Jackson, commenced construction of an<br />
astronomical observatory on the point which today bears his<br />
name. in more recent years, with the birth of radio astronomy as a<br />
field of inquiry, Australian scientists have always been at<br />
the forefront of this research.<br />
Today we are inaugurating a new era in Australian scientific<br />
research the major Bicentennial science project which<br />
will ensure Australia remains at the forefront of radio<br />
astronomy. The CSIRO's Division of Radiophysics was set up during the<br />
Second World War to develop radar equipment for use in the<br />
Pacific. Following the war the scientists set out to<br />
investigate what were then mysterious radio emissions<br />
originating from somewhere ' out there" in the universe.<br />
1 </p>
<p>In those post-war years before quasars and pulsars were even<br />
thought of, it was not surprisingly believed the Sun was the<br />
source of these radio emissions a conclusion which<br />
incidentally allowed researchers to work civilised office<br />
hoursi It was what you could perhaps call the first sunrise<br />
industry.<br />
AS scientists gradually learned more about cosmic radio<br />
sources, Australians were among the pioneers. This was<br />
recognised by the decision to hold the General Assembly of<br />
the International Union of Radio Science in Australia in<br />
1952. Australians were also leading the way in the<br />
development and application of new equipment to make the<br />
increasingly sophisticated astronomical observations that<br />
were required.<br />
When the Parkes Telescope was being planned in the 1950s it<br />
was intended as, and indeed it became, a world class<br />
research tool. It is unfortunate however that during the<br />
planning, the decision was taken not to build it in<br />
Australia. Instead, the 64 metre antenna and most of the<br />
equipment were supplied by West German firms, and most of<br />
the mechanical support systems were supplied by British<br />
firms. The Parkes Telescope went on to be involved in major<br />
discoveries and is certainly a proud symbol of the high<br />
quality of Australian astronomical research.<br />
But my point is that the benefits of Parkes to Australia<br />
were largely limited to the research scientists who used it.<br />
It was imported technology and imported engineering and<br />
this in a field of research where Australia had established<br />
itself as a world leader.<br />
But where Australians had to rely on Europeans to build<br />
Parkes, this time, with the Australia Telescope, we've<br />
relied on ourselves.<br />
The Australia Telescope is the state of the art in<br />
astronomical technology. It is one of the best telescopes<br />
in the world. It is one which will keep Australia at the<br />
forefront of radio astronomy research. And it is conceived,<br />
designed and manufactured in Australia.<br />
Right from the start of the Australia Telescope project, as<br />
you have heard from Dr Frater, it was decided that<br />
Australian firms should be largely responsible for building<br />
the Telescope.<br />
In fact eighty per cent of the content of the Australia<br />
Telescope is Australian. This has helped Australian<br />
industry develop the design and production skills we * will<br />
need if we are to be competitive in our own local market, as<br />
well as on the world market, in one of the most important<br />
and potentially one of the most productive of high<br />
technology industries, the space and telecommunications<br />
industry. </p>
<p>With this $ 50 million Telescope, Australians have proven<br />
their skills and their capacities in key areas of space and<br />
telecommunications research and development.<br />
I note with considerable pride the fact that since their<br />
work on the Telescope many of the Australian companies<br />
involved have developed capabilities enabling them to pursue<br />
export markets for sophisticated manufactures. The<br />
Australia Telescope project has stimulated a substantial<br />
increase in collaboration between CSIRO and industry on<br />
significant new technological development for export.<br />
We are all the beneficiaries when new manufacturing and<br />
export capabilities are developed, because each signals a<br />
step towards the diversification of our economy and a step<br />
away from our vulnerable reliance on a limited range of<br />
primary commodities.<br />
As Prime Minister, I want to express my pride in this<br />
Telescope as a world class achievement and my gratitude to<br />
all those who have been responsible for building it.<br />
It's hard for a layman to even conceive how such complex<br />
instruments can come into being, let alone understand their<br />
workings. But let me tell you some of the things that have<br />
impressed me.<br />
Each of the six 22 metre diameter antennae which make up<br />
this network is relatively small; but thanks to fibre optic<br />
connections they together form a Compact Array which will<br />
simulate a very much larger telescope 6 kilometres in<br />
diameter. When these antennae at Culgoora are supported by a similar<br />
antenna still being built at Siding Spring, and the grand<br />
old radio telescope at Parkes, the whole network will have<br />
the power of a single telescope 300 kilometres in diameter.<br />
Ultimately it will be able to work in concert with other<br />
telescopes in Australia, overseas and who knows in orbit<br />
around the planet, to form vast sensors capable of receiving<br />
radio information from the absolute outer reaches of the<br />
universe helping us toward an understanding of our cosmic<br />
environment. I am told that the Compact Array has the capacity to read a<br />
telephone directory from a distance of 200 metres and when<br />
the Culgoora antennae are linked in with Siding Spring and<br />
Parkes, that telephone book will be legible from<br />
kilometres away!<br />
although using the Telescope for such a purpose would<br />
seem to be a rather wasteful modern day equivalent of<br />
using a sledge hammer to crack a walnut.<br />
1 24 </p>
<p>On the subject of orbitting telescopes, I recall that when I<br />
was in Moscow late last year I signed with General Secretary<br />
Gorbachev a number of agreements for future cooperation,<br />
including one on Scientific collaboration. Within the<br />
framework of that agreement, the Soviet Union has agreed to<br />
CSIRO providing part of the Soviet RADIOASTRON satellite, an<br />
orbiting radioastronomy satellite project with which a<br />
number of other Western countries are involved.<br />
These Culgoora antennae had to be mobile, so they have<br />
thirty five observation stations along a rail track. And to<br />
work properly, they had to be placed precisely and they<br />
are in fact placed on their stations with an accuracy of<br />
five millimetres.<br />
The 4,000 correlator micro-chips which combine the signals<br />
from the various dishes have to be capable of intensely<br />
accurate, speedy and frequent calculations. These chips can<br />
in fact perform one thousand million multiplica tion tasks<br />
per second which, as Barry Jones told Parliament this week,<br />
is even faster than the Treasurer can compute. And that's<br />
fast. The capability developed here has led on to the development<br />
and production of chips with major benefits for Australian<br />
companies in medical and defence industries.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
For all these reasons the Australia Telescope is a most<br />
appropriate achievement with which to celebrate our<br />
Bicentenary. It is a project whose benefits will be felt for many years<br />
into Australia's third century.<br />
I pay tribute to those many individuals those in CSIRO led<br />
by Dr Frater, those in academia and those in private<br />
industry whose hard work and vision has created this<br />
massive project, on time and within budget. I acknowledge<br />
with pride that a project such as this is one that only<br />
Governments can initiate and bring to completion, and I pay<br />
tribute to the previous Government for its decision in 1982,<br />
which we confirmed on coming to office in 1983, to go ahead<br />
with the Australia Telescope. In saying that I do not, in<br />
any way remove or minimise the burden of responsibility the<br />
Australian private sector must bear to engage in R and D<br />
work of its own.<br />
The discoveries that will flow from this Telescope are,<br />
literally, unimaginable. Researchers from all around the<br />
world will be able to probe the centre of the galaxy, the<br />
birth of stars in the Milky Way, the nature of supernovae<br />
and the Magellanic Clouds all of which are vital questions<br />
in astronomy and all of which can only be studied with<br />
precision from the Southern Hemisphere. .1' 72 5) T </p>
<p>It is with the confident expectation that this Telescope<br />
will speedily move to, and will long remain at, the<br />
forefront of world astronomical research, that I have<br />
pleasure in declaring the Australia Telescope open.<br />
