    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>7 JulyÂ 1986</strong></p>
<p>President Alfonsin of Argentina will make a working visit toÂ Australia onÂ 12-13 July. I will have talks with him in CanberraÂ on 12 July.</p>
<p>It will be the first visit to Australia by a Latin American HeadÂ of State. The President will be accompanied by Foreign MinisterÂ Caputo and Economy Minister Sourrouille.</p>
<p>I am particularly looking forward to this opportunity to meetÂ President Alfonsin. The President's efforts to consolidateÂ democracy, to redress past human rights abuses and to overcomeÂ complex and deep-seated economic problems have earned himÂ admiration and respect, both in Argentina and around the world.Â </p>
<p>Both Australia and Argentina have recently given increasedÂ attention to ieneed to liberalise international trade inÂ agricultural products. We have a common interest in opposingÂ subsidies and other measures which disrupt agricultural trade.<br />Australia and Argentina see this as a priority in the new roundÂ of multilateraZ trade negotiations which is likely to be launchedÂ at the MTN M.. nisterial Meeting in Uruguay in September. MyÂ discussions with President Alfonsin will enable our two countriesÂ to consider ways in which our approach to these important issuesÂ can be co-ordirzated more effectively.</p>
<p>Distance has in the past hindered the development of regularÂ contacts between Australia and Argentina. The President's visitÂ will provide an opportunity to develop the relationship.Â Argentina is gonerally regarded as a leader in the Non-AlignedÂ Movement. Its views on Central America, Antarctica, South Africa,Â disarmament andÂ other issues are of great interest to Australia.</p>
