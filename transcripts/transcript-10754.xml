<p>Well I'd like to, first of all, thank the people of Bennelong</p>
<p>   for returning me for the eleventh time. I've now represented</p>
<p>   this division, although the composition of it has changed quite</p>
<p>   a bit over the years, since 1974. And I want to thank the people</p>
<p>   of Bennelong for voting me back again and I promise to work very</p>
<p>   hard as a local member as well as Prime Minister over the next three</p>
<p>   years.</p>
<p>I'd like to thank the returning officer, Mr Lee, for the immaculately</p>
<p>   fair and highly efficient way in which the election was conducted.</p>
<p>   I would like to compliment the Australian Labor Party candidate</p>
<p>   on the tough campaign that she waged and acknowledge her presence</p>
<p>   here today. </p>
<p>There were a lot of candidates in Bennelong, including a One Nation</p>
<p>   candidate, including a Unity Party candidate and an Independent.</p>
<p>   And all of them directed their preferences against me, which is</p>
<p>   hardly surprising. Prime Ministers of whatever political persuasion</p>
<p>   are fair game for that sort of activity.</p>
<p>I want to take the opportunity, especially today, of thanking all</p>
<p>   of the members of my campaign team; Stephen Peoples, the Campaign</p>
<p>   Director, who's here today; to the members of my personal electorate</p>
<p>   staff, Kay Long, Jenny Stearn and Tim James and Anthony Roberts,</p>
<p>   all of whom did an absolutely superb job in keeping the Bennelong</p>
<p>   fires burning while I was racing around the country in the broader</p>
<p>   interests of the Liberal Party. It's very important that your</p>
<p>   home base be secured and I'm very grateful for the support</p>
<p>   that all of my friends and supporters in the Liberal Party, a number</p>
<p>   of whom are here today, have given me over the years.</p>
<p>Could I just say one or two more general things beyond what I've</p>
<p>   said about the local scene and that is that one of the interesting</p>
<p>   features of this election is that the primary vote of the Australian</p>
<p>   Labor Party, although there was a two-party preferred swing against</p>
<p>   the Coalition, the primary vote of the Australian Labor Party virtually</p>
<p>   didn't rise at all. And I think it can roughly be said of this</p>
<p>   election throughout the country that the One Nation Party took in</p>
<p>   the order of 7% to 9% away from the Coalition and handed at least</p>
<p>   half of that via its preferences to the Labor Party. And there's</p>
<p>   no doubt that One Nation did the Coalition a lot of damage and there's</p>
<p>   equally no doubt that the Coalition's decision to place One</p>
<p>   Nation last in political terms was more costly to it because it</p>
<p>   held far more marginal seats and the decision of the Labor Party</p>
<p>   to place One Nation last.</p>
<p>I don't regard the One Nation Party has being finished as</p>
<p>   a political force and it will be the responsibility of the Coalition</p>
<p>   as well as other parties who are similarly minded to work to retrieve</p>
<p>   the support of people who deserted it to vote One Nation at the</p>
<p>   last election. The great bulk of One Nation voters in 1998 were</p>
<p>   former Coalition supporters and therefore One Nation did far more</p>
<p>   damage to the Coalition than it did to the Australian Labor Party.</p>
<p>The other observation I would make is to repeat something that</p>
<p>   I said to my colleagues at the first Ministry meeting yesterday</p>
<p>   and that is being re-elected, in other words, getting a second term</p>
<p>   as a government and as a Prime Minister, gives one a much greater</p>
<p>   opportunity to re-make the political map of the country. After 13</p>
<p>   years of Labor one term is not enough to change things. Two terms</p>
<p>   gives you a much greater opportunity to do so. And I am very grateful</p>
<p>   and very proud that the people of Australia and the people of Bennelong</p>
<p>   have given me another opportunity as Prime Minister and therefore,</p>
<p>   through that opportunity, the chance in history of being the head</p>
<p>   of a government at the time of some momentous events in Australia's</p>
<p>   history including, most importantly, the Centenary of Federation.</p>
<p>We took a very bold and forward-looking tax reform plan to the</p>
<p>   Australian people. We defied conventional wisdom in doing so. We</p>
<p>   won that election and we will be pushing ahead in a quite determined</p>
<p>   fashion to get that package through the Parliament. We think we</p>
<p>   have a right, having put our political life on the line, to get</p>
<p>   that package accepted by the Australian people, we think we have</p>
<p>   a moral and political right to have it accepted by the Parliament.</p>
<p>   I don't know what else a political party can do other than</p>
<p>   to place itself before the people, risk its political future, its</p>
<p>   very survival as a government in order to get a reform endorsed.</p>
<p>   Having done that, I don't know what more a party can be expected</p>
<p>   to do in order to implement a reform package in which it devoutly</p>
<p>   believes.</p>
<p>I've believed in the cause of tax reform for a very long time.</p>
<p>   We took our courage in our hands. We took the risks. We won the</p>
<p>   majority of seats and we feel we are, by any criterion or any canon</p>
<p>   of fair judgement and behaviour, we believe we are entitled to have</p>
<p>   that plan accepted by the Australian Parliament and that is the</p>
<p>   attitude that we'll be taking to the Parliament when it reconvenes</p>
<p>   on the 10th of November.</p>
<p>QUESTION:</p>
<p>But Brian Harradine has a very different view to you. He says that</p>
<p>   no inquiry then basically you won't get the GST up as you want</p>
<p>   it.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we'll put it up and we'll just see what happens.</p>
<p>QUESTION:</p>
<p>His argument, though, is that the Senate should, you know, be the</p>
<p>   Senate that passes it because that's the Senate that was voted</p>
<p>   in on the GST issue.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It's very funny, Brian Harradine was elected in 1996 Â</p>
<p>   the term he's serving commenced, I'm sorry, in 1993 and</p>
<p>   in 1993 the then leader of the Australian Labor Party said that</p>
<p>   if the Liberal Party were elected on a platform of a GST, let it</p>
<p>   go through. And so was Senator Colston. Look, we can spend all day</p>
<p>   to-ing and fro-ing but nothing can alter the fact, is that we went</p>
<p>   to the election with a GST, we took our courage in our hands, we</p>
<p>   put our political bodies on the line and we won. And on that basis,</p>
<p>   if parliamentary democracy means anything, we're entitled to</p>
<p>   have the plan that we took to the Australian people put through</p>
<p>   and those who would frustrate that plan are really challenging the</p>
<p>   verdict of the Australian people.</p>
<p>QUESTION:</p>
<p>Do you think you can make a deal with him, Mr Harradine?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We'll be putting the plan up and I never talk about making</p>
<p>   deals with Senator Harradine. You never know until the last minute</p>
<p>   what Senator Harradine is going to do and that is his right. Senator</p>
<p>   Harradine is there as an Independent and he's got a perfect</p>
<p>   right to have an independent view. I have a lot of regard for Senator</p>
<p>   Harradine. He's certainly served the national interest far</p>
<p>   better on Wik than did the Labor Party or the Australian Democrats</p>
<p>   or the Australian Greens and I am glad that he defeated the Green</p>
<p>   candidate to win the last spot in the Senate from Tasmania.</p>
<p>QUESTION:</p>
<p>So would you go in one-on-one discussions with Senator Harradine</p>
<p>   in the same way you did over Wik?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I'm always happy to talk to Senator Harradine, let us put</p>
<p>   it that way.</p>
<p>QUESTION:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, you do face a more hostile Senate, though. I mean, what</p>
<p>   is the danger that if the Senate does reject your package that you'll</p>
<p>   seek a fresh mandate?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we've just got one. Let's not start talking about</p>
<p>   other ones, for heaven's sake. I think we're all a bit</p>
<p>   weary of elections.</p>
<p>QUESTION:</p>
<p>Well, what do you do, though, if there are major...?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I deal with things as they unfold. But I just want to make</p>
<p>   it very clear, as the Treasurer did yesterday, that having gone</p>
<p>   through the fire to get the Australian people to support this plan</p>
<p>   we're not going to just walk away from it because of a few</p>
<p>   utterances from people who, after all, lost the election.</p>
<p>QUESTION:</p>
<p>But isn't your best bet to strike a deal with Senator Harradine</p>
<p>   now and give...?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't intend to give a running political commentary.</p>
<p>QUESTION:</p>
<p>So are you disappointed that you didn't get a majority of</p>
<p>   votes in your own seat for the first time?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I didn't expect to because I only got 53% or 53.8% or</p>
<p>   2% of the primary vote in 1996. And I knew that once there was a</p>
<p>   One Nation candidate I wouldn't get a majority of the primary</p>
<p>   vote because One Nation essentially came straight off our pile and</p>
<p>   they got over 4%, it was inevitable.</p>
<p>QUESTION:</p>
<p>So would you like to make a comment about the Australian Cricket</p>
<p>   Team's result?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I certainly would. I'd like to congratulate Mark Taylor and</p>
<p>   the team on a really stunning performance. They've broken a</p>
<p>   39-year Australian cricket drought. It's the first team to</p>
<p>   win in Pakistan since Richie Benaud's team back in the 1960s.</p>
<p>   Mark Taylor has been an extraordinarily successful Australian Captain.</p>
<p>   He's won in Pakistan. He's won in the West Indies, and</p>
<p>   that broke a 20-year drought. And on a personal level he's</p>
<p>   repudiated, in the most convincing way imaginable, those people</p>
<p>   of which I'm very pleased to say I was not one who, a year</p>
<p>   or two ago, were saying that he was passed his peak. There were</p>
<p>   a lot of us who didn't believe he was passed his peak. There</p>
<p>   were a lot of us that retained a great deal of faith in him and</p>
<p>   he's vindicated that faith in a remarkably fighting and characteristic</p>
<p>   way. He's proved to be not only a tenacious captain but also</p>
<p>   a very modest captain. And I think he's reminded people that</p>
<p>   sport is more than just about winning and about money. He's</p>
<p>   reminded people that there are some traditions of sportsmanship,</p>
<p>   there is a respect for some of the traditions of the game. And his</p>
<p>   gesture in relation to his triple century and sharing that spot</p>
<p>   of Australian cricket immortality with Sir Donald Bradman was characteristic</p>
<p>   of the man and said a lot for the values that he brings to the game</p>
<p>   and is a reminder, particularly to young players, that sport is</p>
<p>   still about playing hard to win but also accepting that you don't</p>
<p>   always win and accepting that there are some values in the game</p>
<p>   that are just as important, indeed, more important than winning</p>
<p>   and more important than making a lot of money. But he's a champion</p>
<p>   batsman, a great captain and it's a terrific team, to think</p>
<p>   that we've achieved that without Shane Warne, think what we</p>
<p>   can do in the Ashes if we have Shane Warne. I can't wait.</p>
<p>QUESTION:</p>
<p>Now that you've won two elections would you rather be Prime</p>
<p>   Minister or Captain of the Australian Cricket Team?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh, it's all a bit academic I think. I think my chances of</p>
<p>   transferring at this stage in life are fairly academic but as you</p>
<p>   know I've always had a fondness for that other position. But</p>
<p>   fate did not ordain it to be so and I think Mark Taylor has done</p>
<p>   it well. But I can say one very, very emphatic thing, we both have</p>
<p>   a connection with Bennelong, I represent it and he lives here and</p>
<p>   he certainly is one of my more famous constituents.</p>
<p>QUESTION:</p>
<p>Sir, you mentioned the One Nation Party, what's your advice</p>
<p>   to New South Wales branch executive members of the National Party</p>
<p>   who are looking at preferencing that party in the upcoming State</p>
<p>   election?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't give gratuitous advice to State political executives.</p>
<p>   I'll leave it to them. That's a matter for the State Party</p>
<p>   to work out. The National Party's a separate party. The National</p>
<p>   Party decides its preferences. I don't intend to get into that.</p>
<p>   The Liberal Party, federally, put One Nation last in every seat</p>
<p>   and in the Senate. And it's fair to observe that had it not</p>
<p>   been for One Nation, the Democrats would not have won the sixth</p>
<p>   position in the Senate from New South Wales. Aden Ridgeway will</p>
<p>   take his place in the Senate, ironically enough, in the middle of</p>
<p>   next year by reason of One Nation having taken votes from the Coalition</p>
<p>   and then having, effectively, preferenced against the Coalition.</p>
<p>   So, once again, it's a reminder that the Coalition paid more</p>
<p>   dearly, in political terms, through preferencing One Nation last</p>
<p>   than did the Labor Party. Thank you.</p>
