Ireland Speech by the Prime Minister of Australia at a luncheon given in<br />
his honour by the Taoiseach of Ireland, Mr Liam Cosgrave, in<br />
Dublin on 23 December 1974<br />
I am no stranger to your extraordinary and<br />
beautiful country. This is my fourth visit to<br />
Ireland. Each time I return I take renewed<br />
pleasure from my contact with a country so<br />
close in history and spirit to my own, and whose<br />
valiant and poignant story has so stirred the<br />
imagination of the Australian people. I was last<br />
in Dublin as Leader of the Opposition in January<br />
1972. 1 am the first Australian Prime Minister to<br />
visit Ireland since Sir Robert Menzies was here<br />
in 1941. Another visit was long overdue.<br />
Before his sudden and untimely death I had anticipated<br />
a meeting with your late President, the<br />
distinguished Erskine Childers. With all Australians<br />
I regretted the passing of so notable an<br />
Irishman, whose appointment symbolised<br />
something of the breadth and magnanimity of<br />
the Irish character. I might say that the name<br />
Childers is well known in Australia. One of the<br />
late President's forbears, Hugh Childers, was<br />
the founder of the University of Melbourne and<br />
gave his name to the town of Childers in<br />
Queensland. I reiterate the condolences expressed<br />
by our Governor-General on behalf of<br />
the Australian Government and people to the<br />
late President's family and to the Government<br />
and people of Ireland.<br />
The Irish contribution to the settlement and<br />
development of Australia is a familiar story. We<br />
were the last major area of European colonisation,<br />
and a distinctive Irish element is well<br />
represented in the first wave of settlers to<br />
Australia. Irish migrants helped to expand Australian<br />
settlement outwards and inland beyond<br />
the narrow limits of the eastern and central seaboard.<br />
The development of colonial selfgovernment produced an unmistakable Irish<br />
influence in Australia's emerging political tradition.<br />
The major debates of the late nineteenth<br />
century-debates which canvassed issues of<br />
land tenure, education, the relations between<br />
Church and State and the relationship with Britain-<br />
rehearsed issues well known to the Irish<br />
immigrant and enabled him to give Australian<br />
political life a distinctively Irish flavour.<br />
Times have changed since the first Irish<br />
immigrants settled in Australia. Other European<br />
communities-Italians, Germans, Greeks,<br />
Yugoslavs-have made their contribution to<br />
Australian life. Modern Australia is a pluralist<br />
society. While we acknowledge our European<br />
origins, and remain in many ways the most Irish<br />
country outside Ireland, we are increasingly<br />
aware of our geographical and political destiny<br />
as part of the Asian and Pacific region.<br />
Australia and Ireland are parliamentary<br />
democracies with governmental, judicial and<br />
social institutions derived largely from common<br />
political traditions. The Australian High Court<br />
has had many able judges of Irish extraction-<br />
O'Connor, Higgins, McTiernan, Gavan Duffy.<br />
There are still strong cultural affinities between<br />
us. Yet our political and diplomatic contacts<br />
have not always been as active or as comprehensive<br />
as traditional associations might have<br />
led us to expect. In large part this has reflected<br />
simple considerations of geopolitics and<br />
differences in our major international interests.<br />
It has reflected the absence of serious problems<br />
or conflicts between us. One of the ironies of<br />
history is that conflict between nations is often<br />
productive of greater mutual understanding in<br />

<p>the longer term, while an established tradition<br />
of friendship yields all too easily to a comfortable<br />
and accepted pattern of relations which may be<br />
less adaptable to the challenges posed by<br />
changing times and fortunes.<br />
In a period when Australia is seeking to play an<br />
independent and increasingly active role in its<br />
own region in Asia and the Pacific, at a time<br />
when Ireland has perceived that her economic<br />
and political interests lie in a united Europe, it<br />
becomes more important to identify clearly the<br />
real community of interest between us. We are<br />
vulnerable, like all countries, to the threat of<br />
economic and social dislocation posed by inflation,<br />
rising unemployment and the spectre of<br />
recession. We share similar commitments in a<br />
wide range of international issues including<br />
basic human rights, the problems of economic<br />
development among the poorer nations, the<br />
need for an accepted regime to ensure balanced<br />
and proper methods of international maritime<br />
law. We are both concerned with internal questions<br />
of economic and social reform. We share a<br />
common interest in formulating policies which<br />
will guarantee an equitable local share in the<br />
development of our national resources.<br />
Perhaps most important, we realise that our<br />
relations will come to be increasingly defined in<br />
the context of the enlarged Europe of which<br />
Ireland is a member. Australia places considerable<br />
importance on its relations with the<br />
European Community. The new Community is<br />
Australia's largest export market after Japan<br />
and the largest source of our imports.<br />
It is responsible for some 40 per cent of the<br />
world's trade. It is developing new relationships<br />
with the trading nations outside Europe and<br />
Australia is one of the most important of these<br />
nations. Our commercial interests in Europe,<br />
once centred on the British market through the<br />
former preferential trading arrangements, have<br />
changed to a new relationship with the Community<br />
as a whole. Our mutual interests extend<br />
further than a simple commercial relationship.<br />
They include areas of international relations,<br />
finance and questions of energy and resources.<br />
It is against this background of common<br />
interests that we shall be holding periodic<br />
meetings between ourselves and the Commission<br />
of the Community to enable consultations on the broad range of our mutual<br />
interests. These consultations will permit both<br />
the Community and Australia to co-ordinate the<br />
various strands of our relations, ensuring that<br />
proper recognition is given by each to the full<br />
range of our interests.<br />
The new multi-lateral relationship which we see<br />
developing between ourselves and Europe<br />
should not usurp the tradition of bilateral relations<br />
between our two countries. It would be a<br />
pity if our historical association was<br />
overshadowed by the turn of events. With this<br />
in mind the Australian Government has decided<br />
to assist the University College, Dublin, to<br />
establish a Chair of Australian History. We will<br />
contribute $ 70,000 over the next five years<br />
We have already made considerable donations<br />
of books on Australian subjects to the college<br />
and we shall make further contributions in the<br />
future. I am confident that Australia and Ireland will<br />
develop a new kind of relationship within the<br />
the framework of Ireland's emerging multilateral<br />
interests. Our relationship will be as<br />
close, as special as before, but more relevant to<br />
contemporary needs. Ireland is one of the two<br />
English-speaking members of the Community<br />
with whom we share a common cultural and<br />
political heritage and powerful ties of sentiment<br />
and kinship. As such we hope Ireland may<br />
occupy a special position in the evolving relationship<br />
between Australia and the new Europe.<br />
I believe our relations will strengthen as we<br />
move closer to our natural destinies in our<br />
different regions of the world. </p>
