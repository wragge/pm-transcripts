FOR PRESS: PM No. 29/ 1071<br />
NEW ADMINISTRATIVE ARRAlIGEMENTS<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Ur. William McMaho.<br />
His Excellency the Governor-General in Council has today establihod<br />
two new Departments of State and abolished two existing Departments.<br />
The two new Departments are<br />
T'he Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet.<br />
T ae Departmenit of the Vice-President of the Executive Council.<br />
The Prime Minister's Department and the Department of the Cabinet Office hav,-.<br />
been abolished. The changes in departmental structure are designed to support the operation<br />
of the Cabinet system of government. As I have already said, I propose to develop<br />
this system to its full extent as to provide scope for the expression of its collective<br />
wisdom, and to use to the fullest extent the expert knowledge and experience within<br />
individual portfolios. The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet will be central to<br />
this process. It will be the task of the Department to provide the Secretary to Cabinet<br />
and to the Committees of Cabinet, and the associated Secretariat machinery, and to<br />
provide briefing to the Prime Minister in relation to matters involving him as<br />
Chairman of Cabinet and Head of Government. The Department will be responsible<br />
also for exchanging information with and maintaining close relations with Ministers<br />
and Departments as part of the co-ordinating process.<br />
Sir John Bunting, the present Secretary to Cabinet, has been appointed<br />
Secretary to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. He will continue<br />
as Secretary to Cabinet.<br />
The new Department of the Vice-President of the Executive Council will<br />
undertake a number of functions previously located in the Prime Minister's<br />
Department and in the Treasury. It will be responsible for a wide range of matters.<br />
A list of functions already approved is attached and the allocation to the Department<br />
of certain other functions is to be examined.<br />
The change will not involve the Executive Council itself, which is<br />
separate from and completely independent of the new Department. / 2 </p>
<p>2,<br />
The arrangements which have now been made will require re-allotment<br />
of staff. Sir John Bunting will be taking up this matter with the Chairman of the<br />
Public Service Board.<br />
I have been in touch with Sir Lenox Hewitt and have placed before him<br />
certain alternatives for his consideration.<br />
I want to pay high tribute to him for his service as Secretary of the<br />
Prime Minister's Department. He will, of course, retain his status as a senior<br />
level Permanent Head.<br />
