In my visit to Indonesia I am returning the visit to Australia<br />
earlier this year by President Soeharto. I believe our excnange of<br />
visits has given a powerful stimulus to the friendshio between Australia<br />
and Indonesia. And I think it is true to say that 1972 has been a year<br />
of enlightened co-operation between Australia and Indonesia. This is<br />
true in trade, in development, in our civil aid, in our cultural<br />
exchanges, and in our defence co-operation.<br />
Australia and Indonesia have quite different cultural, ethnic,<br />
geogra hic and religious backgrounds. If we can, as we have been able<br />
to, build bridges of co-operation and goodwill, then , e have set an<br />
examp~ le to other nations of ways in ,7hich to build a unique, intimate<br />
and mutually rewaarding relationship between nations. I want to build<br />
thes3e bridges to be strong and to last.<br />
In Djakarta yesterday morning, I met and exchanged gifts with<br />
the Governor of this axpanding and facinating city. Later I consulted<br />
in private with the President and this was followed by talks with his<br />
Senior 111inisters. Following these discussions I was able to touch on<br />
a number of important new initiatives during my official speech here last<br />
night. I was able to tell my Indonesian hosts that there would be a<br />
substantial increase in Australian civil aid to Indonesia over the next<br />
three years. I also announced, with the agreement of the Indonesian-<br />
Government, we had decided to establish here~ in Djakarta an Australian<br />
financed and conducted cultural and language centre. This centre is<br />
the natural development of the cultural agreement signed by Australia<br />
and Indonesia four years ago, an agreement which has led to a welcome<br />
increase in cultural contacts between us.<br />
I also spoke about the growing defence co-operation between<br />
Australia and Indonesia, I said that while neither country wanted a<br />
military pact or alliance of any kind, there was much we could do in<br />
a practical way by sharing our experience and knowledge. We are going<br />
to provide Indonesia with.. sabre jet fighters and the accompanyinq<br />
necessary equipment and flight training. We are also going to help<br />
substantially in equipping an immortant military airfield in Indonesia<br />
at which the sabres will be based. Indonesian airmen and technicians<br />
arrived in Australia to begin this training period just a few days ago.<br />
In another aspect of defencez co-oneration -e will be helping<br />
Indonesia to strengthen its coastal surveillance canabi lity. I took the<br />
opportunity in my speech last night to announce that my Government last<br />
week approved an increased financial provision for defence aid to<br />
Indonesia to enable this type of assistance to go ahead.<br />
Tomorrow I go to Singapore until Sunday, and then on to<br />
Malaysia before returning to Australia on 15th June. I will be<br />
reporting to you on my journey again next Wednesday. </p>
