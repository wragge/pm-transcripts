    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Australian Government understands that the work performed by members of the Australian Defence Force is unique and crucial to our nation and our security.</p>
<p>In recognition of these unique circumstances, the Government has decided to increase the wage offer for ADF personnel to two per cent per annum, over the life of the agreement, with effect from the next pay day.Â </p>
<p>This keeps ADF pay above the current annual inflation rate of 1.7 per cent.</p>
<p>In making todayâs decision the Government has listened to the concerns of the defence community.</p>
<p>The advocacy of Senator Linda Reynolds CSC and Mr Andrew Nikolic AM CSC MP, who both served in senior roles in the ADF, has been central.Â Â </p>
<p>The Government will ask the Chief of the Defence Force and the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service to seek the Defence Force Remuneration Tribunalâs agreement to vary the terms of the current Workplace Remuneration Agreement.</p>
<p>ADF personnel are trained and prepared to put their personal safety at risk in the interests of our nation and this should be recognised.</p>
<p>This decision provides certainty to ADF personnel and their families, who play such a significant role in supporting them.Â </p>
