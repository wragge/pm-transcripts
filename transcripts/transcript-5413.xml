4~ UTALIA<br />
FOR MEDIA FRIDAY AUGUST 8 1980<br />
ABORIGINES.-ADVANCEMENT LEAGUE<br />
( VICTORIA) APPEALLI _ RC' 4<br />
The Commonwealth Government will be contributing<br />
to an appeal by the Aborigines Advancement League ( Victoria)<br />
to provide funds for the erection of a new centre for the<br />
league in Northcote, Melbourne.<br />
The Commonwealth Government fully supports the objectives of<br />
the appeal which is being conducted by a committee of<br />
prominent Victorian citizens. Mr Ronald Walker, C. B. E.,<br />
is the appeal Chairman.<br />
The league was formed in 1958 and is the oldest and best<br />
known Victorian Aboriginal organisation. Since its establishment<br />
the league has worked towards the educational, social economic<br />
and political advancement of Aboriginal Australians.<br />
The new centre in Northcote will provide accommodation,<br />
counselling rooms, a library, workshop facilities, a display<br />
area and associated facilities.<br />
The appeal is worthy of generous support by all sections of<br />
the community. I hope the Commonwealth Government' s support<br />
will stimulate further contributions. </p>
