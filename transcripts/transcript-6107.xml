E. O. E. PROOF ONLY<br />
PARTIAL TRANSCRIPT OF SPEECH AT TEI* UiTLE BETH ISRAEL 8 MAY 1983<br />
It is appropriate that I should say to you at this first<br />
opportunity I have had of being with such a representative<br />
gathering of the Jewish community, to affirm to you the<br />
statement in unequivocal terms that the deference that my<br />
Government has to the integrity and security of the State of<br />
Israel. That the State of Israel is one<br />
in many ways for a long period of time the greatest commitinien:<br />
integrity remains in time the responsibility of the Government<br />
of this country. We recognise that not only is the well-being<br />
of the people of Israel involved in the maintenance of * the<br />
integrity and security of that State, but that indeed the very<br />
peace of the world is inextricably bound up with ensuring that<br />
we do secure a just and lasting peace in that area of the world.<br />
That, as we all know, is going to require adjustments and<br />
concessions on the part of others and we must all, as my<br />
Government will, pledge our best endeavours to ensuring that we<br />
do achieve in that coveted area of the world such a just,<br />
enduring, lasting peace within the central . Middle East..<br />
of the integrity of the State of Israel. That is, if you<br />
appreciate the very keen sense of the great difference, the<br />
great sacrifices that the people of your community face<br />
religiously within this country and internationally..<br />
deep understanding of what that has meant to all of you, what<br />
it has meant financially, what it has meant in terms of the<br />
other sorts of sacrifices that you have had to make throughout<br />
your lives and throughout the lives of those generations in your<br />
community that have gone before you, that I am very, very proud<br />
to be associated with your Labour Centre and particularly as it<br />
has so much emphasis on the needs of our young people because<br />
it is essential, I think, to Australia for a<br />
new understanding as we move now towards the end of this century,<br />
towards the outset of the 21st Century. It is imperative that<br />
we have, in the minds of our young people, a sense<br />
a commitment to* the day to day<br />
our society in so many ways is under pressure. Thlere is,<br />
in the minds of our young people<br />
and an understanding . in our sociezy<br />
It is important, therefore, that a community like your o-wn<br />
which has about the important basic principles<br />
necessary for a just and'good) s-ociety. All of you can<br />
play your part by concentrating on these young people to give<br />
them that same sense of understanding so that they will have a<br />
committal to the values that are so important. </p>
