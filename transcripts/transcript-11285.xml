    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Chairman of the Australian Republican Movement, Mr Malcolm Turnbull, should not, as he did on the<i> </i>"Today" Show<i> </i>this morning, distort or misrepresent what I have said about what would happen in the event of victory for the "No" case at the referendum.</p>
<p>On this morningâs programme, Mr Turnbull stated "â¦the Prime Minister has saidâ¦that a No vote ends the issue. The Prime Minister said very clearly yesterday â¦ that he doesnât foresee any future referendums (sic) on the republic".</p>
<p>I did not say this. What I said yesterday was that if the republican proposal were defeated I did not see the issue being quickly re-visited in another referendum. I used the expression "I cannot see the thing coming back in a hurry". (A partial transcript is attached).</p>
<p>That had a qualitatively different emphasis from what Mr Turnbull sought to portray in his remarks.</p>
<p>In his attempt to attract the support of direct election supporters to the "Yes" case, Mr Turnbull clearly sought to exaggerate my remarks.</p>
<p>My position is very clear. I believe that if the "Yes" vote wins there will not be a future vote on the option of a direct election for the presidency. I explained my reasons for this in my detailed statement.</p>
<p>My attitude about the consequences of a No vote is as outlined yesterday.</p>
<p>Mr Turnbull knows this. He should not seek to distort, for his own purposes, what I said.</p>
