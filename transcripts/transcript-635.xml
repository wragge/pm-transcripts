COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA.<br />
SPEECH BY<br />
Rt. Hon. SIR ROBERT MENZIES,<br />
M. P.,<br />
ON<br />
ROYAL AUSTRALIAN AIR FORCE.<br />
MINISTERIAL STATEMENT.<br />
[ From the Parliamentary Debates," 24th October, 1963.1<br />
Sir ROBERT MENZIES ( Kooyong-<br />
Prime Minister).-by leave-Mr. Speaker,<br />
on 22nd May of this year, I made a comprehensive<br />
announcement about a review<br />
of Australian defence, of the defence programme<br />
and of defence expenditure. I<br />
remind the House that that was a time<br />
before any announcement had been made<br />
about an election and before panic had<br />
broken out on the benches opposite. The<br />
decisions that I then announced involved<br />
an average increase in the defence vote,<br />
over a period of five years, of the order<br />
of Å“ 41,000,000 a year. At the same time,<br />
though I stated the nature of the extended<br />
Mirage fighter procurement, which will give<br />
our fighter forces unsurpassed strength, I<br />
pointed out that neither the programme nor<br />
the figures included any re-equipment of<br />
the strike-reconnaissance force. I quote<br />
what I went on to say, because I think it<br />
is important that this be kept in mind. I<br />
remind the House that it was said on 22nd<br />
May. I went on to say-<br />
This is an important matter. The Canberra<br />
is by no means obsolete...<br />
I wonder whether I may interrupt myself at<br />
that point, Sir, to say that to-day I have<br />
10857/ 63. observed that the Leader of the Opposition<br />
( Mr. Galwell), who goes into print on these<br />
matters so hastily, has had his views published<br />
in a not-always-reliable newspaper. I<br />
want to quote from this report, but I do<br />
not vouch for the accuracy of it. Oh dear,<br />
no! I quote it for what it is worth, for it<br />
records the Leader of the Opposition as<br />
having said-<br />
One thing is certain. The Government could<br />
not have gone into the election campaign without<br />
having at least some plausible story to show<br />
that it was at least-<br />
Perhaps last was meanttrying<br />
to replace the Canberra which has been<br />
obsolescent since 1949.<br />
1 am always willing to concede the chances<br />
of error in that journal.<br />
Mr. L. R. Johnson.-What journal is it?<br />
Sir ROBERT MENZIES.-The Sydney<br />
" Daily Mirror<br />
Mr. L. R. Johnson.-The Daily<br />
Mirror Sir ROBERT MENZ~ IES.-Yes-your<br />
official organ. I am always prepared to<br />
concede the possibility and, indeed, the </p>
<p>probability, of error in that journal. I<br />
take leave to point out to the House that,<br />
so far from the Canberra being obsolescent<br />
in 1949, not until early in 1951 was I<br />
invited to go to an aerodrome in England<br />
to name this new aircraft " Canberra" and<br />
to see it taken up by the test pilot<br />
on a demonstration flight. Therefore,<br />
long before it was born, it appears<br />
to have been obsolescent. This introduces<br />
a new problem into obstetrics.<br />
With that human aside, I go on to quote<br />
what I said in May-<br />
This is an important matter. The Canberra is<br />
by no means obsolete; it is still being used by<br />
overseas air forces, including those of Nato. But<br />
we are giving close consideration to the future<br />
as we must. There are, of course, great financial<br />
problems, but there are vital questions as to the<br />
availability of suitable types to meet our requirements.<br />
Having regard to our special geographic<br />
circumstances, we must consider range, the<br />
capacity to perform both reconnaissance and<br />
attack and the ability to use existing runways and<br />
services. An on-the-spot evaluation by a team of<br />
qualified experts is necessary, as it was in the<br />
selection of the Mirage. Such a team will be<br />
sent overseas at an early date, under the Chief<br />
of the Air Staff to investigate and report. Then,<br />
of course, the Government will consider the matter<br />
further in the light of the report.<br />
We sent the evaluation team overseas and in<br />
due course received its report. It was clear<br />
that, subject to problems of the time-table<br />
and of payment and of interim provision to<br />
supplement if necessary the Canberra force,<br />
the evaluation team regarded what was then<br />
called the TFX in the United States as the<br />
most modern and complete answer to our<br />
requirements. I then decided to ask the Minister for<br />
Defence ( Mr. Townley) to undertake the<br />
very onerous task of going to the United<br />
States to examine these problems more<br />
closely on a government level. He had, of<br />
course, one further objective. He was not<br />
to discuss aircraft in isolation from, strategic<br />
needs and priorities, but he was to have<br />
close political consultation with the United<br />
States Administration on those very matters.<br />
It is very easy, if I may say so to the Leader<br />
of the Opposition, to say, " We will procure<br />
a Canberra replacement as if all<br />
we had to do was to go, so to speak, to<br />
the shop and buy it over the counter.<br />
Honorable members will realize that this<br />
is not the position to-day. Both of the two<br />
most recently designed reconnaissance<br />
bombers, the TSR-2 in England and the TFX<br />
in the United States, are still in the developmental stage. It will of necessity be some<br />
time before they become available. The<br />
cost of such modern instruments of war is,<br />
of course, enormous, although the cost tends<br />
to come down if very large orders are<br />
placed. The Minister for Defence has the great<br />
advantage of being on very close and<br />
friendly terms with the American defence<br />
administration. My colleagues and I felt<br />
that he would have a reasonable prospect<br />
of fruitful discussion. I am happy to tell<br />
the House that his mission has been most<br />
remarkably successful; so successful that I<br />
have found it necessary to advise the United<br />
Kingdom Government that we propose to<br />
go ahead with the arrangement he has<br />
negotiated. Before going on to state the substance of<br />
the arrangement that my colleague has<br />
made in Washington, I would like to say<br />
that I have observed some inspired statements<br />
in one or two newspapers to the<br />
effect that our discussions in the United<br />
States were either accelerated or affected by<br />
some statement made in this House by the<br />
Leader of the Opposition. I did not have<br />
the goad fortune to hear it. The answer to<br />
this is that we had our first full and<br />
promising report from the Minister for<br />
Defence before the Leader of the Opposition<br />
spoke at all. Having received it and<br />
studied it, we were attracted by it, but we<br />
sent one or two inquiries to him so that<br />
he might clear up a few outstanding points.<br />
This he has done, with the result that I will<br />
in a few moments announce it to the House.<br />
The whole business of re-equipping the<br />
Air Force is extremely complex. It cannot<br />
be solved by a few rhetorical phrases. It<br />
has in the present case required most<br />
exhaustive technical investigations by our<br />
highest technical advisers and this rather<br />
remarkable negotiation which has been conducted<br />
by the Minister himself in the<br />
United States.<br />
In the result, the defence programme I<br />
announced, which represented a large<br />
increase, will be very substantially added<br />
to. But the arrangements made by my<br />
colleague will unquestionably result in a<br />
very substantial saving to Australia, as<br />
against the. original estimates of TFX costs<br />
as formulated when the evaluation mission<br />
made its inquiries. To this must be added </p>
<p>the other practical defence advantages<br />
which will appear.<br />
I will now state in agreed language the<br />
nature of the arrangements that have been<br />
made. In pursuance of the Government's<br />
policy of improving Australia's defence preparations,<br />
the Minister for Defence has<br />
been in Washington discussing with Mr.<br />
McNamara, the United States Secretary of<br />
Defence, the re-equipment of Australia's<br />
bomber squadrons, together with other<br />
defence matters of mutual interest. As a<br />
result of these negotiations, the following<br />
most favorable arrangements have been<br />
made with the United States: The Government<br />
of Australia has agreed to purchase<br />
from the United States two squadrons of<br />
F-I IIA aircraft, which used to be called the<br />
TEX. By special arrangements with the<br />
United States of America, the aircraft will<br />
be available to Australia at the same time<br />
as delivetties are made to the United States<br />
armed forces, which will be from 1967<br />
onwards. I emphasize that date because of<br />
rumours that made it a couple of years<br />
later. Financial arrangements are entirely<br />
satisfactory to Australia.<br />
In a most favorable package deal, if I<br />
may use that phrase, the United States has<br />
agreed to supply the aircraft on the basis<br />
of a purchase price that includes one year's<br />
initial spare parts including engines, ground<br />
handling equipment, training aids, and the<br />
initial and operational training of crews,<br />
which would be carried out in the United<br />
States. A further important and valuable consideration<br />
is that the United States has<br />
agreed to integration of the Royal Australian<br />
Air Force and the United States armed<br />
forces logistic pattern so that Australia will<br />
be able to draw future requirements of<br />
spare parts and equipment from American<br />
stocks and therefore secure the advantage<br />
of much lower prices than would be the<br />
case if Australia itself had to procure<br />
independently the full range of stores.<br />
The financial arrangements for the purchase<br />
of the F-il11A aircraft enables Australia<br />
to spread its payments to suit its own<br />
budgetary requirements over a period of<br />
years. As Australia will commence progress<br />
payments immediately, a special and<br />
important part of the deal is that Australia's<br />
payments will attract interest from the United States until such time as payments<br />
are in fact made to the United States contractors<br />
for the aircraft. The F-il lA aircraft<br />
will now be available to Australia at<br />
least two years earlier than had previously<br />
been thought possible. At the same time,<br />
in case the years between now and 1967<br />
were to see a deterioration in the international<br />
situation, the Government has been<br />
concerned that Australia should have, if<br />
necessary, some additional long range strike<br />
and reconnaissance capacity in the R. A. A. F.<br />
over the intervening years.<br />
Arrangements have now been made to<br />
ensure that there will be suitable strike<br />
reconnaissance aircraft available to the<br />
R. A. A. F. until the F-i111A comes into<br />
operational service. Agreement has been<br />
reached with the United States that up to<br />
two squadrons of B47E aircraft will be<br />
made available to Australia with no leasing<br />
charge to the Australian Government. Australian<br />
personnel will be trained by the<br />
United States Air Force on the basis of<br />
reimbursement for actual costs, and ground<br />
handling equipment and logistic support<br />
provided at satisfactory prices.<br />
Performance details of the F-il11A are<br />
classified-that is, they are not available for<br />
general consumption-but it can be said<br />
that it is a two-man bomber which can fly<br />
at two and a half times the speed of sound<br />
and well above supersonic speed at sea level.<br />
It can take off and land from short and, if<br />
necessary, rough airfields. It can fly to any<br />
place on earth within 24 hours.<br />
The F-il11A programme embarked upon<br />
by the United States is the largest programme,<br />
both in numbers and in cost, of<br />
any aircraft since World War II. It is, in<br />
other words, the last word. Twenty-two<br />
prototype and development aircraft are<br />
scheduled for delivery to the United States<br />
in 1965 and we are told -that we will secure<br />
our first deliveries in 1967.<br />
The B47E is now used in the Strategic<br />
Air Command of the United States and will<br />
be in squadron service, particularly in this<br />
part of the world, for some years. It has<br />
proved a most versatile and effective aircraft<br />
in operational service to date. Its full<br />
operational capability is still partly classified<br />
that is to say, partly not for general publication-<br />
but it has a sub-sonic speed of </p>
<p>over 600 miles an hour and a ceiling of over<br />
40,000 feet. It is also particularly effective<br />
at low level. This is important. It is a<br />
six-engine aircraft with a range of over<br />
3,000 miles and a capacity to carry over<br />
20,000 lb. of conventional bombs. It is<br />
equipped for air-to-air refuelling.<br />
Putting all controversy on one side, I am<br />
sure that all honorable members will agree not only that my colleague's mission reflects<br />
credit on himself but also -that its success is<br />
an indication of the genuine goodwill which<br />
the United States has towards our country<br />
and of the high opinion which the United<br />
States Government has of the capacity of<br />
the Australian armed forces and of the<br />
reliability and importance of Australia as a<br />
nation and law in this area of the world.<br />
