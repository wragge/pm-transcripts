FOR PRESS DE<br />
2 2 IAR 1968<br />
LBR PM; No. 32/ 1963<br />
VISIT BY THE EMFP CR OF ETHIOPA<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr John Gorton<br />
It has been announced in Addis Ababa today that His Imperial<br />
Majesty Haile Selassie of Ethiopia will include a visit to Australia as part<br />
of a journey which he is soon to make to a number of overseas countries.<br />
The visit is expected to take place about the middle of May and<br />
to last about 4 days.<br />
I am sure that all Australians will warmly welcome the<br />
prospect of a visit by such a distinguished Head of State.<br />
Consultations will now take place to prepare, in draft form,<br />
a programme of engagements for those days when the Emperor is here,<br />
and an announcement of these details will be made after the proposals have<br />
been put to him and accepted,<br />
CANBERRA, March, 1968 </p>
