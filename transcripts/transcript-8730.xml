STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE IION PJ. KEATING MP<br />
PRIME MINISTER WELCOMES MASSIVE NEW MINING INVEST'MENT<br />
Today's decision byMount Isa Mines Ltd ( MIM) and its four Japanese joint venture<br />
partncrs to proceed with the huge McArthur River zinc/ lcad/ silvcr mine in the Northern<br />
Territory has becn welcomed by the Prime Minister, Mr Keating.<br />
The announcement followed the decision of the four Japanese joint venture partners,<br />
np0n Mining and Metals Co Ltd, Mitsui and Co, Mitsubishi Materials Corp and<br />
Marubcni, toexcrcisc their options to participate in the project.<br />
In welcoming the announccment, Mr Keating described the project as a milestone for the<br />
new projcct facilitation arrangements announced in February's One Nation Statement.<br />
MIM had approached the Federal Govenment the day after One Nation through Mr<br />
Keating's Parliamentary Secretary, Mr Laurie Brereton, seeking facilitation and as a result<br />
had received all Federal Government approvals in six months.<br />
The project has also benefited from the One Nation Development Allowance and $ 5.8<br />
million in Commonwealth road funding to upgrade the Carpenter Highway and build a<br />
bypass around the nearby aboriginal community of Borroloola.<br />
" It is pleasing to see that in MIM's own announcement the role of both the<br />
Commonwealth and Northern Territory Government's in bringing the project to fruition<br />
has been acknowledged," Mr Keating said.<br />
" From the outset both governments have worked efficiently and harmoniously to a tight<br />
corporate time frame so that the deposit, first discovered in 1955, could take advantage of<br />
a window of opportunity in the 1990s."<br />

" Thanks to this sense of purpose and co-operation between both government and business<br />
a project worth directly and indirectly 1000 jobs and $ 200 million a year in export income<br />
to Australia will go ahead," Mr Kcating said.<br />
" in a difficult world economic climate, to have such a large investment involving four<br />
Japanese mining giants announced, is a significant vote of confidence in Australia, a vote<br />
of confidence from a trading partner with whom our relationship continues to prosper."<br />
" It is a thumbs up to the new government approvals regime which was put in place by One<br />
Nation, a regime which has been welcomed by both thc private sector and State and<br />
Territory Govcrnmients," Mr Keating said.<br />
" What makes this project particularly exciting is its multiplier and infrastructure effects<br />
which can hclp open a remote corner of Australia, said to be one of the richest prospecting<br />
zones in the world."<br />
" T'he impetus on McArthur River could now unleash a wave of investment in nearby<br />
zinc/ lead deposits that will set the Gulf region provide major exports for Australia."<br />
" This arca could prove another Pilbara in the making which is why this Government, a<br />
L-abor Government committed to big job creating projects, has been so keen to givc the<br />
McArthur River Project priority attention", Mr Keating said.<br />
In receiving facilitation support through the Major Projects Facilitation Unit ( MPFU),<br />
administered by Mr BTrccton on behalf of the Prime Minister, McArthur River is one of<br />
the seven projects worth a combined total of $ 3.7 billion which are now under<br />
considcration. Facilitation has built on the Intergovernmental Agreement on the Environment and<br />
involved joint Comnmonwealth and Territory environmental asscssments and agreed time<br />
framcs for Governmecnt approvals coordinated by the MPFU.<br />
in the casc of McArthur River it has also involved a number of consultations between Mr<br />
Brereton, the Membcr for thc Northern Territory, Warren Snowden, and the nearby local<br />
Aboriginal community of Boi-roloola. As a result of these consultations an Aboriginal<br />
cmploynment and training strategy for the community is being put in place, environmental<br />
safeguards havc been strengthened and a bypass is to be built around the township<br />
following safety concerns about the movement of large ore trucks though the centre of<br />
Borroloola. CAINBERRA 16 November, 1992 </p>
