ROYAL AUSTRALASIAN COLLEGE OF SURGEONS,<br />
MELBOURNIE LAYING OF FOUNDATION STONE,<br />
6TH MARCH, 1964+<br />
Speech by the Pri~ me Minister, the Rt. Hon, Sir Robert Menzi&amp; es<br />
Mr. President, My Lord, My Lord Mayor and Ladies and Gentlemen:<br />
I put a prudent question to the President just now,<br />
I said: " Do I lay this stone first and speak afterwards?" and<br />
he said: " Speak first". And I hope if I forget to lay this stone,<br />
he will remind me.<br />
As a matter of fact, you know, I am a masquerader on<br />
an occasion of this kind, Here I am all done up as a surgeon.<br />
Two days ago I took out three Members of Parliament and had them<br />
sworn as Ministers and I didn't know which of my many ties I ought<br />
to wear on that occasion but I found that the one which was the<br />
cleanest and most presentable was the tie of the Royal College of<br />
Gynaecologists and Obstetricians ( Laughter) and I am very distinguished<br />
in that field. So I put on that tie and the Governor-<br />
General who doesn't miss much, had a look at me afterwards and<br />
said, " What tie is that you are wearing?" I said, " Sir, I am a<br />
gynaecologist and obstetrician ( Laughter) and nobody ought to know<br />
it better than you do because I hove just given birth to three new<br />
Ministers" ( Laughter)<br />
I am also a physician, I am an architect though sadly<br />
out of date in my architectural views. In fact there are very few<br />
things that you can name that I am not one of them in a fraudulent<br />
sense; when they mean there is no merit in this matter they<br />
always say causa honoris and, causa honoris, I am a most versatile<br />
character, but in reality I know nothing about these things. But<br />
I do know that when I read through the story of this College,<br />
beginning as recently as 1926, I found this the most exciting story',<br />
I think, that any Australian could read. A wonderful story, This<br />
country has for many, many years enjoyed a world reputation in the<br />
field of surgery, but it was only as recently as 1926 that this<br />
College was established, later to become the Royal Australasian<br />
College of Surgeons, now holding its hood up in any company in the<br />
world, now with its fellowships, honoured and respected and valued<br />
all over the world. This is a wonderful story to be able to tell<br />
after thirtyseven or thirtycight years, and it marks two things, one<br />
of them being the enormous development of surgery in the modern<br />
world. Occasionally in an idle moment I have a look at Sam<br />
Pepyst diary or one of those earnest recorAs or not so earnest<br />
records about the tail end of the seventeenth century and there<br />
are one or two descriptions of operations. It couldn't have been<br />
much fun, I think, for the patient in those days before annesthetics,<br />
before antiseptic or aseptic surgery. Not much fun, except for<br />
one thing and that was that to induce a species of anaesthesia<br />
in the patient, liberal applications of grog were made and so the<br />
patient, in a state of affairs that would never recommend itself<br />
to any modern temperance body, became almost unconscious to the<br />
villainies that were being perpetrated on him. Well, that's of<br />
course before your time and before my time.<br />
All I know is that probably in the lost fifty, Sixty,<br />
seventy years the developments in the art and science of surgery<br />
in the world have been phenomenal, Indeed it is worthwhile people<br />
recalling occasionally that although we do manage to destroy life<br />
on a very great scale in the modern world, you surgeons have </p>
<p>El -2<br />
managed to preserve life to sustain life to the most astonishing<br />
degree, and all this is due to learning, constant-. study, a constant<br />
willingness to learn new techniques and a devotion to the task<br />
which excludes, I an perfectly certain, at the time of operation,<br />
all other considerations,<br />
I don't mind saying to you as a man with two professionsthe<br />
profession of the law and the profession of politics that I<br />
envy you the profession that you pursue. This is, in the highest<br />
sense of the world, a constructive occupation. But if people had<br />
not founded this College, if they had not taken steps to encourage<br />
post-graduate work, further work, expert lectures, expert experimentation<br />
and teaching and thought surgery would have tended to<br />
stand still except for what might read in the documents<br />
proceeding from some other countries. The great thing about this<br />
ollege, the marvellous thing I think about it every time I<br />
drive past it when I come into Melbourne is that it represents<br />
the consciousness in practical terms of the need constantly to<br />
learn more, to know more at the end of one day than one knew at<br />
the end of the previous day, to be willing to learn to be willing<br />
to be bold, There is a lot of courage, I always think, required in<br />
the art of the surgeon. A man who is timid, a man who says, " No,<br />
IVll play safe," might get by, but he will never add to the sum of<br />
surgical knowledge. Many lives that would have been lost if every<br />
surgeon had played safe, have been rescued because many decided that<br />
courage should be added to skill and that between the two of them,<br />
wonderful results might be attained.<br />
And so it is not merely a matter of recalling what has<br />
happened in the field of surgery on the world scene today is an<br />
opportunity to recall with pride what has happened in this part of<br />
the world in Australia and in New Zealand, to recall the great<br />
men, the Imaginative men who established the College, and the<br />
couple of generations of people who understood that they must go<br />
on and on and learn to become more and more competent, not simply<br />
because this would be of some advantage to them. Wie all have some<br />
advantages from whatever we do in a material sense, but the driving<br />
force in this College has been the widening of the boundaries of<br />
knowledge the raising of the standards of surgical skill, the<br />
benefit of' the people as a whole.<br />
And that is why, in whatever capacity I may masquerade<br />
myself today7 I would like to say before I lay the foundation stone<br />
that as a Prime Minister who as has just been said, performed a<br />
successful operation not very long ago, as a Prime Minister who has<br />
been saddled with the responsibilities of Government in this<br />
country for a long, long time, I would think myself rather odd if<br />
I didni't so that while occasionally in my simple vanity I may be<br />
tempted to Think that I have done something useful or something<br />
good, today I am perfectly certain that I am addressing, particularly<br />
in the professional sense here today, men who, for themselves and<br />
for those who come after them are doing work about which nobody<br />
can argue. This is constructive work, not as well known as the<br />
work of people who are in the headlines but very frequently<br />
immeasurably more important. And so, as the Head of the Government,<br />
I say how grateful I am to you, Sir, for having invited me to come<br />
here, how proud I am to have the opportunity of being associated<br />
with this great development and how confident I am that just as you<br />
now look back on fairly modest beginnings, and I admit that price<br />
of Å“ E13,000 made me a little green with envy ( I don't think we will<br />
be able to build a new Parliament House with that) but just as you<br />
look back on these modest beginnings, so your sons and grandsons<br />
will look back on this with all its extensions as a modest beginning<br />
because year after year, generation after generation, this work will<br />
go on. I thank you, I congr~ atulate you and I will now go across and<br />
hope when I pull the right string or handle the right instrument<br />
I ought to have a ward sister with me, I think that I may declare<br />
the stone well and truly laid. </p>
