PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 24 JANUARY 1986<br />
The British official gift to Australia for the Bicentenary will<br />
be a specially commissioned sail training ship.<br />
The ship will be sailed to Australia by a joint crew of young<br />
Britons and Australians to participate in the Tall Ships Event in<br />
1988 and will then be handed over to Australia.<br />
The British Prime Minister, Mrs Thatcher, has written offering<br />
the ship to Australia and I will be writing to thank her for the<br />
British Government's offer.<br />
The ship is a significant gesture by the Government and people of<br />
the United Kingdom towards Australia's Bicentennial Year and is a<br />
most appropriate tribute to the longstanding relationship between<br />
Australia and the United Kingdom.<br />
This gesture is one of many aspects of British participation in<br />
the events of 1988 in Australia, which were being co-ordinated by<br />
the Britain-Australia Bicentennial Committee.<br />
The Government will give early consideration to how the gift can<br />
be utilised in support of its Priority One commitment to young<br />
Australians in the years ahead.<br />
The British gift of a vessel will, over the years, offer many<br />
young Australians a unique opportunity for the personal<br />
development which sail training offers. </p>
