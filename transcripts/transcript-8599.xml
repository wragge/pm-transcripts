STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
VIETNAM-VERTERANS MEMORIAL DEDICATION ATTENDANCE BY<br />
NEXT-OF-KIN<br />
JULY 1992<br />
I am pleased to announce today that the Government will<br />
assist in helping next-of-kin of those who died in<br />
Vietnam to travel to Canberra for the dedication of the<br />
Vietnam Veterans Memorial in October.<br />
The Government will contribute the cost of a return air<br />
fare to one next-of-kin of each of the 504 men and women<br />
who died in Vietnam during the War.<br />
The Government has strongly supported the building of a<br />
Vietnam Veterans' Memorial. We have contributed $ 250,000<br />
towards the cost, and provided administrative support and<br />
accommodation in Canberra for the organising Committee.<br />
However, we are seeking now to make a more personal<br />
contribution. The Memorial is dedicated to all those who<br />
served, suffered and died during the Vietnam War. There<br />
is no doubt, though, that its dedication will have a<br />
special significance for those who lost a family member<br />
during the War.<br />
The offer is limited to next-of-kin because they have<br />
suffered more than most through the loss of their loved<br />
ones. The Vietnam War was traumatic for Australia and<br />
those who lost next-of-kin suffered doubly.<br />
I observed the emotion of the Welcome Home Parade in 1987<br />
and the entombment ceremony early in July. I want now to<br />
ensure that at least one family member of the 504 who did<br />
not return home has the opportunity to attend the<br />
Memorial dedication perhaps the final symbolic welcome<br />
home." 833 </p>
<p>Details are as follows:<br />
The offer covers travel to and from Canberra for the<br />
Weekend of the Vietnam Veterans' Memorial<br />
Dedication, but neither accommodation nor movements<br />
in Canberra over the weekend will be covered.<br />
Where airtravel would be the most appropriate form<br />
of transport, the Commonwealth will provide economy<br />
travel from the airport nearest the next-of-kins<br />
home to Canberra and return, or, alternatively the<br />
equivalent of the Commonwealth negotiated fare will<br />
be given to the next-of-kin on the basis that the<br />
money will be spent on travelling to and from the<br />
dedication. the offer applies, in the first instance, to those<br />
people originally nominated as next-of-kin. Where<br />
this person is unable to accept the offer, the<br />
family of the next-of-kin will be asked to nominate<br />
a replacement.<br />
Next-of-kin who wish to accept the Government's<br />
offer of travel assistance should contact Department<br />
of Veterans' Affairs on 06-289 6541, before 18<br />
September.<br />
