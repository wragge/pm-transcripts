JOINT STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J<br />
KEATING MP, AND THE MINISTER FOR PRIMARY INDUSTRIES<br />
AND ENERGY, SENATOR THE HON BOB COLLINS<br />
ADDITIONAL DROUGHT RELIEF.<br />
Federal Cabinet has agreed to introduce a further significant package of measures to assist<br />
drought affected farmers.<br />
This package, which is costed at more than $ 112 million over the next four years,<br />
complements the $ 164 milon assistance package announced by the Government in<br />
September and provides generous incentives for farmers to plan and prepare for future<br />
drought.<br />
The package announced in September was aimed at providing immediate welfare assistance<br />
and farm business support to those suffering drought " exceptional circumstances". That<br />
assistance will continue to be available and will be extendded automatically to other areas<br />
should they be declared by the Commonwealth to be in " exceptional circumstances". This<br />
latest package has a longer term focus and aims to encourage all farmers to better plan and<br />
prepare for drought.<br />
Drought is a recurring feature of the Australian environment, and while short term relief is<br />
needed to ensure that those farm families suffering severe hardship in exceptional drought<br />
areas are not left behind, sound risk-management planning and preparation is the key to long<br />
term profitable and sustainable farming".<br />
An enhanced Farm Management Bonds Scheme and an investment allowance for fodder and<br />
water storage for livestock, water conveyancing and minimum tillage equipment, will<br />
encourage farmers to adopt a self-reliant approach to drought consistent with the National<br />
Drought Policy.<br />
Protecting the natural resource base and the environment during drought is also a priority of<br />
the package. Better links between labour market programs and local landcare groups and<br />
additional funding for on-ground project costs amounting to $ 14.4 million over two years<br />
will enable priority natural resource management works and measures to be undertaken in<br />
drought affected areas. </p>
<p>The package approved by Federal Cabinet comprises:<br />
An enhanced Farm Management Bond Scheme to encourage farmers to build cash<br />
reserves for downturns such as drought. The scheme provides for tax deductibility in<br />
the year of deposit, and includes an investment component raised from 80 per cent to<br />
100 per cent, no withholding tax paid on withdrawal and an increase in the deposit<br />
limit from $ 80 000 to $ 150 000 per taxpayer.<br />
Taxation incentives for building up physical reserves for drought. An investment<br />
allowance of 10 per cent for expenditures of up to $ 50 000 per taxpayer per annum, on<br />
fodder and water storage for livestock, water conveyancing and minimum tillage<br />
equipment will be provided until 2000.<br />
Provision of an additional 10 million over two years for adjustment in drought prone<br />
regions. Regional strategies will involve property restructuring and productivity<br />
enhancement and will thereby enable better drought preparedness and recovery from<br />
the current drought. The program will utilise the Rural Adjustment Scheme and<br />
Commonwealth and State Government social welfare, labour market programs and the<br />
National Landcare Program.<br />
Strengthened arrangements to encourage local communities in drought areas to develop<br />
landcare projects with labour input assisted by Commonwealth labour market<br />
programs. Eligibility conditions for the JobSkills and JobStart programs have been<br />
eased for farmers, farm family members and farmn hands in drought exceptional<br />
circumstances areas.<br />
Funding of $ 14.4 million over two years to the National Landcare Program for<br />
landcare projects in drought areas to prevent resource and environmental degradation.<br />
This will provide additional assistance for on-ground project costs.<br />
Removal of the restriction on farmers who are receiving job search allowance from<br />
eligibility for the RAS re-establishment grant.<br />
Additional funds of $ 5 million over three years for continuing research into climate<br />
forecasting and drought management techniques to assist farmers better prepare for<br />
drought. million over two years for extension of the grant period for farm household<br />
support recipients in the western division and central west of New South Wales.<br />
Extension of exceptional circumstances declaration to Tasmania and additional areas of<br />
New South Wales.<br />
