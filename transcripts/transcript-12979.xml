<p>Well Mr President, thank you very much for your very warm welcome. You came to Australia in 1997. There is a very good link between our countries at a parliamentary level as well as at a Government level, but most importantly there is a very strong link people to people, which is very very important. </p>
<p>Your remarks about the assistance that Australia sent to Greece during World War II are very deeply appreciated. There are some six or seven hundred thousand Australians at least who claim a Greek heritage and the contribution of those people to the building of modern Australia has been quite remarkable and is very widely appreciated and admired within the rest of the Australian community.</p>
<p>I';ve had a very good discussion with your Prime Minister, a very lengthy discussion. I have seen your President again and meeting you today gives a very important parliamentary dimension, which I appreciate very much and I really thank you for it.</p>
<p>[Ends] </p>
