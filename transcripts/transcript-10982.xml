  SUBJECTS: Millennium forum launch, PM's visit to East Timor, Timor levy,</p>
<p>   privacy issues; illegal immigrants; time zones; sporting achievements.</p>
<p>  MILLER:</p>
<p>  Joining us live on the line now from our Sydney Studio we have the Prime</p>
<p>   Minister, Mr John Howard. Prime Minister, good morning.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Hello John, good to be with you.</p>
<p>  MILLER:</p>
<p>  Good to have you here too. Congratulations on a significant occasion last</p>
<p>   night I believe.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, it was. It was an occasion that launched the millennium forum which</p>
<p>   is a very important exercise designed to improve the financial position</p>
<p>   of the Liberal Party in the State of New South Wales. And they also were</p>
<p>   kind enough to use it as an occasion to mark my 25 years in Parliament which</p>
<p>   actually occurred by the calendar early this year. But it was a nice gathering</p>
<p>   and importantly it was an opportunity to generate and express a lot of very</p>
<p>   strong support for the Liberal Party cause in Sydney. And that's something</p>
<p>   I welcome.</p>
<p>  MILLER:</p>
<p>  Chalk and cheese, I guess, to compare with where you have been in the last</p>
<p>   several days, you were visiting the troops in East Timor. From people I</p>
<p>   have spoken to that have been there they tell me that the devastation there</p>
<p>   is truly appalling.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  It is. I had seen it on television like so many other Australians but until</p>
<p>   it's actually seen with the naked eye you don't have a full perception of</p>
<p>   how extensive it was. And one of the really upsetting things is that when</p>
<p>   you fly over the populated areas like Dili in a helicopter you see vast</p>
<p>   areas of the town blackened and ruined and flattened but other areas completely</p>
<p>   untouched. And it's quite obvious that they were areas where those who were</p>
<p>   either part of or close to those doing the damage had assets or lived and</p>
<p>   that, in a sense, made what occurred even more blameworthy. The people are</p>
<p>   returning, their spirit is returning, they look secure, they are clearly</p>
<p>   very grateful to the INTERFET forces, most of whom are Australians.</p>
<p>  The Australian soldiers have done a fantastic job. They have not only done</p>
<p>   their job militarily but they have worked with the community, they have</p>
<p>   become friends of the local people, they play with the children, they care</p>
<p>   for their wounds in the military hospital, which is a tremendously effectively</p>
<p>   improvised building. It's not only got some patients from the forces who</p>
<p>   have got in the most case thankfully minor ailments but it's also got a</p>
<p>   number of quite serious surgical cases from amongst the local population</p>
<p>   including some wounds inflicted by machetes. And the doctors and nurses</p>
<p>   from the Australian Army are doing an absolutely incredible job and every</p>
<p>   Australian should be hugely proud of what our young, in the main, young</p>
<p>   men and women are doing over there.</p>
<p>  MILLER:</p>
<p>  Well, I think you can say that we are very, very proud of them for all the</p>
<p>   right reasons. But tragically, of course, though as you would no doubt be</p>
<p>   aware today there was a fatality?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Yes. A New Zealand soldier was killed in a, in really a road accident, a</p>
<p>   truck overturned and that is the first fatality in the INTERFET forces and</p>
<p>   it's a source of very great sadness not only to the New Zealand Army but</p>
<p>   to all of the forces. And the Government very much regrets and expresses</p>
<p>   its sympathy to those affected, for that accident.</p>
<p>  MILLER:</p>
<p>  Let's come now to the Timor tax, the Timor levy on the Medicare. Now, I</p>
<p>   have had it pretty unanimously said to me that everyone is saying, okay,</p>
<p>   we can understand this and we will cop it but the feeling very much is that</p>
<p>   once again the Government has gone after the soft target, the PAYE earner.</p>
<p>   And you have circumstances where, for example, you can have a dual income</p>
<p>   couple both earning $45,000 won't pay at a big level but a single income</p>
<p>   family with one breadwinner on $50,000 will.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, that, of course, is a product of our taxation system whereby we tax</p>
<p>   people as individuals. Could I make the point that the purpose of the levy</p>
<p>   was not to hit the so-called rich. I don't regard $50,000 a year as rich,</p>
<p>   I mean, that's absurd to suggest it is. The purpose of it was to protect</p>
<p>   the low income earners and the only, broadly the only way you can do that</p>
<p>   in Australia is according to individual income. It becomes very awkward</p>
<p>   and cumbersome if you start taxing people as couples. You introduce a whole</p>
<p>   new concept into the taxation system and there would be just as many, if</p>
<p>   not more complaints, if you tax people as couples which is really what those</p>
<p>   complaints about individual income earners would suggest you might do.</p>
<p>  Now, I have probably done more as Prime Minister in changing the tax laws</p>
<p>   to help single income earners than any Prime Minister in the last 30 years.</p>
<p>   And it was one of the big things in our 1996 policy that we gave special</p>
<p>   extra tax help to single income families with dependent children. And their</p>
<p>   tax position from the 1st of July next year will be infinitely</p>
<p>   better off and better than what it is now. For example, if you are a single</p>
<p>   income family with two or three children from the 1st of July</p>
<p>   next year you will have a tax free zone of about $13,000 or $14,000 as a</p>
<p>   result of the tax changes that we are making. And in all cases, what these</p>
<p>   changes do will be to very modestly reduce a very big tax cut, or a significant</p>
<p>   tax cut, for people whose incomes are over $50,000.</p>
<p>  For example, if you are a single taxpayer on $60,000 a year the levy will</p>
<p>   reduce by $6 from $62 a week to $56 a week, the tax cut that you will receive</p>
<p>   under our tax cut plan. So people in that range although they will be paying</p>
<p>   a levy they will still be significantly better off as a result of the tax</p>
<p>   cuts. The levy is only for one year. It is because we have a particular</p>
<p>   budget problem in the next financial year. There's no budget problem this</p>
<p>   year, there is no budget problem in subsequent years. And I repeat that</p>
<p>   the purpose of the way it was structured was to protect low and modest income</p>
<p>   earners, not to make an assumption that people earning $50,000 a year were</p>
<p>   well off, they are not. But their position to pay is, of course, by definition</p>
<p>   somewhat better than that of people who are earning a lower amount.</p>
<p>  Now, as to the double income thing, the only way you can cure that is to</p>
<p>   really go down a quite different road in this country and that is to aggregate</p>
<p>   the incomes of couples and tax them as a unit. Now, I don't think there's</p>
<p>   community support for that, I think people take the view that people should</p>
<p>   be taxed on an individual basis and that there should be special help for</p>
<p>   single income families with children. And that is what we have done, both</p>
<p>   in our 1996 policy and again in the tax package. I mean, we are doubling</p>
<p>   the tax free threshold for single income providers and, as I said, if you</p>
<p>   have got two or three children, one of them under five, you will be having</p>
<p>   a tax free threshold of about $13,000 a year. Now, that is a vast improvement</p>
<p>   on the present arrangement because I am very sensitive to the position of</p>
<p>   single income earners.</p>
<p>  MILLER:</p>
<p>  What about the concerns raised that this is not the last we'll see of special</p>
<p>   Medicare levies, that this is a very hand revenue raising tool for Government?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, it's not a revenue raising tool. We are using it to specifically pay</p>
<p>   for an extraordinary item of expense that we couldn't have reasonably predicted</p>
<p>   at the time of the budget. This is the second time that our Government has</p>
<p>   introduced it. We introduced it in relation to the gun buyback in 1996.</p>
<p>   And that lasted as promised for a year. That money was used to buyback the</p>
<p>   guns and it ended. Now it's not a revenue raising measure in the normal</p>
<p>   sense. If it were it would go on indefinitely. But this is a particular</p>
<p>   reason, we have a particular need. If we didn't do it our budget would go</p>
<p>   into deficit next financial year on present indications. Now we weren't</p>
<p>   prepared to allow that to happen. The only alternative was more spending</p>
<p>   cuts. And John, we have cut spending a lot. You're now getting to the point</p>
<p>   where if you cut it further to get large amounts of money you're going to</p>
<p>   start effecting things that people really need on a day to day basis and</p>
<p>   we're not willing to do that.</p>
<p>  MILLER:</p>
<p>  Okay, well let's move on because there's a couple of other issues I want</p>
<p>   to raise with you. First of all, does the Government have any concerns about</p>
<p>   this massive database on Australians that has been set up by Kerry Packer</p>
<p>   in a joint venture with an American company?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well I've read all the newspaper reports about it and on the information</p>
<p>   in front of me at the moment it would appear that what is being stored is</p>
<p>   information in relation to individuals that can be obtained now. I mean</p>
<p>   Electoral Rolls have been mentioned. Electoral Rolls are public documents.</p>
<p>   I saw on the front page of the Sydney Daily Telegraph this morning what</p>
<p>   I assume were the personal details of I think Mr Andrew Robb who is running</p>
<p>   this company. Now all of those details can be readily obtained from easily</p>
<p>   accessible documents including Who's Who. Now there are thousands of people</p>
<p>   in Who's Who. You don't have to go in Who's Who. If you decide to go in</p>
<p>   Who's Who you're asked certain questions. You don't have to answer all of</p>
<p>   those but you provide information. Information like what club you belong</p>
<p>   to, or what your cultural or sporting or recreational interests are. They're</p>
<p>   the sort of things that you provide voluntarily. Now we will continue to</p>
<p>   monitor it, and we are very sensitive to proper concerns about privacy.</p>
<p>   But it seems that what has happened in this case is that it's the aggregation</p>
<p>   of all of the information that people appear to be concerned about because</p>
<p>   in relation to individuals, this kind of information is already held by</p>
<p>   a large number of organisations, and it's not all that difficult particularly</p>
<p>   in relation to people who have business activities and have some kind of</p>
<p>   public profile, it's not all that difficult to assemble the information.</p>
<p>   You can find out people's addresses in most cases by either the Electoral</p>
<p>   Roll or the telephone book.</p>
<p>  MILLER:</p>
<p>  Sure. But the concern is I think that as you say with the aggregation of</p>
<p>   all this information into a central database, and other information coming</p>
<p>   in from for example, your David Jones account, or your use of your Visa</p>
<p>   credit card, or your..</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well my understanding is that the law prevents a third party passing on</p>
<p>   information about you without your consent. So that it would seem would</p>
<p>   be an adequate protection there. I mean my understanding of the law is that</p>
<p>   if I've got some details of somebody, somebody's got some details of me,</p>
<p>   say a bank. I mean I borrowed money to put extensions onto a house, my home</p>
<p>   like most people. Now my understanding is that bank can't sort of willy</p>
<p>   nilly pass that onto somebody without my permission. Now if that is not</p>
<p>   the case, if my understanding is wrong well I'll be concerned.</p>
<p>  MILLER:</p>
<p>  Okay well let's move on again to another issue that a lot of Australians</p>
<p>   are concerned about at the moment and that is the illegal immigrants flood</p>
<p>   that we're experiencing right now. I mean I heard some fairly ridiculous</p>
<p>   debate yesterday about air-conditioning barracks at Woomera.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well I think everybody regards that as ridiculous. I can't imagine that</p>
<p>   the people who made the suggestion are really serious.</p>
<p>MILLER:</p>
<p>  Well how are we going in stopping this invasion?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well it's difficult but we're making progress. Getting the law tightened</p>
<p>   will help because it will remove the impression that Australia is a soft</p>
<p>   touch. I don't mind Australia being seen as fair and a fair touch if I could</p>
<p>   put it that way in relation to refugees. But we can't be seen as an easy</p>
<p>   touch because that will involve queue jumping and it will involve people</p>
<p>   who've waited faithfully and played by the rules and worked according to</p>
<p>   the system, missing out, and people who've been queue jumping getting advantage.</p>
<p>   Now we don't want that to happen. But we are campaigning around the world</p>
<p>   to send the message that people can't just turn up in this country, get</p>
<p>   a foot hold, and then because of the complexity of our laws expect to remain</p>
<p>   here indefinitely. Now that has happened in the past, and the Labor Party</p>
<p>   in particular in the Senate has blocked attempts over the last couple of</p>
<p>   years on the part of this Government to tighten the law. And all of that</p>
<p>   has tended to create an impression that all you've got to do is get here</p>
<p>   and then you're right because the lawyers will tie the courts up indefinitely.</p>
<p>   And you can stay. Now we can't run a refugee policy on that basis. We are</p>
<p>   a very generous country to refugees. We have a fine reputation around the</p>
<p>   world. But we're not going to have people take advantage of our generosity</p>
<p>   and we're just trying to get a balance.</p>
<p>  MILLER:</p>
<p>  Okay. Well I must say to you that I do appreciate your time this morning</p>
<p>   even more so because it's now ten-to-ten in your world, almost the middle</p>
<p>   of the working day in Sydney, while we still don't have daylight saving</p>
<p>   here. There's been talk of that again by the way this week with our Premier.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well I know this is a State matter but can I say from the point of view</p>
<p>   of a Prime Minister that it really is ridiculous that communities within</p>
<p>   Australia, and I look at this from a national point of view not from a State</p>
<p>   point of view, that really are within plainly the same time zones if I can</p>
<p>   put it that way, and I'm talking here about the eastern seaboard, Brisbane</p>
<p>   and Sydney, and the Gold Coast, Sunshine Coast. It is difficult and perplexing</p>
<p>   that the time zones are different. I can understand the view of country</p>
<p>   people in both Queensland and New South Wales, and I've often wondered to</p>
<p>   myself whether we should look at drawing time zones in Australia that ignore</p>
<p>   State boundaries. For example many people as I understand it living in Broken</p>
<p>   Hill for example, are more akin to Adelaide times and so forth even though</p>
<p>   politically and geographically Broken Hill is part of New South Wales. So</p>
<p>   I don't expect people to readily agree with that. A lot of people say oh</p>
<p>   no this is a matter for the States. But whilst it's not the most important</p>
<p>   problem facing Australia, and of course we can go on with the present system</p>
<p>   and we'll still be a fantastic place in which to live, it does seem to me</p>
<p>   to be a little bit odd to be governed by old State boundaries in relation</p>
<p>   to something like this when the modern day reality is that the communities</p>
<p>   of northern New South Wales and southern Queensland, and the coastal areas</p>
<p>   of the two States are really one, and that it would be a hell of a lot more</p>
<p>   convenient and also of course the business convenience in relation to Brisbane</p>
<p>   and Sydney and Melbourne if we were all on the same time.</p>
<p>  MILLER:</p>
<p>  All right. I'll let you go now. But one final remark and that is how about</p>
<p>   that Aaron Baddeley kid?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Absolutely fantastic. It just keeps going on this sporting year for Australia.</p>
<p>   I can't recall a year in my life when there have been so many outstanding</p>
<p>   individual and team performances. Ian Thorpe, now Aaron, the incredible</p>
<p>   Wallabies, great bunch of blokes, our cricketers, our netballers, our women's</p>
<p>   hockey, our baseballers. It is extraordinary. It's been a vintage year and</p>
<p>   of course we've got the Davis Cup at the weekend against the French.</p>
<p>  MILLER:</p>
<p>  There you go, all leading up to the Olympics. Prime Minister John Howard</p>
<p>   thanks for your time this morning.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Thanks John.</p>
