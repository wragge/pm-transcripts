PRIME MINISTER PRESS STATEMENT NO. 387<br />
27 November 1974<br />
INDUSTRIES ASSISTANCE COMMISSION REFERENCE<br />
IRON AND STEEL<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam, today announced that<br />
he had sent a reference to the Industries Assistance Commission<br />
on the question of assistance needed to support the continued<br />
growth of Australia's iron and steel industry.<br />
Mr Whitlam said that continuity of a soundly based<br />
and efficient iron and steel industry is fundamental to the<br />
Australian economy and that the Government is concerned to<br />
ensure the progressive de~ Yelopment of the industry in<br />
keeping with projected Australian and overseas demand.<br />
Mr Whitlam commented that while alloy steel, high<br />
carbon steel and electrical steel had been reviewed between<br />
1966 and 1968, major developments had since occurred in these<br />
sectors of the industry both within Australia and overseas.<br />
The nature and extent of these developments had led the<br />
Government to call for an interim report on this sector of<br />
the industry. other iron and steel now under reference had<br />
not been reviewed since the 1930' s and the wide reference<br />
will consequently give the opportunity for a much needed<br />
consolidated review of the whole industry.<br />
The Prime Minister concluded that he considered it<br />
desirable that measures for the sound development of the<br />
iron and steel industry be reported on by the Industries<br />
Assistance Commission before reviews already scheduled in<br />
the Tariff Review program in respect of industries using<br />
basi-' c iron and steel, because of the particular importance<br />
t~ o almost all sectors of industry of iron and steel costs.<br />
