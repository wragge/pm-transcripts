PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY THEE PRIME MINSTER. THE HON P. J. KEATING, M?.<br />
THE COUNCIL OF AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENTS MEETING<br />
At Tuesday's Council of Australian Governments Meeting in Melbourne, I will be<br />
putting the Federal Government's view that the Mabo principles outlined last week are<br />
a workable, responsible and decisive response to the challenges posed by the High<br />
Court decision.<br />
Some responses to both the High Court judgement a year ago and to the document of<br />
principles just released reveal a degree of misunderstanding which it is in no one's<br />
interest to perpetuate, least of all the nation's in general.<br />
From the outset the Government decided that the development of policy should take<br />
place through a national process of consultation, and that COAG would be an<br />
important next step in that process.<br />
Tuesday's meeting will be the first opportunity for Mabo to be discussed at Head of<br />
Government level.<br />
The Government has said that recognition by the High Court of native title provides an<br />
unprecedented opportunity to even up the relationship between indigenous and nonindigenous<br />
Australians, and to build a relationship of mutual respect and trust on a<br />
foundation of justice and dignity.<br />
The principles released by the Government are squarely in line with this view.<br />
There is no sense in different groups staking out extreme or unworkable positions. For<br />
instance, it serves no good purpose to argue that native title has continued everywhere<br />
since 1788 and has nowhere been extinguished by subsequent grants of interest, when<br />
in fact the High Court has specifically rejected this proposition.<br />
Equally it is both shortsighted and insensitive to reject outright the notion that native<br />
title should be preserved to the maximum extent possible, or to suggest that<br />
extinguishment is a reasonable option with the title holder having had no say in the<br />
matter. There is also little sense in believing that Australia can put its head in the sand on<br />
issues such as c ompensation. Like Mabo itself', these issues will not go away simply<br />
because they are difficult. </p>
<p>I do not expect the COAG meeting to end in detailed agreement but it can provide an<br />
opportunity for a positive step forward. A good, solid discussion would itself be a<br />
valuable contribution to the process.<br />
For example, there could be broad agreement on the need for an efficient means of<br />
identifying the who and where of native title and on the acceptance that native title is a<br />
common law reality and needs to be accommodated.<br />
I will also be urging Premiers and Chief Ministers to accept that there ought to be<br />
room for negotiations as well as legal solutions to land management problems, and that<br />
Australia needs to move quickly to a new land management regime.<br />
On related issues:<br />
* it is hardly a revolutionary idea that a mining lease should not extinguish native<br />
title, and that the native title can continue subject to that lease; this idea involves<br />
treating native title no differently from most freehold title.<br />
* the date of 30 June, 1993 does not represent a cut-off beyond which States<br />
canniot issue grants of interest in land such as exploration or mining leases. It means<br />
only that they should do so in a non-discrimninatory fashion and the Commonwealth,<br />
beyond that point, would not normally beVwilling to rectify failures to abide by the<br />
Racial Discrimination Act.<br />
