It has been decided to revalue the Australian dollar. The<br />
International Monetary Fund has been consulted and has concurred with<br />
this decision. The gold parity of the Australian dollar, expressed in terms<br />
of U. S. dollars, will be changed from the present 3US1.2160 0A1 to<br />
$ US1.2750 $ A1, representing an appreciation of 4.85 per cent. At<br />
the same time, the market rate will be fixed until further notice at<br />
the new parity. This will mean an overall appreciation of 7.05 per<br />
cent over the present market rate of SUS1.1910 $ A1.<br />
As well, it has been decided to strengthen the existing<br />
measures to control the volume of capital inflow. The present embargo<br />
on overseas borrowings which are repayable, or carry options to repay,<br />
within two years will be continued and its coverage will be broadened.<br />
This measure will be supplemented as from today by the introduction<br />
of a variable deposit requirement scheme in respect of borrowings with<br />
a maturity in excess of two years. Under this scheme, borrovers will<br />
be required to lodge a proportion of the proceeds of overseas borrowings<br />
in a special account writh the Reserve Bank, on which no interest will<br />
be paid. This deposit will be held frozen until the time of repayment<br />
of the borrowing, at which time it will be released to the borrower.<br />
Initially the deposit requirement will be fixed at 25 per cent.<br />
The Governor of the Reserve Bank will be issuing a<br />
separate statement giving further details.<br />
The purpose of these measures is to correct the fundamental<br />
disequilibrium in Australia's balance of payments. That such a<br />
disequilibrium exists has been clearly evident for the past twelve<br />
months or more. It is taken for granted by Australia's own business<br />
community, and is being increasingly recognised abroad.<br />
In the calendar year now ending, there was an overall<br />
surplus in Australia's balance of payments of some ; 2,000 million.<br />
This huge surplus was attributable both to an excessive rate of<br />
capital inflow, especially in the form of borrowings, and to a large<br />
and unprecendented excess of exports over imports of goods and<br />
services. The outcome of these trends, in combination, has been<br />
to swell our holdings of official reserve assets to almost $ 5,000<br />
million, over three times their level of only two years ago. No<br />
responsible Government could allow such a situation to continue. / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
Because they do not necessitate immediate and drastic<br />
solutions in the same way as do the opposite problem of low and<br />
falling reserves, it is sometimes supposed that fast-growing reserves<br />
are not a problem at all. But they are a problem. They represent<br />
a waste of potential resources at our disposal, they are potentially<br />
inflationary, they make more difficult the task of effective economic<br />
management, and in themselves they raise expectations of exchange<br />
rate changes which in turn lead to still further reserve increases.<br />
That being said, I want to make it clear that our decision<br />
to appreciate the exchange rate does not derive principally from the<br />
fast growth in our overall balance of payments surplus and reserves,<br />
which have been heavily influenced by the large inflow of capital<br />
from abroad. Rather, it is a product of developments in our current<br />
account. From a position where, in 1968-69, Australia was incurring<br />
a current account deficit of over 01,000 million, we have moved<br />
progressively into surplus.<br />
The particular strength of the current account at the<br />
present time does, it is true, owe something to the depressed level<br />
of imports which has resulted from the slow-down in the economy<br />
during 1971-72. As overall activity in the economy picks up, so<br />
will the level of imports. But so, we believe will the level of<br />
exports, as our major markets abroad grow apace and their demand<br />
for our products increases. In short, while we both expect and<br />
will welcome the growth in imports that 1973 will bring, we see no<br />
likelihood of the overall current account position being transformed<br />
as a result. The rapid growth of Australia's export and import-competing<br />
industries which underlies this progressive strengthening of our<br />
current account is, in itself, a matter for satisfaction. But the<br />
foreign excchange earned from the proceeds of exports is of no value<br />
to Australians, unless it can be used to enlarge the real resources<br />
actually available for use within our economy. It has been clear<br />
for some time that, with our previous exchange rate, this was<br />
impossible. The appreciation of the Australian dollar will have<br />
differing effects on different sectors of the economy. Some groups<br />
will initially be advantaged, other disadvantaged. Maintaining an<br />
undervalued currency can bring temporary gains to some sectors of<br />
the economy; but in the modium and longer term these gains are<br />
illusory because of the harm which the resulting inflationary<br />
forces inflict on each and every member of the community.<br />
The Government's responsibility is to the Australian<br />
pcooile. It is their interests that we have kept centrally in mind<br />
in taking the decisions I have announced today. Gains and losses<br />
to individual sectors of the community gains and losses which in<br />
any event are of a once-for-all character cannot be allowed to<br />
over-ride this primary consideration. </p>
<p>-3-<br />
The Government recognisos that some of the rural industries,<br />
which are already facing difficulties and problems of adjustment to<br />
changed circumstances, may find it particularly difficult to bear the<br />
consequences of the exchange rate appreciation. Should this prove<br />
to be the case, the Government will be prepared to examine<br />
sympathetically the position of those industries and take such<br />
action as may be necessary, in their case, to ease the processes<br />
of adjustment to new conditions.<br />
In the Government's vier, any appropriate appreciation of<br />
the exchange rate would not in itself be sufficient to deal fully<br />
with the problem of excessive capital inflow, although it is an<br />
essential prerequisite to tackling this problem successfully. That<br />
is why we have also moved specifically to restrain the inflow of<br />
foreign capital by the introduction of the deposit requirement<br />
scheme. That scheme will raise the effective final cost of overseas<br />
borrowings and will thereby deter such borrowings. At the level of<br />
per cent at which the deposit has initially been set, the effective<br />
interest cost of funds borrowed overseas will be increased by onethird.<br />
For example, a borrowing at 6 per cent will now effectively<br />
cost 8 per cent to any borrowers who still wish to proceed.<br />
iction of this kind is long overdue. The former<br />
Government took some steps, three months ago, to discourage some<br />
forms of capital inflow. The action then taken had been long delayed,<br />
it was of a very modest kind, and it dealt with only part of the<br />
problem. The result of this delay has been a build-up of domestic<br />
liquidity to a dangerously excessive level.<br />
This Government will do everything within its power to<br />
remedy this situation. Jo accept the responsibility for managing<br />
Australia's affairs in the interest of Australians, and we are<br />
determined to establish and maintain the conditions that make this<br />
possible. The former Prime 1iinistor announced in September that his<br />
Government was examining further moans of giving effect to the aim of<br />
ensuring that overseas capital was employed in Australia in real<br />
partnership with Australian-owned capital. This Government has a<br />
similar objective: the difference is that we are prepared to take,<br />
and we will take, decisive measures to give effect to that objective.<br />
The impact of the deposit requirement scheme will be on<br />
capital inflow, and the main initial impact of the appreciation of<br />
the exchange rate will also be on the capital account of the balance<br />
of payments. But as I have said, the appreciation of tho Australian<br />
dollar is chiefly directed, in the medium and longer run, towards<br />
adjusting the quite excessive strength of the balance of payments<br />
on current account. / 4 </p>
<p>-4-<br />
In the months im. ediately ahead, the effects in this latter<br />
regard will be relatively snall. It has been the recent experience<br />
of all countries adjusting their exchange rates and all of the main<br />
trading countries of the world have done so in recent years that the<br />
chief effects of adjustment on the current account occur only after<br />
some considerable time. This is only to be expected.<br />
In Australia's case the delayed reaction of exports and<br />
imports to the exchange rate change will work to our advantage, because<br />
quick reactions if they were to occur night slow the process of<br />
recovery in economic activity and delay the return to full employment.<br />
Given the time-lags, we do not see that as a danger. I-owover, in the<br />
unlikely event that the reactions were felt more quickly than re<br />
expect, the Government would not hositate in taking appropriate<br />
internal measures to offset any such developments.<br />
In the longer run, of course, the somervhat slower growth<br />
of exports and the rather faster growth in imports which exchange<br />
rate appreciation will bring vill be very much in Australia's total<br />
interests. It will increase the real resources at our disposal, and<br />
will therefore materially assist us, as a Government, in maintaining<br />
the strong forward momentum of the economy and providing the real<br />
resources which will be involved as we come to introduce the policies<br />
and progranmes we have promised to the Australian people.<br />
In recent years, the trends in our balance of payments<br />
have meant that the resources available for use within Australia have<br />
risen more slowly than Australian production. As the Government<br />
progressively establishes conditions in which available resources<br />
can expand more rapidly and the decisions I have announced today<br />
are an essential ingredient of those conditions so it will be<br />
possible for us to improve materially the living conditions of<br />
the Australian people, both in their quantitative and, importantly,<br />
their qualitative aspects. That is the task to which we have set<br />
our hands. Our decisions rhich I have announced today will assist<br />
in its achievement.<br />
