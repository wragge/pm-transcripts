EMBARGOED AGAINST DELIVERY CEKAANTDLVR<br />
SPEECI BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
DECISION MAKERS LUNCHEON PERTH 12 APRIL 1985<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen,<br />
3I II<br />
I Thank you for inviting me here today to address your<br />
" Decision makers" luncheon. It is a pleasure once again to<br />
visit a State where there are so many exciting economic<br />
developments taking place.<br />
This weeks news from the business world has focussed<br />
attention on progress towards the launching of the largest<br />
private project in Australia's history the export phase of<br />
the Northwest Shelf. I am pleased to be able to say that<br />
the excellent co-operation between Brian Burke's government<br />
and my own, in part icular through our respective Resources<br />
Ministers, Gareth Evans and David Parker, helped recently to<br />
avoid a last-minute hitch in arrangements for the project.<br />
I am particularly looking forward to the visit over the next<br />
few days of General Secretary Hu Yaobang, which will begin<br />
here in Western Australia.<br />
One of the matters that we will discuss here in Perth<br />
tomorrow and in the Pilbara on Sunday, is co-operation in<br />
th-e iron and steel industries of Australia and China.<br />
Already this co-operation has meant a great deal to Western<br />
Australia, through China's increasing purchases of Pilbara<br />
iron ore. And we are all aware of this State's interest in<br />
the on-going negotiations on the Channar and Kwinana<br />
projects. Hu Yaobang's visit will' signal a new era in<br />
Chinese-Australian relations. It is indicative of a growing<br />
relationship between our two countries that will be<br />
important for a~ ll Australia, and because of the<br />
significantly increased prospects for resource development<br />
that this relationship offers, particularly for Western<br />
Australia. CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY </p>
<p>More will be said over the next few days of the strength and<br />
developing character of our relationship with China, and I<br />
do not wish to dwell on that aspect of our overall policy<br />
approach in these remarks.<br />
Rather I wish to concentrate today on economic policy more<br />
broadly, paying attention to some critical policy questions<br />
which are now before the Government.<br />
I do so in the knowledge that some commentators seem<br />
sceptical of the Government's ability to deliver the<br />
necessary policy responses.<br />
I remind the doubters that the sceptics were even thicker on<br />
the ground two years ago. Yet we delivered, as promised.<br />
And we will continue to deliver.<br />
The historic National Economic Summit began two years ago<br />
yesterday. On that occasion, and throughout the election campaign which<br />
preceded it, I outlined the Government'* s approach to<br />
economic policy and economic policy making.<br />
Our approach to economic policy was based on an integrated<br />
package of prices and incomes policy, monetary policy and<br />
fiscal policy.<br />
Our approach to policy making was to seek to foster<br />
consensus and co-operation and particularly to ensure that<br />
those most affected by decisions of Government were provided<br />
with sufficient information to make proper assessments of<br />
the policy options available to the Government, and their<br />
implications for individuals.<br />
Taken together these approaches represented a radical<br />
departure from the " 2zabased currency of economic policy<br />
debate in. Australia at the time.<br />
They were greeted at the time with much hope so dismal had<br />
Australia's economic performance become under the more<br />
traditional approachi of the previous government -but much<br />
scepticism also.<br />
Two years on, let us look at the results.<br />
It is now a matter of record that the Labor Government's<br />
economic policies have rescued our economy from the deep<br />
recession of two years ago, while simultaneously halving<br />
inflation.<br />
Our policies to address the problems of high uneMployment<br />
and high inflation simultaneously represented a sharp<br />
departure from the disastrous " inflation first" approach of </p>
<p>3.<br />
our predecessors. Not only did their approach ignore the<br />
social tragedy of continuously high unemployment. But also<br />
it failed totally in its primary goal of bringing about a<br />
sustained reduction in our inflation rate.<br />
Perhaps the most dramatic evidence of the recovery which our<br />
policy has initiated is the 341,000 new jobs that have been<br />
created since the Summit in April 1983.<br />
Despite a disappointing result for March, our target of<br />
500,000 jobs in three years should be achieved ahead of<br />
schedule. And I take this opportunity to reaffirm strongly<br />
the Government's commitment to reducing unemployment and<br />
creating new jobs. Our predecessors' achievements make a<br />
very poor comparison: it took their entire term of over<br />
. seven years to create 340,000 new jobs.<br />
Australia's economic growth rate during 1983-84 was the<br />
highest annual growth rate ever recorded in Australia and<br />
the highest growth rate in that year of any OECD economy.<br />
Growth is proceeding strongly this year and the surveys<br />
indicate that private investment will lead a third year of<br />
impressive expansion in 1985-86.<br />
The Prices and Incomes Accord was introduced as the<br />
principal means of achieving wage moderation and lower<br />
inflation. Despite the well-publicised fears of the<br />
prophets of doom that such a policy would never work, the<br />
Accord has been an outstanding success.<br />
In two short years, Australia's rate of inflation has been<br />
reduced to just over 5 per cent: the lowest annual rate for<br />
13 years. Real unit labour costs have fallen to levels last<br />
seen in the early seventies and profits have improved<br />
dramatically. Figures released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics<br />
this week indicate that the number of working days lost<br />
through industrial disputes fell to the lowest level for 17<br />
years during the 12 months to the end of January.<br />
And this has all occurred even while Australia has<br />
experienced its strongest post-war economic upturn.<br />
Fiscal and monetary policy have been conducted responsibly,<br />
to support the broad thrust of prices and incomes policy.<br />
Our first Budget substantially cut the BuU'get deficit which<br />
we inherited; there will be a further reduction in 1984-85,<br />
and the Government is firmly committed to and will achieve<br />
further reductions in the Budget deficit for 1985-86.<br />
This has required in each year a thorough review of<br />
Government expenditure priorities and programs. It has<br />
required us to take tough decisions a number of which have<br />
been taken at some political cost. </p>
<p>4.<br />
The Government's achievements in monetary policy and<br />
financial deregulation have been well rega~ rded by the<br />
business and financial communi4ty. The monetary projection,<br />
revised mid-year in line with revised expectations of real<br />
growth, was achieved in 1983-84 for the first time in<br />
years. We have set the financial sector on a path to<br />
greater competition and innovation a path which, perhaps<br />
paradoxically, has made it impossible to interpret movements<br />
in the aggregates.<br />
In short this Government has a solid record of delivering on<br />
economic policy. We have consistently stated our intentions<br />
clearly and then delivered, as promised.<br />
Domestic demand has risen strongly in recent months. The<br />
evidence indicates that consumer spending and business<br />
investment are set to expand further in the months ahead<br />
and in each case, to exceed the Budget forecasts.<br />
But the signs ar e also that a high proportion of this demand<br />
is being met from imports rather than1 domestic sources.<br />
For this reason, and also depressed world commodity prices,<br />
the current account deficit has risen sharply.<br />
The recent depreciation of the dollar provides both an<br />
opportunity to correct this position, in time, and a<br />
challenge to the achievement of sustained growth in domestic<br />
production and employment.<br />
Depreciation initially implies an unavoidable reduction in<br />
national income and wealth, measured in w,. orld prices. All<br />
parties will need to share, in somne degree, in the initial<br />
process of adjustment a process which nevertheless must<br />
also ensure that resources are channelled towards producers<br />
who have3 become competitive against overseas suppliers.<br />
If the competitive advantage is maintained and the required<br />
rcdirection of effort achieved, depreciation will also<br />
provide an opportunity to achieve substantially higher<br />
incomes and employment in the longer term.<br />
Part of the process to redirect resources will involve<br />
higher domestic prices of a range of imported and in<br />
varying degrees, exportable and perhaps import-competing<br />
goods. These price adjustments themselves are not a threat<br />
to economic recovery. Indeed they are the most effective<br />
means of achieving faster growth in many industries not<br />
just exporters but also domestic manufacturers in<br />
competition with imports and correcting our rapidly<br />
expanding current account deficit.<br />
But therein also lies the " challenge"* presented by the<br />
depreciation. We have to prevent this initial rise in<br />
consumer prices from initiating a destructive inflationary<br />
spiral. The Government is actively addressing this task. </p>
<p>After the 1976 devaluation the then Government slammed on<br />
the fiscal and monetary brakes in an effort to prevent such<br />
a spiral.. Ultimately they were unsuccessful because their<br />
approach did not pay adequate heed to Australia's traditions<br />
and institutions.<br />
The Labor Government is no less resolute in its<br />
determination to prevent any sustained surge in inflation.<br />
But while fiscal and monetary policy are and will continue<br />
to be firmly anti-inflationary, we do not believe that it is<br />
necessary or appropriate to use these instruments in ways<br />
that stop growth. Our main anti-inflationary thrust will<br />
come from the prices and incomes policy that has served us<br />
so well over the past two years.<br />
That policy recognises that none of our economic policies<br />
operates in a vacuum. Economic policies are not like<br />
chemical reactions that take place according to formulae.<br />
They are implemented in a world where Individuals and groups<br />
other than the Government are deeply affected by them~.<br />
The Government is working within the co-operative framework<br />
of the Prices and Incomes Accord to consider options and to<br />
seek agreement to measures which will preserve to the<br />
maximum extent feasible the potential employment gains from<br />
depreciation. Many commentators have suggested that wage indexation<br />
adjustments be discounted for the component of inflation<br />
that is directly attributable to depreciation. We ' have that<br />
option under examination but it is not the only option<br />
available. Decisions on how the Government responds to the inflationary<br />
effects of depreciation on costs through wage indexation are<br />
not formally required for a little time yet. It seems<br />
likely, for example, that the direct impact of depreciation<br />
or. the CPI in the March and June quarters and thus the<br />
amount in contention at the time of the next wage case is<br />
likely to be relatively small. -out let there be no doubt<br />
that,-measures will be taken, as necessary, to prevent the<br />
emergence of a debilitating inflationary spiral.<br />
This is because the gains from depreciation are worth<br />
preserving. There are potentially many tens of thousands of<br />
jobs, and perhaps a hundred thousand jobs, in addition to<br />
the on-going employment growth that we we. Ce already<br />
expecting before the depreciation, which could be directly<br />
created over the next few years if we can ma-Antain the now<br />
enhanced competitiveness of Australian suppliers. A renewed<br />
inflationary spiral would not only put-these jobs at risk.<br />
It could also undermine recovery itself. </p>
<p>6.<br />
I have every confidence that this new challenge to providing<br />
jobs and economic security will be worked out within the<br />
framework of the Accord.<br />
A related question is the Government's approach to the<br />
mooted " productivity" case later this year.<br />
We have always acknowledged, as do the Principles of the<br />
Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, that there would<br />
come a time when it was appropriate for Australians in jobs<br />
to share in the recovery through improvements in standards,<br />
in addition to sharing through greater security of<br />
employment. As I emphasised on national television on Wednesday night,<br />
our first concern is to ensure that we preserve the strong<br />
employment growth with moderate inflation that has<br />
characterised the Labor Government's period in office.<br />
Any productivity increase must be of a size and timing that<br />
is consistent with these objectives.<br />
Within the centralised wage fixation system, the A. C. T. U.<br />
and business groups will present their own perspectives to<br />
the Arbitration Commission on how any entitlement to<br />
improved conditions should be calculated.<br />
The Gover~ iment's approach will be to work towards an out-come<br />
that is consistent with our shared objective of sustained<br />
growth with low inflation.<br />
our second major policy challenge at the moment is fiscal<br />
policy. When the economy was in deep recession, it was appropriate<br />
to provide a strong fiscal stimulus to the private sector.<br />
But, from our earliest days in Government, we have<br />
emphasised that this stimulus had to be reduced as private<br />
sector activity picked up. Thus, during the recent election<br />
campaign I pledged the Government to a " trilogy" of major<br />
fiscal commitments, including:<br />
Further reductions in the Commonwealth's Budget deficit<br />
in monzy terms in 1985-86 and as a proportion of GDP<br />
over the life of the current Parliament;<br />
No increase in tax revenue as a proportion o f GDP in<br />
1985-86 and over the life of the Parliament;<br />
A reduction in expenditure as a proportion of GDP in<br />
1985-86 and the life of the Parliament. </p>
<p>These unprecedented commitments endorsed by-Cabinet are<br />
tie measure of thn Labor Government's determination to<br />
pursue a soind fiscal policy.<br />
With the depreciation of the dollar, and prospects for<br />
stronger growth and employment then previously anticipated,<br />
the Government will be seeking to achieve maximum reductions<br />
in outlays in 1985/ 86.<br />
Targets-for these reductions in outlays were laid down<br />
immediately following the election -to meet our trilogy<br />
commitments, including a substantial reduction of the<br />
deficit in money terms.<br />
* The depreciation may have the immediate effect of increasing<br />
revenue more than it raises the cost of maintaining priority<br />
programs. None of this increase in net revenue, if it occurs, will be<br />
jused tTo increhase Goveernment outlays.<br />
Government will ensure that expenditure cuts are large<br />
enough to achieve established outlays targets.<br />
The whole of any increased budgetary flexibility following<br />
the depreciation will be applied strengthening the<br />
economy's prospects for even stronger private sector growth<br />
in output and employment with low inflation.<br />
The Government will decide on the most effective means of<br />
achieving this result when the full extent of the<br />
post-depreciation improvement in the budgetary outlook is<br />
knwn. The Government took steps as early as last December to<br />
ensure that adequate time can be given to this task by<br />
* advancing the expenditure review process somewhat ' omnared<br />
with the usual Budget timetable. This was intended also, to<br />
enable us to determine whether some measures can usefully be<br />
implemented earlier than the normal timetable would have<br />
allowed, so that the full-year effect of tChe expenditure<br />
saving measures are available in 1985-86.<br />
I expect that the Government will be in a position to<br />
announce some of these measures in time to yield full-year<br />
savings for the tiext financial year.<br />
As I have said on other occasions, some of these decisions<br />
will undoubtedly be unpopular in some quarters.<br />
The Government recognises, however, that this is inevitable,<br />
if it is to respond to a broadly-shared view that fiscal<br />
discipline is required if the fruits of sustained strong<br />
economic growth are to be available for all Australians in<br />
the future. </p>
<p>Fiscal restraint is, of course, required at all levels of<br />
Government. If current agreements were extended beyond<br />
1984-85,. Commonwealth tax sharing payments to States would<br />
rise by 16 per cent in 1985-36. Payments to local<br />
Government authorities would rise almost 20 per cent. it<br />
would be entirely inappropriate to extend such arrangements.<br />
These matters will be discussed at the forthcoming Premiers<br />
Conference, when new arrangements for general revenue<br />
assistance to States will also be considered.<br />
There has been much ill-informed commentary to the effect<br />
that the Government has " gone soft" on monetary policy.<br />
Nothing could be further from the truth.<br />
The decision to suspend the M3 monetary projection was taken<br />
not to cloak loose policy, but after a full reappraisal of<br />
the informational content of M3.<br />
it was taken because the very process of financial<br />
deregulation which is so warmly and so widely applauded has<br />
also distorted the growth of M3 and other aggregates, and<br />
will continue to do so in the period ahead of us. Their<br />
reliability as indicators of monetary policy has been<br />
sharply reduced.<br />
The irony is that, even while applauding deregulation, sou.,<br />
commentators are not prepared to make proper allowance for<br />
the uncertainties which are introduced when interpreting the<br />
monetary aggregates.<br />
Interest rates have moved up since the tuzn of the year, and<br />
often now exceed the levels of a year ago, which is hardly<br />
suggestive of excessive monetary ease.<br />
So let us be clear. Monetary policy is being and will<br />
continue to be administered firmly, to support the<br />
Government's objective of non-inflationary growth.<br />
In the context of business anxiety about monetary policy<br />
this -year, I must admit to some feeling of fellowship with<br />
the Chairman of the United States' Federal Reserve System.<br />
When we discussed monetary policy in Washington in February,<br />
Paul Volcker described the criticism that the United 3tzates'<br />
authorities received when distortion of monetary measurement<br />
in the wake of financial deregulation caused them-* to suspend<br />
monetary targetting.<br />
I will be satisfied if the inflationary scene in Australia<br />
following this step is in line with the United States<br />
experience! </p>
<p>The achievement of sustained non-inflationary growth<br />
growth at a pace sufficient to create jobs and to gradually<br />
reduce unemployment over time nas been my Government's<br />
objective since coming to Office.<br />
Our package of policies to date prices and incomes policy,<br />
monetary policy, fiscal policy, and industry policy has<br />
been highly successful.<br />
The sceptics of two years ago have been shown to be wrong.<br />
Inflation is down and employment has expanded impressively.<br />
Industrial disputation has been dramatically reduced.<br />
Profitability has been restored and real unit labour costs<br />
reduced. Consumer demand is buoyant. Depreciation can<br />
provide a real fillip to domestic manufacturing.<br />
Particularly heartening is the improving picture for<br />
business investment.<br />
The conditions are coming into place which will permit<br />
sustained economic recovery. This is what we were elected<br />
to do. All Australians. can be well satisfied with what we<br />
are achieving together. ^ wM </p>
