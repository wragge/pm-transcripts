SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
OPENING OF GYMNASIUM AT HMAS COONAWARRA<br />
DARWIN 25 APRIL 1991<br />
On Anzac Day 1991, it * is proper for the thoughts of all<br />
Australians to turn to the men and women who are serving in<br />
the armed forces of our country to those who served our<br />
country with such valour and distinction in the past and,<br />
most of all, to those who paid the supreme sacrifice in<br />
defence of liberty and peace.<br />
It is now seventy six years since the ANZAC tradition was<br />
forged at Gallipoli, and half a century since Australia's<br />
sons and daughters rallied to the call to arms against<br />
tyranny and oppression in the Second World War. This<br />
December will see the 50th Anniversary of the attack on<br />
Pearl Harbour, which plunged our whole region into<br />
catastrophic war.<br />
In that challenge, Australians endured much and they<br />
sacrificed much. But thanks to the resourcefulness, energy<br />
and sheer courage of Australians, and of our allies, the<br />
cause of liberty prevailed. As a result, the years since<br />
that terrible era of warfare have seen dramatic and<br />
fundamental change within this region and throughout the<br />
world. In an atmosphere of peace and security, former adversaries<br />
have achieved international reconciliation and mutual<br />
understanding. This region, once characterised by<br />
instability and conflict, has led the world in economic<br />
growth and dynamism, to the benefit of all its peoples.<br />
Today, we have within our grasp the attainment of goals for<br />
which previous generations have fought and for which they<br />
have made many sacrifices. In particular, we can see the<br />
way towards the attainment of the original goals of the<br />
United Nations Organisation goals which had been denied<br />
and delayed throughout the anguished years of the cold war<br />
but which today as the world community demonstrated in<br />
Kuwait are closer to fulfillment than they have ever been. </p>
<p>But hand in hand with these opportunities goes the need for<br />
vigilance. The qualities of professionalism, dedication and<br />
courage which the Australian Armed Forces have displayed and<br />
nurtured since their inception remain of relevance now. And<br />
here at HMAS Coonawarra, let me say that the Royal<br />
Australian Navy remains a vital part of our nation's self<br />
reliant defence capabilities.<br />
Nowhere was this more ably demonstrated than in the recent<br />
Gulf conflict.-With little warning, the men and women of<br />
the Navy embarked upon an arduous and hazardous tour of<br />
duty, and discharged with distinction the tasks with which<br />
they were entrusted. In doing so, they earned the respect<br />
of their colleagues in the coalition forces in the Gulf.<br />
And even more importantly, they earned the respect of the<br />
people of Australia for proving, once more, Australia's<br />
reputation as a nation which is willing and able to take a<br />
stand against aggression, and to meet its obligations as a<br />
responsible member of the international community.<br />
Many of the men and women who formed the Australian naval<br />
task force have already returned home. Only last week I<br />
welcomed home HMAS Brisbane and HMAS Sydney from their tour<br />
of duty in the Gulf. But let us not forget those<br />
Australians who remain, their tasks not yet complete the<br />
clearance diving team, which has been engaged in the mammoth<br />
and delicate task of clearing Kuwaiti ports, and the crew of<br />
HMAS Westralia, who provided such able and timely support to<br />
the coalition naval forces.<br />
On this day, when we acknowledge the sacrifice of so many<br />
Australians, it is important also to turn our thoughts to<br />
those many other Australian service personnel contributing<br />
to important peacekeeping tasks in the trouble spots of the<br />
world. On Anzac Day 1991 we wish them all well and a safe return<br />
when their work is done.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen<br />
It is fitting on this day, also, to acknowledge the<br />
important contribution made to the defence of the north by a<br />
small group of Australians whose efforts and dedication have<br />
to date gone largely unrecognised and unrewarded. It should<br />
never be forgotten that in the dark days of World War II,<br />
Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders were among the many<br />
Australians who stepped forward to play their part in<br />
Australia's defence.<br />
I am pleased to announce that the Government has approved<br />
payments to about 100 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders<br />
who served full-time alongside the Defence Force in the<br />
Second World War, when Australia itself was threatened with<br />
invasion. </p>
<p>3.<br />
These people, who were not formally enlisted or paid at the<br />
time, carried out such tasks as patrolling, reconnaissance,<br />
coastwatching and training for guerilla warfare. The nature<br />
of their training and their tasks clearly shows that they<br />
were expected, and willing, to fight against the enemy if<br />
the need had. arisen.<br />
These Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders include those<br />
who served with the Northern Territory Special<br />
Reconnaissance-Unit, based in Arnhem Land, and the Snake Bay<br />
Patrol, based on Bathurst and Melville Islands, certain<br />
crewmen on Royal Australian Navy ships " Heather" and<br />
" Viking", and a number of Aborigines at Groote Eylandt who<br />
participated in the defence of the airfield.<br />
The untaxed payments will be based on the military salary<br />
and allowance rates for a private soldier during the Second<br />
World War, adjusted to reflect the change in the value of<br />
money since 1945.<br />
Those eligible for payments, and their dependants, may also<br />
be eligible for repatriation benefits under the normal<br />
criteria. After almost half a century, the Government derives great<br />
pleasure fromn being able to recognise, with just and<br />
deserved recompense, the significant contribution made by<br />
these members of our community.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen<br />
Just as the world has changed, so our thinking about the<br />
defence of Australia has grown and matured. Nowhere is this<br />
more evident than here in the north of Australia.<br />
The Government's 1987 White Paper on Defence specifically<br />
recognised the crucial role of the northern sea-air gap in<br />
the defence of Australia. This thinking, together with the<br />
concept of defence in depth and the need to protect our of fshore<br />
economi c assets, is fundamental to our defence posture<br />
and has shaped the development of our northern defence<br />
infrastructure. The Air Force's chain of northern air bases, the Army's<br />
emerging facilities in Darwin for 1 Cavalry Regiment and,<br />
not least, the Navy's Patrol Boat base and communications<br />
facilities hEre, are testimony to the Government's resolve<br />
to maintain and expand the fundamental infrastructure<br />
necessary to provide properly for our defence needs into the<br />
twenty first century. </p>
<p>It is easy to consider our national defence priorities in<br />
terms of big ticket items, new bases, new submarines or<br />
warships. But we should never forget that the equipment is<br />
only as good as the person operating it. When we strip away<br />
the rhetoric, and the glamour of high technology, we come<br />
face to face with the highly trained, well motivated and<br />
dedicated men and women of the services especially in the<br />
Royal Australian Navy. These are the people who showed in<br />
the Gulf, and who show time and again in the waters off our<br />
northern shores, that they are more than equal to the<br />
demands which we as a nation make of them.<br />
These service men and women have well earned the respect<br />
with which they are held in the community: they personify<br />
our defence, as the many men and women who preceded them<br />
did, and as those who follow them will do.<br />
Their well-being cannot therefore be divorced from the<br />
overall capabilities of our Defence Force. For this reason,<br />
I am especially pleased to be able to be here today in this<br />
new physical fitness centre, constructed by Hansen Yuncken<br />
Constructions at a cost of over $ 2.25 million dollars.<br />
It would be remiss not to acknowledge at this point the<br />
sterling work of Hansen Yuncken and all its employees, and<br />
of the designers Australian Construction Services, in<br />
bringing this valuable project to a successful conclusion.<br />
This facility, along with the many other improvements being<br />
undertaken here at HMAS Coonawarra, demonstrates in the most<br />
tangible way the Government's determination to accord proper<br />
priority to meeting the needs of our service personnel.<br />
I have much pleasure in declaring this physical fitness<br />
centre open. </p>
