PRIME MINISTER<br />
CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
LAUNCH OF SOCIAL JUSTICE REPORT<br />
SPRINGVALE 2 MAY 1988<br />
The launch today of this report, " Towards a Fairer<br />
Australia: Social Justice Under Labor" marks an important<br />
new stage in the life of the Labor Government.<br />
It is the first time that all the facts about what I believe<br />
is a proud Labor record of social justice have been gathered<br />
together in one document.<br />
It is a pleasure to launch it here at the Springvale<br />
Community Centre because it is at Centres such as this that<br />
the effectivenss of social justice programs is ultimately<br />
tested.<br />
And I believe too that Centres such as this both in their<br />
very existence and in the quality of the services they are<br />
capable of delivering reflect the depth of the Labor<br />
Government's commitment to enhancing and expanding such<br />
programs. This report is about Labor's social justice strategy and I<br />
want at the outset to stress that it has been just that a<br />
carefully crafted and costed staey pursued from our<br />
first days in office, to lift t~ eTeel and quality of<br />
social justice in Australia.<br />
This has not meapt randomly applying bandaids to social<br />
problems only when those problems have become too big to<br />
ignore. Social justice under Labor does not mean throwing money<br />
around in the false hope that indi-scriminate expenditure<br />
might be an adequate substitute for careful targeting.<br />
Our strategy has not been about abandoning the weakest<br />
members of our commuiiinity on the scrapheap while extending<br />
protection to those who do not need it.<br />
Each of those failings has characterised the mismanagement<br />
of social policy by our conservative predecessors and each<br />
still forms part of their philosophy of government which<br />
they would implement if they were ever returned to office.<br />

A* </p>
<p>What social justice under Labor means can be simply put: a<br />
concerted effort to make Australia a fairer society<br />
a society in which economic resources are taxed<br />
fairly and distributed fairly;<br />
a society in which there is fair access to all<br />
essential community services;<br />
a society in which there is equality of rights in<br />
civil, legal and industrial affairs;<br />
a society in which all Australians, regardless of<br />
their background, can participate in making the<br />
decisions that affect their lives.<br />
It has to be understood that these aspirations have been and<br />
remain fully dependent on and supportive of our economic<br />
strategy.<br />
Our economic strategy is about generating new prosperity in<br />
the community; our social justice strategy is about<br />
distributing that prosperity fairly throughout the<br />
community. Our economic strategy has meant tightening our belts as we<br />
pass through what have been for Australia very tough<br />
economic times. our social justice strategy has meant that<br />
the necessary sacrifices have been shared, fairly, by all<br />
sections of the community.<br />
Right from the start of our term in office, when I<br />
articulated the foundations of our economic strategy -in<br />
for example my address to the National Economic Summit I<br />
convened straight after we were elected I also articulated<br />
our social justice goals.<br />
In that address, I declared that the purpose of the economic<br />
strategy was " maintenance and through time an improvement of<br />
standards of living".<br />
The Prices and Incomes Accord between the Federal Government<br />
and the trade union movement also spelt out an economic<br />
strategy to achieve social justice goals.<br />
Its success can be measured by the fact that under the<br />
Accord over one million jobs have been created in the<br />
Australian economy.<br />
That's one million Australians in work, providing for<br />
themselves, participating in a more fulfilling life one<br />
million people who would otherwise have been unemployed,<br />
unable to cope without assistance, excluded from the<br />
satisfaction of employment.<br />
our creation of one million new jobs means Australia has<br />
created jobs at a rate twice that of the rest of the western<br />
industrialised world and four times that of our<br />
conservative predecessors. </p>
<p>It has simply been a massive step forward in the enhancement<br />
of social justice in Australia.<br />
At the same time, the real wage restraint that helped create<br />
those one million new jobs has been compensated for by the<br />
Government in a variety of ways.<br />
we have restored Medicare,<br />
we have massively expanded child care places,<br />
we have extended care for the elderly in their own<br />
homes, we have improved education and training<br />
opportunities for young people,<br />
we have increased social welfare payments to those<br />
in greatest need such as the low-income and<br />
pensioner families who are now receiving the new<br />
Family Allowance Supplement,<br />
we have increased the age pension in real terms.<br />
our social justice strategy has been implemented following<br />
careful reviews of Government programs, including the Cass<br />
Social Security Review, the Kirby Report on training<br />
opportunities for young people and the Miller Report on<br />
Aboriginal employment initiatives.<br />
The report I am launching today provides a stocktake of all<br />
these developments and presents a comprehensive picture of<br />
the social justice initiatives we have taken.<br />
But it also recognises that there is more we can do and<br />
more we must do.<br />
Just as we recognise that building a more productive and<br />
competitive Australia will take time, so it is true that we<br />
can't build, overnight, a fairer and more just Australia.<br />
Too many Austrzrlians are still finding it hard to make ends<br />
meet. Too many children are enduring the deprivation of poverty.<br />
Too many people are unemployed for too long.<br />
Not enough young Australians are completing school.<br />
There is still more to be done to address the legitimate<br />
needs of the Aboriginal people.<br />
To meet such problems, the report Towards a Fairer Australia<br />
spells out the&amp; Government's future policy dir'ection_ s for the<br />
further enhancement of social justice in Australia.<br />
Let me summarise them now. 006174 </p>
<p>4.<br />
The maintenance and improvement of living standards depends<br />
on what happens to three things: wages, taxes and prices.<br />
We are confident that our poli cies will deliver in each of<br />
these areas.<br />
Our argument at the next National Wage Case, our<br />
introduction of significant personal tax cuts in the life of<br />
this Parliament and our further reduction of inflation will<br />
lead first to the maintenance, and then the improvement, of<br />
real disposable incomes over the next year or two.<br />
We will continue to create jobs, so that the best means of<br />
avoiding poverty and hardship namely, employment can be<br />
available to as many Australians as possible.<br />
We will encourage and assist people who have been unemployed<br />
for long periods of time to break the cycle of unemployment,<br />
poverty and low self-esteem which is hampering their efforts<br />
to return to work.<br />
We will lift the proportion of young people who complete<br />
Year 12 schooling to 65 per cent by 1992.<br />
we will be making a special effort, starting in this our<br />
Bicentennial year, to recognise more fully the needs of the<br />
Aboriginal people.<br />
And we will provide the necessary level of Government<br />
assistance so that by 1990 no Australian child need live in<br />
poverty. The major reason why thousands of Australian kids have not<br />
been properly fed or clothed or sheltered or educated or<br />
sustained in good health and all these are the bitter<br />
fruits of poverty is not lack of care by their parents but<br />
simply lack of money and lack of access to services.<br />
That is why we have pledged ourselves to provide low income<br />
parents with tax-free cash payments large enough to lift<br />
their children out of poverty.<br />
The first instalment $ 22 a week for each child under 13<br />
and $ 28 a we7ek for those 13 to 15 has already been<br />
delivered. By 1990 we will lift the payments to the further benchmarks<br />
we have already set.<br />
That is why we have introduced the new Child Support scheme<br />
which will provide further help by extending secure, regular<br />
maintenance for children whose parents have separated.<br />
And that is why we will continue to supply the range of<br />
education, h-ealth and community services which families need<br />
especially poor families with children. 0 06G17 </p>
<p>It saddened me that, in response to the greatest assault<br />
ever made by any Government on the ugly blot of child<br />
poverty, our political opponents and others have only bean<br />
able to trivialise our commitment.<br />
That response shows an intellectual poverty.<br />
But basically, it did not surprise me.<br />
Because in none of the areas of social justice policy that I<br />
have outlined today have the Opposition got anything<br />
positive to offer.<br />
Where Labor recognised the need for restraint and sacrifice,<br />
but ensured that the burden of restraint and sacrifice was<br />
borne by all sections. of the community, our political<br />
opponents would make Australia a less fair place.<br />
They witness a society becoming fairer and they propose to<br />
turn the clock back.<br />
They witness a fair tax system and would make it unfair<br />
again by abolishing the capital gains tax and the fringe<br />
benefits tax.<br />
They are considering embracing a consumption tax which would<br />
send inflation through the roof and which would increase the<br />
cost of virtually every item you buy without any<br />
safeguards or compensations for the least well off.<br />
Theirs is a formula for social injustice.<br />
It is also a strategy of economic shortsightedness.<br />
Because there are two reasons why the Australian Government<br />
must pursue social justice.<br />
one is because it is the compassionate, decent thing to do.<br />
Australians have always tried to help their fellow citizens<br />
when they are in need.<br />
But in the 190,0s, at a time when priorities have to be<br />
weighed carefully and set firmly, and when the community's<br />
resources have r to be focused as never before on vital<br />
national goals, the case for social justice becomes even<br />
more compelling.<br />
It becomes, in fact, an essential element in national<br />
survival.<br />
Because there can be no social progress without social<br />
justice. Social justice should be pursued because it is in the<br />
. national inteiest to do so. f) r . V 1 G </p>
<p>When people are unemployed, living in poverty, or prevented<br />
by discrimination from taking their rightful place in<br />
society, that is a tragedy for the individuals concerned.<br />
But it is a tragedy for the rest of us as well.<br />
Because we are all the poorer as a society when any one of<br />
us is unable to contribute fully to the productive effort of<br />
the nation.<br />
But if we are able to create jobs, reduce poverty, prevent<br />
discrimination, we will all be the richer.<br />
That is why Labor is proud of its social justice<br />
achievements and determined to pursue its social justice<br />
aspirations to create a more harmonious, a more just and a<br />
more prosperous Australia. S1I-i<br />
