SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING, NP~<br />
ANNIVERSARY OF AUSTRALIA HOUSE<br />
LONDON 17 SEPTEMBER 1993<br />
it is a great honour to welcome you here to commemorate<br />
the 75th anniversary of this most famous Australian<br />
institution Australia House. I<br />
For once at least-the word " historic" can be used without<br />
the risk of exaggeration or cliche.<br />
For this building has played a unique and remarkable role<br />
in Australia's modern history, and in the history of our<br />
relationship with Great Britain.<br />
Australia House was built during a dramatic and-defining<br />
moment in Australia's evolution as a nation, the First<br />
World war.<br />
It has stood through the Second World War; through the<br />
growth of Australia from an all but infant nation,<br />
through all the changes in our association with Whitehall<br />
from the Statute of Westminster in 1932 to the<br />
Australia Act of 1986 through the growth to maturity of<br />
our relationship with the United Kingdom.<br />
This is not only the oldest Australian overseas mission,<br />
it is also the oldest diplomatic mission building in<br />
London. The architects who designed it were Scottish;<br />
the materials, English stone combined with Australian<br />
marble and timber all of it highlighted by the works of<br />
Australian painters and sculptors.<br />
The building was opened by His Majesty King George V<br />
before an audience which. included a quite extraordinary<br />
gallery of Australians the Prime Minister, William<br />
Morris Hughes, former Prime Ministers Andrew Fisher and<br />
Joseph Cook, and our greatest General Sir John Monash. 1903 </p>
<p>2<br />
In opening the building, the King said:<br />
it will not only serve those useful purposes for<br />
which it was designed, but will also call to mind<br />
f or all those who pass by the immense opportunities<br />
and limitless resources of the great continent under<br />
the Southern Cross. I<br />
And of course this is precisely what Australia House has<br />
been in the seventy-five years since: the Australian<br />
promotion house; the place that issuied the passports; f or<br />
countless thousands of British people, the first contact<br />
with the country they made their home not to say, a<br />
reminder of home for thousands of Australians living in<br />
or visiting Britain.<br />
Those British migrants were told in various terms over<br />
the years that Australia was indeed a land of unrivalled<br />
opportunity and vast resources. There were politicians<br />
in those days who imagined that by this stage in our<br />
history Australia would be supporting a population in<br />
excess of 100 million with an economy the size of the<br />
United States.<br />
Yet, if these predictions have turned out to be a little<br />
inflated, the fact remains that the human opportunities<br />
Australia has provided are beyond measure, that those<br />
opportunities still exist and, in my view at least,<br />
there is still no better place on earth to live.<br />
Indeed, it is a very much better place now than it was in<br />
1918, or 1948, or 1958, or at any other time in our<br />
history. Better for many reasons.<br />
Better for the principles Australians have stuck to down<br />
the years and the traditions they have developed which<br />
continue to underpin the social and political ethos of<br />
Australia: principles and traditions of democracy and<br />
fairness which, translated into policy, make Australia in<br />
the 1990s one of the truly advanced democracies in the<br />
world. Better also because Australians have not interpreted all<br />
their traditions as immutable and inviolable. So<br />
Australia in the 1990s is much broader, much more open,<br />
more tolerant, more diverse infinitely richer because<br />
new generations of Australians chose to welcome settlers<br />
not just from the United tKingdom, but from all the<br />
countries of the world.<br />
1904 </p>
<p>And better because, like our population, our economy is<br />
part of the world economy. And particularly because it<br />
is part of the most rapidly growing, and assuredly moat<br />
promising region in the world the Asia-Pacific. So<br />
immense are the opportunities there, the words of King<br />
George V hold truer now than they did when he spoke them<br />
here at Australia House seventy-five years ago.<br />
Necessarily, with these developments in the composition<br />
of the Australian people and their society, and the<br />
aspirations and imperatives facing the Australian nation,<br />
a new sense of identity will emerge.<br />
And if we give expression to it through the reform of<br />
those institutions which were appropriate and effective<br />
in the past but not so appropriate and effective now, we<br />
will be that much stronger.<br />
Let me say here in London, as I have said many times in<br />
Australia it is not because our affections for Great<br />
Britain are reduced, or the friendship, between us<br />
frailer, or our respect and admiration for the culture<br />
and institutions Britain has bequeathed us in any way<br />
diminished, that now, in this last decade of our first<br />
century as a nation, we are considering the option of<br />
becoming a republic.<br />
It is not because the machinery is brokeni that we wish to<br />
change it. It is because a great many Australians in<br />
all likelihood a Zaligrity of Australians believe the<br />
machinery is no longer the most appropriate.<br />
I believe the Australian Government believes that<br />
most of the people of Great Britain, if they were asked<br />
about the issue, would agree with us. I believe they<br />
would find it unexceptional and inoffensive that<br />
Australians should consider taking this step at this<br />
stage of their history.<br />
Indeed, I am quite convinced that were Australians to<br />
choose the republican option, this expression of their<br />
identity which has inevitably changed so much in the past<br />
century, our friendship with Great Britain would be<br />
stronger, as any friendship is stronger for being more<br />
mature. But the decision on this will be made by the Australian<br />
People. It can 2aJ be made by the Australian people:<br />
the people descended, as mine are, from these islands,<br />
and those from all the countries of Europe, and the<br />
Mtiddle East and Asia and-throughout the world.<br />
I find it very hard to believe that if Australians decide<br />
that their country shauld be in future a Federal Republic<br />
Of Australia, anyone of good faith in this country will<br />
not consider it a wise judgement as well as a democratic<br />
onle. 1.905 </p>
<p>4<br />
And let me take this opportunity to say that we<br />
appreciate the way Prime Minister Major and his<br />
government have handled this issue.<br />
The Prime Minister echoed my own comments when he said<br />
earlier this year that each of our two countries had been<br />
" driven by the imperatives of geography, economic<br />
interest, social change and political vocation to give a<br />
new priority to its region", that this is " perfectly<br />
natural" and constitutes no threat to the strength of our<br />
friendship, the memory of shared experience or the future<br />
of our exceedingly healthy and flourishing trade and<br />
diplomatic links.<br />
What we are talking about is a new relationship as I<br />
said, a mature relationship.<br />
And I think that maturity was perfectly expressed by the<br />
British Foreign Secretary in Australia earlier this week<br />
when he said that the matter of the republic is one<br />
between " the Government, people, Parliament of Australia<br />
and the Queen of Australia", and that the relationship<br />
between us is one between " two modern countries, with a<br />
great deal of shared modern interest" and should remain<br />
quite unaffected by our discussion about the republic.<br />
And that is what will happen, I am sure. The issue is<br />
complex and sensitive and cannot be rushed. In theI<br />
meantime friendship and commerce between Great Britain<br />
and Australia will continue to grow.<br />
I consider it an immense privilege to stand here today in<br />
a place steeped in the history of our two countries, anI<br />
organic part of the relationship between us, and a place<br />
with which surely millions of Australians have had some<br />
connection. It is a privilege because this building, and the peopleI<br />
who have worked here, have played a dynamic role in<br />
Australia's nationhood. Australia House has always been,<br />
by its nature, a contributor to the growth and<br />
development of Australia.<br />
So it seems to me particularly appropriate that on this<br />
all too brief visit to Great Britain I should be able to<br />
make this the occasion for these remarks.<br />
I thank all those who have made this occasion possible<br />
and all of you who have come along today.<br />
