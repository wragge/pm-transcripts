FOR MEDIA WEDNESDAY JUNE 23 1982<br />
VISIT TO MALAYSIA<br />
I shall be visiting Malaysia from 2 to 4 August in response<br />
to an invita~ tion extended to me by the Prime Minister of<br />
Malaysia, DEato Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad.<br />
Australia's relations with Malaysia are long standing and<br />
important. They cover mutual interests in the. region and<br />
a wide range of activities including trade and Malaysian<br />
students in Australia. Malaysia is a member of the Association<br />
of the South East Asian Nations to which Australia attaches<br />
high priority.<br />
Malaysia and Australia have a common concern for the peace<br />
and security of South East Asia, a region which encompasses<br />
vital Australian interests.<br />
I am looking forward to my discussions with the Malaysian<br />
Prime Minister and to hearing at first hand about the<br />
policies of the new Malaysian Government. The visit will<br />
provide an opportunity to discuss the further development<br />
of bilateral relations as well as important regional and<br />
international developments of mutual interest. </p>
