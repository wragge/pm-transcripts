MACQUARIE NETWORK WEEKLY BROADCAST<br />
BY THE PRI111 MINISTER4 THE RT. HON.<br />
WILLIAM McMAHON, CH, MP.<br />
OVERSEAS INVESTMENT IN AUSTRALIA 27 SEPTEMBER 1972<br />
Interviewer Paul Lynch<br />
Q. Prime Minister, there has been much agitation in<br />
Australia, of course, over the last year about foreign<br />
takeovers. It has been suggested that some of the takeovers<br />
of the past year have not been in the interests of this country.<br />
Do you feel that that is so?<br />
PM: Many of them, in my opinion, have not been in the best<br />
interests of Australia, or perhaps I could put it differently.<br />
Attempts, in many cases, have not been in the interests of<br />
Australia. And I personally intervened in those cases to fire<br />
a shot across their bows to stop the takeovers taking place<br />
until I was able to introduce legislation into the House.<br />
Q. Which cases would they have been, Prime Minister?<br />
PM: Well I mentioned them before and it created a bit of a<br />
furore, but I didn't like the idea of , e International Telegraph<br />
and Telephone Company taking over Fresh Foods. That was one<br />
example. And while they might not have been directly influenced<br />
by political consieeratons, they must in some respects have been<br />
influenced by them and the takeover didn't take place.<br />
Q. Now, with the announcement of this new Board, this<br />
independent Board, hiow exactly would a foreign company wanting<br />
to take over an Australian company have to approach it to the<br />
Board?<br />
PM: First, the company attempting to make the takeover could<br />
notify the Goverr: ient, or could notify its intention publicly.<br />
As soon as that w.-is done, we would refer the matter to the<br />
independent authority and we would give them a timetable within<br />
which they would have to make r commendations to the Government.<br />
They would make their report and the Government would then decide<br />
what action it should take, either to prevent the takeover<br />
completely or tD take some other kind of remedial action. Until<br />
the act is passed and we have 3stablished this independent<br />
authority, the Government will do exactly the same as the<br />
independent aut: hority would do, but this occasion we would<br />
be advised by a: i interdepartmei. tal committee. / 2 </p>
<p>Q. As '-understand it, Prime-Minister, you do not fntend<br />
to stop all foreign -takeovers. Youhave to chart a course<br />
between the ones which you think are acceptable gxthe ones<br />
which you think are not acceptable. How wil-ou chart that<br />
course?<br />
PM: That is correct. Your statement is correct. But it is<br />
a kind of a syncopation of what we have-done. We have set out<br />
guidelines and there are about ten of them that have to be<br />
complied with. If they are not in the public interest,<br />
manifestly not in the public interest, and there are other<br />
qualifications that cannot be met, then we will prevent the<br />
takeover. But if it is felt that the qualificatins can be<br />
met, a recommendation can be made accordingly, and we will<br />
look at it and it will be for the Government to make the<br />
final decision.<br />
Q. Sir, you as Prime Minister, and Prime Ministers over the<br />
last few years have said that the inflow of foreign investment<br />
capital into Australia, in some cases takeover capital, is a<br />
good thing. Do you still feel this?<br />
PM: Yes, I do, because circumstances can change so quickly.<br />
At the moment we don't need large amounts of overseas capital<br />
in the way we needed it say, two, three, four, five years ago.<br />
But you can never tell when circumstances will change again<br />
and we may need it again. Under present circumstances, we<br />
would like, if we think it is in the nation's intzrosts, to<br />
reduce the quantity of the flow into Australia and we are<br />
attempting to do sc.<br />
Q. Sir, do you feel that any takeovers that there have been<br />
in the last few years, without n. aming n. ms, are takeovers<br />
which have damaged Australia?<br />
PM: I couldn't say " damaged" in an economic sense, because<br />
they have brought know-how, and they have permitted the<br />
Australians who have been the investors in the taken-over<br />
company to be able to invest their money somewhere else. But<br />
I don't think that is the point today. The point today is<br />
that we have an abundance of overseas reserves and, much more<br />
importantly, Australians want to own Australian companies and<br />
they want an increasing share of ownership in overseas<br />
cornorations. I think it is this attitude of Australianism<br />
that is of vital importance to us now.<br />
Q. Sir, can you see a situation in % hich you might in the<br />
future adopt a practice or the board might adopt a practice<br />
which has been recommended by various authorities which would<br />
be that foreign comipanies would be allowed to buy in to Australia<br />
but they would not be allowed to control what they buy in?<br />
PM: Yes, we would have no exception to them buying in, and<br />
in fact, the law will provide that they can have a shareholding<br />
of up to 15 per cent without it being regarded as a takeover.<br />
Or, if there are a number of corporations involved, they could<br />
have up to 40 per cent without it being regarded as a takeover.<br />
So we are not excluding them completely and for all time.<br />
We will set out in the legislation the conditions under which<br />
they can have a shareholding in Australian companies.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, thank you very much. </p>
