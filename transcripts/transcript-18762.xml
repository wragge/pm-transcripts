    <content><![CDATA[<p>Sydney</p>
<p>Prime Minister Julia Gillard and Treasurer Wayne Swan today announced that Sydney will host a G20 Finance Ministers' and Central Bank Governors' meeting in 2014.</p>
<p>As an iconic Australian city and a dynamic business and financial centre, Sydney is an ideal host city for Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors from around the world. </p>
<p>The G20 brings together Leaders, Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors from major developing and advanced economies to address critical economic and financial challenges facing the world.</p>
<p>Along with the G20 Finance Ministers' meeting that will take place in Cairns, this meeting will do important preparatory work for the G20 Leaders' Meeting to be held in Brisbane.</p>
<p>Members of the G20 account for 85 per cent of global GDP, 80 per cent of global trade, and most of Australia's major trading and investment partners.</p>
<p>Chairing the G20 Finance Ministers' and Central Bank Governors' meetings in 2014 will help us shape a global economic agenda which promotes Australia's values.</p>
<p>The Sydney G20 Finance Ministers' and Central Bank Governors' meeting will attract up to 2,000 delegates and support staff, including international media, putting Sydney in the international spotlight.</p>
<p>This will be a complex event to organise and the Commonwealth will be working closely with the NSW Government to deliver a successful meeting.</p>
<p>It is fantastic that during the G20 host year not only will we be showcasing regional Australia by hosting a Finance Ministers' and Central Bank Governors' meeting in Cairns, but we will also showcase the vibrancy, culture and iconic attractions of Sydney to a global audience. </p>
<p>The dates for these meetings are still to be finalised.</p>
