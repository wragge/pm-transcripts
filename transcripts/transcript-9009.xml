SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
REMARKS FOR REPLY TO ADDRESS OF WELCOME<br />
COMMONWEALTH HEADS OF GOVERNMENT MEETING, NICOSIA<br />
THURSDAY 21 OCTOBER 1993<br />
President Clerides, Your Majesties, Excellencies, fellowi Heads of Government,<br />
Ministers, Secretary-General, Ladies and Gentlemen.<br />
It is a great pleasure and honour for me to be invited tc join my colleagues in thanking<br />
you, Mr President, for your welcome to this Commonwealth Heads of Government<br />
meeting. I am happy to see many familiar faces as I look around this room. I met some of you,<br />
fellow members of the South Pacific Forum, recently oil Nauru, the smallest of all the<br />
Commonwealth's fifty members and associates.<br />
I am also looking forward to meeting others over the nfiXt five days.<br />
For a newcomer to these gatherings, the diversity of the~ group is the most striking<br />
thing about it.<br />
The members of the Commonwealth come from every continent and border every<br />
ocean. We are large and small, developed and developing, a very representative<br />
sample of the community of nations.<br />
The Commonwealth gains strength from its diversity, bu-cause its differences co-exist<br />
with important things we hold in common the principl,-s and practices of our law,<br />
administration and education; a shared commitment to democracy; a language even if<br />
often a second language in which we can conimunicatt. directly with one another.<br />
In one important sense, an Australian Prime Minister fe,'-ls immediately at home in a<br />
Commonwealth meeting. Australia's population today includes citizens who came<br />
originally from each of the forty eight countries represeaited here.<br />
Our rich multicultural society drawn from more than 140 nations is a great asset for<br />
Australia, just as cultural diversity gives the Commonw! alth its own distinct and lively<br />
identity. </p>
<p>Mr President,<br />
Australia like many countries has been going through a period of profound change.<br />
We have been retooling our economy and reexamining ithe fundamentals of our society.<br />
Our economy has been changing at an unprecedented rmte, moving from an inwardlooking<br />
economy to one focused outwards.<br />
We have moved from feeling somewhat remotely connected with our own region to a<br />
commitment to economic, political and cultural engagement with our neighbours.<br />
We have been debating the forms of our own constitution to have it reflect better our<br />
national identity.<br />
And just before I left Australia, my Government put in place the framework for historic<br />
legislation which will provide greater justice for Australia's indigenous population by<br />
recogni sing their original tenure of our land.<br />
We have accepted that Aboriginal or native tradition and culture is a source of<br />
Australian common law.<br />
Australia is not alone in facing change.<br />
Many of the countries represented here are undergoing economic and social changes of<br />
similar magnitude. These changes reflect and respond to profound changes taking<br />
place in the wider world.<br />
The Commonwealth itself is not exempt from this process of change. Like every other<br />
organisation, it needs constantly to re-examine itself to ensure that it is directing its<br />
activities where they are most useful and deploying its resources where they are most<br />
effective. It should not duplicate what others can do better, but u ie its distinctive advantages<br />
creatively and well.<br />
Mr President,<br />
Some of the issues which we will discuss over the next five days will be new, some will<br />
be old, some will come in different form.<br />
One which is different is South Afica. The political change there is cause for great<br />
satisfaction, despite continuing problems and obstacles.<br />
The Commonwealth has had an important part to play in encouraging that change. We<br />
need now to look for practical ways to help South Afiicans to entrench it. </p>
<p>All of us hope that at our next meeting we will have tile pleasure -of welcoming the<br />
H-ead of Government of a non-racial, democratic Souith Africa as a new member of the<br />
Commonwealth.<br />
I offer my congratulations to Mr Nelson Mandela and President De Klerk on the award<br />
of the Nobel Peace Prize. It is a fitting reward, not just for them but for all those who<br />
have had the courage to negotiate and work together in the interests of creating a new<br />
South Africa.<br />
Other issues will engage us at this meeting.<br />
The challenges of development, remembering I hat more than half our<br />
Commonwealth members qualify as least-deveoped or low income countries<br />
The ways in which we can better use the talents of women and young people to<br />
enrich our societies and economies<br />
The ways we can strengthen the role of democratic institutions and practices,<br />
as the Commonwealth has been successfu~ lly doing with its election monitoring.<br />
One of the major challenges facing the world at present is the need to bring to a<br />
successful conclusion the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations by the mid-December<br />
deadline. Nothing would do more to increase world trade and expand the opportunities for<br />
growth of all countries, developing and developed alik,.<br />
It would mean a boost to the world economy of 213 billion US dollars a year.<br />
The time is very short for us to prevent the Round's collapse.<br />
Some " rich countries" still seem to believe that they cani avoid making difficult<br />
concessions, but still reap the advantages of the Round.<br />
I think they are completely wrong and are Riely to witar the opprobrium and<br />
contumely of the whole world.<br />
It is important that this meeting make every effort to examine what the Commonwealth<br />
can do to help bring about an outcome from the Multilateral Trade Negotiations that<br />
will benefit each of us, and the world at large.<br />
Finally, Mr President, I want to say something about the special pleasure for an<br />
Australian Prime Minister in being here in Cyprus.<br />
More than 50,000 Australians have their family origins in Cyprus, giving Australia the<br />
world's second-largest Cypriot community after this island.<br />
Australian Cypriots have been an enormously energetic and creative community.<br />
Among their contributions to Australian life, has been cne of my colleagues in the<br />
Parliamentary Labor Party, Dr Andrew Theophanous, wvho left Cyprus at the age of<br />
eight. </p>
<p>4<br />
Our meeting in this city, Mr President, is a reminder that the division of this island,<br />
with all the human tragedy that has entailed, has continued for far too long.<br />
Australian police, whom I met this morning, have beer! helping to keep the peace in<br />
Cyprus since 1964. Their task should have ended long; ago.<br />
We urge those who are not cooperating with the United Nations and its Secretary-<br />
General in exploring a basis for settlement to enter intc constructive negotiations<br />
forthwith. Thank you for your very warm welcome this morning. Like all of us here, I am<br />
looking forward to five days of constructive deliberaticns as well as five days of<br />
Cypriot hospitality. </p>
