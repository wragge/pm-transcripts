PRM MINISTER<br />
CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
AUSTRALIAN FINANCZAL REVIEW LUNCHEON<br />
OTHE THIRD HAWRE GOVERNMENTO<br />
BRISBANU 16 JUNE 1987<br />
When I announced last month that Parliament was to be<br />
dissolvod prior to an election on 11 July, I said that<br />
" Australia's greatest need is certainty, stability and<br />
continuity". Events since then have only confirmed the accuracy of that<br />
statement and have only strengthened my conviction that the<br />
Labor Govornment alone offers those vital ingredients to our<br />
future prosperity.<br />
in particular, the release of the Opposition's tax policies<br />
has undi'lined those sentiments.<br />
Today z want to highlight some of the holes that emarga, day<br />
by day, 2n that tax poiicy<br />
But I also want to take this opportunity of outlining to you<br />
what I see as the broad goals of a Third Hawke Government.<br />
It is a story in which those qualities of certainty,<br />
stability and continuity are paramount a strategy which<br />
addrescec the real, as opposed to the illusory, challenges<br />
facing this nation as it enters the 1990' s.<br />
It should be apparent by now that, unlike the Opposition, we<br />
are not in the business of jeopardising our achievements<br />
through reckless campaign promises.<br />
There is no disputing that Australia cannot indefinitely<br />
seek to naintain standards by borrowing from abroad at the<br />
rate that we have been.<br />
We can roduce our dependence on external financing only by a<br />
combination of lower consumption and higher investment in<br />
the production of exports and import replacing goods.<br />
The key to that is sustained fiscal restraint. And that<br />
does not just mean restraint in government spending.<br />
Fundamentally it means progressively smaller budget deficits<br />
as a share of GDP, to reduce the public sector's call on<br />
savings. </p>
<p>2.<br />
This is a , reality which has informed Labor's approach to<br />
fiscal policy for some time. It will remain the central<br />
feature of the third Hawke Government for as long as<br />
economic conditions require it.<br />
But what of our opponents?<br />
Last week John Howard unveiled the Liberals' now tax policy.<br />
It is a campaign policy in the truest sense of the word it<br />
did not exist before the campaign.<br />
it is economic madness and political cynicism.<br />
For the third time in ten years John Howard has acquiesced<br />
in a budgot-blowing grab for power based on illusory tax<br />
cuts. In 1977, tho Liberals offered a fistful of dollars and as<br />
Treasurer, John Howard promptly withdrew them after the<br />
election, putting in their place a retrospective tax<br />
increase. in 1982, with John Howard still as Treasurer, the Liberals<br />
blew out the deficit to pay for an unaffordable program of<br />
election promizes. That loft us with a legacy og a<br />
billion budget deficit some 5 to 5 1/ 2 per cent of GDP.<br />
N~ ow, in 1907, consiatent with his five year cycle of<br />
cynicism, ho is trying again to buy votes with tax promiisor.<br />
in the oi days since it was launched, however, the real<br />
facts of John Howard's tax policy have gradually come to<br />
light.<br />
We know nowy that when Mr Howard said a 20 percent tax rate<br />
for persons earning $ 20,000 or so, he really meant<br />
38 percent.<br />
We know now that when he talked about cracking down on tax<br />
fraud he re( ally meant restoring the rorts for the privileged<br />
and opening up a gap between business and personal tax<br />
rates, both of which erode the tax base.<br />
We know now that when he talked of cuts in the health area<br />
he really aant increased costs for all families:<br />
You would still pay the Medicare levy; you would also have<br />
to pay up to $ 250 a year extra; hospital insurance premiums<br />
would go up; and Medicare would be dismantled.<br />
We knowy now that when he said that outlay savings would be<br />
billion, he has not the slightest intention of telling<br />
the people where cuts would be made because he knows that<br />
the nature o! the required cuts is such that they could not<br />
be made.<br />
Indeed, Hr Carlton, the Shadow Treasurer, has admitted as<br />
much, on television on Sunday night, when he said: </p>
<p>3.<br />
" The reason why we're not giving what you might call a<br />
detailed hit lict for over twenty departments is that we<br />
would alert every single pressure group in the country"<br />
Mr Carlton knows that the required outlays cuts cannot be<br />
delivered. In short, Er 1oward is concealing a deficit which on an<br />
interpretation which is generous to the Liberals, is at<br />
least $ 8 billion higher than he is claiming.<br />
As MaA Walsh wrote in the Sydney Morning Herald last week,<br />
John Howard pretends he can pay for tax cuts by slashing<br />
government sv) ending to a degree unprecedented in the<br />
inductrialisred world.<br />
Anyone who has been through the gruelling and assiduous<br />
process of the May Statement would appreciate the fact that<br />
saying you will find billions of dollars of savings is<br />
considerably easier than actually finding them.<br />
we have shown where the sacrifices are to fall we have<br />
shown our hand in the difficult question of spending cuts.<br />
The August budget contains no further horrors.<br />
We have steadily, consistently, done the job the nation<br />
required of us.<br />
We inheritc a deficit of 5 to 5 1/ 2 percent of GDP. This<br />
year we have it down to about 1 1/ 2 percent and our May<br />
Statement initiatives will allow a further fall to less<br />
than I perco: nt in 1987-80.<br />
It took unpTecedented and sustained fiscal restraint to<br />
achieve tizose reductions.<br />
And they we: e achieved while also making room for tax cuts<br />
worth cone $ 4 1/ 2 billion to Australian families or<br />
per week to the person on average earnings.<br />
They are real tax cuts affordable, paid for, and already<br />
delivere6T-The contrast between our record and their<br />
pronices could not be clearer.<br />
The price cf John Howard's $ 8 billion credibility gap on<br />
taxes would be a falling dollar, massively higher interest<br />
rates, the reacceleration of inflation and prolonged<br />
uncertainty for business.<br />
Mr Howard talks long and often 6f the need to provide<br />
incentive. But where is the incentive to business in such a<br />
prospect? Where is the fairness to families?<br />
Australia√∏ 3 chance to claw back its place in the world and<br />
restore its living standards through sustainable economic<br />
growth lies with reconstruction of the economy. That chance<br />
would be irreparably derailed if the Opposition's tax cuts<br />
were seriously attempted. </p>
<p>Four years ago, I made the Australian people a promise on<br />
behalf of the Australian Labor Party.<br />
That promise was to bring national reconciliation to what<br />
had become under the Liberals a divided and discordant<br />
society; to bring about national economic recovery in a<br />
nation suffering its worst recession in 50 years; and to<br />
achieve reconstruction of an economy which was poorly<br />
equipped to compete in the world's markets.<br />
No more telling statistic of our record in achieving<br />
national reconciliation can be quoted than this: under<br />
Labor, strike days lost have declined by a massive<br />
percent.<br />
And our success in achieving national recovery was also<br />
clear. In hr Howard's last year in office the economy contracted.<br />
One quarter of a million people were thrown on the<br />
unenployie. zt scrap heap.<br />
Labor's economic recovery has been so strong and sustained<br />
that some 3/ 4 million jobs have been created. That reflects<br />
the fact that each year jobs growth has averaged almost four<br />
times the rate of the Coalition when last they were in<br />
Office. Unemployment is down to 8.2 percent compared to the 10.5<br />
percent c. t about the time we came to office.<br />
Though eri' 2. yment growth has zenained strong, economic<br />
growth slowzd a little through the middle of 1986 and<br />
necessari. ly so if we were to give ourselves a breathing<br />
space to allow the current account to begin to turn around.<br />
But the signs are now unmistakable that growth is picking<br />
up, in lin') with the improvement in the balance of payments.<br />
What is most pleasing is that the main engine of this<br />
recovery io the external sector.<br />
The externl sector has accounted for virtually all of<br />
economic growth in 1986-87. It is also expected to<br />
contribute substantially in 1987-88.<br />
That is pzecisely what is required to cure our balance of,<br />
payments problem precisely what is required to continue to<br />
deliver sustained growth in jobs and living standards for<br />
all Australian families.<br />
In other iords, the evidence is accumulating that our third<br />
goal national reconstruction is being achieved.<br />
Unlike the Liberals, who chose to ignore the warning signal<br />
of a modest fall in the terms of trade early in their last<br />
seven yea s period in office, we knew from day one that<br />
Australia's long term prosperity was at risk because of the<br />
inadequaclos of its manufacturing and service sectors. </p>
<p>we knew that Australian industry had to bqcome more<br />
diversified, more competitive, more attuned to the realities<br />
of world trade, more able to survive the steady shift of the<br />
world trading focus away from our traditional commodity<br />
exportG, more capable of finding niches in the emerging<br />
markets in manufactured goods and services.<br />
Labor sut about putting in place the policies that would<br />
encourage Australian industry to restructure, permit<br />
Australian workers to become more productive, and allow<br />
Australia to perform to its real economic potential.<br />
We never pretended that the task would be easy.<br />
Nor die, we suggest that it would be achieved quickly.<br />
But we knew that, if a start was not made immediately, the<br />
task would overwhelm the nation.<br />
And the start we have made, together as a nation, is a solid<br />
one. Let me pay a special tribute to John Button, who as Minister<br />
for Industry, Technology and Commerce has played a loading<br />
role in kormulating the most far-sighted and comprehensive<br />
package ol' industry policies that this nation has seen cind<br />
in negotiating its implementation.<br />
IndustriOG which just a couple of years ago were either<br />
stagnating within confined domestic boundaries, or were<br />
facing ruin, have blossomed.<br />
The revitalisation of the finance sector is one instance,<br />
though perhaps the most celebrated is the steel industry.<br />
Labor's i.. iitiative in co-operation with the management and<br />
unions con~ cerned brought this industry back Zrom the brink<br />
of closure to the position where it is now amongst the most<br />
cost ef~ icient in the world.<br />
Labor has progressively reformed our most highly protected,<br />
our most insular industries: chemicals, motor vehicles,<br />
textile3 clothing and footwear, heavy engineering and<br />
shipbuilding.<br />
Labor apreciates the importance of a high level of<br />
investment to Australia's economic reconstruction. Economic<br />
policy is being conducted to maximise the environment for<br />
business investment.<br />
It was announced two years ago that the investment allowance<br />
would be phased out by 30 June this year. However, some<br />
companies have experienced difficulties in completing<br />
projects in time to qualify for the allowance. Accordingly,<br />
the Government has decided to give an extension of time to<br />
the end of this calendar year to put investment in place in<br />
order to cualify for the investment allowance. </p>
<p>6.<br />
Labor has paid particular attention to policies to encourage<br />
innovation and skills formation. Australia was being left<br />
behind in the world markets for new products and processes.<br />
Our most abundant resource, the skills of our work force,<br />
was being squandered.<br />
The 150 per cent tax incentives for research and<br />
development, which leads the world, has been eminently<br />
successful. To quote just one example, I was in Perth on<br />
the weekend at the research establishment run by Ralph<br />
Sarich, one oT the largest recipients of this assistance.<br />
They are world loaders in their field and are already<br />
signing up foreign buyers for their technological advances.<br />
Because of the incentive, business expenditure on research<br />
and development in 1986-87 is expected to be $ 1.25 billion<br />
treble its 1933-84 level.<br />
The Liberals have not said what fate will befall this<br />
concession. The third Haw! te Government will continue to give high<br />
priority to te need to foster new and innovative products:<br />
from communications to high-tech to agriculture.<br />
To meet a wor. d characterised by constant structural change<br />
and fierce cooet ition, Australia needs a skilled and<br />
adaptable worfforce. Labor has embarked on a full scale<br />
effort to ensure that we have the skilled workforce capable<br />
of meeting thiat need. We have introduced programs:<br />
to encourage our young people to stay at school longer;<br />
to lift the quality of our education system and make it<br />
more relevant to their needs and the needs of industry;<br />
and to give young people constructive opportunities and<br />
incentives to opt for work or training rather than the<br />
dole.<br />
It is particularly pleasing to me to note the success of<br />
these program3. Under Labor's policies the retention rate<br />
for students in Years 11 and 12 has been increased from<br />
36 per cent to almost 50 per cent. As a result some 39,000<br />
young people have chosen to stay on at school who, had the<br />
Coalition's policies continued, would have left before<br />
completing their secondary education.<br />
But Labor is going further. We want to ensure that skills<br />
formation does not stop at the school gate. In the May<br />
Statement it was announced that some $ 32 million has been<br />
set aside for additional training programs in 1987-88,<br />
rising to $ 63 million in 1988-89. In conjunction with the<br />
other initiatives which this Government has already taken,<br />
this will double the allocation to post-school training<br />
under Labor. </p>
<p>But until John Howard announces otherwise, training programs<br />
must be considered as under threat from the Liberals' stated<br />
plan if elected, to cut some $ 2.5 billion from government<br />
progranis. One area which John Howard has specifically singled out for<br />
the elimination, however, is export assistance. Both the<br />
Export Market Development Grants Scheme and Austrade are<br />
slated to be cut by Nr Howard.<br />
In what is an extraordinarily visionless statement by the<br />
Liberals, this would have to be one of the most short<br />
sighted suggestions of all.<br />
I can cnly whole-heartedly endorse the recent statement of<br />
Daryl George, Chief Executive of the Confederation of<br />
Australian Industry:<br />
" Stability and certainty in the formation and implementation<br />
of industry policies are crucial. Industry assistance<br />
policies must therefore be allowcd to run their course.<br />
Export assistance programs are particularly valuable to<br />
small and medium sized businesses attempting to enter<br />
foreigri~ arkets.<br />
" Positive assistance measures such as export incentives, the<br />
150 per cent tax deduction for R&amp; D expenditure and bounties<br />
are investments in the long-term competitiveness of this<br />
nation.' What Australia desperately needs now is more exports.<br />
For companies, especially small companies, which have never<br />
exported or which are trying to break into new markets or<br />
new product lines, the task can be daunting indeed.<br />
The Export Market Development Grants scheme and Austrade<br />
give these exporters a vital helping hand when help is<br />
needed. That is why the third Hawke Government will retain them<br />
both. The third Hawke Government will continue to pursue the<br />
far-sichted industry policies needed to remove barriers to<br />
trade, improve our trade competitiveness and maximise our<br />
chances to become prosperous again through trade.<br />
Last September I convened a meeting between employers and<br />
the ACTU. The issue was how to disseminate to the<br />
enterprise level the message that work and management<br />
practices have to be reformed if we are to have any lasting<br />
improvement in living standards.<br />
The meeting produced an historic communique in which each<br />
side agreed that the need for change is urgent and agreed to<br />
work together to achieve that change. </p>
<p>The evidence is mounting that that message is being heard. X<br />
For example, employers are increasingly accepting the need<br />
to raise their commitment to worker training. Employees<br />
increasingly are coming to accept the need to become<br />
multi-skilhed, more flexible.<br />
All those ouccesses have been built on co-operation and<br />
consultation, in the context of the fairness and officioncy<br />
of the contr-lined wage fixing system.<br />
The history of industrial relations in this nation has shown<br />
that change . jill be faster, more effective and less costly<br />
if it is implemented cooperatively.<br />
Labor is pledged to continue the promotion of cooperative<br />
workplace reform through, for example, the Industrial<br />
Relations Bill.<br />
This Bill prcposes refinements to the existing system<br />
intended to improve its operation for all parties.<br />
However, ito original provisions concerning secondary<br />
boycotts, access to common law and the scale of monetary<br />
penalties bo: zime a source of conflict between the parties.<br />
This was inzoisistent with our original intentions in<br />
reforming tho existing arrangements.<br />
Accordingly, 2v Ralph Willis has announced, those provisions<br />
will not be reintroduced. Labor will retain the provisions<br />
of the existing legislation in each case.<br />
But where do our opponents stand on industrial relations?<br />
Quite simply, they would dismantle the industrial relations<br />
machinery which has worked so successfully for decades and<br />
replace it with the law of the jungle.<br />
Instead of ei-oible wage restraint they have consistently<br />
argued for the socially destructive and ultimately<br />
counterproductive bludgeon of the wage freeze and their tax<br />
policy is the latest proof of that.<br />
The Liberals hope to grab back most if not all of the<br />
benefits of their alleged tax cuts by denying workers access<br />
to the expected 1.5 per cent wage increase later this year.<br />
The Liberals hive argued for a wage freeze at 18 of the last<br />
wage casec. Why should workers expect them to change<br />
their tune in Government? What would be the cost to<br />
business of t inevitable dislocation which so<br />
short-sighted a policy could produce?<br />
And the LiberFJs have not, of course, reconciled the glaring<br />
inconsistency inherent in all that: how to impose a wage<br />
freeze after dismantling the centralised wage fixing system? </p>
<p>9.<br />
Labor wi. l continue to pursue wages policies which are<br />
consistent with sustained competitiveness and lower<br />
inflation. Labor does not believe that a wage freeze is<br />
either necessary or desirable to achieve these ends.<br />
The Oppovition's confrontationist tactics failed this<br />
country dismally, especially in 1981-1982. This nation<br />
cannot afford to have them wreak this kind of economic<br />
vandalisw_-again.<br />
A sensible, constructive wages policy and a responsible,<br />
restrained fiscal policy are essential to national<br />
reconstruction. Without them the nation can only balance<br />
its books through the self-destructing spiral induced by<br />
ever higher interest rates. That is not the way which Labor<br />
intendo for Australian business, or Australian families.<br />
Labor is offering Australia a clear choice.<br />
For the third Hawke Government, we offer the united team<br />
with the proven policies to see Australia through.<br />
We make Australian business and the Australian people tho<br />
promise ICat we will carry on the job of national<br />
reconstruction which we began 4 years ago.<br />
We don't ask you to trust us to meet a bevy of wildly<br />
improbab o promises. We don't promise feats of magic that<br />
no world leader either contemplated or has been able to<br />
perform.<br />
We simply ask you to judge us by our proven capacity to take<br />
the decisc ons necessary to continue the reconstruction of<br />
the Aus'Crcalian economy.<br />
The urg~ ln'y of that task makes John Howard's commitment to<br />
the pri-, i-,( y of tax cuts profoundly wrong, in economic and<br />
political terms.<br />
He has z: esorted to the oldest trick in the book tax cuts<br />
unsuppocted by hard details about where the money would come<br />
from.<br />
His wish i. s that the campaign be turned into an auction. He<br />
has fail" cA to understand that the campaign is, and must be,<br />
a test of credibility.<br />
That ic why he is now on the back foot because his<br />
policies znd his leadership are simply not credible.<br />
By contrast, we have built up our credibility over four<br />
years in office by telling the Australian people the truth<br />
about the economy, the bad news as well as the good by<br />
taking tha Australian people into our confidence about what<br />
was required to restore economic growth by calling on<br />
their com. T. onsense and their maturity in implementing those<br />
solutiono. </p>
<p>Australia car'iot risk putting those solutions at risk by<br />
changing horSc G in midstream.<br />
I have absolt: e faith in the maturity of the Australian<br />
electorato a~ nd absolute confidence that they will l0t Labor<br />
get on with the job of rebuilding this nation. Because only,<br />
Labor can do it. </p>
