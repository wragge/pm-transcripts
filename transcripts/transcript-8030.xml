SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
ADDRESS TO THE NEW SOUTH WALES STATE CONFERENCE<br />
OF THE AUSTRALIAN LABOR PARTY<br />
SYDNEY 10 JUNE 1990<br />
Delegates, Twelve months ago, when I last addressed this conference, I<br />
concluded my comments with a simple statement of fact.<br />
I had been saying how important it was for all Australians<br />
that Labor continue working, in Government, towards our<br />
overwhelming goal: our goal, in Ben Chifley's words, of<br />
seeing that all members of the community can enjoy a decent<br />
standard of living.<br />
I said that was a goal Labor must attain because in<br />
Australian politics, only Labor can attain it.<br />
And I concluded with this statement: " With your help, we<br />
will attain it".<br />
Delegates, With your help, we are attaining that goal.<br />
Because with your help your discipline, your restraint,<br />
your commitment, and your energy we won the election last<br />
March that so many said we were bound to lose.<br />
Australia stood at the crossroads.<br />
The Australian people faced the starkest of choices:<br />
a choice between two profoundly different<br />
political programs two utterly different visions<br />
for the future of Australia;<br />
a choice between the social safety net and the<br />
social trap door: Labor's determination to open<br />
further the opportunities of all Australians, and<br />
the conservatives' commitment to the reinstatement<br />
and entrenchment of privilege; </p>
<p>a choice between a coherent strategy Labor's<br />
clear way forward through the national and<br />
international challenges of our time and the<br />
conservative recipe for industrial confrontation,<br />
health chaos and fiscal irresponsibility;<br />
and it was a choice between Labor's experienced<br />
and united leadership team and the temporary<br />
alliance of convenience presented by a ramshackle<br />
Coalition.<br />
Delegates, the stakes were high for Australia and for all<br />
Australians. So at this, the first State Conference our Party has held<br />
since the Federal election let me say to all of you, and<br />
especially to the rank and file members, a heartfelt thanks<br />
for all your work in the lead-up to the campaign and on 24<br />
March. Quite simply, New South Wales was the solid rock on which<br />
the Federal victory was built.<br />
You successfully retained every Labor seat in the State.<br />
You beat off the challenge from the New Right in the seat of<br />
Phillip and I pay tribute to Jeanette McHugh for a great<br />
victory.<br />
You regained the sixth Senate seat, allowing Sue West to<br />
return once more to the Senate.<br />
And you didn't just hold your own. You pushed on, into<br />
conservative territory where Labor had literally never<br />
ventured with success before.<br />
I have to admit, when I made that call for " your help" this<br />
time last year, I didn't realise just how energetically and<br />
how successfully you would respond.<br />
For that matter, neither did Charles Blunt.<br />
For the record, Neville Newell is the first person since<br />
1929 to take a seat off an incumbent leader of a Federal<br />
party.<br />
And his victory in Richmond is Labor's first in this seat<br />
since Federation.<br />
But it won't be our last.<br />
With Harry Woods having also won a tremendous fighting<br />
victory in the seat of Page, Labor is now established on the<br />
North Coast as the party of Government. </p>
<p>And these victories in New South Wales, along with our extra<br />
seats in Queensland, meant that even with our<br />
disappointments in Victoria, the result of the election was<br />
beyond doubt.<br />
The lesson is clear.<br />
Australians will not cop the conservatives' determination to<br />
entrench privilege at the expense of ordinary men and women;<br />
they will not stand for empty posturing when what<br />
is required is detailed strategy and decisive<br />
action they will not hand the reins of power to a<br />
conservative coalition that is deaf and blind to<br />
the need to protect the Australian environment.<br />
That was the lesson the Liberal and National Parties should<br />
have learned on 24 March.<br />
And when the time comes in this State, Bob Carr will teach<br />
the Greiner Government the same lesson.<br />
Because the truth is this: conservative politics is so<br />
bankrupt in New South Wales, at both the State and Federal<br />
levels, that seats hitherto not contemplated as potential<br />
Labor gains are now legitimate targets for us<br />
and certainly, no seat held by the National Party<br />
should be off our campaign map.<br />
When I make my first electorate visits in New South Wales<br />
which I will be doing in mid-August I will be taking this<br />
message to our two new seats on the North Coast.<br />
I'll be telling the people of Richmond and Page that the<br />
issues at stake in the Federal election will equally be at<br />
stake in the State contest.<br />
In particular, I'll be telling them that the chasm between<br />
Labor and the Nationals on the issues of environmental<br />
protection and of quality of leadership will ensure that, in<br />
the future, victories like Richmond and Page won't be<br />
unrepeatable and won't even be seen as very remarkable.<br />
It is nothing short of amazing to follow in the press the<br />
squabbling between the Liberals and the Nationals about<br />
which of them will pick up the fragments of the shattered<br />
conservative presence in the bush.<br />
The Nationals started out by launching a ' provincial<br />
Australia' drive and the Liberals are responding with a<br />
' regional Australia' push. </p>
<p>The fact is, when it comes to representing the real<br />
interests of the more than 5 million Australians who live<br />
outside the major cities, it's not the Liberals or the<br />
Nationals who can do the job.<br />
It's Labor.<br />
For too many years, Australian politics was split down the<br />
middle, with the non-metropolitan areas treated as the<br />
gerrymandered fiefdoms of the conservative parties.<br />
But now, Labor has a strong and growing credibility in rural<br />
and provincial Australia, which is being increasingly<br />
reflected in our numbers in the Federal Parliament.<br />
Whether it's protecting overseas trading interests and<br />
fighting for fair access to foreign markets or whether<br />
it's extending modern telecommunications to the people<br />
outside the capitals or whether it's ensuring that people<br />
in provincial cities and country towns have services<br />
equivalent to their metropolitan cousins or whether it's<br />
protecting, through Landcare, the soil on which our<br />
agricultural prosperity depends you'll find it's Labor<br />
doing the hard work to build a secure future for rural and<br />
regional Australia.<br />
Delegates, We all know that this is Stephen Loosley's last State<br />
Conference as General Secretary of this branch.<br />
As one of the architects of our 1990 victory, he deserves<br />
our praise and thanks on that score alone.<br />
But a more complete record of the last 13 years he has<br />
served the Party the last seven of them as Secretary<br />
includes many more achievements.<br />
At a time when the Federal Party has been operating with an<br />
unparalleled degree of co-operation among the factions, it<br />
has been appropriate, too, that Stephen Loosley has brought<br />
a certain degree of glasnost to the running of the New South<br />
Wales branch.<br />
He has brought increased professionalism to the operation of<br />
the Party machine.<br />
Perhaps his greatest material contribution has been<br />
conceiving and executing the idea of the New South Wales<br />
branch acquiring its own offices. I'm told that one of the<br />
key elements in the brief Steve gave to the real estate<br />
agents was that it had to be a property in Sussex Street<br />
which reflects his keen interest in Labor's history and<br />
traditions. </p>
<p>He will be missed by you in Sydney but that loss is<br />
Canberra's gain. His skills make him a very welcome member<br />
of the Federal team. Labor already has a huge lead over the<br />
conservatives in terms of the quality of our Senate<br />
representation and Senator Loosley will be no mean addition<br />
to that equation.<br />
Delegates The 1990 election was a tough contest and it was a hard won<br />
victory. But the verdict, at the end of the counting, was clear-cut.<br />
And our mandate for the fourth term is unambiguous.<br />
Don't fall into the trap of believing that we won this<br />
election by default that we fell over the line because the<br />
other mob was so pathetic.<br />
They were pretty pathetic. But we won this on our own<br />
merits by demonstrating to the people of Australia that<br />
our strategy for the future of this country represents the<br />
only effective and credible way forward.<br />
Now that the Australian people have given us the privilege<br />
of a fourth term in Government, it's up to us to live up to<br />
their expectations.<br />
We sought a clear mandate for continued economic reform<br />
and that's what we have been given.<br />
I can assure you, and through you the people of Australia,<br />
that this renewed mandate will not be wasted or frittered<br />
away. The first major decision of the fourth term was the election<br />
of a new Ministry one I believe is superbly equipped for<br />
the task ahead.<br />
The Ministry is already working towards meeting our election<br />
pledges including our massive expansion of access and<br />
availability of child care, and our new ' clever country'<br />
program of Cooperative Research Centres.<br />
The two new ministers from NSW Peter Baldwin and<br />
Robert Tickner along with my Parliamentary Secretary Ross<br />
Free, are already making impressive contributions in their<br />
areas.<br />
We are now about to begin the cycle of preparations for our<br />
first fourth-term Budget. In this context let me give you a<br />
very explicit assurance that the Government's willingness<br />
and capacity to take the hard decisions in the national<br />
interest are as keen and far-sighted as ever.<br />
You have probably heard me use those words " hard decisions"<br />
more often than you would like. </p>
<p>They certainly crop up fairly frequently in the vocabulary<br />
of Government these days.<br />
All I can say by way of apology or explanation is that<br />
Governments that only take " easy decisions" end up running<br />
themselves, and the country, into the wall.<br />
If Australia learned any lesson from the nearly-three<br />
decades of disastrous conservative rule that preceded 1983,<br />
it was that squibbing the tough decisions, neglecting the<br />
structural requirements of the economy, papering over the<br />
weaknesses, just spells hardship down the track, and<br />
requires a decent government to come along and put things<br />
right. We inherited not so much an economy as an industrial museum<br />
with nineteenth century exhibits like steep tariff<br />
barriers, uncompetitive work practices, antiquated capital<br />
investment.<br />
Our historic role is to build an Australia that for once<br />
lives up to the potential of its people<br />
with an economy that is competitive in our region<br />
and the rest of the world,<br />
and a society that is sufficiently prosperous and<br />
fair to ensure I've already quoted Chifley's<br />
words a decent standard of living for all.<br />
We've done the job well, precisely because we have taken<br />
hard decisions.<br />
There are more hard decisions coming up, and they will<br />
require, as in the past, careful negotiation and<br />
accommodation. And by talking about this current round of decisions, I<br />
don't want to be misunderstood as saying that once we've got<br />
them out of the way, then the future will be plain sailing.<br />
What we must all understand is that economic reform is a<br />
constant process. What's needed is a continued willingness<br />
to adapt because the nature of a dynamic economy is its<br />
very capacity for repeated phases of change, its inbuilt<br />
flexibility that responds to the challenges of today and,<br />
then, the challenges that are now unforeseen or only<br />
emerging. The Labor movement is uniquely strong because we are<br />
involved with, and because we understand, the workplaces<br />
where the success or failure of the Australian economy is<br />
determined every shift of every day of every working<br />
week. </p>
<p>And this Labor Government is uniquely committed to the task:<br />
so that when we embark on change, it is comprehensive change<br />
for the lasting benefit of the whole nation not tinkering<br />
to skew the system in favour of this or that vested<br />
interest. So for the fourth term, there are more hard decisions and<br />
tough negotiations ahead; but there will, as a result, be<br />
further progress in the creation of a competitive,<br />
prosperous and fair Australia.<br />
And let me draw the contrast between us and our opponents on<br />
this critical, absolutely central, issue.<br />
In all the agonised post-mortems that our opponents have<br />
conducted to discover why they have lost four elections in a<br />
row, one thing only has become manifestly clear.<br />
It is that this new-look Opposition has come no closer to<br />
relevant and effective policies for Australia's future than<br />
the old-guard it has replaced.<br />
They're certainly no closer on health.<br />
They're no closer on economic policy Dr Hewson spent most<br />
of last year and all of this year predicting a recession and<br />
when the latest figures proved him wrong once more, he<br />
declared instead that we were going through " a patchy period<br />
of flatness, where some sectors are doing quite well"!<br />
They're even further away from getting a fair and effective<br />
taxation policy. Not content with being belted by the<br />
electorate for wanting to abolish our capital gains tax,<br />
Dr Hewson and his tattered Shadow Treasurer still seem to be<br />
toying around with the remnants of their unthought-through<br />
notions of a consumption tax.<br />
There were recently some well publicised airing of<br />
differences on our side of politics.<br />
But at least the public knows that the only debates on our<br />
side are about the real issues: the nature of the problems<br />
facing our country and the most effective way of tackling<br />
them. These debates within Caucus and Cabinet constitute the only<br />
real focus of debate about policy in Parliament House we<br />
are still the intellectual engine room for the reform of the<br />
Australian economy, as we have been since 1983.<br />
The conservatives remain what they always have been: an<br />
irrelevance. All we hear from them, as we have since 1983,<br />
is a noise made by those who don't yet understand what the<br />
national challenges are let alone how to formulate a<br />
relevant and effective solution. </p>
<p>Delegates,<br />
We have been given a priceless opportunity by the Australian<br />
people the opportunity to impress on the Australia of the<br />
next century the imprint of progressive, compassionate and<br />
effective Labor reforms.<br />
That is why the mandate we have been given for a fourth term<br />
in office is such a precious one.<br />
My Government will meet the challenge. We will continue to<br />
formulate and implement the comprehensive reforms that have<br />
been our hallmark since 1983.<br />
And that way we will ensure that we are laying the right<br />
foundations for the Australia of the twenty-first century<br />
the Australia that is now starting to take shape the<br />
Australia that the schoolkids of today will inherit.<br />
It is to open those kids' horizons today and to expand<br />
their opportunities as adults in the Australia of the future<br />
that our reforms in this fourth term must ultimately be<br />
directed. If we spend the next three years well and we will then<br />
it will be those kids who become the long-term beneficiaries<br />
of our fourth term in office.<br />
And that is why this is such a precious mandate and such a<br />
heavy responsibility.<br />
Let me close as I did twelve months ago: " With your help,"<br />
we will fulfil that mandate and shoulder that<br />
responsibility. </p>
