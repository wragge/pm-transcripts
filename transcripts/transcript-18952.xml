<p>Ninety of the best and brightest students from across Australia and the Asia-Pacific region have been awarded a 2013 Prime Minister's Australia Award.</p>
<p>Forty undergraduate and postgraduate Australian students will receive scholarships to study, undertake research or take up a work placement across the region. Twenty students from Asia and 30 students from the Pacific will receive the same opportunity in Australia.</p>
<p>The Awards develop enduring education, research and professional links between Australia and the Asia-Pacific region, as well as promote leadership skills.</p>
<p>The students and researchers will have the chance to experience international study and work experience in countries across the region including Australia, India, Indonesia, China, Japan, Malaysia and Vietnam.</p>
<p>The Asian Century presents a world of opportunities for our students and the Government is determined to make sure more Australians have the chance to benefit.</p>
<p>The next generation of Australian leaders will need to be increasingly Asian-literate and these are skills best learnt by experiencing Asia first-hand.</p>
<p>Award recipients from the region will undertake international work placements and participate in leadership development workshops to enhance their ability to contribute to the development priorities of their home country.</p>
<p>In the Asian Century, Australia needs to deepen its engagement across the region by enhancing industry and education links and strengthening people-to-people ties.</p>
<p>This year's Australian recipients come from six states and territories and are undertaking study or research in a diverse range of fields including the visual arts, mental health, environmental science, law and anthropology.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister's Australia Awards strengthen Australia's international education sector and build long-term links with individuals and organisations in the Asia-Pacific region.</p>
<p>Through the Australia in the Asian Century White Paper, we aim to have a larger number of Australian university students studying overseas and a greater proportion undertaking part of their degree in an Asian country by 2025</p>
<p>In addition to the Australia Awards, the Government has established AsiaBound. From next year, more than 10,000 Australian students will be supported to undertake some of their study in an Asian country. Thousands more students will have access to greater OS-HELP arrangements.</p>
<p>The recipients of the 2013 Prime Minister's Australia Awards will be recognised at a Presentation Dinner at the National Gallery of Australia tonight.</p>
