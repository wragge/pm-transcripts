    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Federal and Queensland Governments have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to create a one-stop shop for environmental approvals.</p>
<p>This reform is important for the Australian economy and is a key part of the State and Federal Governmentsâ deregulation agenda.</p>
<p>It will slash the growing burden and duplication of red and green tape which is a handbrake on investment in Queensland because two sets of environmental approvals cause delays to projects and investment across the state and the country.</p>
<p>The one-stop shop does not replace any State or Federal environment laws â it simply streamlines the process, ensuring just one application, instead of two, needs to be made.</p>
<p>That means the same strict environmental standards but ensures swift decisions and more certainty, whilst increasing jobs and investment in Queensland.</p>
<p>State governments already administer environmental law and should be able to make environmental approvals on the Commonwealthâs behalf while maintaining the same strict standards.</p>
<p>Within 12 months a bilateral agreement will be reached between the Federal and Queensland Governments. The work to achieve this will be undertaken by the Environment Ministers.</p>
<p>Creating a one-stop shop for environmental approvals in Queensland will help to grow the stateâs economy, reduce costs for business, boost productivity and create jobs.</p>
