    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to launch today 17 New Apprenticeship Centres to be operated by the Victorian Employers'; Chamber of Commerce and Industry (VECCI).</p>
<p>VECCI';s new sites will provide comprehensive support services to businesses and apprentices undertaking training and to those interested in commencing an apprenticeship.</p>
<p>VECCI are opening nine new Centres in regional Victoria, with seven centres opening in Melbourne and one to be located in Geelong.</p>
<p>The New Apprenticeship Centres to be run by VECCI are part of the additional 200 support sites that are being established across Australia, bringing the total number of centres to almost 500.  Importantly, the number of sites in regional and rural communities has been increased to 333 from an initial 200 sites.  The number of sites in metropolitan areas has been increased to 166 from around 100.</p>
<p>New Apprenticeship Centres, first established in 1998, manage the Commonwealth';s New Apprenticeships Incentives Programme and provide information, resources and support.  The provision of support services is making an important contribution to the continuing growth in the number of Australians undertaking a New Apprenticeship.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth Government has committed $2.8 billion over four years to support the New Apprenticeship system, and to provide for continuing growth in the scheme.</p>
<p>Currently there are more than 391,000 New Apprentices in training, compared with a combined total of 142,000 apprentices and trainees in 1995.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth Government is determined to ensure that the vocational education and training system continues to provide benefits to employers and to those in training, and in so doing contribute to ongoing employment growth, and further economic opportunities.</p>
<p>The success of New Apprenticeships to date has been due to a cooperative partnership between government, employers and training providers.  I commend VECCI and all the private and community organisations involved in operating New Apprenticeship Centres on their commitment to this nation';s apprenticeship system.</p>
