    <content><![CDATA[<p>On behalf of the Australian Government and people, I offer again my deepest sympathies and heartfelt condolences to the families of those who lost their lives, and to those who were injured in the bomb blasts in Bali on 1 October 2005.</p>
<p> Today we will pause to remember with sadness, the Australians who lost their lives in these bombings, as well as the Australians who were maimed and injured.</p>
<p> The citizens of Indonesia and other nations who lost their lives or were injured in the bombings will also be in our thoughts today.</p>
<p>We will also remember the way in which Australians and Indonesians alike, together with the citizens of other countries affected by the blasts, rallied in support of the victims and their loved ones.</p>
<p> Today we will also reflect on the courage and strength the Australian people demonstrated in the face of the tragedy.  These qualities, and our ability to pull together under difficult circumstances, irrespective of race, religion, or background have become an integral part of our national character.</p>
