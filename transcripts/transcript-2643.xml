ABORIGINAL POLICY<br />
Good Eveninr: Next Friday is National Aborigines Day throughout Australia.<br />
Recently I talked to large numbers of aboriginal<br />
leaders in the Northern Territory and the Kimberley. I was able<br />
to discuss with t--hem face to face how they felt about the assistance<br />
we are giving and the directions in which we are moving.<br />
S ince the last National Aborigines Day twelve months ago,<br />
there has been a steady and significant development of Commonwealth<br />
policy and objectives for the aboriginal people. So now I want to<br />
outline to you some of the objectives of the Commonwealth policies<br />
as they affect aborigines.<br />
The most important development was the five point statement<br />
I made on Australia Day, six months ago, setting out my Government's<br />
* olicies for aboriginal citizens. Those points are worth recalling<br />
now when our attention can be focused on the one day of the year<br />
when we can look at the problems and prospects for Australia's own<br />
aboriginal population. It is very important that we should try to<br />
understand the aims and directions of national policy.<br />
First, we want to ensure that aborigines have free and<br />
unimpeded access to the rights and privileges-of our society.<br />
Next, we want to encou-rage and assist aborigines to keep and<br />
develop their own culture as a worthwhile and wholesome part of<br />
Australian life. That is, we want to emphasise that every aborigine<br />
has the right to say how closely and how soon he will become<br />
integrated into the mainstream of Australian society. We think<br />
this is more likely to happen when aborigines retain their own identity<br />
and traditions and their own culture. The concept of separate ./ 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
development as a long term aim is alien to our objectives.<br />
The Liberal/ Country Party Government's objectives must be<br />
based on programmes which take notice of the wishes and the<br />
aspirations of the aborigines themselves, which provide the<br />
opportunities to develop their own personalities and abilities and<br />
which involve the aboriginal people themselves in formulating the<br />
policy program-mes.<br />
Our fourth objective is to make certain the Government's<br />
programmes encourage aboriginal citizens to manage their own affairs<br />
as much as practicable so that they can improve their potential<br />
and participate fully in national progress, and that handicaps for<br />
aborigines in health, in housing and in education, and in vocational<br />
training may be steadily reduced.<br />
Lastly, we want to get rid of the few remaining laws which<br />
discriminate against aborigines.<br />
Those are the five objectives of the Australia Day statement.<br />
I cannot emphasise strongly enough that this statement means that<br />
Australians as a nation, and through their national Government,<br />
recognise that aborigines have a great many problems and difficulties<br />
not faced by others.<br />
And I assure you it means we have shouldered the burden.<br />
It means we will see that aboriginal citizens have the opportunities<br />
to reach at least the same standards of living and education as are<br />
enjoyed by all other Australians.<br />
Since the 1967 Referendum on the question of Federal<br />
responsibility for aboriginal policy, special funds have been<br />
established concerned with aboriginal housing, health, education,<br />
employment and business enterprises. In the financial year just<br />
ended, direct national expenditure on aboriginal advancement was<br />
nearly $ 45 million.<br />
We intend to create a new form of leaseholding on aboriginal<br />
reserves to assist in land rights. There is a new mining code<br />
setting up guidelines for mining on abcriginal reserves. And I<br />
want to emphasise because it is not always clearly understood<br />
that these reserves are not only very extensive, covering an area<br />
nearly as great as Victoria, in the Northern Territory alone, but<br />
that the reserves are of permanent duration for the aboriginal<br />
people themselves. We have allocated $ 5 million in the first year of the scheme<br />
to buy land outside reserves for aboriginal groups. We are<br />
currently considering an offer to acquire land for one aboriginal<br />
group in this way. Wie will delineate and protect land for<br />
aboriginal religious and ceremonial purposes. ./ 3 </p>
<p>One of the grouns I visited at the beginninq of this<br />
month was the Yirrkala at Gove in the Northern Territory.<br />
They are receiving directly 10 ner cent of royalties from the<br />
nearby bauxite and alumina development as a result of the<br />
Australia Day decisions.<br />
I recently announced the first royalty payment of about<br />
$ 21,500 to the Yirrkala and as time goes on, the total<br />
aborigines' royalty from the Gove project will reach $ 1 million<br />
a year. After meeting and having the pleasure of associating with<br />
them, it is fair to say that they believe they are being<br />
satisfactorily treated.<br />
After I came back south, one of the most important of<br />
their leaders sent me a message rejecting press reports about<br />
agitation to send several aborigines to Switzerland in protest<br />
against the mining venture. I thought that indicated their<br />
attitude pretty clearly.<br />
As a nation we have a long road ahead in ensuring that<br />
our aboriginal citizens take their rightful place in our society.<br />
Since 1967, we have been taking more and more vigorous action<br />
towards this aim.<br />
I believe we have been doing so sincerely, wisely and<br />
f he real benefit of the Australian aborigines themselves.<br />
co urse that I hope all Australians will wholeheartedly<br />
s ibet. </p>
