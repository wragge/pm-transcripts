PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH HOWARD SATTLER, RADIO 6PR<br />
JULY 1990<br />
E AND 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
SATTLER; Good morning Prime Minister.<br />
PM: Morning Howard.<br />
BATTLER: Could you f irst conf irm you are not intending to<br />
stay till 2000 are you?<br />
PM: You can take that for granted mate.<br />
SATTLER: Alright well what about this duplication, where is<br />
it worst?<br />
PM: Well it's in so many areas, the area of health and<br />
welfare services is ofle area which stands out. I mean if you<br />
look at our elderly people, we cater for them as a community<br />
through our hospitals, through our nursing homes, our hostels<br />
and through the delivery of domiciliary services into their<br />
homes. Now the State and the Commonwealth are intermeshed in<br />
all of those area. and that means there is duplication not<br />
only in the services but also in monitoring services<br />
for instance and it's very inefficient. Now what we have got<br />
to do is to work out ways in which we deliver to Australian<br />
citizens the best possible services with the leasnt possible<br />
duplication. If you take another area, transport which I<br />
talked about in some detail yesterday. I ref erred to the<br />
container going across the continent from Sydney to Perth and<br />
what' s involved in all the changes there and the different<br />
authorities, 3 different authorities that are involved. what<br />
we have got to do is try and get a national rail freight<br />
initiative which will mean that our enterprises around this<br />
country are going to have the best integrated rail and road<br />
services that are possible. These are just examples Howard<br />
of the cost that we as Australian citizens pay for the system<br />
we have got at the moment. </p>
<p>BATTLER: How's it been allowed to get to this stage?<br />
PM: It's almost inevitable when you have the federal system<br />
we have got. We have got a federal parliament and 6 States<br />
and 2 Territories and you have got to understand that when<br />
our founding fathers met in the final decade of the last<br />
century what they were about Howard was not creating the<br />
Constitution for a modern Australia. I mean they were there<br />
at the end of the last century and they were reluctantly<br />
giving what they saw as the minimum set of powers necessary<br />
to a new national parliament to do things which they thought<br />
they couldn't do like defence for instance and so on. They<br />
were not planning for an Australia of the 21st century so we<br />
have grown through the 20th century with a set of<br />
arrangements which have been increasingly unsuited to the<br />
growing complexity of our nation and of our world. So what<br />
we have got do to now as intelligent men and women and as<br />
intelligent state and national leaders is to say well while<br />
we can't change the Constitution overnight are there better<br />
ways of cooperation where we can identify more efficient<br />
means of delivering services to our citizens and I think we<br />
can do that. Importantly Howard I do think that we have<br />
political leaders around the country as Premiers and at the<br />
national level now who understand the challenge of the times<br />
and who will be prepared to enter into this exercise<br />
cooperatively. SATTLER: Well there has been a fair bit of discussion<br />
publicly in the last week about it and you are right the<br />
political leaders seem to agree that we have got to end this<br />
duplication. Will your biggest stumbling block be the<br />
bureaucracy, some of which might be cut back?<br />
PM: We won't allow the bureaucracies to stand in the way and<br />
what I have done so that I am translating this idea into a<br />
concrete practical process of action I have invited the State<br />
Premiers to nominate a senior representative to come and meet<br />
with the secretary of my department so that in the period<br />
between now and the end of October when I have this f irst<br />
special premiers conference we will have hard concrete<br />
working papers prepared for us in a number of areas where we<br />
can start to move to decisions. Now it will mean in some<br />
areas a lessening of the number of jobs in total within the<br />
bureaucracy because if for instance we come to the conclusion<br />
in a certain area that the Commonwealth will get out of the<br />
delivery of certain services and hand that over to the States<br />
well that will mean we won't need the same number of people<br />
in that area and likewise if the States say that particular<br />
area well it's perhaps better that we get out of that and let<br />
the Commonwealth do that you won't need the same number of<br />
public servants in a particular State on that issue. So the<br />
running of this will not be with the bureaucrats they will<br />
cooperate with us and do the work that we want them to do but<br />
I have called for leadership yesterday and that leadership I<br />
believe will be forthcoming from the Premiers as it will be<br />
from me. </p>
<p>SATTLERs You suggested also yesterday if it's correctly<br />
reported a uniform set of rules for non bank financial<br />
institutions. Now I wonder if that had been in place would<br />
that have stopped or would have it had lessened the rush of<br />
investors funds and the loss of investor crisis particularly<br />
in Victoria in the last couple of weeks.<br />
P1( 1 It may have done. It is clear that the supervision<br />
controls of the non bank deposit taking financial<br />
institutions are better in some States than others so what we<br />
have got to do now is to try and have the adoption in all the<br />
States as the most effective form of supervision and try and<br />
make it uniform with them the States having the<br />
responsibility of that supervision.<br />
SATTLERs Well you think that a Stat. like Victoria in its<br />
current state is capable of administering that sort of thing.<br />
Would that have been better administered by the Commonwealth?<br />
PM: I don't this is the area where it would be appropriate<br />
for the Commonwealth to be controlling because what you have<br />
got to understand is when you look at these institutions<br />
there is an absolute myriad of them. You have got deposit<br />
taking institutions which operate at a tiny level. You know<br />
particular firms have their credit union and so on and it<br />
would be inappropriate to be having that sort of control I<br />
think from Canberra. What is more important is that we<br />
involve ourselves with the States in trying to identify what<br />
is the most effective sort of supervision that you should<br />
have, what are the ingredients of effective supervision and<br />
then for the States to carry that out on a uniform basis.<br />
SATTLER: What about taxes under your plan. There is at<br />
least one comment piece today that says taxes on banks,<br />
superannuation funds and other financial institutions are<br />
likely to face hefty increases following the decision to hand<br />
over say bank account debits tax to the States. What do you<br />
see about that?.<br />
PM: The is currently we raise from the bank accounts<br />
debit tax a little over $ 400 million. Now the States also<br />
have taxes in this area what they call their financial<br />
institutions duty tax, so there is a sort of duplication if<br />
you like. Now it seems like here was an area which could be<br />
over time something of a growth area, let the States have<br />
that and make the decisions according to their need as they<br />
see it and their economic requirements. In giving them that<br />
tax it gives them a possible growth area but not one which<br />
compromises the need which I identified yesterday for macro<br />
economic control to be with a I mean the Premiers don't<br />
really question that. They understand that in this complex<br />
world in which we live and an inter-related world Australia<br />
must have control of the macro economy in the hands of the<br />
national government. Now we think that in giving this tax to<br />
the States we don't compromise the need for central control<br />
of the economy but gives the States a possible growth area. </p>
<p>h 4.<br />
BATTLERs We are running out of time Prime Minister but do<br />
you see a long terma future f or three tiers of government in<br />
Australia. Some people have suggested there should be only<br />
two, the Commonwealth and regional government.<br />
PM: I made that suggestion myself in the 1979 Boyer lectures<br />
but I see my responsibility now as trying to make the system<br />
that we have got work better. If at some time in the future<br />
Australians want to look at that, that is for them but my<br />
current responsibility is to make the system we have got work<br />
better. SATTLER: But Bob Hawke individual would still like to see<br />
that system would he?<br />
PM: Bob Hawke individual may want to talk about those things<br />
later on but that sort of thina is for Australians down the<br />
track if they want to. I mean the urgency is to make what we<br />
have got work better.<br />
SATTLERs No one will disagree with that. Thanks very much<br />
* for your time today.<br />
PM: Thank you very much Howard.<br />
