SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTEn,', THE RT. HON. R. G.<br />
MENZIES AT KNOX COLLEGE, SYDNEY ON THURSDAY?<br />
DECEMBER? l9 O<br />
I think I ought to begin by making two apologies, one<br />
is for the absence of my wife, who would have reoatly enjoyed<br />
being here, but who, in a sudden onrush of what I can only<br />
describe as eccentricity decided to have her four Melbourne<br />
grandchildren to stay with her at the Lodge, ranging from 9 to<br />
3J, and all of them with a considerable element of old Adam and<br />
old Eve. ( Laughter) Therefore she wished me to make her<br />
apologies to you.<br />
In the second place, whether it is because I have been<br />
away from her, I am not in the best of form tonight you may say<br />
that I seldom am. ( Laughter) The last couple of nights I have<br />
not been able to sleep. I don't know what it is. The only<br />
explanation that will occur to some of you is that conscience has<br />
at last caught up with me. ( Laughter) Well whether that is so,<br />
or not, I don't know; Itll leave it to you.<br />
I have a variety of reasons for being glad to be here<br />
and one of them, outstandingly, is that the Chairman tonight is<br />
a very old friend of mine4<br />
I referred just now to my wife. At a time when the<br />
Rev., P. J. Murdoch was preaching in Trinity Church Camberwell in<br />
the State of Victoria he had two fine looking lads in the Church<br />
one was Ullan Murdoch, and one was myself ( Laughter) and an<br />
uncommonly good looking girl who was a boarder at the Church<br />
School nearby. WIell in that contest I won ( Laughter) because she<br />
married me. Not, Allan, that I think you did too badl~ y yourself.<br />
( Laughter) Now there is one thing that I like very much about the<br />
programmeo tonight. I've always maintained that we Scots<br />
Presbyterians have a very practical outlook. Toni,'' ht it has<br />
been brilliantly arranged. I've been to a few Speech Nights and<br />
they always tell you to hand out the prizes first and speak<br />
afterwards. tVell, it's very hard on the boys they've collected<br />
their loot ( Laughter), their interest in the proceedings is<br />
completely terminated, and therefore they say, " Who's this old<br />
fellow ( Laughter) spouting away?"<br />
But tonight I have them., in the hollow of rmy hand. If<br />
they count me out inside the next ten minutes then all I can<br />
say is, " Counting, out, no prizes". And judging by the look of<br />
the table there must be a m~ ost brilliant collection of school<br />
boys in this place that I've ever heard of. ( Laughter)<br />
You may think that gping, to a Speech Nig ht from the<br />
point of view of a political old hand like myself is a rather<br />
dull business. Do you know it is very stimulating? The other<br />
day I handed out to a boy, who struck mie as being very<br />
intelligent to look at, the Senior prize in Latin and French.<br />
You know that did so much _, ood to my morale this was<br />
a very intelligent looking boy and I was able to tell him that<br />
was the last prize I won at School myself. Of course the<br />
standards may have fallen in the meantime. ( Laughter)<br />
But this does all of us good, to come along and revisit<br />
the glimpses of the moon and recollect the time when we<br />
were intelligent. ( Laughter) It is about that time that I<br />
want to say a few words to the boys tonight.<br />
When you senior b.) ys -o out into the affairs of life<br />
you will find any number of people who will say to " Now<br />
all that stuff that you have learned at school forget about<br />
that; that's all old fashio-ned. Now you have to face the real<br />
facts of getting a living and dealing with people". </p>
<p>I've hoard so many ' f them talk like that, the truth<br />
of the matter being that those men who talk like that have never<br />
learned anything since they left school. They caze out of<br />
school with a little stock of things that they had learned, and<br />
normally, with that little stock of things that they had learned,<br />
provided the intelligence and the character and the decent<br />
ambition, they c , uld ; o on learning and learning for years until<br />
the very end of their lives.<br />
Any man who has the benefit of an education, who isn't<br />
a student at the age of 80, has wasted his time. I sometimes<br />
think about people of that kind that they really think that<br />
school is something to be got through.<br />
Now what is it that we acquire at school? It is quite<br />
true that you don't do a Law course, like me you do that after<br />
you leave school; you don't study Medicine you may do some<br />
Biology, or Chemistry, but you don't study medicine.<br />
It is quite true that what you are doing is, in a<br />
sense, though it doesn't always look it, elementary compared to<br />
what will be attacked later on.<br />
3ut the whole point about it is that this is a superb<br />
discipline for the rLind. It really teaches us when we are at<br />
school, to have some standards, to have things by which we can<br />
measure other things good manners courtesy, intelligence, the<br />
team spirit a willingness to subordinate personal interests to<br />
the interests of the side, to the interests of the school.<br />
These are all wonderful things. They are not childish.<br />
They are never more needed than in the grown-up world.<br />
You take the question of standards. We are living in<br />
an ago of immense scientific research, particularly<br />
technological research. Our friends in the Soviet Union fire off<br />
satellites into the air they've even come to blows with the<br />
moon so we're told. All this is supposed to be tremendous, and<br />
a lot of people, in this country, and in other countries in the<br />
free world say, " Well, you know, that shows they are getting ahead<br />
of us". It would be very odd if they didn't get ahead of us in<br />
something. But I want to say to everybody: Remember there ought<br />
to be standards. Everything must be judged on some comparative<br />
basis. A friend of mine who is in the diplomatic world and<br />
from another country said to me one night in Canberra, " You know,<br />
the moral effect on the people of various Asian countries, of<br />
seeing these satellites passing across the sky, the moral effect<br />
politically, will be tremendous". 3ut I said, " My friend, you<br />
are forgetting that but for the work of the microbiologists the<br />
medical scientists of the Wostern world, a lot of them wouldn't<br />
be alive to see the satellite". You see, you must always have<br />
some comparative standard in your mind.<br />
Right around the world we see and it's not now,<br />
though I think perhaps it's more acute than it was that one<br />
of the great standards appears to be ' How much money does he<br />
earn? How much money does he laboriously accumulate?' I would<br />
like to say to my t:, oys lown there, I hope they don't succumb to<br />
that silly idea. Judging by some of the people I've seen who<br />
have made a lot of money, I don't think it can be too difficult.<br />
( Laughter) I've seen other people who made immense fortunes by<br />
tremendous constructive work for the country, and I admire them<br />
not because they have made a fortune, but because of their<br />
constructive work for the country. </p>
<p>3.<br />
3ut don't worry about that kind of thing. Make up your<br />
minds that right through your life you are going to know<br />
something if possible better than the man next to you. You are<br />
going to continue to be a student. You are not going to be<br />
laughed out of it by being told that now you are a man you must<br />
put away childish things. This is the most terrible of all<br />
fallacies. Above all, don't succumb to the national pastime of<br />
being cynical about other people's motives. You remember that<br />
J. M. Jarrie made a magnificent speech years ago at the rectorial<br />
address, it was, at St. Andrew's. I've always kept it near me<br />
and I read it ab,-ut once a year, perhaps not with all the benefit<br />
that I should take from it, but I read it once a year. land I<br />
once had the , reat honour of talking with 3arrie about it for a<br />
couple of hours in a country house in England.<br />
But one of the flashing sentences in that speech was,<br />
' Never ascribe to your opponent motives lower than your own'.<br />
When I hear in the political world people eagerly alleging that<br />
somebody has been personally corrupt, I suspect very deeply<br />
whether he isn't. Never ascribe to an opponent, motives lower<br />
than your own.<br />
You may have to fight your opponent; you may have to<br />
denounce him from time to time that's all in the game of life<br />
and you must be courageous and have a good spirit.<br />
Jut the silly cynicism which disfigures so many<br />
people's minds, the kind of cynicism which produces the statement<br />
" Oh, well, yes, I know he's supposed to be doing it for nothing,<br />
but there must be something that he's after". You hear it said<br />
about municipal councillors, poor chaps. I always thought that<br />
they gave an immense amount of service to their locality, and<br />
did it for free, as they say. J3ut, " Oh, no, you can't tell me;<br />
there must be something".<br />
Now the follow who says that has never done a hand's<br />
turn for the country in his life.<br />
Don't belong to that group of people. Go through your<br />
lives, firmly persuaded that people can, and do perform unselfish<br />
acts just as you have seen your school fellows perform them for<br />
year after year in the school. Go through your life still<br />
believing that. 3ocause if you do, the whole of your life will be<br />
sweetened, and the life of Australia will be sweetened, because<br />
our standards will have risen. We will have come more and more<br />
firmly to have certain things that we passionately believe in,<br />
and that we won't run away from. This is the essence of having<br />
standards. Now, I think if you don't mind, I'll leave it at<br />
that and get on with the part of the proceedings which always<br />
appeals to me in my dual capacity I'm , iving away things that<br />
other people have paid for ( Laughter) and in my dual capacity<br />
as a Presbyterian and as a politician, I appreciate both.<br />
( Laughter, applause) </p>
