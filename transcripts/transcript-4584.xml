FOR PRESS 6 DECEMBER 1977<br />
The Prime Minister announced today that the Government had<br />
recently received proposals from the Queensland Government<br />
for subsidising the cost of transporting cattle by road from<br />
remote areas in Queensland as a means of assisting beef producers.<br />
It is understood that the proposed subsidy schemes are<br />
supported by the United Graziers' Association of Queensland.<br />
The Queensland Government has been requested to provide further<br />
information relating to the proposals.<br />
The Prime Minister recalled that, in the beef aid package of<br />
22 September, the Government undertook to examine charges<br />
within the Federal responsibility for producers in the more<br />
remote and isolated pastoral centres of Australia. The<br />
Queensland Government has also been invited to make submissions<br />
in this regard.<br />
Mr. Fraser said that a decision on Commonwealth participation<br />
in the cost of a road transport subsidy scheme would be a<br />
matter for the incoming Government, and that if a Liberal<br />
National Country Party Government were re-elected it would<br />
give urgent consideration to the Queensland proposals. </p>
