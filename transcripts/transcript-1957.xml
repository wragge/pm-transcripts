COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA<br />
SPEECH BY 4\ X<br />
The Rt Hon. J. G. GORTON, M. P.<br />
ON<br />
GORTON GOVERNMENT<br />
Want of Confidence Motion<br />
[ From the ' Parliamentary Debates,' 19 November 1968]<br />
Mr GORTON ( Higgins-Prime Minister)<br />
[ 8.25]-l had thought that, when a motion<br />
of no confidence was presented by the<br />
Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam).<br />
there might have been some significant and<br />
reasoned argument on some major point of<br />
attack on the Government, that some matter<br />
of national importance might have been<br />
developed, debated and pressed home. This<br />
did not happen. In fact, nothing even<br />
remotely resembling it happened. Instead,<br />
the Leader of the Opposition scarcely even<br />
mentioned defence, although that was one<br />
of the terms of his motion. He put no views<br />
to the House on what our defence strategy<br />
should be now that Britain is withdrawing<br />
from east of Suez or what the composition<br />
of our forces should be. He did not even<br />
mention the war in Vietnam or indeed any<br />
matters of major national importance in<br />
this field.<br />
Mr Barnard-When will you give us a<br />
statement on it?<br />
Mr GORTON-All the Deputy Leader<br />
of the Opposition, who is now interjecting,<br />
did was to make a completely untrue statement<br />
that never before had a motion of this<br />
kind been moved without the Prime<br />
Minister of the day immediately replying.<br />
25657/ 68 The Leader of the Opposition, instead of<br />
developing some matter of major national<br />
importance, spent his time fluttering disjointedly<br />
from twig tn twig, pausing to<br />
mouth a few words on such matters of<br />
national importance as the completion of a<br />
few miles of railway here, the need for<br />
legislation on sedentary fish-I wonder<br />
whether he proposes to fight the net election<br />
on the issue of sedentary fi; and<br />
something to do with the Snowy Mountains<br />
Authority planning the Eastern Suburbs<br />
Railway. He dealt, if dealt is the proper<br />
word-at least he mentioned tI em in<br />
passing-on my count with fifteen subjects<br />
in 45 minutes and dealt with none of them<br />
in a significant way at all. In his peregrination<br />
from twig to twig he managed to make<br />
a number of inaccurate and misleading<br />
statements, as is not altogether unusual. He<br />
claimed, for example, that no orders for<br />
defence equipment had been placed since<br />
1965. My colleague the Minister for<br />
Defence ( Mr Fairhall) demonstrated that<br />
that statement is not true. The Leader of<br />
the Opposition claimed that he and the<br />
House had been given no previous knowledge<br />
that the runway at Amberley for the<br />
F1Il aircraft would need to be lengthened<br />
for training pilots. </p>
<p>Mr Barnard-When are we getting the<br />
Fill? Mr SPEAKER-Order! The honourable<br />
member for Bass has already spoken in this<br />
debate and will refrain from interjecting.<br />
Mr GORTON-Let me go back, Mr<br />
Speaker, so that the interruption does not<br />
destroy the argument. The Leader of the<br />
Opposition claimed that he and the House<br />
had been given no previous knowledge that<br />
the runway at Amberley would need to be<br />
lengthened for training pilots in handling<br />
the Fill with all up weights. Hansard of<br />
2nd May, which was quoted by the Minister<br />
for Defence, shows that that statement is<br />
untrue. The Leader of the Opposition had<br />
the naivety or the ignorance to suggest that<br />
the Fill aircraft would have their range of<br />
operations reduced because the distance<br />
between Amberley and the north coast of<br />
Australia would have to be deducted from<br />
ithe striking range of the aircraft.<br />
He completely ignored the fact, if he knew<br />
it to be a fact-and he should have known<br />
it because he was at one stage connected<br />
with an air force-that Amberley is the<br />
training centre and that Darwin is the centre<br />
from which operations take place. It is<br />
therefore not only ludicrous but misleading<br />
to suggest that this range must be deducted<br />
in this instance. Mr Speaker, I am sorry if a<br />
catalogue of the misleading statements of the<br />
Leader of the Opposition goads the Opposi-<br />
. tion into interjections of the kind that are<br />
being made, but it cannot deny the accuracy<br />
of what I am saying, nor can this brouhaha<br />
prevent what I am saying from being put on<br />
record. Dr J. F. Cairns-But it is appropriate.<br />
Mr SPEAKER-Order! The honourable<br />
member for Yarra is out of his seat and will<br />
cease interjecting.<br />
Mr GORTON-To continue the catalogue,<br />
the Leader of the Opposition had the<br />
hardihood to claim, quite falsely, that in the<br />
year gone by nothing has been done for the<br />
sick, the poor and the old. What has been<br />
done in this year, or at least a part of what<br />
has been done in this year is this: Pensions<br />
have been raised to a greater level than was<br />
required by the rise in the cost of living.<br />
Mr Barnard-What utter nonsense!<br />
Mr SPEAKER-I have already requested<br />
the Deputy Leader of the Opposition not to<br />
interject. I suggest that he refrain from<br />
doing so. Mr Barnard-What utter nonsense!<br />
Mr SPEAKER-I must also inform the<br />
Deputy Leader of the Opposition that when<br />
the Leader of the Opposition was speaking<br />
he had the respect of the House.<br />
Mr GORTON-I trust that after this<br />
catalogue he will lose the respect of the<br />
House. Indeed, I think he is beginning to<br />
lose it already. I was dealing with the misleading<br />
statement made by the honourable<br />
member who has the respect of the House<br />
that nothing has been done in the last year<br />
for the sick, the poor and the old. This is<br />
the beginning of the catalogue of what has<br />
been done this year: Pensions have been<br />
raised, I repeat, to a greater level than was<br />
required by the rise in the cost of living;<br />
assistance has been provided to families<br />
without breadwinners; an insured hospital<br />
patient will be covered for the full amount<br />
insured however long his stay in hospital;<br />
supplementary benefits have been provided<br />
to patients in approved nursing homes however<br />
long the patients may stay in the<br />
hospitals; there has been the initiation of a<br />
scheme to develop home care and related<br />
services; and we have increased the subsidy<br />
payable for approved home nursing services.<br />
Will the Leader of the Opposition rise in<br />
his place now and say that in this year<br />
nothing has been done, as he said previously,<br />
for the sick, the poor and the old? The<br />
honourable member must know-indeed, he<br />
has no excuse for not knowing-that these<br />
things were done. They were part of the<br />
Budget discussions; they were part of the<br />
Estimates; they were part of the discussions<br />
in this House. Yet he has the temerity to<br />
get up in this place and say that they did<br />
not happen and this from the man who used<br />
to talk about credibility.<br />
The Leader of the Opposition even had<br />
the effrontery, as part of his case of no<br />
confidence, to say that the Government had<br />
refused to bring on debates on Tariff Board<br />
reports and the Government's oil price<br />
policy. This is what he told us as part of<br />
the attack on the Government, when he<br />
knows, or ought to know, that the arrangements<br />
made between the two sides of this<br />
House were that we should finish with the<br />
Bills before the House before the debates on<br />
these statements were brought on. If he<br />
does not know that, he should have known<br />
it. If he does know it, he should not have<br />
presented it to this House in the way he did.<br />
It is not part of my purpose--</p>
<p>Mr Barnard-These arrangements were<br />
not made, and the Prime Minister knows it.<br />
Mr SPEAKER-Order! I warn the<br />
Deputy Leader of the Opposition.<br />
Mr GORTON--He is slightly upset, I<br />
think. It is not really part of my purpose to<br />
follow the Leader of the Opposition down<br />
every manhole into which he may choose to<br />
disappear. Those who heard him could<br />
judge the effectiveness of his case for a<br />
motion of no confidence, and I believe that<br />
all who heard him will acknowledge, either<br />
privately or publicly, that this is the most<br />
ineffective case that has been made in the<br />
history of this Parliament, or probably of<br />
any other, on a motion of no confidence in<br />
the government.<br />
But, Sir, I do want to discuss two matters<br />
that he mentioned in passing. He attached<br />
not as much significance to them as I do,<br />
but I want to dilate on them a little. One of<br />
these matters concerns the defence preparations<br />
and the other concerns the Government's<br />
oil price policy as announced in the<br />
House. On defence the Leader of the Opposition<br />
said that ' the paper on the long term<br />
strategy, the basis of the Australian defence<br />
policy, had been in our hands for 12 weeks'.<br />
So it has. That is the first accurate statement<br />
that I have been able to find him make<br />
in the whole of his speech. The paper is<br />
concerned with various assessments of our<br />
strategic approach right into the 1980s, and<br />
an examination of the various circumstances<br />
in that period and what the future might turn<br />
out to hold in that period. Is it seriously<br />
argued, even by him, that 12 weeks is going<br />
to make a significant difference in an<br />
examination in that long term, in that long<br />
distance, in a matter of such complexity,<br />
when there are so many unknowns, so many<br />
imponderables-in some cases imponderables<br />
which are not yet clear but which<br />
may, and which probably will, become<br />
clearer over the coming year? But in the<br />
short term, the period up until the end of<br />
1971, by which time the British will have<br />
withdrawn from Malaysia and Singapore,.<br />
we decided in September in principle that<br />
we would retain in the Malaysia-Singapore<br />
area two squadrons of Mirage aircraft, two<br />
naval ships and an Anzac battalion, and that we would participate in arrangements for<br />
the conduct of the jungle warfare school in<br />
Malaysia. These countries know, and have known,<br />
of this decision in principle. 1 say ' in principle'<br />
because -before that decision is made<br />
with finality we need to know, as any<br />
government would need to know, what<br />
assistance and support will be forthcoming<br />
from the countries in that area themselves.<br />
What arrangements will be made to man<br />
the radar to control the squadrons we will<br />
have there? What infra-structure will be<br />
provided in support of our ground troops,<br />
and where and in what barrack complex<br />
can they be most economically housed?<br />
These matters have been the subject of discussion<br />
between this Government and the<br />
Governments of Malaysia and Singapore.<br />
These -are indeed matters which should have<br />
been discussed, and have been d-iscussed, in<br />
regard to that period to the end of 1971.<br />
There has been no lack of thought, no lack<br />
of discussion and no lack of willingness to<br />
decide for this period.<br />
But if the Leader of the Opposition is<br />
suggesting, as I think he is, from what he<br />
said, that precise longer term decisions<br />
reaching far into the future should be taken<br />
with finality now, taken in circumstances<br />
which in some cases are different from<br />
those which have ever prevailed before and,<br />
in other cases, may be different from those<br />
which have ever prevailed before, taken<br />
before those imponderables to which I h-ave<br />
refeired and which now exist are resolved<br />
with greater clarity, as I believe they will be<br />
shortly, I think he is advocating a completely<br />
irresponsible course for the Government<br />
of this country to take. I believe,<br />
indeed, that he is seeking to play politics<br />
with national survival, if this is what he is<br />
suggesting, -and we will have none of it. The<br />
plain facts are that our defence forces are<br />
expanding. Much new equipment is still to<br />
be delivered. Manpower is being expanded<br />
to man that increasing quantity of equipment.<br />
We have lost in this field no ground<br />
at all. Indeed, the Leader of the Opposition<br />
has not even attempted to present a<br />
reasoned argument to suggest that we have.<br />
The second matter I want to deal with<br />
are the allegations made by the Leader of<br />
the Opposition on the Government's oil<br />
pricing policy. He suggested in the House </p>
<p>this afternoon that there is some secret<br />
agreement in existence, and others have<br />
suggested that there has been generous<br />
treatment of Australian oil producers. There<br />
have never been, and there are, no secret<br />
agreements, and there has been in my<br />
belief no over-generous treatment of Australian<br />
oil producers. The arrangements<br />
made for the oil price policy have been<br />
publicly announced in this House and I<br />
have no reluctance at all in making available<br />
the agreement of which I spoke to<br />
this House. I ask leave of the House to<br />
lay on the table papers relating to the Government's<br />
oil policy.<br />
Mr SPEAKER-There being no objection,<br />
leave is granted.<br />
Mr GORTON-I lay on the table the<br />
following papers:<br />
Aide-M6moire.<br />
Letter dated 14 November 1968 from Comptroller-<br />
General of Customs.<br />
1 do that with some satisfaction, because it<br />
was suggested-more than suggested-by<br />
-the Leader of the Opposition in his speech<br />
that something was being held back; that<br />
either there was ignorance on my part or<br />
I was deliberately holding something back.<br />
I asked him to substantiate it then. He<br />
would not substantiate it then. Those papers<br />
substantiate the reverse now.<br />
Mr Connor-May we have a look at<br />
them? Mr GORTON-Of course you can.<br />
Now. It has always been the Government's<br />
declared policy that Australian crude oil,<br />
when discovered<br />
Mr SPEAKER-Order! The honourabie<br />
member for East Sydney is interjecting.<br />
There are -too many interjections. I have<br />
already asked honourable members to cooperate<br />
in this matter. This is a censure<br />
motion and is regarded by both sides as<br />
being an extremely serious matter. As I<br />
have pointed out, the Leader of the Opposition<br />
was heard in almost complete silence<br />
this afternoon. I think the same courtesy<br />
should be extended to the Prime Minister.<br />
Mr GORTON-It has always been the<br />
Government's declared policy that Australian<br />
crude oil, when discovered, should<br />
be used in Australia and not left in the<br />
ground while overseas oil is imported to be<br />
used in overseas owned refineries in Australia. I should have thought that the<br />
reasons for this were obvious. We want<br />
oil to be discovered in Australia and there<br />
is little incentive for this unless those who<br />
search for oil know that if they do discover<br />
it the Australian market will be available<br />
to them. We need to conserve our overseas<br />
exchange and the way to do that is not to<br />
have Australian oil in the ground while<br />
overseas exchange is used to import oil.<br />
That is the starting point of our policy. If<br />
it is to be challenged by members of the<br />
Opposition-if they. do not agree with that<br />
star! ing point-let us hear from them that<br />
they do challenge it. Let us hear from the<br />
next speaker, who, I understand, is to speak<br />
on oil, that he disagrees with that basic<br />
policy. This is the starting point of our<br />
policy. We do want Australian oil to be used<br />
to the fullest possible extent to meet the<br />
requirements of the Australian market.<br />
It was announced in September 1965<br />
that all Australian oil producers-all Australian<br />
oil producers-would be given 67c<br />
Australian a barrel as an added incentive<br />
to search for oil and that this payment<br />
would apply up to September 1970. This<br />
has been done. In the case of small producers<br />
such as Moonie and Barrow Island<br />
all the additional cost per gallon of product<br />
together with freights from those oil fields<br />
concerned have been absorbed into the<br />
present Australian price structure without<br />
any undue increase of price to consumers<br />
or effect on the economy. But the dis: overy<br />
of Very large quantities of oil in the Bass<br />
Strait fields on which 67c Australian per<br />
barrel was due to be paid would have<br />
added quite considerably to the price per<br />
gallon of product to the consumer and<br />
would have had an effect on the economy.<br />
Yet the commitment from the Government.<br />
publicly given, was that this oil, in<br />
common with all other Australian oil,<br />
should receive the 67c per barrel payment,<br />
and it would have been quite wrong for the<br />
Government to have broken its word anti<br />
retreated from this commitment by unilateral<br />
decision merely because one producer<br />
had discovered very large quantities<br />
of oil. It was therefore necessary to see<br />
whether by agreement the projected rise in<br />
the price of petroleum products could be<br />
minimised and the 67c per barrel which the<br />
Government was committed to pay could<br />
be reduced or abolished. </p>
<p>In the result, this was done by free<br />
negotiation and agreement. The producers<br />
in the Bass Strait oil fields agreed to forgo<br />
altogether not only the 67c per barrel incentive<br />
payment but a further. 5c per barrel<br />
as well. This of course meant a reduction of<br />
slightly over 2c per gallon in the price<br />
refineries would have otherwise had to pay<br />
for the oil, and a consequent significant<br />
saving to consumers of petroleum products.<br />
Do the members of the Opposition object to<br />
that? If so, let us hear about it when they<br />
speak. For its part the Government restated<br />
its policy that Australian oil must be used<br />
to the greatest extent possible on the Australian<br />
market-and that means to the<br />
greatest extent possible. We also stated that<br />
for a period of 5 years after September<br />
1970 the price paid by refineries for Australian<br />
oil would be the posted price of<br />
overseas oil as at 10th October, less the<br />
discounts allowed as at 10th October, plus<br />
overseas freight and wharfage, and that the<br />
producers would bear the average cost of<br />
freighting crude oil from the customs port<br />
nearest the point of delivery by the most<br />
efficient and economical means possible.<br />
Here it is important to note two things.<br />
Firstly, the Government did not agree to<br />
any finite price. The questions of fact of<br />
what was the posted price at that time, of<br />
what were the discounts allowed at that<br />
time, of what were the overseas freight<br />
rates, of what was to be the average cost of<br />
freighting oil around the Australian coast,<br />
were left for decision by a conference of the<br />
industry and all interested Government<br />
departments and, in the event of disagreement<br />
as to fact, by an independent<br />
arbitrator. This means that after September<br />
1970 for a period of 5 years the price of<br />
oil to the refineries should be no higher<br />
than the price they are now paying except<br />
for any increase in the case of some<br />
refineries due to freight costs around the<br />
Australian coast. In other words, the cost of<br />
petroleum products as a result of the crude<br />
oil component should be stabilised for<br />
years after that date.<br />
It may be that prices of overseas oil or<br />
freights on overseas oil will fall during this<br />
period. It may also be that in certain circumstances,<br />
particularly considering conditions<br />
in the Middle East, such prices may<br />
rise. But the price of Australian oil will be constant and at what it is now. Indeed, if it<br />
were not so it would -be open to overseas<br />
oil companies to reduce their well head<br />
price to one which would seriously disadvantage<br />
the Australian producers-not<br />
one producer but all Australian producers.<br />
This policy will ensure that Australian oil<br />
is used. It will ensure the mere minimum<br />
of increase in cost to the consumer. It will<br />
provide producers and those who are searching<br />
for oil with a built-in incentive. If the<br />
Opposition objects -to any of those things,<br />
if the Leader of the Opposition wishes to<br />
pursue his argument-and this is something<br />
concerned with a matter of no confidencelet<br />
them say so. Let them say so-they have<br />
not done it so far-on a number of matters<br />
which the Leader of the Opposition raised.<br />
On the question of defence, do they object<br />
to the statement made by me tonight, on<br />
behalf of the Government, of our proposals<br />
up to the end of 1971? Perhaps they do,<br />
because the Leader of the Opposition is on<br />
record as seeing no threat in that area-as<br />
seeing no danger whatever from subversion<br />
fostered by Communist China. He regards<br />
this as a false and fallible theory and something<br />
which cannot be tenable for a<br />
moment. Mr Barnard-We reject your domino<br />
theory. Mr SPEAKER-Order! I have already<br />
warned the Deputy Leader of the Opposition.<br />
I shall not warn him again.<br />
Mr GORTON-The Deputy Leader of<br />
the Opposition is very quick to spring to<br />
the defence of his Leader. I anticipated that<br />
that there might be some lack of memory<br />
on the part of the Leader of the Opposition<br />
himself, but since it is a lack of understanding<br />
on the part of his Deputy I will<br />
quote what the Leader of the Opposition<br />
had to say on this matter. He referred to a<br />
disastrously superficial theory-<br />
Mr Uren-When is the Minister for<br />
External Affairs going to enter into this<br />
debate? Mr SPEAKER-Order! If the honourable<br />
member for Reid interjects again, I will deal<br />
. with him.<br />
Mr GORTON-In dealing with the question<br />
of subversion or of the threat of Communist<br />
China, the Leader of the Opposition<br />
said that it was a disastrously superficial </p>
<p>theory and that it was a fragile and fallacious<br />
theory. Indeed, if this is what he still<br />
believes, it would be as well for the House<br />
and for the country if he said so, because<br />
this must be one matter to be taken into<br />
consideration if he formulates an alternative<br />
defence policy, which he has not yet done.<br />
Let us hear what he thinks, and what members<br />
of the Opposition think, about another<br />
matter he raised-that is, the protection of<br />
a great Australian company, the MLC,<br />
from being taken over by unknown and<br />
undisclosed overseas sources. Does he object<br />
to this? He mentioned it in a speech directed<br />
to the motion of no confidence in the<br />
Government. He did not say whether he<br />
agreed or disagreed. Indeed, it would be<br />
interesting to know.<br />
Let us consider the question of tariffs.<br />
Another member of the Opposition-who,<br />
I notice, during the whole of his speech did<br />
not mention the Leader of the Opposition<br />
by name--spoke on the question of tariffs<br />
at some length and attacked the Government<br />
on its approach. Mr Speaker, this is<br />
the Government's position on tariff policy<br />
as stated in this House, and on the position<br />
of the Tariff Board:<br />
The Government has considered this report in<br />
the context of our established and well tried<br />
tariff policies. There has been no change in these<br />
policies. The Government is committed to ensuring<br />
the growth of a strong manufacturing industry<br />
which is in fact at the very foundation of the<br />
Government's population building policies.<br />
The development of manufacturing industry<br />
is encouraged in many ways, and most notably<br />
by means of the Tariff. The Government has<br />
always been prepared adequately to protect, and<br />
will continue adequately to protect, economic and<br />
efficient industries. The Government will also<br />
afford adequate protection to industries of high<br />
importance from the standpoint of our strategic<br />
or very vital national interests.<br />
Tariff policy has been and remains the responsibility<br />
of the Government, both in general and in<br />
relation to every single decision. It will, ot<br />
course-I would hope that this would be true under<br />
any government--<br />
continue to be the Board's role to advise--<br />
Without instruction on how it is to adviseand<br />
it will continue to be the Government's role.<br />
in determining levels of protection, to decide<br />
whether or not it will follow the advice given.<br />
These have been our policies and they have served<br />
us well. We have no intention of changing them.<br />
In case it should be thought that that statement<br />
of policy, as it has been suggested,<br />
might have led to a lack of confidence in this Government by the business community,<br />
I point out that I have received<br />
today two telegrams from the Associated<br />
Chambers of Manufactures. These are the<br />
people who were supposed-according to<br />
the honourable member for Yarra ( Dr<br />
J. F. Cairns)-to have been so upset. Let<br />
us see whether, in fact, what the honourable<br />
member for Yarra said was happening is<br />
happening. The telegram reads:<br />
This telegram confirms firmest and most sincere<br />
expression of loyalty and support from the Federal<br />
President and Members of the Associated<br />
Chambers of Manufactures of Australia. Australian<br />
industry recognises your Government has<br />
diligently pursued important aims of economic<br />
growth and national and social development.<br />
Would honourable members have expected<br />
that telegram, h. aving listened to the speech<br />
of the honourable member for Yarra? Anybody<br />
who listened to him would not have<br />
done so. Would honourable members have<br />
expected that to support what the Leader<br />
of the Opposition put forward-that the<br />
business community was distressed at the<br />
way in which this Government was acting?<br />
Mr James-Gee, you are a good bloke.<br />
Mr SPEAKER--Order! The honourable<br />
member for Hunter will cease interjecting.<br />
Mr GORTON-The terms of the motion<br />
are that the Government has failed to make<br />
decisions on matters concerning defence.<br />
That has been demonstrated to be untrue.<br />
A further term is that the Government has<br />
failed to make decisions on development.<br />
That received so little credence, even from<br />
members of the Opposition, that it has<br />
scarcely even been mentioned by any<br />
speaker on the Opposition side. A further<br />
term is that the Government has failed to<br />
make decisions on social welfare in the last<br />
year. That has been demonstrated to be<br />
completely untrue. A further term is that<br />
the Government has refused to debate such<br />
matters in the Parliament. Anyone<br />
who reads Hansard will be able to see with<br />
their own eyes that that is untrue.<br />
Some reference was made during the<br />
speech of the Leader of the Opposition to<br />
young Lochinvar. If I remember correctly<br />
the ballad goes on: ' Through all the wide<br />
Border his steed was the best.' If we are<br />
to apply this to those who sit on this side<br />
of the House then I would gladly accept it<br />
as a reasonable description of those who </p>
<p>support me in this place. But what a weak<br />
and puling attack--<br />
Mr James-Dear John.<br />
Mr SPEAKER-Order! I can recognise<br />
the voice of the honourable member for<br />
Hunter almost anywhere, and I do not<br />
appreciate his musical efforts in the House.<br />
If he offends again, I will deal with him.<br />
Mr GORTON-I do not appreciate his<br />
writing me a ' Dear John' letter; it is not at<br />
all appropriate. What a weak and puling<br />
attack this has turned out to be in the way<br />
it has been presented and, indeed, in the way in which it has been spoken to by<br />
members of the Opposition. It is a broken<br />
winded, broken mouthed, broken down old<br />
crock of a motion put by a rider worthy<br />
of that kind of steed. If it has served its<br />
purpose, if it has served any purpose, I am<br />
convinced that it has not served the<br />
purpose of leading anyone to lose any confidence<br />
in what the Government has done<br />
and is doing, but rather it may well have<br />
served the purpose of showing up in stark<br />
relief what little confidence can be placed in<br />
an Opposition and a Leader of an Opposition<br />
who can present such a motion and<br />
support it in such a way.<br />
