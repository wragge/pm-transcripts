Press Statement No: 515<br />
18 June 1975<br />
REGIONAL POLICY<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam, released today a<br />
statement on the Australian Government's policy on regionalism.<br />
The Prime Minister said:<br />
" On 5 February I announced the establishment of a small<br />
committee of Ministers concerned primarily with the Australian<br />
Government's relations with the States. I said the committee<br />
would also examine programs of direct assistance to regional,<br />
local government and local communities; that the Australian<br />
Government has laid considerable stress on the adoption of<br />
a regional approach to planning and decision-making; and that<br />
it was time to consolidate the Australian Government's<br />
initiatives. " Regionalism in Australia is not new. It has been<br />
developed since World War II in a number of States in various<br />
forms and for various purposes.<br />
" The Australian Government has adopted a regional policy<br />
in implementing some of its major new initiatives; the<br />
Australian Assistance Plan and the Area Improvement Program<br />
are notable examples. Agreement has been reached with all<br />
States on the regional boundaries used for Grants Commission<br />
purposes, and which are used for other Australian Government<br />
programs; in most cases these boundaries have been defined<br />
by the States themselves. These boundaries would be open to<br />
review in the light of changing circumstances.<br />
" A regional policy is based on the concept that some<br />
programs and services of government are most efficiently and<br />
effectively planned, co-ordinated, and delivered at a level<br />
intermediate to those of State and Local government. There<br />
are many examples, electricity reticulation, water and sewerage,<br />
hospital facilities, libraries, some welfare-services, and so on.<br />
" Regionalism as it is developing in Australia, and<br />
as envisaged by the Australian Government, is based on the<br />
continued existence of Federal, State, and Local structures.<br />
A wide range of government services would continue to be best<br />
planned and delivered at each of these levels. Clearly,<br />
not all government programs could or should be based on regions. / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
" General acceptance of a regional policy, coupled<br />
with uniform regional boundaries, would enable co-ordination<br />
and harmonisation of those Australian, State and Local programs<br />
delivered at the regional level. The effectiveness of this<br />
co-ordination and harmonisation will be enhanced to the extent<br />
that regional administrative arrangements and organisations<br />
are acceptable to each level of government.<br />
" Integral with the concept of regionalism are the<br />
concepts of devolution of responsibility for, and public<br />
participation in, planning and decision-making. Regionalism.<br />
also opens up the possibilities of decentralisation and<br />
regionalisation of Australian Government administration<br />
to give the community better access to government services and<br />
to improve the effectiveness of the delivery of those<br />
services. The Royal Commission into Australian Government<br />
Administration is examining these possibilities. The Government<br />
has asked the Royal Commission for an early indication of<br />
its views.<br />
Obj ectives " The Australian Government has adopted, as a basis for<br />
its regional policy, the objectives that:<br />
services and programs of the Australian Government<br />
should be provided on a regional basis unless<br />
it is inappropriate to do so, with regard to<br />
efficiency, economy, and effectiveness.<br />
regional bodies or organisations should be<br />
given a responsibility for those services<br />
wherever possible, noting that this responsibility<br />
may range from direct involvement in decisionmaking<br />
through to consultation.<br />
public participation in planning and decisionmaking<br />
for, and implementation of, programs<br />
should be encouraged and assisted.<br />
State and Local Government should be encouraged<br />
to delegate to regional bodies more responsibility<br />
for those States and Local Government programs<br />
which are most appropriately delivered at the<br />
regional level and to foster public participation.<br />
Proposed Action<br />
" A great deal of progress has already been made by<br />
the Australian and State Governments in establishing co-operative<br />
arrangements for the exchange and analysis of information on, and<br />
the planning and delivering of, programs and services at a<br />
regional level. Ministers and officials have been, and are<br />
continuing to be, actively involved. The implementation of<br />
the Australian Government's policy on regionalism will require<br />
consolidation and extension of these co-operative arrangements,<br />
involving the Australian and State Governments and as<br />
appropriate regional bodies, Local Government, and community<br />
groups. </p>
<p>4 S -3-<br />
" Developments will need to be flexible and evolutionary.<br />
State Governments have established regional bodies and regional<br />
programs. Implementation of the Australian Government's<br />
regional policy will take these into account. Precise<br />
arrangements may vary from State to State, and region to region,<br />
to take account of particular circumstances e. g. geographic,<br />
demographic, economic and political. It will take time to<br />
develop fully the skills needed for regional bodies and local<br />
organisations to contribute to, participate in, and make,<br />
major decisions. The Australian Government is already<br />
providing assistance for the development of these skills and<br />
will continue to do so, but is of the view that the skills<br />
will best be developed by experience.<br />
" There will be a need to establish, where they do<br />
not already exist, regional bodies mutually-acceptable to<br />
each level of government and to regional communities. There<br />
will be a need to identify and define the programs most<br />
efficiently and effectively delivered at regional and local<br />
scales and to establish a process of exchange of information<br />
between the levels of government so that programs and services<br />
can be harmonised. " The Committee of Ministers concerned with Australian/<br />
State and Regional relations will have a continuing role in<br />
the development of the Australian Government's regional policy."<br />
