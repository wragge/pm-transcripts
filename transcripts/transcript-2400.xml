FOR PRESS: PM No. 42/ 197 1<br />
PREMIERS' CONFERENCE<br />
Statement by the Pr! ime Minister, Mr. William McMahon<br />
There have been frank discussions today between the State Premiers and the<br />
Commonwealth Treasurer ( Mr. Snedden) and me relating to the financial position of the<br />
States during the Budget year 1970/ 71.<br />
Unanimous agreement has been reached on amounts of special additional<br />
financial assistance to be provided to the States by the Commonwealth in respect of that<br />
year. There was agreement about the need for continued strong resistance to the<br />
inflationiary trends in public authority expenditures on goods and services but at the<br />
same time recognition by the Commonwealth of the difficulties confronting the States<br />
in financing their prospective Budget deficits for 1970/' 71.<br />
The Premiers laid great stress upon the need to reduce their prospective cash<br />
deficits which still remain despite the measures they had taken since February to improve<br />
their financial positions,<br />
With this in mind, the Commonwealth offered additional revenue assistance in<br />
1970/ 71 of $ 43 million. This would be distributed between the States in proportion to<br />
the financial assistance grants ( see attached table).<br />
The Commonwealth's offer was unanimously accepted on the firm understanding<br />
that this additional assistance would be used to reduce the States' revenue deficits and not<br />
to increase expenditure in 1970/ 71 above that following the measures recently taken by<br />
the States. Following the latest revision to the estimated increase in average earnings for<br />
the twelve months ended March 1971, the grants to which the States will nowbe entitled<br />
under the financial assistance grants formula for 1970/ 71 have been revised upwards by<br />
6 million. Taken with the $ 43 million special assistance offered by the Commonwealth,<br />
this increases the revenues available to the States in 1970/ 71 by $ 48. 6 million.<br />
Although there has been some preliminary discussion of the financial problems<br />
likely to be facing the States in 1971/ 72, to which I briefly referred in my opening<br />
statement ( copies have been circulated), it was also unanimously agreed that it was not<br />
practicale to proceed to any definitive proposals about the States possible cash requirements<br />
at this Conference. These questions will be taken up again between the Commonwealth<br />
and the States at a further meeting towards the end of this financial year.<br />
I welcome the degree of co-operation shown between all the Premiers an d<br />
the Commonwealth. I feel it was an example of the sensible working of Commonwealth/<br />
State relationships.<br />

Total of $ 43 million divided between the States in proportion to<br />
their estimated financial assistance grants, including additional<br />
grants of $ 2 per head to New South Wales and Victoria, of<br />
$ 12. 5 million to Western Australia and of $ 103 million to<br />
Tasmania as well as the additional grants to Queensland resulting<br />
from the $ 2 million addition to its base.<br />
That is, additional to the estimates last supplied to the States<br />
on 11 March. The estimated additional grants result from a<br />
recent upward revision to the estimate of the increase in average<br />
wages in the year ended March 1971 from S. 25 per cent to<br />
8. 75 per cent. The final estimate of the increase in average wages,<br />
and hence of the grants, is still subject to considerable uncertainty. </p>
