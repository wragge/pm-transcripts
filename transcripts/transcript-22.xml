<p>tTHE BRITISH COMIMONWEALTH OF NATIONS IN<br />
INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS."<br />
To deal adequately with this tremendous subject is a task<br />
alike beyond my powers and your patience. What I propose<br />
to do, therefore, is to select a few important questions and to<br />
offer some answers to them. In both question. and answer I<br />
will speak for myself, and perhaps for many others. I am not<br />
' here to make * some party pronouncement; nor will I attempt<br />
to deal with. certain current matters which are in the trusted<br />
hands of my colleague, the Minister for External Affairs. But<br />
it may be of value to expose to you my own basic ideas, not as<br />
briefly as either you or I would desire, but at any rate as clearly<br />
-as possible. WHAT IS THE PRESENT STRUCTURE OF THE<br />
BRITISH COMMONWEALTH OF NATIONS?<br />
It is not useful to discuss the merits or otherwise of the<br />
Constitutional Declaration made by the Prime Ministers in<br />
1948, a declaration having particular reference to the position<br />
of India, and by which the Republic of India was recognised<br />
as a member of a Commonwealth in which the King was " the<br />
-head."<br />
( 9 Such discussions may be fruitful for the historian, and are<br />
not without interest to the constitutional theorist, but when<br />
they are retrospective they can contribute little to the work of<br />
statesmanship. C But at least we should not do as we so frequently do-look<br />
the other way and pretend that nothing has happened. Our<br />
celebrated British hostility to deductive logic has its uses. We<br />
have, unlike some Continental peoples, much preferred to establish<br />
our general principles inductively, that is, by taking one<br />
practical step at a time until the pattern of our-action becomes<br />
clear. It is vastly important that we should understand this characteristic,<br />
which is to be seen clearly in the development of the </p>
<p>English common law and in the development of Parliamentary<br />
responsible government. It is because of our instinctively inductive<br />
approach that we have resisted in large measure the<br />
codification of the law.<br />
The Continental mind runs much more easily to the ded'uctive<br />
process; it is disposed to fit events into a pre-determined<br />
pattern; it has a feeling for codification. It is, if I may engage.<br />
in an aside, one of my own personal anxieties that in the course<br />
of this century we have ourselves become more and more involved<br />
in a series of highly-complicated and elaborate paper arrangements<br />
which cut right across the habits of our own minds<br />
and indeed-the genius of our own history.<br />
If it were not for the inductive character of our minds<br />
there would have been no Empire and certainly no British<br />
Commonwealth-, for each was a growth from precedent to precedent<br />
and in no sense represented a logical conclusion from'C<br />
fixed premisses.<br />
Still in spite of all this it is a good thing that every now<br />
and then we should look at the pattern so that we may at least<br />
realise how far we have gone.<br />
There was a time-and only a few years ago-when His<br />
Majesty the King presided over an Empire which included the<br />
British Commonwealth ( the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia,<br />
New Zealand, and. South Africa), the Empire of India,<br />
and an extensive colonial Empire, together with Eire in a transiti<br />
onal stage. This Empire had-racial diversity but structural<br />
unity under the Crown. The King-one King-was the head<br />
of each State for all purposes, external or internal. The British<br />
Empire could as recently at 1944 be described by both Lord,<br />
Halifax and. General Smuts as one of the four " great powers."<br />
This, I have always thought, represented a sound interpretation(<br />
of the famous Balfour formula of 1926 which described the<br />
Dominions as " autonomous communities within the British<br />
Empire, equal in status, in no way subordinate one to another<br />
in any aspect of their domestic or external affairs though united<br />
by a common allegiance to the Crown and freely associated as<br />
members of the British Commonwealth of Nations."~<br />
Three of the phrases in this celebrated statement are occasionally<br />
forgotten. They are:-2 </p>
<p>" within the British Empire";<br />
a common allegiance to the Crown"; and<br />
tBritish Commonwealth of Nations."~<br />
ter all, though the phrase " British Commonwealth" has come I<br />
o widespread use, it was, as we see, declared in 1926 to be a<br />
mrnonwealth within an Empire. The formula thus made it<br />
ar that in spite of the legal independence of the major porns<br />
of the structure, it was still a structure possessing an inral<br />
character and that whatever diversity existed was not<br />
onsistent with the unity of the whole for major international<br />
rposes. i<br />
But great changes have occurred.<br />
There are some enviable people to whom a formula repre-<br />
, ts finality. But the truth is that for better or for worse<br />
ad I will raise no controversy about it) the old structural<br />
ity of the Empire has gone. It has been succeeded by strucal<br />
variety. It may, if the process goes on, give place to a<br />
rely functional association based upon friendship and comin<br />
interest but necessarily lacking the old high instincts and<br />
tantaneous cohesion which sprang from the fact that we<br />
! re, all over the British world, as indeed-we remnain in the old<br />
Yvminions, the King's subjec ' ts and the King's men. The King<br />
in relation to the Republic of India, no longer possessed. of<br />
: ernal juristic significance. As the citizens of India now enter<br />
, on Republican self-government with a President and under<br />
e Parliamentary leadership of their own distinguished states--<br />
in, Pandit Nehru, they are for all internal purposes severed<br />
allegiance to the Crown. There is no King in India. But<br />
r purposes of external association India remains a member<br />
the British Commonwealth of Nations of which the King is,<br />
ice the 1948 decision, declared to be " the head."<br />
We may compare the position of Pakistan where the King<br />
still represented by a Governor-General and, is still through<br />
m the head, of the Government.<br />
Come nearer home to Australia. With us the King is not<br />
erely the symbol and head of an external association but is<br />
niself a real presence in our local self-government. The<br />
overnor-General is his personal representative. The King<br />
, ake-s our statutes by and with the advice and consent of the<br />
mnate and House of Representatives. I am His Majesty's Aus-<br />
-alian Prime Minister. Mr. Chifley is His Majesty's Leader of </p>
<p>the Opposition. The courts are the King's courts and-it is the<br />
King's writ which issues from them. We have an appeal to His<br />
Majesty in Council from certain decisions of our own courts.<br />
Our National Anthem is still ( peace to the broadcasters) " God<br />
Save The King." Every Member of Parliament takes the Oath<br />
of Allegiance. We are royal, not republican; British, wherever<br />
we may be.<br />
Here then we have a new diversity indeed. Our Australian<br />
relationship to the United Kingdom, to Canada, to New Zealand,<br />
to most of the British Commonwealth countries, is structural<br />
or organic. The key-stone of the structure is a common<br />
allegiance to a common King. The relationship of India to the'<br />
United. Kingdom is in large measure functional; an operative<br />
friendship based upon powerful elements, sincerely valued by<br />
the Indian people, but not identical with our own.<br />
Doubtless this development which I have sought to describewas<br />
inevitable. It is the duty of those of us who help to guide<br />
public thinking not to spend our days in vain regrets, but to do<br />
all we can to preserve the many good things that are left and<br />
carefully nurture those new associations which can and must<br />
be of such service to the world.<br />
HAS THE BRITISH COMMONWEALTH BEEN<br />
OUT-MODED BY THE UNITED NATIONS?<br />
In considering whether our sincere support for the United<br />
Nations, its Charter and its agencies, renders the British Cornmonwealth<br />
association less significant, it is as well to look back<br />
for a moment.<br />
At the end of the first world war the League of Nations<br />
was devised as a means for keeping the peace. It failed. There<br />
were m-any reasons for this, which time will not permit me to<br />
discuss. One, however, was so important as to deserve special<br />
mentron. Whenever the strain came on, as in the case of Abyssinia,<br />
the League of Nations failed because, though its paper<br />
obligations were vast, its resources were practically non-existent.<br />
The League failed, not because it tried to do too little but<br />
because it tried to do too much. It was established upon the<br />
basis of contract between independent sovereignties. But the<br />
truth is that the only effectiveness which an international contract<br />
possesses is either that which arises from the goodwill or </p>
<p>sense of honest obligation of the contracting parties, or that<br />
which can be physically enforced. And the means of physical<br />
enforcement are to be found only in the strength of those<br />
parties against whose will the contract has been broken'.<br />
I believe that it is clear that in the few years before the<br />
second war an almost fatal illusion about the st ' rength of the<br />
League of Nations was permeating the democratic mind. At<br />
the same time the so-called intellectuals of the world. began to<br />
insert into the heads of too many people an utterly false dichotomy.<br />
tAre you for power politics?" they said, " Or are you for<br />
r collective security?" When some realistic person spoke up for<br />
armaments behind the Covenant he was promptly told that the<br />
talk must be of disarmament, and that those who spoke otherwise<br />
were mere war-mongers. Yet the truth was that an uinarmed<br />
League of Nations was not only impotent against but<br />
also an invitation to an armed aggressor.<br />
Once again, at the end, of the second world-war, there was<br />
and is a powerful world feeling against its repetition and an<br />
earnest desire to find some effective instrument of peace. An<br />
attempt to forge such an instrument was made at San Francisco.<br />
Remembering the powerlessness of the League of Nations<br />
in grave affairs, the draftsman at San Francisco determined that<br />
in the new Charter the United Nations should, as one advocate<br />
said, be given " teeth." Accordingly they inserted Article 43 of K<br />
the Char-ter, under which all members of the United Nations<br />
undertake to make available to the Security Council, on its call<br />
Eand in accordance with a special agreement or agreements,<br />
armed forces and other facilities for the purpose of maintaining<br />
international peace and security. The agreement or agreements;<br />
are to govern the numbers and types of forces, their degree<br />
of readiness and general location, and the nature of the<br />
facilities to be provided. This scheme, it will be seen, amounts<br />
to no more than a " contract to make a contract," and in fact<br />
no steps have yet been taken under it. It remains to be seen<br />
whether member nations will in fact stand up to this potential<br />
obligation if the circumstances at any given moment render it<br />
politically unpalatable. The real difficulty about a provision of<br />
this kind, to give armed force to the United Nations, is that the<br />
membership is so extensive, and the obligations which may be<br />
incurred can therefore vary so greatly in both time and place,<br />
that it will be in very many instances difficult or even impos-</p>
<p>sible to arouse effective national support for the international<br />
action planned. It is quite true that, with a clear realisation of<br />
this defect, the Western European powers and the United States<br />
of America have more recently put forward great efforts and<br />
shown both imagination and realism by formulating the Atlantic<br />
Pact and arranging defensive co-operation in Weste'rn<br />
Europe. But, though such arrangements ' are usually, for the<br />
sake of conformity, described as " regional arrangements within<br />
the structure of the Charter," they can be much more accurately<br />
described as groupings of power by a limited number of<br />
nations for mutual defensive purposes.<br />
. In brief, they are not in any real sense built upon the foundation<br />
of the Charter, but are a recognition of the inadequacy<br />
of the machinery provided by the Charter.<br />
Let me turn to another aspect of this vitally important<br />
problem. It is conceded, even by those who are most willing to<br />
claim that the Security Council has great achievements to its<br />
credit, that it has been heavily crippled by the existence and<br />
misuse of the veto; that is, the provision in Article 27 of the<br />
Charter which says that decisions of the Security Council on<br />
non-procedural matters shall be made by an affirmative vote<br />
of seven members, including the concurring votes of the permanent<br />
members-one of which is, of course, the Soviet Union.<br />
But I feel strongly that, while there is no doubt that this veto<br />
power has been abused, it is a blunder to think of this abuse as<br />
something which is merely related to an Article in the Charter<br />
or which could be simply remedied by an alteration in the<br />
language of the Charter. If there were no veto provision in the<br />
Charter at all, there would still be one in f act.<br />
Let us suppose that the Security Council met, with a plain<br />
provision for a majority decision, whatever the subject might<br />
be. And let us suppose that, upon a matter of grave internation-<br />
al importance which might lead to war, most of the<br />
members of the Security Council were inclined to m-ake a decision<br />
and to authorise or institute measures of enforcement in<br />
support of it. ' Would they be disposed to carry the matter to<br />
a vote and therefore to action if, say, the Soviet Union were in.<br />
opposition? Or take another case: </p>
<p>Let us assume that the important matter involved a majority<br />
decision by the Security Council that one of the great<br />
powers was guilty of an act of aggression or of a grave breach<br />
of international law. Would, the Security Council, even if free<br />
to do so, make a majority decision and set about enforcing it<br />
against that great power?<br />
If the answer to this question is in the affirmative, then it<br />
represents a notable advance. But at the same time it must be<br />
pointed out that under such circumnstances the forces to be<br />
employed would be the national forces of the great powers con-I<br />
cerned, and not the international force of the United Nations,(<br />
for no such force is as yet available--or even in, distant sight.<br />
I find it very difficult to believe that the great powers<br />
( and, after all, the small ones have little to say to this question<br />
of enforcement) are as yet within measurable distance of en-<br />
Stering into an arrangement under which any one of them may<br />
be declared at fault by the others and, forced into a course of<br />
action contrary to its own will.<br />
This of course is basically the reason why the great powers<br />
insisted upon the veto provisions as a condition of their participating<br />
in the Charter.<br />
We will do better to think of the veto problem as evidence<br />
of the continued existence of a strong nationalist state of mind<br />
than as some defect in a written document.<br />
One authoritative statement has been made tthat Australia<br />
was prepared to accept the veto in respect of enforcemen-t<br />
action, but could see no reason whatever why it should. be ap-11<br />
plied in respect of the peaceful settlement of disputes."<br />
This is an extremely significant statement, because the acceptance<br />
of the veto in respect of enforcement action ( an acceptance<br />
which is, I entirely agree, in line with what we may<br />
call the real facts of international life) means two things.<br />
In the firkt place, it means that no great power, that is,<br />
no permanent member of the Security Council, can be restrained<br />
f rom: aggression by the United Nations, because no<br />
decision in relation to that aggression will ever be given by the<br />
Security Council at all.<br />
This means that the force some day to be placed at the disposal<br />
of the Security Council under the Article to which I have<br />
referred need not be a great one, for a great tpolice force"<br />
7 </p>
<p>would be needed only to restrain a great power, and. the restraint<br />
of the great power is, ex hypothesi, not within the jurisdiction<br />
of the United Nations at all.<br />
In the second place, it means, by inevitable consequence,<br />
that aggressive action by-a great power must, if it is to be restrained.<br />
at all, be restrained by some other great power or<br />
powers acting not under the charter but independent of it.<br />
This, of course, involves the conclusion that the great powers<br />
will and must continue to maintain armed forces of a purely<br />
national character and for purely national purposes.<br />
It may be that the day will come when all the nations of<br />
the world, meeting in a General Assembly of the United<br />
Nations, will elect and control a Security Council as an executive;<br />
will act upon the decisions of that Council; will accept a<br />
body of international law with that substantial obedience which<br />
we now accord to the law in our own, lands; will have alleged<br />
breaches of that law adjudicated upon by the permanent Court;<br />
and will treat as commonplace the enforcement of the Court's<br />
decision by the international policeman.<br />
In that state of the world, aggressive and independent<br />
nationalism will have come to an end; national sovereignties<br />
will have subsided into world citizenships; and national groupings<br />
of whatever kind will be both antiquated and irrelevant.<br />
But that day is not yet, nor, if we are to be f rank with<br />
ourselves, can we pretend that we even see it approaching.<br />
It can be said. with confidence that in the last two years we<br />
have seen nationalistic movements come into powerful development<br />
in many countries which were previously content to be<br />
dependent or controlled.<br />
Thus, in the brief period that has elapsed, since the cessation<br />
of fighting we have seen India and Pakistan come into independent<br />
existence, with a great and at times violent upsurge<br />
of national and racial feeling; we have seen a similar development<br />
in Burma; we in Australia have been the not very neutral<br />
witnesses of a similar movement conducted for the formation<br />
of an Indonesian Republic. All over the world there is a stirring<br />
among races and peoples.<br />
So far from that stirring representing an agitation to create<br />
an international state, to reduce national sovereignty, and<br />
to accept the authority of international bodies, it has repre-</p>
<p>sented nothing so much as an old-fashioned-though newly<br />
expressed--determination to insist upon the prerogative of<br />
each race and community to govern its own affairs and., where<br />
necessary, to throw off the yoke of the foreigner.<br />
These unquestionable facts are no very happy augury for<br />
the oncoming of the international era.<br />
Let us now turn to consider whether the United Nations,<br />
representing a lofty idealism on the part of many of its creators,<br />
but handicapped and. limited as it is by the other matters to<br />
which I hiave referred, reduces in any way the urgent importance<br />
of the British Empire to British people.<br />
Perhaps it will, aid clarity of thought and expression on this<br />
urgent matter if I set out what appear to me to be three convincing<br />
reasons why the British Empire must remain our chief<br />
international preoccupation:<br />
have already discussed the vexed question of the<br />
veto on the Security Council and of the striking limitation<br />
which it imposes upon either the need or the<br />
capacity of the United Nations to maintain substantial<br />
international military forces.<br />
The stark result of these considerations can be set<br />
down in a few sentences.<br />
History has shown that great wars which threaten<br />
mankind are wars which involve great powers. If a<br />
great power is once again to assume the role of aggressor,<br />
an international law-breaker, resistance to<br />
that power must be provided by the strength of some<br />
other great power or powers.<br />
As that resistance cannot, by reason of the Charter,<br />
be organised or controlled by the Security<br />
Council, it must be organised or controlled outside the<br />
Council. In other words, the matter must go as<br />
though there were no United Nations at all. This being<br />
so, a strong, well-knit and well-armed British<br />
Empire is just as essential to-day as far-seeing men<br />
believed it was in 1938.<br />
The San Francisco Conference deliberately separated<br />
the United Nations from the Peace Settlements necessary<br />
to liquidate the world war.<br />
If I may quote Dr. Evatt's words:-<br />
9 </p>
<p>"~ It was never intended that the United. Nations<br />
should be charged with the responsibility for negotiating<br />
and concluding Peace Settlements with Germany,<br />
Austria, Japan, Italy, or the allied German satellites<br />
The Charter was designed to create an<br />
international organisation which could maintain<br />
peace in the future; not an organisation to finish off<br />
the war or to make the Peace Settlements."<br />
This enormously important consideration has been<br />
tragically overlooked, not only by some extravagant<br />
critics of the United Nations, but also by most of its<br />
more extravagant champions. There has been a widespread<br />
disposition to say that the United, Nations has<br />
failed. because both in Europe and in East Asia the<br />
just settlement of the problems of Germany and of<br />
Japan has not yet really been approached.<br />
I point out that while there are grave defects in the<br />
United Nations' conception and structure, the blame<br />
for the state of affairs in Europe and in East Asia cannot<br />
properly be attached to it.<br />
The extravagant friends of the United Nations<br />
have themselves contributed. to this misapprehension<br />
by their single-minded. attempts to concentrate public<br />
interest upon the doings of the United Nations as<br />
if it were the one instrument for the pacification of<br />
the world and as if we therefore owed to it our first<br />
thought and presumably our first loyalty.<br />
The simple truth is that if the Peace Settlements<br />
are not the function of the United Nations, those<br />
Settlements must be negotiated. and, achieved outside<br />
the United Nations. This in turn means that the<br />
Settlement of Europe and the Settlement of Japan<br />
must be a matter between the victorious belligerents<br />
on the one hand ( all of them, not some of them!)<br />
and the defeated. powers on the other.<br />
Once we rid our minds of the rather confused notion<br />
that the Security Council or the General Assembly<br />
of the United Nations has something to do with the<br />
re-settlement of Europe and of East Asia, we will see<br />
much more vividly the elementary truth that, to take </p>
<p>the settlement of Europe as an example, that settlement<br />
cannot be achieved with either the speed or justice<br />
which it merits unless both the United States and<br />
the British Empire are able to go into the negotiations<br />
with the maximum of s trength and authority.<br />
It is useless to think that we solve problems by ignoring<br />
them. If the British Empire is to be regarded<br />
merely as a series of separate even if respectable fragments,<br />
then inevitably the settlement of Europe will<br />
tend-to become a contest between the Soviet Union<br />
on the one hand and the United States on the other,<br />
with the European powers little more than pawns in<br />
the game, and, with Great Britain acting more or less<br />
precariously as an intermediary.<br />
But if the British Empire in truth acts as a great<br />
power, then it can not only alter the character of<br />
the contest, but it can make an immense contribution<br />
to European peace.<br />
It is, I believe, essential to the welfare of Europe<br />
and therefore of mankind that the British Empire<br />
voice in the European Settlement should be both<br />
strong and, clear. For if the United Kingdom is to<br />
speak only for itself, if it is to go to the conference<br />
table weakened to that extent, absorbed by the domestic<br />
problems of its own economic crisis, it will suffer<br />
inevitably from what Kipling called " the webbed and<br />
inward-turning eye," and what should-be a settlement<br />
will tend. to become an old-fashioned bilateral contest<br />
between the Communist autocracy of Russia and<br />
the democratic Capitalism of the United States.<br />
I would not be thought to deprecate in any way<br />
the immense interest and the crucial importahce of<br />
the United States in these matters. That amazing<br />
country has twice in our lifetimes come to the rescue<br />
of freedom in Europe and therefore has, in relation to<br />
Europe, a vital interest and a noble mission. But she<br />
is not a European country in the sense that France is,<br />
or in the sense that the United Kingdom is.. Britain,<br />
steeped in European history and politics, wise and experienced<br />
over the centuries, can contribute, as perhaps<br />
no other power can, to a just settlement. </p>
<p>Indeed, it seems unlikely that there will be a good<br />
and lasting European settlement without a vital and<br />
powerful contribution from her. If that contribution<br />
is to be made, it is quite clear that there must<br />
be the maximum integration of Empire effort, so that<br />
not only may her internal economic problems be relieved.<br />
but her strength in the Council Chamber undoub<br />
ted.<br />
Politics, whether international or national, is an intensely<br />
practical business.<br />
We should constantly remind ourselves of Burke's<br />
celebrated, dictum that we need " to model our principles<br />
to our duties and our situation; to be fully persuaded,<br />
that all virtue which is impracticable is<br />
spurious." And, practical politics, I dare assert, is concerned<br />
with. the problem of how to cope with the next ten or<br />
twenty years so strongly and wisely that there will be<br />
a real foundation of peace upon which a genuine international<br />
organisation can be built.<br />
I return to my earlier statement that a false dichotomny<br />
has been set up between collective security and<br />
power politics. The truth is that in relation to the<br />
making of the Peace Settlements, power politics will<br />
be just as necessary as it was for the winning of the<br />
war. If we understand it aright we will realise that<br />
so far from being an element hostile to the United<br />
Nations, it may turn out to be the most effective<br />
guarantee of the true interests of that infant body.<br />
To concentrate completely upon the affairs of the<br />
United Nations to the exclusion of those other urgent<br />
interests which we have in the British Empire<br />
may well lead us to reg-ard ourselves in our various<br />
parts of the Empire as quite separate. The moment<br />
we do this, the moment we accustom ourselves to that<br />
complete independence of action which appears to be<br />
postulated by the United Nations structure, we will u<br />
more and more find ourselves af raid. of acting as an 01<br />
Empire group for fear of provoking other groups and<br />
so rendering the United Nations unworkable. </p>
<p>After all, if we are to be told that such national<br />
groupings are inconsistent with the United Nations,<br />
our choice becomes the grim one of abandoning those<br />
national groupings or of abandoning the United<br />
Nations. If this be really the choice, then British<br />
people can have little doubt as to how they will re--<br />
solve it-unless they are really existing in that strange<br />
ecstacy of illusion in which they are prepared to drop<br />
the substance for the shadow.<br />
A splendid illustration of this matter can be found<br />
in the present position in Malaya, where the British<br />
Government and Forces are seeking to deal with a<br />
species of insurrection which is not Nationalist but<br />
Communist and draws its inspiration and direction<br />
from Chinese Communism. Australia has decided, as<br />
you know, to render certain Air Force assistance.<br />
Now, if it were a foreign power which held Malaya,<br />
would we assist? Our interest would in one respect be<br />
identical, for Malaya and Singapore lie across the path<br />
of Communist expansion in South-East Asia whether<br />
they are British or not. Yet everybody will concede<br />
that what would have been a difficult and epochmaking<br />
decision if Malaya were non-British was, in<br />
the present circumstances, regarded universally in<br />
Australia as not only right but inevitable.<br />
In all these considerations we can perceive a clear<br />
warning based upon the most practical of considerations,<br />
that we must not allow either the existence or<br />
the particular structure of the United Nations to run<br />
counter to our basic need., never greater than it Is<br />
to-d-ay, for a strong, well-knit and mutually supporting<br />
British Empire.<br />
IS A CONCERTED BRITISH FOREIGN<br />
POLICY POSSIBLE?<br />
This question cannot be answered with any satisfaction<br />
ss we clear our minds on the problem of what are the<br />
cts of a foreign policy.<br />
I will not attempt an exhaustive answer, but I would<br />
[ out hesitation say that the business of foreign policy cer-</p>
<p>tainly includes making and cultivating international friendships,<br />
avoiding war without sacrificing vital principles, and last<br />
but not least, taking every possible step to see that, if war should<br />
come, we enter it with powerful friends and with some reasonable<br />
human assurance of victory. It is indeed, almost an academic<br />
question to ask whether on great matters the countries<br />
of the British Empire should have a common policy. The simple<br />
military truth is that there can be no security for the democratic<br />
world. unless not only all the British countries, but also<br />
the United States of America and the nations of Western<br />
Europe are at one in their defensive arrangements and in the<br />
policies to which those arrangements give expression. In other<br />
words, my proposition is not that it is desirable to have common<br />
policies, but that it is vital to have them.<br />
It is true that we should, distinguish between those policies<br />
which affect all the world and those which are purely regional<br />
in their character. For example, I should be the last to deny,<br />
since my own Government has affirmed it, that Australia has a<br />
perfect right to announce its views on the future of New<br />
Guinea and to back those views by all rational means within its<br />
power. This is in no sense inconsistent with our belief that in<br />
relation to great world issues we are a part of the British family<br />
and believe that we must all act as members of that family.<br />
Again, we in Australia have particular interests in South<br />
East Asia and in the South West Pacific, and upon these our<br />
views are bound, to be strongly held and are entitled to be vigorously<br />
expressed. But nobody need assume from these facts<br />
that we are cutting ourselves adrift from the main currents of<br />
world affairs, or that we regard ourselves as uninfluenced by<br />
them. In the big matters we are, and must be, and. are proud<br />
to be, intimately associated with Great Britain, with our sister<br />
Dominions, with the United States and with. the democratic<br />
powers of Western Europe. There is perhaps some natural disposition<br />
on the part of people so remote from the affairs of<br />
Europe to suppose that we have no vital interest in them. The<br />
strongest corrective to this point of view is to recall that twice<br />
in this century we have been involved in world wars, each of<br />
which began in Europe. To-day the only real threat to a third,<br />
world war comes from the politics, the point of view and the </p>
<p>aggressive actions of the Soviet Union. Europe therefore still<br />
remains a matter of vital concern to us.<br />
Again, it is worth recalling that when the 1914/ 18 war<br />
broke out, the Emperor of Germany was shocked to discover<br />
with what unanimity the countries of the British Empire came<br />
together to resist his attack. Hitler fell into the same error.<br />
Unaware as he was of the psychology and spirit of his possible<br />
opponents he did not realise that, whatever the Constitutional<br />
lawyers might be saying, there is an instinctive unity of feeling<br />
among the British peoples which displays itself instantly in<br />
_ times of trial.<br />
Once again I am disposed to believe, or to fear, that the<br />
rulers of the Soviet Union may mistake our political differences<br />
in our own lands for some spirit of separatism. There<br />
could be no greater blunder. ' We have lived long enough as a<br />
nation to know that the peace of the world is indivisible.<br />
Obviously I cannot within the necessary limits of one<br />
lecture cover the ground, but there are two points of significance<br />
that I would like to make:-<br />
One, there could be no greater danger for a country than<br />
to allow its foreign policy and its defence policy to get out of<br />
harmony. We, for example, in Australia are and have been for<br />
many years committed, to Empire defence co-operation. It<br />
is an open secret that our defence planning is based upon close<br />
consultation with the other British countries, and that in the<br />
preparations we make we always have regard to the preparations<br />
being made by the other British countries. This has bee n<br />
so under Governments of various colours. The Rocket Range<br />
project, for example, established under the Chifley administration,<br />
represents a pooling of knowledge and executive cooperation<br />
between Great Britain and Australia.<br />
But Empire defence co-operation seems to me to become<br />
comparatively pointless if we have not, on the major matters,<br />
a common Empire foreign policy.<br />
We hear a great deal in these days about rights of neutrality.<br />
But how could Australia, for example, co-ordinate her<br />
defence plans with another country if, when the time of crisis<br />
came, that other country stayed neutral.<br />
Iregret to say that for some years up to and including,<br />
1949 there w-as a dangerous divorce in Australia between </p>
<p>foreign policy and defence policy. Foreign policy was based,<br />
first and foremost, upon the Charter of the United Nations<br />
and, as I believe, only in a secondary sense upon the British<br />
Empire. Yet our defence policy has had no real connection<br />
with the United Nations, which has no military strength anyhow.<br />
It has, on the contrary, been strictly related to those particular<br />
countries in the world who can be expected to be allies<br />
in the unhappy event of a third world war.<br />
Two, the other matter which I would like to emphasise relates<br />
to the problem of the machinery of consultation between<br />
the British nations.<br />
This is a necessary consideration, because we cannot hope<br />
to have on great matters common policies without the closest<br />
and most realistic consultation.<br />
Nobody in Australia wants British foreign policy to be<br />
solely controlled by Whitehall, though, after proper exchange<br />
of views, it may well be announced from Whitehall with the<br />
greatest practical effect.<br />
It would be foolish for us to suppose that Great Britain<br />
does not possess a vital interest in South East Asia and the<br />
South West Pacific. Ours may be more direct, more immediate<br />
in point of space or time, but hers is at the same time real<br />
and abiding. Similarly, it is a mistake ( into which some statesmen at<br />
Westminster occasionally fall) to assume that Australia has no<br />
real interest in Europe, in the German Peace Settlement, in<br />
dealings with the Soviet Union. The more I think about these<br />
matters the more satisfied I am that we ought to come back<br />
hard to the central truth that wherever we are in the world we<br />
are one people, with one set of vital interests.<br />
It might be useful for me to point out that there has been<br />
in recent years a remarkable development of international<br />
thought in Australia on this point. You may recall that, when<br />
the Lyons Government in 1935 put through the Commonwealth<br />
Parliament an Act to impose sanctions against Italy in<br />
respect to the Abyssinian affair, there was vigorous opposition<br />
by leading members of the then Opposition-broadly upon the<br />
ground that Australia should not become entangled in overseas<br />
affairs. It was said that although we were parties to the<br />
Covenant of the League of Nations, that Covenant had become<br />
16 </p>
<p>largely a dead letter and, in any event, our best service to peace<br />
was to look after our own business.<br />
This was, as I thought, and still think, a curiously isolationist<br />
view. Yet, in 1943, before the war ended-, the same<br />
party's Minister for External Aff airs made a statement to the<br />
House of Representatives in which he said:-<br />
"~ Australia cannot safely limit her interests even to<br />
the gigantic area of the Pacific. Twice Australia has taken<br />
a prominent part in a world war that commenced because<br />
of European questions. ' With Britain vitally involved so<br />
at once were we. Our concern with Europe cannot be<br />
limited to the waging of wars. We must have some say in<br />
taking steps to prevent wars and in changing the conditions<br />
which are likely to cause wars. In short, we cannot<br />
contract out of Europe. The reason is plain. The<br />
centre of the British Commonwealth and. Empire is in<br />
Europe. From Europe have come all our immigrants. In<br />
peace-time much of our trade was with Europe. Our culture<br />
is European. European colonies are our neigh-bours in<br />
the Pacific and one of the three great powers of Continental<br />
Europe, the Soviet Union, is also a world power and<br />
will be a great force in the Pacific of to-morrow. Therefore<br />
the peace, order and good government of Europe are<br />
vital to us. We are greatly concerned in the European<br />
settlement of the future. We are firmly of opinion<br />
that the time has passed when either the peace or prosperity<br />
of mankind can be regarded as div isible and one,<br />
continent or one nation can be treated in isolation from<br />
another." Now to some people these words point to the new mechanism<br />
of the United Nations. To me, for reasons discussed elsewhere<br />
in this address, they point first and. foremost to the con-<br />
-certing of policies and plans first with British Empire countries,<br />
and second with the other western democracies.<br />
At this stage it is usually said that, good as it may be to<br />
aim at one Empire foreign policy, the aim is impracticable.<br />
For, it is said-, the difficulties of consultation are so great and<br />
the local susceptibilities of the various Dominions so acute,<br />
that effectively unitary action is not possible. Speaking as one<br />
with some knowledge of theory and practice on this question,<br />
I reject this gloomy argument out of hand. </p>
<p>There is at present a good deal of machinery through<br />
which views are exchanged-between the Dominions and the<br />
United Kingdom. Most Dominions maintain High Commissioners<br />
in the other Dominions and in Great Britain, and these<br />
appointments are reciprocated. An able High-Commissioner<br />
will, not only ex officio but by virtue of his own personality,<br />
establish close and' confidential communication with the Government<br />
to which he is accredited.<br />
Great masses of cables are exchanged between what is now<br />
the Commonwealth Relations Office in London and the various<br />
Dominions, though in my past experience these communications<br />
tended to be so excessively diplomatic in form that they", h<br />
lost some of their reality and nervous strength.<br />
Australia has for many years maintained in London a<br />
Liaison Officer between its External Aff airs Department and<br />
the Foreign Office.<br />
Between the two wars, first class work was. done by the'&gt;<br />
Committee of Imperial Defence on Empire defence problems,<br />
the normal representative of any Dominion being its High<br />
Commissioner, with the occasional addition of a visiting Prime<br />
Minister or Minister from his own Dominion.<br />
Occasionally, but irregularly, there are meetings of Prime<br />
Ministers. tesBetween times, Dominions Ministers visit London on mattrofurgent<br />
importance.<br />
Occasion-ally, but, alas, all too rarely, some Minister from,<br />
the United Kingdom will visit a Dominion. But even when&gt;<br />
this has happened, his return to London has on occasion been<br />
shortly followed by his translation to some other sphere of<br />
usefulness. All these matters add up to a substantial amount of<br />
munication. K<br />
Yet I remain convinced that no system of consultation can<br />
be regarded as adequate which has leftr many people i Australia,<br />
including myself, satisfied that decisions of great moment<br />
in this country have occasionally been presented to the<br />
Australian Government and to the Australian people as faits<br />
accomplis.<br />
' I In 1946 there was a partial meeting of Prime Ministers in<br />
18 </p>
<p>London which produced a statement which expressed, with<br />
modi~ fied, rapture, a general approval of the existing methods of<br />
consultation. The statement included a significant observation<br />
that-"~ While all are willing to consider and adopt practical<br />
proposals for developing the existing system it is<br />
agreed that the methods now practised-are preferable to<br />
any rigid centralised machinery."<br />
In this reference to tcentralised machinery" one sees the traditional<br />
opposition to anything that might even appear to in-<br />
, volve control from Downing Street.<br />
It is a point of view which I must respect, since it is advanced<br />
by men of great service and eminence. But I find it<br />
very difficult to appreciate. If six Australian Premiers meet<br />
with the Prime Minister of Australia at Canberra to discuss<br />
, r matters of common interest which do not fall exclusively either<br />
-within the Commonwealth or the States' sphere, nobody reasonably<br />
suggests that the fact that the meeting occurs in Canberra<br />
involves of itself Canberra control. But if there is a<br />
real fear, why not hold-Imperial Conferences in turn in the<br />
various Dominions as well as in London?<br />
However, the argument for a permanent Empire secretariat,<br />
an argument which in the case of Australia goes back<br />
at least to Alfred Deakin's presentation of it in 1907, may,<br />
having regard to the 1946 conversations, be treated as temporarily<br />
out of Court.<br />
Is there, then, no alternative? I believe that there is such<br />
an alternative, and that it can concurrently take several forms.<br />
I suggest that, just as before the war, we had. a Committee of<br />
Imperial Defence so we could, with great usefulness, set up a<br />
Committee on Imperial Foreign Policy, to sit in London and<br />
to be attended by the Foreign Secretary representing the<br />
~' United-Kingdom Government and by the High Commissioners<br />
or visiting Ministers representing each Dominion.<br />
It should sit regularly, an'd its work should be regarded as<br />
of major importance. I suggest also that as the 1946 fear was<br />
of " trigid centralised machinery" we should. adopt the alternative<br />
and-go for flexible localised-machinery or, in brief, the<br />
establishment of a small British Empire secretariat in each<br />
Dominions capital. </p>
<p>What I have suggested on this point is very much in line<br />
with suggestions made by Mr. Paul McGuire in his recent brilliant<br />
book " Experiment in World Order." He was good enough<br />
before writing this book to discuss his proposals on this matter<br />
with me, and they command my warm approval. After all,<br />
we will best understand, how to attack the problem of consultation<br />
if we first ask ourselves'-" What is consultation designed<br />
to do?" Let me endeavour to answer this question in a few sentences.<br />
Consultation is designed to produce complete mutual<br />
understanding and a community of ideas leading to common<br />
policies and concerted action. If consultation is to do this-, it<br />
must occur at the right time, that is, before decisions are made<br />
or even half-crystallised. There is nothing more irritating, as<br />
I know from-my own earlier experiences, than to be presented<br />
with some almost adopted conclusion, with a request for concurrence<br />
and, in effect, a hint that negotiations have proceeded<br />
so far that a failure to concur may prove embarrassing. If consultation<br />
is to occur early enough to be effective it is quite obvious,<br />
having regard to the state of flux in which human aff airs<br />
exist, that it must possess continuity. The work of collating<br />
and exchanging f acts and ideas must therefore not be merely<br />
done ad hoc but with permanency.<br />
I know that there exists in some minds a grave fear that<br />
this integration of the Empire mind and the Empire effort,<br />
which I unhesitatingly advocate, will give rise to hostilities in<br />
other countries, and that therefore we must at all times avoid<br />
creating the impression that there is " an Empire bloc." This<br />
view seems to me to be so pusillanimous and so basically wrong<br />
that I can with difficulty discuss it with patience.<br />
The problem is not one of lining up the countries of the<br />
British Empire against the world but of associating the countries<br />
of the British Empire in the world. My plea is not for<br />
some half-baked notion of the British Empire beating the<br />
drum and throwing out its chest and telling the rest of the<br />
world to " come on." It is a much graver and more rational<br />
notion than that. It is, in brief, that we have gone on long<br />
enough emphasising our points of difference and insisting upon<br />
our utter independence. If we devote too much of our energy.<br />
much longer to this constant assertion that we are adult nations, </p>
<p>people will merely begin to doubt whether we are grown up<br />
at all. What we need, for all the compelling reasons which I have<br />
indicated earlier, is a re-integration of our thought and of our<br />
effort, a new vision of Empire.<br />
IS EMPIRE UNITY INCONSISTENT WITH<br />
AMERICAN CO-OPERATION?<br />
It is clear that a closely-knit British Commonwealth,<br />
though it will have great strength, cannot for very long stand<br />
alone. This simple but cogent truth has been demonstrated in<br />
both of the great wars in this century. We must therefore<br />
consider what is our greatest practical international problem,<br />
that of our relations with the United States. We do badly to<br />
think this problem is a simple one. There are those who seem to<br />
feel that America's colossal unitary strength makes British<br />
Empire corporate strength less important.<br />
" The centre of gravity of democracy," they say, " has<br />
moved West. Let us accordingly re-arrange not only our policies<br />
but our point of view. Great Britain is vulnerable and<br />
economically hard-pressed. Canada is in the American orbit.<br />
South Africa is troubled and internally uneasy. The new<br />
nations of the Indian sub-continent are moving away from us.<br />
We are on the defensive in South-East Asia. Australia and New<br />
Zealand are isolated and, not rich in numbers. Let us be realistic,<br />
think less of our old Empire associations and move as far<br />
as possible into the American hemisphere." That is one view,<br />
not without some currency. It is in my opinion a pessimistic<br />
and distorted, and, therefore, unreal view.<br />
To me it seems fantastic to suppose that a British Commonwealth<br />
which has performed such prodigies twice in the<br />
last 3 5 years should be so casually discarded as worn-out or purposeless.<br />
It is perhaps not an inappropriate occasion to say that,<br />
in the two great testing periods of this century, the British family<br />
of nations has demonstrated its strength and its vitality, not<br />
its weakness or its decadence.<br />
A second view goes to the other extreme. It has been unconsciously<br />
influenced by the subtle and pervasive Communist<br />
propaganda about " American Imperialism." It says in effect<br />
that we should avoid American involvement and retain our </p>
<p>character as a third power, independently placed, taking no<br />
sides hastily, acting as the honest broker in the disputes between<br />
the totalitarian East and the democratic West. This<br />
view, -which I have encountered, in some places, is a form of<br />
isolationism which has no relation to modern international life.<br />
The truth, as I see it, can be put into a few sentences. We, the<br />
British peoples of the world, need the Americans. The Americans<br />
need us. America has on two historic occasions learned<br />
that the peace of the world is not divisible. On two occasions,<br />
in a war which many of her people thought no business of<br />
theirs, she has become a belligerent and has in the final result<br />
weighed down the scales in favour of freedom. It is, therefore,,<br />
idle to say to any enlightened American that what happens in<br />
Europe is no concern of his, or that what happens to Australia<br />
or New Zealand is no concern of his. He knows that predominant<br />
power means predominant responsibility. He knows that<br />
the overthrow of Great Britain would mean that domination of<br />
Europe by the common enemy and would lead-to an American<br />
isolation which would be for the American people not merely<br />
ominous, but disastrous. He, therefore, knows that Great.<br />
Britain is a bastion of liberty, and Western Europe the frontier<br />
in any crucial fight. I do not for one moment believe that any<br />
responsible American leader wants to have a weak Great Britain<br />
or a weak British Empire. The best support for this view<br />
is to be found in the magnificent post-war battle by the United<br />
States, through Marshall Aid and other means, for the restoration<br />
of the other Western democracies and for the drawing of<br />
a clear line against Imperialist aggression.<br />
Corr . espondingly, it is impossible to believe that there is<br />
among our own people any jealousy or resentment of America's<br />
activities. After all, America has not become our friend and<br />
defender simply for love of the countries we inhabit. On the<br />
contrary, she knows that, in the most real sense, we are the<br />
same kind of people, with the same ideas, with the same ideals,<br />
with the same high faith, with the same basic belief that governments<br />
exist for the people, that they are the servants and not<br />
the masters. It is a tragedy that the world should be divided<br />
at all; but if it is, we may at least be comf orted by the recollection<br />
that it is divided between those who believe in the spirit<br />
and significance of man and those who believe in power for<br />
its own sake. </p>
<p>It follows from all this that the American and the British<br />
peoples have strong bonds not only of common interest but of<br />
common spiritual values. The case for our co-operation Is<br />
therefore complete. That there is much work to be done before<br />
we arrive at a complete mutual understanding nobody can<br />
doubt. The special arrangements between the British peoples<br />
which found, their expression in the Ottawa Agreements may<br />
sometimes seem to the American citizen to represent a policy<br />
of exclusion and almost of superiority. Yet we know that such<br />
arrangements were designed merely to develop our internal<br />
strength and give expression to our belief that prosperity within<br />
the British family must tend to-reflect itself in prosperity for<br />
the rest of the world. We, in our turn, must recognise that our<br />
British Commonwealth policies should, not be pursued in such a<br />
fashion as to give rise to a feeling that we regard, America as a<br />
potential enemy, either economic or military. Enmity between<br />
the British Commonwealth and, the United States would indeed<br />
be disastrous to the freedom of man. While we preserve our<br />
British character, therefore, we must be assiduous in the task<br />
of establishing not only understanding but co-operation with<br />
the United States. We need each other.<br />
This may all be well illustrated by reference to the current<br />
movement for Western Europe unity in which Great Britain<br />
must obviously play so great a part.<br />
When I was last in the United States a little more than<br />
eighteen months ago, I encountered a disposition in some quarters<br />
to think that Great Britain must make her choice between<br />
her own Commonwealth and Western European union. This<br />
seemed and. seems to me to be a false choice. It seems to assume<br />
that the British Dominions have no vital concern with Europe,<br />
and that Great Britain herself, therefore, is in the classical position<br />
of saying, "' How happy could I be with either, were t'other<br />
fair charmer away." But once it is understood that we of the<br />
King's Dominions have an interest in Europe, out of which the<br />
two great wars of our history have come, it becomes clear that<br />
the real task is not to make a choice but to make a reconciliation.<br />
That Great Britain, now that the old days of keeping<br />
the balance of power in Europe have gone, should accept direct<br />
and primary European responsibilities is inevitable. The practical<br />
task of statesmanship is to see that whatever she does in<br />
that sphere should be done not only in consultation with the </p>
<p>other British countries but with their co-operation. Provided<br />
consultation exists not oniy on the highest level but with the<br />
most complete permanent means of mutual exchange on facts<br />
and views, there is no reason why British participation in<br />
Western European stability should not be in the widest and<br />
best sense of the term tBritish" and not merely that of the<br />
United Kingdom.<br />
The wider the interest,. the wider should be the co-operation;<br />
the more vital the interest, the more vital should be the<br />
participation of all concerned. I for one am confident that<br />
with sensible and sensitive statesmanship the United States, the<br />
United Kingdom and all the British Commonwealth countries<br />
will find themselves working together and, if necessary, fighting<br />
together to preserve freedom in a world which knows so<br />
much about it in theory and in so many places practises it so<br />
little. CONCLUSION.<br />
Let me return, in conclusion, to the nature of the British<br />
Commonwealth. It is more than a group of friendly powers.<br />
It is more than a series of concerted economic interests.<br />
It is and must be a living thing-not a corpse under the<br />
knives of the constitutional dissectors.<br />
It would be the tragedy of our history if what began as a<br />
splendid adventure and grew into a proud brotherhood should<br />
end up as a lawyer's exercise. When the Empire ceases to be<br />
an inner feeling as well as an external association, virtue will<br />
have gone out of it.<br />
In every war the fires of patriotism burn high. After<br />
every victory they seem to dwindle and smoulder. Sometimes<br />
they seem-dead. True sentiment becomes condemned as mere<br />
sentimentality, and we become the victims of a curious reluctance<br />
to show abroad our love for and our pride in the land of<br />
our birth and, those other lands to which our fathers of old<br />
went with light and, liberty. Yet we have much matter for<br />
honest pride. When we suddenly realise that a great country<br />
like India has at a stroke achieved Parliamentary self-government<br />
as a Republic, let us waste no time in melancholy yearnings<br />
after the past. </p>
<p>Let us, on the contrary, remember that Parliamentary<br />
government, democratic public administration, the rule of law,<br />
the justice of right and not of privilege, were our peculiar British<br />
gifts to India. That the people of India should have proved<br />
apt pupils is no matter for regret; it was, on the contrary, the<br />
end purpose of our presence. I would like to be able to say to<br />
all the British people of the world-, if they cared to listen to so<br />
small a voice, that our true brotherhood must be a matter of<br />
feeling and not merely a matter of thought; no vain glory, no<br />
arrogant sense of power, no jingoism, but an unquenchable<br />
sense of common destiny and common duty and, common instinct.<br />
To many people the British Empire is a curious machine<br />
that has worked; looking to the outsider rather like a Heath<br />
Robinson invention; but relied upon by mankind twice during<br />
this century, to their great deliverance. But what does it<br />
mean to you? I think I know what it means to me. May I<br />
break through our usual polite reticences and tell you?<br />
To me-the British Empire means ( and here you will finda<br />
curious jumble in both time and. place) a cottage in the wheat<br />
lands of the North West of the State of Victoria, with the<br />
Bible and Henry Drummond and Jerome K. Jerome and. tThe<br />
Scottish Chiefs" and Burns on the shelves. It means the cool<br />
green waters of the Coln as they glide past the church at Fairford;<br />
the long sweep of the Wye Valley above Tintern, with a<br />
Wordsworth in my pocket; looking north across the dim<br />
Northumbrian moors from the Roman Wall, with the rowan<br />
trees on the slope before me, and two thousand years of history<br />
behind; old colour and light and soaring stone in York Mmister.<br />
It means King George and Queen Mary coming to their<br />
Jubilee in Westminster Hall as Big Ben chimed out and Lords<br />
and Commons bowed, and, as they bowed, saw beyond the form<br />
of things to a man and a woman greatly loved. It means<br />
Chequers, and, from the crest beyond, that microcosm of history<br />
in which you may, with one sweeping glance, see the marks<br />
of British trenches, the " Roman Road to Wendover," the broad<br />
Oxford plains, and. ( by the merest twist) the plumed figure of<br />
John Hampden walking through the fields to the church whose<br />
spire is just to be seen, at Great Kimble, to address the gentlemen<br />
of Buckinghamshire on Shipmoney. It means, at<br />
Chequers, Winston Churchill, courage and confidence radiating<br />
f rom him, the authentic note of the British lion in his </p>
<p>voice, the listening world marvelling at how such triumph<br />
could be built upon such disaster. It means the Royal. Mile at<br />
Edinburgh, and a toast from kilted clansmen in the Valley of<br />
the Tay, and a sudden cold wind as I came one day up from a<br />
Yorkshire dale. It means laughter in Lancashire; Jack Hulbert<br />
and Cicely Courtneidge. It means Australian boys in tired<br />
but triumphant groups at Tobruk and, Benghazi; Cunningham<br />
at Alexandria, with his flashing blue eyes, talking to me of the<br />
Australian, Waller; Australian airmen in Canada, in Great<br />
Britain, all over the world. It means, at Canberra, at Wellington,<br />
at Ottawa, at Pretoria, the men of Parliament meeting as<br />
those met at Westminster seven hundred. years ago; at Melbourne<br />
the lawyers practising the Common Law first forged.<br />
at Westminster. It means Hammond at Sydney, and Bradman<br />
at Lords, and McCabe at Trent Bridge, with the ghosts of<br />
Grace and, Trumble looking on. It means a tang in the air;<br />
a touch of salt on the lips; a little pulse that beats and shall.)<br />
beat; a decent pride; the sense of a continuing city. It means<br />
the past ever rising in its strength to forge the future.<br />
Is all this madness? Should I have said-, as clever, modern<br />
men are wont to do,. that the British Empire means an integral<br />
association of free and equal nations, whose mutual rights and<br />
obligations you will find set out in the Balfour Formula and<br />
the Statute of Westminster? Or should I have watered it down,<br />
as some would have us do, and define the British Empire in<br />
terms of friendship, or alliance, or pact, as if we were discussing<br />
an Anglo-Portuguese treaty?<br />
A plague take such notions. Unless the British Empire is)<br />
to British people all over the world a spirit, a proud-memory,<br />
a confident prayer, courage for the future, it is nothing.<br />
" It may be that the gulfs will wash us down:<br />
it may be we shall touch the Happy Isles<br />
And, see the great Achilles, whom we know.<br />
Tho' much is taken, * much abides; and tho'<br />
We are not now that strength which in old days<br />
Moved earth and heaven; that which we are, we are;<br />
One equal temper of heroic hearts,<br />
Mad-e weak by time and fate, but strong in will<br />
To strive, to seek, to find, and' not to yield." </p>
