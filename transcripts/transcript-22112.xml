    <content><![CDATA[<p>Given the devastation caused by the current bushfires in Victoria I have authorised additional Commonwealth support in the form of ex gratia payments to those who have lost their homes or whose principal place of residence has been rendered uninhabitable.</p>
<p>This will be over and above the support to be given by the Australian Government to the Victorian Government under the long standing Natural Disaster Relief Arrangements.</p>
<p>The additional relief will amount to $1,000 per eligible adult and $400 per eligible child.  People who are entitled to this additional assistance will now be able to apply to Centrelink (Hotline number:   132 850) immediately to meet emergency needs.</p>
<p> Under the normal Natural Disaster Relief Arrangements the Australian Government will reimburse the Victorian Government half of all its expenditure on personal hardship and distress relief assistance to bushfire victims (such as emergency food, accommodation, clothing and replacement of essential household items), once expenditure of that kind from the current bushfires exceeds $240 000.  This will clearly be the case.</p>
<p>On top of these payments, in any one year the Australian Government reimburses 50 or 75 per cent of eligible state expenditure above certain thresholds ($64.1 million and $112.2 million in the case of Victoria) for personal hardship and long term recovery measures for natural disasters, such as infrastructure repair and concessional loans.</p>
<p>Under these Arrangements the Australian Government has reimbursed Victoria over $30 million for natural disaster events since 2003 04.</p>
<p>  I have been in regular discussion with the Victorian Premier, Mr Steve Bracks, in regard to the bushfires.  I last spoke to him on Australia Day offering any additional practical Commonwealth assistance which might be needed on the fire fighting front.</p>
<p> In a bid to better combat the bushfire menace, in September 2004 I announced the Australian Government would provide a further $24 million over three years towards better bushfire preparedness, mitigation and awareness. The Australian Government also provided $16.5 million in the 2004 05 Budget for the National Aerial Fire Fighting Centre.</p>
<p> I know that all Australians greatly admire the efforts of our fire fighters and other emergency management services.  We all trust that the more benign weather conditions in Victoria will continue thus providing longer term relief from the bushfire menace.  </p>
