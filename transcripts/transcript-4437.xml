~ AUSTRALIA&amp; July 1977<br />
ELECTORATE TALK<br />
This week, millions of Australians have received more cash in<br />
their pay packets simply because of the Government's personal<br />
income tax indexation policies. The amounts of extra " take-hone"<br />
pay are significant.<br />
For example, a taxpayer with a dependent spouse earning a weekly<br />
wage of $ 200 which is about the level of average weekly<br />
earnings will have his weekly take-home pay boosted by<br />
$ 3.45. This represents an annual benefit of $ 187.50.<br />
A taxpayer with a dependent spouse, earning $ 12,000 a year will be<br />
$ 257.50 better off; a taxpayer earning $ 13,000 a year will be<br />
$ 310.70 better off.<br />
The Government tax indexation policy not only affects the income<br />
tax scale, but also tax rebates. For instance, the general<br />
concessional rebate of $ 540 that applied in 197S/ 76 moved to<br />
$ 610 last financial year and will increase to $ 676 this current<br />
financial year.<br />
Tax indexation does one simple thing it guarantees protection<br />
to the community from unlegislated tax increases brought about<br />
by inflation. In times of inflation Australian taxpayers<br />
with increasing incomes have found themselves pushed into high<br />
tax brackets under the progressive income tax scale.<br />
As a result, they were really no better off than they were before<br />
the wage increase and in some cases they were, in fact, worse off.<br />
Last year, within a few months of the election, we stopped this<br />
tax drain. In May last year, the law was amended to make sure<br />
that indexation adjustments would occur automatically each year.<br />
This law guarantees ' taxpayers that adjustments would be made to stop<br />
inflation pushing the'm into higher tax brackets. There was an<br />
indexation adjustment on July 1 last year, another one a few days<br />
ago, and the next will occur in July 1978, and so on.<br />
So taxpayers are continuing the reap the gains from tax indexation. ./ 2 </p>
<p>I think it is worth making the point that the Liberal/ NCP government<br />
introduced tax indexation in a time of severe economic restraints.<br />
In revenue terms, the cost to the government has been considerable.<br />
As a result of tax indexation from July 1 last year to June<br />
next year, the government will take about $ 2,000 million less from<br />
taxpayers than would otherwise have been the case.<br />
In Australia now, for the first time, we have moved away from<br />
the days when inflation and high taxation increases went hand in<br />
hand. We have broken that link that was so destructive.<br />
Tax indexation along with other reforms such as the Family<br />
Allowance programme is providing more than just extra money<br />
resources to Australians. It is, in no small way, helping to<br />
reassert independence for many thousands, and in turn to enhance<br />
personal dignity and self-respect.<br />
It is that kind of achievement that this Government continually seeks.<br />
