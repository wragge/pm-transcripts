    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to announce $15 million over five years for a new African Governance Facility.</p>
<p> The new Facility will focus on strengthening democracy and good governance in both government and non-government organisations.</p>
<p>It will enhance democratic processes by providing expert advice about electoral, judicial and legislative reform.  Electoral processes underpin the operation of democracies.  Australia will support a wide range of activities such as voter registration and electoral education.</p>
<p>Australia will provide policy and management expertise in economic and financial governance and will work with African organisations to reduce the debilitating impact of corruption.</p>
<p>Australian experience in implementing public sector reform will be used to encourage governments to be more responsive in the delivery of essential services.</p>
<p>A significant amount of funding under the Facility will be directed to trade and economic development to assist African countries enhance their trade policies, increase their engagement with the World Trade Organisation and improve their capacity to participate in and benefit from the global economy.</p>
<p>The new Facility builds on Australia';s existing commitment to governance activities in Africa, bringing our total contribution to $47 million since 1999.</p>
