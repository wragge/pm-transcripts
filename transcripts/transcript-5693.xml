FOR MEDIA THURSDAY,' 19 NOVEMBER, -1981<br />
PRESIDENT REAGAN'S PEACE PLAN<br />
Last night, President Reagan issued an invitation to all nations<br />
to join in the quest for peace, security and freedom across<br />
the globe. I welcome this invitation.<br />
Successive Australian Governments have worked hard to secure<br />
balanced and verifiable arms control measures and for an improved<br />
nuclear non-proliferation regime which would prevent both the<br />
spread of nuclear weapons and their qualitative improvement.<br />
In what is probably the most important statement on peace to hlave<br />
been made in recent years, President Reagan has proposed a<br />
comprehensive four-point plan which, if implemented, would secure<br />
global peace and prosperity. These four points are: first,<br />
the United States to cancel its deployment of Pershing II and<br />
cruise missiles if the Soviet Union dismantles its vast stock<br />
of SS-20, SS-4 and SS-5 missiles; second, the superpowers to<br />
engage in Strategic Arms Reduction Talks, which the President<br />
has termed START; third, lower levels of conventional forces<br />
in Europe;. fourth, measures to reduce the risks of surprise<br />
attack and the chance of war arising out of uncertainty or<br />
miscalculation. The programme is as bold as it is comprehensive. For<br />
President Reagan has not started from any misconception about<br />
relative armament levels between East and West. The picture he<br />
paints of the growth of Soviet military power over recent years<br />
is indeed sombre. Such growth cannot but reflect on the<br />
intentions of the Soviet Union. Taking advantage of Western<br />
restraint, the Soviets have built up massive nuclear as well as<br />
conventional forces, which they can project not only in Europe<br />
but in other regions as well.<br />
Despite the provocation inherent in this situation of Soviet<br />
armed strength, President Reagan is proposing mutual Soviet<br />
and Western measures which would reverse present trends in arms<br />
deployment. This is statesmanship of the highest order.<br />
Thus the four point programme proposes not simply the limitation<br />
( th-e of the SALT process) of nuclear systems but rather the<br />
reduction of each sides' holdings of these weapons. / 2 </p>
<p>2<br />
I join with President Reagan as all responsible world<br />
leaders will in calling on the Soviet Union to match this<br />
boldness of vision. The Soviet Union must play its part in<br />
reducing the risks of war, in -improving the prospects for peace<br />
and in creating the climate for the advancement of individual<br />
rights and economic prosperity.<br />
It is clear that President Reagan's four point plan cannot be<br />
implemented unless both the United States and the Soviet Union<br />
negotiate together. President Reagan has again drawn attention<br />
to the fact that a secure and pacific world demands that arms<br />
levels not be reduced unilaterally. Success can only come if<br />
the Soviet Union will share the United States' commrnitment.<br />
The concept of peace enshrined in President Reagan's statement<br />
transcends the mere absence of war. Rather it envisages a<br />
flowering of economic growth and prosperity and the development<br />
of individual liberty in a world at peace.<br />
Last month, inf Melbourne, leaders of forty-one nations meeting<br />
under the Commonwealth banner confirmed a Common belief in<br />
just such principles of international relations for the<br />
realisation of which President Reagan's statement gives even<br />
more hope. President Reagan's invitation is a challenge to<br />
the Soviet Union which, if accepted, will provide the basis<br />
for a consensus which hitherto seemed beyond grasp.<br />
