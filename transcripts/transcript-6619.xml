SPEECH BY 7HE PRIME MINISTER<br />
PARLIAMENTARY LUNCHEON IN HONOUR UF HU YAUBANG<br />
GENERAL SECRETARY OF THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE OF THE<br />
COMMUNIST PARTY OF CHINA<br />
CANBERRA 15 APRIL 1985<br />
Youk EXCELLENCY GENERAL-SECRETARY Hu, DISTINGUISHED LEADERS<br />
OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF CHINA AND SENIOR REPRESENTATIVES<br />
OF THE GOVERN4MENT OF CHINA AND OF SHANGHAI MUNICIPALITY,<br />
AMBASSADOR NIE, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.<br />
ON BEHALF OF MY COLLEAGUES IN THE GOVERNMENT AND IN THE<br />
PARLIAMENT, AND ON BEHALF OF THE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE, MAYI<br />
WELCOME YOU FORMALLY To AUSTRALIA.<br />
YOUR VISIT FOLLOWS THE VERY PRODUCTIVE EXCHANGE OF VIS! TS<br />
BETWEEN PREMIER ZHAO AND MYSELF IN 1983 AND 1984. IT<br />
PROVIDES THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO<br />
EXPRESS TO YOU THE PROFOUND IMPORTANCE AUSTRALIA ATTACHES<br />
TO ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH CHINA AND THE HIGH REGARD THAT<br />
WE HAVE FOR YOUR NATION AND FOR ITS ACHIEVEMENTS IN RECENT<br />
YEARS. </p>
<p>UNDER THE LEADERSHIP O. F YOUR PARTY, THE OUTPUT AND<br />
EFFICIENCY OF CHINA'S AGRICULTURAL SECTOR HAVE DEVELOPED<br />
DRAMAT ICALLY.<br />
BETWEEN 1953 AND 1978 YOUR AGRICULTURAL OUTPUT GREW<br />
UNEVENLY AND SLOWLY. YOU TRIPLED THE RATE OF GROWTH AFTER<br />
1979 AND IN 1984I ACHIEVED A FURTHER DOUBLING TO 141.5 PERCENT.<br />
, THIS HAS BEEN ACHIEVED BY A RESTRUCTURING OF YOUR AGRICULTURAL<br />
/ ECONOMY, GIVING GREAT FREEDOM TO FARMING HOUSEHOLDS NOT ONLY<br />
ITO PRODUCE MORE BUT ALSO TO ENRICH THEIR LIVES. MORE MAJOR<br />
TASKS, OF BUILDING RURAL INDUSTRY AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY, TO<br />
MEET CONSUMER NEEDS, LIE AHEAD.<br />
Now YOU ARE CARRYING" THE ECONOMIC REFORMS INTO THE CITIES<br />
OF CHINA. 1HERE HAVE ALREADY BEEN CONSIDERABLE ACHIEVEMENIS.<br />
] HE AVERAGE ANNUAL GROWTH OF CONSUMPTION FROM 1955 TO 1L978<br />
WAS 2.2 PERCENT AND THAT FROM 1979 TO 19814, AFTER ALLOWING<br />
FOR INFLATION, WAS 7.5 PERCENT.<br />
IN 198' 4, TO HASTEN THE PACE OF GROWTH AND MODERNIZATION,<br />
YOU ADOPTED POLICIES ALLOWING MORE OPEN ECONOMIC AND<br />
OTHER CONTACTS WITH OTHER COUNTRIES,<br />
IN OCTOBER 19814 YOU MADE A FUNDAMENTAL COMMITMENT THAT THE<br />
SWEEPING REFORMS IN AGRICULTURE SHOULD BE APPLIED TO<br />
INDUSTRY AND THAT IN FUTURE THE SERVICE SECTOR AND THE<br />
NEEDS OF CONSUMERS WOULD HAVE HIGH PRIORITY. </p>
<p>YOUR 7TH 5-YEAR PLAN ( 1986-1990) ENVISAGES THE CON, INUATTON<br />
OF ALL THESE POLICIES AND MANY MORE IMPORTANT DEVELOPMENTS<br />
IN LHINA. iHESE ARE OF GREAT SIGNIFICANCE ALSO TO<br />
AUSTRALIA AS THERE ARE MANY AREAS WHERE WE CAN MAKE DIRECT<br />
INPUTS INTO THE PROCESS TO OUR MUTUAL BENEFIT,<br />
WHAT YOU ARE DOING IS NOT EASY. THE AUSTRALIAN GoVERN4MENT<br />
IS TRYING TO MAKE CHANGES IN A SOCIETY OF 15 MILLION.<br />
YOU ARE TRYING TO MAKE PROFOUND CHANGES IN A SOCIETY OF<br />
ONE BILLION, EQUAL TO THE POPULATION OF THE WORLD IN 1850.<br />
YOU HAVE OUR ADMIRATION FOR THE COURAGE, DETERMINATION<br />
AND DEDICATION WITH WHICH YOU ARE PURSUING THESE NEW<br />
DIRECT IONS.<br />
I WOULD LIKE TO ASSURE YOU OF THE SUPPORT OF THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
PEOPLE FOR WHAT YOJ ARE SEEKING TO ACHIEVE: A MODERN<br />
EFFICIENT NATION COMMITTED TO A STABLE AND PROSPEROUS REGION.<br />
YOUR VISIT, GENERAL-SECRETARY, IS AN HISTORIC ONE<br />
IT MIARKS AN IMPORTANT STEP IN THE PROGRESS OF<br />
OUR BILATERAL RELATIONS<br />
IT ALSO MARKS AN IMPORTANT ScTEP IN THE PROGRESS<br />
OF OUR REGION TOWARDS PEACE AND HARMONY.<br />
ALTHOUGH WE HAVE DIFFERENT SOCIAL SYSTEMS WE HAVE ESTABLISHED<br />
A WARMTH OF FRIENDSHIP THAT WILL ENABLE OUR RELATIONS TO<br />
CONTINUE TO PROSPER. </p>
<p>GENERAL-SECRETARY, iN THE NEXT TWO DAYS WE WILL BE HOLDING<br />
DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE BREADTH OF OUR COMMON INTERESTS AND<br />
THE WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN WORK TOGETHER TO CONTRIBUTE TO<br />
THE HARMONIOUS DEVELOPMENT OF THE ASIA-PACIFIC REGION.<br />
IHAVE PLEDGED TO YOU OUR SUPPORT FOR THE GROWTH OF YOUR<br />
NATION AND THE WELFARE OF YOUR PEOPLE.<br />
AUSTRALIA'S GROWTH OVER THE PAST TWO DECADES HAS BECOME<br />
I/! NTIt'ATELY LINKED TO THAT OF THE ASIA PACIFIC REGION.<br />
TWILL REMAIN SO LINKED IN THE DECADES AHEAD AND THE<br />
LINKAGE WITH CHINA WILL GROW STJLL MORE CRUCIAL WITH 1HE'<br />
YEARS.<br />
THE VERY SCALE AND DIVERSITY OF THE OPPORTUNITIES IFOR ", UTUAL,<br />
BENEFIT OFFER A CHALLENGE AND AN OPPORTUNITY To AUSTRALIA<br />
WHICH WE ARE DETERMINED TO MEET. IT IS A CHALLENGE NOT<br />
SIMPLY To AUSTRALIAN RESOURCE INDUSTRIES, BUT To AUSIRALIAN<br />
BUSINESS ACROSS THE BOARD; TO SMALL AND MEDIUM BUSINESS AS<br />
WELL AS TO LARGE CORPORATIONS, AND EXTENDING FROM AGRICULTURE<br />
AND RESOURCES TO INDUSTRY AND SER. VICES.<br />
I INVITE AUSTRALIANS TO ACCEPT THE HISTORIC CHALLENGE TO<br />
WORK WITH CHINA, AND TO INTEGRATE OUR ECONOMY WITH THE DYNAMIC<br />
WESTERN PACIFIC REGION, OF WHICH CHINA AND AUSTRALIA ARE<br />
IMPORTANT PARTS. HERE IN AUSTRALIA THIS MEANS PUTTING INTO<br />
PLACE EFFECTIVE POLICIES FOR GROWTH, STRUCTURAL CHANGE AND<br />
EXPANDED EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES. GREAT PROGRESS HAS<br />
ALREADY BEEN MADE IN THIS DIRECTION. </p>
<p>IKNOW FROM-MY DISCUSSIONS WITH ( OU, GENE RAL-SECRETARY,<br />
AND FROM ALL OUR DEALINGS WITH THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT AND<br />
ITS REPRESENTATIVES, THAT CHINA FOR ITS PART WELCOMES THE<br />
PROSPECT OF SUCH A RELATIONSHIP WITH AUSTRALIA.<br />
IT WILL BE A REAL CHALLENGE FOR US, BECAUSE CHINA IS<br />
MOVING FAST AND WORKING VERY HARD. YOU SET A HIGH STANDARD<br />
OF DILIGENCE.<br />
GENERAL-SECRETARY H-u: A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN US IN THE<br />
ASIA-PACIFIC REGION SHOULD NOT AND WILL NOT BE AN EXCLUSIVE<br />
ARRANGEMENT. WE BOTH SEEK PEACEFUL RELATIONS AND MUTUALLY<br />
BENEFICIAL PARTNERSHIPS WITH OUR NEIGHBOURS.<br />
WE WILL TALK ABOUT INTERNATIONAL AND REGiONAL ISSUES THIS<br />
AFTERNOON. WE AGREE ON VERY MANY MATTERS AND IN AREAS<br />
WHERE THERE IS NOT AN EXACT COINCIDENCE OF VIEWS WE CAN<br />
SEEK TO IDENTIFY LONG TERM OBJECTIVES TOWARDS WHICH WE CAN<br />
WORK CONSTRUCTIVELY.<br />
CHINA'S ADOPTION OF AN INDEPENDENT FOREIGN POLICY HAS MADE<br />
THIS POSSIBLE. WE VALUE OUR RELATIONS WITHi CHINA IN THEIR<br />
OWN RIGHT, AND NOT AS A PART OF SOME STRATEGIC EQUATION.<br />
FOR BOTH OF US IT IS IMPORTANT THAT IN THE END WE HAVE A<br />
WORLD AND A REGION OF PEACE. WE WOULD HOPE THAT THE<br />
INDOCHINESE COUNTRIES, FINDING THEIR OWN INDEPENDENT PLACES<br />
POLITICALLY AND ECONOMICALLY, WOULD BE PART OF THIS REGION<br />
OF PEACE. </p>
<p>6.<br />
I F AUSTRALIA CAN REACH THE OBJECTIVES IT SEEKS IN POLITICAL<br />
AND ECONOMIC RELATIONS WITH CHINA AND WITH OTHER COUNTRIES<br />
IN THE WESTERN PACIFIC BY THE END OF THIS CENTURY, WE MUST<br />
ALL FACE THE FACT THAT OUR ACHIEVEMENTS WILL BE AT RISK IF<br />
, THERE REMAINS IN THE REGION AN ISOLATED COUNTRY AT<br />
LOGGERHEADS WITH OTHERS, AND TIED VIRTUALLY EXCLUSIVELY TO<br />
THE USSR AND ITS ALLIES. As WE MAKE PROGRESS TOWARDS OUR<br />
OWN GOALS, WE MUST SEEK TO MAKE AVAILABLE THE OPTIONS AND<br />
OPPORTUNITIES FOR VIETNAM TO DIVERSIFY ITS RELATIONS AND<br />
ACHIEVE A MORE SATISFACTORY RELATIONSHIP WITH ALL IT NEIGHBOURS.<br />
WITHOUT EXAGGERATING OUR CAPACITY, AUSTRALIA WILL CONTINUE<br />
TO DO WHAT WE CAN TO HELP PROGRESS TOWARDS A RESOLUTION OF<br />
THE CAM3ODIAN PROBLEM. TO THIS END.. WE LOOK FORWARD TO<br />
ML-. NTA1NING OUR DIALOGUE WITH CHINA AND OTHER CONCERNED<br />
COUNTRI1ES. IA." VERY PLEASED THAT FROM AUSTRALIA YOU WILL TRAVEL TO<br />
NEW ZEALAND, WESTERN SAMOA, ' FIJI AND PAPUA NEW GUINEA. FOR<br />
AUSTRALIA THESE COUNTRIES ARE VERY IMPORTANT FRIENDS AND<br />
PARTNERS. WE WELCOME YOUR ! NTEREST IN FURTHER BUILDING<br />
CHINA'S LINKS WITH OUR NEIGHBOURS IN THE PACIFIC.<br />
WE IN THE LABOR PARTY TAKE GREAT PRIDE IN THE HISTORICAL<br />
INITIATIVES TAKEN BY OUR FORMER LEADER, GOUGH WHITLAM, FIRST<br />
IN OPPOSITION AND LATER IN GOVERNMENT,. IN, PIONEERING<br />
AUSTRALIA'S OPENING TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA IN<br />
THE EARLY 1970' s. </p>
<p>WE ALSO RECOGNISE THE POLE PLAYED SUBSEQUENTLY BY THE<br />
LIBERAL/ NATIONAL PARTY COALITION UNDER MALCOLM FRASER IN<br />
DEVELOPING THE RELATIONSHIP WITH YOUR COUNTRY. THE RESULT<br />
IS THAT FRIENDSHIP AND CO-OPERATION WITH CHINA ARE SUPPORTED<br />
' BY THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF AUSTRALIANS AND THIS HAS<br />
BECOME A MAJOR CENTRAL COMMITMENT OF THE FOREIGN POLICIES<br />
OF BOTH MAJOR POLITICAL PARTIES IN THIS COUNTRY.<br />
IOMORROW WE WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS OUR<br />
RESPECTIVE ECONOMIC PROGRAMS AND TO CONSIDER THE BROAD<br />
VISTAS FOR CO-OPERATION BETWEEN AUSTRALIA AND CHINA.<br />
dHINESE-AUSTRALIAN FRIENDSHIP ALONE WILL NOT SECURE RAPID<br />
GROWTH IN ECONOMIC CO-OPERATION. Tw. AT CAN ONLY FLOW FROM<br />
OUR ABILITY TO OFFER EACH OTHER COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES AND<br />
TO WORK OUT ARRANGEMENTS ' WHICH ARE MUTUALLY PROFITABLE,<br />
THE POLITICAL CONSENSUS IN AUSTRALIA IN SUPPORT OF DEVELOPING<br />
RELATIONS WITH CHINA IS STRONGLY MIRRORED AMONG AUSTRALIAN<br />
BUSINESS, RURAL AND UNION INTERESTS.<br />
ON WEDNESDAY, YOU WILL MEET THE MEMBERS OF OUR ECONOMIC<br />
PLANNiNG ADVISORY CnUNCIL REPRESENTING AUSTRALIAN BUSINESS<br />
AND TRADE UNIONS. I AM SURE YOU WILL HAVE A PRODUCTIVE<br />
DIALOGUE WITH THEM ON THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR A PARTNERSHIP<br />
BETWEEN AUSTRALIA AND CHINA THAT WILL BE OF LASTING ECONOMIC<br />
IMPORTANCE TO BOTH OUR NATIONS. </p>
<p>GENERAL-SECRETARY, YOUR VISIT HAS ALREADY TAKEN YOU TO<br />
WESTERN AUSTRALIA AND SOUTH AUSTRALIA, AND ON WEDNESDAY<br />
YOU WILL VISIT NEW SOUTH WALES. THESE STATES INDEED<br />
ALL THE AUSTRALIAN STATES ARE SEEKING TO DEVELOP<br />
EFFECTIVE CO-OPERATION WITH CHINA.<br />
AND WHILE IN SYDNEY, YOU WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO MEET<br />
REPRESENTATIVES OF THE AUSTRALIAN CHINESE COMMUNITY, WHO<br />
HAVE MADE SUCH AN ENORMOUS CONTRIBUTION TO AUSTRALIA, AND<br />
WHO SERVE AS A PERMANENT BRIDGE OF FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN US.<br />
GENERAL-SECRETARY, FOR SOME TIME NOW, AND CERTAINLY SINCE<br />
WE CAME TO GOVERNMENT, I HAVE BEEN DEEPLY CONVINCED THAT<br />
NOTHING MORE IMPORTANT IS HAPPENING IN OUR dORLD THAN THE<br />
QUIET CONSTRUCTIVE REVOLUTION THAT IS OCCURRING IN YOUR<br />
COUNTRY. WITH IMAGINATION AND APPROPRIATE REGARD TO YOUR<br />
OWN PHILOSOPHICAL COMMITMENTS YOU ARE RELEASING THE<br />
INITIATIVE AND ENTERPRISE OF A DYNAMIC PEOPLE CONSTITUTING<br />
ALMOST A QUARTER OF THE EARTH'S POPULATION. IT IS A PROCESS<br />
WHICH HAS PROFOUND IMPLICATIONS FOR GOOD, FOR CHINA, FOR<br />
THE REGION, AND FOR THE REST OF THE WORLD. IT~<br />
l.--l-C </p>
<p>4 9.<br />
ICOUNT IT AS. ONE OF THE GREAT PRIVILEGES OF OFr ICE THAT<br />
IHAVE BEEN GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY BY YOU AND YOUR FELLOW<br />
LEADERS TO PLAY A PART IN ASSOCIATING OUR COUNTRY' MORE<br />
CLOSELY WITH YOU AS YOU PROCEED DOWN THIS PATH. NOTHING<br />
-WILL BE MORE SIGNIFICANT FOR THIS AND FUTURE GENERATIONS<br />
OF AUSTRALIANS THAN THAT WE SHOULD SUCCEED NOW IN<br />
CONSOLIDATING UNBREAKABLE BONDS OF FRIENDSHIP AND MUTUALLY<br />
BENEFICIAL CO-OPERATION BETWEEN OUR TWO GREAT COUNTRIES.<br />
THAT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY, THE CHALLENGE WITH WHICH WE<br />
ARE FACED. THE FACT AND THE SPIRIT OF YOUR VISIT,<br />
GENERAL-SECRETARY, ENTITLE US TO BELIEVE THAT, TOGETHER,<br />
WE SHALL SUCCEED.<br />
MAY 1, YOUR EXCELLENCY, INVITE ALL THOSE PRESENT TO JOINl<br />
ME IN A TOAST:<br />
TO THE HEALTH OF GENERAL-SECRETARY Hu YAOBANGTO<br />
THE HEALTH OF THE OTHER LEADERS OF YOUR PARTY<br />
AND GOVERNMENT AND THEIR DISTINGUISHED<br />
PEPRESENTATIVES HERE TODAY<br />
To WARM FRIENDSHIP AND MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL<br />
CO-OPERATION BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES IN A<br />
STRONG AND LASTING PARTNERSHIP. </p>
