    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to announce that Commonwealth, State and Territory leaders</p>
<p> have today signed a landmark Agreement</p>
<p> that will transform Commonwealth-State financial relations, as promised</p>
<p> in the Commonwealth Government's Tax Reform: not a new tax,</p>
<p> a new tax system.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth has introduced legislation to provide all of the</p>
<p> revenue from the GST to the States and Territories and to protect</p>
<p> the rate and base of the GST in accordance with this Agreement. The</p>
<p> Agreement will commence on 1 July 1999. As a further sign</p>
<p> of the Commonwealth's good faith, the Commonwealth will attach</p>
<p> the signed Intergovernmental Agreement to the A New Tax System</p>
<p> (Commonwealth-State Financial Arrangements) Bill 1999 and similarly</p>
<p> the States and Territories will attach the Agreement to their legislation.</p>
<p>The new arrangements will provide the States and Territories with</p>
<p> a stable and growing source of revenue to fund important community</p>
<p> services. The States have committed to abolish nine inefficient taxes,</p>
<p> removing their reliance on these distortionary and growth-reducing</p>
<p> taxes and charges. The Agreement will also remove the States and Territories'</p>
<p> current reliance on Financial Assistance Grants.</p>
<p>In each of the transitional years following the GST's introduction,</p>
<p> the Commonwealth will compensate any State whose budgetary position</p>
<p> is temporarily worse off. It has also agreed to more generous transitional</p>
<p> arrangements from the third year. As GST revenue increases, all States</p>
<p> will receive large financial gains, even after abolishing stamp duty</p>
<p> on non-residential conveyances.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth has also agreed to provide further assistance to</p>
<p> the States and Territories in relation to the effects on State and</p>
<p> Territory budgets of the abolition of wholesale sales tax equivalent</p>
<p> payments by Government business enterprises and to ensure that local</p>
<p> government benefits fully from the removal of wholesale sales tax</p>
<p> and excises on their purchases. It has also agreed to provide funding</p>
<p> to meet increased public housing costs as a result of tax reform,</p>
<p> subject to the resolution of the new Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement.</p>
<p>A Ministerial Council, chaired by the Commonwealth Treasurer, will</p>
<p> oversee the operation of the Agreement. It will meet at least once</p>
<p> a year. It is also envisaged that the Council of Australian Governments</p>
<p> will meet at least once a year for Heads of Government discussions.</p>
