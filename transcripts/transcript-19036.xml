<p>The Prime Minister will visit Queenstown, New Zealand, from 8 to 10 February for the annual Australia-New Zealand Leaders' Meeting.</p>
<p>Australia's ties with New Zealand are the closest and most comprehensive we have with any country.</p>
<p>Our partnership has been forged through shared values and history, strong people to people links, and close government, security and economic ties.</p>
<p>The visit marks the 30th anniversary of the Australia New Zealand Closer Economic Relations (CER) Trade Agreement, one of the world's most successful and comprehensive free trade agreements and a key driver of trans-Tasman economic integration.</p>
<p>In Queenstown, the Prime Minister will meet New Zealand Prime Minister John Key to discuss opportunities for closer bilateral economic engagement and cooperation on shared regional challenges.</p>
<p>In recognition of our shared Anzac history, and ahead of the 2015 Anzac Centenary, Ms Gillard and Mr Key will lay a wreath at the Queenstown War Memorial Gate. </p>
