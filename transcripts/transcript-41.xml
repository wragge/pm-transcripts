<p>AUSTRALIAN DEFENCE.<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE RIGHT HONORABLE<br />
R. G. MENZIES, TABLED IN THE HOUSE OF<br />
REPRESENTATIVES ON 4th APRIL, 1957.<br />
I present to the House a review of overall Government policy on Australian defence.<br />
Following upon a close examination by the Defence Department, the Chiefs of Staff<br />
and relevant departmcnts, Cabinet has given comprehensive attention, first, to the chances<br />
and nature of hostilities, second, to the strategic basis of Australian defence policy and,<br />
third, to the composition and equipment of the Australian defence forces.<br />
A review of defence policy and of the defence forces is, of course, at any time, a<br />
matter of outstanding importance. But the present review has even greater significance<br />
because it is made against the background of great scientific and technological<br />
developments which have occurred in the recent past. These are of direct relevance to the<br />
consideration of risk, the nature of the forces and the equipment which those forces should<br />
have. This has led to a number of new decisions which set a new pattern for Australian<br />
forces and the most modern standard of equipment.<br />
It is, for obvious reasons, not desirable that the whole of the military appreciations<br />
which have guided our analysis should be made public. But it is possible and desirable<br />
to say certain things.<br />
The first concerns the possibility of war. In earlier days one could speak of war or<br />
of peace without the need to add further words of description. Now it is necessary to speak<br />
of global ( or full scale war); limited war ( or armed conflict short of global war); and<br />
" cold war.<br />
In considering the risks of global war, great weight is attached, not only here<br />
but in major countries abroad, to the deterrent effect of nuclear and thermo-nuclear<br />
weapons. There is, we believe, a clear realization on the part of all the Great Powers<br />
that a major war would be, almost inevitably, a thermo-nuclear one and would, almost<br />
certainly, lead to mutual destruction. Global war is, therefore, we think, unlikely to occur<br />
as the result of deliberate plan~ ning, but it could ' occur as a result of sudden passion or<br />
miscalculation. A limited war is always possible, as we have seen in the Middle East and Indo-<br />
China, and such a war could break out with little or no warning. It may, in fact, be<br />
that the powerful persuasions which exist not to engage in global war may tend in the<br />
minds of the Communist Powers to increase the temptation to engage in limited wars,<br />
A limited war, of course, might grow into a global war, but this would depend on<br />
circumstances, none of which can be calculated in advance.<br />
On the whole, we believe that the Communist Powers, notably the Soviet Union<br />
and China, will continue to seize every opportunity to attain their aims by means of the<br />
cold war; that is, by infiltration, internal subversion and the propagation of revolutionary<br />
ideas, terrorism and other forms of lawlessness, sabotage and economic destruction. These<br />
are the methods by which the Communists pursue their objectives of extending the<br />
boundaries of communism and narrowing the boundaries of freedom.<br />
But here again, the line between cold war and a limited war is one all too<br />
easily crossed by those who have aggressive intentions.<br />
I say these things because we have reason to fear that when it is said that the<br />
common judgment is that the fear of global war is reduced there may be many people<br />
who are tempted to believe that we can forget about war altogether. This is, unhappily,<br />
not true. in a global war, Australia's role would, having regard to our population, be<br />
significant but relatively subsidiary. Our chief task would be to co-operate with our Allies<br />
and to take our share on a basis consistent with our interest, our resources, and our sense<br />
of responsibility. If a limited war broke out in South-East Asia and did not at once develop into<br />
a global war, it would, in all probability affect those countries in South-East Asia whose<br />
safety and independence are significant and perhaps vital for us. For example, any<br />
recrudescence of Communist aggression in South Viet Nam, in Laos or Cambodia, in<br />
Thailand or Malaya, would at once affect the safety and defence of Australia. </p>
<p>It is of immense importance to us that the free countries of South-East Asia should<br />
not fall one by one to Communist aggression. Security in the area must, therefore, be a<br />
collective concept. We believe that participation in regional arrangements for collective<br />
defence is the most effective method of securing the safety of Australia and the other<br />
countries who are parties to these arrangements. Such participation also provides the best<br />
means of co-ordinating our defence policy and planning with that of our Allies. We cannot<br />
stand alone; and therefore we stand in good company in SEATO, in ANZUS, and in<br />
ANZAM. The association of the massive power of the United States with the regional<br />
arrangements I have referred to, and her assurances of support in the event of Communist<br />
aggression, are vital factors in maintaining security in this part of the world. United<br />
Kingdom forces, though substantial, are necessarily smaller than the United States forces in<br />
this region. Despite the re-organization of her forces which is now in hand, the United<br />
Kingdom will continue to maintain substantial and flexible striking power in this region.<br />
At present SEATO is very important for the defence of South-East Asia. It has<br />
already achieved significant progress, as was demonstrated during the recent conference<br />
at Canberra. Putting aside for the present purpose the economic and political associations<br />
which are involved in the Treaty, it is good to know that on the military side much planning<br />
has been done, the stage having been reached when it has become necessary to set up a<br />
permanent military planning office at Bangkok, the head-quarters of the SEATO<br />
organization. The ability of the armed forces of the SEATO nations to work together has<br />
been developed in a number of combined exercises, and contact between military advisers<br />
has been provided by means of annual schedulcs of combined training exercises. In addition<br />
to all this, our own defence co-operation continues effectively with the United Kingdom<br />
and New Zealand, and with the United States in the ANZUS Treaty.<br />
I remind the House of these matters because I want to give emphasis to the belief<br />
of the Government and, I am sure, of the Australian people that we would not, except at<br />
our peril think of the defence of Australia as a purely local matter, confined<br />
within the Australian coastline. For if our coastline became the subject of<br />
invasion it could only be because our great friends had already been defeated.<br />
Even in what is called a limited war therefore, and in the less obvious aspects of the<br />
" 1cold war, it is an essential ingredient in Australian defence that we make and keep<br />
ourselves ready to co-operate with our allies. We cannot expect the defensive assistance<br />
of the great democratic powers unless we are ourselves prepared to take a proper part in<br />
the common defence. There is nothing new about this conception. Australia has<br />
demonstrated acceptance of it in two world wars already.<br />
It may be thought by some that, with the advent of nuclear and thermo-nuclear<br />
weapons, conventional arms are becoming irrelevant. This is by no means true. The fact<br />
is, that nuclear potential is available so far anyway only to United States, the United<br />
Kingdom and Russia. How far nuclear weapons would be used by these countries either<br />
in attack or in defence in a limited war we cannot foresee. At any rate, for all other nations<br />
there will continue to be a requirement for conventional arms.<br />
Accordingly our present planning and preparations are proceeding on the basis of<br />
an operational contribution to allied strategy of highly trained men armed with the most<br />
modern conventional weapons and equipment. The emphasis is not any longer, so much<br />
on numbers as on mobility, equipment and fire power. This is not to say that man power<br />
is unimportant. It will still be necessary in the event of a great war to commit large forces<br />
to the struggle but in the upshot speed and the capacity to hit will determine victory.<br />
It is obvious that defence policy and economic policy must run together. This at<br />
once brings up special considerations. In Australia the vast programme of national<br />
development and industrial expansion and migration currently puts rather more strain on<br />
national resources than it does in many other countries. To a large extent the Government<br />
has had to finance this development from revenue because loan raisings have fallen short<br />
of the total funds needed. These things are not without impact on the amount of the<br />
resources which we can devote to defence. But the Government has concluded that for the<br />
year 1957-5 8 the broad figure of the cost of the defence programme should be of the same<br />
order as that provided for defence during the present financial year, that is Å_ 190,000,000.<br />
This is a large sum but modern weapons are extremely costly and it would be useless<br />
to raise fighting forces without giving them the most modern weapons with which to fight.<br />
Large capital expenditures are necessary. Re:; earch and development programmes which<br />
include the highly technical and highly skilled work which is being done in the field of<br />
testing at Woomera in conjunction with the United Kingdom are costly. However, the<br />
Government believes that the people of Australia will accept the fact that our national<br />
defences must be maintained at an adequate level to enable us to play our proper part in<br />
the mutual security arrangements to which we adhere and, therefore, in our own defence. </p>
<p>This brings me to the question of the composition of our forces. Before I proceed<br />
to describe our plans on this matter, I should make three points:<br />
First, uinder both SEATO and ANZUS, it seems clear that in the event of war<br />
we will be fighting side by side with the United States. Particularly in the<br />
event of a global war, it would be manifestly difficult for the United<br />
Kingdom to maintain a line of supply to South-East Asia, though the United<br />
States undoubtedly could. Common sense dictates that under these<br />
circumstances, we should pay considerable attention to the logistic aspect<br />
of war, and standardise so far as we can with the Americans. Though this<br />
is a wholeheartedly British nation this is not a heresy. It merely recognizes<br />
the facts of wvar. It is based upon exactly the same reasoning as that upon<br />
which, I am sure, the United States would wish to see Great Britain, France,<br />
Germany and the other European NATO countries standardizing as among<br />
themselves their own weapons and techniques so as to eliminate the necessity<br />
for excessive stocks of spare parts or precarious technical reinforcements<br />
over the waters of the Atlantic.<br />
It is for this reason that, as I will point out, we have decided both<br />
in aircraft, in artillery, and in small arms, to fit ourselves for close<br />
co-operation with the United States in the South-East Asian area.<br />
Second, we have for some time been greatly disturbed by the fact that an undue<br />
proportion of our annual expenditure has been laid out upon the maintenance<br />
of existing forces, the bulk of whom are only partially trained, while too<br />
small a proportion of our expenditure has been available for equipment. We<br />
hlave, quite frankly, disturbing deficiencies on the equipment side. Such,<br />
however, have been the immense social advantages of National Service<br />
Training that we have been reluctant to modify that great scheme. I say<br />
" 1modify because we have never thought of abandoning it! In addition<br />
to this. we have encountered some inevitable delays in getting into production<br />
of the FN Rifle and its related amimunition, while on the aircraft side,<br />
technical advances have been made so rapidly that it has been difficult to<br />
determine within any feasible financial limit how our re-equipment should<br />
proceed. This problem is not pe-culiar to Australia. It has been vexing the<br />
United Kingdom authorities for a long time. We have now concluded that<br />
we should reduce the proportion of our Defence Vote which goes to manpower<br />
and increase the proportion which goes to modern equipment.<br />
Third, this problem is not solely a problem of money. A considerable<br />
proportion of our regular forces has been exclusively devoted to the basic<br />
training of the C. M. F. and of National Service trainees. This fact, while it<br />
has enabled us to give basic training to something like 180,000 men, has<br />
inevitably reduced the number of regular troops available for immediate use<br />
in the event of war. I will not need to tell honorable members that it needs<br />
more than a Government decision to expand the regular army. In these<br />
days of high competing wages and full employment, the number of recruits<br />
for the regular forces is limited. We certainly cannot afford to make an<br />
inadequate use of them.<br />
Having made these observations, I pass to the important question of the composition<br />
of the forces we think it prope: to mvintain to meet the possible threats. We cannot prepare<br />
for every eventuality, but a judicious balance of highly trained regular forces possessing<br />
mobility and power, and adeq': ate reserve forces capable of rapid expansion in time of<br />
emergency, can aid must ensure that we can meet our regional and local defence tasks.<br />
I will, quite briefiy, take the three Services in turn.<br />
The Navy: Our review has shown that the present structure and organization of our naval forces<br />
is sound having regard to their strategic role, and no major changes are proposed.<br />
The function of the Navy in war will be to ensure the defence of sea<br />
communications, to act in a convoy where necessary for military forces, and to co-operate<br />
al rng lines alrecady worked out with our Allies in general operations. We have for some<br />
time been conducting a programme of naval construction and alteration designed to produce<br />
craft of the appropriate kind. This programmle is being accelerated. The Fleet Air Arm<br />
will continue to consist, operationally, of one aircraft carrier, one naval air station and a<br />
front line establishment of 40 aircraft in five squadrons but because of the availability of<br />
a second carrier " Sydney which has been used during recent years as a<br />
non-flying training ship, and of Sea Fury aircraft, it has been decided that this second </p>
<p>carrier should be restored to a flying training role. This will permit aircraft now operating<br />
from the Naval Air Station at Nowra to be embarked from time to time. Naval construction<br />
will, as I have said, be speeded up to correct the present shortage of ships of the<br />
appropriate kind, and as a means of reducing overhead costs.<br />
The strength of the Permanent Naval Forces will be maintained at an average figure<br />
of about 11,000 for the next three years.<br />
The Army: I have already explained that we are seeking in particular mobile well-equipped and<br />
readily available regular forces. Moves have already begun to organize a Brigade Group<br />
of over 4,000 as a cohesive battle formation trained to the highest pitch. This force will<br />
be equipped with the most modern weapons available. Special attention will be paid to<br />
mobility and the requirements of tropical warfare. The force will be additional to the<br />
infantry battalion group who will continue to serve in the Commonwealth Strategic Reserve<br />
in Malaya, which has a great part to play in the Cold War.<br />
It may be appropriate to explain our proposals in relation to National Service<br />
Training. This scheme has given great benefits to our country in instilling ideals of personal<br />
discipline, loyalty and service. We introduced it, and we are very proud of its results.<br />
Largely as a result of its introduction, we have to-day a total'of over 180,000 men who have<br />
received basic training. But we are no longer able to count defence potential in terms<br />
of numbers of partly trained men. We have been forced to consider whether devotion of<br />
the same effort to the initial training of national servicemen would cost, in time, money, and<br />
manpower, a disproportionate amount as compared with what should be expended on<br />
quickly available defence forces.<br />
We have, therefore, decided most reluctantly to reduce the size of the national service<br />
intake. The Navy and the Air Force are both services which require the continuous<br />
engagement of men for service at home or abroad. They have not been able to secure<br />
much advantage as military organizations from national service training. We have, therefore,<br />
decided that in the case of the Navy and the Air Force, national service training will end.<br />
In the case of the Army, the call-up will be on a selective basis, which will<br />
be subsequently announced, and will amount to 12,000 trainees annually. We do not<br />
propose any change in the present system of universal registration. All young men on<br />
reaching eighteen years of age will continue to have an obligation to register. The universal<br />
liability to serve remains, but the call-up will be limited to 12,000 each year. Selection<br />
will be made by ballot. This will not affect the present geographic and other types of<br />
deferment including the deferment of rural workers as at present. The new scheme will<br />
commence with the second call-up for this year which will begin in July. The total period<br />
of training will remain at 140 days, but in future this will be served in an initial period of<br />
77 days continuous training, followed by three years in the Citizen Military Forces for an<br />
equivalent of 21 days' training each year. After completing their training, national service<br />
trainees will remain on the reserve for the balance of five years from the date of call-up as<br />
at present. This announcement will, understandably, produce disappointment in many minds.<br />
I should, therefore, point out that the physical savings of employment of a good deal of<br />
regular army man-power in the reduced training scheme will contribute substantially to<br />
the build-up of the Mobile Brigade Group, while the reduced expenditure on maintenance<br />
will permit some most important increased expenditure on the re-equipment of our fighting<br />
forces. Approximately 2,000 regular soldiers will be freed for active duty in this way.<br />
National Service Training will, of course, not cease. It will continue, within its<br />
numerical limits, to provide a reservoir on which the Citizen Military Forces can draw.<br />
The C. M. F. itself is, of course, vital to the rapid expansion of our forces in time of<br />
emergency. This whole concept of rebalancing the forces in favour of effectiveness and<br />
equipment is, of course, in line with the trend in modern defence provision overseas, and<br />
reflects both the increased fire power of the new weapons and their greater complexity and<br />
cost. In our consideration of the Army, we have, in accordance with the principles I<br />
have already described, decided to provide modern equipment standardized or compatible<br />
with that used by the United States. Our re-equipment plans can involve expenditure of<br />
nearly Å-40,000,000 over the next three years. These plans include provision of the new<br />
F. N. rifle and its related ammunition and the U. S. 105mm. field artillery equipment.<br />
The F. N. rifle, because of its ease of operation and rate of fire, will greatly increase the </p>
<p>effectiveness of the infantryman, while the fact that it uses the small arms ammunition<br />
round which is already in use by the armies of the United Kingdom and the United States<br />
of America, wvill contribute considerably to flexibility of supply. The 105mm.-equipment<br />
has trajectory characteristics enabling it to operate effectively in wooded and hilly country<br />
and is, therefore, most appropriate to the difficult areas in which it is likely to operate.<br />
In brief, it combines the virtues of the Howitzer and the<br />
Overall total regular army strength will be maintained at about 21,000.<br />
Air Force: The Air Force should include fighter aircraft of the most modem kind to ensure<br />
local air superiority and to deal with any raiding bomber. It must have transport aircraft<br />
of the highest quality also. The cost of modern aircraft is extraordinary and re-equipment<br />
will therefore prove a very considerable burden.<br />
We already have a substantial Air Force, including light bombers, fighters and<br />
modern maritime reconnaissance aircraft. We are planning to re-arm with fighter aircraft<br />
of a performance equivalent to the Lockheed F104, which has been accepted by the<br />
United States Air Force, and with transport aircraft of the type of the C. 130, which is<br />
already in operational service with the United States Air Force.<br />
It may be thought by many honorable members, as it was thought by me when<br />
the proposals first came forward, that it is unfortunate that we should adopt a re-equipment<br />
plan wvhich appears to produce some divergence from the United Kingdom. But it seems<br />
to us clear that, having regard to ANZUS and SEATO and to our geographical situation,<br />
Australian participation in any future war must be in close association with the forces of<br />
the United States of America.<br />
The Air is the most mobile of all arms. It is, therefore, in the air that we<br />
have felt it desirable to standardize on types of aircraft which would enable the Royal<br />
Australian Air Force to co-operate with American Air Forces, with common lines of<br />
supply. We have, of course, thanks to Australian ingenuity and industry, a powerful<br />
provision of Avon Sabres, still in the first rank of fighters, and the celebrated Canberra<br />
bomber. We are developing a powerfully equipped and efficient air force. The strength of<br />
the regular Air Force will build up from its present level of 15,000 to 16,725 by June,<br />
1960. Two other important new projects in Air Force preparedness will be the<br />
introduction of the first ground to air guided weapons unit and the setting-up of mobile<br />
control and reporting units at Darwin and Perth. It will be understood that, as modem<br />
aircraft operate at greater speeds and altitudes, electronic control and reporting have<br />
become more difficult and complicated. The guided weapons unit will be located in the<br />
Sydney defence area and will, therefore, be used for air defence training in a place where<br />
a modem control and reporting unit has already been established.<br />
Defence Production:<br />
This year will see the completion ' on schedule of the much-abused but little<br />
understood St. Mary's filling factory. This plant has been erected on the advice of our<br />
military experts that it is of the highest order of priority. It will be essential for the<br />
filling of bombs, shells, and other projectiles. Without it the country would be grievously<br />
handicapped in the event of war.<br />
The Small Arms Factory at Lithgow will shortly commence the production of the<br />
F. N. rifle. Production of the Jindivik pilotless aircraft in Australia is continuing. Deliveries<br />
have already commenced against orders placed by Sweden, and inquiries have been<br />
received from other overseas countries.<br />
Research and Development:<br />
I have already mentioned Woomera. Our co-operation with the United Kingdom<br />
in the Long Range Weapons Establishment has been both dramatic and productive. We<br />
know how much importance the United Kingdom attaches to this venture. Our effort in<br />
relation to it will be maintained vigorously at about the existing level for at least some<br />
years to come.<br />
Indeed, I should point out that what has been done at Woomera and Maralinga<br />
contributes to the development of the nuclear deterrent and, therefore, relates to something<br />
which has the highest priority in the global strategy of the Western Powers. </p>
<p>I wish to refer, before I conclude, to the matter of Defence Administration. The<br />
head-quarters of the Defence Department itself, and of all the other departments in the<br />
Defence group, are in Melbourne. The Chiefs of Staff of the three Services have their<br />
head-quarters in Melbourne. This separation between the centre of Government in<br />
Canberra and these important, and indeed vital, branches in Melbourne has created<br />
difficulties. We believe that, for complete efficiency, the head-quarters of the Cabinet, of<br />
the Prime Minister's Department, of the Treasury, of the Department of External Affairs<br />
and of Defence should all be within immediate reach of each other in thle Federal Capital.<br />
Defence policy is inseparable from other aspects of Government policy and, in particular,<br />
foreign and financial and economic policy. The Government has, therefore, decided that<br />
it should take steps to repeal the separation and to improve the swift co-ordination of<br />
policy and action. To this end, we are initiating a movement to Canberra of those<br />
elements in defence which deal with policy.<br />
The Minister for Defence and the Minister for the Interior are in consultation about<br />
the details of the transfer. The Government will provide the additional money for the<br />
necessary development of housing and other elements in Canberra. The first part of the<br />
move will be accomplished in two sections. At the beginning of 1959, some 500 officers<br />
from the Department of Defence and from the Departments of the Navy, Army and Air,<br />
who are associated with the operation of the Defence Committee, the Chiefs of Staff<br />
Committee and others will move. Later in that year, another 600 persons from the Service<br />
Departments will move so that the Service Boards will meet in Canberra. Office<br />
accommodation will be available for all these people in the new permanent secretariat,<br />
while the provision of housing is being actively dealt with. The date of later moves has<br />
not been fixed but there will be no undue delay. I have no doubt that the result of this<br />
transfer will be to add enormously to the efficiency of our defence and to the co-ordination<br />
of national policies.<br />
We have also made some important changes in the higher defence organization.<br />
The Defence Committee, which to-day comprises the Secretary of the Defence Department<br />
and the three Chiefs of Staff, is being made a more comprehensive body by the addition of<br />
the Secretaries of the Prime Minister's Department, and the Departments of the Treasury<br />
and of External Affairs. The present practice of co-opting representatives of other<br />
interested departments and specialized advisers from time to time will be continued. The<br />
Chiefs of Staff Committee, consisting of the three Chiefs of Staff, will meet regularly on<br />
purely military matters so that there may be no restraint placed on the expression of<br />
professional military views. In addition to this, of course, the Chiefs of Staff will continue<br />
to attend at Cabinet and Cabinet Committee meetings dealing with defence and will be<br />
in regular consultation not only with their own Service Ministers but with the Minister<br />
for Defence who has an overall responsibility for defence policy.<br />
May I conclude with some brief but general observations.<br />
In 1950, I brought down in this House the first Defence Programme of my<br />
Government. The facts of Communist expansion in Europe prior to 1950 imposed an<br />
obligation on all Australians to heed the war~ nings of these events, and subsequently I<br />
sought a mandate to strengthen our defence system. The continuance of the greatly<br />
enlarged programmes then instituted has been justified by subsequent world events.<br />
Prior to the death of Stalin in 1953, Communist expansion had been characterized<br />
by dramatic coups which came to be accepted as a regular occurrence. Honorable<br />
members will recall that those countries which were unfortunate enough to be occupied by<br />
the Soviet Union were taken urider control. Expansion and re-armament on the part of<br />
the Communist Powers proceeded in the face of extensive disarmament by the West.<br />
When Germany surrendered after the last war, American armed strength in Europe<br />
amounted to 3,000,000 men. Within one year after the end of the war this enormous<br />
force was diminished to 390,000. The United Kingdom strength in Europe at the armistice<br />
was 1,300,000. It fell to 488,000 in one year. The Soviet Union, on the other hand,<br />
kept in active service some 3,000,000 men.<br />
The rapid reduction of armaments by the Western Powers was an act of good faith<br />
which the Soviet Union chose to disregard. The free world had no alternative, in the face<br />
of this accumulated Communist power, to getting together in a common defence. In 1949,<br />
N. A. T. O. came into being.<br />
But international communism continued to find outlets for its dreams of expansion.<br />
In 1950, the Communists instigated an invasion of South Korea by North Korea, and once<br />
again the shadow of war fell across the world. This event was for us one of prime<br />
significance. International communism was for the first time engaging in overt aggression<br />
in Asia. The challenge was promptly taken up and, in response to that challenge,<br />
Australian forces of all arms operated in Korea. The Soviet Union found itself blocked<br />
in its efforts to crush Europe by force and therefore decided upon new tactics in their<br />
vision of world conquests. </p>
<p>If only they could expunge from memory the suppression of the Baltic States, the<br />
coups in Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Korea; if only all these things which<br />
seemed to condemn communism in the eyes of the world could be made to fade in human<br />
memory, then the way would be open for renewed efforts at expansion.<br />
The central idea of the new policy was to create an air of innocence around Soviet<br />
diplomacy in order to disguise the Communist subversions which were designed to ensure<br />
Communist success. In February of last year, Mr. Kruschev, the Communist leader, tried<br />
to dissociate communism from the personality of Stalin and from the odium attaching to<br />
his post-war works. He made a notable speech. It was published. The point about it<br />
was that the speaker made no attempt to criticize the immoral side of Stalin's behaviour<br />
internationally. It was rather a speech of a man seeking world power and condemning his<br />
predecessor. At first the world was startled, but perhaps relieved, by these revelations,<br />
and hopes ran high that the " cold" war would be called off. The new tactics looked<br />
like being successful. Indeed, world commentary on Soviet affairs seemed to be dominated<br />
by those who wishfully thought that the Communists had mended their ways. At home<br />
and in the satellite countries, the Russian leaders made some small adjustments towards<br />
their dependents. These were enough to give some of the people who had known freedom<br />
a taste of freedom again. For example, the Hungarian people set up a Government which<br />
was free from the Secret Police terrorism which is the normal sign of Communist<br />
Government. What happened? The free regime lasted for a few days and was crushed<br />
by Russian tanks. But the memory of Hungary in the free world is still alive, and more<br />
alive than ever having regard to recent horrors. It speaks more clearly than all the<br />
hypocritical protestations of the apologists of international communism.<br />
Other things happened. From our point of view they happened with particular<br />
eloquence in South-East Asia.<br />
The Communists were busy provoking mischief where they thought mischief could<br />
do most good to their own cause. In the Middle East, the Communists promoted mischief<br />
when they thought it could do most damage to the economic ties of the Middle East and<br />
European countries. I will not dwell on this matter. I may have an opportunity of<br />
speaking about it before the debate on foreign affairs concludes.<br />
But while the events in the Middle East have captured the attention of the world,<br />
we cannot forget that in South-East Asia, communism has intensified its programme of<br />
subversion. The cold war has taken a savage toll of the lives and cultures of the people in<br />
South-East Asia. For example, in a period when the Federation of Malaya has been<br />
working hard, with active British co-operation, to mobilize its resources for nationhood,<br />
Communist terrorists have waged a wicked campaign to destroy the very basis of the<br />
social life of the Malayan people. We are proud to think that troops from Australia have<br />
been helping the people of Malaya to defend themselves against this menace. Malaya is<br />
not, of course, a single example. There are other free nations who are struggling to<br />
maintain the free institutions necessary for the survival of their ancient traditions and the<br />
achievement of a modern independence. Those who try to excuse Communist terrorism<br />
in South-East Asia by suggesting that it represents a stand against colonialism ignore the<br />
fact that there are only two colonies on the South-East Asian mainland-Malaya and<br />
Singapore. In both of these States, the Governments have been elected by popular vote<br />
and are, with the active assistance of many independent nations, including our own,<br />
drawing up constitutions which will ensure eventual independence.<br />
The aggressive Communist attitude and the slogans about " colonialism" also<br />
ignore the situation in free Burma where, since independence, the Communists have been<br />
waging a ceaseless campaign in arms against the Government. They are undismayed by<br />
the fact that the leader of the Burmese nation is distinguished internationally for the<br />
honesty and courage of his approach to the problems of world peace.<br />
In view of these Communist intentions and the subtlety of the machinations and<br />
dangers which inhere in their immoral approach to international relations, the defence<br />
programme is for us of paramount importance. Let us remember that communism is still<br />
advancing in spite of the fact that it has had setbacks which may and will, as we hope,<br />
finally prove disastrous. We have no cause to slacken our efforts to defend ourselves in<br />
co-operation with our neighbours and our friends.<br />
