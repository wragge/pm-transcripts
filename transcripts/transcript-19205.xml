<p>I learned this evening in Beijing of the death of Baroness Thatcher.</p>
<p>Her service as the first female Prime Minister of the United Kingdom was a history making achievement.</p>
<p>Her strength of conviction was recognised by her closest supporters and her strongest opponents.</p>
<p>I extend my sincere condolences and those of my fellow Australians to her family and friends.</p>
