DOUBLE DISSOLUTION<br />
The Governor General has agreed to a double dissolution of<br />
the Parliament, and a general election will be held on<br />
March, 1983.<br />
This week we have seen clear evidence of a concerted attempt<br />
by the trade union movement, with the full support of the<br />
Australian Labor Party, to break t: he wages pause and wreck<br />
the hopes of Australia's workers for job security. This<br />
attempt to break the wage pause ignores the fact that excessive<br />
wage increases have been a major cause of our econcmic<br />
difficulties, particularly unemployment, and the wage pause<br />
is a key policy to renedy this.<br />
This selfish and greedy action is taken at the expense of all<br />
the young Australians wanting jobs. It ignores the importance<br />
of doing everything possible to save jobs. It cannot be<br />
tolerated. Right-around Australia there has been a national consensus<br />
behind the wages pause a consensus broken only by the<br />
divisive and destructive actions of the union leadership and<br />
the Federal Labor Party. The pause was put in place with the<br />
agreement of the seven State Governments as well as the<br />
Corrmnonwealth, it has been endorsed by the Arbitration Coimnission<br />
and other wage tribunals, and it has the backing of the great<br />
majority of the Australian people. The attitudes and actions<br />
of the union leadership and the Labor Party can only breed<br />
uncertainty and insecurity at a time when firmh policies and<br />
a clear sense of direction are more important than ever.<br />
It is the wages pause which makes possible the direct<br />
expenditure of $ 300m., saved from Commonwealth wages, on<br />
the constructive job-creating projects which have recently<br />
been announced. These projects, together with the programme<br />
of major national projects recently adopted by the Goverrnment,<br />
will encourage private enterprise to provide jobs, and to<br />
show the potential this country has. </p>
<p>Because of the Government's policies Australia was one of the<br />
last countries to be hit by the world recession. The<br />
Government's programme, set out in the family budget, in<br />
the wages pause, in the national and bicentennial projects<br />
and in assistance to industry, will. help Australia to be one<br />
of the first countries out of the recession. We don't need<br />
to sit back and wait for the rest of the world. There are<br />
many things we can do to help ourselves, and we cannot afford<br />
to be prevented from doing these things.<br />
Because of the attitude of the unions, because of the attitude<br />
of the Labor Party, because of the importance of carrying<br />
through the wage pause and the other Government policies ; hich<br />
will help Australia to move onto an upward path, it is<br />
imperative that an election be held at this time.<br />
I do not want Australia to be racked by enormous industrial<br />
strife. If the union movement and the ACTU cannot accept a<br />
decision backed by all eight governments, Labor as well as<br />
Liberal and National Party; if they cannot accept the<br />
decision of the Arbitration Commission; if they cannot<br />
accept the decisions of wage tribunals right around<br />
Australia; then let us ask them one very simple question.<br />
Will they accept the verdict of all the people of Australia?<br />
Because if they will not, they are challenging the very<br />
foundation of Australian democracy.<br />
And if that is the case it will be a good thing for the<br />
Australian people to know just where they stand.<br />
I therefore call upon the Trade Union Movement to withdraw<br />
all bans, to end all strikes, and to accept the verdict of<br />
the Australian people. I'm prepared to accept their<br />
verdict. I challenge the union movement to accept their<br />
verdict also.<br />
The choice before people in this election is whether they<br />
want security based on continuity and the stable policies<br />
which the Government has in place, or whether they want the<br />
total uncertainty and subservience to union pressures which<br />
is all that the Labor Party can offer.<br />
I had previously arranged to travel to the United States at<br />
this time for official discussion with President Reagan in<br />
advance of the Williamsburg economic summit. But events in<br />
Australia obviously take total priority.<br />
The basis for the double dissolution is the rejection on two<br />
occasions by the Senate of 13 bills relating to sales tax,<br />
tertiary fees and unemployment benefit payments to the spouses<br />
of strikers. The technical qrounds are only one aspect of the<br />
reasons T have sought a double dissolution.<br />
I ask for full support to continue the work of building Australia.<br />
We need a continuation of the wage pause not just for six<br />
months but for a full twelve months. We need a continuation<br />
of stable policies. Ve need a continuation oC the longer term<br />
prora7dmhs ,. iich i secure Aus tra ia's future. </p>
