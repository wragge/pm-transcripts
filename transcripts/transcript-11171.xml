<p>MILLER:</p>
<p>Prime Minister good morning.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good morning John.</p>
<p>MILLER:</p>
<p>Prime Minister now that the dust has settled after the, well you've</p>
<p> got to say, historical deal broken with the Democrats on Friday, do</p>
<p> you remain confident that your tax package is substantially still</p>
<p> intact?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh absolutely, we have got 85 to 90 per cent of what we took to the</p>
<p> people. We've preserved in full the tax cuts for people under $50,000</p>
<p> a year, that means 80 per cent of Australian tax payers will be on</p>
<p> a top marginal rate of no more than 30 cents in the dollar. It means</p>
<p> that you can pass from $20,000 of income to $50,000 of income without</p>
<p> going into a higher taxation bracket. We have preserved the agreement</p>
<p> with the States whereby after the transitional period the States will</p>
<p> have access to a growth tax and will be better off than they would</p>
<p> have been if the existing arrangement were to continue and we are</p>
<p> going to get rid of a raft of indirect taxes not as many as we initially</p>
<p> planned but the wholesales tax will go, financial institutions duty</p>
<p> will go six months later and the stamp duty on share transactions</p>
<p> will also go so overall it's a splendid outcome, one that I think</p>
<p> the Australian people will very warmly welcome.</p>
<p>MILLER:</p>
<p>On the subject of the fact that 80 per cent of Australians will be</p>
<p> on that much, much lower tax scale. The big question that's being</p>
<p> put to me this morning, is will those tax scales be indexed so that</p>
<p> we don't have the situation with that phrase I love bracket creep</p>
<p> that these people who currently will be eligible for the much lower</p>
<p> tax scales won't at the end of the day in five or six years wind up</p>
<p> back on the treadmill.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well John, the answer is that indexation is not included in the agreement</p>
<p> but it must immediately be said that if you have the same rate between</p>
<p> 20,000 and 50,000 you don't need indexation because bracket creep</p>
<p> only occurs if you've got brackets to creep into and if you have no</p>
<p> new brackets between 20,000 and 50,000 your income can creep as much</p>
<p> as it likes in between those two ranges, those two points and not</p>
<p> pass into a higher tax bracket. So that's the whole virtue of this.</p>
<p>MILLER:</p>
<p>Well surely that's well and good for people who are starting at the</p>
<p> bottom end of the scale, what about say if I'm earning that $45,000</p>
<p> a year and a few years time....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, in a few years time who knows what other changes in a few years</p>
<p> time might be capable of being made. I mean one thing at a time. You're</p>
<p> talking about a situation in five or six years time. I'm talking about</p>
<p> a situation over the next 12 months and in the years immediately following</p>
<p> that. Now obviously you don't make a once only for all time adjustment</p>
<p> to tax scales you keep them under review. I'm not making any promises,</p>
<p> let me make that plain, but clearly the point you make will be kept</p>
<p> very much in mind by the Government as time goes by. But nothing can</p>
<p> alter the fact that we will have a revolutionary more incentive driven</p>
<p> tax system as a result of these changes that 80 per cent of people</p>
<p> will be on a top marginal rate of 30 cents in the dollar. Now that</p>
<p> is real incentive to middle Australia. There's been some paring back</p>
<p> of the cuts for higher income earners but somebody on $75,000 a year</p>
<p> will still get a tax cut of $62.00 a week so they can hardly say that</p>
<p> they're still not a great deal better off but the real value, the</p>
<p> really spectacular change occurs in the middle.</p>
<p>MILLER:</p>
<p>Alright let's look at those wholesale sales tax, you say that they're</p>
<p> all still to go?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>They are all going lock stock and barrel on the 1st of</p>
<p> July next year.</p>
<p>MILLER:</p>
<p>So when we go to the supermarket in July next year, August next year,</p>
<p> we should see substantial price reductions in some items.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>In some items they'll come down a lot. Other items will rise a bit</p>
<p> not as many of them as a result of the excision of food.</p>
<p>MILLER:</p>
<p>Alright let's look at the comments made by for example Terry McCran</p>
<p> in the Weekend Australian. He described it as a betrayal of a significant</p>
<p> slice of middle Australia, those rich people taking home between 680</p>
<p> and around $1,000 a week in wages. Now that is a substantial number</p>
<p> of people nowadays.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>But I don't know how something's a betrayal if you still get a tax</p>
<p> cut. I just don't know. I read that article and I have a lot of respect</p>
<p> for Terry McCran but on this I think he's off the pace. Those people</p>
<p> are still getting a tax cut but I don't understand what Terry's getting</p>
<p> at. I don't accept there's been any betrayal. How can something be</p>
<p> a betrayal if you preserve in full the tax cuts for everybody up to</p>
<p> $50,000, beyond 50,000 you still get an additional tax cut but it's</p>
<p> not as generous as previously committed and you're taking out food,</p>
<p> how can that be a betrayal? I just don't understand that language.</p>
<p>MILLER:</p>
<p>The front page of the Courier Mail, also Prime Minister, there's a</p>
<p> young couple there, they are both upwardly mobile, professional people,</p>
<p> they're on good comfortable wages.........</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>What incomes? I haven't seen the Courier, what incomes?</p>
<p>MILLER:</p>
<p>Well just off the top of my head I think they're around, they're talking</p>
<p> around the 60 - $70,000 mark.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>What each, each.</p>
<p>MILLER:</p>
<p>Well certainly with the father. Let's take him as an example.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well he would get, have they got any children?</p>
<p>MILLER:</p>
<p>Yes they have two children.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well if the family income, now I don't know I haven't seen the paper,</p>
<p> but if the family income is below $70,000 and they've got a couple</p>
<p> of kids they do very well.</p>
<p>MILLER:</p>
<p>Well this chap is quoted in the paper as saying that he doesn't think</p>
<p> on his analysis of the situation that they will be doing well, that</p>
<p> their tax cuts will be minimal and that the end of the day they're</p>
<p> not going to be any better off..........</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well if his income is in the order of $70,000 a year and he has children</p>
<p> his tax cuts will not be minimal. They'll be very substantial.</p>
<p>MILLER:</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>They will be very substantial but I am talking blind because I haven't</p>
<p> seen the paper.</p>
<p>MILLER:</p>
<p>I understand that, I understand that. Look we'll leave that aside</p>
<p> for the moment, just going back as I said quickly to that essential</p>
<p> issue of as well as the tax benefits, is it a fact that we are going</p>
<p> to be able to police the passing on of this GST, sorry the abolition</p>
<p> of the wholesale sales tax and the implementation of the GST so that</p>
<p> retailers will deliver substantial cost to many items in the supermarket</p>
<p> trolley.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes. They will be under enormous public scrutiny and public pressure</p>
<p> to make sure that the full value of the removal of the wholesale sales</p>
<p> tax is passed on. Of course they will be. And there'll be additional</p>
<p> powers given to the ACCC to ensure that that happens.</p>
<p>MILLER:</p>
<p>So at the end of the day I suppose we can say we now have 12 months</p>
<p> where people can study, they can look at what's going to happen and</p>
<p> I suppose there is some tidying up to do around the edges as to what</p>
<p> will be GST free and what won't be GST free.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well the design principles of that have been agreed with the Democrats.</p>
<p> Now the actual writing of the legislation has to accord with those</p>
<p> design principles but that will be achieved. The agreement will be</p>
<p> honored in full, there won't be any chiseling away of the agreement</p>
<p> with the Australian Democrats. It was entered into in good faith and</p>
<p> it will be kept in good faith and we do have 12 months and there will</p>
<p> be an extensive public education campaign once the legislation's passed,</p>
<p> there'll be plenty of information made available to the Australian</p>
<p> public, there'll be a lot of assistance given to traders, there'll</p>
<p> be many methods of explaining the operation of the new system and</p>
<p> we've got a whole year for it to come into operation. We're not the</p>
<p> first country in the world who've adopted this kind of system. But</p>
<p> there's a tendency when ever anything big like this happens in Australia</p>
<p> for some people to fuss at the peripheries and lose sight of the grand</p>
<p> design of it and the historic reform that's represented by it.</p>
<p> Now we would have preferred food not be carved out but once Senator</p>
<p> Harradine said no or I cannot it was necessary to see if we could</p>
<p> reach an agreement on another basis and the Democrats felt strongly</p>
<p> about the exclusion of basic food and I knew that I wouldn't get an</p>
<p> agreement with them unless the Government agreed to that. Now it's</p>
<p> as simple as that. The alternative was to walk away entirely and throw</p>
<p> away years of work and throw away the best opportunity this country</p>
<p> has ever had for major tax reform and I wasn't prepared to do that</p>
<p> and that's why I reached the agreement and I'm glad I did and Meg</p>
<p> Lees is clearly glad that she did because we've done something good</p>
<p> for the long term benefit of the country.</p>
<p>MILLER:</p>
<p>Alright. So once again just finally no indexation at this time of</p>
<p> those tax scales.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well no necessity to index tax for 80 per cent of the Australian population</p>
<p> because 80 per cent of them will be below 30 per cent. I mean you</p>
<p> only need indexation if there are a whole lot of brackets that you're</p>
<p> passing into.</p>
<p>MILLER:</p>
<p>Alright. Now may I just change the subject for one moment before we</p>
<p> let you go.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>MILLER:</p>
<p>The fate of those two Australian Care workers in Yugoslavia. What</p>
<p> is the Federal Government going to try and do here.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well everything we humanly can. It's very difficult. It's hard to</p>
<p> fathom the basis on which this verdict was given, it does seem very</p>
<p> severe. It seems extraordinary that it was brought down despite the</p>
<p> rejection of the original charges. There is an appeal being prepared</p>
<p> and we hope that is successful and we'll use every diplomatic means</p>
<p> at our disposal to try and get them home.</p>
<p>MILLER:</p>
<p>Will any consideration be given to sending some sort of special emissary</p>
<p> a-la Jessie Jackson to Yugoslavia?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well he's not a citizen of Australia but we will...........</p>
<p>MILLER:</p>
<p>Well no I'm not talking about him but someone of that calibre.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well Malcolm Fraser's been on a number of occasions, former Prime</p>
<p> Minister, the Chairman of Care Australia. We will try everything we</p>
<p> can John, every single thing we can and I don't mind if it is the</p>
<p> national of another country. If I thought that would get these two</p>
<p> men out I would ask the national of another country to go but the</p>
<p> indications are that that won't necessarily work. But we will continue</p>
<p> to try and we feel for the families. We feel for them very, very deeply</p>
<p> and they're very much in the thoughts of millions of Australians at</p>
<p> this difficult and very stressful time for them.</p>
<p>MILLER:</p>
<p>Prime Minister John Howard thanks for talking to us this morning.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Pleasure.</p>
<p>MILLER:</p>
<p>Bye.</p>
