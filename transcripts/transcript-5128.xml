ELECTORATE TALK<br />
The Government's Budget faces up to the needs of our country<br />
in a world grappling with new and complex economic. problems.<br />
It demonstrates our determination to keep up the fight<br />
against inflation. If we were to relax or relent in that<br />
fight, Australia would slip back, perhaps for decadcs<br />
to come. Investment would falter and jobs would g( out<br />
the window. Development would seize up, and that w " 7-<br />
lose jobs. We would no longer be competitive here z d on<br />
world markets and that would cost jobs. The poor ind<br />
the pensioners would be hit and farmers would strugi-e<br />
to overcome rising costs.<br />
Plainly, John Howard's Budget keeps up our 3 year fight<br />
against inflation.<br />
Again, Government expenditure has been restrained. In the<br />
last three years Government expenditure in real terms has grown<br />
at less than 1 per cent a year. That is a remarkable<br />
achievement, with pressures for expenditure on our country's<br />
social welfare and defence needs. No Government State or<br />
Federal in Australia's history has ever excercised that<br />
degree of restraint in its own expenditures.<br />
The Government's deficit has been significantly reduced,<br />
from nearly 3 per cent of gross domestic product to<br />
1.9 per cent. And what is called the domestic deficit has<br />
been reduced to a bit under $ 900 million the lcwest figure<br />
for six years. These figures are important because they<br />
mean greater funds available for business investment<br />
and housing.<br />
Reduction in Government expenditure, lower deficits these<br />
are instruments in fighting * inflation. But this fight isn't<br />
just an economic objective. It is not just about facts and<br />
figures. It is central to any community that seeks to care<br />
for the needy and build a better and more tolerant society.<br />
So when I say this is an anti-inflation Budget, that doesn't<br />
mean it is only for big business or industry. It means<br />
it is for families everywhere.<br />
Our political opponents have tried to portray it as a Budget<br />
that does nothing for the unemployed. That is absurd and<br />
they know it. By persisting with strong anti-inflation<br />
policies, this Government shows more concern for the unemployed<br />
than those who say spend more money here, spend more<br />
money there. / 2 </p>
<p>1 -2-<br />
It is a false hope that " make work programs of one kind<br />
or another will solve the problem of unemployment.<br />
Governments certainJy hav; e to tackle unemployment through<br />
training programs that equip anrd re-equip people to take<br />
up jobs in companies in all kinds of industry.<br />
But above all, Governments have to create the kind of climate<br />
that encourages development and investment. That gives<br />
a real incentive to create new and lasting job opportunities.<br />
our policies are attracting great new investment programs<br />
in private industry. And now for the first time in years<br />
the numbers of civilian employees and employees in manufacturing<br />
are starting to grow. These are lasting and productive<br />
jobs created in industry after industry.<br />
In spite of expenditure restraint, the Budget has not lost<br />
sight of our commitment to contLLinuing social reform. Because<br />
inflation is higher than forecast at this time last year<br />
for reasons that we are all aware of, we decided to restore<br />
twice-yearly automatic indexation for all indexed p. sions<br />
and benefits. This means that in addition to the Nk. ember<br />
increase, there will be a further increase in May nc -'. year<br />
in line with the rise in the Consumer Price Index.<br />
We also decided to extend the eligibility for pensioner<br />
health cards to single parents and their dependents. This<br />
means that single parents will be able to take advantage of<br />
benefits such as free pharmaceuticals. These changes will<br />
also be available to repatriation pensioners.<br />
On tLop of that, as promised in the 1977 policy speech, we<br />
have decided that the service pension will be extended to<br />
include allied servicemen on the same basis as for<br />
British servicemen.<br />
We have an unparalleled record of help for the handicapped.<br />
This Budget builds on that achievement. Expenditure on help<br />
for the handicapped has been increased by 14 per cent this<br />
year. In the last couple of days many of you will have seen conflicting<br />
headlines and heard conflicting reports about whether you<br />
will get a tax'cut or not. Of course you will.. The surcharge<br />
comes off in December. As a result, every Australian wage and<br />
salary earner will pay less.-and keep on paying less tax<br />
than would otherwise be the case. It is not a hoax or a myth.<br />
We are told that Australians will be paying more tax after<br />
December. That can only happen if wages go up after December.<br />
If people have a larger income, obviously they expect to pay<br />
tax on the extra dollars they earn. But let's not lose sight of<br />
the simple and irrefutable fact from December 1, every<br />
Australian wage and salary earner will have a tax cut, and for<br />
a person on about average weekly earnings, that means paying<br />
$ 4.45 less tax each week.<br />
The Budget is an ec onomic blueprint that equips us to succeed<br />
in a world environment of rising costs and greater competition.<br />
At the same time, it responds to important social and<br />
welfare needs. It is a further affirmation of our commitment<br />
to build on the progress we have made.<br />
