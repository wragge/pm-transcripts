FOR MEDIA WEDNESDAY, 23 JUNE 1982<br />
ROYAL COMMISSION OF INQUIRY INTO DRUG TRAFFICKING<br />
The Prime Minister and the Premiers of New South Wales,<br />
Victoria, and Queensland jointly announced today that the<br />
life of the Royal Commission into Drug Trafficking has been<br />
extended to 28 February 1983.<br />
The Royal Ccommission, which is being conducted by<br />
Mr Justice Stewart was originally required to finalise<br />
its inquiry and report by 30 June 1982. A recent review<br />
of progress, however, indicated that further time would<br />
be necessary for the Commission to complete its inquiries<br />
and prepare its report and recommendations.<br />
The Governor-General and the Governors of New South Wales,<br />
Victoria and Queensland have formally approved the<br />
extension. The terms of: reference of the inquiry require the Royal<br />
Commissioner to inquire into and report on possible drug<br />
trafficking and related activities of Terrence John Clark.<br />
and his associates.<br />
The Commonwealth has previously announced its intention<br />
to extend the terms of this inquiry to deal with allegations<br />
about Nugan Hand. This matter, including the question of<br />
timing, is currently the subject of consultation between<br />
the Commonwealth and State Governments. </p>
