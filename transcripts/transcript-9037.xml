F PRIME MINISTER EMBARGOED UNTIL 7.3OPM EDST<br />
ADDR36S BY TEX PRIME MXNISTZR, THE RON P J KEATINGQ, NP<br />
MASO AN ADDRESS TO THE NlATIONf<br />
When the High Court of Australia handed down the Mabo<br />
judgement last year, it set our generation of Australians<br />
a great challenge.<br />
The Court's decision was unquestionably just.<br />
It rejected a lie and acknowledged a truth.<br />
The lie was terra nullius the convenient fiction that<br />
Australia had been a land of no one.<br />
The truth was native title the fact that the land had<br />
once belonged to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander<br />
Australians and that in some places a legal right to it<br />
had survived the 200 years of European settlem~ ent.<br />
So here was an issue the country could not ignore<br />
either legally, or morally.<br />
There was another form of title that had to become part<br />
of the way we manage land in Australia.<br />
-we owe it. to Aboriginal Australians, to all Australians,<br />
we owe it to our fair and democratic traditions and to<br />
future generations of Australians to recognise this<br />
native title.<br />
Tonight we are within reach of an enlightened, practical<br />
response to Mabo. This week I will be proposing<br />
legislationi to Parliament which meets both the spirit of<br />
the H-igh Court's decision and Australia's<br />
responsibilities and needs.<br />
The Bill will necessarily be complex, but this evening<br />
want to cut through the complexity to some of its simple<br />
prin~ ciples.<br />
t≈ì irst we need to get tile background straight.<br />
over tens of thousands of years Aboriginal people had<br />
developed a complex culture built on a profound<br />
attachment to the land. </p>
<p>The land nourished them spiritually a6 well as<br />
materially. In the landscape and the life upon it they<br />
saw evidence of the epoch of creation. Down through the<br />
generations they passed on laws, customs, traditions and<br />
ceremonies reflecting an obligation to care for the land<br />
which went to the heart of their society.<br />
Yet this most remarkable fact about Australia this<br />
oldest continuous civilisation on earth has until now<br />
been denied by Australian law.<br />
The first European settlers declared that the land had<br />
belonged to no-one and the indigenous Australians were<br />
shunted aside, often with appalling brutality.<br />
Much of the despair and degradation, conflict and<br />
disease, and many of the problems which Aboriginal<br />
Australians face today are a consequence of this<br />
dispossess ion.<br />
we have no need nor any use for guilt. This<br />
generation cannot be held responsible for the cruelty ofprevious<br />
generations.<br />
But to ignore Mabo would be the final cruelty, and we<br />
wg~ J4 be held responsible -by the world and by future<br />
generations of Australians.<br />
And they would be rih to hold us responsible.<br />
There is much in Australian history of which we can be<br />
tremendously proud for here in Australia we have<br />
created a modern, tolerant, free, prosperous and<br />
democratic society.<br />
But we must understand that Australia's success has had a<br />
price and surely the highest price has been paid by<br />
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians. They<br />
often paid with their lives; with their rights, their<br />
dignity and happiness; with their Land.<br />
When the connection to the Jafld was broken their societ~ y<br />
and economy was devastated.<br />
But the connection was not broken everywhere and it is<br />
a testament to the tenacity and resilience of Aboriginal<br />
Australians that so much of the culture so much of the<br />
Aboriginal story -has been passed on through generations<br />
down to this day.<br />
In 1982, Eddie Mabo and four others began action seeking<br />
a legal declaratcion of their traditional land rights in<br />
the Murray islands of the Torres Strait,<br />
Tvn years later onL 3 June 1992, the High Court decided<br />
that his people were entitled as against the whole of !: he </p>
<p>world to possession and I emfphasise Opossessions<br />
occupation, use and enjoyment of these lands.<br />
Thus the High Court of Australia recognised native title<br />
arnd Aboriginal custom and tradition as a source of<br />
Australian common law.<br />
The Court accepted that native title existed where two<br />
fundamental conditions were met:<br />
that their connection with the land had been<br />
maintained, unbroken down through the years<br />
and Lhat this title had not been overturned by any<br />
action of a government to use the land or to give it<br />
to somebody else.<br />
It is probably only where there is so-called vacant Crown<br />
Land, and in remote areas where traditional Aboriginal<br />
life has not been disrupted, that native title exists.<br />
Nevertheless, the high Court's decision posed manyquestions.<br />
Who holds native title over the land, and where?<br />
What rights does native title give to Aboriginal people<br />
to control access to the land, and the use of it?<br />
What rules should govern dealings in native title land,<br />
and how can our vital land-based industries get on with<br />
the business of developing our natural resources.<br />
From the outset the Government recognised that these<br />
uncertainties needed to be faced: the Court had made its<br />
decision but there was not the body of administration and<br />
law to give effect to it.<br />
From late last year the Government has been developing a<br />
framework for such a law and discussing the principles on<br />
which it would be based the first of these principles<br />
being justice for indigenous Australians.<br />
What sort of country would we be how could we claim<br />
respect for the law if, after the highest court in the<br />
land has recognised native title, we denyi it?<br />
How could we say that we stand for a fair go if we were<br />
to wipe away a title to land which has lasted through<br />
thousands of years of occupation of the continent and 200<br />
years of European settlement-How could we explain it to<br />
Aboriginal Australians? How could we explai. n it to the<br />
wo rl1d?<br />
To deny Lhe High Court decision, to deny native title in<br />
Australian common law would deny justice: for it wo-ild<br />
deny indigenous Australians rights to land enjoyed bry<br />
other Australians. </p>
<p>-M I<br />
And the result could only be antagonism courtroom<br />
battles and uncertainty in the commu'unity and in industry.<br />
There is no decent or practical option but to recognise<br />
the High Court decision and make it work.<br />
Which brings me to the second of our objectives.<br />
We must maintain a system of land management in Australia<br />
which provides clear and predictable rules; security and<br />
certainty for people who hold land; and a capacity for<br />
dealings in land to proceed effectively.<br />
So it must be an efficient system of land management, but<br />
it must also be fair.<br />
The legislation which we will introduce this week will<br />
accomplish these objectives.<br />
it will enable us to determine who has native title.<br />
where, and the rights involved.<br />
It will give Aboriginal people holding native title<br />
the right to negotiate about actions affecting their<br />
land a right, but not a veto.<br />
it will permit governments to step in and decide, in<br />
the final analysis, whether an important economic<br />
project should proceed.<br />
It will have the Conrnonwealth Goverrnent play its<br />
proper role in setting clear rules and standards for<br />
dealings which affect native title, but leave land<br />
management to State and Territory governments if<br />
they accept the national standards.<br />
It will set up a system of courts and tribunals, in<br />
effect as an umpire on matters of native title.<br />
It will, to the extent practicable, preserve native<br />
title from extinguishment, and where it is<br />
extinguished, ensure just compensation, and...<br />
It will provide security, so that no one who owns a<br />
home, a farm, a mine, a tourist operation no one<br />
need have concern about their tenure.<br />
No one group will get all they want from this legislation<br />
not Aboriginal people, not industry, not governments.<br />
But the national interest will be served, and only the<br />
Commonwealth legislation is capable of serving it.<br />
As you know, Uit. e moment western Australia disagrees<br />
with r-he Zomonwealth approach and is trying to ago it<br />
alone." </p>
<p>Going it alone is not the answer. Ultimately, the<br />
Couunonwealth law will prevail over the Western Australian<br />
legislation and in the meantime uncertainty will only<br />
continue. There is only one way to provide certainty and that is<br />
with a single, uniform, national approach, a fair and<br />
predictable set of rules which everyone can work with.<br />
This is not just my view, it is the view of seven out of<br />
our eight States and Territories, all of whom believe<br />
this legislation can work.<br />
It is also the view of the head of the National Farmers,<br />
Federation and, among other prominent Australians, senior<br />
memnbers of the Opposition parties.<br />
With the challenge of Mdbo effectively met -with native<br />
title efficiently brought within our land management<br />
system, we can move on.<br />
We can move on to see Mabo as a tremendous opportunity -it<br />
18.<br />
An opportunity to right an historic wrong.<br />
An opportunity to transcend the history of dispossession.<br />
An opportunity to restore the age-old link between<br />
Aboriginal land and culture.<br />
An opportunity to heal a source of bitterness.<br />
An opportunity to recognise Aboriginal culture as a<br />
defining element of our nationhood and culture and to<br />
make clear that this Australia, this modern, free and<br />
tolerant Australia can be a secure and bountiful place<br />
for all including the firs. t Australians.<br />
