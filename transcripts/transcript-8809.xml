TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THlE HON P J KEATING MP,<br />
PRESS CONFERENCE, ADELAIDE, 4 FEBRUARY 1993<br />
E&amp; OE PR-OOF COPY<br />
PM: I thought I'd start by saying a few things to you, and then you can fire away after<br />
that. The point of the visit today is to cut through the ( inaudible). This State has<br />
problems from which it is not going to extricate itself. We've had national<br />
problems with the recession and post-recession period, and the recovery. But these<br />
problems are more particular than the general problems. So what I've sought to do<br />
is to bring the debate into the open. That is, because South Australians are going<br />
to have to make a choice soon about the national government. T7hat choice is<br />
going to materially affect them and I want them to realise that that choice is going<br />
to affect them.<br />
in truth, it's only the Federal Governmrrent that has the wherewithal to deal with<br />
South Australia's particular problems. South Australians must bc scrutinising the<br />
policies of the two parties and ask the question who will be prepared to provide the<br />
resources to enable South Australia to work its way out of its problems. In other<br />
words, ask the kcy question, which of the partics has a policy for South Australia,<br />
which of the twvo is intcrested in it and which will provide the resources for the<br />
resolution of South Australia's problems? This Govemtmcnct has always accepted<br />
that South Australia necdcd special attention. It's not been in a position to pick up<br />
a lot of the buoyancy of the ' 80s that camne to the Eastern States, or doesn't have the<br />
base in wealth that, naturally, Western Australia has. So that's why, in the course<br />
of the 19RNs, while the Treasury was arguing for per capita funding for States, I<br />
stuck with fiscal equal isation. Fiscal equalisation. meant another $ 380 odd million<br />
into South Australia. In other words, I always took the view that you had to lift the<br />
smaller States up because just paying on a per capita basis meant that services in<br />
this State, the economy of the State, and the strength of the State would he<br />
diminished. </p>
<p>Over the same period, we made very clear that because we believed the State<br />
needed special attention we argued that the submari -ne prograrn would be best set<br />
up in South Australia, again to provide more balliest to its industrial structure over<br />
a long period of time. The same with the multi-functio ' n polls, we've done what<br />
we can to facilitate that. In my visit to Japan earlier in the year, the Minister for<br />
international Trade and Industry told me that MMT is strongly behind the<br />
development of the MFP in South Australia. And with that commitment and the<br />
successful development of the MFP will come a lot more interest by Japan in the<br />
State of South Australia.<br />
T'he car industry, the Government has always taken the view that Australia needed<br />
a car industry. When one asks the essential question, should Australia have a car<br />
industry?, we've said yes. We've made clear that governments have to do things<br />
that both maintain and build these industries. And that's why in cars, and in<br />
componentry, we've always had South Australia particularly in mind because it's<br />
such a large part of the Australian vehicle industry and components industry.<br />
More recently, of course, is the One Nation Statement. I included in that the<br />
Melbourne-Adelaide standard gauge railway, which is going to be built, and the<br />
link to Port Adelaide, so that we tie South Australia more into the Eastern States'<br />
economics through a rail linkage that should have been reality always had. There<br />
can be no more basic thing than transportation and transportation services to<br />
underpin any economy. I've taken the view that in terms of South Australia that<br />
should be done.<br />
Building Better Cities,. again we've got programs and funding across Adelaide and<br />
the State. The road programs, the cooperative research centres where we focussed<br />
particular funding on institutions and their collaboration with companies for<br />
particular areas of rcscarch which we think are in South Australia's long term<br />
interests. So let me just say this, Labor knows that South Australia needs federal policy, that<br />
is in terms of industry, in terms of its industrial breadth, and fcderal hclp in terms<br />
of its fiscal position.<br />
I'll just say a couple of things about the Coalition. By contrast, Dr Hewson offers<br />
the scorched earth policy. He wants zero tariffs he wants zero tariffs for cars, for<br />
the motor industry. He wants t cut Commonwealth revenues to the States he<br />
wants to cut $ 9 billion from outlays and make a very large cut in Commonwealth<br />
revenues to the States. He has Prcmiers Mr Fahey and Mr Kennett breathing down<br />
his neck on fiscal cqualisation they say that payments shouldn't be made in the<br />
way they're being made to the smaller States. Thiat means that $ 385 million which<br />
comes across under the equalisation pool is at risk. Of course this would come on<br />
top of the ncarly.$ 300 million whigh the South Australian budget has got to find<br />
now to service the State Bank debt. </p>
<p>So I put the question can South Australians trust Dr Hewson to withstand the<br />
pressures of Premiers Fahey and Kennett in seeking to renegotiate the fiscal<br />
equalisation policy and thc formulas which attach to it? What I would contend to<br />
you is that that sort of policy would push South Australia under.<br />
Perhaps could conclude on this point. Dr H-ewson has no concept of regions. He<br />
doesn't understand that) for instance, caus and components are important to So uth<br />
Australia. H-I doesn't undcrstand sugar is important to Queensland. It's basically<br />
an ideological approach which says if you tax your clothes and your haircuts and<br />
your water bills and your power bills, then that's all than needs to be done, you<br />
don't need to think about regions as regions, you don't need to do things for<br />
regions, you don't need to comprehend regional economies and their needs. Well<br />
the Government does, and that's why it has only been the federal Labor<br />
Government in the ' 80s and early ' 90s which has looked at South Australia<br />
particularly and set up the programs and policies have already mentioned to you.<br />
But now that the problems of the State Bank hangs over the South Australian<br />
budget, given the fact that the revenue base of the State is limited, think there's<br />
about $ 600 odd thousand tax payers only to carry this burden, then we believe that<br />
this matter ought to be brought into national focus, that the shadow debate should<br />
stop, the South Australian Government by itself left to itself left to its own<br />
resources is not in a position to stabilise the dcbt, and therefore I'm willing to, after<br />
a federal election, help and deal with fiscal problem and stabilisation of South<br />
Australia's debt cooperatively with thc govcrnment of Premier Arnold.<br />
So I think I'll leave my remarks at that and invite questions.<br />
J: ( inaudible).<br />
PM-No, no, how do you contend that? Thie fact of the matter is you've got a debt of<br />
$ 3.15 billion, which is already now being carried from the State budget into the<br />
bank. That's going to cost South Australians on an ongoing basis about $ 300<br />
million a year. What's going to happen, left unattended South Australia is going to<br />
get itself into a debt trap. It just won't be able to meet the interest on the interest. I<br />
don't think this has been said quite as obviously as this, and that's the point of me<br />
saying it.<br />
J: How much arc you prepared to offer?<br />
PM: It's not a matter of that, it's a matter to negotiate. I've told you that I've already<br />
spoken to the Premicr about the question of the tax compensation which flows<br />
from the State Bank becoming a federal tax paying institution, thcrcforc diverting<br />
the receipts from the Treasury's budgct to the budget of the Commonwealth. In<br />
that case, what has to be done is that the Commonwealth will negotiate wvith South<br />
Australia as to the valuc of those stream of payments. The stream of tax paymcnts<br />
which were formerly going to the South Australian budget will now go to<br />
Commonwealth budget. They can be capitalised into a capital sumn, and that </p>
<p>capital sum can meet some of the debt obligation, as indeed can the proceeds of<br />
the sale of the franchise of the bank meet those debt obligations.<br />
J: But that's not special treatment, that's no more than the State Bank of Victoria or<br />
the GIO received.<br />
PM: For a start the bank has to be sold, that's what we're saying. Two, that we will then<br />
negotiate. It'ns a matter of negotiation. What we see as the value of that stream of<br />
payments, what the tax position of the bank is, what the value of that stream is<br />
worth. Then on top of that is, beyond that the residual debt that has to be serviced.<br />
South Australia will need Commonwealth assistance, just as this Governent<br />
provided Commonwealth assistance to the Northern Territory, and as we<br />
negotiated Commonwealth assistance for the State of Tasmania for similar reasons.<br />
But the reasons are not as large or as acute as the problems here.<br />
J; The debtors have pointed out it's around $ 3 billion. If the bank makes the sort of<br />
profits it would bc expected to, it would be around $ 100 million a year which<br />
would indicate you could expect a profit stream of around ( inaudible) a year.<br />
Given those profits over 5 years, what are you offering, $( inaudible)?<br />
PM: I don't know, that's to be negotiated. Obviously it's not a back of the envelope<br />
occasion, it's a matter of sitting down and working out what that income stream is<br />
worth. did that with the State Bank of Victoria, and premier Kirner and I<br />
successfully arranged the State Bank's sale which plugged a very big hole in the<br />
debt of Victoria, and has now seen that bank incorporated solidly into the<br />
Commonwealth Bank of Australia, making the Commonwealth Bank an even<br />
stronger institution than it was, and of course most particularly protecting the<br />
depositors in Victoria. That negotiation took place and a similar one will take<br />
place here. In fact we've already had discussions about it.<br />
I: Mr Keating, why is it impossible to work out the details before the election?<br />
PM: The details on the bank?<br />
J: Yes.<br />
PM: The details on the bank..<br />
1: And your proposition?<br />
PM: That's only on one thing, that is on the income stream. But then the franchise has<br />
got to be cleaned up, the debt skinned out of it, and sold. Nobody is going to buy a<br />
bank with a whole lot of contingent liabilities. The franchise has got to be sold<br />
clean.<br />
J: ( inaudible) </p>
<p>PM: There would have to be a due diligence done obviously, as there was with the State<br />
Blank of Victoria.<br />
1: The Bank is clean now..<br />
PM: That depends on the view of the buyer. Buyers have Oarticular views about<br />
cleanliness, and they're called due diligence. And they'll do a due diligence to<br />
make sure that when the franchise is offered that they can successfully manage it<br />
and confidently buy it. When that happens, then the income stream can be one of<br />
the key issues.<br />
J: How quickly do you expect to sell the Bank?<br />
PM: I think the Government of South Australia should be moving to put the Bank in a<br />
position for sale, and to develop a sales process.<br />
3: Looking at the GIO's sale, that took a couple of years.<br />
PM: We did the State Bank of Victoria in a much shorter time than that. And it was<br />
quite a complex situation because..<br />
J: It won't be a shotgun wedding, will it, with the Commonwealth Bank?<br />
PM: [ t all depends on what a particular bank's market share is in South Australia and<br />
whether there would be trade practices problems putting togethcr what is already a<br />
large market share, combined with an even bigger market share.<br />
J: Who would buy the bank, Prime Minister?<br />
PM: The market has -shown that busincss can expand their stock for acquisitions, and<br />
obviously there are a number of both domestic and foreign banks who may well be<br />
interested in it.<br />
1: Would you prefer a foreign buyer?<br />
PM: No.<br />
J: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: That's always been a comimercial matter, whether it's been commercially viable.<br />
Every study we've had, no-one has ever stepped forward to do it.<br />
J. Are you saying you'd allow the sale of the State Bank of South Australia<br />
( inaudible) foreign ( inaudible)? </p>
<p>PM: I wouldn't, no. But it may be that the large domestic banks here This will be the<br />
last great franchise to be sold in Australia. The big State Bank of New South<br />
Wales was incorporated into the Commonwcalth Bank in 1931. The<br />
Commonwealth Bank of Australia was largely a national bank flying on one wing,<br />
that was on New South Wales. It got the pigeon pair together when it picked up<br />
the State Bank of Victoria. There are no other such franchises left, except the Stae<br />
Bank of South Australia. Thiere's the R and I Bank, but it's a much smaller<br />
institution, in Western Australia. The only other large one is the State Bank of<br />
South Australia.<br />
J: Mr Keating, are you cons idcri ng suuing Dr Hewson over his allegations that you<br />
made policy decisions for personal gain?<br />
PM: Dr Hewson made an intemperate remark yesterday, it's in the same class as the<br />
intemperate remark he made about Bob Carr saying he was suspect because he<br />
didn't have any children and didn't drive a motor car, the same intemperate<br />
remarks he made about renters saying you could always tell a renter in the street by<br />
the way they look after their house. I put it in that category. Dr Hcwson would be<br />
wise to think Mcore he speaks.<br />
J: You're not considering suing him?<br />
Pm: rye got no more to say about that.<br />
J: On fiscal equalisation, in the last three thc years the fiscal equalisation payments<br />
have been reduced, have they not, to South Australia, it's been a feature of the local<br />
budget, are you saying this will stop that downward trend?<br />
PM: No, I'm saying that there's a pool of nearly $ 2 billion which is distributed to the<br />
smaller States under fiscal equalisation. I'm saying that as an express issue in<br />
policy I believe that fiscal equalisation should be maintained. That is, that the<br />
smaller States should be supported, that they can't providc the services left to their<br />
own devices and their own finances.<br />
J: Will that pool get larger or will South Australia's share get<br />
PM: The Grants Commission makes recommendations each year about the revenue<br />
effort of the States and it equalises. It makes recommendations on the<br />
equalisation, to sec what the relevant disadvantage is. The Grants Commission has<br />
done that year in. year out, and the Government mkes a decision about it every<br />
year. The issue in principle is the pool. Fiscal equalisation is an interventionist<br />
policy. One has got to cut across per capita paymcnts, that's equal payments per<br />
head across all the Australian States, and say in an interventionist way we believe<br />
there will be express payment streams coming to these States for these reasons.<br />
What I was contending to you was the philosophic basis on which Dr I-ewson<br />
works is non-interentic a per capita. Thiat's a big risk for South Australia, </p>
<p>particularly a big risk when he's got Fahey and Kennett breathing down his neck<br />
about it. So, if South Australians ask themselves the question could they trust Dr<br />
Hewson to keep the payments off with the two large States on his back, both<br />
Coalition States?, well I'll leave the answer to you.<br />
J; Why can't you quantify the sort of offer, why Can't you put some sort of figure on<br />
it?<br />
PM: Because it's not a matter of simple figures in response to a simple question. This is<br />
Dot simple, it's complicated. And it's complex by virtue of the state of the State's<br />
budget, the paucity of its revenue base, the weakness of its revenue base, the<br />
problems of the State Bank, and being able to pull together a debt profile which<br />
doesn't see the budget of South Australia caught in a debt trap.<br />
J: Knowing all of that, can't you give us somne indication of how high you're prepared<br />
to go?<br />
PM: It's a ridiculous question, you're asking a simple onc number question. That's the<br />
sort of question you'd expect from page 30 of a tabloid.<br />
J: A ball park figure would be reasonable.<br />
Pm: rm saying that we will sit down with the Governnmcnt of South Australia looking<br />
at all thcse issues the sale of the Bank, the value of the tax stream, the<br />
compensation, and what further Commonwealth assistance is ncessary to provide<br />
a profile to South Australia's budget arnd debt position.<br />
1: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: I don't think anyone else has come and told you that your budget in the long term<br />
isn't viable. Has anyone? I know you're super news sleuths, but has anyone tole<br />
you that? And if they haven't, it might be worthwhile you taking the issue<br />
seriously.<br />
3: We have been taken seriously which is why we've been slashing public service<br />
numbhers and Lonrd knows what else in this town for the last two years. ( inaudible)<br />
the cutbacks in the federal budget. Are you not prepared to put any figure at all.?<br />
PM: Of course I'm not, hut I'm making it very clear that I don't believe that 1k,; South<br />
Australian budget is capable of dealing with its debt position, and that the<br />
Commonwealth Government is saying it will asist, it will provide federal<br />
assistance. That's the issue in principle.<br />
J: if you decidcd not to sell the Bank will there still bc federal assistance?-</p>
<p>8<br />
PM: I think the Bank should be sold and I think the Premier's view is that it should be<br />
sold, too.<br />
1: And that's the only condition on which ( inaudible)?<br />
PM: The State has got to make its own efforts to deal with its debt problem.<br />
J. Prime Minister, on Leo McLeay, do you believe he should stand downi?<br />
PM: Let's just deal with this issue of substance.<br />
1: T1hen can we talk about whether you are concerned about what Mr Hawke has<br />
said?<br />
PM: I'm not going to answer those questions, forget about those things.<br />
J: Do you agree with former Prime Minister Hawke that you'd lose the election if it<br />
was held today?<br />
PM: You people have a responsibility for reporting the news that's kcy to the future and<br />
well-being of the community of South Australia. I'm a Commonwealth Prime<br />
Minister and I've come here to talk to you about it. I'm not interested in picking up<br />
Mr Hawke's interview of last night.<br />
J: As a national broadcaster, Mr Keating, we have an obligation to service other parts<br />
of Australia, and they're the questions we've been told to ask by our Canberra<br />
bureaux.<br />
PM: Just tell them politely that the Prime Minister refused to give you an answer on<br />
that. OK?<br />
J: OK, looking at pay TV then, the former Prime Minister says your pay TV policy is<br />
strange.<br />
PM: Before we go through all these things, have you got any more questions about<br />
South Australia?<br />
J: On fiscal equalisation, how can you undertake to make the pool larger when you're<br />
running such a large deficit now?<br />
PM: It's not a matter of making the pool larger. The Grants Commission decides how<br />
much is required to equalise the payments.<br />
J: Will we hc getting some paymcnts that would have othcrwise gone to Western<br />
Australia or the Northern Territory? </p>
<p>PM: No, you will be getting assistance beyond that which comes in the pool. That is,<br />
the Commonwealth will add to the financial assistance grants by way of direct<br />
Commonwealth financial assistance, as we did for the Northern Territory and as<br />
we've done for Tasmania.<br />
1: It won't go through the Grants Commission.<br />
PM; No, it would be an express policy decision of the Commonwealth, as it was for<br />
those two States.<br />
J: On the issue of the car tariffs and how that affects South Australia, what is<br />
different about what you are saying now to your policy a month ago?<br />
PM: Dr Hewson has reaffirmed in Fightback Mark It a zero tariff policy. He's saying he<br />
doesn't believe the car industry Mr McLachlan said it for them he said it is<br />
restructure or perish', was his expression. They're saying we don't particularly say<br />
there should be a car industry. T'here's going to be a zero tariff, if you can survive,<br />
fine, if you can't survive, bad luck. We're saying something totally different.<br />
We're saying there should be a car industry, and we're saying that the tariff levels<br />
which the Government have determined are ones which will keep the car industry<br />
viable and let it grow. It was on the basis of those tariffs that John Button,<br />
epsritnabcilpisahlliyn, g aan sdt amtey-soeflf-twheer-ea ratb lpel atnot iinn1t eVreisctt otrhiea . T oIty'so otan Mthoet obra sCiso omfp t ahnayt policy<br />
that I believe that you'll get expansion from the current car companies of South<br />
Australia. But only on the basis that the notion that you can provide some level of<br />
protection that compensates for the small volume of production. Nobody is going<br />
to invest in a state-of-the-art plant, to build 35-40,000 units, particularly when<br />
we're talking about the Japanese, they can build them in Japan. I went to the<br />
Toyota plant late last year where they have a run of 310,000 cars per year in one<br />
production run. It's much more simple for that company to make that run<br />
340,000 and build all the cars in Japan, than to seek to build such a plant in<br />
Australia on a zero tariff with the disabilities of distance and costs and the<br />
disabilities of scale. So there has to he some recognition of that in the tariff. The<br />
Govermecnt recognises that, the Opposition doesn't. As far as the Opposition is<br />
concerned, the car industry in South Australia can disappear if it can't stand on its<br />
own two feet with a zero tariff. This Would be fatal to the South Australian<br />
economy, fatal to the city of Adelaide.<br />
1 </p>
<p>J: You don't think there should be a slow down in the tariff cuts?<br />
PM: We had a long negotiation with the car companies when we put these together, in<br />
1988 and then in 1991, and they phased down to effective end paints of 35 per cent<br />
average effective rates of assistance of 35 per cent. I think there's a reasonable<br />
trade off there between the interests of consumers and the interests of car<br />
companies, and the employment base of cities such as Adelaide in South Australia<br />
in that kind of tariff level. If one takes the view that at zero and the survival of the<br />
fittest, the fittest will be the 300-400,000 per unit through put companies in Japan<br />
and elsewhere.<br />
3: The economic climate has assisted with the balance of payments...?<br />
PM: No, no. Thie proof of the pudding is in the eating. The Toyota company is one of<br />
the largest motor companies in the world, it has the fastest growing market share of<br />
any company in the world., it made a decision in the face of that plan to put in<br />
what will be the most modem plant of its kind in the world.<br />
3: That company's President, Mr Robert Johnston, was critical of the L abor Party's<br />
plans..<br />
PM: They made it quite clear, he said it by virtue of the fact they made a decision to<br />
invest.<br />
J. ( inaudible)<br />
PM: The Toyota company decided to set up a state-of-the-art plant in Australia on the<br />
announced tariff policy of this Government. That's it, say no more. They'<br />
wouldn't have done it for zero tariffs, and Mr Johnston made that very clear to Dr<br />
Hewson, as has Mr Quinn and everyone else here in South Australia. The zero<br />
tariff policy in manufacturing is a zero Adelaide policy. That's Dr Hcwson's<br />
policy.<br />
J: sugar decision the other day and now help for the State Bank of South Australia<br />
today, is that a reaction to bad polls?<br />
PM: The sugar decision has been onc which has been on for a couple of years. We sent<br />
a refercncc to the Industry Commission in 1991, and it's come back, and we've<br />
made decisions, and we made a decision the other day which will radically change<br />
the sugar industry. The sugar industry is largely a State regulated industry, the<br />
Commonwealth is only a marginal player in it, it only has a role through the sugar<br />
tariff. But all the things such as land assignment and all the other pricing signals<br />
are questions which devolvc to the Queensland Government. The Queensland<br />
Government has a rcfort-plan for 1995-96 which wc'vc now bcen able to tail<br />
into. So it was a sensible reform decision, it has nothing to do with hand outs<br />
which is implicit in your question. In rcspcct of South Australia, you have a </p>
<p>problem if the national leadership of this country ignores or fails to understand the<br />
problems of South Australia.<br />
3: We've had this problem for a couple of years too.<br />
PM: I know, and so have 1, but I've made it quite clear that the Commonwealth will<br />
provide financial assistance. That's the key change. I've been speaking to the<br />
Government about the problems now for months.<br />
J. Co-operative research ccntrcs..<br />
PM: It's in the press statement. One's on the wine industr! y iticulture, the other is one<br />
sensor signalling and information, the other is on tissuc growth and genetic<br />
engineering, there's a number of them. These things are all again there to direct<br />
and try to foster the development of certain industries. We've set up 51<br />
cooperative research centres across the country, and they are there to try to<br />
promote areas of Australian science that will give Australia a comparative<br />
advantage in the world through technology, and that has to be our long suit.<br />
Australia's great comparative advantage is not its mountains of minerals or its<br />
acres of wheat, Australia's great comparative advantage is its education system, its<br />
research and development base. And it is that that we're promoting. We've<br />
invested $ 250 million in cooperative re. search centres and we've invested with that<br />
$ 650 million from the private sector. So there's now the better part of about $ 900<br />
million or a billion dollars worth of effort going into these novel areas of scientific<br />
research and development, and the development possibiliis flowing from them.<br />
Dr Hewson says you shouldn't have that intcrvention, it's sullying the market, they<br />
shouldn't be there, we don't believe in them. Whereas in fact, it's pulling together<br />
companies, universities, specialist institutes to do specialised things that can give<br />
Australia a huge Icap in certain areas of technology and in production. That's why<br />
they're important across the Commonwealth and just as important in South<br />
Australia.<br />
J: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: There's always a debate about MH-and MRC budgets with all the medical research<br />
faculties around the country. This is a scparate program altogether. The<br />
cooperative research centres are a separate program, which as I say has been so<br />
successful we've matched $ 600 million of private investment with $ 250 million of<br />
government investment in what is going to be a very novel thing. opened one<br />
recently in Tasmania in Eucalypt plantation technology. T'here it is said that<br />
years growth of a Eucalypt trce can be accomplished in 7 years, that the trees will<br />
be more resistant to bugs, they'll be straighter, that they'll saw better for saw log,<br />
that it will establish plantation. Thiese are the things where Australia obviously has<br />
an advantage and should be pursuing it. And it's what governments should do.<br />
Governments have to decide whether they're going to support particular industries<br />
or particular enterprises, just as I've made the point to you about cars. </p>
<p>J: On the ca industry, why are you so inflexible by not agreeing to a mid-term<br />
review on the tariff policy?<br />
PM: Because the flexibility was all occurring in 1990-91 when we had these<br />
continuing conversations with the motor vehicle industry. That's when all the<br />
flexibility was.<br />
J: They asked for 25 per cent?<br />
PM: O, but there's a thing called the national interest, there's people out there in motor<br />
cars that are now $ 20,000 that would have been $ 30,000 without thcse changes.<br />
So we're going to sell more cars. That's going to be good for Australia, good for<br />
the motor vehicle industry. It's a trade off. It's a matter of finding the right<br />
balance, but the right balance is not zero. That's the point.<br />
I. But we sell fewer cars now than we did 20 years ago.<br />
PM: Yes, and why is that? Buyer resistance to price.<br />
J: Why would it hurt to have a mid-term review?<br />
PM: Because the review was mid-term. We started this in ' 88.<br />
J: There's a lot of volatility in there, particularly with currcncies.<br />
PM: Yes, and thc volatilities run in favour of higher protection for the motor vehicle<br />
industry.<br />
J: At this minute.<br />
PM: The currency has fallen by 12 per cent in trade weighted terms, which far outweights<br />
any shift down in the tariff, far out-weighs.<br />
1: The currency must recover in the..<br />
PM: I'm just saying to you, you make decisions on the basis on where you believe the<br />
effective average rates of protcction can sustain and grow a motor industry that<br />
gives a consumer a fair go, that we don't pay through the nose for cars, where the<br />
quality rises, where we end up with export potential, where those balances lie.<br />
And the time for all that flexibility was when we gave it the flexibility in 1990-<br />
91.<br />
