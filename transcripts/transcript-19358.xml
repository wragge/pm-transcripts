<p>OfficeMax Australia will create up to 70 new jobs in a high tech new call centre in Derwent Park Tasmania, thanks to a $600,000 investment by the Gillard Government.</p>
<p>Backed by the Gillard Government and the Tasmanian Government, OfficeMax will create the jobs in a new call centre at their Derwent Park facility, north of Hobart.</p>
<p>The additional jobs have been made possible through $600,000 in funding from the Federal Government and $200,000 in funding from the State Government.</p>
<p>The State Government will also waive payroll tax for the new employees.</p>
<p>The Gillard Government's contribution will also go towards upgrading facilities, including improved access for people with disability and high tech equipment to make use of the National Broadband Network.</p>
<p>Staff at the new call centre will utilise the NBN.</p>
<p>Recruitment for the call centre is expected to start next year.</p>
<p>If the business model is successful, OfficeMax has indicated it may expand further and build new facilities in the area.</p>
<p>Today's announcement is good news for the Tasmanian economy, and it shows the Gillard Government's ongoing commitment to policies which support and create jobs in Australia. </p>
