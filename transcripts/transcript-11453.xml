<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, you said that you wanted to listen to people on this</p>
<p> tour, what have you heard that's impressed you most?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, a lot of things have impressed me. The continued resilience and</p>
<p> optimism of most people in the country, that's impressed me. I am</p>
<p> impressed with the way in which individual communities have worked together</p>
<p> to tackle problems involving aborigines. In Bourke, for example, it was</p>
<p> quite clear to me that the cooperation of communities in tackling unemployment</p>
<p> and other issues, the same thing here in Dubbo today, the programme at</p>
<p> the abattoirs is partly funded by our Commonwealth employment programme</p>
<p> for aborigines in Mr Reith's Department. That involves a local business</p>
<p> which is a major employer. It involves support from the local community,</p>
<p> it involves the Federal Government and it involves the leaders of the</p>
<p> indigenous community.</p>
<p>The important thing is that from all the people I spoke to today and</p>
<p> yesterday they see these problems as being a challenge for the whole community,</p>
<p> they are not...they haven't got a situation where a local community</p>
<p> is saying to the aboriginal community: that's your problem, you have</p>
<p> got to solve it. And equally, the aboriginal people to whom I have spoke</p>
<p> are not saying: well look, this is because we've been badly treated</p>
<p> and they have got to come and help us. They see the thing as a joint responsibility.</p>
<p> I think that's marvellous and that is how we have got to tackle these</p>
<p> problems and I was asked by somebody whether I'd had a separate meeting</p>
<p> with ATSIC commissioners and I said, no. I pointed out that I hadn't</p>
<p> had a separate meeting with the NSW Farmers Federation either. What I</p>
<p> had done was I'd met the aboriginal leaders and the farm leaders</p>
<p> as part of community meetings and that is how you should do it because</p>
<p> it reminds everybody that they are part of the same community.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Do you think that you have made yourself accessible to everybody on this</p>
<p> trip?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, you can never make yourself accessible to everybody. I think given</p>
<p> the kind of responsibilities you have got to have as a Prime Minister</p>
<p> I have made myself about as accessible as I could. Prior to doing this</p>
<p> interview I went on a street walk from the hotel where the lunch was up</p>
<p> to the ABC Studio and met, sort of, several dozen people including shopkeepers</p>
<p> and chatted. Look, you could do that all day and every day but you have</p>
<p> got to also splice into that individual meetings with people. The lunch</p>
<p> today was very good, it had a cross-section of clergymen, stock and station</p>
<p> agents, graziers, aboriginal leaders, health workers, teachers, police.</p>
<p> You need all of those gatherings to get a bit of a distillation of what</p>
<p> people are thinking.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What do you think the bush is telling you about the sale of the rest</p>
<p> of Telstra?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh, it's quite mixed. A lot of people support it, some don't.</p>
<p> That's what I am hearing. I find people supporting it and I find</p>
<p> people opposing it. It's quite wrong to, sort of, get one individual</p>
<p> and say that represents the bush. I mean, I heard somebody being interviewed</p>
<p> on a programme last night, I think it was out at Dubbo saying we are all</p>
<p> against the sale of Telstra. That's not right, they're not all</p>
<p> against it. Some are, some aren't. And what I am saying to people</p>
<p> is, is it better to have tens of billions of dollars of public investment</p>
<p> tied up in a telecommunications company or is it better to have that invested</p>
<p> in infrastructure.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>But isn't improvement to services and infrastructure contingent</p>
<p> on the sale of the remaining...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, no. What is contingent is a much greater and a faster improvement.</p>
<p> And there'll continue to be improvement whether we sell Telstra or</p>
<p> not but you won't get as great an improvement and it won't come</p>
<p> as fast than it would if we were able to sell the rest of Telstra because</p>
<p> we won't have the resources. I mean, you have to face the fact that</p>
<p> there is a finite limit on the resources available. We are already upgrading</p>
<p> communications facilities in the bush and we'll go on doing that,</p>
<p> we'll go on spending money. All I am saying is that we could spend</p>
<p> more if we got rid of the whole of Telstra. We could also pay off our</p>
<p> national debt which would make it more responsible to sell more. It is</p>
<p> not just a question of the aggregate amount but it's the circumstances</p>
<p> in which it's spent. And if you're spending against the background</p>
<p> and still having a high national debt that's not as responsible as</p>
<p> spending against the background and having eliminated Commonwealth debt.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>I suppose one of the concerns though is that rural and regional people</p>
<p> feel that services are a right not something that should be dependent</p>
<p> on a trading off of other things.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, but I am not talking here about services, I am talking about, you</p>
<p> know, really more infrastructure. I mean, services like medical services</p>
<p> and so forth, I mean, of course they are a right - irrespective of the</p>
<p> sale or not of Telstra. But there are a lot of the service things that</p>
<p> could be done which aren't really strictly speaking services but</p>
<p> will nonetheless add to the economic strength of rural Australia which</p>
<p> will occur more rapidly and perhaps in greater volume if we were able</p>
<p> to sell Telstra. I mean, in the end the Government has a finite amount</p>
<p> of money and it's got to make a decision, it's got to allocate</p>
<p> priorities. And what I am saying is that at the moment we have invested</p>
<p> as a nation tens of billions of dollars in the ownership of a telecommunications</p>
<p> company. We are tying up tens of billions of dollars. We can't do</p>
<p> anything else with that money while we own Telstra. That's the point</p>
<p> I am making. It's the taxpayers' money and it's a question</p>
<p> of whether you think it's better to leave it invested in Telstra</p>
<p> or is it better to invest it in retiring debt and in infrastructure, that's</p>
<p> the point.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>You have said no more cuts to rural government services but what about</p>
<p> Commonwealth Government services...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Commonwealth Government services.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Yes, Commonwealth Government services. But what about services that have</p>
<p> already been cut, are you proposing to reinstate any of those services?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Some are already coming back via the rural transaction centres. What</p>
<p> we are doing there is, in fact, restoring services that we didn't</p>
<p> take away. Some of the services we are replacing there are financial services</p>
<p> that were taken away when the banks closed. And take something like services</p>
<p> for the unemployed, the Job Network, the second tender round has resulted</p>
<p> in 50 per cent more job providers going into the region. There are 300</p>
<p> small country centres in Australia and for the first time ever will have</p>
<p> a job provider. The Commonwealth employment service is being outperformed</p>
<p> by about 50 per cent by the new Job Network.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>I see. You have said that you wanted to [inaudible] argument about rural</p>
<p> funding. Who's that argument aimed at?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I said I wanted to put my case to the Australian people about whether</p>
<p> it's better to have tens of billions of dollars invested in Telstra.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Right. So that's [inaudible] Telstra argument?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yeah, that's a Telstra argument. I mean, there's no...look,</p>
<p> let us be perfectly clear, we have an obligation as a Government in relation</p>
<p> to particular services and there's a lot we are now doing and there's</p>
<p> even more we are going to do in the future. But the point I am making</p>
<p> is that we could do even more if we had available the money that is now</p>
<p> tied up in a telecommunications company.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Your suggestion that schools remain open for longer hours certainly generated</p>
<p> some talk. You said it wouldn't be appropriate for rural and regional</p>
<p> schools. Why not?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>What I have said is that it's not something that we'd seek</p>
<p> to impose or should be imposed. Look, I can't make it happen, that's</p>
<p> a matter for State governments but I have never seen State Premiers reluctant</p>
<p> to give advice on national issues so occasionally a Prime Minister is</p>
<p> entitled to give some advice or express a view on something that's</p>
<p> the prerogative of the State. I think what you need is flexibility and</p>
<p> I do acknowledge that in country areas that kind of change wouldn't</p>
<p> be as appropriate as it is in some city areas. I am not saying we should</p>
<p> go from a mandate of nine to three or three-thirty, to a mandate of nine</p>
<p> to five. What I am saying is that people should have the flexibility and</p>
<p> that it would make a lot of sense in many city areas if that kind of arrangement</p>
<p> were to be made possible. I don't envisage teachers working longer</p>
<p> hours, in fact, I have in mind there might even be more teachers employed.</p>
<p> They'd work different shifts. We just need more flexibility. We have</p>
<p> our family structures and the working patterns of those families are different</p>
<p> now. That led to a demand for longer shopping hours. What's the difference</p>
<p> in principle. I mean, the old shopping hours were cast at a time when</p>
<p> the norm of a family structure was that you had one breadwinner working</p>
<p> nine to five. That's no longer the case. And that's what led</p>
<p> to the pressure to change the hours.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Yes, there's certainly a need or a desire for longer hours care</p>
<p> before and after school.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, it's not a question of fitting the service to, as it were,</p>
<p> the convenience and the availability of parents. And that's all I</p>
<p> am seeking to do. I am not saying everybody should change. But we have</p>
<p> to have a capacity in this country to kick things like that around without,</p>
<p> sort of, people being pigeonholed and organisations just screaming no,</p>
<p> this is an attempt to conscript me as a childminder or something. In the</p>
<p> end that's not the purpose at all. It's very easy to say that</p>
<p> but we'll never get sensible changes of this kind unless we are prepared</p>
<p> to look at those things.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>But on the other hand cuts by the Federal Government to childcare...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, there haven't...what cuts? We are spending more money on</p>
<p> childcare now than was being spent in 1996. I don't accept there</p>
<p> have been cuts in childcare.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Well, the National Out of School Hours and Services Association is saying</p>
<p> today that cuts have meant that at least 60 services...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I will analyse that. Well, I will get hold of that because I know</p>
<p> for a fact that overall we are spending more on childcare than we were</p>
<p> spending in 1996.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>So you would argue that people haven't suffered changes to childcare</p>
<p> over...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look, I believe the changes that we have made to childcare have been</p>
<p> very fair and reasonable. We have given additional incentives in some</p>
<p> areas, we have reduced, I think, greater equality in some other areas.</p>
<p> There were some areas where certain childcare centres had unfair advantages</p>
<p> over others but if you look at the aggregate spending I don't accept</p>
<p> for a moment that we have cut the aggregate level of spending.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>I saw you on the TV last night at the Allan Border medal ceremony. You</p>
<p> always look so happy when you are with cricketers.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I like cricket, I like cricket.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What is it about the cricket that makes you seem so...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh, it's the cultural thing, it's almost spiritual. I just</p>
<p> like it.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>You are going to be missing a lot of cricket in the next few days, you</p>
<p> must be a bit cranky...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh, no, I had a good opportunity during my three week holiday to see</p>
<p> cricket on television and go and attend a lot and therefore I have got</p>
<p> a job to do. I wanted to go down to Melbourne last night. I flew from</p>
<p> Nyngan to Melbourne and then I have come back to Dubbo this morning to</p>
<p> go to that very important dinner and, of course, a Narromine boy Glenn</p>
<p> McGrath won the award so all the people around here are claiming him.</p>
<p> He's our man, they say.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>You must have been thrilled to be there last night.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It was very enjoyable.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Yes. Now, look, just finally, you have talked about rural Australia and</p>
<p> how it influenced and formed you as a person, the idea of rural Australia.</p>
<p> But in a way is that a bit nostalgic, do we have to look for a new meaning</p>
<p> or a new image of rural Australia to make it survive, make it relevant?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I am not saying that it should never change. What I am saying is</p>
<p> that I can't imagine Australia without some part of its being made</p>
<p> up of the rural inheritance. Now, that's not saying that it never</p>
<p> changes. I mean, rural Australia is changing all the time. I went out</p>
<p> to Bourke yesterday and saw the booming cotton industry now that's</p>
<p> something that wasn't there 10 or 15 years ago. I am not saying that's</p>
<p> nostalgic. Whenever I talk about those sorts of things my critics say,</p>
<p> oh he's being nostalgic. I am stating the truth and that is that</p>
<p> when people think of Australia they think of a number of things and one</p>
<p> of the things they think of is the bush. And what I am saying is I don't</p>
<p> want to lose that. That doesn't mean to say that it's form won't</p>
<p> change, but it's part of it. And we have a social investment and</p>
<p> a national identity investment as well as an economic investment in preserving</p>
<p> it.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Thanks very much for your time today Prime Minister.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>You are very welcome.</p>
