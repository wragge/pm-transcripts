Their Royal Highnesses Crown Prince Frederik and Crown Princess Mary of Denmark will visit Australia from 19 to 26 November as guests of the Australian Government.</p>
<p>I look forward to welcoming the Crown Prince and Princess to Australia. This is their first official visit to Australia since 2005. They also visited together privately in 2006 and 2008.  </p>
<p>I know their visit will be highly anticipated by the people of Australia, giving them a chance to welcome the Crown Prince and Australian-born Crown Princess Mary to our shores once again. </p>
<p>We are very proud of our ties to Denmark.  Their visit is a sign of the strength of the friendship between our two nations.</p>
<p>The Prince and Princess will be leading a business delegation focussed on green energy, sustainable living and food technologies.  </p>
<p>This delegation will provide an opportunity to enhance trade and business ties between our two countries in this important area. Hosted by the Governor-General, their Royal Highnesses will visit Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra. </p>
