PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS NOVEMBER 23, 1S; 75<br />
THE DECISION BY THE MINISTER FOR LABOUR AND IMMIGRATION,<br />
MR. STREETr TO REFUSE A VISA TO A MEMBER OF A PALESTINE<br />
TERRORIST ORGAN ISATION HAS MY FULL ENDORSEMENT AND IS<br />
CONSISTENT WITH THE STAND) TAME BY THE LIBERAL AND NATIONAL<br />
COUNTRY PARTIES.<br />
WE OPPOSED. THE GRANTING OF VISAS TO PLO REPRESENTATIVES<br />
EARLIER THIS YEAR AND WE WILL NOT APPROVE THE SETTING UP<br />
IN AUSTRALIA OF A PLO INFORMATION CENTRE WHILE THE PLO<br />
CONTINUES TO ADVOCATE THE DESTRUCTION OF ISRAEL BY FORCE,<br />
THE INTERIM GOVERNMENT CONDEMNS THE RESOLUTION CARRIED<br />
EARLIER THIS MONTH BY THE UNITED NATIONS.<br />
THIS RESOLUTION INCLUDED ZIONISM IN A CALL FOR INTERNATIONAL<br />
ACTION AGAINST ALL FORM OF RACIAL DISCRIMINATION.<br />
IT WAS DISRUPTIVE AND UNWARRANTED, AN INCITEMENT TO ANTI-SEMITISM<br />
AND A COMPLETE DISTORTION OF FACT.<br />
THE RESOLUTION WAS CONTRARY TO THE SPIRIT OF THE UNIVERSAL<br />
DECLARATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS. IT WAS DESIGNED TO DIVIDE PEOPLE<br />
RATHER THAN UNITE THEM.<br />
THE RESOLUTION WAS PART OF A CAMPAIGN TO DISCREDIT ISRAEL AND<br />
LEAD EVENTUALLY TO ITS EXPULSION* FROM THE UNITED NATIONS. </p>
<p>-2<br />
WE TOTALLY ABHOR THIS CAMPAIGN AND AS A GOVERNMENT OF AN<br />
INFLUENTIAL COUNTRY WE WOULD WORK TO PREVENT RESOLUTIONS<br />
SUCH AS THAT PASSED ON NOVEMBER 10 FROM RECEIVING MAJORITY<br />
SUPPORT AT THE UNITED NATIONS.<br />
ANY SETTLEMENT IN THE MIDDLE EAST MUST ACCEPT THE EXISTENCE<br />
OF ISRAEL.<br />
WHILE THERE IS VIOLENCE IN THE AIR DURING THIS ELECTION WE<br />
WILL NOT ALLOW PERSONS ASSOCIATED WITH VIOLENT ORGANISATIONS<br />
INTO AUSTRALIA. ANY SUCH APPLICATIONS WILL BE DEFERRED SO THAT<br />
THE-GOVERNMENT AFTER DECEMBER 13 CAN MAKE THE PROPER DECISIONS<br />
CONCERNING THEM.<br />
VIOLENCE HAS NOT BEEN PART OF OUR WAY OF LIFE AND PEOPLE WHO<br />
OPENLY ESPOUSE THE USE OF VIOLENCE MURDER AND TERRORISM MUST BE<br />
EXCLUDED FROM AUSTRALIA. </p>
