JUNE, 1965 ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING<br />
ACADEMIC SESSION, OF THE AUSTRALIAN COLLEGE<br />
OF GENERAL PRACTITIONERS, AT WILSON HALL,<br />
UNIVERSITY OF MELBOURNE<br />
ADMISSION OF SIR ROBERT MENZIES AS AN HONORARY<br />
FELLOW OF THE COLLEGE 9th October, 1964.<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon. Sir Robert Menzies<br />
Your Excellency and Sir:<br />
This show3 how wrong one may be, because I came here tonight<br />
saying to myself, ' His Excellency the Governor will make a speech and<br />
I'll be able to pick up a crumb or two, and then my old friend, Sir<br />
Victor Coppleson, he will speak'. Not he, silent as the tomb, and<br />
therefore all that is left for me to do is to say thank you very much,<br />
Sir. I appreciate this honour, and in a strange, odd fashion, you<br />
know, I have rather earned it. Would you mind if I developed that<br />
theory a little?<br />
As you know, in the course of a life of a man like me, one<br />
acquires certain things by merit and other things by favour. I managed<br />
to get a degree or two in this university by working for them<br />
and in later years I have been given a series of unearned honours<br />
which give me the most immense satisfaction. For example, I am a<br />
surgeon. Never let anybody entrust himself to my scalpel, but I am<br />
still a surgeon. Whenever my general practitioner looks at me, or even<br />
my expert specialist consultant who is going to make a speech tonight,<br />
I like to remind them that I am a surgeon and I am also a physician,<br />
and also, you don't think I am boasting-this is a simple narrative of<br />
fact-I am a gynaecologist and obstetrician, though whether as a<br />
patient or a practitioner has never been made quite clear. I seem to<br />
remember that I am an architect, but not responsible for everything you<br />
see. I am a builder, I am an scientist. This is a boasting record, but<br />
I mention it to you firstly to say I didn't earn any of them and, secondly </p>
<p>ANNALS OF GENERAL PRACTICE<br />
to make you understand after all these events that I am now so<br />
superbly qualified to become a general practitioner.<br />
Now, Sir, I have been lucky enough in my life not to encounter<br />
professionally the medical profession too much. I used to have a bit<br />
of fun in a clean way at the bar in my time, cross-examining doctors,<br />
who are very easy to cross-examine, much easier than when you are<br />
their patient, and I haven't been their patient all that much, but I<br />
have lived long enough to have the most tremendous regard for what<br />
goes on in the medical world and I have lived long enough to have<br />
a particular regard for the work done by the general practitioner,<br />
because the general practitioner, as His Excellency said, he is the family<br />
doctor, he is the man you know, he is the man who knows you, knows<br />
the family, who can speak intimately and yet with authority and he is<br />
the rman who, over a long period of time, has been the first diagnostician<br />
when he comes to handle something in the family or in the family<br />
circle. I find it hard to believe, Mr. Chancellor, when I look back on my<br />
time here and on your time here when we who were students of the<br />
law certainly understood that we were much more intelligent than<br />
the medical students, I find it hard to believe how many of these<br />
scamps who were medical students in my time have now become the<br />
most trusted family advisers. And they have, and that proves, of<br />
cour:; e, that it is a jolly good thing to get it out of your system at some<br />
time or another, because I venture to say that there are more<br />
millions of people in Australia who owe a debt to the family doctor<br />
than there are any corresponding number who owe a debt to any other<br />
particular group in the community.<br />
I have been exercised, as I know you have in this College, exercised<br />
about what is going to happen in the future, because in my own<br />
lifetime, which goes back before the turn of the century, all sorts of<br />
astonishing things have happened in the medical world. I have no<br />
doubt that at the time when I was born, the true function of a physician<br />
was to keep his patient quiet and allow nature to take its course.<br />
I have no doubt that not long before I was born and before all the<br />
subtleties of anaesthesia were being got to be understood, surgery was<br />
a chancy thing; in fact, it is only in the memory of some men still<br />
living that antiseptic surgery gave place to aseptic surgery.<br />
It is really an astonishing thing for somebody like me to realise<br />
that in his own lifetime the greatest discoveries affecting mankind<br />
have not been in the field of destruction as some people think, but in<br />
the field of preserving life as more people ought to think. Because<br />
of all these things, the work of the biochemists, the work of the<br />
microbiologists, the extraordinary developments of drugs and techniques<br />
in the specialised fields, it must become increasingly difficult<br />
for a general practitioner whose day begins at any hour of the early<br />
hours of the morning and whose day ends at about the same time.<br />
It must be difficult for him to feel that his tremendous job of dealing </p>
<p>JUNE, 1965<br />
with people in the broad and dealing with people in the particular<br />
has to be performed against a background of knowledge with which<br />
he must feel, occasionally, he is losing touch.<br />
Now this is a problem I think that I, as an outsider, understand,<br />
Do we want general practitioners merely for an instrument for passing<br />
patients on to great specialised experts? I hope not. Or do we want<br />
the trusted family doctor, skilled in understanding, skilled in diagnosis,<br />
to preserve his position by keeping up, in the broad and in the particular,<br />
his knowledge of the new developments in medicine, so there<br />
is not an unbridgeable gulf between what he knows he understands<br />
and what he knows is understood by the most refined specialists in<br />
the medical and surgical world? If I were a family practitioner this is<br />
what I would want to feel. Yes, of course, there are great specialised<br />
experts who know more than I do in their particular field; they ought<br />
to, because I have to cover, at the beginning at least, all fields. But<br />
I do want to believe that every year I know more and more about the<br />
new discoveries, that I am every year becoming competent to understand<br />
these latest developments and to know what it is that my highly<br />
qualified specialist will be talking about.<br />
This is tremendously true. We are not having a great gulf between<br />
the specialist and the general practitioner, because if we do, the<br />
general practitioner will begin to feel more and more that he merely<br />
begins something and that the skill, the expertise, must belong to<br />
other people. If I were a specialist in some branch of medicine, I<br />
would want to know that general practitioners every year knew more<br />
and more about the kind of thing that I was concerned with, and<br />
I am sure that the general practitioners would want that too.<br />
That means, as I understand it, the reason that this College.<br />
has been established-I heard about this before it was established.<br />
My own family doctor used to address me very earnestly on. this sub-.<br />
ject when he had me at what you understand to be a disadvantage,<br />
and even from the beginning, I can see quite clearly that a College<br />
of General Practitioners, which is going to include within its scope<br />
educational work, refresher courses, lectures and practice in matters<br />
which are new, is going to do something even more tremendous for<br />
the whole body of medical knowledge and of practice, and so Sir,<br />
surgeon though I may be, I think this is one of the great moments of<br />
my life. I have been a general practitioner in other fields for a long<br />
time. It is a very great honour to become a general practitioner<br />
in the field of medicine. </p>
<p>ANNALS OF GENERAL PRACTICE<br />
A SURVEY OF ACUTE RESPIRATORY ILLNESS<br />
by ALAN H. B. CHANCELLOR, Metrylands, N. S. W.<br />
Acute inflammations of the respiratory passages are very common<br />
ailments in the general population. The cause of these disorders is<br />
uncerlin and although surveys have been conducted on many groups<br />
there has been little study made of such unselected patients as voluntarily<br />
consult a general practitioner. An attempt has therefore been<br />
made to isolate viruses and bacteria from all patients seeking treatment<br />
for symptoms of up to seven days duration, referable to the respiratory<br />
system. The Institute of Clinical Pathology and Medical Research at Lidcombe<br />
N. S. W. has co-operated willingly in doing this laboratory work.<br />
Patients were studied during two periods, from 4th November,<br />
1963 to 20th December, 1963 and from 2nd May, 1964 to 4th<br />
August, 1964. The study was carried out by one member of a group<br />
of seven general practitioners and the patients were the only ones<br />
to exercise a choice of which doctor they would see, apart from<br />
ccout of hours" periods. Type of Disorder<br />
( f the 218 patients studied, 2 were suffering from bronchitis<br />
and 19 had a wheeze without any other evidence of bronchitis. The<br />
remainder had upper respiratory signs only.<br />
Age distribution<br />
The age distribution of the studied group and the observer's<br />
patients in general ( calculated from the ages of 2147 different patients<br />
seeking treatment between November 1963 and June 1964) is shown<br />
in Table I. Table 1.<br />
Age distribution of patients. Shown as of total of each group.<br />
Age in years 0-9 10-19 ' 20-29 30-39 40-49 50-59 60-69 70<br />

Collections<br />
Samples were taken in the consulting rooms or in the patients'<br />
homes. A swab for bacteriological examination was placed in either<br />
a glas; s tube or a plastic envelope and then a throat gargle was obtained<br />
and returned to a McCartney bottle. These two samples were placed<br />
immediately in a refrigerator or into a vacuum flask with ice and stored<br />
thus until delivered to the laboratory. Patients who were unable to<br />
garglie had a second swab taken which was then broken off into a tube<br />
of transport fluid and shaken before being placed on ice. </p>
