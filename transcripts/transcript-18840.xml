    <content><![CDATA[<p>Bali, Indonesia</p>
<p>CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY</p>
<p>Today, we gather to commemorate the worst terrorist attack our nation has ever known.</p>
<p>88 Australians died here. And they did not die alone.</p>
<p>38 Indonesians died with them.</p>
<p>In all, 202 lives were lost and more than 200 were injured.</p>
<p>The bodies of the dead and the living bore wounds more often seen in wartime.</p>
<p>But these were not soldiers.</p>
<p>Our fellow Australians  -  those lost, those hurt  -  were doing nothing more than seeking a few carefree days amid full and busy lives.</p>
<p>They had come to a place loved for its sunshine and uncomplicated joy.</p>
<p>A place, like London and Gallipoli, where something of the Australian spirit dwells upon another shore.</p>
<p>This is what the Bali bombers struck at here.</p>
<p>On September 11, terrorists attacked the great symbols of American prestige.</p>
<p>Here in Bali, they attacked our people and through them, sought to overwhelm our values.</p>
<p>Here on these bustling streets, they inflicted searing pain and grief that will never end.</p>
<p>But even as the debris fell, it was obvious the attack on our sense of ourselves  -  as Australians, as human beings - had failed.</p>
<p>Rescuers ran towards the terror.</p>
<p>Volunteers extended their hands by the hundred, Indonesians and Australian alike.</p>
<p>A remarkable medical rescue effort swung into place.</p>
<p>A thorough policing effort methodically dismantled the terrorist network responsible.</p>
<p>And our two countries drew closer than we ever had before.</p>
<p>Amid the horror, it was a time for heroes. Like Peter Hughes and Jason McCartney, victims who became rescuers.</p>
<p>Like the Sanglah Hospital staff who provided frontline care in those first critical hours.</p>
<p>Or Len Notaras, Fiona Wood and their colleagues who were angels of healing back at home.</p>
<p>It was a time for leaders too.</p>
<p>President Megawati and then Minister Yudhoyono were quick to embrace international cooperation and a decisive security response.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Howard was a steadfast, reassuring voice for Australians in those dramatic days, and it is very fitting that he is here today.</p>
<p>Police Inspector General Pastika and Commissioner Keelty gave us confidence that justice would be done.</p>
<p>Ten years later and we witness today another sort of courage: the courage it has taken for the survivors and families to make this pilgrimage.</p>
<p>The physical journey by plane has been easy but the inner journey is wrenchingly hard.</p>
<p>This is a day of contesting emotions, from anger and unamended loss to forgiveness and reconciliation with a bitter past.</p>
<p>Wounds and scars abound, healed and unhealed.</p>
<p>But nothing can replace the empty seat at your family table.</p>
<p>The graduations and christenings you will never know.</p>
<p>And the fault line that will always divide your lives into two halves: âbeforeâ and âafterâ Bali.</p>
<p>There are, at least, some fragments of comfort on this day of recollection and return.</p>
<p>There is peace in this island, and the knowledge that millions still come here for the same reasons you and your loved ones did.</p>
<p>And perhaps there is a grim reassurance in knowing that the terrorists did not achieve what they set out to do.</p>
<p>They did not undermine Indonesian democracy, which has only grown stronger across the passage of a decade.</p>
<p>And though our vigilance is greater, we have not surrendered the freedoms that brought us here in the first place.</p>
<p>We were hurt and so were our friends, but we did not falter.</p>
<p>Instead, we endured and found strength in each other.</p>
<p>With that strength, we embrace those who suffered in Bali and lost so much.</p>
<p>With that strength, we affirm the endurance of our ideals.</p>
<p>Because in the end, terror is not beaten by policing or force of arms alone.</p>
<p>We prevail because we have a better way.</p>
<p>We prevail because our beliefs endure.</p>
<p>Terrorists have killed and maimed thousands around the world.</p>
<p>But they will never sunder or displace a single ideal.</p>
<p>So today we return here in remembrance, but we also gather in quiet defiance.</p>
<p>We will never forget all that we lost.</p>
<p>We will hold fast to that which remains:</p>
<p>To our determination as a free people to explore the world unbowed by fear; to our resolve to defeat terrorism; and to our duty to care for each other. </p>
