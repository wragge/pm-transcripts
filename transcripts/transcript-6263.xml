PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 15 NOVEMBER 1983<br />
Today's statement by the Chairman of Citicorp Australia,<br />
Mr Richard Jackson, that the transfer of the title of the<br />
Uluru National Park to the traditional. aboriginal owners<br />
shoula not ci::&amp; ine-he' underlying security arrangements for<br />
foreign loans for the project is welcomed by the Federal<br />
Government. The Government particularly notes that Citicorp and the other<br />
banks are still working toward the original deadline of<br />
November 24 for signinq the international syndicated term facility.<br />
Citicorp's statement exposes the cynical attitude of the<br />
Chief Minister, Mr Everingham, in calling an election eight<br />
months ahead of schedule.<br />
Mr Everingham should now publicly apologise for his scare<br />
mongering tactics yesterday when he claimed the decision to<br />
transfer the title would-have an adverse affect on investment<br />
in the $ 150 million Yulara Tourist projlect.<br />
So that even Mr Everingham can understand, let me repeat<br />
my statement of last Frida that: the Ayers Rock area will be<br />
available for the use and enjoyment of all Australians<br />
and the many thousands of visitors from overseas who travel<br />
to the National Park every year. </p>
