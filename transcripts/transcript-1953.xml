FOR PRESS: P. M. No. 90/ 1968<br />
TASMANIAN DROUGHT RELIEF<br />
Following is the text of a telegram sent by the Prime<br />
Minister this evening to the Premier of Tasmania ( Mr. E. E. Reece):-<br />
" YOUR LETTER OF 22 OCTOBER RE SEASONAL CONDITIONS<br />
TASMANIAN EAST COAST. WE ARE PREPARED TO ACCEPT<br />
THAT THE CONDITIONS, IF REQUIRING RELIEF LOANS OF<br />
$ 1 MILLION FOR DROUGHT AFFECTED FARMERS, WOULD<br />
CALL FOR COMMONWEALTH ASSISTANCE. YOU WILL<br />
UNDERSTA ND THAT COMMONWEALTH WOULD NOT BE<br />
EXPECTED TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE IF SUBSTANTIAL<br />
RELIEF EXPENDITURES ARE NOT INVOLVED. IF YOU<br />
DECIDE TO PROCEED WITH A SCHEME OF RELIEF LOANS<br />
ON TERMS NO MORE LIBERAL THAN THOSE ADOPTED UNDER<br />
THE DROUGHT ASSISTANCE ARRANGEMENTS INSTITUTED<br />
BY THE OTHER STATES, THF, COMMONWEALTH WOULD<br />
THEN BE PREPARED TO MAKE AVAILABLE FINANCE ON<br />
THE FOLLOWING CONUYTIONS. ANY COMMONWEALTH<br />
CONTRIBUTION WOULD TAKE THE FORM OF INTEREST-FREE<br />
ADVANCES REPAYABLE OVER EIGHT YEARS. TO PRESERVE<br />
CONSISTENCY WITH THE RELIEF LOANS PROVIDED BY OTHER<br />
STATES, THE RELIEF LOANS WOULD NEED TO BE KEPT<br />
WITHIN THE FOLLOWING PATTERN<br />
THEY WOULD BE AVAILABLE ONLY TO DROUGHT<br />
AFFECTED FARMERS WHO CANNOT OBTAIN<br />
CREDIT THROUGH NORMAL COMMERCIAL CHANNELS.<br />
INTEREST WOULD BE CHARGED AT A MINIMUM<br />
OF 3 PER CENT PER ANNUM.<br />
OTHER TERMS AND CONDITIONS WCULD BE<br />
SIMILAR TO THOSE WHICH HAVE OBTAINED IN<br />
STATES SUCH AS NEW SOUTH WALES AND<br />
QUEENSLAND.<br />
THE GRANTS COMMISSION WOULD NOT BE ASKED TO<br />
MAKE AN ADVERSE " MODIFICATION" IN RESPECT OF INTEREST<br />
" LOSSES" AND ADMINISTRATION COSTS WHICH WOULD BE<br />
INVOLVED IN A NEW SCHEME ALONG THE LINES MENTIONED.<br />
THE UNSPENT FUNDS TC WHICH I HAVE REFERRED ARE THE<br />
BALANCE OF $ 288, 000 HELD BY YOUR STATE UNDER THE LOAN<br />
( FARMERS' DEBT ADJUSTMENT) ACT.<br />
AS YOU WILL BE AWARE THESE BALANCES MAY ONLY BE USED<br />
BY THE STATE IN ACCORDANCE WITH PURPOSES SPECIFIED<br />
UNDER THE COMMONWEALTH ACT. THE COMMONWEALTH<br />
EXPECTS YOU TO USE THIS $ 288, 000 AND WOULD CONSIDER ANY<br />
REQUEST BY YOU TO FACILITATE THIS.<br />
COMMONWEALTH ASSISTANCE WOULD BE ON A FOR BASIS<br />
FOR YOUR TOTAL EXPENDITURE. J. G. GORTON."<br />
