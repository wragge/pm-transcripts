    <content><![CDATA[<p>FOR PRESS:~ PM. No. 123/ 1966</p>
<p>THE RHODESIAN SITUATION</p>
<p>Comment by the -Prime Minister, Mr. Harold Holt<br />Fromthe outset, the Australian Government has held the<br />view that the resolving of the problems which have arisen between the United<br />Kingdom and Rhodesia was primarily the responsibility of the Government of<br />the United Kingdom. Although constitutionally Rhodesia has been and<br />remains at law a colony of the United Kingdom, there had been a special<br />relationship between them. Rhodesia had, in practice, enjoyed a large<br />measure of self-government in the conduct of its affairs. Indeed, for many<br />years the then Prime Minister of Rhodesia had attended regularly conferences<br />of Prime Ministers. It is understandable, therefore, that Rhodesia should<br />have sought independence in a period when many parts of the British Empire<br />with much less experience of handling their own affairs had moved into that<br />status. The crucial difference between Rhodesia and most other<br />African territories is the racial composition of the population. As is well<br />known, Rhodesia is composed of a comparatively small white minority of<br />about 225, CCC a considerable number of whom are of British stock and<br />some four million Africans, many of whom are not native to Rhodesia but have<br />been attracted to residence there by the employment opportunities offered by<br />a growing and prospering economy.<br />Protracted negotiations for a mutually acceptable basis for<br />independence were unsuccessful. An outcome was the declaration by the then<br />Government of Rhodesia, led by Mr. Smith as Prime Minister, of the UDI<br />( Unilateral Declaration of Independence). This action was agreed by the<br />United Kingdom and other Commonwealth Governments to be illegal, and the<br />Smith regime has since been regarded as an illegal regime with no<br />constitutional status recognised by the United Kingdom, and the course of<br />action followed by that regime from that time onwards has been branded by<br />the Government of the United Kingdom as a rebellion. No Commonwealth<br />country has " recognised" the Smith regime; indeed no country in the world<br />has recognised it. When the United Kingdom Government, in an attempt to<br />restore a situation of legality, imposed economic sanctions on Rhodesia and<br />requested other Commonwealth countries to do so also, they unanimously<br />joined in that process. Successive Conferences of Prime Ministers have condemned<br />the illegality and have considered courses of action which would assure the<br />democratic rights and opportunities of the African majority in the country.<br />At the most recent of these Conferences, held in September of this year, it<br />was agreed that should further negotiations fail to produce an acceptable<br />solution, an approach should be made by the United Kingdom to the United<br />Nations for the application of selected mandatory sanctions.<br />The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Mr. Wilson made<br />a final attempt at negotiation when at his invitation Mr. Smith met him on<br />board HMS " Tiger". A document embodying a basis of settlement which<br />Mr. Smith initialled was taken by Mr. Smith and Mr. W.-ilson to their<br />respective colleagues for their consideration. The United Kingdom Government<br />gave prompt approval, but the terms were rejected by the Smith regime. / 2</p>
<p>2-<br />As I understand the -position. from public-statements made by<br />Mr. Smith, the-Rhodes ian regim-e was prepared to accept constitutional<br />arrangements which embodied the " six principles".<br />The United Kingdom Government has consistently and firmly<br />asserted that acceptance of these principles is essential and fundamental<br />to a grant of independence by the Parliament of the United Kingdom. On<br />Mr. Smith's assertion, what proved unacceptable were the terms proposed<br />for what has been described as " the return to legality" But these, in the eyes<br />of the British Government, are critically import ant in themselves owing to<br />the need for a free and fair test of Rhodesian opinion about the future<br />constitution. The Australan G overnment was deeply disappointed that the<br />negotiations did not produce a mutually acceptable solution, but acceptance<br />ibtys eblof. t h sMidre. s Wofl ials ocno, nswtihtou thioanda ol ubtlaisreis d wthoeu ldc obned iat iosnusb sotaf nat iraelt uarcnh ietov elmegeanlti tyi. n<br />to Commonwealth Prime Ministers, felt bound, of course, to adhere to the<br />substance of these. Any significant departure from them would represent,<br />in his eyes, a breach of his Ludertakings to his Commonwealth colleagues.<br />He could only do so, In good faith, with their concurrence.<br />The United Kingdom Government, understandably, as part of<br />the process of return to legality, requires the Rhodesian regime to submit<br />to the Governor and makes conditi ons regarding the legal basis for control<br />of the armed forces. It requires also a broadening of the representation<br />in any Government subsequently appointed. Mr. Smith is reported as finding<br />grave objections of principle in these courses.<br />Faced with the tragic consequences which must flow from a<br />continuing and rigorous application of sanctions by members of the United<br />Nations, we would still hope that solutions could be found as to the procedures<br />to apply over an interim period. The whole future of Rhodesia and its people<br />is at stake. The welfare, the happiness and prosperity of nearly four and<br />a half million people are directly involvwd. If the economy of Rhodesia is<br />shatt ered, over four million Africans suffer grave hardship as well as the<br />white minority. The burden of economic rec-onstruction will fall heavily on<br />the United Kingdom, in particular, and, in varying degree, on those Commonwealth<br />countries willing and able to lend assistance. No one can foretell the<br />disastrous extent of the consequences nor the ramifications, poisoning and<br />embittering African relations and damaging indefinitely as to time and degree,<br />the future of the whole of Southern Africa.<br />The Australian Government has been gravely troubled by these<br />developments. Wie have given our support to the United Kirqdom Government<br />in its determined efforts to find a just solution. Restrictions operate over<br />virtually all of our imports from Rhodesia, and our trade with that country<br />is currently limited almost entirely to foodstuffs necessary for the African<br />majority as well as the largely European minority. We have already been<br />applying voluntarily the sanctions now made mandatory by the Security<br />Council, Nie have been kept fully informed by the United Kingdom Government<br />of the various developments as they have occurred. / 3</p>
<p>-3-<br />ro11owlnghe rejection of proposal-s emanating from the HMS<br />" Tiger" discussions, 1I-meceived ashort-cable purporting to come from Mr.<br />Howman, who is described by-the-Smith regime as " Minister for Information,<br />in which he made an explanation from the Rhodesian side of the failure of the<br />" Tiger" talks and went on to say that Mr. Smith would be ready to meet me at<br />any time and any place for discussiLon. In keeping with the consistent attitude<br />of non-recognition which the Australian Government has maintained during the<br />relevant period of office of my predecessor, Sir Robert Menzies, and throughoit.<br />my own time as Prime Minister, I made no acknowledgment of this message.<br />There were, however, references to it in a section of the Australian press<br />which appear to have been dervied from the self-styled " Rhodesian Information<br />Service" in Australia. I made the contents of this cable known to the British<br />High Commissioner in Australia for transmission to his Prime Minister.<br />On 14th December, I received a cable in code purporting to come<br />from Mr. Smith himself, in which he invited me to send a fact-finding mission<br />to Rhodesia to report to me on the position in that country. The substance of<br />this was also conveyed by me to the British High Commissioner after consideration<br />had been given to both cables by the Australian Cabinet.<br />Press reports emanating from Salisbury over the weekend are to<br />the effect that Mr. Smith has cabled the Australian and New Zealand Prime<br />Ministers inviting them to nominate members to a commission to test Rhodesian<br />public opinion on constitutional proposals. The same reports state that Mr.<br />Smith's Cabinet had announced it could accept the proposed changes, but not<br />the British demands for the manner of implementing them.<br />At the Prime Ministers' Conference, I had stated my resErvation<br />on the proposal than an application should be made to the United Nations. I<br />then expressed the view that this matter should be capable of solution inside the<br />Commonwealth of Nations, and that we should pursue means of achieving this.<br />However, in the event of failure of negotiations, I concurred on behalf of<br />Australia in supporting a move to the Security Council for mandatory selective<br />sanctions. My Government regards the proposal that Australia and New Zealand<br />should join in a commission which, on the face of it, is confined to those two<br />countries, as disturbingly unrealistic. Any finding from such a restricted<br />Commonwealth representation would be most unlikely to find acceptance from<br />the Commonwealth as a whole, and, in any event, we could not contemplace such<br />a course without the full knowledge and approval of the Government of the United<br />Kingdom. The terms of reference of any commission would also need careful<br />thought. But we must not lose sight of the fact that sanctions are not an end<br />in themselves. They have been imposed with a purpose, and that purpose is<br />to lead the Rhodesians to come to terms with the United Kingdom so as to open<br />the way to constitutional advance towards majority rule with full guarantee<br />for both the majority and minority communites.<br />Australia will remain in constant touch with the Governments of the<br />United Kingdom and other Commonwealth co-intries in the hope that a solution<br />can still be found.<br />CANBERRA, 2Cth December, 1966</p>
