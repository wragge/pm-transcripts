    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Commonwealth Government will invest $200 million each year to establish a new <em>Australian Apprenticeship Support Network</em> to lift apprenticeship completion rates.</p>
<p>The <em>Australian Apprenticeship Support Network</em> will give young Australians the best opportunity to get a job and provide employers with the skilled and productive employees they need to grow their business.</p>
<p>Apprentices will be assisted to find an employer to begin their apprenticeship and receive mentoring through to the successful completion of their apprenticeship.</p>
<p>Apprentices will be able to access career advice with dedicated support outside their workplace throughout their apprenticeship.</p>
<p>The new <em>Australian Apprenticeship Support Network</em> will also undertake community employment outreach by working with employers, industry groups and local chambers of commerce to identify job opportunities and employer skills needs.</p>
<p>The new Network will provide a one-stop-shop for employers, particularly small business, looking to hire a new apprentice suited to their business.</p>
<p>The Government is answering the call of employers, industry groups and feedback from apprentices to improve the current system which has been in place since the 1990s.</p>
<p>The current system is largely administrative â processing paperwork for contract sign-ups and administrative compliance for employers, state and Commonwealth departments â without the appropriate support that apprentices and employers need.</p>
<p>There is too much red tape, with apprenticeship centres spending more than half their time filling out paperwork.</p>
<p>The true success of the VET sector must be measured in how well it connects skilled workers to real jobs, not how much paperwork is completed.</p>
<p>The Governmentâs new streamlined and effective system will replace the unwieldy and overly bureaucratic system that has become bogged down in red tape.</p>
<p>The Australian Apprenticeship Support Network will:</p>
<ul><li>connect apprentices and employers through targeted job-matching;</li>
<li>provide advice about different course options and training delivery options;</li>
<li>deliver personalised mentoring and support to apprentices;</li>
<li>provide advice to businesses taking on apprentices, including their roles and responsibilities; manage the administration of an apprenticeship including the training contract;</li>
<li>and administer the Australian Apprenticeships Incentives Program including employer incentives and trade support loans.</li>
</ul><p>Apprenticeship completion rates are currently around 50 per cent. To lift completion rates the Government is delivering the reforms and support apprentices and employers need.</p>
<p>The Government has already introduced new Trade Support Loans offering up to $20,000 over the life of an apprenticeship to encourage more young Australians to start their career with an apprenticeship and complete their qualification.</p>
<p>The new loans are spread over four years and provide greater assistance by easing the financial burden in the early years of an apprenticeship when the apprenticeâs income is often lower.</p>
<p>The new Network will commence from 1 July 2015 and will make it much easier for employers to recruit, train and retain apprentices and trainees.</p>
<p>Apprentices and businesses will be able to access the <em>Australian Apprenticeship Support Networkâs</em> services at no cost.Â </p>
