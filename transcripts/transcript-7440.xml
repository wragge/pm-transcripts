PRIME MINISTER<br />
CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
OPENING OF THE ' ANCIENT MACEDONIA' EXHIBITION<br />
MELBOURNE 24 NOVEMBER 1988<br />
Your Excellency,<br />
Distinguished Guests,<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen.<br />
I am delighted to welcome to Australia during our<br />
Bicentennial year the exhibition ' Ancient Macedonia,.<br />
The ancient civilisation of Macedonia has bequeathed to the<br />
world a magnificent store of artifacts some of them royal<br />
works of art; some of them humble objects of daily life; all<br />
of them items-of ancient and endurin . g beauty.<br />
It is a remarkable fact that those skilled artisans of<br />
Macedonia, who expressed their view of the world through<br />
their art, did so with such eloquence that we can admire and<br />
appreciate their work today more than twenty centuries<br />
later.<br />
This exhibition provides a clear window into the Macedonian<br />
civilisation a civilisation which, as this exhibition<br />
makes clear, valued the freedom of the human spirit and<br />
emphasised the qualities of restraint, balance and serenity.<br />
These truly are the qualities which describe a civilisation<br />
as classical. Classicism is important not only for the<br />
values and ideas it then espoused, but also for the spirit<br />
which it bequeathed to us and which it coentinues to evoke in<br />
us today.<br />
The exhibition includes object s from the royal tombs of<br />
Vergina, among them the priceless golden myrtle wreath from<br />
the tomb of King Philip II. This is one of the finest<br />
treasures from that high point of. Macedonian culture.<br />
The discoveries at Vergina and Derveni in 1977 created world<br />
wide attention, but this exhibition includes objects from<br />
some forty sites evidence of the richness of the culture<br />
which flourished in ancient Macedonia. I am proud to recall<br />
that Australian archaeologists assisted with excavations at<br />
a number of these sites. Th vat th<br />

There are nearly 500 objects on display, and they include a huge<br />
variety of objects. It is one of the charms of this exhibition<br />
that domestic objects such as bane pins-and clay spindles sit<br />
beside royal treasures such as silver vessels and golden wreaths<br />
of the finest and most sophisticated craftsmanship.<br />
Some of these items have been discovered only in the past year.<br />
It is an honour that Australia is the first country outside<br />
Greece to have the opportunity to see them. others, like the<br />
myrtle wreath, are so prized that they will never leave Greece<br />
again. I thank you, M. r President, on behalf of all Australians, for the<br />
privilege of seeing this magnificent exhibition in Australia.<br />
Your generosity in sending us the largest exhibition of<br />
Macedonian antiquities ever to leave Greece truly reflects the<br />
warmth of the friendship between our peoples.<br />
Australia's cultural heritage is rich and diverse. Australia is<br />
a proudly multicultural nation, enriched by the work of people<br />
who have come from more than 130 countries to make Australia<br />
their new home. Among them, Greek-Australians have made an<br />
outstanding contribution to Australian society in many fields.<br />
Through the Greek-Australian community, Australia is linked to<br />
the great classical civilisations represented by ' Ancient<br />
Macedonia'. And through the sister city relations6hij between Melbourne and<br />
Thessaloniki our people continue to value this historic and<br />
continuing cultural link.<br />
The spirit of ancient Macedonia is reki ndled by this exhibition<br />
for it reminds us of the great heritage we share; a heritage<br />
which now belongs to the world.<br />
I would like to think that those great Kings, Philip and his son<br />
Alexander the Great, would approve'of this exhibition because it<br />
celebrates their culture in yet another nation. The exhibition<br />
will provide many thousands of Australians with a chance to<br />
experience that culture and will, I have no doubt, leave them<br />
greatly enriched.<br />
I thank all who have helped to bring this exhibition-to fruition<br />
the Government of Greece, especially the Directorate of<br />
Antiquities in the ministry of Culture; the Australian<br />
Bicentennial Authority which has helped to fund the exhibition;<br />
sponsors OTC, Olympic Airways and Australian Airlines; the<br />
International Cultural Corporation of Australia; and not least<br />
the Director of this Museum, Mr Bob Edwards, and his staff who<br />
have put this very large and complex exhibition together in just<br />
a few short weeks surely something of a record.<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen,<br />
it is now my pleasure to invite President Sartzetakis to declare<br />
open this exhibition. 3763 </p>
