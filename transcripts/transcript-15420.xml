    <content><![CDATA[<p>It gives me great pleasure to announce the outcome of Round 2 of funding under the National School Chaplaincy Program and additional funding of $50 million for the program. </p>
<p>Due to the further overwhelming response of schools to Round 2 of the program I have decided to allocate extra funding, bringing the total funding under the program to $165 million over three years. </p>
<p>This funding enables the Australian Government to provide chaplaincy grants worth $69.2 million to a further 1,238 schools in Round Two. Of the schools that were successful in obtaining funding under this round, 829 are government schools and 409 are non-government schools.  A summary of the successful applications by state and sector under both funding rounds is attached. </p>
<p>The additional funding announced today will also provide funds to some chaplaincy providers to ensure that are able to respond to this unprecedented demand from schools.</p>
<p>In total more than 2,630 or 27% of schools around Australia have been awarded grants under this program.  This demonstrates a real desire for pastoral care and spiritual guidance in Australian schools. I would like to congratulate all the schools that have been successful in obtaining funding through this program.</p>
