) AUTRLIA&amp; g<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 2 July 1978<br />
ROYAL VISITS<br />
Visits to Australia by Princess Alexandra and her husband<br />
Mr Angus Ogilvy and by The Duke and Duchess of Gloucester<br />
were announced in Canberra on 13 June by Mr Anthony when<br />
acting as Prime Minister during my absence overseas.<br />
At that time he stated that the dates for the visits and the<br />
States to be included in their itineraries would be announced<br />
as soon as practicable.<br />
I aim pleased now to say that these dates and the itineraries<br />
have been detL-ermined.<br />
Princess Alexandra has agreed to the following itinerary for<br />
her visit frocD Wednesday 20 September to Tuesday 3 October:<br />
Wed. 20 to Fri. 22 Sep. Canberra<br />
Fri. 22 to Tue. 26 Victoria<br />
Tue. 26 to Thu. 28 New South Wales<br />
Thu. 28 to Mon. 2 Oct. Queensland<br />
The itinerary which The Duke and Duchess of Gloucester will<br />
undertake during their visit from Saturday 3 to Sunday 18<br />
February is as follows:<br />
Sat. 3 to Wed. 7 Feb. Canberra<br />
Wed. 7 to Fri. 9 Tasmania<br />
Fri. 9 to Mon 12 South Australia<br />
Mon. 12 to Thu. 15 Victoria<br />
Thu. 15 to Sun. 18 New South Wales.<br />
Princess Alexandra has accepted an invitation to be in Melbourne<br />
on Saturday 23 September to open the annual Show of the Royal<br />
Agricultural Society of Victoria.<br />
The Duke of Gloucester is Grand Prior of the Most Venerable<br />
Order of the Hospital of St. John of Jerusalem. He and The<br />
Duchess of Gloucester after their program of official engagements<br />
plan to remain in Australia for a private holiday of about two<br />
weeks. Consultations will take place between Commonwealth and State<br />
authorities to prepare programs of engagements for both visits.<br />
Those details will be announced when approvals have been obtained. / 2 </p>

An itinerary for the visit by The Prince of Wales in March 1979<br />
in connection with the sesquicentenary celebrations of the State<br />
of Western Australia has yet to be decided.<br />
When Prince Charles was here in November 1977 as Patron of The<br />
Queen's Silver Jubilee Appeal for Young Australians, his program<br />
included engagements in each of the States, in Canberra and in<br />
the Northern Territory. His itinerary next year could be<br />
expected therefore to concentrate primarily on engagements<br />
in Western Australia. </p>
