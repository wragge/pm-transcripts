PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
REPORT OF THE CENTENARY OF FEDERATION ADVISORY<br />
COMMITTEE I have received the report of the Centenary of Federation Advisory<br />
Committee, 2001: A Report from Australia.<br />
Premiers and Chief Ministers have also received the Committee's report,<br />
which was launched today by the Chairperson, Joan Kimer.<br />
The Council of Australian Governments ( COAG) agreed last year to establish<br />
a broadly based committee to advise it on goals and strategies for the<br />
centenary of federation in 2001.<br />
COAG decided that the Committee should comprise representatives of each<br />
State and Territory, a Commonwealth appointed Chairperson and such<br />
further persons, appointed by the Commonwealth, as might be needed to<br />
ensure that the Committee as a whole was broadly representative of the<br />
community. The report provides the basis for public debate, consideration by COAG and<br />
consideration by Individual governments on how best to commemorate the<br />
centenary of federation.<br />
Importantly, the report represents the results of a consultative process in<br />
which the Committee has visited all regions of Australia and held wideranging<br />
discussions with governments, with local authorities and community<br />
representatives. It canvasses a range of proposals to help Australians understand the<br />
meaning of the centenary of federation, to celebrate our achievements as a<br />
nation since federation, to strengthen our national identity and celebrate our<br />
diversity as a people.<br />
In addition, the report discusses a number of social, economic and<br />
environmental projects of national significance. </p>
<p>2<br />
COAG and Individual governments will now study the report carefully.<br />
The commemoration of the centenary of federation, and the events leading<br />
up to it, provide an opportunity for all Australians to celebrate the<br />
achievements of the first hundred years of federation and to reflect on the<br />
challenges facing our nation as we approach the 21st century. I hope the<br />
entire community will participate whole-heartedly in it.<br />
I would like to commend Joan Kirner and her colleagues on the Committee<br />
for their work and to thank them for the energy and commitment they have<br />
brought to their task.<br />
