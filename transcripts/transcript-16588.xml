    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Australian Government strongly condemns today's apparent nuclear test by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and reports of a missile test shortly afterwards.</p>
<p>We join with our partners in the region  -  particularly Japan, the Republic of Korea and the United States  -  in taking a firm stand against the DPRK's behaviour.</p>
<p>We are deeply concerned by these latest provocative acts which breach United Nations Security Council Resolution 1718.</p>
<p>We join with our partners in calling for quick and resolute action by the United Nations Security Council in response to the DPRK's acts.</p>
<p>We urge the DPRK to cease its provocative and destabilising acts and work constructively through the Six-Party Talks process to resolve the challenges on the Korean peninsula.</p>
<p>Australia is a strong supporter of the Six-Party Talks and will continue to work closely with member countries to encourage the DPRK to denuclearise and abandon its ballistic missile program.</p>
