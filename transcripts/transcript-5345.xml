FOR MEDIA MONDAY,' MAY 5 1980<br />
DEATH OF PRESIDENT TITO<br />
The Government has learned with sadness of the death of<br />
President Tito of Yugoslavia. On behalf of the Government of<br />
Australia and Australians generally, I extend our deep sympathy<br />
to the people of Yugoslavia at this time. We appreciate the<br />
very special nature of the loss that President Tito's death<br />
will mean to them.<br />
President T-ito led his country tirelessly for 35 years and can<br />
be described without exaggeration as the architect of modern<br />
Yugoslavia. At home he secured the unity and support of the country after<br />
the turbulent years of World War II. President Tito's courage<br />
and success in preserving Yugoslavia's independence provided<br />
an example to many, not least to the forces of national<br />
independence which existed elsewhere in Eastern Europe.<br />
In 1943 when the Soviet Union assumed that Yugoslavia could be<br />
absorbed into the then monolithic Soviet bloc, it was<br />
President Tito's successful defiance which preserved his country's<br />
independence. Subsequently he was a staunch critic of the Soviet<br />
invasion of Hungary and Czechoslovakia and more recently of the<br />
Soviet-backed Vietnamese invasion of Kamnpuchea.<br />
By these actions and by his championing of the original principles<br />
of the non-aligned movement, Yugoslavia stands today as a firmly<br />
united and resourceful country fiercely committed to the defence<br />
of its independence and integrity.<br />
Yugoslavia's independence has assumed even greater significance<br />
since the Soviet invasion and occupation of Afghanistan an act<br />
which has shown that the threat of external subjugation is stil1l<br />
very prevalent today as it was when President Tito confronted<br />
it in 1948.<br />
It is thus all the more important that countries make clear<br />
their attachment to Yugoslavia's independence and their firm<br />
hope that Yugoslavia %.. ill continue unimpeded on that same<br />
independent path. Australia for its part unequivocally joins<br />
in that support. </p>
