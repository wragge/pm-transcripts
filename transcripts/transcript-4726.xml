PRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT 29 May 1978<br />
INTERVIEW WITH PETER HARVEY ON CENSURE MOTION IN PARLIAMENT<br />
QUESTION: Prime Minister, the sort of censure motion that was<br />
moved on you yesterday by Mr Hayden. How do you reply to that<br />
sort of criticism?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I think the criticism really answers itself.<br />
It shows the concerns of the Opposition they've asked a very<br />
large number oZE questions over the course of this Parliament<br />
about issues that I believe had been passed and done with,<br />
not in the mainstream of concerns-of the Australian nation<br />
and of the Australian people. I think this is why they have<br />
been put aside by the Austrdlian people, and I think it's<br />
why they have lost enormous support amongst the working men<br />
and women. of Australia. When I first came to this Parliament<br />
and that't beginning to be,. in spite of my age, quite a long<br />
while ago, there were a large number of trade union officials<br />
in the Parliament. People had been through the ranks, through<br />
the trade unions, worked on the shop floor. Many of them had<br />
known what it was like in the 1930' s and the difficulties<br />
of those times, and they were men that I have a very great<br />
respect for. But the Australian Labor. Party today is a different<br />
party, it doesn't really identify with that kind of person,<br />
the person that's come up through the ranks of the trade union.<br />
Clyde Cameron might always be one of the last of the old guard<br />
in that sense, and as we know he's not on the front ranks.<br />
Australia's working men and women certainly need a voice in<br />
this Parliament, and I believe that voice now comes through the<br />
Liberal Party. </p>
