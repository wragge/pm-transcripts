COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA.<br />
SPEECH BY<br />
Rt. Hon. SIR ROBERT MENZIES,<br />
M. P.,<br />
ON.<br />
APPROPRIATION BILL 1964-65.<br />
Second Reading.<br />
( BUDGET DEBATE.)<br />
[ Fromn the ' Parliamentary Debates," 25th August 1964.]<br />
Sir ' ROBERT MENZIES ( Kooyong-<br />
Prime Minister) [ 8.311.-Mr. Deputy<br />
Speaker, I am glad that the honorable member<br />
for Barton ( Mr. Reynolds),-at the conclusion<br />
of his remarks, has thought fit to<br />
remind us that we are considering what<br />
amounts to a motion of censure, because,<br />
otherwise, this may have been overlooked<br />
during the debate of the last week. I do<br />
not propose to take up time discussing the<br />
honorable member's impassioned remarks,<br />
excepyt to suggest to him, in a friendly way,<br />
that, since -he is so upset about interest being<br />
charged on revenue moneys for capital purposes-<br />
being' advanced-to the Post Office, he<br />
DSsnhoowulyd pMerohuapnsta ilnoso k Hinytdor ot-heel epcotrsiict ionS cohfe mthee.<br />
In that ; Scheme, the Commonwealth is not<br />
aiming at profit. It has provided the overwhelming<br />
-bulk of the money for the<br />
Scheme out of revenue. That has been found<br />
by-the taxpayers. In the calculation of the<br />
price to be paid by the States concerned<br />
for the. power provided by the Scheme,<br />
interest on that money is taken into account.<br />
There is , nothing new about this. Indeed,<br />
the-honorable member, if he takes the next<br />
opportunity to talk to any Labour Premier<br />
whom he can find, will discover that this<br />
has been accepted by -all the Premiers.<br />
whatever their party affiliations may be. it<br />
11003164. has been accepted for a very good reason:<br />
There is no particular reason why a State<br />
should secure power in perpetuity at a cost<br />
that loads the whole of the capital burden<br />
on to today's taxpayer. This is perfectly<br />
proper. Therefore, I suggest to the honorable<br />
member, in a friendly way, that he<br />
should look into the financing of the Snowy<br />
Mountains Scheme.<br />
I wish primarily, Sir, to say something<br />
abbut the attack made by the Leader of<br />
the Opposition ( Mr. Calwell) on this Budget<br />
in the guise of an amendment that may -be<br />
said to amount to a censure mortion. He encountered<br />
some difficulties, because, if ever<br />
there was a Budget which was well balanced<br />
and in which stability, growth and action to<br />
counter inflation were -nicely blended, it is<br />
this Budget. I know of no completely<br />
responsible commentator who -has not<br />
admitted this. All I can sa'y -for myself and<br />
my colleagues is that we subscribe to every<br />
line of this Budget. The Leader of the<br />
Opposition, of course, felt that as usual he<br />
must launch an attack. He received, no<br />
doubt, suitable advice. Indeed, for some<br />
time during his speech last week, I thought<br />
he was -almost in a brown study, if honorable.<br />
* members can follow me in that<br />
allusion. He garnished bis~ sppegh 1withjg </p>
<p>few flourishes of his own. I shall say a<br />
little about them later, I -hope in a tender<br />
way. There were a few phrases that struck me.<br />
For example, the honorable gentleman said<br />
that this was a stop growth Budget. I1 suppose<br />
even he became a little tired of saying<br />
11stop-go So he just made this rather<br />
pleasant variation on a theme and said that<br />
this is a stop growth Budget. Stop growth!<br />
Why, the honorable member for Barton has<br />
just delivered a eulogy on the growth of<br />
this country that I could not imagine to be<br />
surpassed in any quarter. However, his<br />
Leader said first that this was a stop<br />
growth Budget. His Leader then said that<br />
this was a deflationary Budget. All I can<br />
say is that you cannot win with the Leader<br />
of the Opposition. At any rate, I cannot. I<br />
am like King Charles's head: I keep<br />
popping up.<br />
But what does the honorable gentleman<br />
mean by a deflationary Budget? Does he<br />
mean a counter to inflationary Budget or<br />
does he belong to that school of thoughtif<br />
it is to ' be called thought-which holds<br />
that there is no middle course between<br />
inflation and deflation? The whole purpose<br />
of this Budget, as was made abundantly<br />
clear in the most lucid terms by the<br />
Treasurer ( Mr. Harold Holt) in presenting<br />
it, is to produce not a deflationary result<br />
but an anti-inflationary one-to avoid<br />
inflation and to preserve that stability in<br />
the country on which the honorable member<br />
for Yarra ( Dr. J. F. Cairns) was kind<br />
enough to compliment me when he spoke in<br />
this debate, though I do not know why<br />
he did so. All these things are the purpose<br />
of the Budget. To describe it as deflationary<br />
is to give it a fantastic description. Indeed,<br />
the Leader of the Opposition very soon<br />
abandoned that proposition. There is one<br />
thing about him: He i s never so consistent<br />
in his attack that you can detect no flaw<br />
in the armour. On this occasion, having<br />
explained that this Budget was deflationary,<br />
and having -painted a picture of impending<br />
misery and depression, as he did when last<br />
year's Budget was presented as well as during<br />
the last election campaign, he then<br />
forgot what he had just done and said-<br />
I venture to suggest that this Budget will prove,<br />
as last year's Budget did, to have underestimated<br />
revenue by at least as much as last year's Budget<br />
or by at least œ 50 million. The Leader of the Opposition went on to<br />
say, referring to the Treasurer-<br />
If this proves to be the case the effect<br />
on the economy may well be much more drastic<br />
than he foresees.<br />
So he says that we are -underestimating the<br />
revenue. How is the revenue estimated by<br />
the Treasury? It is estimated -by making the<br />
best possible forecast of the state of the<br />
economy, of prosperity, of rates of earnings,<br />
of prices, of export earnings and so<br />
on, and then working out the sums. If<br />
revenues exceed estimates by œ 50 million,<br />
this will mean that the economy has been<br />
expanding more than had been estimated,<br />
in that employment, earnings, sales and<br />
imports will have risen more than the<br />
Treasury had estimated. If that represents<br />
deflation, we must get another dictionary.<br />
Now that I think of it, I shall come back<br />
to the dictionary a little later for another<br />
purpose. What I have just mentioned is a<br />
plain contradiction by the Leader of the<br />
Opposition of himself. First, he says that<br />
this Budget is deflationary and then, in<br />
effect, he says: " No, that is nonsense. We<br />
are to have a very expansive year."<br />
The honorable gentleman then attempted<br />
to show, with the aid of a table that he<br />
incorporated in Hansard that the<br />
incidence of taxation has changed. If I may<br />
interrupt myself, let me point out that the<br />
incidence of taxation does commonly<br />
change if income grows. This is not an<br />
uncommon experience. The Leader of the<br />
Opposition said that the incidence of taxation<br />
relative to prices and incomes has changed<br />
consistently to the detriment of those on<br />
lower incomes. This constitutes ' his case.<br />
This is one of the great points that he sets<br />
out to make in support of his censure<br />
motion. With the aid of a table that he produced.<br />
he attempted to show that a basic wage<br />
earner with a wife and two children had<br />
found his position deteriorating in the last<br />
ten years under the administration of this<br />
Government, which the honorable member<br />
for Yarra described as unhappily popular.<br />
The Leader of the Opposition declared that<br />
in the last ten years the tax paid by a basic<br />
wage earner with a wife and two children<br />
has risen from 5s. a week to 10s. 6d. a<br />
week, or from œ 12 8s. to œ 27 7s. a year.<br />
These a-re the figures he cited. Let us assume<br />
the existence of this man on the basic wage.<br />
The honorable gentleman forgets that this </p>
<p>man's wages have risen by œ 187 a year, out<br />
of which he pays an additional œ 14 or œ 15<br />
a year in tax. He also forgets that, in addition<br />
to the increase in his actual earnings<br />
this man has been receiving, over this period<br />
of time, increased social service benefits,<br />
which can never be left out of this calculation,<br />
and to which I shall refer again in<br />
a moment. But I would like to carry my examination<br />
of the honorable gentleman's table a little<br />
further. I want to consider the increases<br />
that have occurred in the 10 year period<br />
from 1954-55 to 1964-65. The income of<br />
the basic wage earner-this somewhat<br />
mythical being-increased in that period by<br />
œ E187. His income tax increased by œ E15, so<br />
that of his increased income he has retained<br />
92 per cent. The income of the average<br />
wage and salary earner, given in the honorable<br />
gentlemen's table under the heading of<br />
" Income of average earnings increased<br />
over the period of 10 years by œ E485. His<br />
income tax increased by œ 79, so that he<br />
retained 83.7 per cent. of his increased<br />
income. The income of a third group is<br />
given in the table under the heading of<br />
" Income of four times average earnings<br />
The increase in money income amounted<br />
to œ 1,940. Income tax increased by œ 933,<br />
so that the man in that category retained<br />
51.9 per cent, of his increased income.<br />
Let me repeat these results briefly so that<br />
they may be considered in relation to the<br />
charge that everything is altered to the<br />
detriment of the lower income earner-92<br />
per cent, retained by the basic wage earner,<br />
83.7 per cent. by the average earnings man,<br />
51.9 per cent. by the man in the third group<br />
selected by the Leader of the Opposition,<br />
which comprised those earning four times<br />
the average earnings. If this indicates that<br />
there is a constant pressing down on the<br />
position of the lower income groups, then<br />
I fail to understand the meaning of<br />
elementary facts.<br />
There has been no justification for the<br />
charge made by the Leader of the<br />
Opposition. However, as I said just a while<br />
ago, I would like to talk about certain other<br />
advantages that have been provided. Let<br />
me say a word about the increased benefits<br />
provided all the time, mark you, from the<br />
proceeds of taxation, which go materially<br />
in the direction of the lower income groups.<br />
It is very proper that they should do so and<br />
I am not complaining about it; I just want to state as a fact that they do so. The period<br />
with which I shall concern myself is that<br />
which covers the whole term of office of<br />
this Government. The appropriation for age<br />
and inv alid pensions has gone up-taking the<br />
figures to the nearest million-from<br />
œ 45 million to œ 215 million. No change in<br />
the value of money can explain that away.<br />
The amount for widow pensions has<br />
increased from œ 4 million to œ 23 million,<br />
for child endowment from œ 30 million to<br />
œ 86 million, for hospital benefits from œ 6<br />
million to œ 29 million, for pharmaceutical<br />
benefits from one-third of a million pounds<br />
to œ 30 million, for medical benefits from<br />
zero to œ 18 million and for pharmaceutical<br />
benefits for pensioners from zero to<br />
10 million.<br />
Mr. Deputy Speaker, if figures can have<br />
any eloquence at all, it is perfectly clear<br />
that the benefits of the proper social<br />
measures for which we have been so largely<br />
responsible do not go to the rich in the<br />
community but to the people who need them<br />
primarily. Therefore, this allegation that<br />
there is a sort of policy of grinding down<br />
the lower income earner is pathetic nonsense.<br />
I am shocked to think that the<br />
honorable gentleman could have obtained<br />
any more or less academic support for it.<br />
Now I come to the next point made by<br />
the Leader of the Opposition: This point<br />
was made, indeed, last year by the honorable<br />
member for Yarra, who is a thoughtful<br />
speaker and does a lot of work on these<br />
subjects. The Leader of the Opposition said<br />
that the country is slowly recovering from<br />
the artificial depression of 1961-this depression<br />
wickedly brought about by this<br />
Government. Considering the results, I just<br />
take leave to say that this is far from true.<br />
I do not want to add to the many things<br />
that have been so well said previously on<br />
this side of the House, but I suggest that<br />
to answer the -honorable gentleman's<br />
argument the right thing to do is to compare<br />
today's position with the position in<br />
the boom year, because he has said: Oh,<br />
yes, you cut down on the boom year, and<br />
all we are doing is recovering." So I will<br />
compare the boom year with the one which<br />
we have the acute misery to live.<br />
Civilian employment in June 1964 was<br />
I1I per cent. higher than in June 1960. In<br />
that period of time private employment<br />
rose by 249,000 and public authority employment<br />
by 85,000, an increase of 11 per </p>
<p>cent.. in each sector. Just recovering," says<br />
the Leader of the Opposition. We are<br />
recovering-plus, this enormous increase.<br />
Total wage and salary earnings in this last<br />
financial year were 27 per cent. greater than<br />
in 1959-60, the year that we refer to as the<br />
boom year. Average male earnings since<br />
that year have risen by 16. per cent, and<br />
since the consumer price index rose by<br />
something less than a third of that the<br />
increase in real earnings has been considerable<br />
and notable.<br />
Farm income increase is, of course,<br />
explained by a variety of circumstances.<br />
One of them is a tremendous increase in<br />
production. There has been good fortune<br />
in seasons and good fortune in prices, but<br />
never leave out of account the increase in<br />
production which is the result of the efforts<br />
of the man on the land. Farm income<br />
increased between the boom year and the<br />
last year by 46 per cent. Cash social service<br />
benefits increased in the same period by 39<br />
per cent. and other forms of personal<br />
income by 23 per cent. The gross national<br />
product increased by 27 per cent.<br />
Then let me talk about concrete matters<br />
and get away from purely monetary considerations.<br />
In the same period, production<br />
of steel rose by 35 per cent., electricity 38<br />
per cent. and cement 28 per cent. I need<br />
not go on. I could talk about motor vehicles<br />
and the enormous increase in the number<br />
of houses and flats commenced. In the<br />
boom year the number was' 91,000, which<br />
was a record at that time, and in 1963-64<br />
the number had increased to 107,000.<br />
Savings bank deposits have increased by 50<br />
per cent, since the boom year. They have<br />
risen to an average per head of population,<br />
men, women, children, grandchildren-I<br />
must stick to my last-of œ 200 a head, while<br />
in the boom year the average per head was<br />
œ E148. Those are phenomenal figures. Anybody<br />
who can look at them, acknowledge<br />
their truth and be heard to say that all we<br />
are doing is struggling out of the trough of a<br />
depression created in 1960 and 1961 is so<br />
far gone in partisanship that he will never<br />
really be able to take an objective view of<br />
anything. it is quite true-1 venture to say this and<br />
I think the public will agree with me-that,<br />
but for sound budgeting, sound monetary<br />
management, sensible economic policies and<br />
the preservation of a healthy climate, those figures that I have quoted would have produced<br />
an inflationary pressure much more<br />
serious that the one at which we have been<br />
looking. I was delighted that the Leader of the<br />
Opposition, is his speech, had a little of<br />
his own when he said-<br />
And when we delve deeper into this Harold<br />
in Wonderland speech, things grow curiouser<br />
and curiouser<br />
He quoted the words of Alice. I thought<br />
this was rather ' agreeable. In fact, it so<br />
stirred me that I re-read " Alice in Wonderland"<br />
I am indebted to the honorable<br />
member for having given me this literary<br />
refreshment. Mr. Falknder.-Were you thinking of<br />
the white rabbit?<br />
Sir ROBERT MEENZES,-No, no; I was<br />
thinking about the March Hare. When the<br />
honorable member began his speech, with<br />
all the hint of a censure motion, I thought<br />
that we were going to have something pretty<br />
powerful, not weak tea.<br />
Mr. Pollard.-Some people are thinking<br />
about the Mad Hatter.<br />
Sir ROBERT MENZ[ ES-I am thinkinig<br />
of both, old boy; but I was going to leave<br />
you out of it. I am sure honorable members<br />
will recall what was said. In fact, I was<br />
thinking of it, without having checked the<br />
precise words, when the honorable member<br />
was promising this powerful, pungent attack.<br />
I am sure honorable mem bers, remember<br />
these words-.'<br />
" Have some wine," the March Hare said in anJ<br />
encouraging tone. Alice looked all round the<br />
table-For this purpose I am Alice-the Mother<br />
of the Year. but there was nothing on it but tea. " I<br />
don't see any wine," she remarked. "' There isn'tJ<br />
any," said the March Hare.<br />
That is not a bad summary of the speech<br />
made by the Leader of the Opposition. I<br />
also remembered-as I am sure many of<br />
us did-as the honorable member kept<br />
repeating some of his erroneous conclusions,<br />
that he was doing it on the well known<br />
principle that Lewis Carroll expressed-<br />
" What I tell you three times is true I<br />
recommend to the honorable member the<br />
further pursuit of these studies. Having said<br />
that, I will go. back to the point that he<br />
thought he was making. </p>
<p>Mr. Peters.-Go back to " Alice in<br />
Wonderland Sir ROBERT MENZIES.-I will continue<br />
to quote his speech. And you listen<br />
to this, my boy; you will learn from it.<br />
Your leader-I regard him in that sense<br />
-went on to say--<br />
Strangely enough, we can nowhere find in the<br />
estimates any allocation for the instalment payments<br />
on the TFX bomber. Last year. we allowed<br />
million; this year nothing. Why? Will the<br />
Treasurer say why? Will the Prime Minister say<br />
why? Will the Minister for Defence say why?<br />
Will the Minister for Air say why?"<br />
This is a fine rhetorical phrase--<br />
According to the promise made last November,<br />
this bomber was to be delivered by 1966. Despite<br />
heated denials in this place, the former Minister<br />
-' for Airassume that that is correctly reportedsurreptitiously<br />
inserted into a general<br />
statement on the TFX the fact that it could not<br />
now be delivered before 1968.<br />
I had always regarded the Leader of the<br />
D pposition as something of a purist in<br />
-language. Everybody knows that surreptitiously<br />
means secretly or by stealth. How<br />
a Minister is clever enough to introduce<br />
into a public document, by stealth, a plain<br />
statement of fact, I just do not understand;<br />
but the word surreptitiously" is used.<br />
Let me remind the House that in October<br />
of last year I myself spoke about the TFX.<br />
I have forgotten whether I did it surreptitiously<br />
or not; but I am usually audible in<br />
the House, I hope. I said-<br />
The Government of Australia has agreed to<br />
purchase from the United States two squadrons<br />
FIIIA aircraft, which used to be called the<br />
TFX. By special arrangements with the United<br />
States of America, the aircraft will be available<br />
to Australia at the same time as deliveries are<br />
made to the United States armed forces, which<br />
will be from 1967 onwards.<br />
_ 1hat was my statement-not 1966, but<br />
1967. Then on 18th June, my colleague,<br />
the Minister for Defence ( Senator<br />
Paltridge), in this so-called stealthy"<br />
statement, said-<br />
The latest expert advice available to the<br />
Government makes it clear that the Canberra will<br />
not begin to be phased out of Squadron service<br />
until 1970. Doubts about its stated fatigue life<br />
have been resolved and it will continue to be a<br />
useful operational aircraft. In the light of advice<br />
from its professional advisers, the Government has<br />
decided to accept deliveries of FlllA aircraft in<br />
1968. These aircraft will embody modifications<br />
made as a result of United States Air Force<br />
squadron trials, thus providing Australia with a<br />
fully tested aircraft. In other words--Ithought all honorable<br />
members understood this-the choice was<br />
between getting in 1967 a type of aircraft<br />
which we would have to handle and which<br />
we might have to modify, and waiting one<br />
year longer and getting aircraft after they<br />
had gone through the whole of their<br />
squadron testing in the United States and<br />
had received their ultimate modification. So,<br />
showing very good sense, the Chiefs of<br />
Staff all said: " The second choice is a good<br />
bargain. Let us play it that way".<br />
Finally, the Minister for Defence, in his<br />
statement, said-<br />
Information from the United States shows that<br />
the development of the FIllA aircraft is proceeding<br />
satisfactorily.<br />
I thought all of that was pretty well known.<br />
But the Leader of the Opposition is troubled<br />
because there is nothing about it in this<br />
year's Budget. I just want to say that I am<br />
delighted about that; and I will tell the<br />
House why. The reason why no payment<br />
is being made for the TFX aircraft this<br />
financial year is, quite simply, that the<br />
United States authorities do not require any<br />
payment. The provisional schedule of payments<br />
which was negotiated by my late<br />
friend, Mr. Townley, is being revised in<br />
consultation with the United States to reflect<br />
the Government's decision to take deliveries<br />
of the aircraft in 1968 for the reasons I<br />
have mentioned and not to accept the loan<br />
of the B47 bomber as an interim aircraft.<br />
The Minister for Defence announced the<br />
reasons for these decisions in June.<br />
The revised schedule of payments has not<br />
yet been finally drawn up, but it is clear<br />
from discussions with the United States<br />
authorities that no payment is required<br />
during 1964-65 to supplement the amount<br />
of just under œ 9 million paid by us last<br />
year. In the meantime, that amount is earning<br />
interest until such time as payments are<br />
made to the United States contractors for<br />
our aircraft. Putting it in brief, Sir, we have<br />
a year's holiday from payments, and during<br />
that year we receive interest on the money<br />
that we have paid already.<br />
Future progress payments will be determined<br />
in consultation with the United States<br />
authorities. The estimated total cost to Australia<br />
of the 24 aircraft remains at the<br />
figure of œ 56 million announced by Mr.<br />
Townley in November of last year. Current<br />
advice from official United States sources<br />
is that progress on the project is on<br />
schedule, and firm assurances have been </p>
<p>given that there is no reason at all to doubt<br />
that deliveries will be made to the Royal<br />
Australian Air Force in 1968. This is up to<br />
date advice and it may be relied on.<br />
I do not want to trespass on the time<br />
of the House but I will just add one<br />
remark on this matter as a result of something<br />
that was said by the honorable member<br />
for Yarra ( Dr. J. F. Cairns). He went<br />
to some trouble in the course of his speech<br />
to establish that we did not need the TFX; that we did not need this kind of aircraft.<br />
On the contrary, he said, the kind of war<br />
that might have to be dealt with by Australia<br />
was one in which a bomber of this<br />
order, of this range, of this capacity, would<br />
be entirely irrelevant. So, not for the first<br />
time the Leader of the Opposition says one<br />
thing and the putative Deputy Leader of the<br />
Opposition says another. Anyhow, it has<br />
been a pretty futile attack and I do not say<br />
any more than that we reject it.<br />
BY AUTHORITY: A. J. ARTHUR. COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT PRINTER, CANBERRA. </p>
