Q, 11<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCE, PARLIAMENT HOUSE, 29<br />
NOVEMBER 1989<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Over the last couple of days, Prime<br />
Minister, there's been more talk about the possibility of<br />
an economic statement in the early part of next year.<br />
Previously you indicated that the Government will be<br />
making a statement about wages principles after the talks<br />
with the ACTU. Can you give us any indication as to<br />
whether the Government now wants to go further than that?<br />
PM: No I can't. I have nothing really to add on that,<br />
Paul, to what I've said before. I just simply state the<br />
obvious facts of history as relevant to the future. That<br />
is that we have made decisions about statements in the<br />
simple terms of is it necessary for stating,<br />
articulating Government policy? We've done it when<br />
that's been necessary and to outline any new decisions.<br />
If, as we come up to that period, we judge it necessary<br />
to act as we have in the past, we will do so. No such<br />
judgement has been made at this point. I wonder, having<br />
answered that question if I could make a general<br />
point which I think, Paul, is relevant to the question.<br />
This talk, as you say, that has been growing about the<br />
desirability or the proposal or the necessity of some<br />
economic statement, there seems to me to be in some sense<br />
a misunderstanding the factual situation which is that<br />
the stance, the existing stance, of Government policy is<br />
firm and is producing the appropriate results. We've got<br />
very, very firm fiscal policy, we've got very firm wages<br />
policy and, obviously, we have very firm monetary policy.<br />
I've explained that monetary policy is necessary in<br />
conjunction with the other two arms to produce a<br />
levelling of f of the degree of economic activity so that<br />
we can get a more sustainable level of imports. I've<br />
also pointed out that if you look at the composition of<br />
imports, that we are entitled, as a nation, to be very<br />
satisfied with the future implications of what's been<br />
happening in that structure of imports because they are<br />
being used to restructure Australian industry in a<br />
significant way. I simply go to those points to say that<br />
the Australian economic picture is basically sound,<br />
although because of the application of a tight monetary<br />
policy it is undoubtedly hurting some people. And that </p>
<p>we acknowledge and we want, as soon as it is responsible,<br />
to be able to ease that policy off. As I've said before,<br />
that will be done but not before we are convinced that<br />
there has been a sufficient levelling off of activity.<br />
So I say all that to make the point that I don't believe<br />
that we are in a situation where existing policy is not<br />
relevant and working.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, concede that such a<br />
statement would give the Government a political circuit<br />
breaker, would help the Government to regain the<br />
political initiative in the rundown to an election?<br />
PM: Well, let me take the last part of the question<br />
first, Paul, about regaining the political initiative. I<br />
don't accept that we've lost the political initiative. I<br />
mean, let's analyse the evidence on that. I mean, you<br />
don't need to be a political genius, I think, to read the<br />
political situation at the moment. That is that the<br />
Government is being hurt in significant sectors of the<br />
electorate by the level of interest rates. I've not<br />
attempted to disguise that fact either in the Parliament<br />
or outside. But the remarkable thing is that in that<br />
situation the major parties, on any analysis, are running<br />
neck and neck in the polls and if you look at the latest<br />
test in South Australia, I mean, everyone rushed to<br />
judgement and said devastation federally. OK, that's<br />
interesting because when you do the analysis of the South<br />
Australian poll, on a federal elected basis, no loss of<br />
seats. We would win back Adelaide, comfortably win back<br />
Adelaide, Liz Harvey in Hawker would go down marginally<br />
by just a few hundred votes, but I would suggest that in<br />
a federal election if it was if she was the issue<br />
that you'd hold that. So you could argue that not only<br />
no loss of seats, but getting one back. In other words,<br />
what is emerging is that we are being hurt not<br />
suggesting there wasn't a swing of course there was,<br />
but we are being hurt by the level of interest rates, but<br />
the electors are showing they are not prepared to embrace<br />
the alternative. And there is little wonder because its<br />
policies are a prescription for economic disaster and<br />
their leadership is entirely unconvincing. Now if we<br />
stick to the analysis and prescription that we've got,<br />
that is that we've got to bring down the level of<br />
activity somewhat by the mix of tight policy that is in<br />
place that produces the results that I think it will,<br />
then we are going to be vindicated in terms of<br />
steadfastness and relevance, against an alternative which<br />
is a disaster and is being revealed by their own people<br />
now as a disaster, that it's at least another three years<br />
of the same level of interest rates. Of course it would<br />
be even worse.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, when you talk about an<br />
easing of policy, are you just talking about an easing of<br />
monetary policy, or the other arms of policy? </p>
<p>PM: I was referring particularly to monetary policy.<br />
But let me make it clear so that there can't be any<br />
taking out of context, I'm not saying you would, that was<br />
referred to in the context of being convinced that the<br />
combination of the existing three arms of policy had<br />
produced the levelling off of activity that would be<br />
required responsibly to have that easing off of monetary<br />
policy. JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, when would you have to decide you<br />
were going to have a February/ March statement before<br />
Christmas, and, secondly, you seem to be implying that a<br />
statement meant some sort of change of policy. Surely<br />
you could have a statement which was simply reinforcing<br />
policy and setting out future directions?<br />
PM: There's lots of things, lots of things that you<br />
could have in a statement. I don't know that you need a<br />
statement to set out future directions. I'll be having<br />
something to say about that, I think at the Press Club<br />
next week. I don't think I need a statement in February<br />
or March to set out new directions. I've really got<br />
nothing, Michelle, to add to what I had to say before.<br />
We will have that statement if it's Judged appropriate<br />
and as to when I would make the judgement as to whether<br />
it was appropriate, well I can't say whether that would<br />
be in December or January.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, would you expect the various<br />
mortgage relief schemes being promoted in Queensland to<br />
be financed entirely within the State's finances, whoever<br />
wins on Saturday?<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, don't you see separate State<br />
schemes, mortgage relief schemes as being counterproductive<br />
to you in national economic policy and<br />
wouldn't it be better to have, if you are going to have<br />
separate State schemes, wouldn't it be better to have an<br />
overall national relief scheme?<br />
PM: Well, there's only two States in which it's been an<br />
issue. So you're not in the situation of all the States<br />
saying it, therefore if all the States are saying it,<br />
isn't it better to have a national scheme. This is an<br />
issue on which, very few of them, and probably at one<br />
with the Leader of the Opposition, take the view that<br />
it's a matter for leaders of the States or potential<br />
leaders of the States to make a decision on their<br />
assessment of their State capacity to undertake a scheme<br />
they believe they can finance, it's a matter for them to<br />
decide. JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, would you be happy to go to an<br />
election with interest rates at the present level and how<br />
much of a likelihood is this? </p>
<p>PM: Well, I can't answer the latter part of the question<br />
because I'm not going to predict what they'll be. But<br />
the answer to the first part of your question is obvious.<br />
I'd prefer to go to an election with interest rates lower<br />
than they are, I'd obviously prefer that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, what hope now for a settlement<br />
what hope is there now for a settlement of the<br />
pharmacists' dispute and how much damage is it doing to<br />
the Labor Party?<br />
PM: Taking the latter part of the question first, I<br />
don't perceive that it's doing an enormous amount of<br />
damage. It's not helping, obviously it would be silly to<br />
say that. As to the first part of your question, Peter,<br />
what chances are for the settlement, I don't think that<br />
it looks as though there can emerge an agreed position.<br />
What we have done in the last few days, within the<br />
' framework of the Riordan statement and in response to<br />
approaches that we'd had from a significant section of<br />
the chemists was to sit down with that group and see if<br />
there was the possibility of getting an agreed position<br />
that we could put to the Tribunal. We reached that<br />
position with the West Australians and they believed that<br />
they could get support of the rest of the industry, well<br />
I accept that they attempted in good faith to do that,<br />
they weren't able to get it. So we will be reporting the<br />
position to the Tribunal today and what develops<br />
obviously is a matter that can emerge out of those<br />
proceedings. It wouldn't be proper for me to try and<br />
pre-empt or pre-judge what might happen there, other than<br />
to say this. That there doesn't seem to be amongst the<br />
executives and leaders of the pharmacy industry in the<br />
eastern States at least, any preparedness to attempt<br />
really to get an acceptable common position.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, do you think the Government<br />
is being hurt by the pilots' dispute?<br />
PM: No, I don't believe so. All I can say is, as you<br />
know, I go around the country a hell of a lot, expose<br />
myself to the people for what they've got to say and I<br />
can honestly say to you that overwhelmingly, when this<br />
issue is raised, overwhelmingly it is ' do not give in to<br />
the pilots', that they, the people, understand that if<br />
there had been an accommodation by the Government of<br />
percent demand, that it would have been entirely<br />
destructive. So I don't believe we are being hurt, but<br />
let me say this further, even if I believed that we were,<br />
I would not alter the Government's position which I<br />
emphasise is simply this. That is that the pilots should<br />
do what the Industrial Relations Commission is saying<br />
they should do. Very simple, accept the three<br />
conditions, that is lift the embargo on their members<br />
flying, secondly, accept the decisions of the Commission,<br />
thirdly, be prepared to abide by the guidelines. Having<br />
done that, accepted those three conditions then apply to<br />
be bound by the award and thirdly, if those first two </p>
<p>things happen, then they are in a position to argue, as<br />
they are perfectly entitled to do if they believe the<br />
existing award which is based on the contract is not<br />
appropriate, then, in those circumstances, they could<br />
argue for a variation of that award. So that's what I<br />
believe should happen.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you optimistic that it will happen<br />
PM: I can't predict on the basis of the AFAP's behaviour<br />
to this point I wouldn't make any predictions about<br />
what they would do. But let me say this. For the sake<br />
of their membership I hope they do because the<br />
indisputable fact is that the Australian airline industry<br />
is being rebuilt, and substantially rebuilt. It's<br />
happening on a continuous basis. In the first part of<br />
1990 it will be back to normal operation. It regards<br />
itself as being in a position to handle the Christmas<br />
demand. So that is happening. The longer that the AFAP<br />
on behalf of the members that it still has the longer<br />
it stays out of the process of that rebuilding then the<br />
more certain it is that they will have no place. So I do<br />
not want now, nor have I ever wanted at any stage, to be<br />
vindictive in regard to the AFAP or its members. At all<br />
points I've said go back in. If you don't it's disaster.<br />
So I'm constant in that. I say take the opportunity and<br />
the process and the avenue which is offered by the<br />
Industrial Relations Commission. And from the point of<br />
view of the AFAP and its members the sooner the better.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, on the wider issue of<br />
industrial relations, do you believe that there should be<br />
an enshrinement perhaps in legislation of the right to<br />
strike PM: I answered that question in the Parliament<br />
yesterday. I gave a full answer in the Parliament<br />
yesterday. If you want I'm quite happy to give it again.<br />
I'm not avoiding it. It just seems to me a waste of<br />
time. But I'll do it. I'll give the answer that I gave<br />
yesterday. The point that I made in the Parliament<br />
yesterday was quite straight forward. There is a right<br />
to strike in this country and it's exercised. We have in<br />
this country an industrial relations system operating<br />
under the Industrial Relations Commission umbrella in<br />
which almost on a daily basis around this country you'll<br />
find some direct action. Let me put that in the context<br />
that under this Government industrial disputes have<br />
declined by 60% as compared to our predecessors. But<br />
nevertheless you have a system where industrial action<br />
can be taken, is taken. But you have a system which<br />
provides a method of resolution for those disputes<br />
without recourse to the civil courts. The decision that<br />
was taken in the Supreme Court creates no precedent,<br />
makes no new law. That's by definition. It's always<br />
been there. Now there is the position where the union<br />
involved, the AFAP, was warned by the trade union<br />
movement, by the Government and by its employers that if </p>
<p>it went outside that system where protection was provided<br />
and deliberately exposed itself to that possibility of<br />
civil action then that could happen and it has. What<br />
must be understood, it was that federation which was<br />
seeking to destroy the very system which provides the<br />
protection where there is industrial action. They said<br />
no, that system where there is the protection, if people<br />
take direct action, we are going to destroy that. We<br />
won't have a bar of it. We're going outside of it. And<br />
consciously may well destroy it. Now they've sought to<br />
destroy a system and then complain about the fact that<br />
they are being hurt by it. So nothing in that sequence<br />
of events creates any reason for saying that we should<br />
change what existed before.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, if the pilots did capitulate this<br />
do you think there'll be any problem in Ansett to<br />
deal with them?<br />
PM: Could I just make a point. I wouldn't use the word<br />
capitulate. I've said all along that I would not be<br />
claiming in any outset, in any outcome of this<br />
confrontation that's existed in the airlines. If the<br />
pilots make that decision I won't be describing it as<br />
capitulation or victory for us because I don't think<br />
using language like that, that it is useful. But the<br />
facts of course are Michelle that if the AFAP does that<br />
then the companies being bound by the Commission have no<br />
alternative but to be in a negotiation, conciliation,<br />
arbitration situation. Because if those three steps were<br />
followed, that is they accepted the three conditions and<br />
sought to be bound by the award and were granted leave to<br />
be bound by the award and then made an application for<br />
variation, then what happens in the Industrial Relations<br />
Commission if you make an application of variation<br />
the Commission calls the parties. And the airlines are<br />
parties. So you would have the AFAP if the Commission<br />
makes a decision party called in, the companies are<br />
called in. Of course they'd be there.<br />
JOURNALIST: It would be a bit of a mess wouldn't it...<br />
PM: How would it be a mess? They are the ones who I<br />
just simply do not understand what you're saying. How<br />
could it be a mess? They have said all along that theyoperate<br />
within the Commission. That's what they've asked<br />
for to operate<br />
JOURNALIST: recruited a number of pilots deal<br />
with PM: That's not a mess. The mess is not for the<br />
airlines. How can you possibly say it's a mess for the<br />
airlines? I mean what sort of logic leads you to that<br />
conclusion? They are the ones that have said we operate<br />
in the Commission. The AFAP has got their members to<br />
resign. So the airlines have no AFAP members as a result<br />
of the AFAP decision. Airlines about the decision </p>
<p>have recruited and recruited substantially. Now the<br />
realities therefore for the AFAP is that they would be<br />
dealing with employers who now have significantly lower<br />
numbers of vacancies. Now how you describe that as a<br />
mess for the airline I just really don't understand.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you think that the high profile that<br />
you've taken in handling this dispute has contributed in<br />
some way to your decline, the decline in your personal<br />
standing in the opinion polls?<br />
PM: How can you measure these things? I would think<br />
perhaps it has in some quarters. I know in other<br />
quarters that people have applauded me for my handling of<br />
it. So I can't weight it. I guess probably some people<br />
haven't liked it. I accept that. But as I said also in<br />
an answer to a previous question. People don't like high<br />
interest rates. So that probably hurt a bit. I just<br />
don't really know what the mix is. All I can say is that<br />
the positions and policies that have been adopted have<br />
been adopted on the basis of what's right for the<br />
country. I wouldn't deviate from that. I'm not going to<br />
be chasing popularity in terms of saying well if I did<br />
this a bit differently but it meant not doing the right<br />
thing, I'm not in that sort of caper.<br />
JOURNALIST: Yesterday Mr Peacock refused to give a<br />
timetable for when his policies would lower interest<br />
rates. He spoke about perhaps the full period of office,<br />
three years. What's your timetable?<br />
PM: Well I'm not going to put a day or month on it. I<br />
simply am going to say in regard to the comparison with<br />
Mr Peacock that he is right to say it might take three<br />
years or more. I am right to say it would take<br />
significantly less under us. For the simple reason that<br />
his policies, as I have spelt out in the Parliament on a<br />
number of occasions, inevitably mean higher interest<br />
rates. Don't be surprised by the fact that in the last<br />
couple of days you've had the Leader of the Opposition<br />
and the Shadow Minister for Finance and the Shadow<br />
Treasurer being forced into these positions. It's not<br />
just some sort of accidental gaffe although I know that<br />
their Queensland colleagues would gladly shoot them but<br />
it is the result of the remorseless exposure of the<br />
economically inevitable consequences of their announced<br />
economic policies. Because if you you don't have to be<br />
much advanced beyond first year economics, if that far,<br />
to understand and I know you're well advanced past that<br />
but you don't have to be very well advanced past first<br />
year economics to understand that if economic matters<br />
involve three arms of policy, as it does, and the<br />
Opposition are getting up and saying we will have looser<br />
fiscal policy, as they are, because it must be. I mean<br />
if you in fact, in terms of what they're saying, have a<br />
difference of about $ 100 million but then don't take into<br />
account the enormous gaping hole in revenue from the<br />
abolition of the capital gains tax, then what they do </p>
<p>about the $ 800 million is another matter. But inevitably<br />
there's no analyst says that their fiscal policy won't be<br />
looser. So if you have looser fiscal policy, if you have<br />
looser wages policy as everyone knows follows if you<br />
abandon the centralised wage system and say everybody go<br />
and do an AFAP, then you inevitably have looser wages<br />
policy. Now as I say, just first week economics will<br />
tell you looser fiscal policy, looser wages policy, ipso<br />
facto two things. Tighter monetary policy and rising<br />
unemployment. So don't be surprised that these<br />
beleaguered people who have been subjected to this<br />
remorseless analysis of the inevitabilities have had to<br />
concede it.<br />
JOURNALIST: Well Mr Hawke, in the context of the easing<br />
of monetary policy under your Government, is it possible<br />
to have an economic statement that doesn't tighten fiscal<br />
and wages policy?<br />
PM: Well, all I am saying is that we are not going to be<br />
our fiscal policy is set there and everyone knows it.<br />
You don't have the speculations about that policy<br />
enshrined in the Budget. So we see how that's operating.<br />
We will be discussing wages with the ACTU as we have done<br />
over the last seven years. Obviously we are not it<br />
simply follows from some of the other things I've been<br />
saying here we are not going to be acting in the area<br />
of fiscal and wages policy in a way which would not<br />
enable an easing of monetary policy.<br />
JOURNALIST: Some people in the trade union movement may<br />
have conceded they've made a mistake in 1986 when they<br />
rejected the consumption tax. Do you think there's any<br />
benefits in that now in the current economic climate as<br />
long as you have trade-offs for inflation and you protect<br />
the disadvantaged?<br />
PM: No, a consumption tax is not on the agenda.<br />
JOURNALIST: By negotiating with a splinter group of<br />
pharmacists do you think the Government ran the risk of<br />
a) worsening the divisions within pharmacy and<br />
particularly making a dispute The very fact that the<br />
Government's now come back to offering to take a joint<br />
submission to the Tribunal, basically reinstating pay<br />
rates to before the Tribunal decision. Does that<br />
indicate to you<br />
PM: Eh, eh, eh,<br />
JOURNALIST: that it's time to start thinking about a<br />
whole new system of wage structuring for pharmacy and<br />
another avenue for<br />
PM: Well, let's take the two parts of the question.<br />
Firstly, did we make a mistake in having discussions with<br />
what you've called a splinter group? It's not a splinter<br />
group. It was the West Australians who approached me </p>
<p>when I was over there in Western Australia and then out<br />
of that they came over here. They put to us that they<br />
had been talking with the rest of the pharmacy groups,<br />
including the Guild, and that in what they were putting<br />
to us they believed that if we could reach an agreed<br />
position with them that they, from the discussions they'd<br />
had with people from within the rest of the industry,<br />
that anything we could agree with them they would be able<br />
to get agreement with the others. So we didn't go into<br />
that in a sense of saying we're ignoring everyone else,<br />
we're just dealing with West Australia. It was put to us<br />
and I think in good faith may I say on behalf of those<br />
West Australian people, I'm sure it was in good faith<br />
they'd had those discussions and they believed that they<br />
would be able to get an agreement. In the event they<br />
couldn't. So that really is revelant to the first part<br />
of your question. We weren't seeking to say them with no<br />
involvement of the others. Indeed the basis of the<br />
discussion was that they would then out of those<br />
discussions go off and talk with the others. So I don't<br />
see any problem about that, although I notice that some<br />
people may be trying to beat something up out of it. But<br />
that doesn't worry me at all. Now, as to the second part<br />
of your question. We took the position that the $ 4.20<br />
that was operating from November 1 and we took into<br />
account, as a basis of seeing whether there was a<br />
possibility of getting an agreed position to go before<br />
the Tribunal so that the Tribunal itself from that<br />
interim position that we would've negotiated, it wouldn't<br />
have been a binding final position. An attempt to get an<br />
agreed position on the basis of which the industry could<br />
put its position fully for the duration of the inquiry.<br />
It seemed to us that you could live with the sort of<br />
figure that we were talking about operating from the 1st<br />
of January. Because if you took account of say inflation<br />
movement between the end of the year and in March 1<br />
applied that, plus the fact that we conceived that we<br />
could apply some part of the $ 60 million package to it,<br />
we could get an outcome of $ 4.55 from January 1. But I<br />
repeat, on the basis that that was in the framework if<br />
you like of Mr Riordan's statement which was looking at<br />
getting a basis in which everyone would be going before<br />
the Tribunal, putting submissions and allowing the matter<br />
to proceed. So that was in that framework only of saying<br />
well here is an interim position that we could live with<br />
while the Tribunal then went ahead and conducted its<br />
inquiry. It doesn't of itself carry any implications as<br />
to what we thought the final outcome should be. That's<br />
the role of the Tribunal.<br />
JOURNALIST: And you're quite happy with the system of<br />
setting remuneration for pharmacists as it is?<br />
PM: To say I'm quite happy with it wouldn't be the way I<br />
would put it. I mean you say that but don't put those<br />
words in my mouth. I mean you could hardly be happy with<br />
a situation which has taken so long without producing an<br />
outcome. Let me remind you that way back at the </p>
<p>beginning of this year we were within two votes of the<br />
Guild of having an agreement. Had the negotiations and<br />
the discussions and we attempted to get agreement<br />
couldn't get it. So then we had no alternative but as a<br />
Government to act in terms of the legislation of our<br />
predecessors. I remind you, we didn't pass that<br />
legislation. The previous government said that you had<br />
to have an arm's length situation. You couldn't properly<br />
work these things out and negotiations between the<br />
government and the industry so they established a<br />
tribunal. Not being able to get a negotiative position<br />
we said alright there's the Tribunal and went to it. Now<br />
they conducted a lengthy inquiry and came down with their<br />
decision. Now after that, as you know, when they brought<br />
it down, we then in talks with the Guild through Mr<br />
Matthews, we made a joint submission to the Tribunal and<br />
said we'll delay it for a month until 1 November to see<br />
if there can be further negotiations. The Tribunal did<br />
that. We attempted to have those negotiations, the Guild<br />
S didn't cooperate and so then in those circumstances we<br />
developed the package, the $ 60 million package. They<br />
haven't bought that so we're back now at the Tribunal.<br />
Now to say am I happy with all that, the answer is no.<br />
You'd be a bit of a thorough-going blue ribbon first<br />
class masochist to say you were happy with that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Who do you regard, for formal purposes, as<br />
the voice of Australian industry and how do you feel<br />
about the change of venue to a phone booth for tonight's<br />
dinner? PM: I woke up this morning, I hadn't been in bed long.<br />
I was working till about I won't tell you how late but<br />
it was very late till early this morning. I wanted to<br />
get a bit of sleep. I was woken up by a phone call and<br />
the first thing I see is that the body that I'm getting<br />
black tied for tonight and it takes a fair bit to get<br />
me black tied I might say, it's not my usual sort of<br />
0 dress and I find out in looking at a paper this morning<br />
that they're falling apart. So I don't know whether I<br />
wear half a black tie or just go in a dinner suit or<br />
what. But I hadn't heard this about a change of venue.<br />
I mean are we going down market?<br />
JOURNALIST: No, you're going to the phone booth<br />
PM: We're going to a phone booth. Well.<br />
JOURNALIST: Seriously, who do you think however, who do<br />
you regard as the voice in this day and age of Australian<br />
industry? PM: Well the answer to that question is there isn't a<br />
voice. You recall it's a very interesting question.<br />
At the summit in April of ' 83, 1 mean I was involved in<br />
saying to the business community for God's sake get your<br />
act together. Because obviously the Government was going<br />
to have an effective working relationship with the ACTU. </p>
<p>They were quite open. I said now I want to have an<br />
effective working relationship with the other side of<br />
industry. Get your act together. And out of that,<br />
directly out of the summit came the Business Council of<br />
Australia, But of course as you know, the Business<br />
Council of Australia is basically confined to the large<br />
companies. Now at the other side, you have had the CAI<br />
and may I say in the life of this Government if there's<br />
been one organisation of employers which has been if I<br />
can say the political voice pf employers in terms of<br />
fairly consistently taking an anti Government political<br />
line it's been the CAI. It seems to be according to<br />
this morning's Press falling apart. Now let me say as<br />
far as the metal trades industry is concerned there is a<br />
clear voice there, you know the Metal Trades Industry<br />
Association. They speak with authority there for that<br />
very important section of Australian industry we have no<br />
difficulty. In other words, when we're dealing with that<br />
area of the Australian economy having a voice. But I<br />
unfortunately I think you just have so many -I think<br />
this is clear implication of your question -if you're<br />
talking about a voice for Australian industry of<br />
employers, there isn't one-. I think that's unfortunate.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, just going back to Rob Hadler's<br />
question, you said fiscal policy was set. Forward<br />
Estimates suggests that the Budget, on no change in<br />
Government policy, the Budget deficit, the Budget surplus<br />
would fall next year. Does this mean that you'll accept<br />
a fall in the Budget surplus and therefore no further cut<br />
PM: I'm not prepared to say now what the outcome is that<br />
we will be aiming for. I mean I want to see, with this<br />
qualification, we're obviously going to be requiring a<br />
very, very substantial surplus. I've said and I think<br />
Paul has probably said too, that the judgement may be at<br />
a time when we come to consider it that we need surplus,<br />
the same sort of dimension that we need to keep at all<br />
for debt repayment, there's nothing there for any other<br />
purpose. Now we're not pre-empting that sort of<br />
position. I'm simply saying to you what I said beforehand<br />
that at the appropriate time we'll make the<br />
judgement as to whether there is a need for a statement<br />
and if so, the range of matters that will be involved in<br />
it. But I'm not simply saying at this point whether<br />
there will be, what would be in it and what actual Budget<br />
outcome we would be aiming for. It would be far too<br />
early now to be saying that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, do you agree that given its better<br />
international Ansett will emerge from the airline<br />
dispute significantly stronger financially than<br />
Australian Airlines and what implications does this have<br />
for funding Australian in the future?<br />
PM: I can't draw that implication that out of the<br />
dispute Ansett will necessarily emerge the stronger. Of </p>
<p>course I guess that both of them have been even before<br />
this pilots confrontation that they would've been<br />
making their plans for the degregulated environment that<br />
comes next year. I'm not in a position to say who's<br />
planned better for that. But as to the funding of<br />
Australian, as you know those matters are under<br />
consideration by the Government. I've got nothing to add<br />
on that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is it not the case that Ansett's been able<br />
to lease an aircraft overseas to offset some on the costs<br />
PM: Well they've leased aircraft, so has Australian.<br />
JOURNALIST: I mean their aircraft in the United States,<br />
for example.<br />
_ PM: Lease them out to<br />
JOURNALIST: inaudible<br />
PM: Well I've seen reference to that and OK, so if<br />
they've done that I guess that's a relative plus for<br />
them, viz-a-viz Australian. But I would doubt very much<br />
whether that fact of itself is going to make the<br />
difference as to who's going to go into the deregulated<br />
atmosphere better. I mean you've seen over the last<br />
couple of years a very significant lift in Australian's<br />
performance. They were down relatively and as you know<br />
when you're talking between the two airlines, the<br />
percentage difference in the share of the market is<br />
reasonably minute but still identifiable in determining<br />
who's doing better. Australian had lifted its game very<br />
significantly in that period.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, in your statement last<br />
PM: No-one seems here to understand-<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, in your Garnaut statement you<br />
commissioned quite a lot of work. Can you give us any<br />
indication as to when some of those decisions might<br />
actually be taken and just how wide ranging they might in<br />
fact be?<br />
PM: As you know I announced some decisions on the night<br />
of the speech. The work has been commissioned already<br />
and I would expect some of the important decisions to be<br />
made quite quickly. I mean I'm not going to announce the<br />
day or the week but we are not looking at many, many<br />
months. JOURNALIST: Does that include the tariff goal, a<br />
decision on that. And secondly, you referred to the<br />
airline funding decision. When would you anticipate that<br />
being made? </p>
<p>-A 13<br />
PM: On the first one, the tariff one, I certainly will<br />
be examining that and having consultations about that.<br />
Those processes will be underway. As to just precisely<br />
when decisions will be taken, I can't say. But I'm<br />
putting to you quite clearly that the work is underway<br />
and the Minister will be having consultations as we did<br />
before. So that process is underway. It's not helpful<br />
to say precisely which month I would expect decisions to<br />
be taken but we're not talking about long distance time<br />
scales. JOURNALIST: So are we talking about December? Are you<br />
talking about this year?<br />
PM: I haven't got anything to add to what I said. Now<br />
there was a second part to your question about funding.<br />
I don't know when those decisions will be taken. We're<br />
not under any pressure about it, don't feel under any<br />
pressure about it.<br />
JOURNALIST: Before the election?<br />
PM: Well, when's the election going to be?<br />
JOURNALIST: You said in June last year that you hoped to<br />
resolve the issue before the election.<br />
PM: We'll see. I just haven't had discussions with the<br />
Minister lately about it. That will come up on the<br />
agenda, the decision will be made when it needs to be<br />
taken. ends<br />
