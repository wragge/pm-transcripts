PRIME MINISTER<br />
NEW ZEALAND VISIT<br />
I will make an official visit to New Zealand from February 15-17.<br />
The visit will be my first opportunity for a meeting with my New Zealand<br />
counterpart, Mr Jim Bolger, following the formation of the New Zealand<br />
Coalition Government.<br />
It will also enable me to meet members of the New Zealand Government<br />
including the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Winston Peters.<br />
Australia already has strong ties with New Zealand. We are New<br />
Zealand's largest trading partner while New Zealand ranks as Australia's<br />
third largest trading partner.<br />
The visit will build on these strong trade links and also focus on other<br />
areas of shared interest and concern.<br />
