    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Australian Government and the West Australian Government today signed the National Partnership Agreement for the East Kimberley Development Package.</p>
<p>The Agreement is a further example of the Commonwealth and the States working together to tackle the economic down-turn and stimulate the economy.</p>
<p>Under the Agreement, the Commonwealth will invest $195 million in five priority areas:</p>
<p>     * $50 million towards health infrastructure;</p>
<p>     * $64 million towards education and training;</p>
<p>     * $50 million in social housing;</p>
<p>     * $15 million in transport infrastructure; and</p>
<p>     * $16 million towards community infrastructure.</p>
<p>This investment in social and common use infrastructure in the East Kimberley region is part of the Australian Government's $4.7 billion Nation Building plan to support jobs and apprenticeships today while building the infrastructure Australia needs for tomorrow.</p>
<p>The East Kimberley Development Package complements the WA Government's $220 million investment in expansion of the Ord irrigation area to ensure the balanced development of the East Kimberley region.</p>
<p>It has been developed jointly by the Commonwealth and West Australian governments in consultation with the local community, to support the economic and social development of the region.</p>
<p>This investment promotes sustainable regional development, providing social infrastructure in the areas of health, education, community facilities, housing and transport. It will also provide training and productive employment opportunities for Indigenous communities in the region.</p>
<p>The Australian Government is committed to building a stronger future for people in the East Kimberley.</p>
<p>The Package will deliver real on-the-ground infrastructure for the people living and working in the East Kimberley, fostering growth and sustainability of this high-productivity region.</p>
