I PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCE, SCHOOL OF ARTS, FAIRFIELD, 23<br />
AUGUST 1989<br />
E J&amp; OE -PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Can we ask about the pilots? Stand downs have<br />
* begurn. What's your view of the situation?<br />
* PM: 1I Well I just hope that the pilots will understand that<br />
thelairlines, supported by the Government, are not going to<br />
giv~ in to these outrageous demands. As I say, I don't want<br />
conirontation, war or anything else with the pilots. All I<br />
* wanj Is that they should act as the overwhelming body of<br />
ordinary Australians. See the people around here, the<br />
ord4nary Australians abide by the system. They put their own<br />
int rest in the context of the interests of the nation as a<br />
whole. I ask of nothing more and nothing less of the pilots.<br />
JOUI4NALIST: As far as contingency plans go, what can the<br />
p ublic expect In terms of services if it continues?<br />
I PM: Arrangements are being made which will involve attempts<br />
to have international airlines providing some services and<br />
the , RAAF providing some planes. As I've said all along,<br />
well never be able to have a complete substitution but we<br />
hope we'll have a position where we can both cover emergency<br />
-situations and some services for the public.<br />
I JOURNIALIST: Who makes the next move, Prime Minister? Is<br />
there any overture that you can make in all of this?<br />
P M: II don't feel with absolute sincerity of the pilots,<br />
I simply say to them you are important members of our<br />
coimunity and if you've got claims that you want to make,<br />
then1 make them within the system, you can have negotiations<br />
* within the system. Within that negotiation, within the<br />
syst~ m there can be legitimate improvements in wages but we<br />
are hot going to have a situation where you're going to break<br />
this economy. So let's think of the nation as a whole and<br />
not ust of Immediate self interest. That's all I ask of<br />
them. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Are you surprised some of the pilots didn't<br />
break away from their union and agree to these conditions set<br />
down by the companies?<br />
PM:~ I expected in this initial stage that we'd get a<br />
* reaction much of the order it's been.<br />
JOURNALIST; Can I ask you briefly about the logging<br />
' situation? Last night you made some strong statements to<br />
pro'tect NSW forests. How far can you go though without<br />
infringing States rights?<br />
PM: What's this question of infringing States rights?<br />
You~ don't exist as a NSW person and an Australia person. I<br />
meahI you are an Australian who happens to live in NSW and the<br />
facjz is that we are concerned with the rights of Australians,<br />
notlonly you, me, this generation, we're concerned with the<br />
rights of Australians as future generations and under the<br />
Corx~ titution we have the opportunity, If it's necessary, of<br />
using Constitutional powers to protect the rights of this<br />
* generation and future generations of Australians. I have<br />
always taken the view that I'd like to be able to do that in<br />
term's of cooperation with the States. That's what I'd<br />
* preter. But if Mr Causley is going to say, ' 1 don't give a<br />
dam4 about agreements, I don't give a damn about future<br />
gnrations', then Mr Causley will have to face up to the<br />
facl that I and my Government are prepared to act for all<br />
Austjralians now and into the future.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you see this looming as a potential Franklin<br />
2SS'de in any forthcoming election?<br />
PM: I I don't look for looming confrontation. I mean that's<br />
never been my caper. I've always tried to say let's sit down<br />
and Italk this thing through, let's try and get agreement. So<br />
I'm 6iot looking for confrontation, this or otherwise. I<br />
siply say that we will not be diverted from our<br />
0 resppnsibility to present Australians, to future generations<br />
of Aistralians. My Government has shown, as I said in Sydney<br />
lasti night, that it's not a question of development and jobs<br />
o ' n the one hand and the environment on the other. We have<br />
creat ed one and a half million new jobs since we've been In<br />
* offife, five times faster than the conservatives did when<br />
* they were In, more than twice as fast as the rest of the<br />
worl But at the same time as we've done that we've also<br />
got 4n environmental record second to none in the world. so<br />
you don't have to have one or the other, you can do both and<br />
we will. </p>
<p>-3-<br />
JOURNALIST: touah line against the nilots. Do you think<br />
it might have stalled rnegotiations?<br />
PF.: We haven't stalled anything. It's a simple proposition<br />
that I as Prime Minister of this country have a<br />
responsibility for all Australians. I certainly have no<br />
responsibility to prop up greedy demands by a group of people<br />
who are already very well paid and are in a very privileged<br />
position. I would be absolutely derelict in my duty if I<br />
didn't takze action which was going to ernsure that this<br />
economy is protected. This economy would be devestated if<br />
the pilots won this dispute?<br />
JOURNALIST: And considering financially. Prime Minister<br />
PIVI I've answered that question. What I've said is that<br />
when we started to have a discussion the question was raised<br />
that if the dispute went on for a long time it would be very<br />
costly to the airlines and would i-we looks at the question of<br />
the fees and the charges which they paid. Well I said no,<br />
that we would deal with this dispute as it is. If it<br />
happened to'go on for a very long time, and you wanted to<br />
raise that with us, we'd look at that issue. But that's not,<br />
on the iirjmediate agenda.<br />
ends </p>
