    <content><![CDATA[<p>Today, Japanese Prime Minister Abe and I signed an historic free trade agreement between Japan and Australia.</p>
<p>Australia owes much of its economic prosperity to our trade and investment with Japan over the last 50 years.</p>
<p>Japan is our third largest source of foreign investment; it was our largest trading partner for more than 40 years and Australian resources such as coal and iron-ore have helped Japan become an industrial powerhouse.</p>
<p>The Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement (JAEPA) was finalised during my visit to Japan earlier this year and todayâs signing brings us another step closer to realisation of the benefits of the Agreement for Australian and Japanese consumers, families and businesses.</p>
<p>This is the first free trade agreement that Japan has made with a major developed economy.</p>
<p>For Japan, the Agreement means even better access to the Australian market for its manufactured goods.</p>
<p>For Australia, it means better access for our beef, dairy, wine, horticulture and grain products.</p>
<p>Freer trade means more economic growth and more economic growth means more prosperous people and fairer societies.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Abe and I also signed an agreement to deepen our defence science, technology and materiel cooperation.</p>
<p>The Australia-Japan defence relationship, based on shared values and interests, is an important contribution to peace and stability in the Asia Pacific.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Abe will now accompany me to the Pilbara and Perth to see first-hand the impressive results Australian and Japanese companies are achieving together.</p>
