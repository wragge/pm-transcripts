PRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT MONDAY, 16 FEBRUARY, 1981<br />
PRIME MINISTER INTERVIEWED ON RADIO STATION 2MW, COOLANGATTA,<br />
WITH PETER WHITE, LIBERAL'CANDIDATE FOR MCPHERSON IN BY ELECTIONq:<br />
INTERVIEWER: _' THOMPSON<br />
Thompson Prime Minister of Australia, Mr. Malcolm Fraser, and as you<br />
said, the. Liberal candidate for McPherson in the by election<br />
coming up on Saturday, Peter White. First of all, Prime Minister,<br />
thank you very much indeed for joining us and we will be taking<br />
calls if anyone would like to talk to you. Sir, just while we<br />
are waiting for the first call; the issue of flat rate taxation.<br />
appears to have become the major issue of the McPherson by<br />
election. Are you surprised at that?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I am not surprised-that people are talking about it, but I<br />
do not really think it is a major issue, because I believe -that<br />
most people recognise it for what it is. Something that is<br />
going to more than double the tax on a bloke with a dependent<br />
wife with the modest income of $ 9,000, and half the tax on<br />
somebody at $ 50,000 is not exactly equitable. I do not think itwill<br />
get any support on that basis. A tax change which is making<br />
lower income people pay a lot more, and the wealthy pay a lot<br />
less, is not something that we would support. But even going<br />
beyond that, it would mean a lot less revenue collected overall,<br />
and the Queensland share of reduced-revenue would be $ 500 million,<br />
Well now, if Joh is prepared to take $ 500 million less from the<br />
Commonwealth, I will be delighted. But on the other hand, he<br />
signed a document the other day with Neville Wran and well,<br />
all the Premiers were there but Joh was in the company with<br />
the Socialist Premiers also, they all signed the one document,<br />
saying they wanted more, a bigger slice of taxes. Now how can h~ e<br />
come to me, as Prime Minister, as say he wants me to give him<br />
-more taxes when he is saying to the people in McPherson he wantsless.<br />
I think there is a slight contradiction there.<br />
Thompson Prime Minister, thank you. Peter White, it is a pleasure to.<br />
welcome you to 97MW as well. Peter, it has been suggested that<br />
you have a certain reputation, you developed a certain reputation<br />
in State Parliament as the Member for Southport, of being somethingof<br />
an anti-coalitionist and this has been brought up during the<br />
campaign. How do you react to that claim?<br />
Peter White<br />
Well, it has been brought fairly forcibly by the Premier,<br />
particularly in the last few days, and I just do not react at all<br />
because I think it is a pity that some of the things he's said<br />
have come down to the level of sort of personal attacks. / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
Peter White ( continued)<br />
I stand by everything that I have said during my term in<br />
State Parliament, because I would still ( inaudible) issues and<br />
principles which I believe were very important to my electorate<br />
and to me, and to the Parliament. But having said all that,<br />
I have made it clear, and I hope it is clear to everyone, that.<br />
we are now talking about a Federal Parliament. We are talking<br />
about a Federal coalition, which is nost successful and has<br />
brought Australia to an unparalleled degree of prosperity with<br />
more to com I look forward to working in that coalition, with<br />
men that I very much admire and respect.<br />
Thompson Thank you very much Mr. Peter White. Prime Minister, I take<br />
this opportunity to raise a point which doesn't actually come'<br />
into the by election as such, but which is one touching on the<br />
electronic media; and that is the question of the blackout for<br />
the 72 hours before the election. Has there been any thought<br />
given to perhaps varying this legislation?<br />
Prime Minister-<br />
A great deal of thought. A large part of the original blackout<br />
was because people were frightened of the power of the media which<br />
is yourself, radio, because it came in in radio days and then<br />
television also. Things being said * at the last minute without a<br />
chance to rebut them. Now, that might be unreasonable, but I<br />
also think that, especially in a Federal election where people<br />
get bombarded all the time on television and radio and newspapers,<br />
that they like a bit of a rest in the last couple of days, quietly<br />
to make up their own minds, not being badgered, not having their<br />
programmes op television interrupted. That quite period before<br />
the election -it is a bit of a cooling off. The average guy<br />
can just sit back and make his own assessment without being told<br />
all the time. I am not at all sure that is a bad thing. We have<br />
thought , about it many times and we did again a short while ago,<br />
but we decided not to alter it.<br />
Thompson Fine. Wel1l at least we can take it that it is being considered.<br />
Peter White: the local issues of this election campaign I think<br />
have come down to telephones, Telecom service on the Gold Coast<br />
or lack of it, and television.<br />
Peter White<br />
That is very important. I think of all the things that have<br />
been said, the thing that is hitting and hurting people most<br />
is the telephone service. No-one specifically is to blame because<br />
it is a result of unparalleled growth on the Coast, but the main<br />
thing is to get it fixed and last time the Prime Minister was here<br />
I brought the General Manager of Telecom on the Coast to meet<br />
him. He is well aware of the problems, and it is one of the firs%~<br />
things that I will be taking up on the 22nd of February. ./ 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
Thompson Prime Minister, back to the point of the flat rate tax, which<br />
I hope it never comes in because it is hard enough to say as<br />
it is, but the National Country Party has been the advocate<br />
of this yet I believe that the National Farmer's Federation<br />
which I would think would be a supporter of the National Party,<br />
has found it necessary to oppose the National Country Party's<br />
ideas. Why do you think this is so?<br />
Prime Minister-<br />
Well, when Glen Sheil announced the details of the flat rate<br />
tax he said that he wanted to make up some of the shortfall<br />
with a 20% capital gains tax.-not on your house of residence,<br />
but on everything else that you might buy or sell. That<br />
immediately sends all the f armers up the wall but I think it<br />
would also send small businesses up the wall. ; This was one<br />
of the things we specifically rejected. The Labor Party had it.<br />
in their programme at the last election. I was very surprised<br />
to see Glen Sheil pick up a capital gains tax. The other side of<br />
it of course is that I was also surprised to see Joh. implyedly<br />
supporting it, because he had I give him credit for this he<br />
abolished death duties. He got in just before the Commonwealth<br />
in getting rid of death duties, but only just, and then to have<br />
him implyedly supporting policies that would replace a death duty<br />
on the dead with a death duty on the living which is what<br />
Glen Sheil's proposal would do I just do not think it makes<br />
sense and it would be a very regressive move for development in<br />
a vital area such as the Gold Coast. People starting a small<br />
business it is sometimes hard enough anyway. Well, to be landed<br />
with a capital gains tax would just make it that much harder.<br />
I am very much against it.<br />
Pet er White<br />
I just do not understand how any so-called anti-socialist<br />
party could propose such a tax, and it is causing a great deal of<br />
concern on the Coast. On the Coast particularly, because look<br />
at the property sales here on the Coast, and the economy would<br />
be killed overnight. Anyway, it has got no chance of coming in<br />
so I think we can dismiss it. for what it is.<br />
Thompson Prime Minister, what-then is the Liberal Party's attitude<br />
to taxation and do you have any plans for relief to what is<br />
considered to be a high rate of taxation? Personal.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Yes, I understand that. We are reviewing, as I think everyone<br />
is aware, the tax structure and the tax balance at the moment.<br />
To get reductions in tax overall, the only real way you can do it<br />
is by restraining expenditure. We have done that pretty vigourously / 4 </p>
<p>-4<br />
Prime Minister ( continued)<br />
over the last five years. Our. Public Servants which is one<br />
measure are 10,000 less in total than five years ago. Over<br />
the same period, the Queensland Public Service has risen.<br />
The whole service has risen, and I think by what was it?-<br />
in the years that Joh ' has been Premier. The expenditure<br />
per head has risen enormously in real terms over the last<br />
few years in this State. It is not just a question of restraint<br />
in expenditure on the part of the Commonwealth, but also on the<br />
part of the State, because the States and local government spend<br />
of all the taxes collected; we spend 50%. We have reduced<br />
taxes, we have abolished death duties, we have provided special<br />
incentives to industry, to tourists, and I know the one thing<br />
that many people would want is reduced income tax. Unless all<br />
Governments are prepared to restrain expenditure a good deal more<br />
than they have been up to the moment, and unless State Governments<br />
are prepared to join us in that, it is going to be very difficult<br />
to reduce income tax substantially unless at the same time you<br />
can replace it with another form of tax. People then go to<br />
indirect taxes as Mr. Anthony did the other day. would it be wise<br />
to take a decision that could add anything from 3% to 5% on<br />
Australia's rate of-inflation? We have struggled so hard to get<br />
that down, and it is a beacon right around the Western world because<br />
we have performed better. But if we put it up by a change in the<br />
balance of taxation this is the difficult question or matter<br />
of judgement that is going to be before the Federal. Government.<br />
But when we-have a Premier's Conference, especially in the light<br />
of the policies of this State, I will be looking for contributions<br />
from the Premiers to the general purpose of tax deduction in a<br />
very realistic way. There is now question of that. If this<br />
by election has convinced me of anything, it has convinced me<br />
perhaps that Joh would take that $ 500 million less for Queensland<br />
which his tax proposals will involve.<br />
Thompson You are. listening: to the voice of the Prime Minister, Mr. Fraser.<br />
He is wit~ h us in our twin-town studios at 97MW. If you would like<br />
to talk to the Prime Minister, our telephone number is 373344.<br />
We have a caller, Prime Minister and Mr. White, on the line right<br />
now, We have from Burleigh Heads, Mr. John Clark. Good afternoon<br />
John Clark.<br />
Caller Good afternoon, how are you.<br />
Thompson Fine thank you. Could.' you speak up a little bit please and would<br />
you like to pose your question? </p>
<p>FCaller Right. My question is to either the Prime Minister or Mr. White,<br />
and from the position of a swinging voter, particularly on say<br />
the capital gains tax or the 20% taxation that they are looking<br />
at bringing in not bringing, but Senator Sheil is campaiging<br />
for. How can we have a Coalition Government that is a National<br />
Country Party and also a Liberal Party Government, one Party*<br />
advocating, or with the candidate advocating that he would like<br />
a 20% tax, and another member of the opposite Party saying that<br />
is not going to happen. Where does that leave that swinging<br />
voter? Prime Minister<br />
The Government has the policies of Government and that is<br />
quite clear. At the moment as a Government we are examining<br />
the tax issue. Mr.-Anthony has said he is attracted to the flat<br />
rate tax concept but has said very plainly that it has got<br />
difficulties and he fully understands the financial difficulties<br />
in the proposal. It is true that the National Party in Queensland<br />
has a policy of flat rate tax, which as I indicated earlier would<br />
be-very inequitable on lower income people in the community and<br />
the Liberal Party will not and would not embrace it. The<br />
Divisions of the Liberal Party, the Divisions State Divisionsof<br />
the National Party all have bits and pieces of policy at<br />
different times. That does not mean to say they are necessarily<br />
the policies of the Federal Government. Obviously we take<br />
account of our organisations, but they are separate organisations<br />
and they do not determine the policy of the Government. That is<br />
determined by the Cabinet which is one Cabinet,:-one Coalition.<br />
Caller But don't. the people, don't the electors, have a chance, like<br />
to say when going for Senator Sheil for example, or ex-Senator<br />
Sheil, people voting for him are possibly going to be wanting this<br />
taxation to come in. Correct?<br />
Prime Minister-<br />
Well, it cannot come in, you see, because on the one hand you<br />
-cannotaffordit-a-flat rate tax. On-the other hand, if you-have<br />
an income of $ 9,000 which is lowish by today's standards and<br />
a dependent wife, your tax would go up by about 130%. If you have<br />
$ 50,000 and a dependent wife your tax would be halved. Now, I<br />
think that is a pretty inequitable proposal and any Party that<br />
tried to embrace that in terms of election policy in a serious way<br />
would I am quite certain be soundly defeated.<br />
Caller So what you are saying is that everybody that may vote for<br />
Mr. Sheil on that issue, is really wasting their vote.<br />
Mr. White<br />
Exactly. </p>
<p>-6<br />
Prime Minister<br />
They would be wasting their vote, because if it cannot<br />
Caller if you are totally against it.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
It would be wasting your vote because it could not come in.<br />
You cannot match it on financial grounds and in terms of equity<br />
it is a selfish proposal. But there is another side to this<br />
story. I used a figure of loss of revenue of about $ 5,000 million<br />
last time I was up here. Well, John Howard got that figure<br />
re-done and if you keep the present tax-free area nobody paying<br />
tax up to about $ 4,000 the cost is about $ 7,000 million and'<br />
when you come back to the tax-sharing arrangements we have with<br />
the States, Queensland's share of that is $ 500 million. Now what<br />
chance is there of Joh coming to the next Premier's Conference<br />
and saying " ah Malcolm, I am prepared to give up $ 500 million".<br />
That puts it into some sort of perspective.<br />
Caller It sounds very much like a swinging voter or a Country Party<br />
voter in the McPherson electorate is not going to really have<br />
any say then, is he. Any policy is being dictated by a Liberal<br />
Party. Prime Minister<br />
I am not dictating.<br />
Caller But'you -, have just said that it will not come in.<br />
Prime Mintister<br />
But it cannot you see.<br />
Caller Mr. White just said it won't come in.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
But it cannot come in because it is inequitable, and I hope<br />
you would agree that it is. Do you really think that for somebody<br />
on $ 9,000 with a dependent wife, that it would be a fair thing<br />
to increase that person's tax by 130%.<br />
Caller Possibly not. ./ 7 </p>
<p>-7<br />
Prime Minister<br />
No, well you see that was part of the proposal, so you are ' agreeing<br />
with me.<br />
Caller Right. Prime Minister<br />
And do you think it is fair, while you are doing that, to halve<br />
the tax on somebody on a more comfortable income of $ 50,000<br />
a year.<br />
Caller Hmmm. Mr. White<br />
Peter White here. I think what you said before -that it would be<br />
a wasted vote -is * correct, because Dr. Sheil knows very well tha~ t<br />
it has never been-proposed to the Government and it is not an<br />
-option open to the Government, however superficially attractive<br />
it might be. The sums just do not add up and no Government could.<br />
introduce it on financial grounds or on the grounds of social justice.<br />
Thompson Prime Minister, I wonder if I could ask a question right now.<br />
During the campaign Mr. White has raised the subject of the need<br />
for a new bridge over the Tweed River at Boyds Now is onre<br />
very . close the heart of 97M4W because we are trying as a community<br />
service to get~ a little bit of interest in getting some Governmen~ t<br />
funds from somewhere to build this bridge, at-least duplicated, or<br />
perhaps build a new one. I presume that you have been briefed<br />
on this particular campaign. Peter, have been on the job?<br />
Peter White<br />
No, I do not think we have got to that one today Ross. I just<br />
might throw a couple of comments in.<br />
Thompson Well before you do, what I wanted to bring up was the point that.<br />
the NSW. Premier, Mr. Wran, has already indicated that the NSW<br />
Government is not interested in building a new bridge, that their<br />
plan is to simply duplicate the existing bridge after they have<br />
completed the widening of the highway to six lanes. Now, to me<br />
there seems to be something gone totally wrong. I was going to ask<br />
the Prime Minister if there was anyway we could some Federal funds<br />
on this one. Perhaps you would like to explain first. / 8 </p>
<p>-8<br />
Peter White<br />
I think I must just set the background a little bit for him.<br />
We have a major problem in Doug Anthony's electorate here on<br />
the road, on the bridge, and of course what is good for the Coast<br />
is good for his electorate as well, in tourist terms. I have<br />
suggested that after the election that I go and see Doug Anthony<br />
and see if we can have a combined approach to try and remove that<br />
bottleneck because 85% of our tourists...<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Is it on a major highway, or national highway?<br />
Peter White<br />
Oh, yes, on the'Pacific Highway.<br />
Thompson-Number 1 highway, Prime Minister.<br />
Peter White<br />
-It is a major bottleneck-in this area, and with 85% of your<br />
people coming by road, it is something that we can perhaps have a<br />
joint approach to.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
If that is on the major highway, the national highway, that is a<br />
matter to take up with Ralph Hunt, because we have been trying to<br />
work to a situation a little more and more where we have greater<br />
responsibility for national highways, the States have more<br />
responsibilitj' for the arterial roads and make judgements in relation<br />
to that, but that we also support roads that are under the care of<br />
local governxnent. i-Therefore, that is a matter to take up with<br />
Ralph, and if it is possible for him to do something I am sure he<br />
will. Peter White<br />
I certainly intend taking it up with Ralph Hunt, but I thought if<br />
I could get Doug Anthony on side, it would be a bit of clout.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I have no doubt that would help.<br />
Thompson It covers both electorates. Prime Minister we have on the line<br />
Mr. Dawes of Murwillumbah who would like to talk to us about funding<br />
for over-70 pensioners. Mr. Dawes, good afternoon. ./ 9 </p>
<p>9-<br />
Caller Good afternoon.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
You come from Doug's country, do you?<br />
Caller Yes, I do indeed.-<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Right close by? I have never been to Murwillumbah. It must be<br />
nice country.<br />
Caller It is. It's great country, and a little bit wet at the mom6nt.<br />
That is all the better for the farmer and what have you.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
would sooner have too much'rather than too little water Ithink..<br />
Caller That is right.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I have seen a lot of droughts.<br />
Caller Mr. Prime Minister, the question that I would like to Ask you<br />
is: could the Federal Government give consideration to exempting<br />
the over-70 pensioner from the means-test.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
There is of course a base pension which people over 70 get, and<br />
then if they want to get additional pension, there is a means test<br />
for: it.;: It. all-comesbackto the -general level of -taxation that<br />
people want to pay. What we have been trying to do in recent times<br />
is to protect the person who has got no other income, and to provide<br />
maximum support and maximum increases in the areas where people are<br />
totally dependent upon Government. of course, if somebody over<br />
has no other resources, they do get the maximum pension. It is only<br />
for those who have some other income that might not qualify for it.<br />
It is a matter that has been judged in the past, but we believe that<br />
the welfare dollars ought to be spent more specifically for those<br />
who have got the greatest need. That is why we have not done<br />
what you suggest up to this point. I </p>
<p>10<br />
Thompson Again onthe subject of pensions, we have on the line Mr. Keep(?)<br />
from Tweed..; Heads.<br />
Caller<br />
14r. Prime Minister, I am a returned serviceman. A while ago you<br />
were talking with a chappie and you mentioned the fact that if<br />
anyone was working on below $ 9,000 per year, per annum, they would<br />
be of course on a very low wage.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I think I said it was a modest wage by today's standards, yes.<br />
Caller I would say most modest. Now, my wife and I and I served through<br />
the Middle East, the Islands, and Korea my wife and I areexisting<br />
on $ 50 per week. How-does that sound? Is anything going<br />
to be done about this.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
How is that worked out, because it is very hard to talk about an<br />
individual case unless you know all the details.<br />
Caller<br />
Well, it is-the same with everyone. When they reach a certain age,<br />
this is the commitment the Government feel that they have towards<br />
personal Prime Minister.<br />
Is this the Service pension you are talking about?<br />
Caller Service pension, yes.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Well, that * is not $ 50. between the two of you.<br />
Caller No, it is not $ 50. It is $ 50 each. That wojrks out at $ 5,000<br />
per year roughly, in my estimation.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
In terms of priorities for returned servicemen, what we do each<br />
year is to sit down with the RSL and go through with the National<br />
Executive the priorities of the National Executive for advances and<br />
improvements in payments for benefits to returned servicemen. / 11 </p>
<p>11<br />
Prime Minister ( continued)<br />
In the last two or three Budgets*. I have had quite specific<br />
talks with the National President, Sir William Keyes, and we will<br />
certainly continue that practice leading up to the next Budget.<br />
What we have tried to do in this area of assistance to ex-servicemen'.<br />
is to, as far as possible, meet the priorities that the League<br />
itself sets.<br />
Caller<br />
Whilst not going quite along with that sir, $ 7 per day, $ 7 per day,<br />
per person, to exist on in this particular day is very lucky to Even<br />
buy one shout in your company at the present time I imagine, of beer.<br />
I do not think this is very fair. I have contributed, besides<br />
leaving a family to carry on, and my father had nine children.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Well, that's a pretty good effort.<br />
Caller My word it is. Well I am afraid the Government are not giving anything<br />
-of! that effort that we have put into Australia back to us, sir.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Well, we are spending record sums<br />
Caller<br />
We know where they are being spent sir, but they are not being<br />
spent to keep the people alive.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Well, we are spending record sums on welfare, and in a number of<br />
areas we have indexed pensions twice a year. We have altered the<br />
earlier complex means test with an income-test whi-ch has helped<br />
quite a large number of people. In this last Budget in particular<br />
we have provided substantial additional.-. support to-welf are<br />
beneficiaries who have got dependent children. We did that<br />
because we ' thought...<br />
Caller If I may intercede there sir. Just one final point. ( Inaudible).<br />
Could you live on this?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I am not saying it would be easy, but let me give an example.<br />
I know youngsters who are out working and running a car on a net:<br />
wage of about... </p>
<p>12<br />
Caller I am not a youngster sir, I have lived my life and I have...<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Yes, but people can live on that sort of wage, because I have<br />
had my own kids do it when they have been jackarooing.<br />
Caller Are they fully paid?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Well, they are young, and they are learning a job so they are<br />
not necessarily on an award wage.<br />
Caller I put my best into my country sir, and I am not getting much<br />
back from it.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Again, what about taking that up through your own local RSL.<br />
Caller I have done sir, apparently they get as Mr. Yeo(?) said a<br />
couple of years ago we are getting nowhere.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I think the RSL has got quite a long way, and if take it up<br />
through the RSL and get the matter put on a priority in the<br />
National Executive's list, then that is something that can be<br />
looked at.<br />
Thompson We will leave Mr. Keep there. Thank you very much indeed, Mr. Keep,<br />
on that subject. I think we have had a fair go with your<br />
question.; We have another caller on the line now from Palm Beach<br />
on a similar subject, Prime Minister. It looks like this might<br />
be the sleeper issue of the campaign: pensioner earnings. And<br />
on the line, Mrs. Hegney of Palm Beach.<br />
Caller I was going to bring up this funny story about Dr. Sheil saying<br />
he is going to ( inaudible) for the pensioners being allowed to<br />
earn $ 50 a week. Now, I will tell you my story. Three years ago<br />
I was on a small invalid pension because my husband was earning.<br />
Then he died and I went to Social Security after ( inaudible) now<br />
I go on another pension. And they said " oh, no, it makes no<br />
difference", you go on a single invalid pension. I have two teenagers<br />
still at home, and they said in a couple of years you get the other<br />
pension automatically the aged pension. When I was on an invalid<br />
pension, with two teenagers at home, I got a letter that I was / 13 </p>
<p>13<br />
Caller ( continued)<br />
allowed first $ 1 and then $ 2 a week to earn, and if I earned<br />
more than $ 2 a week I would have to let them know immediately.<br />
Now, that was funny. Being an invalid, of course, I accept that.<br />
But now, because I am too old to be an invalid, Dr. Glen ( inaudible)<br />
is goin õ to go hellLi for leather to let me earn $ 50 a week. If'<br />
I had been able to earn any money, I would have never been on<br />
the Social Security. It is only since 1975 that I have not been<br />
able to work. Now, he is going to let me earn $ 50 a week, because<br />
I am an ex-invalid. I am sure my neighbours I live next door<br />
to a pensioner's unit the block I look at through my kitchen<br />
window have six pensioners in it. Three of them are over<br />
and the other three are between 76 and 80. They are all hell for<br />
leather getting their running boots out to start earning $ 50 a week.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I am not sure that that is going to be the best way to help people<br />
such as-yourselves.<br />
Caller Of course it is not.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
We have tried to do that in other ways, and I hope we have been<br />
able to help a bit. If there is any particular aspect of your<br />
own pension that you want me to look into, I would be very happy<br />
to do so, but not over the air. I could get somebody to contact<br />
you over the ' phone to take down any details.<br />
Caller Oh, it is just not me. There are many of us. Just because we are<br />
too old to be on an invalid pension, we can immediately go out<br />
and start earning money.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
It is really not a very practical proposal that I think has<br />
been put forward.<br />
Caller-No, it's not. These are ( inaudible) indirect taxes. Do you know<br />
I am on $ 79 a week, and have a 17 year old boy at home. He was<br />
on the dole until last week. He has a job now.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
How is he going?<br />
Caller Well he is not going very well because he has been trying to get<br />
an apprenticeship with motor mechanics for the last 13 months and<br />
he has done one year of tech college ( inaudible) / 14 </p>
<p>14<br />
Prime Minister-<br />
I wonder would it be possible to take your name and address<br />
and the name of your lad in case we can do anything about getting<br />
an apprenticeship.<br />
Caller-Oh, that would be terrific, yes, because he has ( inaudible)...<br />
and everywhere.<br />
Thompson We'll just get you to stay on the line if you would please<br />
Mrs. Hegney.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
And give that information to the station. I will follow it.<br />
up personally and I know Peter White will also.<br />
Caller Thank you very much.<br />
Thompson Thank you Mrs. Hegney. Peter, you are sitting there taking<br />
this all in, I can see that.<br />
Peter White<br />
It's nice to see someone else in the hot seat. It's nice to<br />
have such a heavyweight here taking it.<br />
Thompson Prime Minister, another on the subject of pensions from Ballaxnbal(?)<br />
we have Mr. Brunner on the line.<br />
Caller I am not a pensioner, or holding my hand out for more pensions.<br />
I was just harking back to the days of Bill Wentworth in 1972<br />
when he proposed a scheme for eliminating the means test.. It<br />
sounded very good at the time. You possibly remember the details.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I do. Yes I do.<br />
Caller-Mr. Whitlam killed all that-of course. And the Government, the<br />
Liberal Party, has not taken it up since. I wondered if there was<br />
any reason for not taking it, or I </p>
<p>15<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Yes. The reasons we have not taken it up is the overall cost<br />
of it, the implications for taxes generally on people who are<br />
already fairly highly taxed, and because we believe that the<br />
welfare dollars that we spend ought to be more specifically<br />
directed to those with a real need. You cannot do that if you<br />
are going to say that somebody over 70 with $ 100,000 a year is<br />
still entitled to the pension. So there is a means test.<br />
It is the only way really that you can help to concentrate the<br />
welfare dollars which are now very substantial on the people who<br />
need the help most.<br />
Caller Actually a feature of that scheme that seemed attractive to me<br />
not that I am an expert, I just look from the outside was.<br />
that in those days there was an age, a taxation allowance, where<br />
people over 65 were not taxed on a level pretty well double<br />
what others were. Like, the non-taxable income I think wars<br />
$ 1,500 in those days and over 65 it was $ 3,000.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Yes, there was an age-allowance, wasn't there?<br />
Caller Yes, there was an age allowance. The-sfeature of this scheme to<br />
me seemed to be that without a means test the person' s own income<br />
put toget;--her with the pension would sort of produce its own means<br />
test whereby it would become a taxable income over a period of time<br />
and the tax coming back on these taxable incomes would eventual. ly<br />
put a person in a position where he wouldn't want to get the<br />
pension anyway because it would be up with the tax. So it sort<br />
of evened itself out.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Wasn't it Mr. Whitlam who abolished the age allowance also?<br />
Caller He abolished the age allowance, yes. Has the Government considered<br />
bringing -that sort of thing in again?<br />
Prime Minister-<br />
We have looked a number of times at specific measures that might<br />
be provided to assist in this area, but we decided at the time of<br />
the last Budget for example, that the money we had available we<br />
should quite specifically spend in increasing the allowances for<br />
dependent children or in the Budget before in increasing the<br />
number of people eligible for the pensioner m * edical benefit card<br />
for example, and the extra dollars we spent in those ways, which<br />
is going quite specifically to areas of need. The age allowance<br />
it was a very useful thing. Maybe the time will come when we<br />
should look at it again. </p>
<p>16<br />
Thompson Okay, Mr. Brenner, thank you very much indeed for joining us<br />
on the open line this afternoon. We hope you have enjoyed<br />
your discussion with the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, you<br />
do have other pressing engagements I know, and a very busy<br />
afternoon. I think we have been given the nod that you<br />
are to move on. How are you feeling. Would you like:-to talk<br />
to some more, if there is..<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I would be delighted to more..<br />
Thompson Lovely, lovely." That is the sort of thing we like to hear..<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I am a captive. I often do what I am told to do.<br />
Thomp son<br />
-~ It is nice to have you make a decision for us.<br />
On the line we have John Melvin of Karoul(?). Good afternoon<br />
John. Caller Mr. Fraser, in the new elections or you are looking forward to<br />
putting on a straight tax for the people, there is some comment<br />
about under 9% is going to double our tax, but it is true that<br />
this will give the worker a lot more incentive to get out and<br />
do a lot more work?<br />
Pr ime Minister,<br />
Under the flat rate tax that Glen Sheil is proposing it is<br />
not part of the Liberal Party proposal the bloke on about<br />
$ 9,000 a year with a dependent spouse would have his tax increased<br />
by about 130%, which is an enormous increase on somebody with,..<br />
by today's standards, a relatively modest income. On the other<br />
hand, the bloke on $ 50,000 ayear with a wife would have had his<br />
income halved'. I-do not think that that would be really a very<br />
fair proposition. I suppose in a sense you could say everyone<br />
has got more incentive to work if we had no income tax, but that<br />
is not real life* because people want hospitals, they want<br />
schools, they want roads, and governments somehow or other have<br />
to provide it. We do have to try and restrain Government<br />
expenditure as much as possible, and that is the best way of<br />
making way for realistic tax cuts which will help people and<br />
families.<br />
Caller Is it true that in West Germany they have brought in . incenti~ e<br />
bonuses into enterprise so that the people who are given X amount<br />
of dollars for their work also get an X amount of dollars for<br />
a good job well done. / 17 </p>
<p>17<br />
Prime minister<br />
There might be. I would not know the details of that. I<br />
would be interested to look it up. But that is really like<br />
either a productivity payment or a payment for producing an<br />
extra amount, and some contracts and some people in Australia<br />
are already paid on that sort of basis. It is not always<br />
just a flat hourly or a flat weekly rate. A lot of people are<br />
paid on the basis of what they produce. Then, . the more they<br />
produce the more they earn in a week. I think that is a good<br />
thing. Caller There was a time a few years ago that I was working in a serviLce<br />
station and I took home, . for two weekends in a row, I took home<br />
less money than I took home for working one weekend. Can you<br />
see that that gives any incentive for a guy to go and work<br />
two weekends.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
No, I cannot. ' And that is one of the reasons why we introduced<br />
very substantial tax reforms four or five years ago, because<br />
the tax scales that-operated when we came into government had<br />
you 7 paying 45 in the dollar at $ 10,000 and 551 in the dollar<br />
at $ 15,000. Now, you are on a standard rate of 32 up to<br />
something over $ 17,000. This was to, as much as anything, to<br />
try and do away with that particular problem that you were<br />
talking about, because blokes were working overtime and they<br />
were get-ting into the 55 in the dollar bracket. Who would have<br />
incentive on that basis? But now many of those people are still<br />
on the 321 rate. We would love to be able to reduce taxes<br />
more, but it does get back to expenditure. Governments are a bit<br />
like families. We have to balance our books.<br />
Thompson John Melvin, thank you very much indeed. I hope that answers<br />
your question. We do have other calls, so let's take the next.<br />
one, coming up now Prime Minister, from Pottsville, we have<br />
Mrs. Ray Mitchell. Good afternoon to you Mrs. Mitchell.<br />
Caller!, Mr. Fraser, I represent a sea rescue organisation, and I<br />
was wondering if you could inform us as to how I could go about<br />
getting a grant for Government grant for our organisatior?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
You would basically have to go to the State authorities for<br />
that, because for these purposes, we provide general revenue<br />
funds to the States, and then they decide how the money ought<br />
to be spent. Generally, the Premiers are all telling me ' give<br />
us general purpose funds and we will decide how it is spent.<br />
We know better for Queensland than you would from Canberra'.<br />
I am happy to accept that sort of judgement, but it does mean<br />
that they have got to set their own priorities. What sea-rescue<br />
organisation are you part of, because they are terribly important<br />
r and they do a wonderful job, they really do. </p>
<p>18<br />
Caller Yes, I agree. It is Tweed Coast Sea Rescue. We are only a<br />
very small organisation at the moment, and with this growing<br />
area of ours we need a Government grant or some other way<br />
of getting funds-to purchase equipment.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Do you have a boat, and whatever.<br />
Caller A very small one. This is the thing. We need a bigger one<br />
at the moment. We have a rubber ducky at the moment.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Well some of them -they can still do a pretty job.<br />
Caller See our problem is shallow waters, that's why our members are<br />
after a depth(?) boat at the moment.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I think it would be a good thing to get on'-to your local<br />
member. Caller Mr. Anthony.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
And get him to~ do what he can. He can speak to the NSW<br />
authorities for you. If you like, I will take your name and<br />
address,. here and when I am seeing Doug tomorrow I will let him<br />
know that one of his constituents needs his help.<br />
Caller Yes, that would be great, I really would appreciate it.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Well, if you will give your name and address to the station,<br />
I will be very happy to pass that on for you.<br />
Caller<br />
Thank you very much Mr. Fraser.<br />
Thompson Thanks Mrs. Mitchell. . If you would like to stay on the line<br />
I know our switchboard will take your name and address and<br />
pass that on to the Prime Minister. ./ 19 </p>
<p>6 -19<br />
Thompson ( continued)<br />
Prime Minister, we have been given the word that we must<br />
let you go. It is to our great regret. our thanks to you<br />
for joining us on 97MW this afternoon, but we do hope that you.<br />
enjoy your stay on the Gold Coast and perhaps you don't have t~ o<br />
go through the turmoil that we do with telephones while you<br />
are here.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Well, thank you very much indeed. I am aware of the problems<br />
of telephones and I hope that Telecom's planning can fix the<br />
difficulties. Well, iJt has just got to. But thank for the<br />
opportunity of being able to speak with some of your listeners,<br />
and thank you for the opportunity to try and answer some of<br />
their questions. Maybe I can repeat it one day and come back<br />
when Peter is not the candidate, when he is the member.<br />
Thompson How lovely. Prime Minister, thank you very much indeed.<br />
