TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
ADDRESS AT THE PEARCE RAAF BASE, PERTH, 17 FEBRUARY 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
I would like to say how much I have enjoyed coming here and having a look<br />
at the base. I have had a long interest in the development of the Australian<br />
Airforce and from my first years in Parliament 25 years ago I used to go to the<br />
Commonwealth aircraft factories and the Government aircraft factories in<br />
Melbourne when we were still putting together the Mirage and the Macchi and<br />
I have taken an interest in the defence procurement issues over the years<br />
and I am always, I suppose, keen to see the new types of equipment and<br />
listen to what people have to say about them, about their capability and about<br />
which particular aircraft they like and why. Even though we can took at a<br />
technical specification of what they can do there is always that pilot feet that<br />
you can only get by talking to people who fly them and use them.<br />
Here in Perth, this is a major base in Australia for flying training and it is<br />
another one of those things which, I think, impacts well upon the economy of<br />
Western Australian. That is, the fact that we have a substantial defence<br />
presence here in Western Australia, both maritime and the presence here at<br />
Pearce and this is good for the economy and given the fact we have now<br />
transcontinental east coast and west coast defence bases and bases across<br />
the north of Australia, we can see the sophistication of the Australian<br />
Defence Force and its capabilities becoming evident to anybody that takes<br />
even a cursory interest.<br />
I am particularly delighted to see our friends here from Singapore with the<br />
Singapore Flying Training School. We are delighted to be able to be hosts to<br />
Singapore in the area of flying training and, I think, this has to be a<br />
forerunner of further defence co-operation between us and that we can in the<br />
future see with not simply the amenity of this field and the facilities here for<br />
Singapore, not just getting them to work right, but getting the relationships<br />
working completely and fully and co-operatively between the members of our<br />
airforce and your own. This means, I think, we can then take those next<br />
steps because we are both members of the Five Power Defence<br />
Arrangements, we have a lot in common we do joint exercises together<br />

Now this year we are celebrating remembering the 50th Anniversary of the<br />
end of the Second World War. VP Day Victory in the Pacific, and of course<br />
in Europe it is VE Day Victory in Europe: 1945 1995, half a century later.<br />
But it is not only a celebration of the democracies over fascism, it is a<br />
celebration of the combined community values and effort of that period of the<br />
War. We are celebrating the fact that as a nation we did something together,<br />
and they're celebrating in Europe that as nations they did things together.<br />
So, it is the action of communities together that bring the memorable social<br />
phases, and the memorable social changes. So that is why we say we move<br />
forward together we have values and considerations of one another, as a<br />
group, as a community and it is these cultural values which mark out the<br />
quality of our social democracy.<br />
So that goes to things like giving young people a chance to a full education,<br />
opportunity, inclusion. So university for instance and we just had Mr<br />
Flannagan tell us about Murdoch. When I was a young man, Universities<br />
were there for basically an elite a small elite. Now, as result of the policies<br />
of this Government, it's more generally available but I will come to that in a<br />
moment. And it is those opportunities, and the other thing about our social<br />
democracy is to say that in all of these things like access and equity access<br />
and fairness to health, to education, to aged-care, to support for the young<br />
that we have a community which has something nice about it something<br />
sweet about it that isn't about only giving the values to the values to the<br />
smart ones, or the rich ones and leaving the poor ones or the<br />
disadvantaged ones behind. In other words, again the sense of inclusion,<br />
the sense of community. Now, that's what we have a unique chance to do,<br />
and one of the reasons we can do it is because in this country we have<br />
strong rates of employment. In Western Australia, in the last year, we have<br />
had 5% employment growth. If we compare that, say, to any European state,<br />
they would be having 1 So you have got this huge growth and employment<br />
coming from the recovery which the Federal Government has sought to<br />
induce. And in the economy in this state this year it grew 10%. Now, you<br />
may say " well, is that a lot?". WellI I say to you that it's a real lot. Because of<br />
we kept it up for 10 years, we would on 10 years replicate that which has<br />
taken 150-200 years to produce. So, if you look at Western Australia over a<br />
century and a half, it has taken us that long to get this big, but in one year we<br />
have got 10% bigger. So if we did it for 10 years, we would actually<br />
reproduce the whole thing in terms of wealth in 10 years. That phenomenal<br />
growth, and phenomenal opportunity and phenomenal employment is the<br />
thing which gives us egalitarian values. Because you can't believe that you<br />
have a right to that sort of society without everybody having a right to a job.<br />
So, we have this great chance I can't think of any time when any young<br />
group of West Australians would have ever faced a period as exciting as this,<br />
or with opportunities like this. We're now for the first time in our history<br />
closest to the fastest growing markets of the world, that's in the Asia Pacific<br />
near us. When I was your age the markets we sold to were Western Europe<br />
and North America. We were a long way from the markets of the world. Now,<br />
the markets have shifted, and two-thirds of all we produce goes to Asia, and<br />
is right on our doorstep. So, all of you have that opportunity which I didn't </p>

3<br />
have, or most of us up on this stage didn't have, and as well as that, you have<br />
got the opportunities of education to go out into a clever country and take<br />
clever opportunities here and abroad. Ten years ago, only 3 young people in<br />
completed secondary school. That was an appalling statistic for any<br />
country that prided itself as being a smart country with good opportunities<br />
only three in ten completed secondary school. This year, it is 8 in 10, which<br />
has been a revolution in Australian education, and 40% of those young<br />
people are streaming their way into University. Forty per cent did also in<br />
1983, but it was 40% of 3 in 10, not 40% of 8 in 10. This Government has put<br />
around the country the equivalent of 16 Universities, the size of the major<br />
city universities, to take up the extra intake. And now we're reforming<br />
vocational education or TAFE through the Australian National Training<br />
Authority because the numbers speak for themselves. If 40% are going to<br />
university, what were the other 60% doing what were the majority doing?<br />
Well only a small proportion were being trained. But if we can train young<br />
Australians, and give them the chance through university, or through TAFE,<br />
then you could participate more fully in this country, and you can go out into<br />
the world and do it too. Now, none of that was available some of that was<br />
available to me but not all of that was because we never had these markets<br />
in this proximity to Asia, in terms of our trade, at that time.<br />
The other great change that makes this possibility, I think, the excitement of a<br />
social democracy of quality, is the participation of young women in education<br />
the high participation of young women in education. And it is a matter of<br />
great pleasure to me that in this year more young women have gone to<br />
universities than young men. Because always, it was young men who had<br />
that title, by a long margin. It is a measure of how far we have come. And<br />
the notion used to be, in families, that the boys or the young men were the<br />
ones who had to be the breadwinners, and where the opportunities and the<br />
effort and the family effort was given, but not so young women, or the girls.<br />
Now, there is something intrinsically unfair about that blatantly unfair. Why<br />
shouldn't the life opportunities and the excitement that this country can offer<br />
be equally available to women as to men, to young women as to young men.<br />
So, this huge participation in secondary schools from young women, and now<br />
them going into university is a measure of out social democracy. It is a<br />
measure of our fairness it's an essential fairness. It is a measure of the<br />
opportunities we must extend to our community as a whole.<br />
So, if you look at where we have come 10 years ago this was basically a<br />
country locked up by what are called tariffs protection for manufacturing.<br />
Western Australia was a mining and agricultural state we sold minerals<br />
because the Japanese needed it for steel. Had they not needed it for steel,<br />
we wouldn't have sold minerals. We would have basically been relying on<br />
agriculture with a few services in the city. The employment opportunities<br />
would have been vastly limited the chances of a full participation in<br />
education would have been simply a dream. But now you can see that<br />
because this Government has opened Australia up taken away the tariff<br />
barriers, opened up the financial markets we now have in Western Australia<br />
sophisticated manufacturing yesterday I was at a business that makes alloy<br />
steel for the Pratt and Whitney Jet Engine company for Boeing 747s. Could<br />
you imagine that there 10 years ago? Or making world-classed aluminium<br />

ferries for the world? It just wouldn't have happened 10 years ago. Or a<br />
sophisticated tourist industry, with high quality tourism services? All of these<br />
things have come because Australia has opened up and we are richer and<br />
smarter and better for it. But we can't drive this sort of change without an<br />
educated, trained population. And you know I gave some numbers for<br />
Germany the other day in Germany, for instance which is a highly<br />
developed country the information base of manufacturing lasts 5 years and<br />
then it is obsolete. And in information technology it lasts 2 years and then it<br />
is obsolete. So every 5 years, or 2 years, you have got to turn it over. This<br />
will be the same in Australia, which means that training will be the essence<br />
training and education will be the essence of your life opportunities, as<br />
technological change speeds up. But we are ready, and we have got the<br />
effort and the commitment and the financial commitment to give you that<br />
education, and that change.<br />
But one of the other thing I think it is important for you to know is this: I have<br />
always felt somewhat sad for young people who try and get their tertiary<br />
entrance examination, and then find they miss and they lose out on a tertiary<br />
education. Or worse, they have no vocational education. What we have in<br />
place now, with the Australian National Training Authority and vocational<br />
education or TAFE, is that you can go off to TAFE and do a course, and get<br />
accredited units to return to the mainstream of a university campus. In other<br />
words, it's not sudden death it's not a case of missing the TEE and missing<br />
out for life you can actually stream your way back as a mature student a<br />
couple of years later. You can say " look, I didn't do as well as I should have<br />
done with the Western Australian Certificate of Education, I haven't got my<br />
TEE, but what I'll do is I'll get into TAFE, and I'll get those marks, and I'll get<br />
that accreditation, and I'll go back to university". Or, alternatively, you will<br />
say ' look, in TAFE there are better courses for my place in the workforce than<br />
there are for me in university, so I am going to get a Diploma from a TAFE<br />
college". Now what we're trying to do the Federal Government is to keep<br />
the resources up to the university system and with the states to TAFE, so<br />
that you have got that chance. It is one thing us saying to you stay in<br />
secondary school, complete Year 12, but then after that we haven't got<br />
enough places for you. What we have had to do is build not only your<br />
participation in school, but the places for you. Now all that is there, and we<br />
have seen this great change ahead of us where you can participate.. . where<br />
you can go straight into university or to TAFE, or to TAFE and work your way<br />
back to university, or to open-learning and learn at home and those of you<br />
who have got a PC and given the fact that as we extend the fibre-optic cable<br />
network we are going to have PCs in many Australian homes you will be<br />
able to do the open-learning course at home. And that won't be for people<br />
just in remote areas, but actually for people in cities as well. So the<br />
educational opportunities are going to be profound, and then if you can get a<br />
link to somewhere like Murdoch University or the Maritime Industries, or the<br />
Navy, where you have got a particular focus as you have here in<br />
Rockingham on the Maritime Industry, and work associated with it and study<br />
and learning associated with it, then you have got another string to your bow<br />
another life opportunity. PM PRESS OFFICEQ~ 006/ 007 </p>

So, let me recap on all that. What do we face? We face a high growth, high<br />
opportunity country with low inflation. You have got opportunities in school<br />
and in post-school education that no generation before you ever had. You<br />
have got proximity to the fastest growing markets in the world, you have got<br />
the chance of learning another language in school, you have got a chance of<br />
using that language in Indonesia or Malaysia or Hong Kong or in China or in<br />
Japan or in any of these countries around us, and you can do it in the<br />
context of knowing that when you leave school, that huge employment growth<br />
that is just coming through is going to give you a fairly good chance of finding<br />
an interesting job. And doing it in the context of a society that cares about<br />
itself and has mutual commitments to one another where we actually say " if<br />
you're sick, we will look after you, if you're aged, we look after you, if you're<br />
from a low-income family, we give you income support. If you're a young<br />
person, we encourage you to stay in school, if you drop out, we give you<br />
training and work opportunities. If you are long-term unemployed, we pick<br />
you up and give you a job subsidy and we get you back into work'. In other<br />
words, policies that produce a society that has a kindliness about it, and a<br />
sense of decency about it.<br />
I think one of the great challenges for Australia is to infuse our young people<br />
with that sense of excitement to let you believe that the future is as exciting<br />
as I think it is. And to stay that we won't let any of our young people down,<br />
and we won't let them drop out of the system. Because a country that doesn't<br />
love its children has no soul at all. So, this is the future we are speaking of<br />
for you one which is about you, because the rest of us most of us we've<br />
had our corner of the action already, and their is already someone ready to<br />
pension us off, particularly in public life. Mind you, we resist it and fight it, but<br />
the fact is the wave that matters is you, and that's why your faith in Australia,<br />
and its ideals, become central to the sort of life you will have in the future. It<br />
is my pleasant duty here today to not simply talk to you, and have a chance to<br />
meet you, but to also underline this link you have with the Maritime Industries<br />
and with the Navy, and just to remind you of what a great opportunity that is.<br />
Now, Richard Flannagan asked me to unveil a plaque to make this point, and<br />
remember this event, and that for me, of course, is going to be a great<br />
pleasure, and which I'll do in a moment. But before I do, let me say the<br />
greatest pleasure here today for me is to talk to you because I always look<br />
forward to every opportunity to talk to young people, because you have got<br />
an open mind, you're hard thinkers, you're hard assessors you are not<br />
interested in nonsense and fairy floss, you want some real facts and some<br />
argument, and you're listening and you're hoping, and what more could any<br />
national leader want? Thank you very much indeed, and I will now unveil the<br />
plaque. ends. IQj007/ 007 </p>
