PRIME MINISTER'S PRESS CONFERENCE<br />
PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA<br />
TUESDAY, 26 AUGUST 1975<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I thought I might say a few things about the<br />
Budget at the outset. Tonight the Leader of the Opposition will<br />
have an opportunity to be precise in his criticisms of the Budget.<br />
He has made some general criticisms thatit'sa bad Budget and so<br />
on. He has also lamented many of the changes'brought about,<br />
particularly in the tax system. This seems to strike home very<br />
grievously to him, but anyrate he will be able to be precise. tonight,<br />
he will be expected to be precise.<br />
There is another thing however that I would like to say<br />
about the Opposition's approach to the Budget in general. Its been<br />
entirely destructive criticismt there have been no proposals<br />
from the Opposition, what they would have done if they were<br />
bringing down a budget in the present domestic or international<br />
situation; what deficit they would have had; what bounties or<br />
subsidies or remissions or concessions they would have made;<br />
what expenditures they would have initiated, what expenditures<br />
they would have retrenched. It is I believe a damaging thing<br />
in general that criticism should be'entirely negative this way.<br />
It just doesn't help business confidence, which is quite necessary<br />
to restore health to our economy, just to make generalised cries<br />
of doom and criticism. At least an alternative government ought<br />
to be precise, it should be constructive at least to that extent.<br />
Now I should say something about one of the features<br />
of this Budget which is quite epoch-making. It represents the<br />
biggest change in the taxation system which has ever been made<br />
in Aus-tralia. The present tax scales, of course, were introduced<br />
in 1954. Particularly the general approach of the<br />
taxation system as a result of this Budget's proposals will be<br />
very much more just. The people who will benefit from the tax<br />
changes are, overwhelmingly. those who have dependents~ and those<br />
who worki. harder, or longer will not be deterred by the very<br />
high rate of taxation which as applied to marginal incomes in<br />
their bracketc. This will have beneficial effect in industrial<br />
relations. People work be wanting to ask for too much from their<br />
employers or from the Arbitration system so as tb'. overcome the<br />
additional tax which they will have to pay. But there will be<br />
a very great number of Australians who will pay less tax airi<br />
there will be in fact, the number of taxpayers will be halt a<br />
million less than is at presentthe case. A lot of people won't<br />
have to fill in tax forms at all. And for everyone the tax forms<br />
will be simpler So the taxation system,. particularly in substituting<br />
rebates for concessions is a very equitable thing and very much<br />
more efficient. Now there is an addition or two of course. The<br />
concessions which the Budget has made for companies, in<br />
particular the rate of company tax will be lower than it has<br />
been for very many years and the double rates of depreciation,<br />
which were to cut out at the end of last June, wiIl be continued<br />
indefinitely. So, while no Budget, of course, would please<br />
everyone, no Budget would have applied the prescriptions of all<br />
the expertswin fact the experts don't agree among themselves,...<br />
but this Budget does recognise/ that there are basic irreconcilables<br />
and accept </p>
<p>2.<br />
but it makes the most of that contraint by a balanced and<br />
imaginative combination of measures.<br />
The next thing I wanted to say to you was to correct<br />
quite a spate of misrepresentations that some. of your<br />
newspapers have made. I want to make it quite plain that<br />
none of these misrepresentations have been signed by any of<br />
you or any of your colleagues. They seem to have come from<br />
the top of the management in each case. I give three<br />
instances: One was the Mirror last Wednesday in its editorial.<br />
It responded to the Treasurer, Bill Hayden's request<br />
that critics should be specific. And this comment was made:<br />
" We will be specific, Uthe editor says " While we don't question<br />
the( eventual need for an A. B. C. network of stereo FM<br />
stations, is it really necessary for the Government to spend<br />
a massive $ 132 million on it in this economically ailing year?"<br />
Now the sum of $ 132 million is the sum total in the Budget<br />
for every activity of the ABC. The amount which will be<br />
spent on stereo FM stations: is $ 616,000 and there will be also<br />
be $ 254,000 for the PMG. So it is rather an exaggeration.<br />
That is it willbe$ 870,000 will be spent this financial year,<br />
not $ 132 million. Now the next one is a relatively simpler misrepresentation.<br />
I noticed on Friday the Melbourne Truth said: " The Prime Minister<br />
Mr Whitlam, had a face-to-face showdown with his stormy Minister<br />
for Minerals and Energy, Mr Rex Connor, in his office at Parliament<br />
House yesterday." Then it says: " The Deputy Prime Minister,<br />
Mr Crean, the Treasurer, Mr Hayden, and the Senate Leader, Senator<br />
Wriedt, were present with Mr Whitlam during yesterdayt meeting.<br />
Then on the basis of that story, presumably, last Friday's<br />
Mirror said: " The Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam, had a face-to-face<br />
showdown with his Minister for Minerals and Energy, Mr Connor,<br />
at Parliament House, it was reported in Melbourne today." And<br />
that was from the Mirror's Melbourne office.<br />
Now in fact Mr Connor wasn't in my office at any time<br />
last Thursday. Senator Wriedt wasn't in my office at any time<br />
last Thursday. I don't recall having spoken to Senator Wriedt at<br />
any time last Thursday or having written to him. And I might<br />
easily have said hello to Rex Connor at Question Time on Tltursday<br />
ut I didn't write to him or speak to him anywhere on Thursday<br />
at all. The story is a complete fabrication.<br />
And the third thing is the" Australian On Saturday it<br />
lists a great number of projects for Chanceries and residences<br />
in other countries which the Government is includingamong its<br />
$ 53 million for those purposes!' And on Monday there was an<br />
editorial in the Australian on the same subject.<br />
Now it all flowed, I take it from an answer which I<br />
gave as representing the Foreign Minister, Senator Willesee last<br />
Thursday on these projects. It happens that all the expensive ones<br />
all the big ones, were approved by our predecessors.<br />
I </p>
<p>Now to be quite precise let me go through them. The cost<br />
of the Bangkok Chancery and Residence will be $ 5.8 million, approved<br />
by our predecessors. The renovat~ on] s and-electrical w7orksj'at:<br />
Australia House in London will be $ 477,400, approved by our<br />
predecessors. The Chancery and accommodation in Paris will be<br />
$ 18 and a half million, approved by our predecessors. The Chancery<br />
in Port Moresby will be $ 2 million, approved by our predecessors.<br />
The Chancery in Singapore will be $ 4.4 million, approved by our<br />
predecessors. And the extensions to the Chancery in Washington<br />
will be $ 4.6 million, approved by our predecetsors. And lastly<br />
the construction of the Chancery in Kuala Lumpur will be $ 4.2<br />
million approved by our predecessors.<br />
Now admittedly the question didn't ask when these projects<br />
were approved. It was assumed that we had approved them all.<br />
This year as anybody can see from the Budget we will be spending<br />
$ 3 million on overseas construction for Chanceries and Residences<br />
for our High Commissioners and our Ambassadors. But the whole<br />
of that amount that I read, that is all the big amounts were<br />
approved by our predecessors.<br />
It grieves me very much that Mr Peacock should have been<br />
reported in Saturday's Australian as saying: " Mr Whitlam's concept<br />
of open Government doesn't seem to extend to Opposition front-benchers.<br />
I haven't had a chance to see the figures yet but when I do so I<br />
may make some comment on them." That's the Australian of Saturday.<br />
Presumably Mr Peacock's comments were made on Friday. He got the<br />
answer on Thursday afternoon, b ecause no questions are printed<br />
in Hansard unless they are r , eceived by 5.30 in the afternoon. ' But<br />
in all events the editorial and the original story w~ ere grossly<br />
misplaced. / 4 </p>
<p>-4<br />
QUESTION: On the question of Timor. In your Statement<br />
about Timor today you mentioned the Government welcoming the<br />
outcome of talks in Dili and Macao.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I will say no more on the subject of Timor.<br />
I said that I would be reporting to the Parliament probably<br />
if there were other developments. I'll leave it at that.<br />
QUESTION: Well can I ask you about...?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, no I will not elaborate on the statement<br />
I made.<br />
QUESTION: Well there is a bit of ambiguity about<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No I don't believe so. Please I will not<br />
elaborate on the statement.<br />
QUESTION: No funds were allocated in the Budget for<br />
the Westwood extension of the Transcontinental Pipeline for<br />
the Northwest shelf. Is this project defunct or only<br />
postponed? And may I also enquire why no Chairman has been<br />
appointed to the Pipeline Authority as required by Section<br />
61( a) of the Pipeline Authority Act which was proclaimed more<br />
than 2 years ago?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't know.<br />
QUESTION: Prime Minister, the Gover-nment's obviously very<br />
satisfied with the Budget. Do you think that it will show its<br />
sati~ sfaction by ensuring that the Secretary of the Treasury,<br />
Sir Frederick Wheeler, has a long tenure of office?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: That will depend on his health and his conduct.<br />
QUESTION: What effect will the Government's entry into the<br />
manufacture of car engines, in Adelaide, have on the private<br />
sector? Referring to G. M. H. and Ford who claim that this will<br />
lead to unemployment in the industry?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't believe that the public is so readily<br />
moved by G. M. H. and Ford as they were last year. I trust that<br />
the Party isn't so readily moved by G. M. H. and Ford as it was at<br />
the end of last year. The proposal that the Government h'as made<br />
is that it should participate with the two Japanese col.-ipanies,<br />
Nissan and Toyota, and Chrysler, in setting up a four cylinder<br />
engine plant in Chrysler's premises in Adelaide Each party<br />
to take a quarter share in that enterprise. The overall interest<br />
that the Government has is that Australians should have a<br />
choice of Australian motorcars which is more consonant with what<br />
the consumers want. There can be no doubt that Australians would<br />
like more four cylinder motorcars. They're more manouverable,<br />
they're more economical, they are cleaner, and the difficulty<br />
up until now has been that if you wanted four cylinder motorcars<br />
they usually had to be imported and usually imported from Japan.<br />
So accordingly we are wanting to encourage the Japanese manufacturers<br />
to make the engine, which is the biggest component"' getting the<br />
Australian content, made in Australia. Australians shouldn't<br />
be forced if they want an Australian motorcar to choose between / 2 </p>
<p>those that the American subsidiaries have hitherto compelled<br />
them to make.<br />
QUESTION: Does the Government intend to introduce a Supply Bill<br />
before the passage of the Budget? And if so could you say for<br />
-what purposesthe money will be used?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No decision has been made on this.<br />
QUESTION: Are you planning a trip abroad for December/ January?<br />
And if so what stage have you reached regarding details?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No stage has been reached in any such plan.<br />
Quite obviously if I went away it would be over Christmas. I<br />
never miss any of the Parliamentary Session. No arrangements<br />
have been made for any overseas visit.<br />
QUESTION: I believe it was Sunday, you intimated that the<br />
Government hadn't quite reached full Open Government. How<br />
long do you expect this to take and under what circumstances<br />
would we arrive at a situation under which we could have Open<br />
Government? PRIME MINISTER: I haven't got the speech that I made on Sunday<br />
with me. I don't accept your summary of it. I did make a passing<br />
reference to the very glib questions and comments that so many<br />
of you put, that you-Lre entitled to know every item and detail<br />
of the decision-making process. I pointed out that Open Government<br />
means rather the fact that the public should know the options which<br />
the-decision-makers have, and that is something which the present<br />
Government has implemented very greatly indeed. The public knows<br />
to an exceptional extent, completely unprecedented extent, the<br />
advice which the Government receive I've been asked a question<br />
already about motorcars. The reports of the Industries Assistance<br />
Commission are published much more promptly than ever was the<br />
case with the old Tariff Board. But you go through the whole<br />
range of initiatives that my Government has taken and you will<br />
see that most of them have been based on reports-compiled by<br />
experts who' ye sought views and the experts~ views have been<br />
published. That is people now know what the options are. There<br />
is Open Government, particularly to that extent. The Government<br />
mightn't necessarily accept the advice that it receives but the<br />
public knows what the advice is. 1<br />
QUESTION: In the event of any of our nearneighbours finding<br />
themselves in the unfortunate circumstances of being involved in<br />
1. civil war, will Australia consider providing humanitarian aid<br />
to them?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes.<br />
QUESTION: Will it do so in terms of Portuguese East. Timor?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I'm not elaborating on the statement. ./ 3 </p>
<p>6<br />
QUESTION: Prime Minister, why won't you answer questions in<br />
relation to what's going on up there?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I've made a statement in the Parliament,<br />
3 hours ago, and I'm not going to elaborate on that statement.<br />
The situation is quite sensitive and I'm not going to respond<br />
to particular slants that you might want to give it.<br />
QUESTION: In April last year, you said that the Government<br />
would not extend agreements on foreign bases in Australia.<br />
Last Wednesday and again today you indicated that's changed,<br />
in the case of Pine Gapand some other bases. Can you tell us<br />
when the Government changed its mind and why?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The position hasn't changed. I gave an answer<br />
to a written question, a question on notice on this matter,<br />
last Thursday and the question stands.<br />
QUESTION: It's different from your attitude in April last year.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No it's not.<br />
QUESTION: Why has Australia dumped Papua New Guinea-if we are<br />
to believe Mr Somare?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: We haven't dumped Papua New Guinea. We are<br />
in fact assisting Papua New Guinea to the extent of some hundreds<br />
of millions of dollars every year. I promised early last year,<br />
I think it was, that in the course of last financial year, this<br />
and next, we would be contributing $ 500 million -to the P. N. G.<br />
Budget and we shall be. That incidentally is completely apart<br />
from any Defence expenditure.<br />
QUESTION: What bases were you talking about in April last year<br />
when you said that the Government would not extend agreements?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I haven't got, you're referring to a question<br />
that I answered without notice, I think about the 3rd April last<br />
year, wasn't that it? And I gave an answer last Thursday.<br />
I think you're referring to some comments which you very easily<br />
elicited from one of my colleagues who was never briefed on the<br />
purposes. I have stated all along that these facilities are not<br />
parts of any weapons system.<br />
QUESTION: When can we expect some clarification of the Government's<br />
joint venture with the Ranger Uranium parties../. for nearly a year?<br />
Peko/ E. Z.<br />
-PRIME MINISTER: Within the next couple of months I would expect.<br />
I would hope less time than that.<br />
QUESTION: Does the Government intend to press on with the<br />
establishment of the Australian Government Insurance Corporation?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes, of course. There is a gap in the insurance<br />
available to a very great number of Australians and furthermore<br />
the insurance available to a great number of other Australians<br />
is only available on terms which are too onerous. It'll be<br />
remembered that in the-election campaign in May last year, I<br />
stressed that the Australian Government Insurance Corporation / 11 </p>
<p>7.-<br />
would be set up to meet, for instance, the situation which<br />
was found to apply in Brisbane at the beginning of last year,<br />
and in Ipswich. There were a very great number of people who<br />
were not insured against the disasters which overwhelmed them.<br />
It was not possible for them to get that insurance from any of<br />
the normal companies or institutions. The only institution,<br />
I think, from which you were able to get fl ' ood insurance on<br />
reasonable terms, was the War Service Homes Insurance. -The<br />
other point I made was that insurance has been available very<br />
much more cheaply, not only from the War Service Homes Scheme,<br />
but also from the Commonwealth Savings Bank Scheme. So the<br />
Australian Government Insurance Corporation will give insurance<br />
where none is available at the moment and furthermore it will<br />
give insurance where it is at present available but on much more<br />
reasonable terms. I point out that despite all the propaganda<br />
that's been brought about the A. G. I. C. it wil. l have to pay its<br />
way; it will be subject to all Federal and State legislation.<br />
QUESTION: Are you considering using Mr Connor' s considerable<br />
talents in another area?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't answer questions concerning the future<br />
of my colleagues. I never have and I won't this time.<br />
QUESTION: The Adelaide family of Dr -Grady, a Geologist, somewhere<br />
in Timor. has * expressed concern about his safety. one report says that<br />
he is now in the hands of Fretilin supporters. What efforts, if<br />
any,. are being made to find out about this man?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't remember all the details. Every<br />
Australian known to be in Timor was contacted with the offer<br />
to be taken out, and I'm told that the only ones who didn't<br />
come out declined to do so of their own free will. There was<br />
a plane went in and got some other people out who had previously<br />
declined but these ones were able to be contacted after they<br />
had second thoughts. NoI forget the names.<br />
QUESTION: The Chairmanship of the Film, Radio and Television<br />
Board of the Australia Council has been vacant since the beginning<br />
of July and is apparently causing some problems in the operation<br />
of that Board. I was wondering, is any announcement imminent of a.<br />
replacement Chairman.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes it is.<br />
QUESTION: You can't say now who it will be?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No I will put it in the whole context. I<br />
approved it all last week, I think.<br />
QUESTION: It's been reported that a large number of the evacuees<br />
who arrived in Darwin on the Lloyd Bakke want to stay in Australia.<br />
What is the Government's attitude<br />
PRIME MINISTER: If there are sponsors, if there are relatives<br />
who have sponsors here well they're staying on the usual condition. </p>
<p>QUESTION: Could you tell us when the Government decided that<br />
it would renew the Pine Gap and also Northwest Cape and who<br />
made the decision Agreement<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The question to renew, it doesn't take that<br />
form. The facility continues unless steps are taken to end it.<br />
The situation to end it can't arise until the 9th December next<br />
that's the earliest date at which notice, a years notice, could<br />
be given to end the agreement. No such notice will be given,<br />
as I stated last Thursday.<br />
QUESTION: The Government's Uranium Policy Statement of the<br />
31 October 1974 said that the Government would consider<br />
separately the question of some earlier return for the shareholders<br />
of Queensland mines, Naranda and Pancontinental, they<br />
have had a rather hard trot from the Government's Uranium Policy.<br />
Has this question<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Wait a bit, wait a bit. You know what was said<br />
about Queensland Mines, by Mr Justice E. A. Woodward. You know<br />
that don't you?<br />
ANSWER: Yes.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: He recoimmended that no uranium lease should be<br />
granted to Queensland Mines. We accepted his recommendation.<br />
QUESTION: We've still got N~ anda and Pancontinental Sir.<br />
PRIMJE MINSITER: I forget the details there.<br />
QUESTION: But has the Government considered some earlier return<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I told you that this will be considered. I<br />
think I said within two months, I hoped earlier. And, of course,<br />
I would expect there will be a statement made then. I forget the<br />
details, but you mention Queensland Mines, you sought to cast<br />
the Government in a wrong light. The Queensland Mines was dealt<br />
with by the Rae Committee arnd was dealt: with by Mr Justice<br />
E. A. Woodward. The Government agrees with what they found.<br />
QUESTION: You have no doubt noted Mr Somare' s statementg that<br />
he might perhaps go elsewhere because of Australia' s reluiIctance<br />
to give it more money. Does that concern you and have ycu<br />
spoken to Mr Somare since he made those statements?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: It doesn't concern me. I haven't spoken to<br />
Mr Somare. I have written to him since we had a discussion on<br />
Monday week. But this question was dealt with in my Second<br />
Reading speech on the Papua New Guinea Independence Bill and<br />
the related legislation last Wednesday. Papua New Guinea will<br />
be independent on the 16th of next month. It is entitled, it<br />
is welcome to receive assistance from any country in the world.<br />
It would be compeltely inappropriate for us to look as if we<br />
resented that. There are other countries which are assisting<br />
P. N. G. as it is. There are some international financial<br />
institutions; there is New Zealand; and there are one or two<br />
other countries as well. It is perfectly natural for Papua </p>
<p>9<br />
New Guinea to get assistance wherever it can. I notice there<br />
was some suggestion that it was Mr Peacock made it<br />
that the Russians had promised some assistance. That matter<br />
was disposed of by Sir Maori Kiki, the P. N. G. Foreign Minister<br />
and by the Soviet Ambassador.<br />
QUESTION: On the night of the Budget, Mr Hawke said that he<br />
agreed that those people making projections of half a million<br />
unemployed by next year. Do you agree with Mr Hawke?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No.<br />
QUESTION: What information do you have concerning this?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The information that the Treasurer has. He<br />
was asked a question about this last Wednesday; he gave an<br />
answer; his answer was correct. I support it.<br />
QUESTION: Why is the Government refusing an export permit<br />
for Utah, the development of Norwich Park Coal Mines, as it's<br />
now going to get $ 6 a ton off it. And under what conditions<br />
would the Government give an export permit to the Norwich<br />
Park Coal Fields?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I think you'd better put that on notice. I-</p>
