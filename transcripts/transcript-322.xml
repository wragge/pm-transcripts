0 ASSOCIATED CHAMBERS OF MANUFACTURES OF AUSTRALIA<br />
BANQUET<br />
CANBERRA, 17TH MAY, 1961<br />
Speech by the PrimeMinister, , the Rt. Hon. R. G. Menzies<br />
Sir, Mr. ( Norman) Robertson, Your Excellencies, Gentlemen:<br />
When I was beguiled, as I was, into coming here<br />
tonight, quite a long time ago so long that I've forgotten I<br />
thought that this would be a very, very pleasant non-political<br />
affair. Of course to me that's wonderful rare but wonderful.<br />
Then your distinguished Director, against whom otherwise I have<br />
nothing, sent me a printed document and it began by the most<br />
concentrated blast against the Government that I lead ( Laughter)<br />
that I have read for a long time. And although I am a quiet'and<br />
uncontroversial fellowwhon I sat down to prepare myself for<br />
tonight I naturally directed myself to the opening paragraph. I<br />
made a lot of notes. Life has been intolerable for my Cabinet<br />
colleagues for days because they have all understood that I was<br />
getting ready for tonight.<br />
Having made some notes, and having had them typed by a<br />
typiste who, oddly enough, undarstood my handwriting, I showed<br />
them to my friend, the Treasurer. I had no idea that he was<br />
the patron saint of this appeal ( Laughter) well I don't dwell<br />
on this matter and when he read the first page of my rather<br />
abbreviated notes, he said: " I don't think I would say that;<br />
never start an argument unless you can finish it". ( Applause)<br />
Which shows that under ray careful tuition over many years he has<br />
learned a great deal. ( Laughter) So I tore up the first page of<br />
the notes which will deprive you of some of my more pungent<br />
paragraphs. But I think he was right.<br />
Because the truth is that we are here tonight I and<br />
John Mc?, Von, who is going to address you from the point of view<br />
of, whatever it is John, and Arthur Calwoll~ who will collect a<br />
few crumbs that fall from the capitalists' table ( Laughter)<br />
all of us, to say something to you, but it will all, I suppose,<br />
theoretically, be non-political.<br />
In a broad sense it is, because this is a great<br />
campaign. This is really, as somebody said, an historic event.<br />
I have never myself understood why m,-anufacturers in Australia<br />
should think that thoy were under attack, because I don't think<br />
they are. But if there are, in Australia, a few thousand people<br />
or, for all I know, a million or two of people, who still retain<br />
some prejudice against what Australia producos, then this<br />
campaign will fix them. ( Applause) For if there is one thing<br />
about which we can all agree it is, with our characteristic<br />
modesty, that whatever any other country does, we can do better.<br />
( Applause) Sir, it is because of that that I believe that nobody<br />
who takes a balanced view of Australia's present economy or<br />
future prospects, can possibly be, intelligeontly a possimist.<br />
I'm no pessimist ( about today I'm ' the most glorious optimist<br />
about tomorrow. Because if anybody can look around the world<br />
and find a country so young, so rapidly developing, which has<br />
achieved so much in two or three generations, then I would like<br />
to hear about it. And the fact is that this has been achieved<br />
in a few generations not b-cause of all-wise Governments, or<br />
pertinacious Oppositions and I can speak on behalf of both of<br />
thema in may time but by imagination and effort and skill on the<br />
part of our own people. </p>
<p>0 2.<br />
Now, Sir, of course it is quite true lot no admit<br />
this, or perhaps not adnit it, but claim it, and get it over<br />
anti-inflationary policies are occasionally necessary. I hope<br />
everybody understands that. They were necessary to deal with<br />
the great inflationary boon of last year. I don't think that<br />
anybody would seriously deny that. And yet, Sir, all antiinflationary<br />
measures nust be unpopular with nany and, let us<br />
confess it, are occasionally hostile to the material interests<br />
of some. In Australia we have, and we have had for a long tine,<br />
more than people realise, more than perhaps exists in other<br />
countries, efficient tariff machinery, now supplemented by<br />
emergency tariff provisions, about which ny colleague, the<br />
Minister for Trade, has had so much to do, and to say. With<br />
that protection Austalian nanufactur. ing has increased<br />
enormously, and I would like to say that the best proof of our<br />
capacity for the future is what has been done in the past. With<br />
respect, I remind you, that in these last 10 or 11 years I<br />
speak not in party torms, but only of the particular period<br />
concerning which I have had some special reason to know what<br />
goes on the developnent of Australian manufacturing has been<br />
phenomenal. The gross value of production in Australian<br />
factories has grown in that period by 252%. The raw materials<br />
used have grown by 240%. And that, at a time when the number<br />
of employees grew by 27% and the nurber of factories by 41%.<br />
I mention those figures, not because I expect you to<br />
carry them quite comfortably in your minds, but because I want<br />
to remind myself and you, that this country of ours is one in<br />
which skill and energy and imagination have produced results far<br />
beyond the percentage increase in our population. If that has<br />
happened it is very largely due to the fact that in Australia<br />
where the manufacturer was a curio at the turn of the century,<br />
manufacturing industry has proved itself to be the most flexible<br />
instrument of development. That has been a wonderful thing<br />
for Australia. Somebody has said we couldn't have absorbed annually<br />
100, 120, 130 thousand migrants, as we have done, first<br />
beginning under the imaginative prograrme sponsored by my<br />
opponent, my present opponent, the Leader of the Opposition<br />
( Applause) and since carried on, unless, in Australia, we<br />
possessed the genius, the energy, the imagination to produce in<br />
our factories the things that our people needed.<br />
And so, Sir, I am all for this campaign. I don't<br />
understand why anybody should need to be persuaded that Australia<br />
today has, in an industrial sense grown up. We are one of the<br />
industrial countries of the world. Ule are among the first ten<br />
trading nations of the world in actual absolute terms. And we<br />
have demonstrated that in our own country we can produce what<br />
our people need; and that more, and more, and more, we will<br />
produce what our people need. If any prejudice or snobbery<br />
stands in the way, then I hope the people of Australia will<br />
sweep it aside. There is nothing that others can do, I say<br />
modestly, that we can't do bettor.<br />
But, Sir, we have had our troubles. Indeed, I've<br />
gathered from my friends sitting to the left and right of me,<br />
who, with all the aiability in the world tell me what's wrJng<br />
with me, among other people that we have had, and are having<br />
our troubles. Because the truth is and let's face up to it<br />
that with all our expansion, with full employment, with much<br />
overtine, with large and growing production, we have not been<br />
able to satisfy the purchasing demand of our people without vast<br />
recourse to overseas supplies. Now, there is nothing </p>
<p>0 3.<br />
intrinsically wrong with that. If we are to sell to the rest of<br />
the world, if our great staple industries are to maintain<br />
themselves, we must be prepared to buy as well as to sell. But<br />
the interesting thing to me is that with all these expansions<br />
our demand for imports has grown and grown beyond the capacity<br />
of Australian industry to supply. That is why we are here tonignt<br />
engaging in the beginnings of an enterprise which is designed to<br />
increase the capacity of Australian industry to supply to match<br />
the demand by Australian people for what Australian industry can<br />
supply. But, Sir, apart from these passing phases and<br />
believe me about these things I am no miserable pessimist, not<br />
at all; I've been through a few fluctuations in my own political<br />
lifetime and I'm not dead yet what we must try to do, and this<br />
is of the essence of what we are here to consider tonight is to<br />
reduce the incidence and the frequency of short term problems by<br />
aiming at long-term policies. I'll explain that somewhat<br />
cryptic remark. We must, for example, increase the supply of locally<br />
produced goods so that there is not so great an unsatisfied<br />
demand to spill over into imports. Sir, even under the present<br />
policies dealing with relaxation of import restrictions which I<br />
know you, and for all I know others here tonight, have<br />
criticised, let me remind you that 82% of the additional<br />
imports since the " no licensing" decision of February of last<br />
year have been in rospect of plant, of material for manufacturers<br />
and for transport. To put it in concrete terms: of the Å“ 231<br />
million of extra imports which came in under that fateful<br />
decision no less than Å“ 190 million were, and I repeat, on account<br />
of plant and materials for manufacturers, and for transport. So,<br />
we are not to assume that all imports are fiercely competitive;<br />
or indeed that the great part of them will be fircely competitive.<br />
Now, the history of 10 years that I have referred to<br />
gives us the greatest possible cause to believe in our capacity<br />
for expansion in manufacture. But the real point that I am<br />
leading up to is this. ' Je will have periodical problems of<br />
balance of payments: they'll come and go and come and go so long<br />
as our exports are almost entirely those of primary products.<br />
This is something that we must get all our people to understand.<br />
But if we continue to have the vast percentage of our exports in<br />
wool and wheat, and meat, and the primary products of this<br />
country, great as they are, vital as they have been, and are, to<br />
Australia's economy, then of course, inevitably, if there is a<br />
drought our wheat exports will fall; if there are bad seasons in<br />
the cattle country of Australia our beef exports will fall; if<br />
the world is beguiled for some reason or another into lessening<br />
its demand for wool, then the price of wool will fall. We may<br />
find our export income fluctuating, not by a few millions, but<br />
by a hundred millions, by two hundred millions, by three hundred<br />
millions, in the course of 12 months. Many of the countries<br />
with whom we negotiate are unaware of this fact. It is the vital<br />
fact in Australia. It is the fact which distinguishes our<br />
country from almost any other country of magnitude that I know in<br />
the world. I can look back, as many of you can, to a time when we<br />
were almost entirely dependent on primary exports, almost<br />
entirely dependent on primary production. Then, when a world<br />
depression hit us we were almost defenceless. We had a<br />
percentage of unemployment in Australia which was, as we look at<br />
it now, and as we looked at it then, horrifying 25 to 30% of<br />
people in the great trade unions unemployed. That was because,<br />
economically, we stood on one foot: we were a primary producing<br />
country; we met the whole blast of the world's fall in prices. </p>
<p>Since then something has happened which should prevept<br />
anybody in Australia fron becoming a gloomy pessimist. W'e have<br />
developed an industrial structure, a manufacturing structure, in<br />
Australia which means that today we stand on both feds What<br />
happened in 1929-30, could not happen in Australia today; and it<br />
could not happen because we are not uneasily balanced on one<br />
foot, but have two feet to stand on and if one gives a little,<br />
at any rate we have the other one to rest our weight upon.<br />
Now Sir, that is our domestic position. But our<br />
domestic position will suffer from all the fluctuations that are<br />
involved in variations in our overseas balances, in variations<br />
in our overseas reserves, if our exports remain predominantly the<br />
exports of our farms and our fields. They are the items which,<br />
through no fault of their own, with all the industry with all<br />
the skill in the world, suffer from these world fluctuations,<br />
and from ses-: onl fluctuaL-ions at home. Therefore what I want<br />
to say to you suns itself up in this: That what we must aim at<br />
in Australia is not only to have a balanced domestic econoiy,<br />
as I believe we now have, hut to have a balanced economy in our<br />
export markets. If some day, and I am sure it will come, and<br />
cone more quickly as our population rises and as our pride and<br />
our skills grow, if some day half of the exports of Australia to<br />
the world are manufactured goods then to that extent we will not<br />
be subject to the wind and weather of a drought at hone, or of<br />
falling markets abroad. We will have produced in our international<br />
economy a sense of balance which we now have, and enjoy,<br />
at hone in our own country.<br />
Sir, we can't isolate ourselves from world affairs.<br />
If we seek so to isolate ourselves then we will forget all<br />
about the importance of costs, the importance of those basic<br />
conditions on which we can do business with the rest of the<br />
world. Therefore I believe that it is of the first order of<br />
national importance that manufacturing in Australia should<br />
become international in its product so that it sells to the<br />
rest of the world, and in particular sells to all those growing<br />
hundreds of millions of people, near to us in the world, nearer<br />
to us than to any other modern country remember that, nearer<br />
to us than any other modern industrial country. iJe must sell<br />
more, and more. That is why we do our best to raise their<br />
standards of living. That is the whole basis of the Colombo<br />
Plan, that is the whole basis of technical aid. We are not<br />
being kind we are engaging in an intelligent operation in<br />
international relations.<br />
Somebody put the figures in front of me the other day:<br />
in 1950 2,500 million people in the world. Subject to the wind<br />
and weather plague and pestilence, and war and disaster how<br />
many in 2000 A. D youFll be happy to know it will be after my<br />
time 6,000 million. In half a century 3,500 million more<br />
people in the world, all to be fod, all to be clothed, all to be<br />
housed, all to Le helped to reach a higher standard of living.<br />
What's wrong with us in Australia if we, placed as we are, can't<br />
undertake to supply to this groat area of the world and to these<br />
teeming millions of people in the world, something of what they<br />
require? Do we lack skill? I don't believe it. Do we lack<br />
courage? I don't believe it. Do we lack enterprise? I don't<br />
believe it. But if we are going to become a great exporting<br />
industrial nation then I'n quite certain, and you are quite<br />
certain, that we must realise that the essential foundation for<br />
a great industrial exporter is a great, faithful home market.<br />
( Applause) Sir, that's really what I wanted to say to you I'm<br />
forgetting about the rest of the notes that's what I really<br />
wanted to say to you. </p>
<p>Here we are, 10-million people. I have no tine for<br />
the pessimists. I think that people who talk depression without<br />
reason serve only to create deprossion in fact. I pay no<br />
attention to these people, though of course I have my responsibilities<br />
and so have my colleagues. But I look back to just<br />
before the second world war when the wisest statisticians that<br />
we could find, not only in this country, but from overseas, for<br />
we gathered then in, said that the population of Australia would,<br />
by 1975, be 71 millions and that thereafter it would begin to<br />
decline. Well gentlemen I permitted myself to say, at the time<br />
I wasn't Prine Minister and therefore I could speak quite<br />
freely ( Laughter) even to my colleagues " How do you know what<br />
the birth rate is going to be in future?" a very homely, and I<br />
think proper and human question. But anyhow there. it was, 71<br />
million by 1970, or 1975. And here we are, in 1961, with<br />
millions. Who is there so niserable in his mind, so circumscribed<br />
in his imaginative horizon as not to believe that by the turn of<br />
the century we will be 25 million people in '. ustralia? Who is<br />
there so timid about his Australian quality as to believe that<br />
with this growing population we won't develop, not only our<br />
skill, and our capacity for production, but our market at home<br />
to an extent which will enable us, on the basis of that market,<br />
to meet in the markets of the east, to say nothing of any other<br />
country, all the challenges of older cuntries, whether they be<br />
in America or in Europe. This is no time for pessimism; this<br />
is no time for sitting in the Club arm-chair and moaning about<br />
these stupid politicians. Because we always were stupid, from<br />
the beginning of tine. I can't remember a time when we weren't<br />
stupid. ,/ nd when I retire, either voluntarily, or involuntarily<br />
Arthur ( Laughter), I have no doubt that I will sit in the Club<br />
arm-chair and say, " Oh, they're so tiresome, these politicians".<br />
rAnd that will make me very popular with some people who don't<br />
like me very much. now.<br />
But, really, I say this to you as the Prime Minister<br />
of this wonderful country, this country that has grown so much,<br />
and has prospered so nuch, and has counted for so much, and has<br />
served the world so much, let's look forward to a tine, and it<br />
is not far distant when, with the support of our own people, a<br />
support, Sir, that you are going out to get in this campaign,<br />
there will be such an expansion of production in Australia, as<br />
will provide a foundation for an expansion into the world's<br />
markets which will in due course render Australia, if not<br />
iniune to, at least unshakeable by the economic incidents of the<br />
world. This is a very wonderful problem that we are considering;<br />
this is a superb conception that you have. And the reason that<br />
I came here was that I just wanted to say to you that however<br />
much I might challenge what I hear and read occasionally, from<br />
time to time, I have lived long enough to believe that first<br />
things ought to be put And the first thing that we have<br />
to do in . ustrclia is thing that I am talking about. Let<br />
us get the backing of our own country, and of our own people, for<br />
what is producc-l in Austr-lia and the day will come when one of<br />
ny successors in office w.. ll be able to say, with pride, and<br />
with justice, that ! ustr-iia's economy not only domestically,<br />
but internationally, is as sound as any in the world.<br />
Sir, I wish you the greatest of good luck in this<br />
campaign. </p>
