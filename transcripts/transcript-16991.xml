    <content><![CDATA[<p>Happy Christmas to all Australians.</p>
<p>Christmas is a time for families, for friends, and for loved ones.</p>
<p>It's a time of magic and wonder for our kids. A time to reflect on the year that's passed, and on the challenges for the year ahead.</p>
<p>Christmas is also a time to think about those who cannot be with their families and loved ones.</p>
<p>We think first of our troops in the field- whether they be in the Middle East, Afghanistan, the Solomons, East Timor, the Sudan, or elsewhere.</p>
<p>We thank them for the sacrifices they make in Australia's name.</p>
<p>And we think of those who have made the ultimate sacrifice, and those they have left behind.</p>
<p>2010 will also be a hard and bloody year in Afghanistan. Let us make sure that our soldiers in the field know that they always have our support back at home.</p>
<p>We think too of the thousands of Australians in distant lands who are working to improve the health, education and other opportunities for peoples much less fortunate than ourselves.</p>
<p>Here at home, we thank those Australians working in Emergency Services- the Police, the Fire fighters, the Ambulance workers, the doctors, the nurses, and everyone else who will be on duty and away from their families on Christmas Day, to help protect our community.</p>
<p>Christmas too is a sad time for those who have lost a loved one, suffered a family breakdown, or simply lost contact over the last year.</p>
<p>It's a time, therefore, to reach out to our friends, our neighbours, and people perhaps we may barely know, to extend the hand of friendship.</p>
<p>2009 has been a very difficult year for so many in our community.</p>
<p>For the thousands of people who lost loved ones, homes, and livelihoods in the Victorian bushfires, this Christmas will be particularly tough. And the thoughts and prayers of this great Australian family will be with you.</p>
<p>And while Australia has been spared the worst impact of the global financial crisis, many people have lost their job, or had their working hours cut back.</p>
<p>For many people, this Christmas will be a real battle just to make ends meet.</p>
<p>But what is great about Australia is that we continue to work together to help out our mates, and to help out complete strangers.</p>
<p>That is the essential spirit of this great nation, Australia- the nation that still believes in a fair go for all.</p>
<p>In February, when North Queensland was hit by floods, local communities not only helped each other out, they also donated money to help Victorians in the aftermath of the Black Saturday bushfires- and the help kept rolling in all year.</p>
<p>That's the Australian spirit at work.</p>
<p>Therese and I, and the kids, hope that your holiday will be relaxing. That you get the opportunity to recharge your batteries. And that you spend time with family, friends, and loved ones.</p>
<p>And for those of you travelling over the holiday period- please, please, please drive carefully. We all need to take extra care on our roads.</p>
<p>Wherever you are this Christmas- in our cities, in the 'burbs, in the bush, or on the beaches- on behalf of our family, I wish all Australians a restful Christmas, a happy Christmas, and a very happy New Year.</p>
