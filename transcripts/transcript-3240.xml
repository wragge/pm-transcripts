PRIME MINISTER 3 May 1974<br />
APPOINTMENT OF SIR JOHN4 CRAWFORD TO INDUSTRIES<br />
RSSISTANCE COMMISSION<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam, announced today that<br />
Sir John Crawford had been appointed an Associate of the<br />
Industries Assistance Commission, and will preside at the<br />
Commission's inquiries into rural reconstruction and the dairy<br />
industry. Mr Whitlam expressed appreciation for this further<br />
service to the community by an outstanding public servant whose<br />
dedication and objectivity have enabled him to advise successive<br />
Australian Governments, whatever their political persuasion.<br />
Mr Whitlam also said that the appointment of Sir John,<br />
a'man with very considerable insight and experience in rural<br />
industry matters, demonstrates in a practical way the benefits<br />
which flow from the flexible structure of the Commission. This<br />
flexibility makes it possible to appoint men o-f. eminence, or with<br />
special insights, for the Commission's inquiries which is<br />
especially important in cases where their other commitments<br />
prevent them from accepting a permanent appointment with the<br />
Commission. The Prime Minister said that this method of<br />
appointment would be of considerable use in involving men of the<br />
highest calibre from the business world in the work of the<br />
Commission.<br />
