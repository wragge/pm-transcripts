PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING, MP<br />
WOODCHIP EXPORTS<br />
On 22 December last year I announced that the Government would implement a<br />
program calculated to preserve the environmental values of our native forests<br />
and protect the interests of communities which depend on forest industries.<br />
As part of that program I announced that the Government was considering a<br />
rescheduling study of existing logging operations with a view to identifying areas<br />
of high environmental value which should be included in a comprehensive forest<br />
reserve system.<br />
Today I can announce that the Commonwealth has identified 509 such areas<br />
( coupes) and will do everything within its power to ensure their protection<br />
pending more detailed assessment of their values.<br />
Of the identified areas, 222 are on the Register of the National Estate. The<br />
remainder nevertheless have very significant wilderness, old-growth or other<br />
conservation values.<br />
Government policy is to protect these areas until their values are properly<br />
assessed as part of a national reserve system through the Regional Forest<br />
Agreement process.<br />
When applications for woodchip export licences are considered in future, and in<br />
administering licences, the Minister for Resources has indicated he will have<br />
regard to this policy and to the results of the rescheduling study.<br />
The Government also recognises that the recent Federal Court decision brings<br />
into question the validity of the 1995 licences.<br />

In view of the uncertainty this has created, the Government will invite woodchip<br />
companies to give up their licences and apply for new licences that will be<br />
Issued in conformance with the Federal Court decision.<br />
The Federal Court recognised the significant role for the Minister for the<br />
Environment in the process of considering export licence applications. In future,<br />
any new applications for licences will be considered by the Minister for<br />
Resources, and the Minister for Environment's role in this process under<br />
environmental legislation will be meticulously observed.<br />
I have asked the Minister for Resources to inform all woodchip companies and<br />
State governments of the areas the Government intends to protect.<br />
The Government believes that in future forest values should be assessed on a<br />
regional not coupe by coupe basis, to establish a representative reserve<br />
system and protect the future of communities. This underlies the Government's<br />
immediate concern to protect the 509 coupes already identified.<br />
The Government will work with the States to find the most effective way to end<br />
logging in these areas, pending their full assessment through the Regional<br />
Forest Agreement process.<br />
This will involve verification of the values of each area to ensure that all coupes<br />
proposed for rescheduling have retained conservation values sufficient for their<br />
incorporation into a national reserve system.<br />
In some instances, after all possible attempts at rescheduling have been made,<br />
the resources remaining to industry may be inadequate.<br />
In such cases, and in any others where the effects of the policy are detrimental<br />
to companies and communities, the Government will work in consultation with<br />
the industry, unions and the states to assess the need for industry assistance.<br />
The Government will consider the measures necessary to create a vigorous and<br />
internationally competitive wood-products industry. In developing such a<br />
restructuring package we will be concerned to keep the degree of economic and<br />
social adjustment to a minimum.<br />
Our principal aim is to end the present uncertainty so that workers and<br />
companies alike can feel secure about their future and investments can be made<br />
in value-added processing.<br />
Accelerating the Regional Forest Agreement process was a step in this direction. </p>
<p>TE: 2. a. 5122 o07P0<br />
3<br />
The Government's goal is to put in place, over the next five years, a program to<br />
adequately protect old-growth, wilderness and other high conservation value<br />
forests in a national reserve system, and to ensure that a high value added wood<br />
products industry can operate sustainably outside these areas.<br />
As soon as possible the Government will meet with the leaders of the woodchip<br />
industry, unions and the conservation movement to work out the best ways of<br />
refining and implementing our approach.<br />
National issues of this kind never have a simple solution. A great many people<br />
have a passionate interest in it, but it is the national interest which the<br />
Government must serve.<br />
And the national interest lies in finding the means by which an industry that is<br />
moving towards an ecologically sustainable future will not be curtailed and our<br />
forests will be adequately protected.<br />
