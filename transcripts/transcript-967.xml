FOR PRESS s P. M. 58/ 1964.-<br />
SIR JOHN LATHLAM<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon. Sir Robert Menzies<br />
Sir John Latham wasn one of the outstanding<br />
Australians of our time and he will not easily be forgotten.<br />
He gave a lifelong example of what could be done by a man<br />
of lofty and tenacious character whose devotion to duty<br />
was always backed by uncommon abilities and unflagging<br />
energy. It was my good fortune to be a law student<br />
under him and thereafter his junior and opponent at the<br />
Bar and his successor in Kooyong and in the Commonwealth<br />
Attorney-Generalship. I had good reason to know him well. To know<br />
him well was to understand the full nature of his contribution<br />
to our life as a nation and the deep springs from<br />
which that contribution came.<br />
CANBERRA, July, 1964.<br />
The Prime Minister waid that under normal circumstances<br />
Sir John Latham would have been accorded a btate<br />
? uneral by the Commonwealth Goveriment. However, some time<br />
ago Sir John made it known that this would be against his<br />
wishes, and this has since been confirmed by Sir John's<br />
family. The Prime Minister said instructions were being<br />
issued that flags on Commonwealth buildings throughout<br />
Australia should be at half-mast from sunrise to sunset<br />
on the day of the funeral, Tuesday 28th July. </p>
