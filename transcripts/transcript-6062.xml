' p TRANSCIF T PRlOOF ONU. f E. O. E.<br />
DECIATTN QOF VMLS. RQL-TYAY 21 7PCiI, 1983<br />
Firs. t~ v, of course, I'd lil: e to thank all of those who took~<br />
part in the electorate of Wills during the election period,<br />
especially in the circum= itancos when I~ could zpend virtually<br />
no tims here at all -and their magnificcnt efrt3, as well<br />
as camapaigning fcr the Party oa a whole, are reflected in tl-.<br />
-vo-rds that 1have Ju. t been read out. I thank you a. 3l m ost<br />
S incerely' for the work that you did on my 1beha1l and on behalf<br />
of the Party.<br />
0Juot a faconunents about the election generally. All I call say 3. s<br />
that if the election were being held today, I think we would hv c~<br />
even better. We had a magnificent result. We've got a rco:) d(<br />
Majority in the House of Representatives and the actual voteseem~<br />
s to be about the best since 1914. It's an unusual experience<br />
to go into the Caucus rocm now as wre did the ot her day, Land be<br />
sitting there with more than 100 people<br />
The results that we expected on the 5th March hay iontinued to<br />
be reflected here on Saturday in the Springvale Ey-eiection.<br />
It's quite remarkable to be there, Xfter so many elections the<br />
Labor Party going ahead again by a further I t', s no0t<br />
surprising that this is the case because I believe that what<br />
I was saying during the election campaign is being nowv refle~ cted<br />
in the truth. And that is that I expressed the view that the ecplc<br />
of Australia were going to revolt against the insult to their<br />
intelligence which was involved in the campaign of thc L:. bera.<br />
Party. They tried to say that the people of Australia who<br />
Q were concerned about unemployment, and concerned abcut the<br />
real issues which were affecting their daily lives the best the<br />
Liberal Party could do was talk about con=. unists under the bed<br />
and talk about the banks collapsing, and talk about money l. eavin~ g<br />
the country. They did a lot of damage to our country in that<br />
campaign. But the greatest damage they did was to themselves in<br />
in making the people of Australia realise -that they couldn't be<br />
trusted, if they were going to talk like that.<br />
With those things behind us we are going to be sure that in the<br />
governnernt of this country, with what is left of the Liberal<br />
Party in Opposition that they have the laciiiticcn prc. vided tc' hcm to<br />
play somne part in the proper processes of the arimn. are not<br />
cjjoing to be vindictive, we will * iive them the b!: efitSthtto.<br />
made available to us. And all I can say is that I c'nw Lr<br />
they will respond to what we're doing ard to what the verdict ef<br />
the Australian pople is. And the verdict of the ;% ustralian<br />
people is cl2oar. ThFy understand very clearly what the qreC3L<br />
economnic . problems,/' f-i~ t we'ye ihrtdfrom the T. ibor.-i1 ol<br />
They aire exnect ing us jirprozich c cor-,-truct . vo1y. I re<br />
doIrng thazt and it.' s tourcnratV c. of'nt:; v<br />
up and to live in 19 13 and not to u oe sthiey in~~ h<br />
campakigjn, that: thecy juc. t. ch-ea tvu; h n 1 r<br />

<p>2.<br />
All the events here in Victoria have shown that the natural<br />
party in Australia is the Labor Party. We now govern in Western<br />
Australia, in South Australia, Victoria, New South Wales and<br />
federally. And we will show by the way we govern at both State<br />
and Federal level that we are the natural party of government to<br />
the people of Australia. We will address ourselves to their<br />
problems. We, within Lhe very, very severe limitations that<br />
have been put upon us by the deception of the previous government,<br />
will move gradually to make this country a fairer and more decent<br />
place so that the ordinary people of Australia are going to<br />
have the opportunity of sharing in the great wealth of this<br />
country, so that their children can have an opportunity for the<br />
fulfilment of the talents within them.<br />
So, I conclude, as I began. I thanX the members of my Party<br />
the people of around here in Wills/ B9e been so good to me and<br />
the Party I thank you who are not in the party who have supported<br />
us so much. And I give you the pledge that in respect of this<br />
electorate Wills you have now a representative in the person<br />
of the Prime Minster of the country I will assure you, the<br />
electorate of Wills, that I won't let you down and that the<br />
Government that I have the great honour of leading, will do<br />
great things for this electorate, for this State and for this<br />
country, We are looking forward to a long period in Government<br />
to do the sorts of things that you want us to do..<br />
Thank you. </p>
