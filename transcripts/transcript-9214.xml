TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH SARAH MACDONALD, RADIO TRIPLE J, 5 MAY 1994<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
SM: This is quite a major initiative done, you are addressing Australia's<br />
biggest problems. Is it the most important policy you have ever<br />
released?<br />
PM: It is very hard to qualify the various statements. I mean, I think,<br />
probably the most important things in terms of the long run future of<br />
the Australian economy were done when I was Treasurer, and more<br />
recently, restoring the economy to the growth with One Nation in 1992.<br />
But this is an important statement of social policy. What we are saying<br />
here, we are not as a Labor Government prepared to leave a body of<br />
people 350-400,000 long term jemlyedpeople carry the brunt of<br />
economic change and economic adjustment.<br />
SM: When we look at people who are under 18 and who haven't got a job<br />
under this scheme, they will now get a new allowance instead of the<br />
dole, but it will be about the same amount of money. What's the point?<br />
PM: Well, the thing is, we will now case manage, that's personally, every<br />
young person under 18 who is unemployed. So, every young person<br />
who is under 18 and unemployed will have a relationship with a case<br />
manager, who will get to understand their personality, their educational<br />
attainment's, their work experience, their aptitude, what things they<br />
might be able to do, what training might be able to be given to them,<br />
what job placement might be able to be had for them, rather than being<br />
part of simply a relatively rigid national system of management of<br />
unemployment, it will be this personalised basis. And we think that<br />
because the economy has changed so much in the last ten years that<br />
a lot of the jobs that might have been available, say then, and ten<br />
years before that, for young people are simply not there. So, they<br />
have to be trained and they have to be managed. </p>
<p>SM: Well, on this training allowance it will be about $ 120.00 a week, it will<br />
depend on your parents income, but it won't change whether you are<br />
doing training or not. How do you think young people are going to go<br />
to work every day, a training place every day, clothe themselves and<br />
buy lunch on that sort of money?<br />
PM: Well, there are two things we are talking about here. We are talking<br />
about the youth training initiative, which is picking up unemployed<br />
people undeF1 8' nd giving them base management, training and a job<br />
placement, and there is the traineeships for people who are in work,<br />
and who are doing training. And as you know, the Government<br />
announced yesterday that it will be developing a training wage. The<br />
training wage will be well, by a very big margin, above $ 125.00 a<br />
week. Now, that training wage will provide on-the-job training and it<br />
will be, I think, a great advance. That is, a single rate across all<br />
industries, not just a multiplicity of training rates, but a single rate<br />
across all industries for people who are in training.<br />
SM: Now, if people are in training and they drop out they will lose that<br />
wage. Are you worried that employers will exploit them knowing that<br />
they can't leave?<br />
PM: No, I think the retention rates we are seeing with these labour market<br />
programs is quite high, and with case management it will get higher.<br />
That is, a greater proportion of people remain employed, and their self<br />
esteem goes up, and their feeling about themselves improves, and<br />
their capacity improves, and their value to an employer improves. The<br />
alternative is to take the heartless view that you see from some of<br />
these right wing people, say, " forget them, forget them, if they are not<br />
good enough to go through the school system and into university or<br />
TAFE, forget them."<br />
SM: At the end of a training period you are giving an employer a bit of a<br />
lurk, $ 500.00 if they keep the person on. Do you think that will be<br />
enough? I mean, how can you ensure that such programs mean real<br />
jobs and real careers at the end of training?<br />
PM: The real jobs don't come out, what you call real jobs this package is<br />
about training people who are disadvantaged who have been<br />
unemployed. It is not of its essence a job creation package, it is not<br />
supposed to be.<br />
SM: So you are relying on the economic recovery to find the jobs. When<br />
do you think that will happen, though?<br />
PM: Well there is a quarter of a million come through this year. A quarter<br />
of a million in the last 12 months. </p>
<p>SM: How much choice will people have in this individual case management<br />
when they are put on a training program? Say if a young person wants<br />
to manage a rock band, instead of being trained in tourism, how much<br />
choice will they get?<br />
PM: Well, it depends what their aptitude is, and what their interests are. I<br />
think that a case manager may respond well to somebody who has got<br />
some real musical capacity and some real management ability. But<br />
they won't respond well to somebody who wants to be a rock manager,<br />
but doesn't understand the music or the management, or doesn't have,<br />
seemingly, enough of an educational standard to be able to do it. So,<br />
there is in all these things, and particularly the job compact for those<br />
unemployed 18 months or more, there will be a great effort by the<br />
Government and the Commonwealth to case manage people, to give<br />
them training and a job subsidy and work experience. But there is a<br />
reciprocal obligation to take any reasonable job offer.<br />
SM: Well, what sort of reasonable job offer would that be, though? If it was<br />
in something they are totally not interested in, would they not have to<br />
do it?<br />
PM: They would have to do it.<br />
SM: They would.<br />
PM: They would. Otherwise we would be saying, well look, we will carry<br />
you financially while you decide whether you will do something or not.<br />
And remember here there is going to be a big effort in case<br />
management. The subsidies for these people will be up to $ 260.00 a<br />
week if they are unemployed for three years, if they are unemployed<br />
for over 18 months, over a year, that is $ 230.00 a week. Plus the<br />
costs of a training place in TAFE, it is a big public expense, and<br />
therefore, I think, people have got to say, " ok I will take what I can do,<br />
and what the case manager works out with me." It depends on the<br />
relationship that the person is going to develop with the case manager<br />
as well.<br />
SM: When young people and the long term unemployed are in training they<br />
won't show up in the unemployment figures. I mean, forgive me for<br />
being a bit cynical, but they will make the figures nice and low for the<br />
next election, won't it?<br />
PM: Well I won't forgive you for being cynical. Because if you think the<br />
Government is taking on this sort of work, have you see this White<br />
Paper..<br />
SM: Yes, I have.<br />
PM: Have you seen the work in it? I mean, it was an enormous amount of<br />
ministerial time and effort in this. This was something that I made a </p>
<p>commitment to in the last election campaign. The fact is, this<br />
Government will not accept the notion that comes from the Liberal<br />
Party and others that what we ought to have is basically a low rent, low<br />
wage society for people on the outer, and if you are really on the outer,<br />
too bad for you. It is only the achievers who get a crack at the national<br />
cake. That sort of society breeds all sorts of fractures in social<br />
cohesion and discontent and alienation, and it is simply unacceptable.<br />
That is why the Government is doing this. It is not about the<br />
unemployment numbers per se. But can I just say earlier, like, you<br />
were seeming to cast a doubt upon the fact that there won't be enough<br />
jobs in the economy growing. I will just remind you that between 1983<br />
and 1993 we had, in this economy, 2 million job growth. Ten years<br />
ago, eleven years ago when I was first sworn in as Treasurer we had a<br />
labour market of 6 million people. That is 8 million people today.<br />
Even with the unemployment we still created 2 million and hung onto<br />
them. So, already in this year we have seen 250,000 job growth. The<br />
economy is growing at 4 per cent, we are growing as fast, just about,<br />
as any other western country in the world. So basically the aggregate<br />
employment growth will be there, but the point of this policy is to make<br />
sure that everyone gets a crack at the stream of jobs.<br />
SM: And they are ready for those new jobs. Well, as the man in charge of<br />
the economy, where do you think those new jobs are? If you were<br />
looking for a job now and you had just left school, where would you be<br />
going?<br />
PM: The kind of jobs that were available when I was a teenager are not<br />
around now, because they have mostly been taken up by data<br />
processing equipment, and by fax transmission. I mean, all those<br />
transmission jobs which were around in the banking system, in the<br />
public service, in the 1960s, they are not there today, in retailing, they<br />
are not there today.<br />
SM: Which jobs are there today?<br />
PM: Trained jobs are there today. People with skills are there today. I<br />
mean, you look at the 1980s, we had no pfo6blem taking up large<br />
bodies of young people who were trained, but we will have problems<br />
taking up people who are untrained. And that is the point of this<br />
policy, we are saying, for those who wish to be in structured training,<br />
there is the traineeships and the training wage, and for those who are<br />
already, say, 16-19 who are unemployed there is a youth training<br />
initiative which will pick them up and case manage each one. So, we<br />
are saying that the period 15-19 should be a period of vocational<br />
preparation. That nobody should believe that you leave school at<br />
or 16 and you go out there and try and get a low paid job. You stay in<br />
school or you stay in structured training until you are in a position to<br />
take a job which this economy will now offer you. </p>
<p>SM: I was just wondering if you could give us, perhaps, a bit of a hint about<br />
where you think most of those jobs are going to be, though, so people<br />
can get themselves ready if they are still at school?<br />
PM: 80 per cent of Australia's national production is in the service sector of<br />
the economy. What is happening as Australia gets larger and<br />
wealthier, we are seeing greater sophistication in services, we are<br />
seeing it every day of the week<br />
SM: Ok, the service industries. Thank you very much for your time to<br />
Prime Minister, good to talk to you.<br />
PM: Pleasure. </p>
