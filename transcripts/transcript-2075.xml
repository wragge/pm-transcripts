YOUNG LIBERAL RALLY<br />
Caulfield Town Hall, Caulfield, Victoria 4 JULY 1969<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton<br />
It is a great pleasure to be introduced by a President who<br />
is obviously a scholar and a gentleman, and who has very great insight<br />
into my own mind sufficient to enable him to write what I actually fee!<br />
about the activities of the Young Liberals.<br />
And it is nice to be here at a period which was described<br />
by your President as a period of change. Because, you know, " the times<br />
they are a-changing", and how they change is going to be, I suppose in the<br />
first place, up to those of us who are now in the Federal Parliament or in<br />
the State Parliaments. But that is going to be influenced by what you think,<br />
not much influenced by what the Young Labor Movement thinks or the<br />
other people, but by what you think. And the directions that the changes<br />
may take are going to be of enormous importance to you as you get older<br />
and to the children that you want to grow up in a great Australia.<br />
I don't think that I have known a time when change is more<br />
in the air, both in our external policies and in our internal reappraisals<br />
of things which have for so long been taken for granted. It is a time when<br />
statements never previously questioned are increasingly subject to<br />
analysis and criticism. And, if I may say so, this is one of the healthiest<br />
things that can happen in a democracy.<br />
Let's look at some of the ways in which the times are<br />
changing. Let's first take the changes in our relations with the external<br />
world and peoples and countries outside of our own. We all grew up I<br />
grew up and all of my generation grew up and, indeed, our sons grew up<br />
in a world in which we in Australia were protected by Great Britain. We<br />
grew up in a world where countries to our near North which are now<br />
household words, Malaysia which includes a peninsula called Malaya!<br />
and Singapore were ruled by Great Britain. Indonesia was a colony of the<br />
Dutch. French Indo-China embraced Laos, Cambodia, North Vietnam and<br />
South Vietnam. There were no new countries in that region no selfgoverning<br />
countries in that region. Indeed, India itself was governed from<br />
Great Britain, and the protection and the peace of all that area of the world<br />
rested on the might of the British Navy and on that great major power which<br />
Britain used to be. / 2<br />
ILI, </p>
<p>-2 / 3<br />
We, ourselves, had no need to worry about our own security<br />
because it was guaranteed. We had no need to worry about our relationships<br />
with newly-independent nations because there weren't any. We had no need<br />
to be concerned with the region in which we lived because the region was a<br />
variety of colonial states. And so in those for us fairly easy days, we didn't<br />
have to look to our own security. In between wars, we didn't bother to keep<br />
anything but the sketchiest of a standing army or navy or air force. When<br />
the calls came, when our protector, Great Britain, was embroiled in some<br />
struggle in the world, then we responded responded in the Boer War, in<br />
the First World War and in the Second World War. But in between times,<br />
we didn't bother. We didn't need to. We didn't have to.<br />
And although since the end of the Second World War now<br />
what is it, 24 years away there have been these enormous changes to<br />
our north, it is only recently that the changes have really been brought<br />
home. This is because that power to which we previously looked for the<br />
protection of which I have spoken has said it is going from this area, and<br />
we must look, therefore, more than ever before, to ourselves and not to<br />
assistance from Great Britain. So we look for new allies, we look to build<br />
up our own defences and, above all, we look to participate with the other<br />
new peoples around us with the peoples of Indonesia, of Malaysia, of<br />
Singapore, of the Philippines to try in a co-operative way to improve the<br />
economic growth of these countries. Our aim must be to improve the<br />
income per head of these countries, to see that the improvements which<br />
flow from new technical advances, from new scientific approaches and<br />
from better business management are passed down the line, from the<br />
generals and the colonels and the majors and the captains, so that, if<br />
may so phrase it, the privates, the ordinary people in these countries,<br />
will see each year that there is a little more cloth for their families, a<br />
little more food a window into the future offering hope. This is something<br />
we have never had to do before until the times changed, but something which<br />
is a great challenge and a great inspiration to us, I believe. If we can do<br />
this, then we will not only be helping them but helping ourselves and<br />
helping our region by seeing that there is a stable, progressive, happy<br />
community built up in this part of the world.<br />
And the times are also changing in other ways. In the early<br />
days of Australia's history, it was Britain who sent the migrants to Australia,<br />
sometimes unwillingly in the early stages of our history, but who sent them<br />
to Australia. And it was British business houses that provided the capital<br />
for Australian industry, British business houses which bought the great<br />
cattle stations and which bought the land and which helped to develop our<br />
country almost exclusively. But now we are taking, to our immense<br />
benefit, and have been taking for some considerable time, people from<br />
many countries in the world from Hungary, from Poland, from Greece, </p>
<p>3-<br />
There is another field, and although you are a long way<br />
from requiring any assistance of the kind of which I am talking, I believe<br />
you are interested in it. There is another field in which the times are<br />
changing. There was a time when, without question, it was felt that<br />
somebody whose race of life was run and who had reached an age of<br />
retirement should be given some assistance from the State. But the<br />
approach was that this assistance should be merely some supplement<br />
to what the family could do for an aged person, or some supplement to<br />
the savings an aged person had been able to make. And this attitude<br />
persisted not only for aged people but for widows or for those who were<br />
*/ 4<br />
JA' fom Italy, from Turkey, from England, from the United States. From<br />
Iaolv er the world new citizens have been coming to us with their different<br />
cultures, with their different histories, with their different aspirations,<br />
with their new ways of cooking food we have gone from the days of steak<br />
and eggs! with their appreciation of a glass of wine with a meal, with<br />
their appreciation of different music, all adding a richness to the texture<br />
of our national life which, twenty years ago, we scarcely knew. And this<br />
is, I think, an essential for the building of any great nation -that there<br />
should be such an amalgam, that there should be so many different strands<br />
in this single strong rope of national existence.<br />
But one of the other changes which is co-existent with this<br />
is that we have begun to feel I think we have all begun to feel that while<br />
we still wish and must have this capital that Britain used to send us from<br />
abroad, we have reached a stage where we want, as a nation, as individuals,<br />
to have a chance to participate in the new developments taking place in<br />
Australia. I don't want to see young Liberals, when they reach the age of<br />
forty, or the sons and daughters of young Liberals, living in a country<br />
where all the major developments are owned by overseas interests, where<br />
the growth that those developments will experience, because of the growth<br />
of Australia, is not shared with Australians. And I think it has become<br />
well known now to those who have the capital and who are prepared to<br />
provide it, that they have a stable place in which to invest, but that we<br />
would like them to offer a chance to Australians to participate at the<br />
beginning of any great new development. And if such people wish to borrow<br />
money here to increase the development in which they are engqzged, then I<br />
think that the opportunity for such fixed interest borrowing should be in<br />
some way related to the opportunity they have given for equity participation<br />
by Australians. That's all. If an opportunity is given for participation<br />
I and is not accepted by Australians, then that's too bad. Let the development<br />
go ahead in any case, but let the opportunity be offered to us. And I am<br />
glad to say that more and more that opportunity is being provided by those<br />
from abroad who can give us the financial sinews from which we can develop<br />
our industrial muscles. But in a sense, this is an indication of change for<br />
this approach, I think, has not been so often enunciated before as it is now. </p>
<p>yelc -4<br />
in some other way handicapped. I think there is a different approach in<br />
fif Australia now. If there isn't, there ought to be and there will be. The<br />
approach should be rather, not this is just a supplement to what a family<br />
can do, but that there is a requirement in a civ ilised nation and a great<br />
nation to provide adequately for those who have been unable to provide for<br />
themselves so that they can live with a modicum of decency and without<br />
the fear of hunger and cold. This is a change that must be persevered with.<br />
How else are the times changing? Of course they are changing<br />
in the sense that there has never been as great a number of people employed<br />
so little unemployment in Australia as there is today. There has never<br />
been as great a spate of development as there is in Australia today of<br />
course tnat s true. Flow else are they chanig~<br />
One of the interesting facets of change is this question of<br />
0* dissent of which I think, Sir, you spoke. This is quite a fascinating subject<br />
~. J~ And one which must engage our minds. If anybody were to say to me " Are<br />
you in favour of dissent", the first answer I would have to give is, " How<br />
do I know until I know what you are dissenting against?". I might be in<br />
favour of something and therefore I wouldn't want myself to go out and<br />
dissent against it. But if anybody were to say to me, " Are you in favour<br />
of people being able to express dissent?", then there can only be one answer.<br />
That is, " Yes, one must defend the right of people to express dissent".<br />
As Voltaire said, " I disagree with what you say, but I will defend to the<br />
death your right to say it". So one must agree with the right of people to<br />
express dissent. But then if one goes further and says, " Do you agree<br />
that the right to express dissent carries with it the right to violence,<br />
carries with it the right to destruction", then there can only be one answer<br />
and that is, If people come along to a political meeting of any kind<br />
and seek to drown out the speaker and seek to prevent him putting his Views<br />
before the community, then they are not expressing dissent. They are<br />
expressing a fascist approach and they are denying the right of free speech.<br />
And if people congregate together with banners, they may, if they are<br />
peacefully exhibiting those banners, be properly expressing dissent; but<br />
if they congregate together and seek to attack a particular building or a<br />
particular person or to block the right of ordinary citizens to use a road,<br />
then again they are not expressing dissent. They are denying liberty to<br />
their fellow citizens. And this perhaps will be a question which will need<br />
closely to be examined by the community.<br />
We have seen some examples of this kind of violence of<br />
which I have spoken. It can only have two outcomes. Either it leads to<br />
counter-violence, as we saw in Germany, when one group who were<br />
dedicated to preventing their opponents expressing an opinion clashed<br />
violently with those who thought they had that right, and there were armed<br />
clashes in the street something we cannot tolerate. Or alternatively,<br />
4SAr4_ 41-1 </p>
<p>it can lead to the imposition of some kind of fascist, communist or<br />
authoritarian regime. And it is necessary that all our people should clearly<br />
know and clearly believe that dissent does not and cannot be allowed to<br />
extend to the use of violence, or to the denial of freedom of expression.<br />
We have never had this kind of problem in Australia before but that it is<br />
with us now I think there are few of you would deny.<br />
Let's look at another area of change. I spoke a little while<br />
ago of the great development now taking place in this land of ours. I don't<br />
know how many of you in this hall have been to Western Australia, have<br />
seen Port Hedland, Mt. Newman, Mt. Tom Price, have seen the place<br />
where Australians are laying each day a record length of railway line.<br />
Or how many of you have seen or felt the excitement in the air of the new<br />
frontiers, or how many have been to Cove, or how many have been to<br />
Weipa or Groote Eylandt or all the areas in Australia where great new<br />
advances are being made. But I do urge all of you who have the opportunity,<br />
who may have the opportunity in the future, to go to these places, to seize<br />
that opportunity with both hands. You will find it rewarding financially,<br />
because the wages paid there are very great. You won't find it uncomfortable<br />
as frontiers used to be, because now people live in air-conditioned houses<br />
and have supermarkets and swimming pools and they can be quite delightful<br />
places to live. But you will find that they have an air of growth, an<br />
excitement of growth, a general feeling which draws out from the individual,<br />
I believe, this response: " Here is a place where I can contribute. Here<br />
is a place where if I do something it will benefit not only me but the country<br />
in which I live and the other citizens of the country in which I live".<br />
And this brings me to the last subject I wish briefly to<br />
discuss under this title: " The Times They are A-Changing". There was<br />
a time when those who were born in Caulfield tended to grow up in Caulfield<br />
and retire in Caulfield. Those born in Malvern did the same. There was<br />
little travel in this nation of ours. There was little knowledge of the other<br />
parts of this nation. There was some interstate rivalry, some interstate<br />
jealousy but little feeling of national identity, except in time of war. And<br />
how that has changed, with the movement from State to State of those<br />
working for big companies, of those working in the public service, of those<br />
serving in the armed forces, of those who merely want a change. There<br />
has now grown up in Australia a population which spends some time in<br />
Melbourne, some in Sydney, some in Brisbane and some in the country, and<br />
sees the nation as a whole. This change, I think, has brought about a climate<br />
where we are all feeling much more than we have ever felt before, not<br />
that we live just for a municipality or for a city or for a state, but for a<br />
country, a nation which is already incipiently great and which is without<br />
doubt going to be a really great nation. / 6 </p>
<p>6-<br />
And there is a feeling, I think, of pleasure and pride in<br />
Victoria at the great iron ore developments in Western Australia or the<br />
bauxite development in Queensland or the new developments in Mt. isa.<br />
And there is a feeling of pleasure and pride in Western Australia at the<br />
Bass Strait oil and gas discoveries because there is a feeling this benefits<br />
all of us from wherever it may come, from wherever it is found it is in<br />
our country that it is found. It benefits all of us, it gives us all a chance<br />
to be richer as a nation. This is new, compared with twenty years; this<br />
is to be encouraged and I hope will be developed with your help.<br />
We will be a great industrial nation without doubt. We will,<br />
given proper compassion for those who are ill and sick, given proper<br />
opportunities to help others, be not only great materially but greater<br />
spiritually than we have been before. On the way we will need to work.<br />
On the way we will need to put in great effort. On the way, I hope we will<br />
keep a sense of humour and keep a knowledge that while effort is required,<br />
that while national unity is required, while hard work is required, yet<br />
there mumt be tirfie for laughter. and for gaiety and for song. And there<br />
must be a goal of giving an opportunity to each individual among us to<br />
develop his own capacities for his own purposes, to use the gifts he may<br />
have, whether they are as a great musician, a great actor, a great business<br />
tycoon, a great scientist, a great teacher. In whatever direction, to use<br />
those gifts to the top of his bent for his benefit as a human being and for<br />
the benefit of a nation.<br />
You will help us in this. You are helping us in this. The<br />
future is in your hands. This is why, Sir, you were so right when you<br />
said how pleased I was to come and talk to the Young Liberals and what<br />
an appreciation I had of the contribution they have to make and have made<br />
to this nation of ours. </p>
