    <content><![CDATA[<p> As we commemorate ANZAC Day on the eve of the new century, we</p>
<p> recognise as a nation that the greatest contribution to the freedom</p>
<p> and way of life that we will take with us into the new century has</p>
<p> been made by those who have fought for this country.</p>
<p>When we speak of ANZAC Day we recall the ordeal and death of so many</p>
<p> Australians Â all but those reckless, brave or blessed enough</p>
<p> to have escaped their destiny. Theirs is an example that demonstrates</p>
<p> that tyranny will never overcome the courage, tenacity and mateship</p>
<p> of ordinary men.</p>
<p>In all, over 100,000 Australian Servicemen and women remain where</p>
<p> they died in every continent and every ocean of the world over so</p>
<p> many different conflicts. These were Australians who lived in deeds</p>
<p> not years and have given us a legacy which ANZAC Day will always give</p>
<p> us cause to remember.</p>
<p>Their story remains relevant not to glorify war or to paint some romantic</p>
<p> picture of our history, but to draw useful instruction for our future.</p>
<p>As well as a day of reflection, ANZAC Day is a time for us all, including</p>
<p> younger generations, to reflect with humility and gratitude on our</p>
<p> history and on those great values which unite us all as Australians.</p>
