    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong></p>
<p>Mr President welcome, it’s great to see you again.</p>
<p>We had a great discussion at the Pacific Islands forum and congratulations on being the chair for the next Pacific Islands forum. We look forward to meeting with all of our neighbours in the Pacific in Nauru.</p>
<p>I hope you are having a good visit, I know Australia for you and your team is familiar territory but we really welcome you here.</p>
<p>I want to thank you for the great cooperation that Nauru shows in working together with us to combat this scourge of people smuggling.</p>
<p>Your efforts, your collaboration is so appreciated.</p>
<p>We have got a lot of other things to discuss - on development, growing the economies of the Pacific and of course in dealing with the big environmental challenges you face as well.</p>
<p>So welcome Mr President, it’s great to have you here in Sydney and in Australia.</p>
<p><strong>PRESIDENT OF NAURU:  </strong></p>
<p>It’s great to be here. We know who our friends are and we always try to work alongside them with this fight against people smuggling and I think the program is working very well.</p>
<p><strong>[ENDS]</strong></p>
