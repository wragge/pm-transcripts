SD<br />
FOR MEDIA 30 August 1983<br />
I was provided with the attached Opinion by the Attorney-<br />
General late yesterday. </p>
<p>,1,) AURTRA L 
SENATOR THE HON. GARETH EVANS ATTORNEY-GENERAL<br />
PARLIAMENT HOUSE<br />
CANBERRA A. C. T. 2600<br />
29 August 1983 GE: AOB<br />
The Hon R J Hawke AC MP<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Parliament House<br />
CANBERRA ACT 2600<br />
Dear Prime Minister,<br />
on 14 July you requested my opinion as to whether the<br />
conversation on the evening of 21 April 1983 between the<br />
then Special Minister of State, the Hon M J Young, and<br />
Mr E J Walsh, may have involved the commission of an<br />
offence under the Crimes Act 1914.<br />
On 18 July I wrote to you stating that in my view with<br />
which the Solicitor-General, Sir Maurice Byers QC,<br />
concurred the only relevant provision of the Crimes Act<br />
was s. 79( 3). I said that the possibility of a<br />
contravention of that sub-section could not be excluded,<br />
but that it was not possible to give any concluded opinion<br />
on the matter until more information as to the content of<br />
the conversation came to light, an~ d that for all practical<br />
purposes that would not occur until the relevant witnesses<br />
had given their testimony before the Royal Commission.<br />
The situation now is that the relevant testimony from<br />
Messrs Young, Walsh and Matheson has all been given and<br />
made available to me. ( The last of the publicly released<br />
parts of the transcript did not ( become available until 22<br />
August; on that day Mr Justice' Hope also made, on the<br />
application of Government counsgl, an order releasing to<br />
me, the Solicitor-General and certain senior officers of<br />
my Department the relevant partt of the " in confidence"<br />
transcript.) As a result of certain conflicts in that<br />
testimony, however, the factual situation remains less<br />
clear at this stage than I thought it would be when I<br />
wrote to you on 18 July.<br />
Because of that uncertainty, there is much to be said for<br />
my further opinion to you awaiting the findings of His<br />
Honour on this issue. But because of the time which has<br />
already elapsed and the natural desire of everyone </p>
<p>2<br />
concerned to have the question of criminal liability<br />
clarified as soon as possible so far as it is within my<br />
capacity as Attorney-General to do so I have felt<br />
obliged to give you, without further delay, the opinion<br />
you sought on the basis of the material now to hand. My<br />
task, you will appreciate, has not been an easy one.<br />
The Facts<br />
It is common ground that Mr Young conveyed certain<br />
information to Mr Walsh on the evening of 21 April.<br />
Mr Young has given evidence that he informed Mr Walsh that:<br />
the Government had that day been looking at a<br />
problem involving Messrs Matheson, Combe and<br />
Ivanov ( or " a Russian"), and that he ( Mr Walsh)<br />
ought to be careful in his dealings with the<br />
Commercial Bureau of Australia; and<br />
at the Ministers' meeting in question, some<br />
antagonism had been expressed toward Mr Matheson.<br />
Mr Young was asked in cross-examination whether he had<br />
said that there had been ASIO tapes or transcript at the<br />
meeting; he replied that he was unclear on that and could<br />
not recall making mention of it. He was not specifically<br />
asked whether he had said to Mr Walsh that Ivanov ( or the<br />
Russian) was to be expelled.<br />
Mr Walsh's account of the 21 April conversation was to the<br />
same general effect as Mr Young's, but added three<br />
specific matters of significance, viz. that Mr Young had<br />
said: " it had been an important meeting and a Russian<br />
was going to be expelled the next day";<br />
" Combe appeared to have had an association with<br />
the Russian who was to be expelled"; and<br />
" there were tapes and everything there, ASIO I<br />
think he said ASIO tape".<br />
Mr Matheson gave evidence as to what Mr Walsh had told him<br />
on 24 April as a result of what he ( Walsh) had learned at<br />
a " drinks meeting" on the evening of 21 April: this<br />
account is similar to the account of the Young-Walsh<br />
conversation in Mr Walsh's evidence, but adds in turn<br />
further matters, e. g. that the Director-General of ASIO,<br />
Mr Harvey Barnett, was present at the Ministers' meeting.<br />
For present purposes, however', I have set aside<br />
Mr Matheson's evidence. Not only would it be technically<br />
inadmissible in any proceedings against Mr Young ( I share </p>
<p>-3<br />
the view of the Solicitor-General in his appended opinion<br />
in this respect, although a contrary view based on the<br />
principle stated by Knox CJ and Dixon J in Morgan v.<br />
Babcock and Wilcox Ltd ( 1929) 43 CLR 163, at p. 173, is<br />
possibly arguable), but it would appear to be in any event<br />
of little probative value: by the time Mr Walsh spoke to<br />
Mr Matheson, Ivanov had been expelled and Mr Combe had<br />
himself spoken to Mr Matheson, and Mr Walsh acknowledged<br />
in cross-examination that it was " highly probable" that<br />
what he had told Mr Matheson was a combination of what<br />
Mr Young had said plus inferences or conclusions drawn<br />
from this.<br />
In ascertaining the facts of this matter, a choice is<br />
ultimately forced between Mr Walsh's account, which would<br />
certainly be admissible as evidence in any subsequent<br />
proceedings, and Mr Young's account, which would be<br />
admissible to the extent that he chose to make it so.<br />
Either the conversation was, as Mr Young recollected, very<br />
general in its terms mentioning the characters involved<br />
in the ministerial deliberations and little else or, as<br />
Mr Walsh recalled, it went into specifics, at least as to<br />
the imminent expulsion, the existence of an association<br />
between Mr Combe and the Russian, and the existence of<br />
ASIO tapes. On this difference, as will appear below, a<br />
good deal may well depend when it comes to the application<br />
of s. 79( 3).<br />
I should add that I have also noted, as possibly relevant<br />
to the final determination of these factual questions,<br />
Mr Young's evidence that he told Mr Rod Cameron ( and this<br />
was confirmed by Mr Cameron' s evidence) before lunch on 22<br />
April that the Government was going to " kick out a<br />
Russian", and repeated this to -the luncheon group<br />
including both Messrs Cameron and Walsh during the lunch<br />
itself. This, however, cuts both i. ays in its implications<br />
for the conversation of 21 April: it may be thought to<br />
assist Mr Walsh's account to the extent it makes more<br />
likely some reference by Mr Young to the expulsion, but it<br />
also assists Mr Young's account to the extent that it<br />
suggests Mr Walsh may well have confused the two occasions<br />
in his later recollection.<br />
It is neither necessary nor apprctpriate for me to weigh,<br />
balance and endeavour to decide the factual matters in<br />
issue. For present purposes, I shall proceed on the basis<br />
that findings in accordance with 4ither Mr Young's account<br />
or Mr Walsh's account are open.<br />
The Law<br />
I remain of the view that the' only possibly relevant<br />
provision in the Crimes Act is s. 79( 3). This reads in<br />
relevant part as follows: </p>
<p>-4<br />
" 79( 3) I f a person communicates prescribed<br />
information, to a person, other than<br />
a person to whom he is authorized to<br />
communicate it; or<br />
a person to whom it is, in the interest of<br />
the Commonwealth or a part of the Queen's<br />
dominions, his duty to communicate it,<br />
or permits a person, other than a person referred to<br />
in paragraph or to have access to it, he<br />
shall be guilty of an offence.<br />
Penalty: Imprisonment for two years."<br />
' Prescribed information" is defined, in turn, in s. 79( l)<br />
in relevant part as follows:<br />
" 79( l) For the purposes of this section<br />
information is prescribed information in relation to a<br />
person, if the person has it in his possession or<br />
control andit has been entrusted to the person by a<br />
Commonwealth officer or a person holding<br />
office under the Queen or he has made or<br />
obtained it owing to his position as a<br />
person who is or has been a Commonwealth<br />
officer;<br />
( ii) who holds or has held office under the<br />
Queen;<br />
and, by reason of its nature or the<br />
circumstances under w'. hich it was entrusted<br />
to him or it was made or obtained by him or<br />
for any other reas9n, it is his duty to<br />
treat it as secret;<br />
The crucial legal question is whether Mr Young can be said<br />
to have had a " duty" within the meaning of s. 79( l)( b) not<br />
to disclose to Mr Walsh what he d~ id disclose. As to the<br />
other legal tests that would have to be satisfied, it<br />
seems clear ( though not necessdrily completely beyond<br />
argument in every case) that wha~ t was communicated was<br />
" information" within the meaning of the elaborate<br />
definitions in s. 77( 1); that Mr Young had it in his own<br />
possession owing to his position -inter alia, as a person<br />
holding " office under the Queen' within the meaning of<br />
that expression in that Mr Walsh was not<br />
someone who fell into either of the exceptional categories<br />
of recipient spelt out in s. 79( 3)( a) and and that by<br />
being communicated to Mr Walsh, albeit in confidence, the<br />
information in question was not being treated as secret'<br />
within the meaning of </p>
<p>The duty to treat information as secret in s. 79 is<br />
one which arises for a person<br />
" by reason of its nature or the circumstances under<br />
which it was entrusted to him or it was made or<br />
obtained by him, or for any other reason"<br />
The language here, which directs attention to the<br />
particular context in which information is acquired, is in<br />
marked contrast to that which appears in s. 70( 1) of the<br />
Crimes Act:<br />
" 70( 1) A person who, being a Commonwealth officer,<br />
publishes or communicates, except to some person to<br />
whom he is authorized to publish or communicate it,<br />
any fact or document which comes to his knowledge, or<br />
into his possession, by virtue of his office, and<br />
which it is his duty not to disclose, shall be guilty<br />
of an offence."<br />
Professor Sawer ' has argued in a recent newspaper article<br />
( Canberra Times, 10 August 1983) that the duty referred to<br />
in s. 70 must mean a legal duty, i. e. one clearly imposed<br />
by some other statutory provision or rule of common law.<br />
He suggests that criminal courts would be very reluctant<br />
to construe an offence punishable by two years in gaol as<br />
extending to situations where the duty is merely a " moral<br />
obligation arising from convention, reasonable expectation<br />
and honourable relations between colleagues". This<br />
argument seems to me compelling in relation to s. 70, where<br />
the direction to the courts to determine whether or not a<br />
duty exists is stark and unadorned. But it is rather less<br />
so in relation to s. 79, to which Professor Sawer does not<br />
refer in the article cited.<br />
The difficulty is that in the latter section the courts<br />
are specifically directed to take 6ccount of, inter alia,<br />
" the nature of the information" or " the circumstances<br />
under which it was obtained". It may be possible to read<br />
down s. 79 and confine it to situations where there is some<br />
explicit pre-existing legal duty on the person in<br />
question, whether derived f rom. particular statutory<br />
prohibitions, public service regulations, employment<br />
relationships, express or implied contractual obligations,<br />
fiduciary duties or something of that kind ( as Professor<br />
Sawer has elsewhere suggested). But while the section so<br />
read down would still have some scope for operation, such<br />
a reading would give little or no effect to the statutory<br />
language requiring the court to look at the circumstances<br />
of the particular case.<br />
There may well be public policy considerations which<br />
should be weighed in the balance in determining whether<br />
s. 79 could ever have been intended to apply to Cabinet </p>
<p>-6<br />
Ministers in respect of Cabinet or Cabinet Committee<br />
business. Some of these are spelt out by Professor Sawer<br />
in the article mentioned. But while these may constitute<br />
additional grounds for concluding that the expression<br />
" Commonwealth officer" in s. 70 is not intended to include<br />
" Minister of the Crown", I believe they have much less<br />
force in the context of s. 79, where the reference to those<br />
holding " office under the Queen" is certainly broad enough<br />
to include Cabinet Ministers, but where the direction to<br />
the courts to take account of context in determining the<br />
existence or otherwise of a " duty" is also flexible enough<br />
to accommodate the kind of public policy concerns that<br />
naturally arise if Cabinet Ministers are to be within the<br />
scope of the section.<br />
While it would be clearly nonsensical not least because<br />
of the array of other sanctions that operate in<br />
Westminster parliamentary systems for Ministers to be<br />
subjected to two years gaol for, say, the premature<br />
disclosure, inadvertently or even deliberately, of some<br />
statutory appointment, it is difficult to see an<br />
overriding public policy reason why a Minister should not<br />
be as criminally liable as any other recipient of secret<br />
information for disclosing the location of a convoy in<br />
wartime. In my view, then, although the matter is by no means<br />
completely beyond doubt, information given to Cabinet<br />
Ministers in that capacity may be such as to create a duty<br />
not to disclose it, breach of which may be punishable<br />
under s. 79( 3): but everything depends on the nature of<br />
the information, and the circumstances in which it is<br />
obtained. The language elsewhere in s. 79 for example,<br />
the reference to purposes " prejudicial to the safety or<br />
defence of the Commonwealth"~ in sub-section suggests<br />
that the kind of information mos likely to attract the<br />
operation of the section would be sensitive material<br />
directly related to defence and security.<br />
Applying this approach to the, present matter, the<br />
significance of the difference bel~ ween Mr Young's account<br />
and Mr Walsh's account of their. conversation should be<br />
readily apparent.<br />
If the conversation was as limited in scope as Mr Young's<br />
recollection suggests, then it would be difficult to argue<br />
that s. 79( 3) had application. ' The problem involving<br />
Messrs Matheson, Combe and Ivanov could well have been<br />
merely about some trade matter, and in that case the<br />
significance of the information passed on would have been<br />
commercial or economic rather than having anything to do<br />
with matters of national security. While the disclosure<br />
of information of this kind might or might not properly<br />
attract other sanctions, criminal penalties would hardly </p>
<p>-7<br />
appear appropriate. It is likely that a judge would hold,<br />
as a matter of law, that s. 79( 3) had no application to<br />
such a situation; and if the matter did go to a jury, an<br />
acquittal would be overwhelmingly probable.<br />
If, on the other hand, Mr Walsh's account were to prevail,<br />
the question of the application of s. 79( 3) would be, in my<br />
view, much more finely balanced. As a matter of law, it<br />
is possible that an offence may have been committed. The<br />
information in question would be seen to squarely relate<br />
to national security and foreign affairs matters of great<br />
delicacy and sensitivity, and of such a nature that its<br />
premature disclosure would put at risk ongoing security<br />
and intelligence operations. While obviously still not in<br />
the same extreme category as the " 1convoy in wartime"<br />
example, nonetheless it would be much more difficult for<br />
either judge or jury to dismiss the existence of the<br />
necessary " duty".<br />
In formulating the above views, I have had the benefit of<br />
consultations with, and a formal written opinion from, the<br />
Solicitor-General, who has, in turn, discussed the legal<br />
issues with Mr M Gleeson QC, senior counsel for Mr Young.<br />
Sir Maurice' s Opinion, with which I generally concur, is<br />
appended to this letter.<br />
The Decision to Prosecute<br />
The decision as to whether or not to institute a criminal<br />
prosecution always depends in the first instance on the<br />
sufficiency of the evidence: whether it is such that it<br />
is more likely than not that the prosecution will result<br />
in a conviction. If the evidence in the present matter<br />
went no further than Mr Young's o~ in account, there would<br />
be no sufficient basis on which to proceed. Mr Walsh's<br />
evidence, however, makes it necessary to consider the<br />
matter further, and the following idiscussion proceeds, as<br />
it must, on what from Mr Young's point of view is this<br />
' worst case" assumption.<br />
In my letter of 18 July, I emphasised that merely because<br />
criminal proceedings could possibly lie in a particular<br />
case, it does not follow that they should be instituted.<br />
I retain as Attorney-General a * discretion as to the<br />
conduct of all Commonwealth criminal prosecutions, and may<br />
decline to prosecute if in my view the public interest so<br />
requires. Moreover, in the . specific context of<br />
prosecutions under Part VII of the Crimes Act, my consent<br />
is required before any proceedings can be instituted<br />
In considering this question I have had regard, as I<br />
foreshadowed in my previous letter, to the guidelines<br />
document, Prosecution Policy of the Commonwealth, tabled </p>
<p>8-<br />
in the Parliament in December 1982 by the Hon Neil Brown<br />
QC on behalf of the then Attorney-General, Senator Peter<br />
Durack QC. These guidelines state that it has never been<br />
the rule in Australia or in the United Kingdom that all<br />
offences brought to the knowledge of the authorities must<br />
be prosecuted, and identify a series of factors that can<br />
properly be applied in determining whether or not to<br />
prosecute. The most obviously applicable of these factors<br />
( I exclude for present purposes such considerations as<br />
" youth, age or special infirmity") are the following.<br />
Obscurity of the Law. This element is clearly<br />
present here, as is evident from the terms of both the<br />
Solicitor-General's opinion and my own: the issue of<br />
criminal liability, in our view, comes down ultimately to<br />
an assessment of what is required by the " nature" of the<br />
information, the " circumstances" of the case, and " any<br />
other reason" We are aware, moreover, that at least one<br />
distinguished constitutional expert ( Professor Sawer) has<br />
expressed a view of the law contrary to our own.<br />
Need for Deterrence. Criminal prosecution becomes<br />
less necessary to the extent that other sanctions of<br />
deterrent value attach to the behaviour in question. In<br />
the official secrets area, sanctions that have been<br />
traditionally regarded as applicable and appropriate to<br />
Ministers are not those of the criminal law but the<br />
political sanctions of resignation or dismissal. The<br />
sanction of resignation has already, of course, applied in<br />
the present case.<br />
It is worth noting in this respect that in Australia no<br />
prosecution has ever been instituted under the official<br />
secrets provisions of the Crimes Aqt against a Minister or<br />
ex-Minister. The same is true in Britain: no prosecution<br />
under the Official Secrets Act hias ever been instituted<br />
against a Minister or ex-Minister ( Report of the Committee<br />
of Privy Councillors on Ministerial Memoirs ( 1976, Cmnd.<br />
6386)). It has been stated, moreoever, that the<br />
obligation of Cabinet secrecy has often been disregarded<br />
with impunity ( Halsbury's Laws ofA England, 4th ed., vol.<br />
8, p. 702). No similarly weighty authority for this latter<br />
proposition is available in Aust , ralia, but nor would it<br />
appear to be needed.<br />
Seriousness of Offence and Degree of Culpability.<br />
Although the disclosure of the specific matters described<br />
in Mr Walsh's account would potentially have been very<br />
serious in terms particularly of what it would reveal<br />
about, and the way in which it might have interfered with,<br />
security operations it does not appear, in the event,<br />
that any such damage occurred. Nor was there, obviously,<br />
any intention to harm Australia's defence, security or<br />
international relations. </p>
<p>9-<br />
One other factor which I have felt it proper to take into<br />
account, particularly in the context of any exercise of my<br />
statutory role under s. 85, is that a conviction under<br />
s. 79( 3) of the Crimes Act, which is punishable by two<br />
years imprisonment, would result, even if no actual gaol<br />
term were imposed, in Mr Young's automatic<br />
d~ isqualification from the Parliament. This follows from<br />
the draconian terms of s. 44 ( ii) of the Constitution:<br />
" Any person who<br />
( ii) has been convicted and is under sentence, or<br />
subject to be sentenced, for any offence<br />
punishable under the law of the Commonwealth or<br />
of a State by imprisonment for one year or longer:<br />
shall be incapable of being chosen or of sitting as a<br />
senator or member of the House of Representatives."<br />
This gives further weight to the argument that the<br />
traditional political sanctions are the appropriate ones<br />
for all but the most extraordinary and dangerous<br />
ministerial breaches of official secrecy.<br />
Taking all these considerations into account ( and also<br />
bearing in mind, in turn, their likely impact on a jury in<br />
the event that a matter did go to trial), I have concluded<br />
that the case is not one in which criminal proceedings<br />
would be appropriate in the public interest.<br />
To the extent that issues of larger public interest are<br />
involved in this matter, they are, already being examined<br />
by His Honour Mr Justice Hope pu1rsuant to his present<br />
terms of reference. While it may be that some of the<br />
issues I have had to consider, fol~ lowing your reference to<br />
me, will also be considered by the' Royal Commissioner, my<br />
decision on the particular question of criminal<br />
prosecution for which, as Attorney-General, I have the<br />
ultimate constitutional, and in the case of s. 79,<br />
statutory, responsibility shoula not be regarded as in<br />
any way pre-empting His Honour's findings on the matters<br />
in issue before him. Certainly my response to your<br />
request has not been so intended.<br />
Yours sincerely,<br />
GARETH EVANS </p>
<p>POSSIBLE PROCEEDINGS UNDER<br />
SECTION 79( 3) OF THE CRIM. ES ACT<br />
OPINION<br />
My opinion is sought whether on the evidence given<br />
before the Royal Commission on Australia's Security and<br />
Intelligence Agencies the view is open that the then Special<br />
Minister of State, the Honourable M. J. Young, may have been<br />
in breach of section 79( 3) of the Crimes Act.<br />
2. Mr E. J. Walsh gave evidence before the Royal<br />
Commission of a conversation which he said he had with the<br />
then Special Minister of State, the Honourable M. J. Young,<br />
on the evening of 21 April 1983 and of a subsequent<br />
conversation with Mr Matheson which he conceded " highly"<br />
probably was a combination of some things Mr Young had said<br />
to him and certain inferences or conclusions Mr Walsh had<br />
drawn from things that were said to him 2952). 1<br />
accordingly disregard it. There is no substantial ground<br />
to believe that Mr Matheson's account of Mr Walsh's conversation<br />
with him would be admissible in proceedings against<br />
Mr Young. Section 6DD of the Royal Commissions Act makes<br />
Mr Young's evidence before the Comr~ ission inadmissible<br />
against him in proceedings under section 79( 3) of the Crimes<br />
Act. The only immediately relevant account therefore is<br />
that of Mr Walsh. I shall later discuss what Mr Young said.<br />
3. 1 should in fairness add here that Mr Young's account<br />
of his conversation differs markedly from Mr Walsh's as to<br />
the matters disclosed and that obviously I cannot, nor do I<br />
attempt to, choose between them. / 2 </p>
<p>2.<br />
Mr Walsh's Account<br />
4. M'r Walsh said that Mr Young told him on the evening<br />
of 21 April that there had been an important meeting and that<br />
a Russian was going to be expelled the following day; that<br />
Combe appeared to have had an association with the Russian<br />
who was to be expelled; that Matheson ( or the Commercial<br />
Bureau) had in fact got a bagging and had been mentioned<br />
several times at the meeting and that Mr Young said something<br />
like there were tapes and everything there ASIO tapes he<br />
thought was said. Mr Young had begun by saying that Walsh<br />
should be careful in dealing with Matheson or with Commercial<br />
Bureau and by advising him ( Walsh) that his ( Young's) remarks<br />
were to be regarded as confidential.<br />
Section 79 of the Crimes Act<br />
The first question is the meaning of this difficult<br />
provision. Sub-section provides, so far as is relevant,<br />
" 79. If a person communicates..<br />
prescribed information to a person,<br />
other thana<br />
person to whom he is authorized<br />
to communicate it; or I<br />
a person to whom it is, in the<br />
interest of the Commonwealth or a<br />
part of the Queen's dopninions, his<br />
duty to communicate it,<br />
or permits a person, other than a person<br />
referred to in paragraph or to<br />
have access to it, he shall be guilty of<br />
an offence<br />
" Information" is defined in section 77( l) to mean information<br />
of any kind whatsoever whether true or false and whether<br />
in a material form or not and includes an opinion and<br />
a report of a conversation. / 3 </p>
<p>6. By sub-section of section 77 information<br />
may be conmmunicated whether what is communicated consists<br />
of the whole or part of what is obtained or whether the<br />
information itself or only the substance, effect or<br />
description of the information is communicated. The<br />
expression " prescribed infor-mation" is defined by section<br />
79( l), the material parts of which are as follows:<br />
For the purpose of this section<br />
information is prescribed information in<br />
relation to a person, if the person has<br />
it in his possession or control and<br />
it has been entrusted to the person<br />
by a Commonwealth officer or a person<br />
holding office under the Queen or he<br />
has made or obtained it owing to his<br />
position as a person<br />
Wi who is or has been a Commonwealth<br />
officer;<br />
( ii) who holds or has held office under<br />
the Queen;<br />
( iii) who holds or has~ held a contract<br />
made on behalf o~ f the Queen or the<br />
Commonwealth;<br />
( iv) who is or has been employed by or<br />
under a person to whom a preceding<br />
sub-paragraph of this paragraph<br />
applies; or<br />
acting with the permission of a<br />
Mini ster<br />
and by reason of its nature or the<br />
circumstances under which it was entrusted<br />
to him or it was made or obtained by him<br />
or for any other reason, it is his duty<br />
to treat it as secret; 1 / 4 </p>
<p>7. One of the issues before the R~ oyal Commission is<br />
'( was there any unauthorised or improper disclosure by any<br />
and what Minister of the information made available to the<br />
NIS Committee concerning the relationship between Combe and<br />
] ivanov before 11 May": Issue No. 17. As it seems to me<br />
nothing has appeared which suggests that Mr Walsh was a<br />
person to whom either paragraph or of sub-section<br />
applies. And it is reasonably clear that Mr Young obtained<br />
information relating to Ivanov' s activities and ASIO's<br />
surveillance at the meetings of the National Intelligence<br />
Security Committee of Cabinet owing to his position as a<br />
person who held office under the Queen ( section 79 ( ii)<br />
of the Crimes Act), for his membership of that Committee was<br />
due to his being a Minister of the Crown.<br />
8. The questions in the present case turn upon whether<br />
that information and the decision that Ivanov should be<br />
expelled was by reason of its nature or the circumstances<br />
under which it was obtained or for any other reason such that<br />
it was his duty to keep it secret.<br />
9. Paragraph of sub-section requires more than<br />
that a Minister person who holds office under the Queen")<br />
obtain the information owing to his position, for, as well,<br />
the information by reason of its nature or the circumstances<br />
under which it was obtained or for some other reason must<br />
raise a duty to treat it as secret.<br />
Should a Minister in time of war obtain information<br />
of proposed troop movements, the nature of the information<br />
would raise the duty. And it would nonetheless raise it in </p>
<p>the absence of any other statutory or common law obligation<br />
to keep it secret. By secret is meant " kept from public<br />
knowledge or from the knowledge of specified persons":<br />
Shorter Oxford Dictionary Vol. 2 p. 1924. And information<br />
innocuous in itself may be obtained in circumstances where<br />
the effect of its publication is sufficient to raise the duty;<br />
for example, a decision to extend the duration or change the<br />
conditions of issue of patents of a particular class by<br />
amendments to the Patents Act where disclosure would be<br />
unfair. The essence of this paragraph of sub-section ( 1)<br />
lies in the -information obtained. It is not merely the<br />
communication of a Cabinet decision or breaches of Cabinet<br />
confidentiality. The fact that information was given to<br />
Ministers is one of the factors relevant to determine whether<br />
the duty was raised, but'it is one factor only. While<br />
decisions of the Cabinet may amount to prescribed information,<br />
they are not, irrespective of their subject matter, of<br />
necessity so.<br />
11. This means that the standprd for determining whether<br />
a duty exists is set by the sub-section and hence, while a<br />
duty imposed by another law or by ap obligation of confidence<br />
may be sufficient ( because worked on by the sub-section) it<br />
is not essential. The decision of -the Western Australian<br />
Supreme Court in Cortis R. / 19797WAR 30 by comparing the<br />
language of section 81 of the Criminal Code with section 79( l)<br />
of the Crimes Act rather supports this view. See also Grant<br />
v. Headland ( 1977) 17 ACTR 2 9 at 31. / 6 </p>
<p>12. It may, 1 think, be right to say of section 70 of<br />
the Act that some exterior obligation must be found either in<br />
Statute or the common law which raises the " duty not to disclose",<br />
breach of which the two sub-sections punish. But that<br />
section, unlike section 79, contains no machinery by which the<br />
duty must be ascertained. The crucial point of distinction<br />
between them is that section 79 contains in sub-section ( 1)<br />
the statement of the conditions which raise the duty while<br />
section 70 assumes its exterior existence.<br />
13. I should add that I do not think Mr Young's oath of<br />
secrecy as an Executive Counicillor is here relevant. It may<br />
be that that oath could be understood, where Cabinet discussion<br />
preceded formal recommendation to the Council, as extending to<br />
those discussions. But whether or not this is so,. nothing of<br />
that sort here occurred.<br />
14. Arnd, of course, a Minister must have a wide discretion<br />
as to the persons to whom-, he may reveal information on matters<br />
within his constitutional responsibiaity. The present<br />
disclosure, as I understand it, does not fall within that class.<br />
Conclusion It is now necessary to refer to Mr Young's evidence<br />
before the Commission. This is because, while section 6DD of<br />
the Royal Commissions Act provides that a statement or<br />
disclosure made by a witness in the course of giving evidence<br />
before a Commission is not admissible against him, it does<br />
not exclude him from using what he has said should he desire<br />
and be able to do so. Mr Young told Mr Walsh in strictest<br />
confidence that the Government had that day been looking at a<br />
/ 7 </p>
<p>problem concerning Mr Matheson, Mr Combe and lvanov or a<br />
Russian and that Walsh ought to be very careful. He went on<br />
to say that one of the Ministers had evidenced antagonism<br />
towards Mr Matheson. It will be seen that this account differs<br />
markedly from that of Mr Walsh.<br />
16. I have endeavoured to point out that the duty to<br />
keep secret, in my view, extends to the information placed<br />
before the Cabinet Committee relating to Mr Ivanov' s<br />
activities and ASIO's surveillance of those activities. I<br />
have said that because it is those aspects of the information<br />
which indicated the danger that Mr Ivariov posed or could be<br />
thought to pose to the country's security and disclosed the<br />
steps taken to prevent it.<br />
17. How the Ministers should behave towards Mr Combe<br />
is no more significant than how they should behave towards<br />
any other lobbyist. What is significant for section 79( l) is<br />
, the information placed before the Cabinet Committee.. it is<br />
the information to which the duty attaches and it does so because<br />
of the nature of that information. I think, therefore, that<br />
should Mr Walsh's evidence be accepted it would be open to a<br />
jury to find that Mr Young had committed a breach of section<br />
79( 3).<br />
18. The only relevant part of Mr Young's evidence is<br />
his indication that the Government had been looking at a<br />
problem which concerned Ivanov, Coinbe and Matheson and that<br />
Walsh should be careful. I think it reasonably clear that<br />
if Mr Young's evide nce is accepted, the jury would acquit him<br />
/ 8 </p>
<p>even though technically they would not be bound to do so.<br />
19. While, therefore, the question is one solely for<br />
the Attorney-General, on this ground without more I think<br />
that no proceedings should be taken against Mr Young.<br />
