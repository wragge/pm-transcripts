STATEMENT BY TilE PRICE MINISTER, THE RT.<br />
HON. WILLIAM icHiAHON, H. P.<br />
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, CANBERRA.<br />
I REPORT OF THE COMtONWEALTH-STATE OFFICIALS'<br />
COH14ITTEE ON DECENTRALISATION<br />
OCTOBER, 1972<br />
As I have indicated in answers to Parliamentary Questions,<br />
the Commonwealth and State Governments received the Report of the<br />
Commonwealth-State Officials' Committee on Decentralisation in June<br />
of this year. I also indicated that the Commonwealth was agreeable<br />
to the publication of the Report and that I was seeking the<br />
agreement of the States to this course.<br />
All the States have n'ew indicated their agreement to its<br />
public release and the printing of the Report has now been completed.<br />
In undertaking its task the Committee commissioned a number of<br />
studies in some cases involv: ng outside bodies which are listed<br />
as Attachment A of the Report. The printing of the studies in a<br />
separate volume is proceeding, but because of their size and for<br />
technical reasons it will be some time before the printing process is<br />
completed. In the meantime, arrang w'ts have been made for copies of<br />
the individual studies to be made available in the Parliamentary<br />
Library. I mention that the Report is the work of officials of the<br />
Commonwealth and the States and it does not therefore necessarily<br />
represent the views of the Commonwealth and State Governments. The<br />
Premier of New South Wales has asked me to point out that the views<br />
expressed by the New South Wales' Department of Decentralisation and<br />
Development in the supplementary statement to the Report should not be<br />
taken as necessarily representing the views of the State Government.<br />
As far as the Commonwealth is concerned, I said in my<br />
Ministerial Statement of 19 September 1972 on Urban and Regional<br />
Development that the Government endorses ' he view of the Committee<br />
that the only type of decentralisation which offers significant<br />
prospects of success is selective decentralisation. I also said that<br />
we propose to establish a 1. inistexial Council, consisting of the Prime<br />
Minister and Premiers: as the prinipal body for consultation and<br />
co-ordination in the fields of urban and regional development. / 2 </p>
<p>2.<br />
The Premiers have been advised of the Commonwealth's initiative in<br />
this area of urban and regional development.<br />
So-far as Commonwealth machinery is concerned, we will<br />
be introducing interim legislation shortly to establish a statutory<br />
organisation to be known as the National Urban and Regional<br />
Development Authority. </p>
