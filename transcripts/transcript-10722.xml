    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE....................................................................................................</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, good morning.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good morning, Neil, how are you?</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>I'm well. Gee, it's a nice coincidence to be in Brisbane.</p>
<p>   I think there's a little Test match starting up there today.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, there is.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Can you get there?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I will later in the morning but my main reason for being</p>
<p>   in Brisbane is to address the Annual Conference of the Federation</p>
<p>   of Ethnic Community Organisations and that is a long-standing commitment</p>
<p>   but it does happen to fall on the same day.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Well, that's good. I mean, I was thinking of Sir Robert Menzies</p>
<p>   who did manage to get to London for the odd Lords Test. Nothing</p>
<p>   wrong with it, Prime Minister.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, no, there isn't. Well, I certainly will be going to the</p>
<p>   Test match but I'll be attending to the meeting of the Ethnic</p>
<p>   Communities first. And I've got a number of things to say about</p>
<p>   issues of concern to them and that's the principle reason for</p>
<p>   being in Brisbane, but I'm not disguising the fact that I'll</p>
<p>   be going off to the cricket after I've delivered the speech.</p>
<p>   I mean, why not, it's Mark Taylor's 100th Test</p>
<p>   match.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>I'd be very disappointed if you didn't.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Indeed, most Australians would too.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, if we may, domestic issues first. Is it correct the</p>
<p>   Government's looking at a new compensation package for the</p>
<p>   charities because of the effect of the GST?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>To be perfectly frank, Neil, I haven't seen the Vos Report</p>
<p>   on which this report is based. I've been out of the country</p>
<p>   for two or three days. We are meeting next Tuesday. I think that</p>
<p>   report is sort of a bit fanciful because the GST doesn't apply</p>
<p>   to charities as such. The GST was only ever meant to apply if a</p>
<p>   not-for-profit organisation were carrying on a commercial activity</p>
<p>   in competition with another commercial activity. It was never the</p>
<p>   intention at any stage to apply the GST to the charitable activities</p>
<p>   of not-for-profit organisations, to donations or anything of that</p>
<p>   kind therefore I can't quite see what the article in The</p>
<p>   Australian, which I imagine you're referring to.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>That's correct, yes.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I can't quite see what that article's getting at. But</p>
<p>   maybe there's something in that report which I haven't</p>
<p>   been briefed on yet but certainly it's never been our intention</p>
<p>   that the GST would affect charitable activities, charitable donations</p>
<p>   and we'll be keen to ensure that that objective is carried</p>
<p>   through.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Okay, well certainly the Council of Social Service says they believe</p>
<p>   it is going to have significant impact. Is there a possibility here</p>
<p>   that it's having an unforeseen impact, do you think?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I'm not aware of that but if that were to be the case</p>
<p>   then we would do something to stop that happening. And let there</p>
<p>   be no doubt in anybody's mind, we do not intend in any way</p>
<p>   to burden the charitable activities of Australians or in any way</p>
<p>   to discourage giving to charities through the introduction of the</p>
<p>   GST. That's not our intention and we'll see that that</p>
<p>   doesn't happen.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Even if it costs money.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, but I don't believe that will be necessary.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Will you release the Vos Report?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>When?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I would imagine after the Cabinet's had a meeting next</p>
<p>   Tuesday.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Can I ask you about another area that seems to me to be a miscalculation</p>
<p>   after the Premiers' Conference, is it correct that stamp duty</p>
<p>   on business conveyancing will not be lifted now?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, that's not correct. There is a possibility that the date</p>
<p>   of lifting the stamp duty on business conveyancing may be delayed</p>
<p>   by a year or two, that's all. There's a possibility of</p>
<p>   that and only in relation to the stamp duty on conveyances of buildings,</p>
<p>   commercial buildings, real property. The stamp duty on all other</p>
<p>   business conveyances, business transactions, will be lifted as announced</p>
<p>   from the 1st of July in the year 2000. But depending</p>
<p>   on how the calculations finally come out - and there's still</p>
<p>   a lot of to-ing and fro-ing between the Commonwealth and the States</p>
<p>   as to the exact figures because the States have one set of figures</p>
<p>   and we have another and they're being reconciled at the moment</p>
<p>   - and it may be necessary to delay Â I underline the word,</p>
<p>   delay Â by a small period of time, the elimination of the stamp</p>
<p>   duty on the conveyances of business real property. But there's</p>
<p>   no suggestion that they won't ultimately be abolished.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>I guess the point I'm getting to, that that is, I suppose,</p>
<p>   an adjustment to calculations possibly, if we believe that social</p>
<p>   welfare groups, there may need to be an adjustment to calculations</p>
<p>   in the welfare area. I mean, how many adjustments are there likely</p>
<p>   to be of this nature around the GST?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, at no stage did I say that there wouldn't have to be</p>
<p>   some fine-tuning. And, indeed, we're talking about the Vos</p>
<p>   Report. The Vos Report was designed to fine-tune aspects of the</p>
<p>   package and obviously a little bit of fine-tuning is always going</p>
<p>   to be necessary with something as vast as this. Now, on the question</p>
<p>   of compensation. We've had views put to, or the Vos Committee's</p>
<p>   had views put to it. I haven't seen them yet. And I'll</p>
<p>   be having a briefing on the Vos Report over the weekend and we'll</p>
<p>   be discussing it in full at Cabinet next week when we examine the</p>
<p>   legislation. But it's always the case with something like this</p>
<p>   that you need fine-tuning. But on the issue of compensation, those</p>
<p>   documents that were released by the Treasurer last week showed very</p>
<p>   strongly that the alleged measure which was going to reveal that</p>
<p>   the compensation was inadequate - that is the Household Expenditure</p>
<p>   Survey measure - actually in some areas the impact was lower than</p>
<p>   what we'd said according to our measure.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Were you aware that ACOSS had, well, I suppose, got the backing</p>
<p>   of 40 of these key church welfare groups over the issue wanting</p>
<p>   change to the tax package?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I know that ACOSS has wanted change. They said that during</p>
<p>   the election campaign. Now, the question of...</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>It seems to have expanded a bit, though.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I don't know about that. And it depends what sort of</p>
<p>   change you're talking about, Neil. If you're talking about</p>
<p>   a minor adjustment then you always make minor adjustments, you always</p>
<p>   fine-tune something like this. But if you're talking about</p>
<p>   a big issue like taking food out of the GST, that's an entirely</p>
<p>   different matter. I mean, our argument on that is, and it remains,</p>
<p>   that if you take food out you don't help the poor but you immediately</p>
<p>   undermine the overall package. You create pressure for other things</p>
<p>   to be exempted, such as clothing, and where do you stop, do you</p>
<p>   have fresh food, do you have take-away foods, do you have restaurant</p>
<p>   meals. You have all the confusion that operates in other countries.</p>
<p>   Now, that is a major issue. That is quite distinct from whether</p>
<p>   you make a particular item sold over the counter at a chemist shop</p>
<p>   which is akin to a prescription drug, whether you make that GST-free</p>
<p>   or not. That is what I would call a minor fine-tuning.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Are you still confident you can get this package through before</p>
<p>   Christmas?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Through the House of Representatives.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes. I believe we can get it through the House of Representatives</p>
<p>   and that is our aim because that's what we were elected to</p>
<p>   do and we took it to the public. I do have to keep reminding people</p>
<p>   that we have had an election and we did lay all of this out. I mean,</p>
<p>   we did the unconventional thing. We told people we were going to</p>
<p>   change the tax system before the election and not after it as Labor</p>
<p>   Governments in the past have done. And we are entitled, therefore,</p>
<p>   to say to anybody, the public returned the Government and the Government's</p>
<p>   got a mandate to introduce it.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, the Tax Commissioner, Mr Carmody, in an interview yesterday</p>
<p>   or last night on the 7.30 Report is suggesting, well, he</p>
<p>   really says there could be a lot more to be found if tax minimisation's</p>
<p>   attacked. And he says if not, if you don't jump on it, it sort</p>
<p>   of devalues the effect of the tax reform, that it erodes the effect.</p>
<p>   Do you think he's right?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, without having seen exactly what he said and just relying</p>
<p>   on reports of what he said, he's right to this extent, Neil,</p>
<p>   that people who seek to exploit every last loophole in the tax system</p>
<p>   are not doing the country a service. And we are against that. One</p>
<p>   of the advantages of the new taxation system is that that will be</p>
<p>   harder to do because with the broad-based, indirect tax it's</p>
<p>   harder to evade. And certainly we remain very committed to stamping</p>
<p>   out artificial tax avoidance practices. There's always an argument</p>
<p>   between what people regard as legitimate business planning. In other</p>
<p>   words, nobody goes out to pay more tax than they have to.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>And that's legitimate, isn't it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, that is legitimate. I mean, you can't say to people,</p>
<p>   well, we want you to sort of deliberately arrange your affairs in</p>
<p>   such a way that you pay the maximum amount of tax. I don't</p>
<p>   think anybody would agree with that. On the other hand, if I were</p>
<p>   to say that you shouldn't spend your life trying to find every</p>
<p>   last loophole to avoid your taxation liabilities, most people would</p>
<p>   agree with that as well. Now, the fair balance is somewhere in the</p>
<p>   middle, isn't it?</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>It is. Some of the estimates, though, they're talking about</p>
<p>   a couple of billion dollars a year.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, people fling those sort of estimates around.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Do you think that's realistic?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, it depends on what you regard as tax minimisation. Some people</p>
<p>   regard the benefits provided by the law, the use of them as tax</p>
<p>   minimisation, others don't. I mean, some people say that it's</p>
<p>   tax minimisation to take advantage of some of the deductions available</p>
<p>   under the superannuation law but most Australians would say, well,</p>
<p>   the whole idea of having a tax deduction in that area is to encourage</p>
<p>   people to provide for their retirement and all we are doing is taking</p>
<p>   advantage of that, and I agree with that. But then there are some</p>
<p>   people in the welfare sector who criticise that. I mean, many of</p>
<p>   the people who fling around these figures like billions of dollars</p>
<p>   are really talking about changes to the law that deliberately authorise</p>
<p>   the taking of a tax deduction for a certain activity. There are</p>
<p>   many people in ACOSS who regard the present taxation treatment of</p>
<p>   superannuation as akin to tax minimisation. Now, you wouldn't</p>
<p>   regard it as so. I don't think many of your listeners would.</p>
<p>   But that is the difficulty of a debate like this is to try and get</p>
<p>   an agreed definition of what amounts to tax minimisation.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>I think he's also touched on the GST. He says small business</p>
<p>   is going to need more help with the GST.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, they are going to get our help. They are going to get $500</p>
<p>   million of help.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>He seems to be saying more is needed.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I, once again, I haven't had a look at that but under</p>
<p>   the plan there'll be $500 million available to help with the</p>
<p>   transitional impact of a GST.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Could I ask you about private health insurance?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>The slide continues...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, it does and it will go on until there's more help given</p>
<p>   to people to take out private health insurance. And we want to introduce</p>
<p>   and we announced before the election a 30 per cent tax rebate for</p>
<p>   everybody taking out private health insurance. And it's urgent</p>
<p>   that that be passed.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Are you going to get that through?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, it'll get through the House of Representatives. But</p>
<p>   can I just say to those in the Senate who are now talking about</p>
<p>   delaying it. I mean, what are you going on about? The public voted</p>
<p>   for that and don't imagine that by delaying or stopping a 30</p>
<p>   per cent tax rebate for private health insurance that that's</p>
<p>   going to help the public hospitals because if the slide in private</p>
<p>   health insurance continues more and more people will use public</p>
<p>   hospitals and there will be a greater strain on the public hospital</p>
<p>   system. And we have already increased massively the money going</p>
<p>   to the States for public hospitals. And I notice in Victoria that</p>
<p>   the Victorian Government is advertising about the huge increases</p>
<p>   in money that the Victorian Government is making available to public</p>
<p>   hospitals in that State, partly made possible by the extra money</p>
<p>   we have given Victoria. So, nobody can say governments around the</p>
<p>   country aren't putting more and more resources into public</p>
<p>   hospitals. Now, if the Labor Party and the Democrats are going to</p>
<p>   in the Senate stop the introduction of this 30 per cent tax rebate</p>
<p>   they will be directly adding a further burden onto the public hospital</p>
<p>   system of this country. And I just say to the Australian public,</p>
<p>   if you want this 30 per cent private health insurance rebate you</p>
<p>   get onto your Democrat Senators, you get onto your Labor Party Senators</p>
<p>   and you tell them to pass that law when it comes into the Senate</p>
<p>   in a few weeks time. Because we took that to the public and the</p>
<p>   public voted for it and we are determined to introduce it but if</p>
<p>   it's blocked in the Senate it will be on the heads of the Labor</p>
<p>   Party and the Democrats.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>You'd also have to say that your previous attempts to haven't</p>
<p>   worked. I think the figure that 500,000 have dropped out of private</p>
<p>   health insurance since your Government's been in power.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>That is true.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>And you have spent a fair bit trying to fix it.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We have but we believe more is needed and that is why we're</p>
<p>   increasing the rebate to 30 per cent. The problem in this area,</p>
<p>   Neil, is that years ago something should have been done to increase</p>
<p>   the incentives while there was a critical mass of people in private</p>
<p>   health insurance. Once it got below a certain figure, and it was</p>
<p>   identified by a former Labor Health Minister, Graham Richardson,</p>
<p>   as being about 40 per cent, once it got below that figure it was</p>
<p>   always going to need quite a big subsidy to turn it around. Now,</p>
<p>   we are at that very critical point and if this 30 per cent rebate</p>
<p>   does not come in as promised there will be a further drift of people,</p>
<p>   there'll be more and more people using the public hospital</p>
<p>   system and there'll be more and more strain on that system.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>But, what will happen to private health insurance? The AMA say</p>
<p>   if you don't get the rebate it's doomed.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, it will never be doomed for people who can afford to take</p>
<p>   it out without any kind of tax subsidy. There'll always be</p>
<p>   some people in the higher income bracket that will be able to afford</p>
<p>   to take it out and you'll have a more, you'll have a sharper</p>
<p>   division between what you might say elite private health insurance</p>
<p>   coverage because only the very wealthy will be able to afford it.</p>
<p>   And it will become more and more elite and more and more exclusive.</p>
<p>   And everybody else using the public system now...we support both,</p>
<p>   we support a strong public system and I have great admiration for</p>
<p>   the Australian public hospital system and I have seen it at work</p>
<p>   and I know how professional and how good it is but we also need</p>
<p>   a private system. You need both and what we are saying is, have</p>
<p>   both and you can only have both if you have a reasonable percentage</p>
<p>   of people in private health insurance and that's why we have</p>
<p>   got the rebate.</p>
<p> [Commercial break]</p>
<p>MITCHELL: </p>
<p>Mr Howard, Indonesia. Now the former Prime Minister, there's</p>
<p>   probably not much you can do about this, but the former Prime Minister,</p>
<p>   Paul Keating, has visited President Soeharto...former President</p>
<p>   Soeharto overnight. In the current environment is that really a</p>
<p>   good thing to do?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>He's got a perfect right to do that. He's a private citizen</p>
<p>   as is the former President Soeharto. I don't see any objection</p>
<p>   to that. I think it would be quite wrong of me to start telling</p>
<p>   Mr Keating who he should visit and who he shouldn't visit.</p>
<p>   That's his business.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>I just wonder if Indonesia...he'll be seen in Indonesia...still</p>
<p>   be seen as sought of an official of Australia even though he's</p>
<p>   not.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well he will be seen by some but he's a private citizen. He's</p>
<p>   got a perfect right to see anybody he wants to and I don't</p>
<p>   find anything strange at all in people who've served in, a</p>
<p>   Head of Government capacity in their own country retaining contact</p>
<p>   with others who've done the same thing. I know that Malcolm</p>
<p>   Fraser, often when he goes overseas, visits former French Presidents</p>
<p>   and Prime Ministers, and American Presidents. It's a perfectly</p>
<p>   normal thing to do. I don't, in the visit itself, I don't</p>
<p>   see anything wrong at all.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>He literally walked passed troops to get in there.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well once again I don't know all of that but equally can I</p>
<p>   stand by what I say that he's a private citizen and he doesn't</p>
<p>   go there in any official capacity. He was Prime Minister of Australia.</p>
<p>   He's no longer in politics. He has a perfect right in my view,</p>
<p>   as a private citizen to visit anybody he likes. I mean if he expresses</p>
<p>   views that I might disagree with well I would say so. But I think</p>
<p>   the fact that he's gone to see President Soeharto is perfectly</p>
<p>   unexceptionable.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>The reports of a second Dili massacre in 1991, and allegations</p>
<p>   have been made, have been in fact covered up by the then Labor Government.</p>
<p>   Do you...was there a second massacre? Do we know whether there</p>
<p>   was a second one?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I guess you have to speak to the former government, Gareth</p>
<p>   Evans and to Paul Keating, about whether anything was covered up.</p>
<p>   I think it all revolves around what's the definition of a Âsecond</p>
<p>   massacre'. I think it appears to be the case that there were</p>
<p>   some different briefings provided to different people at the time</p>
<p>   about actually what happened. But whether that amounted to a second</p>
<p>   massacre or not is a matter of argument and debate. I'm not</p>
<p>   in a position to pass judgement in precise terms on that. All I</p>
<p>   can say is that obviously a very tragic incident did occur. It remains</p>
<p>   a source of concern to a lot of people which I fully understand</p>
<p>   and there were different reports and different indications given</p>
<p>   to people at the time. I'm not alleging that the former government</p>
<p>   covered up anything. I think it does, from the reports I've</p>
<p>   read, revolve very much around what constitutes the meaning of a</p>
<p>   Âsecond massacre'.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>What, how many deaths?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, and I suppose the distance between when the first part of</p>
<p>   the incident had occurred and whether the second part of it is a</p>
<p>   continuation of the first or whether there was a sufficient lapse</p>
<p>   of time for people to say: well this was one massacre and then there</p>
<p>   was another one. I mean I think it all...it becomes a rather</p>
<p>   semantic debate. I mean, there was a tragic event that involved</p>
<p>   a completely unacceptable loss of life and continues to be an extremely,</p>
<p>   you know, an unsavory incident and where obviously a lot of people</p>
<p>   were guilty of appalling behavior. Now whether it technically comprise</p>
<p>   one or two massacres is something that I can't really answer.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>The Bishop of East Timor says a new inquiry is needed. Do you think</p>
<p>   there's any point in a new i</p>
