AUS T RA -2 2<br />
FOR MEDIA 24 NOVEMBER 1981<br />
AUSTRALIAN PARTICIPATION IN THE SINAI<br />
PEACEKEEPING FORCE<br />
In my statement to the Parliament on 22 October, I announced<br />
the terms of the Government's decision concerning Australian<br />
participation in the Sinai Peacekeeping Force.<br />
I stated that:<br />
" the Government has decided that Australia will agree to<br />
participate in the Sinai Peacekeeping Force subject to<br />
Britain ar'd Canada also agreeing to participate. In the<br />
interests of obtaining the broadest-based international<br />
acceptance of the Force, significant European participation<br />
is a critical factor. We are glad to see from publ. ished reports<br />
that France is reconsidering her attitude.<br />
I also said that:<br />
" there is a limit to what Austra'lia as a middle power can<br />
do. We must avoid unrealistic views of what we can achieve.<br />
But to say that there are limits is in no way to say that<br />
we could not make a valuable contribution in conjunction<br />
with other countries which share our interests and our concern<br />
for peace in the region".<br />
In our consideration of a possible Australian contribution, a<br />
principal concern from the outset has been the need to achieve!<br />
a balanced, truly multi-national force. The Government has made<br />
this plain from the beginning.<br />
The Government considered this matter in early October, at thE! time<br />
of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. As a result of<br />
discussions that then took place, it seemed that the most likely<br />
way to achieve a balanced force would be for Canada and Britain<br />
to participate in the Force, along with Australia, to join wit~ h<br />
the other countries which had already indicated their willingness<br />
to participate. That is why the decision about Australian<br />
participation was made in those terms, and why the United States<br />
was informed of our decision in those terms. / 2 </p>

On. 28 October, in answer to a question in Parliament about reports<br />
foreshadowing agreement by France, Britain, The Netherlands<br />
and Italy to take part in the Peacekeeping Force. I said<br />
" Obviously that also will lead to a balanced force.<br />
The Commonwealth's concern all along is that there be<br />
a balanced force. We would obviously look at the<br />
matter on the merits to see which countries are actually<br />
going to perform and to contribute. But I am making<br />
the point that the participation of Canada is not the<br />
only way of achieving that particular objective."<br />
It has now been announced that France, Britain, The Netherlandsand<br />
Italy intend to participate in the Peacekeeping Force.<br />
The announcement to participate by these four countries meets<br />
the Commonwealth Government's requirement for a balanced<br />
multi-national force, and makes it possible for Australia also<br />
to participate. We have noted that the Egyptian Government has<br />
welcomed the European decision, and we look forward to the Israeli<br />
Government's doing likewise. With difficulties unlikely to arise<br />
in respect of the other matters mentioned in my statement of<br />
22 October, the Government will be advising the United States,<br />
Egypt and Israel of Australia's agreement to participate in thE!<br />
Force.-We welcome the recent statement by the Prime Minister of New<br />
Zealand concerning New Zealand's intentions.<br />
The Government's decision of 12 October about Australian<br />
participation included a number of other aspects which are<br />
important to the full protection of Australia's independence<br />
and sovereignty. Discussions are taking place in relation to<br />
these other matters and I am confident that no obstacles will<br />
arise. In respect of our concern that the Sinai peacekeeping<br />
force not be linked with the Rapid Deployment Force, the United<br />
States Secretary of State has said that any contribution of a<br />
US contingent would be for the specific peacekeeping mission<br />
provided for in the peace treaty between Egypt and Israel. As<br />
I said in my statement to the Parliament on 22 October, the<br />
precise composition of our contribution will be decided after<br />
discussions with other participants, and also the duration of our<br />
participation has * to be agreed. In due course, after discussions<br />
with all relevant parties, an announcement will be made giving<br />
the precise details of our-commitment.' The commitment will,<br />
however, be consistent with that stated to the Parliament..<br />
The Government has made it plai'n that a sol~ ution to the<br />
Palestinian issue is clearly central to the future stability and<br />
peace of the Middle East. As I said in my statement of 22 October,<br />
the Government is concerned that our participation in the peacekeeping<br />
force would have the maximum-i possible influence in<br />
continuing and broadeninql the peace process in the Middle East.<br />
