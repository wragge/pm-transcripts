J AUSTRALIA<br />
PRIWE MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 2 November 1980<br />
THE NEW MINISTRY<br />
His Excellency the Governor-General has<br />
authorised rr. e to announce details of the new Ministry<br />
which will be sworn at Governr. ent House tomorrow.<br />
It has been decided to reduce the number of<br />
Departments by two and the number of Ministers by one.<br />
This means there will now be twenty six Ministers and<br />
twenty six Departments.<br />
The full list of Ministers and their portfolios<br />
is shown in the attached list.<br />
As will be clear, the Departments to be<br />
abolished are those of Productivity and the Special<br />
Trade Representative. The environment functions of the Department<br />
of Science and the Environment are to be placed in the<br />
Home Affairs portfolio, and the productivity promotion<br />
and technology related functions of the Department of<br />
Productivity will be joined with Science to form a<br />
Department of Science and Technology. The link between<br />
the science and technology related functions is clear,<br />
and advice to the Government from the Australian Science<br />
and Technology Council was that there would be<br />
considerable merit in joining them together in a<br />
Department. The Patents Office and the Australian<br />
Industrial Research and Development Incentives Board<br />
will also be part of the Depar. tment of Science and<br />
Technology. ./ 2 </p>
<p>2.<br />
The Minister for Industry and Commerce will<br />
responsibility from now on for the defence factories<br />
TrnL. r, located in the Productivity portfolio.<br />
A reviscd Administrative Arrangements Order<br />
2il!. be placed before the ExeeuLiv Council on Monday<br />
and,, if approved, then be Gazetted.<br />
Mr Lynch, as Minister for Industry and Commerce,<br />
will cmntinue to have an overriding responsibility in the<br />
indust-y policy field and in the co-ordination of policy<br />
dev I~ pment generally. He will also be assisting me with<br />
the management of Cabinet business and in chairing a number<br />
of Cabinet committees. Senator Chaney has joined the Cabinet as<br />
Minister for Social Security and will take on direct<br />
resTpcsibility also for the Social Welfare Policy<br />
Secretariat which is responsible for policy development<br />
and re~-iew activity in the broad field of health and<br />
welfare. I have asked Senator Chaney to give special<br />
personal attention to policy development within his<br />
portfolio and also to achieving greater co-ordination<br />
of programs and services in the welfare field.<br />
I am asking Mr Newman to continue in his<br />
co-ordinating role in reporting to the Government on<br />
matters of particular concern to Tasmania, including in<br />
following up the Callaghan Report.<br />
The practice will continue of appointing<br />
Ministers Assisting in the portfolios of senior Ministers<br />
where the workload is especially heavy. These appointments<br />
are shown in the attached list. </p>
<p>3.<br />
It has also been decided to appoint two Government<br />
members as Parliamentary Secretaries to Ministers. Mr Wilson<br />
will be my Parliamentary Secretary, and Mr Lloyd will be<br />
Parliamentary Secretary to Mr Nixon. Their role as<br />
Parliamentary Secretaries will include assistance to the<br />
Minister with a range of his duties including with his<br />
correspondence, liaison with other Members of Parliament,<br />
and meetings with delegations and clients of the<br />
Department and authorities within the portfolio, and other<br />
represent ational activities.<br />
Senator Carrick will be continuing as Leader of<br />
the Government in the Senate and as Vice-President of the<br />
Executive Council, and Mr Sinclair will be continuing as<br />
Leader of the House. Senator Durack will continue as<br />
Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate.<br />
Mr McLeay approached me to ask. that he not be<br />
considered for the Ministry on this occasion. He wished<br />
to make room for a new Minister to be given an opportunity.<br />
He said he would prefer to be given the opportunity to<br />
serve in other capacities.<br />
Mr Garland also indicated to me that he would<br />
be interested in serving in another capacity if there<br />
were the opportunity. The Government has decided, having<br />
in mind his experience both inside and outside the<br />
Parliament and particularly the important diplomatic and<br />
negotiating role he played as Minister for Special Trade<br />
Representations especially in relation to the EEC, to<br />
appoint him as Australian High Commissioner to Britain.<br />
It is planned that he take over this role from / 4 </p>
<p>Sir James Plimsoll towards the middle of 1981. I take<br />
this opportunity to record the Government's appreciation<br />
of Sir James Plimsoll's long and distinguished service.<br />
I pay tribute to Mr McLeay and Mr Garland for<br />
their Parliamentary and Ministerial service.<br />
I would also like to pay tribute to Mr Adermann<br />
and Mr Groom who will not be serving in the new Ministry.<br />
Each has contributed to the Government's work over recent<br />
years. I thank them warmly for that and I am sure they<br />
will continue to contribute significantly to public life.<br />
I grea ly regret that Mr Robinson has chosen<br />
not to serve in the new Ministry. He has been a valued<br />
colleague. </p>
