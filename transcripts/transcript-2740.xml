PRESS STATEMENT NO. 9<br />
11 December 1972<br />
I\ 1AJOR GRANTS FOR THE ARTS<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr. Whitlam, today announced major<br />
grants by the Australian Government for the performing arts<br />
for 1973. The grants, recommended by the Australian Council for<br />
the Arts, include boosts for companies involved in major new<br />
developments in Sydney, Perth and Adelaide.<br />
These increases aim to enable opera, ballet and drama<br />
companies to appear to advantage in the Sydney Opera House,<br />
the Perth Concert Hall and the Adelaide Festival Centre.<br />
The grant for the Australian Ballet has increased from<br />
$ 400,000 in 1972 to $ 500,000 for 1973. The Australian Oi~ era<br />
will receive $ 800,000, compared to $ 650,000 in 1972, the<br />
Elizabethan Trust Orchestras $ 800,000 ($ 640,000), the Old Tote<br />
Theatre Company $ 260,000 ($ 186,000), the South Australian<br />
Theatre Company $ 90,000 ($ 60,000) and the National Theatre<br />
at the Playhouse, Perth $ 80,000 ($ 62,500).<br />
Another substantially increased grant will go to the<br />
Tasmanian Theatre Company which will receive $ 70,000, compared<br />
to $ 45,000 in 1972.<br />
Details of other major grants are attached.<br />
Mr. Whitlam said the coming year will see developments<br />
of great importance to the arts, both at Federal and State level.<br />
In many-State capitals during 1973 splendid new buildings will<br />
open in which the people of Australia will be able to share the<br />
pleasure and excitement of performances by-bur top performing<br />
artists. The Concert Hall in Perth, the Festival Centre in<br />
Adelaide, the Opera House in Sydney and other fine'buildings now<br />
being planned in other capital cities will provide magnificent<br />
settings for our orchestras and our opera, ballet and drama<br />
companies. It is our aim to see that the companies are able to<br />
appear in them to advantage. To this end our grants to the<br />
national and State companies have been increased to allow them<br />
to build up their resources and mount a fitting scale and<br />
quality of performance. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
Australia must aim towards companies of world quality if<br />
our top professional artists are to be encouraged to live and<br />
work here. But our aims are broader than that. The arts have<br />
an important role in the changing life style of Australia.<br />
We look to a future when the leisure time of all Australians<br />
will be enriched by the diverse pleasures of music, drama, dance<br />
and painting, craft work, opera, film and sculpture; when<br />
children, whatever their background, will have an equal chance<br />
to express and develop talents and enthusiasms.<br />
To foster this general community interest my Government<br />
will in the coming year provide maliy more grants for special<br />
projects and give increased assistance to bodies like the Arts<br />
Councils which cater for the needs of country people. Vie will<br />
also increase support to the small theatre companies in the<br />
various States which provide an invaluable basis for our national<br />
companies and in many cases are beginning to compete with them<br />
in range and interest of work.<br />
In the coming year significant changes will be<br />
implemented in the administration of the arts at Federal level<br />
to carry out the undertaking given in the Australian Labor<br />
Party's policy speech. I stated there our concern to help the<br />
arts, not only by fostering high standards of work and wide<br />
public interest and involvement, but by seeking through them<br />
a focus and expression of our national identity and a means<br />
of making our values better known in contact with other countries.<br />
To achieve these objectives the present arrangements will be<br />
overhauled and the Australian Council for the Arts will be set<br />
up by statute-to provide the direct and specialised administration<br />
which the arts require.<br />
