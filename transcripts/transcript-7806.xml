Ministerial colleague Neal Blewett<br />
Distinguished Guests<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen<br />
I was delighted to accept Neal Blevett's invitation to<br />
welcoe you to Australia and to Melbourne, and to open this<br />
Ninth Cononwealth Health Ministers' Meeting.<br />
I an particularly happy to meet you here so soon after<br />
returning from the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting<br />
in Kuala Lumpur. Much of the attention given by the media<br />
to that meeting concentrated on the high profile issues of<br />
Southern Africa and the environment.<br />
It was right that this degree of attention should have been<br />
paid to those issues as they are issues of very great<br />
importance to the commoneelth and globally. I velcoae the<br />
progress made by the Kuala Lumpur CHOGN on then.<br />
But Heads of Government and, I hope, the public did not<br />
underestimate the real value of functional cooperation as<br />
another vital element in a sense, the muscle and fibre<br />
of the Comonwealth's collective endeavours.<br />
Coonwealth meetings in fields such as health, education<br />
and youth affairs don't often hit the headlines. But they<br />
are a very important part of the reason the Commonvealth<br />
matters to us, because our size and diversity as a group<br />
coverinq a quarter of the world's population our different<br />
histories, our separate experiences, all mean that we have<br />
much to learn from one another and to give to one another. </p>
<p>The Commonwealth Spans the Continents and is a bridge<br />
between races and religions, between rich and poor. It<br />
provides a unique foruz for us to discuss our problem<br />
frankly, and a unique vehicle for us to work together for<br />
solutions.<br />
And perhaps nowhere is this more true than in the field of<br />
health. Since the first meeting of Health Ministers took place in<br />
Edinburgh in 1965, these meetings have become an important<br />
part of the Comuonwealth's activities.<br />
They have shown that informal discussion among Commonwealth<br />
Ministers provides a very effective vay of addressing a<br />
range of important health problem.<br />
In April 1988, I had the pleasure of speaking to some of you<br />
when I opened the second International Conference on Health<br />
Promotion in Adelaide. That Conference concentrated on the<br />
World Health Assembly goal of " Health For All" by the year<br />
2000.<br />
The theme for this meeting, " Community approaches to health<br />
promotion and disease prevention", in an ideal vehicle for<br />
continuing international progress towards that goal.<br />
Over the last 40 or 50 years there have been some remarkable<br />
improvements in the health of the world's9 peoples. Some of<br />
the improvements have been dramatic such as the<br />
eradication of small pox. Many others have resulted from<br />
less spectacular but equally important developments such as<br />
the improvement of water supply and sanitation. Many<br />
efforts in the traditional public health arena have borne<br />
fruit and are continuing, particularly in developing<br />
countries such ans ass immunisation of children against<br />
poliomyelitis and measles, and improvements in maternal and<br />
child health.<br />
However, none of us can afford to be complacent about our<br />
achievements. Developing countries still face major though not<br />
insurmountable -problem of malnutrition, disease and lack<br />
of basic health services.<br />
But developed countries, too, stand to benefit from<br />
discussions at this conference.<br />
National figures which show developed countries enjoy<br />
increased longevity, for example, or low infant mortality,<br />
frequently disguise large and unacceptable variations<br />
between regions and groups within the population. </p>
<p>Certainly, Australians are aong the healthiest pOople in<br />
the world. And we are justifiably proud that through our<br />
national health care system Medicare, we have ensured that<br />
access to health services is universally available and is<br />
not limited by income.<br />
Yet if we look beyond our well-off suburbs to focus on the<br />
plight of the less well-off, not least of course the<br />
Australian Aboriginal people, we find a real need for<br />
further progress in improving maternal and infant health and<br />
in providing clean water and safe waste disposal.<br />
Australia is not alone among developed, healthy, countries<br />
in having to ensure good health is a reality universally<br />
throughout their communities.<br />
At the same time developed countries face further problems<br />
caused, perhaps paradoxically, by their affluence.<br />
Pressures on the health care system resulting from motor<br />
vehicle accidents, through to the less direct but very<br />
significant health impacts of obesity and other diet related<br />
problems, face most affluent countries.<br />
And any developed country tempted to rest on its laurels<br />
because it have achieved significant improvements in<br />
inmunisation levels, for example, need only look to the<br />
recent North American experiences for an effective warning<br />
against complacency. Despite high immunisation rates,<br />
children in their thousands have contracted measles in<br />
outbreaks of what is too often regarded as a relatively<br />
harmless disease and, tragically, a number have died.<br />
so your theme, " Community approaches to health promotion and<br />
disease prevention" addresses an issue facing all<br />
Commonwealth countries.<br />
There is a puzzling feature about the role of the community<br />
in primary health care and health promotion: the importance<br />
of community involvement in health services is widely<br />
expounded, but much less practised.<br />
But everyone hare would recognise that the involvement of<br />
the community in health care is not a social nicety, but a<br />
technical necessity. Health care program cannot achieve<br />
coverage and effectiveness without the involvement of the<br />
coomunity.<br />
As we confront the problems of chronic, and in many cases<br />
preventable, disease, we must ensure that communities play a<br />
greater role in health promotion and disease prevention<br />
st. rategies in both developing countries and in those<br />
characterised as developed or industrialised. </p>
<p>This is particularly true in formulating a strategy to<br />
combat that most threatening Of infectious diseases, AIDS.<br />
Australia has developed an AIDS strategy that is widely<br />
respected a respect that I believe is due to the<br />
comprehensive way we went about finding national responses<br />
to the challenges posed by this epidezic.<br />
community participation and international cooperation are<br />
among its key elements. The national Government is working<br />
in concert with all State and Territory Governments of this<br />
country in a cooperative effect which crosses party<br />
political lines.<br />
I pay tribute to the very effective contribution made here<br />
in Victoria by the state Government in enlisting the<br />
cooperation of th'e groups moat affected by AIDS and in<br />
striking the balance between protecting public health and<br />
civil liberties.<br />
Comprehensive consultations enabled us to take account of<br />
the views of individual Australians, cozmunity groups, the<br />
research community, the private sector and state and Federal<br />
Government authorities. The strategy relies heavily on<br />
cooperation among these sectors of the community for its<br />
Success. In the same way we are relying on community effort in our<br />
campaign against drug abuse, a problem which received<br />
significant attention at the recent Commonwealth Heads of<br />
Government Meeting in Kuala Lumpur.<br />
The campaign does not try to divide the problem. s of drug<br />
abuse and focus solely on illegal drugs or alcohol or<br />
tobacco. Rather it recognises the interlocking nature of<br />
these problems.<br />
With the support of every Government in Australia, our<br />
campaign seeks to provide:<br />
an effective prevention strategy with particular<br />
emphasis on messages encouraging young Australians to<br />
avoid drug misuse;<br />
* expaded and improved treatment and rehabilitation<br />
services for persons with drug-related problems and<br />
law enforcement and control measures to limit the supply<br />
of drugs. </p>
<p>Last year$ my colleague Neal Ulewett released a report which<br />
sets a dramatic new course for Australian health policy.<br />
The report, " Health for all Australians", in Australia's,<br />
blueprint for action to achieve the world Health<br />
Organisation's goal of " Health for All by the Year 2000".<br />
The report, and our follow-up actions, show that Australia,<br />
1like other nations represented here today, has accepted the<br />
challenge posed by this world Health Organisation goal.<br />
Over the past year a great deal of detailed planning has<br />
been done on our Health for All report and so I an delighted<br />
to have the opportunity in this forum today to launch the<br />
product of this work the National Better Health Program.<br />
Australian Governments led by the Federal Government have<br />
COMitted $ 41 million to this three-year program, dedicated<br />
to promoting the health of all our citizens, and<br />
particularly those who are disadvantaged.<br />
What we're trying to do is to prevent sickness before it<br />
occurs from the personal and national view, that's a much<br />
better approach than treating people after they have<br />
succumbed to an illness.<br />
Unlike earlier programs that have concentrated on single<br />
issues, the Better Health Program will be far more<br />
comprehensive in the issues it cover., and in the way it<br />
covers them.<br />
This program will encourage better health through community<br />
action and education in five major health areas:<br />
controlling high blood pressure; encouraging better<br />
nutritioni detecting, treating and preventing cancers of the<br />
lung, skin, breast and cervix; improving the health of older<br />
people; and preventinq comon injuries that occur for<br />
example in sports, swimming pools, playgrounds and the home.<br />
Our commitment to the World Health Organisation goal of<br />
Health For All leads us to pose fundamental questions about<br />
health and health service delivery in Australia.<br />
The fact is, unless we are willing to identify those with<br />
poorest health we cannot hope to mount effective strategies<br />
for health promotion and disease prevention.<br />
The solution to the problems of growing chronic, preventable<br />
disease is not simply more high tech facilities and wonder<br />
drugs though these must continue to have a role to play<br />
but the involvement of the community in changing the<br />
attitudes that cause ill-health. </p>
<p>The agenda item for your discuss ion acknowledge that health<br />
promotion and disease prevention have always presented a<br />
tremendous challenge for communities across the world: that<br />
the fundamentals of health promotion are the fundamentals of<br />
life.<br />
The creativity, resourcefulness and caring of communities<br />
are all important ingredients of health prevention. But<br />
community participation is essential. And it is up to<br />
governments to encourage their communities to become<br />
involved in understanding, protecting and promoting their<br />
own health. If we ac-hieve this, we must listen and we must<br />
be honest.<br />
We must askc, at the community level, what is important, what<br />
diseases are needlessly occurring, and what is obstructing<br />
attempts to promote health.<br />
We must break don the residual taboos about discussing<br />
certain issues which are integral to personal and communal<br />
health, issues such as sexually transmitted diseases, mental<br />
illnesses and drug use. These problem must be tackled with<br />
tact and openness, or they will remain a source of unspoken<br />
misery for their unfortunate sufferers.* Problem cannot be<br />
solved until they have been admitted.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
In speaking about our planning and our aspirations for the<br />
future, I know I an only touching on issues which you will<br />
explore in greater detail.<br />
I wish you well in your deliberations.<br />
As political leaders, we are all acutely aware that world<br />
opinion is increasingly focused on the very significant<br />
effects on humn health of actions which damage our<br />
envirortment. Nations must strike a balance between<br />
development and the need to bequeath the heritage of a<br />
healthy environment, one that will sustain human health, for<br />
f uture generations.<br />
This quest for sustainable development is an international<br />
one. The responsibility in one we all share.<br />
And it is an issue closely related to your these, as it is<br />
an issue requiring real commnity involvement.<br />
Environment was a major theme of the Kuala Lumpur CROGN last<br />
month. Perhaps you will decide, here in Melbourne, that the<br />
theme of environment and health could provide a focal point<br />
for discussion at the Tenth Comnealth Health Ministers<br />
Meeting in 1992. </p>
<p>7.<br />
With that I thank you for the invitation to open Your<br />
Conference. Again I extend to you a warm welcome on behalf<br />
of the Govorrament and people of Australia and offer you our<br />
best wishes for a successful meeting.<br />
It is my pleasure to declare this meeting open. </p>
