PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP, ZIONIST FEDERATION OF AUSTRALIA<br />
ACT HEADQUARTERS, FORREST, 21 NOVEMBER 1989<br />
E &amp; 0E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, Mr Kroger seems to be<br />
backing off a bit today. Are you aware of any senior<br />
Labor figures perhaps suggesting Mr Elliott would do<br />
better off staying in business rather than politics?<br />
PM: If I knew of it I'd move for their expulsion from<br />
the Party. I mean there's no-one who would've been<br />
looking forward more eagerly to Mr Elliott coming into<br />
the Parliament than myself and my colleagues because he<br />
would've added to an already disputatious, hatred ridden,<br />
gaggle of people who make up the Opposition. It would've<br />
been another delightful dimension to it. So far from not<br />
wanting him to come in, I would really like to see him<br />
there and if any by-election could be arranged in the<br />
near future, you know I would urgently suggest that some<br />
of these rather ineffective Liberals should stand aside<br />
and let him come in. We'd love to see him there. But it<br />
is rather pathetic really, these attempts to divert<br />
attention from the issue and that issue is the policies<br />
of the Liberal Party with which Mr Elliott is associated<br />
and of which he would be a very significant beneficiary.<br />
All I can say is that it does raise some interesting<br />
questions for Mr Elliott when he comes back because<br />
obviously he will now be required to substantiate the<br />
allegations that Mr Kroger has made. I mean someone's<br />
not telling the truth there, either Mr Elliott or Mr<br />
Kroger or a combination of both of them.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, does it also suggest that perhaps<br />
the attack against Elliott's hitting its mark?<br />
PM: Well it's not so much of an attack against Elliott.<br />
As I made it quite clear in my observation in Tasmania on<br />
the weekend, I didn't choose Mr Elliott as leader of the<br />
Liberal Party. I didn't choose to have him as the person<br />
who himself has said publicly that he has been involved<br />
in the formulation of Liberal Party economic policy.<br />
What I do say and what I am responsible for is to point<br />
out that that policy with which he has been associated is<br />
one which is a remedy for social and economic disaster<br />
for this country. </p>
<p>( PM cont) That attack on that issue will continue<br />
unabated and remorselessly because it is a policy which<br />
seeks to take from 1% of the population take from 99%<br />
of the population and transfer to It involves the<br />
most massive redistribution of wealth from the poor, the<br />
low and the middle income to the very wealthy, nothing<br />
like it's ever been seen before in this country. Mr<br />
Elliott is associated with that. The attack will be not<br />
upon Mr Elliott as such, but upon those policies.<br />
Unfortunately for him and for the Liberal Party, he in a<br />
sense typifies the gross social inequity and the economic<br />
lunacy of those policies.<br />
ends </p>
