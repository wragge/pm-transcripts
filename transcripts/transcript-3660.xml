PRIME MINISTER PRESS STATEMENT NO. 472<br />

P. R. S. REVIEW 0O' HOUSING POLICY<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr E. G. Whitlam, said<br />
today that the Priorities Review Staff were undertaking,<br />
at his request, a complete review of Australian<br />
Government policies on housing. Mr Whitlam said he<br />
expected the review would include an examination of the<br />
efficiency with which various objectives were being met<br />
and an exploration of the options available to the<br />
Government. Departments of the Australian Government<br />
were co-operating with the PRS. Mr Whitlam hoped<br />
there would also be co-operation and assistance from<br />
other individuals and institutions approached for<br />
views or information.<br />
