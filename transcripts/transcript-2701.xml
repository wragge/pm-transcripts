COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA<br />
SPEECH BY<br />
The Rt Hon. W. McMAHON, M. P.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
ON<br />
Companies ( Foreign Take-overs) Bill 1972<br />
Second Reading<br />
[ From the ' Parliamentary Debates', 24 October 1972]<br />
Mr MMAHON ( Lowe-P. rime Minister)<br />
( 8.55)-This Bill makes provision for<br />
the control of foreign takeovers of companies.<br />
The House will recall that in the<br />
statement I made on 26th September last<br />
concerning overseas investment in Australia<br />
I announced the Government's intention<br />
to legislate for the control of those<br />
foreign takeovers it considers would be<br />
against the national interest. In outlining<br />
the measures that would operate under the<br />
legislation I indicated that decisions on<br />
whether particular takeovers would be<br />
against the national interest would be<br />
taken by the Government. I added that in<br />
making its decisions the Government<br />
would be assisted by an independent<br />
authority established under the legislation.<br />
This authority would analyse and report to<br />
the Government on takeover proposals<br />
which the Government judged warranted<br />
further investigation as to whether they<br />
would be against the national interest. I<br />
indicated that the proposed measures for<br />
the control of foreign take-overs would<br />
apply from 27th September 1972 and that<br />
they would embrace takeover proposals<br />
then current.<br />
Pending the establishment of the proposed<br />
independent authority I said that<br />
there would be an interim arrangement<br />
under which departmental machinery<br />
would be used for consideration of particular<br />
takeovers on the basis of the<br />
announced criteria. This departmental<br />
machinery has been established and is functioning. A special group of officers has<br />
been appointed specificially for the purpose<br />
of examining the national interest aspects<br />
of particular takeover proposals. This<br />
group is located in my Department but it<br />
comprises officers from several other<br />
departments and is under the direction of<br />
a very senior officer who has been<br />
seconded from the Department of Trade<br />
and Industry. The reports of the group are<br />
considered by . very senior representatives<br />
of several departments before being<br />
referred to the Government for decision.<br />
The administrative arrangements for the<br />
examination of particular foreign takeovers<br />
are an important step in the implementation<br />
of the Government's policy which I<br />
announced on 26th September. That policy<br />
recognises that we are not as dependent on<br />
others as formerly and that Australians<br />
have rights at stake in foreign takeovers in<br />
the ownership and control of Australian<br />
industry. But we also recognise that the<br />
interests of the Australian investors should<br />
not be prejudiced, except when the overriding<br />
interest of the nation requires it.<br />
The administrative machinery alone is not<br />
sufficient. If it is to be fully effective that<br />
machinery must have the backing of the<br />
law. A decision that a particular foreign<br />
takeover should not proceed must be one<br />
that, if necessary, is enforceable in a court.<br />
On the other hand, the parties to foreign<br />
takeover proposals are entitled to know<br />
with certainty where they stand. The law<br />
should make their position clear too. </p>
<p>The Bill will give immediate legal backing<br />
to the proposals I announced on 26th<br />
September insofar as those proposals relate<br />
to foreign takeovers of companies. The Bill<br />
will ensure the effectiveness of the Government's<br />
control of the takeovers. It will also<br />
provide clear and precise procedures for<br />
the business world. Parties involved in or<br />
contemplating takeover proposals will<br />
know just what steps they should take to<br />
remove uncertainties. The Bill does not at<br />
this stage establish the proposed independent<br />
authority. That will be provided for<br />
in a further Bill, which will be introduced<br />
next year and will necessarily take some<br />
time. In the meantime it is desirable that<br />
the effectiveness of the control being exercised<br />
under the departmental machinery<br />
should be ensured. The present Bill will do<br />
this. The powers under the Bill to prevent<br />
foreign takeovers that are against the<br />
national interest will be exercisable by the<br />
Government, acting through the Minister<br />
administering the Act. This is in accord<br />
with the proposals announced on 26th September.<br />
In exercising these powers, however,<br />
the Government will in practice act<br />
on advice from the departmental officials 1<br />
have mentioned. The present Bill applies to<br />
foreign takeovers of companies, and these<br />
comprise most of the takeovers within the<br />
proposals of 26th September 1972. Certain<br />
other types of takeovers are not covered<br />
by the Bill. These takeovers will continue<br />
to be controlled administratively under the<br />
departmental machinery. They will be<br />
provided for in the Bill to be introduced<br />
next year. I assure the House that the<br />
Government will not hesitate to use its<br />
powers to the full to ensure compliance<br />
with the controls. The Bill will apply to<br />
proposals for foreign takeovers of trading<br />
or financial corporations formed within the<br />
Commonwealth and also of bodies incorporated<br />
in a Territory of the Commonwealth<br />
other than Papua New Guinea.<br />
Holding companies of such bodies are also<br />
covered. The Bill is not confined to companies of<br />
any particular size. But the Government<br />
does not propose, except in special circumstances,<br />
to apply the legislation to takeovers<br />
of companies unless their assets<br />
exceed $ Im. Two main powers are provided in the Bill. One will enable the<br />
Minister to make an order prohibiting a<br />
particular foreign takeover proposal, whatever<br />
its form, from being implemented if<br />
the Minister is satisfied that it would be<br />
contrary to the national interest. The other<br />
main power will enable the Minister to<br />
limit the beneficial interests that a particular<br />
foreign ifiterest or associated group of<br />
interests may have in a specified company.<br />
This power will be available to ensure that<br />
the prohibition of one particular takeover<br />
proposal is not avoided by resort to some<br />
alternative proposal which would achieve<br />
the same ultimate effect. It will also be<br />
available if foreign control of an Australian<br />
company has been achieved since<br />
26th September 1972 without prior<br />
notification of the proposal to the Government.<br />
The question whether a takeover proposal<br />
will result in control of a company passing<br />
from Australian to foreign hands will<br />
be a matter for separate consideration in<br />
the circumstances of each case. The question<br />
in each case will be whether there is a<br />
passing of effective control. In general such<br />
control will be treated as passing if, as a<br />
result of the takeover, 15 per cent or more<br />
of the voting power would be controlled<br />
by a single foreign interest or associated<br />
group of interests. A similar position will<br />
apply if in the aggregate 40 per cent or<br />
more of the voting power is controlled by<br />
foreign interests. These percentages will<br />
not be a conclusive indication of foreign<br />
control. ; If the Minister is satisfied that having<br />
regard to all the circumstances an acquisition<br />
would not give a significant degree of<br />
foreign control over the conduct of the<br />
company in question, the powers of the<br />
Bill will not apply. The question whether a<br />
particular takeover would be against the<br />
national interest will be a matter for decision<br />
by the Government. That is where the<br />
responsibility should rest. In discharging<br />
this responsibility the Government will<br />
apply the criteria that I outlined in my<br />
statement on 26th September 1972. In t:-at<br />
statement I mentioned that a takeover may<br />
be treated as against the national interest if<br />
the company concerned is considered by<br />
the Government to be an economically<br />
strategic industry leader, or to be so large </p>
<p>that the takeover would significantly affect<br />
the relative balance of Australian ownership<br />
and control of the industry concerned.<br />
-1 mentioned also the criteria that are to<br />
be applied to other foreign takeovers. The<br />
first criterion is whether, against the background<br />
of existing circumstances in the<br />
industry concerned, the takeover would<br />
lead, either directly or indirectly, to net<br />
economic benefits in relation to such matters<br />
as production, prices, quality and<br />
range of products and services and<br />
efficiency and technological change which<br />
would be sufficient to justify the increased<br />
degree of foreign control of the particular<br />
industry that would result from the takeover.<br />
If the proposed takeover is judged to<br />
be not against the national interest on this<br />
basis, the following additional criteria will<br />
also be taken into account: Whether, after<br />
the takeover, the firm concerned could be<br />
expected to follow practices consistent with<br />
Australia's interest in matters such as<br />
exports, imports, local processing of materials<br />
produced, research and development,<br />
and industrial relations, including employee<br />
protection; and whether the takeover<br />
would have adverse effects on the Government's<br />
defence objectives, environmental<br />
protection or regional development.<br />
In making judgments as to whether particular<br />
foreign take overs would be against<br />
the national interest on any of the foregoing<br />
grounds, due weight will be given to 3<br />
other matters. One is the extent of Australian<br />
participation in ownership and management<br />
that would remain after the take<br />
over; another is the interests of ' shareholders<br />
of the company subject to the take<br />
over; the third is the attitude of its board<br />
of directors. The Government's consideration<br />
of take over proposals will normally<br />
be in 2 stages. The first stage will involve<br />
preliminary consideration to see whether a<br />
detailed investigation is warranted. This<br />
preliminary consideration will have to be<br />
completed within one month from the date<br />
that the proposal is notified to the Minister.<br />
The Bill does not formally require all<br />
foreign take overs to be notified. But its<br />
effect will be to cause all take overs within<br />
the ambit of the Act to be notified. This<br />
will be because the Government will have<br />
the right to -make orders to reverse take overs that have proceeded without prior<br />
notification. If a conclusion is reached that<br />
further investigation of particular proposals<br />
is desirable, the Minister will have power<br />
to issue an interim order prohibiting implementation<br />
of the proposal for such period<br />
not exceeding 3 months as is necessary for<br />
the further consideration to be given to it.<br />
If no order is made -in respect of a take<br />
over proposal within a period of one<br />
month from notification, it will be free to<br />
proceed. In addition, the Minister will be<br />
able in appropriate cases to grant clearance<br />
certificates in respect of take over proposals<br />
notified to him. A breach of any of the<br />
orders I have mentioned will be an offence<br />
punishable by a heavy penalty. In addition<br />
a Supreme Court will have power, on<br />
application by the Minister, to make further<br />
orders against a person who commits<br />
such an offence. The Court will be able in<br />
such circumstances to restrain the exercise<br />
of voting rights, direct payments to be<br />
withheld, direct the sale of shares, and<br />
make desirable ancillary orders.<br />
In exercising these powers, however, the<br />
Court will be required to satisfy itself, as<br />
far as it reasonably can do so, that any<br />
order it proposes to make will not unfairly<br />
prejudice any person. The Court's powers<br />
are limited where the breach in question<br />
was due to inadvertence and excusable.<br />
Orders made by the Minister under the<br />
proposed Act will have to be published in<br />
the Gazette. Parliament will also be<br />
informed of the making of the orders as<br />
soon as it is practicable to do so. Some<br />
will come into operation on the date of<br />
their publication. Others will operate as<br />
from a later date specified in the order. if<br />
the provisions. I have outlined are to<br />
operate effectively it goes without saying<br />
that the Government will need to be able<br />
to obtain any relevant information and<br />
documents. In particular, information as to<br />
the persons who have beneficial interests in<br />
shares held by nominees will be needed.<br />
The Bill recognises this need and accordingly<br />
empowers the Minister -to requisition<br />
relevant information and documents by<br />
notices in writing.<br />
This Bill is a major step in the implementation<br />
of the Government's decisions<br />
which I announced on 26th September.<br />
The Bill will ensure the effectiveness ot<br />
our decision to prevent foreign take overs </p>
<p>of Australian companies where they are be introduced. With this in mind the<br />
