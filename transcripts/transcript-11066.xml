<p>E&amp;OE....................................................................................................</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, what about the cricket?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh, what a fantastic result. We really are on a roll and the leadership</p>
<p> that Steve Waugh has given has been absolutely magnificent. His innings</p>
<p> last Sunday evening in the first match against South Africa is as</p>
<p> good a one-day innings as I've ever seen and I guess there'll</p>
<p> be a lot of sleepy heads on Monday morning.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Can we have the day off?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, but you can all stay up, in fact, it's almost a matter of</p>
<p> national honour to stay up on Sunday night and cheer the team on.</p>
<p> And I know that millions of Australians will really be getting behind</p>
<p> the team. It's a magnificent climax to what has been a great</p>
<p> World Cup for Australia's great national sport.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, what is your message to Steve Waugh?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, good luck, the whole country is with you.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Are you asking employers to be lenient on Monday?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, look, I don't get into that trivia. I'm just saying</p>
<p> that everybody will want the team to win and I know that there'll</p>
<p> be millions of Australians watching the match right to the finish</p>
<p> and I'll be one of them.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, what about those Kosovar refugees?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, that matter's being handled by the Immigration Minister,</p>
<p> Mr Ruddock. We have been very generous and open-hearted and I am sure</p>
<p> that the overwhelming majority of the refugees feel that way and perhaps</p>
<p> they are embarrassed by the behaviour of [inaudible]. The refugees</p>
<p> are entitled to move around this country. They are not put in detention.</p>
<p> But, of course, it is for the Government to decide the accommodation</p>
<p> that will be provided at government expense. Nobody in their situation</p>
<p> has a right to demand which accommodation will be provided at government</p>
<p> expense. The accommodation offered to them at Singleton is entirely</p>
<p> appropriate, quite adequate and I hope the matter will be intelligently</p>
<p> resolved and I hope that the Australian community does not see the</p>
<p> attitude of this particular group as being typical of the attitude</p>
<p> of the refugees in general because it plainly is not.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Is there any timetable for their departure from Australia?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I don't want to get into that detail. I think people should,</p>
<p> everybody should co-operate in making this work.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, there's some talk this morning of blocking off</p>
<p> the Homebush site to average Australians who haven't got a ticket....[inaudible].</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look, I haven't caught up with all the detail of that. You go</p>
<p> and ask Mr Knight about that.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, what about these lamb talks [inaudible]</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, in a sense no news is good news but we still remain fairly concerned,</p>
<p> indeed, quite concerned and fairly pessimistic because there's</p>
<p> an enormous amount of domestic pressure being applied to the American</p>
<p> administration. But there's a very clear choice here for the</p>
<p> United States and for President Clinton. If it wants to continue to</p>
<p> lead the world towards freer and more open trade it must practise</p>
<p> what it preaches at home. And if it imposes a quota on Australian</p>
<p> lamb exports it will send an appalling signal to the rest of the world.</p>
<p> It will say to the rest of the world you have a ready made excuse</p>
<p> for your own protectionist approaches. But we have done everything</p>
<p> we can and we will continue to do all we can to secure a fair deal</p>
<p> and a fair go for Australian lamb exporters.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>[ends]</p>
