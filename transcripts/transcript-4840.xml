PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 1 OCTOBER 1978<br />
ELECTORATE TALK<br />
Australians understand that unemployment a problem which<br />
concerns governments throughout the world is complex and<br />
not given to simple or instant solutions.<br />
The Government has made it plain that we regard unemployment<br />
as one of the greatest social problems in Australia.<br />
Unemployment can and does cause disillusionment, frustration,<br />
family anxieties and hardship. It's a cruel waste of<br />
community resources a waste Australia cannot afford.<br />
Our concern about unemployment is more than words in Parliamentary<br />
debate. It's more than images. Long before the current debate,<br />
the Government looked ahead and set a number of significant<br />
actions in train.<br />
In October 1976 we set up the Williams Inquiry into the<br />
relationship between education and training and re-training<br />
programmes. This wide-ranging inquiry the first of its kind<br />
for more than a decade followed our concern to make sure<br />
that our education system met the special needs of individuals<br />
and the requirements of the labour market.<br />
The results should be available shortly. It's a report that<br />
should provide the basis for the States and the community to be<br />
involved in its implementation.<br />
More than a year ago, the Government initiated an inquiry under<br />
the chairmanship of Sir John Crawford, to suggest ways in which<br />
Australian industry might best adapt to structural change.<br />
When that important report becomes available, it will merit the<br />
closest study by governments, employers, unions and other groups<br />
in the community.<br />
Just two years ago, the Government set up a separate Department.<br />
of Productivity. We wanted to assist Australian industry<br />
improve productivity and adapt to technological change.<br />
Time and events have shown we acted with foresight.<br />
That Department, under the active leadership of Ian Macphee, is<br />
carrying out valuable work. It has been successful inJ </p>
<p>developing Joint programmes involving management, unions and<br />
State governments in finding ways to increase productivity<br />
particularly through new technology in highly protected<br />
industries. Such close consultations are now underway in the footwear,<br />
clothing, textiles, forging, tyre, tanning and whitegoods<br />
industries. In 1976, the Government also commissioned a detailed examination<br />
of the Commonwealth Employment Service. That inquiry reported<br />
late last year. We acted on the report to upgrade the C. E. S.<br />
to make it a modern, efficient employment and counselling service.<br />
The recent decision to establish a top-level Cabinet committee<br />
under Tony Street's chairmanship to review thoroughly the<br />
basis of industrial relations in Australia and their relationship<br />
to employment is also closely related to this whole issue.<br />
Is the Government meanwhile doing enough to alleviate the hardship<br />
of unemployment while our other objectives fall into place?<br />
The Government offers help to those who do not have jobs and is<br />
providing particular assistance to young unemployed. The N. E. A. T.<br />
Scheme, the Special Youth Employment Training Programme, and<br />
other programmes, are designed to do just this. The programmes<br />
are adapted, changed and improved as we gain further experience<br />
with them.<br />
More than 60,000 young people have already been helped by the<br />
Special Youth Employment Training Programme since its introduction<br />
in October 1976. There are another 40,000 people now in<br />
training under the Scheme.<br />
A further 45,000 young Australians have been helped-under the<br />
Community Youth Support Programme. Also, the Experimental<br />
Programme for Unemployed Young People provides special remedial<br />
education to those young people who have never had a fair go<br />
in their lives.<br />
These are on-going programmes on-going commitments that will<br />
not be stifled by any lack of Government funds.<br />
I have made it clear that in the months ahead the Government will<br />
be virorously seeking to involve the community in the challenge<br />
of unemployment. The Government cannot work alone. We cannot<br />
act in isolation in tackling the problem. We need community<br />
involvement, community co-operation. Government, unions, management,<br />
social welfare groups, education authorities all have a part<br />
to play.<br />
That is one reason Mr Hamer' s initiative in calling a working<br />
conference to discuss the whole question of change and unemployment<br />
deserves strong support.<br />
The Minister for Productivity, and officers of that Department,<br />
will attend the conference. The Department which has been / 3 </p>
<p>working with the States on these issues has particular knowledge<br />
and expertise and will certainly make a constructive contribution.<br />
It's work has been on a region by region, industry by industry,<br />
company by company basis.<br />
Ian IMacphee's Department will also be closely involved in the<br />
Steering committee in establishing the programme and guidelines<br />
for the conference.<br />
The Government earnestly hopes that other States will follow<br />
Mr Hamer's lead.<br />
There is no question that working groups discussions at a State<br />
level, with Federal Government support, can help us get to the<br />
heart of the unemployment problem.<br />
Governments, unions, management and the community can learn<br />
from each other at first hand and build a constructive climate<br />
for debate and policy-making.<br />
This kind of working conference is away from the Canberra<br />
environment where temptation for political grandstanding often<br />
seems irresistable to some participants. People come to Canberra<br />
and leave the problem on the steps, of Parliament House, and then<br />
they depart. But this kind of conference can add greatly to a<br />
national resolve to overcome the problem.<br />
The Government's commitment to overcoming unemployment is<br />
absolute. Our concern for the unemployed remains a high priority.<br />
We will continue to demonstrate that concern by our complete<br />
determination to keep on with the fight against inflation.<br />
There is no doubt whatsoever, this unrelenting course is in<br />
the best long-term interests of Australia.<br />
For this is the only way which will restore basic economic<br />
health and growth to our nation a growth so necessary to<br />
providing more jobs for Australians. </p>
