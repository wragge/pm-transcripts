<p>The Prime Minister has today announced that the Commonwealth Government will make a $250,000 contribution towards the rebuilding of the Dunalley Community Hall.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Gillard visited Dunalley today to meet with members of the local community and see the status of recovery efforts following the devastating bushfires of January this year.</p>
<p>The contribution to the Dunalley Community Hall will build on the other offers of assistance that have been made by local businesses and others.</p>
<p>It will be delivered under the Commonwealth's Community Infrastructure Grants Program, which funds community and social infrastructure identified by local communities as priority investments for their region.</p>
<p>This funding is in addition to the support already being provided under the Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements, which is jointly funded by the Australian Government and the Tasmanian Government.</p>
<p>More information about the assistance that available in Tasmania can be found at <a href="http://www.disasterassist.gov.au">www.disasterassist.gov.au</a>.</p>
