FOR MEDIA 1 MAY 1986<br />
I hayve sent the following letter today to the Honourable<br />
Member for Kooyong.<br />
" Dear Mr Peacock<br />
Further to my answer to your Question without Notice in the<br />
House today on the Chernobyl nuclear accident, I hereby<br />
provide supplementary information on the points you raised.<br />
AS I mentioned in my answer, the Government has been taking<br />
action specifically to address the most immediate concerns<br />
of the health and safety of Australians in the affected<br />
area. We have been in contact with the appropriate overseas<br />
authorities who have access to the relevant data. We have<br />
also been in touch with the International Atomic Energy<br />
Agency ( IAEA).<br />
The Department of Foreign Affairs is co-ordinating<br />
Australia's international response at this stage. All<br />
relevant technical agencies are being kept fully informed<br />
and are a major source of advice. Australia has a<br />
deservedly high reputation for its active commitment and<br />
contribution to nuclear safeguards, as well as the safety<br />
and health aspects of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy.<br />
Although there is no multilateral mechanism which requires<br />
the Soviet Union to seek international assistance in the<br />
event of an accident, the IAEA has radiation emergency<br />
assistance procedures which can be activated at the request<br />
of a member state requiring emergency assistance.<br />
The IAEA, in conjunction with other international<br />
organisations, has also established strict safety standards<br />
for the nuclear industry. The USSR is a member of the<br />
Agency. Adherence to these standards is not mandatory but<br />
it is the normal practice of Western countries, including<br />
Australia, to use them as benchmarKs for regulating their<br />
nuclear industries. The IAEA and other international<br />
organisations have also established international benchmarks<br />
in radiation protection. </p>
<p>I 2<br />
Australia over the years has supported efforts by the IAEA<br />
to create an international nuclear safety convention seeking<br />
to avoid and if necessary cope with disasters such as that<br />
at C-hernobyl. Regrettably they have not yet received the<br />
necessary widespread international support.<br />
The Government believes that the need for international<br />
arrangements should be examined again, particularly in the<br />
areas of early warning and emergency assistance. It is<br />
considering an initiative for multilateral measures to that<br />
end which would be promoted bilaterally as well.<br />
I should like to thank you again for your constructive<br />
contribution to the national debate on this serious and<br />
dis. turbing issue.<br />
Yours sincerely<br />
R. J. L. Hawke<br />
The Hon. Andrew Peacock, MP<br />
Member for Kooyong<br />
Parliament House<br />
CANBERRA ACT 2600" </p>
