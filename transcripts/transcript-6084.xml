TPANSCRIPT Press Conference 15 April 1983<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr. Hawke, the Premiers' Conference that Mr.<br />
Bourke and Mr. Jolly from Victoria suggested might be a good<br />
idea is that going to go ahead?<br />
PM: It will be considered by the Cabinet.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is there going to be another Summit?<br />
PM: How many years to the end of the century 17 aren't there?<br />
JOURNALIST: PM, What did you tell the Unions on superannuation?<br />
What is your ( inaudible).<br />
PM: I had a conversation with them as to what I thought would<br />
happen on this matter. I am glad you have asked the question,<br />
Geoff. Let's get the background to it and what will be<br />
involved. This rather prolonged speculation followed from an<br />
answer which I gave to a question on this matter a couple of<br />
weeks ago and I said all existing expenditure programmes and<br />
taxation expenditures were subject to review. I was asked did<br />
that include the question of the limit of 5% tax on lu. mp sum<br />
superannuation and I said honestly and openly look all things<br />
naturally are under review. That carried no implication of an<br />
intention to impose a tax beyond the 5% tax which is currently<br />
imposed. It carried no implication at all. It was simply an<br />
honest answer saying, look, everything is being looked at. Now<br />
for reasons which I don't quite understand people have given it<br />
a currency which that honest response did not warrant. Because<br />
there has been the speculation, because there have been sonre<br />
concernsabout accelerated resignations I think I can go this far<br />
to say I will have the matter before the Cabinet<br />
so that this can be decided. Because there has been speculation<br />
a number of my Ministers have spoken with me and I can say on the<br />
basis of the conversations I have had, without pre-empting the<br />
decision that will have to be made in the Cabinet procedures that<br />
I think you will find that there has been no basis for the<br />
speculation which I think has been unfortunately. extended beyond<br />
what my initial observation warranted. </p>
<p>L<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, Are Australians looking at paying<br />
more taxes after this Summuit?<br />
PM: I hope they are going to pay some more taxes, if not we'll<br />
all go broke. The sit: uation is quite clear. I Chink with a<br />
very great sense of responsibility the participants at the<br />
conference said if there is to be additions to aggregate<br />
expenditures and the language was very careful, then there may<br />
have to be either an increase in taxes and or reduction in the<br />
expectations about tax indexation. Now that statement from., I<br />
think a very responsible group of people, reflected that they<br />
want the Government to do a number of things. Now what are those,<br />
things that they want the Government to do on behalf of the<br />
people of Australia. They are these. They want stimulatory<br />
action to get the economy moving. They want action which is going<br />
to generate Jobs and, to the very great credit of the conference,<br />
they gave a centrality to the responsibility of this community<br />
to the impoverished and those in need. Now, if you are going to<br />
undertake all these things, and in a way which may involve an<br />
increase in aggregate expenditure, they accepted and realized<br />
and told the Government that if all those things are done which<br />
involve an increase in aggregate expenditure that may be<br />
involved. Now I am simply saying that the Government has been<br />
given an indication to the feeling of representatives of the<br />
community. These will be taken into account. It is quite<br />
impossible for me to say at this stage what specific decisions<br />
the Government will take in an attempt to give effect to the<br />
clearly articulated view of such a representative gathering.<br />
JOURNALIST: At the Conference several Premiers indicated the<br />
desire to have access to overseas funds to fund their own<br />
State deficit which they saw they needed. At the same time<br />
1--business have expressed concern at the level of Government debt<br />
and the possible overseas borrowing. Flow is it that the<br />
Federal Government plans to resolve that conflict?<br />
PM: Oh, it's not a question of resolving a conflict. Let's<br />
look a-t the two issues that are involved and see what happens.<br />
The expression,-if I can take the second part first, the<br />
expression of the concern about the growth of overseas<br />
indebtedness is a legitimate one. You can't just open endedly<br />
say you are going to go on borrowing overseas forever because<br />
you have to service that debt and in time repay it and it is<br />
legitimate that Governments should be warned of the fact that<br />
you just can't do this in an unlimited way. Going to the<br />
first point it is natural enough that States are going to say,<br />
looking at their responsibilities that they would like to be<br />
in a position that they perceive it as being a fact that they<br />
could have access to more funds at lower rates than overseas<br />
markets. I understand that. We will be looking at it, but<br />
we will have, as a Government, to take into account the other<br />
factors which are relevant which are, firstly, if States have<br />
an unlimited access through their authorities to the overseas<br />
market, what effect is that going to have on the borrowing<br />
capacities and qualities that will be attached to the claims of </p>
<p>-3<br />
the Comonwealth and of" other States if they all have that<br />
sort of capacity? Wha t i mpact will that have upon the rates<br />
which we can borrow? W. hat st1-atus would particular<br />
authorities of particular States in fact have on those markets?<br />
Now, we will take into account all those considerations and it<br />
is proper that the States should have raised that concern.<br />
It is a perfectly legitimate one and as requested, we will look<br />
at it.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, How heavily are you prepared to<br />
loan on Unions in the building industry to ensure that your<br />
job creation programmes go ahead with the thought maybe of<br />
deregistration going ahead?<br />
PM: I'm glad you asked that question. I believe that the<br />
ACTU is a totally responsible body and a body with authority<br />
an authority and status which has been considerably enhanced<br />
by the events of the last few days. I believe that the ACTU<br />
has a clear view, and indeed they have publically said so as<br />
well as privately to me, that they have a clear view of the<br />
responsibility of constituent members and that is that a Union<br />
cannot at one and the same -time say that it is part of the<br />
Trade Union Movement, part of the Australian Council of Trade<br />
Unions and t4-hen at the same time say we are not bound by the<br />
democratically arrived at decisions of the ACTU. I firmly<br />
believe that the ACTU will address itself to this problem and<br />
if you take the more pessimistic view that a Union within the<br />
ACTU is going to flout the authority of the ACTU if that were<br />
to happen and I trust that it won't. I trust that all the<br />
Unions will see that they are bound by the decisions of the<br />
ACTU, but if you take the more pessimistic scenario that that<br />
is not to happen, the ACTU moves to take the decisions that are<br />
necessary to ensure that effect is given to its decisions, then<br />
it will have the full support of my Government.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, Can you describe your thinking<br />
of the Queensland Premier ' s attitude in one word?<br />
PM: I think complexities never lend themselves to single word<br />
answers. No, not in one word. I simply say that Ithink it was<br />
rather sad in a number of ways more for the Premier than<br />
anyone else, but he is entitled to express his view and at an<br />
appropriate time he will have the opportunity of asking the<br />
people of Queensland to say in the light of circumstances of the<br />
Summit and subsequently as to whether they share that view and<br />
that will be an appropriate course of action.<br />
JOURNALIST: Would you seek retribution against him, Prime<br />
Minister? PM: No, you know me well enough that I don't operate like that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you mean you won't be campaigning in the<br />
Queensland election? </p>
<p>-4-<br />
PM: That's not retribution, that's democracy in action.<br />
JOURNALIST: What is your judgement now on the wage pause?<br />
PM2: Again, I'm glad you asked that question. At no stage<br />
was it ever put by me that this Summit could be a determiner<br />
of how long a pause would last or what the circumstances<br />
coming up to that pause should be. The people who have tried<br />
to say that in some sense the Summit may have been a<br />
disappointment because i~ t didn't make those decisions betray,<br />
if I may say so, an abysmal ignorance of the Constitution and<br />
institutions of wage fixing in this country. There has been<br />
nothing which could or should stop the rights of Unions or<br />
employers to go to the Arbitration Commission at the end of<br />
the first half of this year. That has always been the case.<br />
There was nothing the Sumimit could have done to stop that.<br />
What has been reflected in the Summit is a recognition of what<br />
the facts are and let me make it quite clear so that it will<br />
not be beyond the comprehension of anyone in this room what<br />
those facts are. Wages can move in this country for one of<br />
two reasons. Firstly, they can move because the Arbitration<br />
Tribunal makes a decision in respect of wages. Alternatively,<br />
they can move because, as a result of a negotiation or action<br />
between Unions and employers, there is a decision between<br />
them that wages shou~ ld move. Now, what the Summiit has done is<br />
to say that in respect of that second area that that will not<br />
be pursued by the Unions, nor be encouraged by the employers.<br />
They have agreed that there shall be a return to the first<br />
method of centralised wage fixation. Beyond t-hat they have<br />
said that there are clear guidelines which should govern<br />
conducts of the parties in terms of applications to that<br />
Commission and that is that there should not be applications<br />
for increases in wages based upon the circumstances of<br />
particular industries but that they should be restricted and<br />
restrained to movements in terms of national prices and at a<br />
later period in respect of perhaps the national productivity.<br />
Now those are very significant achievements and are the limits,<br />
represent the limits, of achievement that was possible within<br />
that Conference and it should clearly be understood that those<br />
were the possible limits and that the Summit has gone a very<br />
long way in transforming into a sensible and realistic<br />
framework what will happen to wage movements in the country.<br />
Now, in explaining all thatC as necessary background to your<br />
question, I am not avoiding your desire to have some view<br />
about likely timetables. Now it seems to me, that it is likely<br />
that the ACTU and employers will make a relatively early<br />
approach to the President of the Commission to begin to have<br />
discussions in ' the light of the decision of the Summit as to<br />
some conference within the Commission to discuss picking up the<br />
tangled and broken threads of the processes of wage fixation in<br />
this country. Now, I would assume, but I can't speak for him,<br />
and. I have not spoken to him, but I would assume that the<br />
President of the Commission would respond at a time of his </p>
<p>5<br />
choosing to such a request by the employers and the AC.<br />
I would assume, therefore, that some time down the track a<br />
conference would be held and again I would assume rhat out<br />
of that conference agreement would be reached as to a t: ie<br />
for a National Wage Case hearing which, clearly, T believe,<br />
would take place in the second half of calendar 19S3, or to<br />
be precise then in financial year terms, after the end of<br />
financial 1982/ 83 and the financial quarter of R3/ S4. Now,<br />
how long that hearing would take when the Commission would<br />
fix the date for such a hearing, how long it would take, and<br />
certainly what the decision would be, I can't say. It seems<br />
to me, however, if my assumptions about the course of action<br />
are accurate, then we would not be seeing, if there were to<br />
be an increase in wages, and I don't know what the decision of<br />
the Commission would be, but we would not be seein7 an increase<br />
if there were to be one, much before the end of third ziarter<br />
calendar 83. Now, I repeat, that is a series of assuL-. tions on<br />
my part on the basis of the very very clear advance and<br />
responsible advances that have been made in respect of waqe<br />
fixation by the Summit.<br />
JOURNALIST: Will you be taking any direct action yourself to<br />
bring the Building Unions into line?<br />
PM: I wish you wouldn't use the word direct action in those<br />
circumstances. No, I believe that the Goverrnent is playing<br />
its role so far through the Minister of Employment and<br />
Industrial Relations, Mr. Willis, who has been involvec/: in<br />
discussions with the Unions and in significant discussions with<br />
the ACTU and he would share my view, I believe, that the ACTU<br />
will, through its own processes ensure the adheranze o: the<br />
Building Unions to the Accord and I am sure that Ralph Willis<br />
would have conveyed that, as I have, to the Unions. The first<br />
step has got to be the Unions, the ACTU themselves, handling<br />
this matter. I have total confidence that the ACTU will handle<br />
this matter in a way which establishes their credibility because<br />
their credibility is on the line. They know that and they<br />
attach such importance to their integrity that I aim sure they<br />
will handle it. </p>
<p>-6-<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, on AM this morning you gave what<br />
would probably be your clearest indication yet about your<br />
Government's intentions towards tax cuts. I think you used<br />
the expression that tax cuts were a lesson. Could you clarify<br />
that please?<br />
PM: I thought that was pretty expressive, Ken, that they are<br />
less likely. I can't make it much clearer than that. What I<br />
said was this and i remember now the context. I started off<br />
that interview by saying that we had shared knowl-edge in a way<br />
that had never been done before and will continue to do it. I<br />
said that the policy proposals of the Labor Party in the period<br />
leading up to the ele':: tion had been drawn up on the basis of<br />
our understanding as to what the budgetary position was. i said<br />
that now that we had the full knowledge of the true budgetary<br />
situation and now tha. t the community had that knowledge, all of<br />
us, not just the Government, but the community, regarded it as<br />
appropriate, in the light of the knowledge we now have, that the<br />
decisions relevant to the fact should be made and obviously t1-he<br />
right decision now in respect of the knowledge we have is one<br />
which would make it very significant1-ly less likely that there<br />
would be an opportunity of any general tax cuts. That would not<br />
preclude the possibility that, in giving effect to the range of<br />
indicated desirable targets for Government action., that there<br />
could be not some assistance to those most in need, but the<br />
possibility of general tax cuts is obviously, to put it at its<br />
lowest, very very much less now in the light of all known facts.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr. Hawke, Somebody also called for an urgent<br />
review of migration policies. Why is it so urgent and when<br />
will it be?<br />
PM: Well, I would have thought that the urgency relates to the<br />
fact that the levels of migration still being followed by the<br />
previous Government could not be realistically justified in the<br />
light of the growing unemployment in this country and those<br />
reviews are already underway. The relevant Departments are<br />
looking at them.. I would believe that before long, I would,<br />
and the Government, would receive submissions from the relevant<br />
Department, and when I say relevant Departments I am clearly<br />
talking about Employment and Industrial Relations as well as<br />
the Department of immigration itself. I would believe that<br />
in a relatively short time submissions in regard to that matter<br />
will be before our consideration.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr. Hawke, can you give further details about<br />
your forthcoming overseas visit. I understand that you are now<br />
going to Geneva and a number of other countries. </p>
<p>-7-<br />
PM: Yes, I will be going to a number of countries. There<br />
are certain details that are in the process of finalisation<br />
and it does involve a question of courtesy to some of the<br />
countries involved. Very early next week I will be able to<br />
make the full details available and if you want a press<br />
conference in regard to that we can have it.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, is Senator Evans going to let you<br />
have an Air Force boeing?<br />
PM: Well, if I can take that as a serious question. If you<br />
want some observations in regard to other matters I am prepared<br />
to make them, but I'd better have a more serious peg on which<br />
to hang an observation.<br />
Inaudible.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, are you prepared to agree to<br />
numerous requests for question time and debates in the House<br />
next week?<br />
PM: I don't think it is appropriate on the 21st. I have<br />
referred Mr. Newman's telegram to SMOS, Mr. Young. You<br />
must treat this with seriousness. It is a very serious issue.<br />
It is clear that the time constraints upon the Parliament are<br />
extremely important. I would have hoped that Mr. Newman, as<br />
well as the rest of the Opposition, would regard as a priority<br />
the requirement of the Parliament to get through the<br />
legislation which will enable our Government to provide the<br />
funds to Victoria and South Australia in regard to bush fire<br />
relief. I would hope that their sense of prioritiJes are not<br />
in the rather desperate political situation in which they find<br />
themselves that they would seek to elevate this relatively<br />
insignificant, but in a sense, not justifiable, incident. I<br />
wouldn't expect that their sense of priorities would be so<br />
perverted that they would want to put that above the assurance<br />
that the people pf South Australia and Victoria, the victims<br />
of the bushfires would be prejudiced. There won't be any<br />
doubt that when we get to May that they can have the fullest<br />
opportunity they want to to discuss this matter and indeed, I<br />
will be encouraging, actively encouraging, the provision of<br />
the widest opportunity in the Parliament for discussing this<br />
issue because, as a matter of purely personal and not political<br />
interest, of course, I would like to just see it clearly spelled<br />
out what the positions are. I put it in the plural, of the<br />
Opposition, in regard as to what has happened in Tasmania. </p>
<p>-8-<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr. Hawke, given that the need to lift public<br />
national confidence is urgent, when will you be in a position<br />
to announce your job-making programmes and at that time, Sir,<br />
will you also announce how you propose to fund those<br />
programmes given the budgetary constraints placed upon you by<br />
the Summit communique, if not common sense?<br />
PM: The answer to your question is that I would expect that<br />
to be able to be done next month.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, do you intend releasing next<br />
year and in future years at about this time the economic<br />
projections of the economic ( inaudible). In other words,<br />
continuing the process.<br />
PM: Yes. When I say yes, the question of timing, let me<br />
kep myself not committed to a specific time, so because we<br />
did it on this day this year it will be<br />
JOURNALIST: It will be about this time.<br />
PM:-Yes. Look, I am not going to be inaccurate in these<br />
matters. As soon as the information is available it will be<br />
released.<br />
JOURNALIST: Can I ask you a question Prime Minister about<br />
the visit of the Chinese Premier on Sunday. It is the first<br />
visit by a Chinese Premier to Australia. I imagine one of<br />
the major issues to be discussed will he the situation in<br />
Indochina at the moment, particularly on the Thai-Kampuchean<br />
border. What line will you be taking with the Premier,<br />
given the known Chinese objections to Labor's policy to<br />
resume aid to Vietnam?<br />
PM: Well I won't be taking a line with Premier Zhao. I Will<br />
be wanting to listen to what he's got to say. And as I've made<br />
it clear before in respect of this matter we will be<br />
discussing with all relevant countries this issue before<br />
we take any action. Bill Hayden is going to the ASEAN<br />
countries very shortly as you know. And it is clearly<br />
appropriate that discussions be held with them. It is<br />
clearly appropriate that he has those discussions. we'l. be<br />
talking with the Premier of China. We will have discussions<br />
with the United States. I'll certainly be talking with<br />
the President of the United States about this when I meet<br />
with him on the 13Th of June. And we will be waiting before<br />
we make any final decisions on this matter until we've had<br />
the opportunity of having all those discussions. </p>
<p>9<br />
Now just let me particularly say in respect of the discussions<br />
with the Chinese Premier that I would understand that he would<br />
be putting to us the reasons which they regard as compelling<br />
why there shouldn't be any change of the Australian position.<br />
We would be opening up all the range of considerations that<br />
obviously are regarded as relevant in this matter including,<br />
as I've said in my earlier statements, the concern that<br />
every country in this region must have about the way in which<br />
that country is forced mnore and more into the Soviet orbit<br />
by the fact that its not receiving assistance from elsewhere.<br />
And that ought to be discussed and will be. So those are<br />
the sorts of discussions that would be held. I'd rather<br />
put it that way than saying putting a line.<br />
PAUL KELLY: Mr Hawke, were you at all concerned or at all<br />
unhappy about the comments Mr Hayden made on his overseas trip<br />
following the latest trouble between Vietnamese and Thais?<br />
And if you were did you arrange or were you responsible for<br />
O any message sent to Mr Hayden about that?<br />
PM: There is a communication that went to our party in<br />
Indonesia and the statements ( plural) that were made by<br />
Mr Hayden in my judgement reflected a very sensible progression<br />
of expression of views. There has been at all points of<br />
Bill Hayden's conduct of the Foreign Ministry of this country<br />
very, very great satisfaction on my part. That has been<br />
consistent, it remains. And let me say in respect of his<br />
visit, I think it was a brilliant and outstandingly successful<br />
performance. I'm happy with all that he did and I believe he<br />
is going to be an outstandingly successful Foreign Minister.<br />
PAUL KELLY: Just on that point though Mr Hawke, were you<br />
unhappy about his original comments and were you responsible<br />
for the modification in those comments?<br />
PM: To say I was unhappy is inaccurate. I believe that as<br />
more evidence became available a stronger statement was<br />
O necessary and desirable a view which is clearly shared<br />
by Mr Hayden. These things aren't static. With each hour<br />
virtually more evidence was becoming available as to what<br />
in fact had happened. And it seems to me whether you're<br />
dealing in economic affairs or international affairs that<br />
you should make judgements according to the information<br />
that you've got. That's what's happened there that's what will<br />
continue to happen.<br />
PAUL KELLY: Have you posed(?) an expression to Mr Hayden<br />
about this matter either during the trip or since he came<br />
back? PM: No I did not speak to Mr Hayden during the trip. Of<br />
course, since he came back we've had discussions aboutthe<br />
whole of his trip. We are at one in respect of what he<br />
did before he went, what he did when he was there and what<br />
he's done since his return. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Mr. Hawke, when the National Wage Case is<br />
convened will the Government be supporting a pay rise?<br />
PM: The position of the Government in respect of the<br />
submissions to the Arbitration Commission will be determined<br />
by the Cabinet when its necessary. I will not be predicting<br />
the position of the Government in terms of the details ofE<br />
our submission.<br />
JOUR14ALIST: Could I ask you a question about the financing<br />
of Houses of Parliament. Is it possible that the<br />
main statement on job creation could also include reference<br />
to revenue measures and some of the results of the expending<br />
review which are now complete?<br />
PM: The answer is yes, it is possible.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, a little while ago you said<br />
that you viewed the RAAF flights over South West Tasmania as<br />
relatively insignificant, but unjustifiable. Why do you<br />
consider they were unjustifiable'and what steps are you taking<br />
to monitor the situation?<br />
PM: As soon as I became aware of it on Monday morning, I<br />
contacted the Minister for Defence and said it had to stop and<br />
it is my understanding that within quarter of an hour of my<br />
issuing that instruction to him he had himself issued the<br />
necessary instructions.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr. Hawke, there has been some concern........<br />
At this stage the tape ran out.<br />
