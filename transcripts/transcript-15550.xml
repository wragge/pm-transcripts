Solomon Islands, nuclear power; polls</p>
<p>E&amp;OE...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well ladies and gentlemen about an hour ago I rang the Prime Minister of the Solomon Islands, Mr Sogavare, to express the concern and sympathy of the Australian public for his nation.  He told me that the death toll had now reached 22 and there was extensive damage to property.  We have already announced an initial contribution of $2 million.  In addition to that the personnel and the other resources of RAMSI, which is largely although not entirely an Australian operation, have been made available to help with the rescue and rebuilding operation that's needed in the Solomon Islands and if there is further assistance that reasonably can be provided we will be willing to do so.  It's quite a strain on a small country and the Prime Minister obviously welcomed our gesture and that of New Zealand and I've agreed with him that we'll continue to work very closely.  I've asked AusAID to do an assessment of further damage that might be in need of assistance.  This is very much a situation where the friends of the Solomon Islands people, and Australia and Australians certainly fall into that category, should be ready to help.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, on another matter, do you agree with the comments of Dr James Lovelock reported in The Advertiser this morning where he says that the, to do nothing about global warming presents a far greater risk than the nuclear industry and then he...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I agree with a lot of the things that Dr Lovelock said including the fact that nuclear power should be on the agenda.  I don't think you can do nothing about global warming, I think that what you should do about global warming are things that don't do more damage than the damage you're trying to prevent and that's why we shouldn't commit ourselves to targets when we don't know the implications of them.  That is why we should have every option including nuclear power on the table and that is why Australia must be careful that it doesn't take unilateral action because if it takes unilateral action we will end up disadvantaging ourselves compared with other countries.  But I've never argued that you do nothing, I've argued that what you do is measured and sensible and practical and in a manner that doesn't damage the national interest.  </p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Do you think that nuclear power was demonised as he said during the cold war and that maybe it's, there's a general view that it's more dangerous than it actually is?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well it is in reality less dangerous than other sources of power generation.  The fourth generation nuclear power stations are very safe.  Many people argue that other forms of power generation and the establishments that produce the power are more dangerous, but there's no doubt public opinion in Australia has shifted on this issue.  The younger generation, especially, do not see it in the negative light and the demonic light that was 20 or 30 years ago and I think that's a very welcome thing. And we have to be open minded enough to have all of the options on the table. You can't call yourself somebody who is sensibly addressing climate change unless you look at all the possibilities.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, two questions on Sheikh Hilali. Do you believe that he needs to explain how he distributed the $70,000 he took and do you feel a police investigation might be warranted?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well anybody who collects money in the name of relieving suffering and so forth has an obligation to account for it. I don't pretend to know all of the details. The money was given voluntarily by the Lebanese-Muslim community in Sydney and I think they are the people who should hold him to account. He, like everybody else, has to obey the law and I am not going to single him out from somebody else.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>We saw a sharp rise in consumer spending yesterday. It seems to be adding to a raft of data showing that the economy is overheating. Would you agree with that? </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I think the economy is very strong and I think that's a good thing.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Are you expecting interest rates to be risen tomorrow?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh look, I am not going to speculate about interest rates.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>The latest Newspoll, is that a sign the Government has reached the depths of despair or the Opposition has peaked?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well the latest Newspoll is better than the previous one but is still bad for the Government. I have never disguised that and we have to work even harder.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Do you welcome the improvement?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well let's put it...everything is relative isn't it?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Peter Beattie was critical of the lack of detail in yesterday's tsunami warning. How do you...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I am surprised because I spoke to Mr Beattie yesterday from my aircraft when I was flying over here. I heard that he was in touch with my office and I rang him, and it was apparently about the tsunami, and he was all charm and sweetness and light and said that there'd been cooperation and thanks John, you know, for ringing back, and everything is all sorted out. Now I think people responded quickly and sensibly and it was a reminder of the need for federal-state cooperation. But when it comes to these things like national emergencies and the like, there shouldn't be political point scoring. I mean I don't know why, particularly after he didn't say that to me when we were on the phone; I mean I was a bit surprised when I heard his comments this morning because when we were on the phone, oh mate; thanks for calling back.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, you were out and about walking in Adelaide this morning...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>I wondered whether you could just say what you...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I think it is the most delightful spot; there is no better walk in Australia than around the Torrens. You've got the magnificent Adelaide Oval in the background, I mean what more could you want in life?</p>
