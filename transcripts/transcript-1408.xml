    <content><![CDATA[<p>PRESS BRIEFING GIVEN BY THE PRIME MINISTER, MR HAROLD<br />HOLT, FOR THE HEADS CF BUREAUX IN THE PARLIAMENTARY<br />PRESS GALLERY AT PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA. 6TH OCTOBER. 1966.<br />MR HCLT: Well, yentlemen,, I think you have had confirmation<br />or at least the announcement about the dates for this Manila Conference being<br />now the 24th and As you are aware, the later dates proposed proved<br />highly inconvenient for both Mr Holyoake and myself and I am very appreciative<br />of the fact that the views which we put on this matter had the effect of brin. g-ing<br />the date of the Conference back to a more manageable point from our view.<br />Mr Holyoake was, I thinkc, in even more difficulty than I over the matter in<br />that his election campaign begins, I understand, a week before ours here in<br />Australia. In addition to that, I am very glad to be able to announce<br />that President Johnson will be making a visit to Australia on his way to Manila.<br />The likely dates of tne visit are 2uith October to 22nd October that is Thursday<br />to the Saturday. Exact times have not yet been worked out and will be affected<br />by the detailed travel arran.-ements that he makes, and the probability that he<br />will be making a short visit to New Zealand on his way here.<br />But this visit to Australia was, as you know, urged by<br />me. I renewed the invitation to L-e President when I saw him earlier in the<br />year, and when it became clear that he would be in this general neighbourhood,<br />then H pressed our request the more strongly. I am sure it is very gratifying<br />to Australians generally to learn that he has now found it possible to include<br />such a visit in his itinerary. I am sure it will be a most valuable visit from<br />our point of view, and in a sense it will be an historic visit as this will be. the<br />first occasion in Australian history that an American President in his period<br />of office has made a visit to this country. We have had two visits by Vice<br />Presidents, and several, of course, by Secretaries of State but this visit will<br />be unique in our experience and all the more welcome on that account.<br />I can't give you any details as yet as to the programme.<br />Not only will we need to clear that with the President but I shall obviously have<br />to examine the possibilities open to him while he is here and make suggestions<br />for consideration which will be designed to see that his time with us is employed<br />to the most effective degree, at the same time taking into account his own<br />wishes. I know, for example, that he would hope to renew his acquaintance<br />with Melbourne where he spent so many happy hours while he was here during<br />the way years, and I could hardly imagine him visiting Melbourne and there<br />would be something of a riot in the land without him including Sydney also in<br />the it!. nerary. Whether it will be possible to extend beyond those possibilities<br />I don't know taking into account, of course, the fact that it would almost<br />certainly be felt appropriate that there should be a Parliamentary function here<br />in Canberra. Parliament will be in session still, at that time, and this would<br />be a most appropriate way of giving a formal recognition and tribute in the<br />courSe of the visit. Will he be staying at Government House?<br />MR HOLT: He may have a personal wish to stay at the Embassy so<br />I can't say at this point of time. I may say that all this has only been cleared<br />up quite recently. / 2</p>
<p>-2-<br />When did you know definitely that he was coming?<br />MR HOL. Well, I thought it was highly likely yesterday, but right<br />from the outset I have been hopeful that this could be arranged. At first<br />it appeared that this would have to be done after the conference, but when<br />the conference was postponed, I pointed out that both in New Zealand and<br />Australia we were getting very close to the opening of an election campaign<br />and I thought it was not desirable in those circumstances that the visit should<br />come following the conference. It was preferable that it should take place<br />before. I am glad it was possible to take this consideration fully into account.<br />Is there a possibility, Mr Prime Minister, that the President<br />might open North-West Cape?<br />MR HLT'.( Laughing) I think geography has a say in a matter of that<br />sort. There ate some complications that we have to sort out. For example,<br />I understand that Sir Henry Bolte is opening the refinery at Westernport on the<br />Friday, and there is a Civic Dinner for me in the Melbourne Town Hall that<br />night. So there are all sorts of adjustments which several of us will need to<br />make in our pro-grammes if the maximum value is to be derived from the visit.<br />C. You spoke of a Parliamentary function, Sir. Do you envisage<br />the President addressing a joint meeting or a banquet, a State Banquet?<br />MR HOLT: Well, I would have thought as on certain other occasions<br />when notable people have visited us we might have a Parliamentary function,<br />either a L. icheon or a Dinner, at which speeches of welcome could be made,<br />and in this case the President reply.<br />Q. Sir, is Mr. Rusk coming as well?<br />MR HOLT; I think that's h~ ghi.,' Jikely,. yes. ; To 4he best of my knowledge<br />he will be in the party. Is the visit being announced from Washington, Prime Minister?<br />MR HOLT: Yes, but I think a little later than here.<br />Q Would you invite the State Premiers to any Parliamentary<br />function<br />MR HOLT: I would like to, more particularly as it is likely there will<br />be several States he won't be able to visit.<br />Do you expect Mr McNamara to be with him too?<br />MR HOLT: Well, I haven't got any detail of the composition of his own<br />delegation, and I think I should leave that for him to announce. We have yet<br />to work out fully our own, but I hope to do some work on that tonight.<br />C. Will Mr Calwell have a chance of speaking with the President<br />while he is in Canberra or while he is in Australia?<br />MR HOLT Well, I think that is a matter to which the American<br />Ambassador would need to give some attention. Certainly we would put no<br />obstruction in Mr Calwell's way.<br />C. He will be coming to Canberra first, will he Sir?<br />MR HOLT: I think that is likely, but again, he will be in his own<br />plane and we'll need to work out a programme which fits in with his travel<br />times of the flight from New Zealand to here whether some period of rest / 3</p>
<p>-3-<br />is desired before he embarks on official talks or functions. These things will<br />all have to be sorted out.<br />Q. You don't think the timing of the visit, Mr Prime Minister,<br />will involve the President in Australian political matters?<br />MR HOLT: Not at that point of time. Well, the political season never<br />closes, in my experience, in this country! There are certainly no political<br />motives behind the visit. It is a visit of goodwell, and I think illustrates the<br />regard in which he holds Australia.<br />Q You seem elated about the visit<br />MR HCLT: Well, it is an historic visit and I am glad to have played<br />some part in adding this particular chapter to the Australian story. But<br />quite apart from that, I do see considerable value in the visit. I think it<br />will focus a good deal of world attention on the interest which the President<br />has been displaying quite clearly now for some time in the problems of<br />Asia. There is a very interesting speech, incidentally, on that, and the<br />Asian situation generally, which I recommend the specialists amongst you<br />to study in this last issue of the US News and World Report. This was the<br />text of the speech by President Marcos to the Congress recently. Those of<br />you who have been following what I said earlier in the year on some of<br />these Asian matters will be interested, I think, to see how closely the views<br />of the President of the Philippines worked out in relation to those which I<br />expressed earlier.<br />Q. Sir, will the people of Sydney and Melbourne have every<br />opportunity to see the President by way of open-car parades or something?<br />MR HCL'r: Well, having brought him here, we don't want to keep him<br />on ice somewhere. We would most certainly hope that there would be<br />opportunities for him to see and be seen by as many Australians who find<br />themselves able to take advantage of the visit. But we can't say at this<br />point of time just what the programme is, but it certainly is not going to be<br />designed as a programme confined to officialdom or to Parliamentarians.<br />Q. Mrs Johnson is she coming too?<br />MR HOLT: I have no firm confirmation on that. I am still hoping<br />thiat she will be. What about the " gals"? Are they coming?<br />MR HOLT: V13ll, they will be very welcome ( Laughter) and we have<br />made that clear. But, again, I will be able to fill you in on quite a few of<br />these details later on<br />Q. Are you despatching a senior officer of your Department<br />to the United States forthwith to discuss the detailed arrangements?<br />MR HOLT: V-ell, Waller, our Ambassador in Vjae-hington is right<br />on top of this. In fact, we would probably bring WV; aller out here after<br />there has been further discussion on the details. We have got thorougkay.<br />adequate staff there, and, of course, Mr Hasluck is currently in New York.<br />Q. What about the security arrangements? These would be<br />fairly substantial.<br />MR HOLT: I have no doubt. And I am expecting a minor invasion<br />of gentlement of the Press! Not merely of the United States Press, but<br />I would think this would attract the interest of Asian Press as well. But,<br />again, you are asking me abou ponso etail which have not been . reablved.</p>
