    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE...........................................................................................................</p>
<p>Thank you very much Mr Ambassador and I first of all particularly</p>
<p>   acknowledge the presence of a number of very senior Ministers in</p>
<p>   the Government of Thailand. </p>
<p>I have had the opportunity over the past two days of spending quite</p>
<p>   a lot of time with your Prime Minister and with senior members of</p>
<p>   the Government and I appreciate very much, as I know all of the</p>
<p>   members of my party do, the gracious hospitality and the welcome</p>
<p>   that has been extended to all of us. Of course, my visit and the</p>
<p>   visit of many Australians here at present is particularly to honour</p>
<p>   the contribution of our countrymen in the past to the defence of</p>
<p>   liberty and the contribution of many others, and that is something</p>
<p>   about our past that we respect and we honour and we salute, but</p>
<p>   tonight I would like to say something about the present and about</p>
<p>   the future.</p>
<p>I would like to start by saying how much I respect and admire the</p>
<p>   very practical, the very diligent and the very courageous way in</p>
<p>   which the Government and the people of Thailand are tackling the</p>
<p>   severe economic difficulties that are facing your country at present.</p>
<p>   It is no easy task to undertake compliance with the conditions of</p>
<p>   the International Monetary Fund programme. That particular programme,</p>
<p>   to which Australia has been a contributor to the tune of US$1 billion,</p>
<p>   and in fact Australia along with Japan, are the only two countries</p>
<p>   in the world that have contributed to each of the three rescue packages</p>
<p>   organised by the International Monetary Fund in the Asian Pacific</p>
<p>   region for Thailand, Korea and Indonesia. I understand very much</p>
<p>   the social implications of some of the measures that are being undertaken.</p>
<p>It is easy for those distant from the Governments of the countries</p>
<p>   affected to lay down rules of compliance and to set benchmarks and</p>
<p>   to require responses. The decisions that must be made on the ground,</p>
<p>   the decisions that have to be made which affect the livelihood of</p>
<p>   the people of the countries affected carry a lot more responsibility</p>
<p>   and imply a great deal more pressure. I admire very much the efforts</p>
<p>   of your Prime Minister and the efforts of the members of your Government</p>
<p>   in implementing that package. </p>
<p>The association between Thailand and Australia is a very deep one.</p>
<p>   There are more than 50 000 Australians of Thai descent and Thailand</p>
<p>   and Thai culture has made a very significant impact, particularly</p>
<p>   on the major cities of Australia. The Ambassador reminded me that</p>
<p>   in Sydney and Melbourne alone, there are in each of those two cities</p>
<p>   three to four hundred Thai restaurants. I ought to say that before</p>
<p>   I dined more regularly at the Lodge in Canberra, there was a restaurant</p>
<p>   I used to frequent quite a lot called the Ruen Thai in Kingston</p>
<p>   and it's a very, very nice eating establishment, indeed, but</p>
<p>   if there are any representatives of other Thai restaurants here</p>
<p>   tonight, please forgive me for not having given you a commercial.</p>
<p>But the links are friendly. They are deep, they are genuine and</p>
<p>   I am very proud of the fact that my country was able to help Thailand</p>
<p>   in her time of need, and I am not shy in saying that our economy</p>
<p>   was strong enough to be able to render that assistance and I am</p>
<p>   not shy in saying that had a little bit to do with the skilful policies</p>
<p>   that my Government has followed. </p>
<p>But being part of a region, being a part of the Asia Pacific region,</p>
<p>   carries benefits and responsibilities. It gives us as a nation,</p>
<p>   which occupies, as I often say, a unique intersection of history,</p>
<p>   geography and economic circumstance. We are a country that has deep,</p>
<p>   historical links with Europe. We have had a long association with</p>
<p>   North America with whom we share great traditions of liberal democracy</p>
<p>   but we are geographically located in the Asia Pacific region, and</p>
<p>   our own society is a marvellously successful experiment in bringing</p>
<p>   people from all parts of the world and producing a tolerant, harmonious</p>
<p>   nation of 18 million people who respect the cultural differences,</p>
<p>   who understand that beneath the overriding loyalty to the values</p>
<p>   and the traditions and the interests of Australia, people are entitled</p>
<p>   to retain an affection and a love of their mother culture, and that</p>
<p>   is something which is respected in Australia.</p>
<p>  We do have this sort of unique position and I am very proud of the</p>
<p>   fact that we have been able to be of help to Thailand and it's</p>
<p>   very important as we look to the future, we remember of course in</p>
<p>   that old cliche, the lessons of the past, and one of the very positive</p>
<p>   lessons of the past is represented by the fact that so many people</p>
<p>   here tonight graduated from universities in Australia and the hosts</p>
<p>   tonight of course include the Alumni of Australian Universities.</p>
<p>   I have found particularly in the time that I have been Prime Minister,</p>
<p>   as I have travelled around the Asian Pacific region, that rich legacy</p>
<p>   represented by initially the Colombo Plan, and then building on</p>
<p>   that a long tradition of encouraging scholarly links between the</p>
<p>   peoples of the region and the people of Australia. I want to thank</p>
<p>   all of those who have been involved in that education process. I</p>
<p>   want to thank those who are promoting it into the future and I am</p>
<p>   very pleased that part of the visit that I have paid here has involved</p>
<p>   some announcements in that particular area.</p>
<p>Beyond all of that, I want to strike a note of positive thought.</p>
<p>   I want to speak optimistically about the future of the region. I</p>
<p>   know that Thailand, along with other countries, is going through</p>
<p>   difficulty but I also know that fundamentally, there are strengths</p>
<p>   in the Thai economy just as there are strengths in the Indonesian</p>
<p>   economy and strengths in the Korean economies that weren't</p>
<p>   there 20 or 30 years ago. The process of economic globalisation</p>
<p>   and trade liberalisation is unstoppable. It may along the way be</p>
<p>   tempered. There may need to be local adjustments to accommodate</p>
<p>   social pressures and social circumstances but we are all together</p>
<p>   committed to a more open trading system. </p>
<p>The APEC goal is a fine goal and it's a goal that in the years</p>
<p>   ahead that will enrich and not rob the people of the APEC countries.</p>
<p>   It's a goal that if realised, will unlock investment opportunities</p>
<p>   and unlock employment opportunities which are not now available</p>
<p>   to the peoples of the region. I am a great optimist about those</p>
<p>   APEC goals. I do believe that the foundations which have been laid</p>
<p>   are very solid ones and the current economic difficulties are not</p>
<p>   going to crack them. I hear people talk in very doomsaying terms</p>
<p>   on occasions about the strength of the Japanese economy. Japan's</p>
<p>   economy is fundamentally one of the most powerful in the world and</p>
<p>   the contribution that Japan in the years ahead will make to the</p>
<p>   economic strength and the economic durability of the world will</p>
<p>   continue to grow and be quite immense.</p>
<p>All big economies from time to time will go through difficulties.</p>
<p>   The Japanese economy of course is no exception but the fundamental</p>
<p>   strengths of huge overseas balances of low inflation, the cultural</p>
<p>   discipline of high savings and a very powerful work ethic and a</p>
<p>   remarkable export performance, put all of those together, it is</p>
<p>   still fundamentally a very, very powerful player on the world economic</p>
<p>   scene.</p>
<p>My own Government has undertaken a number of major economic reforms</p>
<p>   which are designed to strengthen our capacity not only to grow at</p>
<p>   home, and I am very happy to say that our projected growth rates</p>
<p>   next year are the highest amongst the OECD and our inflation rates</p>
<p>   the lowest, and we have seen some of the lowest interest rates that</p>
<p>   Australians have experienced in their lifetime. Those reforms will</p>
<p>   also enable Australia to play a more vigorous role around the world.</p>
<p>   60 per cent of Australian exports now go to the Asian Pacific region.</p>
<p>   We are forever politically, culturally and economically part of</p>
<p>   this region and we are a very active and a very positive player.</p>
<p>   We are a good friend. We are not a fairweather friend. We are a</p>
<p>   friend for the long journey and for the long distance.</p>
<p>  Can I particularly address some remarks to my fellow countrymen</p>
<p>   and women who are here tonight as businessmen and women in Thailand</p>
<p>   and in the Asia Pacific region. You are not only making wise investment</p>
<p>   decisions and contributing to the well-being of your own companies</p>
<p>   and your own corporations but you are also demonstrating to other</p>
<p>   Australians that so much of our economic future lies in this part</p>
<p>   of the world. It's very important, simply because the nations</p>
<p>   of the region have gone through a few economic difficulties, it's</p>
<p>   very important that we reaffirm just how strongly committed we are</p>
<p>   as a nation and as a group of men and women to economic involvement</p>
<p>   in the Asian Pacific region. Just as it was always foolish to say</p>
<p>   that the only economic region in the world that mattered to Australia</p>
<p>   was the Asia Pacific region, that was never true. We have important</p>
<p>   links and important destinies in other parts of the world. Equally,</p>
<p>   it is foolish now to believe that just because a number of countries</p>
<p>   in the region are going through some difficulties, that in some</p>
<p>   way the fundamental importance of this region to Australia has in</p>
<p>   some way been dramatically discounted. </p>
<p>It hasn't. The nations of the Asia Pacific region will grow</p>
<p>   again and grow strongly again and they will do so in the very near</p>
<p>   future. They will do so because, particularly in the case of Thailand,</p>
<p>   they are led by men and women who are committed to sensible economic</p>
<p>   reform, who are prepared to accept the responsibilities of economic</p>
<p>   restructuring, who are prepared to sensibly use the economic aid</p>
<p>   that has been given to them by countries such as Australia.</p>
<p>  Ladies and gentlemen, our two countries have a lot of history. They</p>
<p>   have a lot in common at present but most importantly of all, they</p>
<p>   have a great future together. I think the contribution that we have</p>
<p>   been able to make to strengthening the bonds between the countries</p>
<p>   of the region are very, very significant.</p>
<p>I want to thank my two hosts tonight for this reception but more</p>
<p>   than that, I want to congratulate both of you, the Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>   and the Alumni for the contribution that both of you make to what</p>
<p>   is of course the most important linkage of all between two nations,</p>
<p>   and that is the linkage of people, the associations of common experiences,</p>
<p>   business, personal, social and economic and also the exchange of</p>
<p>   cultures, the exchange of ideas and the building over the years</p>
<p>   of mutual respect and mutual affection. </p>
<p>I am particularly touched by the fact that I have this opportunity</p>
<p>   of speaking to you tonight on Anzac Day which means so much as all</p>
<p>   the Australians in the audience know to the calendars of Australia</p>
<p>   and New Zealand. I wish all of you well. I thank my Thai hosts most</p>
<p>   sincerely. I had the opportunity of an audience with the King this</p>
<p>   afternoon. I thank the Prime Minister for whom I have great personal</p>
<p>   regard for the job that he is doing. I thank the Ministers and I</p>
<p>   most particularly thank my hosts and I wish all of you great success</p>
<p>   and great happiness and great prosperity into the future. </p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>ENDS</p>
