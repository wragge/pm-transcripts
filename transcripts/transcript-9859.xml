PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
HOWARD DODGING AND WEAVING<br />
The Opposition Leader was at his most slippery on Meet the Press today<br />
sending a clear signal that he intends to conceal his true policies from the<br />
public until after the election.<br />
Mr Howard has very little to say on a range of important national issues, and<br />
what he does say simply cannot be believed. Whether it be pensions,<br />
Medicare, industrial relations, media ownership, or economic management,<br />
Mr Howard cannot be trusted.<br />
He refused this morning to match the Government's undertaking to maintain<br />
pensions at 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. If the Labor<br />
Government had adopted the Howard approach to pensions, single<br />
pensioners would be $ 20 a week worse off, and couples $ 34 a week worse<br />
off. Mr Howard wants to dump an important social commitment of this<br />
Government, but he won't admit it.<br />
On Medicare, Mr Howard made the extraordinary claim that the changes<br />
made by the Fraser Government to the then universal Medibank scheme did<br />
not amount to " dismantling."<br />
The Fraser Government, of which Mr Howard was a senior member,<br />
produced five separate health systems in seven years each one more<br />
complicated, discriminatory, expensive and confusing than the last.<br />
Now Mr Howard says he won't " dismantle" Medicare or bulk-billing. Don't<br />
believe him. This is the man who once described bulk-billing as " an absolute<br />
rort." On industrial relations, Mr Howard dishonestly tried to deny he intended to<br />
abolish the role of the Industrial Relations Commission. </p>
<p>He doesn't deny saying of the Commission: " We'll stab them in the stomach."<br />
And he cannot deny saying in May 1991: " There will be nobody in this room<br />
happier than I will be when the role of the Industrial Relations Commission in<br />
the wage fixing processes of this country is reduced to nothing more than an<br />
optional extra."<br />
For Mr Howard now to play with words, as he did on television this morning,<br />
is simply not credible.<br />
On media ownership, Mr Howard will throw diversity to the wolves. Put<br />
simply, he is prepared to allow a single proprietor to own a major television<br />
network and a metropolitan newspaper in the same city. He is prepared to<br />
sacrifice diversity of media ownership to buy the support of influential media<br />
proprietors. He confirmed this last week when he and the Coalition voted<br />
against the Government's legislation tightening the cross media ownership<br />
provisions. CANBERRA 26 November, 1995 </p>
