FOR PRESS: PM1s 91/ 1972_<br />
AUSTRALIA HOUSE<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, the RL Hon. William McMahon, CH, MP.<br />
Arrangements are now in hiandi to enable transfer of<br />
responsibility for the administration of the Australian High<br />
Commission, London, to the Department of Foreign Affairs as from<br />
1 November 1.972.<br />
The decision was made some months ago. I discussed it<br />
with the British Prime Minister, MR Heath, during my visit to<br />
London last ycar, and the transfer was referred to by rmy colleague,<br />
the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in the course of a statement on<br />
Australian foreign policy prese~ nted to the Parliament on 9 May 1972.<br />
This decision to transfer responsibility for Australia<br />
House does not in any way changa the special relationship which<br />
the Australian peoplo and their successive Governments have with<br />
Britain anc6 British Governments a relationship symbolised and<br />
exemplified by the link with the Crow~ n.<br />
It takes place again~ st the background of Britain's entry<br />
into Europe. Tho resulting interaction between Britain's policies<br />
and those of her European partners will impose new demands for a<br />
detailed understanding by Australia in areas which are in large<br />
part the concern of the Minister and3 Department of Foreign Affairs.<br />
I want to express publicly my gratitude to the Australian<br />
High Commissioner and all those employed by Australia Houso in<br />
London, for the excellent service they havc given to the Australian<br />
Government and people while Australia House has been under my<br />
administation and that of my predecessors over the past 60 years.<br />
The same devotion and quality of service will of course continue<br />
as Australia House passes unior the administration of the Foreign<br />
Minister and his Department.<br />
The Australian High Commissionor in London will continue<br />
to be appointed by the Prime Minister, in consultation with the<br />
Foreign Vinister, and tho organisational arrangements being made will<br />
permit continuance of the channols of diract communication which<br />
exist betwoen the Primo Mi. nisters of Great Britain arnd Australia<br />
and tirough their respective High Commissioners.<br />
CAN BE RRA<br />
