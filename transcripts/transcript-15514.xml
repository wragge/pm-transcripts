    <content><![CDATA[<p>Like all Australians I am deeply concerned by the Burmese regime's heavy-handed attempt to suppress peaceful pro-reform protests in Burma, and moved by the demonstrators' courage and commitment. Reports that the security forces have killed a number of protesters and arrested many others, including Buddhist monks, are of particular concern. </p>
<p>To underline Australia's dismay at the regime's actions and our concern for the welfare of the Burmese people, the Government will move to implement targeted financial sanctions against regime figures and supporters.</p>
<p>In addition:<br />
 * the Foreign Minister, Mr Downer, has instructed our diplomatic missions in Beijing, New Delhi and key Southeast Asian capitals to make high-level representations encouraging host governments to use their influence with the Burmese regime to counsel restraint and push for genuine reform;<br />
   * we support a strong UN role, including urgent discussion of the situation by the Security Council and a visit to Burma by the UN Secretary-General's envoy, Ibrahim Gambari, also as a matter of urgency;</p>
<p>* we have in place strict visa restrictions on travel to Australia by senior regime figures and their associates, and will continue to ensure they are as comprehensive and effective as possible; and<br />
   * we will maintain our longstanding ban on all defence exports to Burma.</p>
<p>Our objective remains to maximise the pressure on the regime while avoiding harm to the Burmese people.</p>
<p>This distasteful regime has been repressing the legitimate democratic aspirations of the people of Burma for far too long. The Australian Government calls on the regime to respect their legitimate right to peaceful protest and to begin the process of genuine reform the country so desperately needs.  </p>
