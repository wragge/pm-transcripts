RICHARD COLVILLE -CONVERSATIONS<br />
Question: Prime Minister, a lot of people seem to be concerned about what<br />
might have happened to Australian soldiers as a result of the use<br />
of herbicides in Vietnam. You were Minister for Defence, I believe.<br />
What can you tell us? What is going on? What is the Government doing?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
First I would just like to remind people why herbicides were used.<br />
In : a very real sense, it was a protective device for Australian<br />
soldiers themselves. In jungle areas and tropical climates of heavy<br />
rainfall;., the Viet Cong were very good at coming in close to positions<br />
using the jungle as cover-for the protection of fixed positions.<br />
If you could knock down the growth for a distance around those<br />
positions, then obviously, your own people are getting earlier<br />
warning, and therefore be more secure. Also, if it were a question<br />
of trying to clear the Viet Cong out of the area, if the jungle again<br />
could be knocked down through the use of defoliants, it made the<br />
operation a less hazardous one for your own troops. I mention that<br />
so that peo] ple will understand the reason for the use of defoliants,<br />
which, jS itself quite responsible and sensible. The Department of<br />
Veterans' Affairs is at the moment assessing the best way in which<br />
these matters should be handled. There is a question of how the<br />
examination ought to be conducted, and I hope very much that matters<br />
can be put before the Government quite shortly in relation to that.<br />
I had spoken to Evan Adermann through the course of last week about<br />
the negotiations and consultations that the Department has already<br />
conducted. But there is obviously going to be a great deal of<br />
work to do to assess the position and make sure that any claims<br />
are properly assessed and to make sure that people who have been<br />
harmed, hurt or damaged as a result of use of defoliants, that<br />
the Government does what it can about it.<br />
You can certainly understand the seriousness of the position,<br />
the tragedy of the position if people have been hurt and if<br />
there are serious family problems as a result of the use of<br />
defoliants. I think that has yet got to be proved, because<br />
that is what the Department of Veterans' Affairs is all about.<br />
It is there to look after the interest of ex-servicemen, and I<br />
believe it has got a very good and a proud record. There is no<br />
country in the world that looks after its ex-servicemen better<br />
than Australia. I think that is one of the proud claims of all<br />
Australians. Question: And if it should be proved that these servicemen were injured as<br />
a result of their service, they would be eligible for compensation?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
obviously, if it is as a result of war service, then people have<br />
to come within the provisions of the Repatriation Act. There won't<br />
be any question about that. It is a question of how matters can<br />
be properly assessed, and the Department of Repatriation is / 2 </p>
<p>2-<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
examining this and what ought to be put to the Government. I am<br />
not giving any guarantee of time, but I hope<br />
something can be put to us in the coming week.<br />
That won't end the matter. There will be a process of examinations<br />
going on after that. It is about how the, matter should be conducted<br />
which the Department is now directing its attention to. I make<br />
no guarantees, but I hope so.<br />
Question: Another subject causing widespread concern, everywhere around the<br />
world, is Afghanistan. We have had some horrifying evidence being<br />
given over the past few days. What kind of information are you<br />
getting from your sources, either to confirm that, back it up<br />
or what?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Most of the evidence comes from refugees. One of the remarkable<br />
things about the Soviet Union is that when it becomes involved in<br />
international events, it has a great capacity to cause a massive<br />
flow of refugees in Kampuchea, refugees into Thailand, Afghanistan<br />
refugees into Pakistan. In Pakistan, there are about half a million,<br />
and I think they are expecting the numbers to go to about a million.<br />
Evidence from refugees has indicated that in one case, a village in<br />
Afghanistan, and this was quite some time ago, was virtually<br />
massacred. Some stories say everyone over the age of<br />
about 7. were just lined up and shot. That is because the<br />
people from that district had been showing resistance..<br />
Now, this is the kind of ruthlessness of which we know the<br />
Soviets are capable. When I reported to the Parliament about<br />
this matter several weeks ago, I indicated that the whole world<br />
had recoiled in horror when 400 or 500 people in a Eurpean town<br />
were lined up and shot by the Nazis because o f the murder of a<br />
particular Nazi. The world recoiled in horror because of that.<br />
But two or three times the number have-been murdered in this one<br />
particular extermination of an Afghan village. It seems to me<br />
that people are more inclined to let it go over their shoulder.<br />
There is a feeling around that people don't want to be involved<br />
in Afghanistan, or in the consequences of it. There is no doubt<br />
Afghanis are fighting in many areas, very resolutely. There is<br />
no doubt also. There is no doubt also that the Soviets are using<br />
the armaments of a very sophisticated and modern army. The refugees<br />
are again giving a good deal of evidence to indicate the use of<br />
poison gas, We do know that there are gas units in Afghanistan,<br />
they are* chronic in : the Soviet army, which would certainly have<br />
the capacity to use gas either out of aircraft or through artillery<br />
shells. So it would not be surprising and the circumstantial evidence<br />
is now starting to be quite strong. Here we have the brutal suppression<br />
of a people. Initially, of course, there was horror in the minds of<br />
many Australians when, onthe television screen they saw Soviet tanks<br />
moving forward and Afghans being pushed aside. But, it seems to<br />
recede, to getoff the front pages. It is not on the news services<br />
to the same extent. The horror goes on, but we tend to forget it<br />
and pretend that it is does not happen so it is not on our conscience<br />
quite so much. / 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
Question: In view of all this, how do you feel about Mr Wran's offer to subsidise<br />
New South Wales' athletes to still go on to Moscow?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I think this is one of the greatest pieces of political opportunism.<br />
I am not too sure that hypocrisy isn't a more appropriate word.<br />
because Mr Wran knows that what is happening in Afghanistan has been<br />
condemned by 104 nations in the United Nations and the Islamic<br />
conference. He also knows that people who watch the Soviet Union<br />
and who understand the Soviet Union all believe that an effective<br />
boycott would be the best way of getting the message through to<br />
the Soviet government and people.<br />
Mr Hayden also says that. But then the Labor Party here tries<br />
to work against the establishment of that kind of effective boycott,<br />
and I think we are entitled to ask why. If it is the most effective.<br />
way of getting the message through, and if they do condemn the<br />
invasion as they say, why then do they not want the message got<br />
through. Why do they work against an effective boycott?<br />
I think people sometimes believe that the Australian government<br />
is acting in advance of others in this particular issue but that<br />
is not so. In our own part of the world, the governments of Singapore,<br />
Malayasia, the Philippines, I think also Indonesia' certainly<br />
Papua and New Guinea, Fiji and New Zealand all believe that there<br />
ought to be an effective boycott of the Olympic Games.-because that<br />
would get the message through.<br />
There.. was a delegation from the ASEAN countries in my office this<br />
last week. They praised the Australian government for the forthright<br />
way in which it had spoken out on the issue, because they understand<br />
the seriousness of it. They don't want a Soviet Union * spending<br />
$ 3 million a day supporting the invasion of Kampuchea, and they are<br />
much closer to it. I find it very difficult to undertstand those<br />
who suggest that business would go or, as usual. We have got to<br />
get the message through, and we have got to p~ revent the world making<br />
the same tragic mistake as it did in the last of the 1910s.<br />
Question: A lot of people still adhere to the view, and Lord Killanin is one<br />
of them, that sport and politics just shouldn't mix, and you shouldn't<br />
really be interfering in something like this.<br />
Prime Minis-ter:<br />
The Australian government in the past tried to adhere to that point<br />
of view, and in relation to apartheid in sport over South Africa<br />
where there was a racial segregation in relation to sport. If they<br />
claim that they government is involving politics in sport, then it<br />
is very difficult, indeed impossible, for other countries to maintain<br />
the view that sport and politics are separate. But in the Soviet Union<br />
sport is political business. It is run by the state as everything<br />
else is. A large part of the sporting teams are in the army they<br />
are professional sportsters, if you like. But'let me, if I may,<br />
quote something from the Soiet Union itself in a document called<br />
" Soviet Sports Questions and Answers", published in Moscow.<br />
" The view popular in the West that sport is outside politics finds<br />
no support in USSR. This view is untenable. in our country. When<br />
for instance, Soviet representatives called for the expulsion of / 14 </p>
<p>-4<br />
Prime Minister: ( cont.)<br />
South African/ Rhodesian racists from the Olympic movement, this is<br />
of course, a political move. So whenever somebody says that sport<br />
lies outside the framework of political relations, we feel the<br />
remark is not a serious one"<br />
Now, that is how the Soviet union judges it. But in relation to the<br />
Moscow Olympics, Lord ' Killinan has tried to say sport and politics<br />
should be separate. But then, a week after they have taken that viewthe<br />
International Olympic Committee Taiwan was expelled from the<br />
Olympic movement on totally political grounds. Earlier South Africa<br />
had been expelled on totally political grounds.<br />
So, the heads of the bureaucracy of the Olympic movement would appear<br />
to have very plain double standards. If it is to pursue something<br />
like they want'-in other words, the Moscow Olympics they try to<br />
pretend that fiction that sport and politics must be kept separate,<br />
is a real one. But then, when other matters come in a week. later,<br />
they adopt a different principle that spoil these kind of politics<br />
and expel countries from the Olympic movement or states from the<br />
Olympic movement.<br />
I don't'think the International Olympic Committee has done the<br />
Olympic movement any good at all, because its behaviour over this<br />
issue has exposed double standards and a very selective demonstration<br />
of morality.<br />
Question: Prime Minister,! what is your reaction to the demonstration at<br />
Monash University last night?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I think it is probably to be expected of Monash. Apart from going in<br />
the door and a couple of people trying to through eggs and tomatoes<br />
from a long distance, they might have hit one or two people, but<br />
it is a real disappointment that they didn't hit Tamie and-myself.<br />
But, I think it is a pity. Universities are meant to be the home<br />
of freedom, of intellectual and academic freedom, freedom of thought.<br />
It ought to be there case where there is tolerance in differing<br />
political views.<br />
Three years, of course, I went to Monash to the opening of a centre<br />
of buildings for the study of handicapped children the Krongold<br />
Centre as it is called. The police were not ready on that occasion.<br />
It was a serious, and could have been in real terms, a dangerous<br />
situation because there was a mob almost out of control.<br />
There is a very strong Liberal group at that university there<br />
has been right -through. They have maintained their beliefs and their<br />
convictions publicly in the university against considerable difficulty.<br />
At an earlier point, I think one or two of them were quite badly beaten<br />
up because of their political conviction. That is one reason why I<br />
like to give them the encouragement and support by appearing at<br />
Monash in particular. They have shown courage in the past by carrying<br />
the Liberal banner, the Liberal ideal, when it has not been popular<br />
or fashionable in the university. . Therefore, because of that<br />
in particular, I have been very happy to support them. </p>
<p>5<br />
Prime Minister: ( cont.)<br />
Last night was a celebration of 25 years and was organised very<br />
well. It was a magnificent lecture theatre, and they could make<br />
an awful lot of noise outside, but the lecture theatre is so<br />
well constructed that you can't hear any of it from the inside.<br />
If they think they are disrupting you, you are not ever aware<br />
that they exist. So, the demonstratorswere happy outside and<br />
we were happy doing what we wanted to do.<br />
Question: Do you think demonstrations at Monash against you will become<br />
an institution? It seems that every time you go there there is<br />
one arranged for you.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
You had better ask me that question in 15 or 20 years time.<br />
Question:<br />
Will you go back there if you are invited?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Of course I would. </p>
