l~&gt; AUSIT AI<br />
PRIME MINISTER PRESS STATEMENT N._<br />
23 April 1975<br />
ARTHUR BOYD'S GIFT TO NATIONAL GALLERY<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam, announced<br />
today that the Interim Council of the Australian<br />
National Gallery has accepted the generous offer<br />
of a gift from one of Australia's most prominent<br />
artists, Mr Arthur Boyd, who has presented to the<br />
Gallery a large collection of his work dating from<br />
his earliest years as an artist. The gift is<br />
conservatively valued at $ 1,900,000.'<br />
Mr Whitlam said that the Interim Council was<br />
most enthusiastic in its praise of this gift, which<br />
includes over two hundred paintings in various media,<br />
from 1938 until 1974, two tapestries, more than<br />
a thousand drawings, a group of ten sculp tures in<br />
bronze and ceramic, and a small group of pastels.<br />
As well, Mr Boyd has given a large and important<br />
collection of his graphic work. This last consists<br />
of approximately 800 etchings, aquatints, drypoints<br />
and lithographs and includes many etching plates<br />
which have never been printed or released. Mr<br />
Boyd is to allow the Gallery to print these in<br />
limited editions and sell them for the Gallery's<br />
purposes. This generous offer is of great value both<br />
to the Gallery and to the public, who will have<br />
available to them in this way the work of one of Australia's<br />
greatest artists.-<br />
Mr Whitlam went on to say that the Gallery's<br />
Australian collection could not but be considerably<br />
enriched by this generous gift from a famous<br />
Australian artist, for it would not only further the<br />
aim of the Gallery to have the best examples of<br />
visual arts in all its forms but also give the<br />
Australian people an opportunity to see in depth the<br />
work of an artist who had played a significant role<br />
in an important stage in the development of Australian<br />
art. </p>

The Prime Minister also announced that in<br />
addition to making a gift of his own work, Mr Boyd,<br />
together with other members of his family<br />
Messrs, David and Guy Boyd, Mrs Lucy Beck and<br />
Mrs Mary Perceval had presented the Gallery with a<br />
large group of paintings by their late father, Merric<br />
Boyd. This was another valuable and generous gift<br />
from a munificent arnd talented family which<br />
had contributed much to Australia's artistic<br />
achievements in many fields.<br />
Mr Whitlam also paid tribute to Mr Joseph<br />
Brown of Melbourne, who had acted for Mr Boyd in<br />
making the detailed arrangements which led to the<br />
gift being handed over to the Gallery.<br />
