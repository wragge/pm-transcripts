<p>As we come to celebrate Christmas with our own families, we think particularly of those families of the victims of the Bali atrocity that will celebrate their Christmas without their loved ones. And our thoughts and prayers are especially with them at what will be a difficult time. We look back on that terrible assault on humanity and as a nation we resolve to do all we can to ensure that those responsible are brought to justice. We also, feel for the families of people from other nations who died at the hands of that terrible act of terrorism. It's also an occasion to think of our struggling farmers, in many cases, grappling with the worst drought in more than a hundred years. And in different ways we can, as fellow Australians, give them assistance.</p>
<p>It's not, of course, been a year that will be happily remembered by many Australians, but it has been a year of very solid achievement in a number of areas. Our economy has continued to grow strongly and many tens of thousands of additional jobs have been generated. It's also been a year when tragedy has brought out the best in us and the way in which we have responded to Bali and helped our fellow Australians in so many different ways, shows that the Australian heart is good and strong and generous.</p>
<p>As we celebrate Christmas, we think of the men and women of the Australian Defence Force looking after our interests around the world and we thank them for that priceless gift of security that they give us. It is a time when the Christmas message encourages all of us to display good will towards our fellow Australians. Let us practice that in everything that we do. </p>
<p>Janette and I wish all of you a very happy Christmas. And as we celebrate Christmas, let us think of the incredible privilege we all have of being Australians and living in such a wonderfully free and stable and happy country. </p>
