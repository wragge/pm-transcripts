PRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT WEDNESDAY, 14 JULY 1982<br />
DOORSTOP, PARLIAMENT HOUSE HMS INVINCIBLE<br />
Question<br />
What are the options now that the Invincible purchase is not on?<br />
Prime Minister.<br />
I will have to have a talk with Ian Sinclair when he gets back.<br />
Question Are we likely to talk to the Americans about a replacement vessel--<br />
Prime Minister<br />
We will be seeking advice obviously from -the Department of<br />
Defence and defence advisers, and we will have to see what the<br />
options are.. It is not surprising that the British want to<br />
keep Invincible. They have then three of a class. Before the<br />
Falklands war they had only wanted to keep two of a class.<br />
They will now have three ships similar to Invincible,<br />
and I am not surprised at all. It really is a great misfortune<br />
for Australia's defence forces.<br />
Question Does the Government regret making the offer to the British<br />
Government? Prime Minister<br />
No. I think they would have wanted to keep the ship anyway.<br />
And in all the circumstances of the Falklands war, and<br />
having in mind the losses the British had suffered during that<br />
war, the only decent thing to do was not to hold them to any<br />
moral obligation. There wasn't any decent option, other than<br />
that. Question Yesterday's vote by the Left in supporting Mr Hayden. Did it<br />
surprise you at all?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Not at all. </p>
