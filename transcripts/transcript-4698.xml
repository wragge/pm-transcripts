EMBARGO: 7.00 p. m.<br />
FOR PRESS 30 APRIL 1978<br />
ELECTORATE TALK<br />
This week's announcement of an increase of only 1.3 percent irk<br />
the Consumer Price Index is more welcome economic news for Australia.<br />
It is certainly good news for business, housewives, farmers all<br />
sections of the community.<br />
This quarter's increase in the CPI indicates that we are in the<br />
best position for over five years to overcome the evil of inflation.<br />
The figure confirms that Australia's inflation rate is running at<br />
about 8 percent. This is a significant improvement.<br />
We are now down to about the levels of our overseas trading<br />
partners this can only benefit our export and manufacturing<br />
industries as it will improve their competitive position.<br />
Clearly, this figure again shows that our economic policies<br />
consistently applied from day one have been the right policies<br />
for Australia.<br />
Australia any country will always have economic problems.<br />
They are a fact of life in a changing world. we have shown that<br />
Australia now has a government able to competently tackle the<br />
problems and overcome them. We have shown that we will not run away<br />
from problems, and pretend they do not exist. We have spelt them<br />
out in plain language and set a firm course to overcome them.<br />
We have been following that course since late 1975 I think with<br />
some success.<br />
There is simply no realistic alternative. The business community<br />
for one has given us its support as it comes to recognise that<br />
there are no simple and speedy solutions to the fundamental<br />
imbalances with which our economy is still beset. We have never<br />
stopped preaching firm control of government spending, finely<br />
balanced monetary policies and wage restraint.<br />
of course, this 1.3 percent figure is not the end of the line in<br />
our fight against inflation. The Government is well aware that<br />
inflation must continue to fall before we can have full economic<br />
recovery, with job opportunities for all Australians who want to work.<br />
We have achieved notable success in our battle against inflation<br />
but much work remains to be done. </p>
<p>With our inflation rate down at less than half the peak of the<br />
Labor years, the financial and economic conditions are steadily<br />
improving for the return of investor confidence. The Government<br />
has stressed that a sustained fall in inflation is a pre-requisite<br />
for greater business investment by both Australian and overseas<br />
companies. It is encouraging to see this development taking place.<br />
The conditions are also steadily improving for young Australians<br />
seeking to buy and build their own homes. I know that the high<br />
monthly repayments have put homes out of the reach of many<br />
thousands of young couples. That has begun to change and as<br />
inflation keeps falling the conditicns will be established for a<br />
further reduction which will assist families everywhere.<br />
The Government will continue with its economic policies. We will<br />
not relax and not be side-trached. Any drift away from firm,<br />
responsible economic policies designed to reduce inflation and<br />
encourage investment and activity would seriously damage confidence<br />
both of business and consumers. That would set back economic<br />
recovery. The Government is determined to continue with its firm and responsible<br />
economic policies. We utterly reject any course that risks the<br />
hard won gains already made. </p>
