PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
FIRST MEETING OF THE NATIONAL INFORMATION SERVICES COUNCIL<br />
( NISC)<br />
Today I chaired the first meeting of the National Information Services Council.<br />
The Council was established in response to a recommendation in the final<br />
report of the Broadband Services Expert Group. It is a high-level discussion<br />
forum for broad policy issues associated with Australia's development as an<br />
' information society'.<br />
The Council's role is to inform the policy debate in government, by<br />
encouraging input from members of the community, industry, and other<br />
relevant experts in the field. It is an important source of non-government<br />
views on information and communications services and technologies.<br />
Today the Council focused on four important matters:<br />
access to the emerging information services and technologies;<br />
industry policy issues;<br />
the legal questions and challenges arising from the new technologies<br />
and services; and<br />
Australia's role in the international telecommunications environment.<br />
Independent working parties prepared papers on each of these topics for the<br />
Council's consideration.<br />
The paper on access issues argued that the right to communicate, and the<br />
right to access information, are fundamental to a democratic and equitable<br />
society. It identified a range of groups with particular access needs,<br />
including: rural and remote, indigenous and ethnic communities, older<br />
people, people on low incomes and the unemployed, women, and people with<br />
disabilities. </p>
<p>The report identifies a number of principles which the working group believe<br />
should be acted upon. A fundamental principle is that access should be<br />
non-discriminatory, so that all Australians can share in the benefits of the new<br />
services. A cooperative and coordinated approach between governments,<br />
industry and the community is also important.<br />
The report argues that access is not only an issue for the future, but is<br />
already a problem, and action is needed to provide access to narrowband<br />
data services, particularly to rural and remote communities.<br />
The paper on industry issues argues that Australia needs to establish a<br />
clear national vision for the information technology and communications<br />
industries, to provide a framework for cooperative activity within and between<br />
industry and governments.<br />
It considers that information industries have the potential to become one of<br />
Australia's major net earners in the coming century, and Australia must plan<br />
to become a leading provider of broadband interactive services.<br />
Market analysis and social research are also important, to assist in identifying<br />
and exploiting market opportunities. An adequate skills base is vital in<br />
achieving industry development goals. In addition, trials and demonstrations<br />
are a key means of developing technology, and accelerating its takeup by<br />
industry and the general community.<br />
The report on legal issues addresses a range of matters such as<br />
competition, consumer protection, privacy, security and intellectual property.<br />
One of its key messages is that existing laws affecting the development of<br />
information and communications services are in many respects adequate and<br />
do not need revolutionary changes. Nevertheless, some review and<br />
adjustment is required in laws concerning industry structure, electronic<br />
commerce and privacy. Moreover, laws relating to classification of material<br />
need to be extended to the new information environment, and priority should<br />
be given to implementing recommendations of the Copyright Law Review<br />
Committee.<br />
The international issues paper notes that the information services sector<br />
has become a critical part of the infrastructure of the global economy, to<br />
which Australian industry must have access.<br />
It argues that Australia must participate in the development of international<br />
trade rules that foster open national markets, and international competition in<br />
basic telecommunications services. Structural impediments within Australia<br />
must be addressed, and the government must take a proactive role in the<br />
development of standards and codes of practice. Australia's performance in<br />
telecommunications must be benchmarked against world best practice<br />
standards. </p>
<p>The issues and recommendations in the papers will be given close attention<br />
by the government, and where appropriate taken up by the Committee of<br />
Officials on Information Services.<br />
