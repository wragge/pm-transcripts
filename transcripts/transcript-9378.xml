    <content><![CDATA[<p>Much has been made of questions raised two months ago in the Hawke Memoirs concerning my commitment to Australia's involvement in the Gulf War.</p>
<p>I do not wish to prolong this I simply make the following points:</p>
<p>My considered support for Australia's involvement in the Gulf has been corroborated by a number of sources today. Namely, by the recollections of Senator Evans and Senator Ray, my speech to the House on 21 January 1991, a report by Mr Grigson of the Sydney Morning Herald at the time and an office note taken by a member of my personal staff.</p>
<p>That part of Mr Hawke's personal record which refers to " what has the US done for us" also appears in my office note but the person who said it was not me.</p>
<p>It is clear that my recollections of those events conflict with those of the former Prime Minister in some respects. This is regrettable but not a matter of earth shattering importance. The main thing was and is that Mr Hawke and I both supported Australian involvement in operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm.</p>
<p>Mr Downer has now climbed into this debate. If this helps in any way to preserve his leadership Mr Hawke and I should drop some other bon mots which might attract his attention.</p>
<p>Easing Mr Downer into the New Year is a high priority for me.</p>
<p>Mr Downer has had ample opportunity to question me on this matter over the past two months and has failed to do so except on a day when he knew I would not be in Question Time. Mr Downer to this date has still raised no matters of public importance.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the real news today is not the continuation of any minor hostilities between myself and Mr Hawke but the avoidance of major ones in the Gulf.</p>
