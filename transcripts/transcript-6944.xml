PRIME MINISTER<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF PRESS CONFERENCE, PARLIAMENT HOUSE 2 JUNE 1986<br />
me make a brief statement to the effect that it<br />
is quite clear in the light of the national accounts that have<br />
been available in this last week that the Australian economy has<br />
had inflicted upon it, as a result of a massive decline in the<br />
terms of trade, a reduction in its economic capacity to sustain<br />
standards. I have accepted, in those circumstances, this<br />
Government has accepted, that it was necessary for the Government<br />
to move to make those decisions to adopt modifications of<br />
approach necessary to meet the challenge confronting us, as an<br />
Australian community, as a result of the change of the terms of<br />
trade. We are proceeding to do that. In the discussions we have<br />
been having it has become also apparent now that to give the ACPI<br />
meeting the best chance of taking advantage of those consultative<br />
processes it would be better for it to meet in a framework where<br />
the decision of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission were<br />
known and where the decisions of the Government were also known.<br />
In those circumstances I didn't unilaterally inform the<br />
participants, but rather approached them and suggested this was<br />
the appropriate course of action and was pleased to say that it<br />
was the unanimous view of the representatives of business and the<br />
ACTU that that was the appropriate course. I will be making an<br />
Address to the Nation next week in which I will be outlining to<br />
the people of Australia the facts of the economic situation<br />
confronting us and the approach and the decisions of the<br />
Government which we regard as not only appropriate, but necessary<br />
to deal with these circumstances.<br />
JOURNALIST: At whose suggestion was the meeting postponed?<br />
PM: We discussed this last night at the ministers, meeting and<br />
it was agreed that this was the appropriate course of action. I<br />
raised the matter. It was agreed and I had the discussions this<br />
morning with the BCA, the CAI and the ACTU and as I say they were<br />
of the same view.<br />
GRATTAN: Had you had earlier representations from the ACTU?<br />
PM: No I had not had earlier representations from the ACTU.<br />
BARNETT: This means that the decision the Arbitration Commission<br />
makes will be on the basis of earlier submissions from the<br />
Government before the seriousness of this present situation was<br />
recognised? </p>
<p>PM: That's a fair comment David, but this point is relevant,<br />
given the normal time table of the Arbitration Commission is<br />
between the end of submissions and the making of decisions<br />
clearly the Government position as to what needs to be done would<br />
be known to the Commission as a result of my statement to the<br />
nation before they would be making their decision so they would<br />
have an appreciation of the Government's view of the situation<br />
out in front of them.<br />
EWART: When do you see the meeting being held now then?<br />
PM: I don't want to put an exact date upon it, but the<br />
determining points Heather are that it will be necessarily after<br />
the decision of the Commission. Now I don't know what date that<br />
will be but one would think that the decision will come down in<br />
the latter part of June. I would think you're looking at an ACPI<br />
meeting probably some time early July. I can't be more definite<br />
than that for those reasons.<br />
LOGUE: Prime minister, were there formal economic decisions<br />
taken last night or are we still facing a serious of options?<br />
PM: what we did last night was to have before us a number of<br />
proposals which are regarded as relevant to a total approach to<br />
this set of decisions we have to take. Some of the proposals<br />
were discarded. That was a minority of them. others need more<br />
work to be done. That is proceeding now and I will have a<br />
meeting of the Ministers as soon as that additional work is done.<br />
May I say that we will have bilateral discussions with the<br />
business community and the ACTU during this week. It is<br />
scheduled that we will meet with business community on Wednesday<br />
and withe the ACTU on Thursday, so I would hope that we would be<br />
in a position, without necessarily going into all the details, to<br />
be able to put some of our thinking to the business community and<br />
the ACTU this week.<br />
HYWOOD: In your Address to the Nation can a clear outline of the<br />
Government's position on discounting, deferral of tax cuts,<br />
superannuation............... PM: We will go to those matters.<br />
CASSIDY: Prime minister to what extent will your Address to the<br />
Nation set policy direction, economic policy directions and<br />
therefore to what extent will it pre-empt any input from the<br />
business community and the trade unions?<br />
PM: Well there are two points to make about which first what<br />
I've already said. We will have some bilateral discussions with<br />
the business community and the ACTU during this week. In terms<br />
of the approach that I've adopted since we came to Government, we<br />
will listen to what they have to say and discuss with them, and<br />
it may be our thinking could be influenced by things that are<br />
said by things that are said by the business community and the<br />
trade unions. But what I want the people of Australia to<br />
understand is that we do face a new economic situation and this<br />
Government is going to make the decisions. And we are going to<br />
do it the same way that we have in the past following the </p>
<p>process of consultation this Government will then make the<br />
decisions. I hope and expect that we may be able to be assisted<br />
as we do that. The second point that needs to be made is that if<br />
you take the wages and conditions of employment area that has<br />
been raised by Greg, in his previous question, in the end the<br />
actual decisions as to wages and conditions of employment are<br />
made by the Arbitration Commission. we will be indicating the<br />
sorts of things that we believe ought to happen. Now in the<br />
period between us making those clear statements and adopting thL<br />
position as to what we think ought to happen, there would be the<br />
opportunity of further discussions with the business community<br />
and the trade unions, in the period leading up to the next case.<br />
The Government will have a clear position and we would hope that<br />
both as a result of what we say and perhaps strengthened to some<br />
extent by the discussions that we have with both sides of<br />
industry, that we may be able to reach a position where there is<br />
a greater degree of understanding there, where the decisions have<br />
to be made.<br />
STEKET: E: Why didn't you realise originally that it would make<br />
more sense to have the ACPI meeting after the National Wage Case?<br />
PM: As you know I've said that I believe that both Paul and<br />
Ralph were perfectly correct in responding in the circumstances<br />
that arose. There was some expression of feeling, particularly<br />
from the business community, that they didn't have the same<br />
degree of involvement with the Government in economic<br />
decision-making as the ACTU and in that context a suggestion of a<br />
further meeting was made and my two ministers properly responded<br />
positively to that. But as the circumstances developed in this<br />
last week with more information becoming available and the<br />
realisation that there is a necessity in those circumstances to<br />
move fairly quickly to make decisions, that in those<br />
circumstances, combined with the desirability of having the<br />
National Wage Case decision available, not to abandon the meeting<br />
but to postpone it, so participants would have all that<br />
information before them, both the Government's decision and<br />
approach and the National Wage Case decision, made more sense.<br />
And I'm very pleased to say that I thought that would be the<br />
attitude of the participants it is.<br />
COSTIGAN: The States are the other arm of ACPI. Do you also<br />
plan to have bilateral talks with the Premiers this week and is<br />
your Address to the Nation, will that be before the Premiers'<br />
Confe rence?<br />
PM: It will be before the Premiers' Conference. Mr Willis, the<br />
Chairman of ACPI, will be communicating with States and the other<br />
participants to indicate this decision and I thought it<br />
appropriate that in the immediate sense I should talk to the<br />
EWART: Shouldn't Mr Willis and Mr Keating have realised at the<br />
time that it would make more sense?<br />
PM: No. You're not going to illicit from any criticism of Paul<br />
or Ralph. They reacted, as I've said from the beginning,<br />
correctly. The circumstances were that the business community </p>
<p>expressed this view and the minister said, sure if you want a<br />
further meeting with further opportunity to discuss this, well<br />
and good and we agree with that. Now as everyone agrees, we've<br />
had a fairly quick development of the situation with the<br />
emergence of the national accounts, there are many important<br />
features of those national accounts, none more important than the<br />
figuring by the statistician which showed that in the 12 months<br />
to the March quarter of 1986 the effect of the decline in the<br />
terms of trade is equivalent to about a 3 per cent loss on the<br />
national GDP. In those circumstances you've just got to move in<br />
relation to them and say all right, we are going to accelerate<br />
the processes of decision-making to get to a position of<br />
refinement of the strategy and that we are doing. The decision<br />
of Paul and Ralph was quite appropriate at the time.<br />
JOURNALIST: The States have been saying that if they are being<br />
called on to cutback in their expenditure the Commonwealth has<br />
got to show they will do the same. will your statement next week<br />
States at the Premier's Conference?<br />
PM: we'll be in a position by the time we meet with the Premiers<br />
to give a clear indication of the extent to which the Government<br />
has moved in its decision-making in regard to its own<br />
expenditures. We will not, in other words, be putting positions<br />
to them from a position of weakness with not already having moved<br />
significantly in our own area.<br />
SHORT: Does this mean you will set out in your statement a<br />
target for spending cuts and a deficit for next year?<br />
PM: I don't think I will in the statement itself, to the nation,<br />
go to that detail. Let me make this point, there will, as we are<br />
thinking about it now, in addition to my actual Address to the<br />
Nation there will probably be an associated more lengthy<br />
statement released which will go in greater details than is<br />
possible or appropriate in an Address to the Nation dealing with<br />
some of the issues there. But you will appreciate that as to the<br />
actual fine detail of budget formulation there is still more work<br />
to be done by us and in our discussion to with the States.<br />
JONES: Will your Address to the national also go to the question<br />
of industry policy and particularly to investment? You said<br />
earlier that you had discarded a couple of options. Are you able<br />
to say what they were?<br />
PM: I'm able to but I'm not going to. And the answer is yes, I<br />
will be going to the question of industry policy.<br />
BARNETT: And what about fringe benefits tax Prime minister. Is<br />
that one of the options you have discarded or might that be<br />
revised?<br />
PM: my decision is quite clear about that. It is another matter<br />
entirely, of course we are going ahead with that.<br />
OAKES: Prime Minister why are you thumbing your nose at the<br />
Parliament? You announcing this statement outside Parliament.<br />
You announced that you were going to make it on a radio program. </p>
<p>Why won't you do these things in Parliament?<br />
PM: I'm not thumbing my nose at the Parliament. I have the<br />
greatest respect for the institution of Parliament, if not for<br />
some of its inhabitants. We are engaging in a process now, in<br />
the light of the most recent information, of looking at a range<br />
of possible decisions which would be relevant to reaching the<br />
most appropriate position for government to, as I say, protect<br />
and advance the interests of the people of Australia. I'm not<br />
going to be rushed and the Government is not going to be rushed<br />
in reaching the best decision by some artificial constraint in<br />
the time table of the Parliament. The people of Australia will<br />
be told by me of the decision and the approach of the Government.<br />
We'll do that as soon as possible and that will follow both the<br />
work that needs to be done, and there's a lot of detailed work<br />
that needs to be done at the official level, and it will also<br />
follow the consultation that I will have with Paul, with Ralph<br />
and the other other Ministers in the Committee. We will meet<br />
with the business community and the trade unions. Now those<br />
processes of the work that we have to do to inform our mind of<br />
the right decision and the consultations we have have got to be<br />
allowed to have the time that is appropriate to them.<br />
OAKES: But Parliament is sitting next week isn't it?<br />
PM: I understood the Reps were rising this week.<br />
GRATTAN: Mr Hawke, wouldn't have made sense to ask the<br />
Arbitration Commission to reopen the wage case to argue this in<br />
detail rather than Secondly, what is left after<br />
all this for the ACPI meeting to discuss.<br />
PM: Well taking your first point, no we don't believe it would<br />
be appropriate to reopen the case. We've put our position in<br />
regard to the current proceedings in the light, as you will know,<br />
of the last three quarters of last year, what the CPI figures<br />
relate to. We've put our position on what we regard the amount<br />
of discounting is appropriate. The Commission, as I've said in<br />
answer to a previous question, will not be unaware of our<br />
thinking before it comes to a conclusion. I don't see any need<br />
for a reopening of the case. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: How can the Commission make a on something it<br />
will read in the newspapers Prime Minister?<br />
PM: Well, let me say this, I will do more than taking the risk,<br />
if I may say so without incurring any general wrath, I will do<br />
more than taking the risk that they will have to rely on a<br />
newspaper interpretation of what I say. Both the statement I make<br />
to the nation and the more detailed report that will be<br />
associated with it will be sent to the Commission and to the<br />
parties. JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, to take up Michelle's point though,<br />
that by some date in July the Government processes have<br />
been gone through, the ACPI meeting will be meaningless?<br />
PM: No, that is obviously not true, with respect. We will make<br />
our decisions as a Government but in terms of well, for instance,<br />
you take the area of wages and conditions, we will be making our<br />
position clear. But I repeat the Government doesn't make the<br />
decisions as to wages outcome. That is something that is decided<br />
in the Arbitration Commission. So in that area there will be<br />
still room for some discussion between Government and the parties<br />
in the light of an indication of the Government's position. In<br />
the area of let's take industry policy which is also raised. We<br />
will be giving some indications of decisions we are taking in<br />
that area. Now the actual implementation of those decisions for<br />
their full effectiveness will depend upon on the attitudes of<br />
both employers and the trade unions. And far from them not having<br />
anything to discuss in the industry policy area for instance,<br />
they will be in a much better position to make those discussions<br />
meaningful if they have specific proposals before them and they<br />
can say well, look in terms of giving effect to that we think<br />
this would be useful, that would be useful.<br />
JOURNALIST: Can you foresee a need for a second Address to the<br />
Nation after the ACPI meeting if the ACPI is still important?<br />
PM: No.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, how will the Government afford an<br />
investment program without blowing out its August Budget<br />
PM: Well, let me say this, we clearly in looking at the<br />
investment area Greg, two things seem to me to be appropriate in<br />
answer to your question. Firstly, we will not be embarking upon<br />
some program which is going to involve a massive demand upon the<br />
Budget resources. Secondly, you would appreciate that in regard<br />
to investment decisions anything that we do would be unlikely to<br />
have a major effect in 86-87 because there is a time-lag to some<br />
extent in investments as we would hope that it would have some<br />
impact. But it is the sort of thing that would be spread by<br />
nature over a longer period than just one year.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, following up David Barnett's question on<br />
fringe benefits tax, will impact very heavily on the<br />
exports PM: Will it? </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Yes, it will.<br />
PM: Well how?<br />
JOURNALIST: Well how the economists tell me that<br />
PM: which economist told you how it would impact heavily on the<br />
export sector?<br />
JOURNALIST: Well, from the National Farmers Federation.<br />
PM: Oh, I see, yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: And exports are pretty important part of<br />
PM: They are indeed and to a large extent what it is all about.<br />
JOURNALIST: So this won't be part of the consideration.<br />
PM: No, we have dealt with the question of fringe benefits tax.<br />
I will make the obvious point that Paul has made so eloquently<br />
and consistently that you can't just talk about the fringe<br />
benefits tax as though that is the only thing we have done. It is<br />
part of a package, it is part of an effective package which will<br />
for instance include a very significant reduction in personal tax<br />
rates. It will involve as far as company areas are concerned the<br />
benefits of imputation that has been sought for some time by the<br />
business sector. It is an exercise in stupidity if I may put it<br />
as kindly as I am capable of doing. It is an exercise in<br />
stupidity to talk about the fringe benefits tax in isolation.<br />
JOURNALIST: It is a transfer of a billion dollars from investors<br />
to consumers isn't it, Prime Minister?<br />
PM: I don't interpret it that way. What I do is to say that we<br />
have had imposed upon this country as a result of what is really<br />
something like 34 years out of a total 37 years since 1949 a tax<br />
structure, tariff structure which is the result of a mish-mash of<br />
unprincipled ad hocery of the conservative forces of this<br />
country. The Labor Government my Government has approached this<br />
with courage and with principle and has said we have got to get a<br />
more sensible tax system. We have reached a position which is<br />
endorsed, I believe, by the overwhelming majority of the people<br />
of Australia that they are not going to any longer tolerate a<br />
situation whereby an artificial management of remuneration a<br />
small sector of Australian people are allowed to be remunerated<br />
in a way which avoids them making a fair and appropriate<br />
contribution to the revenue. Now the people of Australia by clear<br />
majority approve of that change. We are not going to be diverted<br />
from rectifying not only an anomaly but something which is<br />
unsustainable in equity terms. We are not going to be diverted<br />
from our intention to rectify that by the understandable<br />
complaints of particular interest groups. I don't complain about<br />
them putting a case but this Government is going to hear and<br />
balance their propositions in the light of the generality of our<br />
approach which is correct. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: In terms of promoting business investment do you see<br />
the recent heavy engineering tactics as a blueprint in that area<br />
and also do you see any scope for increased protection in imports<br />
as a way of one, promoting business investments and two<br />
PM: two parts of your question first. I don't see it<br />
necessarily as a blueprint. It is something that we will take<br />
into account but I think different industries may require<br />
different approaches but it is something we will take into<br />
account. B, the position of this Government is as you know not<br />
one of being an increased protectionist Government. I and the<br />
Government have said since we have been in that the realities of<br />
the international environment of which we are part require us<br />
gradually through time to reduce the level of protection. But I<br />
say that in the context that all times that we have said that, we<br />
have said that it is appropriate that the community take into<br />
account the impact of such changes to reduce protection upon<br />
those who area at the face of the impact of protection. In other<br />
words as I have said many times before I came into this place and<br />
since I have been in here, it is something that should be in the<br />
minds of everyone. If it is in the interests of the community<br />
gradually to have reduced protection then logic and equity<br />
demands that the community should help those who are at the face<br />
of the impact of that change to meet the burden of it.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is the Government looking for a further delay in the<br />
productivity increase and might you consider excluding the<br />
PM: I am not going to go into the details here of what my<br />
ministers and I will be considering this week and what I put to<br />
the people next week.<br />
JOURNALIST: I was just going to ask you what sort of investment<br />
incentives does the Government have in mind?<br />
PM: Well the same answer there Greg. I am not going into the<br />
details and really we had some initial briefing papers put before<br />
us last night. We are looking for more work to be done.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, you talk about community attitudes and<br />
community interests, to what extent can the Government persuade<br />
the relevant interest groups and to what extent does it have to?<br />
PM: Well, I can't answer the first question because that is a<br />
matter for the future. It will depend in part upon I suppose, and<br />
not in this order of importance necessarily, my eloquence, the<br />
understanding of opinion makers and so on. There is a range of<br />
facts which will determine how the community can be persuaded of<br />
the realities of the new situation confronting them. I believe<br />
and if you want an opinion, and that is all it can be, I say this<br />
that my experience as Prime Minister has been that if you talk to<br />
the people directly and frankly about the facts, they respond.<br />
That is the experience I have had to this point. I have no reason<br />
to believe that they are going to change now. And to the second<br />
part of your question, it is necessary that they do understand.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, will you chair the postponed,<br />
extended meeting of the ACPI and how now do you characterise that </p>
<p>meeting as to its significance?<br />
PM: Well, I wouldn't think I would chair it and I think it will<br />
be another important meeting. I mean it is going to occur in the<br />
context of the Government statement of new policy positions which<br />
will be directed towards adjusting to the new circumstances. It<br />
will be useful for the ACPI participants to meet in that context<br />
and in the context of what, Peter, will be an important national<br />
wage case decision. So I think the circumstances within which<br />
they will meet of those two new factors give it a considerable<br />
importance.<br />
JOURNALIST: will you be putting firm Government preferences in<br />
terms of options to these next bilateral meetings later in the<br />
week? PM: We will be making our position fairly clear as to the basic<br />
directions in which we believe changes have to be made.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime minister, you said the postponed ACPI meeting<br />
would be held early in July..<br />
PM: Well, I think that is right. Let me make it clear we are not<br />
trying to impose a date. What we are doing is to create the<br />
context in which the participants can make the decision as to<br />
when they want to have it. I merely indicated that I thought that<br />
that would be the outcome. If you get a wages decision in the<br />
latter part of June I would have thought they would probably want<br />
to meet sometime relatively early in July.<br />
JOURNALIST: I was just wondering though in terms of the ALP<br />
National Conference, an ACPI meeting at that time might create<br />
difficulties. PM: You can see just how single-mindedly I am concentrating on<br />
matters economic. I can honestly tell you that the thought of the<br />
correlation between when it met and the ALP Federal Conference<br />
had not entered my mind.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, would you be organising a meeting between<br />
Mr Keating and your minders so they can sort out their<br />
differences? PM: I have said all I need to say about that subject.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, following up from my earlier<br />
question, if this matter is important which presumably you think<br />
it is and if you don't want to thumb your nose at the Parliament,<br />
what is the problem about bringing the Reps back next week? I<br />
PM: I don't think it would be necessary to do that. The members<br />
of the Representatives no doubt have made their plans to which<br />
they attach considerable importance. The people of Australia will<br />
be told directly as to what we are doing.<br />
JOURNALIST: Should the opposition be given equal time<br />
PM: That is a matter as you know historically for those in the </p>
<p>media to make their decisions about that.<br />
JOURNALIST: That suggests, sir, that you don't think Parliament<br />
is very important.<br />
PM: No, it doesn't suggest that at all. There is no logic in<br />
that imputation at all.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, do you see the question of<br />
accelerated depreciation or further accelerated depreciation<br />
playing a<br />
PM: I am not going into the details. I have said before that we<br />
have a number of papers before on which more work has been done.<br />
It would not be fair or appropriate to go to the details of that<br />
at this stage.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, just before you go, about South<br />
Africa, what is your position there, the state of play, have you<br />
spoken to Mr Fraser?<br />
PM: Yes I have.<br />
JOURNALIST: And can you report to us what the discussion was<br />
about PM: I won't go into details but I did have a talk with Mr Fraser<br />
last week. He brought me up-to-date. He is off to London I think<br />
today, certainly at the beginning of this week, for a further<br />
meeting of the Eminent Persons Group and they will be considering<br />
a reply which has been received from the Government of South<br />
Africa and will then be, as I understand, finalising their report<br />
for us to consider. I would simply make the point that I shared<br />
views with Mr Fraser on the implications of the most recent<br />
developments, thanked him for the work that he has been doing<br />
which I say unequivocally I think his co-chairmanship has been<br />
outstanding. I hope that there will still be some chance of<br />
processes of dialogue, meaningful dialogue emerging out of the<br />
initiative. But one would have to say obviously that recent and<br />
may I say continuing events in South Africa significantly reduce<br />
ones optimism in that regard.<br />
JOURNALIST: Sir, has Cabinet yet made decisions on the Australia<br />
Card and phone tapping?<br />
PM: No. When I left the Cabinet to come and share my thoughts<br />
with you my colleagues were then at the point of considering the<br />
Australia Card submission and it might not be a bad idea if I got<br />
back and joined them.<br />
