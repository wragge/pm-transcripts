FOR MEDIA 11 FEBRUARY 1989<br />
RELEASE or NELSON MANDELA<br />
The imminent release of Nelson Mandela gives me deep<br />
personal pleasure and will be welcomed whole-heartedly<br />
by all Australians.* I join in spirit with<br />
Winnie Mandela and the rest Of Nelson Mandela's family<br />
and friends as they cel~ ebrate this joyous occasion,<br />
postponed for so long. I was honoured to accept<br />
recently an invitation by Archbishop Trevor Huddleston<br />
to join with other international leaders in a<br />
Nelson Manidela Reception Committee, aimed at underlining<br />
the international community's commitment to ensuring<br />
that the opportunities presented by Nelson Mandela's<br />
release are niot wasted.<br />
Following on the heels of the reforms announced by State<br />
President de Klerk In his parliamentary address of<br />
2 February, Mandela's release is the most positive sign<br />
the world has yet seen that the walls of the abhorrent<br />
apartheid system may soon be breached.<br />
The opportunity is now at last there for constructive<br />
negotiations to begin between the South African<br />
Government and representatives of the black population.<br />
The goodwill provided by the release of Mandela anld the<br />
South Af rican Government's unbanning of the ANC and<br />
other anti-apartheid organisations provides the basis<br />
for negotiations which clearly would otherwise have been<br />
absent. That goodwill must now urgently be built upon, with the<br />
aim of seeing the black majority of South Africa receive<br />
the political rights which will enable them to<br />
participate at last as equal citizens In a democratic<br />
and non-racial South Africa. Australia will do whatever<br />
it can to assist in this process.<br />
I congratulate the South African Government for the<br />
wisdom it has shown by making the first steps towards<br />
remedying past and continuing injustices. I urge<br />
State President do Klerk to continue the process with<br />
the release of other political prisoners and the lifting<br />
of the State of Emergency. </p>
