PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCE, SOUTH MELBOURNE<br />
MAY 1989<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you saddened by the news of the killing of<br />
the Kanak leader?<br />
PM: I'm very saddened by it. Of course I've met the late<br />
Mr Tjibaou and I express to his family and the family of the<br />
other assassinated leader my personal sorrow and that of the<br />
Government and the people of Australia. It's particularly<br />
unfortunate coming as it does at a time when in a sense they<br />
were celebrating the achievement of the Matignon Agreement<br />
which laid the foundations for the bringing of a peaceful<br />
resolution of the dispute in New Caledonia. I trust that<br />
the assassination of Mr Tjibaou will not lead to further<br />
violence and we certainly express that hope and the<br />
commitment of the'Australian Government to support the<br />
processes that have been initiated under the Rochard<br />
Government to bring about a peaceful resolution of what had<br />
promised to be a devastatingly disastrous situation with the<br />
prospect of condiserable bloodshed. The Matignon Accord<br />
pointed the way to a peaceful resolution of the troubles in<br />
New Caledonia and I trust that this tragedy will not divert<br />
all parties from proceeding along those paths.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime minister, it's been reported this morning<br />
that a group of 30 Federal MPs are drafing a piece of<br />
legislation to prevent Medicare claims for abortion. Are<br />
you aware of that?<br />
PM: No, I haven't been aware of that. I noticed in the<br />
brief opportunity I've had to read the Press this morning, I<br />
noticed some reference to it. There's no recommendations or<br />
approach out of that group that I'm aware........ the<br />
Government. I don't regard it as particularly rewarding<br />
therefore, there's nothing before us and just to comment on<br />
-some Press speculatiom-bout-what someone may do in the<br />
future doesn't seem to me to be very rewarding.<br />
JOURNALIST: But what is your feeling on that?<br />
PM: I don't have feelings about Press reports. If I had<br />
feelings about Press reports I'd be in an asylum myself.<br />
For the moment I don't intend to get into an asylum on the<br />
basis of having feelings about every Press report I see. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
JOURNALIST: I take it it would be a conscious vote issue<br />
though if it ever got to legislation?<br />
PM: The position of my Party has been that way in the past,<br />
I don't see any reason why that would change. I mean it's<br />
just so speculative I don't see any reward to anyone in<br />
commenting at this stage on it.<br />
JOURNALIST: You're off to Tasmania tomorrow.<br />
PM: No, I'm off tonight.<br />
JOURNALIST: What's the future of Wesley Vale now?<br />
PM: There is no future for the particular project that was<br />
put up because this Government which has probably the<br />
strongest environmental credentials of just about any<br />
government in the world, and certainly the strongest of any<br />
in this country's history, is not going to permit an<br />
operation which allows the pumping into the ocean each day<br />
of 13 tonnes of these chlorides. So there's no future fcr<br />
that project in that form. It was environmentally untenable<br />
and unacceptable. I'll go down there, as I say, late<br />
tonight so I'll be having some things to say tomorrow. I<br />
really think we ought to leave it till tomorrow.<br />
JOURNALIST: How realistic is the idea of a coalition<br />
between the ALP and the so called Greens in Tasmania?<br />
PM: We will be running in this campaign to win in our own<br />
right as no doubt will be our major opponents, the Liberal<br />
Party. I believe that Mr Field's Party have a good chance<br />
of winning. Having said that if it were to emerge that<br />
there was a hung Parliament with the Greens holding the<br />
balance of power, well that's something that would have to<br />
be looked at then. It was quite clear that obviously in<br />
terms of the outstanding record of Labor on environmental<br />
issues as compared with the environmental vandalism of the<br />
Libers in general, and Mr Gray in particular, there should<br />
be no doubt as to which way that coalition would work out.<br />
JOURNALIST: what did you think about the Liberal Party<br />
reopening Senate preselection?<br />
PM: Haven't we seen a saga of comedies or stupidities in<br />
this area? I mean, t .4deader-of the Liberal Party<br />
federally, Mr Howard, distancing himself, then drawing out<br />
of a hat who was going to represent him at the preselection<br />
panel which must be one of the most pathetic abdications of<br />
leadership that I've ever seen. Now the third chapter in<br />
this comedy of errors is that having opened up the can of<br />
worms and seeing that Mr Macphee might be dumped which is<br />
what they want to do because they reject him hard right of<br />
the Liberal Party led by Mr Howard will not accept any small </p>
<p>-3-<br />
PM ( cont): Liberal philosophy as represented by Mr<br />
Macphee. Having committed themselves to getting rid of him,<br />
there is now a backlash in certain areas so they say ' oh,<br />
now what do we do? We've plotted to get rid of him, we're<br />
going to dump him out of the House of Representatives, bit<br />
of a backlash, so we'll change our previous decision and<br />
reopen nominations for the Senate and we can say to Ian<br />
" Ian, having kicked you thunderously in the backside, having<br />
told the people of Australia particularly the people of<br />
Goldstein that you're not a worthy representative to try<br />
and cover our own backsides having kicked yours, we'll now<br />
reopen nominations for the Senate". I mean, what a comedy<br />
of errors. I mean, what a mob of incompetents. They make<br />
such a massive mess of conducting their own affairs and they<br />
seriously say to the people of Australia ' look how we muck<br />
up our own affairs, please let us manage yours'. What a<br />
joke.<br />
JOURNALIST: With those problems do you have any temptation<br />
to call an early election?<br />
PM: No, no, no. I'm a man beyond temptation these days.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, are you concerned that while<br />
you're down here today talking about the advantages of the<br />
LaTrobe Valley region there's a lot of concern down there<br />
about the building of an outfall sewage unit into the ocean<br />
and people down there are saying it threatens to become<br />
another Wesley Vale because of the lack of adequate<br />
environmental controls?<br />
PM: I'm not acquainted with the details of that issue.<br />
They haven't been brought to my attention, perhaps they will<br />
and if I become acquainted with the details I may be in a<br />
position to say something about it. But I don't make a<br />
habit of talking about things that I don't know anything<br />
0 about. It's a very good rule for politicians and people in<br />
the media and all other areas of public affairs.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher<br />
celebrated her tenth anniversary yesterday.<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: Anything in line like that for you perhaps?<br />
PM: Well, we've had-as* x.-we.' vze had six. well, we've got<br />
another election coming up, you know, sometime in the next<br />
twelve months, within the next twelve months, that could<br />
make seven, seven from ten is three. Oh yes, it could<br />
happen. JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke Channel Ten sport would like to know<br />
your football tips for tomorrow. St Kilda or the Swans?<br />
PM: And you, of course, are speaking to Melbourne's leading<br />
tipster, leading by a very considerable margin in the<br />
Melbourne Herald tipster's poll.<br />
ends </p>
