    <content><![CDATA[<p>Subjects: Wheat sales to Iraq.</p>
<p>E&amp;OE...........  </p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Firstly Prime Minister some welcome news from Bagdad in regards to Australian wheat shipments.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes it is good news, I congratulate the wheat board, it';s a good outcome for the Australian wheat industry and a lot of credit is due to them. It obviously did turn out to be a quality issue, I';m glad its been resolved. The wheat trade is important to this country and I know that wheat growers around Australia will be very pleased at this news.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What has the Australian Government learnt about Iraq during this whole episode with regards to these wheat shipments?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think it';s probably better if we don';t try and put what';s happened in relation to wheat in any kind of political context.  It';s always a good idea to focus on the commercial and trade aspects of these things and I don';t seek to draw any particular political message out of this, for anybody, for myself or for members of the Labor Party.  It';s just very good that the shipment that was held up for apparent quality reasons, that that issue has been resolved and I don';t think it helps anybody, let alone the wheat industry, to try and overdraw political implications.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Obviously the wheat board sees political implications in that they';ve asked the Federal Government to tone down their language as far as Iraq goes.  You won';t be taking that advice on board?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I';m not seeking to put this outcome, which is very welcome, I';m not seeking to put it into any kind of political context.  I just welcome it on behalf of the Government, the wheat industry is important to this country and the wheat board';s done a very good job.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Is it a (inaudible) wheat supplies have been secured, is it a concern that future wheat supplies could be under threat if there';s still this environmentâ¦</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don';t think it';s a good idea when you';re dealing with these things to start talking in the broad.  We';ve had a good outcome, that';s good for the industry and it';s good for the capacity of the wheat board to handle these things with sensitivity.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>And so as far as the way Australia operates itself diplomatically and politically with regards to Iraq, it won';t be affected by this whole ordeal?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I';m not seeking to put this in a political context.</p>
