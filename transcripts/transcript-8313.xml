P R! MIE M! IN ISTE R<br />
FOR MEDIA 4 JULY 1991<br />
International agreement has now been reached to prohibit<br />
mining in Antarctica. The last differences over the text of<br />
the Environment Protocol to the Antarctic Treaty have been<br />
resolved and the Protocol can now be signed in the near<br />
future.<br />
The final step has been agreement by the United States<br />
announced by, President Bush this morning to a compromise<br />
proposal on the outstanding issue of the circumstances under<br />
which a party could withdraw from the Protocol. I welcome<br />
the United States' decision and the agreement which it has<br />
now made possible.<br />
The Protocol is the result of an initiative launched by<br />
Australia and France in mid-198g to have the Antarctic<br />
Minerals Convention set aside in favour of a new agreement<br />
prohibiting mining in Antarctica and providing for more<br />
comprehensive environmental protection for that region.<br />
When the United States had indicated in Madrid that it was<br />
not in a position to agree to a text proposed at that<br />
session, I wrote to President Bush urging United States<br />
concurrence. The Protocol will establish a comprehensive environmental<br />
protection regime for Antarctica. Antarctica will become a<br />
" 1natural reserve devoted to peace and science" where mining<br />
is prohibited.<br />
Stringent provisions would apply to any modification of the<br />
Protocol, including the lifting of the prohibition. A<br />
proposal to lift the mining prohibition could only be<br />
considered at a Review Conference after the Protocol has<br />
been in force for 50 years.<br />
Any party wishing to mine after 50 years could only do so if<br />
a majority of all Antarctic Treaty parties, including<br />
three-quarters of the current 26 Antarctic Treaty<br />
Consultative parties, indicated that they wanted the<br />
prohibition lifted. Moreover, even if such agreement was<br />
reached, a number of other stages would have to be gone<br />
through before any mining could begin.<br />
It is a great result, when it is considered that Australia,<br />
with France, started very much out on a limb when we called<br />
for a prohibition on mining.<br />
I am very proud that Australia remained steadfast on this<br />
most important issue. </p>
