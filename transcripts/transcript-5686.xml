PRIME MINISTER<br />
INQUIRY INTO ELECTRICITY GENERATION AND THE<br />
SHARING OF POWER RESOURCES IN SOUTH-EAST<br />
AUSTRALIA<br />
The Prime Minister announced today that h. e had received the<br />
Report of the joint Commonwealth/ State Committee of Inquiry<br />
into Electricity Generation and the Sharing of Power Resouroes<br />
in South-East'Australia. The Premiers of the ' participating<br />
States of New South Wales, South Australia, Tasmania and<br />
Victoria have agreed that the Report be made publicly available<br />
in viev) of the interest shown within both the electricity supply<br />
industry and the general community.<br />
The Committee of Inquiry was established in April 1980 under<br />
the chairmanship of Sir David Zeidler and comprised<br />
representatives of the Commonwealth and each of the<br />
participating States. The Inquiry's main function was to<br />
examine the feasibility of a strongly integrated electricity<br />
supply grid in South-East Australia and the requirement,<br />
location and type of new power stations to suppJly such an<br />
inter-connected system.<br />
While the Committee reports that there is no financial<br />
justification for the establishment of a strongly integrated<br />
grid in the 1980s, it recommends development of an appropriate<br />
basis for the establishment of a limited extension of the<br />
existing New South Wales/ Victoria interconnected system to<br />
South Australia. The Committee considers that the feasibility<br />
of a strongly integrated grid should continue to be reviewed.<br />
The Prime Minister said that the Governments concerned would<br />
be reviewing the report and recommendations and considering<br />
the scope for action.<br />
The Prime Minister expressed his appreciation of the work<br />
of Sir D~ avid Zeidler and the Committee in" undertaking a<br />
difficult and exacting task. The Inquiry represented an<br />
important example of Commonw,. ealth/ State co-operation and had<br />
been greatly assisted by the considerable support provided<br />
by each participant's electricity authority.<br />
