<p>Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payments (AGDRP) have been extended to people severely affected by flooding in the local government areas of Rockhampton and Somerset in Queensland and Clarence Valley in New South Wales.</p>
<p>This is a difficult time for people affected by these floods, which have had a devastating impact on a number of communities. With the people of Rockhampton, Somerset and Clarence Valley now looking towards recovery, eligible residents can claim disaster recovery payments of $1,000 for each adult and $400 for each child. </p>
<p>The easiest way to lodge a claim for the AGDRP is online at <a href="http://www.humanservices.gov.au/disasteror">www.humanservices.gov.au/disasteror</a> by calling the Australian Government Information Line on 180 22 66 from 8am to 8pm local time, seven days a week.  Completed claim forms can also be lodged in person at a Commonwealth Department of Human Services service centre. </p>
<p>These payments will assist individuals and families to get back on their feet as they begin to recover. The AGDRP is already being provided to individuals who have been severely impacted by flooding in the local government areas of Bundaberg, Fraser Coast, Gladstone, Gympie, Lockyer Valley and North Burnett. Further information on AGDRP and other Australian Government Assistance is available online at <a href="http://www.disasterassist.gov.au">www.disasterassist.gov.au</a>.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth Government's Disaster Income Recovery Subsidy is also available to individuals that have suffered a loss of income as a direct result of ex-Tropical Cyclone Oswald and associated flooding in the Queensland local government areas of Bundaberg, Gympie, Fraser Coast, North Burnett, and Lockyer Valley.  The subsidy provides fortnightly payments for 13 weeks equivalent to the maximum rate of Newstart Allowance and can be claimed through Centrelink.</p>
<p>This Australian Government assistance is over and above the support already being provided under the Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements (NDRRA), which are jointly funded by the Australian Government and the states. </p>
