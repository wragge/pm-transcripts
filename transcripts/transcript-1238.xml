nation growing in stature and influence as it strides steadily<br />
forward, W: e live our lives in a climate of freedom, secured<br />
by laws of our own making.. For us there are the excitements<br />
and challenges of growth, the responsibilities of keeping our<br />
nation secure and of giving out to others as our expanding<br />
economy enables. Here is a country to be greatly enjoyed with all<br />
its unique beauty and infinite variety. Here is a country to<br />
be lovedto be served with devotion. May we all feel it in<br />
our hearts to strive the harder to make this Australia of ours<br />
a country of even more splendid tomorrows.<br />
