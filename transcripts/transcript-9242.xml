TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH SARAH HENDERSON, 3AW, MELBOURNE<br />
FRIDAY 27 MAY, 1994<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
SH. Mr Keating, could I start by asking you about Bronwyn Bishop, she's<br />
made some comments this morning about tobacco sponsorship and<br />
about the fact that perhaps there needs to be a case made out that<br />
tobacco is a dreadful product. What are your views about this?<br />
PM: Well, this is a debate which was won 20 years ago. And, this is the<br />
point I've been making all week about the supposedly new-look Liberal<br />
Party this is the old-look Liberal Party with all these old-look views.<br />
And, Mr Downer's given this important job in social policy, health, to<br />
Bronwyn Bishop and her first utterance is that she supports advertising<br />
of cigarette products knowing that the target of the advertising is<br />
essentially young men and women who the cigarette companies want<br />
to recruit to their ranks. And, the linkages between cigarette smoking<br />
and cancer and other deleterious effects are so obvious that beating<br />
that kind of a drum when the debate was over so long ago, I think,<br />
means that Mr Downer has made a mistake in giving her the job.<br />
SH: She's been in the job for less than one day, should she go?<br />
PM: I think she ought to go, yes. What point of credibility is there for<br />
somebody who is an experienced political person saying, in a key job<br />
like responsibility for health in a Shadow Cabinet, debating, whether or<br />
not tobacco is deleterious to people's health. And, arguing that<br />
because it's sold legally they ought to be able to advertise it. It's<br />
outrageous. It's just, simply, outrageous and I just think Mr Downer<br />
should say, " Look, Bronwyn, I'm sorry about this but you just, simply,<br />
ought to have more sense and if you haven't got that much sense,<br />
goodbye, I don't need you." </p>
<p>SH: Mr Keating, could I raise the issue of business investment with you.<br />
There are obviously fairly alarming figures for the government, the<br />
whole premise of the Budget is based on the estimate that there'll be a<br />
14.5 per cent increase in business investment, we've just heard that<br />
it's now down by five per cent. Were your predictions about a<br />
turnaround in jobs and also of four and a half per cent growth now<br />
have to be revised?<br />
PM: No, we think they, these are quarterly numbers and they dance around<br />
all the time, but even this number is on track, as the Treasurer said<br />
yesterday, with the Budget forecast of 14.5 per cent. The 14.5 per<br />
cent for this stage of the economic cycle was reasonably down beat on<br />
the Government's part. You saw last week we published the profit<br />
numbers for the quarter, it's the highest share of national income going<br />
to profits in our history. You've got low interest rates, a very good<br />
labour market...<br />
SH: The problem with low interest rates, of course, is that Bernie Fraser<br />
has predicted they will increase, now if they increase surely that's<br />
going to be a bigger deterrent for business not to invest and make it<br />
more difficult to get that 14.5 per cent business investment.<br />
PM: The profits are so big, everything is propitious now for a reasonably<br />
strong surge in investment and we're seeing it basically come through<br />
in employment. We've already had 243,000 jobs, from memory,<br />
243,000 in the last 12 months so the economy is set up I've never<br />
seen a better conjunction, in the 25 years I've been in public life I've<br />
never seen a better conjunction of economic data with inflation, with<br />
growth, the profit figures, of course the growth in exports, it's all there<br />
happening right now.<br />
SH: Is it true though that if you don't get this 14.5 per cent in business<br />
investment that you're not going to get the growth and you're not going<br />
to get the turnaround in jobs, certainly not 2,000,000 jobs by the end of<br />
the century.<br />
PM: It's not all based on business investment, there's housing, there's still a<br />
strong contribution from private consumption, business investment is<br />
just a part of the growth forecast for the year. But, as I say, we've got<br />
realisation factors in there on the investment expectations data way<br />
below the 1 980s outcomes. Let me just go through this point again<br />
we get expectations data from the statistician who polls business and<br />
talks to business and he publishes those. Governments generally then<br />
pick a realisation rate in making their forecasts, that is how much of the<br />
expectation will actually happen. We've got the realisation rate in the<br />
Budget way below what actually happened in the eighties. </p>
<p>SH: Could I perhaps just point you to the Budget papers because in fact,<br />
Treasury does say that the central feature of the economic outlook is<br />
the substantial pick up in business investment...<br />
PM: That's right...<br />
SH: And that's very much predicated on your whole prediction, isn't it?<br />
PM: I know, but I don't think you look at one quarter's numbers and say,<br />
" Well, that's all wrong." I mean, that's the point you're trying to make<br />
to me and I'm rebutting the point.<br />
SH: So, you're confident that that's going to turn around?<br />
PM: Well, look if you don't get a surge of investment out of a profit share<br />
this high, a dollar this competitive, a labour market this competitive, a<br />
productivity culture like we've never had before you'd just have to put<br />
your glasses down and say, " When would we ever get wouldn't<br />
you? If the profit share is at records beyond any historical experience,<br />
and it is, how high need it go, therefore before we get business<br />
investment? If people are arguing we won't get business investment<br />
now, what, therefore, is the solution? Of course we're going to get it.<br />
SH: Mr Keating, how concerned are you about criticism of the Industrial<br />
Relations Act given that there has been a major backlash by<br />
employers particularly over unfair dismissal provisions? And, also,<br />
Laurie Brereton has conceded that a review of the Act will be required<br />
within the next six months.<br />
PM: Well, I think that what the Government has done here is what needed<br />
to be done 20 years ago in Australia. Can I just say a couple of things<br />
about the current political environment and the labour market because<br />
these points are worth making; Malcolm Fraser is out there this week<br />
as happy as a sand boy, he's got his person up as leader of the Liberal<br />
Party, Mr Downer. He's now arguing, writing articles, going on radio<br />
and television, arguing the kind of case that a kind of country, kind of<br />
policies that Malcolm Fraser always believed in. His government was<br />
an absolute blancmange of a government that stood for nothing and<br />
reformed nothing, including the labour market.<br />
This government has had the difficult job of taking a rigid, centralised<br />
wage fixation system and decentralising it. And, we've done that by<br />
moving away from centralised wage fixing and seeing within-sector<br />
flexibility introduced. This has come in two ways: full enterprise<br />
bargaining for a grass roots investment say, like an industrial<br />
agreement like the Federal Hotels or Toyota where there is a new<br />
plant or a new industry is making a cross industry arrangement<br />
there is a new agreement between the employees and the employer<br />
about improving productivity and splitting that productivity between </p>
<p>profits and wages. In the reforms introduced last year we've also<br />
introduced within-award flexibility, that is, the people covered by<br />
federal awards, now, an employer without reference to a union can sit<br />
down and negotiate with their employees and cut a new arrangement<br />
to improve the productivity of the business. Now, these are vast<br />
changes and if you look at the states, some of them are beating the<br />
drum about labour market changes like the Kennett government or<br />
the Fahey government in NSW the federal government has a<br />
massive number of industrial agreements now done, Enterprise<br />
bargains under federal awards, the states have got nearly nothing. So,<br />
we're the ones at the cutting edge of this change and you've got<br />
people like Mr Howard and others coming out arguing a case against<br />
us when their party, in government in Victoria and NSW can't even<br />
start in this area can't even get a foothold.<br />
SH: I know on this program I've actually had people calling in, saying,<br />
" Look, I would like to employ people, the traineeships are there, but<br />
the unfair dismissal provisions of this new Act are just too much of a<br />
deterrent, it's too much of a liability." Would you consider in this<br />
review, looking at those again and perhaps modifying those provisions.<br />
PM: Laurie Brereton has said as with all path breaking legislation, the<br />
whole package that he will review it. But, you know, there will<br />
always be some people who will say, " If it wasn't for this, we would do<br />
that... If it wasn't for the exchange rate, if it was competitive, we'd<br />
actually invest", so you give them a competitive exchange rate. " Oh, if<br />
it wasn't for the low profits, we would invest," so you give them a high<br />
profit share. " Oh, look, if it wasn't for the tax system, if it wasn't for the<br />
high corporate tax rate," so you give them a 33 per cent corporate tax<br />
rate. " Oh, if we had faster acceleration depreciation we'd invest in<br />
plant and equipment," so you give them rapid acceleration<br />
depreciation. " Oh, if we had an investment allowance we might<br />
consider investing. If we had enterprise bargaining," yes we've given<br />
them enterprise bargaining. " Oh, well, what you've got to<br />
say hey, hey, hey, come on...<br />
SH: So in this review would you consider looking at these particular<br />
provisions?<br />
PM: What I'm saying is we're not going to be run by people who are<br />
basically offside politically, trying to market themselves as people who<br />
are, that is, people who basically barrack for the Coalition trying to<br />
make a point. In terms of the practical operation of industrial laws this<br />
review Laurie Brereton is speaking of will encompass these things.<br />
But, there can be no apologia for people not investing in a climate, last<br />
this conducive, probably thirty years ago.<br />
SH: Could I just address this specific provision though, because this has<br />
been a major sticking point, particularly for the Australian Chamber of </p>
<p>Commerce. Would you consider in this review looking again at the<br />
unfair dismissal provision?<br />
PM: Well, that's up to the Minister for Labour but I'm sure, given that there<br />
have been a number of organisations which have raised this with him,<br />
he will look at it, I'm sure.<br />
SH: Mr Keating, we may need to take a quick break, would you mind<br />
staying with us for a few minutes and then we'll be back to talk about<br />
one of your favourite friends, Alexander Downer.<br />
SH: Mr Keating, let's talk about Alexander Downer, some people are saying<br />
that your attack on him and his class and his background...<br />
PM: Hang on, just let me get this right, his attack on me.<br />
SH: Well, you have had a fairly vitriolic attack on him...<br />
PM: No, no, no I haven't<br />
SH: Let's just say, on the Adelaide Club and his background and the fact<br />
that he's come from a very wealthy background embellished in Liberal<br />
roots. Do you think that this has backfired, considering that you are<br />
very much entrenched in things such as Zegna suits and..<br />
PM: I'm very much entrenched in the Family Allowance Supplement, the<br />
Child Support Agency, supplementary payments for low paid women,<br />
Medicare, occupational superannuation for the low paid workforce,<br />
they're the things I am entrenched in, you see, and I'm not going to<br />
have people say that a decade with a social record of the kind of<br />
commitments I have to working Australians, men and women,<br />
particularly on low and middle incomes, are in some ways passed off<br />
or diminished because I happen to be able to admire a picture or<br />
something.<br />
SH: I can understand your view..<br />
PM: Let me just make this point though, you've made a point about a<br />
vitriolic attack I didn't attack him at all. What I said was, all I had to<br />
do was play back to Alexander Downer, John Hewson's words about<br />
the Melbourne Club and he went off like a fire cracker. I mean there is<br />
no steady hand at the wheel here. He went straight on television<br />
talking about my house in Sydney. I never mentioned his house or his<br />
private assets, never. But this is what these Liberals do. Mention a<br />
policy thing and they straight away go at you personally. What I said<br />
was if he wants to talk about, seriously an inclusive society he should<br />
resign from a club which excludes half the population. That is the<br />
point. I mean, how can anybody in 1994 support an institution which<br />
bars half the population and be out there talking about inclusion. In </p>
<p>other words, I'm making a social and political point. This is not a class<br />
point, this is not vitriol, it's making simply I mean, people these days<br />
don't seem to know what vitriol is it is making a political point. That in<br />
this day and age to say to women you can't be in this club I mean,<br />
he made the point he said ' oh, I guarantee you Keating has never<br />
walked into a club'. I've belonged to a club in Bankstown since I was<br />
21. I've been in it thousands of times. It has got 25,000 members<br />
men and women it is etched in the Liberal party's consciousness<br />
because it was there that I claimed victory in March last year the<br />
Bankstown Sports Club.<br />
It is repugnant to me that this notion of exclusivity that these people<br />
have should be that they can bail themselves up in clubs which<br />
exclude women and then be out there on the political hustings talking<br />
about inclusion. It is simply making a political point.<br />
SH: I understand that you don't like commentators and the media focusing<br />
on your personal assets and on your wealth and that's quite<br />
understandable, Is it not perhaps fair game to stay away from the<br />
personal attack and concentrate on the policies?<br />
PM: Exactly, but what personal attacks do you mean?<br />
SH: Well, you are talking about his wealth..<br />
PM: I have never mentioned his wealth and I have never mentioned his<br />
house. I wouldn't know where he lives.<br />
SH: Well, you are painting it very much as that's how..<br />
PM: Understand this. Alexander Downer went on two television programs<br />
the night after last when I had the temerity to repeat what John<br />
Hewson said about the Melbourne Club being critical in his selection,<br />
that is, the inner sanctum of the Victorian Liberal party, Malcolm<br />
Fraser, Staley, Ron Walker, Andrew Peacock, all these people, Jeff<br />
Kennett, and when I said that what was his response? ' Oh, Keating<br />
lives in a house in Elizabeth Bay with outlooks to the harbour' which it<br />
doesn't have. You know of my investment in a piggery, my first and<br />
only one in 22 years of public life. I mean, the fact is, as soon as you<br />
raise a political point against these characters, they are so thin<br />
skinned they go off like a cracker. And he went off with an attack on<br />
me. And then the next day I said well, hang on, you're talking about<br />
inclusiveness, do you think you can really talk about inclusiveness with<br />
any credibility when you belong to a club that won't let half the<br />
population into it.<br />
SH: Can I read this letter to you. This is a letter to the Sydney Morning<br />
Herald and it is by someone named ' if Mr Keating believes Mr<br />
Downer should resign from the Adelaide Club because it does not omit </p>
<p>women, then shouldn't he resign from the Catholic church. Its refusal<br />
to admit women to the ministry is also sexist or are there different<br />
interpretations where Mr Keating is concerned?.'<br />
PM: Look, I'm not here to have a religious discussion about the Catholic<br />
church. The fact of the matter is in this day and age I spent my life<br />
trying to look after the interests of lower and middle income Australians<br />
giving them access to health, to employment, to a decent social<br />
security system, and to decent income support in things like the Family<br />
Allowance Supplement, the Home Child care Allowance and more<br />
recently, of course, in the White Paper where we are picking up the<br />
long term unemployed. Now, my credentials are as clear as day and<br />
nobody is going to diminish those in a decade of social reform by<br />
making some reference to me and a French clock. It is just nonsense.<br />
But the simple point is this, that if Mr Downer seeks to be running the<br />
notion of inclusiveness, he's got to understand that you might get away<br />
with belonging to an outfit like the Adelaide Club when you . are a<br />
backbencher, but if you are the leader of a major party, you can't go<br />
out then and say I'm interested in the interests of half the population of<br />
women, but by the way, I won't let one of them into my club.<br />
SH: Could I just ask you this and this is a question that has been raised by<br />
a number of financial commentators talking about personal background<br />
and issues of wealth. A number of commentators have actually said<br />
that in fact Mr Keating is a far more wealthier man than Mr Downer.<br />
PM: That would be patently untrue. Remember this, for eighteen months in<br />
the last Parliament, every sitting day for nearly two years twenty<br />
months I had Senators at the behest of Dr Hewson asking questions<br />
about my investment in a simple piggery. Now, that has never<br />
happened. The Labor party has never done these things. They are<br />
villains these people and they never stop it. But the fact is look, Mr<br />
Downer is now leading a party, he's had the job two days a couple of<br />
days he presents it as a new look team, it is an old look team, he's<br />
got three former opposition leaders, he's got John Hewson saying<br />
yesterday that the front bench was chosen from Downer/ Costello<br />
supporters, he intends to speak widely on any policy matter and<br />
particularly economic matter that comes his way, he was critical on the<br />
diminution of the number of women in the front bench and you've got<br />
Mrs Bishop out there today with her outrageous statements about<br />
cigarettes. What you are going to see very quickly here is not a<br />
smooth change in leadership, but the same old Liberal party we've<br />
seen before. That is, people claiming territory as Dr Hewson is<br />
already doing. Mr Downer is saying it's a leaner party. He's got<br />
people on the front bench or as Parliamentary secretaries, he's got as<br />
many people that voted for him. The antithesis of discipline is to give<br />
virtually everybody who voted for you a job in the executive. </p>
<p>SH: Mr Keating, would you like to see the personal attacks on both sides<br />
from the Prime Minister and from the Leader of the Opposition taken<br />
out of politics given that Mr Downer has accused you of starting a<br />
class war on this issue?<br />
PM: I reject that absolutely. What I've had the temerity to do is repeat what<br />
John Hewson said and John Hewson said " this choice next week" he<br />
said this last Friday " will be between a party which is open and<br />
inclusive, a leader which is elected on that basis or one selected by<br />
the Melbourne Club" or the Melbourne business and political<br />
establishment that's what he said. I had the temerity to repeat it and<br />
I'm not going to, in a sense, in any way resile from making this point<br />
clear to the electorate, just where Mr Downer has come from. Now, let<br />
me just say about political attacks as distinct from personal that is,<br />
references to ones home, money, that sort of thing I've suffered more<br />
of that than any one in public life over twenty odd years.<br />
SH: Well, would you like to see that changed?<br />
PM: All I'm seeing here is Mr Downer just picking up the threads of where<br />
Dr Hewson left of. Within an hour or two of him getting the leadership,<br />
what's his first to reference to: my house in Sydney?<br />
SH: But that was only in response to your criticism of his membership of<br />
the Adelaide Club.<br />
PM: But, not his house or Look, if I can't get this through anyone else's<br />
head, I'm determined to get it through yours. Not about him<br />
personally, it is about his position in society and the exclusive position<br />
he claims to hold in the nature of his selection. This is a political point.<br />
It is not a personal point. That's the point.<br />
SH: Mr Keating, can I raise something else with you. This is a report in the<br />
Herald-Sun. Can I just read this to you after a surmptious dinner at<br />
the Lodge one night, Paul Keating ordered the staff to lay out all the<br />
antique silver cutlery on the table because he wanted to play..<br />
PM: I saw that, that's from Niki Savva.<br />
SH: I just wanted to find out..<br />
PM: Look its headed " Downer Wins in a Class War' from Niki Savva.<br />
SH: But, let me just explain to people what I'm talking about..<br />
PM: Niki laying out all the silver antique cutlery there isn't any in the<br />
Lodge for a start. I mean, the Lodge was built in 1927 and anything<br />
that goes.. </p>
<p>SH: We just need to explain to people what we are talking about. The gist<br />
of the story is that there was a guessing game on the make and the<br />
origins of the silver cutlery in the Lodge and I was curious to know<br />
whether, in fact, that was true?<br />
PM: No. Look, the thing is, ' Downer Wins in a Class War' says Niki Savva.<br />
Niki is basically an apologist for the Liberal party and she is going to<br />
fall in behind Mr Downer wherever she gets an opportunity and this<br />
piece is just another one of those.<br />
SH: So, there were no guessing games with the silver cutlery?<br />
PM: No, the thing is look, the fact of the matter is this, and to what point.<br />
Let's say to what point.<br />
SH: I'm simply asking you I mean it seems an unusual sort of dinner<br />
party game..<br />
PM: And see what she says. She goes on to say ' his opponent was the<br />
Queen'. Well, I've never had the Queen to the Lodge. The Queen has<br />
never been to the Lodge. So, Niki's husband is a key member of the<br />
Liberal party, so Niki writes what comes from the federal secretary or<br />
her husband.<br />
SH: Do it didn't happen?<br />
PM: It is just not true.<br />
SH: Can we end, we've only got a few minutes, can I end by asking you<br />
about D-Day. On 6 June you will be attending a monument to typhoon<br />
pilots. You, of course, were fairly young and perhaps too young to<br />
remember the war. What does D-Day mean to you?<br />
PM: What it means to me is, I think, the triumph of the democracies over<br />
totalitarianism and fascism in Europe and the fact that it was typified by<br />
the largest military assembly of military might and a landing at a point<br />
to reclaim Europe so dramatically, so pungently, if you like expressed<br />
in that military operation. I think, it says, perhaps encapsulates what<br />
the Second World War was about first of all the encroachment on<br />
countries and then their conquering by Hitler. The fact it then had<br />
continental Europe bar Russia, of course, tied up and then the repulse<br />
coming from the D-Day landings. So, in many ways, I think, if one has<br />
to have a mind snapshot of the liberation of Europe and the triumph of<br />
the democracies over fascism it is D-Day.<br />
SH: And what role will Australia be playing in all of this?<br />
PM: I was invited by the President of France and the Prime Minister of<br />
Britain because of Australia's involvement in the Second World War </p>
<p>generally in Europe and, of course, in two wars in Europe within<br />
years. In Europe and for the Battle of Britain, in the Middle East and,<br />
of course, as you know the Pacific.<br />
SH: And, do you think this will renew a lot of the thoughts and the<br />
memories that Australians have of that time, do you think that's going<br />
to be a major stumbling block in recognising what role Australia<br />
played.<br />
PM: No, I think that the 50th anniversary celebrations of heroic deeds by<br />
Australians or remembrances of heroic deeds by Australians in Papua<br />
New Guinea, in Singapore, throughout South-east Asia, in the defence<br />
of this country which occurred, of course, in the last 12 to 18 months,<br />
of the period of assault between 1942 and 1943, so, for the last two or<br />
three years we've had a role, if you like over a three year period, a role<br />
in the 50th anniversary. That plus the Entombment of the Unknown<br />
Soldier, I think, has brought back vividly to Australians the courageous<br />
role Australians have played in defence of liberty. This was never<br />
about a centimetre of Australian soil. We've always gone out there<br />
and fought because we were indignant about the way others are being<br />
treated. This is most particularly so in Europe.<br />
SH: Mr Keating, we'll have to leave it there. Thank you very much for<br />
coming in today.<br />
PM: Thank you, Sarah.<br />
