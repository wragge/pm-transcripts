A U S TZHA I. I A<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 8 DECEMBER 1977<br />
INTEREST RATES<br />
Mr Whitlam, Mr Hayden and Mr Hurford will not commit themselves<br />
to the Government's present policy of progressively lowering<br />
interest rates through the rest of this financial year<br />
because it is an implicit part of their plan to raise them.<br />
They would simply have no option, given the totality of their<br />
economic proposals. They know this only too well.<br />
The inevitability of higher interest rates under Labor can be<br />
seen from the statement published yesterday by the Treasurer,<br />
Mr Howard, in which he analyses and costs Labor's proposals.<br />
Under Labor ' te could well see an increase in this year's<br />
Government deficit in the order of $ 1200 million. That is an<br />
increase, in just six months, of about 50 percent in the deficit.<br />
A budgetary expansion ofthis order would shatter confidence. of<br />
overseas and Australian businessmen in Australia's investment<br />
prospects. For most of this year investors have been expecting both inflation<br />
and interest rates to continue falling through 1978. These<br />
expectations would be destroyed by the sudden change in<br />
fiscal and monetary policy that Labor would introduce.<br />
Far from investors wanting to go on buying Government securities,<br />
they would rapidly start selling them. This would be immediately<br />
reflected in higher market interest rates. In order to try<br />
to stem the tide, Labor would have to let interest rates rise.<br />
To try to fund the mounting deficit, Labor would have to try to<br />
sell more bonds, putting further pressure on interest rates,.<br />
By mid-1978, we could expect. interest rates of up to 12 percent.<br />
This would be disastrous for the now expanding investment<br />
in plant, machinery, and factories. It would send the home building<br />
industry into a downspin.<br />
Instead of being able to look forward to a $ 10 a week saving in<br />
interest rate payments on mortgages, home buyers would be paying<br />
a weekabove what they are presently paying.<br />
This is one example of the need to look at the totality of Labor's<br />
proposals when assessing their economic impact. / 2 </p>
<p>2.<br />
When account is also taken of the impact of a blowing out<br />
deficit on wages policy in a context of full wage indexation -the<br />
inflationary prospect becomes even worse.<br />
Double-digit inflation would be a realistic expectation in the<br />
course of 1978. The consequences for Australia's external<br />
account-would be clear and unavoidable.<br />
These are the fundamental reasons why Labor could not, under the<br />
proposals they have stated, get a swift pick-up in economic<br />
activity and a reduction in unemployment. There would be<br />
one clear result of Mr Whitlam's scheme to crack all Australia's<br />
problem in one crash spending spree: higher inflation-, much<br />
higher interest rates, and soaring unemployment. </p>
