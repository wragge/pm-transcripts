FOR MEDIA 25 JANUARY 1990<br />
The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child will open<br />
for signature in New York on Australia Day. The Australian Acting<br />
Permanent Representative to the United Nations will be present at<br />
the signature ceremony to demonstrate our commitment to it. We<br />
look forward to early signature as part of our continuing efforts<br />
to promote and extend universal standards for the observation of<br />
human rights.<br />
In accordance with the normal procedures for signing international<br />
legal instruments, we have consulted widely with interested groups<br />
and we are currently consulting States and Territories on their<br />
views. The Convention aims to protect and promote the human rights of<br />
children throughout the world. The Convention represents a major<br />
advance in setting international standards for the welfare of a<br />
particularly vulnerable group in society. For example, the<br />
Convention sets out the principle that both parents have joint<br />
primary responsibility for bringing up their children and that the<br />
Government should support them in this task, and endorses the<br />
child's rights to protection from abuse and neglect, from harmful<br />
or hazardous work, from drug abuse and from sexual exploitation.<br />
Australia has taken a leading role in developing the Convention in<br />
the United Nations system. We welcomed its adoption by the UN<br />
General Assembly late last year, and we hope for its early entry<br />
into force.<br />
I would like to commend the efforts of the Australian Human Rights<br />
and Equal Opportunity Commission in working towards the adoption by<br />
the UN General Assembly of the Convention on the Rights of the<br />
Child. The Federal Human Rights Commissioner, Brian Burdekin,<br />
acted as a special adviser to the Australian delegation and made a<br />
significant contribution to the drafting group on the Convention.<br />
The Commission has also implemented an extensive program of<br />
consultation and information in Australia about the Convention.<br />
I also pay tribute to the late Robert Nestdale, the former National<br />
Director of UNICEF, who worked tirelessly to realise the adoption<br />
of the Convention on the rights of the Child. It is very sad that,<br />
although he lived to see it adopted unanimously by all the<br />
countries of the UN General Assembly, he died before Australia<br />
could sign it. </p>
