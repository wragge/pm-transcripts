in the Asian and Pacific region, agreed that the two governments<br />
should cooperate with each other for the maintenance of peace and<br />

peace. In this connection they reaffirmed their strong<br />
opposition to the conduct of all nuclear weapons tests,<br />

view to further promoting cooperation and mutual understanding<br />

agricultural products, and conditions for business activities<br />
and investment. The Ministers agreed that it was essential for the<br />
prosperity of both countries to promote further cooperative<br />
relations between the two countries in the broadest possible<br />
area on the basis of mutual benefit and advantage.<br />
The Ministers, taking note of the development of<br />
broad exchanges not only in the political and economic fields<br />
but also in the cultural and academic spheres and a marked<br />
increase of mutual interest therein, were at one in their<br />
view that these cultural exchanges should further be promoted<br />
in order to strengthen the friendly relations between the two<br />
countries.* To this end, the Ministers recognised the necessity<br />
of concluding a cultural agreement between the two countries,<br />
and agreed that negotiations for that purpose should be<br />
commenced at a mutually convenient time.<br />
The Ministers, cognizant of the need for increased<br />
contacts between the two countries in the fields of the<br />
protection of nature and the preservation of the human<br />
environment, agreed to commence, as a first step in<br />
cooperation to that end, negotiations to conclude a treaty<br />
on the protection of migratory and other birds.<br />

government and the people of Japan for the very warm welcome<br />
extended to him, his wife and members of his party during their<br />
stay in Japan. Mr Whitlam extended a cordial invitation, in the name<br />
of the Government of Australia, for Mr Tanaka to visit<br />
Australia. This invitation was accepted with appreciation.<br />
