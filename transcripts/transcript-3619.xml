ANNUAL AGRICULTURAL SHOW,<br />
PENRITII, 1 FEBRUARY 1975<br />
I HOPE NO ONE WILL ACCUSE ME OF JUNKETING IF I<br />
POINT OUT THAT THIS IS MY SECOND VISIT TO PENRITH IN THE<br />
PAST FIVE MONTHS. I HAD THE PLEASURE OF OPENING A T. V.<br />
FACTORY HERE LAST SEPTEMBER; NOW I AM OPENING YOUR<br />
ANNUAL AGRICULTURAL SHOW. AND IT IS HERE IN THIS COMBINATION<br />
OF LOCAL ACTIVITY OF PRIMARY PRODUCTION AND VIGOROUS<br />
SECONDARY INDUSTRY THAT WE FIND THE GREAT STRENGTH AND<br />
DIVERSITY OF YOUR CITY AND YOUR REGION.<br />
PENRITH IS THE CENTRE OF A THRIVING AND PROSPEROUS<br />
COMMUNITY RICH IN HISTORY, RICH ' IN NATURAL BEAUTY, RICH<br />
IN NATURAL RESOURCES. IN YOUR ANNUAL SHOW WE SEE<br />
BOUNTIFUL EVIDENCE OF YOUR RURAL PROSPERITY. IT IS<br />
HEARTENING TO COME TO YOUR DISTRICT AND SENSE THE CONFIDENT<br />
AND INDUSTRIOUS SPIRIT OF THE PEOPLE OF THE NEPEAN. OUR,<br />
COUNTRY FACES PROBLEMS AS YOU ALL KNOW, BUT SO LONG AS THERE<br />
ARE DISTRICTS LIKE YOURSAND SHOWS LIKE YOURS WE CAN BE<br />
CERTAIN OUR PROBLEMS WILL BE BEATEN. THEY WILL BE BEATEN BY<br />
A STURDY, CONFIDENT PEOPLE, WITH FAITH I. N THEMSELVES,<br />
FAITH IN THEIR ABILITY TO PRODUCE THE GOODS WE NEED, FAITH<br />
IN THE VAST NATURAL RESOURCES OF OUR COUNTRY, FAITH IN THE<br />
BASIC STRENGTH OF OUR ECONOMY, FAITH IN A STRONG DEMOCRATIC<br />
SYSTEM AT ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT A SYSTEM WE MUST STRIVE<br />
TO PRESERVE. </p>
<p>HERE IN PENRITH, IN THE NEPEAN DISTRICT, YOU ARE<br />
. BUILDING UP THE STRENGTH AND RICHES OF OUR NATION. YOU ARE<br />
MAKING A BETTER LIFE FOR AUSTRALIANS EVERYWHERE, AND THE<br />
GOVERNMENT IS DETERMINED TO MAKE A BETTER LIFE FOR YOU,<br />
FOR THE FARMERS AND THE TOWNSPEOPLE IN OUR RURAL COMMUNITIES.<br />
YOU HEAR A LOT ABOUT OUR WORK FOR THE-CITIES; YOU DON'T<br />
HEAR SO MUCH ABOUT OUR WORK FOR THE COUNTRY TOWNS. THE<br />
PURPOSE OF SO MANY AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT INITIATIVES -OUR<br />
GRANTS TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT, OUT. AREA IMPROVEMENT PROGRAMS,<br />
OUR CONTRIBUTIONS TO SPORT AND RECREATION, TO MENTION A<br />
FEW IS TO MAKE LIFE IN COUNTRY TOWNS AS REWARDING, AS<br />
PROSPEROUS, AS SATISFYING AS' LIFE IN THE MAJOR CITIES.<br />
PENRITH IS TYPICAL OF THE CENTRES BENEFITING FROM<br />
AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT POLICIES FOR ASSISTING LOCAL<br />
GOVERNMENT AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT. AS A DIRECT RESULT<br />
OF OUR MEASUR~ ES MORE THAN $ 1,100,00 HAS BEEN ALLOCATED TO<br />
ASSIST YOUR CITY'IS GROWTH AND RAISE THE STANDARD OF COMMUNIT?,*<br />
SERVICES IN THE AREA. IN ADDITION, THE PEOPLE OF PENRITH<br />
AND THE NEPEAN DISTRICT WILL BENEFIT FROM OUR ASSISTANCE<br />
TO SCHOOLS, HEALTH SERVICES, ROADS, TRANSPORT.. DON'T OET<br />
THE IDEA THAT THESE MAJOR GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS ARE FOR<br />
CITY PEOPLE ONLY. OUR POLICIES ARE DESIGNED TO BENEFIT ALL<br />
AUSTRALIANS, WHEREVER THEY LIVE, WHEREVER AND HOWE VER THEY<br />
WORK. WE HAVE LONG BEEN AWARE OF THE-INADEQUACIES OF'OUR<br />
CITIES. RECENTLY, IN THE INTERIM REPORT OF T-HE COMMISSION<br />
OF INQUIRY INTO POVERTY WE HAVE* HAD STARK EVIDENCE OF POVERTY<br />
AND DEPRIVATION IN COUNTRY TOWNS. @ 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
ONE IN FOUR FAMILIES IN COUNTRY TOWNS LIVE IN POVERTY OR<br />
NEAR-POVERTY. THERE ARE MORE POOR FAMILIES IN AUSTRALIA'S<br />
COUNTRY TOWNS THAN THERE ARE IN SYDNEY AND MELBOURNE. YOU<br />
CAN-BE SURE OF THIS: WE ARE DETERMINED TO MAKE COUNTRY<br />
PEOPLE EQUAL PARTNERS IN A STRONG AND PROSPEROUS AUSTRALIA,<br />
THE GOVERNMENT WILL GET THE FACTS OF RURAL POVERTY AND BASE<br />
ITS PROGRAMS ON THE BEST POSSIBLE ADVICE. WE ARE GOING TO<br />
MAKE SURE THAT EVERY AUSTRALIAN HAS A DECENT STANDARD OF<br />
LIVING, A DECENT WAGE, A DECENT JOB, A DECENT HOME; THAT<br />
EVERY AUSTRALIAN IS PROUD'OF HIS COMMUNITY AND ITS LOCAL<br />
AMENITIES; THAT EVERY AUSTRALIAN HAS OPPORTUNIT'IES FOR<br />
WORK, EDUCATION, RECREATION AND PERSONAL FULFILMENT EQUAL<br />
TO THE BEST IN AUSTRALIA.-<br />
I-WANT PENRITH AND THE NEPEAN DISTRICT TO SET AN<br />
EXAMPLE. I WANT THEM TO SHOW WHAT AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENTS<br />
AT EVERY LEVEL CAN DO TO IMPROVE OPPORTUNITIES FOR COUNTRY<br />
PEOPLE AND CITIZENS IN COUNTRY TOWNS. ONE OF OUR FIRST<br />
INITIATIVES AS A GOVERNMENT WAS TO EMPOWER THE GRANTS<br />
COMMISSION TO REPORT ON INEQUALITIES BETWEEN REGIONS AND<br />
RECOMMEND GRANTS TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT BODIES TO OVERCOME<br />
SUCH INEQUALITIES. PENRITH CITY COUNCIL. HAS RECEIVED<br />
$ 330,000 UNDER THE GRANTS COMMISSION'S FIRST RECOMMENDATIONS.<br />
THESE ARE UNCONDITiONAL, NON-REPAYABLE GRANTS WITH NO<br />
STRINGS ATTACHED. THEY WILL HELP PROVIDE MANY OF THE<br />
ESSENTIAL SERVICES WHICH MODERN COMMUNITIES DEMAND. IN<br />
THE WHOLE OF THE WESTERN REGI. ONS OF SYDNEY, INCLUDING THE<br />
PENRITH DISTRICT, THE GRANTS TO LOCAL COUNCILS TOTALLED<br />
MORE THAN $ 3.3 MILLION THIS FINANCIAL YEAR. </p>
<p>PENRITH IS ONE OF THE REGIONS WEST OF SYDNEY<br />
RECEIVING FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE UNDER THE GOVERNMENT'IS<br />
AREA IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM. THIS IS A PROGRAM TO IMPROVE<br />
L IVING CONDITIONS BY EXPENDITURE ON RECREATION AND COMMUNITY<br />
FACILITIES WHEREVER IT IS NEEDED.. LAST FINANCIAL YEAR~<br />
PENRITH WAS ALLOCATED MORE THAN $ 800,000 FOR THE PURCHASE<br />
OFE COMMUNITY LAND RESERVES, PLANTING TREES, WIDENING<br />
ROADS, RESTORING BUILDINGS. MR. UREN A ND SIR CHARLES<br />
CUTLER HAVE ANNOUNCED A-CONTINUATION OF AREA IMPROVEMENT<br />
FUNDS-FOR THE PRESENT FINANCIAL YEAR. PENRITH WILL<br />
RECEIVE NEARLY $ 300,000, AND IN ADDITION, $ 50,000 FOR<br />
SPORTS OVALS AND AMENITIES UNDER A GRANT FROM THE DEPARTMENT<br />
OF TOURISM AND RECREATION. TOTAL SPORT AND RECREATION<br />
GRANTS TO THE NEPEAN AREA AMOUNT TO $ 250,000.<br />
I MENTION OTHER EXAMPLES. OUR NATIONAL SEWERAGE<br />
PROGRAM HAS BEEN EXPANDED TO INCLUDE CITIES AND TOWNS IN THE<br />
20,000 To 60,000 POPULATION RANGE. THAT MEANS PENRITH<br />
WILL BENEFIT FROM OUR PROGRAM TO OVERCOME THE-NATIONWIDE<br />
SEWERAGE BACKLOG. WITH THE CO-OPERATION OF THE N. S. W.<br />
GOVERNMENTI WE HOPE TO DOUBLE THE CAPACITY OF THE TREATMENT"<br />
WORKS AT ST. MARYS TO SERVE 150,000 PEOPLE.* WE. DON'T<br />
BELIEVE PEOPLE IN IMPORTANT COUNTRY TOWNS AND RURAL<br />
COMMUNITIES SHOULD HAVE TO PUT UP WITH INFERIOR SERVICES<br />
OF ANY KIND. WE ARE GETTING ON WITH THE JOB OF<br />
IMPROVING PUBLIC TRANSPORT. a, i </p>
<p>OUR PROGRAMS FOR URBAN PUBLIC TRANSPORT WILL DIRECTLY<br />
BENEFIT THE PEOPLE OF THE NEPEAN/ PENRITH AREA, WE ARE<br />
PROVIDING FUNDS TO WIDEN THE GLENBROOK RAILWAY TUNNEL<br />
AND QUADRUPLE THE RAILWAY LINE BETWEEN PENRITH AND GRANVILLE,<br />
THE MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT HAS APPROVED ARTERIAL ROAD WORKS<br />
IN THE PENRITH DISTRICT COSTING MORE THAN $ 2,5 MILLION, WE<br />
RECOGNISE PENRITH'S UNIQUE PLACE IN THE HISTORY OF AUSTRALIAN<br />
SETTLEMENT AND ARE DETERMINED TO PRESERVE THE BEAUTIFUL AND<br />
HISTORIC BUILDINGS OF THIS DISTRICT, OUR BUDGET FOR THE<br />
NATIONAL ESTATE ALLOCATED $ 50,000 TO THE NATIONAL TRUST TO<br />
HELP PURCHASE AND RESTORE TWO COTTAGES AT WINDSOR AND<br />
$ 100,000 TO RESTORE THE EXTERIOR OF THE MACQUARIE ARMS<br />
HOTEL,. IT IS A GREAT PLEASURE TO BE AMONG THE PEOPLE<br />
PRODUCING THE PRIMARY WEALTH OF OUR COUNTRY AND<br />
EXHIBITING THAT WEALTH IN SHOWS SUCH AS YOURS, WE DON'T<br />
TAKE THE VIEW THAT BECAUSE PEOPLE LIVE IN RURAL COMMUNITIES<br />
OR WORK ON FARMS THEY DESERVE SOMETHING LESS THAN OTHER<br />
AUSTRALIANS, IF THE COMMUNITY HAS A DUTY TO PROVIDE<br />
BETTER SCHOOLS, HOSPITALS, ROADS AND HOUSING IN THE CITIES<br />
IT HAS THE SAME DUTY IN THE COUNTRY AREAS, I KNOW FARMERS<br />
SOMETIMES THINK, OR ARE PERSUADED TO THINK, THAT THEY GET<br />
A RAW DEAL FROM A-LABOR GOVERNMENT, BUT WE KNOW YOUR<br />
PROBLEMS, AND THEY ARE PROBLEMS FACED BY FARMERS EVERYWHERE<br />
IN THE WORLD, / 6 </p>
<p>YOU CAN TAKE GREAT HEART FROM THE FACT THAT THE<br />
WORLD WILL ALWAYS NEED, AND INCREASINGLY NEED, WHAT<br />
YOU PRODUCE. DEPENDABLE LONG-TERM MARKETS ARE THE KEY<br />
TO YOUR1 PROSPERITY. No GOVERNMENT HAS WORKED HARDER<br />
TO SECURE THOSE MARKETS AND DEVELOP THE INTERNATIONAL.<br />
GOODWILL ON WHICH TRADE DEPENDS. BEING A GR AT TRADING<br />
. NATION BRINGS OBLIGATIONS AS WELL AS BENEFITS. WE HAVE TO<br />
BE SURE THAT IN PROTECTING OUR LOCAL INDUSTRIES WE DON'T<br />
HARM OUR PROSPECTS AS AN EXPORTER OF FOOD OR RAW MATERIALS.<br />
THESE ARE DIFFICULT DECISIONS, COMPLEX DECISIONS; BUT<br />
SUCH DECISIONS ARE THE STUFF OF MODERN GOVERNMENT. IT IS<br />
NOT EASY TO SAFEGUARD LIVING STANDARDS AND PRESERVE JOBS<br />
IN A WORLD OF INFLATION AND'UNEMPLOYMENT. WE NEED COOL<br />
JUDGMENT, A STEADY NERVE, A BALANCED AND RATIONAL SYSTEM OF<br />
PRIORITIES. WE DON'T BELIEVE IN SHORT-TERM, PATCH-UP MEASUR~ ES<br />
TO HELP THE FARMING COMMUNITY. WE WANT TO GET TO THE ROOTS<br />
OF YOUR DIFFICULTIES. THAT'S WHY WE ESTABLISHED THE<br />
INDUSTRIES ASSISTANCE COMMISSION TO GIVE EXPERT ADIVCE ON<br />
THE PROBLEMS OR ANY INDUSTRY, PRIMARY OF SECONDARY, AND TO<br />
RECOMMEND HELP AS NEEDED. THAT'S WHY WE CALLED FOR AN<br />
EXPERT GREEN* PAPER INTO RURAL INDUSTRY THE MOST THOROUGH<br />
INVESTIGATION OF FARMERS'I NEEDS AND PROBLEMS EVER MADE IN<br />
AUSTRALIA. THAT'S WHY WE ARE STUDYING THE WHOLE QUESTION<br />
OF FLUCTUATING RURAL INCOMES TO GIVE FARMERS A MORE<br />
STABLE AND ASSURED EXPECTATION OF INCOME OVER A LONGER<br />
TERM AND REMOVE MUCH OF THE HARDSHIP AND UNCERTAINTY OF<br />
RURAL LIFE. ea. 17 </p>
<p>-7-<br />
I CONGRATULATE THE ORGANISERS OF THIS SHOW. IT IS<br />
AN INSPIRATION TO SEE THE WORK OF A VIGOROUS AND BUOYANT<br />
RURAL COMMUNITY, TO SHARE THE OPTIMISM AND HOSPITALITY<br />
OF COUNTRY PEOPLE. I WISH YOU WELL IN YOUR EFFORTS TO<br />
DEVELOP THE AGRICULTURAL AND INDUSTRIAL POTENTIAL OF YOUR<br />
DISTRICT AND ASSURE YOU OF THE GOVERNMENT'S SUPPORT. I<br />
HAVE PLEASURE IN DECLARING OPEN THE NEPEAN DISTRICT<br />
AGRICULTURAL, HORTICULTURAL AND INDUSTRIAL SOCIETY'S<br />
ANNUAL AGRICULTURAL SHOW. </p>
