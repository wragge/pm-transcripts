ELECTORATE TALK<br />
Australians who believe in the right of elected Governments<br />
to make decisions that affect the welfare of each citizen<br />
will applaude the Victorian Government's decision to proceed<br />
with the Newport Power Station.<br />
It is a question of who controls the vital power supplies<br />
for Melbourne and the rest of Victoria.<br />
The Federal Government supports Mr Hamer's stand, and it's<br />
clear that his government's resolution in this matter has<br />
won wide support throughout the State.<br />
Mr Hamer has been most patient, reasonable and very willing to<br />
listen to argument on this issue. The question of union<br />
activities in the area of vital services has been canvassed<br />
in other parts of Australia over the past week or so.<br />
Mr Wran has indicated a real degree of frustration with what<br />
has been happening in New South Wales. Clearly, this<br />
question is not just confined to one side of the political arena.<br />
GoVernments from both political views are thoroughly fed up<br />
with being held to ransom by a few militant union leaders.<br />
I believe also that the great bulk of the trade union movement<br />
has become disillusioned with the irresponsibility of a few<br />
union officials who are often in comumunist dominated unions.<br />
Our secret postal ballot legislat ion, in operation since August,<br />
places a powerful weapon in the hands of union members, who<br />
become convinced that the actions of their union are contrary<br />
to their own interests.<br />
Most trade unionists know that no section of the community can<br />
adopt attitudes, or try and force attitudes, in isolation from<br />
the rest of the community, without causing lasting harm..<br />
People rightly demand that both business and unions recognise<br />
that they are part of a community, and that they must boconcerned<br />
with the impact of their actions upon other people in<br />
that community. / 12 </p>
<p>Today, unions and management have clearly defined social<br />
responsibilities.. Union responsibilities extend much beyond<br />
wage issues for their members. Management responsibilities<br />
extend much beyond providing a place of employment.<br />
Rejection of unreasonable strikes of all kinds from political<br />
strikes to strikes that come from inter-union disputes<br />
are part of the trade union movement social responsibility.<br />
These strikes do nothing more than raise costs, inhibit production<br />
and destroy job opportunities.<br />
But their responsibilities go further. For example, union<br />
journals are almost invariably published in English. This<br />
happens despite the large numbers of non-English speaking<br />
employees in many industries.<br />
Until the union movement does more to close this information<br />
gap between themselves and their migrant members, they can hardly<br />
claim to be adequatel-y representing those members.<br />
Managements, too, have an equal responsibility. Only a few<br />
employers, for example, provide multi-lingual information on<br />
award provisions, working conditions, and company information<br />
for migrant workers. The lack of multi-lingual safety signs<br />
could also well contribute to industrial accidents among<br />
migrant workers.<br />
The needs of other disadvantaged m inorities working mothers,<br />
youth and Aboriginals must also be considered in a practical<br />
way by unions and management.<br />
Government, of course, has' significant responsibilities in<br />
these areas. We have taken positive and effective action in<br />
these areas, but much can be done by unions and management<br />
who have the will to help.<br />
The Government looks for future signs, from both unions and<br />
management, that they will recognise the great social responsibility<br />
they must bear if this nation is to prosper as we would all want.<br />
This week the Government made a significant decision that will<br />
provide for more effective management of the business of<br />
Government particularly in relation to the national economy.<br />
The Government announced that the financial management activites<br />
of the Treasury Department will be separated from its role as<br />
an economic policy analysis and advice source.<br />
In future the financial management and control functions will<br />
be carried out by a newly created Department of Finance.<br />
In effect, the decision means that more concentrated attention<br />
will be given to budget management, development of forward<br />
estimating, the analysis of economic issues and the creation<br />
of economic strategy. 3 </p>
<p>In addition, there will be a strengthening of existing<br />
resources available in the Department of Prime Minister and<br />
Cabinet to study the overall effectiveness of Government<br />
programmes. to make sure that those programmes are meeting<br />
the objectives set-for them.<br />
The closest cooperation will, of course, be maintain~ ed<br />
between my own Department and the Department of Treasury<br />
and the new Department of Finance.<br />
The Treasurer, Mr Lynch, of course, remains in charge of<br />
both the Treasury and the new Department of Finance.<br />
The new arrangements will add greatly to Government effectiveness<br />
in dealing responsibly with major economic issues that<br />
face Australia.<br />
There is one other area where we have made significant<br />
changes in the public service structure. In Opposition we<br />
were concerned that certain appointments made to the Public<br />
Service could only introduce, or tend to introduce politics<br />
into the Public Service. We have always been concerned<br />
that appointments to the most senior positions in the Public<br />
Service be made by due process, under proper procedures,<br />
on proper recommendations, from the Public Service.<br />
We do not want to see the Public Service become political<br />
because of the nature of appointments.<br />
As a result we have now established procedures that will make<br />
sure that Governments take proper advice concerning the<br />
appointment of permanent heads. If they follow such advice,<br />
and appoint somebody off a short list, selected by due<br />
process, then that person wil1l become a permanent Public Servant.<br />
But if a government, by whim of its own, by a decision of<br />
its own, wants to choose somebody else, then the Government<br />
can do so, but the person will not have permanent status<br />
and an incoming government would be able to terminate the<br />
appointment.<br />
We believe that that procedure will prevent political appointments<br />
being made to the Public Servi-ce, but if they are made<br />
in the future,' then the appointment will only be for a<br />
short term.<br />
The procedures are being established in the law, and therefore,<br />
they will have to be followed.<br />
My Government has strong views about this particular matter.<br />
We believe that the Public Service must maintain its apolitical<br />
position, so that its most senior people especially are<br />
able to serve Governments of either political party with<br />
loyalty and dedication.<br />
This has been the position in the past in relation to the<br />
Australian Public Service and the legislation I introduced<br />
last week will do much to protect that position in the years to come.<br />
