EMBARGO: AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
" IjI AL A,<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA THURSDAY, 28 AUGUST, 1-94! 0<br />
SPEECH IN THE DEBATE ON THE 1980/ 81 BUDGET<br />
Mr. Speaker, twelve months ago the Leader of the Opposition<br />
described the 1979/ 80 Budget as " without doubt the most<br />
contractionary in the 18 years I have been a member of this<br />
Parliament". Perhaps the first thing I should do is to welcome<br />
his declaration that the 1980/ 81 Budget is also a contractionary<br />
Budget. If he is as wrong about this year's Budget as he clearly<br />
was about last year's, we can look forward to another very good<br />
year. His outdated and discredited diagnosis of Tuesday evening<br />
ignores the fact that, in circumstances of continued inflation,<br />
the key elements of the Government's Budget, limiti ' ng the growth<br />
of the Commonwealth Budget outlays and, through the further<br />
substantial reduction in our deficit, reining i~ n the public<br />
sector borrowing requirement not only allow the expansion of.<br />
the private sector, but also they offer the only chance for<br />
sustainable economic growth in the 80s. And that is the choice<br />
before us.<br />
Do we want sustainable-economic growth, through the containment<br />
of inflation, that has been secured by. Liberal/ National Country<br />
Party Government? Or do we squander our hard won gains through<br />
big spending, big deficits and high inflation which Labor<br />
guaranteed us on Tuesday evening?<br />
1979/ 80 brought Australia further along the road to national<br />
economic recovery with a Budget which, by the Leader of the<br />
Opposition's standards, was much more " contractionary" than<br />
this year's. Yet for the second year in a row, in 1979/ 80,<br />
growth accelerated, notwithstanding the adverse effects of<br />
industrial disputes on output in the second half of the year.<br />
And the public sector contributed less than one-quarter of to<br />
the growth in non-farm product of over Even that cartoon<br />
figure Blind Freddie a character not unknown to the Leader of<br />
the Opposition could not have failed to see the strengthening<br />
of the economy last year.<br />
Let me remind the Leader of the Opposition that, at the time<br />
of last year's Budget, he said: " If my assessment of economic<br />
growth is correct it was last year there will be less than<br />
2% growth for the year in the non-farm sector". / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
How does what the Leader of the Opposition said then tally with<br />
the facts today: the increase of 3.1% in non-farm G. D. P. ( not<br />
the predicted by the doom-mongers of the-Labor Party), was<br />
one percentage point more than i n 1978/ 79; employment in the<br />
12 months to July this year rose by 212,000, the highest annual<br />
increase for 10 years; real private investment in dwellings<br />
was over 10% higher than in 1978/ 79; consumer spending 0<br />
strengthened over the course of the year, rising in real terms<br />
at an annual rate of 2.9% in the second half; exports increased<br />
in real terms by no less than 14-2/% for the year as a whole; and<br />
private sector external transactions recorded the largest<br />
surplus since 1972/ 73. Just as important as this strengthening<br />
year-on-year, was the streng~ thening within the course of the<br />
year, when internally-generated demand took over from exports as<br />
the major impetus to growth. These are unchallengeable<br />
achievements. What Mr. Hayden didn't say on Tuesday evening was that the<br />
I. D. C. on economic strategy recorded that, "... there is general<br />
agreement about the appropriateness of the overall ( economic)<br />
strategy. It is agreed that no substantially different<br />
alternatives are available.. As a nation, we have come a<br />
long way since 1975, the Hayden days, when total economic<br />
disorder and investment decay were-created through the same<br />
economic prescription that was paraded before us on Tuesday<br />
evening. Labor in the 80s is merely. Labor in the 70s recycled.<br />
This Government has laid sound foundations for the economy in<br />
the face of a difficult and demanding legacy. As a result, we<br />
are on the verge of what is potenclially one of the most_ exciting<br />
eras of economic development in our history. Certainly, there<br />
will be difficulties in realising, our potential. Above all,<br />
we shall need a continuation of the right policies. In<br />
particular we shall need the continuation of a firm policy stance<br />
from Government to make sure that inflationary pressures are<br />
contained. For the containment of inflation must continue to<br />
remain the principal economic priority of Government if the<br />
well-being of all Australians is to be secured.<br />
The Labor years taught us bitterly what many economies throughout<br />
the world are now learning: that inflation has the capacity<br />
to destroy our living standards; that inflation will destroy<br />
national confidence, national capacity, and national will; that<br />
inflation strikes at those least able to defend themselves from<br />
it the old, the sick, the disadvantaged, and the low income<br />
earner; Lihat inflation, as it did in the mid 70s, cripples<br />
investment, development and business expansion on which our<br />
national wealth depends; and the I. D. C. report further confirms<br />
our strategy when it says: " realisation of the investment<br />
potential depends most importantly on maintenance of a stable<br />
economic environment through firm anti-inflationary policies<br />
conducive to foreign as well as domestic investment".<br />
That is why the first priority of economic management in the<br />
ignored on Tuesday evening by the Leader of the Opposition,<br />
must remain the containment of inflation. A political party<br />
which does not attack the source of inflation is little better<br />
than a political party which ignores breaches of law..<br />
For inflation robs people of their freedom and their security. </p>
<p>-3<br />
our success in the fight against inflation, in absolute<br />
and relative terms, is the cornerstone of the economic<br />
recovery that is now under way in Australia. The last thing<br />
we need, in the period ahead, is the so-called " stimulatory"<br />
policies of the Opposition which could only lead to a disastrous<br />
acceleration of inflation.<br />
The Leader of the Opposition has forgotten that, in his own<br />
Budget as Treasurer in 1975, he firmly declared that " it is<br />
inflation itself which is the central policy problem. more<br />
inflation simply leads to more unemployment". That was precisely<br />
the result of tabor's disastrous years in office.<br />
And m4r. Hayden demonstrated on Tuesday evening that he does not<br />
even believe now what was written for him then. During his<br />
reply to the Budget, he boasted that " the cost of ( his)<br />
programmes has been hidden from no-one". And Mr. Hayden<br />
announced that five of the Labor programmes, and a tax cut,<br />
in the one year, would cost no less than*$ 1435 million on his<br />
own costings.<br />
But what he had hidden from everyone was the commitment he<br />
made on " AM" on 20 August to raise pensions to 25% of average<br />
weekly earnings, with a further commitment in the long term,<br />
to increase them to 30% of average weekly earnings. The total<br />
immediate cost to taxpayers of this, about $ 500 million, was<br />
hidden from us in the Budget reply speech. So that on the most<br />
conservative estimates, Mr. Hayden should have been-talking last<br />
Tuesday evening of $ 2,000 million. And, of course, that hides<br />
from us the cost of all the other Labor-programmes over<br />
250 of them.<br />
Yet yesterday morning on radio, Mr.. Hayden announced that " the<br />
cost of the progrartm-es would be $ 835 million". of course, thi. s<br />
is sheer myth. The man who said that the cost of his programmes<br />
would be hidden from no-one, conveniently hid from a national<br />
radio audience the cost of the tax cut, the cost of the commitment<br />
to increased pensions, and the cost of more than 250 other<br />
Labor programmnes.<br />
So which Mr. Hayden are we to believe? Can the Labor Party<br />
believe that he is still committed to the 250 programmes?<br />
Even without these do we believe the August 20 Mr. Hayden,<br />
the $ 2,000 million dollar-man? Or do we believe the last<br />
Tuesday evening Mr. Hayden, the $ 1435 million dollar man?<br />
Or do we believe the last Wednesday morning Mr. Hayden, the<br />
$ 835 million dollar man? Which is the real Mr. Hayden? Which<br />
Mr. Hayden are we being asked to afford? What confusion will<br />
the Labor Party try next? What deception will next be tried on<br />
the Australian taxpayer? Let us take the figure of $ 1435 million<br />
which can be deduced from his speech in the House last Tuesday<br />
evening. One of the items listed in Mr. Hayden's speech was<br />
"$ 180 million for new jobs". / 14 </p>
<p>-4<br />
Yet Labor's job opportunities programme announced in March<br />
this year contains the following statements: " The community<br />
service corps when fully operational will cost $ 200 million<br />
a year"; " The work programme when fully operational,<br />
$ 110 million a year"; " Private sector employment and training<br />
programme $ 20 million". A total of $ 330 million a year.<br />
Which Mr. Hayden do we believe? The March $ 330 million dollar<br />
Mr. Hayden, or the last Tuesday evening $ 180 million dollar<br />
Mr. Hayden?<br />
But there is another Mr. Hayden -the August 1977 Hayden.<br />
For on -the 11th August 1977, the now Leader of the opposition<br />
in company with Mr. Whitlam. announced a plan to " place more<br />
than 50,000 in work in a full year". 50,000, not 100,000 as<br />
is being promised now. And Mr. Hayden gave us some selections<br />
of cost in 1977. Gross, $ 800 million in a full year; net<br />
$ 550 million in a full year. And that is for 50,000 jobs.<br />
Yet in March this year, Mr. Hayden was going to create 100,000<br />
for $ 330 million, and Tuesday night he was going to do it for<br />
$ 180 million. No wonder one of his colleagues in the Party in<br />
Queensland was prompted to remark recently, " Bill Hayden I think<br />
is a confused man". He is allowed his confusion.<br />
But that is no justification for perpetrating this kind of<br />
deception on the working men and women of Australia, at their<br />
expense. An expense which on our castings is $ 2., 300 million<br />
in only six areas; with the cost of the tax cut to be thrown in<br />
on -top of that; and t%-he cost of: over 250 other progra,=-es.<br />
The statement by the Leader of the Opposition last Tuesday evening.<br />
was a statement of selective omission. For there is no mention<br />
of more than 250 programmes to which the Labor Party is committed.<br />
And that commitment has been clearly enunciated by the Leader<br />
of the Opposition himself. In June this year, Mr. Hayden was.<br />
unapologetic when he said, " What I do say is that we have the<br />
sanction of our platform to devise policies and we are prepared<br />
to implement them as a Government". Well, the platform and<br />
subsequent policy releases for over 250 programmes involve<br />
massive spending of taxpayers' money. But aware of the<br />
overwhelming electoral opposition by taxpayers to having their<br />
money wasted on socialist planning, Mr. Hayden, in a tape to<br />
A. L. P. members in March this year, said, " We have to present<br />
our policies in an attractive and digestible form now this<br />
requires us to be selective". Does this mean tChat Mr. Hayden<br />
is going to hide some of his commitments from the electorate<br />
because they are not popular? Commitments like: the Australian<br />
Hydra-Carbon Corporation, where big money is involved; the<br />
Fuel and Energy Commission, more big money involved; a national<br />
superannuation scheme, more big money; the restoration of<br />
Medibank; and a national investment fund. Where have we been<br />
given the costs of these?<br />
Does this mean that, because Mr. Hayden is afraid of losing<br />
votes, certain policies will be ignored in an attempt to deceive.<br />
the electorate? </p>
<p>Does this mean Mr. Hayden is aware that, if he announced all<br />
his spending programmes together, he would lose massive<br />
electoral support? Does this mean he recognises the<br />
impossibility, the recklessness and the irresponsibility of the<br />
total Labor package. Is that what Mr. Hayden means when he<br />
says he must be selective?<br />
The simple truth is Mr. Hayden has not costed the programmes;<br />
he cannot cost the programmes; arnd, because of his fear of<br />
the electoral reaction, he will not cost them. Well, this<br />
Government and this Parliament will not allow Mr. Hayden or<br />
his Party the latitude of such selectivity. Let them stand<br />
up anrd be, costed. But the backdowns and the omissions in<br />
the Opposition Leader's statement do not end there.<br />
Less than two weeks ago, on 13 August, Mr. Hayden was reported<br />
as saying quite categorically, " A Federal Labor Government would.<br />
offer cheaper health insurance and lower petrol prices and<br />
sales " Labor would also consider lowering income tax".<br />
And in the ultimate flight of fancy, the Opposition Leader said,<br />
these aims could be achieved in a ' trade-off" with the union<br />
movement. Well what happened on Tuesday evening? The commitment of 13 August<br />
had evaporated. We were given no commitment, only options.<br />
And then only one of the three that had been promised only<br />
13 days before. Mr. Hayden has no doubt awoken to the opposition<br />
within the electorate to his big spending proposals, but he.-is<br />
bound bv the left wing of his Party and the resolutions of his<br />
conference. He may seek to avoid mentioning A. L. P. commitmentsbut<br />
he will not be allowed to ignore them, by his back bench,<br />
his Shadow Ministry, the rank and file or the union movement.<br />
And the consequences for Australia must not be taken lightly<br />
by this Parliament or the Australian people.<br />
The economic prescription outlined by the Opposition Leader<br />
on Tuesday evening is: rejected by major industrialised<br />
countries; rejected by academics; rejected b y the metropolitan<br />
press; rejected by businessmen; rejected by the O. E. C. D.;<br />
rejected by the rejected even by the Democratic Party<br />
of the and,. as Mr. Hayden should now know, rejected by<br />
the report of the Interdepartmental Committee on Economic Strategy.<br />
And it was once rejected by Mr. Hayden himself when he said:<br />
" Some might argue that a large deficit could be offset by a<br />
tough monetary policy but this would mean greatly increased<br />
interest rates, disruption in financial markets, further.<br />
depression of business confidence and serious company failures.<br />
That is an-unacceptable option". Or again,." It is not possible<br />
to provide more and more Government services or transfer<br />
payments from the Budget without ultimately having to pay for them<br />
through cutting back after tax earnings via increased taxes. It<br />
is not possible to get quarts out of pint pots".<br />
Yet now Mr. Hayden says he can increase expenditure and reduce<br />
taxes.. And how is going to manage this? / 6 </p>
<p>-6<br />
He told us on " AM" on Wednesday morning that deficits can be<br />
funded, " by an increase in the money supply"; by the use, that<br />
is, of the printing presses. What great self-confessed economic<br />
wizardry is that? It is no wonder Clem Jones, the former<br />
Lord Mayor of Brisbane, and one of the more successful Labor<br />
Party administrators in recent years, remarked, " It is recognised<br />
that Bill Hayden has admitted he cannot read a balance sheet".<br />
The other significant omission of the statement by the<br />
Leader of the Opposition in his Budget speech was the promise<br />
to increase taxes dramatically. In December last year,<br />
Mr. Hayden reminded us that his revenue raising programmes<br />
wiere, " somewhat more radical than had been outlined up to<br />
1972". He warned us then about our taxation future under Labor,<br />
when he said, . I have committed my organisation to a capital<br />
gains tax, a resource rental tax, a levy on domestic oil<br />
producers, a number of initiatives in the tax area and other<br />
measures of that nature..."<br />
In what constitutes an elaboration of the " other measures" the<br />
Opposition's Spokesman on Economic Affairs has said that it<br />
is " wrong" that we don't have " some form of tax on capital, be it<br />
death duties, capital gains tax, wealth tax or perhaps some kind of<br />
combination of those, or all three".<br />
The Labor Party are now enjoying a renewed fascination with the<br />
concept of a capital gains tax. I recall the announcement by<br />
the then Government in its 1974 Budget speech to introduce a<br />
capital gains tax just as I recall the announcement of the<br />
abandonment of that intention five months later.<br />
The fascination with this general topic seems to be based on<br />
an unproven belief that there is a large number of relatively<br />
very wealthy people in the community, so much so that Mr. Willis<br />
believes $ 700 million will accrue annually from this tax.<br />
What is one to make of such illusory revenue sources?<br />
And the so-called social contract promised a Royal Commission<br />
into income and wealth which, " would not be frustrated in its<br />
endeavours by unco-operative attitudes from those with something<br />
to hide". There is no doubt that the fires of envy still burn<br />
very brightly within the Labor Party. But such taxation threats<br />
will not escape the attention of hard working Australians.<br />
For they would sound the death knell of enterprise, initiative,<br />
and reward for effort and risk taking. They would destroy<br />
economic freedom.<br />
To complete Labor's picture of economic incredibility, Mr. Hayden<br />
announced that he and the union movement had achieved, " For the.<br />
first time in this country a political-industrial agreement<br />
on procedures for an effective and economically sound policy<br />
covering prices, wages and non-wage incomes" / 7 </p>
<p>-7<br />
His statement to the Parliament was not 24' hours old when<br />
the newspapers carried the details of A. C. T. U. demands made<br />
before the President of the Arbitration Commission demands<br />
which bore no resemblance to restraint.<br />
As reported in the press, they included: demands for regular<br />
automatic wage adjustment based on movements in the Consumer<br />
Price Index; the right to collective bargaining; the use<br />
of national productivity increases to further wage demands;<br />
the pursuit * of the 35 hour week on an industry basis; and<br />
the continuation of work value decisions.<br />
This is presumably what mr. Hayden calls, " effective and<br />
economically sound policy". It is unsurprising to read today<br />
that the A. C. T. U.' s senior Vice-President, Mr. Cliff Dolan,<br />
has said, " there is no social contract on wages between the<br />
A. C. T. U. and the Labor Party".<br />
It is perfectly clear that the union movement will not accept<br />
any limitation on their freedoms for the sake of Bill Hayden's<br />
social agreement. And when to this lack of restraint by the<br />
union movement, we add the provisions of the A. L. P.. platform<br />
which grant immunity to unions from penalties for strike action,<br />
thereby placing the union movement above the law, we have a<br />
clear picture of the nature of the special relationship that<br />
Mr. Hayden says he has with the union movement. It ' was this<br />
relationship which saw award wages for males in the year to<br />
March 1975 rise by almost 35% and for females by over 43%.<br />
It was this relationship that forced unemployment to double<br />
under the previous Labor administration.<br />
The relationship between Mr. Hayden and the union movement<br />
is like the special relationship that exists between a<br />
ventriloquist and his doll a slight twist from the left<br />
wrist and Bill's head nods up and down.<br />
Mr. Speaker, my Government will continue to work to further<br />
reduce both the share of resources by Commonwealth Budget outlays<br />
and the Budget deficit itself, because we remain firmly<br />
committed to winding back inflation. Economic responsibility<br />
will continue to be our watchword. Strengthening private sector<br />
demand and pressure of rising prices from overseas over the<br />
past 18 months, call for firm fiscal and monetary policies in<br />
the period ahead if inflationary pressures are to be contained<br />
and our inflation rate is again to resume its downward trend.<br />
We will be aiming, in particular, to secure a lower growth<br />
in the money supply in 1980/ 81, with monetary policy playing<br />
an enhanced role. The 1980/ 81 Budget, in association with an<br />
appropriate monetary policy, and with the co-operation of the<br />
majority of Australians is directed to ensuring that the nation<br />
can realise the bright economic prospects now before us.<br />
