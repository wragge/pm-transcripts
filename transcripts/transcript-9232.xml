TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
COLLINGWOOD FOOTBALL CLUB POST BUDGET LUNCH<br />
MELBOURNE, FRIDAY 13 MAY, 1994<br />
QUESTION AND ANSWER SESSION<br />
Q: ( Inaudible)... I'd like to know if you'd be interested in having an Accord<br />
with business, you've had an Accord with the unions but what about an<br />
Accord with business?<br />
PMV: Well, the emphasis of the Accord was, the Accord started from the<br />
1983 economic summit which was a cooperative undertaking between<br />
the government and business and the trade unions to sit down and sort<br />
out where our national income went and what we did with it. And, as a<br />
consequence of this, we've seen a great behavioural change in the<br />
workforce which has, over time, expressly, beneficially affected<br />
business. And the consequence of that is now that the profit share,<br />
that is the proportion of national income going to profits, is today as<br />
high as it was in 1988 and in 1988 it was beyond any historical<br />
experience in Australia. It was the highest profit share in our history.<br />
And, we've got, as a consequence of wage restraint, we've got<br />
endemically low inflation at around two per cent. So, low inflation<br />
gives us the capacity to have low interest rates, a higher profit share<br />
gives us the capacity to have investment and the government has built<br />
on these things by introducing a 33 per cent corporate tax rate from a<br />
high of 49 per cent, which it was not so many years ago. We've<br />
removed the double tax on dividends, we've got a big tax break in<br />
there for research and development, a 150 per cent write off. So,<br />
there's a package of things and central to that is the Accord. So, while<br />
the government's been able to sit down with the trade unions because<br />
we're now a more decentralised labour market where the centralised<br />
system of today is but a remnant of what it was and where most<br />
wage fixation is done on an enterprise basis and that will continue to<br />
become more the case in the next couple of years, the Accord </p>
<p>becomes more a state of mind than an actual instrument for setting<br />
wages or prices or profits. But, the commitment from the trade unions<br />
is that we'll have wages growth in Australia so as we have an inflation<br />
rate competitive with our trading partners. So, the Accord is now 11<br />
years old and the sea change in the Australian labour market has been<br />
so profound that we can sit with one of the lowest inflation rates in the<br />
world. So, while business doesn't sit at that table or didn't sit when<br />
the Accord was entered into last in 1993 for the three years in fact,<br />
business is always there because the very essence of the change is to<br />
promote higher profits, to have a more flexible system of enterprises in<br />
this country, a better system of enterprise bargaining and, of course, in<br />
the end, greater competitiveness. So, business is, let's say, the silent<br />
partner in the Accord but the clear beneficiary.<br />
Q: I thank you for that explanation, it's excellent. However, in any game, I<br />
put to you, we need two teams. We've got the government, we've got<br />
the unions, but we need another player and that's business. So, you<br />
can't win the competition unless you've got the ( inaudible)..... in the<br />
game. So how about letting business get into the league?<br />
PM: Well, what a government must do or try to do is create the conditions<br />
for growth. This is where business gets its crack at the title, its piece<br />
of the action. And as the Budget forecasts ( inaudible).... we're going<br />
to be growing in the coming year at about four and a half percent. We<br />
grew at four percent for the year to December and we're saying the<br />
economy will grow, in the coming financial year from 1 July at four and<br />
a half per cent. Now, the average rate of growth of the OECD<br />
economies, that's the Western world economies, this year is one per<br />
cent. So, we're growing now, much more rapidly than that and now<br />
we've got a more flexible economy than we had in the 1980s where we<br />
averaged four and a half per cent from 1983-90. We might be able to<br />
do that with more ease now or even do better. So, this is where<br />
business gets its chance at the national cake and where it's involved<br />
and becomes central to the whole thing, through the progression of<br />
growth. And, growth is maintained by the public sector hopping out of the way<br />
as demand for savings, for investment comes through in the<br />
investment phase of the recovery. And, this is what the Budget has<br />
sought to do, to pull out the fiscal stimulus or the underpinning or the<br />
cushioning which has, if you like, provided the shock absorber for the<br />
community and the economy over the last three or so difficult years.<br />
So, as now we are starting to grow we don't need the Commonwealth<br />
cushion in there. So, we're now gradually withdrawing it but we don't<br />
want to withdraw it too quickly unless the game collapses again, well<br />
slows down, slows to a rate other than that which we could otherwise<br />
attain. </p>
<p>So, we've got, we think, the right balances. That is, we provided the<br />
cushioning for the recession, the Budget balance changed by $ 20 odd<br />
billion, that meant there was $ 20 billion more being spent than would<br />
otherwise be spent. But, now the economy is picking up we can<br />
withdraw it and business can come in and take up the slack.<br />
Q: Mr Keating my name is Tim Grant, I manage Beaurepaire, the large<br />
Australian tyre company. We're a large provider of goods and<br />
services to government at federal and state levels but I wonder why<br />
federally, the government doesn't take a stronger stance regarding the<br />
purchase of Australian made for government.<br />
PM: Well, there is a policy which we've developed for government<br />
purchasing and generally it devolves around suppliers who have a<br />
record of supply with the Commonwealth. But, I don't think that<br />
government purchasing government purchasing can be important<br />
particularly in developing industries which might not otherwise have<br />
the kick along that they have had without government purchasing.<br />
Computer software comes to mind instantly as a locally grown<br />
business in this country that would not be as strong as it is today<br />
without the Commonwealth being a major purchaser of that sort of<br />
product. But, the sea change in Australia in the last few years, of<br />
course, is the fact that it's a much more open economy.<br />
And now it is more open it means, generally, our manufacturers have<br />
measured up to the competition and we're now doing things much<br />
more smartly and much more competitively. I mean, the, perhaps,<br />
most obvious place we can look is the motor industry. Look at the<br />
quality of Australian cars today and the price, compared to 10 years<br />
ago. And there's only one reason why it's there and that's because the<br />
tariff wall has come down. Now were that not to be the case we'd be<br />
still making expensive cars of much less quality because there is no<br />
need to get to where the world insists that you should. As a<br />
consequence of getting there, we've had major investments by general<br />
motors, Ford is now considering where it goes with the Falcon<br />
replacement, Toyota has made the decision to put a five million dollar<br />
state of the art car plant in Melbourne and to feed its product into the<br />
international system, Mitsubishi have just made a decision to build a<br />
Mitsubishi Magna in South Australia for world distribution and is now<br />
considering where it goes with the Magna sedan. This was<br />
unthinkable ten years ago, that these decisions should have been<br />
made. That's the reason why preference has been diminished in the<br />
Australian economy over the last ten years and in the doing of it a<br />
whole lot of clever industries and companies have sprung up. So,<br />
while there's a role for government purchasing as part of that<br />
preference in kicking a fledgling industry along, if we're basically down<br />
to products which are long beyond their infancy and certainly we've all </p>
<p>got to agree pneumatic tyres are in that category, then making a case<br />
for government purchasing is basically a bid for business and good on<br />
you. But, I've got a bigger set of considerations to think about.<br />
Q: ( inaudible)... something which was not qualified in the Budget is<br />
the government's attitude to superannuation and in particular the<br />
contributions for small and ( inaudible)... Could you give us some<br />
indication here as to what the government's view is on this issue in the<br />
future, because there is a lot of concern in that area as to what that<br />
attitude is in the future?<br />
PM: Well, let me, as an opener, say, " Where did the policy come from?"<br />
And the answer was superannuation tax concessions before 1985<br />
were available to people really only in the public sector and in the, if<br />
you like, the softer places in the private economy. They were not<br />
generally available. And, what we've succeeded in doing, as part of<br />
the Accord which the first questioner referred to is we've got the<br />
Australian workforce to take five per cent of their income as savings.<br />
And that will soon be six, then seven, then eight, then nine and then<br />
beyond that we'll have to decide how it gets to what we think the<br />
mature contribution is, which is around ten or 12.<br />
Now, it's a very great change to get a whole nation's workforce to take<br />
a significant percentage of their income as savings and not as cash.<br />
Because it builds national savings... ( inaudible)... it is very difficult to<br />
get a behavioural change in the way or the propensity of a country to<br />
save. And some countries are big savers, like Japan, that's why it<br />
always has a big current account surplus. The United States is a<br />
comparatively low saver so it has trouble with its trade accounts.<br />
We're a middle ranking saver but for the capital formation needs of<br />
Australia for its private investment we were not saving enough. And<br />
the public sector was using too much of the savings. So, in the 1980s<br />
we had the public sector dissave. We had the public sector move into<br />
a period of saving by pulling the Budget deficits into surplus and we're<br />
doing the same now.<br />
But, we needed a complement to private savings. Now, lower inflation<br />
will probably make private savings more palatable whereas the tax<br />
treatment of savings with higher inflation made saving less palatable.<br />
So that big behavioural change in inflation will make a difference to<br />
savings just by itself. But, other than that we've got superannuation,<br />
as a device which does two things: it provides something nearer to a<br />
working income in retirement through self provision and it adds to the<br />
stock of national savings. That's why the policy is there and we're now<br />
a long way through it. Now, it is universal but it's private and it's<br />
privately managed. There's not one big government fund, it's<br />
managed by the private savings institutions of this country and it's<br />
provided privately. </p>
<p>Now, because it's universal there's always going to be people who are<br />
casuals who slip in and out of the system. If they're not there for the<br />
long run employment and where the collation and tabulation of their<br />
savings and their superannuation benefits becomes more difficult.<br />
We've been examining that and, as you know, the banks have now<br />
made a bid for these savings ( inaudible).., of the superannuation<br />
industry is trying to hang on to that which they believe is theirs and this<br />
is something we are yet to determine. But, we think there is some<br />
difficulty with people moving in and out of these things and therefore<br />
some, more ready portability is something which would be desirable on<br />
all accounts on the part of the employee and the employer and the<br />
country. So, we haven't resolved precisely where that is going other<br />
than that the employers are obliged to fund those contributions under<br />
those Accord arrangements given the fact that all of those employees<br />
would otherwise be taking those contributions in higher wages. But, it<br />
is something which I think, when we sort it out and get it working well,<br />
will just add to the strength of superannuation as a vehicle in this<br />
country.<br />
Q: ( inaudible)..<br />
PM: Well, on the first, I think, you are confusing the point about the $ 1<br />
billion budget deficit and 1 per cent of GOP. The Government in ' One<br />
Nation' never talked about a $ 1 billion budget deficit ever. We talked<br />
about getting the Budget to a deficit of 1 per cent of GOP in 1995-96.<br />
But, then after the February 1992 ' One Nation' statement we had a<br />
further unforeseen deterioration in revenue and the Treasurer reported<br />
to us, I think, something like a $ 6 billion shift in revenue down. So, we<br />
put back by one year the 1 per cent of GOP target which is now at<br />
1996-97 and not 1995-96.<br />
Now, what the Budget said on Tuesday night is that we will now be<br />
within that 1 per cent target by 1996-97 and what we have in the<br />
Budget estimates now, is .9 of a per cent of GOP. So, if we don't do<br />
any better than where we are now, we believe we will be under 1 per<br />
cent of GOP by 1996-97.<br />
Now, the only other country in the world that will reduce its budget<br />
deficit that rapidly is Germany. All the other countries, let me just<br />
quote you from the Budget paper, the only other countries which are<br />
likely Germany, have got a target of 1 per cent by 1997; the US, 2.3<br />
per cent by 1998; France, 2.5 per cent by 1997; Italy, 5.8 per cent by<br />
1996; UK, 1.5 per cent by 1997-98 and Canada, 3 per cent by 1996-<br />
97. Australia in contrast will be at 1 per cent or under 1 per cent in<br />
1996-97.<br />
Remember I was talking earlier about the cushion. If the<br />
Commonwealth simply says, as some financial commentators, I might<br />
say non-discredited by the way, non-discredited, people have been </p>
<p>consistently wrong for nearly a decade and saying well, look, let's get<br />
the budget down to balance quicker. So, the Commonwealth says<br />
well, ok, let's rip the cushion out goes, a lot of the private sector<br />
investment we're seeing today. So, we are going to have a very rapid<br />
consolidation of the Commonwealth account, but it's got to be at a<br />
pace which keeps the thing going.<br />
You see, a lot of these people say the ' One Nation' thing, you know,<br />
remember that and the implication is there's something wrong with it<br />
and some of that implication you'll question. The fact is it did exactly<br />
what it said it would do. It got Australia going again and we're growing<br />
somewhere at the moment between 4 and 4.5 per cent faster than any<br />
other substantial western world economy. And that is happening<br />
because fiscal policy in the ' One Nation' package in particular and the<br />
current fiscal policy has been right. Now, in the last election we had<br />
John Hewson telling us we were going to have a double dip recession<br />
and a depression and things are going to get worse and he had the<br />
gun sight ads blowing the unemployed away. We've had 235,000 jobs<br />
in the last year and we're now, as I said, growing at over 4 per cent<br />
and we'll have the budget down to around 1 per cent of GDP by then.<br />
And, including paying the tax cuts which you referred to. These were<br />
brought forward and by some, I can't remember exactly, I think five or<br />
six months, a $ 3 billion round of tax cuts and we'll deliver on those tax<br />
cuts as we've delivered on every other round of tax cuts since the<br />
Accord. The first tax cuts were negotiated under the Accord of 1984<br />
and what we've said for the second round of the tax cuts, we've put<br />
things back we've brought the first lot forward, we but the second lot<br />
back and said that we'll pay them when fiscal conditions are<br />
appropriate probably in 1998.<br />
So, in terms of the Government's macroeconomic management of the<br />
economy, we have got back to growth, quite high growth, and with low<br />
inflation. I know of many other countries that would like to be in this<br />
position. Can I ju st say about Melbourne, you asked me about Melbourne. One<br />
of the things which the Committee for Melbourne has pressed on me<br />
for years is letting Melbourne develop itself its airport and we<br />
announced, my colleague Laurie Brereton announced here in<br />
Melbourne about 3 weeks ago, that in the White Paper, the regional<br />
development section of it, that we would start to prepare for sale the<br />
Federal Airports Corporation and sell off the assets. One of which will<br />
include Tullamarine airport. I think, that gives Melbourne a real<br />
chance to wind the capital it wants to wind into the airport and to see<br />
the thing grow and prosper. Qantas is going to be floated. Qantas<br />
will be, in this financial year, a private sector business. It will have<br />
per cent ownership of British Airways, it will be part of the British<br />
Airways world system. And Ansett is now an international carrier for<br />
the first time in its history as a consequence of the ' One Nation' </p>
<p>statement. In the ' One Nation' statement we took away the bunkum of<br />
having one airline flying outside of Australia and a couple flying in.<br />
We now have the similarities between domestic and international<br />
carriage of passengers. Now, Ansett is going to be flying to Japan and<br />
Bangkok and Singapore and other parts of the Asia-Pacific.<br />
Therefore, if Ansett and Qantas are both commercial companies and<br />
Melbourne has an unrestrained capacity to develop its airport and<br />
services, then, I think, it's then up the to the city, to the State to say to<br />
those companies there is value in having more frequencies out of here<br />
and it's not something then the Federal Government is responsible for.<br />
Not that we are now.<br />
So, I think, that giving Melbourne the status in its airport and seeing a<br />
couple of strong financial secure private sector airlines in this country<br />
should mean that a city with the promise and tradition of Melbourne<br />
and the state of Victoria should have no trouble later in attracting the<br />
kind of frequencies that can display Victoria to the world and not only<br />
that, as the kind of commercial intercourse which it needs to participate<br />
fully in the Australian economy.<br />
Q: Mr Prime Minister, as an Australian, I am staggered by your suggestion<br />
that you paid for Jeff Kennett's trams But as usual, we paid for those<br />
trams and Jeff Kennett's contribution ought to be recognised<br />
( inaudible)<br />
PM: I was only cracking a joke about Jeff being co-operative. The thing is<br />
the Commonwealth has many choices about where it wants to fund<br />
programs and one of the choices was into Victoria. Some of the<br />
smaller states that have less than the revenue base than the State of<br />
Victoria would say, that if there's any priorities for Commonwealth<br />
expenditure in transport or anywhere else it ought to be not in the<br />
major two States of Victoria and New South Wales. That has not been<br />
this Government's view. We have, therefore, sought to talk to<br />
Victorians about their State. I mean, this is where the conversation<br />
with the Committee for Melbourne has gone on for years now about the<br />
city, about the airport, and one of the things which I said in the speech<br />
is that they're also looking now to see what we can do to build the<br />
Domain tunnel.<br />
Now, let me tell you this. No other Commonwealth government would<br />
build a Domain tunnel. You wouldn't have had a Coalition build a<br />
Domain tunnel in the State and that's why I was making a reference, if<br />
only to the co-operation which, I think, the Commonwealth does<br />
have with the States and which, I think, is imperative in seeing cities<br />
realise their full potential. Because, if it refers to the State mean<br />
administering something like the Domain tunnel and managing the<br />
airport or doing things in the housing sector or the Commonwealth<br />
can play a role. Which, we believe, the Commonwealth should do. </p>
<p>8<br />
Where the traditional rule has been the Commonwealth is not into<br />
regional development, it's not into urban mainstream arterial roads, it's<br />
not into budget transport infrastructure, these are things which the<br />
States have traditionally had. We haven't taken that view.<br />
What I'm saying is: I don't want Jeffrey to put his name on the makers<br />
label of all of them, but to leave a bit of space for the rest of us.<br />
