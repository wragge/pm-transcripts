TRANSCRIPT OF THlE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
DOORSTOP, SEX DISCRIMINATION SEMINAR, PARLIAMENT HOUSE<br />
19 SEPTEMBER 1992<br />
E OE PROOF COPY<br />
PM: I can just say this is a real world response from one of the world's major<br />
motor companies to the unreal world policies of Dr Hcwson. Dr Hewson's<br />
had an absolute sleigh ride for the last year with one of the most brutal<br />
policy documents that's ever been proposed by an Australian political<br />
leader. But now it's coming under examination and people think it's not just<br />
a throw away manifesto but something that he actually wants to do. The<br />
major companies, like Ford, like Toyota, and others are looking at what the<br />
implications are, and what the Ford Motor Company are saying is that if<br />
Tariffs go to zero there'll be no further investment by Ford in Australia. That<br />
means no Falcon replacement. That means that cities like Gcelong and<br />
places like Broadmeadows will suffer accordingly as that investment flags.<br />
And the Toyota company has also made clear its view as have Mitsubishi on<br />
six hundred million dollars of investment in South Australia. So, the careful<br />
work that the Govcrnicnt put into establishing a set of policies for the<br />
motor industry are just being brushed to one sidc by Dr . Hewson, who ' has no<br />
icspectfor our work, or the fact that it was done co-operatively with<br />
business over a long period of time. And all Australians should note that the<br />
stridency is going to producc a lot of problems in Australia, and that's no<br />
less true for the motor industry.<br />
J: Isn't this just thc motor industry playing politics though prior to an elction?<br />
1O/ Od 900' ON SZ: OI Z6* daStZ:-131 </p>
<p>PM: No, no. The motor industry played its politics before the tariff cuts and<br />
changes were announced in 1991. That's when the politlaE,% e iplayed.<br />
What they're playing now is they're making clear they don't play out their<br />
death throes. Because at zero you don't have to be an economic genius to<br />
know this is true with production runs in Australia only about as high as<br />
40,000, when some of the production runs in the northern hemisphere are a<br />
quarter of a million or more, that a glut of cars in the northern hemisphere<br />
shipped into Australia at marginal prices will simply knock out the<br />
Australian motor vehicle industry. I mean it is not simply as the Opposition<br />
would have you believe the motor industry playing games, it's a reality.<br />
And that reality's going to be just as true in industrial relations as Dr<br />
Hewson's workplace reforms so-called pit one Australian against another.<br />
It's going to be just as true in health as they smash Medicare and push<br />
everybody back to private insurance. The fact is, this is a very strident,<br />
crude sort of capitalist type policy which i. had thought that Liberal leaders<br />
long ago had abandoned. But of course not so with Dr Hewson.<br />
J: Do you think that this will encourage the Opposition to change its policies<br />
to bring its tariff policies back in line with the Governmecnt?<br />
PM: Well, it's the Government which has had the courage to make all these<br />
structural changes and we're not going to bc running to the beat of Dr<br />
Hewson's drum, who's come into these subjects as some sort of dilettante,<br />
making declarations without consultation. Without knowing what makes a<br />
car company tick, without undcrstanding industrial relat ions. That sort of<br />
fanaticism, we're not going to have a bar of it. We're not going to be seeking<br />
any sort of bi-partisanship with him. Not on these things.<br />
