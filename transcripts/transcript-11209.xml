<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>First up this morning I'll be joined, and I think he is in the</p>
<p> studio in Canberra our sister station 2UE studio in Canberra, by the</p>
<p> Prime Minister. And he is in the centre of a row at the moment - he'll</p>
<p> wonder what I am talking about - it's a row over a desk, that</p>
<p> of the late Prime Minister Sir Robert Menzies which John Howard's</p>
<p> had moved into his Parliamentary House suite. The designer of the</p>
<p> modern desk it replaced has described the Prime Minister as [inaudible]</p>
<p> bankrupt. Dear oh dear. Well, before we go into weightier matters</p>
<p> the Prime Minister, I think, is on the line now. Good morning Prime</p>
<p> Minister.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good morning Howard.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Okay, what about this desk?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, for the benefit of your listeners it was moved into my office</p>
<p> a year ago so it's not something that has just happened. It wasn't</p>
<p> Sir Robert Menzies desk, it was the desk that was put into the Parliament</p>
<p> House when the temporary one was first built in 1927 and it was occupied</p>
<p> and used by every Australian Prime Minister from, I think, SM Bruce</p>
<p> in 1927 through to Gough Whitlam very briefly in 1972. And it was</p>
<p> obviously occupied and used by Bob Menzies but also by John Curtin</p>
<p> and by Ben Chifley and by John Gorton and all the Prime Ministers</p>
<p> that were there between 1927 and 1972. I would regard myself as being</p>
<p> historically sensitive in wanting to use this desk. I am not using</p>
<p> it because of some particular nostalgia about Sir Robert Menzies even</p>
<p> though I am immensely proud as a Liberal of the contribution that</p>
<p> he made to this country, I think he has been Australia's greatest</p>
<p> Prime Minister. But I am also conscious that it was used by John Curtin</p>
<p> and it would have been from that desk that John Curtin made many of</p>
<p> the important decisions that affected the deployment of Australian</p>
<p> forces during World War II....</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Yeah but you have got to be careful of these interior decorators,</p>
<p> they are a bit precious.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I think they are. I think we have got to get a sense of proportion</p>
<p> but the history of the office to me is more important than anything</p>
<p> else. And we need to treasure our history and surely a desk that has</p>
<p> been occupied, used by both Menzies and Curtin can hardly be regarded</p>
<p> as a Liberal Prime Minister's desk. Frankly I think some people</p>
<p> take themselves a little too seriously.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>All right. We'll get off that matter because it's not....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't think it...I really think that your listeners would</p>
<p> not see the point of.....</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>No, they don't care a hoot about the desk quite frankly but I</p>
<p> thought I'd ask anyway.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>You had to ask me I know.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Yeah, that's right. All right, let's talk about weightier</p>
<p> matters. What did cause the Government's about face over the</p>
<p> Kosovo refugees because we do know that initially you were rather</p>
<p> reluctant to actually bring them half way around the world to here,</p>
<p> what was it that changed the minds of yourself and the Cabinet?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I think it's a bit unfair to categorise this thing as,</p>
<p> sort of, a huge volte-face. Remember that it was only, I think, on</p>
<p> Monday that we first heard that NATO countries were going to take</p>
<p> refugees and by lunchtime on Tuesday, even though we are not a member</p>
<p> of NATO, we decided to take 4,000. So I really think this talk about</p>
<p> a belated response....</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Oh, I don't know the word is belated but....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look, people are....I mean, let's focus on the decency and</p>
<p> the substance of what has been decided rather than the nit-picking</p>
<p> observation that because the Minister responded within current policy</p>
<p> in some way we had an enormous change of heart. I mean, when this</p>
<p> crisis developed so rapidly over the weekend and on Monday when it</p>
<p> became apparent that other nations were going to take refugees I concluded</p>
<p> that it was a matter we would discuss at Cabinet.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>But was there one, sort of, vision that moved you particularly, I</p>
<p> mean, those pictures on television are just unbelievable?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Like any other Australian I am deeply moved by what I see every night.</p>
<p> I saw a lot of it during the day over the Easter period. I mean, it</p>
<p> is an awful human tragedy, it is appalling what is happening to these</p>
<p> people.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>But did you sit at home with your family and say, we have just got</p>
<p> to do something about it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Of course I talk to my family about it and of course I watch the images</p>
<p> and of course we discussed the human misery, of course we did.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>All right. Now, the problem now, and I think it might be is where</p>
<p> are we going to put them. There is some dissension around the place</p>
<p> about....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I think once again, once again people are, sort of, running</p>
<p> off at the mouth and getting excitable. Why don't we just, sort</p>
<p> of, calmly wait for a day or two. The arrangements, I can assure you,</p>
<p> are very well advanced. There has been a lot of work done in a very</p>
<p> speedy and efficient manner over the last 48 hours. It is an emergency.</p>
<p> When you have an emergency situation you have to respond in an ad-hoc</p>
<p> way and, I mean, there is no alternative. We didn't have a month's</p>
<p> notice of this. The decision was only taken on Tuesday and I expect</p>
<p> that my Immigration Minister will be able to say something in more</p>
<p> detail over the next few days.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Well, he told me on the programme yesterday that he wasn't opposed</p>
<p> to them filtering into the community. What do you think about that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, he is going to cover all of those things. Look, we want to do</p>
<p> a number of things. We obviously want to help and we said we can take</p>
<p> 4,000 people. You can't just overnight at the snap of the fingers</p>
<p> find 4,000 pieces of accommodation evenly spread throughout the entire</p>
<p> Australian community. It is obviously going to be necessary initially</p>
<p> for people to be received in a particular area. There will need to</p>
<p> be health checks made and so forth. And then there'll be a process</p>
<p> of people going to different parts of the country. Now, I would just</p>
<p> counsel people who are, sort of, conjuring up visions of refugees</p>
<p> being dumped in the desert. I'd just counsel those....</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Are you talking about Kim Beazley now are you?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I am talking about a number of people. Just sort of...they</p>
<p> should just slow down and give us a few days. I mean, it is really</p>
<p> the hide of unreasonableness to say to a government in response to</p>
<p> a likely need for refugees that only emerged a few days ago that took</p>
<p> a decision within 36 hours it is meant to have every answer 24 hours</p>
<p> later. I mean, that is the hide of unreasonableness and I think most</p>
<p> Australians and people listening to your programme would agree with</p>
<p> me. But the immigration people and the emergency relief people and</p>
<p> the health department people and foreign affairs have been working</p>
<p> overtime since the decision was taken.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>When do you expect the first people to arrive here?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, Mr Ruddock will have something to say about that over the next</p>
<p> few days but it won't be very long.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>I wondered what you also thought of some of the protest here against</p>
<p> NATO. We had one down at Fremantle last week where the USS Princeton</p>
<p> was visiting and one of the protesters went up to an Australian man</p>
<p> carrying an Australian flag and spat on it. What do you think about</p>
<p> that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I condemn that and Australians will condemn that.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Shouldn't that person be removed from this country?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, if he is an Australian citizen he has the same rights that you</p>
<p> and I have, that doesn't stop....</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Oh sorry, it was a woman by the way.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, she has the same right. I know a number of Australians of Serbian</p>
<p> descent who strongly disapprove of that kind of behaviour. I mean,</p>
<p> every Australian has the right of lawful protest, every Australian</p>
<p> who has got a family connection with another country has a perfect</p>
<p> right and it is an understandable human reaction to be concerned about</p>
<p> what is happening in that country. But when it goes to the extent</p>
<p> of breaking the law that is a different matter. When it goes to the</p>
<p> extent of demonstrating a greater concern for the other country then</p>
<p> the customs and the attitude of the Australian community it is another</p>
<p> matter and they rapidly lose sympathy. But by and large I think the</p>
<p> impact in Australia within different communities has been a lot more</p>
<p> muted and restrained and positive than some of us feared it might</p>
<p> be. And by and large most Australians of Serbian background see themselves</p>
<p> overwhelmingly as Australians first and foremost but having an interest</p>
<p> in what's happening in many cases their former homeland and that</p>
<p> is perfectly understandable. And our argument is with Milosevic it</p>
<p> is not with the Serbian people many of whom were magnificent allies</p>
<p> of the Allies in World War II.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Indeed. Right Prime Minister I want to take a break and then I want</p>
<p> to talk to you about a war much closer to home, the drugs war so we'll</p>
<p> return in just a moment.</p>
<p>[Commercial break]</p>
<p> You're with Howard Sattler and my guest, for his regular</p>
<p> segment on this programme, is the Prime Minister of Australia, John</p>
<p> Howard. Prime Minister, as I said, I wanted to talk to you about a</p>
<p> war much closer to home. It's a war that, in fact, spreads around</p>
<p> this globe but it's badly affecting us at the moment and tomorrow</p>
<p> you'll be meeting with our Premier and his counterparts on this</p>
<p> issue. In this morning's paper a funding row is being flagged.</p>
<p> Is the Government going to commit more funds to this fight than you've</p>
<p> already announced?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, there won't be any funding row on drugs. Heaven's</p>
<p> above.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>I'm only reading Â don't believe what you read then.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, you know, it's very dangerous sometimes. You know, the</p>
<p> old story, it must be right because you've read it in the papers.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Well it calls it a funding standoff over drugs.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh yes, I saw it, that's in The Australian, isn't</p>
<p> it?</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>That's right, yeah.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yeah, that was a rather ill informed interpretation of an interview</p>
<p> I did on radio yesterday into Brisbane. We will be putting some more</p>
<p> proposals on the table. I've already communicated the outline</p>
<p> of those proposals to the Premiers. It obviously involves the Commonwealth</p>
<p> offering more resources.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>More money.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, yes. We will be significantly increasing our financial commitment</p>
<p> and we'll be offering to fund areas that have previously been</p>
<p> the total responsibility of the State governments. So how in those</p>
<p> circumstances any reasonable Premier will be able to stand up and</p>
<p> say the Commonwealth is being unreasonable. Just let me, so we have</p>
<p> no misunderstanding, we will be making an offer tomorrow that involves</p>
<p> the provision of a lot more Federal money in the fight against drugs.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Than already announced.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Than already announced.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>All right. Now is that going to include national programmes in schools?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Part of it is education, yes.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Because I think you would agree a uniform approach to this is required.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>A largely uniform approach, yes. I mean, you obviously have to allow</p>
<p> for some local variations but if we're going to commit the money</p>
<p> we naturally want a say in what the programmes are. The idea of just</p>
<p> saying here's a cheque, you do what you like with it Â no,</p>
<p> we don't agree with that. But we do believe that more effort</p>
<p> is needed. We have a three pronged approach. We need to do more in</p>
<p> education. We need to do more in law enforcement. And we need to do</p>
<p> more in providing treatment for those who want to break their addiction.</p>
<p> Now, we've already committed an additional $290 million in our</p>
<p> ÂTough on Drugs' programme. That, for example, has resulted</p>
<p> in two additional strike teams in Western Australia. That's something</p>
<p> I know the Western Australian Premier is very pleased about because</p>
<p> he's been campaigning for that for some time.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Well, we're pretty exposed over here.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>You are and that is understood. And we've put a lot more resources</p>
<p> into customs and the Federal Police already. And what I'm going</p>
<p> to put on the table tomorrow will be more resources over-and-above</p>
<p> what is already in the field. So I don't want there to be any</p>
<p> misunderstanding. We're not putting and taking. We're not</p>
<p> robbing Peter to pay Paul. We will be putting forward to the Premiers</p>
<p> tomorrow some new proposals consistent with and building upon the</p>
<p> approach we've already had but they will involve significant</p>
<p> additional money from the Federal Government.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>All right. Now, how does $100 million sound, is that pretty close</p>
<p> to the mark?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh look, I'm not going to start talking about individual figures.</p>
<p> But there will be significant additional resources and some new approaches.</p>
<p> And I hope in the generally bipartisan approach that has characterised</p>
<p> this issue we'll have the support of the States. I mean, it would</p>
<p> surprise me if a proposal where we're willing to put a lot more</p>
<p> money into, that the States wouldn't be willing to pick it up.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>All right. So the headline should have said, Premier says there is</p>
<p> a deal coming up on drug funding, not a 'no' deal Â that's</p>
<p> what it says.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I just don't know where that headline came from. I mean,</p>
<p> the position is that I have sent to the Premiers and Chief Ministers</p>
<p> the outline of what we're going to have on the table tomorrow.</p>
<p> It does involve some new initiatives but they're consistent with</p>
<p> the approach we've already taken and we are prepared to support</p>
<p> that with significant additional Federal cash.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>All right. Now, another report this morning suggests the Government's</p>
<p> about to make a concession on the goods and services and tax reform</p>
<p> bills with $200 million offered to the States for public housing.</p>
<p> Can you confirm that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No. No, I'm not sure Â I know what they're broadly</p>
<p> referring to but I'm not sure where they got the idea that we're</p>
<p> going to make major concessions. Can I say the big news today on the</p>
<p> GST is that the Senate has just had a report from Neil Warren and</p>
<p> Anne Harding, the two people who were touted by the Labor Party as</p>
<p> likely to blow our plan out of the water. And Neil Warren and Anne</p>
<p> Harding have both said that food should stay in. And they've</p>
<p> also said that on any plausible assumption, reasonable assumption,</p>
<p> there aren't any losers. Now, we have for months and months been</p>
<p> told by the Labor Party that when it comes to experts on the GST there</p>
<p> is none better in the country than Neil Warren. And I acknowledge</p>
<p> that he's quite an expert. And I also acknowledge that he's</p>
<p> been quoted with approval by both sides of politics over the years.</p>
<p> And what he's said this morning is that food should stay in Â</p>
<p> ÂI' ÂN'.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Have you rung Senator Brian Harradine to make sure he's read</p>
<p> that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I haven't rung any Senators this morning. I've been too</p>
<p> busy talking to you.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>He's the man you need to convince, isn't he?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, he's very important.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>He's the key.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>But he's a reasonable man.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Okay, you hope.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>He's always a reasonable man.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>I mean, if you just don't get this thing past him what do you</p>
<p> do then?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, let's take things as they come. I'm positive, I've</p>
<p> always been positive about this because in the end I believe that</p>
<p> the will of the Australian people will prevail. And the Australian</p>
<p> people said yes to our tax plan last October and I don't think</p>
<p> the Australian people will easily forget a Labor Party and a Democrat</p>
<p> Party that blocks their freely expressed will.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Yeah, well, you're not surely thinking that this report, that</p>
<p> they will move any of those people.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
