PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS FEBRUARY 29, 1976<br />
THE IRAQI INVESTIGATION<br />
As a result of inconsistencies in statements about the purpose<br />
of the visit made by two I. raqis who came to Australia on 8<br />
D'ecember and in view of the allegations that large sums of money<br />
were brought into Australia, I announced in Parliament that<br />
inquiries had beeni instituted.<br />
These inquiries are being conducted by the Commonwealth Police.<br />
No directions have been given to the police about the manner in<br />
which they are to conduct their inquiries which I am advised are<br />
proceeding in a normal fashion at the discretion of the investigating<br />
officers. I am advised that the decision to call in the diaries was the<br />
decision of the police.<br />
I have had no reports from the police since they began their<br />
inquiries. I have not seen the diaries kept by the police escort<br />
squad assigned to Mr Whitlam. Nor have I asked for them.<br />
When the inquiry is complete A report will go to the law officers<br />
who will report to me.<br />
If Mr Whitjlam wishes to refresh his memory about certain of his<br />
movements I would have no-objection to his being shown the records<br />
kept by the police escort squad. That is a matter he should take<br />
up with the police. I would certainly not stand in the way of<br />
his being shown these records. </p>
