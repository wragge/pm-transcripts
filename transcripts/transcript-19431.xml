<p>Rob Oakeshott is a man of energy and ideas whose fundamental optimism for Australia endears him to almost everyone who knows him. </p>
<p>Rob served ten years in the New South Wales Parliament and five years in the Parliament of Australia. He is still a young man with a young family and I know how much he is looking forward to being at home.</p>
<p>Rob Oakeshott has been widely recognised for the passion of his advocacy for improvement in education. He has worked tirelessly to spread the benefits of our strong economy through investment in regional Australia.</p>
<p>The national debate on climate change was enriched by the perspective Rob brought to carbon, soil and water issues. He can point to a number of specific achievements reflected in the Clean Energy Future legislation which passed the Parliament during this term.</p>
<p>Rob smiles easily and wears his heart on his sleeve and politics could do with more of that, not less. I know he and Sarah-Jane are looking forward to the next phase of life together.</p>
