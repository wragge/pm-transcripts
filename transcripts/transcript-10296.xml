1 April 1997 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON. JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
OPENING OF THE AUSTRALIAN STOCK EXCHANGE!<br />
CHINA SECURITIES REGULATORY COMMISSION SYMPOSIUM<br />
BEIJING, CHINA<br />
E O E<br />
Thank you very much Maurice Newman, the Chairman of the Australian Stock Exchange, to<br />
the Minister for Metallurgical Industry, Mr Liu Qi, other distinguished guests, ladies and<br />
gentlemen. May I say how particularly pleased I am to open this very important seminar. Can I<br />
congratulate the Australian Stock Exchange and all of those associated in putting this seminar<br />
together. I suppose when you think about the market system, when you think about free<br />
economies, nothing quite expresses in a more robust and uncomplicated way a market<br />
approach to economic management than a stock exchange.<br />
It's impossible to conceive what has become known as the market economy or the market<br />
economies of the world without thinking of stock exchanges. Because it is through stock<br />
exchanges that equities are traded, capital is raised and judgments are made about the<br />
strengths and the future prospects of companies and the stock exchanges of the world are an<br />
indispensable, indeed a crucial element of the increasingly globalised economy in which we all<br />
live. And when in 1978 the late Deng Xiao Ping began the great opening of the Chinese<br />
economy, it was inevitable over time that that opening would embrace a greater concentration<br />
on the role of stock exchanges in the economy of China and ultimately, of course, the listing of<br />
Chinese securities and companies on the stock exchanges of the world. And that is why I'm<br />
so delighted that this seminar brings the Australian Stock Exchange and the people who run it<br />
and advise it and the China Securities Regulatory Commission, and I particularly welcome the<br />
presence of its Chairman with us today. We had a very brief but lively discussion about the<br />
role of his Commission and the interaction of such commissions with the Stock Exchanges<br />
both of China and of Australia. </p>
<p>This seminar will be an excellent opportunity for Chinese delegates and our Chinese guests to<br />
gain an understanding not only of the listing requirements and the intricacies of the Australian<br />
Stock Exchange but also the vast array of services that are associated with the operations of<br />
securities markets in Australia.<br />
The Australian Stock Exchange is a very sophisticated operation. It has a high reputation for<br />
integrity. It also, I think today, celebrates its I10th birthday as a national exchange having<br />
years ago brought together the individual State exchanges of Australia that operated for so<br />
long. It has great advantages for Chinese companies, it operates in roughly the same time<br />
zone as Beijing. It's electronic trading system is at the leading edge. It's surveillance system<br />
and company recording requirements are outstanding and of course it has particular expertise<br />
in areas such as mining and construction and building, industry and engineering which is of<br />
such great and ongoing importance to Chinese companies and Chinese investors.<br />
Associated with this seminar are representatives of many of the large and reputable legal and<br />
accounting firms of Australia and as you move amongst the delegates from Australia, our<br />
Chinese guests will meet representatives of what are household names in the legal and<br />
accounting professions in Australia. And once again, in that area we bring services that have<br />
high reputations in Australia, they are of world class professional capacity and they are part of<br />
the very, very deep layers of professional services available to investors in Australia.<br />
This is another occasion in which I want to emphasise the partnership between the Australian<br />
government and the business community of Australia in interacting with the Chinese<br />
government and the business men and women of China.<br />
I have brought with me on this trip to China a very strong delegation of business men and<br />
women. In fact it's the strongest and most senior business delegation ever to accompany an<br />
Australian Prime Minister abroad and that has happened quite deliberately because of my belief<br />
and my government's belief that in our dealings with China it is important to emphasise that<br />
we and the business community are doing it together. That doesn't mean that our<br />
predisposition in Australia towards allowing the business community freedom to make its own<br />
decisions and to reduce the burden of government regulation on business has in any way<br />
changed. But it is a recognition that in dealing with China it is important for the government<br />
and the business community to work together.<br />
Can I say to our Chinese guests and the participants in this seminar that the process of<br />
economic change and reform is moving very dramatically in your country and although the<br />
rate of change in Australia, by definition, is no where near is as great because the base from<br />
which we have started is different, there is nonetheless an ongoing process of economic<br />
change and reform. One of the things that my government will address in the next few weeks,<br />
after my return to Australia is an examination of the Wallis Committee Report into the<br />
Australian financial system.<br />
About 17 years ago when I was Treasurer in the Australian government we received the<br />
Campbell Report which ultimately led to the greatest changes in the financial system that<br />
Australia has seen, the introduction of foreign banks, the floating of the Australian dollar and<br />
general deregulation. May I say that it was a policy approach I'm pleased to remark was<br />
embraced by both sides of politics in Australian and I have never been reluctant to give my<br />
predecessor as Prime Minister credit for the work that he did in implementing that particular </p>
<p>report. The Wallis Committee Inquiry is in some respects an update, a stocktaking of what<br />
has happened to the Australian financial system since the implementation of the Campbell<br />
Report and we will be taking some decisions on that Report in terms of a statement of how<br />
we're going to handle it already made by the Treasurer. But I mention it ladies and gentlemen<br />
to simply underline the fact that although we have a very modern and sophisticated and<br />
thoroughly integrated financial system which is part of the globalised economy in which we all<br />
now live, the process of change, surveillance and review must always go on.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen I therefore have enormous pleasure in declaring this seminar open. I<br />
congratulate again the Australian Stock Exchange and particularly it's Chairman, Mr Maurice<br />
Newman, who has not only made a great contribution to the Australian business community as<br />
Chairman of the Australian Stock Exchange and his other professional pursuits but he has<br />
made an extremely thoughtful contribution over many years to the ongoing policy debate<br />
within Australia about economic matters and he's been one of the strongest and most<br />
persistent voices in favour of a deregulatory market approach to the management of the<br />
Australian economy. And in a society such as Australia debates on those sorts of issues go on<br />
endlessly and it is always important to have loud and strong voices in favour of an intelligent<br />
approach to economic management.<br />
So ladies and gentlemen I have enormous pleasure in declaring this seminar open. I hope that<br />
all of our Chinese delegates here today derive great benefits from it. All of you will be very<br />
welcome participants on the Australian Stock Exchange. I can assure you of a ready but of<br />
course necessarily professional and critical appraisal of your offerings and if you do decide to<br />
list you will be listing on an exchange which has impeccable world wide credentials, is<br />
conducted with enormous integrity and whose operations are underpinned by highly qualified<br />
brokers, financial advisers, lawyers and accountants.<br />
I declare this seminar open. Thank you<br />
Ends </p>
