N. S. W. CHAMBER OF MANUFACTURES ANNUAL Dli'INER<br />
SYDNEY, NSW -AUGUST 1970<br />
Ãµ ! ech by the Prime Minister, Mr. 12ohn Gorton<br />
Mr. President and Gentlemen:<br />
Sir, the Budget will be presented in less than two wee.' s, and so I think it<br />
would be as well for me to start this address with a disclaimer. Because anything a<br />
Minister or a Prime Minister says at such a time is liable to analysis and dissection<br />
and distortion by the gentlemen of the Press: I wish to make it clear right now that<br />
this will not be a profitable exercise because anything I say to you tonight in general<br />
terms is not to be translated into specifics by way of guessing at what the Budget might<br />
contain. And those gentlemen whose speculation is sometimes inclined to be high, wide<br />
and handsome, would do better to wait patiently a few more days when they can have the<br />
satisfaction of commenting on facts instead of on suppositions. And that is the disclaimer<br />
I want to make right at the start.<br />
It is a difficult thing to talk to you tonight so close to the Budget because it IS<br />
so close to the Budget.<br />
Sir, having said that, I thank you tor your welcome here tonight, and I am<br />
glad to be here because it gives me the opportunity to express my respect and I do<br />
have that respect for the manufacturing industry which employs some 28% of the<br />
Australian work force directly and a further 20% 7 of the Australian work force indirectly<br />
in servicing the needs of manufacturing industry. Those industriec which have raised<br />
the value of the output from factories in Australia from about 030 million just<br />
before the Second World War, to $ 17, 000 million today a very signif icant increase<br />
as you will agree. Industries which have raised their contribution to our export income from<br />
$ 198 million or 11% of total exports ten years ago to $ 782 million or 19. 7% of total<br />
exports today again a very significant contribution, showing that manufacturing<br />
industry along with minerals and rural industry has become one of the big three<br />
contributing to Australia's growth and wealth. This is something, I think, of which<br />
you can all, looking back on the sixties, looking back on the plans you have made,<br />
now looking at the fruition of those plans, be proud. But that is in the past.<br />
As we look ahead, what do we see? We see great problems to be overcome<br />
in our rural industries, many of which are beset by falling world prices and harassed<br />
at the moment by the ravages of drought, yet industries which ha ve managed in the<br />
year just past to increase export earnings by some $ 200 million over the year before.<br />
But on other fronts, we see great opportunities for new growth and for<br />
greater economic strength. Our overseas balances are healthy and they should become<br />
even healthier as the output of minerals increases, as it undoubtedly will, and as the<br />
value of that output for export is further increased by the processing within Australia<br />
which will take place so that we will be exporting ingots instead o! earth. </p>
<p>And our balances will im prove further as import replacement grows, as it<br />
will, for example, in oil ( which I was delighted to see the " Financial Review" agreed<br />
was going to be sold in Australia at a price at least as good as it could be bought from<br />
abroad and possibly better. Now this again will increase our surplus of exports<br />
over imports. Other contributions will be the application of new and vigorous management<br />
techniques which is up to you gentlemen in secondary industry, by the extension<br />
of the amount industry spends on research, which is up to you gentlemen in secondary<br />
industry, because the Government in Australia provides a greater proportion of the<br />
amount spent on research in industry than does the government inI any other country;<br />
by the increased use of automation these will all increase the value of output per<br />
man hour. Added to that the measures already taken by the Government will, I believe,<br />
retain in Australian ownership a greater proportion of that expanding industry and<br />
therefore retain inside Australia a greater degree of the profits ofL that expanding<br />
industry. So the barometer of future progress and of future economic growth stands<br />
really at " set fair"', subject to what I now have to say. Because wihat I have said only<br />
means that great growth and great progress can be made,, it does riot necessarily<br />
mean it will be made. It can be slowed, or even halted should we find inflation growin g<br />
faster than that of the countries with which we trade and to which we must sell at<br />
world prices. And in particular the significant growth and contribuition of secondary<br />
industry to cur exports could be badly affected if this happened.<br />
Sir, in Australia governments can take action on thiS front, but in Australia<br />
decisions of the Arbitration Court have an enormous effect on the economny generally,<br />
no matter what a government does. If wages are increased without regard to increased<br />
overall production, then there will be benefit for none, and ultimately detriment for all.<br />
We could be priced out of the export markets we have won. The demands of the<br />
community for more sclools, more hospitals, more roads, more defence and more<br />
public development may not be met. And the increased wages to the individual will<br />
not in the end buy more to take home. They will indeed be fool's gold.<br />
And as a by-product, the rural industries and the fixed income-earners will<br />
be the greatest sufferers in the community, and the threat of that happening is the<br />
only zhreat which I can see to our achieving that growth and that progress of which I spoke<br />
and which is within our grasp.<br />
Now if we are to achieve the destiny which is ours to attain, there is a heavy<br />
responsibility not only on government, but also on trade union leaders and on the<br />
Arbitration Court to see that industry is not called upon to pay in wages sums which<br />
represent more than the value of what industry can produce. AnLd, conversely, if the<br />
overall growth of industries, which is possible, occurs, if the value of production per<br />
man-hour increases, as it can under good management, there will be a corresponding<br />
responsibility then on trade union leaders, on the Arbitration Court, and on<br />
employers to see that that overall increase results in increased rewards for the labour<br />
force in Australia. / 3 </p>
<p>We are, as a government, aware of both these facts, and because we are<br />
aware of th-em, we propose to intervene in the oil industry case shortly to come before<br />
the Arbitration Court. And there we propose to argue that it would be disastrous for<br />
Australia if the principles previously accepted were reversed, and if it was thQught<br />
that an tndustry which was profitable or a company which was profitable should, because<br />
it was profitable, be called upon to pay more than industry generally could pay to<br />
those who worked for it.<br />
For if this were to be accepted in the case of those industries which are,<br />
for one reason or another, fully profitable, then what would happen to those industries<br />
such as the railways, the electricity supplies, the industries run by governments which<br />
almost by definition are not profitable, or the industries run by some sections of<br />
private enterprise which are sometimes not as profitable'<br />
There would be no incentive for labour to serve in theSe industries, and<br />
either they would be starved of labour or the community as a whole would have to make<br />
up to an unprofitable industry wage standards which a proffitable industry alone could<br />
meet and that in turn would lead to the inflation which is the only threat I see to the<br />
progress of this country.<br />
Sir, if we can achieve in this nation, with good faith and with commonsense<br />
on all sides, an agreement that only when productivity increases can wages be increased,<br />
then there is a real prospect of increasing prosperity for the individual and for<br />
manufacturing industry. And there will be an increasing capacity for governments to<br />
provide those public services and amenities which the nation requires and which<br />
governments can only supply if industry provides the wealth for governments to tax<br />
in order to supply those services:<br />
I am sure that this can best be attained by and through the arbitration<br />
and conciliation system as we have it today. I believe we should reject 1 0se talk of<br />
finding something better than that system which we have had for so long, of going into<br />
collective bargaining, of picking off one industry after another, or one section of<br />
industry after another by industrial blackmail. And I believe, too, that nothing in the<br />
long run would be more damaging to the cause of organised labour and to the stability<br />
of industry and commerce in Australia than to reject or replace an arbitration system<br />
which, if it Is to be fully effective, must have the ultimate capacity to apply teeth in its<br />
judgments. An Arbitration Court, acting impartially, seen to be independent in its<br />
judgments, seen to be uninfluenced by either trade union leaders or: employers'<br />
representatives, and acting only on what it sees to be the merits of a case after that<br />
case has been presented in the Court, is niot perfect, but it is the bast method of<br />
ensuring fairness that has yet been devised. And provided it act.-on all those criteria<br />
I have set out, it is the best method of attaining the confidence both of employers and<br />
of labour. Sir, by the end of this year, the Liberal,/ Country Party Coalition will have<br />
beet, in office twenty-one years, and in any other audience but this, at that stage there<br />
would have been a call of " too long": They have been years of solid progress in / 4 </p>
<p>government, in government enter i-rises and in private enterprises, and much of what I<br />
said at the beginning of this speech of the achievements of industry in Australia, has<br />
been made possible by the climate created in that time by those governments.<br />
Our population in that time has passed from 8 million to 13 million.. Our<br />
labour force is fully employed. Our economic base has been broadening tremendously.<br />
Our export trade is expanding. Our living standards, including our care for the aged,<br />
the ill and the needy, have been improved. We. grow stronger in defence, and we have<br />
honoured our international obligations in three conflicts KLorea, Malaya and Vietnam.<br />
We have a new understanding of our regional involvement through our M4ole Australian<br />
community. We see our destiny as being shaped by the course of events in South-East<br />
Asia and the Pacific, and we are actively sharing in many activities kh ich will determine<br />
how straight and true that course will be and where it will lead us as an ultimate goal.<br />
All this you have achieved we have achieved. And in all this we are still<br />
concerned, as jointly we make our way through these exciting 1970' s, and all this in<br />
a sense depends on government action. But in turn that governme-nt action depends on<br />
the wealth pi1oduced by all the enterprises in Australia. The main elements of growth,<br />
the numbers in the work force and what they produce are strong, thianks to immigration<br />
and to improving technology and other factors. And this has giver:. us, in the non-farm<br />
factor, and average growth in the area in, which you are concerned, gentlemen, an<br />
average growth of more than 6 per cent at constant prices in recent years.<br />
I think our immigration programme has been a great success. I think<br />
without it we would be a poorer country, very hard pressed for labour, limited in our<br />
expansion and inhibited in our planning. We have to reme-mber that while that programme<br />
is costly arid initially inflationary because the new immigrant calls for more from the<br />
community, narticularly if he has a family, than he can initially -provide to the<br />
community, yet that increasing work force is made up of people who have not been reared<br />
and educated at our expense, but at the expense of the countries from which they come.<br />
And that is an off setting value to us of millions of dollars for a start.<br />
We have recently decided, as you know, to have a comprehensive review<br />
made of all aspects of our immigration programme to see how best it will fit our<br />
changing needs in terms of economic growth and social and cultural diversification. But<br />
I want to say to you tonight that is not in any way to question the n~ eed for continuing<br />
immigration. We must continue to have a high intake in the seventies, no matter what<br />
bank brings out a statement querying the value of it.<br />
But I think it is sensible to take a loo~ k in depth at the progress and the<br />
results of the scheme since it began soon after the end of World V'a r 11, to learn<br />
whether and how we can improve the contribution which migrants make, to learn<br />
whether and how vie can retain in this country a greater number of the migrants who<br />
come here, and to learn whether and how we can reduce the initial inflationary costs<br />
as the migrants come. And this is the sole objective of this examination. 0 </p>
<p>In the years ahead, we face great changes, arid some them indeed will be<br />
of considerable magnitude to this nation if Britain, for example, goes into the Common<br />
Market. But we can take up a continuing challenge to become increasingly strong<br />
industrially, to extend the extraction of the raw wealth from our coil into integrated<br />
industries which embrace processing and manufacturing, and to reconstruct some of<br />
those industries on an econompic basis which, at the moment may riot be fully economically<br />
viable. We must manufacture more of the things we now imrn. t. We must export<br />
more of the things we now make in Australia. I do appeal to you not to rest upon your<br />
laurels, not to say because in the last year we have increased our exports of manufactured<br />
products so much, not to say because we are now contributing nearly 20 per cent of<br />
exports, tb-erefore we should do no more. Thbis is not so. For every individual in this<br />
room, there is an opportunity to improve and increase the exports from manufacturing<br />
industries we now have. To do it either directly, or by joint ventures in other countries,<br />
so that raw materials go from Australia, manufacturing is done abroad, but Australians<br />
are part of the manufacturing done abroad and draw their profits from it, for that is<br />
export too. This is something you must do in this decade of the seventies, and I believe<br />
you are headed that way, but I believe that this and progress inside our own country<br />
can only occur if we keep the free enterprise system Intact and if vie maim am the climate<br />
that has led to the growth in the last twenty years. For the upward trend is twenty years<br />
old, and the concept of government working with industry, of the -public sector and the<br />
private sector living together, and of one not trying to destroy the other has, I think,<br />
been the foundation of the progress we have made and cari be the orly foundation if we<br />
are to makL-e progress in the future.<br />
There are a r~ umber of pitfalls about one I mentioned. But another is the<br />
concept described as socialism. What is socialism? It is. not social action by a government<br />
because if it were, then it would be wrong for a government to provide toads or<br />
dams or irrigation services or electricity services or any of the multitudinous things<br />
governments provide without question. It is not governmental partnership with private<br />
enteiprise because if it was then it would be wrong for the governnlent to have provided<br />
the millions of dollars that it has provided to help private enterprise develop and<br />
secondary industry develop.<br />
But what it is and where it is wrong is when it seeks to say, as it did years<br />
ago to some people " You must not engage in banking. You must not engage in some<br />
field of enterprise because the Government will not allow you to do so. That is<br />
clearly wrong. It is wrong, I think, when it seeks to place limitations on proper<br />
rewards for hard work or new inventions or the proper running of an industry, and price<br />
control that great panacea of socialism is in fact, when you boil it down, seeking to<br />
provide profit control no matter whether the person making the profits is making a<br />
cheaper good and selling it cheaper, but making profits as a result of it. That is wrong. / 6 </p>
<p>And its intrusion into planning is also wrong.<br />
Treasury Bulletin called " The Australian Economy 1970",<br />
in this paper says this. It speaks of the chances we have,<br />
some of the difficulties we face, and it says I have here before me a<br />
and the very last sentence<br />
the opportunities we have,<br />
" This is a problem for Government policy, but within<br />
the framework of such policy, the outcome will be<br />
determined by judgments formed, decisions made and<br />
initiatives taken at innumerable points throughout<br />
the economy."<br />
And that is private enterprise, and that is what we must retain the chance for<br />
judgments to be made, for decisions to be made, for initiatives to be taken Mi thout<br />
instructions or control from governments on those who have to take those decisions.<br />
That is a definition of private enterprise. That we propose to defend. I believe that by<br />
defending it you will have the greatest opportunities to advance the interests of this<br />
nation and I am sure that you will take advantage of those opportunities and of the<br />
climate we propose to provide in the future as you have in the past.<br />
That is why I propose the toast<br />
Australian Industry. </p>
