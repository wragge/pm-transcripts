SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER THE RT. HON. R. G*<br />
MENZIES AT CRANIBROOK SCHOOL 6N SATURDAY,<br />
DECEMBER. 1960<br />
I call this a " softening up" process. I stand up here.<br />
shaking hands for a long time, handing out prizes, with all the<br />
gusto of a politician giving things away ( Laughter) and when<br />
they have just about reduced me to a state of weakness, then a<br />
man who used to be my friend, Sir Kenneth Street, gets up quite<br />
blithely and says, " Now, make a speech". ( Laughter)<br />
As a matter of fact before I begin to make a very<br />
sh~ ort speech I think I ought to tell you that I formed the<br />
highest admiration for the Headmaster. He took a risk today<br />
that I wouldn't have dreamed of taking after 30 odd years in<br />
politics. He said " If anybody can't hear Lie, will ho hold up<br />
his hand". ( Laughter) The last politician who was rreen enough.<br />
to do that had a man hold up his hand whereupon a fellow in the<br />
front seat, you remember? turned around and said " I'll change<br />
places with you willingly". ( Laughter, applause3<br />
I was also of course, delighted to find that in a<br />
progressive school ol this kind, which, judg. ing by the books<br />
that I've been handing out, embraces judo among its<br />
accomplishments, I was delighted to find that there was to be a<br />
course in " Elementary Russian".<br />
Now, as a matter of fact, if you want any assistance,<br />
on a voluntary basis, on that matter I'm prepared to offer it.<br />
I am a master of elem~ entary Russian ? Laughter, applause) You<br />
see, not for the first time the audience is ahead of me,<br />
because what I was gping to say was I am a ritor of elementary<br />
Russian punctuatiin it is done w ith the sole of your shoe.<br />
( Laughter, applause) I hand on that secret to you.<br />
Now, for anybody who has himself been talked into<br />
making aspeech at a school Speech Day, there is always a rather<br />
grim choice to be resolved. Should I talk to the parents? In<br />
which case the boys, if they have any sense, will be bored<br />
stiff. Or, should I talk to the boys whose minds are more<br />
receptive than those of most audiences I speak to, ( Laughter)<br />
and leave the parents alone?<br />
VJell I'm going to say just a few words to the boys on<br />
the principle, the well-established principle, that except for<br />
a few shining exceptions, who will identify themselves without<br />
difficulty, the parents here today are practically beyond<br />
redemption. Their minds are made up about all sorts of<br />
things; but the boys well they asIiagehtligt<br />
entertain an idea or two., asIaybewligt<br />
I have always sympathised with boys at a School Speech<br />
Day. Just toward the end I gave some learned fellow, whose name<br />
I now regret to say I don't recall, the prize for Latin and<br />
French, and I would have you know I'll say this to the<br />
parents, some of whom may have a disregard for my intell ' ectual<br />
capacities that was the last prize I got at School too,<br />
( Laughter) Latin and Fronch I still retain a few b) roken<br />
shards of each of these languages one dead, and now deaderthe<br />
other alive, but strangely pronounced in its own countryl<br />
But my deepest sym. pathy ! ns always -bo-en for-thec poor<br />
chaps who have to sit thcrc, as wec all did I'm talking about<br />
the mean today in our time, when some ponderous old<br />
platitudinous politician came along and made a speech and said, </p>
<p>" Boys, these are the happiest days of your life. You must make<br />
the mott of your school days because when they are over, and you<br />
come out into the hard cold world you will have to forget all<br />
this-stuff you have been learning at school, and learn the hard<br />
facts of life". ( Laughter)<br />
Well I used to listen to these chaps for a few<br />
minutes and then yawn, and then go to sleep. And it shows,-Sir,<br />
how the habits of youth can persist when I tell you that that is<br />
exactly what I do in Parliament at the end of the Session.<br />
( Laughter, applause)<br />
But could I just offer an obsorvation to ry friends<br />
over here on two or throG, or perhaps four matters not one of<br />
which will take me long, because I see the stumps arc up and<br />
light is shining brightly.<br />
What are the -reat things, the great virtues that we<br />
ought to achieve when we are at school? Because if we don't<br />
achieve then then, our prospect of achieving them thereafter are<br />
not as good as they might be.<br />
I think one of the virtues is what I will call<br />
" Pride". I know, Headmaster pride is supposed to be one of the<br />
deadly sins. But pride in the sense of a proper self-respect,<br />
a determination to do your own work, and to play your own play,<br />
and to stand on your own feet this is one of the great<br />
qualities in mankind. Nobody knows it better than a man who has<br />
been engaged, fairly responsibly most of the time, in public<br />
affairs. So many people in the world don't start with their<br />
self-respect, or their self-help, but make their first port of<br />
call the Government, which is only another way of saying that<br />
they want other people, through the Government, to do their<br />
work for them. This is a great point with me. It is a great quality<br />
to be independent, for a man to have a proper pride, and to say<br />
" If I can do this myself I'm going to do it myself. And it is<br />
only if I can't do it myself that I must call on other people,<br />
if I have a chance, to help me to do it".<br />
Pride is not to be confused with vanity. There is<br />
nothing sillier than vanity; and vanity brings about its own<br />
downfall every day of the week, or, as we say, every tick of the<br />
clock. But pride, in the true sense is a great virtue. I say<br />
get it; and stick to it.<br />
Then of course you most of you I would have hoped<br />
all of you have read J. M. Barrie's famous rectorial address at<br />
St. Andrew's University a remarkable speech which ought to be<br />
read by every thoughtful person at least once a year.<br />
The theme of Barrie's address was courage. I had the<br />
great privilege, years afterwards, of walking up and down in a<br />
garden in the west of England for an hour with J. M. Barrie<br />
discussing this speech, and how he had gone about making it.<br />
His theme was courage, the lovely virtue, as he called<br />
it, the virtue without which other virtues can be broken into<br />
the dust. Now we can think about courage in many ways. The<br />
rarest form ofcourage, I think, in the world, is moral courage.<br />
The courage that a man has when he is prepared to form his view<br />
of the truth and to pursue it, when he is not running around<br />
the corner every five minutes to say, " Is this going to be </p>
<p>3.<br />
popular?" Not like the traditional old politician of fiction<br />
who said, " Find out what the people want, and that is my<br />
policy". Cmurage is very im~ portant, all important. But of<br />
course it is no use becoming addicted to sticking to your own<br />
view unless you have taken all the preliminary steps to do your<br />
best to see that it is the right view. Courage without work,<br />
courage without thought, courage without judgment will not be<br />
worth so much. It might ultimately am~ ount to mere obstinacy.<br />
But properly considered and properly set, it is one of the great<br />
virtues. There arc two things could talk about a dozen<br />
which perhaps are not very much respected now-a-days. They are<br />
at the other end of the scale, I grant you.<br />
One is to have good manners, courtesy. One becomes<br />
dejected occasionally at the-decline in glood manners. Why is it<br />
thought by so many people that to be strong, you must be rude?<br />
That to demonstrate that you have a mind of your own you must<br />
engage in the most ' Drutal discourtesy to other people? ' Manners<br />
maketh man' is one of the oldest of the old school mottos. And<br />
although, of course, it g ' oes deep into the character of the<br />
boy, and of the man, it also has its superficial aspect, the<br />
courtesy which human beings owe, one to the other.<br />
Life becomes a rugh, tough thing; public life is a<br />
rough, tough life. There are many aspects in the world which<br />
appear superficially to be rough and tough, in which victory<br />
goes to the strongest, and the most enduring. No man was ever<br />
less strong, no man was ever less tough by treating with<br />
courtesy what other people think or say, or do.<br />
Since everybody has been here now for some tine I just<br />
want to mention my fourth which you will think quite absurd, I'm<br />
sure. Because this is not one of the great virtues at all.<br />
This is something that I think is , ravely misunderstood, I'm<br />
all in favour of boys wrhen they are at school learning to speak<br />
their own language with respect and with justice.<br />
I'm staggered, ladies and gentlemen, at the numbher of<br />
times I can listen to a man talking, not getting up and making<br />
a speech, but just talking, conversationally, turns out to have<br />
two or three deg. rees but no degree at all in the English<br />
languagell Speaking in a shoddy, snufflinga fashion, murdering<br />
the King's . kiglish or the Queen's Enlgish as I suppose it is<br />
now. This is no good. This is not a sign of intelligence. It<br />
is a sign of quite the opposite.<br />
I don' t know enough about Cranbrook to know to what<br />
extent you are an exception to a deplorable rule but It m bound<br />
to tell you quite frankly that in my experience Lhe average<br />
Girls' School is more concerned at speech than the average<br />
Boys' school. It is very easy, you know, when you are a boy at school<br />
to disregard that because if a boy at school finds himself the<br />
exception in a liltle gr,, oup, and has been in the habit of<br />
speaking his language with precision and correctness, and<br />
pleasantly, somebody may say that he's a bit " sissy"; somebody<br />
imitates him, you know.<br />
I say don't worry about that. This English languaige<br />
of ours I speak with the valor of partial igniorance is one<br />
of the -reatest and most flexible tongues that God ever put<br />
into the mind and mouth of man to speak. It's a marvellous<br />
languago. ( Applause) </p>
<p>0 4.<br />
It has produced more poetry, I venture to say, of the<br />
highest order than any other language in the history of man. It<br />
is a beautiful adjustable, flexible language with, contained<br />
inside itself, all the subtleties in the world. And, like all<br />
other great languages, those who know it best, will speak it<br />
most simply. Don't fall into the error of thinking that it is a<br />
proof of education to use long words with Latin endings.<br />
( Laughter) The people I have known who loved long words most,<br />
who were polysyllabic marvels, were those who undorstood the<br />
language least. The great object of knowing your own language is to<br />
speak it with justice and weight and simplicity. You read a<br />
speech by Winston Churchill, you go back and read a speech by<br />
the younger Pitt 100 years before, and you will find the lovely<br />
simplicity of language.<br />
Because after all, it is only a man who is a master of<br />
his language who can eliminate these rather foolish long words<br />
and settle for that simple, direct speech which is the ultimate<br />
proof of scholarship and of knowledge of the language.<br />
Now I say that to the boys because I think this is<br />
tremendously important, that we should have in our owm country<br />
don't worry about people's arguments over whether so-and-so has<br />
an accent of the home counties or whether he's got an English or<br />
Somerset accent, or Victorian accent which of course is very<br />
good ( Laughter) or a Sydney accent, which has its moments.<br />
( Laughter) Don't worry about that.<br />
What we ought to worry about is the quality, the<br />
justice, the conciseness, the effect of the words you use.<br />
Now, Sir, I've given you a mixed grill really: two<br />
very great virtues at the beginning, a third, a considerable<br />
virtue; and the fourth you may not think a virtue at all. But<br />
since speech is the universal means of communication, and since<br />
in these days no man can lead in anything unless he can<br />
communicate his ideas to other people, never neglect speech.<br />
In the long run it is one of the groat instruments that you will<br />
have to use all your life.<br />
Now that is all I want to say. There have been<br />
people standing up around the back, including I say with regret,<br />
as a Presbyterian, the Dean of Sydney. Normally I don't mind a<br />
Church of England fellow standing up and listening to me. But<br />
I do feel that I've made it a little bit hot this afternoon,<br />
both literally and otherwise.<br />
I'm delighted to be here. On the last two occasions<br />
I couldn't be here for reasons that were beyond my control. On<br />
this occasion I made up my mind that I must be here whatever<br />
came or went. It only just happened because Paiiar.. ent sat a<br />
week longer than anybody supposed, and it sat up till 4 o'clock<br />
on Friday morning. But this being Saturday, I've arrived, I<br />
have spoken, I apologise but I'm delighted. ( Applause) </p>
