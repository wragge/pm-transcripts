PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 10 OCTOBER 1989<br />
The Government welcomes the decision of the Australian<br />
Industrial Relations Commission handed down this afternoon.<br />
The Commission's decision is a complete vindication of the<br />
stand taken by the Government from the beginning of this<br />
dispute and of the correctness of the actions taken by the<br />
airlines as responsible employers with the support of the<br />
Government. Furthermore the decision applies to the pilots quite<br />
strictly the guidelines that have been applied to all other<br />
workers. This principle has been fundamental to the<br />
Government's position throughout this dispute.<br />
The wage fixing system and thereby the restructuring of the<br />
Australian economy, which have been threatened by the<br />
pilots, have been protected.<br />
Also protected, quite properly, have been the rights of<br />
those pilots already employed by the companies in their<br />
re-building programs.<br />
By expressing the view that awards should be made in terms<br />
of the existing contracts, the AIRC has settled the issue of<br />
pilots' remuneration.<br />
The way is now clear for pilots to continue to return to<br />
work by signing the contracts which have now been endorsed<br />
by the AIRC and which will form the basis of a new award.<br />
Enormous damage has been done to Australia's tourism<br />
industry by the past actions of the AFAP. The Government<br />
hopes that the airlines will be quickly rebuilt to allow the<br />
provision of normal services as soon as technically<br />
possible. The future involvement in the airline industry of the AFAP<br />
is now in its own hands. The AIRC has laid out a process<br />
whereby it would be appropriate for the AFAP to be bound by<br />
the awards, in the words of the Commission, " provided the<br />
bans on seeking employment with the companies are lifted,<br />
provided that the AFAP is prepared to undertake to accept<br />
decisions of the Commission and provided the AFAP is<br />
prepared to give the necessary undertakings required by the<br />
National Wage Case decision."<br />
The Government calls on pilots to rejoin the industry under<br />
the new award. </p>
