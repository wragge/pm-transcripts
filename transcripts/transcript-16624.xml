    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Rudd Government will honour its election commitment to ensure there is a tough cop on the beat in the building and construction industry.</p>
<p>Tomorrow the Government will introduce legislation which responds to the Wilcox Review by amending the Building and Construction Industry Improvement (BCII) Act.</p>
<p>The legislation will honour our promise to abolish the Australian Building and Construction Commission and replace it with the Fair Work  -  Building Industry Inspectorate.</p>
<p>The existing coercive powers will be maintained, alongside new safeguards recommended by Federal Court Judge Murray Wilcox.</p>
<p>The Government's position on the Australian Building and Construction Commission (ABCC) has been clear for a long period of time.</p>
<p>There are problems in parts of the building and construction sector which cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>The Rudd Government has no tolerance for conduct which breaks the law, whether it be unlawful industrial action or underpayment of employees.</p>
<p>At the same time, this sector is full of hard working people helping to build Australia towards recovery.</p>
<p>That's why the Government is determined to get the balance right.</p>
<p>Last year the Government asked former Federal Court Judge Murray Wilcox to produce a report following months of consultations with stakeholders.</p>
<p>The Wilcox report came to the following pivotal conclusion about the ongoing need for coercive powers:</p>
<p>“I am satisfied there is still such a level of industrial unlawfulness in the building and construction industry, especially in Victoria and Western Australia, that it would be inadvisable not to empower the [Specialist Division] to undertake compulsory interrogation. The reality is that, without such a power, some types of contravention would be almost impossible to prove.</p>
<p>I have reached the opinion that it would be unwise not to endow [Specialist Division] (at least for now) with a coercive interrogation power. Although conduct in the industry has improved in recent years, I believe the job is not yet done.”</p>
<p>The Wilcox report also recommended important new safeguards on the exercise of the coercive powers.</p>
<p>The Government agrees with the principal conclusions of the Wilcox report and has determined to retain the coercive powers with the new safeguards Wilcox recommends.</p>
<p>Importantly, the Government is taking an extra step to respond to the Wilcox observation that parts of the building and construction industry raise increased compliance problems.</p>
<p>The Government has developed a mechanism to switch off the coercive powers for peaceful parts of the industry where such extra compliance arrangements are not necessary.</p>
<p>This will enable compliance to be focussed on those parts of the industry where it is needed most.</p>
<p>The Government has also accepted and implemented the Wilcox recommendations to equalise penalties for building workers with other workers and to sunset the coercive powers in five years' time.</p>
<p>Prior to the sunset there will be a review of compliance in the building and construction industry.</p>
