PRESS STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
MR HECLD HOLT IN NEW YORK 1ST SEPTEMBER, 1966<br />
President de Gaulle's Statement on Viet Nam<br />
President De Gaulle is reported as saying in Phnom Penh.<br />
Cambodia that the United S ates must agree to a timetable for the<br />
withdrawal of its forces from Vietnam before a negotiated settlement<br />
of the war is possible.<br />
The disturbing feature of this statement is that the French<br />
President seems to demand that firm commitments be made for the<br />
withdrawal of American forces from Vietnam before even the opening of<br />
ne-gotiations. It seems that President de Gaulle ignores the basic cause of<br />
the fighting in South Vietnam, which is the agression both indirect<br />
through infiltration and subversion and direct through the movement of<br />
regular armed forces by the regime ini M~ r-tf eighbour,<br />
South Vietnam. Surely any question about the withdrawal of American and<br />
Allied forces should take place within the context of negotiations for a<br />
settlement and must be balanced by guaranteed undertakings that the<br />
people of South Vietnam would no longer be subjected to the aggression<br />
from which they are suffering.<br />
Those of us, like the United States and Australia, who are<br />
supporting South Vietnam have many times appealed for discussions which<br />
would indicate willingness on the other side to move towards a settlement<br />
on just terms based on the Geneva Agreements of 1954.<br />
The free countries of South East Asia have felt a strengthened<br />
security and made noticeable progress behind the shield provided by the<br />
American presence in South Vietnam.<br />
Speaking as the representative of a country situated close to<br />
South East Asia, and with recent, first hand knowledge of conditions there,<br />
I must say that an untoonditional withdrawal of American forces would cause<br />
grave concern among the people of South East Asia.<br />
It is not a question, as President de Gaulle is reported as saying,<br />
of the peoples of Asia submitted to the law of foreigners from over the<br />
pacific. The people of South East Asia understand and welcome the support<br />
of the United States and others in helping themto establish the conditions under<br />
which they can really decide their future for themselves, free from fear of<br />
aggression. </p>
