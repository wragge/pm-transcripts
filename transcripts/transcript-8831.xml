Australian Institute of Criminology in organising the large number of nominations<br />
received for the new Award.<br />
The interest in the Award, and the standard of nominations for 1992 was excellent', Mr<br />
Keating said. ' The Selection Board received numerous inquiries and almost 200<br />
nominations, and had considerable difficulty deciding between some of them. it decided<br />
for this year that, in recognition of the wide variety of valuable projects addressing<br />
violence in many different ways, the Award should be divided between 13 nominations'.<br />
Three nominations were outstanding. They are:<br />
the Julalikari Night Patrol from the Aboriginal community of Julalikari in the<br />
Northern Territory, which was awarded $ 40,000 for its innovative, community<br />
based approach to breaking the cycle between excessive alcohol consumption and<br />
violence; 6727' </p>
<p>the West End Forum, which was awarded $ 20,000 for its success in reducing<br />
violence in the nightclub centres of the West End of Melbourne through integrated<br />
community action and server intervention programs; and<br />
the Brisbane-based Kids Help Line, awarded $ 20,000 for its unique telephone<br />
counselling service for children, which addresses many of the problems caused by<br />
violence by and against children both in the short term through counselling and in<br />
the longer term through its data base.<br />
Awards of $ 1,000 will also be made to 10 highly commended projects.<br />

Mr Keating said that the value of the Australian Violence Prevention Awards goes far<br />
beyond the token monetary prize they receive. That a project has been nominated for the<br />
Award is in itself a great honour for the projects concerned, all of which have been<br />
recognised as contributing to the reduction or prevention of violence in Australia.,<br />
