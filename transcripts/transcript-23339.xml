    <content><![CDATA[<p>NorthConnex will move into planning approval phase with todayâs announcement that Lend Lease and Boygues will join forces with Transurban to design and construct this critical motorway link for the residents of Sydney and beyond.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth will invest $405 million in the $3 billion NorthConnex to build the missing link between the M1 and M2 motorways to reduce congestion, shorten travel times and improve the safety of our roads.</p>
<p>Construction on NorthConnex will commence next year and the tunnel is expected to open in 2019.</p>
<p>Better infrastructure will be the hallmark of the Coalition Government and projects such as NorthConnex and WestConnex are part of a nationwide major roads blueprint.</p>
<p>These projects are vital pieces of economic infrastructure that will boost the productive capacity of the NSW economy, delivering economic growth and jobs.</p>
<p>NorthConnex will ease traffic congestion, particularly along Pennant Hills Road, enabling commuters and freight trucks to bypass up to 21 traffic lights and reduce travel time by up to 15 minutes. It will also reduce the number of heavy vehicles travelling along Pennant Hills Road by more than 5000 trucks per day.</p>
<p>NorthConnex will increase the efficiency of freight movements and improve safety, air quality and reduce noise for residents and businesses that border the corridor.</p>
<p>Projects such as NorthConnex are the result of a strong working relationship between the Commonwealth and NSW Governments.</p>
<p>We are partnering to deliver some of Australiaâs biggest transport and infrastructure projects to deliver real benefits for the people of Sydney and for the people of NSW.</p>
