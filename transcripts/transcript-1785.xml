    <content><![CDATA[<p>Q: First of all, Prime Minister, congratulations on the result.</p>
<p>PM: Thank you very much.</p>
<p>Â Q:Â  What is your reaction to the result?</p>
<p>Â PM: It was such a good result, I think, that It makes you feel you reallyÂ  must reinforce your determination to try and justify it to the people whoÂ  have expressed thair confidence in that result.<br />Â <br />Â Q, Do you take it as a vote of confidence in the Government, Mr Gorton?<br />Â <br />Â PM: I think it must be regarded as a vote supporting the Government'sÂ  policies, yes.</p>
<p>Â Q. Would you care to comment on the DLP the fact that they didn't haveÂ  a candidate and you got an increased majority over the former PrimeÂ  Minister?<br />Â <br />PM: Well, I haven't been able to work the exact figures out on that. IÂ  think it Is probable that part or may be all of t ' he increased majorityÂ  might be attributable to the fact that the DLP previously had a candidateÂ  and this time they didn't. But I think until we analyse it, we won't know.Â Â  And I don't even know what the end result is going to be because there areÂ  a lot of postal votes to be counted. I would like to just wait and see whatÂ  the final wash-up is.<br />Â <br />Â Q. Now that you are a Member of the House of Representatives and haveÂ  virtually overcome the last obstacle, is there likely to be any change orÂ  are you likely to make any kind of statement<br />Â <br />Â PM: Any change?<br />Â <br />Â Q. Any change in running the office?<br />Â <br />Â PM: Oh, well, we will be saying all those sorts of things in the next fewÂ  days. I am making an announcement on Monday as you know, and willÂ  be talking about administrative rearrangements and that kind of thing later.<br />Â <br />Â Q: Are you going to have yourself re-sworn in as Prime Minister, Sir?<br />Â <br />Â PM: I think . that is probably the way I would be advised to do it but itÂ  depends a good deal on the advice of those who know all the constitutionalÂ  facets of this. But I gather that is the way their minds arc working.<br />Â <br />Â Q: Â You may not be able to answer this, but have you actually been inÂ  the Chamber of the House of Representatives to have a look at it sinceÂ  you became Prime Minister?</p>
<p>Â PM: I don't believe I have<br />Â <br />Â Q Have you been in it very often before that while you were aÂ  Senator?<br />Â <br />Â PM: Oh, from time to time. Very often. I have been a Senator for aÂ  long time and I haven't counted up the number of times I have been in,Â  and divided it into the number of years, but I have had a look at it fromÂ  time to time.<br />Â <br />Â Q. I thought perhaps you hadn'tÂ  actually seen it?<br />Â <br />Â PM: Oh, heavens, yes.<br />Â <br />Â Q. Will you be spending this afternoon on the phone to prospectiveÂ  Ministers?<br />Â <br />Â PM: Well, we will be going back to the Lodge and having some lunch andÂ  then we will just be spending the afternoon.<br />Â <br />Â Q. Will you make a comment on the New South Wales election result?<br />Â <br />Â PM: Yes, I can. I can say how delighted I am that the Liberal PartyÂ  in New South Wales has been returned with what appears to be aÂ  considerably increased majority. There were two elections, of courseÂ  on Saturday, and that, I think, reinforces my belief that there is supportÂ  for the Liberal Party and its policy rather than some personal support,Â  because in New South Wales in a State election they have doneÂ  extraordinarily well.<br />Â <br />Â Q. Do you think this might be a rportent of things to come in South Austraiia and Western Australia?<br />Â <br />Â PM: Cne thing I think you will agree with me about is that I never tryÂ  to forecast the results of any election. I always like to wait until theÂ  numbers come up!</p>
