    <content><![CDATA[<p>Q: First of all, Prime Minister, congratulations on the result.</p>
<p>PM: Thank you very much.</p>
<p> Q:  What is your reaction to the result?</p>
<p> PM: It was such a good result, I think, that It makes you feel you really  must reinforce your determination to try and justify it to the people who  have expressed thair confidence in that result.<br /> <br /> Q, Do you take it as a vote of confidence in the Government, Mr Gorton?<br /> <br /> PM: I think it must be regarded as a vote supporting the Government's  policies, yes.</p>
<p> Q. Would you care to comment on the DLP the fact that they didn't have  a candidate and you got an increased majority over the former Prime  Minister?<br /> <br />PM: Well, I haven't been able to work the exact figures out on that. I  think it Is probable that part or may be all of t ' he increased majority  might be attributable to the fact that the DLP previously had a candidate  and this time they didn't. But I think until we analyse it, we won't know.   And I don't even know what the end result is going to be because there are  a lot of postal votes to be counted. I would like to just wait and see what  the final wash-up is.<br /> <br /> Q. Now that you are a Member of the House of Representatives and have  virtually overcome the last obstacle, is there likely to be any change or  are you likely to make any kind of statement<br /> <br /> PM: Any change?<br /> <br /> Q. Any change in running the office?<br /> <br /> PM: Oh, well, we will be saying all those sorts of things in the next few  days. I am making an announcement on Monday as you know, and will  be talking about administrative rearrangements and that kind of thing later.<br /> <br /> Q: Are you going to have yourself re-sworn in as Prime Minister, Sir?<br /> <br /> PM: I think . that is probably the way I would be advised to do it but it  depends a good deal on the advice of those who know all the constitutional  facets of this. But I gather that is the way their minds arc working.<br /> <br /> Q:  You may not be able to answer this, but have you actually been in  the Chamber of the House of Representatives to have a look at it since  you became Prime Minister?</p>
<p> PM: I don't believe I have<br /> <br /> Q Have you been in it very often before that while you were a  Senator?<br /> <br /> PM: Oh, from time to time. Very often. I have been a Senator for a  long time and I haven't counted up the number of times I have been in,  and divided it into the number of years, but I have had a look at it from  time to time.<br /> <br /> Q. I thought perhaps you hadn't  actually seen it?<br /> <br /> PM: Oh, heavens, yes.<br /> <br /> Q. Will you be spending this afternoon on the phone to prospective  Ministers?<br /> <br /> PM: Well, we will be going back to the Lodge and having some lunch and  then we will just be spending the afternoon.<br /> <br /> Q. Will you make a comment on the New South Wales election result?<br /> <br /> PM: Yes, I can. I can say how delighted I am that the Liberal Party  in New South Wales has been returned with what appears to be a  considerably increased majority. There were two elections, of course  on Saturday, and that, I think, reinforces my belief that there is support  for the Liberal Party and its policy rather than some personal support,  because in New South Wales in a State election they have done  extraordinarily well.<br /> <br /> Q. Do you think this might be a rportent of things to come in South Austraiia and Western Australia?<br /> <br /> PM: Cne thing I think you will agree with me about is that I never try  to forecast the results of any election. I always like to wait until the  numbers come up!</p>
