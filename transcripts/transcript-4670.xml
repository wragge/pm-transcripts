FOR PRESS .6 APRIL 1978<br />
VISIT OF PRESIDENT SCHEEL<br />
The President of the Federal Republic of Germany, Mr Walter<br />
Scheel, will make a State visit to Australia in the second<br />
half of this year, probably in October.<br />
He will be accompanied by his wife, Dr Mildred Scheel.<br />
The Prime Minister said today that President Scheel's visit<br />
to Australia would be the first by a Head of State of the<br />
Federal Republic of Germany. The Australian Government warmly<br />
welcomed the visit, which would mark a further stage in the<br />
development of closer relations between the two countries,<br />
and provide a further opportunity for discussions on a<br />
range of important bilateral and international matters of<br />
interest to both countries.<br />
The Prime Minister noted that there had been a significant<br />
increase in the number of high-level visits between the<br />
two countries in recent times. This was a trend which he<br />
welcomed. He recalled with pleasure his own visit to Bonn in June 1977. </p>
