    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong></p>
<p>The priority will be to support the recovery. We have clearly, as Mark has just been saying, as the day progresses we will get an understanding of the damage from the storm.</p>
<p>We have put in place enormous preparation for this storm. This is one of the great advantages of all of the technology that you see around us, is to be able to anticipate these events. So there are well over a thousand emergency personnel and Defence personnel literally ready to go in today. They’re working seamlessly with the state emergency services, the cooperation – again - is closer than it’s ever been.</p>
<p>We’ve learned from one natural disaster after another to refine and improve the level of cooperation. The engagement of the Australian Defence Forces, in preparing for this, is the most elaborate and comprehensive it’s ever been.</p>
<p>Nature has flung her worst at the people of North Queensland and it’s now our job to make sure that every agency pulls together, and indeed the private sector, particularly the banks and insurance companies pull together, to provide support for the people of North Queensland who have had a very tough day and night in this.</p>
<p>There will be a lot of damage, as Mark has just been saying, particularly to older buildings, older homes in particular. A lot of damage done now to recover, to clean up, to restore power, to make power lines safe.</p>
<p>Above all the important message is to stay safe and follow the advice of the authorities. Mark and Michael, I think you can reinforce that. A lot of the injuries and damage to people is caused by taking risks particularly with flood waters after the storm has passed. If it’s flooded, forget it. Don’t walk through, drive through, let alone try to swim through flood waters. Extremely dangerous. As Mark was saying, there’s a flood peak, which will peak in Mackay, you said. When will that be Mark? Next 24 hours.</p>
<p>Again, the people of North Queensland are very familiar with cyclones and extreme weather events like this. So they’re well prepared. We’re well prepared, supporting them. But above all, people have got to be safe, be very careful in taking the advice of local emergency authorities. That’s the critical thing. The most important thing is ensuring safety of people and their families and avoiding that personal injury wherever we can.</p>
