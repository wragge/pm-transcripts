    <content><![CDATA[<p>Responding to an invitation from Denmark, I have asked the Governor-General and Mrs Jeffery to represent Australia at the wedding of His Royal Highness the Crown Prince of Denmark and Australian-born Miss Mary Donaldson, formerly of Tasmania.</p>
<p>  The wedding ceremony will be in Copenhagen on 14 May, and will be the focal point of a series of events celebrating the occasion, including a dinner to be hosted by the Governor-General for Her Majesty the Queen of Denmark and His Royal Highness the Prince Consort in honour of the Crown Prince and his bride-to-be.</p>
<p>The Governor-General's visit to Denmark will be part of a broader program of activities promoting Australian exports to Europe, including wine, Tasmanian food products, and Australian art and culture.  This will provide an excellent showcase for Australia.</p>
<p>While in Europe, the Governor-General will also visit Germany, the world's third largest economy and a major partner for Australia in Europe.  While there, he will launch Weinwoche 2004 in Berlin and Munich, a major promotion of Australian wine and food.</p>
