    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>23 September 1993</strong></p>
<p><strong>Journalist;</strong> Â Mr Keating, your impressions of the presentation?</p>
<p><strong>PM: </strong>Well, I thought the presentation went exceptionally well. I felt the actualÂ format of the presentation was very impressive and its the first time I'd actuallyÂ seen it from front to back. And, one gets a good guide to how one's emotionsÂ are responding to these things and I thought, after a couple of film clips, oneÂ should break out and cheer. But we resisted doing that and I think theÂ presentation went very nicely and we got the key messages we wanted over,Â Â for Sydney Â - all of us</p>
<p><strong>Journalist;Â </strong>Mrs Keating how did you feel about it?</p>
<p><strong>Annita Keating </strong>Â I thought it was great, fantastic.</p>
<p><strong>Journalist;Â </strong>:Â Mr Keating there is a suggestion doing the rounds this morning that we'veÂ slipped into third behind Manchester. Would you give that any credence?</p>
<p><strong>PM: Â </strong> I think, at this stage of the game, its like trying to pick a Surry HillsÂ selectionÂ ballot at five to six on a Saturday night Â - forget about it.</p>
<p><strong>Journalist;</strong>Mr Keating, what's the task for the bid in the next few hours before the actualÂ ballot. What remains to be done?</p>
<p><strong>John Fahey;</strong> Stay sober. Stay sober, there's nothing more we can do except wait now forÂ the results.</p>
<p><strong>PM: </strong>Yes, I think it's in the box, as they say.</p>
<p>Ends.</p>
