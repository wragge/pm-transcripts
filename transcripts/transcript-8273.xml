" 14<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 14 MARCH 1991<br />
In the * 1983 ' White Paper " Reforming the Public Service" and<br />
in the _ second reading speech on the Public Service Reform<br />
Bill_ 1984, thie Government indicatec an intention tc--reviewthe<br />
placement of Secret -aries of Departments after they have<br />
held office for five years, and to consider in those reviews<br />
the possibility of another placement.<br />
The intention of this policy was to encourage mobility, and<br />
to look to transferring Secretaries to new assignments where<br />
appropriate. In no sense wgas this intended to mean that Secretaries would<br />
automatically be moved after five years in a particular<br />
post. Two of the Secretaries of departments have either completed<br />
or are near to completing five year terms: the Secretary of<br />
the Department of Finance ( Dr Keating) and the Secretary of<br />
my own Department_( Mr Codd).<br />
Following the review, it has been decided that in both those<br />
cases the Secretaries should continue in their present<br />
positions. RECEIXTD<br />
