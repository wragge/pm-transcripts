PRIME MINISTER'S VISIT TO THE UNITED STATES<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton, will leave for<br />
the United States on Thursday for the official talks in Washington<br />

month. The discussions with President Nixon and senior<br />
members of his Administration will be held on Tuesday and<br />
Wednesday ( 6th and 7th) of next week.<br />
The Prime Minister, accompanied by Mrs. Gorton,<br />
will travel by Qantas direct to San Francisco, where they will<br />
transfer immediately to a Presidential aircraft for the flight to the<br />
East. Mr. Gorton will spend the weekend at Williamsburg, Virginia,<br />
after his long flight from Australia and preparing for his round of<br />
talks. He will fly to Washington by Presidential helicopter on Monday<br />
afternoon. He will leave Washington on Thursday, after a luncheon<br />
to be given in his honour by Senator J. W. Fullbright in the Foreign<br />
Relations Committee Room at the Capitol. The return travel<br />
arrangements are not yet finalised.<br />
