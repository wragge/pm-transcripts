CLOSING SESSION OF INTERNATIONAL UNION K69CJ~%<br />
OF BUILDING SOCIETIES CONGRESS<br />
SYDNEY, N. S. W. OCTOBER 1968<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton<br />
Mr. Chairman, Distinguished Members of Overseas and Australian<br />
Governments and Delegates from many countries:-<br />
For a week now, you have been devoting yourselves to<br />
discussing the questions of how to build houses, how to provide good<br />
and healthy accommodation and how to harness savings and use the<br />
thrifty instincts of individuals in order to see that these ends are<br />
attained. Your gathering here in such numbers, the roll calls of your<br />
distinguished-delegations, the professional and technical nature of your<br />
discussions all bear great witness to your understanding and dedication<br />
to the issues before you. And yet in a sense perhaps, your work has<br />
only begun with these discussions.<br />
Throughout history until very recent times, men have<br />
lived for the most part in small communities, in small towns or<br />
villages and what would now be regarded as small cities or indeed<br />
have wandered with their flocks and herds. It is in this modern age<br />
that we have been presented with a new situation, or at least with a<br />
situation whi * ch is accelerating in difficulty and in opportunity, because<br />
man has to a large extent now become a city dweller.<br />
As public health measures have advanced and as<br />
technological progress has been used, it has become possible to<br />
manufacture more and more goods, world population has risen and<br />
is rising it looks like doubling again within a single generation and<br />
with this, the movement towards larger and larger communities will<br />
continue. Thus I think all of us are faced with a problem of modern<br />
times and modern society, and that is to make cities for men rather<br />
than to fit men into inadequate cities. This is an enormous problem,<br />
calling for very great resources and allied inextricably to your interests<br />
of providing housing, if we are to get a proper end result.<br />
Let us examine the problem. I am a country man myself<br />
and I know the pleasure and the joys of open spaces. Somehow we have<br />
to preserve these, and yet at the same time, plan for those who will<br />
necessarily have to live in the more populous parts of the towns and cities.<br />
You people who are building seeking to build the living<br />
areas in these cities have a particular interest, I think, in seeing that<br />
your efforts in housing are not nullified, that the people in your healthy<br />
new houses are not choked by smog, that the people living in your houses<br />
can move freely and quickly from place to place, that they are not deafened<br />
nor have their nerves set on edge by a cacophony of noise. These are as<br />
allied to your aims as are the provisions of houses or dwelling places of<br />
any kind themselves. */ 2 </p>
<p>3-<br />
You will need to help with the housing of the needy, as<br />
well as considering the prosperous, and this may and probably will,<br />
involve special partnerships with governments. And there is beyond<br />
your immediate task of mobilising financial resources to permit<br />
families to purchase the homes they would like, the need for the<br />
planning and development of the new communities.<br />
Here in Australia, Sir, the challenge of the future is<br />
strong, strong indeed, because we have a population growing steadily<br />
by natural increase and by continuing intake of migrants. We are<br />
twelve million strong now and if all goes well, we will by the turn of<br />
the century be twenty-eight million. The turn of the century is not<br />
long in the life of a nation. It is but the blinking of an eye before we<br />
will come to the turn of the century. Nor is it long for a planner to<br />
be able to study, foresee and seek to overcome, or at least seek to<br />
show how these problems can be overcome if the resources can be<br />
acquired, nor is it long for the planner to have to do this.<br />
This means that the demand for adequate housing will<br />
be insistent, will continue to make calls on the resources of governments<br />
and of private enterprise, particularly in the fields where the organisations<br />
you represent are active, and particularly in the fields I have touched<br />
on, of seeking to create a proper environment.<br />
I am sure, Sir, you have been told and the conference<br />
has been told that in Australia over seventy per cent of all householders<br />
own their own homes or are paying them off. We, the Government,<br />
encourage this, as you do. And it is also an encouragement, though<br />
much more remains to be done in our country in this field, towards<br />
slum reclamation in attempts to wipe out unhappy legacies of the past.<br />
And it encourages flat construction to serve the preferences of those<br />
who wish to live in that type of dwelling.<br />
Here in Australia, by co-operation and State Governments,<br />
with private enterprise in this field of housing, we try and we aspire to<br />
house our people, to house them at reasonable costs in dwellings of their<br />
own choice and in the locality where they want to live. That is something<br />
of fundamental importance because the standard of a home environment<br />
could well be a critical factor in one's standard of life, and by that I<br />
don't mean that the best people live in the biggest houses. What I mean<br />
is that the householder who likes what he lives in is likely to make the<br />
best citizen, if he likes what he lives in and he likes what is around the<br />
house in which he lives.<br />
Today, forty per cent of we Australians are under<br />
twenty-one, so in truth we are a young country, but we aim to be<br />
mature and to be forward-looking in the way we try to house our people.<br />
In this we regard it as important that old Australians and new Australians<br />
have here the same opportunities to acquire homes of their own or to live<br />
in other dwellings of their choice, and in this aim, Sir, your organisation<br />
plays a helpful and significant part.<br />
I think our record is a creditable one, but it is not a<br />
record which means that by any means full solutions have been found.<br />
It does mean that advances have been made towards these solutions.<br />
*/ 4 </p>
<p>-4-<br />
Now, Mr. Chairman and gentlemen, your presence<br />
here today and the fact that you have honoured us by having your<br />
Congress in Australia is most pleasing to all Australians and most<br />
pleasing to myself as Prime Minister. I know the Australian delegates<br />
have found much of value in this conference. The opportunity to talk<br />
with their experienced colleagues from the older, industrialised<br />
countries has been valuable to them, and I am sure Australia will<br />
gain a lot as a result. I think, too, that the delegates from Asia, Africa and<br />
South America have perhaps learnt much, have perhaps thought much<br />
as to the application of means towards the ends we all seek, and in<br />
particulartowards the fostering of savings and loan movements in their<br />
own countries. You have covered a great deal of important ground in<br />
your deliberations and in examining proposals for a world housing<br />
bank, a world personnel bank, among many other things.<br />
By such assemblies as these, you help to expose the<br />
housing problems of a world society which is expanding rapidly under<br />
enormous population pressures. And more than that, you are contributing<br />
to the search for the solution to the problem of how man can happily,<br />
healthily and with a sense of satisfaction live in the new vast communities<br />
which must grow. You have had much success. I extend my congratulations<br />
to you for what you have done, for what you aspire to do, and for the<br />
spirit which lies behind all of your activities. </p>
