PRIME MINISTER 56/ 94<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON PJ KEATING MP<br />
THE 1995 GLOBAL CULTURAL DIVERSITY CONFERENCE<br />
I am proud to announce that the Australian Government, in conjunction with<br />
the New South Wales Government, through the NSW Ethnic Affairs<br />
Commission, and the Australian Multicultural Foundation, will host a major<br />
international conference on cultural diversity next year.<br />
The Conference will be the first international conference of its kind, and will<br />
be a part of Australia's official celebrations for the 50th anniversary of the<br />
United Nations and the International Year for Tolerance.<br />
In keeping with the stature of the occasion, the UIN Secretary-General,<br />
H E Dr Boutros Boutros Ghali has agreed to deliver the keynote address.<br />
1995 is also the 50th anniversary year of the United Nations Educational,<br />
Scientific and Cultural Organisation ( UNESCO). The UNESCO Director-<br />
General, Dr Federico Mayor will also address the Conference.<br />
The event will be staged at the Sydney Convention and Exhibition Centre at<br />
Darling Harbour, from 28 to 28 April 1995. We expect to attract around 1,000<br />
national and international delegates.<br />
Senior political, academic and community leaders from around the world will<br />
be invited. The Conference will provide a forum for the exchange of ideas<br />
and experiences on ways of dealing with the increasing diversity of our lives;<br />
the result of the international movement of people', advances in<br />
communications; and the globalisation of international markets.<br />
The Conference will be held in the first year of the Decade of indigenous<br />
People. indigenous issues will be woven throughout the Conference<br />
program.<br />
The focus willbe on developing public policy aimed at building social<br />
cohesion and encouraging an appreciation of cultural, religious, racial and<br />
linguistic diversity, including ways in which it can be developed as a social<br />
and economic asset.<br />
It will also be an occasion when our own proud record of achievement in this<br />
area will be held up for international scrutiny.<br />
