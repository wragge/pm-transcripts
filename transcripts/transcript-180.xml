APPOINTMENT OF CHAIRMAN OF NAi2IONAL LIBRARY COUNCIL<br />
Statement by the Acting Prime Minister Hon. J. MoEwen<br />
The Acting Prime Minister, Mr. MoEwen, announced today<br />
that the Government had appointed Dr. A. Grenfell Price, C. M. G.,<br />
of Adelaide, as Chairman of the National Library Council.<br />
In the House last Thursday, Mr. McEwen outlined the<br />
Government's decisions on the National Library. These decisions<br />
included the division of the National Library into two parts<br />
the Parliamentary Library and the National Library. The National<br />
Library would be administered by a Council, appointed on an interim<br />
basis pending passage of the necessary legislation through<br />
Parliament, probably later this year.<br />
Mr. McEwen said: " We are fortunate in being tLe to secure<br />
the services of such an eminent man for this responsible<br />
position. " Dr. Grenfell Price, vrho was a Member of the Commonwealth<br />
Parliament from 1941 to 1943, has had wide experience in the<br />
literary and library fields.<br />
" He is a well known geographer, historian and educationalist,<br />
and was Master of St. Mark's College, University of<br />
Adelaide, from 1924 to 1956.<br />
" In 1936 he was appointed to report on libraries in<br />
South Australia maintained or assisted by the State, and he also<br />
was a member of the Committee under Sir George Paton whichi produced<br />
the report on the National Library on which the Government's<br />
recent decisions were based.<br />
" Dr. Grenfell Price is at present Chairman of the Advisory<br />
Board of the Commonwealth Lite√±' ary Fund, a positionwhich he<br />
has held since 1953. He recently resigned as Secretary of The<br />
Humanities Research Council, a position he had held since its<br />
inception. " He will, I am sure, bring to the responsible position<br />
of Chairman of the National Library Council much aergy and knowledge<br />
and the Government is gratified that he has been able to<br />
accept the appointment."<br />
Dr. Grenfell Price's appointment is for three years.<br />
