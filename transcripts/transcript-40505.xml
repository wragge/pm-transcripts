    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Australian Government and the people of Australia express our deepest sorrow and sympathy to the Thai Royal Family and people of Thailand on the passing of His Majesty, King Bhumibol Adulyadej.</p>
<p>King Bhumibol was widely revered and was a major figure in modern Asian history. During his reign, Thailand made major strides in economic and social development.  He was held in the highest esteem in the region and internationally for his significant contribution to the development of his country.</p>
<p>His Majesty’s dedication to the people of Thailand throughout his long reign was evident through his many royal projects and charitable works.  His Majesty significantly enhanced the welfare and happiness of the people of Thailand, and he will be greatly missed.</p>
<p>His Majesty King Bhumibol was a friend of Australia and we sincerely value the deep relationship between our countries which His Majesty helped foster.  </p>
<p>King Bhumibol and Queen Sirikit visited Australia in 1962. The Royal visit inspired the formation of the first Australia-Thailand associations in Sydney and Melbourne.  The Thai community in Australia will particularly feel the loss of His Majesty.</p>
<p>At this sad time, I extend to the Thai Royal Family and the people of Thailand my sincere condolences and those of the Government and people of Australia.</p>
