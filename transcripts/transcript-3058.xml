NQ DATE<br />
M/ 158 31 October 1973<br />
WHITIJAMV/ OHIRA PRE1SS CONFERENCE, TOKYO ; 1<br />
Following is a transcript of the joint press<br />
conference held by the Japanese Foreign Minister, Mr Ohira,<br />
and the Australian Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam, at the<br />
conclusion of the Australia/ Japan Ministerial Committee<br />
talks at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Tokyo, on<br />
October 1973.<br />
Mr Ohira We have just completed the two day second meeting<br />
of the Australia/ Japan Ministerial Committee.<br />
This is the second meeting of this Committee, and<br />
is the first full-scale and highest level contact between our<br />
two countries since the Labor Party came to office in December<br />
last year. You are all very familiar with the situation between<br />
Japan and Australia. Our relations are such that for Japan, Australia is<br />
the second largest trading partner next only to the United States.<br />
For Australia, Japan is her largest partner.<br />
But it is not only that our relations have grown to a<br />
tremendous level quantitatively.<br />
I want to emphasise that the relationship between our<br />
two countries has come to an enormous completeness, that of<br />
mutual dependence and complementarity.<br />
This, however, does not mean that there are no problems<br />
on each of our sides.<br />
There are problems on each of our sides.<br />
But I believe on all of these issues or programs<br />
between us we have been able to conduct a very effective exchange<br />
of views without reservations, a dialogue that has been very </p>
<p>useful for our relationship.<br />
On our part, the Japanese Ministers who have taken part<br />
are deeply satisfied with the accomplishment of this meeting.<br />
Before I answer your specific questions, permit me to<br />
raise two matters that are worthy of particular note:<br />
One as you know, for some time the government of<br />
Japan had been asking the Australian government for the<br />
conclusion of a Treaty of Commerce and Navigation.<br />
At the present meeting, Prime Minister Whitlam. has<br />
told us that indeed Australia today is thinking about such a<br />
treaty, but not just a Treaty of Commerce and Navigation but in<br />
terms of a new treaty that would formalise the Japan/ Australian<br />
relations on a much broader basis.<br />
And, in the meeting between Prime Minister Whitlam and<br />
our Prime Minister, Mr Tanaka, Mr Tanaka expressed his<br />
wholehearted agreement to the proposal explained by Mr Whitlam.<br />
So from now on between the two governments the<br />
officials will be racking their brains and will be vorking hard<br />
to come up with a draft of a treaty after thoroughly studying<br />
what kind of relationship there should be between our two<br />
countries, as we want to respond to the new age.<br />
We hope to produce a draft that would fully answer the<br />
expectations placed upon us by the two Prime Ministers.<br />
Salient point number two, energy and resourtes matters,<br />
which have of late brought about much tension in the world,<br />
is a matter of particular concern to Japan.<br />
Japan has vital interest in a stable and continuous<br />
supply of energy and resources. 00 -a<br />
Australia, on the other hand, has the capacity to<br />
supply a large quantity of energy and other natural resources.<br />
And, through supplying such resources, Australia seeks<br />
to increase the opportunities for employment of its citizens and<br />
thus to raise the standard of living and welfare of its people.<br />
Therefore, the current energy and resources crisis<br />
has helped to bring to the fore the relationship of mutual<br />
dependence and complementarity between our two countries. </p>
<p>At the various levels our two governments will now<br />
begin close contact, and we are sincerely desirous that our<br />
already close relationship be further enhanced.<br />
Finally, I would like to say that, as you have been<br />
able to observe, our guest, Prime T-inister Whitlam, is a man of<br />
informal disposition and charming character.<br />
I think that for both the Japanese and the Australians<br />
we are lucky that a person like Mr W-hitiam. has come to such close<br />
contact with Japan, and I take this opportunity to once again<br />
wholeheartedly welcome the delegation led by Mr Whitlam and<br />
appreciate the outcome of this conference.<br />
Mr Whitlam: Mr Ohira, I am very happy indeed, in the presence of<br />
our countries Ambassadors and press, to appear with you on this<br />
occasion. This has been a very significant few days in the<br />
history of Australia and, I hope, in the history of Japan.<br />
I join with you in expressing satisfaction at all the<br />
proceedings and the results of our meeting.<br />
I was here, also as Prime Minister, to have discussion<br />
with Mr Tanaka. I did so on the morning of my arrival last Friday.<br />
I conclude with another on the morning of our<br />
departure tomorrow.<br />
We had a very memorable and enjoyable dinner as his<br />
guests last night, and then yesterday and today, there was the<br />
second Ministerial Meeting.<br />
I had previously, two and a half years ago, met you,<br />
sir, and Mr Sakurauchi, Mr Nakasone, in Tokyo.<br />
One year ago, you, and Mr Nakasone in Canberra.<br />
My colleag-ues9 Dr Cairns and Mr Crean, have already<br />
been here as Ministers and have met you.<br />
Others of my ministerial colleagues have also been<br />
received by you.<br />
In all these individual meetings that wve have had, in<br />
government or in opposition, we have formed a very high degree<br />
of understanding with the government of Japan. </p>
<p>4-<br />
And now, collectively, as Australian M~ inisters, the<br />
largest number of Ministers ever to leave Australia to visit<br />
any other country or for any other purpose, we are happy inaeed<br />
with the outcome of these discussions concerning the relations<br />
between our two countries.<br />
You didn't mention, perhaps you were leaving it for<br />
me, that in many ways the highlight of our visit was at<br />
Mr and Mrs Tanaka' s dinner last night when the Prime Minister<br />
of Japan suggested that the outcome of our deliberations, the<br />
treaty, might be known as the Treaty of Nara.<br />
It was an appropriate title in Japan, commemorating<br />
the significance of Japan's ancient capital and cultural centre.<br />
From Australia's point of view it is an appropriate A4<br />
name for the Nippon-Australia Relations Agreement0 O14-0<br />
In both countries the name will be honourable.<br />
There has been a change ir√± the attitude of the<br />
Australian government to relations with Japan.<br />
Earlier there had * been reluctance, a negative<br />
attitude, towards the proposal that Japan had made for some<br />
years for a broad-ranging treaty between our two countries.<br />
0 My government was favouarable to the idea.<br />
It took a posit Lyve attitude towards it and from the<br />
first discussion that Mr Tanaka and. I had, in your presence,<br />
Mr Ohira, last Friday morning, through all the intervening<br />
formal and informal. meetings between us, the idea was greeted<br />
warmly. So in the next few weeks and months we can expect our<br />
officials to be discussing this matter.<br />
We each made suggestions as to the content of the<br />
agreement in our concluding plenary session this morning.<br />
But this is a memorable occasion0<br />
It is very satisfyang to the Australian Delegation,<br />
and we are happy indeed that the Prime Minister of Japan,<br />
himself, should have given such a warm reception to the idea<br />
and should have suggested such a memorable name for it0<br />
I must say, as I said to you privately, the whole<br />
of the Australian Delegation, the Ministers, the officials, </p>
<p>have been delighted with the arrangements which have been<br />
made in Tokyo and also in the provinces.<br />
We have been most warmly received and we have a better<br />
understanding of all the issues which have been raised by Japan.<br />
We believe Japan has a better understanding of the<br />
issues that Australia has raised.<br />
But it is typical of the efficiency and courtesy of<br />
this country, the host co-Untry, that wherever we went,<br />
arrangements were so pleasant and effective, and we thank you,<br />
* 0 Mr Ohira, very much for the arrangements over which you presided,<br />
in the conference and outside it.<br />
Quest ion:<br />
0 Mr Ohira, I would like to ask you whether you are<br />
concerned by Mr Whitlam's announcement at the meeting yesterday<br />
that the Australian government in future aims to prevent any<br />
further foreign ownership of Australian energy resources?<br />
Mr Ohira.-In regard to important energy resources, the<br />
government of Australia desires to establish their own national<br />
ownership and control, a desire and aspiration that I can fully<br />
understand and appreciate.<br />
However, this policy is a selective policy, as I<br />
understand it, and it does not apply to all minerals<br />
necessarily. There is a reservation to that policy, namely, that<br />
the important surplus will be available for export.<br />
This is an important point number one.<br />
Another important point, point number two, is that<br />
Australia has assured us that this policy is not going to be<br />
implemented in any way to discriminate against any particular<br />
country. All countries will be dealt with in fair fashion and<br />
I fully understand Australia's policy in so far as these<br />
reservations are concerned.<br />
Our question is, how we can best be sure of a stable<br />
supply of the resources or minerals that we seek on such a basis.<br />
Our job is to explore how we can be sure about that<br />
and I am sure we can find a way. </p>
<p>-6-<br />
Quesion: The Japanese business circles are very interested<br />
in your Pilbara project.<br />
We understand that Australia seeks to develop this<br />
entire region industrially and the Japanese business circles<br />
wish to co-operate to that end.<br />
The Japanese business interests seek to have equity<br />
participation in that project but I wonder what was the tenor<br />
of' your discussions yesterday?<br />
Could you tell us, Mr Whitlam, more specifically about<br />
Australian views with regard to the Japanese participation in<br />
this project, e. g. will Japanese equity participation be<br />
possible only through AIDO?<br />
Mr Whitlam: There was some discussion about the Pilbara and<br />
also about the AIDC.<br />
It was not, however, a conclusive discussion because<br />
it will not be probably until the middle of 1974 that the<br />
Australian National Government and the Western Australian<br />
State Government will receive the pre-feasibility report0<br />
At this stage, I think one can only generalise to<br />
this extent0 In so far as natural gas is involved in the development<br />
of the Pilbara, the objective will be to have wholly Australian<br />
ownership or control and the AIDC may be one of the implements<br />
for achieving that0<br />
And, accordingly, any overseas participation in the<br />
natural gas would have to be through the AIDC. eO( P"<br />
On the other hand, iron ore is clearly a componenlyp arc<br />
in any development of the Pilbara, and this may be, at various<br />
degrees, either a complete steel works or say pelletisation.<br />
In neither case would total Australian ownmership be<br />
required, and while the AIDO might participate in the ownership<br />
of any iron ore developments in the Pilbara, it would not be the<br />
only component in such developments.<br />
And, overseas interests would not have to go through<br />
the AIIDC as regards the development of the processing of iron<br />
ore </p>
<p>-7-<br />
Question: Mr Whitlam, what is the most important achievement of<br />
your talks as far as Australia is concerned?<br />
Mr Whitlam: To hear, at first hand, to explain at first hand, the<br />
attitudes, the policies, the programs, of the two governments.<br />
I suppose one can add also the response by the<br />
Australian government to the longstanding Japanese proposal for<br />
a broad bilateral treaty between the two countries.<br />
Question: Mr Whitlam has suggested that Asian and Pacific<br />
nations join in an organisation some-thing like the organisation<br />
for the American States and the organisation of African States.<br />
What is japan's position in this proposal?<br />
Mr Ohira: What kind of machinery for regional co-operation should<br />
be created, if any, is a study for the government of Japan.<br />
As you know, Asia is a highly complex region where<br />
interests of many big powers are intertwined.<br />
If we are to produce a truly effective machinery for<br />
effective co-operation, we need to exert tremendous efforts to<br />
produce many ideas.<br />
Speaking honestly, I don't think time is quite mature<br />
as yet, in my judgement, to produce any idea now, but I think<br />
it is a proposal that the government of Japan should continue<br />
to examine as a concept.<br />
Question: When do you see a target date, so to speak, by which<br />
you wish to complete discussion and preparation for this Nara<br />
Treaty? For example, can you foresee the signing of such a<br />
treaty by the time of the third meeting of this Committee<br />
next year?<br />
Mr Ohira: There has been no specific agreement between the two<br />
countries as to by when they should produce such a treaty.<br />
But we are to start our work immediately. </p>
<p>-8-<br />
I don't think there is a need for us to wait until<br />
the occasion of the third meeting next year of this Ministerial<br />
Committee. On the Japanese side we feel we must finish the work<br />
and coincide the treaty way before that.<br />
Mr Whitlam: I would agree with what Mr Ohira has said.<br />
There will be two occasions in Australia next year<br />
when Japanese Ministers will be present.<br />
One will be the third of the Ministerial M'eetings<br />
and there will also be, of course, the occasion, we expect, of<br />
the visit by the Prime Minister of Japan to Australia.<br />
It may well be that the treaty will be concluded before<br />
either event but it would be signed before or at either of those<br />
occasions. 0<br />
Question: What is the Japanese reaction to the Australian<br />
suggestion that although we don't want any overseas ownership<br />
of our energy resources, we still want their assistance both<br />
financially and technologically?<br />
Do you think Japanese interests would be prepared to<br />
put in money and technology to ensure a continuation of supply<br />
of these energy resources?<br />
Mr Ohira: Japan does not seek any ownership or control of<br />
natural resources. This is not only in Australia but with respect of any<br />
resources producing country.<br />
What Japan seeks is to assure herself of a stable<br />
supply of natural resources.<br />
Now, in trying to secure this supply, if the business<br />
interests concerned see that the economics favour such an<br />
arrangement in response to the request of the resources<br />
producing countries, then we should not sp~ areany efforts in<br />
extending our co-operation financially or technically. </p>
