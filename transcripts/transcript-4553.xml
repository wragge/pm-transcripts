ADELAIDE-. YOUTH RALLY 22 NO) VEMBER 1977<br />
The choice in this election is very clear. The choice is between<br />
the responsible policies of the government and the economic<br />
irresponsibility of Mr Whitlarn's proposals. The choice is between<br />
growth and develop-ment and the jobs these wil. l bring, and Labor's<br />
disastrous recipe for stagnation. The choice is between lower<br />
taxes to let Australians have more say over how their own money is<br />
spent and the dead hand of Labor's high taxation policy.<br />
This Government' s policies are workinq. W-e have broken through in Iche fight against<br />
inflation. Under Labor it reached a peak in 1974 of 19% this year it's been<br />
running at around 9.<br />
Mr Hawke is desperately claiming it is untrue to say inflation<br />
reached 191% under Labor. This is very surprising Mr H-awke should<br />
have had plenty of time -to read page 13 of Budget Statement Number 2<br />
published in August, which shows tha-t Labor's inflation did reach 19%.<br />
After all, during the Victorian power dispute Mr Hawke had plenty of<br />
time on his hands for-a bit of light reading. I understand that the<br />
Labor party are showing tonight, for the first tir~ ie and in living<br />
colour, their advertisement of Mr Hawk,. e in a motel room, hurriedlly<br />
packing his bags to go out and resolve ancother of his disputes.<br />
Well, in the case of the Victorian power dispute a dispute which<br />
caused 450,000 people to be laid off for weeks, which caused 36,000<br />
people to lose their jobs, which affected not only Victoria but other<br />
states including South Australia; it took Mr Hawke 9 weeks to pack his<br />
bages, gat out of his hotel room and take a hand.<br />
The reduction in inflation we have achieved is restoring business<br />
confidence confidence which is essential to beating unemrployment.<br />
Australia is ready to go with $ 6,00 millioin of investment which will<br />
* create more jobs bring more wealth to Australia.<br />
Because of our firm control over Government spendi4ng, intIIerest rates<br />
are now falling. This will help business to finance expansion and create<br />
more jobs. / 2 </p>
<p>, Pax indexation and our personal tax reforms which are alreadyLw<br />
have saved taxpayers $ 3,300 million. They are restoring incentive<br />
and giving Australians greater control over their incomes.<br />
our wages policy has made a significant contribution to reducing<br />
excess~ ie wage . increases wage increases that put people out of johs;<br />
that put companies out of businoss.<br />
our policies of assistance to business have protected tens of thousand., 3<br />
of jobs. We have protected the kind of jobs Mr Whitlam wiped out with<br />
a stroke of his pen in his 25% across-the-board tariff cut.<br />
He had before him an official report which told him this would wipe<br />
out 30, O00jobs, but he still quite deliberately went ahead with the<br />
tariff cuts; and that's not all. In July, at his national press club<br />
speech, Mr Whitlan, after all the devastation he has wrought on<br />
Australian industry, had the gall to say-<br />
" There is no doubt that Australian industry is excessively<br />
protected that is the basic trouble with our<br />
manufacturing industry".<br />
Well he's wrong again the basic problem with industry is the after<br />
effects of the Whitlam years.<br />
This government will have none of his policies. Unlike Labor, which<br />
bought overseas, we've adopted a policy of buying Australian wherever<br />
possiblp s~ o that there can be work for Australians.<br />
Our policies are working. We are doing the job we were elected to do.<br />
We are ready to break through into a new period of development and<br />
prosperity. This breakthrough would not occur under Labor.<br />
Mr Whitlam's proposals are a recipe for national disaster. Mr Whitlam<br />
proposes higher personal income taxes and higher marginal rates of<br />
taxation.<br />
Mr Whitlam proposes a massive increase in government expenditure. He<br />
himself admits he wants to spend an additional $ 800 million in his<br />
first six months, and that figure doesn't include any significant<br />
amount for what would be a very expensive and ineffective job subsidy<br />
scheme. This $ 000 million is only a start. Six of the many other programm~ es<br />
he wants to introduce will alone cost over $ 3 billion per year. / 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
Mr Whitlam's reaction tc any problem and this election is certainly<br />
a problem for him is to scatter money, your money, in add directions.<br />
Other pcople's money means nothing to Mr Thitam. Mr Whitlairm wants to<br />
abandon the policy of wage and salary restraint.<br />
Mr Whitlam has been forced by the trade unions the unions which fund the<br />
Labor party to support full wage indexation.<br />
This means more people being put out of jobs business being hit with<br />
ever higher wages and small businesses being hit particularly hard.<br />
Mr Whitlam still has the same progratme, the same policies that pushed<br />
inflation to a peak of 19% under Labor. The same policies which<br />
increased unemployment by almost 200,00 in just 12 months.<br />
Mr Whitlam wants to do it all over again, and his policies would hit<br />
Australia with higher taxes, higher interest rates, bigger wage bills<br />
and more unemployment. Labor hasn't changed! They are still divided,<br />
still incompetent.<br />
The Labor Party's policy speech is only five days old, but the Labor<br />
Party is already fighting about what it means.<br />
As they start to comprehend the full enormity of the pitfalls, loopholes,<br />
and injustices of their hastily thought-out schemes<br />
Mr Whitlam, Mr Hayden, and Mr HUrford are constantly refuting each<br />
other's interpretations and contradicting their own statements. Let's<br />
look at some of the major planks of their economic policy.<br />
Mr Whitlam is committed to abolish payroll tax, apparently about the start<br />
of 1978, or before the February reductions in personal income taxation<br />
come into force. As payroll tax this financial year is estimated at<br />
$ 1,700 million, this means Labor would have to find about half of that<br />
about $ 850 million for the second half of this financial year, and a<br />
further $ 1,900 million next financial year.<br />
To do this, Labor would increas the burden of personal tax falling on<br />
Australian taxpayers. They would have to raise $ 850 million in personal<br />
taxes in the first half of 1978, and $ 1,900 million more taxes in<br />
1978/ 79 and every year thereafter. That much is clear. But that is the<br />
only thing that Labor is clear about.<br />
On Sunday morning, Mr Whitlam began by saying that Labor would merely<br />
" postpone" the tax cuts coming in on February first. At Sunday lunchtime<br />
he said " he had made a mistake" that Labor would never bring in those<br />
tax cuts. Sunday afternoon, he said tax indexation would be " postponed"<br />
until income tax receipts rise sufficiently to offset the cost of payroll<br />
tax. By Sunday night he was saying perhaps he'd " expressed himself wrongly"<br />
Mr Whitlam now says he would" expect" full tax indexation sometime soon, but<br />
Mr Hurford is checking it. Poor Mr Hurford he's already been thrown out<br />
as Labor's economic spokesman, and now he's been sent scurrying off to<br />
try to deal with Labor's great gaffe! </p>
<p>The second plank of Labor's economic programme is its wages policy. In<br />
his policy speech, Mr tihitlam coini-mittedc Labir to " restore irntogrity to<br />
the wage indexation guidelines". That speech was only hours old when Mir<br />
Hayden said that meant support for -full wage indexation but only7 for<br />
people on less than average weekly earnings.<br />
By Sunday, Mr Whitlam was saying that Labor wanted full wage indexation<br />
for everyone. Mr Hayden confessed he might be wrong. " I feel I'm on<br />
shaky ground" he said. Ile said questions on wage indexation should be<br />
directed to Mr Willis. work in the economic area its a demarcation<br />
problem". So much for Mr Hayden as an economic manager!<br />
If hie believes wages policy is outside the economic area, he certainl~ y is<br />
on shaky ground. Labor has so many economic managers, that there ' s always<br />
a threat of a demarcation dispute.<br />
This sort of behaviour on Labor's part is typical of Labor's behaviour when<br />
they were in office. Labor was then the party of high taxation. They put<br />
personal income tax up 125% 0 in just three years. They have made it clear<br />
they are now the party of even higher taxes still.<br />
The tragedy of the sacrifice which Mr 11hitlam asks taxpayers to make, in<br />
voting for higher taxation is that the sacrifice would be utterly<br />
pointless. Mr Whitlam says his schemes will reduce inflation. In fact<br />
inflation will go up through the enormous cost of full wage indexation.<br />
Full indexation over 18 months would add five percent more to wage costs<br />
than two thirds indexation, which is about the level granted over the<br />
past two years. This would more than wipe out any anti-inflationary effectsJ<br />
of ending payroll tax.<br />
Mr Whitlam says his scheme will help business. In fact, it will bring n~ o<br />
benefit to the self-employed and tens of thousands of small businessmen<br />
who at present do not pay payroll tax. 1Ehat would happen is that they would<br />
be left with higher wages bills, and higher income tax, without any<br />
compensating effect in lower payroll tax. Their competitive position would<br />
be seriously eroded in relation to importers, overseas manufacturers and<br />
bigger companies. </p>
<p>Mr whitlam says his scheme will increase employm-ient. Even thaL: claim<br />
is false. As Mr Dunstan pointed out when he said in September:<br />
" The Government has already trieC, a payroll tax remission<br />
scheme and found that it does not create employment".<br />
Ever since this disastrous and ill-considered policy, was unveiled last<br />
week, I and other ministers have constantly pointed out its host of<br />
inequities and inconsistencies. Serious doubts about the im plications<br />
of the policy have been raised in the press. Not a single labor<br />
spokesman has mounted a reasoned argument to defend the policy on its<br />
merits. They refuse to think througih the consequences of their hastily<br />
conceived plan. Mere emotionalism on this vital issue is not enough.<br />
The tragedy of Labor's crash unemployment programme is that within<br />
a very short time it would actually increase unemployment in this country.<br />
Until such time as Mr Whitlam is prepared to answer the barrage of<br />
criticisms which have been made by the Government and by financial<br />
commentators, their policy simply cannot be taken seriously. It can' t<br />
even be said that their policy has been poorly thought out it has not<br />
been thougrht out all.<br />
The Government's policies tackle the real causes of unemployment, by<br />
successfully getting inflation do~ wn by arguing consistently against<br />
high wages increases and by taking a fair b: ut resolute stand against<br />
industrial disruption, by giving business incentives to invest and grow.<br />
The combined effect of all these policies is starting to have a major<br />
impact. After this year's school leavers join the Labour Market in<br />
February, unemployment will fall and keep on steadily falling..<br />
Throughout this period, our care and concern for those out of work., and<br />
who genuinely want to work, has been very real. We have established<br />
a number~ of programmes to help people very many of them young people<br />
to find jobs and get essential retraining; the NEAT scheme, the special<br />
Youth Employment Training Programme, the Community Youth Support Scheme,<br />
Relocation Assistance, the CRAFT Scheme for apprentices.<br />
We are spending more than $ 100 million on these schemes this year, and<br />
more will be spent if necessary because no el~ igible unemployed person<br />
will be turned away. More than 120,000 people have already benefitted<br />
from these schemes.<br />
In the policy speech last night, I announced an expansion of an education<br />
programme for young unemployed people. This programme has already been<br />
tested most successfully in pilot schemes. It has been found most<br />
ef * fective in helping young people to acquire the basic skills<br />
necessary to get a job, and perhaps even more, to get the motivation<br />
necessary to get a job and keep it.<br />
We have significantly enlarged the programme to provide courses for all<br />
young people under 21 seeking employment, and eligibility will be extended<br />
to include unemployed youth in the 21 to 24 age group. </p>
<p>Last night I also announced improvements to the NEAT scheme and<br />
the relocation assistance scheme. In the case of the special Youth<br />
Employment Scheme, which is part of NEAT, we will seek the cooperation of:<br />
the States in providing training in technical schools and colleges, for<br />
young people seeking on-the-job training for whom no vacancies are<br />
immediately available. Above all, the certainty and confidence our<br />
po. icies have provided are letting businesses plan confidently for<br />
the future. </p>
<p>$ 6 billion of development' projects are now underway or ready to<br />
go and they will create jobs all around Australia. Let me emphasise<br />
one point which is often overlooked a continuation of our<br />
policies is not only essential to beat unemployment, it is also<br />
essential to providing meaningful assistance to those in real need1.<br />
The fact is that responsible economic policies are essenti al to<br />
give genuine assistance to low income and disadvantaged people.<br />
Labor's policies of higher wages, higlter rates, higher inflation,<br />
are a presceiption for increasing poverty in Australia. This is<br />
what Labor did in office as the Henderson Poverty Report so clearly<br />
shows, and they would do it all again.<br />
One of the great myths that Labor likes to create is that it is<br />
the party that cares for the disadvantaged. In office they were<br />
the party of enquiries, commissions, task forces and talk. They<br />
talked while inflation raged and those on low incomes suffered<br />
cruelly. This Government has acted to help the poor in Australia.<br />
our care and concern for the least privileged is-not to be found<br />
simply in the pages of Hansard, but in programme after programme<br />
which we have introduced. Our family allowances have enormously<br />
improved the condition of 300,000 poor families who got no assistance<br />
from Mr. Whitlam. From February 1st, our tax reforms will exempt<br />
an additional 225,000 low income people from paying any income tax.<br />
Mr. Whitlan will abolish this reform. Labor would compel nearly<br />
a quarter of a million pensioners, widows, students and others to<br />
pay tax once again.<br />
We have taken politics out of old age pensions and all other social<br />
welfare and repatriation pensions by increasing them automatically<br />
in line with inflation. We have brought in assistance for all<br />
sole parents. For the first time, lone fathers are getting sorely<br />
needed help. We have given the handicapped a new deal and we will<br />
end the injustice of the parents of handicapped children paying<br />
more for their children's education. Labor has talked a lot we<br />
have acted. Let the people of Australia judge which Government<br />
has done more which party really cares for those most in need.<br />
The same applies in the vital area of conservation. Labor was<br />
prepared to abandon Fraser Island we have secured this remarkable<br />
wilderness for posterity. We are establishing the largest national<br />
park in the world in the magnificent Arnhem Land country the<br />
Kakadu National Park. We are determined to take effective action<br />
to preserve all special of whales. We have established an<br />
independent inquiry to determine the most effective ways of doing<br />
this. In our responsible decisions on uranium mining, we have<br />
adopted all. the environmental safeguards recommended by the Fox Inquiry.,<br />
We are helping the World Wildlife Fund to set up a branch in Australia.<br />
There has never been an Australian Government which has acted more<br />
effectively to conserve our wilderness and wildlife. Across the<br />
whole range of areas of social concern, this Government has acted<br />
effectively, sensitively and responsibly.<br />
There is one great issue in this election it is whether Australia<br />
is going to continue on the path of responsible tax reforms<br />
responsible wages policy; responsible government spending; lower<br />
interest rates and falling inflation; the path of economic<br />
recovery; or whether Australia is to return to the high tax,<br />
extravagant government spending, excessive wage increase, and<br />
high interest rate policies Mr. t1hitlam is proposing. The policies<br />
which breed inflation and unemployment the policies which now<br />
lie as usual in a state of confusion. </p>
<p>7.<br />
The choice is between the policy confusion of Labor and the known<br />
and effective strategy of the Government between policies which<br />
damage the weakest sections of the conLmunity and policies which<br />
lay the basis for effective assistance.<br />
The great potential of Australia is opening up once again. Our future<br />
is unlimited if we pursue policies which respect individual freedom<br />
and encourage individual initiative the same policies which<br />
permit help that really means something to those in need.<br />
rhe Government knows that it is vitally important for the future<br />
of Australia that young people, this sumner and in the future,<br />
have ready opportunities for decent well paid jobs. I know that<br />
the course we are on is the best one the only one to achieve<br />
this. That course involves maintaining the pressure on inflation,<br />
and control of Government spending, control on the money supply.<br />
With this policy there will be sustained, upward growth in<br />
employment. The Opposition's path of big increases in Government spending, of<br />
big increases in the money supply, of big increases in taxation,<br />
is a path offering an instant solution, based on outdated and failed<br />
ideas. They tried this same policy in 1974-75 and it failed then.<br />
Other countries tried and it failed. Most countries in a position<br />
similar to that of Australia have abandoned the solutions based on<br />
high Government spending. The gains to employment through Government<br />
subsidy on Government spending which might be achieved with this<br />
policy are short lived. They are rapidly offset by the contracting<br />
employment opportunities which accompany the escalating inflation.<br />
here has been no major, quick solution to our problems. Progress<br />
towards our objective of good long term growth has necessarily had<br />
to be a moderate pace. It has had to be a pace which would not, I<br />
repeat not, refuel the fires of inflation.<br />
But I can tell you now that after two years of difficult decisions,<br />
we are ready to move into a new period of hard won success. </p>
