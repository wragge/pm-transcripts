OPENING ADDRESS BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
HON. R. J. L. HAWKE, M. P.,<br />
NATIONAL TAXATION SUIMIT -CANBERRA 1 JULY 1985<br />
It is with sincere pleasure that I welcome you all to<br />
the nation's capital to take part in this historic<br />
National Taxation Summit Conference. And I do so not<br />
only on behalf of the Australian Government, but on<br />
behialf of the Australian people.<br />
Your presence here, your participation in this<br />
Conference, represents in itself a remarkable<br />
demonst1ration of the strength and vigour of the<br />
Australian democracy and the Australian democratic<br />
process. The uitimate significance of this Conference goes beyond<br />
the all-important question of reform of the Australian<br />
tax system. For I1 believe that such a Conference on<br />
such a fundamental question one that affects almost<br />
every aspect of the life and we~ ll-being of the nation<br />
and its people could be held only in a country<br />
confident in itself, confident in the ' strength of its<br />
democratic institutions, and profoundly confident in its<br />
future.<br />
Such a Conference for such a purpose could only be<br />
called together, with expectations of a positive<br />
contribution to tax reform, in a country characterised<br />
by a deep, underlying, sense of mutual confidence.<br />
It involves mutual confidence between Government and<br />
people: a people with confidence in the Sincerity,<br />
integrity and responsiveness of their elected Government<br />
as the instrument for the fulfilment of their hopes and<br />
aspirations, for themselves, their families and their<br />
nation; and a Gove'rnment genuinely prepared to consult,<br />
to listen, to share knowledge, information and<br />
experience, confident in its own integrity of purpose<br />
and above all, confident in the intelligence and<br />
maturity of the people. </p>
<p>It is on that basis of mutual confidence that this<br />
Summit has assembled. It is on that basis, of mutual<br />
confidence, that I am sure we here, in our<br />
representative capacities, will proceed over the comin'<br />
week. And my confidence that this will happen reflects some of<br />
my deepest convictions about the character and<br />
capacities of the Australian people.<br />
Since the presentation of the Draft White Paper on<br />
Taxation Reform, an enormous range and diversity of<br />
views, have emerged. But there has been one common<br />
factor, notably on' the part of the groups and<br />
organisations which have already held meetings to<br />
discuss the issue or have made submissions to this<br />
Summit. I mention, by way of example, the meetings of<br />
business groups, the trade unions, welfare<br />
organisations, Labor Party State Conferences and the<br />
women's conference here in Canberra last weekend.<br />
For all the inevitable divergence of views at this<br />
stage, the common factor in all those deliberations has<br />
been a recognition of the seriousness of the issue and<br />
an earnestness of approach in the quest for significant<br />
and lasting reform of the Australian taxation system.<br />
And I am confident that that earnestness of approach<br />
will characterise this Summit and continue throughout<br />
this Summit.<br />
I have stressed the role of this Summit as part of a<br />
democratic process uniquely Australian.<br />
And I mean that, in both a general and specific sense.<br />
Specifically, this Summit as with the entire process<br />
of tax reform derives its legitimacy from the will of<br />
the Australian people, as expressed in the national<br />
elections on 1 December 1984.<br />
It is of fundamental importance that thi s fact should be<br />
established from the outset of this Conference, because<br />
it is of central relevance to-its purpose.<br />
The Summit itself was undertaken as a crucial part of<br />
the processv by which the Australian Labor Government<br />
would fulfil the undertaking I gave to the people of<br />
Australia in these terms:<br />
A genuine reform of the Australian tax system to<br />
promote growth and to ensure that the benefits of<br />
that growth are fairly shared and bring lasting<br />
relief on personal income taxes to the millions of<br />
ordinary Australian taxpayers. </p>
<p>I invite you to remember that commitment in its<br />
totality. There is a definite linkage between ensuring<br />
continued growth fairly shared and tax reform.<br />
But let me at once emphasise this point : we say as a<br />
Government that genuine and lasting tax reform is<br />
central to ourmandate from the people, and that this<br />
Summit is an integral part of the process we undertook<br />
to achieve that reform. Nevertheless we do not claim<br />
for a moment that this Summit Conference has any prior<br />
obligation to endorse the specific proposals we as a<br />
Government, have put as the best way we believe we can<br />
fulfil our mandate from the people and carry ont the<br />
covenant we have made with the people.<br />
At this Summit, I ceaffirm our. commitment to the<br />
totality of their mandate. And that of course, means<br />
reaffirming our commitment to the nine principles on<br />
which we undertook to base both the process and the<br />
program of tax reform.<br />
In return, I'now seek from the participants in the<br />
Summit, and from all Australians a commitment to<br />
rational, calm discussion and genuine examination of<br />
proposals. In particular, I ask that any components of<br />
alternative packages be examined as part of the wholeand<br />
not .1* iisolation.<br />
We have asked you to come here to be a crucial part of a<br />
continuing process in the long and difficult road to tax<br />
reform. Indeed, this is a road which has led directly from the<br />
original Summit the historic National Economic Summit<br />
in April 1983.<br />
The need for tax reform was recognised in the Summit<br />
Communique as an essential part of the long-term task of<br />
national recovery, reconciliation and reconstruction.<br />
The Economic Planning Advisory Council . the ongoing<br />
machinery established by the Summit set tax reform as<br />
a major priority in the work of achieving sustained<br />
non-inflationary growth.<br />
In our preparation for this Summit, we have sought to<br />
discharge our obligations in the same way as we did at<br />
the Economic Summit the obligation to provide the<br />
information on which informed judgements can be made,<br />
the obligation to Indicate how we believe the<br />
community's objectives can best be achieved, and then<br />
in the actual working of the Summit the obligation to<br />
listen, to enter into a genuine dialogue, a genuine and<br />
meaningful exchange of information, views and ideas. </p>
<p>4-<br />
Equally, I stress at all times that this Conference and<br />
the outcome we hope from it, is in no way intended to be<br />
a substitute for the decisions and policies which must<br />
be the ultimate responsibility of the elected Government<br />
alone.<br />
But we have ' always believed that effective policy cannot<br />
be made in a vacuum. Wle do not believe that in so<br />
complex a matter as tax reform we are the fount of all<br />
wisdom; or the repository of all available knowledge,<br />
especially as to how specific proposals may impact upon<br />
the daily lives of particular individuals, groups or<br />
interests, on whose behalf you yourselves are c elegated<br />
to speak.<br />
The very purpose of this Summit is to expose us all, not<br />
least those of us with direct responsibility for<br />
government decision-making, to part11icular viewpoints as<br />
well as the wider realities.<br />
Nevertheless, if we are best to serve, individually and<br />
collectively; both. those we represent and the community<br />
as a whole, it will require, from each of us, some<br />
capacity for the broader view and some tempering of<br />
narrower short-term sectional interests, with a sense of<br />
a wider, long-term, national interest.<br />
I have put the Government's commitment to achieving<br />
significant tax reform in the context of the clear<br />
man~ date we sought and received from the people of<br />
Australia at the last elections.<br />
But in truth it would be a trivialisation of so<br />
important and far-reaching a matter as tax reform if it<br />
were to be viewed solely through the focus of the last<br />
election or for-that matter, the next election.<br />
Issues do not emerge at an election from a vacuum. They<br />
reflect reality; or at the very least, public<br />
perceptions of reality.<br />
Tax reform is central to our commitment to the people<br />
because it is central to the economic and social<br />
objectives of a Government committed to growth, equity<br />
and efficiency.<br />
But just as important, it is a problem perceived by the<br />
overwhelming majority of the Australian people and<br />
correctly perceived by them as impinging heavily and<br />
directly on their legiti'mate hopes for a better life in<br />
a fairer and more " efficient society.<br />
It is not a problem that can be responsibly or<br />
rationally approached by reference to election<br />
timetables, past or future. </p>
<p>The overriding consideration and the starting-off<br />
point for meaningful, relevant, rational debate, here<br />
this week and throughout the community in the weeks and<br />
months to come must be a realisation of the dimensions<br />
of the problem and a recognition of the consequences of<br />
doing nothing..<br />
In particular, we all must have a clear understanding of<br />
the consequences of failure to achieve significant tax<br />
reforia for the millions of ordinary Australian taxpayers<br />
the middle and lower income earners who are bearing<br />
the brunt of the massively increased reliance on<br />
personal income tax under the existing system.<br />
Today 39 percent of full-time earners in the workforce<br />
are paying income tax at the 46 cents marginal rate.<br />
Without significant reform, that number will be far in<br />
excess of 50 percent within 3 years. There would be 3<br />
million out of the five and a half million full-time<br />
earners paying the 46 cents marginal rate. That is, we<br />
are approaching the situation where for more than half<br />
the workforcb, every extra dollar in the pay packet will<br />
be eroded by almost half.<br />
Thirty years ago, the upper income earners those above<br />
the present-day equivalent of $ 35,000 paid more tha~ n<br />
half the personal income tax collected in Australia.<br />
Now, those in the upper income range account for only<br />
percent. And what has happened, of course, is not only that<br />
average earners are being pushed into the higher<br />
marginal tax brackets, but as PAYE taxpayers, they are<br />
bearing the burden of the tax avoidance devices,<br />
available mainly to tLhe wealthier sections of the<br />
community. It is true tChat tax avoidance and evasion on the massive<br />
scale which was allowed to take root and flourish from<br />
the mid-1970' s transformed the personal tax system from<br />
a genuinely progressive system to a flagrantly<br />
regressive one, as it is exploited by some of the<br />
wealthiest and the most privilfeged sections of the<br />
community. For its part, the Government will continue its attack on<br />
tax avoidance and evasion which has become the most<br />
regressive aspect of our tax sy'stem.<br />
The Draft White Paper foreshadows further measures to<br />
extend that fight. </p>
<p>-6-<br />
But it would deny all known experience to imagine that<br />
changes in laws and regulations, however desirable in<br />
themselves, can provide a lasting solution to the<br />
problems of avoidance and evasion.<br />
The Draft White Paper points to one of the most serious<br />
aspects of this problem. It is not just the problem of<br />
a huge revenue loss.<br />
The Draft White Paper shows how, as a direct and almost<br />
inevitable result of the operation of the present<br />
system, tax avoidance is becoming endemic and threatens<br />
to become entrenched almost as part of a way oi. life for<br />
a significant part of our great nation.<br />
And that is something even more serious than the loss of<br />
revenue involved, because it goes to a loss in our<br />
national character, a loss to the quality and standards<br />
of our national life.<br />
It will be seen, therefore, that in preparing for this<br />
Summit, and in our overall approach to the task of tax<br />
reform, we have had at the forefront of our concerns the<br />
need to restore equity, efficiency and integrity to the<br />
Australian taxation system.<br />
It is becoming a system increasingly deficient in each<br />
of those fundamental qualities.<br />
The Draft White Paper addresses itself comprehensively<br />
to these deficiencies and puts forward the Government's<br />
proposals to combat them.<br />
Of those proposals, the Government's preferred course is<br />
expressed in Approach C.<br />
It contains, we believe, the elements required to<br />
achieve significant tax reform and the most effective<br />
way of achieving a fairer, simpler tax system which<br />
contributes to sustained economic growth.<br />
Again, I emphasise the need to examine the proposal as a<br />
whole to see itas a package.<br />
The proposals for broadening the income tax base and for<br />
introducing a broad-based consumption tax can not be<br />
isolated from the substantial " reductions in personal<br />
taxation they make possible. Neither of these<br />
interdependent proposals can be separated from the<br />
compensation provi * sions'which are an equally integral<br />
part of the total package.<br />
No section of the Draft White Paper was accorded a<br />
higher priority or-greater attention to detail than that<br />
dealing with compensation for the disadvantaged and for<br />
low income earners. </p>
<p>-7<br />
As a Government:, we are convinced that this section of<br />
our community would not only be adequately compensated<br />
but woulLa be significantly advantaged by the changes<br />
proposed in Approach C.<br />
Since the release of the White Paper, the Australian<br />
community has made it clear that it, too, shares the<br />
Government's concern about compensation and insists that<br />
the Government be very certain that any change in the<br />
taxation system does not disadvantage that section of<br />
the community least able to protect itself.<br />
Accordingly, I now give this und ertaking : under<br />
Approach C, the Government would establish an<br />
independent monitoring authority to gauge carefully the<br />
effect of tax reform. Its function would be to ensure<br />
that, should there be any unforeseen effects to the<br />
detriment of those in the lower income areas, they would<br />
be drawn quickly to our attention, to be rectified at<br />
once.<br />
We believe that all the necessary protections have been<br />
included in the proposal. But we recognise that all<br />
Australians require an assurance that the least<br />
privileged among us will not suffer as a result of the<br />
changes. And I give that assurance unreservedly.<br />
Further, we understand the concerns of Australians and<br />
particularly Australian housewives about price rises<br />
which could not be justified by any changes in the tax<br />
system.<br />
We have faith that the great bulk of the Australian<br />
business community would play the game fdirly and not<br />
seek to exploit changes for unfair or unrecessary gain.<br />
We would be actively seeking the co-operation of<br />
business and the States to ensure that this would not<br />
occur. There are two final points I sh ould wish to make of<br />
great relevance to the conduct of this Summit. The<br />
White Paper makes it clear that our proposals for tax<br />
reform are revenue-neutral, although the vast majority<br />
of taxpayers would be better off. I cannot stress too<br />
strongly that tax reform is not about increasing taxescertainly<br />
not tax reform'proposed by this Government.<br />
On the contrary, iC is precisely because the present<br />
system has allowed Governments over the years to<br />
increase the tax burden by stealth, that reform has<br />
become so urgent. </p>
<p>8-<br />
And second, we recognise as a Government that the<br />
overall level of taxation is a reflection of the overall<br />
level of Government expenditure. We have demonstrated<br />
as a Government our commitment to expenditure restraint<br />
including through our trilogy commitment and in the May<br />
Statement. We will continue to exercise that restraint<br />
as central to the achievement of our economic objectives<br />
for this nation, consistent with our broader obligations<br />
as a Government.<br />
In indicating the Government's preferred course, I again<br />
emphasise that we do not come to this Summit with a<br />
closed mind on any aspect of the Draft White Paper. And<br />
I would hope that that will be the reciprocal attitude<br />
of all the participants at this Summit.<br />
Clearly, given the size and complexity of the problem,<br />
it would be unrealistic to expect complete agreement at<br />
this Summit about the best means of achieving tax<br />
reform.<br />
But it wouldt be a tragedy for Australia if there were no<br />
tax reform at all because each political group and every<br />
interest group, each from its own entrenched position,<br />
was insisting on its version of the best package.<br />
We can riot underestimate the magnitude of the task.<br />
We all know that the main reason why tax reform has so<br />
lcng been ignored, is that it is hard.<br />
But the threatened breakdown in the Australian tax<br />
system can be prevented only if we have the courage and<br />
confidence to act now.<br />
It is certainly in that spirit that the Australian<br />
Government approaches this great task.<br />
It is a test for us all certainly for the Government,<br />
for all of us here at this historic Summit, and for the<br />
people of Australia themselves.<br />
In a very real sense, it involves a test of the<br />
Australian character itself. -it will be a test of our<br />
maturity. It will be a test of our intelligence, it<br />
will be a test of our commonsense. It will be a test of<br />
our capacity for enlightened self-interest. It will be<br />
a test of the sincerity of our claims as a nation to be<br />
a people who believe in' the fair go and the fair sharing<br />
of both opportunities and obligations. </p>
<p>9<br />
And it is precisely because of my confidence, my<br />
deepest-held belief in the reality of those qualities in<br />
the Australian people, that we have embarked upon this<br />
course, knowing all the pitfalls and pressures and<br />
difficulties; and why I am absolutely confident of an<br />
ultimate outcome which will be of enduring service and<br />
benefit to all the people of Australia.<br />
My friends, we know there is one thing upon which we and<br />
the overwhelming majority of our fellow Australians<br />
agree the existing tax system is distintegrating to<br />
the point where it has ceased to be either fair or<br />
efficient.<br />
Ours is the responsibility to approach with resolution<br />
the task of examining the ways towards the creation of a<br />
new system which will meet the legitimate aspirations of<br />
our people.<br />
Let us now set about that task. </p>
