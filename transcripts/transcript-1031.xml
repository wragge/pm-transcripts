FOR PRESS RINE MINISILR'S COMMENT ON SlE<br />
ELECTION iRESULTS<br />
The results are by no means final. But<br />
so far, they show that the Government candidates hive<br />
polled well and that our defence policy has certainly<br />
been approved. Our authority, on behalf of the people,<br />
is thus affirmed. lhoat is more important is that we<br />
continue to carry great responsibilities, which it will<br />
be our supreme duty to discharge with energy and clarity<br />
of mind and purpose.<br />
