TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
JOINT PRESS CONFERENCE WITH LAURIE BRERETON, MINISTER FOR<br />
INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS AND MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT,<br />
MELBOURNE, 19 JANUARY 1996<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
PMV: Today, Laurie Brereton and I are publishing a statement on our policy<br />
on Industrial Relations. It's called Flexibility and Fairness At Work, it's<br />
a hIstory of the process of consensual iincomes policy, a history of the<br />
Accor4 from 1983 about how the labour market has worked in the<br />
years, what each Accord did, how it has produced a competitive<br />
outward looking, low inflation, high growth economy, strong growth in<br />
fact, and increased real wages. And we're doing it to make clear how<br />
novel and unique this policy Is in the world, that no other developed<br />
country has pursued such a policy and when one looks at the rates of<br />
growth which we've had during these twelve years compared with the<br />
previous seven years of the Coalition, we've doubled the rate of<br />
economic growth in Australia and yet we've had a very large decline in<br />
inflation. This Is an almighty achievement. Show me any country<br />
where the rate of growth picks up to twice the speed and you'll see a<br />
country with a lot of prosperity, and you can see that now in the stock<br />
market, we can see it in the general sense of employment growth, we<br />
can see it around the world.<br />
In recent months I've quoted Robert Reich, the US Labour Secretary,<br />
who talked about the conundrum of US policy, saying we've had a lot<br />
of job growth in the United States but we've got an army of working<br />
poor because there's no gatekeeper, there's no-one looking out for the<br />
low paid, there are no standards and he made the point that in Europe<br />
they've got rigidities and standards but the rigidities are such that they<br />
can't get the aggregate employment growth, so there's very low<br />
employment growth In Europe, quite high employment growth in<br />
America but quite low wages growth, falling real wages. In Australia,<br />
we've had the best of both worlds. Strong employment growth, rising<br />
real wages and rising household disposable income so we must be<br />
doing something right, we think we're doing something very right here.<br />
And as the Coalition and their leader has this month made clear that<br />
industrial relations and their view of it is a major issue for them so too </p>
<p>have we taken the opportunity to say exactly were the Government<br />
stands in terms of the labour market, what our philosophy is, what the<br />
record is and where we'll be going in the future.<br />
I might invite Laurie at this point to add to and complement my own<br />
words of introduction.<br />
LIS: Thank you Paul. There is no doubt this statement reveals in detail the<br />
Labor way, the way we've gone about pursuing industrial relations<br />
through the life of the Government and it's really the reality of the<br />
Labor way In contrast with the rhetoric of the last couple of weeks of<br />
John Howard and Peter Reith.<br />
The Labor way of course is known to everyone, it's embodied in the<br />
Accord, every Accord from 1 through to Accord Mark 8 and it's<br />
embodied In the Industrial Relations Reform Act which has now been<br />
operating for law of this nation for almost two years. Everything you<br />
need to know about the Labor way is in this document, everything that<br />
the electorate needs to know about their security in employment is<br />
raised in this document and the Industrial Relations Reform Act. It's<br />
the forrula that has given us high growth, given us high productivity,<br />
Its gil~ en us low inflation and its given us record low industrial<br />
disputation. It's a system that the Opposition of course, as the Prime<br />
Minister said this morning, now wish to radically after. They won't give<br />
us more than the rhetoric but I think this document makes a very stark<br />
contrast between the reality of Labor and the unknown and the<br />
uncertainty of what you would have with a change to the system with<br />
the removal of the role of the industrial umpire with this new world of<br />
John Howard's of Australian workplace agreements which are now<br />
revealed not as agreements at all, not collectively reached but simply<br />
individual contracts under another name.<br />
J* Prime Minister you suggested In your speech today that you gave the<br />
example of where the IRC would not be able to operate under a<br />
Coalition government, yet my understanding of their policy is that the<br />
role of the IRC has been downgraded in wage fixation but it would still<br />
be there In terms of industrial disputes. On what basis'do you suggest<br />
this and are you saying that's what will happen under a Howard<br />
government?<br />
LB: If I could answer that. It's very clear that under a system of Australian<br />
workplace agreements outlined by John Howard re individual<br />
contracts, there is no role whatsoever for the Industrial Relations<br />
Commission because their role of vetting agreements, as they do at<br />
the moment. by applying a specific set of quite strict tests, to make<br />
sure workers are not disadvantaged in that the no disadvantage test is<br />
fully applied before the agreement comes into existence, would be out<br />
the window. This is a power that is being removed from the<br />
Commission, it's one thing to say.. </p>
<p>PM: About conditions, wages and conditions, it's a different basis, what<br />
he's making is a different basis on which they will be set in which the<br />
Commission does not have a role.<br />
LB: That's right and if the Commission cannot deal with the totality of the<br />
problem and we have a Commission that fortunately today can, can<br />
deal with the dispute, can use It's arbitral powers in this area of<br />
contract employment, if it sees fit on a special case basis then what<br />
have you got, you've got Industrial mayhem and you've got no solution<br />
to what this nation faced in December of last year.<br />
J: Mr Brereton will you be changing this policy or refining in any way in<br />
the lead up to the election or would you<br />
LB: I think our policy is absolutely clear, it's outlined in this document and<br />
of course it's embodied in the Industrial Relations Reform Act. Where<br />
it's been necessary, we've made a number of amendments to that Act,<br />
one of which was to simplify the dealings With unfair dismissal so as to<br />
make them as non-legalistic as possible and I might say that that was<br />
a chanqe welcomed by employer groups in Australia, but it's a change<br />
that of course does not satisfy John Howard who said even as altered,<br />
he would remove those safeguards and destroy the protections<br />
avallable to Australian working men and women.<br />
So not only would we have on the one hand individual contracts, but<br />
on the other, we'd have the right of the Commission to deal with unfair<br />
dismissals using the powers, the external affairs power, greatly<br />
reduced.<br />
J: So that's...?<br />
LB: This is our policy and the Industrial Relations Act is our way.<br />
J: Mr Keating if the Opposition Will continually hammer the theme that<br />
one of the costs of the Accord in relation to business the Government<br />
Is continually kowtowing to the ACTU, how do you feel of that issue, on<br />
ANL and things like that?<br />
PM: How many Heads of Government around the world would like to, as Mr<br />
Howard put it, kowtow to their unions for a two and a half per cent<br />
Inflation rate? This is the sort of nonsense he goes on with about the<br />
Government kowtowing to unions as if there is some sort of runaway<br />
trade union movement. I mean it's a contradiction in terms to say<br />
there is some sort of runaway power In the trade union movement with<br />
the inflation rate between 2 and 3 per cent. It was 11I under him and<br />
you see, they won't step back and recognise the fact, the ideology Is<br />
so strong, they won't say well look maybe the Government's come up<br />
with something In a decade. Twice the rate of economic growth is a </p>
<p>big achievement, I mean look at Germany, they're starting to slow<br />
down now they think somewhere between I and 2 per cent for the<br />
coming year. Look at a lot of these industrial economies, they're<br />
growing in Australian terms quite slowly, yet we have doubled the rate<br />
of growth that existed under the Coalition and we've cut inflation<br />
markedly. Now these things can only be consistent with good wage<br />
setting and wage fixing procedures. Ones which have an eye to<br />
productivity and I gave the details in the speech, since 1991, since the<br />
New Zealand individual wage contract legislation was introduced, New<br />
Zealand productivity has gone up by I per cent, labour productivity in<br />
Australia by 2 and a half. In New Zealand there has been I per cent<br />
wages growth in Australia there has been 5 and I think you'd think the<br />
Coalition would sit back and say well something good is happening<br />
here, I mean something novel is being done, but they want to tip it out<br />
and they want to go back to a system without collectivity, without the<br />
right of people to bargain in a collective way. They want to push<br />
people back to a labour market were the employers have the<br />
bargaining strength and an individual person is left to the vagaries of<br />
the courts.<br />
J: Prime f1inister, following the last election that when you suggested<br />
you Were going to move further on the labour market deregulation, are<br />
you pledging and Mr Brereton that this is the policy, it will not be<br />
changing after the election and you will not be moving to free up the<br />
labour market any further than it is?<br />
PM: I think that some of the people who Will write about that speech read<br />
Into it things that they want to see, in fact what was there was the<br />
policy we now have and what we've seen under this Government is a<br />
movement away from a centralised system to firstly a big change to the<br />
structure of awards, a radical restructuring of awards and then<br />
amalgamation of unions and then to a system of enterprise bargains<br />
which are productivity based with the safety net underpinning it, that's<br />
where we've moved. If you go through this document you'll see in the<br />
various Accords where we started to move away from the centralised<br />
system In a sort of evolutionary way towards an enterprise bargaining<br />
based system. This is the point that John Howard has never<br />
understood, to get wage flexibil ' ity you must have it in a way which is<br />
non-disruptive anid ' where all of the community feel they're<br />
stakeholders in the process, that's what we have done. This idea that<br />
you can cold turkey the system, that's what he tried to do and said he<br />
was doing in the late 1970' s, and early 1980' s, letting it rip. Well it<br />
ripped all right, what we had was a wage explosion and then a wages<br />
collapse and double digit inflation and double digit unemployment.<br />
What the Government has done has moved the system towards an<br />
enterprise bargaining based system, wbat we're saying in here when<br />
we talk about the future, on page 3 of the document, we're saying in<br />
the future we Will see continuing workplace reform to improve<br />
efficiency and flexibility through the extension of bargaining and further </p>
<p>reform of awards, sustained commitment to ensuring fairness and<br />
effective protection through to the safety net etc. In other words we<br />
are seeing tremendous sophistication in our enterprise bargains and I<br />
just don't think the Coalition knows about this or understands it and<br />
that's why such a high proportion of federal employees covered by<br />
federal awards are now part of a bargain so the consistency, I think it's<br />
worth just looking through at page 10 of this document where under<br />
the Accords 1, 2, 3, 4, you can see where we're starting to shift away<br />
from centralised system to an enterprise bargaining system and that's<br />
going to continue but we're getting there without industrial disruption<br />
and we're getting there with all the appropriate sensible protections.<br />
J: In some areas, Prime Minister, wages in fact are starting to grow too<br />
fast now under this system, are you sharing that view?<br />
PM: Well, no, what we want is a high wage low inflation economy, what<br />
John Howard wants is a low wage low inflation economy, that's the<br />
difference and I mean I just spent a day or two in Singapore and there,<br />
the average wage, that's national income per capita Is running at<br />
$ 31,000. Now they haven't run a low inflation country by pushing<br />
wages Pown, they haven't decided to deal with competitors in Asia by<br />
having a low labour cost country, that's Mr Howard's view, it's always<br />
been his view, what we've always said lers educate our people,<br />
produce innovative products, get a premium for them and increase our<br />
wages. Real wage Increasing but we're seeing still the control of<br />
underlying inflation which means there is productivity in the middle.<br />
J: Now that<br />
PM: I think it's very hard to say, some of it has been the fact of the relative<br />
growth of the services sector of the economy which has been more<br />
difficult to organise I think, but certainly the growth is there. The most<br />
telling statistic I used this morning was household disposable Income<br />
per capita at 21 per cent over the period, I mean that's the most telling<br />
statistic I think about the history of Labor in Government in terms of<br />
Incomes in Australia.<br />
J: Should the Government be paying attention to Union membership<br />
declining so rapidly?<br />
PM: No, I think that is for employees and their organisations to attend to<br />
and to worry about and you know, in some of the areas, in hospitality<br />
for instance which had enormous growth in employment in the 80' s it<br />
was largely unorganised, I mean they were not, those people were not<br />
joined up, and as a consequence In that part of the economy it<br />
dropped.<br />
J: But doesn't that mean, we have declining union membership, doesn't<br />
that mean that many of these people are not covered by any </p>
<p>agreement registered before the Commission the only alternative<br />
they have is the Court system anyway?<br />
LB: No, on the contrary, under the Federal system almost 60 per cent are<br />
in agreements and all are covered by an award so they've got the<br />
comprehensiveness of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission<br />
overseeing the whole of their working arrangements.<br />
J. The Liberals that with the IRC and the award system..<br />
LB: Not at all because they'll introduce an alternative which they call<br />
Australian Workplace Agreements which are in reality individual<br />
contracts which will be optional and will be used to undermine the<br />
whole Integrity of the system because any new employee will be faced<br />
with the choice ' take the contract or you don't get the job' and as the<br />
Prime Minister said in his speech this morning, with 1.7 million<br />
Australian workers facing a new employer every year with 40 per cent<br />
of the whole Australian workforce facing a new employer in the course<br />
of one 3 year term of Parliament, It won't be very long at all before not<br />
only new employees but all employees would find themselves under<br />
contracl arrangements rather than the* comprehensive safeguards of<br />
the Australian Industrial Relations System.<br />
J: Independent research indicates that up to a third of workplaces have<br />
Informal agreements anyway as the situation works and you've only<br />
got about a 100 EFA's so isn't that the situation in any case in reality<br />
LB: No because we've got a comprehensive award system, one indeed<br />
that's being updated at the moment, as you well know the Commission<br />
have started their review, the insertion of flexibility clauses into the<br />
award system of facilitative clauses into the award system, of majority<br />
clauses into that award system as well as the vehicles of certified<br />
agreement making and enterprise flexibility agreement making so<br />
you've got a totally comprehensive system but one which would have<br />
the guts ripped out of it by individual contracts being introduced on a<br />
widespread basis as the norm for the first time. Now certainly, I don't<br />
deny there are many workplaces who have chosen to provide<br />
overaward payments and we welcome that and we've never said quite<br />
frankly that there's no place at all for some sorts of contracts in the<br />
workplace but the integrity of the system needs to have the<br />
Commission overseeing all of the bargain making and it needs to<br />
have the award system providing the essential underpinning and the<br />
application of a strong no disadvantage test.<br />
J: Prime Minister, we've listened to obviously a campaign speech, why<br />
don't you put the election on what are you waiting for? </p>
<p>PM: You mean the election, you said, and others said Laurie, we were<br />
going to have eighteen months ago.<br />
J: I don't think I said that Prime Minister.<br />
PMV: Well many did, the election budget, the election we were going to have<br />
when we were clearing the decks with a republic, the Accord Mark 8<br />
election, you mean that election.<br />
J: I mean the one that's due now, when are you going to put it on?<br />
PM: When it suits the country and the Government.<br />
J: When will that be?<br />
PM: W~ hen it suits the country and the Government.<br />
J: Well you said in your speech this morning that that we're going to<br />
face an election In between 2 and 3 months, the 2 and 3 months, does<br />
that mean that you regard it as potentially legitimate for the<br />
Govempinent to run to May?<br />
PM: Absolutely, I mean I'm the one on the record all the time saying that we<br />
should get the maximum value from these Parliaments, most of you are<br />
on the record saying there's going to be any early election.<br />
PMV: Well, not all of you, some of you, some noisy ones of you.<br />
J: Is industrial relations going to be the major issue?<br />
PMV: I think, it's very interesting that where the Coalition saw themselves<br />
vulnerable In the runup to 1993, In the last week of Parliament, if my<br />
recollection serves me correctly, or it might have been the last<br />
business week of the year, John Howson Introduced Fightback Mark 11,<br />
a more cuddly version of it because he thought he had major<br />
problems with Flghtback. John Howard has done exactly the same<br />
thing, instead of doing it In the last week of December he's done in the<br />
first week of January. He's come off his leave, made a statement and<br />
gone back on leave. He said Industrial relations is one of the key<br />
issues of the election It not the key issue, he's made it such an issue<br />
by doing that and we're entitled as a Government to respond.<br />
J: Does it surprise you that he actually went so far in changing the policy<br />
PM: You can't take it seriously, that's the point we're making, I mean he<br />
either takes the position that he terms the high moral ground of saying </p>
<p>Labors taken Australia a long way in internationalising the economy,<br />
in changing the whole culture of the country but it can't take the last<br />
step of labour market reform, I will take it. That's the ground he saw<br />
himself standing on, the high ground he's seen himself standing on.<br />
He's now saying he doesn't stand on that high ground at all and his<br />
supporters are entitled to ask, well in that case Mr Howard, on what<br />
ground do you stand on. That is if you accept it but why did the ACCI<br />
and the Business Council remain mute, because they know what they'll<br />
get is what they got with Mr Kennett and Mr Court, they'll get the full<br />
version, they'll get labour market flexibility downwards, they'll get the<br />
cuts in the bottom 40 per cent of the workforce that they've always<br />
been looking for and that's what will come. You can Imagine the<br />
ebullience of a Coalition Government in office being held to account<br />
for something they said in January of this year. John Howard has<br />
always said people know what I stand for, people know the team and<br />
they know what we stand for and what they stand for is radical labour<br />
market change.<br />
J: Prime Minister, the Court and Kennett strategies, does it worry you that<br />
it might work again?<br />
PM: No, because I think as the polls indicated quite eloquently during the<br />
week, I think people can spot that kind of behaviour. I don't think<br />
given Mr Howard's consistent, continued advocacy of this course of<br />
action and for well over a decade, to find him now seeking to portray<br />
himself as the manager of a policy similar to the Governments is<br />
Incredible and unbelievable and that sort of twerpish behaviour Is I<br />
think well spotted by the public.<br />
J: Do you think it will take you three months to get that across or can you<br />
do It in a three week<br />
PM: The fact that we've got much of that across now brought him out in<br />
January.<br />
J: Inaudible<br />
PM: Oh well, there are no easy political tasks are there, I mean none of<br />
them are easy but again the results speak for themselves. We open<br />
the new year with all the bald headlines in the financial press about<br />
the stockmarket and In the end what is the stockmarket saying, they're<br />
imputing higher profits into their calculations in terms of the all<br />
ordinaries Index and that's coming from growth and restraint in wages<br />
and Inflation and at the same time we had very strong employment<br />
numbers. You know, you don't need a microscope to work out which<br />
way the economy is going, that's strongly and forward. </p>
<p>J: The polling this week shows that more than 63 per cent of people<br />
didn't support Howard but also thought you had been In office for<br />
too long<br />
PM-Yes but I mean the point about it is, as I always tell you about the<br />
stubby pencils, you know they have their own particular aura about<br />
them and when people get one in their hand they think about the future<br />
and about their lives. I think it was very telling that after the<br />
Government has been in office for 13 years, succession of Labor<br />
government's for 13 years, such a high proportion of people thought<br />
the Government had done well.<br />
J: That's more important than the level of support?<br />
PM: Absolutely, absolutely.<br />
J1 Given that the polls have shown you consistently behind the Coalition<br />
through the last 12 months, do you think the campaign will bridge that<br />
gap<br />
PM: I'm not ' about to say, you know what I say about polls, I'm always<br />
offending the press gallery talking about only politicians can decipher<br />
the polls and they can it's true. There are very few people in Australia<br />
who can read polls, not just a pol but the public mood.<br />
J: Can you start a campaign this far behind?<br />
PM: Well, I'm sure John Major is going to start his campaign much further<br />
behind than we are.<br />
J: Everyone says he may not win...?<br />
PM: No, but we are, he may not but we are.<br />
J: Prime Minister has Jeff Kennett's industrial policies your campaign<br />
PM: Well, I gave the figures today, the closure of the schools, the 8,000<br />
teachers that have been dismissed and in the end what's happening. I<br />
mean Jeff Kennett is putting chains on public toilets on railway<br />
stations, he is turning the ambulance service out to private contractors,<br />
he's lost sight of what his responsibilities are in running a civilised<br />
society and I think Victorians understand this well.<br />
Ends. </p>
