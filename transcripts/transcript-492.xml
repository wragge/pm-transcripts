TARIFF BOARD BILL<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE RT. HON. R. G, HENZIES<br />
IN THE HOUSE OIF REPRESENTATIVES<br />
TH-APRIL, 1 2<br />
Sir I think that this is a proper opportunity to say<br />
something not I think, unduly contentious about the Tariff<br />
Board Bill as it fits into the general pattern of overall policy,<br />
because there may be some confusions here or there. It may<br />
therefore be helpful to indicate how we understand this matter.<br />
This is a bill which, if you put it in a short way, is designed to<br />
facilitate the imposition of Q. R. quantitative restrictions on<br />
imports in certain uncommon cases. These are special cases<br />
demonstrated by special circumstances. This measure does not<br />
represent a reversion to import licensing as we knew it. Import<br />
licensing as we knew it, in the broad, inevitably meant what Ithink<br />
most people would call a bureaucratic control, and it had<br />
heavy implications of an unscientific second line of tariff<br />
protection. That second line of tariff protection was quite<br />
unscientific because it covered iabroad sweep so many hundreds of<br />
items. I describe it as ar unscientific second line of tariff<br />
protection because, although my colleague, the Minister for Trade<br />
( Mr. McEwen) ad I time after time endeavoured to make it clear that<br />
this was not regarded as a protective device, it perhaps<br />
inevitably came to be regarded in that sense, as I think the<br />
honourable member for Richmond ( Mr. Anthony) pointed out late this<br />
afternoon. This broad sweep of import licensing was not to be<br />
regarded as a protective device. It had two disabilities, to say<br />
nothing of the others. One was, as I have said, that it was<br />
unscientific, because it covered a wide field, not in a<br />
discriminating way. In the s. econd place, it was something that<br />
could be imposed by a governnent through a Minister without<br />
reference to any outside authority or check. My colleague, the<br />
Minister for Trade, who, I am sure, would have liked to be here<br />
and who, I venture to say, is doing a magnificent job for us<br />
overseas, liked this broad sweep no more than I did. In the<br />
result, the Government gave thought to it. considered the<br />
problems that are arising, some of them in the short run and some<br />
of them, perhaps, in the longer run. J~ decided, as I announced<br />
some time ago, that we would set up machinery involving a<br />
reference to an independent adviser to enable import quota<br />
restrictions to be imposed, not as a general rule, but in very<br />
particular cases in very particular circumstances. In other wrords,<br />
as one honourable member has said in this debate, this is a<br />
holding measure introduced in order that we may prevent things<br />
from getting worse in certain instances before they become better.<br />
There is one other thing that perhaps ought to be said,<br />
Sir, for these things cccasionally are overlooked. That is that<br />
the restoration of general import licensing which has been<br />
advocated here or there could not be justified internationally when<br />
our overseas funds are as healthy as they are now, and at a time<br />
when it is perhaps the fashion an undesirable fashion to<br />
pretend that what was announced at the end of 1960 is now<br />
abandoned. I remind the House that one of the many great<br />
products of the policy then established is that today our overseas<br />
funds are healthy and our current overseas balances of trade are<br />
healthy. These are good things. They are not to be forgotten C<br />
certainly not to bu cpologized for.<br />
What this bill does is to provide for an independent<br />
inquiry. I will not pursue the question of the identity of the<br />
gentleman who has been appointed to conduct this inquiry, excep'<br />
say that if there is one matter on which my friends opposite and<br />
can agree entirely it is that Sir Frank Moore is a distinguished<br />
honest civil servant of great cxperience and, I think, of great<br />
objectivity, 4o wanted an independent inquiry, Sir. </p>
<p>That is the first thing. The second thing that we wanted was tlat<br />
there should be in the independent adviser a faculty to recommend<br />
quota or quantitative restrictions only in special cases in<br />
special circumstances. If I repeot that for the second time,<br />
honourable members will realize why I do. ' o are literally dealing<br />
with a very particular set of circumstances which may exist for a<br />
yeor or for two years, but wrhich we hope will not necessarily exist<br />
for ever. Thor. fore, the third essence of the proposal is that<br />
quantitative re. strictions, if they are recommended and adopted,<br />
should be temporary. Honourable members know from their perusal<br />
of the bill what is involved in that.<br />
It has been said I have no doubt in the best of good<br />
faith, that the very presentation of this bill to the Parliament<br />
exhibits some want of confidence in the Tariff Board. I want to<br />
say on behalf of the Government that that is not true. We are not<br />
challenging the Tariff Board. W hat we realize is that in spite of<br />
the measures that we have taken in the past to increase the<br />
personnel and the services of the board the pressure on that body<br />
still remains enormous. I reject the idea, ; rhich has been given<br />
some circulation, that the board has slowed down and is not dealing<br />
with matters as quickly as it used to deal with them. If I had<br />
time I could cite figures to demonstrate how untrue that idea is.<br />
The Tariff Board is a very great authority, and we stand in great<br />
debt to it. It has a reputation, not only in this country, but<br />
around the world, for integrity and objectivity, and nothing that<br />
we propose in this bill is designed to iwaken its authority or " o<br />
give even the vaguest hint that we might want to be without it.<br />
That idea is not true.<br />
When you are dealing with temporary matters for which a<br />
pressure comes suddenly a pressure that you hope will not<br />
continue to exist indefinitely in the future there is an<br />
unanswerable case for taking uncommon measures. If we had stood<br />
still and said, " On, well, leave it to the Tariff Board; we willdo<br />
nothing about it", we would properly bo accused of leaving some<br />
industries or some sections of industry to be murdered by a sudden<br />
spate of overseas competition. Perhaps one of the best<br />
illustrations of this is that my friend, the honourable member for<br />
Richmond, rwhen saying something at slight variance from what had<br />
been said by my thoughtful and able friend, the honourablo member<br />
for Wakofiold ( Mr. Kelly), said, "' ell, thure are cases in which<br />
quantitative restrictions may be desirable". He instanced timba:<br />
Well, I can understand that. Somebody else, somewhere else in the<br />
House, might have instanced p per. The honourable member for<br />
Braddon ( Mr. Davies) might very well be heard to say, " hat about<br />
pap. r?' Somebody else might instance chemicals of certain kinds.<br />
Somebody else might instance glass of certain types. The truth is<br />
that not one of us can have within his own knowledge a complete<br />
survey of all the industries. But when you get down to brass<br />
tacks you will find that there are a few industries not too many;<br />
this is not of universal application or sections of industries<br />
in which the sudden impact of competition from overseas calls for<br />
unusual measures, not in the long run but in the short run. That<br />
is one of the reasons for this bill.<br />
I wonder, Sir, whether I right pause at that point to<br />
direct attention I an not the first tocb it to one espect of<br />
the iuropean Common Market negotitiions which has, I think, beeocontinually<br />
overlooked. It is quite true that at this time my<br />
colleague, the Minister for Trade who, in spite of all the si.<br />
tittle-tattle that I hoar, is a great defender of Australian<br />
industry has immediatoly before him problems of our rural<br />
industries and of our export industries, questions such as what<br />
going happen to butter, w. hat is going to happen to Iat, driet<br />
and canned fruits and r: any other co.. odities. But we can very<br />
easily overlooked the fact that one of the great forces rm) ving<br />
United Kingdom in the direction of the European Commnon Market<br />
Mr. Cairns Is the United States. i </p>
<p>Mr, Menzies No. I will make my own speeches, if you don't mind.<br />
They usually turn out a little better that way. One of the great<br />
forces moving the United Kingdom in the direction of the Common<br />
Market we know this from what has been put to us is the fact<br />
that inside the European Common Market there will be, for the great<br />
industrial manufacturing countries, an extended home market.<br />
Nobody can fail to understand the position of a British Minister,<br />
sitting in Whitehall and saying, " We have a home market of<br />
million people, but inside the European Common Market we will have<br />
a home market, with internal free trade, of 250 million people".<br />
As everybody knows, that was one of the main reasons why the six<br />
European countries got together, beginning with the Schumann plan<br />
for steel, and then developing a wider association. They saw at<br />
once that if they could get this home market, something roughly<br />
corresponding to the almost fabulous home market of the United<br />
States of America, they might expect to produce more cheaply and<br />
therefore sell more cheaply. What has been overlooked, to some<br />
extent, is that British entry into the European Common Market, if<br />
and when it comes, while presenting an obvious challenge to our<br />
primary export industries, will also represent a powerful<br />
challenge to Australian manufacturing industries. It will mean<br />
that the producers of manufactured goods in European countries,<br />
including, for this purpose, the United Kingdom, will be in a<br />
powerful competitive position in our own market. So, not for the<br />
first time, we have to boar in mind that we are all involved in<br />
this matter. The manufacturer is at risk because of the Common<br />
Market; the farmer is at risk because of the Common Market,<br />
Therefore it is rather foolish-certainly unnecessary to revive<br />
at this stage some of the old battles between protection and free<br />
trade which were waged befo: re any of us thought of coming into<br />
Parliament. All these considerations show clearly that we have<br />
immense interests in common, and they show to me and to my<br />
colleagues that we neglect any of those interests at our peril.<br />
In other words, we must take steps to ensure the continuity and<br />
growth of manufacturing. We will be imperilled if we fail to take<br />
steps to avoid building up the costs of our export primary<br />
industries to a point at which those industries will be priced out<br />
of a market which is vital to our future.<br />
So, Sir, this is not a conflict in the orthodox sense.<br />
This is a great opportunity for showing a unity of approach to<br />
those matters. v'hon I hear certain attempts being made to drive<br />
a wedge between parties on this side of the H) uso, I say to<br />
myself, " This is all nonsense. We are all on the same side in<br />
this matter. We may have opinions which vary a little in degree,<br />
but certainly not opinions which differ in deep principle".<br />
Now, Sir, I do not want to involve myself having<br />
already used a little more than half my allotted time in<br />
detailed and technical arguments as to whether a quantitative<br />
restriction, carefully selocted, oads costs in Australia or<br />
reduces them. I have listened with groat respect to arguments<br />
which suggest that a quantitative restriction will load costs<br />
more than a high tariff. All I want to say at this stage is that<br />
I am unable to subscribe to that view.<br />
Mr. Pollard You are an innocent abroad.<br />
Mr. Menzies I am not. I am an innocent at home. I wonder<br />
whether my distinguished friend the honourable member for Lalor<br />
( Mr. Pollard) means that he is quite satisfied that a quantitat<br />
restriction will increase costs in Australia. If he docs, I ar<br />
little puzzled as to why he is supporting the bill. Perhaps I<br />
not so innocent as he thinks. But, Sir, I just offer my own vi<br />
that there will be cases in which the imposition of a quantitat<br />
restriction will reduce the risk of having costs and prices ri'<br />
in Australia. </p>
<p>Mr. Pollard That is right.<br />
Mr. Menzies Now he says that is right! Previously he said I was<br />
an innocent abroad. Anyhow, my friend agrees with me that i is<br />
right. One of the beauties of this piece of legislation is that it<br />
is a temporary proposal. It will be as I shall explain further<br />
later, merged into longer-term legislation, and if my own view<br />
happens to be wrong not for the first time<br />
Mr. Pollard Oh!<br />
Mr. Menzies You are thinking of matters different from those I a,<br />
thinking of. Anyhow, if my view happens to be w rong, we will awe<br />
ample opportunity to examine it when we cre discussing the longerterm<br />
legislation. In short, if I may adopt the phrase used by one<br />
honourable member, this is a holding measure.<br />
The next thing I wiant to say is that we attach enormous<br />
importance to stabilizing costs in Australia. If any item of<br />
policy pursued by us loads the costs of production of the major<br />
export industries of Australia, then it will deliver a crippling<br />
blow at the Australian economy.<br />
Mr. Pollard Everything you have done since 1949 has had exactly<br />
that result.<br />
Mr. Menzies I heard you; now you lister to me, dear boy. I<br />
heard one of your heelers make that statement this afternoon. All<br />
I am doing now is what I am allowed to do offering my own views,<br />
on behalf of the Government on this matter. We believe that one<br />
of the central principles of economic policy is that we must not<br />
put the export industries at risk. The task is far from completed<br />
as yet, because my distinguished colleague, the Minister for Trade,<br />
is still abroad fighting our battles. We are preparing a further<br />
Tariff Board measure. As I and others have made clear in public<br />
statements, we propose to weave quota restrictions into the<br />
general Tariff Board fabric for use in selected cases where a<br />
tariff is not the appropriate remedy. I do not need to tell<br />
honourable members that this is not simple. This is not something<br />
you can run up overnight on a typewriter. This requires a great<br />
deal of thought, and I am determined th,; t before we do anything<br />
my colleague, the Minister for Trade, will have the fullest<br />
opportunity to offer his views.<br />
In the general armament of the Tariff Board we will<br />
include the capacity to impose a quota restriction wrhere the board<br />
is of opinion that no normal tariff procedure will be appropriate<br />
to the case.<br />
Mr. Pollard There is no provision in this bill to do that.<br />
Mr. Menzies I am referring to the bill which, unless I am<br />
bitterly disappointed, will be presented to the House in the<br />
Budget session. All this means that we are uxamining the underlying<br />
problems of the economy. The greatest problem of the economy is<br />
to reconcile a few matters, each of which is ma; gnificently<br />
important in its own fashion but each of which may have to be<br />
modified a little in the interests of accommrodating the lot. Le'<br />
me re-state shortly the problens that we have: First of all, wr<br />
must build up our population by natural increase and by substant<br />
migration. This, I think, isa national objective to which all<br />
honourable members subscribe. Secondly, we must achieve and<br />
maintain full enployr. ent for that increasing population.<br />
Opposition Members Oh, no </p>
<p>Mr. Menzies In stating these factors I cam unrmoved by the<br />
professional unemployment non rs on the other side of the House,<br />
They will all be absent on sick leave when we find that there are<br />
no unemployed in Australia because, like Othollo, theiroccupation<br />
will be gone indeed. Thirdly, we must support actively and<br />
continuously the growth of manufacturing industry which I say<br />
categorically is vital to the absorption and employment of our<br />
increased population. That does not mean that I am ignoring the<br />
tertiary or service industries. I know that they have just as big<br />
a part to play as have primary and secondary industries, but the<br />
truth is that if you look at employment and increasing population<br />
in Australia you must look first, in modern circumstances, at what<br />
is happening in the manufacturing field. Therefore, we are all<br />
for it. Our clear policy is to support actively the growth of<br />
manufacturing industry. Fourthly, we must develop the basic<br />
resources of the nation. Government expenditure, sometimes rather<br />
sneered at by people, is the vital foundation of industrial<br />
development and of population increase.<br />
We must try to do all these things while encouraging<br />
the export industries which, in the most literal sense, are vital<br />
to our international trade and solvency. At our national peril we<br />
must not cost them out of their markets. This seems so clear that<br />
I could hardly imagine any one would deny it. How are we to do<br />
that? In our recent announcements we have indicated several ways.<br />
The first is to keep down rural costs by measures designed to<br />
increase the efficiency of rural industries. I have only to refer<br />
to the work done in scientific research and in extension, in<br />
which so many of my friends are so deeply interested, to make it<br />
clear that from our point of view the first great thing to be<br />
done for the primary industries is to help them to produce in a<br />
quantity and at a cost level which will defend them against other<br />
increases in the Australian economy.<br />
The second way by which we hope to achieve our<br />
objective I emphasize this point because occasionally it is<br />
overlooked is by measures calculated to increase the efficiency<br />
of local manufacturing and so enable the local manufacturer to<br />
keep his costs and prices within proper limits. Whatever is<br />
done, * hethetr by way of investment allowance or in any other way<br />
to help the local manufacturer to keep his costs within bounds,<br />
has a direct bearing upon the ultimate costs of the ru-' al<br />
producer who cannot pass on his additional costs but has to bear<br />
them. Concluding on this aspect, let me say that one vray in which<br />
we can help the Australian manufacturer to keep his costs within<br />
bounds, apart altogether from granting investment allowances, is<br />
by making it possible for him to secure a share of the Australian<br />
market which will enable him to spread his his overhead costs<br />
over the largest possible number of units.<br />
We might look occasionally at the rest of the wrorld to<br />
see what has happened in modern industrial history. What does it<br />
show in relation to America and modern Germany? It shows that<br />
lower costs and greater export markets are the product of a large<br />
sustained and assured home market. There is a lesson to be<br />
learned from all this. Why should we deny co our own great<br />
manufacturing industries I am not talking about casual fly-bynight<br />
enterprises the very thing which has made their rivals in<br />
the :-orld powerful and has enabled them to put such pressure on<br />
our business as to require hearvy tariffs to provide protection?<br />
These are all matters which have to be taken into account.<br />
Perhaps I have gone a little . rider in my rumarks than one or tv<br />
rulings that I have heard might have permitted.<br />
Opposition members.-Hoar, hears </p>
<p>6.<br />
Mr. Menzies That is right; but still I have done it. I wanted<br />
to put this matter in the picture. First, I wanted to make it<br />
clear that -re have the liveliest interest in protecting the<br />
production costs of the primary industries because vithout them<br />
this country is finished. Scondly, ,. re have the liveliest<br />
interest in maintaining a vast increase of population and<br />
therefore a vast increase, among other thinz, z of manufacturing<br />
enterprise on proper terms. Really, one of the great problems of<br />
statesmanship in Australia today is not to engage in a lot of<br />
slang-whanging in these matters but to see how you can reconcile<br />
these matters to the greatest possible extent. It is for all<br />
those reasons that this is a bill to set up a temporary machine<br />
to deal aith a temporary problem, so that we will not have the<br />
whole thing run away from us before we :, et to the point of<br />
establishing permanent machinery and a permanent body to deal<br />
with it. </p>
