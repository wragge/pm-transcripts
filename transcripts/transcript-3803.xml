AUSTRALA Press Statement No. 524<br />
27 June 1975<br />
WOOLLOOMOOLOO PROJECT<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam, and the Premier<br />
of New South Wales, Mr Lewis, today signed an agreement<br />
approving expenditure of $ 17 million for the re-development<br />
of Woolloomooloo. The project will be financed by the Australian<br />
Government, and carried out jointly by the Australian and<br />
New South Wales Governments and the Sydney City Council.<br />
Most of the funds will be devoted to acquiring land.<br />
The three Governments have agreed to pool the<br />
land they own in Woolloomooloo to allow as much flexibility<br />
as possible in the detailed planning of the area.<br />
Mr Whitlam and Mr Lewis said the three levels<br />
of Government had recognised the need for co-operative<br />
action to ensure that the residential character of this<br />
historic area of Sydney was preserved.<br />
