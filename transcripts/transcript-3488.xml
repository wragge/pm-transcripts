PRIME MINISTER Press Statement No. 383<br />
26 November 1974<br />
SPORTING AND RECREATION GRANTS<br />
The Prime Minister and Member for Werriwa, Mr<br />
Gough Whitlam, said today he was delighted that the District<br />
Sporting Complex at Ingleburn was to receive a $ 65,000 grant<br />
from the Australian Government.<br />
The grant was announced last week by the Minister<br />
for Tourism and Recreation, Mr Frank Stewart, as part of<br />
the Australian Government's capital assistance program for<br />
leisure facilities. Mr Whitlam said the total cost of the Ingleburn<br />
project was estimated at $ 135,000, and the $ 65,000 grant<br />
was a clear indication of his Government's willingness to<br />
become associated with the developmient of recreational facilities.<br />
The $ 65,000 will go towards the cost of developing<br />
the Amenities Block and Sports Fields which are included in<br />
the District Sporting Complex.<br />
Mr Whitlam said that New South Wales would receive<br />
$ 560,600 of the total of $ 3,443,916 in the current program of<br />
capital assistance for leisure facilities.<br />
For this financial year the Australian Government has<br />
approved a commitment of $ 11.5 million for this program. Allocation<br />
of these funds will be in three main categories:<br />
community sporting and recreation facilities<br />
and specialist sporting facilities;<br />
art and cultural facilities; and<br />
facilities in proposed Area Improvement<br />
Program Areas.<br />
Mr Whitlam said that grants for projects in the proposed<br />
Area Improvement Program Areas and grants for cultural facilities<br />
would be announced at a later date.<br />
