PRIME MINISTER'S<br />
REMARKS TO PRESS ON DEPARTURE FOR LONDON<br />
MASCOT AIRPORT, SYDNEY JANUARY 1969<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well, gentlemen, I don't think I have any statements<br />
to make to you. As you know, I am going over to a Commonwealth<br />
Prime Ministers' Conference. The last one was held, I think, two<br />
years ago. No doubt, you have got some questions you would like to<br />
ask me, and if I can, I will try and answer them. So fire ahead.<br />
Q. Will you be putting forward any proposals for a Singapore-based<br />
mobile defence force in either formal or informal discussions with<br />
the other Commonwealth leaders?<br />
PM: This is not on the agenda at all.<br />
Q. What are your views on such a proposal?<br />
PM: Well they are not views that would be appropriate to a<br />
Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference, and they are not<br />
views on which, at this stage, I am going to express an opinion.<br />
Let us get on to the Conference.<br />
Q I would like to ask you a question concerning something which<br />
will take place after you have left the publication of this book<br />
" The Power Struggle" by Alan Reid. It concerns the voting at the<br />
party meeting which elected you as Party Lead~ er and therefore<br />
Prime Minister. The figures published at the time and since<br />
widely circulated indicated that you had a very impressive margin<br />
over Mr Hasluck of 51-30 votes. Alan Reid suggests that the margin<br />
was in fact much closer 43 to you and 38 to Mr Hasluck. Which<br />
set of figures is nearer the truth?<br />
PM: I haven't the slightest idea. I wasn't a scrutineer. I would<br />
imagine that only the scrutineers would know.<br />
Q Mr Reid's sources are usually fairly reliable, and assuming<br />
that his figures are anywhere near the truth, Mr Alan Barnes,<br />
commenting on the book suggested that the nearness of the figures<br />
has in fact influenced the style of your Prime Ministership in the<br />
past twelve months, that you have been seeking popular support to<br />
make up for, possibly, divided party support. What is your comment?<br />
PM: I wouldn't be prepared to assume that Mr Reid's or anybody<br />
es's assessments of things that are only known to the scrutineers<br />
were correct. I don't know.<br />
Q Sir, can you tell us what is the reaction of the Malaysian<br />
Government to the decision to move Anzac troops to Singapore? 2 </p>
<p>2-<br />
PM: Well, you saw the statement made by the Tunku who quite<br />
happily accepted the proposals that we put to himi<br />
Q Was there any time, Sir, when they opposed the idea?<br />
PM: I don't know of any time when they opposed the idea. I think<br />
they might have liked to have teen able to keep Terendak running<br />
as it could be run as a viable base, but I wouldn't say they opposed<br />
the idea. You have seen the statement made by the Tunku on this<br />
matter.<br />
PM: And after the move to Singapore, Sir, will the Malaysians be<br />
able to call on these troops at any time they may need them.<br />
Q These tro',-ps are stationed in the area and as you know,<br />
Singapore and Malaya are acting together in defence matters and<br />
our forces are there to assist both these countries in their joint<br />
defence efforts.<br />
Q Mr Gorton, what matters do you hope to see introduced into the<br />
Conference?<br />
PM: What matters do I hope to see introduced into the conference....<br />
well, I find it a li ttle difficult question to answer. I would answer<br />
it in this way: I would hope no one matter dominates the conference<br />
and that it is able to deal with the quite large number of subjects that<br />
are put down on the agenda, and doesn't spend all its time on just one<br />
subject. I think that is about all I could say on that matter.<br />
Q Sir, how big an issue do you expect Rhodesia to be?<br />
PM: This will depend entirely on what the people at the conference<br />
wish to mak'
it to be a subject which dominates the whole of the meeting, and we<br />
wouldn't wish it to be either. There are a number of other subjects<br />
which could be of considerable value to discuss.<br />
Mr Holt came back from the last Prime Ministers' Conference<br />
somewhat dubious about the value of the conferences continuing<br />
in the same way as on that occasion. In what . ram e of mind are<br />
you going to this conference hopeful or are you going over in a<br />
somewhat........<br />
PM; I am going over in the frame of mind of someone who has never<br />
been to one before and who will be most interested to see how it<br />
operates and what subjects are discussed and what consensuses<br />
or consensi of opinion are arrived at on those subjects. . j3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
Q. Sir, will you while you are there be pushing anything on the<br />
Nigerian situation? Will Australia be taking an active role in<br />
bringing this forward and . pressing the Nigerian Government<br />
into somne sort of action?<br />
PM: We won't be taking an active role or an initiative in this.<br />
It is a matter which, as I understand it, the British Government,<br />
and indeed we ourselves, would very much like to see brought to<br />
a conclusion so that the killing ceased. But I believe and I can<br />
only say that I believe that the British Government thinks that<br />
the organisation of African unity, the African States which have been<br />
concerning themselves in this matter, are perhaps the best tool<br />
if I can use this word with which to bring about this desired result,<br />
and we would, I think, agree with the British Government on their<br />
approach to this matter. But we would certainly like to see the<br />
killing cease but not be taking our own initiative.<br />
Q: Sir, if I could ask one more question on the conference. Does<br />
Australia favour any increase in the role of the Secretariat to the<br />
Conference?<br />
PM: An increase in the role of the Secretariat? In what particular<br />
way do you mean?<br />
Q: In perhaps strengthening ties between Commonwealth countries?<br />
PM: Well, I think the Sccretariat is occupied now as as Secretariat<br />
in conveying views and messages between the various Commonwealth<br />
countries. We would not wish to see it have any power to do anything<br />
other than that.<br />
Mr Gorton, do you think the remarks in Dame Zara Holt's<br />
book will have any effect on the attitudes of the Africans towards you?<br />
PM: L can't imagine why thcy should. These are remark'As which are<br />
published by a private citizen at second or third hand and I find<br />
it difficult to think that the y would influence the attitude of anybody<br />
towards me.<br />
Q: Mr Gorton, just to return briefly to the question of ' The Power<br />
Struggle", if I may, do you agree that the role played by Lord Casey<br />
in this matter has been a more active one than has be-en the role of<br />
the Governor-General in the past? Do you think that is a change<br />
that has come to stay?<br />
PM: Well I really came here to answer questions about the Commonwealth<br />
Prime Ministers' Conference and not to make comments on<br />
the actions of any Governor-General.<br />
If </p>
<p>-4-<br />
Q: The dinner you are having with the British Prime<br />
Minister, Sir, is that likely to include any Defence<br />
proposals along the lines of Malaysia and Singapore?<br />
PM: Well, I will be having a dinner with the British Prime<br />
Minister, and I have no doubt that quite a number of<br />
subjects could be brought up for discussion. I will be<br />
having a private dinner with Mr Trudeau. I have no doubt<br />
that any number of subjects will be brought up for discussion.<br />
But there is no agenda for either dinner.<br />
Thank you, gentlemen. </p>
