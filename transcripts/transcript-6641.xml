CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
PARLIAMENTARY LUNCHEON IN HONOUR OF<br />
THE PRESIDENT OF IRELAND<br />
HIS EXCELLENCY DR PATRICK HILLERY AND MRS HILLERY<br />
CANBERRA WEDNESDAY 5 JUNE 1985<br />
Mr President, Mr s Hillery, Mr and Mrs Barry, Ambassador<br />
and Mrs Small, Distinguished Guests, Ladies and<br />
Gentlemen. This is indeed an historic occasion.<br />
You, Mr President, are the first Head of State of<br />
Ireland to visit Australia.<br />
Your visit is welcomed by the Government, and by the<br />
Australian people, not least by the five million<br />
Australians with some Irish in them.<br />
Any Australian who wishes to understand his country must<br />
hav~ e an appreciation of Irish history and culture.<br />
Since the first settlement in 1788 the Irish have made a<br />
distinctive contribution to Australian life.<br />
The Irish contribution to Australian politics has been<br />
extraordinary. A number of my predecessors have been of<br />
Irish descent: Scullin, Lyons and Faddenf for example,<br />
and, of course, Curtin and Chifley, the two Australian<br />
Prime Ministers whom I particularly admire as leaders,<br />
who fought especially hard for the rights of ordinary<br />
Australian men and women.<br />
Today more than half the Members of my Ministry are of<br />
Irish descent, and three of the six State Premiers have<br />
Irish antecedents.<br />
For a century and a half, the Irish in Australia were a<br />
significant minority in a society dominated by English<br />
connexfions and traditions. They were the ones who </p>
<p>-2-<br />
questioned and challenged attitudes to the prevailing<br />
culture and religion. They sought and achieved a nation<br />
broad and tolerant enough to include them as they were,<br />
tolerant enough to accept those aspects of life they<br />
considered most important.<br />
This Irish contribution to the Australian ethos, was, at<br />
the time of its making, often vigorously criticised and<br />
sometimes fiercely resisted.<br />
I recall particularly the establishment and development<br />
of the Catholic education and welfare systems, the<br />
controversies surrounding the place of religion in<br />
politics which began in the 1840' s and only subsided in<br />
the relatively recent past, the conscription<br />
controversies of the First World War, the interaction<br />
between capital and labour and, arising from this, most<br />
importantly, the foundation and achievements of the<br />
Australian Labor Party, in which the Irish tradition has<br />
always been a vital one.<br />
There are two particular characteristics of this Irish<br />
contribution to contemporary Australia that are worth<br />
emphasising. The first is that the tensions and divisions generated<br />
by the religious, social and political controversies in<br />
which Irish Australians were involved proved over the<br />
longer term to be of a creative rather than a<br />
destructive nature. No lasting bigotry or sectarianism<br />
remains in Australia. The outcome, rather, has been a<br />
constructive and protective Australian political system,<br />
a system in which a continuing and vigorous debate about<br />
the kind of society Australia should be can take place.<br />
In this way, the Irish made a most important<br />
contribution both in ensuring personal liberties in<br />
Australia and in the development of a distinctively<br />
Australian identity which encompasses the many<br />
nationalities that have made this country their home.<br />
Another hallmark of the Irish in Australia has been<br />
their concentration on Australian, rather than Irish,<br />
issues. It was the Irish, mofe than any other national<br />
group, who first rejected the idea of Australia as<br />
simply ' a new Britannia in another world' and compelled<br />
others to become conscious of Australia's different<br />
origins and culture. They did this by seeking to<br />
encourage in Australia the development of a unique<br />
national consciouSness.<br />
At the same timer Irish Australians never forget their<br />
essential Irishness. This was reflected in the Irish<br />
social and cultural life that flourished in Australia </p>
<p>-3-<br />
during the peak years of Irish migration and in the<br />
special affection which the many Australians of Irish<br />
descent continue to have for the homeland of their<br />
forefathers. it is apparent in our vigorous literary tradition,. from<br />
Marcus Clarke to Tom Kenneally, in folk songs like wild<br />
Colonial Boy and Moreton Bay: and also, importantly, in<br />
the origin of Australian Rules Football in Gaelic<br />
Football. I am sure we both wish the recently<br />
inaugurated international competition between Australia.<br />
and Ireland well.<br />
In all this the Iri sh have set a standard for the<br />
healthy diversity that now characterises Australian life<br />
and institutions a standard whereby national groups do<br />
not abandon the distinctive cultural traditions of their<br />
homelands but which upholds their primary interest, as<br />
Australians, with Australia's present and future role<br />
and with making the most of the opportunities which<br />
living in this country provide.<br />
Ireland has decided that its modern destiny lies in<br />
Europe, a decision with which you, Mr President, were<br />
closely. associated. Australia sees its future in our<br />
successful integration with the Western Pacific region.<br />
Nevertheless, today, both our countries re'cognise the<br />
importance of our interlocked histories to our<br />
continuing relationship.<br />
Au'stralia appreciated Ireland's hosting of the first<br />
Australian Bicentennial Conference in Kilkenny in 1983.<br />
Our Goverroient has recognised the value of the<br />
connection'with the creation under the Whitlam<br />
Government of the Chair of Australian History at<br />
University College, Dublin, and the grant announced on<br />
St Patricks Day this year to secure the future of the<br />
Chair.<br />
We hope that on the basis of our links the Irish<br />
Government will be a major participant in our<br />
Bicentenary in 1988.<br />
We look forward to continued co-operation in the<br />
cultural and tourism area and should continue to look<br />
for opportunities to co-operate in the pursuit of shared<br />
political ideals as well as for mutually beneficial<br />
openings in the edonomic sphere. </p>
<p>-4-<br />
Hr President<br />
Your visit has brought into focus the unique Irish<br />
contribution to our nation and our national ethos. It<br />
has not only caused the hearts of our Walshs, Kellys,<br />
Murphys, Duffys, Keatings, Ryans and O'Reillys to swell<br />
with pride, but it has also brought to the rest of us an<br />
appreciation of that contribution.<br />
I hope that you will take back with you to Ireland a<br />
feeling of pride in the achievements of the Irish in<br />
this land, and the knowledge that your country will<br />
always have a special place in our hearts and minds. </p>
