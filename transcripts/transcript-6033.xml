PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA TUESDAY, 22 FEBRUARY 1983<br />
* KEATING'S WORDS WILL DROWN HIM<br />
Australians should be under no doubt about what Labor would do to<br />
fund their multi-billion dollar spending spree.<br />
The Shadow Treasurert Mr Keating, has made his Party's position<br />
abundantly clear. Just eight days ago, on national radio, he<br />
said, and I quote his own words his words, not mine:<br />
" We have massive savings locked up in the banking system<br />
( with) which the Commonwealth could quite easily fund<br />
this sort of deficit and get the Australian economy<br />
moving again". 14/ 2/ 83).<br />
I was asked in Sydney today how Mr Keating would get his hands<br />
on this money. I said then, and I repeat now, that a Labor<br />
Government could pass laws to give directions to the banks.<br />
Indeed, in its prices and incomes policy document, Labor says<br />
it will even make institutions like building societies and<br />
finance companies subject to Commonwealth direction.<br />
Or they could put up interest rates so much by their borrowing<br />
programs, including using funny bonds, that money wouldn't<br />
be available for people to borrow for huuiiz'j lva 6v1 for<br />
their small businesses.<br />
We all remember in 1975 how Mr Whitlam was going to use the money<br />
in private banks to pay public service salaries because he had<br />
been denied supply by the Parliament.<br />
Labor today, with Mr Keating as Shadow Treasurer, clearly still<br />
would have no compunction about how they would use the banking<br />
system for their own needs.<br />
This afternoon, Mr Keating has tried to hide the true intentions<br />
of Labor by making wild accusations about other people. All I've<br />
done is quote his own words. Those words are around his neck.<br />
They will drown him and his Party.<br />
Australians will reject out of hand this attempted use of<br />
Government power. </p>
