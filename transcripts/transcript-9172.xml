PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING, M. P.<br />
PRIME MINISTER'S RURAL REGIONAL TASK FORCE<br />
I am pleased to announce that the Rural and Regional Taskforce headed by<br />
theMember for Page, Mr Harry Woods, is to prepare a report in to the<br />
Remote Air Services Subsidy ( RASS) Scheme.<br />
The scheme presently services many remote communities in far North<br />
Queensland, the Northern Territory and parts of South and Western<br />
Australia. The Rural and Regional Taskforce will report to the Government on the<br />
impact of the scheme on those local communities.<br />
The Taskforce will meet major users of the scheme in Darwin and Cairns in<br />
the week beginning April 1 1th, and will also meet representatives of the<br />
Isolated Children's Parents' Association and representatives from Aboriginal<br />
communities. They will also discuss the scheme with members of some of<br />
the outlying communities which RASS helps to service.<br />
For further information: Mr Harry Woods MP ( 066) 426 356<br />
