FOR PRESS 8 SEPTEMBER 1978<br />
OPENING OF NORTHERN TERRITORY<br />
LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY<br />
Your Excellency, Your Honour, Mr Speaker, Honourable<br />
Members, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen.<br />
This is an exciting day for the Northern Territory.<br />
Just three months ago, the Commonwealth Parliament<br />
passed the historic Northern Territory ( Self-Government)<br />
Act 1978.<br />
That Act established this Territory as a distinct body<br />
politic within the Australian federation. It vested, in<br />
the new Government of the Northern Territory, executive<br />
authority over a wide range of matters.<br />
The powers of this Government will be further enlarged<br />
next year, when on 1 January health, and on 1 July<br />
education, also become its responsibility.<br />
You are embarking on one of the noblest adventures open<br />
to any people democratic self-government. It is one<br />
of the hardest systems in the world to run, but it is<br />
also certainly the best.<br />
Democratic self-government involves the building of a<br />
consensus on policies and actions; on maintaining mutual<br />
trust and confidence; on protecting the rights of<br />
minorities; on enhancing individual freedom and tolerance<br />
for alternative lifestyles; on recognizing that there is<br />
a public interest in which we all share. This is a complex<br />
and challenging task. The fact that you are embracing it<br />
with such enthusiasm determined to surmount the problems<br />
which will inevitably confront you is to be applauded.<br />
You are choosing the only form of government that truly<br />
represents the people and that is truly responsible to<br />
the people. The only system that provides the ultimate<br />
guarantee of freedom and good government the right of<br />
the people to change a government merely by casting a vote.<br />
But democratic self-government is much more than just a<br />
method of exacting responsibility from Government. ' It is<br />
of the most fundamental importance to peoples' development.<br />
To allowing people to realise their potential through<br />
politica. participation; to enhancing their initiative,<br />
enterprise and responsibility. </p>
<p>John Stuart Mill wrote: " The most important point of<br />
excellence which any form of government can possess is<br />
to promote the virtue and intelligence of the people<br />
themselves. The first question in respect to any<br />
political institution is how far they tend to foster<br />
in the members o-E the community the various desirable<br />
qualities moral, intellectual and active."<br />
Democratic representative government is an institution<br />
which does foster these qualities and there lies its<br />
ultimate justification the freedom and responsibility<br />
that it makes possible and that it requires.<br />
For decades ultimate authority for the administration<br />
of the laws governing the Territory's day to day affairs<br />
was held by people thousands of miles away. People who did<br />
not always comprehend the Territory's special needs.<br />
Mr Speaker and Honourable Members, the remedy now lies<br />
in your hands. I do not wish to speak today in any<br />
detail of financial matters and no doubt Honourable Members<br />
are already well acquainted with the memorandum of<br />
understanding signed by your Chief Minister and myself.<br />
But there is one observation about the new financial<br />
arrangements that I wish to make.<br />
In negotiating these arrangements, we are determined that<br />
there should be a direct relationship between the expenditure<br />
determined by the citizens of the Territory and the taxes<br />
and charges levied in the Territory. By so doing, we were<br />
seeking to put responsibility where it should be. In the<br />
absence of such procedures, self-government would have<br />
fallen short of responsible self-government, and power<br />
without responsibility is the very antithesis of our<br />
democratic system.<br />
The new arrangements still provide for considerable financial<br />
assistance from the Commonwealth, and leave wide scope for<br />
your Treasurer to put into effect your Government's policies<br />
in accordance with its own priorities.<br />
To all Honourable Members of this House, I wish you well<br />
in the great tasks and opportunities that await you.<br />
Inevitably you will attract criticism and that in<br />
itself is healthy. But you will also attract, whichever<br />
party is in power, something else to which you should not<br />
succumb the great Australian disease of " knocking".<br />
Too often Australians have concentrated on purely destructive<br />
criticism on trying to pull things down without thought<br />
to the consequences and without seeking to put anything<br />
in its place. The only criticism really worth listening<br />
to is that which presents a constructive alternative. / 3 </p>
<p>We all have an obligation to work together and to build<br />
on those great values we all share as Australians. The<br />
things that unite us are far more important than any<br />
differences we may have.<br />
By breaking down the Australian tradition of knocking<br />
and by working together to create a stronger sense of<br />
national purzose and co-operation, there is nothing<br />
we cannot achieve.<br />
The Commonwealth will give every assistance it can in<br />
the years ahead, working to maintain the close<br />
consultation and co-operation between our two governments,<br />
which has been established during the two years of planning<br />
and negotiation that were needed to bring self-government<br />
to reality.<br />
I have every confidence that, with concerted effort and the<br />
support of the people, the future for the Northern<br />
Territory is secure and I look forward to the day when<br />
the Northern territory finally becomes the seventh state<br />
of Australia. </p>
