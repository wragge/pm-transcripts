THE PRIME MINISTER'S PRESS CONFERENCE<br />
WITH MR. MICHAEL SOMARE<br />
CHIEF MINISTER OF PAPUA NEW GUINEA<br />
AT PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA<br />
WEDNESDAY, 17 JANUARY 1973<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Ladies and gentlemen: the Chief Minister and<br />
the Minister for External Territories and I have had discussions this<br />
morning and this afternoon on matters concerning our two countries.<br />
You have a copy of the communique which we prepared. Are there<br />
any questions yo'd. like to ask us?<br />
Have you all finished reading the communique?<br />
A. Yes.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I should have said also that the Treasurer<br />
is issuing a statement about the Commonwealth guarantee of Papua<br />
New Guinea loans until independence comes about. Have you got<br />
copies of that too?<br />
A. Yes.<br />
Q. You say on page 3 of the communique that the Australian<br />
Government is willing in principle to negotiate the relocation of<br />
the border between Australia and Papua New Guinea and would not allow<br />
any narrow considerations to obstruct such a settlement. Can you tell<br />
us exactly what form this negotiation would take. In particular,<br />
would you feel it necessary to pass the Territorial Sea and<br />
Continental Shelf Bill'first through Parliament?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No. This can be a separate issue.<br />
Q. Would you regard it as an area in which the Queensland<br />
Government might be able to take a challenge to the High Court?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't want to express a legal opinion on this.<br />
Very careful consideration has been given to the wording of the<br />
communique on this point and I'd rather leave it as it is.<br />
Q. When you say that there are constitutional considerations<br />
which have to be taken into account and which might delay the matter,<br />
can you tell us how long a delay you ' re thinking of and precisely<br />
what constitutional considerations?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Political development often takes longer in the<br />
Legislative Assembly of Queensland than in the House of Assembly<br />
of Papua New Guinea, and we have in mind that a Queensland Act<br />
which would be the simplest way of resolving it might take longer<br />
than it will take the House of Assembly to vote a timetable for<br />
independence. </p>
<p>Q. in the communique your Government still seems to be<br />
aiming for 1974?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: We're working towards that, yes.<br />
Q. And the Chief Minister still seems to be keeping an open<br />
date on that. Do you see any difference still between you working<br />
for independence dates?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No. At this stage, Australia has to speak f or<br />
Papua New Guinea in international councils such-as the United<br />
Nations and, accordingly, it is easier for Australian elected persons<br />
to realise international feelings on this matter than it is for all<br />
elected persons in Papua New Guinea to realise such matters. The<br />
communique points out the resolution of the United Nations<br />
General Assembly on this matter. You will notice that on 14<br />
December, the General Assembly called on Australia to prepare<br />
in consultation with the Government of Papua New Guinea a<br />
further timetable for independence. There's no particular<br />
significance in the fact that this resolution was passed with<br />
Australia's support after the elections. The late Government had<br />
in fact supported the same resolution in the Fourth Committee in<br />
November. So there is no difference between the parties in the<br />
Australian Parliament on this proposal.<br />
Q. I meant differences between you anft the Chief Minister.<br />
We've still got an open date. He's not committed to 1974?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No. We are working towards it.<br />
Q. But the Chief Minister doesn't accept the date as 1974?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: He doesn't operate in the context of the<br />
House of Assembly.<br />
Q. May I ask a question of M-r. Somare?<br />
PRIME MINISTER. Yes, gentlemen, as a matter of fact I was<br />
hoping that most of the questions would be directed to the<br />
Chief Minister.<br />
0. Chief Minister, Mr. Somare: Are you disappointed to find<br />
that your Government and the Australian Government is not in unison<br />
on the question of independence for New Guinea?<br />
CHIEF MINISTER: I'm not disappointed at all. All I've said is<br />
that we have to see how we operate in Papua New Guinea context.<br />
We have got certain problems. We've got problems of people having<br />
to understand what we tell them and as elected representatives of<br />
the people. We have to get their feelings where the feelings<br />
are and, of course, this is an example of what happened. My<br />
group, in particular, went out saying that we had to have selfgovernment<br />
in 1972 and independence soon after that, and we feel<br />
in Papua New Guinea that this has come so quick, no one expected that<br />
T wol sitting where I am today and I said to them that these<br />
changes will come. Whether we like it or not, change must come.<br />
Now the same thing applies with the independence. Just that there<br />
are some sections of the community in Papua New Guinea who are not<br />
used to it, maybe the word independence is so confused in their<br />
minds and people don't know what independence is. There have been<br />
threats of independence comes, exodus of white people, they take all<br />
their money away j Australia withdraws its grant its monetary </p>
<p>assistance and so on, And this is the fear. Once this is<br />
explained to people, it's a matter of only accepting it once<br />
people know really what independence is all about.<br />
Q. Sir, in your talks with the Prime Minister today have<br />
you sought assurances as to the continuation of support and-the<br />
degree of continuation of support for Papua New Guinea after<br />
independence? What sort of reassurances have you received?<br />
CHIEF MINISTER: With my talks with the Prime Minister today,<br />
we have had this assurance I've had this assurance that the<br />
Australian Government will continue to give us financial assistance<br />
even close to independence and after independence if the Papua<br />
New Guinea Government wants Australia's assistance.<br />
Q. Has this been quantified? Have you indicated how much<br />
support you will need or require?<br />
CHIEF MINISTER: No, we haven't said anything about what<br />
actual figure that we want, but assistance in manpower, financial<br />
assistance and so on.<br />
Q. Sir, what's your personal preference on when the<br />
Territory should be given * independence. We were talking earlier<br />
about the feeling of the people and explaining it to them. Now<br />
what's your personal preference on when?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Remember he was up with us in Wewak<br />
three years ago?<br />
CHIEF MINISTER: Sometimes it's very difficult and when you met me<br />
some years ago you felt that things couldn't have changed much faster<br />
than you expected and today you've seen the change. So change is<br />
like that.<br />
0. What's your personal preference, Sir?<br />
CHIEF MINISTER: Well, I have said it. After self-government,<br />
will come independence, but it is a matter for us to be able to work<br />
out and if the House of Assembly endorses a timetable which, when<br />
we ask for House of Assembly's endorsement, and if House of Assembly<br />
agrees that could be maybe towards the end of 1974 could be middle<br />
of 1975, so it's very difficult to work out the exact date.<br />
Q. Chief Minister, one of the problems of independence will<br />
be the question of unity. We read reports last week of the<br />
incidents you faced in Bougainville and the successionist<br />
demonstrators in Bougainville. Did you raise t. hese at all in your<br />
talks today with the Prime Minister?<br />
CHIEF MINISTER: This is quite true that you would have the question<br />
of unity in the country but I think the people of Papua n~ ew Guinea<br />
would know by standing together they can achieve more. 2t is<br />
quite true in my last week's tour of Bougainville you have this<br />
feeling. maybe it came in the wrong time when two of my senior<br />
public servants were involved in the incident and were killed.<br />
And I went to Bougainvilile at the wrong time when people were ai11<br />
emotional about the whole matter, but I find that in Bougainville<br />
itself and in other places if there is a need for quicker<br />
development, they'd rather go much faster because when you take<br />
Bougainville it's much more people are mu'ch more sophisticated </p>
<p>people have had dealings a long time there are a lot more<br />
educated people on the island, So you have to work with this<br />
feeling and for my position in the country it is very difficult<br />
to be able to say we had to wait you have to get people in<br />
Gazelle Peninsula and Bougainville, possible in New Island<br />
and other places to wait so if you want to get unity in the<br />
country all you have to do is let's show something let's show that<br />
we can do something on our own. They feel that they are part of<br />
the whole show. But if you wait too long, you'll probably find that<br />
you've got this kind of feeling.<br />
Q. Mr. Whitlam, may I return, while we're still on this<br />
question of independence, to you, Sir: In the reference in the<br />
communique on top of page 2 to the timing for independence you say<br />
that the Government would work towards 1974. This would be subject<br />
to consultation with the Government of New Guinea and the<br />
endorsement of the House of Assembly. Is this a firm undertaking<br />
the Australian Government will not unilaterally declare the<br />
independence of Papua New Guinea?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, I think in practical terms Papua New<br />
Guinea will move just as surely and rapidly to independence as<br />
we all now observe that she has moved to self-government. In<br />
effect, there is self-government already in Papua New Guinea. The<br />
Australian Government exercises no authority makes no decisions<br />
internally in Papua New Guinea without consulting the Chief Minister<br />
and his Government. Perhaps I should explain the reference to<br />
endorsement by the House of Assembly as representing the wishes of<br />
the people refers to the sections of the Charter of the United<br />
Nations dealing with the trusteeship system. It indicates that the<br />
Australian Government will seek the endorsement by the Trusteeship<br />
Council of the United Nations of the view that on the question of<br />
independence as hitherto on the question of self-government the<br />
House of Assembly is regarded as representing the wishes of . the<br />
people. In other words it is to counteract the idea which is<br />
spread in some quarters that there should be a plebiscite or a<br />
referendum. The late Australian Government, the present<br />
Australian Government, the Trusteeship Council, successive Houses<br />
of Assembly is Papua New Guinea have all taken the attitude that<br />
the House of Assembly expresses the wishes of the people in the<br />
terms of the charter.<br />
Q. Does that mean you need a majority vote in the House of<br />
Assembly before New Guinea can be declardd independent?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, no. You don't have to have it. In<br />
practical terms you will have it. You don't have to have it, but in<br />
practical terms you will.<br />
0. May I ask the Chief Minister a couple of points about the<br />
Torres Strait border? Mr. Somare, where precisely would you like<br />
the border to be? How far south would you like it to come? Are<br />
you planning at any time to confer with the Queensland Government<br />
yourself and explain to them what you'd like, and I notice on page 3<br />
that you say you are confident it would be possible to reach a<br />
solution. If you don't reach a solution will you take it to the<br />
International Court for a solution? </p>
<p>CHIEF MINISTER: Well I think I'll have to answer you back to front.<br />
Talking about going to International Court we are not yet a sovereign<br />
country and this is something that we cannot test on the International<br />
Court. Your first point which you raised was that we have no<br />
I have no intention at the moment to talk with the Premier of<br />
Queensland. This idea of disputing the boundary -we are thinking of<br />
taking it down JO degrees south coming together -I think it's the<br />
Commonwealth's prerogativeto be able to talk with each State and we<br />
as a non-sovereign country I don't see my position as jumping the<br />
Commonwealth to go and talk to the Queensland Premier. So my position<br />
at the moment is all I have to do is communicate to the Commonwealth.<br />
Q. But you'd like to be at the 10 degree parallel?<br />
CHIEF MINISTER: South.<br />
Q. Sir, on that same question on page 4 the phrase you used<br />
as the Australian Government: Would it facilitate contact between<br />
the Papua New Guinea Government and the islanders and does that mean<br />
that you plan to visit the islands, would you like to visit the<br />
islands?<br />
CHIEF MINISTER: No, I have no plans at this stage to visit the<br />
islands. I'm hoping that the officials from the Australian Government<br />
and officials from our Government will have to sit down and talk about<br />
it and then find out from the people concerned on the island what<br />
their feelings are before we start talking about whether we should go<br />
and visit the island or whether the Australian Government should go and<br />
visit the island.<br />
Q. Chief Minister, on the question of Bougainville again, did<br />
you get any impression from your visit there that they really did want<br />
to secedeand if they did would you have any power to stop them?<br />
CHIEF MINISTER: Well there is a feeling all throughout the island<br />
in my week's travel throughout the island of Bougainville there is a<br />
feeling of secession. This was expressed that we want to be ab&amp; e<br />
to break away but there is also a feeling of we want to have autonomy<br />
for our own island. There were suggestions made on our relationship<br />
between the central Government and this is something which the<br />
Constitutional Planning Committee of the House of Assembly has to sit<br />
down and work out, what sort of powers they should have as the<br />
central Government and what sort of powers should we go for<br />
regional type government or we have to move ahead so that people<br />
feel that they haven't been left out.<br />
Q. Mr. Chief Minister, following on Bougainville, obviously<br />
Bougainville Copper has a fairly large place in the economic<br />
planning of Papua New Guinea. I was wondering if you could tell<br />
us whether you have any indication whether Bougainville Copper<br />
as a company is attempting to prevent secession or is, in fact,<br />
working towards secession on Bougainville.<br />
CHIEF MINISTER: Well I'd be it would look silly on my part<br />
to say that they are working to prevent they are deliberately<br />
encouraging it because I don't know what the feeling of Bougainville<br />
Copper is. </p>
<p>Q. Chief Minister, if I may, on page 4 of the communique it says<br />
that Australia also agreed to an urgent examination of the Chief<br />
M~ inister's request for a continuing aid commitment. As I understood<br />
you were coming here today to look for confirmation of an earlier<br />
promise. That seems to fall short of what you're looking for?<br />
CHIEF MINISTER: Well, I've been given verbal assurance by the<br />
Treasurer, the Honourable Mr. Crean, that this will be done<br />
this is the verbal assurance I have got and this is something<br />
that we still have got discussions to come sometime this year that<br />
we will also be taking this one up again. But I've been given a verbal<br />
assurance that this aid will continue.<br />
Q. Mr. Somare, you indicated talking about Bougainville a<br />
moment ago that you are thinking in terms of giving Bougainville<br />
a reasonable degree of regional autonomy. I think your Government<br />
has already more or less, agreed to do the same for the Gazelle<br />
Peninsula. Do you think it is possible to give certain areas a<br />
lot of regional autonomy without giving it to all areas and thus<br />
to weaken the authority of the central government throughout the<br />
country? CHIEF MINISTER: Well, this is something... It could be very<br />
difficult at this stage, but this is something which the<br />
Constitutional Planning Committee will have to look at very<br />
closely. Whether the system and type of government which we are<br />
following at the moment is workable in our society and this is wherethis<br />
was the purpose of setting up a Constitutional Planning Committee<br />
to be able to find out what type of government-what kind of rules we<br />
would like to set up whether the system which we have got suits the<br />
people and their needs. So it could be very difficult for us<br />
to say we should give all the regional governments to everyone.<br />
There are problems, certainly there are problems in certain areas of<br />
Papua New Guinea, but this is something which the Constitutional<br />
Planning Committee has to come up with the answer. What would be<br />
our direction what pattern of government we should follow. So<br />
it is very difficult for me to say what we're going to follow till<br />
such time as the people of Papua New Guinea tell their<br />
Constitutional Planning Committee what they want.<br />
Q. Are you prepared to express your own personal preference<br />
for a regional type of government or not, Sir?<br />
CHIEF MINISTER: Sometimes it's very difficult to express one's<br />
personal opinion but I have always felt that you have a government<br />
which we have got at the moment -we have used the system for the<br />
last generation that this is the pattern we have been following<br />
but if the majority of the people of Papua New Guinea decide they<br />
want to have something else, well, it's a majority decision.<br />
Q. Given the complexity of this problem of self-government and<br />
the problems of consulting the different groups in the country and<br />
reaching some sort of concensus, have you got enough time between<br />
now and the end of next year to come to a proper decision on the<br />
constitutional arrangements for the country or is the end of 1974<br />
pushing it a bit too close? </p>
<p>CHIEF M4INISTER: I think we've got time, but we sometimes in Papua<br />
New Guinea like to take our time and time in the Australian sense<br />
doesn't appeal to us much, but I feel, you know, that wqe've got a lot<br />
of time to be able to work out something and eventually we'll have<br />
self-government in the time that we said.<br />
Q. If you feel you can't get the House of Assembly behind you for<br />
independence say, by the end of 1974, do you see the Australian<br />
Government standing up to international opinion on your behalf and<br />
supporting you with a later date for independence?<br />
CHIEF MINISTER: Well I would say that darlier when it started round<br />
about 1968 people were against self-government and they said no<br />
self-government for Papua New Guinea for another 50 or 100 years, but<br />
things went very fast and I don't expect this to happen. Once people<br />
know what they are doing-once they know what independence is All<br />
about I think people will realise, and we would come much closer<br />
than we expected.<br />
Q. Mr. Somare, on the border question again, do you, Sir, see any<br />
valid point in the suggestion that; s been made in a few quarters<br />
here that there should be a pleviscite of the people who live on the<br />
islands concerned with any border realignments involved in the<br />
suggestion you've made? And secondly, do you see anything less than<br />
the possibility that, when the border is realigned, it will involve the<br />
complete transfer of sovereignty over the land areas that are<br />
concerned to Papua New Guinea on your side of that border?<br />
CHIEF MINISTER% Well your first question about plebiscite: this<br />
is something which I don't know what the Queensland Premier would dowhether<br />
hie wants a plebiscite for the Torres Strait Islanders but<br />
I'd say that, as far as we are concerned, we feel that there are areas<br />
in which these people are ethnically related to some of the western<br />
district people and we could find out, as I said, there'll be official<br />
groups from the Australian Government and from my Government that will<br />
be seeking their views to find out sometimes a plebiscite can end<br />
up with yes and no answers and you really don't know what the people's<br />
thinking is. Coming back to your second point which you raised about<br />
problems. As I said earlier that I thi ' nk we, the Papua New Guinea<br />
Government and the Australian Government willcome to some common<br />
agreement on the line that we want to be able to operate from<br />
the seabed and so on, and I think this is something,* as I said<br />
earlier, this is the Commonwealth's per ogative and as a nonsovereign<br />
country I don't think we are in a position to be able to<br />
take it up to court to dispute that and this matter would lie in<br />
the hands of the Commonwealth Government, and we will be talking with<br />
the Commonwealth Government and Queensland Government to sort out this<br />
thing to find a compromise position.<br />
Q. Mr. Whitlam, may I ask you a question. Sir, on page 4 of the<br />
communique you talk about a provisional agreement regarding the<br />
sovereignty over the Territory regarding the border question. The<br />
provisionayI agreement related you said to seabed division fishing<br />
and navigational rights. Is it an undertaking by the Australian<br />
Government to hand these rights over to Papua New Guinea once you have<br />
the power presumably under the Territorial Seas Bill?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The power-would not only be under the Act you<br />
mentioned, Mr. Barnes. it would also be under the external affairs </p>
<p>power once Paptua New Guinea is a sovereign state. These matters are<br />
determined by agreement say, between Australia and Indonesia<br />
already they have been. They are in the process of being determined<br />
between Indonesia and Papua New Guinea at this moment.<br />
Q. In both cases though, would the endorsement of the States<br />
involved PRIME MINISTER: There is no purported State interest in those cases.<br />
There can be no obstruction by the State in those two cases. When<br />
Papua New Guinea is an inddpendent sovereign nation as of course<br />
Indonesia is, then it would be presumably completely possible for<br />
Australia and Papua New Guinea to come to a sensible, as contemporary<br />
an agreement on these matters as it has been for Indonesia and Australia<br />
to come to such an agreement. I point out again as th1e communique<br />
mentions that this is a matter of which the United Nations has taken<br />
notice, the visiting mission to Papua New Guinea in January, February,<br />
early part of March in 1971 referred to it. The position is that the<br />
purported border between Queensland and Papua passes less than a mile<br />
from the Papuan coast for a distance of more than 60 miles. There<br />
are within that what's ordinarily called by any standard " territorial<br />
waters" three islands with a population of 370 people. The visiting<br />
mission pointed out that this question could harm good relations in<br />
the future between Australia and Papua New Guinea. The mission said<br />
the question is one which in the opinion of the mission merits being<br />
kept under constant review. Now it is of course an intolerable position<br />
to say that people in any country can't go from one part of the<br />
country to another part of the country without going through the<br />
territory of another country. Somebody mentioned the International<br />
Court of Justice. I would not believe that the International Court<br />
of Justice would validate such a situation. I wouldn't believe<br />
that the United Nations General Assembly would validate it. It ought<br />
to be possible to solve this matter while Australia has jurisdiction<br />
on both sides of the Torres Strait. The Queensland Government however<br />
will not come to the party. As the communique points out an<br />
interdepartmental committee of Australian Government officials<br />
recommended that there should be discussions between Australian<br />
Government and Queensland Government officials last July. The<br />
former Attorney-General, Senator Greenwood, made this<br />
recommendation to the former Prime Minister in October. The former<br />
Minister for External Territories, Mr Peacock, reiterated the<br />
recommendation to the former Prime Minister in November. I was<br />
attracted to the recommendation of Mr Morrison's predecessor, the<br />
preceding Attorney, and I put the proposition to the Queensland<br />
Premier, and he sees no merit in it.<br />
Q. Mr Morrison, in view of what Mr Whitlam has just said and in<br />
view of what Mr Somare has said that he is not prepared and doesn't<br />
wish to speak to the Queensland Government, are you now prepared<br />
to seek a meeting with Mr Bjelke-Petersen to put the views of<br />
Mr Somare and the views Of the Government?<br />
MR MORRISON: Relations with the State of Queensland don't fall within<br />
my portfolio.<br />
0. Not even on this subject?<br />
MR MORRISON: I'll be involved in the coflSltations from the<br />
Australian side but it wouldn't be a diretresponsibility of mine. </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER; Gentlemen, on this matter, reference is very<br />
frequently made to the Australian citizenship of the Torres Strait<br />
Islanders. You will notice that Papuans of course are also<br />
Australian citizens and will remain such until Papua New Guinea<br />
becomes a sovereign state. The Chief Minister has pointed out<br />
that his Government will be intent on safeguarding the interests of those<br />
Australian citizens who reside on the islands in the Strait.<br />
Q. Have you discussed the question of trans-migration of<br />
these Australian citizens Sir?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: We believe that there should be complete freedom<br />
of movement by Australian citizens anywhere within Australian<br />
jurisdiction. Q. Will you allow that for the Papuans into Australia, Sir?<br />
PRIME MINISTER; There are Papuan Ministers who have asked<br />
if they may visit the islands and we've said of course. Gentlemen,<br />
some of you were three years ago up in Wewak with the Chief Minister<br />
and me and I think some of you didn't at that time have sufficient<br />
faith that we'd be holding the positions we now have.<br />
CHIEF MINISTER: I don't think they did. </p>
