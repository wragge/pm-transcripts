SPEECH BY THE PRIM4E MINISTER<br />
THE HON. E. G. WHITLAM, M. P.,<br />
AT AN INTERNATIONAL WOMEN" S DAY RECEPTION<br />
MELBOURNE, 8 MARCH, 1975<br />
This day, 8 March, 1975, and this gathering tonight<br />
have an historical significance far beyond the occasion.<br />
Today, International Women's Day, has been celebrated for<br />
well over sixty years as the day on which women, particularly<br />
working women, come together to make their voices heard and<br />
their problems known.<br />
This year, International Women's Year, is a year<br />
which has come into being because women like yourselves<br />
individual women, fighting *~ omen, women with determination<br />
and spirit have not easily taken no for an answer, have<br />
not believed those who told them " It is not women's work",<br />
or " It can not be done by women."<br />
International Women's Year, as all of you who<br />
fought and won and lost and came back to fight again will<br />
know, is not going to solve the problems of the world, the<br />
problems of women and through them of men and of children.<br />
It is however, our responsibility, the responsibility of you<br />
the women of Australia and of us your Government, to try to<br />
ensure that this year the world will be given a shove in the<br />
right direction a shove without which changes for the good<br />
of women, of all women, not just a few might never occur.<br />
The history of International Women's Day is often<br />
traced back to 1909 when women garment workers poured out of<br />
every garment factory in New York, Brooklyn, Philadelphia and<br />
Chicago protesting against the sweatshop conditions under which<br />
they had to work. It was like a mighty army rising in the<br />
night and demanding to be heard. The response was violence,<br />
assault and arrest. Half the women were under the age of<br />
twenty. Their demands were for the organization of all workers<br />
into trade unions, for equal pay for equal work, and eight hour<br />
day, a living wage and full citizenship for women.<br />
During the next eight years women workers all over<br />
the world rose and protested about their working conditions.<br />
Their demands were the same, and a further demand was added<br />
as the First World War approached the demand for peace, a<br />
protest against the ease with which the world was headed<br />
towards war. In 1910, it was proposed that March 8 should<br />
be set aside as a special day for women, a day to remind the<br />
world of women's demands for justice in the work force, for<br />
a place in society, for peace rather than violence and conflict.<br />
Here in Australia we have the same splendid<br />
tradition a past of which we can be justly proud. Our<br />
women formed their own trade unions and rose up from their<br />
workbenches. The great seamstresses' strike of 1882, here<br />
in Melbourne, led not only to an -&gt; n. provement in the working<br />
/ 2. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
conditions of their own industry but to a general<br />
investigation of the conditions under which both women<br />
and men were labouring. The findings of this inquiry<br />
were so appalling that they led to the formulation of<br />
the factory acts and other legislation aimed at protecting<br />
workers. As the First World War approached our women were<br />
increasingly concerned by an easy acceptance of the<br />
inevitability of war. Many anti-war and anti-conscription<br />
women's groups were started, including the Women's Peace<br />
Army. Their fight for peace was untiring and uncompromising.<br />
When the Depression camne the women were not content to sit<br />
idle. Nor were they contentviith the handing out of charity.<br />
Women's Employment Bureaux run by women and for women<br />
sprang up all over the country. Here in Victoria, clothing<br />
factories, jam factories and rural industries, to name<br />
but a few, were established to provide employment for<br />
unemployed and poverty-stricken women. The same happened<br />
throughout the rest of Australia.<br />
In more recent times we have seen the wives of<br />
the Wollongong miners refuse to allow scab labour to work<br />
their husbands' mines. We have seen the women in a small<br />
factory in Whyalla refuse to be retrenched and set themselves<br />
up as a co-operative under their own management.<br />
Creating their own employment opportunities. And only<br />
weeks ago here in Melbourne there was the dramatic stand<br />
of a small group of women in the metal trades.<br />
Many women in Australia have stood up and fought<br />
for decent working conditions for women, for a living wage<br />
and for equal pay for work of equal value. Many women in<br />
Australia have marched through the streets on 8 March<br />
reminding us Australians of these demands and of the demand<br />
for peace. This day in Australia is part of a tradition of which<br />
we can be truly proud. And it has not only been the women of<br />
Australia who have fought for justice for women in the<br />
workplace and for peace in the world. Men, too, have fought<br />
for these demands. Many men, too, have marched our streets<br />
demanding a rate for the job, peace and protection against<br />
unjst., laws. The Federal Parliamentary Labor Party as early as<br />
1901 accepted unanimously a motion that women should get not<br />
equal pay for equal work, but, much more significantly, equal.<br />
pay for work of equal value. The Labor Governments of<br />
Australia can be proud of our historical record in this<br />
area, a record not just of rhetoric but of action.<br />
Immediately this Government came to power in<br />
December 1972 we abolished conscription and re-opened the<br />
National Wage Case arguing cogently and successfully for<br />
acceptance of the principle of equal pay for work of equal </p>
<p>value. In May 1974 we again went to the Arbitration<br />
Commission arguing that, in all justice, women as well<br />
as men should be given a: minimum wage below which no<br />
human being should be asked to work. Both these<br />
judgements have been contentious: Just principles are<br />
rarely implemented without problems, but we are proud<br />
that we have not compromised our principles and by<br />
June of this year both these judgements will be fully<br />
implemented. This makes 8 March 1975 even more significant.<br />
I might mention here that an ILO Study has shown that in the<br />
year ending June 1974 the world's biggest increase in real<br />
wages for women in manufacturing industry went to Australian<br />
women. Then real wages went up by 16%. From December 1972<br />
to the December quarter 1974 average minimum weekly award<br />
rates for women increased by 73%.<br />
Equal pay alone will not bring about justice in<br />
the work force. We are aware of this and have shown this<br />
awareness in our actions. When this Government came to power<br />
in December 1972 its program for women was two-fold: First<br />
to correct the past injustices from which they had suffered<br />
and, secondly to lessen distress and suffering, to respond<br />
sensitively to social problems affecting women and children.<br />
These latter problems, problems which have continually<br />
arisen within Australian Society, include the need for shelters,<br />
health centres, contraceptive advice, rape crisis centres,<br />
marital counselling, problems facing women with young children,<br />
their recreation and leisure needs, their need for company<br />
and ease of movement and programs relating to the welfare of<br />
women. Shelters and refuges for women can be traced back<br />
beyond the work of Caroline Chisolm. An understanding of<br />
the pressing need for health services relating directly to<br />
the health problems of women gave birth in 1899 to the Queen<br />
Victoria Hospital here in Melbourne, staffed by and run for<br />
women. The welfare problems of women have been recoqnised<br />
and worked for by all the great women in the past. Catherine<br />
Spence, Vida Goldstein, Muriel Heagney, Rose Scott, Jessie<br />
Street, Edith Cowan are among the better known of these<br />
many, many women.<br />
To this day the majority of poor people in Australia<br />
are women, including mothers many of them single or deserted<br />
mothers. The need to create a more humane world for these<br />
women is an overwhelming concern of this Government: We<br />
introduced the Supporting Mother's Benefit, we removed the<br />
sales tax on the pill, we are funding women'srefuges, women's<br />
health centres and family planning centres. / 4. </p>
<p>-4-<br />
Perhaps the most exciting development has been the<br />
acceptance of the need for multi-purpose centres, centres<br />
concerned with all the needs of women in the area. The Hunter<br />
Region Working Women's Centre in Newcastle is one such centre.<br />
It will cater for women's health, welfare, educational, workforce<br />
and legal problems as well as providing recreation and<br />
child care facilities.<br />
To ensure that no area of need will be overlooked<br />
that no social problem relating to women, whether they be<br />
married or not, with or without children, aboriginal or<br />
newcomer, English speaking or not, young or old, rural or<br />
urban, will be hidden away, forgotten or neglected we<br />
have established a Royal Commission into Human Relationships.<br />
It is the First Royal Commission in history to investigate<br />
such social problems.<br />
Of the first kind of demand, the demand for fairness<br />
and for justice, we have again shown a sensitivity to the<br />
existence of these problems and a determination to understand<br />
and overcome them.<br />
Our concern has been for women at home as well as at<br />
work, for women in the unpaid as well as in the paid workforce.<br />
We have introduced anti-discrimination committees throughout<br />
Australia, new training and retraining opportunities. We<br />
have made every effort to ensure that * unemployed or retrenched<br />
women are not overlooked. We have also, in exempting the<br />
matrimonial home from the dutiable value of the family's estate,<br />
publicly recognised for the first time in the history of<br />
Australia that the person who looks after the home and family<br />
contributes as much to the economic value of that family's<br />
home as the person who goes to work.*<br />
Further, mothers, indeed parents, whether they remain<br />
at home or are in the paid workforce, need help and support in<br />
the care of their children.<br />
In the last year Australia has introduced a program<br />
of childhood services the first of its kind in the world. It<br />
is not designed to impose an arbitrary blueprint on the children<br />
of Australia and their parents. Rather it is to be flexible<br />
enough and integrated enough to respond at the neighbourhood<br />
level to all their needs.<br />
This program has begun to be implemented and<br />
million has been set aside for this financial year alone.<br />
Many of the projects being funded under this scheme are<br />
innovative and 6xciting, and the implementation of this<br />
program is going ahead as fast as is humatly possible. It<br />
will be some years however, before its effects become widely<br />
visible, before the present overwhelming needs will be satisfied. </p>
<p>No matter how genuine our attempts to ensure that<br />
women at work and at home are justly cared for, it is the<br />
range of possibilities, expectations and limitations which<br />
are instilled in girls in school which limit the scope of<br />
their later aspirations and determine the patterns of their<br />
future life. The importance of education as the major<br />
determinant of a child's future and the role that education<br />
has to play in motivating women to take up the challenge of<br />
new roles and of new life patterns is now being recognised.<br />
These changes which we have undertaken, changes<br />
essential to emotional and financial independence and to the<br />
ability of women to choose freely the future which best suits<br />
her, are based on principles of equity and fairness, on our<br />
desire to correct injustices. We take great pride in these<br />
advances and achievements. It is nevertheless clear that<br />
many problems remain.<br />
Too few women have been involved in making decisions<br />
at all levels of Government, in the Public Service, in the<br />
political parties and in the trade unions. Decisions which<br />
affect their lives both as women and as citizens. This must<br />
concern not only my Government but the whole Australian<br />
Parliament, the State Parliaments, local government<br />
authorities and all other bodies whose day-to-day decisions<br />
on matters of policy and practice affect the lives of all<br />
people, not just men.<br />
Because of this concern the Australian Government<br />
has decided that as part of Australia's activities for<br />
International Women's Year a conference should be held in<br />
Canberra later this year on the theme of women and politics.<br />
It is hoped that this conference will be open to all women<br />
and women's groups and that all political parties and other<br />
relevant organizations will play a part. The intention is<br />
not only to discuss past and present participation by women<br />
in political activities but also to bring about a greater<br />
understanding of the means by which women can participate<br />
in the making of political decisions and the difficulties<br />
that confront them in. so doing. Women from other countries<br />
who, through their elected or appointed positions have<br />
contributed to political change or women who have brought<br />
about significant social or political achievements from<br />
outside government, will also be invited to participate.<br />
The major problem, however, in the course of this<br />
year is to ensure that our efforts are more than a fleeting,<br />
token gesture to lull women into a false belief that their<br />
problems are at last being taken seriously and understood in<br />
all their complexity. My Governir~ nt has not committed itself<br />
and will not commit itself to any program which it does not<br />
genuinely believe is both desired by the women of Australia </p>
<p>-6-<br />
and which will be of lasting benefit to them.<br />
During International Women's Year we are advancing and<br />
extending programs which we had already undertaken in<br />
response to the needs of women. But our overriding<br />
task and challenge for this year is to strike out at the<br />
attitudes which cause these difficulties and give rise to<br />
these problems. We must challenge notions such as that of the breadwinner<br />
and the homemaker; values such as those of ambition,<br />
prestige, status and incessant promotion; dichotomies such<br />
as that between work and home; the hidden and usually<br />
unarticulated assumptions about women's abilities,<br />
capacities, life patte-rns, needs, skills and desires. These<br />
affect women not only in their employment but in the whole<br />
range of their opportunities in life. Both men and women<br />
must be made aware of our habitual patterns of prejudice<br />
which we often do not see as such but whose existence<br />
manifests itself in our language and our behaviour.<br />
During this year, International Women's Year, we<br />
must question, discuss and reassess the attitudes, assumptions,<br />
beliefs and prejudices that society holds about women. We<br />
must create a society in which a woman's place is where she<br />
freely chooses to be, from which neither cultural prejudices,<br />
lack. of education or lack of self-confidence will keep her.<br />
To ' day, International Women's Day, is a start towards<br />
this. This year, International Women's Year, we must work<br />
towards a society which eases the stresses placed upon men in<br />
the workforce, which recognises that home is a place for men<br />
as wdl as women, but which insists that women have a place<br />
with men in the total Australian society.<br />
My Government has always been committed to the<br />
theme of enlarging and equalising opportunities for all<br />
Australians, the theme of creating a more humane, a more<br />
compassionate society for Australians, the need to instil in<br />
women self-confidence and a sense of independence, the need to<br />
see more clearly each other's abilities and potential. We<br />
shall never be content with a society which buys its prosperity,<br />
its well-being at the expense of some other part of that society.<br />
We, all of us, men and women, would be diminished by such a<br />
society. I have no doubt that you, the women of Australia,<br />
have carefully watched the changes that have come about in<br />
the last two years. For these are the changes which you<br />
yourselles have fought for so bravely. This Government may<br />
not always have done them in the way that you thought best,<br />
but we have done them sincerely and to the best of our<br />
ability. More significantly, our successes rest upon and<br />
are due to your determination, your experiences, your defeats<br />
and your successes. </p>
