FOQR MEDIA I AY 1979<br />
SPEEC( : 10F yE LCOMJ3 FOR KOREAN PRIME MIUiSTE I<br />
It gives me great pleasure to extend a warm welcome, Oil<br />
behalf of the Austral ian Government and peoplce, to His<br />
Excellelcy Mr. Chi Kyu-H-ah Pr ine Ministcr of the<br />
Republic of Korea, and his delegation.<br />
Over the last 30 years there have been many di fficul~ ties in<br />
the Korean Peninsula and South East Asia. This has been<br />
an area of turmoil and difficulty, of iiever-cnding challenge.<br />
Your p~ eople were put through the most difficult test of<br />
all invasion, and the danger o~ f the loss of freedom.<br />
You fought, with your allies, for the most precious and most<br />
prized human possess; ion, for freedom and liberty of spirit.<br />
You have worked hard to preserve that. It has often been difficult.<br />
There have been alarms and dangers in the demilitarised zone<br />
and keeping the peace has not been easy. You need the secure:<br />
support of your friends, particularly in the light of a<br />
massive arms build-up by North Korea. It is your own strength,<br />
the support friends and allies, your treaties with the United<br />
States, that are working to prevent war breaking out again.<br />
You have lived under challenge, y'ou've lived under threat,<br />
and you've responded to it magnificently.<br />
Trho Republic of Korea not only has a defence b) urden, you have<br />
the task of building the living standards of your own peel))<br />
By your effort and energy, and despite few natural resources,<br />
your Gross Domestic Product has been rising by 10 percent<br />
a year. Ho0w many advanced countries would wish that they could<br />
achieve that?<br />
You are an example o~ f what a developing country can do when it<br />
allows market forces to operate in the development of trade<br />
and industry. You are an example of what a free people can<br />
do, spurred on by the need to work for survival. For all<br />
these reasons, Mr. Prime Minister, we are particularly glad to<br />
welcome you, your fellow Minister, Mr. Chang Yie Joon, and<br />
your delegation. It i~ s net the first time you have visited<br />
Australia, but it is the first time as Prime Minister, and<br />
we are delighted that you are here. ./ 2 </p>

The rclation ship betwkon Austral. i. a. and the Repub[ c K( oo rca<br />
has strengthened since the Korean War. 1We share many points<br />
of common interest.<br />
Our relationship began when, as a Member of the Uniiitd Nations<br />
Control Commiss ion Australia p1 aycd an active part in the<br />
estab slishmeunt of thie Repub l. ic otf Korea after W1orld War II.<br />
Thec relation ship was strengtthen ed wh en we with other United<br />
Nations Forces, supported the Republic of Korea during the<br />
Korean War. Since that time our rcla tiont ship has developed into<br />
a rich political and economic partnership.<br />
The imost spectacular and easily identied ar-ea of growth in our<br />
relat ionship has been in trade. Since the early 1970' s the value<br />
of trade between us has increased seven fold. ' IThe major reason for<br />
this growlti has been the spectacular econolmic progress made by<br />
your country. I'm sure that as our respective economies grow,<br />
many more opportuni. ties for trade wil. develop.<br />
We recognise that much of Australia's trading future rests<br />
with the Republic of Korea, with Japan and Chin a, with South<br />
East. Asia, and with the Pacific countries generally. We<br />
particularly welcome the beginning of your investment : iln<br />
partnersbip wilith Australian concernis in the development of<br />
Australian resources, and we hope that your participation<br />
will coiit'inue and grow.<br />
Our two countries are co-operating in other areas. We have<br />
initialled an agreement covering the Republic of Korea's<br />
fishing activities in the Australian 200 Nautical Mile<br />
Fishing Zone. We look forward to the conclusion of<br />
outstanding matters relating to that agrieement.<br />
During your visit a nuclear safeguards agreement between the<br />
Republic of Korea and Australia w: ill be signed. We<br />
recognise your need for nuclear power for peaceful purposes.<br />
Up till now, the Repub. lic of Korea has been about 60 percent<br />
dependent upon oil as an energy source. Is it any wonder<br />
that you seek to divcrsify more into coal and nuclear power?<br />
Our trading relationship has been greatly helped by frequent<br />
discussions between our Ministers, our officials, and our<br />
businessmen. The Australian/ Korea Business Cooperation<br />
Committee is doing much active work. Your country was the<br />
first with which we establi. shed regul ar Government to Goverament<br />
talks and your visi. t is a significant addition to those regular<br />
discussions. My colleague, The Min. ister for Trade and Resources,<br />
is planning to vLisit Seoul later this year.<br />
Your country and mine share a commitment to peace and stability<br />
in our region and in the world. e welcome developmnent that have<br />
contributed to that end, such as the normalisation of relations<br />
between China and the United States of America. We hope that<br />
ultimately through peaceful means, through consultation and<br />
negotiation, thie solutions will be found to the problems that<br />
are causing continued tension in the Korean Peninsula. / 3 </p>
<p>3-<br />
We a pprciate whiat your Govern iient is doin. g to find a peace fl<br />
and lbasting Soi ution to these problems.<br />
The last few years have seen increasing contacts between us<br />
in thm economi~ c and poliical spheres in sp) orts and cultural and<br />
acadlemic exchaniges and : in scientif[ ic cooperation. An<br />
essent~ ial part of buil ding internuational friendships : is personal.<br />
knowlecdge of each other amongst Government leaders and I<br />
warmly welcome your Government's invitation to visi t your<br />
counitry. I am looking forward to thie day when it will be possible<br />
to schedule that vi sit.<br />
I have heard much about the beauty of your country and the warmth<br />
and hospitality of your people. I warmly welcome you and<br />
your del. egation to Australia. 1 now propose a toast to<br />
the health of Prime Minister Chioi Kyu-lih.<br />
