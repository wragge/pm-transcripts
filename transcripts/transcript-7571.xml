PRIME MINISTER<br />
CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
PREMIER'S BUSINESS LUNCH<br />
ADELAIDE 17 APRIL 1989<br />
John Bannon,<br />
Neal Blewett,<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen.<br />
Back on 2 March 1983, in the final week of the life of the<br />
Fraser Government, the then-Treasurer John Howard issued one<br />
of his last press statements before the election.<br />
In the light of the achievements of last Wednesday's<br />
Economic Statement, it is worth recalling today the words of<br />
that near-final ministerial utterance of Mr Howard.<br />
Speaking of the Accord that had just been reached by the<br />
Labor Party and the Australian Council of Trade Unions,<br />
Mr Howard said that it was " abundantly clear" that Labor's<br />
prices and incomes policy was " in tatters".<br />
So he offered this analysis: " It ( the Accord) offers no<br />
hope for the unemployed. It does not form a viable basis<br />
for a realistic approach to wages".<br />
It is hard to imagine any commentary more flawed than that,<br />
or any prediction more erroneous.<br />
The truth is that, under the Accord, Australia has had an<br />
unparalleled period of wage restraint and unparalleled<br />
growth in employment.<br />
From 1983 to December 1988 real unit labour costs have<br />
declined by during the same period 1.3 million new<br />
jobs have been created a growth rate twice that of the<br />
OECD and four times the rate Mr Howard and his colleagues<br />
achieved when they were in office.<br />
The Economic Statement that Paul Keating delivered on<br />
Wednesday provided further proof that the Accord is<br />
delivering achievements of lasting value for all<br />
Australians.<br />
0' 394 </p>
<p>2.<br />
It delivered a package of responsible wage increases,<br />
affordable tax cuts and equitable new family payments a<br />
mix that will take Australia into the last decade of the<br />
century with a more prosperous economy and a more just<br />
society. This is the Accord that Mr Howard dismissed as offering no<br />
hope for the unemployed and no basis for a realistic wages<br />
policy. But I suppose we should at least acknowledge his consistency<br />
about the Accord.<br />
Throughout the last six years, as all the evidence<br />
accumulated to disprove the validity of his assessment, he<br />
continued with admirable consistency though little insight<br />
to dismiss and disparage the Accord.<br />
He does it still, Only last Thursday he castigated the<br />
Government for its so-called " ideological strait-jacket<br />
imposed by its roots in the Labor movement."<br />
Let me make it perfectly plain that I am proud of Labor's<br />
links with the trade union movement not for any<br />
ideological reason but because of what those links, as part<br />
of a broader consensus approach by the Government, have been<br />
able to achieve in the interests of all Australians.<br />
So let's put John Howard's rhetoric to one side and look at<br />
the facts.<br />
What is the evidence of the success of the Accord?<br />
First, as I have said, it has yielded sustained wage<br />
restraint which has been directly responsible for record<br />
employment growth.<br />
There are now about 1.3 million more Australians in<br />
employment than there were when the Accord was forged.<br />
I point out that around 90 per : cent of those 1.3 million<br />
jobs have been created by the private sector.<br />
The unemployment rate has fallen by four percentage points.<br />
industrial disputation has fallen by 59 per cent.<br />
And the private sector has lifted its investment to a<br />
year high relative to GDP.<br />
Second, the Accord has generated real improvements in our<br />
international competitiveness. Australia is now more<br />
competitive than it was in 1984-85 when measured on a<br />
consumer price index basis.<br />
At the same time, it curbed what would otherwise have been<br />
the inflationary consequences of import price increases<br />
caused by the 1985-86 decline in our overvalued dollar. 6395 </p>
<p>In other words, the Accord allowed Australia to adjust to<br />
the collapse in our terms of trade in 1985-86 without<br />
recession. I<br />
Third, the Accord has seen a dramatic improvement in the<br />
quality of social justice in Australia.<br />
we have seen even before Wednesday's Statementunprededented<br />
improvement in family assistance, targeted to<br />
those members of the community who need it most.<br />
We have seen even before Wednesday's Statement historic<br />
reforms of the taxation system: cuts in personal tax, the<br />
taxation of capital gains and the effective pursuit of tax<br />
avoidance and evasion.<br />
Fourth, the Accord has allowed the nation to address the<br />
issue which as no other holds the key to long-term<br />
sustainable prosperity: productivity.<br />
With our tripartite'reforms of outdated work practices, with<br />
our program of reform of the schooling and job skilling of<br />
our students and workers, and with the fundamental reforms<br />
being achieved in the restructuring of the nation's<br />
antiquated awards system, we are seeing lasting improvements<br />
in the nation's human capital our greatest resource, our<br />
people. Jobs; adjustment; social justice; productivity improvements:<br />
that's what the Accord has delivered and it is delivering<br />
still.<br />
To put these achievements~ another way, the Accord has<br />
provided the principal means of surviving the two great<br />
challenges to the nation's economic security that have<br />
arisen in the 1980s.<br />
in 1983 it pulled Australia out of the worst recession we<br />
had endured in 50 years. we turned around that unique<br />
legacy of the Fraser/ Howard years double digit<br />
unemployment combined with double digit inflation and we<br />
laid the basis for recovery and restored prosperity.<br />
In 1985/ 86, the Accord allowed us to weather the collapse in<br />
our terms of trade which stripped some $ 11 billion off our<br />
national income.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
Now, as Wednesday's Statement proved, the cooperation<br />
between the Government and the trade union movement has<br />
offered us the means to survive the third great challenge of<br />
the 1980s: the excessive economic buoyancy that has<br />
followed the stock market collapse of October 1987.<br />
6 3 J </p>
<p>in the face of virtually unanimous expert predictions to the<br />
contrary, Australia, and most of the industrialised world,<br />
have seen since that collapse the emergence of boom economic<br />
conditions. But in addition, and while we have flat consumption growth<br />
and flat public demand, we now have business investment at<br />
its highest level relative to GDP than at any time in the<br />
last 40 years.<br />
Housing starts are running at their highest levels since the<br />
early 1970s.<br />
Employment growth has been exceptionally strong.<br />
A brief history lesson demonstrates that these current<br />
conditions pose a real challenge to economic management in<br />
Australia. over the 1970s and 1980s we have had three periods of<br />
significant boom conditions.<br />
in 1973 overtime hours worked increased by 30% and a net<br />
balance of 27% of firms responding to the CAI/ Westpac Survey<br />
of Industrial Capacity were operating at above normal<br />
capacity utilisation. We then saw wages increase by 72% in<br />
the next 3 years, prices grew by 55% and unemployment<br />
increase from 2 to<br />
In the early 1980s, capacity utilisation again tightened and<br />
overtime hours worked increased by 22% in December 1981. In<br />
the two years to December 1982 wages increased by 27%,<br />
prices by 19% and the unemployment rate doubled in two years<br />
as the economy went into recession.<br />
Today, capacity utilisation and hours of overtime worked are<br />
running at the highest levels since 1973/ 74. Yet wages<br />
growth is running at around 7% and we have just reached an<br />
historical agreement with the ACTU to have 6 1/ 2% wages<br />
growth next year.<br />
in other words, where previous Governments failed to cope<br />
with growth, this time we will get it right.<br />
Continued moderate wages growth through this boom period<br />
will prevent the spurt in inflation, the devastation of<br />
company profits and the unemployment that, to the cost of<br />
all Australians, accompanied the previous booms.<br />
The increased incomes that will flow to Australian workers<br />
in 1989-90 as a result of the Economic Statement will come<br />
from tax cuts and family payments from the Government, paid<br />
for by past declines in the size of Government, and from<br />
moderate wage income delivered through award restructuring.<br />
They will not come as past wage increases have, as direct<br />
costs to employers, and therefore as costs to jobs and<br />
investment. </p>
<p>That is the result of the Accord which the Opposition Leader<br />
disparaged in 1983 as " not form( ing) a viable basis for a<br />
realistic approach to wages".<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
The truth of short-term macro-economic management, whether<br />
it be in Australia or elsewhere, is that there are three and<br />
only three policy arms available for Government use: wages<br />
policy, fiscal policy and monetary policy.<br />
Some have said there should be a different mix of policies.<br />
Let's look at the facts.<br />
Wages policy today, as I have illustrated, is as tight as<br />
possible. Wages growth of 6.5% in 1989-90 to accompany our<br />
investment surge is an unprecedented result.<br />
Last Wednesday night's tax cuts have effectively lowered the<br />
corporate wages bill.<br />
Anybody seriously entertaining the possibility of a lower<br />
wages outcome for 1989-90 is living in fairyland.<br />
Then there is fiscal policy.<br />
Our Budget surplus in 1987-88 was the first in 35 years.<br />
This year's surplus will be $ 5.5 billion. Next year's,<br />
after paying for the tax! cuts, will be at least as high.<br />
Real Commonwealth Government outlays will, after next year,<br />
have declined for four years in a row.<br />
The result of this restraint is that the entire Australian<br />
public sector will make no call on foreign savings this<br />
year, and no call next year.<br />
The Liberals' policy is also for a zero Public Sector<br />
Borrowing Requirement, though in some 30 years of post-war<br />
Coalition rule they never came close to it.<br />
When they left office in 1982-83, the Public Sector<br />
Borrowing Requirement was 5.9% of GDP. Now we have brought<br />
it down to zero.<br />
If today the Opposition wants to suggest a tighter fiscal<br />
policy, they have the responsibility to tell the community<br />
where they would make the necessary cuts.<br />
Mr Howard's policy, enunciated again in his reply to the<br />
Economic Statement on Thursday, is dishonest: he pretends<br />
cuts can be made without specifying where or how.<br />
Last Thursday he did not nominate areas for spending cuts.<br />
He simply asserted Government can do what it does now, more<br />
cheaply.<br />
639 </p>
<p>The truth is that further large cuts will cut services.<br />
This would either transfer the bill from Government to<br />
individuals, as would happen if health outlays were cut, or<br />
it would just mean fewer community services: fewer<br />
university places, less defence equipment or lower<br />
unemployment benefits.<br />
Let's not have policy discussions that assume that cuts can<br />
be made in Government outlays without cost.<br />
It would be easy if they could.<br />
But, I repeat, they cannot.<br />
By any measurement, we have the tightest fiscal policy in<br />
years. It is nonsense to suggest that our policy mix<br />
sees us lax in the fiscal area, or that billions of dollars<br />
in savings can be easily found.<br />
The real problem prompting the debate about policy mix is<br />
Australia's current high interest rates.<br />
Australia's monetary policy is tight as it plays its<br />
appropriate balancing role in the economy. The economy is<br />
growing too fast and needs to slow.<br />
Monetary policy has the quickest effect.<br />
But while fiscal and wages policy are at unprecedented<br />
levels of tightness, the same is not true of monetary<br />
policy. Today go day bill rates stand at around 17.5%: in<br />
April 1982 they hit 22%.<br />
Our current monetary stance will stay tight until the<br />
economy comes off the boil: it will not be released until<br />
then, but it will not be held a notch tighter than it needs<br />
to be.<br />
So reviewing these three arms of policy wages, fiscal and<br />
monetary the truth is that no policy mix other than the<br />
present would suffice to take Australia securely into the<br />
1990s. The Liberals have no wages policy.<br />
Their fiscal policy is at best a copy of ours.<br />
Their resultant monetary policy such as it can be<br />
determined from the contradictory statements that emerge<br />
from their three economic spokesmen Howard, Peacock and<br />
Hewson would in the current climate send rates through the<br />
roof.<br />
There is no comfort for Australian families there. 9 </p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
If there is one single characteristic of the Hawke<br />
Government that has been evident throughout our entire<br />
period in office it is our proven capacity simultaneously to<br />
achieve economic reform and social justice.<br />
And if there is a single characteristic that distinguishes<br />
Labor from the conservatives it is the complete incapacity<br />
of our opponents to grasp either of those fundamentals.<br />
Let me illustrate what I mean.<br />
The central task of this Government has been to achieve the<br />
reconstruction of the Australian economy to reduce our<br />
vulnerability to the fluctuations of world commodity markets<br />
by diversifying our export regime; to build on our strengths<br />
as a commodity producer by developing the capacity to<br />
produce and export manufactured and service goods.<br />
In the short-term, that has required the exercise of<br />
discipline. It has meant, for the public sector, real reductions in<br />
spending and, for the wage earner, real wage restraint.<br />
What has to be understood is that under Labor since 1983,<br />
these disciplines have been achieved in tandem with a new<br />
attention to social justice issues.<br />
The Accord Mark 1 balanced the requirement for real wage<br />
restraint with the provision of increases in the social<br />
wage; the exercise of real wage restraint by employed<br />
members of the workforce created the conditions whereby the<br />
unemployed found jobs in unprecedented numbers.<br />
The exercise of budgetary restraint has created the<br />
conditions for increased expenditure on social justice<br />
programs, especially those targeted to the less-well off.<br />
Indeed, we have achieved a massive reorientation in spending<br />
priorities of the Commonwealth.<br />
Spending on social justice programs as a proportion of the<br />
Commonwealth's total spending has risen from about 50 per<br />
cent to about 58 per cent since we came to office.<br />
It is in this context that the latest reforms have to be<br />
seen for what they are a coherent package, in which the<br />
essential momentum of economic reform is maintained, through<br />
the continued exercise of fiscal and wage restraint, while<br />
at the same time achieving major reforms for the less<br />
well-off.<br />
644 00 </p>
<p>Among those reforms are increases in Family Allowance of<br />
$ 9 per week for each of the first three children, and $ 12 a<br />
week for each subsequent child. A two child family will<br />
receive an additional non-taxable $ 5.25 a week, a 41%<br />
increase, from family assistance alone.<br />
The Government has met its commitment to eliminate the need<br />
for children to live in poverty. It has met the family<br />
assistance benchmarks six months ahead of the envisaged<br />
timetable. For the first time, we have indexed family allowances, the<br />
Dependent Spouse Rebate and other family-based payments.<br />
And we have brought forward by 12 weeks the time taken to<br />
index age pensions, and we have ensured that age pensioners<br />
who receive income within the pension income test free area<br />
pay no tax at all.<br />
Let me make this final point about the achievements of the<br />
Economic Statement.<br />
John Howard has claimed the benefits of this package will be<br />
eroded by inflation or higher interest rates.<br />
He is wrong.<br />
Since there will be no wages explosion,, there is no reason<br />
to expect increased inflation.<br />
There is also no reason why interest rates should increase<br />
as a result of this package.<br />
The tax cuts are already paid for by smaller Government.<br />
Commonwealth outlays as a percentage of GDP have fallen from<br />
31% in prospect for 1983-84 to 25.5% in 1988-89. The<br />
Government will be making no new borrowing this year to<br />
finance the cuts. The PSBR will be zero this year. And,<br />
even after paying for tax cuts which more than offset the<br />
loss accumulated through bracket creep, it will be zero next<br />
year. Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
I have concentrated today largely on domestic issues.<br />
But I would be doing a disservice if I cast this report<br />
purely in domestic terms, as significant as all these recent<br />
initiatives are.<br />
I want to close by turning your attention abroad.<br />
Because it is in the international economy that the success<br />
of Australia's domestic reforms will ultimately be tested.<br />
Behind everything we have done since our first day in office<br />
has been the need to create an economy not only more<br />
prosperous and more equitable in domestic terms but also<br />
more able to compete on world markets. ( 3 401 </p>
<p>For it is only through successfully taking on the world, and<br />
winning, that we will be able to secure our domestic<br />
prosperity. In particular, it is only by the greater enmeshment in Asia<br />
of a diversified, productive, efficient, competitive<br />
Australia that the prosperity of individual Australians will<br />
be. best protected and enhanced.<br />
It has been a truism of political debate in this country for<br />
many years at least since Britain's entry into the<br />
European Common Market that our future lies in Asia.<br />
But it is only since 1983 that we have taken the necessary<br />
steps to act on that truth to prepare ourselves to exploit<br />
the unique opportunities presented to us by our location<br />
within the world's most economically dynamic region, the<br />
Pacific Rim economies.<br />
That is why, since coming to office, we floated the dollar,<br />
deregulated the financial markets, liberalised foreign<br />
investment, achieved unprecedented cuts in tariffs,<br />
terminated the two airline agreement, deregulated crude oil<br />
marketing, allowed effective competition in the provision of<br />
telecommunications services, and lowered company tax rates.<br />
it is why, in May, we will address problems in coastal<br />
shipping and on the waterfront as part of a comprehensive<br />
range of announcements aimed at achieving further reform of<br />
our micro-economy.<br />
A principal focus of our diplomatic activity including the<br />
visits abroad that I make as Prime Minister is<br />
increasingly to protect and enhance our trading interests,<br />
especially through upholding the multilateral trading system<br />
GATT. In August 1986 Australia convened the Cairns Group of Fair<br />
Trading Nations in order to ensure that the current Uruguay<br />
Round of GATT negotiations effectively liberalises the rules<br />
governing world trade especially governing trade in<br />
agricultural commodities.<br />
we would all be the losers if GATT were to fail and if the<br />
principles of free trade were to be lost in a scramble for<br />
protectionism. After the Montreal Mid-term Review stalled last December, it<br />
seemed as if we were indeed facing, if not the end of GATT,<br />
then certainly the beginning of the end.<br />
It was a sobering prospect. Fortunately, thanks in very<br />
large part to the activities of the Cairns Group, a major<br />
breakthrough was reached recently.<br />
64O2 </p>
<p>On agriculture, the GATT parties have essentially accepted<br />
the thrust of the major Cairns Group proposals that I tabled<br />
in Geneva on behalf of the Cairns Group in 1987.<br />
The result of that agreement is that Australian farmers can<br />
look forward to improved returns. The prospects for<br />
Australian rural exports are infinitely brighter in a world<br />
where the likelihood of an agricultural subsidies war<br />
between the EEC and the US is removed, and where the unfair<br />
trade barriers restricting Australian exports to those<br />
economies and elsewhere are steadily removed.<br />
While we will need to monitor the implementation of the<br />
principles reached in this negotiation, I believe we can be<br />
optimistic for the future of efficient agricultural<br />
producers such as Australian farmers.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
The proof continues to accumulate.<br />
For six years the Federal opposition has neglected the real<br />
issues and fudged the questions that need answering.<br />
Luxuriating in the comfort of not having actually to do<br />
anything, they continue to offer suggestions that, if<br />
implemented, would devastate the Australian economy and<br />
Australian families.<br />
on the other hand, the Federal Labor Government, steadily<br />
and responsibly, is creating the conditions for sustained<br />
economic prosperity.<br />
Wednesday's Economic Statement presented a package of<br />
measures that fulfilled a key promise to the Australian<br />
people.<br />
We said that those who have suffered the heaviest burden of<br />
restructuring those families that have made the sacrifices<br />
will see real improvements in their disposable incomes<br />
this year.<br />
That relief is not extended as a give-away that will<br />
jeopardise future economic recovery.<br />
It is provided in a way that will preserve the gains we have<br />
already made and that will ensure, as we enter the next<br />
decade, that we will build on those gains and we will<br />
continue to create a more prosperous and a fairer Australia. 6 403; </p>
