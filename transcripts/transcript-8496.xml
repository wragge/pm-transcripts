PRIME MINISTER<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
LAUNCH OF THE AUSTRALIAN CHILDREN' S TV FOUNDATION " LIFT-OFF"<br />
PARLIAMENT HOUSE WEDNESDAY, 29 APRIL 1992<br />
1 am delighted to be asked to launch what is a marvellous<br />
venture in every regard.<br />
Lift-Off is the product of a great initiative: from the<br />
Australian Children's Television Foundation under the inspired<br />
leadership of Patricia Edgar..<br />
Patricia Edgar has made an unequaled contribution to<br />
children's television and children'q education in this country<br />
and I take this opportunity to congratulate and thank her.<br />
In all she has done, of course, she has also made a great<br />
contribution to Australia.<br />
There are many others I should mention.<br />
The late Robert Holmes a Court made a vital initial<br />
investment. Janet Holmes a Court has played a major role. So<br />
has Don Edgar odf the National Outreach Committee.<br />
Yet, in a sense, it would be wrong to stress the contribution<br />
of any individuals for the outstanding feature of this<br />
enterprise is its cooperative nature.<br />
The ABC, the Film Finance Corporation, Penguin Books, Octopus<br />
Publishing, Text Media; various education Ministries and other<br />
educational bodies; teachers from right across the curriculum<br />
and curricula des'. gners, experts in children's education and<br />
child psychology; writers, directors and technicians; actors,<br />
musicians, mimics, puppet-makers and puppeteers.<br />
There is an exLraordinary boldness and breadth to the<br />
conception, and plainly great skill in the execution.<br />
if the children who watch Lift-Off, and read the Lift-Off<br />
spin-offCs, develop the same skills of communication,<br />
cooperation and execution as producers have displayed, we will<br />
really be able to say that this country is pretty clever.<br />
Among other things, the project suggests to me what we are<br />
collecLively capable of I think, almost as much as the<br />
program itself, we are celebrating that today. </p>
<p>ILL 2<br />
Lift-off also suggests what television is capable of which<br />
is to say much more than we and our children are generally<br />
given. I think most of us feel that, despite some illustrious<br />
exceptions, television has never really lived up to its great<br />
promise as a medium of human growth and enlightenment.<br />
Our children, particularly, deserve much more than they are<br />
given in the way of intellectual stimulation.<br />
So, quite frankly, do we adults both as consumers of adult<br />
entertainment, and as parents.<br />
Parents in the contemporary environment need whatever help<br />
they can get with the task of parenting.'<br />
This is an extraordinarily complex, largely artificial,<br />
rapidly changing world.<br />
The information we anO our children are required to absorb is<br />
infinitely greater, more complex, and, In many senses, more<br />
elusive and ephemeral than it was a generation ago or half a<br />
generation 890.<br />
The need for new channels of learning, over and above parents<br />
and schools, seems to me to be greater than it has ever been<br />
before. The need to develop the capacities for learning and creativity<br />
and the ability to enjoy them has never been greater.<br />
Television is one obvious answer. But it has been for forty<br />
years. The truth is, television, which first presented itself as such<br />
a marvellous new learning medium, has always been an<br />
infuriating mixture of cause and cure.<br />
Lift-Off is most definitely in the Category of cure.<br />
I am also excited by it for this reason: it is a two way<br />
window on the world.<br />
it means that we will go to the world as well as having the<br />
world come to us.<br />
We are good at these sorts of things.<br />
Perhaps not enough Australians know it but we are good at<br />
education. We export it.<br />
We are good at making films and television; good at<br />
entertainment; good at the arts. We export all those things<br />
too. P 114 N 0 U U 0 UZ </p>
<p>3<br />
We are also good at looking after those who need looking<br />
after. Not perfect by a long shot, but better than most.<br />
No Australians are more deserving of our attention meaning<br />
the investment of money, energy and expertise than our<br />
children. That is why Lift-Off is a truly great Australian venture. I<br />
congratulate all those who have been associated with it, and<br />
on behalf of all Australians, wish themi all the success the<br />
project deserves.<br />
Thank you. </p>
