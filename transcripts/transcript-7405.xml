PRIME MINISTER<br />
CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
LAUNCH OF " YEAR OF CITIZENSHIP"<br />
SYDNEY 30 SEPTEMBER 1988<br />
Exactly four decades ago today, onl 30 September 1948, the<br />
Australian Parliament began to debate the Nationality and<br />
Citizenship Bill the legislation which established for the<br />
first time the principle of Australian citizenship.<br />
I am proud that it was a Minister in a Labor Government<br />
the great Chifley Labor Government who initiated that<br />
debate. Arthur Caiwell, the then Minister for Immigration<br />
delivered the second reading speech in Parliament on this<br />
day in 1948.<br />
But I do not refer to Calwell in any partisan sense.<br />
Because I believe we can all be proud of the decision taken<br />
on that occasion to debate and legislate for the then novel<br />
concept of Australian citizenship.<br />
In the wake of the sacrifices made by Australians in the<br />
Second World War, and at a time when Australia had taken the<br />
historic decision to welcome an unprecedented influx of<br />
immigrants to our nation, it was a visionary and deeply<br />
appropriate act to create Australian citizenship.<br />
Today, 40 years later, we mark this important anniversary,<br />
in three important and, again, deeply appropriate, ways.<br />
First, we welcome at this 1988 citizenship ceremony 88<br />
people who have decided to declare publicly their commitment<br />
to this country by taking out Australian citizenship.<br />
second, we celebrate the fact that, in the 40 years since<br />
Australian citizenship was created, two million people have<br />
chosen to become citizens. The two millionth person is<br />
expected to take out citizenship somewhere in Australia<br />
during these weeks.<br />
Third, I want to take this opportunity today to build upon<br />
the progress of the last 40 years by launching a new<br />
initiative in regard to Australia's citizenship: the Year<br />
of Citizenship.<br />
2 3 5 6 </p>
<p>Over the next twelve months of the Year of Citizenship, we<br />
will be seeking to raise the level of understanding in the<br />
community of the true meaning of Australian citizenship. In<br />
particular we will be encouraging those Australian residents<br />
who have not done so to take out Australian citizenship and<br />
to join us as fellow-citizens of this great nation.<br />
So at several levels this is truly an important day for all<br />
Australians. But let me address myself principally to these 88 people who<br />
are here to take up Australian citizenship.<br />
As a group, you represent a tremendous diversity of<br />
backgrounds and nationalities, of ages, occupations and<br />
cultures. You come in fact from some 40 different countries and for<br />
the record let me list them all: Bangladesh, Belgium,<br />
Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Czechoslovakia, Ecuador,<br />
Egypt, Fiji, France, Federal Republic of Germany, Greece,<br />
Hong Kong, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Italy,<br />
Israel, Ireland, Jordan, Korea, Lebanon, Malaysia, Malta,<br />
Mauritius, New zealand, Philippines, Portugal, Singapore,<br />
South Africa, Switzerland, Tonga, Turkey, United Kingdom,<br />
United States of America, Vanuatu, Vietnam and Yugoslavia.<br />
With a list like that, who needs an atlas! It is clear that<br />
you represent, in your diversity, the diversity of the whole<br />
world. But for all that diversity as a group you have as<br />
individuals all come to choose Australia as your new home<br />
and you have all arrived at the same decision today: you<br />
have all decided to take on the same rights and<br />
responsibilities as citizens of Australia.<br />
In doing so you remind us of the all-important truth of the<br />
Australian story: that we are and essentially remain a<br />
nation of immigrants.<br />
we are drawn from 130 nations as well as from the ancient<br />
culture of the Aboriginal and Islander people who cared for<br />
this land for more than 40,000 years.<br />
And in taking out citizenship today you also remind us of<br />
the counterpart to that historical fact: that Australians<br />
of all backgrounds have, through commitment and hard ffort,<br />
worked side by side to build a peaceful and prosperous<br />
nation. I do not seek to pretend that newcomers have in every case<br />
been instantly or easily welcomed in Australia. Prejudice<br />
and discrimination have, unfortunately, been features of<br />
Australia's history. 23 7 </p>
<p>But I do assert that what unites us all as Australians is Aith<br />
far greater than what may seem to divide us. have the<br />
We share a common land, a common loyalty and a common Quee<br />
aspiration to raise our children in peace and wellbeing. In<br />
other words we share a commitment to Australia. And sour<br />
It is that commitment, and that commitment alone, which mul t<br />
determines whether you are an Australian or not not your<br />
language, not your religion, not your style of dress or Beca<br />
country of origin, more soci<br />
As people have been proving for two centuries in this land, dist<br />
it is commitment to Australia that counts. Sm<br />
Today you are demonstrating that commitment in the most i mpl<br />
profound and important way by becoming Australian ithe<br />
citizens. But<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen, Au Srt<br />
our<br />
The decisions to migrate to Australia and to take up<br />
Australian citizenship are among the greatest decisions one And<br />
could take in a lifetime. race so w<br />
Forty years ago, the Nationality and Citizenship Act gave<br />
Australians a means of expressing their commitment to their IThe<br />
country and their pride in their identity as Australian must<br />
citizens. Ud<br />
The Act was passed by both Houses of Parliament and became assu<br />
law on Australia Day 1949. eros<br />
one of the provisions of the Act was to institute a solemn, Ladi<br />
impressive and memorable ceremony at which citizenship could<br />
be conferred. That is what we are here for today. In t<br />
crea<br />
Before the Act, Australian citizenship as a separate bein<br />
national identity had not existed. Some people did not<br />
believe it should come into existence. They believed the It i<br />
new Bill would impair Australia's allegiance to our British two<br />
motherland a view that is not to be dismissed as ignorant impo<br />
or frivolous but rather must be understood as very much a mill<br />
product of the time. Ac<br />
Britain is, of course, the-source of our system of as r<br />
parliamentary demnocracy, our legal system, many of our tbe fo<br />
traditions and our language. There will always be a special affi<br />

But Australians recognised in 1948 with the creation of will<br />
Australian citizenship, and they have recognised with<br />
increasing force ever since, that we have a new and more One<br />
independent role to play in the world. our strategic ties, the<br />
our trade relations, the composition of our people all cent<br />
have changed dramatically in the last forty years. woma rece<br />

Although the Oath or Affipmation of Allegiance which you<br />
have just taken required you to declare your allegiance to<br />
the Queen, it is not the Queen of the United Kingdom but the<br />
Queen of Australia, our own Head of State.<br />
And although the United Kingdom remains the single major<br />
source of immigrants to Australia, we are today a proudly<br />
multicultural nation.<br />
Because as a result of immigration Australia is a richer,<br />
more exciting, more diverse, more prosperous society, a<br />
society made up of people from many lands united into a<br />
distinctive Australian identity.<br />
Some participants in the so-called immigration debate today<br />
imply that we can turn back the clock in some way and undo<br />
the past 200 years.<br />
But we cannot repudiate the multicultural nature of<br />
Australian society because to do so would be to repudiate<br />
our very identity as Australians.<br />
And we must never again embrace discrimination on grounds of<br />
race as a principle of our immigration policy because to do<br />
so would be both morally repugnant and economically insane.<br />
The white Australia policy is dead and it is buried. It<br />
must have no place in Australia's future.<br />
Under this Prime minister and under this Government, I can<br />
assure you there will be no return to discrimination and no<br />
erosion of our commitment to multiculturalism.<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen<br />
In the four decades since Australian citizenship was<br />
created, some two million people have taken the decision<br />
being taken today.<br />
It is appropriate that we celebrate the attainment of the<br />
two million mark in some special way even though it is<br />
impossible to identify who precisely will be our two<br />
millionth citizen.<br />
Accordingly, two people in this group of 88 have been chosen<br />
as representatives of the two million people who have gone<br />
before you in swearing their oath or making their<br />
affirmation of allegiance to their new home, Australia.<br />
These two people symbolise all-those who have become<br />
Australians in the past and the thousands and millions who<br />
will follow them in the future.<br />
One of them is a young man born in Edinburgh typical of<br />
the millions who have * come to Australia over the last two<br />
centuries from the United Kingdom. The other is a young<br />
woman born in Saigon typical of those who have come more<br />
recently to find a new home in Australia. 2 359 </p>
<p>Nigel Stoker is 33. He arrived in Australia four years ago<br />
and is taking up citizenship today with his wife, who is<br />
French.<br />
Ngoc Anh Nguyen is 19. She arrived in Australia in 1982 as<br />
a 12 year old who spoke no English and who had spent five<br />
months in a refugee-camp.<br />
Together, these two young people represent our future: for<br />
it is the young people who have the responsibility of<br />
ensuring Australia remains the tolerant and prosperous<br />
society it is today.<br />
It is appropriate, too, that Ms Nguyen, as a woman, reminds<br />
us-that the Nationality and Citizenship Act for the first<br />
time gave women, whether married or single, an equal right<br />
with men to hold Australia citizenship.<br />
Just as we are proud to celebrate our two millionth citizen,<br />
we should be equally concerned that a very large number of<br />
Australian residents who are qualified to become citizens<br />
have not done so.<br />
Indeed it is estimated that there are one million people<br />
eligible to become citizens who live here as non-citizens.<br />
It is to encourage those people to follow your example, and<br />
to remind all Australians of the value and importance of<br />
citizenship that I have pleasure in launching the Year of<br />
Citizenship. over the next twelve months we will be making special<br />
efforts to encourage not require, but encourage as many<br />
eligible people as possTMle to take up citizenship.<br />
Substantial financial and administrative resources will be<br />
devoted to the campaign over the coming year.<br />
I want to see a lot of ceremonies such as this conducted<br />
throughout Australia. I will be participating in some of<br />
them myself and I trust other Members of Parliament, along<br />
with our local and state government counterparts, will also<br />
make a special effort to become involved.<br />
Those of us who are Australian citizens by birth rarely have<br />
occasion to make a public affirmation of our commitment to<br />
our country. We are never required, as new citizens are, to<br />
take the oath or affirmation of allegiance to declare our<br />
allegiance, and to promise to observe the laws of Australia<br />
and to fulfil the duties of an Australian citizen.<br />
Yet all of us have a duty to ensure that Australia remains a<br />
peaceful, prosperous, decent and just nation.<br />
We all share a responsibility to Australia and the<br />
declaration of these 88 people today reminds us of that<br />
duty.<br />

0 Because as Arthur Caiwell said 40 years ago, Australian<br />
citizenship symbolised not only our pride in Australia but<br />
also our willingness to offer a share in our future to the<br />
new Australian citizens among us.<br />
s These new citizens, he said:<br />
" will be able to say, as proudly as any of us, ' I am an<br />
r Australian'. Perhaps those words will mean even more to<br />
those who remember life in less fortunate lands than to<br />
us who enjoy the freedom of plenty, the sunshine and<br />
social equality, of this great democracy.<br />
s " This vast and virile country which we are privileged to<br />
hold, and for the development of which we are<br />
responsible, can be made as great and noble a land as<br />
we, with our collective brains, muscles, and devotion to<br />
high ideals, wish it to be."<br />
n, Ladies and Gentlemen,<br />
As the Prime Minister of Australia, I welcome you as my<br />
fellow citizens and I wish you well in all you do in the<br />
future. Many different paths have brought you here to this point in<br />
d your lives. From here let us work together as fellow<br />
Australians, combining our brains, our muscles and our<br />
idealism to building the great nation of Australia in<br />
prosperity, peace and freedom to make it into the future<br />
what it surely is today, simply the greatest nation on<br />
earth.<br />
