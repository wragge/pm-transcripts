    <content><![CDATA[<p>I know that all Australians will join me in congratulating the people and government of Papua New Guinea as they celebrate their 25th anniversary of independence.</p>
<p>Our two countries enjoy very close relations based on a lengthy shared history and mutual respect. As I said when I visited Papua New Guinea in 1999, there is a deep well of understanding and sympathy towards Papua New Guinea in Australia.</p>
<p>Australians are friends who recognise that Papua New Guinea is proud of its independence as a sovereign nation with distinctive national characteristics. We are proud to have had a role in fostering that nationhood and bringing about Papua New Guinea's independence 25 years ago, today.</p>
<p>Our partnership has steadily strengthened and matured through times of adversity as well as prosperity. Australia remains as committed as ever to an independent, prosperous and self-confident Papua New Guinea.</p>
<p>In honour of our close relationship and in celebration of Papua New Guinea's silver anniversary, the Australian government is proud to announce a gift to Papua New Guinea of a $3 million programme over the next four years to develop community-based sports and recreation activities. The Silver Jubilee Sports Programme will also include a number of short-term scholarships at the Australian Institute of Sport in Canberra, fostering the deep love of sport both our nations share.</p>
<p>I extend on behalf of all Australians our warmest and best wishes on this most important occasion in Papua New Guinea's history.</p>
<p>16 September 2000</p>
