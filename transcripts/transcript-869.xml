Sir Howord Beale's term expires in March, after a<br />
very notable period of so~ rvL'ce by him to Alustralia in the United<br />

re-appointed as a Minister, though he will of course for the<br />
time being continue to be a Menrber of the House, This was<br />
a most helpful proposal on his part, since I know that he is<br />
deeply attached to the work of the Immi. gration Department,<br />
a Department in which he has been markedly successful.<br />
Mr, Cramer, who has had a long and valuable term<br />
of office as a Minister, placed himself at my disposal, knowing<br />
that in current circumsances I might wish to bring some<br />
younger men in. His generous action is much appreciated by<br />
