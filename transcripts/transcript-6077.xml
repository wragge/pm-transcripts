FOR MEDIA 6 April 1983 36/ 83<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
JOINT STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER AND THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL<br />
The Commonwealth Government issued a writ in the High Court<br />
today seeking a permanent injunction against the Tasmanian<br />
Government, the Hydro-Electric Commission and the Premier<br />
of Tasmania restraining them from continuing the work<br />
connected with the building of the Gordon-below-Franklin<br />
dam. The basis of the Commonwealth's claim is that the State<br />
legislation authorising the Hydro-Electric Commission<br />
to build the dam is now invalid because it is inconsistent<br />
with a Commonwealth law ( the Regulations under the National<br />
Parks and Wildlife Act gazetted last week) which forbids the<br />
building of the dam and work connected with it.<br />
The Commonwealth also seeks an order that the Premier give a<br />
written direction to the Hydro-Electric Commission that it<br />
stop the work on the dam. This power is given to the Premier<br />
by the Hydro-Electric Commission Act of Tasmania.<br />
The Commonwealth's statement of claim points out that the Tasmanian<br />
Premier of the day, Mr Lowe, requested the Fraser Government<br />
to place the area comprising the Cradle Mountain Lake St. Clair<br />
National Park, the Franklin-below-Gordon Wild Rivers National Park<br />
and the Southwest National Park on the World Heritage List<br />
and that the Commonwealth did so in accordance with that State<br />
request.<br />
The site was placed on the World Heritage List by the Commonwealth<br />
at Tasmania's request:<br />
because it contained unique examples of Ice Age<br />
Aboriginal occupation of riverine areas;<br />
because it contains rare and imperilled trees, plant<br />
life and animal life; and<br />
because it is one of the rare world examples of a<br />
glaciated area of outstanding national beauty.<br />
We reject claims made by the Tasmanian and Queensland Premiers<br />
that the Commonwealth's action amounts to an unjustified interference<br />
with States rights. / 2 </p>
<p>This case raises legal and political issues not just of concern<br />
to Tasmania but of real national and international significance.<br />
The Commonwealth has a responsibility to the nation as a whole,<br />
and a clear international obligation, to protect from destruction<br />
this outstanding part of Australia's and the world's natural<br />
and cultural heritage.<br />
The Labor Government will always be sensitive to claims of<br />
States rights, and will always attempt to resolve problems<br />
by negotiation in the first instance.<br />
But to say that the dam issue is for Tasmania alone to resolve<br />
is as nonsensical as to claim that oil drilling on the<br />
Great Barrier Reef is a matter for Queensland alone.<br />
The Constitution does not, and never has, identified two<br />
mutually exclusive " boxes" of powers one labelled*" Commonwealth"<br />
and the other " State".<br />
The balance between Commonwealth and State legislative power<br />
has been changing and evolving ever since Federation as new<br />
situations unforeseen by the founding fathers for example,<br />
aviation and broadcasting have emerged.<br />
By virtue of the international significance of the Tasmanian<br />
wilderness and the treaty obligations the Commonwealth has<br />
entered into at Tasmania' s request, the Commonwealth has<br />
clear constitutional power to act in the way it has.<br />
We believe that the Commonwealth has the clear duty-to so<br />
act in the interests of all Australians and the world<br />
community.<br />
The commonwealth's legal team will be headed by the Solicitor-<br />
General, Sir Maurice Byers Mr. A. R. Castan Q. C. and<br />
Ms. Susan Kenny of the Victorian Bar, and Mr. Peter Underwood<br />
of the Tasmanian Bar.<br />
In the preparation of its case, the Commonwealth Goverrnent has<br />
also had the assistance of archaeologists, anthropologists and<br />
geologists of world standing who have verified the site's<br />
outstanding universal value.<br />
No clear timetable has yet been resolved for the hearing of this<br />
case by the High Court, but it is the Commonwealth's intention<br />
to have this matter ( and any other matter that may arise as a<br />
result of the further legislation the Government will seek to<br />
enact early in the May session) resolved as soon as possible<br />
and practicable.<br />
We hope that now that the matter is clearly headed for the<br />
High Court the Tasmanian Government will at least agree in<br />
the meantime to proceed no further with any work that could cause<br />
irreparable damage to the World Heritage listed area, and the<br />
Prime Minister has written t6 Mr Gray today seeking his<br />
co-operation in this respect.<br />

COMMONWEALTH Plaintiffs<br />
AND THE STATE OF TASMANIA First Defendant<br />
THE HONOURABLE ROBIN GRAY<br />
Second Defendant<br />
HYDRO-ELECTRIC COMMISSION Third Defendant<br />
STATEMENT OF CLAIM<br />
The second defendant is the Premier of the State of<br />
Tasmania and the Minister responsible for the administration<br />
of the Hydro-Electric Commission Act 1944 of that State and as<br />
such is empowered after consultation with the third defendant<br />
to give to it any written direction that he considers to be in<br />
the public interest with respect to the performance or exercise<br />
by it of its functions, duties or powers under the Hydro-<br />
Electric Commission Act 1944 or any other Act.<br />
2. The third defendant is a body corporate incorporated<br />
by and under the provisions of the Hydro-Electric Commission<br />
Act 1944 ( Tas.). / 2 </p>
<p>3. By that Act the third defendant is empowered within<br />
the State of Tasmania to construct any works, to operate, manage,<br />
control, and generally carry on and conduct any business<br />
whatsoever relating to, or connected with, the generation,<br />
reception, transmission, distribution, supply and sale of<br />
electrical energy and to carry out in relation thereto any<br />
purpose which it may deem desirable in the interests of that<br />
State including, with the authority of Parliament, the construction<br />
of any new power development.<br />
4. On 16 November 1972 the General Conference of the<br />
United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization<br />
( the Organization) adopted a multilateral Convention entitled<br />
" Convention for the Protection of the World Cultural and<br />
Natural Heritage" ( hereinafter called " the Convention").<br />
On 22 August 1974 Australia deposited its instrument<br />
of ratification of the Convention with the Secretary-General<br />
of the Organization and on 17 December 1975 the Convention<br />
entered into force pursuant to the provisions of Article 33<br />
thereof. As at 16 March 1983, seventy-two countries from all<br />
regions of the world had become parties to the Convention.<br />
6. On 22 September 1981 the then Premier of the State<br />
of Tasmania requested the Prime Minister to submit to the World<br />
Heritage Committee established under the Convention the<br />
nomination of an area described as the Western Tasmania<br />
Wilderness National Parks. The area referred to in the<br />
nomination comprised the Cradle Mountain Lake St Clair<br />
National Park; the Franklin Lower Gordon Wild Rivers National<br />
/ 3 </p>
<p>Park and the Southwest National Park each of which was a State<br />
reserve within the meaning of the National Parks and Wildlife<br />
Act 1970 ( Tas.).<br />
7. On 13 November 1981 the Australian Government<br />
submitted a nomination substantially in accordance with the<br />
request by the said Premier to the Secretariat of the World<br />
Heritage Committee in accordance with paragraph 1 of Article<br />
11 of the Convention.<br />
8. By submitting the said nomination to the World<br />
Heritage Committee the Commonwealth identified the said area<br />
( hereinafter called " the property") as property forming part<br />
of the cultural heritage and natural heritage for the purposes<br />
and within the meaning of the Convention.<br />
9. The property:<br />
contains natural features consisting of physical<br />
and biological formations, and groups of such<br />
formations, which are of outstanding universal<br />
value from theaesthetic and scientific points<br />
of view;<br />
contains geological and physiographical formations<br />
which constitute, and is itself an area which<br />
constitutes, the habitat of threatened species of<br />
animals and plants of outstanding universal value<br />
from the points of view of science and conservation;<br />
contains natural sites, and is itself a natural<br />
area, of outstanding universal value from the points<br />
of view of science, conservation and natural beauty;<br />
/ 4 </p>
<p>contains archaeilogical sites which are of outstanding<br />
universal value from the historical, aesthetic,<br />
ethnological and anthropological pointsof view.<br />
Under the Convention, Australia has the duty of<br />
ensuring the identification, protection, conservation and<br />
presentation of the property and its transmission to future<br />
generations, and the duty to do all it can to that end to<br />
the utmost of its own resources.<br />
11. By reason of the Convention, and in the circumstances<br />
hereinafter alleged, Australia is bound to take appropriate<br />
legal measures necessary for the protection and conservation<br />
of the property.<br />
12. By the Gordon River Hydro-Electric Power Development<br />
Act 1982 ( Tas.) which commenced on 12 July 1982 the third<br />
defendant was authorized to construct a new power development<br />
on land within the property.<br />
13. On 17 August 1982 in pursuance of section 16( 1) of the<br />
National Parks and Wildlife Act 1970 ( Tas.) the Lieutenant-<br />
Governor declared inter alia that the areas of Crown land therein<br />
specified which included parts of the property ceased to form<br />
part of the State reserve known as the Franklin Lower Gordon<br />
Wild Rivers National Park. In relation to two areas forming<br />
part of the property the proclamation took effect on 3 September<br />
1982 and as to a third area forming part of the property, the<br />
proclamation will take effect on 1 July 1990. </p>
<p>14. Pursuant to section 35 of the Hydro-Electric<br />
Commission Act 1944 ( Tas.) and a proclamation dated 7 September<br />
1982, the ownership of the first two areas referred to in<br />
paragraph 13 above vested in the third defendant on 16<br />
September 1982 and the ownership of the third area referred to in<br />
that paragraph will vest in the third defendant upon the said<br />
proclamation taking effect on 2 July 1990.<br />
The third area referred to in paragraph 13 above contains<br />
a number of the archaedological sites on the property which are of<br />
outstanding universal value from the historical, aesthetic,<br />
ethnological and anthropological points of view.<br />
16. The World Heritage Committee at its meeting in Paris<br />
between 13 December 1982 and 17 December 1982 included the<br />
property in the World Heritage List pursuant to the provisions<br />
of the Convention and in relation to that inclusion made the<br />
following statement: " The Committee is seriously concerned at the<br />
likely effect of dam construction in the area on those<br />
natural and cultural characteristics which make the<br />
property of outstanding universal value.<br />
In particular it considers that flooding of parts<br />
of the river valleys would destroy a number of<br />
cultural and natural features of great significance<br />
as identified in the ICOMOS and IUCN Reports.<br />
The Committee therefore recommends that the<br />
Australian Authorities take all possible measures to<br />
protect the integrity of the property. 1 </p>
<p>6.<br />
The Committee suggests that the Australian<br />
authorities should ask the Committee to place the<br />
property on the List of World Heritage in Danger<br />
until the question of dam construction is resolved."<br />
17. The defendants have commenced to construct and intend<br />
to continue to construct, and to procure the construction, upon<br />
the first two areas referred to in paragraph 13 above, the<br />
Gordon River Power Development, Stage 2, which will consist of<br />
a dam, a coffer dam and associated works.<br />
18. In particular, the third defendant has, in the<br />
course of the said construction, done or procured the<br />
following acts: excavation works;<br />
the erection of buildings and other substantial<br />
structures; the killing, cutting down, damaging and/ or<br />
removal of trees; and<br />
the construction and establishment of roads and<br />
vehicular tracks.<br />
19. The works that have been carried out, and are<br />
proposed to be carried out, have already caused irreparable<br />
damage to the property and will cause further irreparable<br />
damage to the property. The erection of a coffer dam will cause<br />
the flooding and destruction of archaeological sites including<br />
those which are located in the third area referred to in<br />
paragraph 13 above which are of outstanding universal value<br />
from the historical, aesthetic, ethnological and anthropological<br />
points of view. The erection of the coffer dam and the<br />
principal dam will each result in the permanent flooding of a<br />
/ 7 </p>
<p>substantial portion of the whole of the property thereby<br />
destroying many of the features set forth in paragraph 9<br />
above. On 30 March 1983 the Governor-General of the<br />
Commonwealth, acting with the advice of the Federal Executive<br />
Council, made the regulations set out in the Schedule hereto<br />
pursuant to section 69 of the National Parks and Wildlife<br />
Conservation Act 1975 ( Cth.).<br />
21. The defendants threaten and intend to continue to<br />
do acts referred to in paragraphs 17 and 18 above in contravention<br />
of regulation 5 of the said Regulations.<br />
22. This action is within the original jurisdiction<br />
of the High Court because the Commonwealth is a party and<br />
also because it is a matter arising under, or involving the<br />
interpretation of the Constitution.<br />
AND THE PLAINTIFFS CLAIM:<br />
an injunction restraining the defendants from<br />
causing or permitting the carrying out of the<br />
works referred to in paragraphs 17 and 18 above;<br />
a mandatory injunction requiring the second<br />
defendant to take all steps necessary to give<br />
a written direction to the third defendant<br />
pursuant to section 15B of the Hydro-Electric<br />
Commission Act 1944 ( Tas.) to refrain from<br />
continuing the said works; </p>
<p>8.<br />
a declaration that, in so far as the Hydro-<br />
Electric Commission Act 1944 ( Tas.) and the Gordon<br />
River Hydro-Electric Power Development Act 1982<br />
( Tas.) purport to authorise the third defendant to<br />
carry out the said works, they are inconsistent<br />
with the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation<br />
Act 1975 ( Cth.) and the Regulations made thereunder,<br />
and are invalid.<br />
such further or other relief as the Court may deem<br />
meet. A. R. Castan<br />

-6 APR 1983<br />
My dear Premier<br />
I refer to the actions shortly to be taken by both our<br />
Governments to have legal issues relating to the<br />
Gordon-below-Franklin Dam referred to the High Court<br />
of Australia.<br />
The Commonwealth will be seeking to expedite the<br />
resolution of all the legal issues, but having regard<br />
to the matters involved and to what is proposed it<br />
could be some time before the final outcome is known.<br />
The Commonwealth would prefer these issues to be<br />
resolved without any unnecessary confrontation, while<br />
preserving the rights and interests of both Governments<br />
in the meantime. Of course you will appreciate that<br />
unless and until the matter is resolved otherwise by<br />
processes now under way, the law as it stands is being<br />
breached by your proceeding with the construction of<br />
the damn project.<br />
In all the circumstances, I seek your assurance that,<br />
pending the final outcome of legal proceedings,<br />
construction on the Darn site and associated works will<br />
be suspended in order to ensure that irreparable damage<br />
will not be caused to any-area placed on the World<br />
Heritage List.<br />
May I make clear my Government's willingness to assist<br />
those directly affected by the suspension of work on<br />
the project by the transfer of employment from the<br />
various contentious work sites to other appropriate<br />
projects identified in consultation with your<br />
Government. I would be grateful fdr your early response.<br />
Yours sincerely<br />
R. J. L. Hawke<br />
