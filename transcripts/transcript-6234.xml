<p>Air QueenslandI flights from Brisbane to the towns of Alpha,Â Barcaldine and Longreach in the west of theÂ State willÂ receive a subsidy from the Federal and Queensland Governments.</p>
<p>Agreement in principle had been reached by the twoÂ governments for payment of a subsidy from 1 September toÂ 31 December 1983.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth has made available an~ amount of $ 50,000 toÂ be provided on the basis of a matching dollar-for-dollarÂ contribution by the Queensland Government.</p>
<p>The subsidy would offset the losses being incurred byÂ Air Queensland in providing services to the three locations.Â Specific subsidy payments will be decided followingÂ discussions between Federal and State officials in<br />consultation with the airline, having regard for theÂ level of losses being experienced.</p>
<p>Agreement has also been reached for a review of subsidyÂ arrangements to be undertaken later this year.</p>
<p>This review will aim to identify longer-term arrangementsÂ for meeting the air transport needs of western QueenslandÂ communities.</p>
