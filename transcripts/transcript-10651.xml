    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE........................................</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, good morning.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good morning Alan. How are you?</p>
<p> JONES:</p>
<p>Good thank you. Congratulations. How important, could you just tell</p>
<p>   our listeners, is it that national Governments fight this battle</p>
<p>   against debt?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Enormously important. It's the foundation of a secure, confident</p>
<p>   future. The feeling that we are now, for the first time in eight</p>
<p>   or ten years spending less than we collect each week, if I can put</p>
<p>   it that way, but knowing that the surplus you get through spending</p>
<p>   less than you collect has to be used to pay previously accumulated</p>
<p>   debt, I mean, that is the situation we are in. We inherited a deficit,</p>
<p>   that's an annual gap between what we spend and what we collect,</p>
<p>   of $10.5 billion two years ago. We have now wiped that out.</p>
<p> JONES:</p>
<p>And $13 billion turn around in two years. It's a phenomenal</p>
<p>   achievement.</p>
<p> JONES:</p>
<p>And no raising of taxes?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>And no raising of taxes for the third year in a row. The Treasurer</p>
<p>   was able to say last night, no increase in wholesale sales tax,</p>
<p>   excise, income tax or other taxes, and what we have been able to</p>
<p>   do now with the surplus is also begin the mammoth task of repaying</p>
<p>   the accumulation of all of the annual deficits over previous years</p>
<p>   and they were in the order of $95 to $100 billion when we came to</p>
<p>   power so it really has been a phenomenal turn around and it has</p>
<p>   all been done without raising taxes and the beauty of it for the</p>
<p>   future is that we are now able to lock in lower interest rates.</p>
<p>   I mean, every homebuyer in Australia on an average loan is now $3800</p>
<p>   a year better off. That's the equivalent of a $100 a week tax</p>
<p>   rise from the boss for the average wage and salary earner.</p>
<p> JONES:</p>
<p>It doesn't get taxed, does it? It doesn't get taxed. It's</p>
<p>   a far better benefit than a wage increase.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>A far better benefit. There is a huge benefit when you have a lower</p>
<p>   mortgage bill and the greatest immediate and consistent and future</p>
<p>   dividend out of this Government's economic prudence has been</p>
<p>   that cut in interest rates for homebuyers because we now have the</p>
<p>   lowest interest rates for 30 years, the lowest inflation for 30</p>
<p>   years. We have generated 280 000 new jobs in just over two years</p>
<p>   since we have been in office, and despite all the turmoil in Asia</p>
<p>   we are able to see our economy growing by at least 3 per cent next</p>
<p>   year.</p>
<p> JONES:</p>
<p>More Australians working than ever before. </p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Could I just say one other thing about the region? Just ask yourselves,</p>
<p>   listeners, where this country would now be in the face of what has</p>
<p>   happened in Asia if my Government had not taken the measures it</p>
<p>   has over the last two years, if we had not resolved two years ago</p>
<p>   to take the spending decisions to get the books back into balance,</p>
<p>   to get the country back in the black and to say bye bye to the bankcard?</p>
<p> JONES:</p>
<p>Well I am happy to tell you on behalf of millions of Australians</p>
<p>   that I believe we would have been in all sorts of bother and I think</p>
<p>   any detailed debate on the Budget today only dilutes the very, very</p>
<p>   significant benefit to all Australians by this attack on debt. I</p>
<p>   just want to put this to you before we get off this debt question.</p>
<p>   In five years in the Â90s we increased our debt by $80 000</p>
<p>   million. It's almost criminal.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes that's right, we did, year after year, because we ran deficits</p>
<p>   of 7,8,9,10, whatever it was, billion dollars. We just added them</p>
<p>   up and by the time we got to office in 1996 and in that period in</p>
<p>   the 90s we had run up that massive amount of debt. Now what we have</p>
<p>   had to do is first of all, we have had to close the annual gap between</p>
<p>   what you spend and what you collect and we achieved that last night</p>
<p>   and then you set about using the surplus you generate to repay the</p>
<p>   debt of earlier years. Now what I want to be able to say to the</p>
<p>   future generations of Australians is that our aim is to enter the</p>
<p>   third millennium of the next century as free of debt as any Government</p>
<p>   has ever made Australia and I think it is a remarkable achievement</p>
<p>   that we are now, with confidence, able to say to the Australian</p>
<p>   people, when we turn the page of the calendar into the next millennium</p>
<p>   we will be as free of debt as we have been in the living memory</p>
<p>   of most Australians.</p>
<p>We now have the strongest economic foundations this country has</p>
<p>   had for a quarter of a century and it's needed at the present</p>
<p>   time with the turmoil in our region. Who would have thought a few</p>
<p>   years ago that we could boast of being the fastest growing economy,</p>
<p>   or one of the fastest growing economies in Asia. Remember just a</p>
<p>   couple of years ago people were looking almost in awe at the rates</p>
<p>   of growth in the Asian Pacific region. Now we are able to..</p>
<p> JONES:</p>
<p>Funded by debt, funded by debt.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>That's right. Exactly. Now we are able to look everybody in</p>
<p>   the eye and say, we've got our house in order. The fundamentals</p>
<p>   are strong. We have done it without increasing tax and most importantly,</p>
<p>   we are locking in in a way that they have never been locked in before,</p>
<p>   low interest rates and low inflation rates.</p>
<p> JONES:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, one writer said earlier this week of you, and I</p>
<p>   quote, "he's hampered by a rather Methodist modesty, rare</p>
<p>   in politicians as well as a dislike of braggadocio. As a result,</p>
<p>   sometimes major announcements and indications about the government's</p>
<p>   thinking go under reported". He went on, "neither John</p>
<p>   Howard nor his senior Ministers have developed the art of selling</p>
<p>   their successes". I wonder has the success that we all experience</p>
<p>   as a result of mortgage interest rates being the lowest since 1970;</p>
<p>   small business the lowest since 1960, down from 20 percent in 1990.</p>
<p>   Have you really sold to Australians the real benefit of that rather</p>
<p>   than have them believe that Government's have got to be giving</p>
<p>   money all the time?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I suppose I'll find that out whenever the next election</p>
<p>   is held though and I read that article with interest. That may or</p>
<p>   may not be an accurate description of me. I'm not a person</p>
<p>   who likes to over exaggerate things, I like to tell it as it is,</p>
<p>   I'm telling you as it is now when I say to you and your listeners</p>
<p>   this economy is in better shape then its been for a quarter of a</p>
<p>   century and I am really fantastically proud of what my Government</p>
<p>   has been able to achieve. Now we don't take the public for</p>
<p>   granted, they're entitled to say well that's your job,</p>
<p>   we elected you to fix the show up, that's why we got rid of</p>
<p>   the other crowd. Now you've got the books back into balance</p>
<p>   we want to see some decent tax reform, we want to see you continue</p>
<p>   with your efforts and let me say to your listeners we will, to reform</p>
<p>   the Australian waterfront. We are absolutely unapologetic about</p>
<p>   the fact that we want to reform the Australian waterfront. We've</p>
<p>   never made any bones about it and I don't want anybody in the</p>
<p>   community to imagine that we are in the least bit changing our attitude.</p>
<p>   We need an efficient Australian waterfront, we need to end compulsory</p>
<p>   unionism on the Australian waterfront and the reason we need those</p>
<p>   things is that it will benefit the whole country. We're not</p>
<p>   trying to destroy a union, I've got no argument with trade</p>
<p>   unionism, we have never set out to destroy the Maritime Union or</p>
<p>   any union. What we've set out to do is to give Australia a</p>
<p>   break through a more reformed and a more efficient waterfront.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Many people listening to you as well have long been concerned about</p>
<p>   the fact that they work their butts off everyday and other people</p>
<p>   can actually put their hand out at the welfare trough and get away</p>
<p>   with it. I know there was a report in the Budget last night that</p>
<p>   you've been cancelling social payments at the rate of about</p>
<p>   $28 million a week. It's a figure that's almost impossible</p>
<p>   for the average worker to comprehend.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It's about $600 million saved over a period of 18 months. And</p>
<p>   this is taking money back from people who are never entitled to</p>
<p>   it. And let me make it clear also that we estimate that we'll</p>
<p>   be collecting an additional $200 million over the next two years</p>
<p>   from some very wealthy people in Australia who haven't been</p>
<p>   paying their fair share over the past few years and we've made</p>
<p>   no apology.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Do multi-nationals pay their fair share of tax?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I believe multi-nationals pay according to the law, but if they're</p>
<p>   not we'll make sure they do.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>But should the law be changed to make sure that they pay tax at.....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, one of the things that we are going to examine, Alan, in</p>
<p>   the course of taxation reform is the operation of the law in all</p>
<p>   areas of taxation to ensure that people who are now exploiting the</p>
<p>   existing law can no longer do so. So I want to say to you and to</p>
<p>   other people who are concerned about that, that we are in the business</p>
<p>   of making sure that everybody pays their fair share. If that happened</p>
<p>   we'd all pay less.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>The Gold Card you announced last night was extended to world war</p>
<p>   II veterans and they become eligible at 70 years of age for free</p>
<p>   treatment, choice of doctor, optical, dental, physio, no Medicare</p>
<p>   levy and so on. Korean veterans and Vietnam veterans fought in the</p>
<p>   theatre of war as well, some of them many never get to 70 because</p>
<p>   they fought wars based on chemical weaponry. Why have they been</p>
<p>   excluded?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, they haven't been excluded, they haven't, let me</p>
<p>   put it this way, what we've done with world War II veterans</p>
<p>   is what we did with World War I veterans and that is about 55 years</p>
<p>   after the end of the war in which they served we decided to extend</p>
<p>   this benefit. Now obviously we'll be looking in future at the</p>
<p>   position of Korean and Vietnam veterans.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Some of these blokes with agent orange may never get to 70.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, Alan, as it happened many of the diggers of World War I because</p>
<p>   of the effects of gas and shell shock and diggers from World War</p>
<p>   II because of the enormous strain they suffered didn't live</p>
<p>   terribly long after they returned either. Now we've been very</p>
<p>   very compassionate and sympathetic with veterans and we'll</p>
<p>   obviously keep their position very much in mind.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Okay. Self funded retirees?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Very good Budget for them. A quarter of a million self funded retirees,</p>
<p>   additional self funded retirees, will now get the Commonwealth Health</p>
<p>   Card which gives you the same benefits and access to pharmaceuticals</p>
<p>   as pensioners get and the income limits are very generous. For an</p>
<p>   individual $40,000 a year...</p>
<p> JONES:</p>
<p>That's up from $21,000?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Up from $21,000, and for couples $67,000 a year....</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Right so.....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>So all the self funded retirees listening who are under those limits</p>
<p>   will be entitled.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>So they don't pay $3.20 for their pharmaceuticals.......</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>That's right from the 1st of January.</p>
<p> JONES:</p>
<p>But after 52 they'll get the rest free of charge.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Exactly and that's the same benefit as applies to pensioners</p>
<p>   and there are a lot of people in that category who said to me over</p>
<p>   the years that we've worked hard all our lives, we been thrifty</p>
<p>   enough to accumulate enough to look after ourselves and yet we get</p>
<p>   blocked and we are denied access to many of the benefits that are</p>
<p>   available to others. Now we have found it possible in this Budget</p>
<p>   to respond to that, I think quite legitimate concern, you're</p>
<p>   talking here about a generation of people who were thrifty....</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>.....who believe in the value of saving....</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Absolutely, that's what everyone says.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>....and feel rather resentful that because they are not a burden</p>
<p>   on the tax payer.....</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Yes, plus low interest rates knock them around</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Low interest rates does them a disservice I understand that and</p>
<p>   one of the dilemma's of low interest rates is great if you</p>
<p>   are a borrower.....</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Yeah, that's it.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>.....it's not so flash if you're a lender. And that's</p>
<p>   why we have been very careful, not only to give them a tax break</p>
<p>   in relation to the same rebate as is available to pensioners but</p>
<p>   also to give this very significant concession in relation to the</p>
<p>   Seniors Health card.</p>
<p> JONES:</p>
<p>If an employer, a businessman, an entrepreneur in Perth or Adelaide</p>
<p>   or Melbourne or Sydney today was opening a brand new business and</p>
<p>   employing 450 people, you would be there, Kim Beazley would be there.</p>
<p>   It would be a great triumph because it would be a tremendous fillip</p>
<p>   for the community. But every time a hotel opens, that's exactly</p>
<p>   what's happening. There are jobs for 450, up to 1000 people.</p>
<p>   We have only got 1 percent of world tourism. Are we doing enough</p>
<p>   to really sell Australia, forget Asia where we've got a problem</p>
<p>   at the moment, to the rest of the world in a tourist sense?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think we are. We are putting a lot more money into tourist promotion</p>
<p>   this year including domestic tourist promotion. One of the interesting</p>
<p>   things, Alan, about the tourist figures is that although there has</p>
<p>   been a significant fall from some of the Asian countries, and that</p>
<p>   was inevitable, there has been a quite significant increase in the</p>
<p>   number of tourists coming from North America and Europe. Now I am</p>
<p>   not saying it's enough to balance out the fall from Asia but</p>
<p>   Australia is not just seen by Asians as being an attractive tourist</p>
<p>   destination. Increasingly large numbers of Americans and Europeans</p>
<p>   are seeing in Australia the attraction that a generation ago Australians</p>
<p>   automatically saw in travelling to Europe.</p>
<p> JONES:</p>
<p>We've only got one percent of world tourism. For God's</p>
<p>   sake, if we can double that, wouldn't we be looking...</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well we would and one of the reasons we want a reformed the industrial</p>
<p>   relations system is to give to small business operators in the tourist</p>
<p>   industry a greater amount of flexibility and I mean, all of the</p>
<p>   reforms that we are making in that area which make it easier to</p>
<p>   employ people and encourage people to make bargains at a workplace</p>
<p>   level, all of that will aid and assist the tourist industry in this</p>
<p>   country.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>It wouldn't be an interview with the Prime Minister if I didn't</p>
<p>   raise yet again the health care question. I am astounded, I noticed</p>
<p>   that you fully indexed the payments to the GPs but the rationale</p>
<p>   is that you are wanting more GPs to more bulk bill. I thought bulk</p>
<p>   billing was the problem of the health care system.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No I don't think it's the problem. I think one of the</p>
<p>   biggest problems of the health care system...</p>
<p> JONES:</p>
<p>  What, people going in 50 times a day to see a doctor and getting...</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well Alan, abuse is always a problem and I don't think the</p>
<p>   level of remuneration is now such that the abuse that people quite</p>
<p>   properly...</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>I'm not blaming the doctor...</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No no, but that is an element but it's a mistake, and I say</p>
<p>   this Alan, and it wouldn't be an interview if you ask me, that's</p>
<p>   fair enough, but it's a mistake to see the problem with the</p>
<p>   Australian health system as being a problem of just over expenditure.</p>
<p>   In fact, the aggregate expenditure on health in Australia, both</p>
<p>   public and private, compares quite favourably with a lot of other</p>
<p>   countries. It's really the balance between public and private.</p>
<p> JONES:</p>
<p>But we don't have a policy for good health. We've only</p>
<p>   got a policy for bad health.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, no I don't agree with that. The health care in this country</p>
<p>   is very good. Our doctors are splendid, our nurses are very good.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Look, I could eat a lot of pies and drink a lot of grog and go</p>
<p>   on the turps and I get sick. Someone will look after me for nothing.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I think everybody has a self-interest in not doing all of those</p>
<p>   things. Certainly, not to an extent. We all do it occasionally in</p>
<p>   moderation, don't we.</p>
<p> JONES:</p>
<p>I'm pleased to hear you are not completely methodist.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Not totally!</p>
<p> JONES:</p>
<p>Just one final thing, and we've only got a minute to go. Why</p>
<p>   has the Treasurer not undertaken, in terms of tax reform, any large</p>
<p>   scale study of the debits tax. My understanding is that he has advised</p>
<p>   the tax taskforce not to consider any proposals right into that.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Earlier governments have looked at that including the Government</p>
<p>   into which I was Treasurer and Alan, it won't work. It was</p>
<p>   temporarily tried in, I think Sri Lanka, about thirty years ago.</p>
<p> JONES:</p>
<p>When we talk about the Reserve Bank maintaining currency stability,</p>
<p>   can you give our listeners any indication at what point would the</p>
<p>   dollar go so low which would require intervention?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>As a golden rule, Treasurers, Prime Ministers and other people of</p>
<p>   responsibility...</p>
<p> JONES:</p>
<p>Don't comment on the currency.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>They never comment on the currency. My stock answer when I was Treasurer</p>
<p>   was, whatever the level was at the time the question was asked was</p>
<p>   right.</p>
<p> JONES:</p>
<p>Well done. Thank you for your time and congratulations, a very significant</p>
<p>   achievement in terms of attacking debt I am sure is welcomed by</p>
<p>   all Australians.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Thank you Alan.</p>
