    <content><![CDATA[<p>Australia will focus on regional security and prosperity at the Pacific Islands Forum</p>
<p>The Pacific Islands Forum Leaders’ Meeting (PIF) brings together Pacific Leaders of the region where Australia has core interests.</p>
<p>From 9-10 September I will be in Pohnpei, Federated States of Micronesia participating in PIF to demonstrate Australia’s intention to step up engagement in the region and address the many challenges facing the Pacific.</p>
<p>What we decide in Pohnpei will have direct implications for Australia’s economy and security.</p>
<p>I will be seeking to boost the role of PIF in our region and reaffirm Australia’s commitment as the region’s major security and strategic partner.</p>
<p>PIF’s focus remains strong on practical cooperation on regional security issues, and increasing economic integration through expanded trade and investment. I will be announcing a substantial package of assistance to Pacific Island countries to address the impacts of climate change and improve disaster risk reduction.</p>
<p>I will also emphasise our continued and long-standing support for regional security cooperation. Australia is taking practical measures to assist Pacific Island countries maintain their own maritime security.</p>
<p>Our Pacific Maritime Security Program is the centrepiece of Australia's defence engagement in the South Pacific. Under this program, Australia will gift up to 21 patrol boats to Pacific Island countries. We are also working with the region to promote air surveillance to monitor illegal maritime activities.</p>
<p>Australia’s participation in PIF is important to secure our core interests and ensure stability and prosperity in the region.</p>
