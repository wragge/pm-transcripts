PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH PAUL LYNEHAM, 7.30 REPORT,<br />
AUGUST 1990<br />
E OE PROOF ONLY<br />
LYNEHAM: Prime Minister thanks for joining us.<br />
PM: It's a pleasure Paul.<br />
LYNEHAM: Are we now unofficially at war with Iraq?<br />
PM: No. We're not at war with Iraq. The primary purpose<br />
of Australia's participation in this multinational naval<br />
force will be to assist in the enforcement of the<br />
blockade on Iraq and Kuwait.<br />
LYNEHAM: But we could find ourselves shooting at them<br />
couldn't we?<br />
PM: Well the enforcement that we're talking about<br />
hopefully doesn't lead to that. But I want to make it<br />
quite clear that if there was any suggestion that there<br />
was a desire on the part of the United States to escalate<br />
the involvement of the Australian naval asset beyond<br />
enforcement to some actual aggressive involvement beyond<br />
that function then it's understood that there'd be<br />
further discussion about that.<br />
LYNEHAM: And we're there until the Iraqis pull out of<br />
Kuwait? PM: Once this Government makes a decision to be part of<br />
a process we're there to see it through.<br />
LYNEHAM: He's got at least six months worth of grain,<br />
much of it bought from us on credit, he can hold out for<br />
a while can't he, in terms of basic feeding his people?<br />
PM: Well you have also got to understand that the Iraqi<br />
economy depends to an enormous extent upon its export<br />
income and that is already being very seriously affected,<br />
there are no tankers now loading up at the end of the<br />
pipelines across Turkey and across Saudi Arabia. So I<br />
think you' re not looking at that sort of period of time,<br />
but the important thing Paul is that we've made the<br />
decision. It's a serious decision, well thought through,<br />
taking everything into account. Now you don't make a<br />
decision like that and say oh well we'll be here for a<br />
couple of days and see you later. </p>
<p>LYNEHAM: And ultimately the forces will be under the<br />
command of Australia as a sovereign nation, but perhaps<br />
American control?<br />
PM: Yes, the Royal Australian Naval Ships will be under<br />
Royal Australian Naval command, but operationally and<br />
this is the language of forces, operationally they may be<br />
under the control of the United States. Hopefully, and I<br />
say this from the point of view of the United States as<br />
well as Australia, it may be that at some stage it may<br />
emerge as a United Nations flag operation, but it's not<br />
regarded as appropriate to wait until that may emerge.<br />
LYNEHAM: Do you think the UN flag will be flying over<br />
this force eventually?<br />
PM: I can't make that assertion, I certainly express the<br />
hope and from the long conversation I had with George<br />
Bush on the phone this morning he would like to see that<br />
I know.<br />
LYNEHAM: Prime Minister how does it feel personally to<br />
be a key figure in a decision that could, quite<br />
realistically, see Australians killed and maimed?<br />
PM: You don't arrive at these decisions lightly, I can<br />
say very seriously that I've thought about this issue for<br />
hours and hours and hours over several days and have<br />
discussed it with a range of people.<br />
LYNEHAM: Have they got any rights on their side, the<br />
Iraqis, I mean they lay historic claim to Kuwait, you<br />
could hardly describe the Kuwaiti regime as a paradigm of<br />
democracy? PM: They have no rights to assert their position by<br />
aggression and annexation. Each country has a right to<br />
explain and try and negotiate and achieve a settlement of<br />
a dispute. So that's not in issue. But what is very<br />
very much in issue as far as the rest of the world, and<br />
certainly as far as I'm concerned and the Australian<br />
Government is concerned, is that we have laid down too<br />
many Australian lives in two world wars to fight for the<br />
concept of the freedom and the rights of nations to stand<br />
idly by when those rights are threatened.<br />
LYNEHAM: Some will say historically we've been in nearly<br />
every major stoush since the Crimean War. We always seem<br />
to be among the first in and the last out. I mean where<br />
are the Canadians? Where are the New Zealanders? Where<br />
are most of the Europeans?<br />
PM: Well let me take those in order. The Canadians.<br />
I've had two conversations with Brian Mulroney by phone.<br />
I can say that they are deeply in the process of<br />
considering their position. Now it's not for me to<br />
announce upon what will come out of Canada. But I<br />
believe from the conversations I've had with Prime </p>
<p>Minister Mulroney that you will see Canadian decisions<br />
not inconsistent with what we've done. I've spoken also,<br />
I had a call today from Geoffrey Palmer go to New<br />
Zealand next. They are in the position where they want<br />
to do something. They'll be considering the matter on<br />
Monday. But they haven't got naval assets which are<br />
capable of doing what we're doing. But I can say that<br />
the Prime Minister of New Zealand raised with me in<br />
approving not that we needed his approval but in<br />
expressing his approval of what we've done, raising the<br />
question as to whether New Zealand naval capacities may<br />
be able to pick up some vacuum left by the despatch of<br />
our forces. So there's New Zealand's position. You then<br />
mention Western Europe. Now, two things to be said<br />
about. Firstly there are already the presence of Western<br />
European forces there the British, Italians and the<br />
Dutch. And secondly, that NATO is meeting today in Paris<br />
where the question of their involvement will be further<br />
discussed in detail. So I have no doubt that we will see<br />
a significant Western European involvement as well.<br />
LYNEHAM: You mentioned earlier today the prospect of<br />
Japanese involvement. What grounds do you have for that<br />
PM: I've this is a matter I discussed with the<br />
President, George Bush, at length this morning on the<br />
phone. Now obviously I can't properly go into details of<br />
that discussion but it's possible I think that there may<br />
be some Japanese involvement. They have identified<br />
themselves LYNEHAM: a military nature?<br />
PM: Well, it is conceivable.<br />
LYNEHAM: Even though they are supposed to be a self<br />
defence force?<br />
PM: Well you can say obviously, can't you, that the<br />
defence of all nations is involved in ensuring that<br />
aggression is checked.<br />
LYNEHAM: How did President Bush sound this morning?<br />
He's under a lot of strain at the moment. Was his<br />
demeanour relaxed?<br />
PM: Well he sounded first of all confident, he sounded<br />
buoyant. But there was certainly no flippancy about him.<br />
He explained<br />
LYNEHAM: It's head to head with him and Hussein really<br />
isn't it now, on the world stage?<br />
PM: Well, on the world stage it's important that it not<br />
just be the head of George Bush. It's very important<br />
that the rest of the world which values the principles,<br />
self-determination and the integrity, the territorial </p>
<p>integrity of sovereign states, as we do and as the United<br />
States does, that others stand shoulder to shoulder on<br />
these issues.<br />
LYNEHAM: What happens though if tomorrow night for<br />
example Suddam Hussein takes some of the Australians in<br />
Baghdad, puts them up against a wall and shoots them and<br />
says there will be six more tomorrow night unless you<br />
back down?<br />
PM: That's<br />
LYNEHAM: It's not inconceivable is it?<br />
PM: That's an hypothesis that I'm not going to pursue in<br />
detail, other than to say this<br />
PM: Do you doubt he's capable of it?<br />
PM: Well his behaviour in the past has been less than<br />
rational, and against his own people, let alone against<br />
LYNEHAM: Chemical weapons against the Kurds.<br />
PM: Not only against Kurds but the shooting of his own<br />
officers who don't agree with him. So we're talking<br />
about an individual who is certainly capable of<br />
irrational behaviour. But we considered very carefully<br />
before we made this decision the safety of Australians.<br />
It's been a matter of hourly concern for us. Let me say<br />
to the people of Australia that our diplomatic<br />
representatives in Saudi Arabia and in Baghdad itself, in<br />
Jordan, are continuously working to do everything they<br />
can to ensure the safety of Australians. But I know that<br />
the people of Australia, because their history proves it,<br />
their history proves it, are not a people who are going<br />
to succumb to threats.<br />
0 LYNEHAM: And Bob Hawke won't succumb to threats like<br />
that? PM: Bob Hawke is not a reckless leader of his country.<br />
But I am conscious of the history of my country. I'm<br />
conscious of the principles which are deeply held by the<br />
overwhelming majority of Australians. I believe that<br />
they would expect me to be true to those traditions and<br />
those principles. And I will be.<br />
LYNEHAM: And what of Iraqis here in Australian tonight<br />
who may feel very bitter about your decision and may like<br />
to take some very precipitate action of their own? Do we<br />
have now a domestic security problem here?<br />
PM: I don't think so. I mean we always have well in<br />
place, Paul, the appropriate security measures and I'm<br />
sure that all that needs to be done properly and<br />
appropriately will be done. </p>
<p>LYNEHAM: And if George Bush rings in a week or two and<br />
says could you send a couple more ships or perhaps some<br />
ground troops or some Fl8s, what do you say then?<br />
PM: Well let me say this, that the contribution that<br />
we've made now is a very significant one and is so<br />
regarded by our population size, seventeen million. The<br />
contribution of two frigates and a supply ship is a very<br />
very significant contribution, and as I say, is so<br />
understood. So I would not be expecting that there would<br />
be any further requests. I simply say that if any<br />
further request were made, we would consider it, analyse<br />
it and see if in all the circumstances anything more was<br />
appropriate. But I'd be very surprised if anything more<br />
was asked for.<br />
LYNEHAM: Prime Minister, thanks for your time.<br />
PM: It's been my pleasure Paul. Thank you.<br />
ends </p>
