STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINSTER. THE HON P 3 KEATING MP<br />
URUGUAY ROUND<br />
The Uruguay Round deal to be concluded today will deliver the largest ever world trade<br />
deal and a much needed shot in the arm for the world economv. The OECD has estimated<br />
that for agricultural and industrial products alone it will result in an increase in global<br />
economic activity of up to $ 418 billion by the year 2002 when the effects will be fully felt.<br />
Australia will benefit from enhanced market access. and more predictable market<br />
conditions. The income gain for Australia has been estimated by the OECD at $ 2.5 billion<br />
per year. More recent assessments by the Industry Commission suggest that there may be<br />
as much as a $ 5 billion increase in exports and a $ 3.7 billion increase in Australian gross<br />
domestic product. The results include:<br />
well over $ 1I billion in increased agricuiture exports<br />
a more than fifty per cent cut on average in tariffs across Australia's manufactured<br />
exports. The tariff cuts on Auistralian manufactures will total at least $ 400 million.<br />
improved conditions of trade for our mineral exports. especially coal<br />
the biggest market access tariff cutting package ever achieved 30 times larger than<br />
outcomes achieved from previous rounds<br />
To these figures need to be added gains from expanded services exports and increased sales<br />
and royalties for Australian know how.<br />
Importantly, these increased export opportunities will translate into tens of thousands more<br />
jobs for Australians.<br />
Australia can justly claim credit for its role in securing these benefits. Darticuiarly in the area<br />
of agriculture. As a leader of the Cairns Group. we have worked tirelessly with other likeminded<br />
countries to address the distortions in world a~ zricultural markcts somethin~ z that<br />
has eluded the world trading community for the last 45 years. The Round will see:<br />
3882-</p>
<p>a 21 per cent reduction in subsidised export volumes, an outcome that will be<br />
particularly significant in relation to Europe and the United States, our principal<br />
competitors in world agricultural markets<br />
limits on the extent to which governments can artificially support inefficient domestic<br />
industries cuts in trade barrers and improved market access for a wide range of commodities of<br />
particular significance to Australia ( including rice. beef, dairy), and<br />
a much more predictable and transparent trading environment through the conversion of<br />
non-tariff measures to tariffs, together with commitments to reduce tariffs substantially.<br />
There will be almost 50 million tonnes 1= subsidised wheat on world markets over the<br />
period 1995-2000 than if the current level of export subsidies had continued.<br />
The difficulties Ausukaihas experienced as a result of the US Export Enhancement<br />
Program ( EEP) will also be reduced under the new export subsidy disciplines. Total<br />
allocations for subsidised wheat under the EEP scheme this year were 32 million tonnes and<br />
$ US 1 billion; by the year 2000. these will be limited to 14.5 million ronnes and $ US 364<br />
million. Beef, rice, and other commodities will each benefit from reductions in export subsidies.<br />
Combined with major improvements in market access, these measures open key agricultural<br />
markets and provide for expanded production.<br />
The Andriessen assurance protecting Asian markets from subsidised EU beef exports will<br />
continue. We have also won a new assurance from the United Stares that FEP subsidised<br />
rice will nor be introduced inro the newly opened Asian markets.<br />
Once the agreement is fully implemented. Australian farmers can expect an increase in<br />
income of around $ 1 billion per year from these reforms to world agricultural trade.<br />
Australia is likely to receive:<br />
an extra $ 340 million per year in beef exports with significant improvements in the US.<br />
Japanese and Korean markets. The US Meat Import Law which has created difficulties<br />
for Australia since 1964 will be repealed.<br />
$ 250 million in wheaL<br />
$ 125 million in dair-Y.<br />
Producers of coarse grains, sugar. sheepmeat and rice are expected to benefit by up to 175<br />
million. The decisions by Japan and the Republic of Korea to open their rice markets for the first<br />
Lime symbolises the hiich level of commitment to achieving a positive Round outcome. I<br />
recognise and pay tribute to the leadership displayed hy Prime Minister Hosokawa and<br />
President Kim Young Sam on this issue. From 1995. Japan will allow in around 400. M()<br />
tonnes of imported rice or four per cent of d6mestic production. Over the period through to<br />
the v'ear 2000. that access will increase to 800.000 tonnes around double Australia's<br />
current level of total rice exports. valued at around $ 230 million. 3 8 8: i </p>
<p>In minerals and mauatrdproducts. Australian exporters will meap major dividends<br />
through the final across-the-board figure for tariff cuts of close to 50 per cent. And<br />
importantly. over 75 per cent of Australia's total trade will now face ' bound" tariffs,<br />
increasing certainty for exporters. Key outcomes include significantly improved market<br />
access for non-ferrous metals, steel, processed foods. and a wide range of high value added<br />
manufactured exports.<br />
An agreement has been negotiated to improve conditions of Australia's coal trade to Europe<br />
by eliminating trade barriers and securing reductions in subsidies on coal.<br />
Participation, for the first time, by a wide range of developing countries in the outcomes will<br />
bring guarantees of improved market access in some of the fastest growing world markets,<br />
particularly those in our region.<br />
The agreement on trade in services will provide. for the first time. international rules that<br />
allow Australian services exports. already worth some 15 billion, to compete on an equal<br />
footing in this fastest growing area of world trade.<br />
The services agreement will provide important guarantees of non-discriminatory access in<br />
telecommunications with a regional market expected to grow to over $ 110 billion.<br />
Financial reform in regional markets should ensure continuing improvements to market<br />
access under the GATS.<br />
Export prospects of business services and the professions will be improved in important<br />
markets such as legal services in Japan and insurance markets in Korea.<br />
Australian cultural industry and intellectual iroperty innovators will receive a boost from<br />
this outcome. Our music and film producers, writers and book publishers and computer<br />
software industry will all benefit from intellectual property and copyright protection which<br />
will result from the Trade in Intellectual Property ( TRIPS) agreement.<br />
There will also be important benefits to manufacturing exporters and business from<br />
strengthened and improved agreements on standards, anti-dumping and industrial subsidies.<br />
On the environment, the Round is expected to result in agreement to a trade and<br />
environment work program for the new Multilate ral Trade Organisation. The inclusion of<br />
trade and environment in the Uruguay Round agreement reaffirms the goals set at Rio de<br />
Janeiro last year and will facilitate the integration of trade and envirornent policies.<br />
As I said following the Seattle Summit. I believe the GATT-and APEC will perform<br />
complementary and mutually reinforcing functions. GATT sets the framework at the global<br />
level, providing a set of rules to liberalise trade in goods and services, and protecting<br />
intellectual property rights. Within this framework. APEC is there to facilitate and expand<br />
regional trade by encouraging cooperation, a greater sense of shared interests. and working<br />
towards harmonisation of rules and standards.<br />
3 8 P4 </p>
<p>The successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round will fundamentally strengthen the base for<br />
Australia's economic expansion. Our export performance. one of the success stories of the<br />
Australian economy over the last decade, can only continue to improve as industry takes<br />
advantage of the trading opportunities presented by the finalisation of this marathon<br />
process. The commtment of Australia, in its own right and as a leader of the Cairns Group of fair<br />
agricultural traders, has paid off. I would like to particularly commend the efforts of our<br />
negotiators in Geneva. ably led by Senator Cook-Their unstinting efforts in pursuing the<br />
best possible outcome for Australia have ensured that we will benefit substantially from the<br />
opening of trading opportunities which this historic GATT deal represents.<br />
The Uruguay Round outcome will lead to a more open and active trading system. expansion<br />
of economic activity, greater prosperity and employment. The multilateral trading system<br />
has been expanded and revitalised this will serve Austr-alia well into the next century. It is<br />
a fitting conclusion to the most ambitious multilateral trade exercise ever undertaken. We<br />
have had 7 long years of negotiations with 100-plus countries each vying to ensure their<br />
priorities were reflected in the final deal. It is extremely heartening that in the final days. all<br />
participants recognised that the compromises they have made are more than made up for by<br />
the benefits flowing from a successful overall outcome.<br />
