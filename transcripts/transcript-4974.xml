FOR PRLESS 27 FEBURARY 1979<br />
Joint Statement<br />
the Prime Minister and the Premier of Western Australia<br />
A joint Commonwealth-Western Australia Report on the Ord River<br />
irrigation scheme has recommended continued Government support.<br />
The Report compiled after a study by Sir Norman Young with the<br />
assistance of Commonwealth and State representatives calls for<br />
increased research and continuing financial support for farmers.<br />
The Report has been submitted to the Prime Minister, Mr Fraser,<br />
and the Premier of Western Australia, Sir Charles Court.<br />
H,, r Fraser and Sir Charles today welcomed the Report as an<br />
important advance in assessment of the Ord project's future.<br />
Consideration of the findings would require continued close<br />
co-o-peration between the Commonwealth and State Governments<br />
arnd this would be undertaken.<br />
They said the central finding of the study was that it was<br />
not possible to assess the project's long-term potential on<br />
the basis of the information presently available.<br />
Further time was needed to determine whether the combined<br />
results of research programmes and commercial farming experience<br />
were likely to provide a basis for profitable agriculture.<br />
There was no basis for assuming that the adverse factors which<br />
had inhibited the project's development in the past would<br />
necessarily persist in the future.<br />
The Prime Minister and Premier said the study had found that<br />
the project should be supported by public funds for at least<br />
a further five years.<br />
If a proper judgement was to be made about potential, it<br />
was essential that further information be gained from farming<br />
experience and the testing of research results on a commercial<br />
scale. The difficulties encountered on the Ord to date were not due<br />
to the way in which the project had been administered. They<br />
had resulted from an inherent high cost structure and stillincomplete<br />
understanding of the area's basic agronomy. 2 </p>

The Prime inister and Premier said the study had found that<br />
rice and sunflowers showed promise of being commercially successful.<br />
Budget calculations indicated that soya and mung beans had merit,<br />
although there were technical and market problems to be overcome.<br />
It has concluded that, although there did not appear to be any<br />
prospect for immediate investment ina sugar industry at the Ord<br />
because of the current world sugar position, the Western<br />
Australian Department of Agriculture's sugar research progranrmie<br />
should be continued to incresase knowledge of agronomic, varietal<br />
and yield characteristics.<br />
The study concluded that the primary responsibility for the<br />
project had to remain with the State Government.<br />
It also took the view that Commonwealth funds should be provided<br />
for crop handling and processing facilities where it could be<br />
established that the facilities would be justified by an improved<br />
outlook for successful commercial farming. The Commonwealth<br />
Government was also seen to have a role in research.<br />
