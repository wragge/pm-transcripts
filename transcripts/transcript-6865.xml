TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH MARK DAY, DAY BY DAY, CHANNEL 7,<br />
MELBOURNE 12 MARCH 18<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
DAY: Mr Hawke thanks for your time. Don't worry about Dame<br />
Edna, she'll keep. We'll put you first.<br />
JOURNALIST: I feel very relaxed about that Mark. You seem to be<br />
much more upset about it than I am.<br />
MARK: I'm not the least bit upset Prime Minister. That kind of<br />
economic scenario, very tight Budget once again. It's<br />
reportedly lead to a warning from Senator Graeme Richardson, from<br />
the New South Wales Right, that too-tough a Budget could cost a<br />
lot.<br />
PM: Now, let's just get a few things straight first. -You keep<br />
saying that this a Paul Keating Budget strategy. Let's not leave<br />
it all on Paul's shoulders. The strategy that has been followed<br />
since we've been in office has been very much a Government<br />
strategy. of course the Treasurer has -the main responsibility<br />
for formulation and articulation. But the strategy is a strategy<br />
of the Government and has been spectacularly successful. Now<br />
we've come toa situation where, because of the very dramatic<br />
turnaround in the last six or nine months in ouir terms of trade<br />
against it, -a sharp decline in the prices we receive for so many<br />
of our export commodities, increased prices for imports, this<br />
dramatic turnaround in terms of trade has posed new pressures and<br />
constraints upon us. We can't keep on borrowing from the rest of<br />
the world and -expect to maintain positions on that basis.<br />
Therefore we have to reduce our demand upon the market and that<br />
requires us exercise considerable spending restraints. And that<br />
policy, which has been put forward in the submission to which you<br />
refer, has now been embraced by the Cabinet and by the Ministry<br />
and it will be followed through. Now, of course, it's true Mark,<br />
that in the proc ' ess of having to make some expenditure cuts, to<br />
restrain the level of government outlays, that there will be some<br />
hurt. There's no doubt about that. But in the past we have<br />
last year one and a quarter billion expenditure cuts. We've<br />
shown a capacity to get our priorities right. And I have a very<br />
considerable faith in the capacity of the Australian electorate<br />
to look at economic policy as a whole, to understand that we<br />
can't just go along expecting to live on our borrowings from the<br />
rest of the world, and they'll accept it.<br />
DAY: Prime Minister, you say some hurt. Senator Richardson is<br />
quoted as saying that it could cost you office, do you go that<br />
far? </p>
<p>pm: well, if one was silly about the way one went about it you<br />
could put yourself at risk. We have shown, I think, an<br />
outstanding capacity in the three years in office to get the<br />
balance right and we'll continue to do that. But it's proper, in<br />
the same sense as I had no complaint about the letter from my<br />
seven Ministers. I didn't like it being leaked, but I respected<br />
their expression of concern about the need to take account of<br />
particular interests. Now Senator Richardson is saying the same<br />
thing. Well we'll take those considerations into account.<br />
DAY: You say we can't keep on borrowing forever and yet talking<br />
to Mr Keating this afternoon he suggested that a deficit in the<br />
order of $ 5 billion may be the 1986/ 87 go. That's still a lot of<br />
borrowing. PM: But it's still considerably less than when we came in and on<br />
a much higher level of gross domestic product.<br />
DAY: So you think we can keep on borrowing?<br />
PM: No. I'm saying that we are successively bringing down the<br />
Budget. We inherited a position when we came in, that the<br />
deficit was in the order of five per cent of our gross domestic<br />
product. Now this year we've brottgh. t--it down to 2.1 per cent.<br />
In other words, we're bringing down the absolute level* 1 of the<br />
deficit and we've been doing that in a situation where we're very<br />
significantly increasing output. Now that's what we want to<br />
continue to do.<br />
DAY: Do you think that many old timers, particularly Labor old<br />
timers, might be a bit puzzled at the sight of a Labor Treasurer<br />
flattening down, if you like, the seven ministers who wanted to<br />
spend more on social matters<br />
PM: Let's get it right. What you're seeming to imply is that<br />
there's going to be absolute real cuts in expenditure. What<br />
we're talking about is arranging programs in a way in which-there<br />
will still be real increases in outlays. We did that last year<br />
while we had cuts in the order of $ 1.25 billion. we rearranged<br />
programs in a way which allowed new initiatives to be taken in<br />
our period in office.' Where we've had significant cuts in<br />
outlays we've still had new policies and initiatives which have<br />
meant, in the area of social welfare, increases beyond indexation<br />
of $ 1.4 billion.<br />
DAY: But some ministers and many backbenchers are saying that's<br />
not enough. I<br />
PM: Ministers and backbencherswere saying in 1983 that our<br />
Budget was too tough. They were saying it in ' 84, but we got mix<br />
right and in the process it's had the greatest increase in<br />
employment in the history of this country. And that's the<br />
greatest cause of poverty in this country unemployment. We've*<br />
got now 608,000 Australians in jobs who weren't in jobs before we<br />
came to office. And at the same time as I say, 1.4 billion<br />
additional real dollars, beyond indexation. Now this has been<br />
not only a government of economic efficiency. it's been a<br />
government which has been true to the ideals of not merely the<br />
Labor Party, but what the people of Australia want greater<br />
equity. </p>
<p>3<br />
DAY: Could I just cover a couple of other topics very briefly?<br />
PM: Sure.<br />
DAY: The opinion polls out today Hawke 57, Howard 30. in view<br />
of that from the Morgan Poll in the Bulletin did you possibly<br />
urge Mr Keating to go lightly on Mr Howard in the Parliament and<br />
not to crucify him?<br />
PM: No. I have total con ' fidence in Mr Keating in how he'll<br />
handle himself. I don't brief my ministers before the Parliament<br />
resumes. DAY: Well are you surprised perhaps that Mr Keating didn't, this<br />
week, seek to crucify Mr Howard?<br />
PM: well I don't think in a sense you need to crucify Mr Howard<br />
when he's doing such an excellent job of seif-crucifixtion.<br />
DAY: Mr Hawke, one other question. Also in the Bulletin today<br />
the proposed new flag, the submission from Ausflag to request to<br />
the Government would it please consider it and possibly put it<br />
to the people. Now are you impressed by it?<br />
PM: Well I think as designs go, it's not a bad design. But I<br />
said look there are so many more important things ' that we, the<br />
Government, are concerned with, that we have no intention of<br />
changing the flag. I think it's healthy that people are thinking<br />
about these things, but as I've said, in this whole area of flags<br />
and symbols, republicanism and so on, that's the sort of thing<br />
the people of Australia have got to think through, talk through.<br />
And if you get to the sort of position where the people want<br />
those sort of things to happen and clearly want them to happen,<br />
then they will. There's not going to be some government<br />
initiative on this matter.<br />
DAY: Are you clearly closing the door to any move to tie in with<br />
the 1988 Bicentenary?<br />
PM: Well I'm saying we have no intentions about it. If you got<br />
the situation where overwhelming the Australian people are saying<br />
that's what they'd like, well the Government would facilitate it.<br />
But it's not our initiative.<br />
DAY: Mr Hawke thanks very much.<br />
ends </p>
