PRIME MNISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 17 AUGUST 1988<br />
Her Majesty's announcement of the resignation of Sir Ninian<br />
Stephen as Governor-General of Australia marks the end of a<br />
distinguished term of service by a most highly respected<br />
Australian in this high office.<br />
on behalf of the Government, I place on record our<br />
appreciation of Sir Ninian.' s service to his country and our<br />
deep respect for the outstanding way in which he has c~ rried<br />
out his duties. He has pursued a demanding task with<br />
vigour and energy, combined with good humour and dignity.<br />
The office of Governor-General has, during his occupancy,<br />
enjoyed wide recognition and regard throughout the<br />
community. Sir Ninian will be relinquishing his appointment after<br />
nearly seven years in office. It was a measure of our<br />
admiration for the contribution he was making that the<br />
Government asked if he would be willing to extend his term<br />
for a period of almost 2 years in order to continue in<br />
office through the bicentennial year. Sir Ninian will step<br />
down with the good wishes of us all and our earnest hope<br />
that he and Lady Stephen will continue to enjoy health and<br />
happiness in the years ahead.<br />
