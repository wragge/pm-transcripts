PM: Today, Dr Howson has sold out the ' indigenious people of Australia. He has sold out the<br />
Ular and decent traditions of his country and he has sold out on tho hopes and expectations<br />
Of those moderates; in the Ubera Party who thought he rnight have turned over a now leaf<br />
after the election. What has happened here is, out of weaknma rather than out of strength,<br />
Dr Howson has caved In to states' interests. In this asm one state, Wastcm Australia,<br />
while mouthing the rhetoric of the High Court decision saying he supports the 16giI Court<br />
decision. But yes, Dr Howson, but only so long as it stands beyond extinguishment from<br />
the actions of some errant state.<br />
The only way that we can bring certainty to this Issue is to pass the Federal Governmnens,<br />
my Governent's, legislation. And 1 can think of nothing worse than a Senate inquiry.<br />
After spoiling for a year. going around Aboriginal communities acceptinzg their hospitality<br />
and their goodwill, taking them down while all the time conniving in the possible pilrering<br />
of their title, he's now recommending a Senate inquiry. Tlic bust thing Dr Hewson can do<br />
is to get his shameftl speech over and done with so that more seaiuus people in Wis Party<br />
can get on with trying to rebuild it.<br />
J How much harder is this going to make the task of getting acceptance for your Maibo<br />
legislation?<br />
P'M: Wcl, I had hoped that the Aboriginal people of this country could have gone, with this<br />
legislation, with the support of all major parties. I mean, Isn't it time after two hundredl<br />
years that these people -having been given a private title right by the highest court in our<br />
countiy could have expected both major parties, the Coalition and the Government of<br />
this country, to have gone to the Parliament with legislation which was unasimous? Mhs<br />

is not so. It will mean that the GOVefW lt will Perhiat with its leg8ilon it will succeed<br />
with itg legislation. If$ s Iir, workable leogisaton ad it doesn' extinguish the rights to title<br />
in the way in which Dr HamWsns proposals would.<br />
J: Do you have any reason to believe that the Oroons and the Democrats will definitely<br />
support it., because obviously you'll need them now, itfs crucial?<br />
M: Well. well need them but lt the Aboriginal people who will need them. The Aboriginal<br />
and Islander commuty in our country wil need them. And I believe that every fbIr<br />
thinking person in the Senate will see the legislation for what it is a decent and<br />
honorable attempt at settling an Issue of two hundred years in the making.<br />
1: Prime Minister, it looks as though the NAFTA vote will go the President's way. What are<br />
the Imiplicaions of that for the APEC moetinB?<br />
PM: Well, I think they are very good implications. If the President wins it means the winds of<br />
free trade are blowing in the United States. And what the president will say is conr&amp; M<br />
what Secretary Christopher said today and that is America will be looking weag of the<br />
Pacific, leaving behind some of Its Euroceinricity and taking up the great growth market<br />
of the Asia-Pacific where the preponderance of American trade already exists. in making<br />
a decision in favour of the North American Free Trade Agreement the Congress will be, in<br />
fact, endorsing the President's view of engagement with tile rest of the world rathe than<br />
the fallback. to protectionism, an America-first policy which would not have delivered<br />
highur incomes and more jobs to American.<br />
J Prime Minister, do you think youll be able to avoid a Senat inquiry as Dr Hoewson has<br />
asked for now, or do you think you'll have to go thriough with one?<br />
PM: I think that anyone who has interests for Aboriginal and Islander people in Australia can<br />
best fuzlfll them by passing this legislation. Not by shifting Offito Some Senate Committee.<br />
I mean, what light is the Senate going to shed on this? A bunch of biased Liberals at boat,<br />
or weak liberals at the worst who ffiled to sop Dr Howson, Poring over the<br />
Government's principal legislation. Where is that going to got us?<br />
J. The Democrats and the Oreens have shown that they're attracted to Senate inquiiei<br />
the past. W~ hat is your message to them at this moment? rsi<br />
PM: Well, I think my message is to listen to the Aboriginal people of tius coiuntry. Listen to<br />
them and let them tell the Senators that they want the Bill passed, And listen to the<br />
representative people who genuinely represent institutional groups within the Aboriginal<br />
and Islander community who themselves represent very large constituencies. And they'll<br />
say, " Pass the Bill".<br />
ends, IZj025 </p>
