FOR PRESS: PM. No. 76/ 1e67<br />
CCRIO BY-ELECTION RESULT<br />
Comment by the Prime Minister, Mr Harold Holt<br />
Labor has had a good win in Cor'o and Mr Scholes s ent* tled<br />
to his congratulations. No doubt some electors felt they could give the Government<br />
a knock without the risk of changing it, and there were some local factors<br />
contributing to the swing from the Government.<br />
In a by-election, voting usually runs against the ruling party<br />
but 4s a notoriously unreliable barometer to voting at a general election.<br />
This was demonstrated last year when Labor's win in Dawson was followed<br />
by their greatest rout in history at the subsequent general election.<br />
I still believe we offered Corio the best candidate and the best<br />
policies. The majorfty of the voters preferred a local man despite the<br />
uncertainties which persist in regard to future Labor policies and<br />
organisation. Mr Vlhitlam, who literally installed himself in the electorate,<br />
will gain credit from many for the contribut'on from his vigorous<br />
campaigning, just as he will lose credibility with others for the gross<br />
misstatements he so blatantly perpetrated.<br />
Our reverse in Corio will make us determined to regain that<br />
seat at the first opportunity.<br />
CANBERRA, 23rd July, 1967. </p>
