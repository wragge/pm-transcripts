STATEMENT AT S. E. A. T. O.<br />
The following is a summary of a statement by the<br />
Prime Minister, Mr. Menzies, . t the opening public session of<br />
S. E. A. T. O. Council on March 27th<br />
SEATO is meeting at a very important time in the world's<br />
history. For some time global war has been restrained by the<br />
balancing of military power and feeling has grown that a great<br />
war is improbable, except through an act of lunacy or error of<br />
judgment. But absence of major war does not reflect a Communist<br />
change of heart. They are deterred from major war by what the<br />
free world possesses. They are more likely to move in other<br />
channels. Peaceful co-existence is a rather agreeable expression<br />
if your neighbour underst ands it as you do. Apparently Chinese<br />
Communist conception of the term involves retention of the faculty<br />
of physical aggression to enforce their political aims. Whether<br />
that is so or not, it is still true that the absence of major war<br />
may increase the risk of minor conflicts. It certainly increases<br />
risks of internal subversion, infiltration and overthrowing of<br />
Governments and institutions. The danger is even greater now<br />
than a few years ago.<br />
It is a very good thing that in relation to South East<br />
Asia all of us meeting today, determined to resist Cormmunism,<br />
should have the opportunity of putting our heads together and<br />
considering how we arc to meet those-threats, not merely on the<br />
great and spectacular scale, but in relation to these new methods<br />
and these now risks.<br />
The following is verbatim:<br />
Mr. Menzies said: '! Of course, that is not the only<br />
thing. Cormmunism is to be resisted not only by force of arms,<br />
though we must not shrink from. that. It is also to be resisted<br />
by the developed character of people, by the building up of their<br />
own genuine belief in their owin freedom, by the improvement in<br />
their own economy. It is to be resisted, as I said last year at<br />
a Council Meeting in Washington, by doveloping a sense of<br />
com~ iriunity which will translate the South-East Asia freaty<br />
Organisation into a genuine community of self-interest, of selfreliance,<br />
and of mutual trust,.<br />
We meet here not only as countries that havo signed a<br />
Treaty with each other. I believe that w.-e meet here as people<br />
who are friends, who have courage, who have vision, who recognise<br />
that on matters of detail they may have differences and must<br />
have differonces, but that in total, and in the upshot, they<br />
will be found of one voice and of one mind and, above all other<br />
things, of one stout heart."<br />
