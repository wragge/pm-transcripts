    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE..................</p>
<p>  Thank you very much Everald, ladies and gentlemen. It's a pleasure for me</p>
<p>   to be back again to the National Seniors' Association Convention and to</p>
<p>   have been invited to address you, and to declare it open.</p>
<p>  I thank you Everald for the kind remarks that you have offered in relation</p>
<p>   to the East Timor issue. This has been the biggest foreign policy and defence</p>
<p>   challenge to confront Australia for more than 30 years and I know that every</p>
<p>   Australian will be thinking of our men and women in East Timor, will be</p>
<p>   immensely proud of what they are doing, of the professional way in which</p>
<p>   they have gone about their task, and they will be aware that they are carrying</p>
<p>   a very special leadership role and a very special sense of honour and distinction</p>
<p>   to the Australian nation because this indeed is the first time in the history</p>
<p>   of Australia that we have been invited to play a leadership role in an international</p>
<p>   peacekeeping operation. It is the largest military involvement for Australian</p>
<p>   forces since the Vietnam War more than 30 years ago.</p>
<p>  We hope that they will all be safe and they will all come home to their</p>
<p>   loved ones soon. But it is a dangerous mission and it's a mission that is</p>
<p>   being carried out in the name of all of us because we share in common with</p>
<p>   the rest of the world certain values about the right of men and women to</p>
<p>   freedom everywhere in the world.</p>
<p>  I will be having the opportunity later on this morning of meeting for the</p>
<p>   first time Xanana Gusmao who is recognised as the most significant leader</p>
<p>   of the East Timorese people. Now, I know that what has happened in East</p>
<p>   Timor in recent months has touched a lot of Australians right across the</p>
<p>   political spectrum and irrespective of differences of opinion they might</p>
<p>   have on other issues, and as I said in my address to the nation, we are</p>
<p>   there for two reasons. We are there because it is right to be there and</p>
<p>   we are there because it is in Australia's interest to be there, and we should</p>
<p>   remind ourselves that we are there also at the invitation of the United</p>
<p>   Nations and with the approval of the Government of Indonesia.</p>
<p>  I am, as I said, delighted to be here to open this Association's convention</p>
<p>   to honour the contribution that the members of this association, and that</p>
<p>   generation of Australians from which they are drawn, has made to the development</p>
<p>   of our country.</p>
<p>  As we survey the national economic scene and as we look at Australia's place</p>
<p>   in the world we see a country that in national economic terms has not been</p>
<p>   as strong and as prosperous as it is now for more than 30 years. In many</p>
<p>   ways, the Australian economy now is better and stronger than it's ever been.</p>
<p>   Our inflation rate is low, our interest rates are low, I know that doesn't</p>
<p>   necessarily come with greetings from everybody in this audience I recognise</p>
<p>   that, there's an upside and a downside to every state but as far as the</p>
<p>   contribution to the national economic activity in investment is concerned,</p>
<p>   it does have advantages. We have got our budget in surplus. We have very</p>
<p>   high levels of business investment, we have strong levels of economic growth,</p>
<p>   we have stared down the worst economic downturn the Asia Pacific region</p>
<p>   has seen since World War II and we have actually done better on that score</p>
<p>   than I suspected we would do about a year ago.</p>
<p>  So nationally, the scene is very strong and I am very happy to say that</p>
<p>   unemployment is looking better than I thought it would be a year ago. There</p>
<p>   is every prospect that unemployment can fall further, just how much I am</p>
<p>   not going to predict, but employment growth is very strong and over the</p>
<p>   last three and a half years we've created 526,000 new jobs in this country.</p>
<p>  So economically, Australia is in a strong position. We are recognised as</p>
<p>   being in a strong position around the world and that, of course, has underwritten</p>
<p>   our capacity to do other things. One of the reasons why we have been able</p>
<p>   to assume a leadership role in events in our region is that our economy</p>
<p>   is in a strong position. If it weren't we wouldn't be able to do that nearly</p>
<p>   as convincingly.</p>
<p>  We did have to take, when we first came into office, a number of budget</p>
<p>   decisions that not everybody agreed with and they still don't agree with</p>
<p>   that and I understand that. And you don't have the opportunity in government</p>
<p>   if you are moving forward and undertaking necessary reforms to do so without</p>
<p>   there being some criticism. But we have endeavoured to spread the burden</p>
<p>   fairly and evenly. We have endeavoured to protect the vulnerable in the</p>
<p>   community and we have also endeavoured to keep the goals of the Government</p>
<p>   fixed very firmly on necessary economic reform.</p>
<p>  Now, I know that the economic reform that is of most interest to people</p>
<p>   at the present time is the introduction of a new taxation system. We had</p>
<p>   a very lengthy debate in the lead up to the last election and I know that</p>
<p>   there were a lot of retired people who were concerned about aspects of the</p>
<p>   tax package. And I want to assure you that in the months that lie between</p>
<p>   now and the introduction of the tax package on the 1st of July</p>
<p>   next year the Government will be committing a lot of resources to fully</p>
<p>   explaining how the system is going to work. It is a big change. It's a very</p>
<p>   beneficial change. It's going to make the operations of business in Australia</p>
<p>   less costly. It's going to reduce the cost of our exports. It's going to</p>
<p>   reduce the cost of fuel which is very important for our country people and</p>
<p>   particularly for people who live in the larger States and the more sparsely</p>
<p>   populated areas of Australia.</p>
<p>  There are going to be very big reductions in income tax. There are going</p>
<p>   to be special provisions for retired people and for people on the pension.</p>
<p>   Under the new tax system, for example, aged pensioners will benefit from</p>
<p>   higher aged and service pensions and allowances, a higher pensioner rebate,</p>
<p>   a one off savings bonus and also if they pay tax lower taxation rates.</p>
<p>  From July of next year pensions will rise by four per cent and the base</p>
<p>   pension will continue to be protected by ensuring that the maximum single</p>
<p>   rate is at least 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings. Pensions</p>
<p>   will be guaranteed, let me repeat, guaranteed to stay at least two per cent</p>
<p>   ahead of price rises. The existing pension rebates and low income aged persons</p>
<p>   rebate will be maintained to ensure that maximum rate pensioners and low</p>
<p>   income self-funded retirees continue to pay no personal income tax.</p>
<p>  On top of this, the maximum rebate will rise by $250 a year and $175 a year</p>
<p>   for each member of a couple. This means that pensioners and eligible self-funded</p>
<p>   retirees will be able to earn more from the 1st of July next</p>
<p>   year without paying personal income tax. The pension income test withdrawal</p>
<p>   rate has also been reduced to allow pensioners to earn more without such</p>
<p>   a dramatic effect on their pension. And to ensure that these assistance</p>
<p>   measures are maintained over time the Government will set up an independent</p>
<p>   compensation review in 2003.</p>
<p>  The Government will provide two new savings bonuses to help maintain the</p>
<p>   value of the savings of older Australians following the introduction of</p>
<p>   the GST. There will be a one off non-taxable aged persons savings bonus</p>
<p>   of up to $1,000 for each person aged 60 or more on the 1st of</p>
<p>   July next year. There will also be an additional one off non-taxable self-funded</p>
<p>   retirees' supplementary bonus of up to $2,000 for each person aged 55 or</p>
<p>   more who does not receive the Commonwealth income support payment.</p>
<p>  The Government is conducting a comprehensive education and communication</p>
<p>   campaign to inform Australians about the new tax system. For example, information</p>
<p>   is being provided to older Australians through the quarterly newsletter</p>
<p>   Aged Pension News.</p>
<p>  In addition to the fundamental changes to the tax system, which include</p>
<p>   incidentally the abolition of provisional taxation and the introduction</p>
<p>   of imputation credits, there have been major changes to business taxation</p>
<p>   arrangements which are in some respects of special significance to retired</p>
<p>   people.</p>
<p>  The proposed reduction in capital gains tax, if it secures parliamentary</p>
<p>   approval, will greatly benefit self-funded retirees. For them the capital</p>
<p>   gains tax rate will effectively be cut in half while for those still operating</p>
<p>   farms or others sorts of businesses the rate will effectively fall by up</p>
<p>   to 75 per cent.</p>
<p>  People over 55 who sell their farm or other small business that they have</p>
<p>   owned for more than 15 years for the purposes of living on the proceeds</p>
<p>   for retirement will be exempted from capital gains tax altogether. And that</p>
<p>   represents a very significant reform which will be of enormous benefit to</p>
<p>   many people within the age group represented by this audience.</p>
<p>  I know that the changes involved in tax reform are extensive. I also know</p>
<p>   from my years of political life that it's always possible to run a scare</p>
<p>   campaign. And we ran the gauntlet of a lot of scare campaigns on taxation</p>
<p>   reform. The scare campaign was run during the election campaign, it was</p>
<p>   run again while we were negotiating the legislation through Parliament,</p>
<p>   and it goes on. But let me assure you that not only are there enormous benefits</p>
<p>   for the whole country, for all of us as Australians in these reforms, there</p>
<p>   are also very significant benefits for individuals. And we have gone out</p>
<p>   of our way to protect not only the vulnerable in our community but also</p>
<p>   retired people who have earned the right to have a secure income and lifestyle</p>
<p>   in their retirement, and are entitled to be protected against any assault</p>
<p>   on that sense of security by major changes such as taxation reform.</p>
<p>  The Government of course is not only looking at taxation policy and how</p>
<p>   it impacts on older people, but also other policy areas. Health care is</p>
<p>   of great importance to all of us and responding to the practical health</p>
<p>   care needs of older Australians has been a major priority of my Government.</p>
<p>   And we have done a number of things. We've provided a 30% tax rebate for</p>
<p>   private health insurance premiums, and that will be of particular benefit</p>
<p>   to retired people. It will reward those who have taken out private health</p>
<p>   insurance, it is non-means tested, and I know that particular element is</p>
<p>   especially welcome. And it will play a major role in strengthening the place</p>
<p>   of private health insurance in the overall health system of this country.</p>
<p>   We have extended the Commonwealth Seniors' Card to a further 220,000 self-funded</p>
<p>   retirees by increasing the income limits for those cards. And we have extended</p>
<p>   the Veterans' Gold Card to a further 50,000 World War II veterans.</p>
<p>  As a mark of our gratitude and respect for the important role that carers</p>
<p>   play in our society, the Government has provided $82 million to boost respite</p>
<p>   care services for carers of people with dementia, and other cognitive and</p>
<p>   behavioural difficulties. New respite services will be developed and a number</p>
<p>   of these will be designed to provide flexible respite care in rural and</p>
<p>   remote areas.</p>
<p>  In my key note address to the ACOSS Conference last year and just after</p>
<p>   the federal election, I undertook to leave as a permanent reminder of the</p>
<p>   International Year of Older persons a new basis for a substantial advance</p>
<p>   in the quality of health care delivered to older Australians. This year's</p>
<p>   budget provided $171 million as a major boost to general practice, and for</p>
<p>   the first time the Government has decided to introduce a Medicare benefits</p>
<p>   scheme item for annual voluntary health assessments for all people 75 years</p>
<p>   of age and over. And these health assessments will be undertaken at home</p>
<p>   where possible, and will help older Australians to remain in their homes</p>
<p>   a lot longer.</p>
<p>  From next month and for the first time Medicare will provide funding for</p>
<p>   GPs in the work they undertake with other care providers in planning care</p>
<p>   for people, particularly older Australians, who have chronic and complex</p>
<p>   needs. And this is to be complemented by the practice incentives program</p>
<p>   for GPs to ensure that patients aged over 65 with chronic and complex needs</p>
<p>   have care plan if they need them. The existing coordinated care trials will</p>
<p>   continue to be supported and further developed. And these trials specifically</p>
<p>   address the needs of older people who are chronically ill or disadvantaged</p>
<p>   with a focus on the frail aged. The Government has also provided $41 million</p>
<p>   for the establishment of care link centres to give single regional contact</p>
<p>   points across Australia for community care services. These centres will</p>
<p>   improve the integration of service delivery particularly for people needing</p>
<p>   packages of high-level community care as an alternative to residential care.</p>
<p>   The budget has also allocated $6 million to train health workers in further</p>
<p>   research into preventing falls, particularly by older people.</p>
<p>  The international year of older people has seen many initiatives to recognise</p>
<p>   their significant contribution. Two weeks ago I had the pleasure to award</p>
<p>   the inaugural Commonwealth Senior Australian of the Year Award to a greatly</p>
<p>   loved Australian, Slim Dusty. And I'm pleased that this program will continue</p>
<p>   beyond the end of this international year. And I'm particularly pleased</p>
<p>   to learn that the National Seniors' Association is joining forces with the</p>
<p>   Australia Day Council for a Senior Australian of the Year Award from the</p>
<p>   year 2000. I think that's an excellent idea. And in parallel with the Government's</p>
<p>   award we have also announced the Commonwealth Recognition Award for senior</p>
<p>   Australians to highlight the need to widely recognise the important role</p>
<p>   of older people in the Australian community.</p>
<p>  Another worthy project that will benefit all of us is the national active</p>
<p>   Australia campaign. It's designed to promote the benefits of physical activity</p>
<p>   not only for older Australians but indeed for all Australians. And as part</p>
<p>   of the Government's Business and Community Partnerships initiative, we have</p>
<p>   created the self-service banking and older Australians project. This partnership</p>
<p>   involves the Australian Bankers' Association and a number of peak organisations</p>
<p>   representing the interests of older people to assist them to understand</p>
<p>   the new technology associated with electronic banking.</p>
<p>  It is important as all of us receive the benefits of longer life and better</p>
<p>   health in our more mature years, it's important to understand the strategic</p>
<p>   challenge that this represents for governments of whatever particular stripe.</p>
<p>   In 20 years time there will be almost twice as many people aged over 65</p>
<p>   years or more as there are now. It's important to recognise that the majority</p>
<p>   of these will be women. By the year 2021 it's projected that nearly one</p>
<p>   in five Australians will be a women 65 years or over. These trends provide</p>
<p>   not only a major challenge, but they also provide major opportunities for</p>
<p>   our community. And it's very important that we look at these developments</p>
<p>   not in a negative light, but indeed in an overwhelmingly positive light.</p>
<p>   Australia is a lot better positioned to cope financially with population</p>
<p>   ageing than most OECD countries because we do have a relatively younger</p>
<p>   age profile than many of the European societies and Japan. We have a commitment</p>
<p>   to build on a strong health system which for all the criticisms it receives</p>
<p>   is better than the health system in virtually any other country in the world.</p>
<p>   And we've made major improvements and reforms in recent years to income</p>
<p>   support and retirement incomes policy.</p>
<p>  To prepare for this challenge I've established a ministerial reference group,</p>
<p>   chaired by the Minister for Aged Care to develop a national strategy for</p>
<p>   an ageing Australia. The development of that strategy is the Commonwealth</p>
<p>   Government's key policy response to the international year of older people.</p>
<p>   I've asked the ministerial reference group to focus on four themes. Firstly</p>
<p>   helping Australians to be independent in and provide for their latter years,</p>
<p>   world class care, attitudes, lifestyle and community support and healthy</p>
<p>   ageing. In the interest, not only of older Australians but indeed of the</p>
<p>   entire community, we need to develop policies that maximise the capacity</p>
<p>   of all to contribute to the community.</p>
<p>  In the time that I have been Prime Minister, I have sought to foster very</p>
<p>   much the notion of what I describe as a social coalition and that is a recognition</p>
<p>   that if we are to solve our challenges or our problems and to meet our challenges,</p>
<p>   we need to recognise that no one part of the community has all the wisdom,</p>
<p>   all the resources or all the capacity to meet those challenges or solve</p>
<p>   those problems alone.</p>
<p>  The Government, acting alone, can't solve problems, individuals acting on</p>
<p>   their own can't solve all of their problems. The great welfare organisations</p>
<p>   in our community play a strategic role but they need help and support and</p>
<p>   the business community, on its own of course, can't solve social problems.</p>
<p>  But if you get the four of them working together, if you get the Government</p>
<p>   providing income support, not withdrawing any of its services but continuing</p>
<p>   to provide the basic social security safety net, if you marshal the voluntary</p>
<p>   efforts and the commitment of individuals, if you not only rely on the goodwill</p>
<p>   but also the policy wisdom and advice of the great welfare organisations</p>
<p>   like Salvation Army and St Vincent De Paul and many others who do a magnificent</p>
<p>   job and if you also harness the more philanthropic sentiments of the business</p>
<p>   community then together as a coalition, there are very few social challenges</p>
<p>   that we can't, as a community, solve.</p>
<p>  What we've tried to do as a government is to encourage the development of</p>
<p>   that coalition. I announced a number of taxation changes for example last</p>
<p>   year that now make it a lot more attractive for wealthier people in the</p>
<p>   community to donate resources and donate money to worthy causes and that</p>
<p>   has already sparked a greater sense of philanthropy amongst some of the</p>
<p>   wealthier people within our society.</p>
<p>  What I have said in relation to that is that I am not so much seeking to</p>
<p>   encourage those who already give to give more but rather to encourage more</p>
<p>   who can afford to do so to give something.</p>
<p>  And if we can develop and build this notion of a social coalition, then</p>
<p>   I think we have a great capacity as a community in the years ahead to meet</p>
<p>   head-on and solve our challenges and our problems.</p>
<p>  May I, ladies and gentlemen, return to the theme I touched upon at the beginning</p>
<p>   and that is I'm here principally as Prime Minister of Australia to honour</p>
<p>   the contribution of those members of the aged cohort that this audience</p>
<p>   represents for its continuing contribution to the Australian community;</p>
<p>   to say that my Government is very sensitive to and conscious of your legitimate</p>
<p>   needs and requests; that you have given much to the Australian community;</p>
<p>   you continue to give much to the Australian community and the sense of security</p>
<p>   and stability and stable lifestyle that I know all of us seek is a very</p>
<p>   legitimate ask of a society to which you have made such a great contribution.</p>
<p>  I also speak as the leader of a government that has seen an era of economic</p>
<p>   stability, the like of which we have not had for a long time. Now we're</p>
<p>   not complacent about that, I learnt very early in my political life never</p>
<p>   to get complacent or self-satisfied, I'm not. As soon as you solve one problem,</p>
<p>   there is another one around the corner and political life, as in personal</p>
<p>   and business life, is always like that.</p>
<p>  But we have seen a very strong period of economic growth in Australia, it's</p>
<p>   not the only thing but it does make a contribution to one's capacity to</p>
<p>   do other things for the benefit of the community.</p>
<p>  Now I thank you for inviting me again. I thank your Association for its</p>
<p>   contribution. I wish you all well and I declare your Convention open.</p>
