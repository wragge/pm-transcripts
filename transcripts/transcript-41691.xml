    <content><![CDATA[<p>The upgraded Kangaroo Island airport will bring more tourists to South Australia and drive growth and investment in the local community as part of the Turnbull Government’s plan for a stronger economy.</p>
<p>We’re backing business to invest and create jobs and the completion of the $18 million upgrade is expected to attract 25,000 new tourists and boost the Kangaroo Island economy by $29.8 million annually.</p>
<p>The upgraded airport will help extend Kangaroo Island’s tourism season and boost private sector investment.</p>
<p>This means more families spending more, investing more and driving more jobs and confidence in the local community.</p>
<p>The upgrade, jointly funded by the Turnbull Government and South Australian Government, will help increase the island’s exposure to new domestic and international tourism markets.</p>
<p>Both Governments have also agreed to assist Council in finalising the upgrade by providing an additional $2.5 million in total to help meet unexpected costs.</p>
<p>A range of works, including improvements to the existing runway, taxiways and lighting, has raised the airport’s airside facilities to International Air Transport Association (IATA) Class C standards.</p>
<p>These works enable the airport to provide direct air access to east coast markets, which will help increase the number of domestic and international tourists.</p>
<p>Airport security has also been improved with the addition of a new check-in area, a secure departure lounge and revamps of the passenger and baggage screening area.</p>
<p>Visitors to Kangaroo Island Airport will benefit from a range of new services including a new retail area, an arrivals lounge, car-hire offices, storage facilities and a pick-up and drop-off area with an electric vehicle charging point.</p>
<p>These improvements will provide visitors to Kangaroo Island Airport with quality amenities, and make visiting the island more attractive.</p>
<p>This project supported 20 jobs during construction and will help sustain another six ongoing local jobs.</p>
<p>The Turnbull Government is committed to building a strong regional Australia, with community grants programs investing directly in economic and social infrastructure improvements to create jobs and build stronger regional communities.</p>
