TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCE, CAULVIELD PARK, MELHOURNE,<br />
18 MARCH 1990<br />
E St 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: The Opposition's rejection of the MFP. Does<br />
that reflect a racist overtone?<br />
PM: Well, I think it's a very unfortunate development.<br />
This proposal has been on the table now for a couple of<br />
years. It's something that is about Australia's future.<br />
Australia has to have a future in which it has the best<br />
technology available to it. It is a tragedy that has<br />
been deliberately and opportunistically misrepresented by<br />
Mr Peacock as a Japanese enclave. Nothing could be<br />
further from the truth. We have had discussions of<br />
course, and close discussions, with our friends from<br />
Japan, but the intention is that we shall attract to<br />
Australia for Australia's future benefit, the best<br />
technology, not only from Japan, but from Europe and from<br />
the United States and that the great strength of well<br />
trained Australian work men and women should be harnessed<br />
with the best technology of the rest of the world. This<br />
is something which is essential for Australia's future<br />
and the lie, the absolute lie, for Hr Peacock's<br />
opportunism is established by the attitude of his New<br />
South Wales colleague, Premier Nick Greiner, who has said<br />
the basic concept is good. It offers Australia, said<br />
Nick Greiner, a chance to catch up, to accelerate our<br />
technology base. This is what it's about to ensure that<br />
we bring in the best from overseas, whether it be from<br />
Japan, Europe or the United states. This is what<br />
Australia needs for its future and in this last week, a<br />
man who was given the opportunity on the 29th September<br />
last year, will Bailey of the ANZ and all those<br />
assoc iated with the project, on the 29th September last<br />
year, offered Mr Peacock the opportunity of being fully<br />
briefed on the Multi Function Polis concept. He rejected<br />
that opportunity and now, just a few days from the poll,<br />
he has opportunistically and very dangerously<br />
misrepresented to the Australian community that this is a<br />
proposal for a Japanese enclave. Mr Peacock knows<br />
better. He knows that he is talking dangerous nonsense<br />
and 10m indebted to Premier Nick Greiner for his<br />
repudiation of the opportunism of Mr Peacock.<br />
interestingly again, this is another issue on which you<br />
have a clear conflict between Hr Peacock, the </p>
<p>opportunist, and Mr Howard, who, within the last week or<br />
sot has indicated that this is a concept which should be<br />
fully explored. I believe that Mr Peacock's dangerous<br />
Opportunism, his adventurism, will be repudiated. He<br />
can't even, in the process of doing this, get his facto<br />
rigti, e ' tred o rye I believe, that this decision<br />
was finalised late on Friday when in fact the decision<br />
had been mades on Thursday and the fax had been sent<br />
around, the faxes had been sent around Australia. The<br />
man is a dangerous opportunist who fortunately, as I say,<br />
has been completely repudiated by his own Party.<br />
JOURNALIST: So Labor will definitely go ahead with it,<br />
Will it Mr Hawke?<br />
PM: What, what the Labor Government will do, as it has<br />
been doing in association with the business community of<br />
this country and with the States, will be to fully<br />
investigate this proposal to see what's the best way in<br />
which Australia can attract to this country the highest<br />
technology from overseas. And that will certainly<br />
include the beat technology from Japan.<br />
JOURNALIST; Mr Hawke, is there a racist element in Mr<br />
Peacock's decision?<br />
PM: would really have to ask Mr Peacock that. The<br />
facts are that he's had the opportunity right up until<br />
now, five days before the campaign, to address this<br />
issue. He had the opportunity of being fully briefed on<br />
it, on the 29th September last year. He repudiated that<br />
opportunity._ You're going to have to ask Mr Peacock why,<br />
in the very dying stages of this campaign, in his<br />
desperation, he has gone to this issue and, and has gone<br />
to it in a way which is a total misrepresentation. Why<br />
does he say this is a proposal to establish a Japanese<br />
enclave in Australia? What sort of vein in Australian<br />
politics is he, is he trying to tap with that lie?<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, is there an anti Japanese<br />
sentiment showing up in Labor's research?<br />
PM: Well, it's not a question of, of Labor's research.<br />
If you, any research you will do you will find that there<br />
will be some people in Australia who have an anti<br />
Japanese sentiment. What leadership is about, what<br />
leadership requires in this country is to look to<br />
Austkalia's future. If there's one thing that is<br />
essential for Australia's future, for the future of these<br />
kids, it is that we attract the beat technology in this<br />
country to harness to an increasingly well trained<br />
Australian workforce. Unless we get the best technology,<br />
then we will not be able to compete overseas and for any<br />
political leader to look at some research and, and see<br />
that he sees some sort of sentiment like that somewhere<br />
and deliberately misrepresent this as a proposal for a<br />
Japanese enclave, i mean, he's trying, he is trying to<br />
tap into, he's trying to tap into the worst elements that </p>
<p>3<br />
there must be in, in Australian thinking and it's, it' 5 a<br />
desperate abuse of the obligations of political<br />
leadership.<br />
JOURNALIST: Have the Japanese voiced their concerns to<br />
you yet?<br />
PM: No, there's been no concern expressed to me and they<br />
don't need to. I mean, what I'm about, as I have been<br />
for seven years is to embrace proposals and thinking<br />
which is calculated to make Australia a more competitive<br />
country. In this country we have got to get the best<br />
technology we possibly can if that's from Japan, it's<br />
from Japan, if it's from the United States, it's from the<br />
United States. We've got to bring the bost technology<br />
here and if we can establish some sort of centre in which<br />
the best technology from Japan, from the United States<br />
and from Europe, can be brought in to combine with the,<br />
the abilities and the increasing abilities of Australian<br />
workers, that's what's absolutely essential for this<br />
country's future and to think that five days before an<br />
election you could have this gross misrepresentation by a<br />
man who would be Prime minister of this country defies<br />
belief. it is no wonder that Premier Greiner has<br />
repudiated him, it is no wonder that Mr Howard has<br />
repudiated him. I mean, these people will not play the<br />
politics of opportunism and gamble Australia's future for<br />
this desperate short-term opportunism of Hr Peacock.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, the Treasurer's talking about<br />
falls in interest rates to be in the first week or two<br />
weeks after the election. Is that reasonable?<br />
PM Well, I've said much the same thing myself. I mean,<br />
it's a case where, quite clearly, you've got every<br />
economic commentator in this country saying that the<br />
conditions that have been set in place by this Government<br />
will produce a fall in interest rates after the election<br />
as against the alternative because if the, if the<br />
Peacock mob were to get in you'd have a wages explosion<br />
and a dissolution of the budget surplus calculated to in<br />
fact blow interest rates through the roof. There's no<br />
doubt what the, what the<br />
JOURNALIST; Mr Hawke, are you worried that there'll<br />
be a squeeze on credit?<br />
PH: If, that if interest rates fall there'll be a<br />
squeeze on credit? No,-Ifm certainly not. I mean,<br />
obviously if interest rates fall, credit will be easier.<br />
JOURNALIST: But, but with Keating's timetable, do you<br />
agree with that, the two weeks?<br />
PM: I've just answered that question. I said I've said<br />
much the same thing myself. But one thing that's very<br />
interesting too, that hasn't been mentioned in the<br />
developing Peacock desperation of the last week is now </p>
<p>4<br />
that, in the area of tax, he's flip flopping in the area<br />
of tax as to whether in fact the creation of the two<br />
tiered tax scale that ha's promised within the life of<br />
his government will be financed out of bracket creep or<br />
not. Well that's an interesting question as to whether<br />
hats going to further blow out the budget in that way,<br />
but the most interesting thing about the Peacock proposal<br />
for a two tiered system is this and I would suggest<br />
that every member of the Australian public ought to think<br />
very, very clearly about this what Mr Peacock is<br />
proposing in his two tiered tax scale is that he, as<br />
Prime Minister, Would get a tax cut of over $ 100 a week<br />
held give himself a tax cut of over $ 100 a week but for<br />
you, the ordinary Australian on average weekly earnings,<br />
he'd give you a cut of $ 4.73 a week. $ 4.73 a week for<br />
the ordinary taxpayer and give himself a tax cut of more<br />
than $ 100 a week. That's the concept of Peacock about<br />
equity in taxation and it's something which should be<br />
absolutely repugnant to every reasonable Australian. OK?<br />
Thank you very much.<br />
