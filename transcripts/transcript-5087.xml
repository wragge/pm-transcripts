P'RESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT THURSDAY, 28 JUNE 1979<br />
PRIME MINISTER AND MR. VINER INTERVIEWED: FOLLOWING PREMIER'S<br />
CONFERENCE MEETING<br />
Prime Minister<br />
We haven't got onto financial matters yet, but we have had a<br />
very good discussion this morning on a range of subjects of<br />
great importance to the Commonwealth and to the States. We spent<br />
a good time discussing the energy statement and the policy documnent<br />
that was issued yesterday. The States and the Commonwealth will<br />
be co-operating very fully on a very wide range of energy mntatters<br />
and establishing special liaison arrangements to make sure that<br />
we all, as actively as possible, are pursuing the policies thatwill<br />
best look after Australia's own energy position.<br />
There are a wide range of matters involved conservation, the<br />
alternative uses of energy. There was a particular appreciation<br />
expressed for the decisions the. Commonwealth has made that will<br />
link up the Bass Strait and Cooper Basin gas fields through Wagga<br />
initially, and then from Wagga to Albury.<br />
In addition, the Commonwealth policy of purcashing gas-fired cars<br />
in future I think is probably likely to be followed by the States.<br />
I was also very glad to see that all the States, where it is<br />
relevant, have indicated that they are prepared to re-examine the<br />
lead content rules and -the emission rules in relation to the third<br />
stage of 27A. Because while one or two Premiers have their problers<br />
in relation to that, -they also recognise that it is within our<br />
capacity by administrative means, to save up to 10 percent of the<br />
fuel that would otherwise be used by Australian motorists.<br />
Against the background of Australia's own fuel position, and againsthe<br />
background of the world supply situation, that 10 percent could11<br />
be a very large amount of fuel.<br />
The Commonwealth will be pursuing with individual States one or<br />
two matters of great importance. In particular with Queensland<br />
the development of the Rundle shale oil deposits. There is the<br />
possibility there of developing processes that will provide as<br />
much fuel oil to Australia as is available from Bass Strait. That's<br />
one of the prospects. Quite clearly there will be a massive<br />
development and the sooner that can begin, the better it will be.<br />
We will be having discussions with the Queensland Government to see<br />
if that matter can be processed more quickly than would otherwise<br />
be the case. / 2 </p>

Prime Minis-ter ( continued)<br />
We also had a very productive discussion on industrial relations<br />
and Ian Viner will say something about that. Contrary to some of<br />
the speculation, and contrary to one or two reported comments over<br />
the-last few days, there is a very ready co-operation with the<br />
Premiers and the Commonwealth to discuss and analyse this particular<br />
matter. Question referral of powers?<br />
Mr. Viner<br />
What all the Premiers have agreed to is that the Ministers for Labour<br />
and the Attorneys-General should look at whether or not there are<br />
any fundamental changes necessary to the industr ial laws of Australia.<br />
The question of referral of powers will be one matter that will be<br />
looked at, but only one of a whole range of things. I think the<br />
Premiers recognise that there are signs of a breakdown of our<br />
industrial relations system in Australia, with troubles in Western<br />
Australia, in N. S. W. in particular, and there are a number of other<br />
widespread stoppages and disputes going on at the present time.<br />
The important thing is that the Premiers recognise that we need to<br />
go back to fundamentals and have a l. ook at our whole industrial<br />
relations system.--both as to law and also as to attitudes; what<br />
are our attitudes towards industrial relations in Australia? That<br />
will involve consultation with the ACT., with employer groups the<br />
Confederation of Australian Industry and of course, with all the<br />
States. We have also agreed that the Ministers and the Attorneys-General<br />
should be in a position to report back to a Premiers Conference later<br />
in the year, by the end of the year.<br />
Question Was there any mention of referral of powers this morning? Did you<br />
sound the States out on that issue?<br />
Mr. Viner-<br />
It was discussed. The question was raised. obviously, some of the<br />
States have misgivings about a referral of power, but none of the<br />
States refused to consider that as a possibility, but as I have said,<br />
as only one part of the examaination of the fundamentals of the system.<br />
Question None of them said it wasn't on?<br />
Mr. Viner<br />
Well, it was only mentioned by some of the Premiers and as part of:<br />
a general package of the sort of thing -that we ought to look at.<br />
We didn't ask them whether -they agreed or didn't agree. / 3 </p>
<p>3<br />
Question<br />
Would you like to see tougher penal sanctions against strikers?<br />
Mr. Viner<br />
That wasn't raised this morning.<br />
Question When will you be getting down to the Loans Council and the real<br />
business of money?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Fairly shortly. But these other things are important. They shoulin't<br />
be regarded as unreal business. 000---</p>
