    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Rudd Government today took the first steps towards fulfilling its commitment to bring 7,750 extra nurses into Australia's hospitals within five years.</p>
<p>This ambitious recruitment plan includes a target of bringing 1,000 nurses back into the hospital workforce by the end of this year.</p>
<p>The Rudd Government will today write to state and territory governments and private hospital sector representatives to outline administrative arrangements for this plan.</p>
<p>The Rudd Government will provide financial incentives to nurses who are out of the workforce to return to work.</p>
<p>These incentives are part of an $87 million plan to boost the number of nurses in our health and aged care system by more than 10,000 over the next 5 years.</p>
<p>There are approximately 30,000 qualified nurses in Australia who are currently outside the nursing workforce. The Rudd Government's plan is to bring many of these nurses back into Australian hospitals.</p>
<p>Under the Rudd Government's plan:  </p>
<p>     * cash bonuses of $6,000 will be available to nurses who have been out of the health workforce for more than a year to return to our hospitals;</p>
<p>     * these nurses will be paid $3,000 after six months back on the hospital ward and a further $3,000 after 18 months; and </p>
<p>     * hospitals will receive a contribution of $1,000 per re-entry nurse to assist with the costs of re-training and re-skilling.</p>
<p>The Rudd Government's plan will complement nursing re-entry and refresher programs offered by many state and territory governments.</p>
<p>The Rudd Government's nursing policy is designed to benefit public hospitals straight away. It will provide almost 8,000 extra nurses for Australia's hospitals over the next five years.</p>
<p>The Government is committed to a similar scheme for encouraging nurses to return to work in residential aged care facilities.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth Government also announced $150 million for improving elective surgery performance at Australia's public hospitals this week.</p>
<p>The Rudd Government is committed to working with State and Territory Governments to find solutions to the problems facing Australia's hospitals.</p>
