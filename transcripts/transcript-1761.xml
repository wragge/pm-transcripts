FOR PRESS: AR~ P. M. No. 10/ 1968<br />
POSTAL DISPUTE: UNION'S CONDITIONS UNACCEPTABLE<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Senator John Gorton<br />
At approximately 9 p. m. tonight the Government<br />
received a telegram from the Executive of the A. IP. W. U. stating that<br />
the Executive would instruct its members to resume normal work<br />
but only if the Government would agree to four conditions.<br />
The first condition is that the mail driver previously<br />
dismissed should be reinstated and this has been agreed by the<br />
Government days ago.<br />
The second condition is that immediately after the<br />
resumption of normal work the Public Service Board would hold<br />
a conference with the Union on their pay claims and the Union<br />
has already been told that this would happen.<br />
The third and fourth conditions were that the Public<br />
Service Board would give a decision before the conference<br />
concluded and that if their decision was unacceptable to the<br />
Union the Government should direct that the matter be referred<br />
to the Conciliation and Arbitration Comm~ issioner.<br />
No Government could accept dictation that the Public<br />
Service Board be directed to give a decision before the conclusion<br />
of a conference on pay claims although we have given an undertaking<br />
that there will be no deliberate or undue delay in reaching a<br />
decision. Nor could any Government accept the proposition that<br />
existing legislation be ignored and that the dispute should<br />
bypass the properly constituted authority namely the Public<br />
Serv-ice Arbitrator and go direct to the Conciliation and<br />
Arbitration Comirission.<br />
If the Union is dissatisfied with the Board's decision<br />
the matter should go, in accordance with existing legislation,<br />
to the Public Service Arbitrator after which the full process of<br />
arbitration becomes available.<br />
The Government hopes that the Union will adopt this<br />
course, which has always been and remains open to it.<br />
But in the meantime the mails must begin to move and<br />
the Postmaster-General and th6 Minister for Labour and National<br />
Service, who are handling this dispute, will take whatever steps<br />
are necessary to this end.<br />
CANBERRA 18th January, 1968. </p>
