    <content><![CDATA[<p>
Sydney in the year 2000 was an unlikely setting for a modern-day fairytale.</p>
<p>A beautiful young woman meets a handsome prince, and they live happily ever after.</p>
<p>Of course, there were no carriages or castles.</p>
<p>This was a distinctly 21st century romance:</p>
<p>Meeting amid the lights of a big city.</p>
<p>Exchanging thoughts by email.</p>
<p>And flying back and forth in jumbo jets.</p>
<p>In any case, fairy tales exist only in story books.</p>
<p>Because royalty in these democratic times means hard work.</p>
<p>The choice made by Mary Donaldson  -  like that of her contemporary Catherine Middleton  -  was bold and perceptive.</p>
<p>You knew that in marrying an heir to the throne, you had embarked on a journey of service.</p>
<p>A journey that would last your whole life.</p>
<p>As Australians, we know this from the life of our own Queen, as Danes do from yours.</p>
<p>It is a commitment to duty and leadership.</p>
<p>A commitment that has brought you here among us today.</p>
<p>And so I welcome Your Royal Highnesses as representatives of the Danish nation.</p>
<p>A nation known throughout the world for its values and humanitarian commitment.</p>
<p>A nation that leads the world in policies so crucial for our times like clean energy, urban development and food security.</p>
<p>Concerns you have come to explore with a receptive partner in dialogue this week.</p>
<p>Indeed, I welcome Denmark's commitment to reduce carbon emissions through a carbon price by 40 percent by 2020 and boost the share of renewable to 50 percent of energy consumption.</p>
<p>I know that as Australia undertakes its journey towards a low carbon future, we have a great partner in Denmark.</p>
<p>We are strengthened by your example and your expertise.</p>
<p>It is a partnership that extends beyond governments to the private sector.</p>
<p>And I am delighted that Crown Prince Frederick will journey on Friday to Macarthur in Western Victoria where Danish company Vestas and Australia's Leighton Holdings are building a wind farm, the biggest in the Southern Hemisphere, and another down-payment on our obligation to protect this planet for future generations and build the jobs and industries of tomorrow.</p>
<p>But friends, This could never simply be an official visit based on policy discussions, however worthy they may be.</p>
<p>It is a homecoming.</p>
<p>A return.</p>
<p>A return to the place that will always, with Denmark, be high in your loyalty and love.</p>
<p>For Crown Princess Mary, I know you want your own children to know something of the places that shaped your own upbringing and circumstances.</p>
<p>For Crown Prince Frederick, I know you seek to deepen your understanding of this land which has so unexpectedly become a part of your own life story.</p>
<p>For both of you, and for your children, Australia will always be your other home.</p>
<p>Where you will always feel that sense of warmth and comfort so aptly described in Danish culture as hygge.</p>
<p>Where family and friends await you.</p>
<p>Where formality is never required.</p>
<p>Where our door is always open and you never need to knock.</p>
<p>We are indeed delighted to have you as guests  -  so uniquely connected as you are to this land and its people.</p>
<p>You Royal Highnesses are welcome.</p>
<p>Honoured.</p>
<p>And very much at home.</p>
