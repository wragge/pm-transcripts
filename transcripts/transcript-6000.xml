,,, AUS AL
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA WEDNESDAY, 26 JANUARY 1983<br />
CITIZENSHIP WEEK<br />
The Government strongly believes that more should be done to<br />
promote a greater sense of Australian national identity and<br />
citizenship. As a result, the Government is proposing that<br />
a Citizenship Week should be celebrated every year beginning<br />
on 26 January 1984.<br />
A Citizenship Week will provide an opportunity for national<br />
organisations and community groups to conduct activities which<br />
emphasise our national identity and what it means to be an<br />
Australian. This will help us all to reflect on the rights,<br />
duties, privileges and responsibilities we share as Australian<br />
citizens. I hope it will also encourage eligible residents<br />
to apply for the legal status of Australian citizenship to<br />
enable them to become fully participating members of our society.<br />
Citizenship Week will begin in 1984 and I hope that community<br />
groups in particular will give thought to the sort of activities<br />
which would draw out our commonality of interests and national<br />
identity while at the same time recognising the rich<br />
contribution our multicultural heritage makes to Australian<br />
society. </p>
