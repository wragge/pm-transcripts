TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCE, PADDLES SHOE FACTORY.<br />
SEBASTOPOL, BALLARAT 8 JUNE 1989<br />
R a oE-PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: 58,000 more people in Jobs. That's good new.<br />
obviously for those people out there, but is the economy<br />
going too fast still Prime Minister?<br />
SPM: It's on. of the Indications of an economy going very<br />
Wstrongly. That brings It up now to the best part of a<br />
million and a halt new jobs in this period and a<br />
participation rate also at the highest level ever recorded.<br />
So there are signs of an economy which is still operating<br />
strongly. There are some other indications of course in the<br />
housing area and so on which suggest that we are beginning to<br />
see the signs of a slow-down which has got to come.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, if the economy Is still running<br />
strongly, does that mean Interest rate. have peaked?<br />
PM: As I've said, I don't see any need for them to go<br />
higher and I certainly hope that that's the case because I've<br />
had the opportunity as I go around now of actually listening<br />
to the stories of people who have been affected. I took the<br />
opportunity at lunchtime today of just going to a private<br />
home, a very modest home. The people there, It wasn't only<br />
the one family but friends of theirs and I just * at down and<br />
O had lunch with them and listened to them. There's no doubt<br />
that the Interest rates are hurting and I don't like seeing<br />
that. But as I explained to them, and I think they<br />
understand, that we've just got to hold on for a while until<br />
we get this level of activity down. I just hope that we're<br />
going to see that before too long.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, do you think It would be a bit<br />
of a shame if the money markets simply see good employment<br />
figures as an Indicator on interest rates or other elements<br />
of the economy without seeing it as the social victory that<br />
It Is? </p>
<p>PM: I do hope that not only the commentators but the<br />
community generally will understand the evidence that this<br />
of providing the best possible means of protecting people. I<br />
mean the best protection for people In an economy Is that<br />
they have a job. It truly Is remarkable the rate of job<br />
creation that has taken place. As I say, it's now one and a<br />
half million jobs rounded off in this period of six years and<br />
it means that that's one and a half million of our fellow<br />
Australians who are in work that weren't there before, it<br />
gives them the capacity to earn an income to look after<br />
themselves so that they are not dependent upon the community.<br />
But unfortunately, as in economics generally, there's usually<br />
a down side. The down side Is that, as far as It is an<br />
Indication, It means that the economy is operating that<br />
strongly that it's going to be continuing on that indicator<br />
to bring In Imports at an unsustainable level. But as I say,<br />
it's one of a number of indicators, and I think It you take<br />
them all together I think we are starting to see the signs of<br />
a levelling off. I certainly hope so.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, Senators Ray and Richardson say<br />
that-privatisation will not get through either the NSW branch<br />
of the Labor Party or the Victorian branch. Where does that<br />
leave the issue?<br />
PM: It wasn't suggested that at this coming conference it<br />
was going to get through. It wasn't on the agenda to get<br />
through. That's an Irrelevance.<br />
JOURNALIST: But they're also suggesting that It won't be<br />
possible they think to change policy before the election.<br />
PM: That's a report I saw, it said It in there. They<br />
thought It wouldn't be possible In the next few months.<br />
There's really no story to be beat up here very much. The<br />
processes In the Party will go on and they're not processes<br />
which involve state conferences, they are processes which<br />
Involve the committee which is established by the national<br />
conference. I think fairly sensible discussions will go on<br />
In the weeks and months ahead.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you still hope the processes will be<br />
finalised before the election?<br />
PM; I'd like to see that happen, I'd lilke to see that<br />
happen. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, isn't there a risk involved in you<br />
saying that you don't think Interest rates will go up any<br />
higher? PH-. I said, If you listened to what I said, I said I don't<br />
think there's any need for that to happen and I say that in<br />
light of the situation that's confronting us. But I'm not<br />
saying anything more than that because you've got to see the<br />
way In which the economy develops. You would think and hope,<br />
as I say, that the level of interest rates that exist now,<br />
together with the other tight arms of policy of wages and<br />
budgetary policy, one would hope that In combination that<br />
will be enough to bring the economy back.<br />
O JOURNALIST: Do you think it's possible for the Government to<br />
keep employment growing at some sort of reasonable rate and<br />
still get cutbacks in the areas that you want so that there<br />
Is not that kind of consumption? Is that the juggling act do<br />
you think that you can perform?<br />
PM: It's not a juggling act. What I've said before is that<br />
you've got to bring back the level of activity in a way which<br />
doesn't put the economy into recession. keeps enough growth<br />
to keep employment growing but not at the rate at which It Is<br />
growing. See, as I say, you've got the participation rate at<br />
the highest level ever. If you had a participation rate now<br />
that existed when we came to office you'd have the<br />
unemployment rate in the order of two to three per cent and<br />
that's the measure of how we're going back toward. a full<br />
employment economy. You don't need the rate of growth and<br />
employment growth that we've got now to be able to take up<br />
some of the people that are coming onto the market. I think,<br />
as I say, we can handle things In a way which will give us a<br />
soft landing. That is, a dropping back in activity but still<br />
at a level which Involves growth, economic growth and<br />
employment growth. I think we can do that.<br />
JOURNALIST; Have you had an update of the situation in<br />
China? PM: I've been speaking during the day to the office, I<br />
haven't spoken In the last two or three hours, but when I<br />
last spoke there wasn't anything new to report. They were<br />
still in that state of uncertainty. They are not prepared,<br />
our Embassy there is not prepared to say at this stage this<br />
is a few hours ago they're not prepared to say that they<br />
have firm evidence which would sustain the proposition that<br />
there was serious, substantial fighting between different </p>
<p>4.<br />
umits of the army there. There's been some skirmishing but<br />
not yet enough to say that you've got that type of civil war<br />
situation an your hands. So it's still gravely disturbing<br />
and we will keep our people there so that we can be reported<br />
to about what's happening. I keep expressing the hope that<br />
there will not be the insanity on the part of those who seem<br />
to be in power at the moment of getting rid of those in whose<br />
persons Ilies the future hope for China.<br />
ends </p>
