    <content><![CDATA[<p>During the forthcoming visit of The Queen and The Duke of Edinburgh the</p>
<p> Loyal Toast at Commonwealth functions will take the form of "The</p>
<p> Queen and the People of Australia".</p>
<p>This form of Toast has been used at functions at both Government House</p>
<p> and Parliament House for some time and its use during the forthcoming</p>
<p> visit has been settled after consultation with The Queen.</p>
<p>Both the National Anthem "Advance Australia Fair" and the Royal</p>
<p> Anthem "God Save The Queen" will be used during the visit, on</p>
<p> occasions when The Queen herself is present.</p>
<p>This is in accordance with the approach laid down during the Hawke government's</p>
<p> term back in 1985 shortly after "Advance Australia Fair" was</p>
<p> proclaimed Australia's National Anthem.</p>
<p>Statements concerning these earlier arrangements are attached.</p>
