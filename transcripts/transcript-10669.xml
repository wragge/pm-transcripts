<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  ...(inaudible) after One Nation's success on the weekend?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, the Government's not going to abandon policies that are</p>
<p>   good for the future of Australians. There are certain things that</p>
<p>   need to be done to make Australia an even stronger, more secure,</p>
<p>   and safer country economically in a difficult Asian economic environment,</p>
<p>   and we don't intend to be knocked off that course, because</p>
<p>   if we hadn't have done the things we've done over the</p>
<p>   last two-and-a-quarter years, the Australian people would be poorer,</p>
<p>   they'd be more vulnerable and many of the people who feel vulnerable</p>
<p>   in the regional areas of Australia would in fact now be facing even</p>
<p>   more difficult times.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Will they need fine tuning, some of these policies?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  We need to pursue policies that strengthen Australia, and that is</p>
<p>   why we intend to maintain our reform agenda, and now I'm going</p>
<p>   off to the ABC, so if you'd excuse me please.</p>
<p>  ENDS</p>
