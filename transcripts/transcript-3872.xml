SPEECH NOTES FOR THE PRIME MINISTER AT THE OPENING OF<br />
MURWILLUMBAH CIVIC A ND CULTURAL CENTRE, 29 AUGUST, 1975,<br />
1. IT GIVES ME VERY GREAT PLEASURE TO BE WITH YOU<br />
TODAY FOR THE OPENING OF THIS MAGNIFICENT CIVIC AND CULTURAL*<br />
CENTRE FOR MURWILLUMBAH. IT'S MY SECOND VISIT To DOUG'. ANTHONY'S<br />
ELECTORATE IN TWO MONTHS, SO YOU COULD BE FORGIVEN FOR<br />
THINKING THERE'IS A NEW COALITION IN THE OFFING. WE ARE<br />
CERTAINLY UNITED IN OUR CONCERN FOR THE WELFARE AND PROGRESS<br />
OF COUNTRY REGIONS LIKE THIS NORTHERN RIVERS AREA OF<br />
NEW SOUTH WALES.<br />
2. WHEN I WAS IN LiSMORE EARLY IN JUNE FOR THE<br />
OPENING OF OZANAM VILLA HOSTEL FOR THE AGED, DOUG ANTHONY<br />
TOLD ME THAT THIS CENTRE IN MURWILLUMBAH WAS CLOSE TO<br />
COMPLETION AND THAT I REALLY SHOULD ACCEPT ANY INVITATION<br />
TO COME AND SEE IT FOR MYSELF. IAM DELIGHTED TO OBSERVE<br />
THAT THE RIGHT HONOURABLE MEMBER FOR RICHMOND DIDN'T<br />
EXAGGERATE ITS VIRTUES. </p>
<p>0<br />

3. MIND YOU1 I HAVE A SNEAKING SUSPICION THAT HE<br />
WANTED ME TO NOTE THE PROGRESS WHICH HAD BEEN MADE AND THE<br />
SPENDID RESULTS ACHIEVED BY THE TWEED SHIRE COUNCIL IN<br />
SUCH A SHORT TIMES BELIEVE THAT THE ARCHITECT WAS APPOINTED<br />
IN' 1973 AND TODAY WE HAVE THIS SUPERB COMPLEX SO ATTUNED<br />
TO THE NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY OF MURWILLUMBAH AND SO<br />
COMPLEMENTARY TO THE TWEED HEADS CIVIC AND CULTURAL CENTRE<br />
OPENED A FEW MONTHS AGO,<br />
4. THE DEBATE -NON-PARTY, OF COURSE -ON A NEW AND<br />
PERMANENT PARLIAMENT HOUSE IN CANBERRA HAS TAKEN MUCH LONGER.<br />
MANY A FEDERAL PARLIAMENTARIAN WOULD HAVE TO SMILE WANLY<br />
ON READING ABOUT THE PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED BY LOCAL COUNCILLORS<br />
BEFORE THIS NEW EDIFICE CAME INTO BEING:<br />
" THE LARGEST SINGLE ENTERPRISE-IN THE SHIRE AND<br />
THE BIGGEST EMPLOYER OF LABOUR, NAMELY THE SHIRE COUNCIL,<br />
HAS CONDUCTED ITS BUSINESS IN A CHAMBER THAT IS NOISY AND<br />
ALMOST DEVOID OF COMFORT FOR THOSE WHO MAKE DECISIONS<br />
INVOLVING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS EVERY YEAR, AND WHICH AFFECT<br />
EVERY MAN, WOMAN AND CHILD IN THE DISTRICTS MOREOVER THE<br />
ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF, WHICH HAS INCREASED IN NUMBERS TCf<br />
MEET THE COMPLEXITY OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT IN A DEVELOPMENT<br />
AREA, HAS BEEN WORKING UNDER CONDITIONS WHICH MITIGATED AGAINST<br />
A HIGH STANDARD OF SERVICE," s''/ 3 </p>
<p>I THINK YOU SHOULD PREPARE FOR A LARGE INFLUX FROM<br />
CANBERRA AS NEWS OF THIS CENTRE GETS AROUND,<br />
BUT THE BEAUTY OF THIS CENTRE LIES NOT ONLY IN<br />
THE ELEGANCE OF THE FORMAL MEETING ROOMS AND THE EXCELLENCE<br />
OF THE FACILITIES PROVIDED FOR ELECTED COUNCILLORS AND<br />
COUNCIL OFFICERS IN DEALING WITH THEIR BUSINESS OF SERVING<br />
THE COMMUNITY, BUT ALSO IN THE BREADTH OF CULTURAL ACTIVITIES<br />
ENVISAGED IN THE TOTAL CONCEPT OF THE CENTRE.<br />
LIKE THE IPSWICH CIVIC CENTRE WHICH I HAD THE<br />
PLEASURE OF OPENING LAST MONTH, THIS CENTRE INCORPORATES A<br />
SPENDID AUDITORIUM SUITABLE FOR ALL KINDS OF MUSICAL OR<br />
THEATRICAL PERFORMANCES AND EXHIBITIONS, AND IS ABLE TO<br />
DOUBLE AS A VENUE SUITABLE FOR BALLS, CABARETS, SCHOOL<br />
DANCES AND THE LIKE, IN OTHER WORDS, THE WHOLE COMMUNITY<br />
WILL BE SERVED BY THIS CENTRE, THE LIFE OF THE WHOLE<br />
COMMUNITY, FROM SCHOOL CHILDREN TO ELDERLY CITIZENS, WILL<br />
BE IMPROVED THROUGH ACCESS TO THIS CENTRE.<br />
6. IT SPEAKS VOLUMES FOR THE INITIATIVE OF LOCAL<br />
GOVERNMENT BODIES THAT SO MANY OF THEM HAVE SEEN THE NEED<br />
TO CATER FOR CULTURAL PURSUITS WHEN PLANNING NEW CIVIC<br />
BUILDINGS. </p>
<p>SINCE LOCAL GOVERNMENT IS THE LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT<br />
CLOSEST TO THE PEOPLE, IT IS APPROPRIATE THAT THIS CULTURAL<br />
INITIATIVE SHOULD STEM FROM THIS GRASS ROOTS LEVEL.<br />
I CONGRATULATE PAST AND PRESENT COUNCILLORS AND<br />
THEIR ADVISERS ON THEIR VISION AND PERSISTENCE IN GETTING<br />
THIS PROJECT OFF THE GROUND. GENERATIONS OF MURWILLUMBAH<br />
RESIDENTS, NOT TO MENTION VISITORS, WILL HAVE CAUSE TO BE<br />
GRATEFUL TO YOU FOR GIVING THEM THE OPPORTUNITY OF DEVELOPING<br />
THEIR OWN TALENTS AND TO APPRECIATE THE TALENT OF OTHERS.<br />
7, I FEEL SURE THAT THE AUSTRALIA' COUNCIL, WHICH<br />
ADMINISTERS THE ARTS PROGRAMS OF THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT,<br />
WILL DO WHAT IT CAN TO HELP DEVELOP STANDARDS AND NURTURE<br />
TALENT IN THIS AREA. ALREADY A SUBSTANTIAL GRANT HAS BEEN<br />
MADE TO THE ART CENTRE IN MURWILLUMBAH FOR DEVELOPING<br />
PROGRAMS INVOLVING BOTH YOUNG PEOPLE AND ADULTS IN THE<br />
ARTS, WITH EMPHASIS ON SMALL GROUP ACTIVITIES IN LITERATURE,<br />
FILM AND DRAMA, AS WELL AS A SMALL ORCHESTRAL ENSEMBLE.<br />
ANOTHER GRANT WILL ENABLE THE CURIOUSLY TITLED YELLOW BRICK<br />
ROADSHOW TO TOUR THE NORTHERN RIVERS AREA, SO YOU CAN SEE<br />
THAT ALL TASTES ARE CATERED FOR. S, </p>
<p>8, IN THE END, HOWEVER, THE MOST IMPORTANT SINGLE<br />
ELEMENT OF THIS NEW CENTRE MAY PROVE TO BE THE NEW<br />
REGIONAL LIBRARY, WHOSE ESTABLISHMENT WILL FILL AN<br />
IMMENSE GAP IN THE CULTURAL LIFE OF MURWILLUMBAH FOR<br />
YOUNG AND OLD ALIKE,<br />
IT IS SOBERING TO REALISE THAT BEFORE THIS,<br />
MURWILLUMBAH NEVER HAD THE BENEFIT AND STIMULUS OF A<br />
FREE PUBLIC LIBRARY, DESPITE THE FACT THAT AS SEAT OF<br />
GOVERNMENT FOR THE TWEED SHIRE, IT WAS THE CENTRE OF THE<br />
MOST DENSELY POPULATED RURAL SHIRE IN AUSTRALIA, WHAT A<br />
SAD REFLECTION ON THE INEQUALITIES BETWEEN REGIONS WHICH<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT IS DETERMINED TO SEE RECTIFIED,<br />
I AM GLAD TO SAY THAT IN THIS, AS IN SO MANY<br />
OTHER QUALITY OF LIFE AREAS, THERE IS A BELATED RECOGNITION<br />
OF THE INJUSTICE INHERENT IN THOSE PREVIOUSLY ACCEPTED<br />
INEQUALITIES, ONLY LAST WEEKEND I OPENED THE BIENNIAL<br />
CONFERENCE OF THE LIBRARY ASSOCIATION OF AUSTRALIA, WHICH<br />
WAS BEING HELD IN MELBOURNE, AND THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL<br />
OF DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW LIBRARY SERVICES COULD BE BEST<br />
UTILISED IN RURAL AREAS IN ORDER TO REDRESS THIS OBVIOU.' J<br />
INJUSTICE, / 6<br />
L </p>
<p>-6-<br />
As I SAID IN MY SPEECH TO THAT CONFERENCE,<br />
" CERTAINLY THE TASK OF PROVIDING EFFICIENT PUBLIC LIBRARY<br />
SERVICES IS MUCH MORE DIFFICULT IN THINLY POPULATED<br />
RURAL AREAS THAN IT IS IN COMPACT CENTRES OF POPULATION<br />
IN CITIES AND TOWNS, BUT THERE IS NO REASON WHY THE<br />
CITIZENS OF MELBOURNE SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO BETTER<br />
LIBRARY SERVICES GREATER FREEDOM OF INFORMATION THAN<br />
THE CITIZENS OF ECHUCA OR GEELONG." I COULD AS EASILY<br />
HAVE SAID SYDNEY AND ORANGE OR MURWILLUMBAHI<br />
1 WENT ON TO SAY THAT THERE IS A LONG TERM NEED<br />
TO CO-ORDINATE AND RATIONALISE ALL LIBRARY SERVICES: AND<br />
THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE. THE RICHMOND TWEED<br />
REGIONAL LIBRARY WAS FORMED IN 197' 4 BY THE TWEED SHIRE<br />
COMBINING WITH LISMORE CITY AND BALLINA MUNICIPAL COUNCILS,<br />
THUS ENSURING THE CIRCULATION OF BOOKS BETWEEN LIBRARIES<br />
AT LiSMORE, BALLINA, TWEED HEADS, AND NOW MURWILLUMBAH.<br />
AND THAT HAS THE EFFECT OF VASTLY INCREASING YOUR INITIAL<br />
BOOK STOCK OF 8,000 VOLUMES TO BETTER SERVE ALL YOUR<br />
BORROWERS. IMPROVED SCHOOL LIBRARY SERVICES IN THE SHIRE<br />
WILL BE A FURTHER ADJUNCT TO THIS EXCITING DEVELOPMENT.,<br />
11. FINALLY I PAY TRIBUTE TO EVERYONE ASSOCIATED<br />
WITH THIS PROJECT, FROM THE TWEED SHIRE COUNCILLORS AND<br />
EMPLOYEES THROUGH TO THE ARCHITECT AND BUILDERS AND SUPPLIERS<br />
AND EVERYONE WHO HAS HAD A HAND IN THE PREPARATIONS FOR<br />
TODAY'IS OFFICIAL OPENING. IPAY PARTICULAR TRIBUTE TO THE<br />
CRAFTSMEN RESPONSIBLE FOR THE EXQUISITE TIMBER PANELLING<br />
AND COPPER INLAYS THAT ARE SUCH AN ATTRACTIVE FEATURE OF THE<br />
COUNCIL CHAMBER ITSELF. at17 </p>
<p>-7-<br />
IMUST SAY THAT WHEN JOHN GORTON ONCE ACCUSED<br />
ME OF SOUNDING LIKE A SHIRE PRESIDENT, THERE WERE THOSE WHO<br />
CHOSE TO CONSIDER IT AN INSULT. I CONSIDE-RED IT A<br />
COMPLIMENT AT THE TIME. AND I WOULD FIND IT A PRIVILEGE<br />
INDEED TO BE PRESIDENT OF THE TWEED SHIRE COUNCIL ON A<br />
DAY LIKE TODAY WITH THIS MAGNIFICENT PROJECT A REALI. TY.<br />
I HAVE VERY MUCH PLEASURE IN DECLARING OPEN<br />
THE MURWILLUMBAH CIVIC AND CULTURAL CENTRE. TO BORROW<br />
YOUR OWN WORDS " MAY IT SERVE THE CITIZENS OF THE TWEED<br />
SHIRE UNTIL WELL INTO THE 21ST CENTURY. MAY IT ENCOURAGE<br />
THEIR INVOLVEMENT IN CULTURAL PURSUITS AND ADD TO THEIR<br />
ENJOYMENT OF LIFE. cI I'<br />
