JOINT STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING,<br />
MP AND THE MINISTER ASSISTING THE PRIME MINISTER AND THE<br />
MINISTER FOR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, THE HON ROSS FREE,<br />
MP THE SEVENTH MEETING OF THE PRIME MINISTER'S SCIENCE AND<br />
ENGINEERING COUNCIL<br />
Thc Prime Minister's Science and Engineering Council met today for the seventh time.<br />
The Prime Minister chaired the meeting.<br />
Major items discussed by the Council were Science and Technology Opportunities and<br />
Strategies in the Asia Pacific Region, Nanotechnology and Microcrigineering, and<br />
Scheduled ( Intractable) Waste.<br />
The report, Science and Technology Opportunities and Strategies in the Asia Pacific<br />
Region, was developed by an independent working group consisting of senior people<br />
from industry and higher education bodies actively involved in extending our reach<br />
into the region.<br />
Presentations based on the report were made by Professor Stuart Harris, chair of the<br />
working group, and two othcr members of the group, Professor Stephen Hill,<br />
Wollongong University, and Mrs Judith King from the Australian Coalition of<br />
Services Industries.<br />
The paper found that Australia's-science and technology base is a source of<br />
comparative advantage. in the region, particularly when it is applied to provide<br />
practical solutions to Asian problems. In this regard, it noted the importance of the<br />
Government's decision to make the R&amp; D tax concession at 150% a permanent feature<br />
of Australia's tax regime. The opportunity for Australian exporters arc substantial and<br />
there have already been some notable successes ( eg Australian involvement in power<br />
-station and mining development in North Thailand).<br />
The report considers that there is a need for governments, academia and business to<br />
develop ail intcgratcd approach to Australian S&amp; T investment in the region and to<br />
enhance Australia's S&amp; T image.<br />
The Government's increased focus on Asia was welcomed and, as some speakers<br />
noted, has helped Australian businesses gain access and establish links into Asia.<br />

Nanotechnology was the subject of a presentation by Professor Don Nicklin, Pro-Vic<br />
-Chancellor ( Physical Sciences and Engineering), University of Queensland.<br />
Professor Nicklin chaired a working party established by the Australian Science and<br />
Technology Council ( ASTEC) to produce a report on nanotechnology as part of<br />
ASTECs work program. The working party consists of senior researchers from<br />
industry, government and higher education institutions engaged in examining the<br />
status and potential of this new technology in Australia.<br />
Nanotechnology is concerned with miniaturisation beyond the " micro" level, that is,<br />
the fabrication of devices with component sizes less than 100 nanometres ( a unit of<br />
length measuring one billionth of a metrc or a millionth of a millimetre). This is the<br />
same order as the diameter of molecules. Nanotechnology is considered to be generic<br />
to a wide range of industries: health care, separation technologies, mining and energy<br />
storage, as well as communications and optoclectronics.<br />
European countries, Japan, USA and Canada arc actively positioning themselves for<br />
the commercialisation phase. Japan, for example, has singled out nanotechnology as<br />
the focus of its push for world technology leadership in the 21st century. An<br />
opportunity exists for Australia to participate in these developments. Australia has<br />
expert capacity in govcmment and higher education laboratories to provide a basis for<br />
realising nanotechnology's potential importance to our competitiveness in areas such<br />
as mining, manufacturing and food processing.<br />
A prcscntation on microengineering was given by Professor Ian Bates, Associate Dean<br />
Rcscarch and Development, Faculty of Engineering at the Royal Melbourne Institute<br />
of Technology ( RMIT) and Dr Ron Zmood, Principal Lecturer, Electrical Engineering,<br />
Department of Electrical and Manufacturing Systems, RMIT.<br />
They said that during the next decade micromachines would become as commonplace<br />
in consumer products as the micro chip is now. Potential applications include<br />
improvements to existing technology in medical, industrial automotive and defcnce<br />
areas. Overscas, Japan, USA and Germany have large R&amp; D programs underway. In<br />
Australia, a number of companies, higher education and CSIRO researchers are<br />
working on microengineering fields. RMIT is collaborating with Japan. These<br />
capabilities can provide the basic resources to support the development of complete<br />
imicromachines for exploitation by Australian industry.<br />
Professor Ben Selinger, chair of the Independent Panel on Intractable Waste, and Dr<br />
Bruce Coniglio from ICI Australia, presented the findings of the recently released<br />
study on scheduled ( intractable) waste to the Council.<br />
Their focus was on developed and developing technologies for handling such wastes<br />
which could opcn market opportunities for Australia.<br />
