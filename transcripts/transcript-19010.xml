<p>[ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS OMITTED]</p>
<p>We're here to honour every finalist, everyone who is here. Some very excited people who are part of the Australian of the Year process.</p>
<p>You all should be very proud of yourselves and you are very welcome here.</p>
<p>And if you needed to explain to anyone what Australia is, what our self-image is, then perhaps the easiest way to do it would be to bring them to this room and to ask them to look around these faces as I am doing now.</p>
<p>Because by looking across this crowd, you are seeing the diversity of Australia, you are seeing the best of Australia.</p>
<p>People who have made contributions and who have been honoured for those contributions by their communities; people that their fellow Australians wanted to put forward to be acknowledged.</p>
<p>And certainly diversity is the word. We are looking at a crowd of people from representatives of our First Australians, to people who made Australia home during their lifetime.</p>
<p>We're talking about people who have had distinguished careers and can point to a lifetime of achievement, and people whose lifetime of achievement still lies in front of them.</p>
<p>We're talking about people who always go that extra yard to make a difference to their fellow Australians and their community and we want to acknowledge you for it.</p>
<p>So it is truly great to be able to welcome everybody here and to once again participate in the remarkable set of events that end up giving us the Australian of the Year, the Senior Australian of the Year, the Young Australian of the Year and our Local Hero.</p>
<p>Whenever I get the opportunity to go walking in Canberra  -  it's not all that often but sometimes I do get the opportunity  -  and one of the best places to walk is past the plinths on the edge of the lake that honour each Australian of the Year.</p>
<p>It tells you a story of our nation; it tells you about the many ways in which people can serve our nation.</p>
<p>Whether it's being in the military, being in the arts, being successful in business, being a philanthropist, being a scientist, being a farmer; the many ways in which people can contribute to our nation.</p>
<p>This year we are adding to that rich history.</p>
<p>So I'm very much looking forward to tonight's event followed by the concert.</p>
<p>I know that I will see you all there and that there will be a real air of excitement as we go into the final announcements of the Australian of the Year, the Senior Australian of the Year, the Young Australian of the Year and the Local Hero.</p>
<p>But one of the best things about this process is how it brings people together.</p>
<p>I was talking to Gilly before and one of the things that we remarked upon is that this really does create an esprit de corps between a very special group of Australians that endures as people leave these events and go back to their lives.</p>
<p>A very important thing for the future.</p>
<p>So it's with a real sense of welcome that we have you here for this morning tea.</p>
<p>Adam will say a few words too and then please feel free to just wander and enjoy.</p>
<p>That's what it's all for.</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>
