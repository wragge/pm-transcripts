After one of the closest elections in our nation's history followed by 17 days of negotiations, I know Australians are ready to see our Government get down to business.</p>
<p>I believe Australians want to see this Parliament get work done.</p>
<p>It's important to remember that the last minority government - the Curtin-Chifley Government in 1941 - went on to become arguably the greatest Government in the history of our Commonwealth.</p>
<p>In his ninth and last Budget Speech in 1949, Chifley called out to the nation as it stood at the threshold of the second half of the twentieth century, saying:</p>
<p>"We should not be afraid to set our goals high".</p>
<p>That is my appeal to the new Parliament as we embark on the first sitting.</p>
<p>Our goal is to improve the future of all Australians to make us a stronger, smarter, fairer nation.</p>
<p>It requires us to deliver changes that will improve the lives of Australians for years to come.</p>
<p>Changes like the National Broadband Network.</p>
<p>Changes like a new approach to regional development.</p>
<p>Changes like national health reform.....</p>
<p>...As well as the continuation of the education revolution, a continued focus on keeping people in jobs and the transition to a low carbon economy.</p>
<p>These changes are big and daunting.</p>
<p>They will require determination and persistence.</p>
<p>To succeed we will have to both consult and collaborate - to seek consensus and build new partnerships...</p>
<p>But I am optimistic.</p>
<p>I am confident that, led by Labor, this unique Parliament can deliver strong, stable and effective government that also delivers real change for all Australians.</p>
<p>I look forward to sharing our achievements with you.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
