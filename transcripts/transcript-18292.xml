Prime Minister Julia Gillard today welcomed President Karzai's announcement of the second tranche of provinces, cities and districts set to transition to the responsibility of Afghan-lead security forces.</p>
<p>When the transition of this second tranche is completed, Afghan national security forces will have lead security responsibility for around half of Afghanistan's population.</p>
<p>President Karzai's announcement underlines the progress made this year and shows the Afghan Government's goal of assuming lead responsibility for security across Afghanistan by the end of 2014 is on track.  </p>
<p>The timing for transition in Uruzgan Province, where Australia's training and mentoring efforts are concentrated, has not yet been decided.</p>
<p>Australia will continue to train and mentor the Fourth Brigade of the Afghan National Army in Uruzgan to ensure the province is well positioned to commence transition. </p>
