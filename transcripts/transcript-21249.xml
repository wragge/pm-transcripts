    <content><![CDATA[<p>  I am pleased to announce that the Australian Government';s wedding gift to His Royal Highness Crown Prince Frederik of Denmark and Miss Mary Donaldson will be a stand of Australian trees, evocative of the Australian landscape.  The gift has been selected in acknowledgment of their well-known love of the outdoors and also provides a unique and very long lasting link between the couple and Australia.  The Governor-General, His Excellency Major General Michael Jeffery, will present the Australian Government gift to the Royal couple at the dinner the Governor-General is hosting for them prior to the wedding.</p>
<p>The couple were involved in the selection of the trees and have chosen three each of the Australian natives Huon Pine, Snow Gum and Cider Gum - all of which grow in the cold climate area of Miss Donaldson's native Tasmania.</p>
<p>The trees were sourced from licensed Australian nurseries by the Australian National Botanical Gardens and have been in the nursery of the Fredensborg castle under the care of the Head Gardener since their arrival in Denmark last month.</p>
<p>I know all Australians will join me in expressing our best wishes to the Royal couple on the occasion of their marriage on 14 May in Copenhagen.</p>
