I PRIME MINISTER 0.*<br />
FOR MEDIA 9 July 1981<br />
UNEMPLOYMlENT FIGURES<br />
The preliminary estimates for unemployment during<br />
June, released today, are welcome evidence of continuing strong<br />
improvement in the employment situation.<br />
Taken with the results of the May labour force survey,<br />
released yesterday, they demonstrate a marked strengthening of the<br />
labor market, in line with economic activity.<br />
The Government can take a degree of satisfaction in<br />
achieving a sustained turnaround in employment in this country<br />
when, worldwide, job prospects are considerably less bright.<br />
Employment growth in Australia, some 2.2 per cent. in . the.<br />
12 months to the end of May this year, is currently running..<br />
double the rate of the OECD countries overall, and-the--continuedfall<br />
in unemployment in Australia contrasts with the trend of<br />
rising unemployment rates in these countries.<br />
This has happened because of the policies the Government<br />
has pursued to control inflation and to encourage the private sector<br />
to play a larger role in our economy, and so create more real and<br />
lasting jobs for Australians.<br />
I am particularly pleased that the fall in unemployment<br />
during June was spread across all States and major categories cf<br />
job-seekers, with significant improvements registered for young,<br />
people.<br />

the Rt. Hon. J. D. Anthony, M. P.) </p>
