SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE RT. HON. SIR<br />
ROBERT MENZIES, IN THE<br />
HOUSE'OF REPRESENTATIVES<br />
1ST OCTOBER, 1965.<br />
STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL<br />
19-5<br />
Mr. Speaker, I hope that I will be allowed to pay a<br />
short tribute of admiration to the Leader of the Opposition,<br />
Mr. Calwell, for the technical quality of the speech he has just<br />
delivered. How any man at half past nine in the morning could<br />
produce such a torrent of adjectives and old political jokes is<br />
beyond me. I think it is a wonderful performance but through<br />
it all I thouoht that I detected a slight note of hostility to<br />
my colleague the Minister for Labour and National Service, Mr.<br />
McMahon, and therefore perhaps I should begin by correcting the<br />
SLeader of the Opposition on that point.<br />
This Bill, the Stevedoring Industry Bill is the product<br />
) f very considerable close study in the Cabinet. It is not one<br />
man's frolic. It is a Bill Produced by this Government and<br />
supported by this Government,' and indeed, by honourable members<br />
who sit behind it. In the second place, I think it is only<br />
proper to add that the second reading speech delivered by my<br />
colleaoue, the Minister for Labour and National Service, was a<br />
masterly presentation not only of the narrative behind this<br />
Bill but of the quality of its provisions, and every word that<br />
he had to say about it certainly has my support and I believe<br />
has the support of every honourable member on this side of the<br />
House. Now, there is a very curious thing about this debate.<br />
Last night the spokesman for the Opposition devoted his time,<br />
very properly, because it is a large matter, not to attacking the<br />
trans er of the right of recruitment to the Stevedoring Industry<br />
Authority and away from the Waterside Workers Federation I<br />
could not detect that he said anything about that point that<br />
seems to go by silence, and he also said nothing about the rights<br />
of appeal or disciplinary procedures that I could detect; but<br />
ne came down as the Leader of the Opposition did this morning,<br />
entirely to Part III of the Bill. If anybody is to make any<br />
inference from this the inference is clear that the Labour Party<br />
in this House is taking its real exception to the derogistration<br />
proposals but is not propared ta argue against the merits of the<br />
other and major provisions of this egislation. Indeed, one can<br />
nnderstand why. I will come to that point in a moment.<br />
All the Labour Party does in this House, having<br />
concentrated its fire, a great deal of heat, and some abuse en<br />
Part III of the Bill is to come along with the old proposition<br />
that there ought to be nationalisation and until there is,<br />
nothing good will occur. There will never by industrial peace<br />
until there is nationalisation, it says.<br />
This is a new kind of unity ticket because that is<br />
exactly what the Communist Docker said to the Commonwealth<br />
Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, practically in these<br />
words. My colleague the Minister quoted what had been sai' by<br />
Docker. The Minister said that Docker told the Commission that<br />
if the Waterside Workers Federation / 2 </p>
<p>2.<br />
" would determn~ ine j-vract to secure its<br />
claims; and that even if all its industrial claims<br />
were granted frequent disputes could be expected<br />
until the inAustry was nationalised."<br />
As I understand it Docker now has the backing of the Leader of the<br />
Opposition for that proposition. This is indeed, as I have just<br />
said, a new sort of unity ticket.<br />
Now, Sir, how hollow this argument about nationalisation<br />
being the panacea is, obviously, to anybody with any experJrV,.<br />
of industrial problems, even as a spectator over a term of years.<br />
When did nationalisation of an industry eliminate strikes? We have<br />
seen them in Australia time after time, strikes in nationalised<br />
undertakin s. We have seen strikes in ships run by the Government<br />
Line, the ustralian National Line; and strikes in Sydney and<br />
Newcastle transpoit services. We had transport strikes in Victoria<br />
several times in the post-war period. There have been hold-ups<br />
in the New South Wales and Victorian power stations, troubles in<br />
our Post Office, and from time to time in Defence establishments.<br />
These are all nationalised. The experience in Australia is precisely the same as<br />
the experience in Great Britain because its experience has proved<br />
tlat'nationalisation does not stop strikes. Great Britain has had<br />
transport problems in nationalised industries time after time.<br />
So, Sir, let nobody run away with the idea that by nationalising<br />
an industry you usher in a period of industrial peace.<br />
Now Sir, the real issues in the Bill are plain<br />
enough, although the Oppositicn has sought to avoid several of<br />
them. Should the Waterside Workers Federation retain its monopoly<br />
right of recruitment? Just let us remember indeed everybody<br />
does that under the existing legislation this Federation has a<br />
position of privilege, descried just now by the Leader of the<br />
Opposition as a unique position. It has the sole right to recruit<br />
or nominate I do not care what word is used the selection of<br />
the person to be presented in the first instance is made by the<br />
SFederation. It has the richt of recruitment. I do not know of<br />
any other trade union that Has this right. There may be one<br />
somewhere, but this one stands out,<br />
Should the Federation retain this right? That is<br />
S the real and central question. There has been no serious attempt,<br />
in the face of the facts put before the House by the Minister,<br />
to say that the Federation should retain this right. It has yet<br />
to be said by the Opposition, if it is ever going to be said at all,<br />
that it wants the present state of privilege for the Federation to<br />
continue. Of course, on the merits as distinct from the question<br />
of debate between the two sides of the House, wel, " by their fruits<br />
ye shall know them". The Federation has had an industrial privilege.<br />
The privilege carries with it, surely, an industrial responsibility<br />
in an industry which is of great importance to the whole of the<br />
Australian economy, domestically and internationally. I will just<br />
take 3ne or two figures. They have been mentioned, but I recall<br />
the attention of the House to them.<br />
My colleague, whose fi-oures have not been seriously<br />
challenged, I think, drew attention to the grave fall in the average<br />
net gan. rates of work per hour. This is not something that can be<br />
lavuged off by saying that it has to do with machinery or with port<br />
equipment. This is the gang work per hour. You would expect it,<br />
in the course of time to be increasing, but as his figures show,<br />
there has been a stead decline. Was this unconscious? Was this<br />
unplanned, or was this'desired by the Communists who are the real<br />
directors of the Federation? </p>
<p>Mr. Curtin Get-off that. ( Interjection)<br />
SIR ROBERT MENZIES They are the real directors of the<br />
Federation. The honourable member would hardly deny that. All<br />
the facts that have been put before us provo it.<br />
Then, Sir take work stoppages. I want to emphasise<br />
these figures. Over the last ten years to June, 1965, in all<br />
in4ustry taking the whole mass of industrial occupation in<br />
Australia workers lost on the average less than two hours a<br />
year because of industrial disputes. This is a remarkable record.<br />
t demonstrates that amang other things, if we look at the whole<br />
of industry we find that tHe trade unions have been honouring the<br />
law have been availing themselves of the normal industrial rights<br />
that they have, and have been able to go to the Conciliation<br />
Commissisners or to the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration<br />
Commission itself freely and effectively. However, in the case of<br />
the Waterside Workers Federation, the union that has these<br />
tremendous and unique nrivileges, the loss has been 55 hours a<br />
year. That has been the loss as a result of industrial stoppages,<br />
not rain. Sir, these facts demonstrate absolutely and conclusively<br />
that the trade unions generally are recognisin the industrial<br />
laws. They are not under attack in this legislation. Indeed, it<br />
is part of this exercise that we should draw a contrast between<br />
the general body of unions and these people with this sorry record<br />
who have enjoyed a privileged position. In other words, we are<br />
considering a special case which is not to be confused with somp<br />
wild, whirling words about an attack on, or hostility towards the<br />
trade union movement. To suggest that we ar-attacking ths trade<br />
union movement is, of course, utter nonsense. We have made a<br />
selection and have demonstrated the reasons for making that<br />
selection. Those very reasons and the fact that we make a<br />
selection is the best evidence that trade unionism on the whole<br />
is perfectly safe. It has justified that position.<br />
When cne mentions the Communists, there is always a cry to<br />
the effect that some Red-baiting is going on. Does not everybody<br />
know that on the waterfront some of the peculiarities that have<br />
led to the results that I have been mentionin. are consciously<br />
fomented by Communist officials? Would anybody care to deny that?<br />
Is it not clear that the worst record is to be found in the two<br />
ports in which Communism is most active at the official level<br />
Sydney and Melbourne? The facts speak for themselves. This<br />
appears to be similar to what goes on in Great Britain. Some<br />
reference has been made to the Devlin report.<br />
The big transport workers union in England is the T. and<br />
G. the Transport and General Workers Union. It is one of the<br />
biggest unions in the whole of Great Britain. According to the<br />
DevIin report " The T. and G. is one of these unions which does not<br />
allow members of the Communist Party to hold any official<br />
position. Their experience is that the Communist official<br />
TTill subordinate the interests of the union to the party<br />
line."<br />
Later on the report had something tD say about a man called<br />
curiously enouh, Dash, who was an acknowled-ed Communist, being<br />
the leader of The Communist element, and who'had set up a liaison<br />
committee, bless you, in order to further his activities. The<br />
Devlin report continued / 4 </p>
<p>9 4-<br />
" There may be some in these unofficial organisations<br />
who are traitnrs in thought if not in deed. There<br />
may be others for whom tre docks , re only a convenient<br />
battlefield on which to wage class war; and others<br />
with a genuine concern for the welfare zf the industry<br />
but whose belief in some particular remedy for<br />
example, nationalisation is so fanatical that they<br />
would rather pull the whole industry down than<br />
compromise or tempoise."<br />
They are not my words; they are the words of the very distinguished<br />
Commission that was presided over by Lord Devlin, who has neerbeen<br />
accused of being a reactionary. I shall continue the quotation<br />
" There may be others who find any industrial agitation<br />
a satisfactory way of life, bringing personal influence<br />
and prestige and whose concern it is to make sure that<br />
there is always something to agitate about. All such<br />
men, whatever their motives, are wreckers."<br />
That is a pretty pungent statement. The whole clash, the whole<br />
conflict and this, I think, is all that I need say is between<br />
the Communist attitude on the waterfront, the Communist desire to<br />
disrupt, the Communist pride in having a record loss of manhours<br />
, n the waterfront, the Communist satisfacticn in holding up the<br />
industries of the country and increasing the costs of industries<br />
the conflict is between that and the Government of the country which,<br />
after all, is the elected Government of a free people. Who is<br />
to be in control of peace? Who is to be able, where necessary, to<br />
take steps to forward peace and continuity of wbrk in this vital<br />
industry, the Communist wreckers or the Government of the country?<br />
Therefore, I conclude by saying that the Communist<br />
Docker to whom I have made a reference before the advocate of<br />
the Federation summed up the whole positicn with singular<br />
lucidity. I have never denied the Communist leaders' talent.<br />
However misguided, they have great talent, and this is beautifully<br />
expressed. He says<br />
" There is no future in the Arbitration Commission so<br />
far as wages are concerned. Anyone who suggests we<br />
should arbitrate is either a fool or is misleading the<br />
workers."<br />
I repeat, this is the advocate for the Waterside Workers Federation.<br />
This is not some fellow going on a frolic of his own. This is<br />
their advocate, the man who represents them before the Commission.<br />
So I repeat what he says<br />
" There is no future in the Arbitration Ccmmission se<br />
far as wares are concerned. Anyone who sugaests we<br />
should arbitrate is either a fool or is misleading the<br />
workers. We are fighting the Government on these<br />
matters."<br />
That is the way he puts it. Very well. There is an official<br />
challenge on behalf of the Waterside Workers Federation. There is<br />
something, the authenticity of which cannot be denied, and as a<br />
challenge'we accept it, and we shall defeat it. </p>
