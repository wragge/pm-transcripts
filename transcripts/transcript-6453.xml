SPEECH BY THE PRIMIE MINISTER EMBARGOED AGAINST<br />
DELIVERY<br />
THE 10rN. HAWKE, f. P,<br />
UNIVERSITY OF THE SOU TH1 PACIFIC<br />
SUVA, 29 AUGUST, 19814<br />
OPENING OF THE TECHNOLOGY BUILDINGS<br />
I AM VERY PLEASED TO HAVE THIS OPPORTUNITY TODAY TO VISIT<br />
THE UNIVERSITY OF THE SOUTH PACIFIC, THE UNIVERSITY IS A<br />
STRIKING EXAMPLE OF THE POSITIVE BENEFITS WHICH CAN FLOW FROM<br />
COOPERATION BETWEEN THE NATIONS OF THE REGION,<br />
I AM PROUD THAT AUSTRALIA SHOULD BE AS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED AS<br />
IT IS WITH THIS IMPORTANT EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION, AND THAT WE<br />
HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CONTRIBUTE TO ITS DEVELOPMENT.<br />
AUSTRALIA HAS A GREAT AFFINITY WITH THE NATIONS OF THE SOUTH<br />
PACIFIC REGION. I'E ARE IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURS; WITH THESE<br />
COUNTRIES WE FEEL AT HOME, I'. E SHARE YOUR INTERESTS AND HAVE<br />
MANY ASPIRATIONS IN COMMON.<br />
l-E ALL, FOR EXAMPLE, HAVE A KEEN INTEREST IN THE MAINTENANCE OF<br />
CONDITIONS OF PEACE AND STABILITY WITHIN THE REGION, -HENCE<br />
THE PRIORITY WE ATTACH TO THE ACCEPTANCE OF THE REGION AS A<br />
NUCLEAR FREE ZONE.<br />
I'lE ARE ALSO COMMITTED TO THE REGION'S DEVELOPIMENT, AT ITS OWN<br />
PACE, AND WITH THE NEEDS AND INTERESTS OF ITS PEOPLE.<br />
1/ 2, </p>
<p>2.<br />
V.' E SEE IT AS BEING IN OUR OWN INTEREST AND THAT OF ALL<br />
COUiTR I ES WI THIN TiH REGION THAiT WE CONTI; IUE TO CONTRIBUTE<br />
WHAT WE CAN TO REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT, A HEALTHY, GROWING<br />
REGIONAL ECONOMY FOR AUSTRALIA AND ITS NEIGHBOURS IS THE<br />
BASIS ON WHICH OUR FUTURE DEPENDS.<br />
THE CURRENT DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAM AUSTRALIA HAS<br />
WITHIN THE REGION IS A VISIBLE DEMONSTRATION OF THE INTIMACY<br />
OF THE RELATIONSHIP THAT HAS GROWN UP BETWEEN AUSTRALIA AND<br />
THE COUNTRIES OF THE REGION. THE VERY CONSIDERABLE $ 300 MILLION<br />
WE HAVE COMMITTED THROUGH THAT PROGRAM IS THE OVERALL FIVE YEAR<br />
SUM FROM WHICH ARE DRAWN THE INDIVIDUAL COUNTRY COMMITMENTS,<br />
THE SPECIAL PROJECTS, THE TRAINING AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE<br />
PROGRAMS, AND THE SPECIAL FLEXIBLE ALLOCATIONS SUCH AS ACCOUNTABLE<br />
CASH GRANTS,<br />
THE CONTINUED FLEXIBILITY OF THE PROGRAM FLEXIBLE TO MEET<br />
THE REGION'S NEEDS IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT, THE SPECIAL<br />
CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE SOUTH PACIFIC REQUIRE IT, THE JACKSON<br />
COMMITTEE REPORT ON AUSTRALIA'S OVERSEAS AID PROGRAM MADE SOME<br />
USEFUL RECOMMENDATIONS IN THIS REGARD. FLEXIBILITY TO MEET<br />
THE REGION'S NEEDS IS SOMETHING WE PRIZE HIGHLY. </p>
<p>3,<br />
IN THIS SPIRIT MY GOVERNMENT HAS APPOINTED A TEAM OF<br />
PROFESSIONALS IN THE FIELD OF AGRICULTURE, ECONOM. ICS,<br />
EDUCATION AND EN GINERING TO WORK EXCLUSIVELY IN THE<br />
PACIFIC. THE TEAM WILL ENHANCE AUSTRALIA'S CAPACITY TO<br />
PLAN ASSISTANCE FOR KEY SECTORS, AS DESIGNATED BY THE<br />
REGION'S GOVERNMtENTS AND IN CONJUNCTION WIITH OUR AREAS OF<br />
EXPERTISE, AND TO-APPRAISE, MONITOR AND IMPLEMENT PROGRESS<br />
MORE EFFECTIVELY.<br />
W'E HAVE ALSO INITIATED A MULTI-COUNTRY PROGRAM, PROVIDING<br />
FUNDS FOR PROJECTS APPLICABLE TO MORE THAN ONE COUNTRY IN<br />
THE REGION. TO DATE 6 PROJECTS HAVE BEEN FUNDED UNDER<br />
THIS PROGRAM.<br />
SO FAR I HAVE SPOKEN ONLY OF DEVELOPMENT COOPERATION, THE<br />
CLOSENESS THAT HAS DEVELOPED BETWEEN AUSTRALIA AND THE SOUTH<br />
PACIFIC HAS A MUCH WIDER BASIS THAN THIS. IT FLOWS FROM AN<br />
UNDERSTANDING OF EACH OTHERS' ASPIRATIONS, INTERESTS AND<br />
SENSITIVITIES. AND THAT UNDERSTANDING GROWS FROM PERSONAL<br />
CONTACT AT ALL LEVELS FROM THE PRIME MINISTERIAL DISCUSSION<br />
TO THE TOURIST VISIT, AND ALL MEETINGS IN BETWEEN: ACADEMIC,<br />
JOURNALIST, BUSINESS, GOVERNMENT, CHURCH, SPORTING, STUDENT,<br />
I'E ARE ALL SO NEAR TO EACH OTHER NOW'ADAYS THE MEANS OF<br />
MODERN COIMMUNICATION AND TRANSPORT ENSURE IT. THE RELATIONSHIPS<br />
BETWEEN AUSTRALIA AND THE NATIONS OF THE SOUTH PACIFIC HAVE<br />
STOOD THE TEST OF THE CLOSEST CONTACT: AND WE ARE THE BETTER<br />
FOR, IT, </p>
<p>I WAS SPEAKING OF ACADEMIC AND STUDENT CONTACTS A MOiENT<br />
AGO; THE OVERSEAS STUDENT DEBATE IN AUSTRALIA HAS, I BELIEVE,<br />
BEEN A SUBJECT OF INTEREST IN EDUCATION CIRCLES EPRESENTED<br />
HERE TODAY,<br />
IN AUSTRALIA, A SMALL MINORITY HAVE QUERIED THE CONTINUED<br />
ACCESS OF STUDENTS FROM OUR REGION ASIA AND THE PACIFIC<br />
TO PLACES AT OUR UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES. W\ ITH SUCH A<br />
FINE FACILITY AS THE USP, THIS DOES NOT OF COURSE CONCERN<br />
THE SOUTH PACIFIC AS MUCH AS IT DOES SOME OF OUR OTHER NEIG'IBOURS,<br />
BUT THERE ARE STILL SUBSTANTIAL NUMBERS OF STUDENTS FROM THE<br />
REGION WHO ARE RELYING NOW ON PLACES AT AUSTRALIAN INSTITUTIONS;<br />
I HAVE NO REASON TO DOUBT THERE WILL BE SIMILAR NUMBERS OF<br />
STUDENTS IN THE FUTURE.<br />
RECOGNISING THIS, MY GOVERNMENT IS DETERMINED THAT AUSTRALIA<br />
SHOULD CONTINUE TO RESPOND TO THIS REGIONAL DEMAND. THIS<br />
COMMITMENT WILL BE MAINTAINED NO MATTER WHICH SYSTEM THAT<br />
RECOMMENDED BY PROFESSOR GOLDRING IN HIS STUDY, THAT OF THE<br />
JACKSON COMMITTEE, OR ANY OTHER APPROACH, MAY BE CHOSEN BY<br />
THE GOVERNMENT. DECISIONS ON THESE IMPORTANT MATTERS WiLL BE<br />
MADE IN THE NEAR FUTURE.<br />
ALL COUNTRIES, BOTH DEVELOPED AND DEVELOPING, FACE THE BURDEN<br />
OF THE HIGH COSTS OF EDUCATION. AUSTRALIA ACKNOWLEDGES THE<br />
NATIONAL ASPIRATIONS OF GOVERNMENTS IN THE REGION TO DEVELOP<br />
THEIR POST-SECONDARY INSTITUTIONS, OVER THE YEARS, WE HAVE<br />
PROVIDED SUBSTANTIAL ASSISTANCE TO REGIONAL COUNTRIES IN THE<br />
ESTABLISHM-ENT OF THOSE INSTITUTIONS, THROUGH CAPiTAl_ WORKS,<br />
THROUGH DEVELOPMENT OF TEACHER TRAINING AND TECHNICAL OR<br />
TRADE-RELATED PROGRAMS AND THROUGH THE PROVISION OF A RANGE OF<br />
SCHOLARSHIPS. </p>
<p>THE TASK FACING THE AUTHORITIES OF THE UNIVERSITY OF THE<br />
SOUTml P\ AC IFIC I; i CURR ICULUM LDEViELOP.; ENT, ASSEM.' LI NG TEACHING<br />
STAFF, FULFILLING THE DIFFERENT NEEDS AND REQUIREMENTS OF<br />
ELEVEN NATIONS IS IMMENSE. IT IS TO THE CREDIT OF THE UNIVERSITY<br />
AUTHORITIES THAT IT HAS MANAGED TO MEET DEMANDS PLACED UPON IT,<br />
IT DESERVES SUPPORT FROM THE REGION AND I WOULD LIKE TO ASSJRE<br />
YOU HERE THAT AUSTRALIA WILL REMAIN WILLING TO CONTINUE TO<br />
ASSIST THE UNIVERSITY IN MEETING THE PRIORITIES IDENTIFIED<br />
BY REGIONAL GOVERNMENTS.<br />
OUR COMMITMENT TO THE UNIVERSITY IS REFLECTED IN OUR LEVEL OF<br />
SUPPORT., WHICH HAS BEEN ESTIMATED TO AMOUNT TO $ 18 MILLION : IN<br />
THE FIVE YEAR PERIOD TO JUNE 1988, AUSTRALIA IS THE LARGEST<br />
DONOR TO THE USP AND IN 1983/ 811 PROVIDED $ 2.62M FOR STAFFING<br />
ASSISTANCE, ACADEMIC DEVELOPMENT, PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT, CAMPUS<br />
UPGRADING, PHYSICAL PLANNING AND CAPITAL WORKS.<br />
THIS TECHNOLOGY BUILDINGS COMPLEX, WHICH I AM HONOURED TO<br />
OPEN TODAY, PROVIDES A NEW HOME FOR THE DISCIPLINE OF<br />
INDUSTRIAL ARTS IN THE SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, HERE TEACHERS<br />
WILL BE TRAINED, SO THAT IN TURN THEY CAN GO OUT INTO THE<br />
LOCAL CLASSROOMS OF THE REGION AND PASS ON THE SKILLS OF<br />
WORKING WITH WOOD, METAL, AND THE ARTS AND SCIENCE OF DRAUGHTING,<br />
RURAL TECHNOLOGY AND ASSOCIATED FIELDS. THEY WILL BE WELL<br />
EQUIPPED TO TEACH IN BOTH SECONDARY AND TERTIARY INSTITUTES, </p>
<p>I UN: DERS, TAND THAT PLANS ARE-NOW BEIG DISCUSSED, TOO, FOR<br />
THE USP TO UNDERTA: KE NW TRAINING POGRAS IN IECHAN ICAL,<br />
CIVIL AND CONSTRUCTION TECHNOLOGIES AND OTHER AREAS REQUIRING<br />
MIDDLE MANAGEMENT OR SEMI-PROFESSIONAL TRAINING, THE<br />
IMPORTANCE WHICH ALL COUNTRIES ATTACH TO TRAINING SUFFICIENT<br />
YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN IN THESE FIELDS IS WELL KNOWN, I AM VERY<br />
PLEASED THAT AUSTRALIA HAS BEEN ABLE TO CONTRIBUTE IN THIS<br />
AREA AT USP,<br />
MR CHANCELLOR, IN CONCLUSION, MAY I SAY THAT IT GIVES ME<br />
PARTICULAR SATISFACTION TO DECLARE THESE BUILDINGS OPEN,<br />
AND TO WISH ALL WHO WORK IN THEM EVERY SUCCESS AND SATISFACTION.<br />
THESE BUILDINGS ARE I BELIEVE A STANDING DEMONSTRATION OF<br />
AUSTRALIA'S CONTINUING COMMITMENT TO WORK WITH ITS FRIENDS<br />
IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC FOR THE FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF THE REGION.<br />
THAT COMMITMENT IS AMONG THE MOST IMPORTANT AUSTRALIA HAS ANYWHERE. </p>
