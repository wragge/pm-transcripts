PRIMES MAINISTE PRESS STATEMENT<br />
19 November 1974<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam, released the following<br />
statement when he left Amberley late last night to return to<br />
Canberra.. He had spent four days of intensive campaigning<br />
for the Queensland State election.<br />
The Bjelke-Petersen Government is cheating Queenslanders<br />
of the benefits of increased Australian Government funds for<br />
education, housing and local government. It is cutting back<br />
its own expenditures in areas where the Australian Government<br />
has given more money.<br />
Not only has the Bjelke-Petersen Government deprived<br />
Queenslanders of $ 50 million in Federal funds by refusing<br />
to co-operate on growth centres and land commissions. It<br />
has effectively deprived Queensland of millions of dollars<br />
worth of extra money for essential community services.<br />
The Queensland Government has shown itself mean and<br />
devious in its financial allocations. The more my Government<br />
is prepared to spend on essential social purposes, the less<br />
Mr Bjelke-Petersen is willing to spend.<br />
The Queensland Government accepted a $ 16,500,000<br />
supplement for education under the Karmel recommendations last<br />
year and then reduced its own expenditure accordingly. This<br />
year, despite a 16.3% increase in Queensland consolidated<br />
revenue, there is an increase of less than half that percentage<br />
in proposed education expenditures. This is happening while<br />
Queensland children are taught in corridors and on verandahs<br />
because of a shortage of classrooms.<br />
This year we approved massive direct grants to local<br />
government totalling $ 56 million throughout Australia, including<br />
just under $ 9 million for Queensland. These grants will enable<br />
local councils to improve essential community services<br />
roads, health centres, recreation facilities.<br />
Yet the Queensland Government has been progressively<br />
reducing the percentage of local authority expenditure which it<br />
provides in subsidies from State revenue. At the same time<br />
the percentage of State Government spending met by money from<br />
the Australian Government has progressively risen.<br />
Since 1956 the percentage of local authority expenditure<br />
met by the State has fallen from 6.23% to 4.94% and the<br />
percentage of State Government spending met by the Commonwealth<br />
has risen from 33.61% to 45.09%. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
State subsidies on roads were reduced from 20% to<br />
and subsidies on sports field and playground construction<br />
have been cut from 20% to nothing.<br />
While the Queensland Government refuses millions of<br />
dollars from the Australian Government for land acquisition and<br />
development it is planning to cut its own expenditure on land<br />
development by 11%.<br />
Despite greatly increased Federal grants for housing<br />
under my Government, Queensland is actually building fewer<br />
housing commission homes than Labor when it was last in office<br />
in 1957. Despite all the advantages of economic development and<br />
despite financial assistance from Canberra, the State<br />
Government built last year only 1400 homes 500 fewer than<br />
Labor's last total and yet at the same time left unspent<br />
no less than $ 12 million provided in housing funds by the<br />
Australian Government.<br />
The most miserable cut back of all was Mr Bjelke-Petersen' s<br />
decision to scrap the $ 2,350,000 he had budgeted for State<br />
unemployment relief.<br />
When my Government raised unemployment benefits<br />
Mr Bjelke-Petersen responded by abolishing his benefits<br />
altogether. He took it out on men and women who had lost<br />
their jobs. He . took it out on their families.<br />
Who can doubt Percy Tucker's claim that the Queensland<br />
Government has a vested interest in unemployment so it can<br />
attack the Australian Government and pass the buck to Canberra<br />
for all its failures?<br />
The Prime Minister said that the very worst, the most<br />
cynical of all Mr Bjelke-Petersen's dispicable actions was<br />
his deliberate downgrading of the double orphan benefit.<br />
Queensland once gave a $ 12 benefit to orphans. When Labor<br />
came to power in Canberra we initiated a Federal orphan<br />
benefit of $ 10. The combined State and Federal total would<br />
have given orphans a total benefit of $ 22. And that would<br />
have been the least compensation we could given children who<br />
had lost both parents.<br />
But what did the Queensland Premier do?<br />
He immediately reduced the State orphan benefit by a<br />
total of $ 10. He wiped out the effect of the Federal grant.<br />
He reduced the State orphan benefit to a miserly $ 2.<br />
Instead of Orphans getting $ 22, Mr Bjelke-Petersen ensured<br />
that they continued to get only $ 12. Since that despicable,<br />
that heartless act of the Queensland Premier, the Australian<br />
Government has once more increased the orphan benefit by<br />
another $ 5 to<br />
I can only hope that the Queensland Premier's peculiar<br />
sense of non-co-operative miserliness does not prompt him to<br />
repeat his earlier shameful discrimination against Queensland's<br />
orphans. </p>
