    <content><![CDATA[<p>
I thank Annabel Miller for directing our ceremony here today and Marissa Starr for leading us so beautifully in our National Anthem.</p>
<p>And I begin by acknowledging the traditional owners of this land, the Wiradjuri people, and thank Gloria Rogers for the Welcome to Country.</p>
<p>Friends, it is a delight to join you today in the beautiful city of Bathurst as we open a new centre to advance our understanding of a truly great Australian leader.</p>
<p>It is a real honour to do so in the company of members of the Chifley family.</p>
<p>There are many people behind the story of this house and I'll share one of them briefly today.</p>
<p>It is almost fifty years since in 1962, a skinny 15 year old kid walked into his first Labor Party meeting bearing a piece of paper with two motions scrawled upon it.</p>
<p>One motion was to create a Labor Party newspaper.</p>
<p>The second motion was to preserve Ben Chifley's house as an historic site.</p>
<p>The 15 year old kid was none other than Bob Carr.</p>
<p>Thankfully Bob's totalitarian tendencies were nipped in the bud and Australia was not endowed with a gumnut version of Pravda.</p>
<p>But the more important of those two motions did come to pass a decade later.</p>
<p>Thanks to the foresight of Bathurst Council, Ben Chifley's house was indeed preserved.</p>
<p>Number 10 Busby Street was opened to the public by Gough Whitlam on March 24, 1973 - and it has become a great gift to our nation.</p>
<p>The Chifley house is a window onto another time - a simpler Australia of modest comfort and sturdy frugality.</p>
<p>The house, too, is a window into the life of its owner, Ben Chifley.</p>
<p>Here we can see Chifley's humility represented in physical form.</p>
<p>There is no excess, no extravagance.</p>
<p>His outlet to the world was a wireless set and a Bakelite phone.</p>
<p>His biggest self-indulgence perhaps a meal of his favourite dish: corned beef and potatoes cooked in their jackets.</p>
<p>It is a place every Australian should visit to learn something of our better selves and the things that make us truly great.</p>
<p>For decades, this adjacent building - Number 12 Busby Street - was home to the Chifleys' neighbours.</p>
<p>You can imagine Lizzie lending her neighbour a cup of sugar to make a sponge cake or chatting over the back fence on washing day.</p>
<p>Now the property has been enlisted to enable Ben's story to be better told for those who make the Bathurst pilgrimage.</p>
<p>As with the original preservation of the Chifley Home, Bathurst Regional Council has taken the lead with this project and I thank them for their efforts.</p>
<p>I know everything to do with the Chifley Home is a labour of love for the council and its staff, and the nation is proud that the property has such careful custodians.</p>
<p>The Australian and NSW Governments have also played their part, with grants of $175,000 and $82,000 respectively, along with $282,000 from Council.</p>
<p>Isn't that the way we want government to work in this nation - all levels banding together for the common good.</p>
<p>I'd like to think that level of cooperation reflects something of the new approach we're trying to bring to the nation's affairs in Canberra.</p>
<p>The truth is that as Australians, we all do better when we work together.</p>
<p>Chifley proved that when he sat down with Bill McKell to plan the Snowy Scheme and the Commonwealth-State housing agreement.</p>
<p>In 2010 the times may be different, the job remains the same:</p>
<p>- to build a nation that is strong, decent and fair, and to so in a manner that is less partisan and more productive.</p>
<p>If anyone needs to rediscover the purpose and dignity of politics as our new parliamentary landscape unfolds, they need only come to this house and reflect.</p>
<p>One thing that almost oozes from its walls is Chifley's simple grandeur and his unwavering belief in our nation, its people and its potential.</p>
<p>For Chifley, those possibilities were endless, and the very same faith inspires me as I begin my own prime ministerial journey.</p>
<p>But there is a sadness to this house as well because Chifley didn't get to enjoy it in retirement.</p>
<p>He died in Canberra, aged 66, his body exhausted from eight years in government, managing with John Curtin the nation's gravest crisis, and putting in place the building blocks of post-war reconstruction that would protect the Australian people from the misery of unemployment and want.</p>
<p>Ben Chifley had the zeal of reform but it was tempered by the pragmatic realism of a man who had known defeat, as Labor's early hopes disintegrated in the misunderstandings and divisions of the 1930s.</p>
<p>With hard work and integrity, Curtin and Chifley rebuilt a new tradition of Labor in government - economically responsible, strongly protective of our national security and social reformist in a way that carried the community along.</p>
<p>In many ways, this is the model of a Labor government that still inspires us today.</p>
<p>And, of course, Chifley achieved it all in a profoundly Australian way.</p>
<p>As the historian Ross McMullin has said:</p>
<p>"there has surely never been a more down-to-earth, unpretentious Australian prime minister than Ben Chifley"</p>
<p>- and you can see that from the remarkable modesty of his own home.</p>
<p>It's just about impossible to imagine a Churchill or a Roosevelt inhabiting a place like this.</p>
<p>And certainly not a Menzies.</p>
<p>Though this place is profoundly ordinary - and perhaps because it is - this is the unique home of a unique national leader.</p>
<p>A life such as that must not be forgotten.</p>
<p>And with the preservation of the house and the addition of this fine new facility, it never will be.</p>
<p>In the name of the Australian people, I dedicate this Education Centre to the memory of Joseph Benedict Chifley, and take great pride in declaring it officially open. </p>
