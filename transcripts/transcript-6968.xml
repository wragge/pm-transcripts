FOR MEDIA 1 JULY 1986<br />
The Government has rejected an increase of 11.7 per cent in<br />
salaries payable to Parliamentarians recommended by the<br />
Remuneration Tribunal's 1986 review.<br />
The Tribunal, which reviews the remuneration payable to<br />
Ministers* Senators and Members, Judges, Members of the<br />
Inter-state Commission, Secretaries of Commonwealth<br />
Departments and holders of public offices, presented its<br />
report to the Government last week. It has recdmmended no<br />
change in the general levels of salaries except in relation<br />
to Parliamentarians where it has recommended strongly the<br />
removal of an anomaly which has existed since 1984.<br />
The anomaly has arisen because the Government has<br />
consistently set an example in wage restraint by either not<br />
accepting or reducing the increases recommended by the<br />
tribunal. In its submission to the Tribunal this year the<br />
Government, while recognising that a real anomaly existed,<br />
submitted that it would not be appropriate to increase<br />
Parliamentarians' salaries at this time. The Tribunal has<br />
argued. however, for an Increase now and has stated that<br />
compliance with its statutory obligation, and fairness and<br />
equity required that the anomaly be removed.<br />
The Government has nevertheless decided that in the<br />
Interests of restraint generally It will forego the Increase<br />
recommended by the Tribunal. The only Increases to apply to<br />
Parliamentarians' salaries will be those resulting from<br />
National Wage decisions.<br />
On a related matter It should also be noted that, contrary<br />
to some assertions, Parliamentarians are subject to the same<br />
taxation requirements as other taxpayers In relation to<br />
their fringe benefits and the allowances. Indeed the<br />
particular circumstances of many parliamentarians Is such<br />
that their disposable -income is likely to fall as a result<br />
of the tax package.<br />
The net outcome for particular Parliamentarians will depend<br />
to a large extent on the degree to which they spend expense<br />
of office and electoral allowances on deductible expenses,<br />
Like all other taxpayers# they will be required to maintain<br />
suitable expenditure records from today to support<br />
deductions for employment-related expenses. Any allowan~ ces<br />
not spent on deductible Items will attract Income tax. </p>
<p>2.<br />
This may well result in some significant increases in tax<br />
liabilities for individuals. In this regard, it is<br />
particularly relevant that entertainment expenses may no<br />
longer be claimed as tax deductions. Parliamentarians have<br />
significant expenses in this area, but will no longer be<br />
able to claim deductions in relation to them. Accordingly a<br />
significant part of their expense allowances are likely to<br />
become subject to full taxation from today. </p>
