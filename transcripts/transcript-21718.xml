    <content><![CDATA[<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Prime Minster welcome.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It's great to be here Neil, it's a huge privilege.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>It is a huge privilege.  It's been a long night but it's a very good, warm and friendly crowd you'll be glad to hear.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well this is a great... it's a sentimental occasion; it's a great national occasion. The wonderful thing about this day is that it grips us tighter with each passing year and all the cynicism of some years ago has dropped away and people are very proud of what the young of Australia did those years ago and I think that's fantastic.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>What do you take with you Prime Minister when you tour the battlefields and you look at all these things? What is the overwhelming feeling and sense you get? What does it say to you?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The immense grief of... they're all young. You look at the headstones and they're 18, 19, 20, 23, I mean some of them were older but the great bulk of them were young. And they lost their lives to give us what we have now and I think that is always the simple message of remembrance.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>How do you feel as Prime Minister - we have the ANZAC moving around behind you there, we have thousands of young people wrapped up in the Australian flag, they want to talk about it, they want to think about it...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think it's exhilarating, it's inspiring and I am so proud and I feel very privileged to be Prime Minister of this wonderful country and I feel I'm at home here. This is Australia, it is Turkey... but you know, in an emotional way, its part of Australia - it always will be.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Just finally a message for Australia on this Anzac Day?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Just always remember they gave their all for us.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Thank you for your time Prime Minister.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>
