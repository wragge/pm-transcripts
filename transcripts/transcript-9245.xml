SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING, MP<br />
ZIONIST FEDERATION OF AUSTRALIA<br />
36TH BIENNIAL CONFERENCE<br />
HYATT HOTEL, MELBOURNE<br />
28 MAY 1994<br />
I am always grateful to be invited to speak to the biennial meeting of the<br />
Zionist Federation of Australia.<br />
This is the third time I have had the opportunity to address you. As a record,<br />
it doesn't go near matching Mark Leibler's but it is enough to make me feel at<br />
home here.<br />
It is particularly good to be talking to you this year, when so many of the<br />
Federation's long-standing goals seem closer to realisation, and when the<br />
signs for a more peaceful and secure future in the Middle East appear better<br />
than they have for years.<br />
The changes in the world since the end of the Cold War have sometimes<br />
startled even the most hardened sceptic.<br />
What seemed impossible is now familiar the democratic revolutions in<br />
Eastern Europe and Russia; the pace of economic growth in China and<br />
Vietnam as they have dropped the old tenets of central planning; the<br />
progress towards settlement of apparently intractable conflicts in regions such<br />
as Cambodia.<br />
And most recently, of course, we have seen Nelson Mandela's historic<br />
election as President of South Africa.<br />
None of these changes has been accomplished without difficulty. All of them<br />
generate new sets of problems.<br />
But the astonishing thing, when you look back ten years, is that they have<br />
happened. So it is with the Middle East. </p>
<p>Mark Leibler uses the right phrase In his President's Report to you this year<br />
when he says that, with the Madrid Peace Conference in October 1991, the<br />
Middle East entered a new epoch.<br />
The lessons of history and the lessons of history in the Middle East more<br />
than elsewhere are that we would be wise to temper our optimism with<br />
realistic caution.<br />
And for the key participants, the stakes are so high that prudence is always<br />
called for.<br />
However, with agreement on the Declaration of Principles between Israel and<br />
the PLO on 13 September last year, an~ d the signing of the agreement for<br />
autonomy in Gaza and Jericho, it is possible to have expectations, as well as<br />
hope, for a more peaceful future in the region.<br />
As I said in Parliament on 5 May, Australia warmly welcomed the autonomy<br />
agreement. It is a real milestone in the quest for a peaceful settlement in the Middle East<br />
and a tribute to the leadership of Prime Minister Rabin and PLO<br />
C hairman Arafat, who held their nerve in the face of terrorist attacks by<br />
violent opponents determined to disrupt the process.<br />
Anybody looking for a reason to break off the negotiations would have found<br />
many. It was no time for faint hearts.<br />
The result is also, of course, a tribute to the untiring work of other<br />
peacemakers, like Shimon Peres.<br />
Now we look to the next stages of the process to agreements which will<br />
bring a lasting peace with Israel's neighbours, Syria, Jordan and Lebanon,<br />
and to the successful completion of the next round of Palestinian autonomy<br />
negotiations.<br />
With same contrast, Australia's international Interests lie overwhelmingly in<br />
the Asia-Pacific region. That is where we do three-quarters of our trade.<br />
That is where our key security interests are engaged.<br />
That is where our future lies.<br />
But we cannot and should not ignore the Middle East. The stakes there in<br />
both strategic and human terms are so great as to Impose their significance<br />
on all the areas and members of the international community.<br />
That is why the Australian Government is keen to see the cause of peace so<br />
actively supported. </p>
<p>And our help has been of the most practical kind.<br />
It Is seen in our three-year, $ 15_-mil -lion program of assistance to economic<br />
development in Gaza and the West Bank for such things as training, health,<br />
sanitation and water resources.<br />
The success of autonomy will depend heavily on whether these basic<br />
services can be delivered.<br />
It is seen in our participation In the working groups on Arms Control and<br />
Regional Security and on Water Resources, which have been ' set up as part<br />
of the peace process.<br />
It is seen in our military commitment to the Sinai MFO, now under Australian<br />
command, which helps maintain confidence on the border between Israel and<br />
Egypt.<br />
And, not least, it is seen In the work of individual Australians and Australian<br />
non-government organisations who have dedicated themselves to improving<br />
conditions on the ground for ordinary citizens.<br />
It is a welcome truth and a reflection of the changes at work in the region<br />
that the views of the Jewish community and the Australian Government on<br />
issues facing the community and on the Middle East have probably never<br />
been closer.<br />
Nor have the views of the Australian and Israeli Governments.<br />
But even when in the past we have disagreed with particular policies of<br />
individual Israeli Governments, we have never wavered and will never<br />
waver from our commitment to Israel's right to exist within secure and<br />
recognised borders.<br />
And, beyond that familiar phrase, we will never waver from a deeper<br />
conviction that the international community Is a better place, a more decent<br />
place, for the contribution Israel has made and will yet make.<br />
That is why we have been so willing to work to ensure Israel's full<br />
engagement in the mainstream of International activity.<br />
It is why we worked so hard with Israel to rescind the odious United Nations<br />
resolution 3379, which equated Zionism with racism. We voted against its<br />
adoption in 1975, and we co-sponsored its rescission in 1991.<br />
It Is why we have supported Israel's efforts to broaden its diplomatic ties in<br />
the Asia-Pacific. </p>
<p>It Is why we continue to be active In making representations to the Syrian<br />
Government regarding the welfare of Jews in Syria.<br />
It Is why we urge Arab governments to lift their anachronistic and<br />
counterproductive economic boycott of Israel.<br />
Uke any strong relationship, our friendship with Israel is given weight and<br />
value by the ties which exist beyond the actions of Governments, between<br />
the people of our two countries.<br />
The Zionist Federation of Australia has been an essential element of this<br />
facet of our relationship, of course.<br />
I want to note here the major role which Mark Leibler and the Federation<br />
played in keeping the problem of UN Resolution 3379 at the forefront of<br />
public debate in Australia and before the Australian Parliament where both<br />
Houses voted unanimously in favour of the efforts to rescind the resolution.<br />
Similarly, your Federation has done important work in sensitising Australian<br />
opinion to the injustice of the Arab economic boycott of Israel.<br />
But a lot of the Federation's most Important work has been in relation to our<br />
own society.<br />
On these questions, our views are close.<br />
For this Government, the promotion of tolerance and respect for cultural and<br />
religious differences, and a decent concern for the other members of this<br />
diverse society, is at the core of our view of what It means to be Australian.<br />
The Government continues to believe in the importance of involving<br />
community groups in the development of policies.<br />
Some of you will know that the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs,<br />
Senator Bolkus, will be appointing in the near future a Multicultural Advisory<br />
Council. Helene Teichrnann will be well aware of this, because I was<br />
delighted to hear that she has accepted an invitation to be a member.<br />
The Council will advise the Government on specific matters such as the<br />
cultural diversity dimensions of the Centenary of Federation and the Sydney<br />
2000 Olympics, as well as on the means of fostering greater debate and<br />
better understanding about Australia's cultural diversity.<br />
I should note, in speaking of Senator Bolkus, that this Government continues<br />
to regard Immigration and Ethnic Affairs as sufficiently Important to warrant<br />
the attention of a senior Cabinet Minister. </p>
<p>We are preparing to take a further step to safeguard our record of tolerance<br />
with the introduction shortly of nationai legislation on racial vilification.<br />
The Australian concept of tolerance embraces freedom of opinion and<br />
freedom of expression. These are fundamental to our sense of ourselves.<br />
However, some forms of expression are sufficiently offensive to be intolerable<br />
in a decent society.<br />
This was brought home to me when I opened the Children of the Holocaust<br />
exhibition at the Australian War Memorial in February. The suggestionby<br />
some that the Holocaust never happened fosters incipient racism and, in the<br />
eyes of the Australian community, is obnoxious.<br />
Mnother example was the jailing of people for a series of violent attacks in<br />
Perth inspired on racial grounds.<br />
While most Australians are offended by the racial aspect of those crimes, the<br />
perpetrators were jailed under laws which do not recognise that aspect of<br />
their behaviour.<br />
Racial vilification and racial violence are offensive to the Australian<br />
community. Our laws must reflect that.<br />
The racial vilification laws will dissuade those who seek to incite violence and<br />
hatred against particular groups defined by ethnic origin.<br />
The existence of a legal prohibition should of itself persuade most of the<br />
intolerant to think twice before parading their prejudices.<br />
It will ensure that those invited to publish racist slurs have a legal ground for<br />
refusing. But there will still be breaches of the law, and the Cabinet is considering how<br />
they will be dealt with.<br />
We are not interested in elevating racists to the status of martyrs.<br />
But the vicious and the reckless who would attack Individual groups must be<br />
made to know that they are assaulting the values of the entire community and<br />
that there is a price to pay.<br />
The very existence of such a law is a public and collective statement by the<br />
community that there are types of behaviour it will not tolerate.<br />
By taking such a step we will reassert the value our community places on<br />
tolerance and respect. </p>
<p>For the past ten years, Mark Leibler has been at the forefront of the Zionist<br />
Federation of Australia's efforts to promote the cause of closer ties between<br />
Australia and Israel, and the aspirations of the Jewish community in Australia.<br />
I first met Mark about eight years ago, talking not about the Federation or<br />
about Israel, but about taxation reform in Australia The work we were<br />
engaged in then and since was not quite as difficult as reconciling the<br />
interests of Israelis and Arabs, but it sometimes seemed the views of the<br />
participants were just as resistant to change.<br />
Ten years is a long time at the top of an organisation like this.<br />
It is a tribute to Mark's skill and his commitment that the Federation has<br />
remained throughout that period so lively and influential an organisation. If<br />
the Government has not always agreed with Mark and the Federation, noone<br />
should ever think it was because your President and his team failed to<br />
carry your views forcefully even relentlessly to us in Canberra.<br />
So I want to add my voice to all those congratulating him.<br />
The contribution he has made over that decade has not been simply to the<br />
Federation and the Jewish community. It has been a much broader<br />
contribution to public debate in Australia about some of the key issues<br />
affecting the nature of this society.<br />
It Is a contribution he can be proud of, and for which we are all grateful. We<br />
look forward to just as productive a relationship with his successor, and to our<br />
continuing dialogue with the Zionist Federation of Australia. </p>
