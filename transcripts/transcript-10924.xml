<p>Well thank you very much, Edwina, for those warm words of introduction.</p>
<p> Can I welcome everybody here tonight. As Chairman, can I say how much</p>
<p> I savour the moment of at last being in charge of the Senate.</p>
<p>Tonight's debate is on the subject that this House believes that</p>
<p> religion has no place in politics. There was once a time in Australian</p>
<p> society where people were exhorted, particularly if they belonged</p>
<p> to clubs, never to talk about two things and those two things were</p>
<p> religion or politics. And I can remember as a young person when I</p>
<p> first started to develop a great interest in politics that I thought</p>
<p> to myself: heavens, if you can't talk about politics and you</p>
<p> can't talk about religion life would be a pretty dull thing.</p>
<p>Australian political history has been dotted with periods in its time</p>
<p> where the interaction between the church rather than religion and</p>
<p> politics has been a controversial issue. And there was, for a significant</p>
<p> period of Australia's history after World War II, a long-running</p>
<p> debate about the extent to which formal pronouncements of the church</p>
<p> and in relation to political issues should be countenanced. And it</p>
<p> still remains, on certain moral issues, it still remains a lively</p>
<p> topic of conversation. So I think for this House it is, indeed, a</p>
<p> very apt subject of debate.</p>
<p>Now, tonight's debate, as always, is between a government and</p>
<p> an opposition. The members of the Government, which comprise the Australian</p>
<p> Schools Debating Team, are Imogen Saunders, from St Hilda's Anglican</p>
<p> School for Girls in Perth; Richard Howard from The Shore School in</p>
<p> Sydney and Simon Quinn from St Joseph's College in Brisbane.</p>
<p> For the Opposition, Bishop George Browning of the Diocese of Canberra</p>
<p> and Goulburn, the Hon. Gary Humphries, the ACT Deputy Chief Minister,</p>
<p> and Christopher Erskine, a well known lawyer in the city of Canberra</p>
<p> and the President of the Australian Debaters' Federation. Importantly</p>
<p> on my left we have the three adjudicators Â or are they on my</p>
<p> right? Just put their hands up. No, they're in the middle. And</p>
<p> those people are Belinda Holloway, Benjamin O'Donnell and Tonia</p>
<p> Riszko.</p>
<p>I understand that the rules of a debate which involve a right of replay,</p>
<p> the Government going first and the Opposition second in the right</p>
<p> of reply involve a speech of eight minutes, a bell after one minute</p>
<p> to allow the interruption time and then another bell at seven and</p>
<p> two bells at eight. There are some capable timekeepers on my left</p>
<p> who will look after all of those things for which I am very, very</p>
<p> grateful. After the debate is over if anybody wants to ask any questions</p>
<p> or hurl any insults at the Chair or anybody else, they're perfectly</p>
<p> entitled to do so.</p>
<p>Can I very seriously and sincerely compliment Minter Ellison on its</p>
<p> public spiritedness in sponsoring the team and being responsible for</p>
<p> getting this debate together. I think debating is a marvellous past</p>
<p> time. It's a great intellectual stimulant. It's a great</p>
<p> trainer of the mind. And I think Minter Ellison are to be thanked</p>
<p> by the debating fraternity of Australia for the contribution that</p>
<p> they are making towards that cause in sponsoring this debate.</p>
<p>So let us to the task and the battle. This House believes that religion</p>
<p> has no place in politics. The first speaker for the Government - and</p>
<p> I will, just so you all know, say something of each speaker as I introduce</p>
<p> them, not too long but just so you know a little bit about them -</p>
<p> the first speaker for the Government is Imogen Saunders. Imogen was</p>
<p> a member of the 1998 Western Australian State Debating Team. She has</p>
<p> just completed year 11 at St Hilda's Anglican School for Girls</p>
<p> in Perth. The first speaker for the Government, Imogen Saunders.</p>
