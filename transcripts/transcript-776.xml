FOR PRESS P. M. No. 60/ 1963<br />
It will be recalled that at Surfers' Paradise<br />
last week ( Thursday), the Prine Minister, Sir Robert<br />
Menzies' node of dress came under criticism from a<br />
speaker at the Federated Clothing Industries Council<br />
Meeting. The Prime Minister has received the following<br />
verses from a Mr. Nornan Munro of Elsternwick, Victoria<br />
" My dear Sir Bob, why don't you choose<br />
Some pointed long and bright red shoes;<br />
Sockettes to match; of radiant hue.<br />
' There's pink and blue and primrrose too.'<br />
Your baggy pants they're quite a fright.<br />
They should, at least, be stovepipe tight,<br />
And show the figure. Make tern hoti<br />
But mind and don't get in a knot.<br />
That tatty coat of sombre hue.<br />
My dear good sir, is not for you.<br />
So chuck away your double breaster.<br />
Wear shirt, tails out, a la fiesta.<br />
Your patriachal locks disdain<br />
For beard and shaggy uncut mane.<br />
A Homburg doesn't bring eclat.<br />
Get TEnery ' Iggins ' at. La, la,<br />
IA woman's best accessory,<br />
A well-dressed man' Or could it be<br />
That nan himself, all taut and tense<br />
Well? Honi soit qui mal y pense,<br />
CANBERRA, July, 1963. </p>
