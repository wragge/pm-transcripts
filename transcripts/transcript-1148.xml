FOR PRESS: No. 64+/ 1965<br />
COMMUNICATIONS WITH MR. LEE KEJAN YEW<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister? the Rt. Hon. Sir Robert Menzies<br />
The last thing that I would want to do would be to<br />
comment upon statements made by my colleague, Mr. Lee Kuan Yew,<br />
of' which I have had some reports.<br />
I want to make it quite clear that Mr, Lee has my<br />
warm good wishes and those of my Government and that we all hope<br />
that Singapore will have a successful future. I have already told<br />
him this. It is quite true that when Mr. Lee was in Australia<br />
I had long and useful discussions with him, as did the members<br />
of my Cabinet. It is also true that later on he wrote to me<br />
and that I wrote to him, but these communications, as he agrees,<br />
were personal and 19 of course, cannot disclose their contents.<br />
After hearing from him and considering what he<br />
had to say, I was by no means inactive. I communicated with the<br />
Prime Minister of Malaysia; my Minister for External Affairs<br />
saw him; and ther(_ i-no doubt that our views, which were always<br />
helpful were well known to him as they were to Mr. Lee.<br />
Naturally I am not prepared to disclose the contents of these<br />
communica ~ ons. I think that the important thing to remember in<br />
all these matters is that, while Australia does not determine<br />
the future of Malaysia or the position of its constituent<br />
States, we are profoundly interested in the future well-being<br />
of this part of the world. We hope and believe that Malaysia<br />
and Singapore will be able to work out joint defensive arrangements<br />
of a satisfactory kind. Indeed, with good will on both<br />
sides, we are sure that this result can be achieved.<br />
After the separation of Singapore from Malaysia,<br />
I sent to Mr. Lee a warm expression of our goodwill of our<br />
recognition, of our hopes for the future. Those views still<br />
stand. CA NBERA,<br />
31st Augst, 1965. </p>
