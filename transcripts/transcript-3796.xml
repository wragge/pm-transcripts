WORLD CONFERENCE OF INTER NATIONAL<br />
Statement by the TLeader of the Australian<br />
Delegation, Ms Elizabeth Rei at Mexico City on<br />
Mr President,. to take this<br />
opportunity of congratulating you on your unanimous<br />
election to the important role of President of<br />
the first V. orld Conference of International<br />
Women's Year. We are convinced that your<br />
perspicacity and insight, your unfailing tact<br />
and infectious good humour, will all help to<br />
ensure that our discussions are to the point,<br />
business-like and fruitful.<br />
I would also like to extend the Australian<br />
Delegation's congratulations to the other members<br />
of the bureau and express to the: Mexican<br />
Government our thanks for their generous<br />
gesture in hosting this conference, we<br />
hope will bS one of historical significance.<br />
We listened with great interest to the<br />
addresses in the first plenary session of this<br />
conference yesterday morning. That delivered<br />
by the Secretary-General of the United Nations,<br />
Dr. Waldhein, was indeed thought-provoking.<br />
The comprehensive address which followed, given<br />
by His Excellency the President of Mexico,<br />
contained a number of concepts which attracted<br />
the attention of my delegation: Perhaps the<br />
most interesting was the President's exposition<br />
of the-marginality of women in society.<br />
There are some amnongst us here today who<br />
will achieve very little, others who are<br />
concerned that this conference will be<br />
unnecessarily politicised, yet others who query<br />
our ability to produce a concise and sensitive<br />
world plan of action. Australia is not amongst<br />
the pessimists. recent years we have worked<br />
hard to bring about change in our own country<br />
and have learnt much from our successes as well<br />
/ 2 </p>
<p>as from our fai2u. res.. We are morei than li,-ppy to<br />
share ou~ r exeancs and1 to benefit from the<br />
exp--eri ence of others buit we do not want this<br />
con: rve.. ncs to degenerate into a needless and<br />
ti1It-, 5ti rig se-ries of corroarison of<br />
a ch ie(--v e i i t'-s-, Vi do not deny-the value of<br />
learning fro, i each other's effort%-s and<br />
strategies but tliere is simply not the tirte<br />
to listen to le--ngthy enumerations of national<br />
progr,--mTa thi-s iz3 an interational confc-rence,<br />
our takhere is to focus on fundamental issues<br />
a. nd ior importantly, to develop strategies<br />
which will provide a framewto rk f1or t%-h e<br />
achiovement of7 our universal] ly known goals.<br />
If this ' 2o-Ference is to be' serious in<br />
m aiit-aining +. hat there is oetigwrong aith<br />
the position. of women in soitthen we have<br />
two art'xedia-te and imortant tak. Firstly<br />
we have to analyse the si-tua-tion, and see why<br />
it is wrong and secondly we MUst work out<br />
strategies fcr changing that situation. The<br />
clearest analysis Which has been developed and<br />
one which cuts ac.-coss cultural and social<br />
differences within and between countries is<br />
that whnich describes thE! inferior position<br />
of wonten as arising from sexism.*<br />
We must cease being afraid to use these<br />
words. Sexism is the artificial ascription<br />
of roles, belhaviour and even personalities<br />
to pec-, le on -the basis of their sex alone.<br />
This do) es not simply create difference-S<br />
but inequ a 1 t -Le. s. We none ie -fin u and<br />
it is imoo33s'ble to imagine liv1ig in, a<br />
non-sexist society.<br />
The fact that women as a group are<br />
supposed to have and indeed are forced to<br />
have, in nmanv subtle and not so subtle ways,<br />
a different kind of personalityi a different<br />
pattern of behaviour as aaroup. has<br />
consequences for their -position in society.<br />
It is evident to all of us that we live<br />
in societies w~ hich are ruled by men in other<br />
words, our socie-ites are patriarchal. This<br />
must also mean that our " womanly ' virtues"<br />
are not those virtues which are rewarded by<br />
society, that our enforced differences are<br />
not as hallowed or valued as they are said<br />
to be. But ofc course it is such a subtle<br />
process a colonization by mute consentthat<br />
although we-have in the past accepted<br />
these patriarchal values it is still<br />
difficult for us to see the way out.<br />
/ 3 </p>
<p>3<br />
To attempt to work out strategies for<br />
changing this situation must therefore, be<br />
our primary task at this conference. It will<br />
be slow and sometimes painful to come to te. rns<br />
with the reality of our problem, which reqc. es<br />
as much a revolution in the heads of people<br />
as it does the rmodification of the structures<br />
which reinforce these destructive values.<br />
The themes of this conference are<br />
equality, peace and development. The Australian<br />
Delegation does not believe, however, that<br />
these are separate issues to be dealt with<br />
in isolation from each other.<br />
For many years, the emphasis in<br />
developed countries has been on political<br />
rights, but it has been the experience of the<br />
women in the industrialised countries that<br />
economic rights are as important if not more<br />
so than political ones. We consider that<br />
a demand for a new international economic<br />
order is far from a peripheral issue to the<br />
debates at this conference.<br />
What concerns us is that in the<br />
discussion of the need for a new international<br />
economic order and of the charter of economic<br />
rights and duties of states, little attention<br />
has been given to the role women are to play<br />
in formulatiny and implementing this demand nor<br />
to the fact that women as well as men must<br />
benefit from this revolution. There must be<br />
a recognition that economic and social justice<br />
for women must go hand in hand with overall<br />
economic progress.<br />
When practical, constructive and<br />
realistic proposals emerge from the on-going<br />
debates on the new international economic order,<br />
women must not only not be forgotten, but<br />
their present oppression and subjugation<br />
must be recognised and steps taken to correct<br />
them. Measures must be discovered which<br />
help women to help themselves towards<br />
participation in and.. benefit from the development<br />
process. Women's involvement in establishing the<br />
new international economic order must be more<br />
than mere vague exhortations, insincere<br />
rhetoric and token gestures. The specific<br />
problems and experiences of women, including<br />
the poorest and least articulate, must be<br />
understood. If this is to be done with<br />
honesty it means asking and involving women<br />
themselves. Sensitivity must be shown<br />
towards those wromen the vast majority of<br />

Having sa. id this, however0 we believe<br />
that improvem-ents in tChe lives of women<br />

deliber---ations on the new economic order.<br />
it seems clear to us that womaen tharoughout<br />

be achie-ved within Dresent resource limitations<br />
and boundaries by a resetting of priorities<br />
as well as a realisatiorn of the importance of<br />
women in themselves as well * as to development.<br />
Women share wit'-h man the responsibility<br />
for establishing a jiust international order<br />
wit-~ urwhich true peace cannot be achieved.<br />
We not f--o:-cet tb--L womnen who have fought,<br />
t-e nd ti-ne again, for such an order and<br />
th,-ho are fighting still. nlut such is<br />
the r-= cedv that even wMhen women and men f ight<br />
a3 brother and sister to free themse~<br />

soc~~ v ene~ zits women no more than the old.<br />
Th efr brothers in the struggle carry within<br />
the;-i~ j rthe roots of treason: the myths and<br />
P "~ dces which kleep womien in their place.<br />
-However we mnight struggle for a new order,<br />
the res ponsibility which we as women bear will<br />
be ex-ercised in a different way, for we bring<br />
to the negotiating tabhle different experiences.<br />
WM~ en like the peoples of the third world,<br />
know the effects of opprassion: oppression is<br />
the bitter bread of our daily lives. This<br />
insatjht, born of excper. ience, m . ust not continue<br />

through the anguish of violence and oppression,<br />
which justifie3 the li,-ki-ng of -women with peace.<br />

as violent as any physical assault on<br />
women. Violence by women to children, to<br />
the. mselves and to others, is a reaction and<br />
a cry for help against such mental and social<br />
crimes. Until such time as violence against<br />
women is recognised and understood, and<br />
ceases, peace will remain unattainable.<br />
Equality is a limited and possible<br />
harmful goal. Associated with the struggle<br />
for equality have been some needed and just<br />
reforms: equal pay, equal access to formal<br />
education and vocational training, equality<br />
under the law and equal rights to vote and<br />
to run for public office. T'he importance of<br />
these reforms is as necessary pre-requisites<br />
both for the full participation we are seeking<br />
in the economic, social and political life of<br />
our countries and for the dignity and<br />
independence which are our rights as human<br />
beings. But we can no longer delude ourselves with<br />
the hope that formal equality, once achieved,<br />
will eradicate sexist oppression it could<br />
well merely legitimise it. For there is a real<br />
danger, a very real danger, that satisfaction<br />
with the achievement of formal equality will<br />
encourage the belief that all problems are<br />
thereby solved. However even if formal<br />
equai--v were to be achieved, all else still<br />
rezma_-s to be done.<br />
cur deliberations in these coming<br />
weeks-. te temptation to resort to pious<br />
plaziz-des and hollow but resounding rhetoric<br />
will overwhelming. For the breadth of the<br />
task ='-ead of us, the difficulty in realising<br />
its prac-ical ramifications, the unperturbable<br />
ignorance of so many people, the power of the<br />
structures we must combat, all militate against<br />
us. Even if we, each of us here, were dedicated,<br />
sensitive and understanding, we could only hope<br />
to touch the outermost limits of the experience<br />
of most women. This realisation commits us to<br />
enabling women to determine the shape of their<br />
own lives, not because it-is our favourite<br />
political theory but because it is the only way<br />
the decisions made will be the right ones.<br />
We women will-no longer be excluded from<br />
the sphere of decisions,-though we should<br />
reject the concommitant domination and power,<br />
for we have experienced the consequences. / 8 </p>
<p>8<br />
We women will no longer be relegated,<br />
either here or in our own countries, to a<br />
secondary oplice when " hard" politics are<br />
being discussed as distinct from " soft"<br />
women's issues. ; e reject this distinction:<br />
it is the distinction between the personal<br />
and the political. It is a part of our<br />
oppression. We women will no longer be manipulated<br />
for political ends, either in the international<br />
or in the national forum, for this deprives us<br />
of our dignity.<br />
We women will no longer tolerate<br />
paternalism, benign or otherwise, for<br />
it deprives us of our self-hood.<br />
This is our conference."<br />
