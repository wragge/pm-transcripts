FOR PRESS PM No. 99/ 1971<br />
PARLIAMENTARY SALARIES AND ALLOWANCES<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister Mx. William McMahon<br />
The Government has decided not to proceed with any<br />
of the three Bills relating to increases in Parliamentary A'alaries<br />
and allowances. In practical terms this means tZhat Parlian~ entary<br />
salaries will not be increased in the life of this Parliament.<br />
Parliamentary salary determinations are a difficult subject at any<br />
time. They give rise to a variety of public consideration and<br />
emotions. For this reason, it has been customary to proceed in the<br />
Parliament only on the basis of unanimity or near unanimity, The<br />
recent decision to have the salaries and allowances independ~ ently<br />
reviewed was initiated on that basis.<br />
The Leader of the Opposition wrote to me on<br />
13 September, 1971 and said that his executive had discusse4 replies<br />
which I had given in answer to questions in the House concerning<br />
Parliamentary salaries. He went on to say that, in the opinion of<br />
the executive, the salaries should be periodically reviewed by a<br />
member of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission or by an<br />
industrial judge in the same way as salaries of other citizens.<br />
Further on 16 September, after I had decided upon an<br />
inquiry into Parliamentary salaries and allowances, the Leader of<br />
the Opposition, in a statement in support, said that the opposition<br />
had suggested, and had supported, the approach which the Government<br />
had adopted. Also he expressed pleasure that the Government had<br />
sought and secured the services of a judge of such distipction in<br />
industrial matters. Mr. Justice Kerr submitted his report in which he put<br />
forward a set of detailed recommendations. He expressed the view'<br />
t~ iat the report should be considered as a whole. In paragraph 217,<br />
from which I quote, he said:-<br />
" I have considered remuneration as a whole an4 my<br />
r~ commendations in respect of particular financial matters are<br />
cOnnected with my recommendations on other related matters and the<br />
results should be looked at as a whole."<br />
The Government exercising its responsibility put forward<br />
to the Parliament proposals based on Judge Kerr's recommendations.<br />
The one point of difference was that exercising its responsibility<br />
to give leadership in the present situation of wage and salary<br />
pressures it proposed that the salary increases recommended by<br />
Judge Kerr should in all instances members, ministers and other<br />
office holders be reduced by 28.6% This is not in conflict with<br />
the Judge's recommendation that the report be treated as a whole.<br />
Judge Kerr said that he did not recommend any reduction by way of<br />
creating an example. But he also stated that it was a matter for<br />
Parliament to decide what, if anything, it should do along these<br />
lines. </p>
<p>The Opposition has indicated that it does not accept<br />
the Government's proposals. Instead it proposes. that only those<br />
sections of the Bills relating to the basic salary and allowances of<br />
Senators and Members should be adopted. This would upset and<br />
distort the pattern of Judge Kerr's recommendations. Further, there<br />
would be no unanimity between the parties. In the circumstances,<br />
the Government sees only one responsible course. This course is<br />
not to proceed with any of the three Bills. Whatever procedural<br />
steps are necessary for their ,. ithdrawal-will be taken.<br />
9 DECEMBER, 1971. </p>
