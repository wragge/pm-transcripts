PRIME MINISTER<br />
*** PLASE CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY'*<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING, MP<br />
THE ACTU CONGRESS<br />
MELBOURNE, 27 SEPTEMBER 1995<br />
It's a great pleasure to be here.<br />
There is no more important partnership for the Government than our<br />
partnership with the ACTU.<br />
There is no more important partnership for us, and no more important<br />
partnership for Australia.<br />
The last dozen years have proved this.<br />
It has been proved in an Accord which has provided us with the motor and<br />
the means of essential change; and with low inflation, and industrial harmony<br />
and cooperation, and much else that now characterises modem Australia and<br />
distinguishes us from countries which have-gone down neo-conservative<br />
paths meaning no consensus, no safety net, no accommodation of the<br />
social imperatives as we confront the economic ones.<br />
The Accord proves the value of the partnership, but it is proved in other ways<br />
as well.<br />
It is proved in the social programs. In programs for Australian families and<br />
Australian women. In the Working Nation programs for employment and<br />
training for young Australians and Australians coping with structural change.<br />
It is proved in the social policies which together make Australia's social safety<br />
net among the most comprehensive and sophisticated in the world.<br />
The value of our partnership is proved in the egalitarian reforming character<br />
of the Australian Government in both social and economic policy and,<br />
beyond these realms, in policies for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, in<br />
environment policies, in policies for the advancement of our nation and our<br />
nationhood, including our progress towards a republic. </p>
<p>The value of our partnership is proved in the continuation of a Labor<br />
Government a Labor Government still charged with zeal for reform and still<br />
aware that its responsibilities are forever to Australia's working men and<br />
women and their families.<br />
It is not the easiest partnership to maintain, especially in times of change.<br />
But who can say now, after twelve years of the most thoroughgoing reform in<br />
our country's history, that our interests cannot be reconciled not only<br />
reconciled, but made a force for the nation's interests?<br />
No one can say that.<br />
And when we have doubts about each other, it is worth bearing this in mind.<br />
It is worth reminding ourselves of what might have been if the Fraser<br />
government had continued, or we had adopted Thatcherism through Howard<br />
or Hewson.<br />
Think what sort of country we would now live in. How would the opportunity<br />
and wealth be spread in the New Right Australia of the old John Howard? Or<br />
the Old Right Australia of the even older John Howard?<br />
Never forget what our opponents have stood for in the past decade and a<br />
half. Don't think for a moment that Hewson was an aberration. Hewson was<br />
not an aberration. He was a Liberal.<br />
Like John Howard. John Howard has been every kind of Liberal it is<br />
possible to be old right and new right, Fraserite and Hewsonite, wet and dry,<br />
hard and soft, honest by name and rank opportunist by nature. What kind of<br />
Liberal John Howard is depends on which-way the Liberal Party thinks the<br />
wind is blowing. And if they can't get a reading here, they take one in<br />
America. But in the end there is only one John Howard and he is a deeply<br />
conservative and reactionary chap. The most conservative Liberal leader, he<br />
once said, in the party's history.<br />
The man who believed in all the things that John Hewson believed in but now<br />
wants Australians to believe he doesn't; the man with the airbrushed past; the<br />
man without policies. The man who wants to keep the monarchy and abolish<br />
the Accord.<br />
The man who wants to be Prime Minister and lead Australia into the 21st<br />
century. John Howard may want to keep his policies and his ideas hidden. He may in<br />
fact not have any policies or ideas beyond this industrial relations policy of<br />
his. But the next election whether he likes it or not will be about policies. </p>
<p>The next election will be a referendum on ideas for Australia.<br />
And one of those ideas is the Accord. The Accord has been a defining idea<br />
in the past decade and only a fool would abandon it for the next.<br />
That's the rub. That's what matters.<br />
The partnership between us has achieved great things. But the most<br />
important thing is yet to come. It always is.<br />
The most important thing is what we do to see that Australia goes into the<br />
21st century strong and secure, that the wealth and opportunity is shared,<br />
that our kids have hope and faith in their future, and belief in Australia.<br />
That we keep the great Australian democratic goals out in front, that we do<br />
the things necessary for our economy to compete in the world, and the things<br />
necessary to build a good and fair society and that we don't surrender the<br />
power to do them.<br />
I know it depends on trust and I know that trust is tested by events. I know<br />
that there are people who ask if the reforms of the past decade have been<br />
worth the pain: people who say the change is too rapid and too stressful and<br />
that it is not giving us the economic and social results which we have a right<br />
to expect.<br />
But the fact is that the economic changes were essential, and they have<br />
given us extraordinarily good results, kept us up with the international game<br />
and set us up for the 21st century.<br />
And if this intemrnationalisation of the economy has put pressures on our<br />
communities and on our traditional social goals in Australia, we have resisted<br />
the pressure with far more determination and far more success than most<br />
other countries.<br />
Worldwide technological change has increased wage inequality everywhere,<br />
but our response has been to offset this trend through a sophisticated social<br />
security system and a social wage.<br />
Nowhere has there been more change in Australia than in our workplaces, in<br />
the labour market and in industrial relations: change towards fewer and<br />
larger unions, change to enterprise-based bargaining and a reduced role for<br />
centralised wage setting practices, updates to and restructuring of awards.<br />
The case is unarguable the changes had to be made and they have been<br />
made well. We need to draw confidence from that experience and faith in<br />
this partnership between us. </p>
<p>We need this partnership because Australian industrial relations are once<br />
more under threat and with that the well-being and security of Australia's<br />
workers are under threat.<br />
John Howard and the Liberals have so few ideas we probably should be<br />
thankful for this one. Their industrial relations policy at least lets us all know<br />
where they stand. And whatever they might do to cast a softer light on it, they<br />
stand where they have always stood. Which is in direct opposition to Labor.<br />
Nowhere is the difference between Labor and the Opposition more obvious.<br />
The industrial relations policy debate we have recently entered highlights<br />
three fundamental differences between us.<br />
One, in the weight given to consensus and co-operation.<br />
Two, in the value accorded to the basic needs and protections for working<br />
men and women.<br />
And three, in our implicit judgements concerning what it is that Australians<br />
want in a Government.<br />
I want to address each of these matters.<br />
We shouldn't forget the antecedents of our reforms. Our predecessors in<br />
office bequeathed to us a quite amazing set of doubles double-digit inflation<br />
and double-digit unemployment. This was an achievement of no other<br />
Government in our history, but which a John Howard government may well<br />
match. These facts established a very obvious case for a different approach to wage<br />
and employment matters.<br />
And this was what the Accord was all about a simultaneous attack on<br />
inflation and unemployment.<br />
Over the rest of the 1980s the union movement and Australian working men<br />
and women bargained for wages and conditions in a new spirit one which<br />
was sensitive to the need to control inflation and reduce unemployment.<br />
This was the restraint of mature and responsible Australians.<br />
It delivered huge benefits to our economic reconstruction.<br />
The Accords have delivered sustained productivity increases and decreases<br />
in real unit labour costs. Since 1983, we have seen a 65 per cent fall in<br />
working days lost in strikes. And at the same time we've seen the creation of<br />
2 million jobs in Australia. </p>
<p>The Accord has helped create the culture in which change can take place; in<br />
which the imperatives of competitiveness have been recognised, in which<br />
workers' superannuation is laying the foundations of a national savings<br />
program and all of this in the context of real protections for those at risk of<br />
disadvantage from reform.<br />
Each employment target has been met, underlying inflation has been reduced<br />
dramatically, and at the same time Australia has been opened up to<br />
international trade and regional growth.<br />
As I said at the National Press Club a month ago why would anyone ditch it?<br />
And why, when in the last decade the union movement has been in the<br />
vanguard of necessary economic change and social progress, are we<br />
confronted with an Opposition that speaks the anti-union language of the<br />
1970s? Could it be because they alone among Australians have not changed?<br />
To say that Australia owes a lot to the behaviour of workers and unions in the<br />
early years of the Accord, is to grossly understate the case.<br />
It is not a small thing to forego wage increases for benefits that tend to accrue<br />
to the economy at large and not necessarily to those making the sacrifice.<br />
It is no small thing to change behaviour in fundamental ways for unseen<br />
benefits. It was no small thing to put trust in an untried institution, especially one that<br />
was treated with a good deal of scepticism, and even derision by some.<br />
The 1980s Accord accomplishments have left us with an economic base that<br />
ensures strength for the rest of the 1990s. Australian workers have delivered<br />
underlying inflation of less than two and a half per cent for all of this recovery<br />
even though jobs growth has been outstanding. Costs are under control and<br />
now real wages and productivity are growing.<br />
It is now understood that confrontation between employers and employees is<br />
not inevitable, and that conflict in the workplace is not a quintessentially<br />
Australian way of operating.<br />
It is now known world-wide that we are about achieving efficient economic<br />
reforms in an environment of co-operation, consultation and consensus.<br />
The cost restraint of the 1980s and the overall jobs growth since 1983 have<br />
meant that real disposable per capita household incomes easily the best<br />
single measure of individual economic welfare has increased by a very<br />
healthy 20 per cent. </p>
<p>It is sobering to ask where we would be today if Australian workers and<br />
unions had not acted with selflessness and maturity when it was most<br />
needed. It is particularly sobering to ask what might happen in the future if the Accord<br />
partnership is undone by our political opponents.<br />
That is the first major difference between the Government and the Coalition.<br />
For the Government the Accord is fundamental, for the Opposition it will be<br />
the first thing to go.<br />
Australian labour productivity growth has been more than twice that of New<br />
Zealand since that country introduced its Employment Contracts Act the<br />
Coalition's preferred model in 1991; the underlying rate of inflation is low;<br />
industrial disputes are at an historic low; the profit share is something close<br />
to an historic high and investment is booming but they want to abolish the<br />
Accord. The motive can't be rational. It must be ideological. It must derive from some<br />
loathing of unions and working people. Either that, or a loathing of common<br />
sense. The same lack of reason appears to have infected their thinking on interest<br />
rates. Just now they have been attempting to connect it to the level of foreign<br />
debt, by means of an unreliable imported truck.<br />
It is a very peculiar place to go looking for the problem or the solution. And<br />
a very peculiar way to go. If they were being rational or honest they would<br />
send out a truck which explained the link between the Accord and interest<br />
rates. Because if you don't have the Accord to control inflation, you only have<br />
interest rates to do it. If you haven't got an Accord and you want to take the<br />
heat out of wage pressures the only medicine is interest rates.<br />
The unarguable fact is that high interest rates always mean lower growth.<br />
And increases in interest rates to combat inflation must mean higher<br />
unemployment. I do not mean to imply that the Coalition wants higher interest rates and less<br />
employment growth. I do not necessarily think that they are nasty although<br />
there is some evidence of this. But I'm more inclined to think that they are<br />
prey to primal prejudices particularly against unions and workers.<br />
They see a productive partnership between governments and unions and<br />
workers as some profane cabal. Some horrid thing. Some anathema. </p>
<p>In fact, the Accord is a living, breathing and dynamic institution, responsive to<br />
outside pressures, accommodating of world economic forces and flexible to<br />
the contemporary circumstances of the Australian labour market. It has been<br />
also a significant contributor to social equality through support for Medicare<br />
and, most recently from Accord VIII, expansions to superannuation, and paid<br />
maternity leave all on a means tested basis.<br />
No one should forget that when wage restraint was most needed the Accord<br />
delivered it.<br />
When the adverse terms of trade change of 1985 caused a significant<br />
devaluation of the currency it was through the Accord that the devaluation<br />
was made effective and real. The partners supported a small real income cut<br />
in order to ensure that employment growth would not be at risk.<br />
When the extreme labour market pressures of the late 1980s emerged it was<br />
the Accord processes which kept a lid on inflation when almost no outside<br />
economic commentator thinking of similar pressures from the past believed<br />
it was possible.<br />
And when it became clear that some movement towards productivity-based<br />
wage adjustments was necessary to ensure competitiveness, again it was<br />
through the Accord that this was institutionalised and became a reality.<br />
Today the Accord continues to support enterprise-based identification of<br />
workplace-specific needs and this is highlighted and emphasised in the 1993<br />
Industrial Relations Act.<br />
The Accord is thus clearly an institution motivated by and sensitive to<br />
contemporary economic imperatives.<br />
But through all this one thing has never changed, and never will.<br />
It is that the Accord and the Government's industrial relations policy will<br />
always reflect the value we give to protecting the disadvantaged in the<br />
workplace. Nowhere is this more clearly evident than in the concept of the Government's<br />
" no disadvantage" test to workplace reform.<br />
The Government does not pussyfoot around with this issue: " no<br />
disadvantage" in agreements means exactly that.<br />
Some awards can be taken away in a workplace bargain, and over the course<br />
of time and because of the particular imperatives of workplaces, some<br />
employment conditions should and will be changed.<br />
But award conditions can only be varied if the total package of remuneration<br />
is not diminished through this process. </p>
<p>Put simply, no worker can be made worse off, by law, from the signing of a<br />
workplace agreement.<br />
This is the difference between the Government's approach and that of the<br />
Opposition. The Opposition in government will have legislation that guarantees that some<br />
conditions can be lost, and lost without compensation.<br />
That is, workers' overall incomes are clearly in jeopardy.<br />
This is a crucial development in the policy debate.<br />
It is clear this is true from listening to what Peter Reith and John Howard<br />
have said about their planned reforms.<br />
They have said that they support the current Western Australian State Award<br />
legislation. They have never backed away from the essential lack of a true<br />
no disadvantage test in Jobs back!<br />
Both the Western Australian and Jobsback! approaches allow agreements<br />
which do not include some basic conditions; for example, overtime pay,<br />
penalty rates and holiday leave loadings.<br />
And most significantly, these reflections of what their industrial relations<br />
system would look like do not offer compensation for the loss of conditions.<br />
Does it really matter for the incomes of working Australians? Yes.<br />
Some examples are instructive.<br />
Nurses. There are over 150,000 registered nurses in Australia. A typical<br />
nurse works enough nightshifts and weekends to increase his gr her pay<br />
above the base rate by an average of 22 per cent a year. This is worth about<br />
$ 5000 a year.<br />
Unskilled labourers. For unskilled labourers who work overtime the number<br />
of hours accorded the higher pay rate is about 10 per week. If these hours<br />
were paid at the base rate approximately one million Australian labourers<br />
would experience an income cut of about $ 5000 a year.<br />
Of Australia's 360,000 drivers who work just 8 hours of overtime, reducing the<br />
rate to that of base pay would cost them about $ 6000 a year.<br />
Bar attendants at this week's AFL Grand Final would see their wages<br />
reduced by at least $ 40 for their day's work if the penalty is removed. And if<br />
this is regular weekend work for Australia's 50,000 bar attendants, it amounts<br />
to an annual income loss of over $ 2000. </p>
<p>The Opposition call it a scare campaign. Let me tell them for the one and a<br />
half million Australians I have mentioned and that's just a start the scare<br />
campaign is coming from the Opposition. Quite simply the Opposition who<br />
like to talk about families, have a policy to take money from breadwinners.<br />
The facts speak for themselves: in a world in which there is no compensation<br />
for traded-in conditions, a great many working Australians must be at risk of<br />
losing considerable income.<br />
The Coalition's recent responses to these criticisms have themselves been<br />
instructive. Again, they do not seem to comprehend the basic realities of the Australian<br />
labour market.<br />
John Howard insists that " no worker will be forced off awards if they don't<br />
want to be".<br />
In other words, there isn't a problem. The Coalition just wants to introduce<br />
more choice for workers. There is either profound ignorance at the root of<br />
this, or profound disingenuousness. Whatever the cause, it is false.<br />
What will happen when employers say as many are sure to " take the<br />
contract or take the sack". Who has the power here? What real choices will<br />
such workers have?<br />
What happens to workers who sign a good agreement but later want to return<br />
to the award because their employer demands that they accept a new<br />
agreement with lower wages. How can workers possibly get back what they<br />
have lost?<br />
And what happens to the extraordinarily high number of workers each year<br />
who face a new employer?<br />
No political party which says that workers can choose an award if they want<br />
to really understands the extraordinary flows in the Australian labour market.<br />
Or, if they do understand, they just don't care about it.<br />
The huge number of Australians who face a new employer every year would<br />
not have an effective choice about keeping overtime or penalty rates. They<br />
would not be in a position to sustain award incomes if such conditions are<br />
traded away under the Coalition's approach.<br />
In 1994 1,731,500 Australians more than 20 per cent of the workforce<br />
faced a new employer for a wage and salary job. Currently over 42 per cent<br />
of the workforce has been in their current job for less than 3 years. </p>
<p>They are surely a significant part of this debate; because they are the people<br />
who will be confronted with the injunction take the contract or forget the job.<br />
In other words, under a Coalition government federal award system, and<br />
adding those under conservative state awards, millions of working Australians<br />
could lose valuable conditions and pay.<br />
The numbers are not difficult to believe. After all, there are around 600,000<br />
higher education students today and most of them will face a new employer in<br />
the next 3 years.<br />
Of the 400,000 or so year 11 and 12 students currently enrolled in school, at<br />
least half will be in this position.<br />
Every year several hundred thousand married women re-enter the labour<br />
force in search of new jobs.<br />
And in 1994, 600,000 employed people chose to change jobs.<br />
The argument is clear. The Coalition can radically and quickly put at risk the<br />
hard won wages of a very large number of Australians.<br />
This is already happening under the Western Australian legislation. Howard<br />
and Reith say their approach is " softly softly", but Howard and Reith know<br />
that the forces in the labour market make a mockery of this.<br />
Australians know the value of change, and recognise the need for efficiency<br />
and competitiveness in our economy. But they also know the equation is<br />
more complex than the Coalition would have us believe. They know, I am<br />
sure, that the Accord is the expression the civilised expression of that<br />
equation. And I don't believe they'll let it go.<br />
If I am right in saying that Australians prefer cooperation to conflict and<br />
continue to value our traditions of equity and fairness, they will reject the<br />
Opposition's industrial relations policy. They may well be glad to see that<br />
they have a policy but they will not be impressed by the nature of it.<br />
They believe, I think, that equality and fairness are fundamental to Australia's<br />
way of life, and they know that workplace arrangements and award<br />
protections are an important means of delivering them.<br />
If labour productivity growth were low, and the Coalition model was a proven<br />
way of raising it, it would be understandable. But Australian labor<br />
productivity growth is twice that of the place where their model is employed<br />
New Zealand. </p>
<p>If there is no efficiency case for change, Australians have cause to wonder<br />
why it is that they should risk hard won workplace incomes. Why it is that our<br />
fundamental identification with a fair go and social and economic equality<br />
should be put at risk?<br />
The Australia we have created through the Accord mechanisms is a place to<br />
be proud of. Robert Reich, the United States Secretary of Labor has recently<br />
lamented that in his country, while employment growth is healthy, they have<br />
created vast numbers of working poor.<br />
On the other side of the Atlantic, while there are sophisticated safety nets, the<br />
countries of Western Europe have poor jobs growth records. They envy the<br />
US for this, while Reich envies these countries their relatively low levels of<br />
poverty. In Australia we have the best of both worlds. It is clearly to a significant<br />
extent because of the Accord processes.<br />
I take you back to my theme. Our success in this partnership springs from<br />
the belief we share that the incomes of all working Australians must be<br />
protected. I wish you well in this Congress, and trust that I will be able to address you at<br />
your next one by which time I hope that collectively we have put to rest for<br />
all time the aspirations of those who seek to put Australia on the path to<br />
conflict, inequality and social injustice.<br />
Watch this space, we won't let you down. </p>
