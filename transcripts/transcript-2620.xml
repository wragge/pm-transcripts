I PRIME MINISTER<br />
VISIT TO INDONESIA, SINGAPORE AND MALAYSIA<br />
STATE DINNER<br />
KUALA LUMPUR<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, The Rt Hon.<br />
William McMahon, M. P. 12 JUNE 1972<br />
Mr Prime Minister, Mr Deputy Prime Minister, Honourable Ministers,<br />
Distinguished Guests<br />
I want, immediately, to say how pleased I am to be here again.<br />
And to express my appreciation of the welcome you have given me. I<br />
have been here before and I have a vivid recollection of my visit<br />
during the emergency in the early fifties. It is good to be back.<br />
And thank you, Sir, for your generous hosnitality tonight.<br />
In such an atmosphere we find a happy combination of dignity<br />
and informality, and that kind of onen-hearted friendship we associate<br />
with Malaysia and its peonle.<br />
Prime Minsiter, Australia and Malaysia are old friends. You<br />
mentioned this as the basis of our close and continuing co-Aperation<br />
in important fields of activity. I endorse most strongly what you<br />
have said. We have had many years of shared experience in both war and peace,<br />
and our association has solid foundations because of our membership<br />
of the Commonwealth, the similarity of our institutions, and our common<br />
security, economic and social interests.<br />
But there is more to our relations than past history. It is<br />
commonplace to say that we are facing an uncertain world. The future<br />
is always unpredictable not the least in South-East Asia, in the<br />
centre of which Malaysia lives and to which Australia is so closely<br />
bound. I belive we have the same objectives as we face these uncertainties<br />
We are indeoendent countries, each following policies which seem to us<br />
best adapted to securing our national objectives. Both of us want<br />
the countries of the region to be free and independent, sturdily based,<br />
stable and self= reliant, and socially nrogressive. Both of us wish<br />
to see them free from external threat and interference. We want them<br />
to live in harmony, and to grow in prosperity. </p>
<p>Against this background, Prime Minister, I am glad the opportunity<br />
has been presented to discuss these matters of common interest with you.<br />
I valued our private talks this morning, which I found refreshing,<br />
informative and helpful.<br />
For Australia, Sir, our national interest is clear and 3asily<br />
understood. We are not a great nower, though not a small one We<br />
pose no threat to our neighbours and have neither the aspiration nor<br />
the capacity to impose our views on them.<br />
We in Australia believe, Sir, that peace in Asia is indivisible.<br />
We look to a negotiated settlement in Vietnam which will permit the<br />
people of the South to determine their own future. Beyond that we<br />
look towards an accommodation with China based on mutual resnect and<br />
without preconditions.<br />
And we look to the day when internal subversion and insurgency<br />
will not be supported by external powers a situation in which a<br />
stable, tolerant, outward-looking Australia can continue to play a<br />
co-operative and helpful role in the South-East Asian region.<br />
Our desire, our logical and permanent interest is to have stable,<br />
reliable and prosperous neighbours with whom we may maintain close<br />
relations of mutual understanding, respect and friendship. We want<br />
our association with each other to reflect the deen community of<br />
interest between ourselves and our friends.<br />
In seeking these things I believe we can build an even closer<br />
relationshin between Australia and Aalaysia. It is also well recognised<br />
that, to achieve freedom, security, social justice and sustained<br />
progress in the region, will be a long and difficult task.<br />
The first requirement will be national strength in all its<br />
forms for that is the best deterrent to external interference.<br />
The second requirement willbe to develop co-operation between regional<br />
states. Malaysia has made a significant contribution to regional<br />
co-operation especially through its initiative in launching ASEAN,<br />
It has shown leadership in working for closer contacts between<br />
South-East Asian countries, and helping to develop an enlightened<br />
community of interest. We in Australia welcome these developments and<br />
wish your success.<br />
t this point, Prime Minister, I want to pay tribute to your own<br />
personal leadership in the imaginative policies which Malaysia has<br />
been pursuing, not only inthe international field, but also in<br />
domestic affairs, notably through the Second Malaysia Plan.<br />
Among statesmen your name stands high. We respect you, Sir,<br />
and Malaysia for the vigorous independent spirit you show.<br />
Your country is master of its own house and destiny, progressive<br />
in its ideas and resolute in its performance.<br />
Your proposal forthe neutralisation of South-East Asia under<br />
effective international guarantees is an important initiative. We<br />
see this proposal as clear evidence of your desire to work towards<br />
a free and indeoendent South-East Asia, undeterred by the complexities<br />
which inevitably are involved in such an understaking. / 3 </p>
<p>Time will show the best way to secure stability and peace,<br />
and Australia is always ready to discuss measures to help achieve<br />
those objectives.<br />
I am gratified that in our talks this morning we agreed that<br />
there are no * problems between us. Defence co-operation between<br />
Australia and Malaysia is on a sound footing. We agreed that the<br />
Five Power Defence Arrangments are the framework within which we<br />
co-operate closely and are of value to us both.<br />
I was delighted to have your assurance, Prime Minister, that<br />
the presence of Australian forces, both land and air is welcome. The<br />
arrangements are working smoothly and we are happy about them. We<br />
also agreed that the presence of Australian air force units continues<br />
to be of value to us both.<br />
It goes without saying that Australia will at all times honour<br />
its obligations. Prime Minister, there are other significant links between<br />
Australia and Malaysia which are forged by mutual national interests.<br />
The trade between our two countries has grown over recent years<br />
and we look forward to steady progress in the future, and Australian<br />
companies are learning more about Malaysia as a field of investment<br />
especially through joint ventures.<br />
You said, Prime Minister, that Malaysia would " welcome<br />
Australia as partners in your development efforts This idea of<br />
partnership is very close to our hearts in our won development Where<br />
foreign investment is concerned. And so, Sir, we hope to see<br />
increased activity in Malaysia by Australian companies in partnership<br />
with yours. There is, I know, considerable and growing interest by<br />
Australian companies in this prospect.<br />
In the area of Government-to-Government economic co-operation<br />
we have, of course, longstanding and active programmes through the<br />
Colombo Plan. and through direct bilateral arrangements.<br />
We are ready to contribute, ac'cording to your own wishes, and<br />
our own capacity, towards the success of the Second Malaysia Plan.<br />
We have always been willing to do what we can to assist Malaysia in<br />
technical expertise.<br />
To these specific links we add other associations, which may<br />
in time p~ rove to be the most imnortant of all. I refer to the education<br />
of the young people -both countries on the ways, history and culture<br />
of each other's homeland, and to the development of cultural relations.<br />
This reflects the great interest Australians are now showing<br />
in their neighbours There are many facets of this interest.<br />
But certainly a strong and stimulating influence has been the<br />
large number, now over 5,000 of Malaysians students in Australia.<br />
To this I add the increasing number of businessmen and tourists<br />
moving between our countries. Thisj helps to promote understanding<br />
' between our people and yours in human terms and has, of course, direct<br />
-Dractical benefit. ./ 4 </p>
<p>4.<br />
For it is 7* hen the friendships of Government are backed by<br />
friendships among the people that we get a relationship of enduring<br />
value, and rich in the-benefits it conveys to all.<br />
I believe, Sir, Malaysia and Australia should always walk the<br />
ways f Deace together.<br />
I believe that the ideals we share are those that unite. And<br />
that in giving them free expression, each according to our national<br />
responsibilities and resources, we can help to build a better world.<br />
I thank you, Prime Minister, for the honour you do my country<br />
tonight. TAnd now I should like to propose a toast to your health<br />
and to the friendship of our two countries. </p>
