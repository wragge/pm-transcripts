FOR PRESS PM No. 36/ 1971<br />
INTERNATIONAL YEAR FOR ACTION TO COMBRAT RACISM<br />
The Prime M/ inister, Mr. William McMahon, said today that the year<br />
1971 would be observed in Australia as International Year for Action to Combat<br />
Racism and Racial Discrimination.<br />
Mr. McMahon said:<br />
" The General Assembly of the United Nations designated the year 1971<br />
as International Year for Action to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination<br />
in the same way. as it had designated 1968 as Human Rights Year and 1965 as<br />
International Co-operation Year.<br />
" Australian subscribes fully to the purpose of this Year which is to<br />
achieve significant progress in eliminating all forms and manifestations of<br />
racial discrimination. We voted in support of this resolution at the General<br />
Assembly and we are taking steps to observe it.<br />
Mr McMahon added " My Government abhors racism which is not<br />
acceptable to the Australian way of life."<br />
Mr McMahon said he was pleased that a number of non-governmental<br />
organisations intcrested in the Year had decided to set up a National Committee<br />
to organise a programme to observe it. The Commonwealth had made a grant<br />
of $ 12, 000 to the Committee to assist it with its programme. He had been informed<br />
that a major part of the Committee's work would be educational. This he felt<br />
was most important. Education through teaching and the mass media was one<br />
of the most powerful weapons to combat prejudice based on ignorance.<br />
Mr McMahon added that the Government was already a party to some of<br />
the conventions bearing upon the elimination of racial discrimination, such as<br />
the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, the<br />
1956 Convention on the Abolition of Slavery, the Slave Trade and Institutions<br />
and Practices Similar to Slavery and the UNESCO Convention against<br />
Discrimination in Education. Australia had also signed the International<br />
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and the<br />
question of ratification of that Convention was being carefully examined.<br />
Mr McMahon concluded by wishing the Committee a successful Year.<br />
He was hopeful that Australia and Australians would be able to make an effective<br />
contribution to the objectives of the Year.<br />
