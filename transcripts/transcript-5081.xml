FOR MEDIA 24 JUNE 1979<br />
ELECTORATE TALK<br />
This past week has been a lesson for the Australian nation.<br />
We hnave seen the country brought to the brink of<br />
inadustrial chaos. We have seen the whole continent<br />
fazing virtual paralysis.<br />
Fcor a great nation to be faced with such a situation has<br />
shzcked Australians who might well have asked: " Why should<br />
we * rv to tear ourselves apart in this way?"<br />
But just at a time when the situation seemed at its most<br />
hz-eles the determined efforts of men of goodwill<br />
brought results.<br />
What this past week's events have proved beyond any doubt<br />
Is that if men with responsibility put the interests of<br />
this nation first then every problem facing this nation<br />
can be solved.<br />
We have heard a good deal in the past about union bashing.<br />
This Goverrnent has been accused of wanting to bash unions.<br />
There have been wild accusations of Governments seeking<br />
to encourage and provoke industrial disputes in order, so it<br />
is alleged, to gain political advantage. These accusations<br />
are based on the most dangerous nonsense.<br />
T'he people of Australia know only too well who suffers in<br />
,= nes of strikes and industrial disruption. No-one escapes.<br />
Everyone is a victim: the working men and women of Australia,<br />
the old, the sick, the young, the disadvantaged, the poor.<br />
Business can be made bankrupt. Small businessmen in<br />
~-~ ol~ arwho haven't got%-vast resources to cushion them<br />
againstC heavy losses are the ones who can suffer most.<br />
-s against this background of the heavy loss to the nation<br />
as a wno7le that this Governument views with the gravest<br />
concern any action by any union which could lead to<br />
industrial disruption.<br />
In the lengthy discussions I have had this week with leaders<br />
of the Australian Council of Trade Unions it became obvious<br />
that efforts at conciliation can succeed even though the<br />
outlook might seem dark and pessimistic. / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
The representatives of the Australian Council of Trade Unions<br />
camne to the conference table in Canberra with a job -to do.<br />
As representatives of the industrial movement they were<br />
concerned at what they regarded as a threat to the right<br />
of assembly. As a Government we were able to sit down and<br />
have a sensible discussion with them. There was no<br />
grandstanding. The meeting produced results. Bans and<br />
threats to blockade Western Australia and to stop vital<br />
exports were lifted. It was a fine example of the way relations<br />
ought to be conducted between the union movement and the<br />
Government. This is\ the lesson we should all have learned this week.<br />
Reckless uhion action no longer has a valid place in the<br />
Australian industrial scene. The costs are too high for<br />
tn4s nation to bear. The sufferingsby ordinary people<br />
are too great. The damage to industry is too severe.<br />
We h'-ave achieved much in this country in the past three years<br />
in -a etting right the economy. There are difficulties ahead.<br />
For MAustralia to improve further her present position great<br />
eff,' ort.-s must be made. We can see how the industrialised<br />
nations overseas are facing new and serious economic problems.<br />
In -this climate it is all the more important, all the<br />
more imperative for Australia to maintain its battle against<br />
inflation, to pursue relentlessly the economic course we<br />
have taken.<br />
At a time like this it would be a national disaster for<br />
trade unions to embark on a policy of industrial disruption.<br />
We have in Australia a long-established and elaborate<br />
industrial conciliation and arbitration system. The machinery<br />
is there for all industrial disputes to be solved.<br />
It is through that system that industrial disputes can<br />
and should be solved. There are still problems to be dealt<br />
with. One of these concerns the differences which can arise<br />
bazween State and Feder&amp; 1 awards. That is why this week<br />
th'e Federal Government offered to explore the possibility<br />
of States referring to the Federal Government the States'<br />
powers in industrial affairs, if only for a trial period.<br />
In so many disputes,-people believe the Federal Government has<br />
p-7.7e and resnonsibility when in fact the Dower and responsibility<br />
presently belongs to the State.<br />
T~ of ths Government is to achieve industrial peace<br />
tnscounitry. We know, as all Australians know, that only<br />
-througn industrial peace can the people of this country achieve<br />
the prosperity thef seek. The people of: Australia are sick and<br />
tired of strikes and stoppages, of hold-ups and lost pay.<br />
There is another way. A much better way. This Government will<br />
pursue that way with all the strength and influence at its<br />
disposal. I ask all Australians to follow us along the path<br />
to industrial peace. It is a time for all Australians to work<br />
together. 000---</p>
