SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON. E. G. WHITLAM, M. P.,<br />
AT THE LAUNCHING OF<br />
" GRAB FOR POWER"<br />
BY LAURIE OAKES AND DAVID SOLOMON<br />
9 DECEMBER 1974<br />
Reminding this distinguished gathering and<br />
also all those who listen to and view the media how much<br />
my Government has meant to the publishing industry.<br />
When I first tarted launching books at the request of<br />
the Australian publishers the books were printed overseas.<br />
The Australians were the authors but the printers and the<br />
publishers were not. On this occasion there are distinguishedI<br />
Australian writers, authors and skilled printers and, I trust,<br />
prosperous-publishers.<br />
It's the " Grab for Power" the book is called.<br />
Another from the tree of Oakes and Solomon. Some people may<br />
see a similarity between the events which precipitated this<br />
latest tome and the present time. Nothing is so dead as<br />
last weekA scandal. Anybody reading this book will see how<br />
issues which were regarded as overwhelming, at the outset of<br />
the campaign, whie/ proper grabs for power are made, how<br />
they can be transmuted in the hands of skilled practitioners<br />
during the campaign. The public gets a sense of proportion.<br />
The public sees what are the alternatives. They have to see<br />
not only the faults of the incumbents but the deficiencies<br />
of the challengers. This book is, I'm certain,. bound to be read by a<br />
very great number of people, from all walks of life.<br />
It is a fascinating story. Racily written, an exciting<br />
story. At the same time it is a substantial work of research<br />
and there will be young and old read about it, there will<br />
be professors reading it and ofcourse sayin g how much better<br />
they would have done it themselves, and I suppose if you<br />
can wait for decades that may be true. And there will<br />
be aspiring politicians who will say how much better they<br />
would have done it, achieved it or avoided it. I would<br />
like to pay tribute'to the authors, because I've never </p>
<p>I would like to paC t::. rhute to) hLo; h<br />
because I. have never known opeople to work so thoroughly and<br />
api: ly as Oakes and Solomon, They're very much -etter<br />
authors of books than interpr:..:-ers in the cdii;. papers.<br />
You can always rely on yesterdayi s paper beinc-li; carded,<br />
nobody can find it. But books like this endure' Thy will<br />
He around for a long time, and I believe it will stand the<br />
passage of time.<br />
There are similarities, aren't there between what<br />
people thought were the circumstances of last April and<br />
what some people think are the circumstances of today.<br />
But I think the Australian people have learnt from two<br />
aspects of the events of last April and May. The people<br />
who grabbed for power last April thought that Australians<br />
didn't know what went on in the rest of the world. They<br />
thought we were still an isolated, insular, backward<br />
people. In fact Australians, largely due to the press,<br />
are now aware of what goes on in other parts of-the world.<br />
They know that Australia isn't so different from other<br />
countries, that in fact all the countries in which<br />
Australians are interested are very similar to Australiasocially,<br />
politically and economically. We all influence<br />
each other. And this is a process which is going to become<br />
more marked instead of less marked. All the things which<br />
appal people, distress people and I dare say, in the next<br />
couple of months will make many people hysterical, are<br />
also being found in other countries the countries that<br />
people visit in the course of their duties. The countries<br />
which people should study. The countries with which wer<br />
trade. The countries with which we compare ourselves.<br />
Appail-ng unemployment figures in Australia at the moment,<br />
but not as bad as in North America or most countries of<br />
western Europe or Japan. And the measures which I announced<br />
a month ago ad some which I will be announcing, not directly<br />
face to face, orally as I am speaking to you now, but in<br />
a prepared statement, will I am sure convince you that in<br />
these matters Australia is not only still more successful<br />
than any comparable country but in fact is taking steps </p>
<p>-3-<br />
which will mean that the position will improve improve<br />
markedly be seen to improve and be certainly very much<br />
betterbefore any other grab can be achieved.<br />
There's another lesson I believe we have to draw<br />
in addition to that concerning the similarities of conditions<br />
in Australia and those in North America, Western Europe and<br />
Japan and that is the sheer impropriety of what was done<br />
politically last April. Some people believe that having<br />
done it once, even though they didn't get away with it,<br />
they should or could do it again. I don't believe that<br />
Australians are impressed with those who still seek to<br />
destroy the system, t. o make it unworkable. In April,<br />
in May, nobody sought a mandate to use the Senate against<br />
either side which succeeded in getting a majority in the<br />
House of Representatives. There are often references to<br />
mandates. Mandates apparently are sometimes doubted when<br />
they're in the hands of those who win. But people, it<br />
would be extraordinary if it were held that mandates are<br />
in the hands of those who didn't succeed in getting enough<br />
seats. Now last April and last May the campaign was to<br />
form a Government and the Government was returned. There<br />
was never any threat, at that time, by the challengers<br />
that if they didn't get a majority in the House of<br />
Representatives they would still try to achieve a<br />
combination in the Senate which would thwart the side which<br />
got the majority in the House of Representatives. No mandate<br />
was sought, nobody came clean then and yet that apparently is<br />
the threat which is being held now. If you lose twice you<br />
can still destroy the system. Now of course it is difficult<br />
to govern in Australia now, it is difficult to govern in<br />
any comparable country, there is no head of government anywhere<br />
in the Western world and for that purpose one includes Japan,<br />
Australia and New Zealand who can rest securely or serenely.<br />
The system is under challenge everywhere., whether it is a<br />
system of divided powers, such as in the United States or<br />
whether it is a system of Presidential powers, such as in<br />
France or whether it is a Westminster system as in Britain<br />
itself or in Australia or in New Zealand. In all these systems<br />
there is immense stress and we jeopardise the system at our<br />
peril because in each case there ir a history, there are some </p>
<p>-4-<br />
traditions, there are some conventions which have made the<br />
system work and those who jeopardise the system have nothing*<br />
to put in its place. These are serious matters. I sometimes4<br />
on these occasionsA,, fl somewhat more flippant. But I expect<br />
you expect me to say something rather more serious because<br />
there are economic and there are Political matters arising<br />
from last April from which we should all learn. It is important<br />
that the political system in Australia should be effective.<br />
It should be seen to be effective, socially and economically<br />
and those who grab power and fail, those who do not get the<br />
support * of the people at an election should not try to make<br />
the system unworkable thereafter. We are ending a year<br />
in the Australian Parliament where some bills have had to be<br />
debated seven times before they have gone through. Seven times,<br />
three times in each House and at a Joint Sitting. ( unclear)<br />
Joint Sitting is held and the inevitable results flow from all<br />
six bills which came before it after six debates . before being<br />
debated at the Joint Sitting, Since that time there have been<br />
eleven more bills passed by the House of Representatives and<br />
rejected by the Senate and in most cases those bills were<br />
precisely stated in the policy speech of the Government party<br />
last April. Ladies and Gentlemen , this grab for power should<br />
be a very salutary lesson to all. For whateitver polls may say<br />
and there was a Western Australian poll a couple of weeks<br />
before the grab was made-and whatever the economics, statistics<br />
and indices may show-and they were deteriorating last March and<br />
last april whaterver ephemeral scand als may emerge and be<br />
blown up. The fact in that the grab failed ( unclear) and that<br />
any further grab is similar circumstances or ciruinstances which<br />
people thought similar, circumstances which blow some people's<br />
tops, any similar grabs~ imilarly will fail. Its al-la question<br />
of how soon Oakes and Solomon write the next book. I am satisfied<br />
that I will be launching it and in the same happy circumstances.<br />
I congratulate the authors, printers and the publishers and<br />
I am certain there will be thousands of readers for Christmas and<br />
in the following years who will enjoy am happy<br />
to contribute to it somehow. It has at least solved my<br />
Christmas problem anyway. </p>
