    <content><![CDATA[<p>As we enter the final sitting week before the winter recess, the Government is getting on with delivering our plan for a strong, prosperous economy and a safe, secure Australia.</p>
<p>The past week has been a week of achievement for the Australian people.</p>
<p>Last Monday, the Parliament passed the small business tax cut and instant asset write-off. Our Jobs and Small Business Package is about recognising and rewarding Australia’s two million small businesses.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, we secured Senate support for our plan to make pensions fairer and more sustainable and under this plan, 170,000 pensioners with modest assets will receive an extra $30 a fortnight from January 2017.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, <a href="http://liberal.us4.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=23ba888bf167d9d4256c7e86c&amp;id=d58b3ac4e0&amp;e=52c88b8fc6" target="_blank">we signed the Free Trade Agreement with China</a>. This will benefit everyone by adding billions of dollars and thousands of new jobs to our economy.</p>
<p>And on Thursday, the Government launched a White Paper on northern development, setting out our plan for jobs, investment and infrastructure in Northern Australia over the next 20 years.</p>
<p>This week, the Government will introduce legislation to strip citizenship from dual nationals who fight with terrorists.</p>
<p>On this, there is a fundamental difference between the Government and the Labor Party.</p>
<p>Labor’s Shadow Attorney-General says about foreign fighters that “you should get them back here”. </p>
<p>Well, this Government is doing everything it can to keep these terrorists out of Australia. </p>
<p>If you fight with terrorists or plot against Australia and are a dual national, you should forfeit your Australian citizenship.</p>
<p>It’s a simple principle and one that Australians overwhelmingly support.</p>
<p>As well, in the coming week, I will be giving further details about the Government’s work to strengthen our defence force and prepare it for the future.</p>
<p>This Government is working hard to deliver the stronger Australia that we all want.</p>
<p>21 June 2015</p>
