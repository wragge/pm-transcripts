    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Australian and Tasmanian Governments have today agreed to extend the Tasmanian Regional Forest Agreement (RFA) for a further two decades.</p>
<p>Tasmania’s forests have long been the lifeblood of the state, providing jobs and economic opportunities to thousands.</p>
<p>However protecting the state’s unique environment has always been important to ensure that Tasmania’s forests can continue to be enjoyed by the community for generations to come.</p>
<p>The Tasmanian RFA strikes the right balance between economic development and environmental protection.</p>
<p>The agreement provides long term job security for thousands of Tasmanian families who rely on a sustainably managed forest industry for employment.</p>
<p>More than 3600 Tasmanians are currently employed by the forestry industry and we want to ensure it continues to create more employment opportunities for future generations.</p>
<p>Critically, this deal ensures the whole community can still continue to enjoy the immeasurable benefits of Tasmania’s forests.</p>
<p>Threatened species and the rich wilderness of Tasmanian forests continue to be protected through a comprehensive system of reserves covering more than half of Tasmania’s land area, delivering some of the highest biodiversity protection in the world.</p>
<p>The extended agreement will deliver a number of improvements to the RFA framework, including:</p>
<ul><li>rolling five-year extensions, subject to performance and review</li>
<li>a more outcomes-focused review process—in line with international indicators and consistent with Australian and Tasmanian government State of the Forests Reports</li>
<li>the inclusion of clauses on matters of national environmental significance, as defined by the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (Cth).</li>
</ul><p>The Turnbull and Hodgman Governments are committed to securing and creating job opportunities for all Tasmanians while ensuring the protection of the state’s rich environment.</p>
