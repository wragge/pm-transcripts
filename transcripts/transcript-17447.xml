<p>The leaders supported ongoing work to reform international financial institutions including the recent move by the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors to reform the IMF to give greater weight to emerging and developing economies.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister said the leaders were in agreement of the need for national reconciliation in Burma and the importance of free and fair elections.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister announced a number of new initiatives funded from the official development assistance budget, as part of Australia's contribution to the summit's objective to improve regional development and integration. These included:</p>
<p> * 	$32 million to combat emerging infectious diseases and pandemics in the Asia Pacific.<br />
 * 	$10 million for disaster response initiatives.<br />
 * 	7,500 Australia Award scholarships for students from EAS countries to study in Australia over the next four years.<br />
 * 	The creation of an Australian Chair of Ecology and Environment Studies at the Nalanda University, which is currently being built in India as a regional centre of learning. The Australian Chair will undertake regional research into environmental issues particularly in the areas of climate change and natural resource management.</p>
<p>Following the East Asia Summit, the Prime Minister co-chaired a special Australia-ASEAN Summit meeting with the leaders of the 10 ASEAN countries.</p>
<p>At this meeting the Prime Minister highlighted the importance of the Australia New Zealand ASEAN Free Trade Agreement and the continued need for regional discussions in the areas of finance, climate change, development assistance, education and disaster management.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister announced several new initiatives to help promote human rights and development in the region including:</p>
<p> * 	$132 million towards improved infrastructure in the Greater Mekong Subregion<br />
 * 	$10 million to support the International Labour Organisation to reduce the exploitation of labour migrants.<br />
 * 	Training support for the new ASEAN Inter-Governmental Commission on Human Rights.</p>
