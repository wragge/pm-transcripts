FOUNDATION STONE CEREMONY AT THE<br />
BETH RIVKAH LADIES' COLLEGE SADIE ELLINSON<br />
SECONDARY SCHOOL,<br />
MELBOURNE. 12 MAY 1968<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton<br />
Mr. President, Parliamentary colleagues, ladies and gentlemen:<br />
It is for me the second occasion in quite a short time that<br />
I have had the pleasure and the honour of speaking to Australians who<br />
are of Jewish descent or of the Jewish faith. Not long ago, I had a<br />
similar opportunity in the Town Hall in Sydney, and there I said, as I<br />
will now repeat, because your Headmistress mentioned something<br />
concerning debts that any debts that are owed by people of the Jewish<br />
faith to Australia, are reciprocated by debts from Australians to people<br />
of the Jewish faith who in the First and in the Second World War, and<br />
indeed in the present troubles which beset our nation, are taking their<br />
full place as Australians as they should, and as they are, and Madam<br />
Headmistress, the books are completely balanced, if indeed there is in<br />
these things to be talk of balances.<br />
But I am here to congratulate you on opening here today<br />
not opening on continuing the growth here today of your independent<br />
schools. There was a time when it was a common occurrence for me to<br />
appear at the opening of independent schools, particularly if they had<br />
anything to do with science blocks, but this has recently been interrupted<br />
and it is a pleasure to come back again to have the opportunity to see the<br />
growth taking place here in the centre of this community.<br />
I do not need to expand upon my own beliefs concerning<br />
the value of independent schools, and indeed in this congregation, in this<br />
gathering, there is no need for me to do so because there is nobody who<br />
needs to be converted. If it were not true that you all believe that it was<br />
proper and right for those who wished to do so to graft on to the education<br />
that is given by a State the particular beliefs and particular teachings and<br />
particular spiritual inheritances which you wish your children to have,<br />
then you would not have done what you have done and made this school<br />
possible. But, of course, in schools such as this throughout the<br />
countryside, it is necessary not only that there should be great academic<br />
attainments, and I think you will agree when you look at the figures, that<br />
this school has shown great academic attainments, academic attainment<br />
in those subjects required by a State education system but also that it<br />
should, as I know it does, inculcate those beliefs, those spiritual<br />
sustenances about which I shall have a little more to say later on. It<br />
teaches not only academic subjects, not only the requirements of<br />
spiritual beliefs, but what is in fact the great strength and joy in Australia,<br />
that whether people are of Scottish descent and the Presbyterian faith or<br />
of Irish descent and the Roman Catholic faith, or of English descent and<br />
adhere to the Church of England, or of Jewish descent and adhere to the<br />
Jewish faith, yet they are all Australians in the one community, working<br />
together for the one ultimate objective, that all of them may maintain<br />
their faith without fear, that all of them may inculcate that which I believe<br />
is one of the major things this faculty in this school seeks to inculcate, and<br />
that is a faith in the individual human spirit, the individual man, a belief<br />
that that is the cornerstone alone on which a great and enduring<br />
civilisation can be built. / 2 </p>
<p>2.<br />
But what a doubly special occasion it must be for you, for<br />
here just a short time ago, there was the celebration of the twentieth<br />
anniversary of the re-founding, the re-establishment not the<br />
establishment of the State of Israel. just as those others of whom I<br />
have previously spoken can look back as Australians to the lands from<br />
which they came, and can remember the deeds their forefathers did, and<br />
can remember the struggles in those countries, so can you now look back<br />
to such a land. And looking back, remember for the teaching of the young,<br />
so that the future may be maintained in freedom, of what happened over<br />
the 2, 000 years since Israel ceased to be a State in its own right; look<br />
back upon a nation which being conquered kept faith, kept bright its<br />
spiritual ideals and because of that had its holy places defiled and its<br />
temples torn down and its peoples dispersed to the four corners of the<br />
earth, and there being dispersed, still keeping faith, still keeping a<br />
dream of a country which would one day be re-established, still keeping<br />
t~ ie beliefs which to them were beliefs for which one lived or which, if<br />
one revoked, one died either physically or spirfitually, still keepipg those<br />
beliefs, were forced into separate communities in the countries in which<br />
they lived, were persecuted, were massacred, had all that could be done<br />
to destroy them done to them, at least in many of those countries in which,<br />
homeless themselves, they sought to make their homes.<br />
All through this period of time was kept not only this belief<br />
in the inherent importance of the individual man, not only this belief in<br />
the overriding importance of the spiritual existence of a man as against<br />
his material existence, but also the seed of a dream of some day which<br />
would come when just as others can look back to lands from which their<br />
forefathers came as still a country, so could the people of Israel, as<br />
they hoped, look back to the land from which they came, their forefathers<br />
came. And this happened, and this came to pass. This has been protected,<br />
and even though today Israel is still under the shadow of attack, under<br />
the shadow of threat. Ihere must come a time when the whole of that<br />
area of the Middle East will agree: " Here is a place in which there are<br />
Arab States, in whiczh there is the State of Israel. By working together<br />
economically, by co-operating with each other, by recognising the<br />
inalienable existence of each other, surely we can do more for the people<br />
living there than by living in a state of tension and of febrile argument<br />
which now pervades the region. And I think that day will come.<br />
The first step towards it must be a willingness for those<br />
from the Arab States and those from the State of Israel to sit down and<br />
talk over the problem which now exists and come to a reasonable<br />
agreement on how this matter can be settled. It has been of some surprise<br />
to me that for a long time I have heard, when international disputes have<br />
broken out: " Sit down and talk about a solution of matters in Korea. Sit<br />
down and talk about the solution of the fighting in Malaya. Sit down and<br />
talk about the solution of the fighting in Vietnam". I haven't heard enough<br />
about: " Sit down and talk about the threat which is now posed to the State<br />
of Israel", and yet it is essential that this should be done, and while my<br />
Government cannot do much towards it, it will urge it, it will support<br />
it, it will do all it can to see it comes about.<br />
Then you, and the children that you will educate here,<br />
in the school you are building will have a country not one, I hope, that<br />
will attuact first fealty, but a country in which you can have pride, will<br />
have a country from which you can say: " Our traditions sprang", a<br />
country in which you can say: " Our faith is centred, and you look<br />
there, as Australians, just as 1, perhaps, as an Australian would look<br />
to England from which my parents came. / 3 </p>
<p>This, I think, will be helped by schools such as this. When<br />
we walked in, we heard a choir singing " Open to us the Gates of<br />
Righteousness". I don't think I quite understood the words. They were<br />
translated to me, but this is what I am told they were singing. And it is<br />
for schools such as this a major task to open to children the " Gates of<br />
Righteousness" and to show them that the " Gates of Righteousness", as<br />
all gates, need to be guarded without hatred of those who seek to break<br />
them down. This is all I wish to say now. I think it was one of your<br />
great writers who said something like this: " A miracle does not prove<br />
that which is impossible. A miracle merely confirms that something in<br />
fact was possible". There are many things we now think impossible.<br />
There are many things we think it may require a miracle to change, but<br />
it won't require a miracle, it will just require a belief that in fact things<br />
we think are impossible are possible, and they will then be achieved,<br />
just as this school has been achieved, as other schools will be achieved,<br />
and as I hope and trust and pray, in the Middle East, a safe, progressive<br />
area will be created in which the State of Israel will play its full and<br />
proper part. </p>
