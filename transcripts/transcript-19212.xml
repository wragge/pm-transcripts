<p>The Gillard Government will donate $350,000 to The Salvation Army's 46th Annual Red Shield Appeal.</p>
<p>The donation comes ahead of the start of the 2013 Red Shield Appeal, held over the weekend of 25 and 26 May, when thousands of Salvos and volunteers will be doorknocking across the nation.</p>
<p>The Red Shield Appeal is the Salvos' major fundraising avenue and the money collected through the appeal enables the Salvos to continue their invaluable work assisting Australians in need.</p>
<p>Each year more than one million Australians access the range of services provided by the Salvos, including emergency relief during disasters, aged care, children's services like Christmas gifts and camps, and housing for women and children affected by domestic violence.</p>
<p>The Gillard Government is working hard to alleviate homelessness, strengthen crisis services, support vulnerable people with financial and social support and improve housing affordability to prevent homelessness from occurring.</p>
<p>Yet, the sad fact remains that across the nation 2,250 people rely on The Salvation Army for accommodation each and every night.</p>
<p>The Salvos are an integral part of Australia's not-for-profit sector and a major partner in delivering the Australian Government's vision for a more socially inclusive nation.</p>
<p>The Salvation Army is helping us get support to the people who need it the most  -  from financial counselling for women in crisis, to delivering early intervention services for children and families in disadvantaged communities.</p>
<p>We encourage all Australians to give what they can to this year's Red Shield Appeal when the Salvos come knocking on your door. </p>
