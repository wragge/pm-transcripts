Prime Minister Julia Gillard, New Zealand Prime Minister John Key and Tertiary Education Minister, Senator Chris Evans today met students from Christchurch who have spent the past four months studying at Adelaide University at the generosity of the local community.</p>
<p>When Canterbury University's main buildings were damaged in February's devastating earthquake, University of Adelaide Vice-Chancellor Professor James McWha responded by offering to host students at their university, free of charge.</p>
<p>Some 170 first and second year undergraduate students studying Arts, Science, Commerce and Marketing have been warmly embraced by university staff and students, living on campus and in home stay arrangements.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister congratulated the people of Adelaide for their selfless generosity in Christchurch's hour of need.</p>
<p>The friendships formed between the students are testament to the enduring bond between Australia and New Zealand.</p>
<p>This is a great illustration of the genuine and enduring connection between our countries that is fostered by our ANZAC heritage but is shared across the Tasman in so many ways.</p>
<p>Through the generosity of the Adelaide University community, the New Zealand students have experienced everything from AFL and Rugby Sevens matches to orchestra concerts and vineyard tours. </p>
