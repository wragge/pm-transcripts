QUESTIONS BRISBANE PRESS CLUB FRIDAY 29 NOVT'', E 1 7<br />
Q ' irto use one of your own phrases, is the melia<br />
giving Labor a fair go taki ng into account that some of your<br />
colleagues have accused the media of indulging in Labor<br />
bashing0<br />
1HITLAM el I I've not made tha* allegation. I do agree<br />
that editorially we do not of course get as fair a go as the<br />
Liberals and the Country Party or the National Party. I've<br />
made no general allegation about that at 4all and I suppose<br />
I am one of that mi nority of the population that reads<br />
editorials at all.<br />
Q Bime Minister could you c.: mment on the announcement<br />
today by Mr Lewis The NSW Premier elect that the QLD and NSW<br />
Governments propose a council of state governments to<br />
coordinate a campaign for state rights.<br />
PM Yes, I was fascinated by this I gather they<br />
are goin to establish a central body to crush centralism.<br />
No whatever there may be about the way the Federal 2arl. is<br />
elected however unequal electorates may be in the Federal<br />
Parliamennt they are not nearly as unequal as they are in every<br />
mainland b -te parliament and I do not believe th't the people<br />
of Aust. wouÃ± d accept that the state parlia, ents are as<br />
democratic as the Federal Parliament. The Federal Par'. iar.<br />
could be more deiocratic if the electoral systeom vas applied<br />
more , qually as for instance it is in the United States. But<br />
the I-Etates are a blot on Australian democacy the wiy they<br />
are .'. eced. You now in this city and in every rincial<br />
city in the State votes are worth only 2/ 3rds sometimes (_, Iy<br />
1/ 3rd of L other votes are worth in othe-pvarts of the itnt<br />
And the most distant^ ii this State, Mt Isa, has on of the<br />
largest enrolments in the bigger than most of the<br />
electorates in 3risbane. So wl. 4+ comes to lettin,; the peo-pi'<br />
decide what sort of government they will hive I do* n't believe<br />
the people would prefer for one minute the state parliaments<br />
of this country to the Federal Parliament. Despi. e all the<br />
faults of the Fedecal Parliament m it's much closer to the people,<br />
it represents more accurately the views of the people, than any<br />
w~ </p>
<p>of the mainland parliaments. Furthermore I eliv . hat the Statesand<br />
this State is a conspicuous example showed tiemselvcs unable<br />
to look after Australian resources, showed themselves unable to<br />
innkxazkfr provide opportunities for their citizens. You only have<br />
to, look at ( what my Govt, my Ministershave been able to achieve<br />
as regards exports. Three times as much is now being recei ved<br />
for every ton of coal af exported from QLD than was the case when<br />
we came into power. This wasn't done by your state govt., it wasn't<br />
done by any other state govt. It was done by a national govt.<br />
at last doing what national govts in every other part of the world<br />
i doing. I mentioned coal, but the same applies to every other<br />
natural resource which we export. At last you have a national govt<br />
which does lookk after these things. The state govts alsways had<br />
the power to do it ., ut they would fall over backwards in crawling<br />
to powerful companies overseas companies too! Overseas companies<br />
have no respect for that. But they will cooperate with a govt.<br />
such as mine which also looks after the nation's interests. Not<br />
only coal but also iron ore, uranium and natural gas. All the things<br />
which are our greatest assets after our skiled population are getting<br />
a very much better rturn than any state govt was able to get for them.<br />
And when you look round at the places where most people live in this<br />
c , try what hai been, public tranport or sewerage if I may<br />
mention it at table or any of the things-schools and honlth centres<br />
that new suburbs that new growth centres need. What had been done<br />
before we ' ide it possible for s mething to be done about itl i<br />
don't believt people will give anything but a 3ronx cheer for thi<br />
very belated initiative a central body to crush the cent. im.<br />
Q the PM aware that according to latest Dept of Labour<br />
figures Tasmania in fact has the highest unemployment in Aust.<br />
And ' 11 the PM explain why umemployd fr,' m throi -' it Aust are<br />
coming to QLD to fill the large number of job vacancies here thus<br />
creating ' naccurate unemployment picture in QLD quite contrary<br />
to the situatiu. as outlined by the PM a few minut s ago.<br />
P. M. It is true that is quite a number of vc. ung a<br />
in the far south and the far north of the state.-the ' old Coast an'<br />
the Tableland Kuranda and so on. That is true but tj,: y are on"<br />
pockets. I believe I accurately stated the situation that isyou<br />
hive the opportunity to create a very great deal of employment in<br />
QLD if you only accept the offers which other govts Labor and Liberal-<br />
/ 3<br />
i </p>
<p>-3-<br />
have seen fit to accept.<br />
Q Two years on Monday you came to power amid I would st. y<br />
high hopes even in QLD of a new visionary govt for Aust. Many of<br />
your voters are obviously now upset by high unemployment in all<br />
states, inflation, and high interest rates. As the man who gave us<br />
that new vision for Aust will you please tell us and the voters<br />
what you feel has gone wrong and how you feel about it personally.'<br />
P. M. r am naturally very disappointed indeed that these<br />
circumstances have arisen. I know and everyone who takes the least<br />
interest in it knows that it is not an Australian phenomenon alone<br />
There is no country in the Western world which does not have very<br />
much worse inflation than it ha: d two years ago. Certainly Australia<br />
has. AsixatiaR The same as every other ' estern. country. And this<br />
is of course a great disappointment a great frustration. And no<br />
one of course iS very popular because of it. But I am satisfied<br />
that the peo'ple whenever there is an election of the House of<br />
Representatives will realize that we at least have some positive<br />
programs. , ie hove achieved a very great , umber of them and our<br />
opponents aire doing nothing but nitpicking. They are narks. They<br />
are thoroughly negative. I'here is no program that our opponents<br />
have put up which bears in any way upon these things which affect<br />
Australir % xxnaharand all othe r countries. Now there are-some<br />
people iho ' ij-k that it muight be possible to insulate us fro<br />
rest of the world. You can't do that in Australia. ar,<br />
great trading country. We are the twelfth largest tradi uI VOL ry<br />
overall in the world, and proportionately I doub. if there is anothe<br />
country which engages so much i overseas ra. 1 as Australia. Nou<br />
in ,1', ose circmst. nces it is impossible for us to ' ve to ourselv,<br />
That _ s e are all infecting eachotherif you linii , wt. These vii ' o<br />
of unemployment and inflation. I am satisfied that we fe<br />
taken steps, -teps which have the earliest effect ossib. Le-L,<br />
there is not way t at you will get an emmediate effect_, but we hitsken<br />
tsteps which will hav.. he earliest effect pos: ible ' nd I 1.<br />
have every confidence that by tn ' le of next year re i.<br />
been able to reverse quite markedly the unemployment situation and<br />
even the inflation situation. a " 4 </p>
<p>-4-<br />
Q As a democrat Sir, and as a d. oclu' Jy ecl d<br />
Prime Ministee With a majority far greater than Bjelk-orseiins<br />
sd is ever Llikely to be, you have taken a nyimb. of ans for<br />
which you have a mandate at the last election and the previous<br />
election on/ tari u Ss wich many people have admlired you for<br />
and admird your courage for taking against the views of some other<br />
pressures groups and lobbies. Would you agree that no lobby, not<br />
even a trade union lobby, represented by Mr Hawle, has the right to<br />
dictate to the Government what it should or should not do.<br />
IP. M. I agree with you conpleely there. No lobby should<br />
dictate or I believe will dictate to us. You've mentioned tariffs<br />
in particular. One of the remarkable things is the way tha. t trad( e<br />
unionists in some industries cooper te readily with employers and<br />
they are not always australian employers to ncrew the public<br />
That ' it is amazing how trade unionists who are comsumers, in very<br />
great numbersand employers who are marginal consumers get together<br />
to make the Australian public Kxxnxy pay very. much more for their<br />
goods. This is an extraorglinarily difficultto be economically<br />
rational in protection or tariff matters because there is a long<br />
standing feeling in Australia ever since the Depression that high<br />
tafiffs are the way to make numberous jobs. Tariffs a4' cct some<br />
industries and not others. They affect some com! panies and not ot er<br />
compa:,. es in the one industry. For instance no-one in Holdens or<br />
Fords cqi. -eally blame tariffs, but at Leylands they did. The-i. re<br />
all producing the same sort of thing. Now if the tariffs wc<br />
responsible for one company having trouble you would thii<br />
would also be respo! sibl. for othc cn:. ipani s h! ving: the a,-e trel,<br />
But there wasn't the same trouble. The 9reat thiing that we have<br />
be-r in mind is that a country thLit has gre t natural ;.-esouces awe<br />
rid a country which h s a sma ll but highly , ialifi. i and<br />
healtity, literate numerate population ought to conicentra on i<br />
strength u it is quite foolish for us to spend very :. ich n<br />
on some produ which we can get of good quality just as<br />
quality cheaper from , ee as. There are man.; more things of<br />
course which we ought to coi: -toe, on which we c .1 pr , uce<br />
efficiently and cheaply than any peoile outside and ' here we c:<br />
compete with other countries. Some people in the trade unions, n<br />
less than among employers, are doing their very best to scre tihe<br />
consumer. Now it is very easy for trade unionists to speak up and<br />
they have in Mr IIawke a very effective spokesman. And some employers<br />
sometimes have 4 very effective spokesmen. But unfortunately </p>
<p>consumers do not have effec.. ive spo , esmen. You ' t ot, c-, r: Jumers<br />
to get together and put their case. Now the publjc as a<br />
result of that. Having said that i must concede tinat it is<br />
extraordinarily difficult to say to eeople who are being laid<br />
off at Leylands that they should view with equanimity a few thousand<br />
cars coming fully built up on the wharves three miles away. You<br />
can't expect people to accept that situation and we have acted to<br />
correct it because the igports doubled in one year. '' ell you h-ve<br />
got to moderate that sort of thin;. Nevertheless the long thing<br />
which we have to bear in mind in Australia is that we need to use<br />
our human skills in relation to our natural resources to -roduce<br />
what we need ourselves and to sell what we can compete in selling<br />
in other countries. That is the best way for us to be prosperous.<br />
It is quite absurd for us to be making as many refrigerators, as<br />
many motor cars, as many TV sets as say the United States or<br />
West Germany. is uite a. surd that we should produce as many<br />
models of those things, We are getting no better models but we are<br />
paying twice as much.<br />
Q As you have personally and vigorously participated in<br />
the State election campaign would you see the result as a;<br />
ind; cation of the electoral popularity of your government's policies<br />
in 11d. and also do you think your Federal onionents might use the<br />
electioi result and that of the recent N. T. polls to precipitate<br />
a genelal ," ection next rear.<br />
P. M. I will very naturally comparing +. he percent of<br />
votes cast for the L-hor I'arty, the Liberal iarty an. i the National<br />
Party in Qld on Saturday week wiLh the percentage of votes cast<br />
on May last. Obviously I will be lookin;; g t! t. t t: is i.-<br />
not I eral election it is a state election. at -t does gi<br />
me the oportunity to put rirjht rouga Qld the record strFai. ht.<br />
frankly it ot possible for me to devote my time to vyr<br />
Premier might lil. e out against my Governmorent day and day out.<br />
I mean I have some dea of articulate and coherent the iremier<br />
is, but frankly I haven't got 2 rd of oublic re',.. li<br />
that I assume ts 64yt r know their master's voice and use one of<br />
there biblical things I suppose you can see the hand of Jacob in toe<br />
paw Esau. I mean I am not one of those political lea err who ithoroughly<br />
familiar ;, ith the i6d Testament. I r: member some of it.<br />
If I were to take time to answer every-thing about my Government / 6 </p>
<p>-6-<br />
which is said by all the Prer. iers or just the Old ., utgoing .' eiier<br />
I would have i-o time for any other work. But since I ha-i) een<br />
invited to participate in this campaign on all sides, I thoughtright,<br />
this gives mle the opportunity to put the facts as I have<br />
today and to make the comparisons as I have today And of course<br />
I will be watching very well the percentages that are cast. Now this<br />
is a state election, and I believe that in Percy Tucker there is<br />
a very effective and agressive political leader. I have known him<br />
a long, time and I am satisfied that we will do very well here.<br />
Let me quote what the percentages were the last state elections.<br />
We got six percent more than the other two combined and the Nati: onel<br />
it was called the Country Party then was just over<br />
My Party always gets 30o more votes in this state then the National<br />
Party does. You have also asked what eshwhat the effeci, would be<br />
on the Federal opposition. One of the reasons why the Federal<br />
opposition particularly the Liber-ls every now and then say there<br />
should , e an election, is because a p . son o-f Mr Snedden clearly<br />
believes th: t this a very good insurance to say ' well look ti'ere<br />
may be -: an election in three months you can't drop me now. Now<br />
the Country Party to its credit always wants an election federally,<br />
o cause it realizeA that its only hop of preserving its undue<br />
irilucnce in the Parliament whatever Government is in power, whether<br />
it Liberal iP'i or a Labor P. M. is to preserve an unfair electoral<br />
systern. ; o its of course wanting Lo have an election to make it all<br />
cor fused. And the Liberals or : t least the Snedden Liber<br />
If you win by one vote that'. stili , inning sn' it! T e<br />
constantly saying ' don't rock the t now we naay h vo to lal'nch<br />
li , re may be an election'. The only thing is that lasi. ay the'<br />
nT suggested that if there was an even Senat. th t w-shoul:<br />
tiher down if they won. They never said i. an eon<br />
and we in the House of Io.. resentatives that they I h<br />
another elec n. They never sought they never got<br />
use the Senate to have elections for . he House of . epreseo<br />
alone. They wercthe firsL oi l ito do it. I I ulr' tiby<br />
learnt their lesson and of courst.. of the tri.. u es . h; t<br />
paid to the most magnificent o' the Liberals in this -tate is tl'<br />
fact th . t he opposed it. </p>
