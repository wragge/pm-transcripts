PRIME MINISTER PRESS STATEMENT NO. 94<br />
May 1973<br />
ABORIGINAL EMPLOYMENT<br />
The Australian Government will take steps to recruit<br />
Aborigines into the Australian Public Service.<br />
A team of senior officers from the Public Service Board<br />
and the Department of Aboriginal Affairs will leave on Sunday for<br />
several weeks of field investigations on employment opportunities for<br />
Aboriginals in the Public Service.<br />
The Board has already established an inter-divisional<br />
committee to co-ordinate activities on the recruitment of Aborigines.<br />
It is also holding discussions with the Departments of Labour and<br />
Aboriginal Affairs on details of training and placement of Aborigines<br />
in the Public Service. A recruitment booklet for distribution among<br />
Aborigines has been prepared by the Board and regular surveys of the<br />
numbers of Aboriginals in the Public Service will be carried out.<br />
The two-man team which will leave to study recruitment will<br />
comprise an officer of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and an<br />
officer of the Public Service Board's Organisation Division. It will<br />
conduct joint inspections of jobs performed by Aboriginals on Aboriginal<br />
reserve communities near Alice Springs, Katherine and Darwin to determine<br />
their stability for incorporation into the Public Service.<br />
The inspection will be followed by detailed discussions<br />
with senior officers from Public Service departments located in Darwin.<br />
In their visits to Aboriginal reserve communities near<br />
Katherine and Darwin, the team will be accompanied by another officer<br />
of the Public Service Board who will be consulting with Aboriginal<br />
community spokesmen and departmental officers on difficulties faced<br />
by Aboriginals in seeking Public Service employment.<br />
Consultations will also be held with departmental officers<br />
in Darwin, Brisbane and Sydney, on the placement and training of<br />
Aboriginals and on proposals for regular surveys of the numbers of<br />
Aboriginals employed in the Public Service.<br />
