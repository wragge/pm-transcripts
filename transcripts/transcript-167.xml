SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER THE RT. HON. R. G.<br />
MENZIES IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES ON TIHURSDAY<br />
24th MARCH, 1960<br />
Mr. Speaker, I had the great advantage this afternoon<br />
of listining to the speech of the Attorney-Goneoal ( Sir Garfield<br />
Barwick) in reply to the attack made on the Government in relation<br />
to the subject of wool pies. I am bound to say that his<br />
speech though brief, was so devastating that nothing remains to<br />
be said on that matter. He exposed the Opposition's move as a<br />
piece of arrant political humbug. So, my colleague having<br />
successfully destroyed this attack, there is no reason why I<br />
should trample on the graves of the attackers.<br />
But, Sir, the motion put forward by my friend the<br />
honorable member for Lalor ( Mr. Pollard) -ont beyond wool pies.<br />
It extended into the area of restrictive practices. About that<br />
also my colleague had something to say. Restrictive practices<br />
are, I imagino, attacked in the case of wool because it is said<br />
that they tend to rduce prices. In every other respect that I<br />
can think of, however, they are attacked because it is said that<br />
they increase prices and therefore increase profits, and therefore<br />
produce what the distinguished Loader of the Opposition<br />
( ir. Calwell) was good enough to describe, a few times at<br />
least, as a " profit inflation".<br />
Mr. Calwoll That is right.<br />
MR. iENZIES: That is right! I am very ' lad that ho is here,<br />
because I regard his words with great interest. Several times<br />
he has made it clear that this is a profit inflation. Therefore,<br />
I imagine that my distinguished friend will agree that<br />
this is just one phase of the attack, which the Opposition is<br />
going through the motions of making, on the subject of alleged<br />
excess profits and how to deal with them. Pies, coupled with<br />
the honorable name of General Motors-Holden's Limited, represent<br />
the two ends of the scalu-. Now Sir<br />
Mr. Pollard ihat about Sir WJilliam MacGregor?<br />
MR. MENZIES: I have never heard of Sir ! William MacGrueor.<br />
Mr. Whitlam You have heard of Sir * illiam Angliss, though.<br />
MR. MENZIES Yes, I have, and how green with envy you have been<br />
ever since. I hate to use the word " green" beacuse it may wake<br />
up troubles on the Opposition side and that, if I may so to<br />
tho Deputy Leade of the Opposition ( Mr. Whitlam), is the last<br />
thing I would ~ want to do. Now, Sir, the Attorney-General has<br />
already said something about the difficulties that are involved<br />
in an attack on the problems of improper harmful price agreements.<br />
I do not desire to add anything to what he said on that<br />
matter, but there are those, of course, who after a period of 59<br />
years of this Parliament's existence, profess to find that the<br />
problem is quite simple. No Government from this side of politics<br />
or from the other has ever found it simple; but I am happy<br />
to say that, reinforced as we are in this Government by the<br />
services, as Attorney-General, of the most distinguished constitutional<br />
lawyer at the Australian Bar, we are, in all earnestness,<br />
concentrating our minds on what can be done either in the<br />
general or in the particular.<br />
The general treatment of this matter is not, of course,<br />
very easy because, as everybody knows, and as the Joint Committee<br />
on Constitutional Review recognized, the powers of the Common-<br />
, r~ alth are sketchy; but the powers of the States within their<br />
own domain are clear, and the committee d,;, ioted a good deal of<br />
thought to producing its own solution of this matter. Now, I am<br />
not at all disposed to brush all th-' t to one side, I think that<br />
the report on that matter is of great interest. I have read it<br />
two or three times. It is of great interest, but it does not<br />
solve the problem because, first of all, you have to determine </p>
<p>whether you are going to seek to deal with these matters by<br />
clear Commonwealth law ofcontrol or whether you are going to<br />
seek to deal with them by co-operation between the Common. wealth<br />
acting within its powers the States acting within theirs.<br />
And obviously this is not a matter about which at this stage we<br />
can do very much.<br />
The Opposition professes to say and I understand its<br />
attitude of mind "! ell here is the recommendation. All you<br />
have to do is put it forward. The people will approve of it<br />
and then the . whrole constituional structure will be changed." I<br />
do not want to be unduly melancholy about this matter; but I<br />
should like to remind 11 honorable membe:. s of the House that<br />
for a long time it was thought that the answer to this kind of<br />
problem was to give the Commonwealth Parliament power to legislate<br />
with respect to monopolies a nice, round, mouth-filling<br />
phrase. But that phrase is understood by the Opposition in a<br />
quite different sense from that in ., which we would understand it.<br />
The Opposition is entirely in favour of monopolies so long as<br />
they are government monopolies. We, on the contrary, have always<br />
been disturbed about any monopolistic tendencies in the<br />
ordinary, and what ought to be competitive, business world.<br />
I hope I will not be told that if I only had the right<br />
attitude of mind the Constitution could be altered tomorrow. I<br />
remind the honorable gentlemen opposite as they have reminded<br />
us ond others that the Constitutional Review Committee's report<br />
points out that five times in the history of the Commonwealth<br />
attempts have been made to secure power over monopolies<br />
for the P. rliament of the Commonwealth, and five times the proposals<br />
have been rejected. I quite agree that on the last occasion,<br />
in 1944, the proposal found itself one of fourteen points<br />
which the then Attorney-General was optimistic enough to think<br />
would be adopted in toto and which the people were pessimistic<br />
enough to reject in toto.<br />
But, Sir, the constitutional problem is not a very<br />
easy one, and among the things that we 0ll h. ave to consider is<br />
whether we will travel faster: and fare better by having co-operative<br />
action rith the State gov-rnments and the State parlaiments<br />
than by trusting all to the chances of a constitutional amendment<br />
one of 22 comparatively major constitutional amendments<br />
to which the attention of the Parliament is directed by the<br />
report that has been referred to so frequently in this debate.<br />
There are, ofcourse, some heads of power belonging to<br />
the Commonwealth under which, subject to the wind and weather of<br />
section 92 and those other prohibitive sections of the Constitution,<br />
we :: ight be able to do something. I can assure the House<br />
that we have been concentrating our minds on this very matter.<br />
Jhen it was said in the Governor-General's Speech that we wore<br />
closely investigating these matters, that is exactly what we<br />
meant. Jhat is more, we mean to achieve as much result as we<br />
can within the limits of our poweo in refieonce to this matter at<br />
the earliest possible moment.<br />
The whole House need have no exaggerated fears on<br />
those matters. 3ut, Sir, as I said when I stood up and I notice<br />
that the inexorable hand of the clock goes round and I<br />
have used up half of my time this is one facet of the campaign<br />
which the new Leader of the Opposition ( Mr. Calwell) has<br />
launched w: ith customary spirit and gaiety profitoering<br />
profit inflation. Therefore, I would like to say just a few<br />
words about this alleged case; because there is no better answer<br />
to a rhetorical case than a few simple, well-vouched facts. The<br />
honorable gantleman said in the general, and his colleaguo, the<br />
member for Lalor ( Mr. Pollard), said :-oday in the particular in<br />
another connexion, that all these things are part of a profit<br />
inflation. In other words, these things represent that the<br />
present state of affairs in Austr,. lia, the inflation that is<br />
going on the inflation which they used to describe a few years </p>
<p>ago as a bogy is due to extravagant profit making, whether it<br />
is made by rings or whether it is made in the ordinary course<br />
of business. Therefore, I would like to say, if I can be heard<br />
over the unkindly interruptions of my distinguished and very old<br />
friend, the honorable member for Lalor, that this talk about<br />
profit inflation is the greatest rubbish in the world. And, of<br />
course, if that falls to the ground all this becomes a mere<br />
skirmish directed to the non-wool-growing constituencds of Australia,<br />
which I gathered was the case this afternoon.<br />
Now Sir, a few facts. The last concluddd financial<br />
year is 1958-9, and I hope I will not be contradicted on that.<br />
The national income in 1958-59 was œ 5 000,000,000. It was<br />
œ 5,021,000,000; but call it œ 5,000,060,000. lagos and salaries<br />
in Australia represented, out of that œ 3,046,000,000. In other<br />
words, something well over 60 per cent, of the national income.<br />
Remember that; wages and salaries represented œ 3,046,000,000.<br />
Company income, meaning by that the gross profit before taxation<br />
was œ 630,000,000, and bank profits œ 28,000,000. So that the<br />
total profits ofcompanies of all sorts, public and private and<br />
banks was œ 658,000,000. Out of that income, tax on companies<br />
and the banks amounted to œ 220,000,000, and that left<br />
œ 438,000,000, net dividends and profits sent abroad and I<br />
emphasize that because the greatest friend that they have over<br />
there is General Motors-Holden's Limited, and they generalize<br />
from General Motors-Holden's Limited which, if I remember<br />
correctly, they had the great honour of establishing in this<br />
country -were œ 43,000,000i See how the figures are coming down.<br />
Dividends paid to Australian residents were œ 160,000,000.<br />
So out of that œ 658,000,000, taxation accounted for<br />
œ 220,000,000, and dividends, both sent overseas and left in<br />
Australia, amounted to œ 203,000,000, perceptibly less than the<br />
tax on these companies. Then, as we go down the line, that<br />
leaves us with undistribated profits of œ 235,000,000. Je<br />
started with œ 658,000,000. Those undistributed profits of<br />
œ 235,000,000, going into the reserves of companies have provided<br />
for their devulopment. They have been ploughed back into<br />
the business. And when one of these enterprises, which we can<br />
abuse much too lightly in this country, ploughs back so high a<br />
percentage of its profits into its business, it means a new<br />
factory and extnnsions : nd more employment, more stability of<br />
employment and more security. I wonder how my distinguished<br />
friends opposite would like to go and tell the employees of one<br />
of these companies that they do not believe the company should<br />
have any capacity for financing its future development and future<br />
employment<br />
Mr. Haylon Why don't you go back to your muttons?<br />
MR. MENZIES: If I did go back to my muttons, I would go directly<br />
to the honorable member. Of this remaining total of œ 235,000,00<br />
residents accounted for œ 201,000,000. In other words, residents<br />
had the equity in this undistributed profit to the extent of<br />
œ 201,000,000; and these sinister monsters which are getting<br />
command of Australia had œ 43,000,000 œ 201,000,000 here and<br />
œ 43,000,000 ove: seas.<br />
Now, Sir, I will just put that in summary. Of the<br />
total company profits and this is all behind this motion, the<br />
object of the exercise this is the case that the Australian<br />
Labour Party under new and garnished leadership thinks it has<br />
of the total company profits earned in Australia, ' on-third comes<br />
to the Government as income tax for expenditure on the general<br />
social and other services of the country, 35 per cent. soes back<br />
into enterprises for development, for capital investment, future<br />
employment and for expansion of our industrial capacity, and<br />
near enough to 31 per cent. is paid out in terms of dividends.<br />
Now, Sir, those, I think, are very interesting figures, and I<br />
refer to them because I believe that the Opposition has put this </p>
<p>4.<br />
sorry little motion for'/ ard today as part and parcel of its<br />
general campaign on profits.<br />
The only other thing I iant to say is this and I<br />
have three minutes in which to say it: Je have occasionally been<br />
told from the other side of the House tihat if we did our duty<br />
we w ould impose an excess profits tax. And even the honorable<br />
member for East Sydney ( Mr. ia-rd), who dies hard, as we all know<br />
in the last fortnight, keeps referring to this. May I remind<br />
him and may I remind the House that there have been quite a few<br />
attempts made to devise an equitable and just system of excess<br />
profits tax on companies wrhich rould not grievously handicap<br />
the new company established by some enterprising Australian<br />
starting from scratch. The late John Curtin had to abandon it.<br />
The late Mr. Chifloy had to abandon it and, indeed, he was very<br />
frank about the matter because in 1947, in this voey place, he<br />
said In ordinary peace-time circumstances this tax operates<br />
inequitably.<br />
This is the excess profits tax<br />
It penalizes new industries by preventing the building up<br />
of reserves -nd consequently favours old established industries<br />
which have had the opportunity of building resorves<br />
in the past.<br />
* Sir, I quote that, and I would like to have said more<br />
about it; but I quote it for the purpose of showing that if the<br />
Labour Party in this place wants to put itself forward as the<br />
party ihich will protect the old established business and as the<br />
enemy of new enterprises, which must attract a lot of profit in<br />
order to develop a now industry, it ought to say so.<br />
Mr. Pollard It is not a matter of profit inflation but of<br />
price manipulation.<br />
MR. MENZIES I do not need to tell the honorable member any-<br />
Sthing about rool pies. The Attorney-General left him, this<br />
afternoon, without even the crust of a pie to bite on. </p>
