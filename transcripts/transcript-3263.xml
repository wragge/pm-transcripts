CVA STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
CA CHELSEA MEETING, MELBOURNE, 14 MAY 1974<br />
The Opposition have made it brutally clear that they<br />
would do nothing of value for the care and education of young<br />
children. C-hild care, would suffer under a Country Party-Liberal<br />
Government fo-r thKe-same reason that education would suffer.<br />
Mr Snedden would prefer to spend the money on wealthy sectional<br />
interests. The Liberal record on child care demonstrates their<br />
neglect and indifference. In their last three years in office<br />
they spent $ 5 million a year on pre-school education and child<br />
care. They promised to spend an additional $ 5 million in 1972<br />
but did not do so. ~ w.~=~ tsixmonths teWhit lam Governi..::<br />
ment has spent $ 18 million. It has done this -and much more<br />
by cutting back $ 480 million in unnecessary spending on tax<br />
lurks, concessions and subsidies for wealthy mining corporations,<br />
business interests, Collins Street farmers and category-A<br />
schools. Mr Snedden, under Country Party pressure, would restore<br />
these payments. That is why he has no real interest in child<br />
care. That is why his proposals are hollow and irrelevant.<br />
Australians all Australian governments currently<br />
spend $ 2,000 million a year in educating, sheltering and caring<br />
for children under 12. In this context, the Snedden offer of<br />
million for children under six looks pretty shabby.<br />
That is the reality behind the official Liberal<br />
policy statement that there would be " no new expenditure until<br />
economic circumstances permit", that " current pre-school programs"<br />
would continue. They promise merely to continue something that<br />
everyone regards as inadequate.<br />
There can be no argument about the size and reality<br />
of the challenge. The best official estimates at the government's<br />
disposal indicate a program costing $ 130 million in a full year.<br />
We are committed to such a program. </p>
