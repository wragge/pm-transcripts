SPEECH BY THE DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER,. MR L. H. BARNARD<br />
AT THE OPENING OF THE TASMNA DIVISION O<br />
THE MUNICIPAL ASCAO'S CONFERENCE IN<br />
LAUNCESTON -5 NOVEMBERJ 1973<br />
Today I am talking to you about our new deal<br />
for Local Government in Australia.<br />
We are not seeking changes for changes sake<br />
nor, as some would say, to centralise power in Canberra.<br />
What we are really dging is to give a new and realistic<br />
meaning to Federalism, real local participation in public<br />
affairs and in effect, real decentralisation of Government.<br />
The Australian Government is moving quickly to<br />
develop its policies for Local Government and the cities.<br />
Our commitment to Local Government is an important part of<br />
our overall commitment to urban and regional development.<br />
I think most of you here today know about the three<br />
specific promises which the Labor Party made to Local Government<br />
while in Opposition.<br />
Firstly, we promised direct Local Government<br />
representation at the 1973 Constitutional Convention. You<br />
will all be aware that on the Steering Committee of that<br />
Convention there was some division over this question.<br />
we remained firm to our commitment and I am pleased<br />
that the outcome was successful and that Local Government was<br />
represented at the convention.<br />
Secondly&gt; we promised to change the Loan Council so<br />
that Local Government representatives from all States could<br />
have a voice and a vote on that Council.<br />
On the 11th of last month the Prime Minister met<br />
the State Premiers to resolve this question. Unfortunately,<br />
some of the Premiers ( not including Tasmania) would not<br />
accept our proposal. But we are not going to let the matter<br />
rest there. We now propose to ' hold a referendum on the matter<br />
early next year. I<br />
Thirdly, we promised to amend the Grants Commission<br />
Act to authorise the Commission to enquire into and make<br />
recommendations on grants to regional groups of Local<br />
Government. In May, we changed the Grants Commission Act<br />
which will give some relief for Local Government areas. You<br />
will remember that Mr Whitlam has been speaking for years<br />
about the Grants Commission doing a similar exercise for<br />
regions in need within the States as it now does between the<br />
States. No one doubts the strength of Local Government'. s<br />
case for more financial assistance.<br />
Under the new Grants Commission Act some relief is<br />
in sight for Local Government areas. Let me turn now to some<br />
aspects of the Grants Commission operation. </p>
<p>We should be quite clear that the responsible<br />
Minister under this legislation is the Special Minister<br />
of State, Senator Ddn Willesee.<br />
I know that people in Local Government would'<br />
like the grants from the Commission to flow through as quickly<br />
as possible. But we must all realise the difficulties. The<br />
Grants Commission now has to adapt to its new role, recruit<br />
extra staff and work out how it is going to deal with<br />
applications from Local Government.<br />
When the Commission is ready to begin considering<br />
applications an announcement will be made.,<br />
On present indications this might not be before<br />
January next year. In the meantime a handbook is being<br />
prepared to assist regional organisations in drawing up<br />
their submissions. Another colleague of mine, Mr Tom Uren, the Minister<br />
for Urban and Regional Development, has two important<br />
responsibilities in this area.. Firstly, he is responsible<br />
for approving regional groupings of local councils through<br />
which submissions to the Grants Commission must be made.<br />
Secondly, he can comment to the Commission on the<br />
submissions from regional groups. In this way, Mr Uren can<br />
inform the Commission on how the applications may be assessed<br />
in the light of the Australian Government's overall regional<br />
planning and development objectives.<br />
What we are trying to do is to encourage councils<br />
to think big. Certainly far bigger than they have in the<br />
past. We hope that this new move of ours will provide an<br />
effective and useful fillip to bigger regional planning.<br />
As you know, the Department of Urban and Regional<br />
Development has already made some tentative grouping of<br />
regions. We expect that Local Government will want to make<br />
some comments to the Department through the appropriate<br />
Minister in each. State. The appropriate Minister in Tasmania<br />
is, of course, Mr Michael Barnard. I would like to emphasise<br />
that at this stage the suggested regions are tentative. This<br />
is because we can in time carry out longer investigations.<br />
Also we expect to gain a lot of experience in the first couple<br />
of years in the working of the Act.<br />
In its investigations the Department has found that<br />
regions already adopted by the various State Governments for<br />
the rural sectors in each State will probably be suitable for<br />
purposes of the Grants Commission Act.<br />
As a general rule the State's regions have been taken<br />
as the main basis for approved regional organisations in nonmetropolitan<br />
areas.<br />
I would like to stress again that the report being<br />
sent out to all Councils is designed to encourage comment<br />
through the appropriate State Minister on the suggested<br />
regions. We will also have the benefit of experience<br />
before we decide on the final regions after a couple of years. ./ 3 </p>
<p>These are still very early days in our new approach<br />
to urban and regional development generally and Local<br />
Government in particular.<br />
We must make sure that we act quickly because the<br />
needs are both great and urgent. But, on the other hand,<br />
we must also make sure that we take notice of the views of<br />
Local Government representatives. All of us must try to<br />
make sure that we take notice of the views of the citizens<br />
we all represent. I have already mentioned the role played by the<br />
Grants Commission and the requirements for regional groupings.<br />
But these are small elements of the Australian Government's<br />
plan for a new federalism.<br />
The Department of Urban and Regional Development is<br />
charged with the responsibility for the development and<br />
implementation of national and regional development strategy.<br />
It is also charged with the development and monitoring<br />
of an urban and regional budget programme to co-ordinate<br />
resources allocated for investment in urban and regional<br />
services by federal departments, state and local governing<br />
bodies. The Department of Urban and Regional Development<br />
has a role in the administration in the Grants Commission Act.<br />
But it will be guided by a wider concern to promote effective<br />
regional development and to improve generally the resources<br />
of Local Government so that it can operate efficiently.<br />
Unfortunately we are being thwarted in our attempts to advance<br />
the role of Local Government by the attitudes of some State<br />
Premiers. on this issue it is not the Federal Government<br />
which is adopting a centra ' list stance but some of the States.<br />
We want to give an effective say to local populations on local<br />
matters. We want to give, local populations an effective say<br />
about the things that immediately concern them. We are not<br />
being allowed to and that is why we are being forced to go to<br />
a referendum so that Local Government has direct access to the<br />
Loan Council. These are just a few thoughts on what we are doing<br />
in this important area. They have been Labor Party policy<br />
for some time. We are fulfilling the-promises made many years<br />
ago. I think we are on the verge of an exciting new era for<br />
our third tier of Government in this country. Whatever way<br />
you may look at it, it is certainly the best deal that Local<br />
Government has ever had in our living memory.<br />
Thank you for having me. It has been a pleasure to<br />
be here today to give you a progress account of what's<br />
happening in this field. By the time you meet again no<br />
doubt a lot of the administrative problems will have been<br />
sorted out but most importantly I hope that the Australian<br />
people will have decided to support your cause and give you<br />
direct access to the Loan Council and therefore the means<br />
to put into practice imaginative plans. </p>
