PRIME MINISTER<br />
CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EAREDUNTIL DELITVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
LAUNCH OF THE GARNAUT REPORT<br />
" AUSTRALIA AND THE NORTHEAST ASIAN ASCENDANCY"<br />
SYDNEY 22 NOVEMBER 1989<br />
When I commissioned Ross Garnaut last year to write a report<br />
for the Government on Australia and Northeast Asia, I did so<br />
with two thoughts in mind.<br />
First, I knew that Ross, with the depth of his experience in<br />
academia, government, diplomacy and commerce, was<br />
extraordinarily well placed to recognise and analyse the<br />
fundamental changes taking place in Australia and Asia.<br />
Second, I wanted him to write a report that would, wherever<br />
he saw necessary, provoke further debate in the Australian<br />
community and suggest further policy initiatives for the<br />
Australian Government.<br />
I wanted an expert report and a stimulating report. I got<br />
both. This report is a landmark that can and should profoundly<br />
influence the way Australians think about our country and<br />
its place in the region.<br />
It is a report for all Australians. Its analysis and<br />
recommendations are not directed solely at the Commonwealth,<br />
or to Commonwealth and State Governments alone. Rather it<br />
is a report designed to encourage community discussion and<br />
debate including by governments on Australia's place in<br />
the region and how we might best go about adapting our<br />
country to realise more fully its almost unbounded economic<br />
potential. It is a report whose impact reaches into virtually every<br />
aspect of Australian society just as the process of<br />
economic internationalisation it describes and advocates has<br />
triggered far reaching change in attitudes and practices<br />
throughout the Australian community.<br />
And that is why some of the key recommendations of the<br />
report relate to our education system, to our industries, to<br />
our infrastructure, and to the capacities of the bureaucracy<br />
to analyse and advise on change in Northeast Asia.<br />
5T31 </p>
<p>The report is a product of, and a further spur to, the<br />
process of economic reconstruction and enmneshment with the<br />
dynamic Asia Pacific region that has been a principal focus<br />
of my Government's activities since we came to office in<br />
1983. Ross Garnaut's vision is of an Australia that grasps, in his<br />
words, " the prosperity, self-confidence and independence in<br />
an interdependent world that earlier Australians in<br />
expansive times had hoped for their country". In this, he<br />
is articulating a goal that I wholeheartedly embrace.<br />
Much that he recommends has already been done indeed, such<br />
is the pace of reform in Australia at present that, as Ross<br />
himself acknowledges in several important areas,<br />
recommendations have been overtaken by policies.<br />
Yet there is of course much in this report that is new,<br />
forward looking, stimulating and refreshing.<br />
The key elements of this report, and certainly its<br />
underlying philosophy, must form part of any forward agenda<br />
for an Australian Government looking into the 1990s and<br />
towards the next century.<br />
So I say at the outset that I welcome this report and,<br />
although I am not of course in a position today to give a<br />
comprehensive response to its the recommendations, I can<br />
assure you that they will receive close and very sympathetic<br />
consideration by me and my Cabinet colleagues.<br />
I want to describe in a moment the specific measures I<br />
propose to set in train in response to the report.<br />
But first I want to comment on the way in which the debate<br />
in Australia about economic policy-making has changed since<br />
1983.<br />
When we came to office we were confronted by a situation<br />
Ross Garnaut describes in the following terms:<br />
" For the first seven decades of the Federation a<br />
fearful, defensive Australia built walls to protect<br />
itself against the challenge of the outside world, and<br />
found that.-it had protected itself against the<br />
recognition and utilisation of opportunity".<br />
In other words, we had walked down the gentle path to<br />
economic mediocrity.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen 3 151 31 </p>
<p>Let me make this brutally stark and unarguable point. When<br />
we came to office in 1983, for 30 of the 33 previous years<br />
the conservative parties had governed this country. The<br />
institutions, the attitudes, the assumptions, the practices<br />
of the Australia we were elected to govern were those that<br />
had emerged from, and that we inherited from, that<br />
governance of timid and unimaginative mediocrity.<br />
For three virtually uninterrupted decades there had been a<br />
haphazard and short-term response by conservative<br />
Governments for which surrender to sectional interest groups<br />
had become the operating principle.<br />
That was the dimension of our challenge our challenge<br />
together as a Government and a community.<br />
No one can realistically suggest that it would have been<br />
possible to change the effects of that legacy overnight, or<br />
indeed in one or two years.<br />
But I do say to you that, together, we have changed the<br />
perceptions, the horizons, the sense of direction. Today,<br />
the long-term direction in which we have to travel is clear<br />
to all: we have to internationalise.<br />
The only rpai debate is about how we go about the process of<br />
reform and how fast we do it.<br />
Putting accuracy before modesty, let me say my Government<br />
can take much of the credit for the fact that Australians<br />
are far more outward looking, more comfortable with, and<br />
more effective in, the region than they were just seven<br />
years ago.<br />
In 1983 who would have thought that by 1989 we would have a<br />
floating dollar, a deregulated financial sector, a program<br />
that by 1992 will see most tariffs at either 10 or 15 per<br />
cent, an end to the two airline agreement, dividend<br />
imputation and a 39 per cent company tax rate, new<br />
competition in areas of telecommunications, deregulation of<br />
oil marketing, the removal of most foreign investment<br />
regulation, the deregulation of air charter policy, moves to<br />
enterprise employment on the waterfront and a clear program<br />
of manning redqctions on coastal shipping to OECD levels?<br />
And that is by no means a complete list of our microeconomic<br />
reforms. But it is a list which establishes another<br />
irrefutable fact no other period of Australian peace-time<br />
history has come within cooee of that range of microeconomic<br />
reforms.<br />
In 1983 who would have foreshadowed Australia heading a<br />
Cairns Group of fair traders that has taken a leading role<br />
in the current round of multilateral trade negotiations; and<br />
who would have-foreshadowed Australia hosting the Inaugural<br />
Meeting of Ministers from 12 Asia Pacific countries aimed at<br />
closer economic co-operation in the region?<br />
32 </p>
<p>Our domestic and foreign policy, the political and economic<br />
components of foreign policy, and our bilateral and<br />
multilateral approaches in seeking to implement those<br />
policies, have been and must continue to be<br />
complementary, consistent: as Ross has put it to me a<br />
seamless web.<br />
To illustrate, we have given credibility to our<br />
international campaign for trade liberalisation by<br />
implementing substantial cuts in domestic protection and,<br />
to take the other side of the coin, our domestic campaign to<br />
open the economy has been strengthened by our success abroad<br />
in securing market access for efficient Australian<br />
producers. It would have been inconceivable for Australia to have<br />
hosted the APEC Meeting had we still been operating under<br />
the regime of-protection and introspection we inherited.<br />
-Nobody would have turned up.<br />
There is no simple division between bilateral, regional and<br />
multilateral spheres of diplomacy. Lack of co-ordination<br />
between any of those, or between them and domestic policy,<br />
is a deficiency that could only reduce the effectiveness of<br />
all policy.<br />
Let me also make it clear that in commissioning this report<br />
I did not have in mind that Australia's future lies<br />
exclusively in its relations with the countries of Northeast<br />
Asia. But the historically unprecedented growth that has<br />
occurred in Northeast Asia over the past four decades has<br />
spurred growth in Southeast Asia and the rest of the world.<br />
The impact on Australia of growth in Northeast Asia has<br />
been, and will continue to be, profound.<br />
Throughout that growth process there has been a remarkably<br />
close complementarity between Australia and Northeast Asia.<br />
The early stages of Northeast Asian growth required natural<br />
fibres for textile industries, and we benefited from this;<br />
mineral raw materials were necessary for later heavy<br />
industrialisation, again bringing benefits for us; then more<br />
processed raw materials were needed of us; and today tourism<br />
and other high quality services, that Australia is well<br />
placed to provide, figure prominently in the consumption of<br />
a prospering Northeast Asia.<br />
As we enter the 1990s, Australia's need for highly skilled<br />
migrants and foreign capital will further reinforce that<br />
complementarity. In his letter submitting his report to me and to<br />
Gareth Evans, Ross takes all this together to conclude:<br />
" Development in Northeast Asia, together with the<br />
progress that has been made in recent years on the<br />
internationalisation of the Australian economy, make<br />
the next few years a time of great opportunity". ' 533 </p>
<p>Ross Garnaut has actually endeavoured to quantify that<br />
opportunity, and arrives at a figure of around $ 20 billion<br />
in export earnings that could become available to Australia<br />
largely through the sale to Northeast Asia of processed raw<br />
materials and of services, particularly tourism and<br />
education. Australians have heard many a false promise of economic<br />
expansion and imminent resources booms. But Dr Garnaut<br />
paints a very different outlook for Australia today:<br />
" Australia's advantages this time are a wider community<br />
perception of the magnitude and complexity of the task,<br />
and a recent record of solid achievement on policy<br />
change in the directions that are necessary for longterm<br />
success. A start has been made on reform in most<br />
of the areas where change is necessary."<br />
The investment boom we are currently experiencing with<br />
business investment at its highest levels in 40 years and<br />
the new investment in the pipeline or under consideration<br />
all indicate that the process is well underway.<br />
Access Economics recently surveyed large investment projects<br />
with the potential to earn foreign exchange. It found<br />
projects worth $ 49 billion that are under construction or<br />
committed, and other projects worth an additional $ 41<br />
billion in an advanced stage of planning.<br />
The survey identifies six major committed investment<br />
projects which in a few years are expected to generate close<br />
to $ 5 billion a year in exports.<br />
This is equivalent to about 30 per cent of our current<br />
account deficit.<br />
Australia needs this investment if it is to re-tool; if it<br />
is to have new factories producing new goods; if it is to<br />
have new hotels, new planes, new tourist resorts; new ships<br />
carrying Australian natural gas; if it is to take full<br />
advantage of the enormous growth opportunities available in<br />
the region and beyond.<br />
But the investment must be financed. That this investment<br />
financing has contributed very greatly to the growth in<br />
Australia's external debt is reflected in the composition of<br />
our net debt: 63 per cent private, the remainder being owed<br />
by statutory authorities and State Governments. The<br />
Commonwealth, through the series of Budget surpluses we have<br />
run up, is a net nrsditny abroad.<br />
3, 53 </p>
<p>Reinforcing the internationalisation of the Australian<br />
economy is the upsurge in equity investment by Australians<br />
in overseas companies. The outstanding value of this<br />
Australian investment abroad has jumped from less than<br />
$ 7 billion in June 1983 to $ 49 billion in June 1989. If my<br />
Government had not freed up opportunities for this<br />
Australian investment abroad, Australia's net foreign debt<br />
could be up to $ 42 billion, or nearly 40 per cent, lower<br />
than it is now.<br />
But this investment will yield rfuture income for Australia:<br />
already the country is receiving $ 3 billion a year in income<br />
from Australian investments abroad, more thanr double the<br />
inflow of only three years ago.<br />
And our investment abroad is playing a critical role in more<br />
fully integrating Australia into the world economy<br />
generating markets, technology, ideas.<br />
This is not to say we should be complacent about Australia's<br />
indebtedness, but neither should we be unduly pessimistic.<br />
We could not reconstruct the Australian economy without it.<br />
As the Garnaut Report demonstrates, the countries of<br />
Northeast Asia ran large current account deficits when<br />
reconstructing their economies.<br />
Australia's indebtedness is financing arguably the most<br />
dramatic reconstruction of the Australian industrial base in<br />
the nation's history. It would be better if we could do it<br />
all on domestic savings but we haven't before and we can't<br />
now. So let's get the debt in perspective: it's by no<br />
means all bad news as the jeremiahs suggest.<br />
Certainly if Australia is to chase the $ 20 billion extra<br />
exports that Dr Garnaut identifies, additional investment<br />
will be required.<br />
So too will further policy changes.<br />
We have never pretended economic restructuring is a simple<br />
or rapid process and the Garnaut Report has given valuable<br />
advice on how to proceed.<br />
The Structural Adjustment Comittee of Cabinet the engine<br />
room of economic reconstruction in my Government will have<br />
the task of deliberating on all aspects of the report.<br />
It will, very significantly, consider carefully and in<br />
detail the step that Dr Garnaut describes as " the most<br />
important single step" the abolition of all Australian<br />
protection by the beginning of next century.<br />
I can say at the outset that this recommendation is one with<br />
which I have considerable sympathy. 8535 </p>
<p>Our industries can only be internationally competitive<br />
exporters if their cost structures are not inflated by<br />
domestic protection, and if they operate domestically at<br />
world prices.<br />
As we continue to liberalise the product market, so too will<br />
we encourage and implement further labour market reforms.<br />
The current process of award restructuring is a unique means<br />
of tackling some of the barriers to improved industry<br />
efficiency and productivity.<br />
It provides both the opportunities, and the necessary<br />
safeguards, on overall wage outcomes.<br />
It will cater for a more concerted move away from interindustry<br />
or occupational awards and fragmented, craft based<br />
unions to arrangements that better reflect the needs of<br />
individual industries and enterprises.,<br />
Ross Garnaut says his second most important set of<br />
recommendations after further trade liberalisation are<br />
those concerning education.<br />
His report calls for a much greater commitment at both<br />
secondary and tertiary levels to the study of Asian<br />
languages, history, culture, economics and politics. It<br />
recommends filling important gaps in lin~ s with the Republic<br />
of Korea and Taiwan.<br />
The aim essentially is to educate the community about<br />
Northeast Asia.<br />
My Government takes pride in the fact that our policies and<br />
programs in education are the first of any Australian<br />
Federal Government to recognise the importance of Asia.<br />
we will use the impetus of this Report to do much more.<br />
The Asian Studies Council, established in 1986, and the<br />
Languages Ins titute of Australia, established only this<br />
year, will contribute significantly to the study of Asian<br />
languages. Funding for growth in student places, research funding from<br />
the Australian Research Council and scholarships worth $ 1.25,<br />
million this year will also support the spread of knowledge<br />
in Australia of Asian cultures.<br />
A working group will report to SAC after examining the<br />
Garnaut education recommendations in detail. But some<br />
initiatives can be implemented immediately.<br />
We will immediately invite submissions for the establishment<br />
of a Korean Studies Centre and provide core funding of<br />
$ 300,000 in 1990 and $ 200,000 for three years thereafter. </p>
<p>We will immediately fund twelve scholarships for high<br />
quality postgraduate research students from Korea and<br />
Taiwan. We will also fund teacher development and exchange programs<br />
to upgrade the skills of Australians through foreign country<br />
exposure, to upgrade the skills of qualified native speakers<br />
of Asian languages, and to fund teacher and research<br />
exchanges. Ross Garnaut's third set of recommendations is on<br />
infrastructure policy particularly focussing on the<br />
waterfront, coastal shipping, civil aviation and electricity<br />
generation. He recommends opportunities for private investmen t in ports<br />
to increase competition in the provision of these services.<br />
My Government-would welcome such investment. Indeed, our<br />
-historic moves to enterprise employment will facilitate<br />
removal of a hitherto significant practical impediment.<br />
The productivity, reliability, efficiency and price of<br />
operations on the Australian waterfront will be monitored,<br />
as Garnaut recommends, . to ensure substantial progress<br />
towards international levels over the next three years.<br />
We have already established the Waterfront Industry Reform<br />
Authority for this purpose and appropriate measurement<br />
indicators are being developed.<br />
We will ensure continued progress is made and that the<br />
public is kept informed.<br />
Ross Garnaut recommends that producers should be given<br />
access to bulk carriers of raw materials on the Australian<br />
coast at international costs.<br />
Through consensus we have already achieved:<br />
a decline in average crew levels from 33 in 1983 to 21<br />
by 1992 as I remind you again, down to the average<br />
OECD level;<br />
investment in new more efficient ships; and<br />
the acceptance in specific circumstances of foreign<br />
ships carrying goods along the coast.<br />
These are important changes. With assistance from these<br />
moves we will, in responding to the Garnaut Report, address<br />
particularly the needs of new raw material projects that<br />
will be reliant on coastal shipping.<br />
The report identifies " the systemic and physical<br />
infrastructure of Australian civil aviation" as the greatest<br />
single barrier to expansion in international tourism. 3 5-37 </p>
<p>It proposes the introduction of differentiated and flexible<br />
pricing of landing slots, private investment in the<br />
establishment of new airport facilities, acceptance of<br />
higher levels of foreign investment in civil aviation,<br />
acceptance of mergers to facilitate improvement in domestic<br />
and international links and more flexible allocation of<br />
landing rights, including designation of additional<br />
Australian carriers.<br />
Clearly we have very substantially liberalised this industry<br />
with the ending, next October, of the two airline agreement<br />
and the deregulation of air charter policy. These changes<br />
will provide a further boost to tourism.<br />
The SAC will shortly consider the traffic management regime<br />
at Kingsford Smith Airport, and will examine the<br />
appropriateness of flexible pricing of landing slots at<br />
other airports.<br />
My colleague Ralph Willis, the Ministeis for Transport and<br />
Communications, this year announced a considerably more<br />
liberal approach to the negotiation of international<br />
aviation rights.<br />
But more can be done. Private capital can play a greater<br />
role in providing additional airport facilities. And we do<br />
need to ensure that international aviation competition and<br />
domestic linkages fully serve the interests of tourism and<br />
related industries.<br />
A SAC working group will consider all these issues, looking<br />
initially at flexible pricing of landing slots and the scope<br />
for additional private investment, before moving to the<br />
other, more complex issues.<br />
On electricity generation, Garnaut recommends further<br />
improvements following receipt of the Industry Commission's<br />
report. He suggests State Governments accept private power<br />
generation and transmission through the public grid to<br />
large-scale users.<br />
My Government-would welcome this, and will pursue the idea<br />
with State Governments now and, if more still needs to be<br />
done, after we receive the Industry Commission's Report.<br />
The Industry Commission's reports on both electricity and<br />
rail are seen as vital by my Government. We will ensure<br />
action follows.<br />
And let me add this: I do not necessarily regard our recent<br />
over-riding of existing differing States' legislation on the<br />
handling and transport of grain as a precedent for all<br />
occasions: but there should be no doubt that we will act as<br />
required to ensure that recommendations vital to this<br />
nation's future are implemented.<br />
A fourth set of recommendations concerns foreign investment.<br />
3538 </p>
<p>The general thrust of the report supports my Government's<br />
liberalisation of, and our commitment to a<br />
non-discriminatory policy in, foreign investment.<br />
Australia now has one of the most liberal foreign investment<br />
systems in the world.<br />
Ross Garnaut points to a degree of fear, apprehension and<br />
prejudice about foreign investment from Northern Asia.<br />
Better and more widely disseminated data on foreign<br />
investment are needed to allay what I believe are<br />
unjustified fears.<br />
I have therefore asked my colleague, Treasurer Paul Keating,<br />
to report to SAC on how best to achieve this u~ ing, for<br />
example, the resources of the Australian Bureau of<br />
Statistics. Fifth, the report recommends that environmental standards to<br />
be met by new processing projects be established well in<br />
advance. It has also pointed to the desirability of<br />
agreement between the Commonwealth and the States on the<br />
standards to apply and the importance of consulting<br />
conservation and other interest groups in the process. I<br />
strongly endorse these recommendations.<br />
I have already announced in my Statement on the Environment<br />
that the Commonwealth will be examining approval processes<br />
with a view to improving both definition and timeliness. In<br />
one particularly contentious area, pulp mills, we are moving<br />
to draw up guidelines which should be announced in the next<br />
few months after close consultation with State Governments,<br />
industry and conservation groups.<br />
When they are in place, proponents of new mills will know<br />
from the start what is expected of them.<br />
Within a year or so I ' hope we can have guidelines in place<br />
in all major industries.<br />
There is no desire on the part of this Government to<br />
frustrate development, and once guidelines reflect community<br />
views, uncertainty and conflict will subside. We will<br />
certainly be devoting our considerable energies to this<br />
effort. And let me make this point. My Government does not accept<br />
the simplistic dichotomy development or the protection of<br />
the environment. We must have both. And our record shows<br />
that we can have both. Under my Government:<br />
the rate of economic growth has been above the OECD<br />
average, and twice the rate of that under our<br />
conservative predecessors; 385 3 ' It </p>
<p>employment growth has been twice the OECD average and<br />
five times faster than our predecessors; and, at the<br />
same time<br />
the World Heritage Bureau has said that no country has<br />
done more to advance world heritage values than<br />
Australia.<br />
Finally, the report claims there is a weakness in Canberra's<br />
analytic capacity in the management of our bilateral<br />
relations with the countries of Northeast Asia. It calls<br />
for the provision of additional resources both in Canberra<br />
and in some overseas posts. We accejpt this recommendation<br />
in principle and will move quickly to address it.<br />
Presently, a Standing Committee of Deputy Secretaries is<br />
responsible for overseeing Australia's bilateral economic<br />
relationship with China.<br />
This Committee is now to be extended In membership to<br />
include my own Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, and<br />
Treasury, and its focus is to be enlarged to include all of<br />
Northeast Asia.<br />
The Committee will be asked to examine and report to SAC on<br />
the best means of implementing the recommendations on<br />
improved analytic capacity, and on international policy<br />
matters. Of course the Tiananmen events reversed in the most brutal<br />
way the developments of the previous decade, which had made<br />
China a more open and indeed more prosperous society, and a<br />
country with which Australia had very close relations.<br />
China remains unquestionably one of the key countries in the<br />
Asia-Pacific and it is in all our interests that the decade<br />
of openness and reform is not lost irretrievably to the<br />
Chinese people or to the region.<br />
As you know, the Government took certain actions in relation<br />
to China following the massacre and will be reviewing the<br />
relationship-' again in the near future.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen<br />
It has to be understood that for all the progress we have<br />
made for all the opportunities that await us in Northeast<br />
Asia if we get our policy responses right we could still<br />
see it all unravel.<br />
The achievement of creating an open, international economy<br />
is not happening by accident.<br />
Success is not inevitable. The opportunities offered by<br />
Asia-Pacific economic dynamism will not just fall into our<br />
laps. The Australian community will not automatically<br />
accept change of the magnitude required.<br />
3540 </p>
<p>It all needs deliberate policy design; careful negotiation<br />
of consensus; leadership; vision and guts.<br />
And it needs constant and tireless communiity education of<br />
which this Report is a striking example.<br />
Without these factors our progress can disappear just as<br />
fast as it has been made with traumatic and devastating<br />
results. I am not going to engage in overly partisan analysis in this<br />
forum. But it is essential to say clearly, so that everyone<br />
understands the issue at stake no political party deserves<br />
the trust of the Australian people unless it can demonstrate<br />
it has been able to commence, can continue, andt will<br />
complete this vital process.<br />
The implication of this assertion speaks for itself: only<br />
Labor has the past record, present policies and the future<br />
strategy and commitment to reverse the accumulation of<br />
neglect from previous conservative Governments, and to avoid<br />
the threatened chaos of the current conservative Opposition.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen<br />
The Garnaut Report paints a picture of opportunity in the<br />
1990s5 that Australia must and, if we are careful, will<br />
realise. I was impressed by a comment published recently to the<br />
effect that the Garnaut Report's message that we should<br />
enmesh ourselves in Northeast Asia would, if implemented,<br />
represent the most substantial reorientation of Australian<br />
attitudes since Curtin turned to the United States in 1941.<br />
I don't disagree. But I make this important point.<br />
In 1941, Australia's new relationship with the US did not<br />
mean the end of our traditional British links expressed in<br />
our demography, political traditions and practices and<br />
culture. Si milarly, enmneshment with Northeast Asia will not take<br />
place at-the expense of our existing and valued economic,<br />
political, and cultural ties with Europe, North America or<br />
other parts of the Asia-Pacific region.<br />
Indeed one very important element of Garnaut's analysis is<br />
that we carry into our relations with Northeast Asia many<br />
positive and influential assets.<br />
These include I name only a few of the most important<br />
our proud, vigorous and deeply entrenched democratic<br />
traditions, our standards of human rights, our multicultural<br />
tolerance, our principles of free trade unionism. 3541 </p>
<p>Such assets will, in Garnaut's words, provide opportunities<br />
to influence the shape of our relations in ways that are<br />
favourable to our own interests.<br />
Far from being in some way at risk in our relationship with<br />
Northeast Asia, such assets will provide the basis for a<br />
richer and broader relationship, not restricted to dollar<br />
values, not caught up solely in balance sheets, not reduced<br />
purely to traded goods but capable of enhancing the<br />
intangible, yet supremely important, concepts of quality of<br />
life and cultural understanding.<br />
And let me say this in conclusion. I have long regarded Ross<br />
Garnaut as a great Australian. With this report you have, I<br />
believe Ross, placed all Australians considerably in your<br />
debt.<br />
