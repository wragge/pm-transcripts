    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>P. M. No. 114/1966 </strong></p>
<p>Â Mr. McEwen rang me yesterday morning to give me his congratulations on the election result. I then suggested to him that we meet at my home in the late afternoon.</p>
<p>We had a long talk in which we reviewed the outcome of the election and we discussed arrangements which we could recommend to our respective parties for continuance of the Coalition Government.</p>
<p>We had each made it clear to our Cabinet colleagues that it was intended that the coalition would continue in the event of the Government being returned.</p>
<p>The first formal business will be for each to meet his party as soon as the result in all electorates is sufficiently clear to ensure a full attendance of members.</p>
<p>The Chief Electoral Officer, Mr. Ley, has advised that final results in all House of Representative seats are unlikely to be known until towards the end of next week.</p>
<p>The party meeting will be held in Canberra as soon as practicable.</p>
<p>CANBERRA,<br />29th November, 1966</p>
