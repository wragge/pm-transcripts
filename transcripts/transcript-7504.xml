TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH MIKE SWINSON, BRUCE MONTGOMERY<br />
AND ANDREW FISHER, 7.30 REPORT, HOBART, 23 FEBRUARY 1989<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Can we deal firstly with that issue of child<br />
poverty and I ask you how can you deliver on your very<br />
public commitment made in 1987 when you said that no<br />
Australian child will live in poverty by 1990, given the<br />
results of the Burdekin inquiry?<br />
PM: Well as I made it clear at the time and I made clear<br />
subsequently, what was obviously being conveyed by me then<br />
was the point that as a result of the financial and very<br />
considerable financial incentives and outlays that we would<br />
make there would be no financial need. I never contemplated<br />
that by government fiat you could intervene in the<br />
interactions of families which will mean there are decisions<br />
by children to leave, decisions by parents to throw kids<br />
out. The statement was quite clear and the action which<br />
followed it has been munificent.<br />
JOURNALIST: But that action has been, has it not, directed<br />
towards families that are together rather than kids who are<br />
out on the street?<br />
PM: But let me make it clear that no action by government<br />
as such is going to stop the cases of kids being away from<br />
their families, either by the decision of the parents or the<br />
decision of the kids. Now what we've done I mean you link<br />
0 the two now I'm entitled and I will respond to the two<br />
sides of it. You talked about what I said in the election<br />
speech in 1987. It was seriously said and it has been<br />
seriously followed up and it is important tonight that<br />
Commissioner Burdekin himself has said since the release of<br />
his report that it was an. appropriate and very useful thing<br />
that I've said and that we're doing. There will be an<br />
outlay of hundreds, there is now an outlay of hundreds of<br />
millions of additional dollars by this Government to give<br />
effect to that promise and it will mean that by 1990 there<br />
will be no financial need for any child in this country to<br />
live in poverty. Now in regard to the area of actual<br />
refuges again look at the record of the Government. In the<br />
period since we've been in office an increase from $ 14M to<br />
in outlays on refuges.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke you seem to have qualified your<br />
statement that no child will live in poverty in 1990 to<br />
that there will be no financial need for them to be in<br />
poverty in 1990, but the two aren't the same are they? It's<br />
a qualification? </p>
<p>-2-<br />
PM: It's not something I'm saying on your program now. I<br />
made it immediately clear from that point on because it's<br />
quite clear that no government, whether it's mine or any<br />
other, will be able to create a situation where the money<br />
having been made available into a family, that it's<br />
necessarily going to be spent. I have made it quite clear<br />
that as a result of what we do there will be no financial<br />
need for a child to live in poverty because of the outlay of<br />
the additional hundreds of millions of dollars through the<br />
family assistance supplement.<br />
JOURNALIST: But what can you tell the kids then who will be<br />
in the streets in 1990 what should they be doing?<br />
PM: the first point that we've got to make which<br />
Commissioner Burdekin made. Don't say it is a matter for<br />
Sgovernment alone. My Government or the state government or<br />
local government. It's a matter for all levels of<br />
government and it's a matter for community organisations and<br />
it's a matter for families. So I mean your question is ill<br />
founded according to Commissioner Burdekin himself. If<br />
you're saying what do we say should be done. What we've got<br />
to face up to is that this is a problem and a tragedy for<br />
the whole Australian nation. And let me say in respect to<br />
John Howard his response I welcome. What he said ( was that)<br />
this is not an issue for political point scoring and I<br />
welcome that and I respect him for it and I hope that that's<br />
the attitide that will be adopted by all state governments<br />
( break in transmission)<br />
JOURNALIST: I just return briefly to that child poverty<br />
issue for a moment. Is there anything that your Government<br />
is going to do now as a result of that Burdekin report to<br />
help those kids who are on the street?<br />
PM: Yes well we're going to continue what we have been<br />
doing and of course in the light of the report that will be<br />
now examined very closely Mike by the relevant committee<br />
here and when we've studied it I'll then of course want to<br />
talk with the State Premiers and I trust and I believe that<br />
we'll get a co-operative approach from them because as I<br />
said before this is a tragedy that transcends politics and<br />
parties and governments. I trust that once we've analysed<br />
the report we'll do it expeditiously, that we'll get the<br />
sort of co-operation from all levels of government and from<br />
the community that the dimension of the problem deserves. I<br />
would remind you that last October I made an offer of an<br />
extra $ 40M to the States for additional funding for people<br />
who are homeless and in crisis and that's an indication I<br />
think Mike of the commitment that we have and no-one can<br />
play politics on a thing like this.<br />
JOURNALIST: Well Mr Hawke given that and that aside was<br />
your promise at the Opera House in 1987 based on impressions<br />
and filling in the details later? </p>
<p>-3-<br />
PM: No of course it wasn't Barry. With respect that is<br />
quite an absurd observation. It was based upon the<br />
proposition of a considerable search that we'd done. That<br />
it was open to government if the government was sufficiently<br />
minded to undertake a massive increase in financial outlays<br />
of more than a half a billion dollars under the family<br />
allowance supplement. And that was intended as I said then<br />
to create the situation that as far as was within the<br />
financial capacity of government we would remove the<br />
financial need for poverty and by 1990 we will have done<br />
that. Now the Burdekin report is dealing with a situation<br />
of an interaction of a whole range of social factors, family<br />
breakups and so on, which are not within the power of any<br />
level of government to deal with at that level. We've got<br />
the results of that interaction of factors at the family<br />
level. What we've all as a community got to do is to see in<br />
the longer term whether there are issues that we can address<br />
which is going to minimise the breakup of families but in<br />
the meantime to ensure as Commissioner Burdekin says that<br />
the services which are provided predominantly by States are<br />
delivered more effectively and we do all that we can to<br />
co-operate in that respect.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke I wonder whether we could turn to<br />
Wesley Vale now. What is your Government going to do now<br />
that the environmental parameters if you like are clear for<br />
the operation of the Mill?<br />
PM: Well you can't say that they are clear yet. Let me say<br />
that what we'll do is abide by the agreement, the long<br />
standing agreement Bruce that we have with Premier Gray.<br />
And that long standing agreement is that once the Tasmanian<br />
Parliament has made its decision then we will deal with the<br />
matter expeditiously and as soon as the Tasmanian<br />
Parliament's done that we will deal with it.<br />
JOURNALIST: Well Mr Hawke you've probably been briefed on<br />
the latest developments and you've probably been briefed<br />
today on the State Labor Party in Tasmania, the State<br />
Opposition saying that they'll oppose the deal in the State<br />
Parliament next week. Do you belive that Robin Gray has<br />
watered down those toughest guidelines in the world that he<br />
announced in Janauary?<br />
PM: On the evidence it seems to me that he has.<br />
JOURNALIST: So what will you do Prime Minister?<br />
PM: I've just told you what I'll do. I'll adhere to my<br />
agreement as I always do and that agreement is that when the<br />
Tasmanian Parliament has made its decision, and neither you<br />
nor I can pre-empt that decision, they've got to meet and<br />
make their decision. When we are presented with that<br />
decision we will deal with it expeditiously. </p>
<p>-4-<br />
JOURNALIST: Why do you think he's watered down the<br />
guidelines? What is there to demonstrate that?<br />
PM: Well there is some evidence in regard on what I know<br />
and I've got to say this prima facie because we don't know<br />
yet what the Parliament will decide down there but in regard<br />
to the level of dioxins there seems to be some, it is<br />
suggested, change in the interpreted document that has<br />
now been agreed between Mr Gray and the joint venturers and<br />
what was said before. Now if that's what emerges from the<br />
decision of the Parliament that's something that we'll have<br />
to look at at deal with.<br />
JOURNALIST: Well given that then if Senator Richardson<br />
recommends to you and to Cabinet tougher measures designed<br />
to make the mill safe will you go along with that?<br />
PM: Well it's a valiant attempt but you must you know be<br />
very green if I may say so if you think that I'm going to<br />
answer a hypothetical question, a hypothesis on a<br />
hypothesis. we've got to first of all get the decision of<br />
the Tasmanian Parliament then on the basis of whatever that<br />
decision may be. I've got to have recommendations, it's not<br />
only Bob Hawke but the Cabinet has to have recommendations<br />
before it for my relevant Ministers on the basis of what<br />
comes out of Tasmania. Now I'm not going to pre-empt either<br />
what the Tasmanian Parliament does or says or what my<br />
Ministers recommend to me. I will make my mind up with my<br />
colleagues when I have the decision of the Parliament<br />
and the submissions put before me by my relevant<br />
ministers and that will be done in the Cabinet processes.<br />
It won't be done on any television program as much as you'd<br />
like me to do it there.<br />
JOURNALIST: But Sir, with respect, all I asked was<br />
PM: I'm an intelligent bloke, I know what you said and you<br />
don't have to repeat it. You said if Senator Richardson<br />
makes certain recommendations<br />
JOURNALIST: Designed to make the mill safe.<br />
PM: Yes, exactly. Now you ought to know if you've watched<br />
me in politics I don't answer hypothetical questions.<br />
JOURNALIST: But I think we all want a safe mill, do we not?<br />
PM: I'm sure we all want a safe mill. Look, let me make it<br />
clear in terms of the principles that will be in my mind<br />
when I consider it, and I think you're perfectly entitled to<br />
have that. I'm not trying to dodge behind this question and<br />
saying I'm not going to answer hypothetical questions. I'm<br />
happy to tell you and all my friends in Tasmania the<br />
principle that's in my mind. It's this, quite clear.<br />
Firstly, that this and future generations in Australia have<br />
a fundamental balance of payments problem and if we can have<br />
a situation where enterprise can produce outcomes which is </p>
<p>( PM cont) going to significantly improve that balance of<br />
payments situation then we have to seriously examine the<br />
project. So the project that has been put before us is<br />
going to be seriously examined. But as this Government has<br />
demonstrated in six years now, Barry, we don't support<br />
development at any price, at any cost and I can assure you,<br />
speaking for Bob Hawke and I'm sure it will be the position<br />
of all my colleagues, we will examine very very closely<br />
indeed all the evidence available as to what are suggested<br />
as the harmful effects of the proposal. We will come down<br />
with what is the right balance in our judgement between<br />
Australia's desire to improve its external accounts position<br />
and the obligation that is upon all levels of government to<br />
ensure that development doesn't proceed at a price which is<br />
legitimately unacceptable for this and future generations.<br />
Now I can't, having said that Barry, answer the hypothetical<br />
question you put until I know precisely from the decision of<br />
the Tasmanian parliament what it is that we're dealing with<br />
and then what recommendations I'm dealing with with my<br />
ministers. JOURNALIST: Money comes into it does it?<br />
PM: Of course money comes into it. Money comes into every<br />
decision that every individual<br />
JOURNALIST: $ 300 million worth<br />
PM: There may be an<br />
JOURNALIST: PM: No, no, that's what is suggested by the venturers. Now<br />
I don't necessarily accept that that's the accurate figure.<br />
JOURNALIST: But your press statement of the 17th of October<br />
quotes you as saying it will mean up to $ 300 million net<br />
annual addition<br />
PM: And as you quote, " up to" is right, because one uses<br />
the phrase " up to" because these are the figures that are<br />
put. Now I don't necessarily accept every figure that is<br />
put. I didn't say it will mean that and the figures are<br />
part of the close examination that will have to be<br />
undertaken by the ministers who make the recommendations to<br />
us. In other words, part of the analysis will have to be<br />
what's the best decision you can make as to the likely<br />
effect on Australia's current account situation over a<br />
projected period of 20 years or so to try and get that<br />
figure as accurately as you can. And against that you'll<br />
have to try and assess as clearly as you can what is the<br />
harm that on the best evidence may be done environmentally,<br />
on land and in the ocean.<br />
JOURNALIST: Can I just move on to the issue of Salman<br />
Rushdie shortly for a moment. Why haven't you taken strong<br />
diplomatic action to make sure that Tehran realises that<br />
what they're on about isn't accepted? </p>
<p>-6-<br />
PM: Well, we have taken strong action. We have conveyed in<br />
the very clearest words that the action Mike of the<br />
Ayatollah and those around him offends all sensible and<br />
decent principles of international relationships. That is<br />
our position.<br />
JOURNALIST: It's not a very strong reproach though is it<br />
when you compare it to European nations and to Canada where<br />
they've actually withdrawn heads of delegations.<br />
PM: They have withdrawn heads of delegations, I accept<br />
that, but I could not have conveyed, it could not have been<br />
conveyed more clearly to the authorities what our position<br />
is. Now quite frankly I'm not trying to do dodge this<br />
issue. We will and are looking at whether it is appropriate<br />
to take further action and indeed I've had some discussions<br />
this afternoon with Gareth Evans, my foreign minister, and<br />
it may be that we will take further action. But at this<br />
stage what was necessary we thought was to leave the<br />
authorities in Iran in no doubt at all, no doubt at all,<br />
that this sort of tactic of threatening to execute someone<br />
who has had the temerity to express a point of view with<br />
which you disagree, that that's not on, it's not acceptable.<br />
Now it may be as I say that it's appropriate having done<br />
that to take further measures.<br />
JOURNALIST: Would you withdraw your Ambassador from Tehran<br />
if Salman Rushdie lived in Australia?<br />
PM: You're a very good bloke at hypothetical questions. I<br />
suppose that if the person involved was an Australian<br />
citizen you would have a more compelling set of imperatives<br />
operating on you Barry. But I'm not ruling out, let me make<br />
it clear, I'm not ruling out the possibility of something<br />
more than we've done, but I think in the conduct of<br />
relations between countries there is an argument for not<br />
necessarily playing all your cards at once, provided that as<br />
a matter of principle you've made it clear to the government<br />
with which you're dealing that an act which is unacceptable<br />
is understood by them as being such in your judgement. Now<br />
that we've done, and it is legitimate now, quite legitimate<br />
to ask the question in the light of further developments<br />
whether more should be done. We are considering that.<br />
JOURNALIST: So does that mean that the principle waters<br />
down, depends on the distance<br />
PM: No it doesn't. It may be a clever way which satisfies<br />
your sense of drama of putting it. It's not. I'm simply<br />
saying quite honestly that we immediately made the position<br />
clear and we will consider if more needs to be done. I<br />
honestly if it was an Australian citizen whose life was<br />
being threatened it is in the nature of events true of every<br />
nation that every nation gets more concerned, more involved,<br />
indeed has a greater direct responsibility in regard to its<br />
own citizens. There's nothing strange about that, of course<br />
each national government around the world has the greatest </p>
<p>-7-<br />
( PM cont) responsibility for its own citizens. But we live<br />
in an international, interrelated world and so we did<br />
express a view on international principles if you like.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you have any fears about our trade imbalance<br />
with Iran if in fact we do go the whole hog and decide to<br />
withdraw our head of delegation? As I understand it we have<br />
exports of about $ 400 million a year to Iran<br />
PM: Sure, sure. I can best answer that question by getting<br />
out of that field of hypothesis and getting down to what<br />
we've been prepared to do. When the Gulf conflict was on<br />
between Iran and Iraq there was a request made to me, to the<br />
Government, for the provision of Australian personnel who<br />
would be expert in mine detection and it was said to me,<br />
part of the advice that came to me was no we shouldn't do<br />
that because if we were to do that that would have an<br />
adverse impact in the areas that you're talking about,<br />
adversely impact on our trade. Now I said well yes it may<br />
have that but I believe that in the circumstances that<br />
existed at that time it was appropriate that Australia<br />
should make that contribution, we couldn't be just leaving<br />
it to others. So we indicated that we were prepared and did<br />
make available those personnel. So I can show to you on the<br />
historical record that I won't allow considerations of trade<br />
to stand in the way of what I believe is the appropriate<br />
decision as I've demonstrated there. In this case obviously<br />
I won't allow trading considerations to stand in the way if<br />
in fact as I look at it with my colleague the foreign<br />
minister and others it seems to me that we need to take the<br />
next step. But it seems that Australia's interests and<br />
Australians generally would, say, approve of an approach<br />
where government has said we've told the government of Iran<br />
that sort of conduct is simply not acceptable and then to<br />
know that the government is keeping the situation under<br />
review and that if it's appropriate will go further.<br />
O JOURNALIST: Can I leave that issue now and go back to<br />
Tasmanian issues and the first point is forestry.<br />
Conservationists in the southern forests are back into<br />
direct action again today suggesting that the forest accord<br />
between Tasmania and the Federal Government has been broken.<br />
Does it take action by them, this is the Federal Government,<br />
to wake up to responsibilities you've got on that accord?<br />
PM: I regard the question as offensive but I'm not going to<br />
get upset about it. It's deliberately offensively put. We<br />
have an agreement with the Tasmanian government and we will<br />
honour that agreement. I don't accept that it's not being<br />
honoured despite, for your own purposes, how offensively you<br />
want to put a question. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Just back on Wesley Vale, are you concerned or<br />
disturbed and you remember the Franklin Dam and the works<br />
that the hydroelectric commission continued until the High<br />
Court stopped the dam and you paid out $ 50 million for that<br />
work. Are you concerned that the Wesley Vale pulp mill<br />
developers have already started work on Wesley Vale on the<br />
pulp mill?<br />
PM: what they have done, as I understand it, they've<br />
started to put some road or the basis of a road in there.<br />
Let me make it quite clear, in a situation like this they do<br />
that in a sense at their own risk because they know what the<br />
situation is.<br />
JOURNALIST: I'm sorry, we've run out of time, we're right<br />
at 8 o'clock, we'll have to leave it there. I'm sorry for<br />
the hiccoughs and thank you for joining us.<br />
PM: It's been my pleasure, thank you very much indeed.<br />
