<p> Today the Gillard Government released new figures that confirm increases in the overall funding allocations for every school, in every schooling sector, in Queensland over the next six years.</p>
<p>  The figures show that, under the Gillard Government's National Plan for School Improvement, Queensland Government schools will receive a boost of around $3.3 billion, while non-government schools will benefit from more than $500 million over the next six years.</p>
<p>  The data is based on the $3.8 billion of extra funding on offer to all Queensland schools provided the Newman Government signs up by the June 30 deadline  -  just nine days from now.</p>
<p>  Labor's National Plan for School Improvement will deliver:</p>
<p>   *  More one on one attention and support in the classroom for every child;</p>
<p>   *  Specialist literacy and numeracy programs for children in danger of being left behind;</p>
<p>   *  Greater assistance for those students with disability or special need; and</p>
<p>   *  Building the skills of teachers and providing mentoring support for new teachers.     </p>
<p> Premier Campbell Newman and Education Minister John-Paul Langbroek must put the students of Queensland first and sign up to the National Plan for School Improvement.</p>
<p>  This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to deliver the biggest investment in schools in generations. </p>
<p>  There is a very clear choice now before the LNP Government.</p>
<p>  Signing up to the new, fairer funding system, will benefit every sector and every Queensland school. Continuing to play politics and refusing to sign will result in students being left behind.</p>
<p>  In a state the size of Queensland, there are many schools in remote and regional areas that require extra support and extra resources. That is precisely what our plan delivers.</p>
<p>  Every single one of Queensland's 1700 schools will benefit from increased funding under the funding offer we put to the Queensland LNP Government on 14 April, some 89 days ago. </p>
<p>  Today is the last day of the school term before students break for winter holidays.</p>
<p>  With just over a week remaining until the deadline, time is rapidly running out for Mr Newman to sign on to this funding offer.</p>
