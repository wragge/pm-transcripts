TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH JOHN LAWS, CANBERRA, 13 FEBRUARY 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
JL And on the line from our Canberra studio, the Prime Minister of<br />
Australia Paul Keating. Good Morning Prime Minister.<br />
PM: How are you John?<br />
JL What a good thing you didn't want to come and visit us in our studio's<br />
in Sydney because you would have had some difficulty out at that<br />
airport.<br />
PM: Yes, apparently I would have. But I think it is clearing<br />
JL: No, I'm not talking about a fog, I am talking about a protest.<br />
PM; Yes, so am I.<br />
JL Well I hope the protest is clearing is it coincidental that the control<br />
tower for the East-West runway won't be opened until after the NSW<br />
State elections? It wouldn't be politicking on Mr Brereton's behalf<br />
would it?<br />
PM: No. There is a brand new control system a completely<br />
system and it is important that it goes into place in<br />
guarantee's everybody's safety and the efficiency<br />
operations. It is a very large change from a cross runway<br />
parallel runways... new control<br />
a way that<br />
of aircraft<br />
pattern to 2<br />
JL Plus a cross one....<br />
PM: And a cross one on the bad cross wind days.<br />
JL So it is just coincidental? </p>
<p>PM: Indeed.<br />
JL: OK I also hear on the rumour vine that there's a possibility that you<br />
may announce today that Ricky Stuart will Captain the Canberra<br />
Raiders? Any truth in that?<br />
PM: Well it may be true, but I won't be announcing it.<br />
JL You won't?<br />
PM: It's not for me to announce, but I.. Prime Minister's are made of many<br />
parts, but announcing the Captains of rugby league teams isn't part of<br />
it.<br />
JL Well I think your predecessor might have been delighted to do it. He<br />
liked that sort of thing.<br />
PM: Well, he had a great interest, and maintains a great interest but so do<br />
but not to the point of announcing the Captaincy of teams.<br />
JL: Anyway, if somebody offers you a wager, I would put money on...<br />
PM: Yes, get your money on Ricky I would say that's right.<br />
JL: I would say it's right, too. OK, when you or when the Government<br />
framed the Budget last year, you said that the deficit the gap between<br />
your revenue and your planned spending would be $ 11.7 billion.<br />
There were no spending cuts there, there were no tax increases<br />
despite the " deficit daleks" as you called them calling for stronger<br />
Government action to reduce the size of the deficit, have you now<br />
become a " deficit dalek"?<br />
PM: No. A " deficit dalek" is somebody who believes that the Budget deficit<br />
can never be small enough, or the surplus large enough, in any<br />
circumstances even in the recession, these people, when the<br />
Government deficit.. when the shock absorber effect of the Budget<br />
should be to let Government spending run somewhat to help the<br />
economy when private investment is low the daleks always believe in<br />
surpluses. In other words, stick it to them, make them take the<br />
medicine it's almost like a knee-jerk response, and there's a fair few<br />
of them they're in the financial markets and what have you, and the<br />
reason they are John.... . see, these are people who are basically<br />
punting securities around the world, and trading in foreign exchange<br />
and their interest is not in the Australian economy, in growth or<br />
employment, or the lot of Australian business, but only how they can<br />
protect the investment that somebody has made in Australia via the<br />
exchange rate or the interest rate... </p>
<p>JL Ok, well when you say that their attitude is " stick it them, make them<br />
take it" there would be a lot of people out there listening to us across<br />
God's great garden who would reckon that you have stuck it to them a<br />
bit, and that you have made them take it, and now there's talk about<br />
interest rates and tax increases as well isn't that kind of sticking it to<br />
them a bit?<br />
PM: We gave more tax cuts in our period of office than any Government in<br />
history, and including the last one which we gave in the end of 1993,<br />
so...<br />
JL But you were going to give some more that were going to be that<br />
boring " l-a-w tax"?<br />
PM: We had 2 tax cuts legislated we brought one forward, and we have<br />
put one back, and the one we put back you will hear about in this<br />
year's budget.<br />
JL But are we going to hear about it happening?<br />
PM: You will hear about it. But let me just make this clear to you because<br />
the Government said we will put it back probably until 1998 that is<br />
what I said, and what the then-Treasurer John Dawkins said 2 years<br />
ago.<br />
JL But prior to the election, they were and they were going . you<br />
didn't put I mean, people anticipated that they would happen shortly<br />
after the election, not several years after.<br />
PM: No. The first lot happened earlier than planned after the election, and<br />
they were paid at the end of 1993. But when I said that they were I-aw<br />
law", that meant that they had passed the House of Representatives<br />
and the Senate to be paid...<br />
JL Yeah?<br />
PM: . to change them, the Government had to secure the support of the<br />
House of Representatives and the Senate. Which it did by paying one<br />
lot earlier and putting one back.<br />
JL Well nobody's knocking back the second lot are they? You're just not<br />
giving them?<br />
PM: Well again, we paid the first lot, and what's happened since then is<br />
that the requirements of fiscal policy that is, because the economy is<br />
growing even more strongly than we estimated, and employment's<br />
growing even more strongly than we estimated means that to put a<br />
second round of tax cuts in the market say this year, would have been<br />
the wrong time for everybody. So are you doing people a favour you </p>
<p>pay them a tax cut this year which they then lose with wage or price<br />
inflation.<br />
JL Well I don't know if you are doing them a favour or not, but obviously<br />
somebody whether it was you or somebody else under-estimated<br />
the growth that this place would take on it escalated rapidly, and<br />
obviously somebody made a mistake with the " l-a-w law" tax cuts?<br />
PM: Well listen ( inaudible) the person I opposed at the last election, John<br />
Hewson, told us in the last week of the election campaign that we<br />
would now be in a depression he started with a double-dip recession,<br />
and then a depression. Well we have now got the fastest growth of<br />
any western world economy, with low inflation.<br />
JL: But you try and explain that to the people out there who are hearing<br />
about interest rate rises, and the possibility of not tax cuts but<br />
tax rises they don't quite understand why if this place is blossoming<br />
the way it is and it is on paper why it isn't....<br />
PM: John; let's forget the " on paper"' business it is everywhere. We have<br />
had the largest fall in unemployment ever in the last 12 months. We<br />
have had the largest fall... . let me just make these points to you. The<br />
unemployment rate fell by 1.7% in 1994 the largest calendar fall year<br />
in our history. We have now got over the highest number of<br />
Australians ever in work over 8 million since the election, the<br />
Government has created 494,000 jobs from its policies. That is 700<br />
jobs a day.<br />
JL But the Government hasn't created those jobs the private sector has<br />
created those jobs.<br />
PM: It has come from if anything goes wrong, it's Government policy, if<br />
anything goes right it's the private sector, Of course it's been the<br />
Government's policy with the private sector. One Nation stimulated the<br />
economy and got the growth back essentially John, the Government<br />
was re-hired in 1993 to restart growth and employment. That was the<br />
key issue of the election, that was the key commitment, and the key<br />
issue, and the key commitments have been met.<br />
JL OK but at what cost? The size of this deficit?<br />
PM: Sorry?<br />
JL: At what cost? I mean, these things are... . theoretically forget on paper<br />
theoretically, all those things that you're saying are absolutely<br />
correct, but the people who are listening to us across Australia now<br />
feel that something is wrong, and can't understand why there have to<br />
be hikes in interest rates and why there have to be possible tax </p>
<p>increases and why there have to be perhaps cuts in other areas when<br />
everything is supposedly rosy in the garden?<br />
PM: Well they feel that something is wrong because the media has now<br />
stopped talking about unemployment, and they have started talking<br />
about the current account deficit. You see, a balanced appraisal of<br />
Australia's circumstances shows us to be very greatly advantaged<br />
compared to comparable countries.<br />
JL: Yes.<br />
PM: I mean, here we are in Europe where the average rate of growth is<br />
about 1.6% the Australian rate of growth is 5.5% 6%.<br />
JL: Yes, but it is hurting us.<br />
PM: Well it's not hurting the people getting a job, John. Tell them that try<br />
and get that message over.<br />
JL: OK, but it is hurting somebody, otherwise you wouldn't have to talk<br />
about proposed tax increases or interest rates rises?<br />
PM: Let me come to that in a moment, but all I'm trying to say to you is let's<br />
get the balance right what was the Government's principal<br />
commitments in the election campaign? To restart growth and<br />
employment. How did we do it? By bringing the One Nation spending<br />
arrangements into place, and the One Nation tax cuts into place, in<br />
1990, and those tax cuts were paid at the end of 1993. That kicked the<br />
growth along, and it kicked the employment along. But what it has also<br />
kicked along is a very big investment phase. We have now got 24%<br />
growth in investment, and because investment is essentially about<br />
producer goods and this country, in the main, doesn't produce<br />
producer goods like mainframe computers, computer-operated<br />
machine tools, this sort of thing there is always a bulge in any<br />
investment phase in the trade accounts in the current account. That is<br />
what we are seeing now, and we have seen quite a bit of spending<br />
-private consumption over the last year or so. What the interest rate<br />
rises were about, was essentially smoothing that. That is, taking some<br />
of that spending out of the economy, and the reason the Government<br />
believes that it is prudent now to tighten policy for the Budget, is to<br />
make that growth and employment growth sustainable. In other words,<br />
the hardest thing that we can do and to give Australians is a<br />
maintenance of this strong growth, strong employment, low inflation<br />
recovery.<br />
JL: OK Now it isn't true the investment that you talk about, which has<br />
provided the growth has come about because of considerable<br />
borrowing from overseas, which has cause the blow-out if you want to </p>
<p>call it that, and they do in the deficit? That the money has come from<br />
overseas because there's not a large enough saving pool in Australia?<br />
PM: That's true.<br />
JL: So if all that being true, why is it then that you make it tough for people<br />
to save because if you had $ 100 and somebody said to you and<br />
meant it that unless you spend that $ 100 in the next few minutes, I'm<br />
going to take $ 20 away from you, you would spend it wouldn't you?<br />
PM: No. Why does the country have a relatively modest propensity to<br />
save? I mean, why is there that modest likelihood to save<br />
JL: Because, I believe, you tax savings.<br />
PM: No. The answer is because of 2 decades of double-digit inflation.<br />
That's why. We have so inculcated into people's minds that they<br />
shouldn't keep money in the bank, they couldn't keep money in savings<br />
accounts, they shouldn't keep them in fixed-interest securities they<br />
should have them in real property they should have them in a flat, a<br />
holiday house or something else because what the last 2 decades<br />
have shown is that if they hang onto it, inflation will tear the hell out of<br />
it. Now that's the point I make...<br />
JL: So it's got nothing<br />
PM: Well that's the point I make about our friends in the Liberal and the<br />
National Parties. I mean, they left it to the Labor Party to break the<br />
back of Australian inflation. I mean, in the recession on 1980-81, we<br />
came out of it with 11 inflation. We came out of the last recession in<br />
1989-90-91 with 2% inflation.<br />
JL: Yeah. So, are you telling me that people are so pre-conditioned and<br />
they're so bovine in their attitude to things like their own money that<br />
they just out of habit, don't save it.<br />
PM: Well forget the bovine description. One thing is very clear. There is<br />
an inculcation in the public mind of this country that anybody who had<br />
a lump sum in cash in 1970 or 1980 now finds that has been massively<br />
cut to pieces by it's purchasing power through high inflation...<br />
JL: So what do you do...<br />
PM: . and they believe that the neighbour next door, the person next door<br />
who bought a flat or a second property or something like that, actually<br />
saved the value of their savings. Now this comes from the high<br />
inflation mentality. The Government has broken the back of inflation,<br />
and we have got inflation somewhere between And we have it<br />
there for about 3 years, and in 3 years you don't change the savings </p>
<p>mind of the country. In other words, there hasn't been a long enough<br />
period of a return to the good times of low inflation to convince people<br />
that basically they ought to increase their discretionary saving. So<br />
what happens when you have a big investment phase like we're having<br />
now which we need for the jobs, and which we need for our<br />
productive base....<br />
JL: Yeah, but the money is borrowed from overseas, so why don't we<br />
encourage a savings pool in Australia?<br />
PM: Well, we have done that...<br />
JL: Well it hasn't worked.<br />
PM: . well, we're doing it in a non-discretionary way from the middle<br />
with Award Superannuation. And we have now got 6% of everybody's<br />
income on the 1 st of July this year the taxi meter turns over again,<br />
and another 1 to 6% the whole nation saving 6% of their income.<br />
Now, without that... . and that has now added to the pool of savings<br />
about $ 300 billion $ 300 thousand million. So, we are getting it up.<br />
And one of the other ways that you can save is for the public sector to<br />
save by going back into surplus, and what the Treasurer said a week<br />
or two ago, and what I have said in this period, is that as we go to the<br />
second half on the 90s, in the medium-term the requirement is going to<br />
be to add to our savings, and the public sector can do a bit more by the<br />
Budget moving back more quickly than it might have otherwise into<br />
surplus.<br />
JL: OK Well now all the headlines after the 1994-95 Budget was that it<br />
was a gamble on growth. I always felt that the 1994 Budget was a<br />
make good for the 1993 Budget that caused you some problems,<br />
particularly with the Independents from the West is it true that the<br />
1994-95 Budget was bothersome to you because you didn't want to go<br />
through the ritual that you had to go through to get the last Budget<br />
cleared?<br />
PM: No. We made.... . there are 2 points about the 1994 Budget worth<br />
making. The 1993 Budget the Budget John Dawkins presented you<br />
are right, we had so much trouble with in the Senate because John<br />
Hewson's Opposition opposed every measure and we relied on the<br />
Democrats and the Greens to get it passed, that Budget...<br />
JL: But that took a bit of talking, didn't it?<br />
PM: It did. And why did it? Because for the first time in history the<br />
Opposition the Liberal Party and the National Party took the<br />
unprincipled stand of opposing the Government's Budget measures in<br />
the Senate. </p>
<p>JL: But didn't you think that there was a possibility that might happen again<br />
in 1994-95, so you made it a bit softer?<br />
PM: You have already asked me, let me just give you this answer in 1993,<br />
we put in changes worth to the Budget, to the Fiscal Policy over time,<br />
of $ 9 billion. Now, those changes came in, that was increases in sales<br />
tax, petrol prices etc, they came in at various other times in 1994 and<br />
in 1995 this year. So in other words, we believed that in 1994 we had<br />
a fiscal change already embedded from 1993s sufficient for the growth<br />
which we had forecast. But remember this John, we forecast in the 94<br />
Budget an increase in private investment of 14.5%, and we had<br />
you're right, as you said a moment ago the headlines the Government<br />
gambles on growth they have got these overly optimistic growth<br />
assessments, and we had Mr Costello running around saying " where's<br />
the investment, where's the investment?". Well it turns out we had<br />
24% investment. Not only did we make 14.5%, but we exceeded it by<br />
And it's that big bubble of investment, which has come because<br />
of the very propitious conditions of low inflation and competitiveness,<br />
and the tax system and everything, which has produced now a big<br />
bubble of investment which has put pressure on the current account,<br />
which now our policy that is fiscal policy and monetary policy etc<br />
has been responding to that...<br />
JL: OK<br />
PM: in other words, the Government has been doing the perfectly<br />
reasonable, sensible thing in the circumstance.<br />
JL: OK, but explain now why you want to reign in Government spending,<br />
for which I incidentally applaud you, and think you should do it more,<br />
and why you want to put up taxes, for which I don't applaud you? I<br />
mean, why is that happening if growth in the economy was better than<br />
it was forecast to be?<br />
PM: Let's say that the Government does nothing about it. Let's say we<br />
haven't adjusted interest rates, and we don't touch fiscal policy. And<br />
we keep blasting along at and we have spending running at 2<br />
percentage points faster than our production in the economy. That's<br />
what we have had we have had spending running at and we<br />
have production running at Well obviously if you are only<br />
producing growth at and you have got spending at 2% is<br />
going to fall into imports in the current account. So in other words, the<br />
thing has got a " get up and go" about it, which is even stronger than<br />
anyone believed....<br />
JL: Well that's<br />
PM:.... which is a good thing, a good thing but let's make sure it's a<br />
sustainable thing. </p>
<p>JL: OK But that forecast that growth forecast for a 5 year period will<br />
this 24% keep going for 5 years?<br />
PM: Investment?<br />
JL: Yes.<br />
PM: No we had 14.5% in for private capital investment....<br />
JL: Yes.<br />
PM:' That's where the jobs come from when businesses invest, that's<br />
where the employment comes form. We had 14.5%, and we had all<br />
the pundits as usual " Oh, the Government gambles on growth the<br />
Government gambles on growth" turns out, as always, we were<br />
conservative, and the growth came in at 24% for investment, so the<br />
sensible thing is, John, if people want a pro-growth, a strong growth<br />
and low inflation economy where inflation is not tearing the hell out of<br />
their savings, and ruining their competitiveness, and ruining the<br />
Nation's competitiveness to export and sell abroad the thing to do is<br />
to modestly reduce it. And that is what we'll be doing.<br />
JL: OK The expectation was that businesses would start to use those<br />
increasing profits for capital investment, and generate job growth,<br />
which they did to a degree.<br />
PM: Which they did massively. I mean the point is that the biggest fall in<br />
the unemployment rate ever fullstop. We have had John, let me<br />
give you the figures again since the election, and it's not that long<br />
ago it's 2 years next month we have had half a million jobs. When<br />
the Government came out in the election and said our target is<br />
500,000 in 3 years, the Liberal Party laughed at it, John Hewson said it<br />
was a hoax. We have met the half million in 2 years in other words,<br />
we have met the target in two-thirds of the time. It's been the largest<br />
growth in employment that we have seen, and that is a great thing for<br />
this country a much more fully employed society than we have now<br />
got the unemployment rate at around from 10.7%, which is a<br />
tremendous achievement for the country.<br />
JL: Define full employment in Australia?<br />
PM: Well I know it is very hard to say what full employment is because in<br />
an economy where there is so much structural change you know, to<br />
the information industries, to information technology, out of some of the<br />
older low paid unskilled jobs that you will always have a pool of what<br />
was once called " structural unemployed", and it is very hard to say now<br />
how large that pool is. Some people believe it is about 6%. </p>
<p>JL: Do you?<br />
PM: Well, it's not zero. And what the Government has said is we want to<br />
get unemployment around 5% by the year 2000, and we are well and<br />
truly on the way.<br />
JL: And would you call that full employment?<br />
PM: Well it's going to be in terms of the debate about structural<br />
employment, it's going to be, I think, relatively near to it.<br />
JL: OK So somewhere between zero and<br />
PM: Well, it may be it may 5.25%, it may be 5.5% I mean, who<br />
knows? If you look at every economy in the world today, where you<br />
have got this flux in the labour market, with this huge change in the<br />
productive base, and increase in the service industries etc, information<br />
industries you have just got a tremendous structural change all the<br />
time.<br />
JL: OK Talking to the people to whom I talk on this radio program around<br />
Australia, it would appear to me that unemployment would be<br />
considerably improved if we didn't have the problems that we have in<br />
the industrial relations area?<br />
PM: Before I leave the Budget, can I just say this we have got all this<br />
debate about what the Government will do and not do, and this is<br />
because of some document which has been leaked to the Opposition.<br />
Now, you realise John, every year that I have been a Minister, we have<br />
had such documents produced they have no status, they have the<br />
status only of being documents that come from the bureaucracy. Now,<br />
I would just like to make a couple of points about this. John Howard<br />
got a communication from Andrew Robb his Federal Director from<br />
his advertising agency that said " surely the object until budget time is<br />
to make every welfare recipient feel like they're about to lose it, and if<br />
they don't lose it this time, they'll lose it next time". Howard then<br />
started opportunistically leaking this sort of material, and you might<br />
notice in the Sydney Morning Herald today in Mr Gittins' column and<br />
which says " Howard sabotages expenditure cut", and it starts off " John<br />
Howard's unprincipled attack on the Government's alleged spending<br />
cuts carries a warning to all those people who want the budget<br />
returned to surplus, but are implacably opposed to tax increases.<br />
Their stand and that is the Liberals " is a recipe for fiscal failure.<br />
Let's be clear from the outset: Mr* Howard's behaviour is unprincipled.<br />
It is unprincipled because it is hypocritical. Here are the party and the<br />
man who've been insisting for years that the Government slash its<br />
spending, turning all the guns on it [ the Government] at the first sign it<br />
[ the Government] may follow their advice. It's unprincipled because it's<br />
a blatant campaign to scare' the electorate, particularly the most </p>
<p>financially vulnerable: the elderly, the sick and the jobless." Now, that<br />
is what he says Mr Gittins and before I go on, can I make this quote<br />
from the weekend, the Sunday Age, and it says this " Canberra is<br />
awash with pre-Budget leaks courtesy of the Federal Opposition, but<br />
you are not supposed to know that. Continuing its pre-Budget policy of<br />
scaring the wits out of welfare recipients, the Opposition yesterday<br />
tried to convince media that it had further damning evidence of cuts<br />
planned by the Keating Government. This may or may not be true, but<br />
Opposition officials would not permit the Sunday Age to view the<br />
documents, and it said that they had to be anonymous: ' we will give<br />
you details of further proposed Budget cuts worth millions, but you will<br />
not under any circumstances source it back to us' and it goes on to<br />
say, " the question is, if not then can I source the information to the<br />
Opposition? ' we do not want it to be connected in any way to us.<br />
Why not? Because we do not, we do not want you to approach our<br />
Leaders office or any of our Shadow Ministers.' Now in other words,<br />
here is the Opposition running around Parliament House, handing this<br />
stuff out in this case Mr Paul Daley, the National Affairs Commentator<br />
with the Sunday Age saying these things to them, and then saying<br />
" look, can I say that it came from you, and this is the source of the<br />
documents?" They won't show them the documents, and they don't<br />
want them to say that it came from them. See, John Howard wants<br />
everyone to think Honest John Howard, but if John gets a choice<br />
between doing something the slick and slippery way, he will always<br />
take it, and what we're seeing here... he could have started his<br />
leadership off with a stand of principle and said " I do believe in cuts in<br />
Government spending we had been advocating $ 5-10 billion<br />
ourselves, therefore we will see what the Government now does with<br />
this Budget", and then attack the Budget if they want to. But what they<br />
are trying to do is run around and scare people about cuts to welfare<br />
recipients and other people which the Government has traditionally<br />
looked after.<br />
JL: Yeah, but these are scare tactics John Howard told me on this<br />
program that he believed in the cutting of Government spending, I think<br />
he has made it quite public that he does but tell me, how did you win<br />
the last election?<br />
PM: By saying that the Government will restart growth and employment<br />
growth.<br />
JL: But also, by saying just prior to the election, perhaps not you as an<br />
individual, but certainly collectively, by scare tactics about the GST, so<br />
people do tend to use scare tactics.<br />
PM: Yes, but the GST was a fact, it wasn't a scare. I mean, the difference<br />
between a scare and a fact, this is a list prepared by officials of a<br />
whole lot of draconian measures which the Government has shown in<br />
the past when these lists have been presented, it has not accepted. </p>
<p>The GST was a fact of life, it was going to add 15 per cent to<br />
everybody's cost of living.<br />
JL: Apart from all the indirect taxes that were going to be removed.<br />
PM: Yes, but the net gain to the Budget from it was enormous. And, people<br />
would have found that the beneficiaries of the GST would have been<br />
those on high incomes and the people on lower and middle incomes<br />
would have carried the burden. So, I mean, what you are saying John,<br />
how dare we or any of us had the hide to say ' this GST will actually<br />
hurt you.' Well, it was fact of life, it was their direct promise, it would<br />
have been implemented and it would have hurt people. So, I don't<br />
accept the fact that was a scare tactic. It is a truth.<br />
JL: In light of what Brian Howe said yesterday, do you think that the<br />
Opposition may change its attitude. I mean, he said the Government<br />
had already done and I quote " all the hard work" in reference to finding<br />
out where to cut expenditure. Again, I defend your right to continue to<br />
look at ways to cut spending, but there are members of the Cabinet<br />
who continue to argue that all the hard work has been done, that the<br />
job of the Government is now to be generous with the tax payers..<br />
PM: No, that wasn't what he was saying. Look, he was paraphrasing<br />
something I think I've said before. In the 1980s we cut spending back<br />
by $ 30,000 million and we cut it back carefully having clear regard for<br />
the most needy and without hurting those who shouldn't be hurt.<br />
That's what we did. We cut it back, I think, intelligently, carefully,<br />
compassionately. Now, we are now back to a relatively small public<br />
sector with outlays around 25 or 26 per cent of GOP and what this<br />
savings list the Opposition has shows is all this nonsense about lets<br />
cut out $ 10 billion of spending from waste and duplication. Well, there<br />
is no waste and duplication worth $ 10 billion on the list. What's on the<br />
list is all hard tack. In other words, there are no easy savings left and<br />
that is because we did cut back $ 30 billion in the 1980s. Now, the<br />
people who go on saying, and you often hear Peter Costello and you'll<br />
hear Howard " well, we'll get into outlays cuts, but we will cut out the<br />
waste and duplication" and it sounds a slick easy line, but wait to they<br />
run into a finance official and they see a list. They won't find anything<br />
that approaches that sort of money from waste and duplication. You've<br />
got to cut programs. You have got to cut payments to people.<br />
JL: So, what are you going to cut?<br />
PM: Well, we will do, just back us in on our record. I mean, when I became<br />
Treasurer in 1983, when I followed John Howard, Commonwealth<br />
spending was 30.6 per cent of Gross Domestic Product. When I left, it<br />
was 23.6 a full 7 percentage points that is $ 35 billion a year<br />
reduction. In other words, John Howard was the biggest taxer and the<br />
biggest spender in Australian history, he had a 60 per cent top </p>
<p>marginal rate, a 46 per cent company rate, he had revenue to GDP at<br />
26 per cent, he had outlays to GDP at 30.5 per cent, he was the<br />
biggest spender and the biggest taxer ever and we've now produced<br />
the lowest revenue share in the western world, this is the lowest taxed<br />
country bar one country, Turkey, the lowest taxed country of the 27<br />
member states of the OECD and we have got outlays such now that we<br />
have got a very small federal public sector. So therefore, any further<br />
cutting has got to be very carefully done.<br />
JL When Brian Howe was talking he was also talking about spending on<br />
public housing, but I think he used words similar to " I would like to do<br />
to public housing what we did to Medicare" or words to that effect.<br />
Does that mean he wants to put a levy on public..<br />
PM: No, not necessarily. I mean, I think, a lot of it is about using the public<br />
housing stock more efficiently perhaps than it has been used in the<br />
past. We have had a thing called the Commonwealth State Housing<br />
( CSHA) Agreement which pumps a lot of money into the States every<br />
year and I think there has been a lot of misgivings about how well the<br />
CSHA money is being used. That is, whether or not the housing stock<br />
has been officially managed. It is not all about extra money.<br />
JL Well, what will it be about if he says that he wants to do to public<br />
housing what he did to Medicare?<br />
PM: What it will be about is making certain that those who are less well off<br />
and disadvantaged can reasonably believe that their housing needs<br />
will be accommodated, either in the public or the private sector.<br />
JL Should the Government have a greater say over how ATSIC spends<br />
the tax payers money in the delivery of health and welfare to<br />
Aborigines or should it be the other way around or should ATSIC be<br />
partner with Government on health spending?<br />
PM: Well, I think, I mean ATSIC was a very large change in the way the<br />
Commonwealth administers funding for Aboriginal and Torres Strait<br />
Islander people. Formerly it was done by a Commonwealth<br />
department and while that Commonwealth department had some<br />
indigenous influences about it, by and large it was like every other<br />
Commonwealth department. So, the change to ATSIC was a change<br />
to give Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people a say in the<br />
spending that goes to their communities. The problem with health is<br />
that it is for a start, long standing arises from primary health<br />
problems such as water, sewerage and basic infrastructure as well as<br />
medical care. So, trying to deal with it is complex and I think what the<br />
ATSIC funding for health probably shows is that unless we deal with<br />
these primary health matters as well, such as infrastructure, no single<br />
agency is going to be able to solve the problem. </p>
<p>JL: So, you haven't answered the question. Should this be handed over to<br />
Carmen Lawrence's department?<br />
PM: Understand this John, like most things, my life is a life of complex<br />
issues.<br />
JL: Yes.<br />
PM: Yours is often a life of simple statements. Life isn't simple here, it is<br />
complex. That's why I'm saddled up with this job and your saddled up<br />
with yours.<br />
JL: My life is a life of simple questions, the simple question is, should it be<br />
handed to Carmen Lawrence's department or should it not?<br />
PM: But, they are not simple answers and that is the point I am making.<br />
There was a very good piece in the paper today from Noel Pearson<br />
from the Cape York Land Council in The Australian talking about the<br />
complexities of health delivery for Aboriginal people. For a start you<br />
have got to get the communities interested and into it. You have got<br />
communities that are not into the habits of health protection and health<br />
care as the non-Aboriginal community of Australia is. So, for a start,<br />
you have got to sign the community up to be in these things and<br />
secondly, you have got to have the infrastructure there. So, the<br />
Government will be examining the whole issue of Aboriginal health<br />
again in the Budget because the Budget is the annual occasion where<br />
we set the expenditure priorities of the Government and the policy.<br />
JL: Because a lot of money is spent on Aboriginal health, but obviously<br />
from what one reads it is not being spent the right way. I mean, there<br />
is $ 54 million and it appears the health of the Aboriginal people is<br />
getting worse and not better. So, it is being mishandled and I mean we<br />
have a responsibility to look after the Aboriginal people in the area of<br />
health because they have great problems there.<br />
PM: Well, I accept that absolutely of course I do. But I think, Pearson<br />
makes a point today, there has been substantial advances in<br />
Aboriginal health, but are the advances sufficient? No, I don't think<br />
they are, but the remedies are complex.<br />
JL: Yes, the remedies are complex, but they are necessary and I would<br />
think that they were necessary quickly in light of what we see. $ 54<br />
million being misspent it would appear, wouldn't it be better if<br />
Aboriginal health was cared for the way that the health of all<br />
Australians, and they are supposed to be Australians, is handled and<br />
that is by the one organisation?<br />
PM: Well, that is a matter for discussion for us and evaluation, but one<br />
thing is clear. Let's say we had the, if you like, standard health </p>
<p>arrangements in Aboriginal communities, for a start as you know, you<br />
often don't get the sort of medical officers, you won't get the medical<br />
service we get with general practitioners in these remote communities,<br />
that's for a start. You haven't got Aboriginal communities signed up for<br />
this sort of treatment, this is a complex social as well as professional<br />
problem.<br />
JL You see there are three medical services in the Northern Territory<br />
Aboriginal medical services that apparently are in danger of closing<br />
down, one of them is being supported by the white doctor who takes<br />
care of it, a fellow called Dr Scott Bell, he has used $ 3,500 of his own<br />
money to put petrol in the ambulance and the Alice Springs hospital<br />
won't give them anymore medical supplies because they owe $ 9,000,<br />
the Royal Flying Doctor can't land because of the state of disrepair of<br />
the strip, so it is being mismanaged isn't it? And it is tax payers<br />
money.<br />
PM: Well, put it this way, I don't know of those issues you raise, but it is<br />
very clear to all of us that we have not solved the problem of Aboriginal<br />
health in general and so whether particular programs are adequate or<br />
whether ATSIC is funding the petrol bill inappropriately for that<br />
particular medical centre I don't know, but what we do know is that we,<br />
all of us, have to do better that is the non-Aboriginal community, the<br />
Government and the Aboriginal community to see that we improve<br />
absolutely the health and welfare of Aboriginal people.<br />
JL Yes, it is tremendously important and as I say $ 54 million is a lot of<br />
money and if you want to cut down on wastage it would appear that it<br />
is being wasted when the poor Aboriginal people really are not<br />
improving as far as health is concerned.<br />
PM: John, I couldn't say to you, how could I say to you, that not a dollar of<br />
that is being wasted, some of it may be. But, the likelihood is that a lot<br />
of the problems in this area are primary problems. They are to do with<br />
water and they are to do with sanitation and they are to do with things<br />
that are not in the health budget at all.<br />
JL OK so if it is not being wasted, if it is not being severely wasted then<br />
does that mean it is not enough and more money should be given?<br />
PM: Well, it may be that in some of these infrastructure programs that more<br />
should be done and again that is something to be looked at. But,<br />
again, there is another layer of problems there, normally these are<br />
handled by the States. Normally water and sewerage, drainage and<br />
these things are handled by the States not the Commonwealth, so<br />
there has got to be the States signed up for this as well as the<br />
Commonwealth as well as the Aboriginal community as well as the<br />
Australian community in the broad. </p>
<p>JL: OK, as far as Aboriginal health is concerned, whether or not it should<br />
be run by the health department under Carmen Lawrence or whether it<br />
should be controlled by ATSIC what do you favour?<br />
PM: I said to you, this is a matter I think the Cabinet will have to take advice<br />
upon, but we will take advice, we will actually see what we are<br />
spending, how it is being spent, how we believe ATSIC is able to<br />
spend it. I mean, I don't think a lot of Aboriginal people would care<br />
particularly about whether it is exclusively ATSIC or the health<br />
department provided that there is a substantial influence from<br />
indigenous Australians about how their health care is provided. Now,<br />
you know, so therefore if that is their mood and it may be the mood of<br />
some and not others, but if that is the mood, then it is for the Cabinet to<br />
try and work out arrangements where the dual objectives of self<br />
determination so-called for Aboriginal people and adequate health<br />
protection and program delivery are met.<br />
JL: OK<br />
PM: In other words, it is like every other problem, John, it is complex and it<br />
needs to be gone through and we will go through it, but a lot of people<br />
are trying to discover Aboriginal health being a problem as though it<br />
wasn't a problem last year, the year before last, the year before that<br />
and the decade before that, and the decade before that.<br />
JL: Yes, but it seems it is not getting any better and that is a tragedy for<br />
the Aboriginal people and it is also a tragedy for Australia. I mean, we<br />
do have a responsibility.<br />
PM: I think it has got better, but not fast enough.<br />
JL: OK, another real concern of business is wage demands. I think it<br />
might have been the last time you and I talked you said that wages<br />
demands in the area of 14 or 15 per cent were affordable. I didn't pick<br />
you up on that, the world however did.<br />
PM: No, I didn't say that. I said it depends on what the productivity growth<br />
is. Let me just make this point John. Normally we have, productivity is<br />
the amount of extra output that comes from efficiency in the labour<br />
market and obviously if you have got high productivity you can pay<br />
higher wages. What I was saying to you then when you asked me<br />
about the 15 per cent..<br />
JL: Yes.<br />
PM: I was saying that is fine depending on the number of years it is over. If<br />
it is two years it is 6 to 7.5 per cent that is not fine.<br />
JL: What is affordable now? </p>
<p>PM: If it is three years that makes a hell of a difference because let me just,<br />
again, repeat this is another key good news point, the reason that 2<br />
per cent inflation rate is sitting there 2 to 2.5 per cent is because of<br />
the high productivity growth of the last year. In the last year we had<br />
productivity growth of 4 per cent. You know what our long term<br />
average is? About 1.6 per cent, about 1.5 or 1.6, that is the 60s,<br />
about 1.5 or 1.6. This year we have done 4 per cent. This means<br />
that the cost of employment to firms has been falling even though real<br />
wages for employees have been rising. So, there has been an<br />
increase in wages for people, but it hasn't had the normal effect on<br />
profits and inflation because of this presence of high productivity. This<br />
is the point the Treasurer and I have been making. When can you<br />
remember a year that had 6 per cent growth in production, 2 per cent<br />
inflation, 3 and 3/ 4 per cent employment growth and 4 per cent<br />
productivity growth. I mean, not in any post-War year was this the<br />
case and this is why it is so wrong to have this impression put about<br />
that we have got sort of economic troubles or some sort of economic<br />
malaise when we have just completed the best economic year since<br />
the war.<br />
JL Yes, all that is true, but again, let me say..<br />
PM: I'm afraid it is true.<br />
JL: Yes, don't be afraid, I mean..<br />
PM: How dare I daily with the truth.<br />
JL: Yes..<br />
PM: Isn't it shocking that I should even mention it.<br />
JL: But, the people out there are still going to have difficulties<br />
understanding why if everything is rosy as you say it is, which it is in<br />
the garden, why is it not affecting them in a favourable way instead of<br />
an unfavourable way? Why have I got business men ringing up and<br />
saying I am terrified to employ people because of their stupid industrial<br />
relations law because if I have to fire somebody they will be off to the<br />
court and I'll be in for a fist full of dollars to recompense them because<br />
I had the temerity to dismiss them because they were incompetent.<br />
PM: John, you will always have somebody say this, but look at the overall<br />
outcome. How can you have an industrial relations system which is<br />
failing yet is still producing an employment rate of 2 to 2.5 per cent. I<br />
mean, the two just cannot sit in harmony together. The fact is the<br />
industrial relation system is working better than at any time in our<br />
history. It is more flexible, more productivity related than any time<br />
ever. </p>
<p>JL: Do you know how many claims there are for unfair dismissals since<br />
that was introduced by Laurie Brereton?<br />
PM: No, I don't.<br />
JL: 5,862.<br />
PM: Well, there is eight million in the work force remember.<br />
JL: That's right, but it grows at the rate of 140 a week. 140 people taking<br />
their ex-employer to court and he has got to foot the bill and he has to<br />
prove that he is innocent. He is guilty until he proves himself innocent.<br />
Now, if it is growing at the rate of 140 a week what is that costing the<br />
nation?<br />
PM: Well, go to the overall policy as you have to in anything in this<br />
business and what the overall policy is delivering is more flexibility in<br />
the labour market, a better capacity for employees to be suited to jobs,<br />
to multiskilling, the award restructuring, the enterprise bargains. We<br />
have now got enterprise bargains in 55 per cent of the federal award<br />
area under enterprise bargains which we never had two or three years<br />
ago and that is why there is 4 per cent productivity growth and that is<br />
why we have got low inflation. Can I just say this, John, that people<br />
say, you asked me the question legitimately ' well, what does all this<br />
mean to people?' Well, let me just give you what I think is a really<br />
riveting statistic the combination of employment growth and increases<br />
in real wages since 1983 has meant that real household, real that's<br />
after inflation, real household disposable incomes have been growing<br />
impressively by 40 per cent since 1983, so the real income of<br />
Australian households is 40 per cent greater than when John Howard<br />
left as Treasurer. Now, that is through low inflation, strong<br />
employment and decent wages growth and I might say John Howard<br />
opposed every wage increase since 1983 every single one. And, if<br />
we had taken his advice you wouldn't have that strong growth. So, that<br />
is what it means. That's what good policy means. That's what high<br />
productivity, low inflation, strong employment growth because there<br />
are more people in households in work.<br />
JL: Listen, it is very interesting to note, I've just been out of interest taking<br />
a note, I haven't asked you one question directly about John Howard,<br />
but you have brought him up 10 times. Is he becoming a thorn in the<br />
side?<br />
PM: No, I brought him up because every radio interview he will do will be<br />
full of negative stuff about the Government and about me and when I<br />
get on, I mean, the last interview I did on 2UE was not with you but<br />
John Stanley, it was all about productivity, it was about dealing with the<br />
inflation rate, it was about how we maintained the growth et cetera, I'm </p>
<p>the one that always focuses on, I think, gives the answers, I mean I<br />
give facts not argument and what I get is always these transcripts full<br />
of abuse. So, when I have the opportunity, I just want to make this<br />
very clear, when John Howard has the front page story in the Sydney<br />
Morning Herald which is those journalists not having the principle of<br />
the person on the Sunday Age and saying ' if you don't give me the<br />
information or let me attribute it to you I won't publish it' when he does<br />
that and when Ross Gittins says that Howard is sabotaging the<br />
expenditure cuts that is an important public point to make. Here we<br />
are about to put together a budget which is going to be central to<br />
maintaining growth and employment and what is the new Opposition's<br />
policy? He believes in expenditure cuts, but the moment the<br />
Government thinks about it, he'll run around trying to bag the<br />
Government and scare the wits out of every recipient, pensioner,<br />
elderly person, sickness beneficiary or what have you.<br />
JL: Isn't it true that it wouldn't matter what Government was in power, that<br />
spending cuts would have to be introduced? I mean, if John Howard<br />
suddenly became Prime Minister tomorrow, it wouldn't make any<br />
difference to the fact that spending cuts have to be made don't they?<br />
PM: In this Budget, they will have to be made, but it is a matter of how you<br />
make them compassionately, sensitively, creatively or whether you<br />
just go for people. At the last election the Liberal's said they were<br />
going to kick people on unemployment benefits off after nine months. I<br />
mean, what do you do to somebody who is unemployed through no<br />
fault of their own, that has got a family, say after nine months ' there is<br />
no income for you'. It is down to the St Vincent de Paul or the<br />
Brotherhood of St Lawrence and if you can't basically feed and clothe<br />
yourself there it is too bad. I mean that was their policy and then under<br />
pressure in the election, as the election came on they had to abandon<br />
it. I mean, could you imagine this Government adopting anything like<br />
that?<br />
JL: No.<br />
PM: That's why I say it is all about compassion and creativity and sense.<br />
JL: Of course, there are many people, me included, who question why if<br />
the plans as utilised by not just this government, but governments<br />
before, whether they be of the Liberal persuasion or a Labor<br />
persuasion is immaterial, but if those plans are working and if welfare<br />
as such is beneficial to this country or any country why does the<br />
welfare bill keep increasing, why does the number of unemployed with<br />
the exception of this country in the last little while keep increasing, why<br />
does the number of homeless people keep increasing and why does<br />
the number of illegitimate births keep increasing if the policies are<br />
working? </p>
<p>PM: Well, the Government can't regulate family values or change the norms<br />
or mores in society. I mean, it can do its best to cope with them, it can<br />
design policies to deal with them, but in the end, I mean the resort to<br />
divorce or to single parents, these sorts of issues are issues which go<br />
to the society as a whole.<br />
JL: Why do you think, and we will have to be very quick I just looked at the<br />
clock, why do you think we have an illegitimacy rate of about 24 per<br />
cent in Australia almost a quarter of the children are born out of<br />
wedlock?<br />
PM: Well, I don't know the answer to that.<br />
JL: You don't think the fact that it is made easy for people to be able to<br />
support these children when they are brought into the world<br />
contributes to it?<br />
PM: Well, if you ask about people having children illegitimately because<br />
there is support for children in the social security system I think the<br />
answer to that is no.<br />
JL: But you don't think if there wasn't they would avoid having children?<br />
PM: But, I mean, what is the principle? The principle when I had the<br />
pleasure of introducing the Family Allowance Supplement for low<br />
income families in the 1 980s or any of these changes, the principle is<br />
you support the child. I mean, remember this John, we have still got a<br />
budget sector just about as small as any in the world. We are doing all<br />
of this with the spending level overall just about as small as any in the<br />
world. Are we that callous when in the face of high profits and the<br />
good times, I mean there has never been more Porches and Mecedes<br />
Benz's and everything sold out there than this last 12 months, are we<br />
saying that we can't afford to support a child regardless of its<br />
circumstance?<br />
JL: No, it must be catching, now you are making simple statements. I<br />
didn't say that.<br />
PM: I'm dealing with the simple implication behind the question. I mean,<br />
this is where I make very clear, I mean, it's another point I make about<br />
the Liberals, they are always saying support families..<br />
JL: We've got about 60 seconds, Prime Minister.<br />
PM: They say we are for families, I mean as if the rest of us, I mean the<br />
arrogance of that statement is as if the rest of us are not, apparently<br />
they think we are martians, we came from somewhere else but a<br />
family, but they don't support family support. They are for families, but<br />
they are not for family support. </p>
<p>JL: Yes, well, one would hope that everybody would support families<br />
support. I suppose it depends again on how you define the family.<br />
PM: Look, as you and I know families are now complex. People opt out of<br />
marriages, there is a lot of single parents about and it is very hard to<br />
say, any of us to say, why this trend is there, it is the same in Britain, it<br />
is the same in the United States, it is the same in many developed<br />
countries that we have got to try and make government policy respond<br />
in a compassionate and humane way, but on a basis that the nation<br />
can afford. I submit we have done that.<br />
JL: OK, Prime Minister, thank you very much for your time, you have been<br />
very generous.<br />
PM: Thank you, John. It is your first day in Canberra broadcasting into the<br />
ACT I believe.<br />
JL: Yes, so now they won't have to run around with<br />
PM: Well, now the Gallery won't have to eavesdrop. That will make them<br />
terribly happy.<br />
JL: I look forward to talking to you soon.<br />
PM: Good luck. Good bye.<br />
JL: Good bye.<br />
