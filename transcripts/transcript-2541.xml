C . JJ AUSTRALIA<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
OLYIIC APPEAL FUIOD<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, Mr. William McMahon, C. H. , M. P.<br />
21 February, 1972<br />
Good Evening;<br />
Nineteen hundred and seventy-two is another<br />
Olympic Games Year and the Australian Olympic Federation, of<br />
which I happen to be the President, wants to send about 200 of<br />
our top athletes to iZunich, Germany, to compete in the Games.<br />
Now you know as well as I do that the Australian<br />
is a great sportsman, and that he can compete and win in world<br />
company. So we plan to be able to announce the team in May of<br />
this year and to get them to Munich as soon as we can so that they<br />
can compete in the Games in late August and early September.<br />
In order to do that we have to raise something<br />
like $ 400,000 to permit the mission to take place. My Government,<br />
the Australian Government, has provided $ 80,000 to permit this to<br />
happen and we have to collect the balance from people like you,<br />
from companies and corporations, from associations and from the<br />
trade unions as well.<br />
We have to do this if the mission is to be<br />
successful. So I ask you tonight to contribute to the maximum<br />
of your capacity, and to make this trip a success.<br />
Please do so, and give our athletes the opportunity<br />
to compete and to beat the best from other parts of the world.<br />
Good ni-ht and thank you. </p>
