S* * 1 J<br />
PRIM] E MINISTER'S QUEENISLAhD BROADCAST NO, 18<br />
THE SENATE INQUISITION<br />
JULY 1975*<br />
THIS WE-EK WE HAVE SEEN YET ANOTHER EXAMPLE<br />
OF THE OPPOSITION'S CONTEMPT FOR PARLIAMENTARY PRINCIPLES<br />
AND ESTABLISHED POLITICAL CONVENTIONS ONE HAS TO KEEP<br />
RETURNING TO THIS THEME BECAUSE THESE PRINCIPLES, THESE<br />
rCONVENTIONS AREN'T JUST DRY LEGAL FORMALITIES--THEY ARE<br />
THE BASIC RULES OF THE POLITICAL GAME&gt; EVER SINCE WE CAME<br />
TO OFFICE THE OPPOSITION HAS BEEN BREAKING THESE RULES<br />
S WHENEVER IT SUITS THEN, THEY HAVE REJECTED LEGISLATION<br />
IN THE SENATE FOR WHICH THE PEOPLE HAVE VOTED; THEY'VE<br />
REFUSED SUPPLY TO T-E ELECTED GOVERNMENT; THEY'VE<br />
REFUSED TO FOLLOW THE CONVENTION ABOUT FILLING CASUAL.<br />
VACANCIES IN THE SENATEA IT'S ALL PART OF THE SAME<br />
WRETCHED PATTERN-LAST WEEKEND THE PEOPLE OF SOUTH<br />
AUSTRALIA SHOWED ',-HAT THEY THOUGHT OF AN UPPER HOUSE<br />
OBSTRUCTING POPULAR LEGISLATION WHEN THEY RETURNED DON<br />
DU DUNSTAN'S GOVERNMENT FOR ANOTHER TERMA BUT THIS WEEK THE<br />
OPPOSITION IN CANBERRA HAVE BEEN AT IT AGAIN, THEY HAVE<br />
DRAGGED PUBLIC SERVANTS THROUGH A POLITICAL INQUISITION<br />
IN THE SENATE-AND NOW THEY'RE THREATENING TO DO THE SAME<br />
WITH PRIVATE CITIZENS/ THEY HAVE UNDERMINED THE TRADITIONAL<br />
NEUTRALITY AND INTEGRITY OF THE PUBLIC SERVICE THEY HAVE<br />
IGNORED THE PRINCIPLE THAT MINISTERS ALONE, MINISTERS<br />
ELECTED BY THE PEOPLE, ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACTIONS OF<br />
A GOVERNMENT. </p>
<p>YOU SHOULD NOT BE FOOLED BY THE OPPOSITIOIN LINE<br />
THAT WHAT WAS AT STAKE THIS WEEK WAS THE SUPREMACY OF<br />
PARLIAMENT OVER THE BUREAUCRACYv THE SUPREMACY OF<br />
PARLIAMENT IS PRECISELY WHAT MY GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN<br />
DEFENDINGMC LET'S GO BACK TO THE BEGINNING AND SEE HOW<br />
THIS DEPLORABLE BUSINESS BEGAN, AFTER THE PARLIAMENT<br />
ROSE FOR ITS WINTER RECESS THE OPPOSITION AND THE PRESS<br />
BEGAN MAKING WILD ACCUSATIONS AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT OVER<br />
CERTAIN OVERSEAS LOAN NEGOTIATIONs, LEAKED DOCUMENTS,<br />
FABRICATED DOCUMENTS, DOCUMENTS FOR WHICH NEWSPAPERS HAD<br />
PAID MANY THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS BEGAN APPEARING IN THE PRESS<br />
AMID A GREAT CHORUS OF ALLEGATIONS AND UNSUBSTANTIATED<br />
CHARGES AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT AND PARTICULAR MINISTERS<br />
I DECIDED THAT PARLIAMENT WAS THE PROPER PLACE FOR THESE<br />
CHARGES TO BE MADE AND DEBATEDY So I RECALLED THE PARLIAMENT<br />
FOR A SPECIAL SITTING, ' MIND YOU, WE HAD ALREADY GIVEN<br />
THE PARLIAMENT MOST OF. THE INFORMATION ABOUT THE NATURE<br />
AND PURPOSES OF OUR LOAN NEGOTIATIONS . BUT I DECIDED THAT<br />
THE. OPPOSITION SHOULD HAVE THE FULLEST OPPORTUNITY<br />
TO QUESTION THE GOVERNMENT, DEBATE THE ISSUE FURTHER AND<br />
tA. KE ANY CHARGES THEY WISHEDX DURI-NG THAT SPECIAL SITTING<br />
THE GOVERNMENT AVAILABLE SCORES OF DOCUMENTS AND PAPERS<br />
RELATING TO THE LOANS ISSUE, WE HAVE ANSWERED NEARLY EVERY<br />
QUESTION THAT OPPOSITION MEMBERS HAVE PUT TO ' US IN THE<br />
PARLIAMENT AND EVERY QUESTION WILL: BE ANSWERED THROUGH THE<br />
NORMAL PARLIAMENTARY PROCEDURES DURING THE SPECIAL SITTING<br />
OF THE HOUSE THE OPPOSITION FAILED TO SUBSTANTIATE ANY<br />
SPECIFIC CHARGE OF ILLEGALITY OF IMPROPRIETY AGAINST THE<br />
GOVERNMENT OR ANY MINISTERA No SPECIFIC CHARGE WAS<br />
SUBSTANTIATED; NO SPECIFIC CHARGE WAS EVEN MADE. ./ 3 </p>
<p>3,<br />
IF THE OPPOSITION REALLY WANTED TO PURSUE THIS<br />
MATTER IT -AD EVERY RIGHT TO DO SO THROUGH THE NORMAL<br />
PROCESSES CF PARLIAMENT: THOSE PROCESSES WERE BY NO MEANS<br />
. EXHAUSTED THEY CAN NEVER BE EXHAUSTED INSTEAD THEY<br />
DECIDED TO SUBJECT SENIOR AND RESPECTED PUBLIC SERVANTS<br />
TO AN UNNECESSARY AND HUMILIATING INQUISITIONy THEY<br />
TRIED TO TURN THE SENATE INTO A STAR CHAMBER, IT WAS A PURE<br />
POLITICAL STUNT, AND WE WEREN'T GOING TO HAVE A BAR OF THOSE<br />
TACTICSy , iE EREN'T GOING TO ALLOW PUBLIC SERVANTS TO<br />
BE DRAGGED B-FORE THE SENATE AND INTERROGATED ON MATTERS<br />
FOR WHICH THEY ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE AND CANNOT BE<br />
RESPONSIBLE IINISTERS ALONE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE<br />
GOVERNMENT'S ACTIONS, MINISTERS ALONE ARE ANSWERABLE<br />
TO THE PARLIA'ENTO So Tr: S S STHE SITUATION: THE.' SENATE HAS SAT<br />
FOR THREE DA" YS NCW, AND THE OPPOSITION HAS FAILED TO<br />
TURN UP A SI'-LE NEW FACT OR MAKE A SINGLE SPECIFIC<br />
ALLEGATION CN T-IS MATTER DESPITE ALL THE OPPORTUNITIES<br />
GIVEN TO THE&amp;. V : ET THEY GO ON WASTING THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS<br />
A DAY IN PUBL. C KEEPING THE SENATE IN SESSION THEY<br />
HAVE BROUGHT PUBLIC SERVANT HALFWAY ROUND THE WORLD<br />
FOR THIS RIDIC'JLOUS PIECE OF GRANDSTANDING THEY HAVE<br />
WASTED THE TI: E OF SENIOR PUBLIC SERVANTS AND MINISTERSA<br />
THEY HAVE ALREADY DELAYED THE GOVERNMENT'S WORK ON THE<br />
BUDGET) AND ALL FOR NOTHING' ALL FOR A FUTILE, CYNICAL<br />
EXERCISE IN WITCHHUNTING AND INTIMIDATIONX ALL FOR A<br />
FISHING EXPEDITION TO HELP THE OPPOSITION'S POLITICAL<br />
PURPOSES, IT IS AN UTTER ABUSE OF PARLIAMENTARY PRACTICE, </p>
<p>I HAVE ALREADY QUOTED WHAT SIR ROBERT I'IENZIES<br />
SAID ABOUT EXPOSING SENIOR PUBLIC SERVANTS TO A PARLIAMENTARY<br />
INQUISITION i5ERE ARE SOME OTHER WORDS OF SIR ROBERT<br />
MENZIES ON THIS QUESTION:<br />
" CIVIL SERVANTS OUGHT NOT TO BE DRAGGED INTO<br />
PARLIAMENTARY DEBATE... IT WOULD BE DEPLORABLE<br />
TO HAVE THEIR NAMES AND VIEWS BANDIED ABOUT IN<br />
PARLIAMENT, THUS INVOLVING THE CIVIL SERVANT MUCH<br />
AGAINST HIS WILL IN PARTY POLITICAL CONTROVERSY,"<br />
THOSE WERE SIR ROBERT MENZIES' VIEWS AND SIR<br />
ROBERT IS NOT THE ONLY LIBERAL POLITICIAN WHO HAS SUPPORTED<br />
OUR STAND IN THIS MATTER&gt; ALL GOVERNMENTS HAVE TAKEN THE VIEW 3<br />
THAT PUBLIC SERVANITS AND THE GOVERNMENT'S LAW OFFICERS CANNOT<br />
REVEAL DETAILS OR BE QUESTIONED ON CONFIDENTIAL GOVERNMENT<br />
DISCUSSIONS THAT OPINION WAS SUPPORTED IN A PARLIAMENTARY<br />
PAPER PREPARED IN 1958 BY SENATOR GREENWOOD, THE FORMER<br />
LIBERAL ATTORNEY-: : ERAL, AND BY MiR ELLICOTT, THE FORMER<br />
SOLICITOR-GENERAL D N: OW A LEADING SPOKESMAN FOR THE OPPOSITIONFOR<br />
THE LIBERALS ? ERFECTLY WELL THAT ANY GOVERNMENT<br />
LABOR OR LIBERAL -S TO DEAL CONSTANTLY WITH ' PUBLIC<br />
SERVANTS ON EVERY : ATTER, AND IF PUBLIC SERVANTS BREACH THE<br />
PRINCIPLES OF CC'. ODENTIALITY THE WHOLE SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT<br />
BECOMES UNWORKA3' BLE AND GOVERNMENTS ARE FORMED IN THE<br />
HOUSE OF REPRESE: NTATIVES-YOU WON'T FIND THESE STAR CHAMBER<br />
TACTICS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES BECAUSE GOVERNMENTS<br />
THERE ALWAYS HAVE . A MAJORITY THIS IS A TECHNIQUE THAT CAN<br />
ONLY BE USED TO EMBARRASS A GOVERNMENT THAT LACKS A MAJORITY<br />
IN THE SENATE.-IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH FACT-FINDINGCIT<br />
IS A PURE POLITICAL EXERCISE. </p>
<p>VE KVE TO RENEMB ER THAT PARLIAMENTARY INQUISITIONS<br />
OF THE KiND THE OPPOSITION IS SEEKING OR EVEN<br />
ROYAL COMMiSSIOIS FOR THAT MATTER, HOWEVER RESPECTABLE<br />
THEY SOUND ARE QUITE FOREIGN TO THE FORMS AND<br />
PROCEDURES ESTABLISHED OVER MANY CENTURIES TO APPLY<br />
THE LAW OF THE LAND' IT'S TRUE THAT PARLIAMENT HAS CERTAIN<br />
POWERS IN DEFENCE OF ITS OWN PRI\ VILEGES, BUT THAT'S A<br />
DIFFERENT MATTER; AND IN ANY CASE, THE PRIVILEGES OF<br />
PARLIAMENT ARE FOR BOTH HOUSES TO DETERMINE, NOT JUST<br />
THE SENATP GATHER THAT WHAT THE OPPOSITION IS<br />
-A<br />
DESPERATELY S* EEING IN THIS CASE IS SOME EVIDENCE OF<br />
Q CRIME OR MALPRACTICEA BUT IFA PERSON IS ACCUSED OF<br />
A CRIME HE IS ENTITLED TO HAVE PROPER NOTICE OF THE<br />
CHARGE AGAINST HIM, TO BE TRIED BY A COURT WHICH CAN<br />
APPLY THE RULS COF EVIDENCE AND, IF HE'S GUILTY,<br />
IMPOSE SOME SIMILARLY, IF A PERSON HAS BROKEN<br />
SOIME CIVIL LK. IS ENTITLED TO THE SAME RIGHTS AND<br />
PRIVILEGES: KS &gt; GSE MAY BE HEARD BEFORE A JUDGE AND THE<br />
FACTS DETEP SE-Y A JURYN THE SENATE OR A ROYAL<br />
COIiSSIN CAN . iNE OF THESE THINGSv A ROYAL COMMISSION<br />
HAS NO POWER TO 2 VE VE~ RICTS OR MAKE JUDGENTSj IT<br />
CAN'T FIND PE2? LE GUILTY OR NOT GUILTY( IT CAN'T AWARD<br />
DAMAGES -OR -I P* 3SE SE&gt; NTENCESI ITS FINDINGS HAVE NO<br />
FORCE IN LAW 19ATEVER, AS FOR THE SENATE<br />
IT'S BOUND BY : O RULES AT ALL, NO RULES OF EVIDENCEI<br />
NO RULES OF PROCEDURE2 IT CAN DO WHATEVER IT LIKES,<br />
WHATEVER A MAJORITY OF PARTY POLITICIANS DECIDE, IMAGINE IT<br />
TRIAL BY POLITICIANS, TRIAL BY LIBERAL AND COUNTRY PARTY SENATORS. </p>
<p>6,<br />
' IE S; ULD BE DEEPLY ALARMED WHEN PUBLIC SERVANTS<br />
OR PRIVATE CITIZENS CAN BE HAULED BEFORE A POLITICALLY<br />
MOTIVATED CHAMBER TO SERVE THE INTERESTS OF A POLITICAL<br />
PARTYv THIS IS A VERY SINISTER AND DANGEROUS ABUSE<br />
f<br />
OF PARLIAMENT'S POWERS. ONCE WE START SUMMONING PRIVATE<br />
CITIZENS FOR POLITICAL ENDS WHERE IS IT GOING TO STOP?<br />
WHO WILL BE SAFE FROM POLITICAL INTERROGATION? THE<br />
SENATE HAS S T A DIRE AND PERHAPS DISASTROUS PRECEDENT<br />
IN ITS ACTIONS THIS WEEK" PARLIAMENT HAS ITS ROLE TO<br />
PLAY IN OUR :, MOCRACY THE PUBLIC SERVICE HAS ITS<br />
ROLE;: THE COURTS HAVE THEIR ROLE. THOSE ROLES<br />
ARE SEPARATE D DISTINCT I'E MUST NOT ALLOW AN<br />
ANTI-GOVERN. N T MAJORITY IN ONE HOUSE OF PARLIAMENT<br />
TO DESTROY T:-E INTEGRITY OF THE PUBLIC SERVICE OR<br />
BYPASS OR THE FUNCTIONS OF THE COURTS<br />
