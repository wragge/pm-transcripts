H-ayden row, thle Ivranium dciision by the ALI"<br />
rc-deiai Conference-yesterday, and thtj economy<br />
with prospects as gloomy as they have beer,<br />
. in a long vh~ ile, both for b-. usiness anti for<br />
labour wvith untimployment lik~ ely to rise. Let.' s<br />
look at all those questions and pertiaps a feu<br />

Thanks for joining vs.<br />
Good raorning.<br />
ChRLTOfl.; PM: CARLTON: Primre Minister, I would lith. to go through a~<br />
w~ hole lot. + of questions wvith you brut. I cannot<br />
resist starting with the obvious, Have you<br />
anything to Eay on the Iaydc-n/ Hawke issue?<br />
H~ o except. thtYL I think it is probably Irrelevant.<br />
H~ OW do you ILEan?<br />
V~ ell I do not think i t. ma'tters,<br />
CARL'tON: It does not trattc-r Nvbo lead,$ the Labor Party,<br />
you can still beat. them?<br />
Yes.<br />
CARL'ON: Pit: CARLTON: CARL'rON: Is there a certain delicious irony in watching<br />
Mr. Jlauke do to It. r. Bayden wbat. Andrew Peacock<br />
tried to do to you?<br />
Oh I do 4ot thinU so because, you itnow, frc'w<br />
the m~ oment Mr. flauke came into the Parliament<br />
he wvas bound to try and tmake a grab and it was<br />
only a question of seeing \, hen it would be.<br />
14m. And it has core sooner perhaps, rather<br />
than later?<br />
Oh I think from him~ he m~ aybe have exhibited a<br />
fair aiwunt. of patience already.<br />
( LAUGHS) Allx-ight. They think apparently, or<br />
M~ r. Hawke's thinking, is that he can lead<br />
. Labor to victory against-you but t-hat far, Bayder<br />
cannot. Do you see it that way?<br />
Itell -I do not really want to ccomment on it all<br />
that muQch. I do not know that. it. would inake<br />
m~ uch dg.&amp; ference and that is vhy I think it is<br />
irrelevant. If you have read the FINAN~ CIAL<br />
REVIEW this m~ raing I think that if M~ r. H1awke<br />
did becomie Leader you would start. Lo find more<br />
articles, like the one on that being written. 14, N<br />

CA1IL'fN: IN 1( ht -the cult of personality, that sort of<br />
t h irng?<br />
) NO) no, there Xuas just. an artcle, pretty<br />
Solidly written, that % wa. quiestio~ ning % zhether<br />
Ucr. Hauke vas Primwt M~ inisterial1 material and<br />
auggesting very strungly that he vas -not. 1kAu<br />
I think That w~ st people in the media have in<br />
one sense left him alone because, you knowo<br />
he has not been in that position. lie has just<br />
been a private Itember of Par Ii amtent<br />
CAflLTOU: CARLTO: IN CacLTON CAR~ LTON: But I really do not think it inatters, all. that<br />
much, I really do not.<br />
Allright chariszatic perhaps but not Prime<br />
Ministerial material. Would you agree with thal<br />
Viell charisrmtic does not always-trake good<br />
PrImre M~ inisterial material. but that is not<br />
necessarily a conrmnt on M~ r. 1iavke.<br />
Yes. I think Mr. Hayden might. agree with you<br />
on That lot. ( LAUGHS)<br />
Oh there are some things I do agree with M~ r.<br />
Hayden about. You rlght be surprised.<br />
And do -ou share a similar opinion of Ur. Hawke" l<br />
Pit: CARLTON:. PH: CARLTOX.: PH: CARLTO4 PHi: I have not spoken to him about it in depth.<br />
I do not think you would know wrhat I thought -of<br />
Yes, allright. We will leave it there if you<br />
like. I would like to get dowa to one of the<br />
issues discussed yesterday at that Labor.<br />
Conference -their apparent softening of-the<br />
Labor line on uranium. How do you see that?.<br />
Well do you think it is a softening of a line<br />
to promise aomebody that you are not going<br />
strangle him quickly, you are only going' to<br />
strangle him slovly?<br />
Which would you prefer?<br />
Yeah, I &amp; ee whiat you mean but the Left Ving is<br />
saying that 11we were sold out, that vwe cannot<br />
cut the uranium Industry off immeiately it vie<br />
get to Goveraceat". It does seem to be a<br />
softening to that extent, doesn't it?<br />
Welrl'if you regard that as a sof tening would yov<br />
like me to read you a cuple of words from the<br />
Resolution? J-<br />

<p>Page<br />
CA1L'rON: Pbl: CARLTON: PM: CARLTON: PH C A RLT UN<br />
2q pM: CARLTON: Yes Sure.<br />
An ALP Government would give a total co=-itmen<br />
to preventing sty nevi mines being developed and,<br />
also another bit " our ni ium position vould b<br />
total, unequivocal cozoitment to phaI~ e outI<br />
Australia's Involvemeat in the uranium iadustrY<br />
So the only difference is, you know, one was<br />
chopping it off, pushing sozebody off the gang-l<br />
plank, the present policy Is phasing It out.<br />
Nocw nobody knaws how, under uhat circumstances]<br />
over vihat periosd the phase out process voild I<br />
take. But that is,. you know, that. Is the only<br />
significant difference.<br />
Mm So it uould still be# In your view, a.<br />
Labor Governmrent would still be the death kzel<br />
for the uraniua industry in this: country?<br />
The Resolution says. very plainly that that is<br />
what it is,<br />
No new mines, phasing out all existing involved<br />
In the industry. That is, you knowx, those w. or 41<br />
are very clear I think.<br />
Allright. 1iou i= portant do you see that a's an<br />
electioh issue? Is it one that you would be<br />
anxious to pursue in the next F'ederal election<br />
whenever that is?<br />
Well.. a good part of it goes to tbe credibility<br />
of Australia as a trading partner, as a place<br />
In which to Invest. People have put their<br />
dollars out to develop uranium mines in good<br />
faith. Ice are moving into a very harsh,-.<br />
competitive world where there Is a very real<br />
recession in countries overseas and there are<br />
cany much, much worse that Australia and, in<br />
those circucmstances, we want Australia to be.<br />
an attractive place, you knou, for people to.<br />
inveat In and the kind of behaviour that would i<br />
be required under this Resolution on uranium,<br />
* you know; investors would look on that in a<br />
pretty uncomplizentary way and they would say<br />
to themselves " well If Australia is prepared<br />
to do that In relation to uranium is it<br />
prepxred to act In that way In relation to,<br />
other investgmentst other activities".<br />
so you are saying It increfses the uncertainty<br />
of what a Labor Government would der with<br />
foreign investoent generally? .4 </p>
<p>CARLTWN PM4: CARLTON PM: Yes I thinh it vizeuld. Arid at P. time uhert<br />
the world mas v'ery ccupetitive alid very<br />
dittilt and e-speci:: tlly at a timce xwhen Y; WE<br />
have done a nuvlber ot things to' 6amage<br />
0,. jrselves % te cannot asfford thrit sort ot<br />
pol icy., V, ) hzixe got to be hi reliable.<br />
trading pa-rtn-r. We have got to deliver -on<br />
tire. Ife bave got to get rid of the disputes<br />
and stri) kes and the holdups in shipping<br />
tbrough our ports and fe-establish a name tor<br />
reliability. Yes, allright. Let's mo~ ve on then troin that.<br />
I think you have =-die your vic-vs pretty elevr<br />
on tbait.. The ecoDCTjy itzef-all the signs<br />
at the wmnent are looking very bad are't, they'.<br />
Well the overaeas recetasion is really stai-tin:,<br />
to hit Australia hard. Somie of-the mining<br />
companies are in very g; reat difficulty. -The<br />
pa., use in the price of' oil over th--last yettr<br />
or two has mrade coal~ coriver-sion less<br />
attractive and they have slo~ te'd that dun-<br />
That vould not have maele much difference<br />
because, especially in aconme poxts, xre ran<br />
into bottlenec1, s Yvith the export of coal and<br />
the port facilities have not been adequately<br />
developcI. Inlernal transpc. rt facilities<br />
have not V~ een adequately developed &amp; nd, ycu<br />
lbnowl it would be very easy to sit doun and<br />
blaw people for this that " ut-ld be<br />
responsible for these things but I bave tak~ en<br />
the attitude thtat -it is too ii~ pcortant.. for-<br />
Australia and I have told 1,1r. Itran and<br />
Queensland also that it is not a question 0f<br />
blaming people~ for \, vhat. has happened,-it i s<br />
a question of doing uhat ue can together to<br />
overcome the pro~ blem,~ 10 re-establish<br />
Australia's reliability at the earliest point<br />
Yes. You arce saying are bAically at<br />
the mnerey, though, 1 suppose the Azvricart<br />
economy and the general wiorld downturn.<br />
WVell# in those things, -Ies. but ' ue have<br />
contracted to deliver tonna. cs of coal. We<br />
could not deliver because of industrial<br />
disputes,, because of inadequate facilities.<br />
Let ume, give you an exam-ple: wthen I was in<br />
Korea a few wreeks ago I visited a large mcoder:<br />
n" w steel mill making 9 raillion tonnes of<br />
steel a year. The same Company is going to<br />
build a new-steel mill-producing a little moro<br />
The first mill is based on Australian coal ani<br />
Australian iron ore but. the second xwi1l-not<br />
be-unless-w" can-re-establi-sh reliability YL.<br />
knowt out of Australian ports, for coal and<br />
iromi. ore. -l </p>
<p>Page<br />
C A RLT ON Which you do not nee happ'ening in New SouthI<br />
Well I hope it will. We are working now with<br />
the N~ ew South Vales Goverrajent. and I hope very<br />
rsuch that tbe industrial disputes hich hav. e<br />
done so much to Oa~. age exports, through<br />
N~ ewcastle in particular, are tAargely cover and<br />
that can get back to delivering coal and<br />
filling orders in a proper % ay. I do n~ ot*<br />
think can entirely overcome the problem<br />
until an addition~ al coal loader is In<br />
operation.<br />
CARLTON: PH: But, you kcnow, this Is sor-etbing that affects<br />
Australia's general trading reputation,<br />
CARLTON, Yes.<br />
P'i 4 At a timre when the world : Is tough, % when %% e<br />
are affected by American recession and Interest<br />
rates and lo", or bad, world trading<br />
conditions. Wle just c. annot afford any other<br />
upsets, &amp; ny other, you kinow, problem-s.<br />
CARLTON: Ift. Aliright but Prime Minrister that is still<br />
only one corner of the coony isn't it? Here<br />
at hoze we have these high inltereSt Tates,<br />
wre have un~ ertployment likely to rise don't N~ e?<br />
PR: Coal is only one corner of the e~ conomy certainly<br />
but the American recession and low world trade<br />
is affecting the whole econozzy.<br />
CARLTON: Yes.<br />
PM: N~ ow it Is starting to hit the economuy pretty<br />
hard.<br />
CARLTFON: Yes. Do you believe u. teployment is going to<br />
rise again? In fact, th~ e new figures are out<br />
today I believe.<br />
PM: Well I do not know what any f igures are that<br />
might have been or m~ ight be coming out today<br />
but in the trading conditions that we are<br />
facing I think it is going to be itpossible<br />
to prevent a rise in ure.-ployment. I believe<br />
that was accepted at the tripartite conference<br />
yesterday which I think was a very successful<br />
confereace. For the first tire unions,<br />
industry leaders and governments sat down.<br />
togetber and, you know in terms of what is<br />
happeniag in the e-conczy there-As not total<br />
but a significant. measure of agreemient.<br />
CARLTON: Yes. </p>
<p>I'm CARLTON: PM: CAR~ LTON:<br />
PU: CARLTrON: PMJ: Page 6<br />
1 think the three parties have a co! 7, oa<br />
V'iew that there are sioe very rcal<br />
problemis iihead of Australia and that ' ue<br />
all ought to work togeth-: r to do iubat we<br />
can to overcome those prcsblemns and to<br />
ininimise the . i-pact of overseas recession<br />
on Australia,<br />
Yes. Those problemis are going to be<br />
Significantly higher unem~ ploymnt, business<br />
seetrs to be in big trouble now, The mining<br />
boon seems to have burst, doesn't it? Where.<br />
do we go from here?<br />
Ifell what wre are going to have to do is to<br />
try and, you kaowx, do everything we can to<br />
minimise the im~ pact of world recession on<br />
Australia. You cannot prevent it entirely<br />
but you can take some action, And obviously<br />
wTe are going to be lookiing at this in our own<br />
Budget deliberations. In addition to that,<br />
we have got to mtake sure that Australials;<br />
industry is in a position to take advantage<br />
of any world iupturn wben it does come. You<br />
Rnow the shorter hours and ' the wage increases<br />
there %; ere pretty high through last year have<br />
damasged Australia's cor-petitive positiorn and<br />
if you are getting ten to twenty percen't wage<br />
Increases in Australia at a tiite when people<br />
in fterica or Britain or Europe are accepting<br />
six percent % rage increases it obviously makes<br />
it easier to sell other people, 8 goods and<br />
harder to sell ours.<br />
Rlight. Now you cobviously pujt that to the<br />
unions yesterday and e--ployers would have<br />
agrecAd. Did you get any result from that?<br />
0O% 1 think, you hnuw, I do not oant to<br />
attribute to people m~ ore than might be<br />
appropriate, but I think there Is a general<br />
recognition that wages a-rmongst other things<br />
do have a significant imtpact, upon the<br />
COmPetitive Position of Australian industry,<br />
and If you wanted to bundle a number of things<br />
in together IWAges, world trading poSition,<br />
the fall in coodity prices, in fact, in markets<br />
overseas, 1 think there would be agreeme~ nt that<br />
all these things co~ bined have made the position<br />
of Australian industry very difficult indeed.<br />
Right. At those talks yesterday did you secure<br />
any agreement from the unions or even a hint<br />
from the unions that they inight lessen the push<br />
for higher wages and shorter hours.<br />
% fell that is what a lot of it w'as all about. I<br />
think the~ re is an implicit uaderstanding that<br />
the pressure in these areas has done a good<br />
deal of daimage in the past, That is-my<br />
interpretation. I said it was il7 plicjt. I am </p>
<p>not saying it was Said openly. Because we<br />
were really approaching the problem. Here<br />
we are now in J-uy 192 I( t Nvas not m<br />
question of tryin~ g to cast blase by any of<br />
us on wrhat had happened in the past. There<br />
u1as no point in fighting over old battles.<br />
If the wage increases, as we believe, were<br />
too high over the last twelve months, 1he<br />
question is how best can that be uabsorbed<br />
how beat can you, you know, go througih the<br />
period ahead of us without malking the<br />
position of Australian industry anid<br />
consequently the employm~ ent of Australians<br />
even m~ ore difficult than it now is.<br />
CARLT03: Yes, Well one way uf doing that would be<br />
taxv cuts wouldn't it qad possibly in the<br />
next Budget?<br />
PM: Yes but one of the things we did point out<br />
is that at a period of falling activity,<br />
falling growth, a government's revenue was<br />
also falling and there might be P-very real<br />
question at the tine of our o'an B3udget<br />
deliberations. This question was put to the<br />
people at the meeting yesterday. Should wye<br />
give priority to helping people who are at<br />
work, vho are pa~ ying thxes, who did get<br />
reasonabl. i age incre-ases through the last<br />
twelve months or should be try and give<br />
priority to helping people aho are not<br />
employed or who may lose their . Jobs?<br />
CARlLTON: So in no semse was there a deal struck;<br />
that the unions would ease off on wiage demnand.<br />
if you cono up with a package of tax cuts?<br />
PM: There was not a deal struck in-that sense and<br />
it was not a m~ eetixng desigae-d to achieve<br />
deals at all. It was exploratory. The<br />
meeting demonstrated the good faith by the<br />
three parties and it demonstrated the comn<br />
comitment to do what they can to work<br />
together. N~ ow there is a Tripartite Working<br />
Party which is going to be examining a number<br />
of issues. The Trreasuzrer will be discussing<br />
in more detail) I think, today or tonorrow,<br />
taxati.-n issues. Senator Chaney or Senator<br />
Chaney's Departmental people will be<br />
discussing In detail elem~ ents of the social<br />
welfare/ social security systein and, in<br />
addition to that, the Tripartite Working<br />
Party is going to continue work in ua effort<br />
to put together a coron statem~ ent on the<br />
ecoaco= y. It m~ ight be put to the Iloore<br />
Conference on. Wages. Noew I am not saying that<br />
c-an be achieved. There is a coamitt.-eat to try<br />
and achieve it. </p>
<p>F-(' AR LTON:<br />
PIA: CARLTION: P11: CARLTO:: CARLTrON: CARLTON~: PH: YiOU sound q[ uite hopeful Of tHat.<br />
W~ ell I believe the Conference uas a<br />
positive step foroard rind to get r~ p~ n~ h. from~<br />
oifferent constituencies sitting ( toiin<br />
together and being determ. ined : o try and<br />
work together I think rcepresents a quite<br />
significant step. I do not want to overstate<br />
it but I also believe that Australians are<br />
often fed up with wh~ at appears to be<br />
divisiveness between different groups or<br />
different people in different positions when<br />
they really believe that Australians should<br />
be sitt~ tng down and working together to try<br />
and solve some of the problemxs we have as a<br />
nation and as a people.<br />
Allright but. agreemnent aside, there munst still<br />
be enormous political pressure rom the voters,<br />
quite sim~ ply, for tax cuts, It has been talked<br />
about. It has been headlines for a xibile,<br />
hasn't it? Can you grant themn?<br />
Well you ' uII have to read John ) Noward's<br />
Budget speecb to learn the answer to that.<br />
You must. be anxious -to do it. wvith that<br />
political pressure mouutirg.<br />
I think everyone is alyi-ays anxious to have tax<br />
cuts. I fura sure you hate paying taxes and I<br />
do. Wfe all do. But at the same time we all<br />
ask for goverm~ ent services of a irreat.<br />
variety of kinds.<br />
You are sounding perhaps less optimistic cow<br />
about tax cuts than you were and the Treasurer<br />
was about a mouth ago,<br />
% fell, you know, let we come back to the<br />
question that I put to the meetinjg yesterday:<br />
should we give priority to people who * re in<br />
work who are paying taxes wh. ~ 2opay<br />
tax or ahould we try and give priority to<br />
people who are out of wiork or Nvho may become<br />
out of work as a result of the situation<br />
Australia now finds itself. There are some<br />
policy implications in that question.<br />
Yes, so wdth Lnecployment rising, for instance,<br />
mere people out of work, you may haive to<br />
devote more money to social services and<br />
obviously less to the possibility of tax<br />
cuts.<br />
Well Ii there are more p~ eople on unem: loyment.<br />
ben~ efits there is an im~ eiate and automatic<br />
requirer. ent but, you kniow, ' ubat I was really<br />
askicg the meeting was should we be exam~ ining<br />
other thiags uhich might ease the im-pact of<br />
world recessioa 3n important sections<br />
of the Australian co--': jnity,<br />

<p>CAR LTON:<br />
CARLTON: PU: CARLTON: PMt: CARLTON: PMo: Allritght, rrlne Iinister, thc-\ ihole thrust of<br />
your econ(--ic policies since 1975 has been to<br />
screwv downa on the Budget Deficit* ha~ ti it?<br />
floes that conrtin~ ue now % una:. at-, V?<br />
YTell look we are in difficu: lt and different<br />
circumstances. We had to screw dovin on the<br />
) 3udget Deficit which had got to aibout live<br />
percent of gross doaestic product, arid that<br />
vias very high, aad at the &amp; a-e ttve we had<br />
to mrake vay for private induistry investment<br />
and a year ago private investirent was running<br />
at a thirty year record. It had gror-a<br />
e-normously. It continues at a high rate.<br />
But people are not going to be making m~ ajor<br />
new InveSTment decisions in the current<br />
clim. ate because they will want to sere a<br />
upturn In trade, they will<br />
opportunity to get better markets or get<br />
greater access to rmarlkets before they make<br />
those de-cisions. So private ir. vestrient is<br />
likely to start running dous once the current<br />
investment plans have been comnpleted.<br />
Does that make a case for loo-sening the. screws<br />
on the Deficit?<br />
Ifel1., let me only say it is on of the<br />
considerations th~ at we will heed to have-in our<br />
raind during our Budget deliberations and<br />
discussions next week and the, ieek. after.<br />
Kz. So in simple layr! an's terms there may<br />
be a case for the goverrnment pumping a little<br />
m~ ore money into the econom-y than it has been.<br />
that practice in past Budgets?<br />
WellI you put it in very blunt. term~ s and I<br />
would not want to use those terms at the<br />
mr cn-zwet but I do vant to m~ ake the. point,<br />
circumstances, have changed and wie have got<br />
to examine the implicatio~ ns of those change-d<br />
circurstances for our own. Budget p'l1icy.<br />
Prime Minister, I am about out of time but<br />
I vtould just like to put to you uhat I see a&amp;<br />
a sua-rary of uhat you have been saying. The<br />
ecouncy is io for a rough timze for lphatever<br />
reason but you see somie hope in the faict that<br />
employers, the unions and the Goverament are<br />
at least getting together on it. Would that<br />
be fair?<br />
' lea it is$ it is. I think you have summed it<br />
up and if there is going to be a rough time<br />
for the Australian ecoaomy and for a large<br />
number of Australians we owe it to everyone<br />
to do uhat we can to vwork together.<br />
C ARLTON But t~ at rough tire is ahead? X. N </p>
<p>CAR1TCN: PH CARLTON Page<br />
Ves I thiak it is. \ Ve ai~ e a great trading,<br />
nation, Thirty percent ot our national<br />
i1ncome is depeadent upon trade. You have<br />
only got to look at the dramatic falls in<br />
cuooity prices, the very real difliculties<br />
that the miners are An, the fall in the<br />
price of rural exports, the difficulties<br />
our mantufacturers are in selling in the<br />
export mark( ets they have gained.<br />
And the dollar down and the share mrarket<br />
dovin. And % yell, you know, the share mrarket cdown,<br />
that is a consequence really of all these<br />
other things and world trade is sbrinking.<br />
It has not been growing. In all these<br />
circumstances a difficult time ahead is<br />
unavoidable. Prime Minister, I know you will not tell me<br />
% hen you are going to call a Federal election.<br />
I will not even bolher to ask yuu but thanks<br />
v'ery much indeed for being with us this<br />
morning. Ifell tha-nk you very m~ uch, ' bye ' bye.<br />
CA~ TON: Prize lminiscer tialcolm Fraser on the line<br />
there from Canberra. it is pointle-ss to ask<br />
him uihen and if he plans to call a Federal<br />
election because he has not even tol( I Doug<br />
Anthony yet, if indee-d he knous himself, so<br />
I do not go in for those hypothetical<br />
questions. And tu sum it up as wi.! did with<br />
that last question, there is a rough time<br />
ahead for the Australian economy for<br />
whatever reason. Whether you agree with<br />
M4r. Fraser's reasoning behind it or not he<br />
has at least come out and said two things:<br />
bad timne for the economy, bad time obviouslytherefore<br />
for our trade overseas, the minilig<br />
boom down and, as he said there, unemployment<br />
up. The hope, perhaps, is in those meetings.<br />
