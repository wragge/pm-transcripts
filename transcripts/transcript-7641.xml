FOR MEDIA 16 JUNE 1989<br />
I welcomed the opportunity this morning to meet a delegation of<br />
representatives of Australia's Chinese community and to hear their<br />
views about the problems facing the community, and their relations<br />
and friends in China, as a result of the current tragic situation<br />
there. I used the opportunity provided by this meeting to announce a range<br />
of important new Government initiatives designed to help ameliorate<br />
some of these problems.<br />
The Government has now decided to extend all temporary entry<br />
permits on application for a further 12 months until July 31<br />
1990), for all PRC nationals legally in Australia on June 4 this<br />
year. In order to help them financially the students will be<br />
entitled to work for up to 20 hours per week and will be allowed to<br />
work full time should their courses finish during the 12 month<br />
period. The Government appreciates the financial and other problems which<br />
could face some Chinese nationals in Australia who do not have<br />
access to social security, or Medicare. we are therefore looking<br />
at ways in which these people's needs can be assisted by access to<br />
the " special benefits" program administered by the Minister for<br />
Social Security.<br />
I warmly applaud the fund raising efforts of Australia's Chinese<br />
community. To help further these efforts the Government has now<br />
given in-principle agreement to a $ 100,000 grant to provide<br />
humanitarian assistance in China. That grant is on top of the<br />
$ 200,000 already put aside for use in a possible Red Cross Appeal.<br />
I told the delegation that while visa processing, including of<br />
student applications, is currently suspended, we hope that<br />
processing will be resumed as soon as visa-issuing staff can safely<br />
return to China. Arrangements are being made in the meantime for<br />
abbreviated visa processing for urgent migrant cases involving<br />
immediate family of Australian citizens and permanent residents.<br />
A Cabinet Submission is now being developed as a priority matter,<br />
to deal with all aspects of PRC nationals in Australia ( including<br />
refugee status, grant of residence permit on humanitarian grounds,<br />
family reunion issues and the possibility of refugee resettlement<br />
for some PRC nationals overseas). There is a number of complex<br />
matters that need to be addressed and these require Cabinet's<br />
deliberation. The Government will continue to monitor de~. elopments in China and<br />
their implications for our bilateral relationship carefully, and to<br />
assess the possibility of further appropriate action, particularly<br />
in regard to the human rights situation. </p>
