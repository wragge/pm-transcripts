PRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH RADIO. AUSTRALIA ON<br />
RHODESIA 5 MARCH 1980<br />
Question Prime Minister can I ask you first for your reactLion to the<br />
election result in Zimbabwe?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Well I am very glad that the processes have gone forth. All the<br />
reports that I have seen from election observ~ ers have indicated<br />
that they believe that the elections have been free and fair.<br />
Obviously there were problems. There has been intimidation.<br />
But you have to have in mind the history of the issue the hatred<br />
and fighting that has gone on for year after year. It is a<br />
remarkable achievement to have come to an agreement and to have<br />
been able to consumate it in this way. As each day passes I<br />
think there can be more confidence -that the future would be<br />
reasonably looked after.<br />
Question Given that conflict that you mentioned, do you think that Mr.<br />
Mugabe can form a government that will be acceptable to everybody<br />
there and that he can hold it together?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
The statements that he has been making seem to me to have been<br />
well and properly directed. He is talking about the need for<br />
national unity, the need to govern for a. llpeople in Zimbabwe,.--<br />
the need to support the constitution, to support the rights of<br />
all people irrespective of race, colour or creed. The reports<br />
that are coming to us do indicate that he is seeking to involve<br />
as many different groups in his government as possible. That has<br />
yet to be seen. But if these objectives can be fulfilled and if<br />
the principles that he has enunciated in a recent speech are<br />
pursued then I would have thought that there is a real possibility<br />
for the new Zimbabwe to go forward with a real degree of certainty<br />
ndsecurity and -with-the-peace which -the' country -just* has not<br />
known for fifteen years.<br />
Question But the initial reaction from -sane-of the whites at least seem~ to be one<br />
of horror. Now do you expect there to be an exodus of whites<br />
from Zimbabwe to South Africa and possibly even to Australia?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Well no I don't. There has been that reaction. Some of the press<br />
reports over here have referred to it. But the intelligence<br />
coming to me indicates that there are a large number of people<br />
trying to get people to assess the matter as it is. Mr. Mugabe,<br />
himself that he wants people to stay in Zimbabwe and that he<br />
does want to govern for all the people of Zimbabwe black and<br />
white. Therefore I think there are encouraging signs. I think<br />
it would be most unfortunate if we were to assume that because<br />
a certain party has won the vote that there is therefore going to<br />
be a situation which would encourage and persuade a lot of people<br />
to leave Zimbabwe. From what he has said, that is certainly not<br />
Mr. Mugabe's objective. Again I think we need to look at what<br />
has happened over the last six months since the Lusaka Agreement, </p>
<p>Prime Minister ( continued) I<br />
the Lancaster House document, the development of the new constitutior<br />
the development of the transition arrangements, the actual<br />
practice and experience that has occurred during the election<br />
period. Now all of this is slowly, step by step, building up a situation whe. Lthecountry<br />
can return to what we might regard as a degree of normalcygoing<br />
about their business in an ordinary and peaceful way. So<br />
each day that passes gives everyone a greater degree of confidence<br />
that the next day will also be a reasonable one and a sensible one.<br />
I would hope therefore that the alarmist tunes will not be played<br />
and that Mr. Mugabe is able to live by -the standards and<br />
principles -that he announced a day or two ago in a major speech.<br />
Question Are you suggesting though if white Rhodesians find they can't live<br />
under a black government and want out that Australia might not be<br />
too eager to accept them?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I do not like dealing with hypothetical situations. IL do not like<br />
saying things which could even encourage a situation to arise<br />
which otherwise might not because the white people in Zimbabwe<br />
have built their homes. I have spoken to a large number of white<br />
people when I was in Zambia and Lusaka and that was where their<br />
homes were they wanted to stay there. They said they lived in<br />
a multi racial society. It was a society without tension and<br />
they were at peace and happy in their homes. Now quite plainly<br />
the objective is to see that the same kind of thing develops in<br />
Zimbabwe. It is early days yet and there will be people who w illI<br />
okigOtefuEure v . ery -bl'bsely to ; be what unfolds" to see<br />
the sorts of policies that are pursued. I do not think it helps<br />
for people to jump to the alarmist conclusions when up to this<br />
point. The things that have happened have been reassuring.<br />
Question<br />
At what point would the Australian Government be prepared to extend<br />
rognition to Mr.. NMugabe.' s government?<br />
Prime M~ inister<br />
Well the Government has not considered that at this point. But I[<br />
would be expecting that once formal. power is handed over and the<br />
government is established that that would be the point a formal<br />
process. There would be no question of recognition being withheld.<br />
It would be unthinkable after the processes. So it is a question<br />
of having the right time. I have sent Mr. Mugabe messages today<br />
and you will have heard what was said in the Parliament. He does<br />
need to be congratulated on his resounding electoral win. And<br />
one of the things that we need to have in mind is that processes<br />
for the election were established about 93 per cent of the people<br />
voted. They have been judged free and fair and Mr. Mugabe has<br />
won the election. Now whether people support Mr. Mugabe's personal,<br />
political philosophy or not he has been judged by the people of<br />
Zimbabwe as the person that they want to run the government.<br />
Against that background, if we had the kind of confidence that we<br />
ought in the democratic process, the judgment has certainly got<br />
to be respected and therefore Mr. Mugabe congratulated on what is<br />
plainly a very significant electoral win. </p>
<p>Question Prime M~ inister what's the situation now regarding sanctions and<br />
economic aid to Zimbabwe Rhodesia?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Sanctions have been off for some time. Claims and suggestions for<br />
economic aid, civil aid will be examined by the Department. You<br />
know most of our aid does go to qoutheast Asia and to the Pacific.<br />
Somo aid has gone to Africa. I have got no doubt there will be<br />
some things in which we will have some involvement in relation. to<br />
Zimbabwe if that is their wish.<br />
Question<br />
Prime Minister, thank you. 000---</p>
