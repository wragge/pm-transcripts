    <content><![CDATA[<p>
I am pleased to announce that Prime Minister Helen Clark of New Zealand will visit Australia on Friday 15 February 2002 for annual trans-Tasman prime ministers'; talks in Sydney.<br />
Few countries enjoy such a strong, broad and enduring relationship as that shared by Australia and New Zealand.  Our regular meetings reflect the value Miss Clark and I both place on maintaining our strong ties in good repair.<br />
Our talks will as usual cover a broad range of bilateral, regional and international concerns, including trade.  Amongst other things, we expect to speak about issues for the forthcoming CHOGM at Coolum in March, developments in the Asia-Pacific region where we collaborate so effectively, and our respective responses to terrorism.  I also hope to discuss practical steps to strengthen trans-Tasman economic cooperation still further as CER';s twentieth anniversary approaches.</p>
