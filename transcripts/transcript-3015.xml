diplomatic missions should not only be functional and efficient<br />
but demonstrate overseas the qualities and skills of some of<br />
Australia's leading architects.<br />

Jakarta. A project involving t'he complete redesign ana<br />

Tokyo had also been undertaken by the Department of Works.<br />
Mr Whitlam said that the estimated total cost of the<br />
works was more than $ 32 million during the next three years.<br />
This did not include fees for architects and other consultants,<br />
which would amount to about ten per cent of the design and<br />
construction costs.<br />
