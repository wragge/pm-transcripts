4r-V AUST ALIA 16 May 1974<br />
TERRORIST ATTACK ON ISRAELI SCHOOL CHILDREN<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam, said today<br />
that he was deeply shocked by the incident at Ma'alot<br />
in Israel in which 90 children had been held hostage<br />
by guerillas and by the tragic deaths of 16 of these<br />
innocents. Mr Whitlam reiterated Australia's condemnation<br />
of all such acts of terrorism especially those resulting<br />
in the loss of innocent lives and the injury of children.<br />
He said that this action was a deplorable extension of<br />
the shocking practice of taking hostages.<br />
The Prime Minister added that events such as<br />
those at Ma'alot could only prolong bitterness and<br />
' hostility in the Middle East and harm the search for a<br />
lasting peace which Australia so earnestly supported.<br />
