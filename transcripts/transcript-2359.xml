VISIT OF THE HEAD OF STATE OF BURMA<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton<br />
At the invitation of the Governor-General, the Chairman<br />

two countries since the foundation of the Union of Burma. We welcome<br />
this visit as an opportunity to underline our interest in the progress<br />
