PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH JOHN LAWS, RADIO 2UE, 7 JUNE 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF ONLY<br />
JL: And seeking a little democratic treatment, on the line from Canberra is<br />
our Prime Minister Paul Keating. Paul Keating good morning.<br />
PM: Howare you John?<br />
JL: I wonder if Laurie ( Brereton) knows what he has done with this unfair<br />
dismissal thing. Do you think he wakes up at night?<br />
PM: What he is trying to do is protect most Australian workers from being<br />
preyed upon by unscrupulous employers.<br />
JL: You don't really believe that most Australian workers are preyed upon by<br />
unscrupulous employers?<br />
PM: Many are though, many are.<br />
JL: Many are. But the majority aren't, are they?<br />
PM: Well put it this way, if the unfair dismissal provisions weren't there, many<br />
more would be unfairly dismissed.<br />
JL: Yes, but they weren't there before, were they?<br />
PM: Yes I think they were.<br />
JL: Well I mean they were there to a degree, but not to the extent that we<br />
have now got 6,000 cases, waiting to be heard, of unfair dismissal.<br />
PM: Well I mean either people have their rights protected, or not. I mean<br />
these matters are arbitrated.<br />
JL: But don't you have a responsibility in your life to protect your own rights? </p>
<p>PM: Well you can to some extent, but it is like you protecting yourself from<br />
somebody coming into your house, or protecting yourself on the road.<br />
You get protected by the laws of the State.<br />
JL: And the laws of the State have always been in place to protect people.<br />
PM: Exactly, but there wasn't any here.<br />
JL: I mean how can we allow a situation to occur where we have got people<br />
wanting to employ other Australians, those people should be rewarded<br />
for wanting to employ other Australians, then you have a fellow who<br />
resigns of his own volition because he can't physically do the work and<br />
the company is taken to court for unfair dismissal when he resigned? I<br />
mean that is just crazy.<br />
PM: Look I don't know the detail of that case. You will always, with some of<br />
these things, find all sorts of anomalies. The main thing is the principle<br />
and the principle is that there should be, you know, fairness in treatment<br />
of people when they have been put off.<br />
JL: Yes, it seems to me it's very much in favour and it seems to the majority<br />
of Australians, incidentally, that it is very much in favour of the<br />
employee, not the employer, and the employer is the one who really<br />
should be rewarded for wanting to employ other Australians, I would<br />
have thought.<br />
PM: Well they are rewarded by way of the fact that the economy is growing<br />
strongly and the profit share is at the highest it has ever been in history.<br />
I mean you have still got the workforce delivering a low inflation rate and<br />
high productivity. So, by and large, something good's happening out<br />
there.<br />
JL: Oh, yes, a lot of good things are happening, no doubt about that, a lot of<br />
good things are happening. But we would probably have a bigger<br />
workforce if people were brave enough to employ others because many<br />
are frightened by this unfair dismissal thing and other requirements.<br />
Anyway we didn't want to talk about that in particular. What I wanted to<br />
talk about.. I know you didn't get a chance to listen to the Howard<br />
speech because it was delivered to a room full of the Party faithful at a<br />
private function, not in Parliament. But have you looked at a printed<br />
copy of it?<br />
PM: Oh yes I read it. I mean he kept his word. He said there would be<br />
nothing in the speech and there wasn't. It was completely empty. I<br />
mean John Howard is the same person he was in the 1980s and the<br />
interesting thing is when he actually stood up on the election night of<br />
1987 conceding defeat, he said " well there are more things that unite<br />
Australians than divide them". And that was a theme in his television </p>
<p>remarks interview last night and in his speech. I mean not even the<br />
cliches have changed in eight years.<br />
JL: No, but to be fair to him, it wasn't his intention to deliver specific policies<br />
last night and he said so. Headland is, I suppose, a landmark in terms<br />
of dumping the past, several of the Liberal Party ideologies have gone<br />
and I suppose it is a shift back to middle ground. So I suppose it is a<br />
landmark to a degree.<br />
PM: Well you can't tell what a person's policies are until you see what they<br />
say, you know, and what the Government is always required to do, under<br />
great scrutiny, is deliver every last policy change, and detail them, and<br />
fund them, and say what the trend lines are, and the expenditures. And<br />
to get up with this sort of waffle anyway, I think the commentators sort<br />
of basically I mean Michelle Grattan, in The Age, said " by including a<br />
bit of everything, but not too much of anything, the speech became a<br />
blancmange, lost impact and gave the Government greater scope for<br />
attack" and Mr Kitney, in The Sydney Morning Herald, said " it's<br />
substance could only be assessed when he explains precisely how he<br />
will achieve his goals, with a heading No policy is the best policy". So,<br />
you know, I think honesty and credibility in public life, John, can only<br />
start with policies. In only politics, honesty and credibility is all about<br />
policies. To be going around saying I haven't got any policies is both<br />
dishonest and incredible.<br />
JL: Yes well to me it seems that way and Mr Howard and I differ very<br />
strongly on this issue. I believe that the people want to know what his<br />
policies might be. As I said to him the other day somewhere, it is like<br />
having a fellow who has been pestering you to buy you a drink for years<br />
and finally you say okay you can buy me a drink, I'll have a beer and he<br />
says no, hang on I am not going to tell you what you are going to drink,<br />
you might get poisoned.<br />
PM: Yes, that is exactly right. That is right. And for instance, can I just say<br />
this, just look he had one line in there which I think said it all and this<br />
is about foreign policy. Now you know how over the last couple of years<br />
we have made these much greater bilateral links with Japan, with<br />
Indonesia, how we put together APEC through an Asia Pacific rim<br />
trading body. He says " the next Coalition Government will continue the<br />
pattern". That is it. I mean a backbencher who has been in the<br />
Parliament a year would be ashamed to put a statement like that out.<br />
JL: Well why do you believe the Liberal Party is loath to release any<br />
policies? They must surely have them.<br />
PM: No they don't. You see there is nothing going on. You see, John, it is<br />
no accident when John Howard was Treasurer we ended up with double<br />
digit unemployment, double digit inflation, the biggest Budget deficit in<br />
our history and an appalling lack of international competitiveness. He<br />
didn't have any ideas and he never has had. And when he got the </p>
<p>leadership in the 1980s, it came to nothing. They tipped him out again<br />
for Andrew Peacock.<br />
JL: Yes, anyway that aside, just quickly back to what occurred in this<br />
speech. I called it Cape Fear because he seemed to be terrified, rather<br />
than a headland speech, because he seemed to be terrified to give any<br />
policies. But in fairness I keep saying to myself he did say he wouldn't<br />
give any policies, but he did interestingly say that he wouldn't govern on<br />
behalf of vested interests. Is he having a go at you there, suggesting<br />
that you do?<br />
PM: No he doesn't say who the vested interests are because if he did he<br />
would have to say they are the working men and women of Australia.<br />
I mean that is basically the vested interests that the Government looks<br />
after, the working men and women of Australia. Then he had that line, I<br />
mean it was unbelievable, he said that he had been, wait until I find it,<br />
" after a week of us fighting for the interests of the Australian battler". A<br />
week! The Australian Labor Party has been fighting them for 100 years.<br />
But I mean, John, he kept his word, he said there would be nothing in it<br />
and there wasn't.<br />
JL: The shift to a Republic But, again, in fairness to him he did say he<br />
wouldn't give any policies.<br />
PM: That is right because he represents nothing and he stands for nothing.<br />
JL: The shift to a Republic is inevitable. I mean most people have come to<br />
that conclusion. Do you think you are rushing it?<br />
PM: Oh no, well, you know, I have had Malcolm Turnbull and others<br />
criticising me for being too slow in responding to the Republican<br />
Advisory Committee Report, which was brought down 18 months ago.<br />
But can I just say, just before I leave Mr Howard understand this point<br />
he wouldn't even say last night and I doubt very much whether he will<br />
say tomorrow night, whether he actually believes that Australia should<br />
have an Australian as head of state or not. I mean, it is a simple enough<br />
question. You could say ' look, just leave the modalities to one side, how<br />
we actually make the change'.<br />
JL: Yes.<br />
PM: Do you actually believe that an Australian should be our head of state?<br />
A reasonable enough question. He won't answer it because he doesn't<br />
believe that an Australian should be our head of state. He believes<br />
Queen Elizabeth the Second of Great Britain should be our head of<br />
state. But, he is now afraid to say it because he thinks too many people<br />
believe in a republic, and he'll get off side with them. So, his policy is to<br />
say ' we will have a constitutional convention to discuss the Constitution'.<br />
Frankly John, any silly mug can go and discuss the Constitution. </p>
<p>JL Well, it happens around dinner tables almost every night.<br />
PM: Exactly. But I mean, as a political leader, at least in response to a<br />
speech where tonight I am saying we should have an Australian<br />
republic, an Australian person should be our head of state and saying<br />
how we will get there. He gets a reply on the ABC tomorrow night, but I<br />
bet pounds to peanuts he fudges the issue about whether he actually<br />
believes in a republic or not. You see, because in the end, this man is<br />
completely indecisive.<br />
JL It seems to me that one of the problems that you confront, not you as an<br />
individual, but is confronted by republicans is that there is a very strong<br />
desire by the public to have a say in choosing the figure head leader of<br />
this yet to be determined republic. How do you get around that?<br />
PM: Well, I think, tonight we'll explain where we are coming from on the<br />
issue. I think the main thing is that the Government is not interested in a<br />
major change to our system of government. The Australian system of<br />
government works very well, in my opinion. If you look at the policy<br />
changes of the last 12 years, there would not be a country in the OECD<br />
that has gone through greater policy changes or a community which has<br />
so willingly participated in and accepted them. So, whatever we do, we<br />
don't want to in any way alter that. But, what we do want, we can't, I<br />
don't think, summon the sense of ourselves or our role in the world by<br />
saying ' oh, just by the way our head of state is the Monarch of Great<br />
Britain'.<br />
JL Yes, incidentally, when was the last time the Queen countermanded any<br />
decision made by any Australian Prime Minister, do you know?<br />
PM: I think, probably, I don't know whether I could tell you what that is, but I<br />
think, the issue is worse than that. And that is, by having a deputy the<br />
Governor-General who the Queen makes very clear, she will not<br />
remove or chastise, you have got somebody taking liberties that even<br />
she wouldn't take. I think that was very obvious with Sir John Kerr in<br />
1975. After he did what he did, she didn't remove him. So, where one<br />
could rely upon, if you like, the common sense, the reserve, the<br />
judgement of the Queen in relating to a constitutional issue, say as she<br />
does in Britain, as she would do here if she was the direct head of state,<br />
by having a deputy who takes all responsibility and if they choose, no<br />
care, it seems to me we end up with the worst of both of worlds. You<br />
lose the experience and reserve that the Queen herself has and you pick<br />
up whatever is the whim and caprice of the incumbent Governor-<br />
General.<br />
JL You can understand the general public being a little reticent to allow<br />
politicians to elect their head of state can't you. I suppose you can, I'm<br />
assuming that? </p>
<p>PM: Let me just say this. Tonight all will be revealed. But, let me just say<br />
this John, what you have got in Australia is a representative democracy.<br />
You have got each MP coming from their constituency to Parliament and<br />
you can see how the Parliamentary system responds to public opinion.<br />
It is a diffuse parliamentary system in which no person is elected ( at<br />
large). For instance, I was not elected Prime Minister. I was elected a<br />
member of my Party. My Party appointed me as Leader and the<br />
Governor-General appointed me as Prime Minister. I am not standing<br />
here speaking to you as the elected Prime Minister. Nor are any<br />
Ministers elected. The obvious point in that is if one doesn't remain<br />
relevant, one changes. The same with Opposition Leaders. Just take<br />
the Opposition. They have had now three leaders in this term of<br />
Parliament because the other two were no longer relevant or they<br />
thought useful. The same goes for the Government. You saw in the last<br />
Parliament, Mr Hawke removed by the Caucus where I was installed. I<br />
could be removed myself.<br />
In other words, there is a healthy assessment by a large group<br />
representing the community in a representative way from each<br />
constituency which gives a real living feel to our democracy day in and<br />
day out.<br />
JL: Yes, but the general public and you can't blame them, I suppose, for the<br />
cynicism, tend to feel that there is room for manipulation within the<br />
Parliament.<br />
PM: Well John, just take for instance a couple of issues of the recent past.<br />
Take the woodchip decision of last Christmas. A lot of people thought it<br />
was unjustified. The Government was subject to pressure over it. Public<br />
opinion changed over it. So, the Government remedied the policy. In<br />
other words, the Parliamentary system of government responds. Take<br />
an issue like Aboriginal health. People think it is appalling to find<br />
Aborigines having a shorter life span than non-Aboriginal Australians.<br />
That seeps into public opinion. It then comes into the Parliament. But if<br />
one person is sitting in a position of popular election for a long period of<br />
time, then they are impervious to opinion.<br />
JL: Yes, I agree with what you are saying and I understand the theory of it<br />
and the examples that you have given are very clear, but you can still<br />
understand right or wrong it is all about perception. We have talked<br />
about it often, it is perceived that there is room for manipulation if it is<br />
going to be politicians who don't rate very highly in the minds of the<br />
populous are going to have a say in who is going to be this figure head<br />
leader.<br />
PM: But John, just have a look at the effort in the last dozen years. I mean, a<br />
per cent improvement in national competitiveness. An inflation rate<br />
of 2 to 3 per cent.<br />
JL: Yes, all this is terrific, I was talking about.. </p>
<p>PM: But I'm making this point<br />
JL: I don't quite know what it has got to do with the figure head leader of a<br />
republic.<br />
PM: What I'm saying, is the system is responsive. It actually works. Here is<br />
a country which needed a major remedial surgery on its economy and<br />
got it out of its system. I mean, I don't think anyone should have any<br />
doubt, should be cynical about the system. The system works and the<br />
other thing about it, can I say, and I'd say this for the Coalition and the<br />
National Party and the Labor Party, I don't know of one corrupt person in<br />
years in public life of the Federal Parliament. That is a remark John<br />
Howard made the other day too. I don't.<br />
JL: Yes, well I suppose all those things are to be taken into account. Prime<br />
Minister I have got to leave you and I know you have got a commitment<br />
as well. Thank you very much for spending some time with us.<br />
PM: It is a pleasure, John.<br />
JL: Good to talk to you.<br />
