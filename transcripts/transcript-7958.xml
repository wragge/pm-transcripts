PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH PAUL MURPHY, ABC PM<br />
14 MARCH 1990<br />
E OE PROOF ONLY<br />
MURPHY: Prime Minister, you head a government but<br />
yesterday you and the Treasurer were trying to talk<br />
interest rates down. Is this an indication of how<br />
worryingly tight this election is for you, that you and<br />
Mr Keating decide to comment on interest rates within<br />
hours of each other, something you've previously been<br />
reluctant to do?<br />
PM: We've been talking about interest rates from the<br />
beginning of the election Paul. I was doing no more,<br />
neither was Paul Keating, than to state the obvious. The<br />
obvious is that interest rates have been deliberately<br />
high last year, not because we wanted to have a tight<br />
monetary policy as such, but to help slow down the level<br />
of activity in the economy. We were stating the obvious<br />
that that policy had been working, the economy was<br />
slowing down, and in those circumstances that the<br />
conditions were right for a fall in interest rates. That<br />
was not only appropriate for us to say that as a f actual<br />
situation, but we would've been failing in our obligation<br />
as leaders of our Party if we didn't put to the people of<br />
Australia that factual position, which factual position<br />
Paul, I am pleased to say, has been endorsed as you would<br />
notice by the comments that have been made this morning<br />
f rom within the banking industry.<br />
MURPHY: But you don't think unfair pressure might have<br />
been put on the Reserve, trying to lock it in, by the<br />
comments particularly made by your Treasurer?<br />
PM: No, not at all Paul. The Treasurer I think has a<br />
proper and effective relationship with the Reserve which<br />
l ~ s been established over the years under a head of the<br />
Reserve that was appointed by our predecessor and then<br />
under the head that we've appointed to replace Bob<br />
Johnson. It has always been a proper and effective<br />
relationship both with the Governor of the Reserve and<br />
the members of the board.<br />
MURPHY: But ironically of course while you and your<br />
Treasurer were making the comments you were yesterday,<br />
some banks have been raising rates on fixed rate<br />
mortgages. </p>
<p>PM: Well yes, but we dealt with that effectively<br />
yesterday. Those fixed rate mortgages are financed by<br />
the banks by fixed rate securities. And because of what<br />
happened af ter we lowered the Par ratio and there was a<br />
selling of f of those securities, the rate on the bonds<br />
went up and that was reflected in the decision they made<br />
in regard to their fixed rate mortgages. But it was<br />
quite clear that it had no impact upon variable rate<br />
mortgages. And indeed the statements that have been made<br />
this morning I mean I just don't go to all of them<br />
but if you refer to the statement by the St George<br />
Building Society that said, the spokesman there said the<br />
trend is still positive, a fall in interest rates is a<br />
reasonable expectation. The ANZ Bank said the direction<br />
of change will be towards lower interest rates. So what<br />
Paul Keating and I said yesterday, I repeat, was an<br />
observation as to the factual position. Those<br />
observations that we've made have been endorsed<br />
subsequently. MURPHY: Before moving on though Prime Minister, in the<br />
end the markets will decide the level of interest rates<br />
PM: But Paul<br />
MURPHY: But politicians certainly influence the<br />
markets don't they. I mean politicians<br />
PM: marginally. Paul, marginally. I mean, when you<br />
say the markets determine, that's right, but also<br />
governments determine the environment within which<br />
markets set rates. And that's the point that Paul and I<br />
have been making, that we had been running a tight<br />
monetary policy during last year not because we wanted<br />
to. As I've said so often, I don't either want to hurt<br />
myself, I'm not a masochist, and I certainly don't want<br />
to hurt my fellow Australians. But it was necessary,<br />
given the enormous increase in imports which had come in<br />
to fill that gap between the eight percent growth in<br />
0 consumption and the four percent increase in production,<br />
we had to lower the level of activity to lower the level<br />
of imports. Now we've set the policies in a way<br />
calculated to be best for the future development of the<br />
Australian economy. It required a lowering of activity.<br />
That's been done. So the markets aren't totally<br />
autonomous in that sense. They do depend upon having a<br />
gbvernment which sets the right envi-ronment. That's the<br />
basic point, Paul, that I've been making together with<br />
Paul Keating in this campaign. Why the banks are able to<br />
say that interest rates will be coming down is because<br />
we've got the policy settings right. We have fixed the<br />
position where the banking industry, employers and<br />
employees, know what the wages outcomle is going to be in<br />
the period ahead in the twelve months. They know that<br />
we've got the budget under control. That's why they can<br />
say in regard to our policies that the rates will come<br />
down. But under the Opposition the position is quite the </p>
<p>opposite. There would be a wages explosion and the<br />
budget surplus would be blown.<br />
MURPHY: Prime Minister, we are half-way through the<br />
second last week of the campaign and there's not much<br />
movement out there in the electorate. Either voters<br />
really can't make up their minds or they're utterly<br />
disillusioned with both major parties. What can you say<br />
to voters who think neither of you have anything to offer<br />
them and they don't believe what you say anyway.<br />
PM: I think that your first statement is an<br />
overstatement, that there is no indication of what's<br />
happening out there. I think there are some indications<br />
that the people are understanding that the policies that<br />
I am offering on behalf of the Government offer the best<br />
alternative. What I can say in answer to the last part<br />
of your question why should they come to the decision,<br />
more of them now, to vote for the Government it's<br />
basically very simple. Do you want a continuation of job<br />
growth, where we've had five times the rate of job<br />
creation that the conservatives created. If the answer<br />
is yes then you must vote for us because the basic reason<br />
why, under the Labor Government, you've had this<br />
explosion in employment and record investment which is<br />
recreating the Australian economy for the future to make<br />
us more competitive, all of that is basically because we<br />
have had a wages policy that's worked. Now Mr Peacock<br />
has had the question put to him before the campaign and<br />
during it ' can you tell us Mr Peacock what the wages<br />
outcome will be?' He's had to say ' Who's to knows. He<br />
doesn't know and he can't be detailed about it because he<br />
knows that there will be a wages explosion. So the<br />
central issue in my judgement for the people of Australia<br />
is, in regard to the economy, you'v e got a government<br />
which can in fact deliver an appropriate wages policy.<br />
The alternative can't. I mean you have the nonsense in<br />
this morning's press of Mr Blunt talking about wages<br />
policy. I mean you've never seen anything so ridiculous<br />
in your life. He said, well of course a lot of people<br />
won't be able to get any wage increase because they can't<br />
get any more productivity. And he of ferred the<br />
scintillatingly brilliant suggestion for hire car<br />
operators that they could increase their productivity by<br />
buying stretch limousines and get more people in their<br />
cars. MURPHY: Returning to disillusion, the Party's own<br />
research plus mainstream polling organisations do show<br />
there's a lot of disillusion out there, that they look at<br />
you and Andrew Peacock and they're not excited. I mean<br />
have you lost the ability to inspire Australian voters?<br />
PM: Let me say Paul, if you say they are looking at Bob<br />
Hawke and Andrew Peacock, I invite you to see and then<br />
reveal to your listeners what the judgements are and the<br />
straight comparisons between Bob Hawke and Andrew<br />
Peacock. You've raised the issue Paul that they look at </p>
<p>Bob Hawke and Andrew Peacock and they make conclusions.<br />
Well I'm too modest Paul to spell out what the<br />
conclusions are when they look at Bob Hawke and Andrew<br />
Peacock. But you know what they are and perhaps you<br />
could tell your listeners.<br />
MURPHY: But you don' t accept<br />
PM: comparison.<br />
MURHPY: But you don't accept that there is disillusion<br />
out there?<br />
PM: I accept, and I've said all the way along, before<br />
this campaign started, that politics in this country and<br />
around the world are undergoing quite a considerable<br />
change. I've never tried to hide that fact. I mean<br />
there are a number of issues emerging as matters of<br />
importance in the minds of electors Paul that weren't<br />
there before. The overwhelmingly important issue that<br />
has changed the structure and character of politics in<br />
this country and around the world is the environment. I<br />
mean a lot of people are saying that for them that's the<br />
fundamentally important issue. And they are casting<br />
their votes or indicating that they'll cast their votes<br />
to non-major parties to give effect to their major<br />
concern on the environment. There is a conclusion which<br />
follows from that though which I want to put to your<br />
listeners, and it is this. If your major concern is the<br />
environment and you wish to express that by voting for a<br />
party other than the Labor Party with your first<br />
preference, remember then that it is either the Labor<br />
Party or the conservative parties which will form the<br />
government. And on the issue of the environment my<br />
record leaves the conservatives for dead. I saved the<br />
Franklin against their opposition. I saved Kakadu from<br />
mining against their opposition. I saved the Daintree<br />
from logging against their opposition. I've saved the<br />
tall forests of Tasmania against their opposition. So as<br />
far as the election is concerned with people wanting to<br />
register their first concern about the environment, I'm<br />
not upset about that, I understand it. But please make<br />
sure that the second preference goes to the Labor Party<br />
because we are the ones with the positive record and the<br />
conservatives have an absolutely appalling record.<br />
M$ RPHY: Yes it's interesting that you mention<br />
independent standing and green candidates and the<br />
Democrats of course and you keep on putting emphasis on<br />
the second preferences and the importance of them.<br />
Obviously you want them to flow your way or as many as<br />
possible. But what about the first preference? I mean<br />
that's even more important isn't it. I mean really,<br />
you'd be appealing to people to vote for you, wouldn't<br />
you, on the environment rather than independents?<br />
PM: Well I would. But I've got to accept the reality<br />
that some people are going to say that they regard the </p>
<p>I environment as so important that they want to vote for a<br />
party, the green candidates, who have the environment as<br />
virtually their only issue. Now obviously I think it<br />
would be wiser for people to cast their first vote for us<br />
because it's either Labor or the coalition which is going<br />
to form the government. I certainly believe Labor. So<br />
it makes more sense if environment is your concern to<br />
make sure that Labor gets elected because we have a<br />
record which has led the World Heritage Bureau to say<br />
this let me quote it. They said ' no country has done<br />
more to advance world heritage values than Australia'.<br />
Now that's the judgement of the World Heritage Bureau.<br />
And if you want that record to be maintained then a vote<br />
for Labor is the best way of doing it.<br />
MURPHY: The best way. In other words you're not<br />
suggesting to people if they're really concerned about<br />
the environment they should vote for an independent or a<br />
green or even a Democrat?<br />
PM: No, no, I'm saying that the best way of voting to<br />
protect the environment is to deliver your vote straight<br />
to Labor. Because we're the ones that can form the<br />
government and we're the ones that have got the record.<br />
So deliver the vote straight to us. But I'm simply<br />
saying if they won't do that, and I urge them to do it,<br />
go straight to us, if they don't, make sure that the<br />
second preference comes to us.<br />
MURPHY: Yes indeed. Of course preferences are vital,<br />
particularly the Democrats because they seem to be<br />
polling very strongly. You must have got a rude shock in<br />
the West only yesterday.<br />
PM: But you might notice, if you read the transcript, I<br />
was a little prescient. I mean I said well I'm not sure<br />
that that decision will stick. I don't think I was being<br />
unduly brilliant In saying that. I mean I was simply, I<br />
was analysing it and saying well how can the Democrats<br />
adhere to a decision which involves giving a second<br />
preference in the majority of seats in Western Australia<br />
to the conservatives, which would mean Democrat voters<br />
voting for a uranium enrichment industry, voting for<br />
mining in Kakadu, voting for the abolition of the capital<br />
gains tax. It didn't seem to me that they could stick to<br />
that decision, and they haven't.<br />
-4i<br />
MURPHY: You've been asked this before, but I'll ask you<br />
again. If you win on March 24, how long will you stick<br />
around? PM: I will stay the full term of the next Parliament. I<br />
notice in their increasing desperation the conservatives<br />
are trying to breathe some life into a dead horse. They<br />
tried this earlier on and said that a vote for Bob Hawke<br />
was a vote for Paul Keating, to which Paul gave the<br />
eminently clever and accurate response that a vote for<br />
Andrew Peacock is a vote for Andrew Peacock. Now I think </p>
<p>everyone accepted that I knew better about my future than<br />
Tony Eggleton or Andrew Peacock. I'd like to hear their<br />
estimate about Andrew's future, by the way, after the<br />
24th. But that's another issue. I'm simply saying that<br />
I will go the full term of the next Parliament.<br />
MURPHY: And resist any temptation there might be, say 18<br />
months on, to retire and hand over?<br />
PM: Yes indeed. Well, when you say any pressure<br />
MURPHY: No, temptation.<br />
PM: Well, temptation. I mean you don't understand Paul<br />
the enormous pride and pleasure I derive from being Prime<br />
Minister of the best country in the world. I mean<br />
Australia is the best country in the world. To have the<br />
honour of leading it is not something that either you<br />
take lightly or discard lightly.<br />
MURPHY: Alright, if that honour continues after March<br />
24, that would mean then that you'd be looking at an<br />
election in ' 93 or perhaps even ' 92. How long would you<br />
expect Mr Keating to stick around if that's the scenario?<br />
PM: Mr Keating is a man of great dedication and he's a<br />
man greatly misunderstood. He is a man who is an<br />
outstandingly capable Treasurer in the macro-economic<br />
sense and in terms of thinking of micro-economic reform.<br />
But he's also a Labor Treasurer in the great Labor<br />
tradition. I would just love some of the commentators to<br />
be able to sit in on some of the Cabinet meetings and the<br />
Expenditure Review Committee meetings where we are<br />
dealing with the issue of the least privileged in the<br />
community. Brian Howe, the outstanding Minister for<br />
Social Security, has no greater supporter amongst the<br />
other Ministers than he does in Paul Keating. Now this<br />
man is a person who obviously, if he'd wanted to pursue<br />
his own personal ambition and his own personal<br />
S aggrandizement, could easily have done that at any time,<br />
but he hasn't. He hasn't done that because he's got a<br />
vision about, he's got a depth of commitment and love for<br />
this country and a vision about how we can make it a<br />
better, stronger, more competitive country. And I think<br />
it's those considerations which will determine Paul's<br />
continuing commitment.<br />
MURPHY: Prime Minister, you just said though that he's<br />
misunderstood. Why is that though?<br />
PM: I think, well, it's fairly easy, historically I<br />
mean Paul is not the first Treasurer of this country to<br />
be easily miscast. It's very very easy to miscast<br />
Treasurers because when decisions have to be taken in the<br />
fiscal area that are a bit tough, well the Treasurer is<br />
easily painted as Mr Scrooge. It was always<br />
historically, I mean you go back over all your<br />
Treasurers, go back to the post-war period, Arthur Fadden </p>
<p>7<br />
and so on, the whole lot of them, they were always the<br />
easy butt. Paul of course is reasonably direct in the<br />
things he says. He can say things directly which may,<br />
again, easily lead people to paint him in not the most<br />
congenial of<br />
MURPHY: Right<br />
PM: But all I'm saying is that I know Keating well.<br />
He's my friend as well as my colleague. I know that he<br />
is amongst the most compassionate of Ministers that has<br />
ever been in a Federal Cabinet.<br />
MURPHY: And happy to stay where he is?<br />
PM: He, as I've said, has got the legitimate ambition at<br />
some stage to be Prime Minister of this country. That's<br />
a legitimate aspiration. But Paul Keating and Bob Hawke<br />
have never worked more closely together than they have<br />
been over recent times, and are now, and will through the<br />
life of the fourth Hawke Labor Government.<br />
MURPHY: And if you do get that fourth Labor Government<br />
Paul Keating will be waiting a long time to realise any<br />
ambition, any further ambition he's got?<br />
PM: Yes, but remember, Paul Keating went into Parliament<br />
very very early. He's one of the longest serving Members<br />
of Parliament, but still a relatively young, fit,<br />
intellectually able young man. And would, on that<br />
timetable that you're talking about, come to the Prime<br />
Ministership at, I would've thought, less, significantly<br />
less than the average age that people have become Prime<br />
Minister in the past.<br />
MURPHY: You've just annointed him.<br />
PM: No, I haven't. I've answered your questions. I've<br />
always said that the Caucus makes the decision, the<br />
Caucus makes the decision. But I'm responding honestly<br />
and directly to your questions.<br />
ends </p>
