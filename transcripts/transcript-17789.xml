The Federal Government today announced the new membership of the Australian National Council on Drugs (ANCD).</p>
<p>Prime Minister Julia Gillard welcomed the addition of several new members to the ANCD who will bring fresh perspectives on ways to reduce harm caused by drug and alcohol misuse.</p>
<p>They will join a number of experienced members of the ANCD - which will continue to be chaired by Dr John Herron.</p>
<p>The ANCD has played a crucial role as the Australian Government's principal advisory body on drug and alcohol misuse since its establishment in 1998.</p>
<p>Members of the ANCD come from a wide variety of backgrounds and have experience in areas covering law enforcement, the health and social welfare sectors and the community sector.</p>
<p>The ANCD brings a broad, whole-of-society perspective to drug and alcohol issues.</p>
<p>It has helped inform the development of several Government strategies and campaigns which have succeeded in reducing the rate of drug and alcohol misuse.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister said ANCD members, past and present, have made a valuable contribution in tackling the issues behind drug and alcohol misuse.</p>
<p>The Council's membership will next be reviewed in 2014. </p>
