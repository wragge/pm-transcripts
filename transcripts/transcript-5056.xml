PRM ONSE<br />
FOR MEDIA 3 JUNE 1979<br />
ELECTORATE TALK<br />
over the last few months, industries in New South Wales have<br />
been disrupted and threatened because of the actions of a<br />
group of refinery workers at Kurnell.<br />
Although they are part of a national industry, they have acted<br />
to try and get more money for themselves under a State award.<br />
They have refused to accept the ruling of the Conciliation and<br />
Arbitration Commission that they had to work under the Federal<br />
Award. They have set out to deliberately defy the Commission the<br />
independent umpire.<br />
In this they have been adided and supported by the New South Wales<br />
government. That is irresponsible government.<br />
By such support, the government of that State has contributed<br />
directly to the prolonging of that dispute. It has caused the<br />
people of New South Wales needless hardship and inconvenience.<br />
The men at Kurnell members of the State branch of the Australian<br />
Workers Union, which operates separately from the Federal body<br />
which covers the rest of the industry in the State don't care<br />
about disruption or hardship.<br />
They don't care about extra money they think they can squeeze<br />
from another award. Their motives are purely selfish.<br />
But what are the motives of the New South Wales government in<br />
supporting them? Just what will the people of New South Wales<br />
gain from their gove'rnment supporting this-kind of tactic?<br />
The answer is obscure. Maybe Mr Wran will let his constituents<br />
into his ~ secret.<br />
The oil industry is a vital and sensitive one. Surely Mr Wran<br />
could see that his government's actions were going to lead to<br />
damage in this sensitive area.<br />
Because of the national implications of this kind of action,<br />
I have been in touch with Mr Wran to make the point that his / 2 </p>

government has a responsibility to uphold the decision of the<br />
Full Bench of the Council of the Arbitration Commission.<br />
The New South Wales Government has a clear obligation to<br />
convince the men that they should abide by the decisions of<br />
the Commission to continue to work under the Federal award.<br />
Regrettably, I'm afraid, much of the present industrial unrest<br />
in New South Wales stems from the State government's decision<br />
to legislate for a 37 hour week in the power industry.<br />
It was predictable that that irresponsible decision was bound<br />
to unleash a number of other claims outside of indexation.<br />
Naturally, the unions believed that if the State government was<br />
prepared to support one group, it should also support another.<br />
We can now see the folly of the power industry decision.<br />
All governments have a responsibility to accept the decisions<br />
of arbitral tribunals. No government can afford to get into<br />
the business of encouraging groups of trade unionists to reject<br />
the industrial relations framework that has grown up in<br />
Australia over the last 75 years.<br />
As a large employer, the Federal Government is attempting to lead<br />
by example. Where wage claims and other claims are being<br />
pressed by unions with ba * ns and strikes and other actions, our<br />
policy is clear, and it is fair. Refusal to work means no pay.<br />
I cannot put it any more clearly, any more bluntly.<br />
we have been advising employers in industry to make the same<br />
stand. If a settlement is made outside the guidelines, we have made<br />
it clear that the Governemnt will instruct the Prices Justification<br />
Tribunal.* to carry out an immediate inquiry into the industry.<br />
So employers have responsibilities also.<br />
This whole question of strikeing and causing disruption in the<br />
face of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission gets to the<br />
heart of the issue.<br />
What's in it for the union to go out on strike? Loss of wages<br />
and harmi to the community.<br />
There seemns to be a myth that the Conciliati-on and Arbitration<br />
Commnission, will not hear the workers' case until it gets headlines<br />
in the pr~ ss because of strike action.<br />
That is absolute nonsense. The Commission looks at the merits<br />
of a case and the merits alone. A strike is not part of that<br />
process. </p>
<p>3<br />
There is no need for such strike action. No one wins.<br />
Just ask the families and children during the recent milk<br />
tanker drivers' strike when they were denied milk supplies.<br />
The Federal Government is using all the powers that it has<br />
to make all parties work within the system and abide by<br />
the decision of the umpire.<br />
And that is why we are seriously concerned and disappointed<br />
by the action of the New South Wales government in supporting<br />
a group of men who have set out to defy the Arbitration system.<br />
This kind of action, this kind of support from a State<br />
government, is simply not in the interusts of the people<br />
of New South Wales. It is not in the interest of the people<br />
of Australia. 000---</p>
