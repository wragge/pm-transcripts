VISIT TO SOUTH EAST ASIA 1968<br />
NUL DAT<br />
ADDRESS BY THE PRIME MINISTER, MR. JOHN GORTON,<br />
TO AUSTRALIAN TROOPS 8 JUNE 1968<br />
There are perhaps one or two things I would like to say to you<br />
and say to you as representatives of all the people in this camp and of all the<br />
Australians in Vietnam who aren't here to say to you what I would like to say<br />
to all of them. I have only been able to meet a few this morning and they are<br />
individuals and a few from each unit. But what can be said to one can be said<br />
to all and that is that I regard it as an honour to have the opportunity to be here<br />
to see you, to have had the chance vicariously through you to talk to all my<br />
countrymen here. I think you are doing a magnificent job for our own country,<br />
and though you may be far away from it, I feel the results will be felt in our<br />
own country for decades to come.<br />
I suppose sometimes, because of some of the activity that goes<br />
on home, you may feel that the vast majority of Australians are not thoroughly<br />
behind you because the newspapers tend to give publicity to any nut who carries<br />
a placard or sits in the middle of a road rather than to the hundred citizens,<br />
for each one who does that, who are thoroughly behind you4 Please believe<br />
that your Government is behind you and ninety per cent of the Australian people<br />
are behind you in what you are trying to do. I would like to congratulate you<br />
once more on the way that you are doing it.<br />
That is really all that I have got to say to you. I don't think<br />
that there is anything to add, except to repeat and to put it in a capsule, it is<br />
an honour to meet men doing the job they have to do as well as you are doing<br />
it. And it's an encouragempent to meet men doing a job which is of such<br />
importance to their nation now and in the future.<br />
You will have heard talk of things that are called peace talks<br />
in Paris. They aren't peace talks. They are preliminary talks to see whether<br />
there is any basis for a chance to have talks later. And you will be interested<br />
to know, those of you who are here and have been here for some time, that,<br />
so far it has been quite impossible to persuade the North Vietnamese negotiators<br />
to admit that there are any North Vietnamese troops in South Vietnam at all.<br />
I daresay that you would be able to correct them on that if you could get over<br />
there, but that is the stage it has reached so far. Now I wouldn't build too<br />
many hopes too quickly on that. The hopes are to complete the job, to finish<br />
the job and to give the South Vietnamese people a chance to elect their own<br />
Government, and to demonstrate that aggression by force does not pay. This<br />
you are doing. Thank you for it. I wish I could have met you all. </p>
