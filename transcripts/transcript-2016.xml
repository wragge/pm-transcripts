FOR PRESS PM. No. 28/ 1969 ( A)<br />
NEW ROADS AGREEMENT<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr John Gorton<br />
During the five years ending on 30 June this year, the<br />
Commonwealth Government has provided $ 750 million towards the costs of<br />
roads in the States. During the five years beginning on I July this year, the<br />
Commonwealth Government proposes to provide 252 million towards<br />
these costs. The increase will be over half a billion dollars or 67 per cent.<br />
The money will be divided amongst the States by a new<br />
formula. That is, the 200 million will first be divided according to<br />
the existing formula of one-third-area, one -third-population, and one-thirdmotor<br />
vehicle registration. The 200 million will then be divided by<br />
the scheduling formula suggested by the Bureau of Roads Report. The<br />
allocation for each State will be the mean of the two amounts so obtained.<br />
This is because adopting the scheduling formula in toto<br />
would unduly disrupt the existing pattern of road expenditure and because<br />
of the operational and other problems that drastic, rapid change could<br />
create. This proposal, if it were left at that, would lead to South<br />
Australia, West Australia, and Tasmania receiving inadequate increases<br />
during the next five years.<br />
Therefore a further $ 52 million is to be provided for those<br />
States, thus ensuring that no State will receive an increase less than<br />
per cent of the amount received in the last five years.<br />
As a result of these proposals, the amounts of money will<br />
be divided amongst the various States as shown below<br />

<p>The Commonwealth proposes that the money<br />
from the principal grant available to each State will be<br />
made in three sepDarate grants<br />
One is to be spent on urban roads<br />
One is to be spent on maintrunk and arterial roads<br />
One is to be spent on other rural roads<br />
Out of the basic grant to each State 1.5% is to be allocated<br />
to planning and research.<br />
The sum to be allotted to urban roads throughout<br />
Australia, during the five year period, is to be '. W: 600.69 million.<br />
This is for construction and reconstruction of<br />
the cities' major traffic arteries, the throughways,<br />
expressways, traffic interchanges, and other types of urban<br />
road systems. It is not for ordinary street systems.<br />
The sum to be allotted to national trunk roads<br />
will be S186.76 million.<br />
This is for the construction and reconstruction<br />
of such roads. These are the roads outside the cities which<br />
provide for long distance movement of traffic, the highways<br />
that join the principal centres of population.<br />
The sum to be allotted for " other rural roads"<br />
will be ' 4394.55 million.<br />
This is for construction, reconstruction and<br />
maintenance of these roads.<br />
The tables below show the amounts each State<br />
will receive for each of the three categories of roads.<br />

These supplementary grants can be spent on any category of<br />
road according to the decisions of the State Government<br />
receiving them.<br />
Each State will be required to increase their expenditure<br />
on roads from its own resources at a rate no less than the<br />
rate of increase in motor vehicle registrations in that State.<br />
