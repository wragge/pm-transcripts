PRIME MINISTER<br />
14 August 1996 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON JOHN HOWARD, MP<br />
RADIO 2UE WITH ALAN JONES<br />
E O E<br />
JONES: Less than a week away from a Federal Budget. A lot on his plate, Prime Minister Howard<br />
is with me. Good Morning.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Good morning Alan. It's always good to be here.<br />
JONES: Thank you for your time. Just, since I was actually doing a little commercial for the<br />
registered clubs this wasn't on the agenda, are you going to put them within the tax<br />
structure? I read the other day..<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I was amazed to read the other day that the Government was considering taxing clubs.<br />
Can I tell you Alan it hasn't even been considered. It has been a season for pre-budget<br />
speculation. I don't normally respond to the wilder of the pieces of pre-budget<br />
speculation but that one, which had quite a big run in one of the weekend papers, really is<br />
deserving of comnment because it's an issue that has not even been on the table.<br />
JONES: Okay, so take a good look at your club it will still be there in the same state next year. </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I reckon they'll still be there, yes.<br />
JONES: At your first press conference on 4 March this year you said your priorities were and you<br />
listed four small business policies, industrial relations reform, youth unemployment and<br />
consulting community groups.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yes. JONES: Can you boast achievements on those fronts, small business policies?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I can certainly, in relation to small business policy we've already cut the provisional tax<br />
from eight per cent to six per cent, that's for small business. We've already cut by 20 per<br />
cent the number of forms they have to fill out for the Australian Bureau of Statistics and<br />
there'll be more coming on that front when I get the results of the task force headed by the<br />
boss of McDonalds foods who's telling us how to cut paperwork for small business by<br />
per cent over three years. If the Senate had done its job I would have already abolished<br />
the unfair dismissal laws and reformed the industrial relations system..<br />
JONES: It's hard for people to cope with that, isn't it, that they elected you in March and unfair<br />
dismissal laws were absolutely central to it<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Even Paul Keating said in the dying days of the election campaign that something had to<br />
be done about the unfair dismissal law. Now it is part of our Industrial Relations<br />
Legislation and I hope that that industrial relations legislation will pass.<br />
JONES: I had a caller yesterday who said, of course, that you could have passed it by pulling it out<br />
of the Industrial Relations package.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p>Yes, but why should we be told by the minor parties how to run our legislative<br />
programnme. Now I'm talking to Cheryl Kernot tomorrow. I'm not going to engage in<br />
some kind of on air rhetorical exchange with her. I want to have a sensible discussion to<br />
try and isolate areas where they'll vote for our legislation and areas where they won't..<br />
JONES: She got ten per cent of the vote. Has she got too much clout for ten per cent?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, look the reality Alan is that no matter what percentage she or any body else got, to<br />
get legislation through the Senate I need 39 votes.<br />
JONES: You're two short.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I'm two short, I've only got 37 even though 54 per cent of the Australian people voted for<br />
us we only have 37 in the Senate. If I want get my programme through..<br />
JONES: Is that good for demnocracy or not? Paul Keating called them ' unrepresentative swill'.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well Alan, whether it is good, bad or indifferent..<br />
JONES: It's reality.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
It's a reality and I'm a realist and the Australian people elected me to do a job. Part of<br />
doing that job is cooperating with the minor parties, talking to them, listening to them,<br />
disagreeing with them where we disagree but at the end of the day the Australian people<br />
say, " Howard you're the Prime Minister it's your job to try and get your programme<br />
through". Now, I will along the way point out where I'm being obstructed, but equally I<br />
accept that these other parties.. </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, I'm not going to compromise on things that are fundamental..<br />
JONES: IdUn Chipp resigned from the Democrats..<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I know that.<br />
JON ES:<br />
and she spoke on this programme the day before, yesterday, and she said the reason she<br />
resigned was that their standard variant slogan was to keep people honest.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
That's right.<br />
JONES: And she said therefore the Democrats should be making sure that you introduce the<br />
policies. PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, I mean it would be a defiance of everything that the Democrats have said they stood<br />
for if they end Lip rejecting things that we promised people we would do. I mean I can<br />
understand.. JONES: And elected to keep you honest.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well exactly, but look Alan, at the end of the day no matter what I think, you think, Idun<br />
Chipp thinks or any body else thinks at the end of the day I've got to get votes in the<br />
Senate to get legislation through. I just want the Australian public and I particularly want<br />
small business men and women to understand that I have been trying since the second of<br />
March to reform the Industrial Relations law, to give them the air in which to breath they<br />
need in relation to unfair dismissal, paperwork burden, being able to make effective<br />
workplace contracts without the unions.. having unions thrust down their throats where </p>
<p>nobody wants unions. Now I'm saying to those people I'm trying to get that legislation<br />
through and at the end of the day if I can enlist the cooperation of two more people in the<br />
Senate it can become a reality and I am hopeful that it will become a reality.<br />
JONES: Youth unemployment?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, youth unemployment is very intimately tied to getting small business going again.<br />
Forget the idea that you can abolish youth unemployment by bureaucratic intervention.<br />
The only way you'll get rid of youth unemployment is to get small business going again<br />
because small business generates the jobs, small business gives people a start in life, small<br />
business gives young people<br />
JONES: But you've got EPAC and a whole Cabinet telling you to reduce tariffs on the motor<br />
vehicle industry to zero and that's going to throw the motor vehicle industry out of<br />
operation. I mean, tariffs in Singapore and Indonesia and Korea are up to 200 per cent.<br />
How does that help people get jobs?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, that's an argument that we're going to have over the next few years but we are not<br />
reducing tariffs for the motor vehicle industry to zero. What we are doing is keeping the<br />
existing tariff structure which maintains a tariff until the Year 2000. So I make it very<br />
clear to the motor vehicle industry there's no change for the next four years. We're<br />
having an inquiry as to what we do after that. That inquiry includes, will include input<br />
fiom the motor vehicle industry and all of those arguments are going to be obsessed but<br />
I'm not going to get swept along with some kind of theoretical view of industry<br />
JONES: No, but I'm just saying to you last year automotive inputs were up by 19 per cent. Now<br />
once upon a time you had an imported quotient of, say, 35 per cent of passenger vehicles.<br />
Nearly all of our commercial vehicles are now from overseas, that adds to your debt. And<br />
now over 50 per cent of passenger vehicles. So on one hand you're trying to guarantee<br />
jobs. On the other hand you're trying to retain or restrain the level of imported debt and<br />
yet you've got this push within your Cabinet and both sides of politics to say we'll knock<br />
off the motor vehicle industry. </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well nobody's going to knock off the motor vehicle industry, I'm not.<br />
JONES: doing a pretty good job to date.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well part of that, of course, has been due to the uncompetitive character of the Australian<br />
economy caused in no small measure by a rigid industrial relations..<br />
JONES: But I mnean you try and sell a motor vehicle to Malaysia or to Korea or to China. Hey,<br />
they won't be saying 15 per cent tariff. They'll have tariffs or tariff equivalents of up to<br />
100 per cent.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
In relation to motor vehicles that is true. In relation to some other extra items it is not<br />
true and there are benefits for this country in not having too rigid a system of industry<br />
protection. There are gives and takes when it comes to industry protection. I'm a<br />
pragmatist. I'm quite happy to see freer trade in Australia provided the rest of the world<br />
practises freer trade. It's<br />
JONES: We shouldn't be playing with 13 in the team when the others have got<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
There's got to be a give and a take. If we give up something, we are entitled to say to the<br />
recipient of that give uIP, well what are we getting in return. But if all of us can keep<br />
pushing towards a freer system then we will all be the beneficiaries.<br />
JONES: Well, they'll be ahead of the pace too otherwise we're going to lose significantly.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, we've got to be sensible about it and we want to look after our own interests. </p>
<p>JONES: Okay. 1.8 billion dollars you're going to save in education cuts in higher education. What<br />
is the philosophy...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well that incidentally, that figure sounds wildly inflated I know all the commentators are<br />
using it but that's over a period of three or four years. I mean we're talking...<br />
JONES: What is the philosophy behind that just to get a bottom line better?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No. JONES: Or how then do we encourage?<br />
PRIME MINISTIER:<br />
No. JONES: I'm just wondering whether there shouldn't be a component of people. When you went to<br />
university there were people who actually went for nothing because they made it to being<br />
the best. Shouldn't we actually have, as we have with our athletes on an Olympic day<br />
it's good to talk about this where at the top of the tree those who've qualified on marks<br />
and showed themnselves to be the intellectual elite, should they be given a kick along and<br />
say, listen, you go for nothing?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, what we are doing is introducing, as well as the changes to HECs, we're introducing<br />
4,000 special scholarships a year that are going to be...<br />
JONES: That's across Australia?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No, no, no, but it's a start. And bear in mind that we...<br />
JON ES:<br />
Is that for the good people intellectually or the disadvantaged economically?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, they will be awarded on merit according to need criteria by the university. So it will<br />
be a mixture. It will mean that very bright children who come from very poor<br />
circumstances will be the principal beneficiaries...<br />
JONES: We do want to encourage engineers and scientists don't we?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, if we want to encourage all people of excellence we've also got to understand that<br />
when you've got an economic problem every sector has got to make a contribution<br />
according to its capacity and what we are saying...<br />
JONES: We don't ask Kieren to pay $ 14,000 do we? We don't ask Kieren Perkins and nor should<br />
we. Why don't we ask the Keiren Perkins equivalent in engineering and science and so<br />
on, to say well listen, because you're so outstanding and have proven it on the results we<br />
have an obligation nationally to sponsor you?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well Alan, part of that provision of scholarships will accommodate that. Now, it's only a<br />
modest start but bear in mind that the HECS charge does not accrue, does not start, until<br />
you've left university. In other words you don't pay anything...<br />
JONES: I don't think anyone has much of a problem with that, I might add.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I mean, you don't pay anything until you've gone through university and the weakness of<br />
completely free universities... </p>
<p>JONES: I don't think anyone's argued that.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Exactly. JONES: No one's arguing that. No one's arguing. I'm certainly not arguing that.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, a lot of my political opponents are arguing this.<br />
JONES: Yeah, I'm certainly not arguing that and I think...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, I think it's important for people to understand that many of the...<br />
JONES: They've heard me a thousand times on that...<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
that the taxes of working class give no aspirations...<br />
JONES: ( inaudible) middle class welfare.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Exactly, and I don't think it is unreasonable to say to the middle class, you've got to make<br />
a contribution towards it and that is what we're... it's a contribution. We're not<br />
saying... I'm only saying the only contribution...<br />
JONES: </p>
<p>JONES: That's it, for the really bright and say to them, listen, put the light on at night and don't<br />
turn it off because...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well have made a start on that and it's a start down the right path.<br />
JONES: Well, let's now take the start on the middle class welfare issue child care.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yes.<br />
JONES: 2.4 billion dollars a year the Government is spending on child care, one way or another,<br />
2.4 billion. The bulk of the kids, 855 000 1 think the figure is, under the age of four are<br />
still at home being looked after by their mum who make that choice, they get nothing.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, they'll get a lot more after Tuesday night.<br />
JONES: What are they going to get?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, they're going to get our family tax package in full. And what that will do is<br />
recognise, to a much greater extent, the financial sacrifice made by mothers or fathers who<br />
stay at home full time to look after their children rather than putting them into child care.<br />
JONES: In a very important time of their life.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p>At a very important time. Now, I think in the past the tax system has been miserly, miserly<br />
in the way in which it has recognised that decision and that contribution and we are<br />
making a start through our family tax package for people under $ 70,000 a year income.<br />
JONES: If you look after your kids at home it costs the tax payer nothing, it costs the parents<br />
plenty doesn't it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I beg your pardon?<br />
JONES: If you look after your kids at home it costs the tax payer nothing, but it costs the parents<br />
plenty. PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, they give up a second income and this is often forgotten by people who sort of<br />
deride the contribution of people who are full time child carers for their own kids, that<br />
they actually give up a second income.<br />
JONES: Just on the rural question okay, middle class welfare, I'll just take one forward does<br />
that apply then to health care? I mean, you're saying that in education they should make a<br />
contribution. Should people of mean, should you and I, even have an opportunity to get a<br />
health care for nothing?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, we don't get it for nothing.<br />
JONES: Well, we pay a little...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, we pay the medicare levy and I have private health insurance and that is not a<br />
piddling amount. It's 2,000 plus dollars a year. We're going to bring in a tax rebate, not<br />
for somebody on my income but for people 70,000 dollars a year and below, they will be... </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
There'll be a tax rebate. We announced it in the election campaign and it's going to be<br />
implemented in full as promised, as promised, on the very day in the budget.<br />
JONES: The rural community. You did the Diesel Fuel Rebate yesterday.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yes. JONES: We won't go into that because I said earlier this morning, a quite proper move by the<br />
Government and...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
When you bear in mind the low income of many farmers...<br />
JONES: And the tremendous contribution mining and agriculture makes to the economy.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
export income, the idea that it's some kind of welfare handout I mean if we had<br />
knocked off the Diesel Fuel Rebate we would have been adding directly to the input costs<br />
of the farming and mining industry.<br />
JONES: Well it could have cost us money productively.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
EnormouIsly. JONES: The rural community though, you have said a million times, pastoral leases extinguish<br />
native title. 73 per cent of Queensland and a lot of New South Wales are under pastoral<br />
lease can they trust the Government? You said you want to be a man who's regarded as<br />
having his word as his bond. You've said pastoral leases extinguish native title do they? </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
The High Court of Australia, which is the final arbiter of this, is deciding this right at the<br />
very moment in the Wik case and I hope to have a decision, or I hope there will be a<br />
decision by the High Court of Australia very soon in relation to that appeal. It was heard<br />
about five or six weeks ago.<br />
JONES: And if not? Because John Howard said pastoral lease...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well if not, if the High Court of Australia brings down a decision which is different from<br />
what had been the previous understanding of the law, naturally I will accept that decision<br />
as an interpretation of the law as it know stands because I'm bound as you are by the<br />
decision of the Court.<br />
JONES: But you can make laws.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well of course. We will consider our position when the High Court has brought down the<br />
decision. I'm not going to say any more than that because I respect the role of the courts<br />
in our system. But I can say to your listeners that we're waiting on that decision, we have<br />
an interest in it. I think the whole community, the Aboriginal community, the mining<br />
industry and thle pastor industry all have an interest in it. We all want certainty, but the<br />
Court is the pinnacle of our judicial system. I respect it. I might, as an individual,<br />
disagree with some decisions as you do. But it's got an authoritative role in our system<br />
and I'm not going to say anything that in any way pre-empts the role of the courts,<br />
particularly when it's heard an application and heard submissions on a particular case.<br />
JONES: Prime Minister, given the political cycle three years, and it's far too short this budget is<br />
so, so, critical to you isn't it, because the tough decisions have to be taken next week or<br />
not at all? You've got a problem of debt, you've got a problem of unemployment.<br />
You've said:-nothing I place in higher store than keeping faith with the Australian people.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
That's right. </p>
<p>JONES: Can you turn this debt thing around? The current account debt and the budget debt?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
We can, we can over time. We will make anl enormous contribution next Tuesday night.<br />
JONES: So what sort of budget will it be?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, it will be a strong fair budget.<br />
JONES: Tou~ gh?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Strong and fair. I think strong is a better word. Strong in the sense that it will do the job,<br />
it will tackle the problem, it will pay off Labor's bankcard.<br />
JONES: Thle battler out there what do you say to the battler, what will the battler be saying after<br />
the budget?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, the battler will be saying; Howard kept his faith and his commitments in relation to<br />
the families;, Howard tackled the problem, he did the job; he shared what pain had to be<br />
doled out, he shared it around.<br />
JONES: And will there be a few people on a quid saying, well it's fair enough what Howard's<br />
done, lie's making LIS pay a bit more?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, look, nobody can.,. there won't be a take-out from next Tuesday night that we have<br />
punished the poor or been unfair on vulnerable sections of the community. I will be able </p>
<p>to look every interest group in the country in the eye on Wednesday morning and say you<br />
may not like everything in the budget but it is fair, it is defensible and most importantly, it<br />
has done the job for Australia.<br />
JONES: Just one final thing. 137,000 public servants you've got down there. Have you got about<br />
136,999 too many?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well Alan, I didn't think I'd escape your programme with.. look, I am a private sector<br />
man in the sense that I see the growth coming in the private sector. On the other hand<br />
there are a lot of public servants in this country who are hard working and conscientious,<br />
but they, like everybody else, have to make a contribution to fixing the problem for<br />
Australia. JONES: Good to talk to you and all the best to your wife.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Thank you very much Alan. ,/ y </p>
