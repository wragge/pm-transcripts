TEXT OF AN ADDRESS MADE BY-THE PRIME MINISTER AT THE TASMANIAN<br />
STATE COUNCIL<br />
I am delighted to be back here in Launceston, in the Bass<br />
electorate, to address this Tasmanian State Council.<br />
On 28 June last year Launceston and Bass gave the lead to<br />
Australia. In the Bass By-election the voters gave Kevin Newman a<br />
resounding victory. They returned a most able and effective<br />
advocate for Commonwealth and Tasmanian affairs. He has a<br />
difficult, challenging and important task, and one which he<br />
is undertaking with great skill and tenacity.<br />
In the Bass election the Liberal Party made a number of firm<br />
commitments to help the development of Tasmania. Those<br />
commitments have been honoured.<br />
We undertook to introduce full freight equalisation for Tasmania<br />
in the light of the Nimmo Report. The scheme we announced<br />
which has been in operation since 1 July 1976 goes beyond<br />
the Nimmo recommendations. It is designed to provide that the<br />
cost of transporting goods between Tasmania and the mainland is<br />
approximately the same as moving goods by land a similar distance.<br />
We will in addition be introducing a scheme for the southbound<br />
shipment of producer's material and equipment.<br />
The Labor Party promised action on freight equalisation for<br />
three years. We have introduced a major scheme in our first<br />
year in Government. As a result of the scheme, AN1L has<br />
announced new schedules and an increase in its carrying capacity<br />
to cope with the expected growth of traffic to and from Tasmania.<br />
Tasmania has directly benefited in other ways from the change<br />
of Government. The new federal financial arrangements will<br />
bring some $ 4.7 million more to Tasmania than the old scheme.<br />
We undertook to establish a Maritime College in Launceston.<br />
Legislation has now been passed and funds made available.<br />
The Advisory Council on inter-governmental relations will be<br />
established in Hobart. We have also been actively aware of the<br />
needs of the citizens of Hobart following the bridge disaster.<br />
So far some $ 24 million has been spent by the Commonwealtias a<br />
result of the disaster. In the current financial year, th / 2 </p>
<p>Commonwealth will be making available an additional $ 16 million.<br />
We will also be funding investigations into the design of a<br />
second permanent crossing at a cost of about $ 650,000.<br />
Since the election last-December, the period of neglect of<br />
Tasmania has come to an end. Bass gave the lead and the<br />
rest of Australia followed that lead last December. That<br />
decision of the Australian people placed an enormous responsibility<br />
on the Liberal Party both Federal and State.<br />
For three years, the Labor Party had tried to impose its<br />
socialist philosophy of government domination and centralised<br />
power on Australia. As a result it was getting more and more<br />
difficult to find a job: prices were rising constantly: taxes<br />
getting higher and higher: Government and bureaucracy growing<br />
bigger and bigger. Socialist incompetence and weekly scandals<br />
were ruining Australia. It was obvious that Australia needed<br />
a profound change of direction.<br />
Australia needed a Government which believed that people<br />
deserved incentives to achieve their best in all areas of<br />
life; which would encourage productive private enterprise to<br />
provide jobs; which would give genuine assistance to the<br />
disadvantaged; which would protect people against ever-rising<br />
taxes; which would govern not by dogma but by consultation.<br />
Australia needed a government which would reverse the drift<br />
of power to Canberra; which would take notice of the needs of<br />
those areas neglected by Labor.<br />
Above all, we undertook to give Australia a government which<br />
respected the right of people to build their own lives without<br />
being told what to do by a few people who claimed to know<br />
what was good for everyone.<br />
Our programme to restore a freer and more decent life for all<br />
Australians was not one that could be implemented overnight.<br />
We anticipated a " long and difficult" path towards full economic<br />
recovery after the devastation of three years of Labor.<br />
We did state our determination, during our first term of office,<br />
to establish the right conditions for stable, continuing<br />
growth.<br />
A number of crucial steps had to be taken to establish these<br />
conditions. Government spending had to be brought under control to free<br />
resources to individuals and private enterprise.<br />
Wage and salary restraint was necessary to allow business<br />
to expand and create jobs.<br />
Growth in the money supply had to be held back.<br />
The fundamentals of this policy have now been set. ./ 3 </p>
<p>ve-unciertook to control Government spending. Wle have<br />
already announced $ 2,600 million savings on the forward<br />
estimates for this financial year.<br />
We undertook to control the growth of the money supply,<br />
and we have done so.<br />
We undertook to work for wage restraint. The Conciliation<br />
and Arbitration Commission has acknowledged by its-recent<br />
decisions within its wage indexation guidelines the<br />
force of the Commonwealth's submission for-less than full<br />
wage indexation in the current and prospective economic<br />
conditions. The budget next Tuesday will be a further step in generating<br />
greater confidence.<br />
I n the election last December, we undertook to introduce<br />
specific measures to encourage business to expand once more.<br />
We introduced an investment allowance which has already begun<br />
to stimulate activity.<br />
We undertook to end the effect of inflation in increasing the<br />
tax burden. We committed ourselves to introduce the M4athews<br />
Coamittee tax indexation reforms over three years. We have<br />
already gone far beyond our commitments in this vital area.<br />
From 1 July personal income taxes have been fully indexed for<br />
inflation.<br />
This is' a reform of historic importance which will end forever in<br />
Australia the unlegislated increases in taxation % 4hich the<br />
Labor Party used so disastrously to'fund -its own-, extravagant<br />
programmes at your expense. From now on, ifA governments want<br />
to increase taxes they will have-to pass legislation. People<br />
can now have absolute confidence that the secret tax rip-off<br />
from inflation has ended.<br />
There is growing evidence that the Government's policies are<br />
working: business spending on plant and equipment has picked up<br />
substantially; stocks are being built up again; retail sales are<br />
improving; motor vehicle sales are high -one company has recently<br />
announced a further $ 71 million expansion; other major new projects<br />
have recently been announced; the stock market is moving strongly;<br />
exports are exceptionally good; national production measured by<br />
gross domestic product is now rising instead of falling,<br />
There are still problems: inflation, while less, is still too<br />
high; there is still room for greater consumer spending; unemployment<br />
is still too high.<br />
Lat m aefwmests onteuesmtapiltocyamtoegnitu hb turtan. The40,0<br />
laet maeafwcmetonteuemployment siaitcatouhmc etrtain the40,0<br />
unemployed labor predicted would bp-a consequence of their policies,<br />
are still of great concern to this government.<br />
There are however some heartening signs which should not be<br />
overlooked. Available inforation shows that numboers employed<br />
have grown since December, largely in the private sector. ' Many<br />
people are concerned about unemployment among young people. While<br />
there are indeed grounds for concern, the position is better than<br />
some people think all but 16,000 of the 230,000 young people who<br />
left school last year had been employed by the end of June this year.<br />
In judging the implications of the unemp loyment figures, we have<br />
to remember that the real rate of unemployment this time last year<br />
was diguised by the R. E. D. scheme which involved 30,000 people.<br />
Even the Labor Government realised this approach was ineffective in<br />
providing a real solution to the unemployment problem and abandoned<br />
it. Taking that in account, unemployment was worse last year than<br />
this year. / 4A </p>
<p>Unfortunately, substantial reductions in unemployment always lag<br />
in the early stages of recovery. A reduction in the number of job<br />
seekers is never one of the early signs of economic recovery.<br />
Initially, increased production is always generated mainly by a<br />
more intensive use of existing labour.<br />
What does tend to increase first is overtime, and overtime has in<br />
fact risen over sixty percent from last June to this June.<br />
Not until existing capacity, of both men and machines, has picked<br />
up does the demand for unemployed labour strengthen.<br />
There is another factor also to take into account as job<br />
opportunities expand more people tend to come into the workforce<br />
in expectation of finding work. This in turn can lead to the<br />
number of people in jobs and the number out of work rising at the<br />
same time. For example: in America where recovery has gone much<br />
further than in Australia, unemployment increased in-June and July.<br />
This occurred because strong growth in employment in those-months<br />
was more than matched by growth in the workforce.<br />
Wage restraint is a prerequisite for maintaining the expansion of<br />
job opportunities. In the two years, 1974 and 1975, the level of<br />
real wages rose by an amount equal to six years' normal growth in<br />
productivity. Wage increases have also adversely affected our<br />
international competitiveness over the last five years the<br />
United States rates of earnings have increased by twenty-four percent.<br />
Australia's have increased by a frightening eighty-three percent.<br />
The resulting depressed share of national income g oing to businesses<br />
halted investment and destroyed jobs. That is why we have argued<br />
as we have in all three quarterly wage cases since we came to office.<br />
Those who argue for undue wage increases at present are, whether<br />
knowingly or not, advocating an increase in unemployment.' Every wage<br />
increase granted today means that the chance of creating a new Job<br />
tomorrow is diminished.<br />
The New South Wales Premier would do well to remember this when he<br />
argues for maximum increases in wages on the one hand, and for more<br />
jobs on the other. It should be remembered that since the election<br />
there, New South Wales which has only thirty-six percent of the<br />
Australian labour force, has accounted for sixty-four percent of<br />
the increase in Australia's unemployment. Of the 33,000 people who<br />
have become unemployed in the last three months, 21,000 are in<br />
New South Wales.<br />
If the N. S. W. Government intends to act to improve the employment<br />
situation, it should be discarding the socialist " dream"' policies<br />
that Mr Whitlam. pursued policies which created an economic<br />
nightmare. The New South Wales Premier should be more consistent:<br />
he says that there should be wage restraint, then argues for maximum<br />
increases in wages.<br />
We all have responsibilities in overcoming inflation. Trade Unions<br />
have a particular responsibility in the reduction of inflation and<br />
the creation of jobs. Union leaders who sanction political strikes<br />
are acting against the Australian community's interests in a sound<br />
and prosperous economy.<br />
The Arbitration Commission expressed its concern yesterday that<br />
strikes are adding to the cost of production, contributing to<br />
inflation and inhibiting the economic recovery. In the eight months<br />
since the election we have brought federal government spending under </p>
<p>control; we have reduced th ieof the Commonwealth Public Service;<br />
we have established an Investment Allowance; and suspended Quarterly<br />
tax payments for private enterprise. we are reviewing the mass of<br />
rules and regulations introduced by Labor. We have reined in the<br />
growth of the money supply. We have fully indexed Personal Ihcome<br />
Tax for inflation. We have introduced mandatory secret postal<br />
ballots in all union elections. We have undertaken the most<br />
extensive programme. of consultations with trade union leaders and<br />
business. Inflation is coming down. The economy is recovering. We have<br />
restored responsible management to the nation's affairs. Bearing<br />
in mind the grevious state of the economy, some governments would<br />
be content to focus exclusively on economic issues. This government<br />
has shown that it is possible to combine effective economic action<br />
with major reforms.<br />
In November, we committed ourselves to protect spending on essential<br />
education programmes against inflation. Despite severe Budgetary<br />
restraints, we have increased real spending on education and<br />
re-established triennial education planning. We committed ourselves<br />
to making the most significant reform of Federalism since Federation.<br />
Reform-which would provide State and Federal governments with a sound<br />
basis of financial independence.<br />
We have begun to implement these reforms. State and Local governments<br />
will be given access to a percentage of personal income tax<br />
revenue. These reforms will achieve a devolution of power which<br />
will enable decisions affecting the citizen to be taken at an<br />
appropriate level.<br />
In our Policy Speech we said that the weak, the poor, the unorganised,<br />
the people wanting to buy homes, had been fobbed off with words<br />
instead of real assistance. We have acted decisively in these areas.<br />
We committed ourselves to protecting the real value of pensions.<br />
We have acted to protect pensions by adjusting them half-yearly<br />
in accordance with changes in the C. P. I.<br />
We committed ourselves to helping the aged. We have acted by<br />
introducing a three-year $ 225 million programme to provide homes<br />
for the aged. We committed ourselves to helping the disadvantaged<br />
in ways leaving them the greatest scope for independence. We have<br />
acted by introducing our family allowance scheme. This has been<br />
recognised as the single, most important reform in the Austr . alian<br />
Social Welfare system since Federation. It ended a system which<br />
discriminated against the children of the poor, because their parents<br />
did not have sufficient taxable income to qualify for the children's<br />
tax rebate.<br />
Over 300,000 families and 800,000 children who were debarred wholly<br />
or partly from benefiting from the rebate system, are now being<br />
assisted by the family allowance. The family allowance scheme does<br />
not add to bureaucratic overheads and it places money in the hands<br />
of people. It does not increase their dependence on the government,<br />
butlets people make their own choices about what their needs are<br />
and how best to meet them. It is a scheme which both assists the<br />
disadvantaged and increases their independence.<br />
We said that home ownership should be a national objective and we<br />
committed ourselves to introducing a new home savings grant system.<br />
We have introd'ced a home savings grant with more generous provisions<br />
than the ones we announced. </p>
<p>We committed ourselves to retaining Mvedibank and making it more<br />
efticient. We have not only retained Medibank, but extended its<br />
operation. It was necessary to introduce changes to Medibank<br />
because Medibank had to be paid for. We are not trying to hide<br />
the fact that Medibank must be paid for.<br />
Under our Medibank proposals health cover is universal. Everyone<br />
is included in comprehensive and high quality medical and health<br />
insurance. Pensioners and those on the lowest incomes pay no levy.<br />
There will be choice of medical health insurance. As well, the<br />
government will provide additional assistance to the chronically<br />
ill and will subsidise low and medium income earners who want to<br />
have intermediate ward accommodation.<br />
There is an element of complexity btecause this is the only way<br />
in which choice can be introduced into the scheme. But there is<br />
a perfectly simple way for families to cover themselves and get<br />
high quality health care. This is by paying the levy which has<br />
a ceiling on it. This requires no action.<br />
The Labor approach did not permit choice. The Labor Party and<br />
the opponents of our Medibank reforms want to impose uniformity on the.<br />
Australian people to eliminate choice and impose tneir-views on<br />
the people of Australia.<br />
In our term of office we have undertaken an active programme to<br />
expand opportunities and protect the disadvantaged. We are<br />
increasing funds for education. We have restored triennial<br />
planning. We are reforming the federal system and giving the<br />
states greater financial independence. We are strengthening the<br />
capacities of local councils. We are retaining and improving Medibank.<br />
We are securing homes for the aged. We have protected the<br />
real value of pensions. We have introduced the historic family<br />
allowance scheme. We have established a major new home savings<br />
grant scheme. We are setting a new course for Australia.<br />
We recognise that the strength of Australia is the initiative,<br />
the imagination, the enterprise of its citizens; That the role of<br />
government is to expand the freedom and the opportunities for<br />
Australians, not tie the nation up in bureaucratic regulation and<br />
government domination.<br />
We recognise that needed reforms do not have to mean massive new<br />
programmes of government spending. We believe they should be<br />
reforms which protect and expand people's capacity to control<br />
their own lives without domination by others. We believe our<br />
philosophy of freedom and concern is in harmony with the real needs<br />
of Australia and will produce a better life for all Australians.<br />
We believe the vast majority of people want to work together to<br />
make Australia the great country it can be.<br />
What we have done so far is a beginning. Last year Tasmania showed<br />
the way. Now it is up to the Liberal Party, and to every branch<br />
and every member of the Party everywhere in Australia, to show<br />
the vitality of Australian democracy and make Australia-an example<br />
to the world. 1 </p>
