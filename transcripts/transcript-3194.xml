APPOINTMENT OF AUSTRALIA'S FIRST WOMAN AMBASSADOR<br />
The first appointment of a woman career diplomat as an<br />
Australian Ambassador overseas was announced today by t} n<br />
Prime Minister and Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs<br />
Mr Whitlam. She is Miss Ruth L. Dobson, at present Counsellor at the<br />
Australian Embassy in Athens. She is to become Australia's<br />
first resident Ambassador to Denmark, succeeding Dr LoD. Thomson,<br />
who, until now, has been dually accredited from The Hague.<br />
Miss Dobson is one of 35 women diplomats in the Australian<br />
foreign service, most of whom have been recruited by the<br />
Department of Foreign Affairs since 1970.<br />
Twenty currently occupy positions overseas, including two<br />
other senior posts, Deputy High Commissioner at the Australian<br />
High Commission in Zuva and Counsellor at the Australian Embassy<br />
in Rome. Mr Whitlam said that he regarded the first appointment of a<br />
woman career diplomat to an ambassadorial position as an important<br />
development in the growth and capacity of Australia's foreign<br />
service. Her appointment, the Prime Minister added, also underlined<br />
Australia's wish to strengthen its relations with Denmark<br />
which had always been strong and cordial, and the importance<br />
Australia attached to its relations with the enlarged European<br />
Economic Community, of which Denmark had become a full member<br />
in January 1973.<br />
Miss Dobson, who was born in Sydney, was educated at<br />
Frensham School, Mittagong, and the University of Sydney where<br />
she obtained a rA degree. She joined the Department of Foreign<br />
Affairs in 1943 and was attached to the then Division of Post<br />
Hostilities and the United Branch as a research officer. </p>
<p>She was integrated into the diplomatic service in 1957<br />
and from 1961 to 1963 served at the Australian High Commission<br />
in Wellington. She was promoted to First Secretary in 1962<br />
and was the Department's Conference Officer from 1964 to 1965.<br />
Later, Miss Dobson was seconded to the Governor-General's<br />
staff as private secretary to Lady Casey, and from 1967 to 1968<br />
served as First Secretary at the Australian Embassy in ManilaÃ¸<br />
She was promoted to Counsellor in 1970 and during 1971 was in<br />
charge of the Department's Western Europe Section in Canberra. </p>
