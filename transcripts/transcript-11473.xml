<p>E&amp;OE...</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, good morning and welcome.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Thank you, I've just ducked out to buy some show bags.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>You've been in the agricultural area?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, I have . . . the beef cattle, and some of the merinos and I am going</p>
<p> off to have lunch with the beef cattle people. They're actually doing</p>
<p> fairly well at the moment.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>Yes, thank God.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Thank heavens, they deserve it because they were being knocked around</p>
<p> for a long time . . .</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>They sure were.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The Asian downturn knocked them around, but that's come back and</p>
<p> we've got quite good markets in Japan and Korea and we sometimes</p>
<p> forget that we have made some progress in getting access to some of these</p>
<p> markets over recent years and that's very good news for the bush.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>We should be talking about this instead of the GST?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh well I don't mind, you talk about anything you like. It is coming</p>
<p> soon and it will be good for all of us.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>Well, I am convinced . . .</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We'll have lower personal tax.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>Well you know my opinion about the GST.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I do.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>I think it will be good for all of us. But there's a bit of misunderstanding</p>
<p> and I suppose until it comes in we won't be able to . . .</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I think the mood of the public now as they know it's coming</p>
<p> in a few weeks time, and I don't think they're listening too</p>
<p> much to the political exchanges about it, they will make their own minds</p>
<p> up in their normal, commonsense way after the first of July. And I think</p>
<p> for most people some things will go up a bit in price, some will come</p>
<p> down and some will remain the same and everybody will have tax cuts, so</p>
<p> I think that's good.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>I think I must say that they're all terrified of the thought of</p>
<p> Kim Beazley becoming Prime Minister and rolling back the GST . . .</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well . . .</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>How you roll it back I don't know.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well look, once we get this in, the idea of then going through all of</p>
<p> this again to change it in whole or in part is just crazy and I think</p>
<p> most Australians will take that view.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>I agree with you absolutely. Now, how come you're visiting the agricultural</p>
<p> places and you haven't got your hat on?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well . . .</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>Your good Akubra.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I decided not to wear it today, it didn't seem to sit, doesn't</p>
<p> seem to suit my business suit and I am going on to something else that</p>
<p> doesn't need an Akubra. But it is a glorious Autumn day.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>It's a wonderful day.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, it's perfect.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>And this complex is absolutely superb.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The, all of the people who are involved in the exhibits and the demonstrations</p>
<p> are all telling me that the space and people who have gone to similar</p>
<p> facilities around the world claim it's better than any they've</p>
<p> been to. So it's a real credit to the RAS and everybody else associated</p>
<p> with it.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>And I have very little doubt despite the incompetence in many areas of</p>
<p> SOCOG that we will put on the best Olympic Games in the history of the</p>
<p> games.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Sydney will do it on its ear.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Sydney has a great capacity to adapt and Australians, everybody will</p>
<p> be very happy and positive and they'll forget all the negative things</p>
<p> when the games come along and it will be a great showcasing of our country</p>
<p> and it will really make you very proud to be an Australian when those</p>
<p> games are on.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>I agree with you again, absolutely. Good to see you Prime Minister.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Thanks John.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your time.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Nice of you to have me. Cheers.</p>
