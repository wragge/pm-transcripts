    <content><![CDATA[<p>Australia hosted the successful 1956 Olympic Games at Melbourne and</p>
<p> now looks forward to the Sydney Olympics in the year 2000. The Opening</p>
<p> Ceremony wil be held on Friday 15 September 2000 and the Closing Ceremony</p>
<p> on Sunday 1 October 2000.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth Government is providing support to the New South</p>
<p> Wales Government and the organising committees as they prepare for</p>
<p> the Olympic and Paralympic Games in Sydney in 2000. This support is</p>
<p> both in terms of specific funding and through the provision of a range</p>
<p> of services such as airports, immigration, customs, weather services,</p>
<p> drug testing and security.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth's involvement is managed through two key Ministerial</p>
<p> Committees. One deals with general Games matters and encompasses a</p>
<p> range of portfolio interests and the other deals specifically with</p>
<p> security matters. Both are chaired by the Hon Warwick Smith MP, Minister</p>
<p> Assisting the Prime Minister for the Sydney 2000 Games. Mr Smith is</p>
<p> supported in this role by a unit within the Department of the Prime</p>
<p> Minister and Cabinet.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth has also provided and committed $135 million for</p>
<p> the Olympic Athlete Programme to assist our athletes to prepare for</p>
<p> the Games. The Programme is managed by the Australian Sports Commission</p>
<p> and aims to develop Australia's elite athletes to their highest</p>
<p> potential to represent Australia with distinction in the year 2000.</p>
<p>Other organisations involved in the organisation of the Games are:</p>
