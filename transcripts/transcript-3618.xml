PREMIERS' CONFERENCE 11, FEBRUARY 1975<br />
OPENING STATEMENT BY THlE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THlE HON. E. G. WHITLAM, M. P.<br />
WHEN WE MET IN JUNE AND AUGUST LAST YEAR WE WERE<br />
AS lIE HAD TO BE PRE-OCCUPIED WITH INFLATION. AT OUR JUNE<br />
MEETING, I TOLD YOU THAT IF TFE ECONOMIC SITUATION CHANGED<br />
AND IT HAS CHANGED WE WOULD MEET TO LOOK AT IT AGAIN.<br />
INFLATION IS, OF COURSE, STILL TO BE OVERCOME, BUT THERE IS<br />
NOW A TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE LEVEL OF UNEMPLOYMENT IN THE<br />
SECOND HALF CF 1974 THE ECONOMY TURNED DOWN DRAMATICALLY.<br />
FROM THE BOOM CONDITIONS OF THE FIRST HALF OF 1974, ECONOMIC<br />
ACTIVITY HAS DROPPED SHARPLY AT A R. ATE NON4E OF US COULD<br />
HAVE ANTICIPATED. MOST OTHER DEVELOPED COUNTRIES HAVE, OF<br />
COURSE, HAD A SIMILAR EXPERIENCE OVER THIS PERIOD. REGISTERED<br />
UNEMPLOYMENT HAS RISEN FROM A SEASONALLY ADJUSTED 1 .4 PER CENT<br />
OF THE LABOR FORCE IN JUNE 1974 TO 4.1 PER CENT IN DECEMBER,<br />
THE HIGHEST LEVEL SINCE THE 1930' S. THE INFLATION RATE AS<br />
MEASURED BY THE CHANGE IN THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX OVER A<br />
YEAR EARLIER ROSE FROM 14.4 PER CENT IN THE JUNE QUARTER TO<br />
16.3 PER CENT IN THE DECEMBER OUARTER OF 1974. SOME CHARTS I<br />
HAVE HAD PREPARED TO ILLUSTRATE THIS SITUATION ARE BEING<br />
HANDED AROUND. THE CURRENT INFLATION ORIGINATED IN EY'TRAORDINARY<br />
AND UNPRECEDENTED DEVELOPMEITTS IN THE ECONOMY IN THE RECENT<br />
PAST. THE PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT, FOR ELECTORAL REASONS,<br />
ALLOWED A RATE OF MONETARY EXPANSION WHICH WAS TOTALLY<br />
UNJUSTIFIABLE IN ITS RAPIDITY AND WHICH WAS MAINLY RESPONSIBLE<br />
FOR THE DEMAND INFLATION OF 1972-73* AND THE INEVITABLE<br />
CONSEQUENCE OF THE CURRENT COST INFLATION. THIS IS SOMETHING<br />
WHICH SHOULD NOT BE FORGOTTEN AS WE ANALYSE OUR PRESENT </p>
<p>-2<br />
DIFFICULTIES. I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT OUR CURRENT INFLAT ION HAS<br />
BEEN PUSHED ALONG BY WAGE INCREASES THAT HAVE FAR OUTPACj3' D<br />
THE ABILITY OF FIRMS TO ABSORB THROUGH PRODUCTIVITY INCREASES<br />
OR, IN THE PREVAILING ECONOMIC CLIMATE, TO PASS ON IN TER"-MS<br />
OF EVEN HIGHER PRICE RISES. THE RESULT HAS BEEN A SUBSTANTIAL<br />
SQUEEZE ON PROFITS WHICH HAS LED TO A CUT-BACK IN THE SCALE<br />
OP' ACTIVITY AND THE POSTPONEMENT OF MANY INVESTMENT PROJECTS.<br />
THUS THE INFLATIONARY MENACE REMAINS A PRIME CONCERN NOT LEAST<br />
BECAUSE IT HAS BECOME INEXTRICABLY BOUND--UP IN THE PROBLEM<br />
OF UNEMPLOYMENT. TO ACHIEVE A LASTING IMPROVEMENT IN THE UNEMPLOYMENT<br />
SITUATION, AS WE ARE TOTALLY COMMITTED TO DOING, WE ARE<br />
DIRECTING OUR ATTENTION TO THIS BASIC ISSUE. WE CAN, IN THE<br />
SHORTER-TERM, MAKE SOME INROADS INTO THE UNEMPLOYMENT PROBLEM<br />
AND THAT, OF COURSE, IS THE MAIN REASON WE ARE MEETING TODAY.<br />
BUT IN MAKING DECISIONS TODAY WE MUST DO SO IN A MANNER THAT WILL<br />
NOT MAKE THlE PROBLEM OF INFLATION MORE UNMANAGEABLE.<br />
GENTLEMEN, THIS WAS THE CONTEXT IN WHICH IT WAS<br />
AGREED TO PROPOSE THIS MEETING. LET M E REPEAT PART OF THE<br />
MESSAGE I SENT TO YOU:<br />
" IT IS ENVISAGED THAT DISCUSSION WOULD CENTRE ON:<br />
THE AMOUNT AN) FORM OF ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL<br />
ASSISTANCE WHICH STATE GOVERNMENTS, STATE<br />
SEMI-GOVERNMENTAL AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES<br />
REQUIRE TO RETAIN OR RE-ENGAGE EMPLOYEES, AND </p>
<p>-3<br />
THlE REPORTS OF THE WORKING PARTIES OF<br />
AUSTRALIAN AND STATE GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS<br />
ON POSSIBLE JOINT ACTION TO RESTRAIN<br />
INFLATIONARY PRESSURES...".<br />
I PROPOSE WE CONCENTRATE FIRST ON DISCUSSION OF ITEM<br />
THE WORDS WERE, I EMPHASISE, CAREFULLY CHOSEN TO INDICATE<br />
ACCURATELY THE BASIS OF OUR APPROACH. IN THIS MATTER WE<br />
ARE FOCUSSING ON UNEMPLOYMENT; ACCORDINGLY OUR PRIMARY<br />
CONCERN IS TO ASSESS THE EMPLOYMENT EFFECTS OF YOUR PROPOSALS.<br />
MY GOVERNMENT HAS, AS YOU ARE AWARE, TAKEN<br />
ACTION THROUGH MONETARY POLICY TO ENSURE THAT LIQUIDITY<br />
IS MUCH FREER AND BANK LENDING CAN BE MAINTAINED AT A<br />
LEVEL SUFFICIENT TO MEET THE IMMEDIATE NEEDS OF THE<br />
COMMUNITY FOR FINANCE.<br />
WE HAVE ADDED SUBSTANTIALLY TO OUR DIRECT<br />
OUTLAYS IN A WAY THAT WILL ENHANCE EMPLOYMENT PROSPECTS.<br />
PERSONAL INCOME TAX RATES HAVE BEEN SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCED<br />
TO. ENCOURAGE CONSUMER SPENDING AND TO HELP OFFSET THE<br />
PRESSURE FOR WAGE DEMANDS. COMPANY TAX RATES HAVE ALSO<br />
BEEN REDUCED AND SPECIAL PROVISIONS RELATING TO DEPRECIATION<br />
ALLOWANCES HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED TO IMPROVE COMPANY PROFITABILITY.<br />
SPECIFIC MEASURES HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO ALLEVIATE THE IMMEDIATE<br />
PROBLEMS OF CERTAIN INDUSTRIES INCLUDING IMPORTANTLY THE<br />
MOTOR VEHICLE INDUSTRY.<br />
THE ACCELERATION IN COSTS THAT IS EVIDENT IN THE<br />
COMMUNITY AT LARGE HAS, OF COURSI', ALSO CREATED LARGE PROBLEMS<br />
FOR THE STATES AND) THEIR AUTHORITIES WHICH IMPINGE DIRECTLY </p>
<p>-4<br />
ON THE LEVELS OF EMPLOYMENT THEY CAN SUSTAIN. I ThI1NK<br />
YOU WILL AGREE WITH THAT, AND ACCORDINGLY I THINK YOU<br />
WILL AGREE WITH ME WIhEN I EMPHASISE THAT WE SHOULD<br />
APPROACH THE IMMEDIATE PROBLEMS, AS FAR AS IS PRACTICABLE,<br />
IN A WAY THAT WILL NOT EXACERBATE THE PROBLEM OF INFLATION.<br />
WE HAVE TAKEN THAT AS AN ESSENTIAL FACTOR IN OUR CONSIDERATION.<br />
AS TO THE UNEMPLOYMENT PROBLEM, IT IS NOT SIMPLY<br />
A MATTER OF ALJLOCATING MORE FUNDS FROM THE BUDGET OR SIMPLY<br />
TRYING TO SPEND MORE MONEY. THE SITUATION IS MUCH MORE<br />
COMPLEX THAN THAT. INCREASED EXPENDITURE MUST BE AIMED AS<br />
DIRECTLY AS POSSIBLE AT UNEMPLOYMENT. AT THE SAME TIME WE<br />
WILL NOT ACHIEVE OUR EMPLOYMENT OBJECTIVES IN THE LONGER<br />
TERM IF WE CANNOT CURB INFLATION.<br />
ON 28 JANUARY I ANNOUNCED THAT THE GOVERNMENT<br />
HAS DECIDED TO ESTABLISH A SPECIAL COMMITTEE OF MINISTERS<br />
TO REVIEW CONTINUING GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE PROGRAMS AND<br />
TO EXAMINE ALL FUTURE EXPENDITURE PROPOSALS WHICH COME<br />
BEFORE IT. I QUOTE NOW FROM THE STATEMENT OF 28 JANUARY:<br />
" THE GOVERNMENT HAS DECIDED THAT THERE OUGHT TO<br />
BE A GENERAL PRESUMPTION AGAINST FURTHER INCREASES OF<br />
GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE. ANY SUCH INCREASE MUST MEET<br />
THE CRITERIA ADOPTED BY CABINET" AND FURTHER:<br />
" THE COMMITTEE WILL GIVE CAREFUL CONSIDERATION<br />
TO THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN EMPLOYMENT AND INFLATION.<br />
IT WILL ENSURE THAT GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURES ARE<br />
DIRECTED TO THE EMPLOYMENT OR RE-EMPLOYM'ENT OF<br />
PEOPLE WITHOUT AGGRAVATING INFLATIONARY FORCES. </p>
<p>PROPOSALS AIMED DIRECTLY AT PREVENTING SIGNIFICANT<br />
RETRENCHMENTS WOULD HIAVE A HIGH PRIORITY AND BECAUSE<br />
MOST JOBS THREATENED ARE IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR,<br />
THIS APPLIED PARTICULARLY TO THAT SPHERE IN THE<br />
ECONOMY." THE STATEMENT CONCLUDED AS FOLLOWS:<br />
" SUPPORT FOR STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE<br />
WILL BE EXAMINED WITH CARE TO ENSURE THE CAPACITY AND<br />
WILLINGNESS OF THE STATE OR LOCAL GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES<br />
TO USE FUNDS PROVIDED BY THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT,<br />
WITHIN THE APPROPRIATE TIME SPAN."<br />
THAT STATEMENT OF 28 JANUARY WAS NOT MADE LIGHTLY. IT<br />
WILL ESTABLISH THE POINT IF I TELL YOU THAT ON THE BASIS<br />
OF OUR LATEST ESTIMATES WE FACE A VERY HEAVY DEFICIT IN<br />
OUR BUDGET FOR 1974-75. IT WOULD CLEARLY BE A COMPLETELY<br />
WRONG ASSUMPTION FOR ANYONE TO MAKE, THAT THERE IS MUCH<br />
LEFT TO BE SQUEEZED OUT OF OUR BUDGET THIS YEAR -ANY "-ONS",<br />
AS THEY SAY, WILL NEED TO BE MATCHED BY " OFFS" -THAT WILL<br />
BE PART OF THE ROLE OF THE NEW EXPENDITURE COMMITTEE. THE<br />
POINT IS THAT ANY ASSISTANCE WHICH MY GOVERNMENT PROVIDES<br />
TO THE STATES WILL HAVE TO BE ADDED TO OUR BUDGET DEFICIT.<br />
IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES WE ARE ENTITLED TO HAVE THE CLEAREST<br />
JUSTIFICATION FOR ADDING TO OUR DEFICIT. </p>
<p>-6<br />
THE NEXT DAY, ON 29 JANUARY, I ASKED IN MY MESSAGE<br />
YOU COULD PROVIDE URGENTLY SUCH INFORMATION NOT<br />
ALREADY AVAILABLE TO US AS WOULD ASSIST IN AN ASSESSMENT<br />
OF YOUR STATE'S NEEDS FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE INCLUDING<br />
ASSISTANCE FOR ROADS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CRITERION<br />
OUTLINED" EARLIER IN THE MESSAGE.<br />
OUR ASSESSMENT OF YHAT ASSISTANCE SEEMS APPROPRIATE<br />
TO ENABLE YOUR GOVERNMENTS AND SEMI-GOVE~ RNMENTAL AND LOCAL<br />
AUTHORITIES TO RETAIN OR RE-ENGAGE EMPLOYEES, HAS BEEN MADE<br />
AS IT PROPERLY HAD TO BE MADE ON THE BASIS OF THE<br />
INFORMATION YOU HAVE PROVIDED TO US IN YOUR LETTERS AND<br />
YOUR DISCUSSIONS WITH THE TREASURER. WE DO READ THE<br />
NEWSPAPERS, OF COURSE, AND THEY HAVE WRITTEN MUCH IN RECENT<br />
DAYS ABOUT WHAT THE STATES NEED OR SAY THEY NEED. BUT I<br />
THINK YOU WILL ALLOW THAT SUCH REPORTS AS THEY PURVEY COULD<br />
SCARCELY BE A BASIS FOR SERIOUS CONSIDERATION BY US ALONGSIDE<br />
THE INFORMATION YOU HAVE PROVIDED TO US DIRECTLY.<br />
THE INFORMATION YOU HAVE ALREADY FURNISHED<br />
REGARDING THE PROBLEMS YOU FACE IN THE MAINTENANCE OR<br />
RESTORATION OF EMPLOYMENT MAKE IT CLEAR THAT ALL THE STATES'<br />
BUDGETS HAVE SUFFERED FROM THlE EFFECT OF INCREASES IN WAGE<br />
-AND SALARY RATES, AN~ n OTHER COSTS. IN ALL STATES, THE SEMIGOVERNMENT<br />
AUTHORITIES HAVE FACED THE SAME DIFFICULTIES ON<br />
THIS SCORE AS HAVE THE STATES THEMSELVES; CLEARLY THEIR<br />
COSTS HAVE RISEN MUCH MORE THAN THE 12 PER CENT INCREASE<br />
IN THEIR BORROWING PROGRAMS WHICH THE LOAN COUNCIL AGREED<br />
LAST JUNE. IN ALL STATES ALSO SPENDING ON ROADS HAS BEEN<br />
AFFECTED 13Y RAPIDLY RISING COSTS. </p>
<p>-7<br />
OUR PROPOSALS WHICH I SHALL PUT TO YOU ARE IN<br />
THEIR PARTICULAR FORM ANT) MAGNITUDE, A RESPONSE TO THESE<br />
PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES. THEY DO NOT REPRESENT ON-GOING<br />
ARRANGEMENTS, THE PROPOSALS RELATE TO THE PRESENT THEY<br />
ARE TAILORED TO THE PRESENT UNEMPLOYMENT DIFFICULTIES.<br />
THE PREMIERS OF NEW SOUTH WALES, VICTORIA,<br />
QUEENSLAND AND WESTERN AUSTRALIA HAVE PROPOSED THAT<br />
$ 300 MILLION BE ALLOCATED TO THE STATES FOR REDUCING<br />
CHARGES WHICH BEAR DIRECTLY ON THE COST-OF-LIVING. THIS<br />
PROPOSAL, WHICH IS REALLY A REPETITION OF ONE DISCUSSED<br />
LAST AUGUST, HAS BEEN CONVEYED TO ME IN A LETTER FORWARDED<br />
TO ME BY THE PREMIER OF VICTORIA. I DO NOT THINK PREMIERS<br />
WILL BE SURPRISED, PARTICULARLY IN THE LIGHT OF OUR EARLIER<br />
DISCUSSION, WHEN I SAY THAT THIS PROPOSAL IS NOT ONE THAT<br />
APPEALS TO US.<br />
I RE-EMPHASISE THE POINT I MADE THAT WE ARE<br />
PREPARED TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO THE<br />
STATES WHICH WILL HELP WITH THE IMMEDIATE PROBLEM OF<br />
UN EMPLOYMENT; AND WE ARE PREPARED TO ADD TO OUR ALREADY<br />
LARGE DEFICIT FOR THIS FINANCIAL YEAR TO THAT END. WE DO<br />
NOT SEE IN THE PROPOSED ALLOCATION OF $ 300 MILLION FOR<br />
REDUCTION OF CHARGES, A POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTION TO THE<br />
SHORT-TERM UNEMPLOYMENT PRCBLEM WHICH WOULD JUSTIFY SUCH<br />
AN ADDITION TO OUR DEFICIT.<br />
AGAINST THAT BACKGROUND AND SUBJECT TO My<br />
GOVERNMENT'S CONSIDERATION OF THE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION<br />
REQUESTED IN MY MESSAGE OF 12 FEBRUARY, THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
GOVERNMENT IS PREPARED TO PROVIDE SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF </p>
<p>-8<br />
ADDITIONAL FUNDS TO THE STATES IN 1974-75 FOR EMPLOYMENT<br />
PURPOSES. A DOCUMENT DETAILING O{ JR PROPOSALS WILL BE<br />
CIRCULATED. VERY BRIEFLY, THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT IS<br />
PREPARED TO SUPPORT THE PROVISION OF ADDITIONAL FUNDS FOR<br />
THE STATES AND THEIR AUTHORITIES IN 1974-75 TOTALLING<br />
$ 210 MILLION. THIS IS MADE UP AS FOLLOWS:-<br />
ADDITIONAL GENERAL REVENUE GRANTS OF $ 60 MILLION;<br />
ADDITIONAL STATE GOVERNMENT LOAN COUNCIL PROGRAMS<br />
OF $ 60 MILLION;<br />
ADDITIONAL BORROWING ALLOCATIONS FOR LARGER STATE<br />
AUTHORITIES OF $ 40 MILLION;<br />
ADDITIONAL EMPLOYMENT GRANTS OF<br />
$ 30 MILLION FOR ROADS<br />
$ 20 MILLION FOR GENERAL EMPLOYMENT PURPOSES.<br />
THE PRECISE BASES ON WHICH THE ASSISTANCE WILL<br />
BE MADE AVAILABLE ARE SET OUT IN THE DOCUMENT TO BE CIRCULATED.<br />
THERE IS ONE OTHER STATISTIC I MIGHT MENTION HERE.<br />
TAKING. INTO ACCOUNT THE ADDITIONAL FUNDS TO WHICH I HAVE<br />
REFERRED, AGGREGATE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT PAYMENTS TO THE<br />
STATES IN 1974-75 ARE NOW ESTIMATED AT ABOUT $ 6,420 MILLION<br />
AN INCREASE OF NO LESS THAN 47 PER CENT OVER LAST YEAR. I<br />
SHOULD POINT OUT THAT THIS TOTAL INCLUDES A FURTHER ADJUSTMENT<br />
OF $ 23 MILLION TO THE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE GRANTS, ARISING<br />
FROM REVISED ASSUMPTIONS FOR POPULATION AND AVERAGE WAGES.<br />
I CAN ASSURE YOU, HOWEVER, THAT IN IT WE HAVE<br />
ENDEAVOURED AS EFFECTIVELY AS POSSIBLE TO MEET THE VARIOUS<br />
NEEDS AND OBJECTIVES WITH THE MOST APPROPRIATE AMOUNTS AND<br />
FORMS OF ASSISTANCE, TA KING FULLY INTO ACCOUNT TH-E COMPREHEl-NSIVE </p>
<p>9-<br />
DATA YOU HAVE SUPPLIED. WE HAVE ALSO KEPT IN MIND OUR<br />
OVER-RIDING OBJECTIVE OF COMBATING EXCESSIVE INFLATION AND<br />
EXCESSIVE UNEMPLOYMENT.<br />
REPORT OF THE WORKING PARTIES ON INFLATION<br />
I TURN NOW TO THE SECOND ITEM ON OUR AGENDA THE<br />
REPORTS OF THE WORKING PARTIES OF AUSTRALIAN AND STATE GOVERNMENT<br />
OFFICIALS ON POSSIBLE JOINT ACTION TO RESTRAIN INFLATIONARY<br />
PRESSURES. THIS SECOND AGENDA ITEM BRINGS US TO THE OTHER<br />
MAJOR PROBLEM AREA FACING AUSTRALIA TODAY, THAT IS INFLATION<br />
A PROBLEM WHICH M4AY IN THE LONG TERM BE MORE PERMANENTLY<br />
DAMAGING TO OUR WAY OF LIFE THAN THE UNEMPLOYMENT LEVELS<br />
WHICH ARE TROUBLING US SO MUCH TO-DAY.<br />
TO SUCCESSFULLY TACKLE INFLATION WE NEED A NATIONAL<br />
ALL-AUSTRALIAN EFFORT BASED ON THE CO-OPERATION OF ALL THE<br />
PARTIES IN OUR FEDERAL UNION.<br />
AT OUR CONFERENCE, HERE, ON 13 AUGUST LAST YEAR,<br />
ALMOST EXACTLY SIX MONTHS AGO, AS PART OF OUR OVERALL STRATEGY<br />
TO THIS END, WE ESTABLISHED FIVE WORKING PARTIES OF AUSTRALIAN<br />
AND STATE GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS TO EXAMINE AREAS WHERE JOINT<br />
ACTION BY ALL OUR GOVERNMENTS MIGHT BE TAKEN TO RESTRAIN<br />
INFLATIONARY PRESSURES.<br />
THE WORKING PARTIES EXAMINED AREAS OF:<br />
STATE LEGISLATION TO SUPPORT THE JURISDICTION<br />
OF THE PRICES JUSTIFICATION TRIBUNAL.<br />
TENDERING PROCEDURES FOR GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS.<br />
THE POSSIBILITY OF INTRODUCING TAXATION PENALTIES<br />
ON EXCESSIVE WAGE INCREASES. </p>
<p>10<br />
JOINT ACTION BEFORE WAGE FIXING TRIBUNALS TO LIMIT<br />
WAGE INCREASES.<br />
MEASURES TO REDUCE THE MULTIPLICITY OF WAGE FIXING<br />
TRI BUNALS.<br />
IN THE MAIN, THESE REPORTS WHICH WERE DISTRIBUTED<br />
TO YOU BY 18 SEPTEMBER, REFLECT IN VARYING DEGREES AGREEMENT<br />
BETWEEN OUR OFFICERS ON WAYS AND MEANS OF ACHIEVING CONCERTED<br />
ACTION ON IMPORTANT NATIONAL PROBLEMS. THEY ARE, THEREFORE,<br />
WORTHY OF OUR SERIOUS CONSIDERATION AS A POSSIBLE BASIS FOR<br />
CO-OPERATION BETWEEN US IN THE FIELDS CONCERNED.<br />
I HAVE RECEIVED COMMENTS FROM MOST OF YOU ( YOUR<br />
RESPONSES ARE SUMMARISED IN A TABLE I AM CIRCULATING). IN<br />
SOME CASES, YOU HAVE HAD LITTLE COMMhENT TO MAKE ON THESE REPORTS,<br />
OR HAVE INDICATED THAT YOU WISHED TO DISCUSS THE FINDINGS OF<br />
THESE COMMITTEES AT A PREMIERS' CONFERENCE. I VERY MUCH<br />
APPRECIATE THE DETAILED CONSIDERATION THAT MANY OF YOU HAVE<br />
GIVEN TO THE REPORTS.<br />
ON THE BASIS OF YOUR VIEWS, I AM HOPEFUL THAT WE<br />
WILL BE ABLE TO REACH AGREEMENT TODAY ON THE MORE IMPORTANT<br />
CONCLUSIONS REACHED IN SOME OF THESE REPORTS.<br />
ADDITIONALLY, ON 21 AUGUST THE PREMIER OF VICTORIA<br />
WROTE TO ME SUGGESTING, INTER ALIA, THAT A WORKING PARTY SHOULD<br />
BE ESTABLISHED TO EXAMINE THE PRACTICABILITY OF LEGISLATION BY<br />
THE STATES TO EXTEND THE SCOPE OF THE LEGISLATION OF THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN PARLIAMENT FOR THE CONTROL OF RESTRICTIVE TRADE<br />
PRACTICES. I SUPPORTED THIS SUGGESTION AND IN TURN SUGGESTED<br />
TO ALL OF YOU ON 16 SEPTEMBER 1974 THAT WE SHOULD ESTABLISH<br />
SUCH A WORKING PARTY. THE PRlEMIERS OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA, WVESTERN<br />
AUSTRALIA AND TASMANIA HAVE ALREADY AGREED TO THIS PRO1POSAL AND </p>
<p>11<br />
THE OTHER PREMIERS HAVE THIS MATTER STILL UNDER CONSIDERATION.<br />
SOME WORK ARISING OUT OF THE PREMIERS' CONFERENCE OF 10 MAY<br />
1973 HAS ALREADY BEEN DONE IN THIS REGARD AND SUBJECT TO YOUR<br />
AGREEMENT I PROPOSE THAT WE NOW ESTABLISH A WORKING PARTY TO<br />
EXAMINE THIS QUESTION.<br />
I REFER FIRST TO THE REPORT ON THE QUESTION OF STATE<br />
LEGISLATION TO SUPPORT THE JURISDICTION OF THE PRICES<br />
JUSTIFICATION TRIBUNAL. SINCE THIS REPORT WAS COMPLETED,<br />
THERE HAD, OF COURSE, BEEN A MARKED, A ND LARGELY UNANTICIPATED,<br />
CHANGE IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AS IS ILLUSTRATED IN THE CHARTS<br />
I HAVE CIRCULATED. UNEMPLOYMENT HAS JUMPED TO A HIGH LEVEL<br />
MAINLY AS A RESULT OF A SEVERE SQUEEZE ON PROFITS. THIS IN<br />
TURN HAS ARISEN FROM THE RELATIVE SUCCESS OF THE MEASURES WE<br />
HAVE TAKEN TO RESTRAIN THE GROWTH IN PRICES, IN THE FACE OF A<br />
CCNTINUED ACCELERATION IN WAGES.<br />
AS YOU WILL BE AWARE, LAST NOVEMBER I MADE A SUBMISSION<br />
IN WRITING TO THE CHAIRMAN OF THlE PRICES JUSTIFICATION TRIBUNAL<br />
TO INDICATE THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMKENT'S VIEW THAT, IN PRESENT<br />
ECONOMIC CIRCUMSTANCES, THE TRIBUNAL SHOULD GIVE PARTICULAR<br />
ATTENTION TO THE PROBLEMS OF SUSTAINING AND STIMULATING AN<br />
ADEQUATE LEVEL OF PRIVATE INVESTMENT. I BELIEVE THAT THE<br />
TRIBUNAL HAS BEEN DOING THIS AND, INDEED, THAT IT HAD ALREADY<br />
TAKEN SOME STEPS IN THIS DIRECTION PRIOR TO MY SUBMISSION.<br />
I CONSIDER THAT THE ADOPTION AT THIS STAGE OF PROPOSALS<br />
TO STRENGTHEN THE TRIBUNAL'S ROLE COULD EASILY BE MISUNDERSTOOD<br />
ANT) COUNTERPRODUCTIVE FOR OUR PRIME AIM OF RESTORING FULL<br />
RvIP[ LOYMI. NT. RATHER THIAN PROCEED ING WITH ThE-IM NOW, 1. SUGGET WAfi'<br />
LEAVE THEM FOR FUTURE CONSIDERATION IF CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD SO<br />
I </p>
<p>12-<br />
WARRANT. I WISH, HOWEVER, TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO RAISE<br />
AGAIN WITH YOU THE SUBJE~ CT OF LAND PRICES, WHICH IS OF GREAT<br />
CONCERN TO MY GOVERNMENT. AS EARLY AS 27 DECEM1BER 1972 I<br />
WROTE TO ALL STATE PREMIERS SEEKING THEIR CO-OPERATION ON<br />
TIS IMPORTANT ISSUE, WHICH IS AN AREA IN WHICH THE STATES<br />
HAVE THE PREDOMINANT POWERS. YOU WILL RECALL THAT I RAISED<br />
IT AGAIN AT THE FIRST PREMIERS' CONFERENCE I CHAIRED ON 10 MAY<br />
1973 AND SOUGHT THE CO-OPERATION OF ALL STATES TOWA12DS THE<br />
ESTABLISHMENT OF STATE LAND COI% 2ISSIONS TO PARTICIPATE ACTIVELiY<br />
IN THE LAND MARKET AND TO INCREASE THE FLOW OF RESIDENTIAL<br />
LAND AT REASONABLE PRICES. I CONTINUE TO BE CONCERNED THAT ALL<br />
POSSIBLE ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN BY THE STATES TO INCREASE THIE<br />
SUPPLY OF LAND AND LIMIT THE RATE OF INCREASE IN RESIDENTIAL<br />
LAND PRICES. THE WORKING PARTY WHICH EXAMINED TENDERING PROCEDURES<br />
FOR GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS NOMINATED SEVERAL AREAS WHERE EFFECTIVyE<br />
ACTION COULD REDUCE THE LEVEL OR RATE OF INCREASE IN BUILDING<br />
AND CONSTRUCTION COSTS FOR GOVERNMENT WORKS. MY GOVERNMENT S W'RONGLY<br />
SUPPORTS THE WORKING PARTY RECCMYIENDATION THAT INCREASED<br />
CO-ORDINATION AND CO-OPERATION AT THE GOVERNM4ENTAL, DEPARTMENT AND<br />
INDUSTRY/ TRADE UNION LEVEL CAN ACHIEVE INTER ALIA:<br />
AN AVOIDANCE OF INDUSTRY RESOURCE UTILIZATION<br />
EXTREMES AND THE STIMULATION AND<br />
RATIONALISATION OF COMPETITION IN THE FIELD<br />
BY REGULATING THE VOLUME AND TYPE OF<br />
CONSTRUCTION WORK. </p>
<p>13<br />
THIS, I SUGGEST HAS PARTICULAR IMNPACT WHEN<br />
CONSIDERED ON A REGIONAL BASIS.<br />
A REDUCTION IN INFLATIONARY EXPECTATION<br />
ELEMENTS OF CONTRACT TENDERS FOR GOVERNMENT<br />
WORKS. REDUCED OVERHEAD AND HOLDING CHARGES FOR<br />
GOVERNMENT CONTRACTORS.<br />
I SUGGEST THAT WE NOW ASK THE WORKING PARTY TO FRAME PRACTICAL<br />
PROPOSALS WITH A VIEW TO AN EARLY MEETING OF RELEVAiNT MINISTERS.<br />
WITH REGARD TO THE WORKING PARTY ON TAX PENALTIES<br />
ON COMPANIES THAT GRANT EXCESSIVE WAGE INCREASES I SOUGHT YOlUR<br />
COMMENTS ON THE REPORT PREPARED BY OUR OFFICIALS IN SEPTEMBER<br />
1974. NOT ALL THE PREMIERS HAVE PROVIDED COMMIENTS. THOSE WHO<br />
HAVE, HAVE EXPRESSED DIFFERING VIEWS. SOME OF YOU HAVE<br />
RECOGNISED THE ADMINISTRATIVE DIFFICULTIES AND ANOMALIES BOUND<br />
UP IN ANY SCHEME OF TAX PENALTIES.<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT HAS ITSELF HAD THIS COMPLEX<br />
ISSUE EXAMINED BY A CCMMITTEE UNDER THE CHAIRMANSHIP OF DR COOMBS.<br />
THE CCMMITTEE'S REPORT, WHICH I MADE PUBLIC ON<br />
21 OCTOBER 1974, UNANIMOUSLY EXPRESSED THE VIEW THAT A PENAL<br />
TAX OF THE KIND ENVISAGED dOULD BE ADMINISTERED AT CONSIDERABLE<br />
COST, BUT ONLY IF THE SCHEME WERE CONFINED TO A FEW THOUSAND<br />
LARGE FIRMS. THE COMMITTEE WENT ON TO SAY THAT EVEN THEN THE<br />
SCHEME WOULD INEVITABLY CREATE SERIOUS ANOMALIES AND INEQUITIES<br />
AND WOULD CREATE DIFFICULTIES IN RELATIONS BETWEEN BUSINESS AND<br />
TIHE TAX AUTHORITIES AND) ALSO BETI1IEN EMPLOYERS AN]) E,' PLOYEES A\)<br />
TIAT COULI 1, I; AJ) ' rT O SON I UJSSr NI.-;: S; ' A TiUTI i </p>
<p>14<br />
THE GOVERNMENT'S VIEW IS THAT THE INTRODUCTION OF A<br />
PENALTY TAX SCHEME WOULD BE INAPPROPRIATE IN PRESENT<br />
CIRCUMSTANCES WHEN ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IS AT A LOW LEVEL. THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT DOES NOT WISH TO TAKE ANY ACTION WHICH<br />
WOULD DISCOURAGE THE EXPANSION OF EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES.<br />
THERE WERE ALSO TWO WORKING PARTIES ON WAGES MATTERS.<br />
ONE WAS ON ACTION TO LIMIT INFLATIONARY WAGE INCREASES; SOME OF<br />
YOU HAVE ALREADY COMMENTED ON ITS REPORT. THE OTHER, ON PRACTICAL<br />
STEPS TO REDUCE THE MULTIPLICITY OF WAGE FIXING TRIBUNALS, IS<br />
STILL AT WORK, ALTHOUGH A SECOND INTERIM REPORT HAS NOW BEEN<br />
PRODUCED. I SUGGEST THAT OUR LABOR MINISTERS MEET TO CONSIDER<br />
THE REPORT AND I CONSIDER THAT WE SHOULD TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY<br />
TO AGREE TO URGE THEM TO EXPEDITE THEIR WORK IN THIS FIELD.<br />
AS I SAID EARLIER, THE PRESENT SEVERE SQUEEZE ON PROFITS<br />
AND THE RESULTANT UNEMPLOYMENT HAS ARISEN PARTLY FROM THE<br />
RELATIVE SUCCESS OF THE MEASURES WE HAVE TAKEN TO RESTRAIN THE<br />
GROWTH IN PRICES, IN THE FACE CF A CONTINUED ACCELERATION IN WAGES.<br />
IN MAKING THAT STATEMENT WHICH I BELIEVE HAS<br />
WIDESPREAD ACCEPTANCE I DC NOT SEEK TO APPORTION BLAME. THE<br />
PRESENT SITUATION HAS ARISEN OUT OF OUR EXISTING INSTITUTIONAL<br />
ARRANGEMENTS AND THE BREAKDOVN; OF ESTABLISHED METHODS OF WAGE<br />
FIXATION. IT HAS OCCURRED WILLY NILLY OF THE GOOD INTENTIONS<br />
CF THOSE ARBITRATORS AND EMPLOYERS, AS WELL AS UNIONS AND<br />
INDIVIDUAL WAGE EARNERS WHO HAVE BEEN DIRECTLY INVOLVED. THE<br />
PROBLEM HAS BEEN TOO LARGE FOR INDIVIDUALS TO DEAL WITH. OUR<br />
ROLE, AS GOVERNMENTS, IS TO DO WHAT WE CAN TO RESTORE A FRAMEVORK<br />
IN WHICH ORDER CAN BE RE-ESTABLISHED IN THE WAGES AREA.<br />
IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS TERMS OF REFERENCE, TH]; E WORKING<br />
PARTY WE ESTABLISHED) ON ACTION TO LIMIT INFLATIONARY VAGE INCIREAi::. </p>
<p>15<br />
TOOK THE INTRODUCTION OF WAGE INDEXATION AS ITS STARTING POINT.<br />
WHETHER OR NOT WAGE INDEXATION WILL BE INTRODUCED IS OF COURSE<br />
A MATTER WIICH IS BEING FULLY DEBATED IN THE PROPER ARENA<br />
BEFORE THE ARBITRATION COMMISSION BY ALL THE INTERESTED PARTIES,<br />
AND THE COMMIISSION WILL IN DUE COURSE ANN. OUNCE ITS DECISION.<br />
NEVERTHELESS, WHATEVER THE NATURE OF THE COMMISSION'S<br />
DECISION, WE M1ST ALL RECOGNISE THAT WE WILL STILL BE CONFRONTED<br />
WITH A SERIOUS SITUATION ON THE WAGES FRONT. IF TIE COMMISSION<br />
DECIDES TO INTRODUCE AUTOMATIC INDEXATION OR ADOPTS SOME<br />
INTERMEDIATE COURSE, UNDER WHICH ADJUSTMENTS FOR PRICES WOULD<br />
BE REGULAR BUT NOT NECESSARILY AUTOMATIC, THEN OUR PRIME CONCERN<br />
MUST BE TO ENSURE THAT THIS DOES NOT JUST BECOME AN ADDITIONAL<br />
TIER TO WAGE FIXATION. WE CANNOT AFFORD A FURTHER NEW ROUND OF<br />
WAGE INCREASES ON TOP OF WAGE INDEXATION. ON THE OTHER HAND,<br />
IF THE COMMISSION DECIDES TO MAKE NO CRANGE TO THE EXISTING<br />
SYSTEM OF WAGE FIXATION, OUR CONCERN WILL BE TO ENSURE THAT THE<br />
EXPERIENCE OF 1974 IS NOT REPEATED AND THAT WAGE INCREASES ARE<br />
KEPT WITHIN BOUNDS THAT WILL NOT FURTHER EXACERBATE UNEMPLOYMENT<br />
AND INFLATION.<br />
REVIEW OF GENERAL REVENUE GRANTS<br />
BEFORE CONCLUDING, THERE ARE SOME POINTS I SHOULD MAKE<br />
ABOUT THE REVIEW OF GENERAL REVENUE ASSISTANCE ARRANGEMENTS TO<br />
WHICH WE ARE COMMITTED BEFORE THE END OF THIS FINANCIAL YEAR.<br />
PREM1IERS WILL RECALL THAT I WROTE TO THEM ON 20 NOVIZ'IBER<br />
LAST INVITING THEIR VIEWS. WE HAVE NOT YET HAD ANY SUBSTANTIVE </p>
<p>16<br />
SUBMISSIONS AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING THESE AS SOON AS<br />
POSSIBLE SO THAT WE HAVE TIME TO CONSIDER THEM IN DEPTH.<br />
IN FACT, I WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR TO PREMIERS THAT WE<br />
ARE REGARDING THIS REVIEW, AT THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT END,<br />
AS A MATTER OF IMPORTANCE; THAT WE WANT TO CANVASS ALL OPTIONS<br />
OPEN TO US, AND THAT WE ARE AIMING TO CONDUCT THE REVIEW IN A<br />
FULLY CO-OPERATIVE FASHION WITH THE STATES AND IN THE HOPE<br />
THAT THE REVIEW WILL RESULT IN AN IMIROVEMENT IN RELATIONSHIPS<br />
FROM ALL POINTS OF VIEW.<br />
YOU WILL PROBABLY HAVE READ OF THE RECENT ESTABLISHMENT<br />
OF A SMALL MINISTERIAL COMMITTEE TO WORK ON THIS. I EXPECT<br />
THAT COMMITTEE WILL BE MEETING FREQUENTLY OVER THE NEXT FEW<br />
WEEKS. WHAT WE WOULD THEN LIKE TO SEE HAPPEN IS A PROCESS OF<br />
FULL AND FRUNK DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN OUR. TREASURY<br />
OFFICIALS. SPEAKING FOR THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT, I CAN SAY<br />
THAT WE WOULD WANT ALL THE OPTIONS TO BE DISCUSSED BETWEEN THE<br />
OFFICIALS WITHOUT COMMITMENT, AND WE WOULD AUTHORISE OU] I OFFICIALS<br />
TO ENGAGE IN SUCH DISCUSSIONS AGAINST THE BACKGROUND OF GUIDANCE<br />
WHICH WE WOULD BE GIVING THEM. OUR AIM WOULD BE THAT OUR<br />
OFFICIALS BEGIN SUCH DISCUSSIONS EARLY IN APRIL. IF THE STATES<br />
ARE PREPARED TO CO-OPERATE IN THIS NEW APPROACH, I WOULD HOPE<br />
THE RESULT WOULD BE THAT WHEN WE MEET TOGETHER TO REVIEW THE<br />
GENERAL REVENUE ASSISTANCE ARRANGEMENTS LATER IN THE FINANCIAL<br />
YEAR WE WILL DO SO ON THE BASIS OF MUCH GREATER KNOWLEDGE, ON<br />
BOTH SIDES, OF THE OPTIONS AVAILABLE AND OF ATTITUDES TO THOSE<br />
OPTIONS. OUR DISCUSSIONS WOULD THEREFORE BE ( AS THEY OUGHT TO<br />
BE FOR SUCH AN IMPORTANT MATTER) ON A MUCH MORE PREPARED AND<br />
RESEIRCII BASIS I'JAN HAS (.; ENE. IZALLY bN,, N TEI, CASE IN Ti.' ., ASI.,<br />
YOU MAY IAVE NOTICED ALSO THAT IN ANNOUNCING TlE </p>
<p>17<br />
