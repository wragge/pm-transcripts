AL<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 27 JUNE 1979<br />
ENERGY POLICY<br />
Most Australians share the world-wide concern about the energy<br />
situation, oil shortages and escalating oil prices. Some of<br />
the impact of this has already been felt in this country. Oil<br />
prices have risen, and shortages have developed in petroleum<br />
products, notably aviation gasoline and fuel oil. The effect<br />
of the strike that recently shut down the Kurnell Refinery in<br />
New South Wales have pointedly brought home Australia's<br />
increased vulnerability to disruptions to domestic supplies.<br />
The Government has carefully monitored the world energy situation.<br />
With a further increase in OPEC prices imminent, with heightened<br />
international and domestic concern, the Government's view is that<br />
rather than wait for the next session of Parliament, it should<br />
announce its policy response to this situation now.<br />
This statement outlines a series of new Government initiatives.<br />
My colleague, the Minister for National Development, will be<br />
providing further information on these measures.<br />
The World Energy Situation<br />
The present turmoil in the world oil market has forced on the<br />
world an accelerated recognition of the need to adjust energy<br />
use patterns away from oil and towards alternative energy sources.<br />
That process of adjustment will be protracted and, particularly<br />
in the short run, painful for many countries. ./ 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
The most pressing-problem is to match the demand for oil with<br />
its supply. Prospective world oil supplies in 1979 are about<br />
two million barrels per day below what was anticipated in 1978<br />
The present situation was triggered by the Iranian oil crisis<br />
earlier this year. It has persisted because Iranian exports<br />
are still well below their previous levels. Saudi Arabia, the<br />
only producer capable of substantially increasing oil supply in<br />
the short term, appears to be less willing than previously to<br />
raise production to compensate for shortfalls in production<br />
elsewhere. Further interruptions to supplies cannot be ruled out.<br />
In response to the supply shortage, oil prices have been rising<br />
sharply. The price* of . OPEC crude -inc-luding premiums is already about<br />
per cent above 1978 levels. A meeting of the OPEC. Ministers<br />
is currently taking place. All the indications are that another<br />
substantial increase in the OPEC price.<br />
oil consuming nations are under pressure to reduce their demand<br />
for oil, both by restraining energy consumption and by<br />
accelerating the substitution of other energy sources for oil.<br />
The short term pressure is great because stocks, run down earlier<br />
this year, need to be re-built for the northern winter.<br />
International Energy Agency ( IEA) Minis ' ters representing most<br />
western oil consuming nations stressed at their meeting in Paris<br />
last month that strong action is urgently required to curb the<br />
demand for oil:<br />
" As to the short term, Ministers concluded that<br />
the international oil market has evolved rapidly<br />
into a situation of overall supply stringency,<br />
which has affected different countries in different<br />
ways, and that this situation is likely to continue<br />
into 1980. They expressed particular concern about<br />
the large and rapid increase in crude oil and product<br />
prices. .3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
" Ministers therefore confirmed the decision by<br />
IEA countries to reduce their demand for oil<br />
on the world market in the order of two million<br />
barrels per day which would correspond to about<br />
five per cent of IEA consumption..."<br />
These conclusions were endorsed two weeks ago by the<br />
Ministerial Council of the OECD; which concluded that:<br />
" There is now a real danger that, without<br />
responsible policies by oil consumers and<br />
producers alike, the energy situation will<br />
seriously damage the world economy."<br />
At the moment, the world energy situation is being considered<br />
at the Economic Summit in Tokyo by the leaders of seven of the<br />
largest non-communist developed countries.<br />
Most countries are acting to reduce their demand for oil and to<br />
augment supplies. The severity of the present situation bears<br />
very heavily on those countries which have little or. no domestic<br />
energy resources, particularly Japan and a number of European<br />
countries. The world's poorest countries, the non-oil producing<br />
developing nations will be the hardest hit.<br />
The oil situation has major implications for the world economy.<br />
Disturbances to oil supplies and increases in oil prices depress<br />
economic activity, add to inflationary pressures, and produce<br />
instability in exchange rates.<br />
Australia cannot ignore the world-wide consequences of what is<br />
happening. / 4 </p>
<p>-4<br />
Australia's Situation<br />
Australia is relatively'well placed as regards indigenous<br />
energy resources.<br />
We have abundant rich coal resources from which most of our<br />
electricity is generated.<br />
We have substantial reserves of natural gas which are being<br />
used increasingly as a'source of industrial and domestic energy.<br />
About 70 per cent of our oil requirements are being met from<br />
domestic crude oil, and liquified petroleum gas ( LPG) is<br />
progressively being used to supplement these resources.<br />
Production of crude oil from Bass Strait is estimated to be<br />
about 5 per cent higher than this time last year.<br />
Australia is a net exporter of energy, but we have to import<br />
about 30 per cent of our crude oil requirements, and our<br />
outlook for access to imported crude oil and petroleum products<br />
for the rest of 1979 has become more uncertain in recent weeks.<br />
This is due to continued restraint of production by OPEC and<br />
to continued high demand in the major consuming countries,<br />
including demand for rebuilding of stocks.<br />
We depend on imports of heavier imported crude oil to meet our<br />
fuel oil requirements, and we are reliant on imported aviation<br />
gasoline. We have already experienced shortages of these<br />
products. There will continue to be problems in these areas.<br />
The motor spirit situation. continues to be tight. The outlook,<br />
particularly in New South Wales, will be difficult to assess<br />
until the New South Wales refineries resume full operations<br />
but there clearly will be difficulty in rebuilding stocks in<br />
that State. oe </p>
<p>Looking at the overall petroleum product position, information<br />
from the industry indicates tnat the position should be<br />
manageable in the third quarter of 1979. However, there is<br />
uncertainty about the outlook for the last quarter of 1979<br />
which corresponds with the onset of winter in the northern<br />
hemisphere. Our inability to draw readily on imported supplies of refined<br />
products to meet temporary shortages resulting from<br />
disruptions to domestic production will pose a continuing<br />
problem. The situation will have to be handled with a great deal of care,<br />
common sense and co-operation.<br />
Existing Policy<br />
The Government has already introduced a number of measures to<br />
ensure secure and stable supplies of energy, reduce dependence<br />
on imported oil and, in the longer term, to develop a diversified<br />
energy base which minimises our dependence on scarce liquid fuels.<br />
Hard and effective decisions have been taken on pricing and<br />
tax policy to encourage exploration and development and support<br />
major energy development projects.<br />
A number of incentives were announced in the 1976-77 Budget:<br />
Petroleum exploration and development expenditures<br />
were made deductible against income from any source;<br />
Rapid write-off provisions were introduced for<br />
eligible capital expenditures by petroleum mining<br />
companies as well as other mining companies on the<br />
development of a mine or field and on transport<br />
facilities;<br />
Oil from discoveries after the 1976-77 Budget were<br />
freed from the crude oil levy. / 6 </p>
<p>-6-<br />
A number of measures were also introduced in the context of the<br />
North West Shelf project which have somewhat wider application:<br />
The investment allowance was extended by two<br />
years; The gas liquefaction plant was included as an<br />
allowable capital expenditure under the<br />
petroleum mining provisions;<br />
And a shareholder rebate scheme for off-shore<br />
petroleum exploration was introduced.<br />
We have increased support for energy research and development,<br />
promoted energy conservation and inter-fuel substitution, and<br />
been active in the area of international co-operation.<br />
Fundamental to the Government's energy policy has been the use<br />
of the market framework. As the then Minister for National<br />
Resources said in November ] 977 in this Government's first major<br />
energy statement: " Quite clearly, the Commonwealth Government's<br />
role should not be to attempt to dictate the<br />
precise future path along which energy producers<br />
and consumers should move It is, however,<br />
necessary to set the scene i. e. given our<br />
other objectives, allowing the forces of the<br />
market to allocate our available resources of<br />
manpower, capital and technology."<br />
It is of the highest importance that the price of petroleum<br />
products should be realistic. Allowing the pricing system to<br />
work, will: / 7 </p>
<p>7<br />
Sencourage conservation of scarce sources of<br />
energy in particular, liquid fuels other<br />
than LPG;<br />
promote the use of the available alternative<br />
energy sources mainly natural gas, LPG and<br />
coal-based electricity;<br />
Sstimulate commercial development of major new<br />
energy projects in areas such as shale oil,<br />
coal liquefaction, ethanol and methanol;<br />
Sprovide a major incentive to increase oil<br />
exploration activity and maximise development<br />
of existing fields.<br />
Although the OPEC countries had quadrupled the world price of<br />
crude oil in 1973-74, Australian prices for petroleum products<br />
remained artificially low, due to the availability of domestic<br />
crude oil at less than half the world price.<br />
Recognising this the Government began in the 1977 Budget the<br />
move towards import parity pricing for Australian produced<br />
crude oil.<br />
The move toward import parity has provided for the return to<br />
domestic producers to reach parity before crude oil levy on<br />
at least 50 per cent of their production by 1980-81.<br />
In the 1978 Budget, the Government decided that all Australian<br />
produced crude oil would henceforth be priced to refineries at<br />
import parity levels and that consumers of petroleum products<br />
would from that time pay prices based on world oil prices.<br />
/ 8 </p>
<p>-8<br />
By means of the crude oil levy arrangements, the bulk of<br />
the proceeds of the increased prices resulting from the<br />
1978 Budget decision accrued to the public revenue.<br />
There have been furtherOPEC price rises since that time<br />
and, as announced by the Treasurer on 24 May 1979, the<br />
Government decided to increase the proportion of those<br />
price rises accruing -to the public revenue.<br />
The Minister for National Development will shortly be<br />
announcing -the prices and rates of levy to apply to<br />
domestic crude oil production after 1 July 1979.<br />
It needs to be recognised that import parity prices based<br />
on the official OPEC price for crude oil. ( which was, prior<br />
to the current OPEC meeting, U. S. $ 14.54 barrel) is the<br />
lowest price at which significant quantities of oil are<br />
traded internationally.<br />
Since the Iranian crisis many OPEC countries have been<br />
adiding premiums of several dollars per barrel to that<br />
official price. In addition, increasing amounts of oil are<br />
being traded in the spot market at prices ranging up to<br />
per barrel and higher.<br />
Notwithstanding import parity pricing, Australians still<br />
pay much less for petroleum products -than consumers in most<br />
other western countries. Most Australians pay about half the<br />
price of motor spirit prevailing in European countries and<br />
Japan. For example, the price in Australian cents per litre<br />
in Japan is 48.9, United Kingdom 46.5, West Germany 41.7,<br />
France 49.8 and Italy 51.6. About the only countries with<br />
motor spirit prices b:., low Australia's are the United States<br />
of America and Canada. / 9 </p>
<p>9<br />
Our energy decisions must be based on realistic pr: ice.-for<br />
petroleum products. Countries which have been slow to face<br />
up to the reality of higher prices for oil have experienced<br />
shortages as a result of the world oil situation. The most<br />
notable example is the U. S. which consumes more than its fair<br />
share of the world's finite resources. Furthermore,<br />
unrealistic prices in the U. S. encourage a gross misallocation.<br />
of resources.<br />
The choice is between paying realistic prices for petroleum<br />
products or not having access to adequate supplies.<br />
There are no other options. Austalia, like all industrial<br />
nations, is heavily dependent upon oil as an energy source.<br />
It is inevitable that either we pay world parity price for<br />
our own domestic crude oil, or we will have to pay it for<br />
imported crude oil. In the former case we encourage explo-rat'Lo<br />
and development of our own resources; in the latter we become<br />
dependent on foreign suppliers. But either way we pay world<br />
parity price.<br />
The benefits of Australia's realistic pricing policies are<br />
already evident. Under the previous pricing policies oil<br />
exploration was dead, development was dead. As a result of<br />
our oil pricing policy and exploration incentives, oil search<br />
has revived, development has revived. our policy has already<br />
led -to an increase in economically recoverable reserves of<br />
some 600-700 million barrels. This is equivalent -to about<br />
three years' consumption.<br />
The recovery in exploration confidence under this Government<br />
is reflected in -the number of exploration wells drilled. In<br />
1978, 52 wells were drilled, more than double the number<br />
drilled in each of the previous three years. </p>
<p>The indications are that the higher level of activity in<br />
1978 will at least be maintained. Offshore, a total of<br />
68 exploration permits are currently in force, 27 of which<br />
have been granted in the last two years, including 7 since<br />
January 1979.<br />
The improved outlook for petroleum exploration is especially<br />
demonstrated by the fact that companies are prcpared to face<br />
the difficulties and enormous costs of exploring the<br />
Exmouth Plateau. This exploration effort is one of the most<br />
intensive deep-water undertakings anywhere in the world,<br />
with companies operating on the frontiers of current technology.<br />
A single well will cost around $ 10m. Drilling of the first<br />
well there was completed in May 1979 arid three further w-ells<br />
are curren tly drilling on the Exmouth Plateau. Of the<br />
world's 12 deep-water drilling rigs, three will be operatirg<br />
off Western Australia this year.<br />
New Initiatives<br />
The mteasures which arc, being announced today will build<br />
further on the foundations which have already been laid down.<br />
The Government reaffirms its policy of import<br />
parity pricing for domestic crude oil based<br />
on the official OPEC price. It will adopt<br />
a more flexible approach to the timing of<br />
price adjustments to take account of OPEC<br />
pricing decisions. </p>
<p>-11-<br />
The Government expects oil companies to obtain<br />
imported oil supplies, as necessary, to meet Australian<br />
requirements. It will ensure that the Prices<br />
Justification Tribunal will permit oil companies to<br />
pass on to users the higher costs associated with spot<br />
purchases, and will provide an assurance to this effect<br />
to the companies. The companies will be required to<br />
satisfy the Prices Justification Tribunal that spot<br />
purchases are bona fide and at arms length. The Governme. nt<br />
will ask New South Wales and South Australia to take<br />
similar action.<br />
In relation to imported aviation gasoline and fuel<br />
oil the Government has already ensured that oil suppliers<br />
have full opportunity to pass on costs of necessary<br />
purchases. The Government will act to ensure that existing price<br />
relativities on domestic petroleum products do not<br />
inhibit production of products in short supply.<br />
The Government will ask the oil industry to proceed<br />
to vary the octane ratings of motor spirit sold in<br />
Australia. The octane rating of supergrade motor spirit<br />
will be reduced from 98 to 97 and one major company<br />
will introduce a new regular grade of motor<br />
spirit of 92 octane. These changes could be implemented<br />
within a month and could save up to one per cent of<br />
Australian crude oil requirements.<br />
The Commonwealth will request the New South Wales and<br />
South Australian Governments not to proceed with more<br />
stringent emission standards until a longer term national<br />
emissions strategy is developed. In the meantime, urgent<br />
consideration should be given to supplementary energy<br />
saving emission control measures. Proceeding with the<br />
proposed third stage of the emission controls would<br />
result in 3 to 5 per cent more fuel usage. / 12 </p>
<p>12<br />
The Commonwealth will raise with the States the<br />
scope for a revision of lead content rules for<br />
motor spirit. This could increase the supply<br />
of petrol by about three per cent. Until January 1975<br />
the acceptable maximum lead content in petrol<br />
was .84 grams per litre. Following a report<br />
by the National Health and Medical Research<br />
Council, a number of states legislated to<br />
reduce the lead content of motor spirit. The<br />
phasing down produced an increase in energy<br />
consumption in refineries. The Royal Commission<br />
on Petroleum recommended that the phase down should<br />
not go beyond a level of 0.64 grams per litre, the<br />
National Energy Advisory Committee recommended that it<br />
be set at 0.6* 5 grams -A number of states have gone<br />
beyond this. The Commonwealth recognises that health<br />
considerations have to be taken into account but<br />
this measure is one which can be implemented quickly<br />
and reversed quickly.<br />
The Government will explore the scope for special<br />
reciprocal trade arrangements under which indigenous<br />
crude oil or lighter petroleum products in reasonable<br />
supply in Australia might be exchanged for heavier crude<br />
oil or heavier petroleum products which are in short<br />
supply in Australia. Such arrangements could be made<br />
through normal commercial channels. Discussions with<br />
companies interested in this possibility have already,<br />
been initiated. / 13 I </p>
<p>13<br />
Export controls for petroleum products will be modified.<br />
Blanket approvals of exports will be suspended. For<br />
the time being prior approval on a ship-by-ship basis<br />
will be required for all exports of petroleum products.<br />
The Government policy will be to approve exports where:<br />
traditional markets are being supplied and the<br />
level of exports to such markets is consistent<br />
with any cutbacks applying in the Australian<br />
market, or<br />
additional quantities of crude oil are provided<br />
for processing for export, or<br />
acceptable counterpart or exchange arrangements are<br />
available, or<br />
special technical considerations are demonstrated,<br />
or,<br />
Sthe exports are excess to Australia's requirements. / 14 </p>
<p>-14-<br />
The Government will also ensure that any allocation<br />
schemes implemented by companies follow sensible<br />
and fair practices across the industry and are coordinated<br />
with State and Territory Government<br />
emergency schemes.<br />
( 11) In order to improve the basis of the Government's<br />
monitoring of the oil situation, the Minister for National<br />
Development will write to the oil companies formally<br />
requesting that they provide comiplete data on the supply,<br />
consumption, stocks and exports of petroleum products.<br />
( 12) The Government will undertake with the oil companies<br />
a review of the adequacy of existing oil storage<br />
facilities in Australia and possible ways and means<br />
of adding to this capacity. The review wil~ l have regard<br />
to the needs of industry, including primary industry,<br />
and to geographical problems and seasonal requirements.<br />
Conservation Measures<br />
TJ. he highest priority is to conserve liquid fuels used in motor<br />
transport. The Government will proceed immediately with a voluntary program<br />
of national fuel economy goals for passenger vehicles. The fuel<br />
economy targets require the weighted average fuel consizmption<br />
of new passenger cars to be reduced from the present 11 litres/<br />
100 km to 9 litres/ l00 km by 1983 and 8 litres/ l00 km by 1987.<br />
This should result in savings of motor spirit of approximately<br />
per cent in 1983 and 12 per cent in 1987. </p>
<p>15<br />
The Government has initiated a study of the scope for saving<br />
liquid fuels within Government departments and agencies.<br />
State Governments are being invited to undertake similar action<br />
in relation to their Departments and agencies.<br />
The Government will proceed with a national energy conservation<br />
publicity campaign. Planning for this campaign is well advanced.<br />
The estimated cost of the campaign in 1979/ 80 is $ 2 miliion. The<br />
Commonwealth will invite the States to participate in this<br />
program on a jointly funded dollar-for-dollar basis.<br />
The Commonwealth has also decided to sponsor a major national<br />
conference on energy conservation in October. This conference<br />
and the launching of the national publicity campaign will<br />
coincide with the International Energy Agency's International<br />
Energy Conservation Month.<br />
The Government will authorise the Pipeline Authority to constru.: ct<br />
a twelve inch gas pipeline from Young to Wagga Wagga and<br />
Cootamundra costing approximately $ 15 million. A six inch line<br />
would be adequate to service Wagga Wagga and Cootamundra but<br />
the Government has decided to authorise the construction of a<br />
twelve inch line with a view to extending it from Wagga Wagga<br />
to Albury in the future and after consultation with the States.<br />
That linkage would connect the Bass Strait and Cooper Basin<br />
gas fields with the major cities thus establishing an eastern<br />
gas pipeline grid.<br />
Interfuel Substitution<br />
Natural Gas: There has recently been a strong swing to natural<br />
gas in the Sydney market. Savings of fuel oil are estimated at<br />
about 2 million barrels of crude oil Cr 1 per cent of total<br />
Australian oil requirements. / 16 </p>
<p>-16-<br />
Industries in the Sydney area which currently use fuel oil, anda<br />
which could use natural gas, should consider an early changeover.<br />
The proposed early commenement by A. G. L. of the natural<br />
gas pipeline to Newcastle will provide further opportunities<br />
for significant interfuel substitution.<br />
LPG: LPG has considerable potential for saving motor spirit<br />
in both the short and long term. Ultimately 10-15 per ( tent of<br />
Australia's motor vehicles could be powered by LPG.<br />
Last year the Government guaranteed an excise differential in<br />
favour of LPG against motor spirit. It has decided now<br />
* to remove -the 2.125 cents per litre tax presently<br />
charged on LPG for automotive usage<br />
* to remove -the 15 per cent sales tax presently<br />
applicable to kits used in vehicle conversion to<br />
LP G<br />
* to convert Commponwealth vehicles to LPG<br />
fuelling wherever feasible; in addition to the 100<br />
already being converted in Melbourne we will<br />
proceed with the conversion of:<br />
200 vehicles in Melbourne at an estimated<br />
cost of $ 200,000, and<br />
250 Vehicles in Canberra at an estimated<br />
cost of $ 250,000<br />
* at the completion of existing contracts, tenders<br />
for new vehid les for all Commonwealth departments and<br />
instrumentalities will wherever possible call for<br />
LPG fuel. In the first instance this will apply to<br />
Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra. It wil~ l apply to ocher<br />
States as adequate LPG outlets become available.<br />
The Commonwealth will be inviting the States to<br />
adopt a similar approach </p>
<p>17<br />
SOur objective is to have LPG fuelled vehicles<br />
built on production lines. To this end the<br />
Minister for Industry and Commerce will initiate<br />
discussions with the motor vehicle industry. He<br />
will also consult with industry on solving the<br />
present conversion bottleneck;<br />
Sthe Minister for Transport will initiate<br />
discussions with the State and Territory Ministers<br />
to ensure that proper safeguards are instituted and<br />
any unnecessary barriers are removed in the<br />
specification of requirements for new LPG fuelled<br />
vehicles, or for the modification and operation of<br />
existing vehicles using LPG fuel;<br />
to accelerate the work of the LPG Task Force<br />
established earlier this year to provide advice<br />
on practical aspects of greater usage of LPG and<br />
ways of overcoming constraints on its wider use<br />
in the Sydney market).<br />
Home Energy Use: A range of domestic space heating appliances<br />
consume oil. The Government wants to encourage greater use of<br />
heating appliances which do not use oil. All non-oil fuel space<br />
heating appliances of a kind ordinarily used for h1ousehold<br />
purposes and solar appliances of all kinds not already exempt<br />
from sales tax will therefore be made exempt after today.<br />
The necessary legislation will be introduced in the Budget<br />
Session to apply with effect from tomorrow. The cost to revenue<br />
is estimated to be $ 3m in a full year.<br />
Coal: Australia is already a substantial user of coal, particularly<br />
for power generation. Further studies will be made by the<br />
National Energy Advisory Committee of the scope for greater usage<br />
of coal, particularly as a fuel for industry. </p>
<p>18<br />
Petroleum Exploration and Development<br />
The Government has given major encouragement to petroleum<br />
exploration, by way of realistic pricing and taxation incentives.<br />
The Government is conscious of differences in incentives applying<br />
to offshore and onshore petroleum exploration and development<br />
and is examining the matter.<br />
The Government will give a new and upgraded role to the Bureau<br />
of Mineral Resources. The Bureau is to be made into a<br />
geoscientific research organisation with a substantial capacity<br />
to undertake the more sophisticated scientific studies required<br />
to support the fullest development of our resources. In this<br />
regard it will have an enhanced role in relation to the exploration<br />
for and assessment of Australian energy resources.<br />
Alternative Energy Sources<br />
Australia has a significant potential for producing liquid fuels<br />
which might be substituted for petroleum products or blended with<br />
them. These include shale oil, ethanol, methanol and coal<br />
liquefaction products. Some of these prospects are becoming<br />
economic as the price of crude oil rises. They have the added<br />
advantage that they would make Australia less dependent on<br />
imported crude oil, and correspondingly, less vulnerable to<br />
fluctuations in supply and price. Some of the prospects are<br />
already being explored by commercial interests.<br />
The Commonwealth will commence discusssions with the Queensland<br />
Government with a view to bringing the Rundle Oil Shale project<br />
to the stage of commercial development with a minimum of delay.<br />
/ 19 </p>
<p>19<br />
Demonstrated reserves of recoverable oil shale at Rundle are<br />
2000 million barrels of crude shale oil and gas. Average grade<br />
of the oil shale is 77 litres/ tonne.<br />
This compares with demonstrated resources of recoverable<br />
conventional crude oil totalling about 2) 00 million barrels.<br />
Australia has about 3600 million barrels of in-situ demonstrated<br />
resources of shale oil.<br />
The Commonwealth's policies will facilitate projects, accelerate<br />
energy research and development, and intensify economic<br />
assessments of the possibilities for developing alternative energy<br />
sources.<br />
Energy Research and Development<br />
The Government has already taken major initiatives to stimulate<br />
energy Research and Development in Australia.<br />
In 1978-79 178 projects worth $ 16.3m over three years were<br />
approved. Projects supported include:<br />
$ 4.50m for production of synthetic fuels from<br />
coal, biomass, oil shale and wastes;<br />
$ 3.13m for studies aimed at improving the<br />
efficiency of coal mining, handling and<br />
transportation. </p>
<p>The momentum achieved needs to be maintained.<br />
The Government will make provision in the 1979-80 Budget for<br />
expenditure on energy Research and Development of $ 9 million,<br />
compared with $ 4 million in 1978-79.<br />
Expenditure from the Coal Research Trust Account in 1979-80 i-s<br />
estimated to be about $ 5 million, making a total of $ 14 million<br />
for overall expenditure in 1979-80.<br />
The Government will establish an Energy Research Trust Account<br />
to complement the Coal Research Trust Account and to provide<br />
necessary flexibility in the administration of the National<br />
Research Program. In addition, the Government has decided to<br />
give approval for total forward commitments of $ 6 million, f or<br />
1980-81 and $ 3 million for commitments in 1981-82.<br />
An examination is also being made of the current research<br />
programmes of the Atomic Energy Commission with a view to<br />
widening its role to encompass non-nuclear energy research.<br />
The Commonwealth through the Australian Minerals and Energy<br />
Council, will also invite the States to join with it in<br />
establishing a Commonwealth-State Energy Research Liaison<br />
Committee to ensure close co-operation and co-ordination of<br />
energy research activities.<br />
ULrban Mass Transit<br />
In the long run, significant savings in the use of energy might<br />
be effected by means of improved, more efficient urban mass<br />
transit systems. / 21 </p>

Investigations are currently underway within the Australian<br />
Transport Advisory Council to assess the scope for energy<br />
savings in this area. These investigations cover such matters<br />
as the scope for greater use of rolling stock and vehicles in<br />
high density commuter corridors, additional rail electrification<br />
where economically feasible, intercity passenger and freight<br />
transport and rationalisation of services generally.<br />
Contingency Measures for Emergency Situations<br />
The policies I have outlined are of course designed to prevent<br />
emergency situations arising. But if such a situation should<br />
arise we have to be prepared to deal with it. There are a<br />
range of measures which will be adopted in such circumstances<br />
which, depending on the severity and duration of any emergency,<br />
range from restrictions on access to service stations and lower<br />
speed limits, to formal rationing.<br />
It is sufficient to say here that we have the relevant measures<br />
constantly under study. The Commonwealth, especially through<br />
Australian Minerals and EnergyCouncil and the Australian<br />
Transport Advisory Council, will maintain close consultation<br />
with the States to achieve a co-operative and consistent<br />
approach to measures that may be required.<br />
