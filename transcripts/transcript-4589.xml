FOR PRESS 7 DECEMBER 1977<br />
THE ELECTION CHOICE<br />
People have a clear choice in this election.<br />
Liberal policies of development and confidence our policies<br />
of success or Labor's policies of futility and fear,<br />
their policies of failure?<br />
There's no real choice. Labor's way just won't work.<br />
Australians now have an opportunity to move with the Liberals<br />
into the 1980' s arnd beyond with a new found confidence, a new<br />
spirit, a new sense of security and a new sense of national<br />
purpose. We've done the first stage of the job. Now we're ready to carry thiq<br />
momentum through into a new era of prosperity and development.<br />
That will mean jobs.<br />
We've brolken the back of inflation we've halved Labor's big<br />
spending deficit we're getting Australia on the move with<br />
$ 6,000 million of new developments ready to go.<br />
That will mean jobs.<br />
We've ended the Labor tax rip-off. Indexation had reduced<br />
everyone's personal taxes already. They will be cut again from the<br />
first of February. That will mean jobs.<br />
It will be worth working overtime again. We'll boost demand<br />
and jobs with another $ 26 million a week going into<br />
the economy.<br />
We're getting interest rates down. In the next 12 months that<br />
will save young couples buying a home $ 10 a week on repayments.<br />
A quarter of a million low income people pensioners, widows,<br />
students and others won't pay any tax or fill in a return<br />
after February.<br />
We have the real answers to N~ nemployment; a total approach.<br />
Investment means jobs; getting interest rates down mcans jobs;<br />
holding down wasteful spending by governmients cutting taxe-: s;<br />
halving inflation -that means jobs jobs people can keep. </p>
<p>We're spending $ 100 million for job assi!-Lancc and training.<br />
That helps peop-le of all ages learn new skills, find better<br />
jobs. And we're confidenL that unemployment will be Corning<br />
down from February onwards.<br />
The Liberals have a coherent, realistic programme of dynamic<br />
policies to meet Australia's needs. They are consistent,<br />
carefully costed0 Above all, they have been shown to work.<br />
With recovery underway, a new period of growth and expanding<br />
job opportunities is within our grasp. Thi~ s is an opportunity<br />
that might not come our way again for a long time if we<br />
let it slip past. We can be a stronger, richer, more<br />
mature and more caring society.<br />
Australians are ready to play their part in this return to<br />
prosperity. This Government the Liberal National Country Party Governmentis<br />
ready to lead our nation with firmness and fairness towards hat<br />
better future. </p>
