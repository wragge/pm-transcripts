KEATING, M. P. ABC AM PROGRAM<br />
SEATTLE, U. S. A.<br />
SATURDAY 20 NOVEMEBER, 1993<br />
E OE PROOF COPY<br />
GD: Is the decision to have another summit in Jakarta next year a sweet victory?<br />
PM: Well. I think, rather than a sweet victory I think it's a very pleasing achievement<br />
to see Australian diplomacy reach the point where it has taken the interests of not<br />
just the United States but most of the major countries of South East Asia and<br />
North Asia, to come together over this weekend to form, for the first time, a<br />
meeting of the APEC leaders and to agree that the meeting was so successful as<br />
to go on again and do it again.<br />
GD: But, doing it again does roll over some of the scepticism that was coming from<br />
some of the Asian leaders coming into this meeting, doesn't it?<br />
PM: Well, yes, it may well do. But, I don't think there was so much scepticism as<br />
there was some caution, about APEC. As I've said before, there's no road map<br />
with APEC, this is all new so people have got to try and find their way around<br />
where it's leading from an information secretariat, which it first was, to a body<br />
which is drawing a lot of executive power and a lot of executive attention. I think<br />
the people have convinced themselves that it is very much in their interests that<br />
the largest economy in the world, the United States, and the second largest<br />
economy, Japan, and one of the emerging economies, China for the three of<br />
them to multilateralise themselves, that is, to subject themselves to disciplines and<br />
dispute settling mechanisms of an organisation like A. PEC there is a<br />
recognition that they have given something up for something greater. r r U fC ci c-</p>
<p>And, hence, a willingness on the part of the rest of the countries involved to take<br />
this at face value and to take it on for the very important body that I think it will<br />
become.<br />
GD: In terms of the Malaysian fears though, about APEC overshadowing ASEAN,<br />
ASEAN has had about four summits in about 25 years, you're looking at getting<br />
two APEC summits in five years is that proof that APEC is growing very<br />
quickly?<br />
PM: I think APEC has grown very, very rapidly but I think it needs to. That is, that the<br />
growth of the Asia-Pacific, which is important now to all of us, does have<br />
bottlenecks about it. We've had spectacular growth of quite small economies<br />
spectacular growth of, in some cases, small levels of activity. So, you can get<br />
very high growth. As these economies get larger it is not so easy to continue<br />
these growth rates and there will be bottlenecks in infrastructure, in power, in<br />
hydrocarbons, in all sorts of things. And, I think that is where some general<br />
attention, on the part of major governments, to these questions can continue to see<br />
growth, or will facilitate growth, into the future. I think most of the APEC<br />
constituency recognises that and knows that to be important and needing to be<br />
addressed.<br />
GD: How much further has APEC moved towards becoming a policy making body?<br />
PM: Well, the fact that it has, sitting in its leadership group, the President of the United<br />
States, the Prime Minister of Japan, the President of China, the President of<br />
Indonesia and other heads of government, means that it has an enormously<br />
powerful set of sponsors. And so, therefore, it can undertake executive tasks and<br />
it can get them done.<br />
GD: Because of those sponsors is APEC going to be able to drag along the doubters,<br />
such as Malaysia which talks about Australia being too extreme, pushing too hard<br />
trying to get an Asia-Pacific community and free trade?<br />
PM: Well, look, Malaysia is represented ministerially at this, I think it would have<br />
been better in Malaysian terms had the Malaysian Prime Minister come. But,<br />
again, that issue was decided some time ago, it took no attention this weekend<br />
whatsoever. APEC is going to be bigger than any one of its constituent members<br />
and that includes Malaysia.<br />
GD: The vision statement that you put out talked of a new voice in the Asia-Pacific, a<br />
new voice on the world stage. What sort of voice do you think it is going to be?<br />
PM: Well, APEC's not going to be a European Community-type structure, it's not<br />
going to be a Brussels-type supra-national organisation that makes decisions for<br />
national governments. It's not going to be that, there's going to be no Treaty of </p>
<p>Rome equivalent or Maastricht Treaty or the endorsement of those treaties by<br />
nation states. It will be a much looser, cooperative body, but, I think, no less<br />
effective because these economies have already proved that they can grow and<br />
grow quite spectacularly. And, given a bit of help and direction, can do much<br />
better. But, APEC provides such enormous opportunities to, if you like, deal with<br />
the interests of the United States and Japan and China and just so many other<br />
important economies like Korea and Indonesia etc. And ourselves. This is the<br />
first time Australia has really sat at a very big table, in its own right. Years ago,<br />
the question was, could we get into the GI10 or maybe, perhaps, in our dreams, the<br />
G7? It was always, you know, would we be let into something? What has<br />
happened here is Australian diplomacy, with the help of others, fashioned<br />
something else, something new, which I think will become a major body and of<br />
which it is a full constituent member.<br />
GD: Does that picture of President Clinton and the Asian leaders, does that picture<br />
send a real jolt to Europe? Does it say to Europe if there's not a result in the<br />
Uruguay Round that it won't be a three block world but, that it will be the<br />
Americans joining Asia to face Europe?<br />
PM: No, I don't necessarily think that and it won't be a three-bloc world whatever<br />
happens because I think the advent of APEC means we won't see the Americas<br />
bloc up with NAFTA and we won't see a yen bloc in Asia. But, rather, we will<br />
see, sensibly, the melding of interests of North and South Asia and the Western<br />
Pacific. Essentially, that is what APEC has accomplished. It's pulled together the<br />
policy interests of North and South Asia and the United States, North America,<br />
Canada and Mexico. So, it will behave as a trading area. This will be noticed in<br />
Europe because it means...<br />
GD: A bit of a scare for Europe?<br />
PM: No, well it's not designed for that. But, it will be noticed in Europe and some of<br />
that sort of smugness that Europe has about its importance it means that the<br />
United States, which already has a preponderance of its trade in the Pacific<br />
$ 300 billion of its trade is in the Pacific, $ 200 billion in the Atlantic well<br />
obviously the $ 300 billion is going to grow faster in the Pacific than the $ 200<br />
billion in the Atlantic. And these other economies are making markets<br />
themselves. See, APEC is very integrated. It's more integrated than the European<br />
Community now. 66% of its exports are traded within its own member states,<br />
where the equivalent figure in the European Community is 61 And the<br />
equivalent figure for NAFTA is 42%. So, APEC's already.. there's already<br />
tremendous trade between APEC member states and, therefore, the dependency<br />
on Europe is going to be less and less as time goes by. Therefore, there's a<br />
message in this for the Europeans they shouldn't be too cocky about their<br />
importance. </p>
<p>GD: Is APEC on its way to being as equal in importance as, say, the G7, or being more<br />
able to move policy along than the G7 has been able to over the last few years?<br />
PM: APEC will be far more focused because it will have, all the time, common<br />
interests which the G7 has never had. You've got the United States and Japan,<br />
Germany, Italy, Britain, Canada it's such a disparate group, the G7 couldn't<br />
effectively be the kind of body that APEC is capable of being.<br />
GD: The big bilateral out of this was the meeting between the Presidents of China and<br />
America, the first bilateral since Tiananmen Square. Do you think that APEC can<br />
give a sort of structure which will allow these to deal with the problems they have<br />
over human rights, that issue the Americans have been hammering China on?<br />
PM: I think so. A very important thing about this meeting was the chemistry and<br />
atmospherics of the meeting which, as it went on, were pretty spectacular. The<br />
relationship of everyone, after a day or two, started to get much more, not just<br />
more friendly, but more prepared to talk about things, more confident of one<br />
another. Now, give this a few years and of course this will dramatically improve<br />
relations. It's not to say that countries won't keep their interests but it means<br />
they'll be able to open topics up in a non hostile environment. In fact, a much<br />
easier environment with APEC rather than, say, a foreign policy environment.<br />
And the bilaterals are important. I had the opportunity myself of talking to the<br />
President of China, the Prime Minister of Japan, the Prime Minister of Thailand,<br />
amongst others, the President of Korea. These are all useful and valuable<br />
discussions. In one place you can do so many things. Now, this will be true for<br />
the whole body so APEC will be able to transact business probably beyond its<br />
agenda, by mere virtue of the fact that these people will be talking civilly and<br />
sanely and harmoniously together.<br />
GD: Finally then, if this was summit number one, a getting to know you summit, what<br />
does that make summit number two in Jakarta next year?<br />
PM: Well, I think, in the meantime we have decided to do quite a few things. We've<br />
decided to, in the first place, support a successful conclusion of the Uruguay<br />
Round, to seek there to establish over the course of the year work on a common,<br />
non-binding set of investment principles a first step towards a regional<br />
investment agreement. We're going to be examining links between energy use in<br />
the area, which is going to be vast, and the environment. Also, to set up a<br />
business group which will have two members of the business community of each<br />
country from it and adopt, also, the work of the Ministerial Committee here for<br />
consideration next year. So, there's going to be quite an agenda, this thing will<br />
have work to do.<br />
And, as you enquired about human rights... I was able, for instance, to talk to the<br />
President about Hong Kong I stressed there the importance of a smooth </p>
<p>transition, of the protection of peoples' rights. I've got no doubt President Clinton<br />
did the same with the U. S. concerns about human rights and China. The mere fact<br />
that you've got this leadership coming together in a forum where you can have a<br />
meeting and discuss things means that you can obviously discuss things beyond<br />
the trade and investment framework.<br />
GD: You talked about it in historic terms, I suppose I should ask you if it struck<br />
you as historic, your personal reaction to this meeting with this diverse range of<br />
leaders?<br />
PM: Oh yes. I have got no doubt about the historic nature of it. Because, there you are<br />
with this amazing group half the world's production, 40% of the world's<br />
population sitting there, chatting away in a group, at a table. Talking freely on<br />
the boat on the way out, you know, swapping the odd story, finding the odd<br />
amusing thing. It was highly unusual to see such a collection of people, all<br />
focused on the one task. From the President of the United States down through<br />
the Pacific economies.<br />
GD: Thank you, Prime Minister.<br />
PM: Thank you.<br />
Ends. </p>
