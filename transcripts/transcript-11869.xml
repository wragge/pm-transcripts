<p>E&amp;OE................................</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Can I ask you a quick question about the interest rates in the US?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Cut by 0.5%. What effect do you think that could have the Australian economy?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, what it does indicate is a determination by the monetary authorities in the United States to aid growth in that country and that's always a good thing.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Do you think Australia should possibly follow that sort of lead?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh, that's a matter for the Reserve Bank, I am not going to give the Reserve Bank any advice.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Are the conditions in Australia similar to the conditions in the United States?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good try Tom.</p>
