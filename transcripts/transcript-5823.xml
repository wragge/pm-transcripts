FOR MEDIA WEDNESDAY, 2 JUNE 1982<br />
SPEECH TO THE NATIONAL PRESS CLUB<br />
I have accepted your invitation today in order to<br />
address a topic of profound and indisputable<br />
importance the disturbing economic situation in which<br />
the world finds itself and the need for concerted action<br />
and leadership to turn around the world's economic<br />
fortunes. Three weeks ago, Cabinet took the decision that<br />
Australia should put forward a package of three<br />
proposals for consideration in the context of the<br />
Versailles Summit, and Cabinet agreed that if the seven<br />
summit countries would adopt these three proposals, then<br />
Australia would immediately join in. The substance of<br />
the proposals a standstill on existing and new forms<br />
of protectionism; a commitment to abolish export<br />
incentives and subsidies over a five year period; and a<br />
comnmitment: to significant and progressive reductions in<br />
overall p!-otection would by now be known to everybody<br />
here. The Government took this decision because we believed<br />
that unless definite proposals were put forward there<br />
would be much less chance of achieving the kind of<br />
action required to break out of the circle in which<br />
negative economic influences constantly reinforce one<br />
another and in which individual countries are<br />
increasingly driven towards the ' beggar-thy-neighbour'<br />
approach of rising protectionism.<br />
At that time the Government was not aware of any<br />
alternative sets of proposals coming forward to achieve<br />
effective action at the Summit and in fact no other<br />
proposals of this kind have yet been placed on the<br />
table. it should therefore surprise nobody that the proposals<br />
which I p-it to President Reagan in Washington and which<br />
have subsequently been discussed and considered by a<br />
number of world leaders have been received with a degree </p>
<p>of interest which must be heartening to anyone who<br />
really hopes for progress. So I want to talk further<br />
today about the relevance and appropriateness of our<br />
proposals to the current economic situation, about the<br />
impact and benefits which would flow from them, and<br />
about the quality and significance of the support which<br />
has been extended to them.<br />
In formulating its proposals, the Australian Government<br />
was acutely aware that in spite of seven previous annual<br />
summit meetings world economic conditions today are in<br />
some important respects worse than when the first summit<br />
meeting Nas held in France seven years ago; and in spite<br />
of the considerable success that Australia has had in<br />
swimming against the tide of world economic recession<br />
the longer that recession continues, the more Australia<br />
is bound to be affected.<br />
The reality is that although oil prices have been<br />
falling, although inflationary pressures have been<br />
decreasing in most major economies particularly in the<br />
United States where, in March, the CPI actually fell for<br />
the first time since 1965, there are few signs that a<br />
strong and durable recovery is imminent. Indeed, real<br />
interest rates, especially in the United States, remain<br />
at historically unprecedented levels, suggesting that<br />
inflationary expectations remain entrenched; in large<br />
measure 1L-ecause of the apparent difficulty of getting<br />
acceptable budget deficits.<br />
Moreover, the growth of Output among major O. E. C. D.<br />
countries continues to decline; the volume of world<br />
trade has stagnated, and actually fell in value in 1981<br />
for the first time in over 20 years; unemployment<br />
already high is rising and set to exceed 30 million<br />
people ir the industrialised countries of the O. E. C. D.<br />
during this year. And, against this background of<br />
economic stress, a growing tide of protectionism and<br />
dangers ef retaliation seriously weaken prospects for<br />
building recovery. In seeking a way out of these<br />
economic difficulties renewed growth in trade is vital.<br />
The experience of the 1950' s and 1960' s is a clear<br />
illustration of this for through those years the volume<br />
of world trade grew at an average annual rate of about<br />
providing rapidly expanding employment<br />
opportunities and leading to G. D. P. growth rates that<br />
could double people's real incomes every 20 years or<br />
less. Buit it is clear that in a world where governments<br />
are beset. by the social and political pressures that<br />
naturally come with continued recession and increasing<br />
unemployment, where the pressures for measures that<br />
would restrict rather than expand trade are intense<br />
indeed, trade can only be restored to its place as an </p>
<p>engine of growth and prosperity if governments and<br />
peoples from many countries are prepared to show a<br />
willingness and a will to join together and adopt a<br />
common ani comprehensive strategy to wind back the<br />
barriers which constrain achievement of the economic<br />
revival which everybody seeks.<br />
The package of measures which Australia has proposed to<br />
the summit participants addresses this fact head on.<br />
Indeed, because of its breadth and scope, because it<br />
offers opportunities to everyone which far outweigh any<br />
difficulties which countries might find in implementing<br />
certain parts of it, it has the quality of<br />
comprehensiveness which the situation plainly requires.<br />
To be effective, our package would need to be adopted by<br />
countries acting together.<br />
Indeed action of this sort and scale would not be<br />
possible for any country acting alone, nor would it meet<br />
the problem for any particular country in isolation to<br />
do so. Each component of cur package has its own<br />
contribution to make, if adopted by nations in common.<br />
A standstill on the spread of protectionism would not<br />
only reduce the threat ol retaliation and the danger of<br />
increasing economic isolationism, but it would also<br />
reduce an important source of inflationary pressure; a<br />
progressive reduction in overall levels of protection<br />
should actually help to reduce prices and stimulate<br />
overall c6emand and production, while encouraging<br />
restructuring of domestic industries in directions<br />
consistert with comparative advantage; and a winding<br />
back of export incentives and subsidies would eliminate<br />
wasteful and futile competition, and free resources<br />
which could be used to cut taxes and stimulate<br />
investmen~ t.<br />
But it is; as a total package that these measures would<br />
0 offer a basis for strong, non-inflationary, and<br />
sustainable growth in the industrialised countries.<br />
Australia has done what it can by agreeing in advance to<br />
adopt the proposals if the summit nations themselves<br />
agree to do so. Indeed it is a matter of enlightened<br />
self-interest for us, as for all trading nations, to<br />
agree to implement them in co-operation with one<br />
another. In Australia's own case, it is evident that<br />
opportun-. ties for trade are vastly important to our<br />
prosperit~ y, for the annual value of our international<br />
trade is equivalent to over one third our gross domestic<br />
product and we need trade with large and growing<br />
overseas markets to develop our full potential to create<br />
growing employment opportunities and rising living<br />
standards. </p>
<p>When overs5eas economic conditions are poor, the<br />
Australian economy is bound to be affected. And while<br />
we are far from the worst affected country, while we<br />
have showni that we have the capacity to help<br />
ourselves, the longer world recession continues, the<br />
longer protectionism persists and the further it<br />
spreads, the more it will affect Australia.<br />
But it is not only the wealthy industrialised countries,<br />
including Australia, which would benefit from<br />
implementation of our proposal. The developing<br />
countries, also stand to benefit enormously if they can<br />
obtain greater access for their products to markets<br />
which are at present closed to them. Indeed, we believe<br />
that a high priority should be given to significant<br />
reductions in protection in areas of interest to<br />
developing countries, not least because their interests<br />
were treated inequitably in the Tokyo round of<br />
multi-lateral trade negotiations. Opening their own<br />
markets to developing countries is also in the<br />
enlightened self-interest of the developed nations for<br />
it would inevitably help to boost trade in both<br />
directions. Er believe that our proposals can in effect be seen as a<br />
significant step towards breaking the current global<br />
negotiations impasse, because of the benefits which they<br />
could bring to developing nations. By the same token,<br />
support for the proposals from the developing<br />
countries in the form of undertakings to reduce their<br />
own protection measures could add real strength to their<br />
momentum. Before turning to the quality and significance of the<br />
support which has been extended to our proposals, it is<br />
important to realise that the Government would not claim<br />
that these are the only proposals worth considering or<br />
that protectionism is the only issue to be tackled. But<br />
we do believe that these proposals, or others like them,<br />
are vital to the achievement of economic revival and<br />
nobody has come forward to deny that. The proposals<br />
themselves have helped to crystallize a good deal of<br />
thinking about the need to address the protectionism<br />
issue and I believe that the fact that they have been<br />
brought forward as a possible circuit breaker, has<br />
focussed many people's attention on the need for the<br />
Versailles Summit to result in positive action.<br />
obviously the gover nments with whom we have discussed<br />
the proposals, especially those taking part in the<br />
summit, have not been in a position to commit themselves<br />
directly or immediately to adopt the proposals: indeed<br />
we did not seek any commitments. It is not surprising </p>
<p>that various governimients, depending on their particular<br />
practices and situation, should have greater initial<br />
difficulty in supporting some partz of the package than<br />
others. 3ut in the course of our discussions, there has<br />
been virtially universal acceptance of the underlying<br />
principles of our proposals and the proposals<br />
themselves have been seen as sensible and effective in<br />
advancing the interests of all, if they are adopted<br />
multilaterally. We have been advised that they are receiving detailed<br />
and serious consideration with a view to discussing them<br />
at Versailles and subsequently in other forums. Their<br />
logic has been described as impeccable. It has been<br />
said that they should not come to be regarded as another<br />
superficial exercise, and the view has been expressed<br />
that they should be pursued further regardless of the<br />
outcome of Versailles. In fact, I believe that both<br />
this Government and many of the international supporters<br />
of these proposals will want to ensure that they are<br />
carried forward beyond Versailles, although as one of<br />
the Summit leaders has said, if Versailles has no<br />
concrete results, the loss will never be recovered.<br />
It is also worth noting that our proposals have received<br />
support from influential sources beyond governments.<br />
The OECD Director-General Van Lennep has strongly<br />
endorsed them as an interesting and bold initiative; the<br />
Secretary-General of the United Nations De Cueller has<br />
expressed interest in them and would be taking them with<br />
him during his forthcoming visit to Europe. The<br />
President of the World Bank, Clausen, has recently<br />
argued the need for the adoption of policies along the<br />
lines of our proposals. There has been support for them<br />
from within the Commonwealth, in particular from the<br />
Secretary-General Ramphal. And in a new national<br />
security strategy recently announced by U. S. National<br />
Security Adviser, William Clark, the importance of a<br />
more open trading system has been emphasised as a basis<br />
for strengthening political and strategic security as<br />
well as economic security.<br />
It is obvious that proposals of this kind are certain to<br />
face practical difficulties in implementation. There<br />
will be c. ifficulties in deciding whether some practices<br />
fall inside or outside their scope; there are likely to<br />
be political considerations which need to be taken into<br />
accou~ nt; and there are strong pressure groups whose<br />
demands will need to be faced. In this regard, I have<br />
been greEtly encouraged by the attitude taken towards<br />
these proposals by the Australian community and by the<br />
leaders of industrial and commercial groups within<br />
Austral ia. </p>
<p>The Government took steps to consult and advise industry<br />
and other leaders about our proposals on the eve of<br />
making them public and I regard the response as<br />
tremendously positive and as indicative of a<br />
determination within the Australian community to make<br />
sure that we do everything we can as a nation to<br />
maintain economic growth and progress. It is that kind<br />
of positive response, from business and governments,<br />
that is needed in all countries for, unless action of<br />
some kind is taken to break out of the circle, human and<br />
political costs arising from prolonged world recession<br />
could in nany places be far greater than the immediate<br />
difficulties which so easily divert attention from the<br />
really important objectives.<br />
It is because these costs could be so great that the<br />
present situation calls out for effective action and<br />
leadership from the summit. The world desperately needs<br />
the kind Df vision and commitment which was forthcoming<br />
only a few decades ago in initiatives like the Marshall<br />
Plan, the Bretton Woods Agreement, the establishment of<br />
the World Bank, and the institution of the liberal<br />
system of trade and payments which took place after the<br />
world war.<br />
Those initiatives were designed to meet a situation in<br />
many ways analagous to that which we now face. They<br />
were decisive in securing the kind of growth and<br />
prosperity which people came to take for granted in the<br />
1950' s an-1960' s and which it must be the objective of<br />
all parties, all governments and all countries to<br />
re-establish in the 1980' s.<br />
