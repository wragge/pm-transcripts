    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Prime Minister announced today that the Government had decided to establish a centre for Aboriginal studies.. The centre would be known as "The Australian Institute for Aboriginal Studies".</p>
<p>Opportunities for further study and understanding of the unique culture of Australia's aborigines are dwindling rapidly with the passage of time. With this in mind, the Government has decided that it should help to stimulate further studies in the field. The Prime Minister stressed that it was the scientific, cultural and anthropological aspects of the field to which the new body would direct its attention.</p>
<p> As a first step, an Interim Council has been appointed to handle and develop these activities until a permanent body is established, and to advise on the functions and scope of the new body. The Interim Council will work in close co-operation with State authorities, with museums and with Universities.</p>
<p><strong>Members of the Interim Council are:</strong></p>
<p>Professor A. D. TRENDATL, C. M. G. ( Chairman) Master of University House, Australian National University.</p>
<p>Dr. W. E. H. STANNER, Department of Anthropology, Australian National University.</p>
