EMBARGO: 7.30 p. m.<br />
NATIONAL BROADCAST BY THE PRIME MINISTER, MR E. G. WHITLAM, M. P.,<br />
TUESDAY, 16 APRIL 1974<br />
On 18 May we Australians will take part in an historic<br />
expression of the will of the people. There is to be an election for<br />
both Houses of the national Parliament, for the House of Representatives<br />
and for the whole of the Senate. Further, you are being asked to<br />
approve certain proposals to enshrine in the Australian Constitution<br />
some basic democratic guarantees. I freely acknowledge the burden<br />
of decision all these matters impose upon you. In the next four weeks<br />
I shall be asking you all to think deeply on the profound issues<br />
involved. And on 18 May I shall ask you to spend 5 minutes in the<br />
voting booth 5 minutes for the future of Australia.<br />
Tonight I want simply to tell you how the present<br />
situation has come about how the Government you elected less than<br />
1 years-ago was robbed of the power to govern effectively by<br />
senators you elected, some 3h years ago and others 6 years ago. It is<br />
now clear that these senators and our opponents in general the<br />
innumerable parties and factions which make up the Opposition and<br />
presumably represent the alternative government never really accepted<br />
your verdict of 2 December 1972. They were never prepared to give our<br />
government a fair go, a chance to carry out the program you endorsed.<br />
The Leader of the Opposition in the Senate let the cat out of the-bag<br />
well and truly last Wednesday when he stated that the Opposition in<br />
the Senate embarked on a course some 12 months ago to bring about a<br />
House of Representatives election. And as early as April a year ago,<br />
they first threatened to put this decision into effect by rejecting<br />
a money bill. In each of the three sessions of the 28th Parliament,<br />
the threat has been made. It was made good at last on Wednesday.<br />
A chance majority in the Senate a majority reflecting<br />
deisions you made in elections in 1967 and 1970 put into their hands<br />
a powerful weaposi to bring about the end of the Government you elected<br />
only 17 months ago. In the five weeks the Australian Parliament has<br />
sat this year the Liberals, the Country Party and the D. L. P. have<br />
combined to defeat the Government on 42 out of the 43 occasions when<br />
votes were taken in the Senate. Many bills the senators rejected or<br />
stalled or sabotaged were crucial parts of the program I put to you<br />
in the election campaign of 1972.<br />
You, the people, will now be able to use the rights which<br />
the Constitution gives to settle many of the matters upon which the<br />
Senate has twice rejected bills passed by the House of Representatives.<br />
Four of these bills were for referendums to alter the<br />
Constitution. The Senate opposed your having a vote on any of these<br />
issues, even those recommended as far back as 1958. But where the<br />
Senate twice rejects referendum proposals, the Constitution gives you,<br />
the people, the right to vote on them regardless. / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
Then there are the six bills on which the Governor-General<br />
has said that the Government was entitled to have a dissolution of<br />
both the Houses. Two of these bills were to fulfil the program of<br />
universal health insurance which I put to the people in 1969 and 1970<br />
and 1972. Another was to establish the Petroleum and Minerals Authority;<br />
it will give Australians a share in the control and ownership of those<br />
resources which hitherto the taxpayer has spent over $ 50 million a year<br />
in subsidising investors to discover and keep. By your votes you can<br />
assure the passage of these measures.<br />
There are another nine bills which the Senate has rejected,<br />
all bills ' which we promised at the last elections to introduce.<br />
I shall specify two of them, both of which, remarkably enough, had been<br />
originally introduced by Liberal or Country Party ministers. One of<br />
the bills was to extend the Trade Practices legislation, first<br />
conceived by Sir Garfield Barwick in 1962 and introduced by Mr Snedden<br />
in 1965; my government proposed to outlaw price fixing by collusion<br />
between companies. Three times since September the Senate has refused<br />
even to debate this bill. Another bill -was to expand the resources<br />
of the Australian Industry Development corporation in order to increase<br />
the proportion of Australian ownership in important national industries;<br />
this the Senate shelved.<br />
Thus, step by step, month by month, our opponents<br />
established a pattern of obstruction and violence to our legislative<br />
program. But until last week they baulked at the ultimate obstruction,<br />
the refusal to supply the Government with the money it needs to govern.<br />
Sure they had threatened it 3 times, but backed away at the crunch.<br />
Well might they hesitate on the brink of such a constitutional disaster.<br />
A basic principle of democracy is that the control over the people's<br />
money must lie firmly in the people's House, the House of Representatives.<br />
This is why those who command a majority in the people's House form the<br />
Government of the country, whether or not they have a majority in the<br />
Senate. No less an authority than Sir Robert Menzies has properly<br />
branded such action by the Senate as a falsification of democracy.<br />
Yet such were the depths of their bitterness, their resentment at your<br />
refusal to trust them any longer with your affairs that they were<br />
prepared to do this: last week they did it.<br />
Accordingly, I had no choice but to ask the GovernQr-General<br />
to dissolve a Parliament which had become unworkable, a Parliament in<br />
which the fundamental conditions for effective responsible government<br />
of this country had ceased to exist. And so on this matter, in<br />
Sir Paul Hasluck's own words in reply to my request, the people of<br />
Australia are to pass their judgement on 18 May. We are to have a<br />
fresh parliament, a contemporary parliament, a parliament which will<br />
reflect the wishes and the hopes of the Australian people in 1974, a<br />
parliament which no longer will be dominated by the men of yesterday.<br />
Despite the Senate obstruction of the past 16 months, the<br />
Government you elected for 3 years in 1972 has succeeded in carrying<br />
out to a remarkable, unprecedented extent the pledges we gave to you.<br />
I venture to say that no elected Government in modern history has so<br />
promptly, so amply fulfilled so much of its undertaking. It has been a<br />
Government of achievement, purpose and vigour. Australia never stood<br />
so high in the world. At home the herculean task of clearing away the<br />
accumulated dead wood of 23 years has been set in train with vigor and<br />
compassion. Our schools have been given a new deal. The whole system<br />
of social welfare is being transformed. We have begun with a will to<br />
rebuild our existing cities and build new ones. </p>
<p>-3-<br />
What is the alternative to our record? The men who never<br />
really accepted your decision of 1972 now ask you to reverse that<br />
decision. They offer you no policies, no believable policies. Their<br />
leader dares not unveil his own party's supposed platform. He makes<br />
vague promises about tax cuts which are promptly repudiated by his<br />
master, the Leader of the Country Party. The man who as Treasurer,<br />
produced Australia's worst unemployment for a decade, produces an economic<br />
hodge podge dragged out of him bit by contradictory bit by journalists.<br />
It has been properly described by the leading financial writers and<br />
journals of Australia as a recipe for disaster. The Opposition in<br />
reality offers only a return to the same policies, the same men, the<br />
same attitudes that you so firmly rejected in 1972. They are united<br />
in only one thing, hatred, there is no other word for it hatred<br />
of the Whitlam Government and indeed hatred and contempt for the people<br />
who elected us. This is a coalition of hate.<br />
My fellow Australians, I do not conceal from you that the<br />
times ahead will require strong leadership and tough decisions. We<br />
are sharing in vast world problems which at bottom represent a crisis<br />
of confidence in democracy itself. In such times, in such a crisis,<br />
how could you conceivably trust the men who have just done such violence<br />
to Australia's own democratic process? In 1972 I came before you with<br />
the most detailed, and comprehensive program ever placed before the<br />
Australian people. In the weeks to come I will not be putting forward a<br />
new program but rather the new dimensions and the expanded fruits of the<br />
program we have been trying to implement. I seek your support in<br />
the fullest sense, not just your votes, but support and help and<br />
co-operation from you the people of Australia in the great business of<br />
leading this nation towards the fulfilment of its unlimited promise.<br />
Do not turn back; do not turn your back upon the future of Australia. </p>
