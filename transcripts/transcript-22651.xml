    <content><![CDATA[<p>Today I am pleased to release the final report of the Uranium Mining, Processing and Nuclear Energy Taskforce.</p>
<p>The report provides a thorough examination of all aspects of the nuclear fuel cycle and the possible role of nuclear power in generating electricity in Australia in the longer term.  It provides a clear and comprehensive analysis of the facts surrounding the nuclear industry and debunks a number of myths.  I am certain that the report will make a significant contribution to informing public debate on these issues.</p>
<p>I would like to take this opportunity to thank Dr Ziggy Switkowski, Professor George Dracoulis, Dr Arthur Johnston, Professor Peter Johnston, Professor Warwick McKibbin and Mr Martin Thomas as well as the Secretariat, for their work in preparing this report.</p>
<p>The report demonstrates clearly that there are no sound reasons to prevent uranium mining in Australia and that the global growth in uranium demand provides a timely opportunity for Australia.  I call upon state governments to end their bans on uranium mining and exploration, which stand in the way of investment, jobs and exports.</p>
<p>The report's analysis of the relative greenhouse gas emissions and costs associated with different forms of electricity generation will be available for consideration by the Emissions Trading Taskforce, which is to report by the end of May 2007.</p>
<p>The issues examined in this report are challenging and merit serious consideration by the community.  The Government will give careful thought to the report's findings.  Some of these concern current issues, such as the performance of the Commonwealth's regulatory framework and the supply of skilled personnel, which the Government will look to respond to at an early date.</p>
