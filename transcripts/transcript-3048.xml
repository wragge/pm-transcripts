PRIME MINISTER 1<br />
Press Statement No. 142<br />
24 October 1973<br />
BEGINNING OF NATIONAL MUSICAL INSTRUMENT COLLECTION<br />
The Prime Minister announced today that he had<br />
approved the purchase of two 18th-century cellos made<br />
by the Italian master, Giuseppe Guarmeri~ in 1710 and 1721.<br />
The cellos and bows have been purchased in New York<br />
for a total price of $ 54,950. They will be the foundation<br />
of a national collection of great instruments. Their<br />
purchase was recommended by the Music Board of the<br />
Australian Council for the Arts.<br />
The Chairman of the Music Board, Australian composer,<br />
Don Banks, in recommending the purchase, said that the cellos<br />
were two of the world's finest instruments, and would be a<br />
tremendous asset to the musical life of Australia.<br />
They would be available to Australia's leading<br />
cellists and to vis iting performers giving concerts in<br />
Australia. He said there were cases overseas where instruments<br />
of similar quality were used as inducements to attract fine<br />
performers to work in certain cities or to be retained in<br />
leading positions in orchestras and chamber music groups.<br />
He said that such instruments were becoming<br />
increasingly rare and the price paid was a very fair one.<br />
In a few years it would inevitably have gone up considerably<br />
as competition for these instruments is constantly increasing.<br />
Giuseppe Guarneri, one of a famous family of instrument<br />
makers, was the father of the celebrated Giuseppe Guarneri del<br />
Gesu, who made many famous violins, but no cellos.<br />
