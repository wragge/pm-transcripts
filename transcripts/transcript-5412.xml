COMMONWEALTH ASSISTANCE TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT<br />
Following implementation of the Government's undertaking to<br />
increase to the percentage allocation of personal income<br />
tax collections to local government, local authorities will<br />
this year receive a massive 35.65%~ increase in general<br />
revenue assistance.<br />
Premiers have been advised that $ 300.79 million will be made<br />
available to the States for passing to local government<br />
authorities as general revenue assistance in 1980-81 under<br />
arrangements provided by the Commonwealth in the Local<br />
Government ( Personal Income Tax Sharing) Act 1976.<br />
The amounts to be paid to each State in 1980-81, together<br />
with the corresponding amoutns for 1979-80 are:<br />
Local Government Tax Sharing Entitlements 1979-80 1980-81<br />
$ m $ m<br />
New South Wales 80.93 109.78<br />
Victoria 56.44 76.55<br />
Queensland 37.39 50.71<br />
South Australia 19.07 25.87<br />
Western Australia 20.82 28.24<br />
Tasmania 7.09 9.62<br />
Total ( rounded) 221.74 300.79<br />
The funds provided to the States under these arrangements are<br />
allocated to individual local government authorities by the<br />
States. Under general guidelines provided in the Commonwealth<br />
legislation, at least 30%~ of the funds are to be distributed<br />
to all Councils on a per capita basis, which may be weighted<br />
for area or population density, with the balance being<br />
allocated on a needs basis which is the subject of prior<br />
inquiry and report by the individual State Grants Commissions. / 2 </p>

The funds will be made available to the States for<br />
payment to each local government authority as soon as<br />
possible after the States Grants Commissions have completed<br />
their assessments and the Minister Assisting the<br />
Prime Minister in Federal Affairs has been notified that<br />
the proposed distribution is in accordance with the<br />
legislation.<br />
. General revenue assistance to local government has<br />
increased from $ 80 million under the previous Labor Government<br />
to $ 140 million in 1976-77, $ 165 million in 1977-78,<br />
$ 179.4 million in 1978-79, $ 221.74 million in 1979-80 and<br />
$ 300.79 million for 1980-81. As a result, local government<br />
will have received over $ 1,000 million in untied grants<br />
in the five years of the tax sharing arrangements.<br />
In addition to the funds provided to the States, the<br />
Commonwealth has made provision, under the Memorandum of<br />
Understanding between the Commonwealth and the Northern<br />
Territory, for an amount of $ 1.440 million to be made<br />
available in 1980-81 to the Northern Territory Government<br />
for on-forwarding to the local government authorities in<br />
the Territory ($ 1.062 million in 1979-80).<br />
The Commonwealth Government's tax sharing arrangements have<br />
thus provided a very substantial and rapidly growing source<br />
of funds to local government bodies throughout the country.<br />
Just as importantly, the funds are provided without<br />
strings giving local governments the freedom, and the<br />
responsibility, to determine their own expenditure priorities.<br />
