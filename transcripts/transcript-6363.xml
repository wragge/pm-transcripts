PRIME MINISTER<br />
E. O. E. PROOF ONLY<br />
Partial Transcript, PRIME MINISTER INTERVIEWED-BY<br />
JOHN LAWS, 2UE, 11/ 4/ 84<br />
LAWS: Speaking of international markets it would appear that<br />
we have a problem with the Japanese decision on beef imports.<br />
That's going to hurt us a bit, isn't it?<br />
Well, it's too early to say. And I' must say John that I'm<br />
terribly disappointed, and I think it's a disappointment that<br />
you would share with me that the Federal Opposition have broken<br />
a rule a long standing rule of politics that where a Government<br />
is engaged in negotiations on behalf of Australia with anothercountry<br />
to try and protect markets and get increased access.<br />
That's in the past been regarded as sacrosanct, bipartisan<br />
you don't try and score party political points off that. Now<br />
unfortunately this totally dispirited arid disappearing opposition<br />
has broken the rules. Now I have refrained to this stage from<br />
responding on that. On that, I simply want to say that when<br />
I was there we had discussions, not. only with the Prime Minister,<br />
but with other people and we were given certain undertakings.<br />
I have written to the Japanese Prime Mini'ster reminding him of<br />
those undertakings. I've had the Japanese Ambassador in.<br />
Mr Kerin leaves today, the Minister for Primary Industry goes<br />
there. This Government could not have more I've spent hours<br />
getting through on the phone to the Prime Minister. My Ambassador<br />
up there has been working and all our officials have been wor'king<br />
too. And may I say that the official representatives of the<br />
rural industry recognise this and applaud what we are doing. We could not<br />
have done more and we will continue to do everything we can.<br />
What we've got to try and do is to see that there is now that<br />
they have made a decision to increase the quota for the United<br />
States we've got to see that we can get an increase in the amount<br />
that Australia can get under global quota increase. And we are<br />
doing everything we possibly can, and I am certain John that Out<br />
of those negotiations there will be an increased tonnage available<br />
to Australia and hopefully I think an increase in the proportion<br />
of that which will be chilled beef which is more valuable.<br />
Now, all those things we are doing, and there is no Government<br />
that could be doing more than we are.<br />
LAWS: Do you believe the Opposition have damaged our chances?<br />
Yes, well I think it's not helpful. I mean it stands to<br />
reason it's not helpful if two things are done. In the Parliament<br />
they have attacked the Japa1ese Prime Minister accused him<br />
of breaking his word. Before it's possible to judge in any sense<br />
whether that has happened. I don't think it makes sense in a </p>
<p>continued<br />
democracy like ours for an Opposition to be getting up and<br />
saying that while negotiations are going; on. I am sure that<br />
doesn't help. And secondly to appear to be making it an<br />
internal political issue doesn't strengthen the hand of the<br />
Government. If in fact this Opposition when they were in*<br />
Government could point to the fact that they had maintained<br />
the share of Australia under the Japanese market of beef<br />
imports under quota.-that would be one thing. But the<br />
facts are John, that the Japanese beef imports under quota<br />
in the period from 1976 the first year of their Government-<br />
Australia had 82.5% in this last year 67.2%. Now, that's<br />
what happened under their period of office. Down from 82.5<br />
to 67.2%. ,1<br />
LAWS: What's their excuse for that?<br />
I don't know, other than they were bargaining with<br />
hard bargainers I guess. But, I simply want to make the<br />
point that it would be crazy for us as a Government not to<br />
be doing everything we possibly can to get every last ounce<br />
of beef into the Japanese market.<br />
LAWS: But that hasn't been the suggestion surely, that you<br />
don't want it.<br />
Well, what's the criticism that we are not doing our<br />
best, that I should have dashed again up there, that I was<br />
remiss for not immediately racing to Japan well, this is<br />
awful politics and I mean it really is an absurdity that you<br />
try and get some political advantage out of a situation like this.<br />
If it can be shown that we were not doing everything we possibly<br />
could, that's one thing. If it can be shown also that they<br />
in Government had maintained a share of Australian beef in the<br />
Japanese market that also would be another thing. But thE!<br />
facts are the opposite, they were not able to do that and WE! are<br />
doing everything we possibly can. All I would ask of the Opposition<br />
is that they try and realise that they do have a responsibi:-ity<br />
in certain areas to support Australia, and not engage in<br />
negative tactics as they are on this.<br />
LAWS: Yes, but doesn't that rather reek of desperation, which<br />
is understandable desperation.<br />
Well, they have reason to be desperate, but ultimately<br />
you would still hope that they were decent people who were<br />
concerned to try and help Australia.<br />
LAWS: Yes, I find it hard to come to terms with the fact that<br />
they could suggest or could even start to believe that any<br />
Government in respect of whether it is yours or theirs or any<br />
Government wouldn't be doing it's best for the country<br />
otherwise what the hell is it there for?<br />
Exactly. </p>
