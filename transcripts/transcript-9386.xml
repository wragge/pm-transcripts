TEL PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
REPORT ON ONGOING REFORM IN THE A US TRALIA N PUBLIC SERVICE<br />
I am very pleased to welcome the Report of the Australian Public Service<br />
Management Advisory Board ( MAB) on ' Ongoing Reform in the Australian Public<br />
Service', tabled in Parliament today ( Thursday).<br />
The Report is the first of its kind by MAB a body which advises the Government,<br />
through the Prime Minister, on significant issues in the management of the<br />
Australian Public Service.<br />
The Report highlights, in particular, the role of the public service in advancing<br />
Government initiatives in the past 12-18 months, including the development and<br />
preparation of the Discussion Paper, Restoring Full Employment, and the<br />
Government's White Paper, Working Nation, the implementation of the<br />
Government's decision to re-focus industry policy through the establishment of<br />
AusIndustry, and the development of measures in health policy to improve the<br />
responsiveness of the private health insurance sector.<br />
I am especially pleased that the Report notes improved levels of service to clients<br />
by the public service, as seen for example, in recent refinements to the<br />
Department of Social Security's claims processing and the Australian Taxation<br />
Office's new Electronic Lodgement Service for taxation returns.<br />
The Report concludes that, while the APS has made good progress in focussing<br />
on results arising mainly from public sector reforms over the past decade there<br />
remains scope for further development in some areas.<br />
Among the main challenges ahead are the promotion of public service values,<br />
particularly the importance of ethical conduct, the continuing evolution of a more<br />
flexible public management framework, and adaptation to social, technological<br />
and demographic change.<br />
I would like to thank the members of the Management Advisory Board for their<br />
Report. It demonstrates that the Australian Public Service is an institution which<br />
has an important and valuable role in serving the interests of all Australians.<br />
