. U TRALIA b<br />
FOR PRESS 25-MAY 1977<br />
MEAT EXPORTS TO THE MIDDLE EAST<br />
The Government has decided to send a two man team to the<br />
Middle East to look at the adequacy of cold storage facilities<br />
for Australian meat exported there.<br />
The team will include a senior officer from each of the<br />
Departmentof Overseas Trade and Primary Industry. Arrangements<br />
for the mission are being put in hand immediately.<br />
The Government is aware of the importance to Australian meat<br />
exporters of the Middle East trade. Australian meat exports<br />
to the region have grown rapidly in recent years. In 1975/ 76<br />
exports of refrigerated sheep meat totalled 47,200 tonnes<br />
a significant increase on the 13,400 tonnes exported in 1973/ 74.<br />
Exports of beef and veal to the Middle East have grown from<br />
3,125 tonines in 1 973/ 74 to 15,656 tonnes in 1975/ 76. Over the<br />
same period exports of live sheep to the Middle East have grown<br />
from 900,000 to 1.7 million.<br />
It is highly desirable that the Australian Government take<br />
whatever steps are appropriate to promote meat exports to this<br />
new and expanding market.<br />
In view of the importance of the meat industry to the Australian<br />
economy and the difficulties being encountered in some of the more<br />
traditional markets, the Government believes that every effort<br />
should be made to enable greater diversification of overseas markets<br />
and to facilitate the export of meat in chilled and frozen forms.<br />
