FOR PRESS 19 JANUARY 1979<br />
EXTENSION OF APPOINTMENT MR JUSTICE FOX<br />
The Prime Minister announced today that the term of appointment<br />
of Mr Justice Fox as Australia's Ambassador-at-Large on<br />
nuclear proliferation and safeguards matters had been extended.<br />
The Prime Minister said that, since M1r Justice Fox's<br />
appointment as Ambassador-at-Large in November 1977, he had<br />
conveyed the Australian Government's concern for a stronger<br />
world non-proliferation regime to many countries and he had<br />
made an important contribution to international understanding<br />
in this area.<br />
Mr Justice Fox was to have returned to his judicial duties<br />
in the next few weeks but the Government had prevailed upon<br />
him to agree to defer his return to the Bench to enable<br />
him to further progress the cause of international nuclear<br />
non-proliferation. The Prime Minister paid tribute to<br />
Mr Justice Fox for being prepared to sacrifice his own<br />
personal preferences in the national interest.<br />
The Prime Minister stated that Mr Justice Fox will be<br />
returning to Australia shortly for consultations with the<br />
Minister for Foreign Affairs and himself. </p>
