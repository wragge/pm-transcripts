<p><strong>TOM ELLIOT:</strong><br />
  The Prime  Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, Mr Turnbull good evening. </p>
<p><strong>PRIME  MINISTER:</strong><br />
  Good evening Tom, great to be  with you<strong>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>TOM ELLIOT:</strong><br />
  This morning you go through the  Australia Building Construction Commission legislation which of course was the  reason for going to a double dissolution election back in July. Is this a major  victory? </p>
<p><strong>PRIME  MINISTER:</strong><br />
  It certainly is. It’s a great victory for all Australians to  restore the rule of law to the construction sector, after so much defiance by  the CFMEU. So much, as you know, particularly in Victoria – there is so much  industrial disputation. You know there are over a quarter of a million  Victorians Tom, who work in the construction industry. There are currently 22  CFMEU officials from the Victorian branch before the courts, and they’ve issued  over the last decade - your courts – the CFMEU with over $4 million in fines,  the highest of any state. </p>
<p>So, what you’ve experienced in Victoria is projects –  Government projects, commercial projects, big apartment towers, office blocks,  schools, roads, hospitals, the Simpson Army Barracks, the Melbourne Institute  of Technology – all of these projects and so many others, have been disrupted  by lawless industrial action, which adds up to 30 per cent, indeed more, to the  cost of construction. </p>
<p>So, restoring the rule of law is a critical economic reform.  It goes together with the other big industrial reform that the Senate approved  last week, which is the Registered Organisations Bill, which was the other  trigger for the double dissolution election. What it does is ensure that union  officials have the same accountability and transparency with respect to their  members, as company directors have to their shareholders. So these are very  very big reforms. They’ve been opposed by Labor for many years and now they are  law. </p>
<p><strong>TOM ELLIOT:</strong><br />
  Do you think that long term this will make construction,  especially in Victoria, cheaper? Cheaper for building companies, cheaper for  the shareholders of companies, cheaper for every day Victorians?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong><br />
  Tom, yes I  believe it will begin an important change of culture. Firstly the law will be  complied with. The penalties are being tripled. You have to remember, this is  not theory. The Building and Construction Commission existed under the Howard Government  - it was abolished under the Gillard Government. Fines for breaches of  industrial law were literally cut by two thirds by the Labor government. In  fact Bill Shorten was the Employment Minister under Prime Minister Gillard. So  essentially, what Labor did because they are now wholly owned subsidiaries of  these militant unions, you’ve seen this with Dan Andrews and the United  Firefighters Union of course in Victoria, but they step back and of course  industrial disputes increased, lawlessness increased, costs increased and  taxpayers and home-owners had to pick up the tab. </p>
<p><strong>TOM  ELLIOTT:</strong><br />
  Can I ask you  about the backpacker tax? Now there was a deal done, or I thought a deal had  been done earlier on in the week to agree on a 15 per cent tax rate for backpackers  – that hasn’t made it through the Senate. Are you going to try again with that  one?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME  MINISTER:</strong><br />
  Well, we will  certainly resubmit the Bill to the Senate when it’s clear that there will be a  majority in the Senate to support the tax at 15 per cent. </p>
<p><strong>TOM  ELLIOTT:</strong><br />
  So who has to  change their mind?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME  MINISTER:</strong><br />
  Well, any  number of Senators can change their mind but you know, the real onus here, the  real responsibility should be on Bill Shorten and the Labor Party. Obviously,  we’d like Derryn Hinch to change his mind. We’d like Senator Culleton to change  his mind. We’d like any of the crossbenchers to change their mind and vote for  it but the real responsibility here is with Bill Shorten. He has decided  for nothing other than political advantage, I mean they are so bitterly angry  about the passage of the Registered Organisations Bill and the ABCC Bill. You  should have seen them in Question Time today. They are spitting chips – they  are so angry and so they’ve decided out of spite to block this very sensible  reform to backpacker’s tax so because they are so distressed and angry, they  would rather backpackers were paying 32.5 cents tax, instead of 15 per cent and  what we’ve offered is a very sensible reform.</p>
<p><strong>TOM ELLIOT: </strong><br />
  I agree, but  is it wrong that we have attract backpackers to do jobs when Australians are on  the dole and not doing those same agricultural jobs?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME  MINISTER:</strong><br />
  Well, I don’t  think you can blame for farmers for seeking…</p>
<p><strong>TOM ELLIOT: </strong><br />
  Oh no I’m not,  I’m blaming the people who live here, who won’t take these jobs.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME  MINISTER:</strong><br />
  Well, we do  everything we can to encourage – it’s a very fair point by the way Tom and it  gets made to me all the time. We do everything we can to encourage people that  are on Newstart to work for the dole, go into employment programmes, the  internship programme. We’re just launching a new one call PaTH, is a good  example. But ultimately, if people refuse to work or they are not prepared to  work and do work of this kind, then the farmer has to look somewhere else and  that’s how this working holiday-maker or backpacker phenomenon has developed.</p>
<p><strong>TOM ELLIOT: </strong><br />
  The  protestors, we’re told that up to 30 people today had to be removed from the  House of Representatives during Question Time. How did they get in?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME  MINISTER:</strong><br />
  Well it’s  being investigated, the public can come into the House of Representatives and  sit in the public gallery and of course, thousands of people do every year. But  they came in and then undertook that protest which – some of them apparently  super-glued their hands to the railing too so it was a very rowdy protest, and  the sitting of the House was suspended for half an hour or so. And then after  they had been removed the House resumed. </p>
<p><strong>TOM ELLIOTT: </strong></p>
<p>I’d happily leave them superglued to the railing and see how  much they like that overnight. There are rumours of a Cabinet reshuffle early  in the New Year, are you contemplating that?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong></p>
<p>I’ve a great Cabinet – Tom and I have – Prime Ministers are  always asked this question at this time of year and I think it’s probably true  they always give the same answer too. But as it happens, I have a fantastic  Cabinet, a great Ministry and we’re delivering. We went to the election with an  economic plan. Key elements of it are already through the Parliament. Our  middle income tax cuts that are saving half a million Australians from moving  in to the second highest tax bracket – passed. We’ve got $20 billion now gross  budget savings through the Parliament, we’ve got all our superannuation changes  through, we succeeded in defending the CFA volunteers in Victoria as we  promised we would, by amending the Fair Work Act, and of course now we have the  Registered Organisations and the ABCCC Legislation through the Parliament. A lot  of people, particularly some of the political commentators were sceptical about  our ability to do that, but the Parliament is working and we’re delivering. </p>
<p><strong>TOM ELLIOTT: </strong></p>
<p>Well it seems to me the next big task is budget repair, now  just two days ago SNP, Standard Employers the International Ratings Agency,  puts Australia on notice saying that if you don’t do something about continuing  Federal Budget Deficits then I think the country’s credit rating will be cut.  Is that the big task for 2017?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong></p>
<p>It is a very big task and it is probably the biggest task,  single biggest task facing government, because we have to live within our means  and otherwise we will be leaving our children and grandchildren with a burden  of debt that will mean for them either less services or higher taxes or more  likely both. </p>
<p>And Tom on that note, the bells are ringing and the Green  light is flashing and I have to go and vote in the House. It’s great to be with  you and Happy Christmas. </p>
<p><strong>TOM ELLIOTT: </strong></p>
<p>Malcolm Turnbull thank you for joining us. </p>
