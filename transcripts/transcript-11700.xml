    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE ..........................................................................................</p>
<p>Well, thank you Ian and ladies and gentlemen. It is for all of the reasons</p>
<p> for which you have been made aware, a particular pleasure for me to address</p>
<p> this gathering in Maclean. It is as it is described a mighty river and</p>
<p> it is in every way a delightful part of the world, and I can understand</p>
<p> why it is becoming increasingly attractive as a place in which to live.</p>
<p>I'm visiting Maclean, and indeed spending three days on the north</p>
<p> coast, the Northern Rivers area however you wish to generally describe</p>
<p> the district as part of a week long trip around rural and regional parts</p>
<p> of Australia. I have undertaken that week long trip because I have always</p>
<p> believed in the time that I've been Prime Minister, and indeed before,</p>
<p> that it is very important in a country as big as Australia that the leaders,</p>
<p> at a national level, ensure that they gain through regular visitation</p>
<p> a comprehensive understanding of the different elements that make up our</p>
<p> community.</p>
<p>And it is so very easy if you were born in Sydney, and grew up in Sydney</p>
<p> as I was, and if you spend as I do now a large amount of my time in Canberra,</p>
<p> and inevitably I am drawn because of the large population preponderance</p>
<p> to a lot of meetings and so forth in Melbourne, it is very easy to spend</p>
<p> so much of your time in that triangle. And that of course is a very big</p>
<p> mistake. And part of the arrangements I have in my office are to ensure</p>
<p> that whenever it looks as though my diary is getting a bit unbalanced,</p>
<p> a bit of a bell rings metaphorically speaking and reminds me that it's</p>
<p> important that I get around rural and regional parts of Australia.</p>
<p>That is the first reason, but the second reason is that I am very conscious</p>
<p> of the reality that in modern day Australia, although we are doing very</p>
<p> well at a national economic level, and we really are, we have very strong</p>
<p> economic growth, we have about 580,000 more jobs than four years ago,</p>
<p> we have a much lower rate of inflation and even after the adjustment yesterday</p>
<p> in interest rates, we'll have housing mortgages on average $266 a</p>
<p> month less than what they were four years ago, we've eliminated our</p>
<p> budget deficit and we're seen as one of the strong economies of the</p>
<p> world. Despite all of that there are areas of Australia that are not enjoying</p>
<p> as well as other areas the benefits of that national economic strength.</p>
<p> And some of those areas lie within the regions of Australia, indeed most</p>
<p> of them do.</p>
<p>But I am also conscious of the fact that as you go around rural Australia,</p>
<p> it is not all doom and gloom. Indeed there are a lot of good news stories</p>
<p> in the regions of Australia. I have seen a lot of them over the last few</p>
<p> days and it's very important that I get a balanced picture and it</p>
<p> is very important that we have a balanced understanding and a balanced</p>
<p> reporting of what occurs in the regional parts of Australia. It is true</p>
<p> that some of the regions have lost services and that that has caused a</p>
<p> lot of angst. People are understandably angry about the loss of government</p>
<p> services. They're also angry about the loss of banking services and</p>
<p> they also legitimately want the same access to medical services at an</p>
<p> affordable price that their fellow Australians in the cities have.</p>
<p>But there are some examples of where services are being put into an area</p>
<p> for the first time. For example, when it comes to the Job Network, which</p>
<p> has been the subject of a lot of debate. As a result of the second tender</p>
<p> in the Job Network, Maclean for the first time ever will actually have</p>
<p> one or two job providers under the job network, something that they've</p>
<p> never had before. Because one of the consequences of the new system is</p>
<p> that about three hundred small country communities around Australia will</p>
<p> have a Job Network provider helping the unemployed when they haven't</p>
<p> had them, either under the old Commonwealth Employment Service arrangements</p>
<p> or under the first tender of the Job Network arrangement. Now one service</p>
<p> swallow, certainly doesn't make a summer, but it is an illustration</p>
<p> of a determination on the part of the government, not only to recognise</p>
<p> the need to prevent the withdrawal of any further government services</p>
<p> from the bush, but also where possible to return or create for the first</p>
<p> time, services particularly in the smaller regional and rural areas of</p>
<p> our country.</p>
<p>I'm very conscious and I've had it reinforced to me that over</p>
<p> the past few years the position of traditional primary producers who rely</p>
<p> on what are regarded in this country as the traditional areas of agriculture</p>
<p> and primary production, that is wool and wheat and dairy and beef, that</p>
<p> all of them in different ways have been put under enormous challenge.</p>
<p> I know that this is, this has historically been one of the great dairy</p>
<p> areas of Australia. Of course there are far fewer dairy farmers now in</p>
<p> this part of the world than there were eighty or ninety years ago. I am</p>
<p> also conscious that the remaining dairy farmers in this part of New South</p>
<p> Wales, are grappling with the challenge of whether or not to support dairy</p>
<p> industry deregulation. This ultimately is a matter that has to be decided</p>
<p> by state governments, because it is the state government, and not the</p>
<p> federal government that presides over the quota system for milk and it</p>
<p> is the state government that is ultimately responsible for the decision</p>
<p> that will be taken. We have said at the federal level that we will support</p>
<p> a move towards dairy deregulation, provided the states, and in turn I</p>
<p> guess the majority of the participants in the industry, support it and</p>
<p> want it. We've said that we would implement to facilitate the change,</p>
<p> a dairy industry levy that would sustain the consumer price at a higher</p>
<p> level than would otherwise occur as a result of deregulation and we would</p>
<p> use the proceeds of that levy to finance the restructuring of the industry</p>
<p> so that those people whose quotas would disappear under dairy industry</p>
<p> deregulation would have compensation paid to them for the disappearance</p>
<p> of those quotas. In the end it is a matter for the industry and the state</p>
<p> governments to decide. We are there to help and facilitate and provide</p>
<p> the national legislative mechanism for the levy because it's not</p>
<p> fair to ask people to accept deregulation without financial cushioning.</p>
<p> And the industry at a national level at least has developed a plan which</p>
<p> they believe is the fair, the fairest and best way of achieving this outcome</p>
<p> and it is ultimately in the hands of the industry to decide whether or</p>
<p> not it's going to occur.</p>
<p>But of course, communities like Maclean and Grafton are not just built</p>
<p> on primary industry. They have now become, in every sense of the word,</p>
<p> communities that rely very heavily on service industries. They rely very</p>
<p> heavily on tourism, they rely heavily on educational services and increasingly</p>
<p> the attraction to people, particularly people in retirement of areas such</p>
<p> as this mean that we need to ensure there is an adequate level of not</p>
<p> only business, but also service provision that caters for a population</p>
<p> with that age profile.</p>
<p>I can't of course let the opportunity go by without saying something</p>
<p> very briefly about taxation reform. It's on everybody's lips,</p>
<p> and it is very important that we see taxation reform not in miniature,</p>
<p> but we see taxation reform on a very broad canvas. Taxation reform is</p>
<p> a total change for the better to our taxation system. In the words of</p>
<p> our original slogan, it is not a new tax, it is a new tax system. It is</p>
<p> a system designed to make the Australian economy more internationally</p>
<p> competitive. The reason that I've campaigned so strongly for it is</p>
<p> not out of any kind of ideological zeal, or not because it is some kind</p>
<p> of religion to me. It is because I believe that when it's implemented,</p>
<p> we'll have a better economy, we'll be more competitive, the</p>
<p> business community will have a better taxation system to deal with.</p>
<p>It includes a lot of things, it includes a $12 billion reduction in personal</p>
<p> income tax. It means that 80% of the Australian tax paying community,</p>
<p> that is those individuals who earn less than $50,000 a year, and that's</p>
<p> 80% of all individual taxpayers in this country, that those people will</p>
<p> be on a top marginal rate of no more than thirty cents in the dollar.</p>
<p> It means for people in rural Australia, that there will be cheaper fuel,</p>
<p> because we are reducing the excise on diesel fuel by twenty cents a litre.</p>
<p> And that will be of particular benefit to people in rural Australia. It</p>
<p> means that our exports will be cheaper and more competitive. The return</p>
<p> to producers will not be lower but because the GST will not apply to exports</p>
<p> and because the embedded taxes now inherent in our wholesale tax system</p>
<p> will be removed that our exports will be cheaper by the tune of about</p>
<p> $4 billion a year. And that will make our exporters that much more competitive.</p>
<p> Our business operating costs will be lower because we will replace the</p>
<p> wholesale sales tax, the financial institutions duty and in time, the</p>
<p> bank account debit tax and a wide range of stamp duties with the goods</p>
<p> and services tax.</p>
<p>We will also for the first time be providing a new financial deal for</p>
<p> the state governments of Australia. You would imagine from some of the</p>
<p> politically inspired comments made by state premiers that in some way</p>
<p> the goods and service tax was a bad thing for the states. Well, let me</p>
<p> let you in to a secret. When we had the Commonwealth/state conference</p>
<p> when I called a meeting of all of the premiers and chief ministers of</p>
<p> the Commonwealth and the states and put to them the proposal for the goods</p>
<p> and service tax arrangement. And under the arrangement the states get</p>
<p> every last dollar of the revenue out of the goods and services tax, that</p>
<p> is the deal. So, that in time they will be able to have more money available</p>
<p> to spend on public hospitals, on roads, on government schools and police</p>
<p> services and all the other things that states governments are meant to</p>
<p> provide. And let me tell you that whatever they may have said publicly,</p>
<p> every last premier was absolutely determined to sign that Commonwealth/state</p>
<p> agreement. And I well remember Mr Carr saying, John I think this is an</p>
<p> outrageous proposition, but please where do I sign. Because it was a very,</p>
<p> very attractive proposition to the states. And if I were a state premier</p>
<p> the last thing I would do is try and stop this new arrangement coming</p>
<p> into operation.</p>
<p>Now, of course the focus of sections of the media, the focus of those</p>
<p> who want to make an easy comment, or have an easy go at something is naturally</p>
<p> on the GST. And I know with a change like this it is easy to generate</p>
<p> a fear campaign. I stopped along the way to Maclean and had a chat to</p>
<p> some people at a little town, and I wandered along the shopping strip</p>
<p> and talked to four or five of the shopkeepers and one lady called me in</p>
<p> and she . . . and I said how are you and she said business is not bad,</p>
<p> but she said what about the GST she said. And I said, well let me, tell</p>
<p> me about it. She said well over there I have got things that are subject</p>
<p> to the GST, and over there I have some fresh fruit and a few other, some</p>
<p> other food that isn't subject to the GST. And I said, well, and she</p>
<p> said, well what do I do? And I said it is very easy, I said. What's</p>
<p> over there? What percentage of your sales? And she said, oh about 80%.</p>
<p> And I said, what is over there? And she said, the other 20%. I said, well</p>
<p> under an apportionment proposal that the Tax Office is putting together,</p>
<p> a small business like you would simply add up its turn over and if it</p>
<p> is 80% of items subject to GST, and 20% not it means you remit 8% and</p>
<p> not 10% of all your sales on a three monthly basis and you claim back</p>
<p> all of the GST you pay on any of the things you buy to run your business.</p>
<p> It is as simple as that. She said, oh, that's all that's to</p>
<p> it. And I said, well in essence that is all that is to it.</p>
<p>And I think as time goes by, as people realise that it's coming</p>
<p> in on the 1st of July and they begin to focus on it and apply</p>
<p> their minds to it. I had another chemist in the same place, I asked him</p>
<p> and he said, oh well, and he banged the computer, you know that he'd</p>
<p> just bought and he said, look oh we are getting ready, he said it's</p>
<p> ok, he said, I've got a bit of paper out there that I was just reading</p>
<p> as you walked in and he said I'll get on top of it. He said it is</p>
<p> a much better system then the present one.</p>
<p>But we are going to be subject to a fear campaign. The opponents of change</p>
<p> can always run a fear campaign. I mean, I can remember when decimal currency</p>
<p> came in. Um, gees, a lot of people remember when decimal currency came</p>
<p> in. And I remember all the fear then. People said, oh how can you possibly,</p>
<p> you know, this is outrageous. You know, our beloved nineteen pounds, you</p>
<p> know, when shillings and sixpence and so forth and all of that, pounds,</p>
<p> shillings and pence. How will we ever get used to the new system? That</p>
<p> sort of concern lasted about ten days, and within a very short period</p>
<p> of time people were very used to it. Now, I'd have to say that this</p>
<p> is slightly more challenging than decimal currency, because there was</p>
<p> an inherent situation about decimal currency. But the principle really</p>
<p> is the same. It is easy to run a scare on change. And the easiest thing</p>
<p> for a government to do I guess is to throw up its arms and say look, we</p>
<p> won't worry about change, even though we believe it is for the betterment</p>
<p> of the country.</p>
<p>Now, I really do believe this new system will make Australia stronger</p>
<p> and better that is why I am in favour of it. And I believe that once it</p>
<p> is in and people have got used to it, it will be okay. And in a few months,</p>
<p> perhaps by October or November of this year, people will say what was</p>
<p> all the fuss about. And this was the experience in New Zealand. But I</p>
<p> do accept that over the next few months, people are going to run fear</p>
<p> campaigns. You are going to have a scare a day in some of the tabloids</p>
<p> and you can run a campaign, if you look at something in isolation, and</p>
<p> you can say, well you know, this shirt, all men have got to wear shirts,</p>
<p> so therefore we should have no GST on shirts. Now, in isolation that sounds,</p>
<p> oh yeah, that sounds alright, yeah, in isolation. You can mount an argument</p>
<p> about having no tax at all in isolation. But of course that's not</p>
<p> realistic.</p>
<p>We do need to raise taxes to provide government services. Not only to</p>
<p> provide the army and health services, but also the other government services</p>
<p> we want. So, you've got to devise a tax system that works better</p>
<p> than the present one. And the principle of the GST is that you have a</p>
<p> general, single rate at a reasonably low level on virtually everything.</p>
<p> We started off, we wanted to have it on food and other things, we couldn't</p>
<p> get that through the Parliament, we settled for 85% of what we wanted</p>
<p> and now it is set in concrete. There will be some exemptions in relation</p>
<p> to food and other items, but by and large it will apply to everything,</p>
<p> and the exemption in relation to food will only be in relation to fresh</p>
<p> food, it certainly won't apply to things like restaurant meals.</p>
<p>But the important thing is that the more you exempt, the more the system</p>
<p> breaks down. If you exempt one item, then there will be pressure to exempt</p>
<p> another item. And everytime you, I've learnt this in politics, everytime</p>
<p> you agree to the entreaty of a special interest, you create a natural</p>
<p> incentive for a new special interest to fill the void created by the satisfied</p>
<p> first special interest. That is how the law of increasing political demand</p>
<p> on government works. And it has always been thus and it ever will be thus.</p>
<p> And over the months ahead, we are going to have to deal with requests</p>
<p> to leave things out, but everytime you leave things out you create that</p>
<p> ripple effect and that undermines the goal that you have in mind. And</p>
<p> if you go too far down that road you then reach a point where you can't</p>
<p> implement all of the other reforms.</p>
<p>I know there are a lot of self-funded retirees in this area. There are</p>
<p> special arrangements in the package to cater for your situation. Those</p>
<p> who get the pension, there will be a front-end loaded increase in the</p>
<p> pension of 4% on the 1st of July to accommodate in advance</p>
<p> any price increases flowing from the introduction of the GST. There will</p>
<p> be a savings bonus for people on the pension of a thousand dollars and</p>
<p> there will be additional savings bonus for people who are self-funded</p>
<p> retirees. If you are a self-funded retiree you'll benefit from the</p>
<p> total abolition of provisional taxation, which I know is the bane of the</p>
<p> existence of many self-funded retirees in the Australian community. And</p>
<p> of course you will also benefit from the reductions if you are in the</p>
<p> income tax bracket, you'll benefit from the reductions in personal</p>
<p> income tax. You'll also benefit from a thing, I know it sounds complicated,</p>
<p> called dividend imputation credits. You might, for example, have shares</p>
<p> in a company, and you might get paid franked dividends and the tax may</p>
<p> be deducted at say, 36 cents in the dollar now, it will be 30 cents in</p>
<p> the dollar. But you mightn't pay 30 cents in the dollar on your tax,</p>
<p> you might only pay 20 cents in the dollar and at present, you really get</p>
<p> gypped the 10 cents, the difference between the 20 and the 30. And what</p>
<p> we're going to do under dividend imputation credit is to pay you</p>
<p> the difference. We take the view that if your tax rate is only 20 cents</p>
<p> in the dollar, and it's being deducted under imputation at 30 cents,</p>
<p> or 36 cents in the dollar, that is not full value for you. And you want</p>
<p> to get paid the difference. And we're going to do that. And that</p>
<p> is one of the particular benefits for many retired people whose taxable</p>
<p> incomes may not be very high and therefore they're not paying the</p>
<p> same rate as the company which issues them with the franked dividend.</p>
<p>Now these are many of the, might I say, no pun intended, fringe benefits</p>
<p> of the taxation reform which are particularly tailored. Now, you don't</p>
<p> read about dividend imputation credits, or the abolition of provisional</p>
<p> tax, or bonuses for self-funded retirees. You don't read about those</p>
<p> on the front pages of the newspapers and I can understand that because</p>
<p> it is not, it is a good news story. And that doesn't generate a little</p>
<p> bit of fear.</p>
<p>Now what I am putting to you my friends, is that this is a total reform.</p>
<p> It is a once in a lifetime opportunity to give this country a better taxation</p>
<p> system and that is why we we're doing it, we're going to stick</p>
<p> with it, we're going persevere against the criticism and the growing</p>
<p> choruses from particular people, but I think falling on increasingly deaf</p>
<p> ears in the Australian community. There's a bit of noise as you go</p>
<p> around, but there's also a lot of people who say, gee this is for</p>
<p> the longterm benefit of the country. We had a debate about it at the time</p>
<p> of the 1998 election, the Government got returned. They told us they were</p>
<p> going to do it, they've done it, let's get on with it and get</p>
<p> it behind us. That is the attitude I get. People are saying to me, look</p>
<p> let's get it in, let's get it behind us and get on with something</p>
<p> else. And that is very much the attitude of the government. And that is</p>
<p> very much, I think, increasingly the attitude of the community.</p>
<p>But, ladies and gentlemen it is great to be amongst you. It's nice</p>
<p> to be in Maclean. It is a beautiful part of the world. Thank you very,</p>
<p> very much for your very warm welcome.</p>
