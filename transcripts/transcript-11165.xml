<p>E&amp;OE.............</p>
<p>  KNIGHTS:</p>
<p>  Prime Minister John Howard joins me from his new studio in Sydney. Prime</p>
<p>   Minister, good afternoon.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Good afternoon. It's hardly a studio. It's just a broadcast line.</p>
<p>  KNIGHTS:</p>
<p>  You should see mine.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  How are you?</p>
<p>  KNIGHTS:</p>
<p>  Very well. Thanks for coming on the programme. We'll of course talk about</p>
<p>   the referendum but a couple of current issues I just want to come to you</p>
<p>   first on. One of them was the Regional Summit. Now, this is still very fresh.</p>
<p>   It was held in Canberra last week and I've been speaking to a number of</p>
<p>   people about it, and I say well, what was it like, was it all worth it?</p>
<p>   I suppose a lot of them are still making up their minds and waiting to see</p>
<p>   what comes out of it. What do you think came out of it?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  The best thing that came out of it was that it was a very clear demonstration</p>
<p>   that the Government and really the Government on behalf of the rest of the</p>
<p>   community has crossed the Rubicon, so to speak, in recognising that there</p>
<p>   is a big problem in rural and regional Australia, that there is a feeling</p>
<p>   that people in country areas are missing out, are falling behind. And that</p>
<p>   whilst we weren't able to deliver every solution and solve every problem</p>
<p>   we committed ourselves to listen.</p>
<p>  We announced a number of important initiatives including for regional South</p>
<p>   Australia the Alice Springs to Darwin railway which will create 7,000 jobs</p>
<p>   in regional Australia and generate 18 months work for the BHP steelworks</p>
<p>   in Whyalla, the Rural Partnerships Trust that will be a joint effort by</p>
<p>   the Government and private enterprise to provide resources for various activities.</p>
<p>   The most valuable thing that people got from it was a realisation that we</p>
<p>   are quite serious about, over time, trying to address some of the difficulties.</p>
<p>  And during the Summit I had the opportunity of going to Eugowra in New South</p>
<p>   Wales and announcing the first of the rural transaction centres. These are</p>
<p>   the first of 500 centres that we're going to establish in the bush out of</p>
<p>   the proceeds of the sale of the second tranche of Telstra. And this was</p>
<p>   an old Westpac Bank building where we're going to co-locate basic banking</p>
<p>   facilities, Centrelink, Medicare easy claim facilities, Internet facilities</p>
<p>   and, of course, copying facilities. And it will act as quite a service hub</p>
<p>   for a small country town. There's only 670 people in Eugowra. And this is</p>
<p>   going to be repeated all around the country over the next year or two so</p>
<p>   that when the programme is finished we will have established 500 of these</p>
<p>   rural transaction centres and it's all about putting services back into</p>
<p>   the bush.</p>
<p>  So, I think my answer is that a lot was achieved. We demonstrated our genuine</p>
<p>   concern. We told the people of rural Australia that we do understand their</p>
<p>   sense of having been in some areas left out. We committed ourselves to a</p>
<p>   number of projects that will bring jobs and investment and benefits. And</p>
<p>   we launched the first of these rural transaction centres. So, quite a lot</p>
<p>   has come out but gee there's a long way to go and I wouldn't like to represent</p>
<p>   to any of your listeners that we think for a moment that we've solved all</p>
<p>   the problems. And we're going to try very hard over the next few years to</p>
<p>   stay in touch. I'm planning systematic visits to the bush. I've been doing</p>
<p>   that now quite regularly since being Prime Minister and I'm going to maintain</p>
<p>   it because we do understand the problems. And whilst we're not going to</p>
<p>   satisfy everybody and answer every problem, we're going to try.</p>
<p>  KNIGHTS:</p>
<p>  There were obviously a lot of people there with a lot of background and</p>
<p>   a lot of ideas about how to solve the problems that do exist in regional</p>
<p>   Australia. Have you managed to have a look at any of those proposals and</p>
<p>   are there any that you like?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, it's too early for me to respond to that. The Summit's only been finished</p>
<p>   a few days and they will all be evaluated by John Anderson and his colleagues.</p>
<p>   But the fact that we were able, during the course of the Summit, to announce</p>
<p>   such a major regional initiative as the completion of the railway and one</p>
<p>   or two other smaller but, nonetheless, important initiatives illustrates</p>
<p>   the fact that we are serious and we're not just into talk, although talk</p>
<p>   is part of it. And John said to me that the thing that encouraged him most</p>
<p>   out of the Summit was that people came away with a view that they didn't</p>
<p>   expect the Government to do everything and they weren't looking at the Government</p>
<p>   for support at every turn, they were looking to the Government for some</p>
<p>   support, a partnership in some areas. Certainly a sympathetic ear and a</p>
<p>   willingness to understand the feeling of alienation that many people in</p>
<p>   rural Australia understandably feel. Because when the whole country is doing</p>
<p>   well and you are not doing well then the sense of alienation is all the</p>
<p>   greater than if the whole country were in recession and nobody, of course,</p>
<p>   is looking for that. The point I am making is that, relatively speaking,</p>
<p>   people who are missing out feel it very keenly at a time of national economic</p>
<p>   affluence.</p>
<p>  KNIGHTS:</p>
<p>  And in the communiqu that was put out at the conclusion of the Summit there</p>
<p>   was mention that there is still a problem with minimum standards of water,</p>
<p>   of power of telecommunications in some areas.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  There is.</p>
<p>  KNIGHTS:</p>
<p>  Is that something you can make an immediate change to?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, we are making changes all the time. I mean, with telecommunications</p>
<p>   one of the advantages of selling Telstra is that we can use part of the</p>
<p>   resources to upgrade the information technology and telecommunications facilities</p>
<p>   in the bush. We have committed also in the Natural Heritage Trust we have</p>
<p>   committed hundreds of millions of dollars out of the sale of Telstra to</p>
<p>   help clean up the Murray Darling Basin which has a lot to do with the quality</p>
<p>   of water. So there are many things that we can do with those sorts of resources</p>
<p>   and the two are really linked. And that's one of the reasons we have argued</p>
<p>   very strongly for the sale of Telstra providing we are satisfied that service</p>
<p>   conditions for the country areas, that the wherewithal, or the proceeds</p>
<p>   from the sale give us the wherewithal to make very heavy investments in</p>
<p>   communications infrastructure for the bush.</p>
<p>  KNIGHTS:</p>
<p>  Do you think it's appropriate to say that there is a minimum standard for</p>
<p>   these things that must be upheld.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Oh, I think, I am sorry.</p>
<p>  KNIGHTS:</p>
<p>  That at least there's a certain level of service of infrastructure that</p>
<p>   must be supplied to all areas of Australia and it's the Government's responsibility</p>
<p>   to provide it.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  The Government has a basic responsibility to provide a decent level of infrastructure.</p>
<p>   In some areas it's reasonable and better for that to be provided in partnership,</p>
<p>   in cooperation with the private sector. In other areas it has to be provided</p>
<p>   completely by the Government. It's a proper role of Government to provide</p>
<p>   infrastructure support. We recognise and understand that. The question of</p>
<p>   what is the right level will always be a matter of debate but I don't regard</p>
<p>   it as in any way a departure from the small government beliefs of the Liberal</p>
<p>   Party and the National Party that the Government provide a lot of infrastructure.</p>
<p>   It is part of our role and governments are answerable to the community in</p>
<p>   the provision of certain levels of infrastructure.</p>
<p>  KNIGHTS:</p>
<p>  Just finally on the regional Summit, John Anderson was at pains to point</p>
<p>   out that he did not want this to be seen as a talkfest so how then do you</p>
<p>   measure the success of that event?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  I measure the success of the event from the feeling that people took away</p>
<p>   that the Government was listening. Our primary purpose in having the Summit</p>
<p>   was to listen and understand the problem. To try and work out those areas</p>
<p>   where we could provide in the near to medium term some practical responses</p>
<p>   and then over a longer term period provide some other responses. And I believe</p>
<p>   we achieved that goal. People came away from the Summit feeling that it</p>
<p>   had been a great success, that it had not just been a talkfest. That the</p>
<p>   Government and in particular John Anderson as the convenor of the Summit</p>
<p>   and Deputy Prime Minister had handled the thing with very great commitment</p>
<p>   and concern and I think people went away feeling that it was a very worthwhile</p>
<p>   exercise.</p>
<p>  KNIGHTS:</p>
<p>  Would you have another one?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  If we thought it would be helpful, yes. We are not committing ourselves</p>
<p>   to one at a particular time but if in the fullness of time we thought it</p>
<p>   was worthwhile to have another one we would. But it is a bit early to be</p>
<p>   even speculating about that but we have no in-principle objection to it</p>
<p>   at all.</p>
<p>  KNIGHTS:</p>
<p>  Well, one other issue, a local issue that is being resolutioned this week</p>
<p>   is the sale of Australian defence industries. Now, ADI is going to be sold</p>
<p>   to the Transfield Thomson - CSF Consortium and ADI, of course, has its branch</p>
<p>   in Albury and Benalla and Mulwala and Bendigo. When you were negotiating</p>
<p>   that sale did you seek assurances about the future of those plants and the</p>
<p>   people who work there?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, the statement that has been put out indicates that the Commonwealth</p>
<p>   sold its shares for $346 million and it's regarded as a particularly good</p>
<p>   price and it's my understanding that part of the sale involved the maintenance</p>
<p>   of the core businesses of the Government in a number of those areas. So</p>
<p>   we think.I mean, for example, the statement made by Mr Fahey and Mr Moore</p>
<p>   says the joint venture has indicated its commitment to the continued operation</p>
<p>   of ADI's existing core businesses of their current locations. In particular</p>
<p>   it is expected that ADI's operations at Albury, Bendigo, Benalla, Lithgow,</p>
<p>   Mulwala and Newcastle will continue and where commercially possible will</p>
<p>   be strengthened by the development of new business activities presenting</p>
<p>   opportunities for regional development.</p>
<p>  KNIGHTS:</p>
<p>  Is there anything to stop them shedding staff or closing plants?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, we have a commitment to maintain the core business at particular locations</p>
<p>   and obviously whilst I can't answer in respect of each and individual person,</p>
<p>   that's just not feasible because people have to make business decisions,</p>
<p>   obviously if they are going to maintain their operations at particular levels</p>
<p>   they are not going to be closing the plants and if they are not going to</p>
<p>   be closing the plants they'll have to maintain a certain number of employees.</p>
<p>  KNIGHTS:</p>
<p>  How much of a consideration was the fact that the Consortium is partly owned</p>
<p>   by the French because I understand that France was reluctant to provide</p>
<p>   munitions to Britain during the Falklands War because they objected to their</p>
<p>   involvement?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, that's a long shot. A long time ago. Well, I'm not concerned about</p>
<p>   the fact that there's a French interest. They made the best bid and many</p>
<p>   of the, I think the alternative, one of the alternative bidders may well</p>
<p>   have had some involvement from another overseas country. So I'm not too</p>
<p>   concerned about that.</p>
<p>  KNIGHTS:</p>
<p>  Well let's just talk about the issue that is right upon us. That of course</p>
<p>   is the coming referendum. If it goes down do you believe people will stop</p>
<p>   talking about it?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  I think if it goes down, if it gets up, if it goes down, either way people</p>
<p>   will give it a rest for a while. I don't think there's any doubt about that.</p>
<p>   If it goes down I think it will not come down in a hurry. But it is a free</p>
<p>   country. If people want to go on talking about it in the community there's</p>
<p>   no reason why they shouldn't.</p>
<p>  I mean there's nothing that says after the referendum on Saturday if it</p>
<p>   is defeated, and I don't know whether it's going to be defeated, I think</p>
<p>   it's going to be very close, much closer than the opinion polls suggest.</p>
<p>   If it is defeated, if people in the community want to go on talking about</p>
<p>   it well that's fine. This is a democracy. Equally if it gets up and people</p>
<p>   want to continue to debate our constitution they're perfectly entitled to.</p>
<p>  I would make the prediction that if the referendum is successful then there</p>
<p>   won't ever be another referendum to give people the option of voting directly</p>
<p>   for the president. I think that's a bit of a pipe dream. Bob Carr has rather</p>
<p>   put the kybosh on that today when he said that if it got up he, and bear</p>
<p>   in mind that he's been twice elected the Labor Premier of New South Wales,</p>
<p>   gives him a bit of seniority in the Labor Party, that he would be totally</p>
<p>   opposed to another ballot to allow for the election of a president. On the</p>
<p>   other hand if it's defeated then I think it will go off the agenda for a</p>
<p>   while, I don't think people are going to want to come back to it in a hurry.</p>
<p>   As to what happens further down the track, I don't have any control over</p>
<p>   that.</p>
<p>  I mean this is a democracy, and people make judgements at particular times</p>
<p>   according to what they think is good for the country. I'm advocating a no</p>
<p>   vote because I think we have a very good system and I don't think the one</p>
<p>   being put forward on Saturday will be better. I think it will be worse.</p>
<p>   I think the president will be less secure under that system than is the</p>
<p>   Governor-General under the current system. I don't think it will enhance</p>
<p>   Australia's independence. I'm a person who believes in changing things that</p>
<p>   don't work, but in preserving things that do work and that's essentially</p>
<p>   why I'm advocating a no vote.</p>
<p>  But I respect other people's views and it'll be a very interesting event.</p>
<p>   And whatever the outcome is naturally as Prime Minister I will respect and</p>
<p>   accept the views of the Australian people. I always said that I would give</p>
<p>   the Australian people a vote on this issue even though I personally, for</p>
<p>   the reasons I've mentioned, am opposed to it.</p>
<p>  KNIGHTS:</p>
<p>  Well these debates in the community often result in issues coming to a head</p>
<p>   like this, that this referendum is the result of public discussion and the</p>
<p>   public discussion is still there [inaudible] putting us back to the poll?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well I can't answer that question now because we haven't had the first poll</p>
<p>   yet. We haven't had the one on Saturday. I have no doubt that if the referendum</p>
<p>   is defeated on Saturday that for a while at least people will say well we've</p>
<p>   had a look at that, let's move on to something else. But that doesn't mean</p>
<p>   that people who want an issue raised again can't continue to argue for it</p>
<p>   to be raised. And that is right and proper because this is a democracy and</p>
<p>   there's at no point, at no point in this country do you ever say to people</p>
<p>   - well that is the end of the matter and you have no more right to agitate</p>
<p>   for change or advocate for the thing to be recommitted.</p>
<p>  I'm only saying that as Prime Minister and as leader of the Liberal Party</p>
<p>   that the mood in the party, and I think the mood in the community in the</p>
<p>   near term will be to say well we don't want to go back to that for a while.</p>
<p>   Now whether in a few years time the community decides it does want to go</p>
<p>   back to it, I can't predict. And if the community took that view than obviously</p>
<p>   political parties would respond. But I don't know what the mood is going</p>
<p>   be. I'm just saying that in the immediate term people are going to want</p>
<p>   to give it a rest.</p>
<p>  KNIGHTS:</p>
<p>  Well should the referendum be lost, does the Government then come up with</p>
<p>   a formal policy position on it or none at all?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well we will have a view on the handling of constitutional change the point</p>
<p>   is it will be a Government view. We've allowed a free vote on the issue</p>
<p>   of a republic and that free vote will end on Saturday evening with the polling</p>
<p>   booths close which is 6:00pm eastern daylight time in Victoria and New South</p>
<p>   Wales. And from then on if there's to be any view it will be a single government</p>
<p>   view and that will have to be formulated by the Cabinet. Speaking from my</p>
<p>   position as Prime Minister I think the view will be that we'll move onto</p>
<p>   other things, at least in the short term.</p>
<p>  KNIGHTS:</p>
<p>  Prime Minister, we'll leave it there. Thanks for your time.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  You're welcome.</p>
