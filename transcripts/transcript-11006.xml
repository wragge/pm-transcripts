<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, heroin. Are there any circumstances under which you would</p>
<p> agree to the legal supply of heroin for rehabilitation.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I haven't had any put to me yet. In life you never rule</p>
<p> out such changed circumstances that you might, but I don't see</p>
<p> any prospect in the foreseeable future that I would change my mind</p>
<p> on that, no.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>A number of the leading scientists in this city have been critical</p>
<p> today. Professor David Penington who of course ran the State inquiry</p>
<p> and Dr Campbell Aitkens from the MacFarlane-Burnett Centre. Professor</p>
<p> Penington says heroin is now cheaper, more readily available and purer,</p>
<p> stronger on the streets than it was when this inquiry all started.</p>
<p> And he said that...well, he's criticised you for rejecting,</p>
<p> trying a different...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, even if that were true, and I'm not saying it is not, I'd</p>
<p> have to get an independent assessment. But even if we accept that</p>
<p> that assessment were true, it doesn't follow from that that if</p>
<p> you adopt as the more permissive, the different approach, that you</p>
<p> would necessarily produce a better outcome, in fact, you may produce</p>
<p> a worse outcome. Now, I respect David Penington, I respect some of</p>
<p> the other people who put forward the other approach. I put against</p>
<p> that the very strongly held views of people in organisations like</p>
<p> the Salvation Army who are involved in picking up the pieces, who</p>
<p> are involved every day in the human misery of the drug traffic, who</p>
<p> are witnessing first hand the impact of it and a vast array of those</p>
<p> people are vehemently opposed to the sort of course of action advocated</p>
<p> by people like professor Penington...</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>... groups, I mean they are prohibitionists, they come ... with</p>
<p> alcohol as well. I mean they come...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes but..</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>[Inaudible]</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>But hang on, but that's scientific. Are you saying that the only</p>
<p> people who are to be listened to on this are scientists? I mean, surely</p>
<p> drug abuse has a lot to do with human behaviour. So if we ever get</p>
<p> to a situation that we only ever listen to the experts in one discipline,</p>
<p> we run the risk of making very major mistakes. We have to listen to</p>
<p> the experts from all disciplines, and the fact that somebody may be</p>
<p> a prohibitionist, doesn't mean to say that on every issue he</p>
<p> or she is wrong.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>True.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I mean, at least they have the experience, at least they have the</p>
<p> life's experience of knowing how human beings react and how the</p>
<p> families of human beings react to individual situations. Neil, this</p>
<p> is an horrendously difficult issue, and whereas many people have the</p>
<p> freedom to advocate a course of action without having the responsibility</p>
<p> of deciding whether the circumstances should be potentially changed</p>
<p> for all time, somebody in my position or the Premier's position</p>
<p> and I think, with respect, I think Jeff and I probably have some different</p>
<p> views on this as we do on some issues but that's life. And I</p>
<p> think we are both the better for it but the reality is that I have</p>
<p> ultimately got to make a decision on this and I have got to wear the</p>
<p> consequences of it, I also have to wear the consequences of maintaining</p>
<p> a position that many people criticise. Now, I am not convinced but</p>
<p> the answer to your question is that you never say never in life but</p>
<p> I can't see my view changing.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Do you accept we are probably headed to yet another record level of</p>
<p> fatal heroin overdose?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we could be.....</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>There's a vast amount on the streets still despite the success</p>
<p> of the police operation.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, but there's no hard evidence around the world that dramatically</p>
<p> changing tack is going to make that situation better. I mean, there's</p>
<p> some evidence says it could make it worse.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Yes, but we are not only talking about dramatically changing tack</p>
<p> but just having a trial, a study, an academic exercise where heroin</p>
<p> is provided to registered addicts in a small group.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>But many people argue that that sends exactly the wrong signal. Many</p>
<p> people argue that doing that is the first step towards respectability</p>
<p> of the practice. Many people find it anomalous and strange that day</p>
<p> by day, bit by bit we are making it harder for people to smoke, and</p>
<p> making it progressively less acceptable to the point of attracting</p>
<p> penalties in certain circumstances, yet we want to go in the opposite</p>
<p> direction or so they would seem, or so it would seem to them going</p>
<p> in the opposite direction in relation to heroin.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Do you believe the heroin issue is a health issue as most of the professionals</p>
<p> suggest, are we talking about a health issue here?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we are talking about...it's not just a health issue</p>
<p> it's, of course, as enormous, I mean, it has enormous health</p>
<p> dimensions but like many of these things the causes are not just physical</p>
<p> causes they are family environment causes, they are relationship causes,</p>
<p> there are all sorts of causes. That is why you can't just look</p>
<p> at it from a scientific point of view you have to also look at it</p>
<p> from a human behavioural point of view.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>The MacFarlane-Burnett Centre or an official of it is suggesting that</p>
<p> you are, in fact, outside the Ministerial Council on Drugs Strategy.</p>
<p> The national drug strategic framework recommends that evidence based</p>
<p> research be carried out on the recommendation of such professionals</p>
<p> as himself and Dr Penington, and it being overruled by a Prime Minister</p>
<p> is not adequate.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, in the end the Federal Government will decide what the Federal</p>
<p> Government supports. I mean, what I have made clear is that the Federal</p>
<p> Government does not support these trials and we won't have any</p>
<p> assets and resources of the Federal Government used in it and that's</p>
<p> what I have said.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>The Olympics, Sydney Olympics. Is there a possibility of any more</p>
<p> public money for the Olympics? I see Holden in particular seems to</p>
<p> be making pretty nervous noises about sponsorship.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh look, I don't know what you mean, any more public money?</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Well, I mean, we are $200 million short, some of the sponsors that</p>
<p> are already there are getting nervous about it. How much public money</p>
<p> will go in and will it be increased if necessary?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we would hope that the sponsorship will come good and I think</p>
<p> it's a little premature to be saying that there is a serious</p>
<p> threat to sponsorship. The publicity in the last couple of months</p>
<p> has been very bad, we all recognise that. But the preparations to</p>
<p> the Games are excellent and they will be a huge success and they will</p>
<p> bring enormous credit to Australia and my hope and expectation is</p>
<p> that by the time they come along the memories of the last, the events</p>
<p> of the last couple of months well and truly will have receded. As</p>
<p> far as the Commonwealth is concerned, we have already given very generously</p>
<p> and I don't see the circumstances in which we should be expected</p>
<p> to give more. I mean, after all, the problems have not been generated</p>
<p> by the Commonwealth Government. Those responsible for organising the</p>
<p> Games particularly at an international level must look to themselves</p>
<p> and their affiliates in Australia for the first line of responsibility</p>
<p> as far as these difficulties are concerned. I mean, the Federal Government</p>
<p> and State governments, generally speaking, but certainly the federal</p>
<p> Government in relation to the Olympic Games does not run them. I mean,</p>
<p> it has been made very clear that the Games in Australia are being</p>
<p> run by SOCOG. We are keen to help [inaudible] Australian event and</p>
<p> we have given very generously but I don't think anybody should</p>
<p> assume that any sponsorship shortfall is going to be automatically</p>
<p> picked up by the Federal Government. But let's not start talking</p>
<p> about sponsorship shortfalls at this stage.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Do you think the image has been tarnished by what's gone on particularly</p>
<p> with Phil Coles having stepped down?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, give the man a fair trial. I mean, he has made a response. I</p>
<p> didn't think he helped himself by his blatantly partisan political</p>
<p> comment earlier this week, I thought that was a very foolish remark.</p>
<p> But in relation to the allegation, there has been allegations made,</p>
<p> he has emphatically denied them. He is at least entitled to his day</p>
<p> in court before I make any judgement on that.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>What about the Commonwealth Games for Melbourne?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, terrific if it looks as though Melbourne will get them. Wellington</p>
<p> has pulled out, I can't see anybody else. Congratulations again</p>
<p> to Ron Walker for his success again in getting a major event to Melbourne,</p>
<p> I think it's fantastic.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, why were you not a banker?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>A banker?</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Bob Joss from Westpac. He is here six years, he is going home with</p>
<p> bonuses worth, well you can believe, somewhere between $36 and $45</p>
<p> million in bonuses. This is in the era when we are all screaming about</p>
<p> bank fees and bank costs but it's a bit over the top isn't</p>
<p> it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I mean, you ask me why I wasn't a banker, well I guess because</p>
<p> I prefer to go into politics in the public service. But they certainly</p>
<p> are well paid. It's always hard for somebody in my position to</p>
<p> make a definitive judgement on something like this. On the one hand,</p>
<p> when people are handling billions of dollars a year you need the best</p>
<p> talent around. And Bob Joss has been a very good Managing Director</p>
<p> for Westpac. He has pulled it around. Westpac had a lot of troubles</p>
<p> when Bob Joss took over and it is now doing a lot better. So leaving</p>
<p> aside the exact amount he's got he has had a very good track</p>
<p> record at that bank and I think that ought to be acknowledged. By</p>
<p> the standards that you and I are used to it is big money. By the standards</p>
<p> that the average person is used to it's huge money. But where</p>
<p> do you draw the line?</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Well, it's $1.4 million salary and he is going home with $6 million</p>
<p> a year bonuses. It's very generous.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I agree with that. I agree it is very generous. I suppose all I can</p>
<p> say to you in that situation is that the more competition you have</p>
<p> in the financial sector the more likely you are to have greater transparency</p>
<p> and greater scrutiny of those sorts of things. But you will never</p>
<p> have a world in which there are some people whose remuneration is</p>
<p> not looked upon with a degree of envy and a degree of, "gee,</p>
<p> that sounds too much".</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Yeah, you'd be a bit crook if your Westpac fees had gone up though</p>
<p> wouldn't you?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, you would be but your Westpac interest rates have gone down</p>
<p> a lot. And if you were a Westpac shareholder you would say thank you</p>
<p> to our Chief Executive who has turned the fortunes of the bank around.</p>
<p> Look, I am not here to answer for Westpac. I don't control it</p>
<p> and heaven forbid that the Federal Government should try and control</p>
<p> wages and remuneration of people be it in the banks, in the media</p>
<p> or anywhere else. But it does sound a lot of money and I don't</p>
<p> think you can bring in a system where those things are controlled,</p>
<p> I really don't.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>I think [inaudible] Federal Government does attempt to argue the wages</p>
<p> of people and wage cuts.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes but you are talking there about awards and you are talking there</p>
<p> about minimum wages, you are not talking about anything over and above</p>
<p> it if they are negotiated at the enterprise level.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Sure. Now, the GST. I notice the welfare lobby suggesting Â we're</p>
<p> right down the other end of the scale here Â suggesting that</p>
<p> they would trade-off some of the tax breaks if you would lift the</p>
<p> GST on food. Is that worth negotiating?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I don't. We've been down this track before. It's</p>
<p> very interesting that ACOSS, in particular, is finding...really</p>
<p> taking a slightly different tack. But in the end our position has</p>
<p> always been that you put it across the board and then you provide</p>
<p> compensation for low-income earners. And the problem with just taking</p>
<p> some items of food out, for example, is that everybody gets the benefit</p>
<p> of that. Bob Joss and Neil Mitchell and John Howard get the benefit</p>
<p> of that as much as the lowest paid person, if I may put it like that.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Is there any room for that sort of shuffling?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Not if it involves breaking down the sort of unified application of</p>
<p> the GST on food. I mean, we thought long and hard about this in the</p>
<p> months leading up to releasing the policy. We talked to ACOSS for</p>
<p> months. We heard all the arguments and we decided that the best and</p>
<p> fairest thing to do was to apply it across the board and then give</p>
<p> special weighted additional compensation to low-income groups and</p>
<p> that's what we've done.</p>
<p>[COMMERCIAL BREAK]</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>We're taking calls for the Prime Minister. Let's be quick</p>
<p> Â there's several issues that have to be raised. Simon,</p>
<p> go ahead please.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Yes. I'd like to talk about the heroin situation. I'm a</p>
<p> patient at Dr Cosmenski...</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>I should tell Mr Howard he's a GP in Melbourne who specialises</p>
<p> in treating drug problems.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Now, I get medication and...</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>What, are you an addict?</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>I was. I've been clean for about eight days now and I'm</p>
<p> still a little bit...not at the best of health. But anyway, the</p>
<p> medication is $200 a bottle for 30 tablets. Now, why is it so much?</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Is that Naltrexone?</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>You're asking me why is it so much Â I guess...</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>It's been in the country, it's been in the world for 15</p>
<p> years and we have to pay...I'm struggling, I don't have</p>
<p> a job...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well that's certainly...that's a fair question. I can't</p>
<p> give you all the reasons off-hand as to why it is that expensive.</p>
<p> It's obviously related, I guess, to the unavoidable fact that</p>
<p> relatively new drugs in this country are often expensive. I will get</p>
<p> some further information about that and convey it back through the</p>
<p> programme. I don't have it at my fingertips, I'm sorry.</p>
<p> I hope you continue to be successful and supported in your treatment.</p>
<p> And I think that's a fair question of somebody in your situation</p>
<p> to ask.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Simon, could I just ask you quickly Â we were talking earlier</p>
<p> about legalised supplies for addicts, what's your view of that?</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>I think it should be given a go because at the moment it's totally</p>
<p> out of hand. The newspaper reports saying that they've got it</p>
<p> under control, that the police are doing a good job, is a load of</p>
<p> rubbish.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>How much were you paying for heroin?</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Well, it depended whether you scored it off the street or you got</p>
<p> it through a dealer, as in like...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Is it more expensive than the medication?</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Well, it's different when you're on drugs because you manage</p>
<p> to do things like...I turned into a maniac and I did anything to</p>
<p> get my hit for the day and I'd steal and do anything for it.</p>
<p> Whereas, when you're not on it, you're a totally different</p>
<p> person. I've changed in the last seven days. I've changed</p>
<p> to a...I'm a different person. I think that it should be given</p>
<p> a go because what you're doing at the moment's not working.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Simon, thanks for calling. Mr Howard, thanks for that. I mean, to</p>
<p> me that's one of the best things that any leader can do is talk</p>
<p> directly to the people...I mean, a heroin addict Â you don't</p>
<p> bump into heroin addicts everyday in your role in life, do you?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I've bumped into quite a number of people who've had</p>
<p> big problems with drugs and I've certainly spent a lot of time</p>
<p> with parents whose children have died as a result of drug abuse. I've</p>
<p> spent a lot of time with quite a number of parents over the years,</p>
<p> including my time as Prime Minister, and even with them you get vastly</p>
<p> different attitudes. I mean, some of them I've spoken to are</p>
<p> vehemently opposed to any kind of heroin trial, others have a different</p>
<p> view. It reflects the divide in the community. I don't imagine</p>
<p> that everybody associated with the sort of heroin abuse and drug addiction</p>
<p> has the view that what I might loosely call the Âlet's give</p>
<p> it a try' view.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Simon, thanks for calling. Keep in touch and let us know how you go.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, good luck.</p>
