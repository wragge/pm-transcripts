    <content><![CDATA[<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Well it appears that tomorrow Federal Cabinet and Prime Minister</p>
<p>   Howard will formally commit Australia to support any United States</p>
<p>   attack on Iraq and to declare that President Saddam Hussein cannot</p>
<p>   be allowed to retain and use chemical and biological weapons. A</p>
<p>   couple of points before I speak to the Prime Minister.</p>
<p>The first that should be said, is that America and its allies will</p>
<p>   continue to explore every diplomatic initiative available to them.</p>
<p>   So this is not going to happen tomorrow. However, Prime Minister</p>
<p>   Howard was right at the weekend when he said, "the sort of</p>
<p>   capacity and the sort of weapons he shouldn't have, have the</p>
<p>   potential for the most awesome and dreadful effect". Mr Howard</p>
<p>   said, "we have to consider a whole range of contributions it</p>
<p>   is not a purely military contribution."</p>
<p>The Defence Department has been ordered to prepare a submission</p>
<p>   for Tuesday's Cabinet meeting. We sent two frigates and a supply</p>
<p>   vessel to the Gulf in 1991 but none were directly involved in the</p>
<p>   conflict. But we are talking about an arsenal of weapons being marshalled</p>
<p>   by Saddam with the capacity to wipe out the world's population</p>
<p>   twice over. And United Nations inspection teams have been locked</p>
<p>   out. So this is not an American ego trip, it is a United Nations</p>
<p>   repudiation by Saddam Hussein. United Nations inspection teams have</p>
<p>   been unable to account for 4,000 tonnes of chemical warfare materials</p>
<p>   and more than 600 tonnes of materials for making nerve gas. And</p>
<p>   inspite of every diplomatic effort United Nations inspection teams</p>
<p>have been locked out of Iraq. Now what President Clinton is doing</p>
<p>   is seeking support for a course of action in case diplomacy doesn't</p>
<p>   work. Hence, Mr Clinton called John Howard at the weekend at Kirribilli</p>
<p>   House after securing the support from British Prime Minister Tony</p>
<p>   Blair.</p>
<p>Our Prime Minister, John Howard is on the line. Prime Minister</p>
<p>   good morning.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good morning Alan.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Rather belatedly but Happy New Year to you.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>And to you to.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>And it is going to be a tough year ahead. In this Mr Clinton spoke</p>
<p>   to you for about 20 minutes what was the general thrust of that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well he gave me a background to the American efforts. He said how</p>
<p>   they wanted to keep trying to get a diplomatic solution, they didn't</p>
<p>   want to use force. However, they were faced with the terrible prospect</p>
<p>   that Saddam would not allow UN-sponsored inspections of facilities</p>
<p>   that were clearly believed to house chemical and biological war</p>
<p>   material. Now as you said in your introduction, if a stand and a</p>
<p>   firm and uncompromising stand is not taken against the storage and</p>
<p>   potential proliferation of this material the consequences into the</p>
<p>   next century is to awful to contemplate.</p>
<p>We cannot allow, the civilised world cannot allow rogue states</p>
<p>   who have no sense of international morality to have possession and</p>
<p>   therefore the capacity to use that kind of material. Now that is</p>
<p>   what is at stake and therefore there is a clear Australian national</p>
<p>   interest, there is a world security interest involved in this, it</p>
<p>   is not Clinton vs Saddam Hussein, it is the interests of the civilised</p>
<p>   world against somebody who has demonstrated an utterly amoral approach</p>
<p>   to his own population. He is the only person in my living memory</p>
<p>   who has used such foul material against his own people and he has</p>
<p>   demonstrated an utter indifference to the elementary basics, the</p>
<p>   elements of basic human values for his own population. So there</p>
<p>   is a lot at stake.</p>
<p>Now the Americans are trying to get a diplomatic solution, so are</p>
<p>   we. And we will go on doing that and it is not beyond hope that</p>
<p>   at the last moment he may blink. Now that is something that I discussed</p>
<p>   with the President, he doesn't rule it out, and he will try</p>
<p>   very hard to achieve that. But at the end of the day he said that</p>
<p>   some kind of military action could be necessary and he asked whether</p>
<p>   Australia would consider making a contribution and I said, we would</p>
<p>   certainly consider that and we will talk about it tomorrow.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>It was reported, talking about blinking, you have used that image</p>
<p>   there, it was reported at the weekend from the Middle East that</p>
<p>   Iraqi army commanders would rebel against Saddam Hussein if they</p>
<p>   were convinced an attack by the United States, Britain and others</p>
<p>   was aimed at removing him from power.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well that is always possible, although that has been talked about</p>
<p>   for years and it has never happened.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>One wonders though whether his own people aren't getting tired</p>
<p>   of it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well one has to wonder about that. And one would hope that they</p>
<p>   are and that somehow or other that there would be that kind of reaction.</p>
<p>   But in the past when that has been predicted it hasn't materialised.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>No, but he did call at the weekend for a million volunteers for</p>
<p>   a civilian force.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes he did.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>And reports from Iraq say that those calls were being ignored?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well all of that is mildly encouraging and I hope that it has an</p>
<p>   impact even on him. And I repeat, we don't want force used</p>
<p>   unless it is the only alternative, we really don't.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>So what are you meeting for tomorrow with your Cabinet to decide</p>
<p>   should the circumstances arise what would be the extent of our involvement,</p>
<p>   is that it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>That is the intention, yes.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>And you have briefed Mr Beazley?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I rang Mr Beazley on Saturday evening after I had had the call</p>
<p>   from President Clinton and I told him of it. And I told him that</p>
<p>   he would be kept fully informed. That not only would I ensure that</p>
<p>   the Opposition was fully briefed, I will make the service people</p>
<p>   available for the Opposition to be fully briefed and on top of that</p>
<p>   I will keep the Australian public regularly informed. The Australian</p>
<p>   public is entitled to know quickly and fully from me what is occurring</p>
<p>   on the issue because there is no more serious decision that any</p>
<p>   government takes than to contemplate the use of Australian assets</p>
<p>   and Australian military personnel in some kind of military action.</p>
<p>   And therefore the public is entitled to be fully informed.</p>
<p>We have already had, at a senior Minister level, discussions with</p>
<p>   our defence advisers. We will have a fully Cabinet meeting tomorrow,</p>
<p>   it is only Cabinet that can authorise this kind of action and I</p>
<p>   will be saying something more to the Australian people naturally</p>
<p>   after that Cabinet meeting.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Good on you. Good to talk to you and thank you for your time.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Thanks Alan.</p>
<p>[Ends]</p>
