    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am here on a sad mission today, but I am here to thank a good friend for the leadership and the solidarity that the people of the Netherlands and the government of the Netherlands have shown to Australia in the aftermath of the MH17 atrocity.</p>
<p>Let’s be absolutely crystal clear about what happened when MH17 was shot down – 298 innocent people were murdered, 193 Dutch people were murdered and 38 who called Australia home were murdered.</p>
<p>It was the very strong view of the Australian Government that the murder of innocent Australians was no small thing – even though it happened far away from our country – it was our view that the murder of innocent Australians had to draw a very strong response from the Australian Government and I am very pleased that in our friends here in the Netherlands, we have found partners to match our strength, partners who are not just partners in grief, but partners in demanding justice in the face of this terrible atrocity.</p>
<p>So, as you all know, we dispatched a mission to do what we could to ensure that the site was thoroughly searched, that remains were recovered, that investigations were pursued so that justice could be done. While the operation that we call <em>Operation Bring Them Home</em> has been suspended due to the upsurge of fighting in Eastern Ukraine, it certainly hasn’t been finished and it is my determination, it is, as I understand it, Prime Minister Rutte’s determination and the determination of the Dutch Government, to resume <em>Operation Bring Them Home</em>, should the circumstances permit it, in the weeks and months to come.</p>
<p>We owe it to the dead, we owe it to their grieving families to do everything we can to bring them home and to give them justice.</p>
<p>At every level, we have seen outstanding leadership by the Prime Minister, the Government and the people of the Netherlands.</p>
<p>After what had happened to the innocent passengers, the reception of the bodies here in the Netherlands was a moment of extraordinary solemnity and dignity. This was a moment when people who had not been treated properly in life, at least were treated properly in death. It reflected so well on all the Dutch people that everyone coming back was given that level of respect and dignity.</p>
<p>Throughout this whole period, the officials, the military and the police of our two countries have worked together in the closest possible friendship and harmony.</p>
<p>I admire the professionalism, the commitment, the dedication of all the Dutch personnel, and I know that my senior Australian colleagues have admired the professionalism, the commitment, the courage of their Dutch brethren.</p>
<p>This has been, while a very sad time, a very good time for our countries and our friendship.</p>
<p>Australia and Holland do go back a long way. If some of your explorers, Mark, had taken a different turn back in the 1600s, the whole history of our country might have been different. Things turned out as they did, but nevertheless, there have long been strong and deep links between our countries and our peoples and this sad episode has certainly served to deepen those links and to deepen that understanding.</p>
<p>I do look forward to working very closely with you, your government and your people in the months and the years ahead.</p>
<p>Thank you so much, Mark.</p>
