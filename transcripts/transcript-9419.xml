PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
BOGOR DECLARATION<br />
The Bogor declaration charts an extraordinary new path for the region towards<br />
extraordinary new goals.<br />
The economies of the region have committed themselves to achieve free and open<br />
trade and investment no later than the year 2020. The commitment is to free trade in<br />
goods and services; the path there is removal of tariffs and non-tariff barriers. Just as<br />
important is the commitment to remove obstacles to doing business in the region by<br />
harmonising and simplifying customs procedures, standards, and regulatory<br />
structures. The significance of this commnitmnent is enormous. It is stronger than that made by<br />
parties to the GATT or by G7 countries.<br />
The benefits for Australia will be huge. And our economy and businesses are<br />
increasingly set up to reap these benefits.<br />
By 2020, APEC will include seven of the ten largest economies in the world. The<br />
declaration commits advanced economies such as Japan to bring down their barriers<br />
to trade by 20 10. It engages the United States in a process of liberalisation in<br />
cooperation with the rest of the region. It commits developing economies such as<br />
China to have fully opened their markets by 2020. Australia's trade ties with the<br />
region are sinews in an economic body which will grow faster than any other in the<br />
world. The commitment is to achieve free trade nolt than these dates. Leaders have asked<br />
ministers to begin immediately preparing proposals to implement the decision. At our<br />
next meeting in Osaka I hope we will be able to agree on a comprehensive action plan<br />
for achieving the free trade goal.<br />
Of course, many difficult issues will need to be negotiated. But we are building on<br />
directions which APEC economies have already chosen. For example, as a result of<br />
its own deregulation programs, average tariffs in Indonesia have already fallen from<br />
per cent to 20 per cent and are continuing to fall. In Korea, they've fallen from 32<br />
per cent to 10 per cent. And I am confident that, because moving together multiplies<br />
the benefits, many member economies will liberalise even faster. </p>
<p>2<br />
We estimate that the Uruguay Round outcome will increase annual real income in<br />
APEC economies by $ 112 billion. We will do even better from APEC free trade,<br />
over three times the Uruguay Round result.<br />
It is no accident also that pressure is coming from Asia for further global trade<br />
liberalisation. The fact that President Soeharto, the leader of one of the world's largest<br />
developing countries, has taken the initiative is a sign of the fundamental<br />
transformations which are taking place in the world economy.<br />
I want to record my esteem for the leadership President Soeharto has shown the<br />
region in preparing the Bogor declaration. I also want to recognise the vision and<br />
courage I should say that has been shown by the other APEC leaders. Many have<br />
had to make difficult decisions and overlook short-term considerations for a greater<br />
long-term good.<br />
It is also no accident that the lead has been taken by APEC, which has shown how<br />
economic diversity can be a strength. The future of the world's economy is going to<br />
depend in no small part on the capacity of the industrialised economies and<br />
developing economies to integrate in a way which promotes growth and encourages<br />
change.<br />
The commitments made by the APEC economies will see new streams of technology<br />
and capital flowing to the developing economies of APEC. We will all benefit.<br />
These will be flows driven by ineluctable economic forces, rather than trickles from<br />
Government-directed aid programs.<br />
The undertakings in the declaration will mean that barriers will be reduced not only<br />
within APEC but also between APEC economies and the rest of the world. Free trade<br />
in APEC will be reached in a way which will be consistent with the GATT, will<br />
strengthen the multilateral trading system and will promote further trade liberalisation<br />
in the world economy.<br />
APEC members have committed themselves not only to carry out their Uruguay<br />
Round obligations and support the WTO but to achieve them earlier and to go beyond<br />
them. We have invited other countries to respond.<br />
I hope that the agreement to a standstill that is, not to increase existing levels of<br />
protection will be respected by APEC members and so become a clear signal to our<br />
business communities about the seriousness of our commitments.<br />
All this is of enormous significance to Australia and Australians.<br />
We are entering a new epoch as a result of the strategic shifts that will occur in this<br />
region during the next 25 years. The process of liberalisation and economic<br />
integration that the Bogor declaration will encourage is an important insurance of<br />
security and stability as we cope with these shifts. Through their informal meetings,<br />
the region' s leaders can help ensure the process of economic integration stays on<br />
track. </p>
<p>7.<br />

For Australian business, the Bogor commitments hold the prospect of vastly improved<br />
access for their products and services to the fastest growing markets in the world. The<br />
day-to-day task of doing business will be easier. Our business people cannot expect<br />
good results automatically. But the structure is being put in place which will allow<br />
Australian business to plan on the basis of access over the next 25 years to an<br />
increasingly large and integrated regional market.<br />
The importance of this can be seen from the fact that in the past four years our<br />
merchandise exports to APEC grew at more than 9 per cent per annum, more than<br />
twice the rate of growth of our global exports. Manufactures accounted for over<br />
per cent of our exports to APEC. And APEC takes two-thirds of Australia's services<br />
exports. And Australia's growing trade links with APEC will make Australia more attractive to<br />
investors from the rest of the world.<br />
What does Bogor mean for Australians? It means a more prosperous economy. It<br />
means a better lifestyle. It means not only more employment opportunities but also<br />
more interesting ones. It means wider horizons for our young people and more scope<br />
for them to exercise their skills as they learn the languages of a wider family and<br />
become part of it. Not only business and industry will be challenged, but also<br />
education and culture.<br />
The Bogor declaration will help ensure that Australia, this generation of Australians<br />
and its successors have a dynamic role in their own region.<br />

<p>APEC, ECONOMIC LEADERS' DECLARATION<br />
OF COMMON RESOLVE~<br />
Bogor, Indonesia 1<br />
November 15, 1994<br />
We. the economic leaders -of APEC, came together in. Bogor, Indonesia<br />
today to chuxt the future course of our economic cooperation which will<br />
enhance the pro specis of an accelerated, balanced and equitable economic<br />
growth not only In the Asia Pacific region but throughout the world<br />
as well.<br />
2. A year ago on Blake bsland in Seattle, USA, we recognized that our<br />
diverse economies are becoming more interdependent and are maoving<br />
toward a community of Asia Pacific economiles. We have issued<br />
a vision. statement in which we pl edged:<br />
-to find cooperative, -solutions to the challenges of our rapidly<br />
changing regional and global economy',<br />
to 6upport -an expanding world economy and an open multiateral<br />
trading system;<br />
-to continue to reduce baffiers to trade and In-vestment to enable<br />
goods, services and capital to flow freely among our econies; </p>
<p>2<br />
to ensure that our pcople share the benefits of economic growthi,<br />
improve education and training, link our economies through advances<br />
in telecmmunication and transportattion, nd use our resourcou<br />
su~ tainubly.<br />
3. We set our vision for the, community of Asia Pacific economies bmasd<br />
on a recognition of the growing interdependence of our economnically<br />
diverse region, which comprises developed, newly industrializing and<br />
developing economies. The Asia Pacific -Industrialized economies will<br />
provide opportunities for devoloping economies to increase further<br />
their economic growth and their level of development. At the. same time<br />
developing. economies will strive to maintain high growth rates with<br />
the. aim of attaining the level of prosperity now enjoyed by the newly<br />
industrializing economies. The approach will be coherent and<br />
comprehensive, embracing the three pillars of sustanable growth,<br />
equitable development and national stability. Thbe narrowing-gap in the<br />
stages of development. among the Asia Pacific economies wHi benefit<br />
all. me mbers and promote the attainment of Asia Pacific economic<br />
p~ rogress. as a whole.<br />
4. As we -approach the twenty-first century, APEC needs to reinforce<br />
economic cooperation in the " sa Pacific region on the basis of equal<br />
partnership, shared responsibility, mutual respect, common interest,<br />
and common benefit, with the objective of APEC leading the way in:<br />
strengthening the open multilateral trading system;<br />
enhancing trade and investment liberalization in Asia Pacific; and<br />
intensifying Asia Pacific development cooperation. </p>
<p>3I<br />
the foundation of our market-diven economio growth has beeon<br />
the open multilateral trading system, it Is -fitting that APEC builds on<br />
the momentum generated by. the-outcome of t Uruguay Round of<br />
-Multilateral Trade Negotiations and takes the lead in strengthening the<br />
open multilateral trading system.<br />
We are planed to. note the significat. contribution APEC made in<br />
briuiging about a successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round. We<br />
agree to caMr out our. Uruguay Round commitments fully and without<br />
delay and call on all participants in the Uruguay Round to do the -same.<br />
To strengthen the open multilateral trading system we decide to<br />
accelerate tie implemnentation of our Uruguay Round commitmntsi<br />
and to undertake* work # Ined. at deepening und broadening tie out<br />
comec of-the Uruguay Round. We also agree to commit ourselves to our<br />
continuing process of unilateral trade And investment llberallzadon.<br />
As evidence of our commitment to thie open multilateral trading system<br />
we further agree to a standstill under which we will endeavour to refrain<br />
from using measures which would have tile effcct of increasing levels<br />
of protection.<br />
We call for the successfuil launching of the World Trade OrganIzation<br />
( WTO). Full and active participation In and support of the WTO by all<br />
ecnomies Is key to our ablity to lead the way in strengthening<br />
the multilateral trading system. We. call on all non-APEC members<br />
of the V/ TO to work together with APEC economies toward further<br />
multilateral liberalization. </p>
<p>4. CI<br />
64With respect to our Objective of enhancing trade and investment in<br />
Asda Pacific, We asre to adopt tho long-term goal of free and open trade<br />
and Invostment, in Asia Pacific. This goal will We pursued promptly by<br />
further reducing barrics to trade. and investment and by promoting<br />
the ftee flow of -goods, services and capital amnong our economies. We<br />
will achieve this goal in a OAIT-consistent manner and believe. our<br />
actions will be a powerful Impetus for further liberalization at the<br />
multilateral level to which we remain fuly-committed.<br />
We further agree to announce our commitment to complete the achievemerit<br />
of our goal of free and open trade and investmnent in Asia Pacific no<br />
later than fth year 2020. The pace of implementation will take Into<br />
account the differing levels of economic development amnong APEC<br />
economies, with the industriilized ecnomies achieving the goal of free<br />
and open trade and Investment -no litter tihan the year 20 10 and developing<br />
economics no later d= a the yea 2020.<br />
We wish to emphasize our strong opposition to the creation of an<br />
inward-looking trading bloc that would divert from the pursuit of<br />
global free trade. Wo are-detetmined to-pursue free and open trade and<br />
Investment in Asia Pacific In a manner that will encourage and strengthen<br />
trade and investment liberalization In the world as a whole. Thbus,<br />
the outcome of trade and investment liberalization in Asia PacifIc will<br />
not only-be the actual reduction of barriers among APEC economies but<br />
also between APEC economies and nion-APEC economies. In this<br />
respect we will -give particular ailcotion to our trade with non-APEC<br />
developing countries to ensure that they will also benefit, fromn ouir<br />
trade and investment liberaLzation, in conformity with GATTIWTO<br />
provisions. </p>
<p>4<br />
7. To complement and support this substantial process of liberallsaeioa,<br />
we decide to expand and accelerate APEC'a trade and Investment<br />
facil itation programs. This will promote further the flow of goods, services<br />
and capital amons APEC economies by eliminating administrative<br />
and other impediments to trade. and investment.<br />
We emphasi:. the importance of trade facilitation because trade<br />
liberalization efforts alone arm Insufficient to generate trade expansion.<br />
Efforts at facilitating trade -are important if the benefits of trade arc<br />
to -be truly enjoyed by both business and consumers. Trade facilitation<br />
has also a pertinent role in fuirthering our goal of achieving the fullest<br />
Uiberalizadon within tho global~ context.<br />
In paricular we ask our ministers and officials to submilt proposalsS On<br />
APEC arrangements on customs, standards, Investment principles and<br />
administrative barriers to market access.<br />
To facilitate -regionial Investment flows and to strengthen APEC's<br />
dialogue on economic policy issues, we agree to continue the valuable<br />
consultations on economic growth strategies, regional capital flows<br />
and, other macro-economic -issues.<br />
8. O~ ur objective to intensify development cooperation among the community<br />
of Asia Pacific, economies will enable us to develop more effec<br />
tively the human and natural resources of the Asia Pacific region so<br />
as to attain sustainable growth'and equitable development of APEC<br />
economies, while reduicing economic disparities among them, and<br />
improving the economic and social well-being of -our peoples. Such<br />
efforts will Also facilitate, -the growth of trade and investment In the,<br />
Asia Pacific region. </p>
<p>6<br />
Cooperative programs in this area cover expanded hunian resource<br />
devalupmout ( such as education and training and especially improving<br />
manasemcnt and technical sklils), the development of AY'EC study<br />
Centres, cooperation in scienci and tchnology ( including technology<br />
transfer), measures aimed at promoting small and medium scae enter.<br />
pises and steps to improve economic Infrastructure, such as energy,<br />
transportation, information, telecommunications and tourism. Effective<br />
cooperation wil also be developed on environmental issues. with the<br />
aim of contributing to sustainable development.<br />
Economic growth and development of the Asia Pacific region has<br />
mainly been market-driven, based on the growing Interlinkages between<br />
our business sectors in the region to support Asia Pacific economic<br />
cooperation, Recognizing the role of the businiess sector in economic<br />
development, we agre to Integrate the business sector in our programs<br />
and to create an ongoing mechanism for that purpose.<br />
9. In order to facilitate and accelerate our cooperation, we agree that<br />
APEC economies that are ready to initiate, and implement a cooperative<br />
arrangement may proceed to do so while those that axe not yet ready to<br />
parficipatc may join at a later date,-<br />
Trade and other economic disputes among APEC economnies have<br />
negative implications for the implementation or agrced cooperative<br />
arrangements as weU as for the spirit of cooperation. To assist in resolving<br />
such disputes and In avoiding 1W recurrencc, we agree to examine the </p>
<p>possibility Of A Voluntary Consultative dispute mediation service, to<br />
supplement the WTO dispute settlement mechanism, which should<br />
continue to be the primary channel for. resolving disputes.<br />
it]. Our Soul is an ambitious one. But we are determined to demonstrate<br />
APECs leadership in fostering f~ jrter global trade and investment<br />
liberalization. Our goal entails a multiple year effort We wil start our<br />
concerted liberalization process from the very date of this statement.<br />
We direct our minister$ and offcial to immediately begin preparing<br />
detailed proposals for implementing our present decisions. The<br />
proposals are to be submitted sQQoh to the APEC econom~ ic leaders for<br />
their consideration and subsequent decisions. Such proposas should<br />
also address all impediments to achieving our goal. We ask ministers<br />
and officials to give serious consideration In their deliberations to the<br />
important . recommendation contaned In the reports of the Eminent<br />
Persons Croup and the Pacif~ c Business Forumn.<br />
11. We express our appreciation for the importatit and thoughtful recommendations<br />
contained in the reports of the, Unitiont Persons Groups and the<br />
Pacdf&amp; Business Forum. The reports will be used as valuable points of<br />
reference in formulating policies in the cooperative framework of the<br />
community of Asia Pacific economies. We-agree to ask the two groups<br />
to continue with their activitles to provide the APEC economic leaders<br />
with asmesments of te progress of APEC and -further recommendations<br />
for * wpplng up our cooperation. </p>
<p>f<br />
W -also ask the Eminent Persons Oroup and the Pacific B uiness Forum to<br />
review the interreazonghps betwesn APEC and the existing sub-regional<br />
anigimtitis ( AFrA, ANZERTA and NAFTA) and to examine possible<br />
options to prevent obstacles to each other and to promote conslstency in<br />
their relations. APEC Economic Leaders<br />
