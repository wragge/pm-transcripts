STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
( RIGHT HONOURABLE R. G. MENZIES, M. P.)<br />
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES<br />
TUESDAY, 16th OCTOBER, 1962.<br />
THE PRIME MINISTERS' CONFERENCE AND THE COMMON MARKET<br />
The Prime Ministers' Conference which began in London on September<br />
was, in its own way, an historic event. I can well remember the time<br />
when there were five Prime Ministers sitting around the table. On this<br />
occasion, no less than sixteen nations were directly represented, most of<br />
them by Prime Ministers, but two of them by Ministers. Those who enjoyed<br />
direct and full membership of the Conference were the United Kingdom, Canada,<br />
Australia, New Zealand, India, Pakistan, Malaya, Ceylon, Ghana, Nigeria,<br />
Sierra Leone, Tanganyika, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, Cyprus, while, following<br />
practice established in the past, the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland<br />
was represented by the Prime Minister, Sir Roy Welensky. In addition, such<br />
countries as Malta, Singapore and Uganda were represented b'y their Prime<br />
Ministers, sitting as observers. This was therefore the largest Prime<br />
Ministers' Conference in history.<br />
We met in Marlborough House, the famous palace designed by<br />
Christopher Wren. We met, therefore, in a place which was, itself, full<br />
of history, and old history at that, but we were making new history. Out<br />
in Pall Mall there were many people standing with placards and banners, most<br />
of which expressed opposition to the Common Market. The press gave great<br />
space to the proceedings, most of the newspapers being, as far as I could<br />
judge, strongly in favour of Britain's entry into the Common Market.<br />
Now, in so large and diverse a gathering, it would not be reasonable<br />
to expect any high measure of unanimity. We were met . to consider a great<br />
economic problem which is also a great political problem. But on the economic<br />
side, there is an extraordinary mixture of interests. The countries of Asia<br />
were largely concerned with such commodities as tea, cotton textiles, jute<br />
goods, and other products of their developing industries; the African countries<br />
with tropical products;~ the West Indian countries with tropical products,<br />
including sugar, in which, of course, Australia has a very material and indeed<br />
essential interest. Canada, Australia and New Zealand were largely concerned<br />
with temperate foodstuffs, with raw materials Including certain metals, and with<br />
manufactures. Australia wa~ s also concerned with the way in which the products<br />
of Papua-New Guinea would be treated, including such products as copra and<br />
cocoanut oil. The countries of Asia were made offers which included the<br />
negotiation of special trade treaties between them and the European Economic<br />
Community. The African and West Indian countries were offered associate status<br />
under the Treaty of Rome, although most of them expressed an unwillingness to<br />
accept it. One has only to mention these problems even briefly to realise that<br />
we were not discussing at any given moment, any particular commodity in which<br />
we all had an interest; it became increasingly important to divide </p>
<p>-2-<br />
the proceedings into committee stages in which the nations interested in<br />
particular commodities could take part.<br />
Under these circumstances, it is not so remarkable that we<br />
failed to produce an agreed statement on all of the economic matters<br />
involved, as it is that we were able to produce a communiquf at all.<br />
I should say at once that the Conference did not produce anything<br />
particularly new. Yet I do think it quite important that certain of its<br />
features should be put on record.<br />
Mr. Macmillan, in opening the Conference, made a speech of great<br />
lucidity, a speech which expressed views which clearly he held very strongly.<br />
I thought that he made it quite clear that the Government of the<br />
United Kingdom had come to the conclusion that entry into the European<br />
Economic Community was of essential importance to Great Britain for both<br />
political and economic reasons. He stated quite explicitly that Great<br />
Britain could not expect to have any steady influence on the formulation<br />
of Community policy from the outside. He thought it reasonable to suppose<br />
that if Great Britain were a member of the Community, its influence would<br />
be important and might be decisive. He thought that if Great Britain<br />
remained outside the Community, it would be inevitable that the realities<br />
of power would cause the United States to attach increasing weight to the<br />
views and interest of the Six and other countries who might accede to them.<br />
He thoughtit inevitable that the United States and the Community would<br />
concert policy on major issues without the same regard for British views<br />
and interests as present relationships with Washington afford. He felt<br />
quite clearly that to lose influence, both in Washington and Europe, would<br />
seriously detract from British standing and would greatly impair the usefulness<br />
of Great Britain to the Commonwealth.<br />
I need not elaborate these matters. It is clear, and we should<br />
conduct all our own examination on this footing, that the Government of the<br />
United Kingdom has worked hard on the problem and has, under present<br />
circumstances, come to the conclusion that entry into the Community is<br />
something which must be achieved for the future of Great Britain and, in<br />
its view, the future of the free world.<br />
As honourable members know, we have never assumed to sit in<br />
judgment on this point. We see the arguments quite plainly, and we<br />
appreciate, quite soberly, their weight. Yet, as every Prime Minister.<br />
at the Conference agreed, the ultimate decision on these matters will be<br />
one for the United Kingdom and not for us. I will return to this matter<br />
at a later stage in order to express with more particularity the views which<br />
I offered on behalf of Australia. </p>
<p>3<br />
On the economic side, Mr. Macmillan said that his colleagues<br />
and he felt sure that the consequences of joining the Common Market would<br />
benefit Britain from the economic angle. This, again, as it related to<br />
Britain, was a matter for their decision. As I said in my final remarks<br />
at the Conference, we could not sit in judgment on that issue because there<br />
must be a mass of economic arguments for consideration, pro and con, with<br />
which we are not acquainted but which have, no doubt, been taken into account<br />
by British Ministers. It would therefore be as wrong for us to be offering<br />
an uninformed approval as it would be quite wrong for us to offer a blank<br />
opposition to the decision which, in principle, they have made.<br />
Towards the end of his opening speech, Mr. Macmillan made a point<br />
to which I later on referred myself. It is a point of considerable moment<br />
when we come to consider the effect that British joining will have on the<br />
existing structure of the Commonwealth. He recognised that, on the political<br />
side, the Community will either break up or grow stronger. This, of course,<br />
is quite true. I am not aware of any history of confederations or political<br />
associations in which there has not been either a tendency to break up or a<br />
tendency to become more concerted. I know of no example of such an<br />
association which merely stood still. Recognising this, Mr. Macmillan said<br />
that he believes that the European Community would be more likely to develop<br />
and to grow in political strength than to fall apart.<br />
The Prime Minister was followed by Mr. Heath, the Lord Privy<br />
Seal, who is the principal negotiator in these matters with the Community.<br />
Mr. Heath gave us, with great lucidity and care, an account of the progress<br />
in the negotiations in all their various fields. That he has been unflagging<br />
in concentrated hard work and devotion is quite clear. We all had a great<br />
respect for him and his work.<br />
In the case of the Asian countries and the African countries,<br />
considerable progress had occurred in negotiations. In the case of ourselves<br />
and Canada and New Zealand, the progress made has been extremely limited.<br />
In our own case, for example, there have been considerable discussions about<br />
world commodity agreements with particular reference to wheat. But on the<br />
other large matters that concern us, there was no progress to be reported.<br />
This means that in the negotiations which are now being resumed, very<br />
important Australian interests will be under consideration in relation to<br />
meat, dairy products, processed fruit, sugar, metals and so on. In other<br />
words, it would have been impossible for any Australian Prime Minister to<br />
give a general benediction to the British proposal to enter Europe, because<br />
we will not know for some time yet the terms that are to be secured for<br />
these important export commodities of ours. Until we know those terms,<br />
we will not be in a position to size up the effects for us of the bargain<br />
that is made. </p>
<p>4<br />
Having said these things, I would like to say something more<br />
particularly about our approach to what I will call the Commonwealth problem.<br />
I endeavoured to analyse the matter in this way. Did the United Kingdom<br />
expect Australia, in a matter so full of implications for her, and with so<br />
many factors as yet entirely unsolved, to pronounce a general benediction on<br />
the enterprise? This, I said,' was, of course, completely out of the<br />
question. Should we, going to the other extreme, object in principle to<br />
British entry? Should we simplify the problem by saying that whatever the<br />
conditions might be, Great Britain should not enter the European Community?<br />
Again I said that we could not possibly put ourselves in the position of<br />
objecting in principle, even though we had reservations in respect of the<br />
possible implications for the Commonwealth itself. But those reservations<br />
would not lead us into a position of blind opposition. The whole decision<br />
was one of historic and almost revolutionary importance. It would fall for<br />
decision by the Mother Nation, a nation of fifty million people, of great<br />
power and prestige and experience. It would not, under these circumstances,<br />
be appropriate for us to seek to dictate.<br />
These two extreme views being thus disposed of, I pointed out<br />
that how Australia at the final stages would regard the terms of the entry,<br />
as distinct from the entry itself, was a question which no Australian<br />
Government could answer in advance. On the contrary, we must completely<br />
reserve judgment. I then went on to' explain more closely the nature of what I<br />
regarded as the Commonwealth problem. The Commonwealth, of course, has<br />
sustained many changes. In the days of the Balfour Declaration and the<br />
Statute of Westminster, it was a community of independent and autonomous<br />
States, equal in all things but united by a common allegiance to the Throne.<br />
The common allegiance has gone, except in the case of the monarchical nations,<br />
like our own. The Commonwealth has become a loose association of nations<br />
who value their friendship with each other, who recognise, for the purpose<br />
of their association even though they be republics, that the Queen is Head<br />
of the Commonwealth, and who, with some notable exceptions, enjoy somewhat<br />
similar institutions and traditions of government. But it is still true,<br />
however tenuous the nature of the association, that each member is, itself,<br />
sovereign and independent.<br />
Now, what effect upon this body of ideas will be made by British<br />
accession to the Treaty of Rome? I am going to state the views which I put<br />
to the Conference. But I want to make it quite clear that whatever my<br />
views about the effect of accession upon the structure of the Commonwealth,<br />
I was not, and am not, prepared to say that Australia should seek to exercise<br />
a veto or use its not inconsiderable influence to persuade Great Britain not<br />
to go in on any terms. </p>
<p>The European Economic Community is, of course, at present far<br />
from being a Federation. It clearly hopes to have closer political union.<br />
Indeed, if it did not, it would be self-defeating. One of the great intended<br />
virtues of the European Community association is that its very existence and<br />
its mutual functioning will tend to reduce, and ultimately eliminate, those<br />
old hostilities in Western Europe which have twice in this century brought<br />
the world to the brink of disaster. Every European statesman will, therefore,<br />
naturally wish to see a closer and closer integration of political<br />
policies and a closer and closer economic co-operation. Under the policies<br />
now operating, there are large fiscal considerations. A common external<br />
tariff needs to be collected and this will mean very great sums of money<br />
presumably coming into some central treasury. Variable levies will be<br />
imposed on certain imports. These again have to be collected and handled.<br />
Inevitably there will be at the centre of the Community a large financial<br />
and administrative organisation exercising functions which, as we see them,<br />
are functions of government. They are not likely to be left indefinitely<br />
to officials, since the control of such great matters by a central bureaucracy<br />
would be inconsistent with British democratic ideas.<br />
It seems to me, therefore, probable that, unless the association<br />
disintegrates, there must be, at the centre, more and more a body of elected<br />
persons exercising the powers and performing the administration involved in<br />
the further working of the Treaty of Rome.<br />
The British Government says, and I have no doubt with the utmost<br />
good faith, that it is not contemplating a federation in Europe, that it looks<br />
at its political association in ad hoc terms, with periodical discussions<br />
between Prime Ministers, Foreign Ministers and the like, but without the<br />
creation of Federal institutions. I sincerely hope that it works out this<br />
way. But I keep remembering the undoubted truth of the proposition that<br />
political associations do not tend to stand still, that they go forward<br />
until they assume what we would call a Federal structure, or even a complete<br />
union in certain cases, or they come apart.<br />
The next point that I made was that, should the day come when<br />
the European Community became a Federation with Great Britain as a constituent<br />
State, then Great Britain would cease to be a sovereign community. It would<br />
assume a position quite different from that which it now occupies or from<br />
that which is occupied by Canada or Australia or any of the rest of us. My<br />
point was that in a Federatinno, State retains complete sovereignty; the<br />
sovereignty is, in a sense, i Each may exercise sovereign powers<br />
within its own field, but some of its sovereignty is shorn off and put into<br />
the central Federal authority.<br />
I took the opportunity of referring to the fact that this great<br />
issue of State sovereignty was at the very heart of the American Civil War.<br />
There had, in that country, been several schools of thought. One was that </p>
<p>6<br />
when the Federation was established, the States preserved their full<br />
sovereignty and that that sovereignty was paramount to the rights of the<br />
Union. Another school of thought was that State sovereignty was suspended<br />
by the Union, but was capable of revival by secession. And the third<br />
school of thought was that State sovereignty as a unitary whole was finl'ly<br />
renounced when the Union was effected. There can be no doubt whatever that<br />
the third view was established by the Civil War. If it had not triumphed,<br />
then the United States of America would have achieved nothing like the<br />
cohesion, and strength, and growth that it has since this disastrous episode.<br />
It seemed to me no more feasible to say that Great Britain's<br />
position in the Commonwealth would be unaffected by participation as a<br />
constituent State in a European Federation than it would be to say that<br />
Australia could join another great Federation and still remain an independent<br />
sovereign member of the British Commonwealth.<br />
Now, of course, one answer to all this and it has been clearly<br />
made in London is that Great Britain has no intention of going into a<br />
Federation. I repeat that this must be accepted, and that if she does<br />
not, then much of the comment which I have made disappears.<br />
I think that twenty years ago I might have become more impassioned<br />
about this matter, but the Commonwealth has changed a lot since then. Its<br />
association has become much looser. For most of its members, the association<br />
is, in a sense, functional and occasional. The old hopes of concerting<br />
common policies have gone. Under these circumstances, it may well prove to<br />
be the fact that even if Federation should be achieved in Western Europe,<br />
the anomalous position of Great Britain in the Commonwealth which would then<br />
emerge, would be regarded as no more anomalous than many other things which<br />
have been accepted, and with which we have learned to live. In any event,<br />
so far as Australia is concerned, nothing can shake us in our allegiance to<br />
the Throne, an allegiance which will always give us a very special relationship<br />
to many other millions of people in Great Britain and elsewhere.<br />
If I have devoted a great deal of time and thought to these<br />
aspects of the matter, it has not been with any desire to be pedantic or<br />
obstructive, I have merely felt it my duty not to let a great and crucial<br />
Commonwealth event occur without some record of our basic views.<br />
For the truth is that any argument of principle, any exposition<br />
of the hard practical realities of the Federal system, any traditional<br />
feelings we have, must yield the ground when it appears, as it does, that<br />
with all these considerations before it, the government of the United Kingdom<br />
has decided the political issue in favour of going into Europe. It is an<br />
historic decision. It involves great possibilities of advantage and disadvantage.<br />
There are material economic risks for us, to which I will return<br />
a little later. But, in the eye of the world, the major problem is for </p>
<p>7<br />
Great Britain. Should she find that her voice in Europe is less influential<br />
than she hopes, and that alien political and constitutional ideas prevail,<br />
her risks are clear. Should the economic balance turn out to be to her disadvantage,<br />
her risks are clear.<br />
Her government has considered all these matters, and has made a<br />
decision, at least in principle.<br />
Under these circumstances, I felt strongly that we should not<br />
lodge an objection in principle, saying " whatever the terms, you must not<br />
do this thing'" We have no right to say it. We have no desire to say it.<br />
On the contrary, when the negotiations have ended, and our consultations are<br />
ended, we will be well entitled to assess and state the economic effects for<br />
Australia. But on the great issue we will hope and pray that the British<br />
judgment proves right, and that a stronger, more concerted Europe will result,<br />
with advantages for the peace and prosperity of the world.<br />
This has been, of course, a difficult and anxious exercise.<br />
The temptation to engage in dogma has had to be resisted. While it has<br />
been, and still is, essential for us to battle for the best economic conditions<br />
for Australia, we have felt called upon to be careful not to create<br />
any impression that ours are the only interests involved, or to seek to<br />
force Great Britain into political or economic judgments which, in her<br />
considered view, might prove disadvantageous to her.<br />
In the end result, therefore, we devoted much time, and will<br />
devote much more over the next few months, to the protection and expansion<br />
of our own development and trade. We have avoided hard and fast ideas;<br />
we have not just sought, vainly, to preserve the status quo. For Great<br />
Britain simply cannot secure admission to Europe taking with her the existing<br />
structure of Commonwealth preferential trade. But we have sought fair and<br />
reasonable opportunities to sell, at remunerative prices, to Britain and<br />
Europe the commodities we can produce efficiently. We have, indeed, construed<br />
the British undertakings to us as meaning this. We will be bitterly<br />
disappointed if events turn out otherwise.<br />
In short, we have pursued a pragmatic approach to the economic<br />
problem, treating the political problem as one which is now beyond our<br />
jurisdiction, and making constructive proposals. As I said to the<br />
conference " If Commonwealth members, as individual nations, can have<br />
secured for them terms and conditions of trade which hold out a<br />
genuine prospect of increased access to the enlarged European<br />
Community at payable prices, and if Great Britain is right in<br />
thinking that overall increased trade with Europe will result<br />
from the enlargement of Europe, the Commonwealth changes will<br />
be accepted by many people, for purely practical reasons." </p>
<p>8<br />
I turn, therefore, to those aspects of the economic problem<br />
which affect Australia.<br />
The facts are that, both before and during the London Conference,<br />
we pursued a reasoned and reasonable course. It has to be remembered that<br />
Australia is not a party to the negotiations. Britain and the Six are the<br />
only negotiating parties. We have made clear both to Britain and the Six<br />
the nature and extent of our interests and have made constructive proposals<br />
towards safeguarding those interests. We have been positive in our approach.<br />
As I have said, we did not seek to retain the status quo. But, as so much<br />
of our export industry has been developed to satisfy trade outlets in a special<br />
Commonwealth structure, we have sought conditions which will preserve our<br />
access to Great Britain and the enlarged Common Market, will enable that<br />
access to grow as the Community grows and prospers, and will secure such<br />
access at price-levels which will allow Australia's export industries to<br />
grow and prosper. All this is quite fair. It is not greedy. It is not<br />
asking for guaranteed prosperity. It is not dogmatic or unreasonable. It<br />
merely says that, as the Treaty of Rome aims at increasing domestic prosperity,<br />
and an increase in world trade, Australia is entitled, in exchange for the<br />
British preferences she now enjoys, to her fair share in an increasing world<br />
trade on terms which will contribute to her own continued development. This<br />
is where we make our stand.<br />
I interpolate at this stage that quite a few commentators in<br />
London seemed to think that preferences operate only one way. This is,<br />
of course, completely wrong. It has been a system of great mutuality. As<br />
I pointed out at the Conference, Australian trade with Great Britain has for<br />
a number of years shown a substantial balance in favour of Britain a balance<br />
to which tariff preferences on British goods passing into Australia have made<br />
a substantial contribution.<br />
There is, of course, a view that even if Britain entered the<br />
Common Market on terms which, initially, involved some cost for us, it would<br />
be all for our good in the not so very long run because of the great increase<br />
in prosperity it would bring to Britain and to the other Common Market<br />
countries. This cannot be taken for granted. True enough, if countries<br />
abroad, whether they be in Europe or anywhere else, grow in respect of<br />
population and industrial output and general demand for goods, there is at<br />
least a first expectation that they will need more of the sort of things<br />
we produce foodstuffs and raw materials and the like and so our exports<br />
to them should increase. But it does not necessarily happen that way;<br />
not unless one other great condition is fulfilled. Growth and prosperity<br />
in industrialised countries may not mean very much to us if, instead of<br />
taking more of our commodities, they set out to produce them for themselves<br />
behind protective barriers. </p>
<p>9<br />
Have we reason to fear such a result in the case of the Common<br />
Market, enlarged by the accession of Great Britain? At least we have had<br />
some rather discouraging experience in recent years. For while growth in<br />
the E. E. C. countries during recent times has been very rapid, that unhappily<br />
is not true of our exports to them nor indeed of the exports of other<br />
primary-producing countries to them.<br />
I may be allowed to quote a few figures to illustrate this.<br />
Between 1957 and 1961 industrial production in the E. E. C. countries rose<br />
by 30 per cent outdistancing the growth of world industrial production<br />
through that period by 10 per cent. In the same years, however, exports<br />
of sterling area countries, other than Great Britain, to the E. E. C. countries<br />
rose by only 4 per cent. To other parts of the world they rose by a good<br />
deal more than this.<br />
I have taken first this group of sterling area countries<br />
mainly exporters of primary commodities because they are a wide spread<br />
group and therefore diversified.<br />
If we look at our own country alone we find that, through these<br />
four years when industrial output in the E. E. C. rose by 30% a quite<br />
remarkable increase our exports to them actually fell from œ 236m in 1957<br />
to œ 168m in 1961 a decrease of 29%.<br />
I know that particular factors contributed to this fall<br />
notably the decline during that period in the price of wool, which we sell<br />
in substantial quantities to Europe. But the larger fact remains while<br />
industrial production in that region was growing at a quite remarkable<br />
rate, our exports to it did not increase at all they fell quite heavily<br />
as the terms of trade moved against us.<br />
We therefore cannot lightly assume a ready and certain compensation<br />
for any loss we might suffer from British accession to the E. E. C.<br />
through a lift in the prosperity of Great Britain and Western Europe.<br />
Because the hard fact is that, as a first consequence of that act, there<br />
would be not a lowering of barriers to our trade but in the case of Great<br />
Britain, an extension of them.<br />
We are not alone in our desire for access and a fair price<br />
stability. Our discussions with the American Administration, both through<br />
Mr. McEwen and myself and the permanent head of our Trade Department, have<br />
clearly established two things.<br />
The first is that the U. S. A. as a non-member of the European<br />
Community, like ourselves, shares our lively interest in avoiding a state<br />
of affairs in which Europe becomes economically self-sufficient or inwardlooking.<br />
As exporting countries, we are both profoundly interested in<br />
I </p>
<p>maintaining and expanding our access to an expanded European Market at<br />
payable but not extravagant prices.<br />
The second is that, armed with the new powers of negotiation<br />
created by the Trade Expansion Act, the American Administration can contribute<br />
powerfully to negotiations with Europe designed to achieve the first<br />
objective. Suggestions of " panic", sometimes heard in Australia, are absurd.<br />
We are a sturdy and resourceful people. We have fought and will fight our<br />
battles in the world markets with vigour and determination. But we will<br />
not silently abandon positions which have been hard won and strenuously<br />
sustained. There are many communities in Australia largely dependent upon<br />
the British market. We cannot regard any of them as expendable. We will<br />
await the results of the negotiations, having in mind our own legitimate<br />
interests and the adequate safeguards which have been promised to us.<br />
What then, is the position as it stood disclosed at the end of<br />
the Conference, and stated in the final communique?<br />
I will not try to answer this question in detail. But I should<br />
say at this stage that while the Minister for Trade and I have been involved<br />
in the political and economic aspects of the Common Market, the Treasurer,<br />
in London, New York and Washington, was concerned with the special financial<br />
aspects of the problem. He was able to encourage and to report a rapidly<br />
growing interest in the problems of primary exporting countries, and the<br />
need for effective international commodity agreements. I hope that the<br />
House will have the opportunity of hearing from him.<br />
On the trade side, my colleague, Mr. McEwen, will fill many of<br />
the gaps in my present record. I take this opportunity to say that the<br />
Australian public will perhaps never fully know the full measure of the<br />
devotion he has shown, with no consideration of health or personal comfort,<br />
to the task of forwarding our interests in these great matters.<br />
Broadly, the first thing to record is that, save for " hard<br />
manufactures" and cereals, with particular reference to wheat, Australia's<br />
exports have so far not been negotiated with the Six, though they have, of<br />
course, been extensively discussed between Australia and the United Kingdom.<br />
In this category fall substantial items such as beef and veal, mutton and<br />
lamb, sugar, butter and cheese, metals, dried and canned fruit, wine and<br />
fresh fruits and leather. We cannot at present prophesy the outcome of<br />
the negotiations. Plainly, we cannot comment on unknown results. But<br />
we can and do say that anything like a phasing out of our present preferences<br />
and agreements by 1970 without some other proper provision for preserving<br />
our market opportunities, would be vigorously resisted by us. When these<br />
negotiations are nearing conclusion, it is agreed that we can have further </p>
<p>11<br />
conferences on the Ministerial level, either by ourselves or in concert<br />
with other interested countries.<br />
The second feature concerns the making of international<br />
commodity agreements. Australia has, for some years, been perhaps the<br />
leading advocate of such agreements, driven on by the steady decline in<br />
her terms of trade. It has become, particularly in recent years,. a<br />
characteristic of world trade that countries exporting primary products<br />
have seen a steady decline in the world price of these products, while<br />
their imports from the highly industrialised countries of Europe and<br />
America have risen in price. I will give one example. In the decade<br />
1951-61, Australia's export prices fell by 42/, while import prices rose 6%.<br />
Under these circumstances, it has not surprised us in the past<br />
to encounter on the part of some overseas countries, including Britain,<br />
considerable reluctance to make commodity agreements designed to produce<br />
a stable and payable price level for primary exports.<br />
In our London discussions, we asked for a dynamic approach to<br />
the negotiation of international commodity agreements.<br />
We argued that principles be followed on price, on production,<br />
and on trade access, and on a commodity by commodity basis, which would<br />
encourage maximum consumption, which would discourage uneconomic production,<br />
and which would offer security of access and stability of prices at a level<br />
remunerative to efficient producing countries.<br />
We argued that the internal price policies of the enlarged<br />
Community should be such as not to stimulate internal production so as to<br />
reduce the access of outside suppliers to their traditional markets or so<br />
as to prevent the expansion of commercial imports as consumption levels rose.<br />
We urged that talks between major countries interested in<br />
particular commodities should be called at an earlier date and certainly<br />
before the United Kingdom made its decision whether or not to enter the<br />
European Economic Community. For instance, we said that we thought that<br />
the G. A. T. T. cereals group might resume its discussion on wheat in the early<br />
part of next year. This would enable the possibilities as to the way in<br />
which arrangements for individual commodities might work out in detail to<br />
be decided in actual negotiations.<br />
We realized that in none of these matters could Britain declare<br />
a policy on behalf of the Community. What we sought to do, was to secure<br />
on the part of the British Government a full comprehension of our views<br />
and of our trade needs so that they would be reflected and pressed in full<br />
degree in the further negotiations. </p>
<p>12<br />
We indicated in a variety of ways that the forum of the G. A. T. T.<br />
should be used wherever practicable reconvening of its cereals group, the<br />
discussion of the Community's price policy, the negotiation, in a manner<br />
analagous to tariffs, of levies on agricultural products.<br />
We pressed this argument with vigour, especially in relation to<br />
the levels of world commodity prices.<br />
In the result, though we did not secure full acceptance of our<br />
views, I think it right to say that a material step in the right direction<br />
was taken at the Conference, with, in clear terms, the full concurrence of<br />
Great Britain. Thus, in paragraph 9 of the communique, a paragraph in which<br />
the expression " Commonwealth Governments" includes the United Kingdom, it is<br />
stated that " To meet the needs of the producers of agricultural commodities,<br />
Commonwealth Governments will support policies and initiatives<br />
designed to maintain and expand world trade in these commodities<br />
and to improve the organisation of the world market in a manner fair<br />
alike to producers and to consumers. They will support a fresh and<br />
vigorous approach to the negotiation of international commodity agreements<br />
to this end. In any such approach principles of price,<br />
production and trade access would need to be applied, on a commodity<br />
by commodity basis, so as to encourage maximum consumption without<br />
over-stimulating production and to offer to efficient producing<br />
countries adequate access and stable prices at a fair and reasonable<br />
level."<br />
Later on, in paragraph 12, which was inserted by the request of the British<br />
Government as setting out in summary form their own attitude, it is stated<br />
" Thirdly, as regards temperate products, the enlarged Community<br />
would make, at the time of British accession, two important declarations.<br />
One would express their intention to initiate discussions<br />
on international commodity agreements for temperate foodstuffs on<br />
a world-wide basis. It would recognise the greatly increased<br />
responsibilities of the enlarged Community by reason of its predominant<br />
position amongst world importers. The second declaration<br />
would relate to the price policy of the Community. While taking<br />
appropriate measures to raise the individual earnings of those<br />
engaged in agriculture in the Community, the Community would do<br />
its utmost to contribute to a harmonious development of world trade<br />
providing for a satisfactory level of trade between the Community<br />
and other countries, including Commonwealth countries. British<br />
Ministers considered that the policy which the enlarged Community<br />
intended to pursue would offer reasonable opportunities in its<br />
markets for exports of temperate agricultural products." </p>
<p>13<br />
References were quite frequently made to the need for " Trade not Aid". But<br />
this needs to be more than a slogan. The practical problem is well expressed<br />
in paragraph 7 of the Communique<br />
" They note with concern that trade and industry in the developing<br />
countries, as well as in some of the more developed countries which are<br />
large producers of primary products for export, have been adversely<br />
affected by widely fluctuating commodity prices and a progressive<br />
worsening of the terms of trade. They see this as a problem which<br />
calls for progressive policies in relation to international trade<br />
and finance so that demand for the products of those countries can<br />
be sustained and increased, and larger and more dependable trade<br />
outlets assured to them."<br />
We have throughout emphasised our belief that the expenditure<br />
of many millions on aid to developing countries defeats itself if the products<br />
of those countries are excluded from the markets of the donor countries. In<br />
other words, aid tends to defeat itself unless it increases trade. Commodity<br />
trading agreements which raised the price and increased the access of the<br />
export commodities of what I will call the new world by even a small percentage,<br />
would be of more value, for development and good will, than all the<br />
financial grants put together.<br />
If the proposed declarations about commodity trading agreements<br />
are vigorously followed up, with the prospective co-operation of the United<br />
States of America under its new Trade Expansion Law, some of our own problems<br />
may be resolved and the world's trade will be on the way to becoming healthier<br />
and better balanced. Before I conclude, I would like to return to what is, in hard<br />
fact, the core of the problem.<br />
That problem is access to the enlarged Europe, and fair prices.<br />
The Community as at present constituted arrives at its own price<br />
structure and mechanism. If Great Britain enters, she will be a party to<br />
these decisions. Are these to be arrived at without reference to outside<br />
suppliers? We believe that there should be, in a periodical way, consultation<br />
between the Community and exporters like ourselves. We see the<br />
established machinery of G. A. T. T. as ready-made for this purpose. Failing<br />
such consultation, we see, in the European market, a precarious future for<br />
our exports. We believe that Great Britain understands this problem and<br />
that, in Europe, she will exercise her influence in the direction which<br />
we seek. But there is a great responsibility on the present negotiators..<br />
We took the opportunity, in London, of reminding those concerned<br />
that the Six had a great responsibility not to insist upon conditions of </p>
<p>14<br />
British entry which would weaken either the growing members of the Commonwealth<br />
or the cohesion of the Commonwealth itself. We thought that the<br />
present community should be aware that its " grand design" of growing economic<br />
strength and the furtherance of international trade and prosperity could<br />
wholly or partly be defeated if the interests of the Commonwealth, so<br />
essential to the " grand design", were either set aside or materially prejudiced.<br />
In the result, the communique included the statement that<br />
" The representatives of the other Commonwealth countries<br />
expressed their hope that the members of the European Economic<br />
Community will wish to preserve and encourage a strong and growing<br />
Commonwealth, in furtherance of their own ideals of an expanding<br />
and peaceful world order."<br />
I add, for Australia, that the next few fateful months will show<br />
whether that hope is to be realised. </p>
