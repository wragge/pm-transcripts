ELECTORATE TALK<br />
Australia is to be the host country next year for the Fifth<br />
Session of the World Heritage Committee. This. Committee is<br />
responsible for considering nominations of cultural and<br />
natural sites for inclusion on the world heritage list an<br />
inventory of the wonders of the contemporary world being<br />
prepared under the convention concerning the protection of<br />
the world's cultural and natural heritage.<br />
The convention, to which Australia is a party, was adopted<br />
by the General Conference of U. N. E. S. C. O. in 1972. The<br />
session is expected to be held in Canberra in mid-October,<br />
1981, shortly after the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting<br />
takes place in Melbourne. Invitations are being extended<br />
to the 21 member states which constitute the Committee, and<br />
to other countries to attend as observers.<br />
Australia has already submitted nominations for the World<br />
Heritage List being compiled by the Committee. Two of our<br />
great natural assets Kakadu National Park in the Northern TErritory,<br />
-and the Great Barrier Reef, have been nominated. Kakadu, with its wealth<br />
of-Aboriginal art site s, is one of the first places nominated<br />
to the World Heritage List for both its natural and cultural values.<br />
In announcing the Government's i ntention to nominate Kakadu<br />
for possible inclusion on the World Heritage List at the Australian<br />
launching of the World Conservation Strategy in March of<br />
this year I stated that, " our action today in nominating<br />
this national park for these important world listings is a<br />
demonstration to the world not only of our belief that Kakadu is<br />
a valuable and indeed irreplaceable asset, but also of our<br />
commitment to conservation".<br />
Our actions in relation not only to the proclamation of<br />
Kakadu National Park and its nomination for World Heritage<br />
consideration but also our decisions to ban whaling in Austra-lian<br />
waters, to assist in the establishment of the World Wildlife<br />
Fund in Australia, to protect endangered species of birds,<br />
to preserve for all time Fraser Island, and, following the<br />
general principles of the World Conservation Strategy, to<br />
develop a national conservation strategy for Australia are but<br />
some of the measures we have implemented whi ' ch demonstrate<br />
clearly the importance we place on our conservation policies<br />
and programmes.<br />
Our commitment in this regard is clearly demonstrated by our<br />
policies for the protection and conservation of the Great<br />
Barrier Reef. no, W </p>
<p>2-<br />
These policies include the progressive declaration of sections<br />
of the Great Barrier Reef region as a Marine Park, the banning<br />
of petroleum exploration from the region, the development of<br />
a substantial research programme through the Australian<br />
Institute of Marine Science near Townsville and through<br />
marine science research grants to increase our understanding<br />
of the complexities of the Reef's unique eco-system and the<br />
establishment of a Commonwealth/ Queensland Ministerial Council<br />
to oversee the development and implementation of programmes<br />
for the protection of the Reef.<br />
It is clearly appropriate that the Great Barrier Reef be<br />
considered by the World Heritage Committee at its meeting<br />
in 1981 and given the universal esteem in which the Great<br />
Barrier Reef is held, it seems very likely that this nomination<br />
along with the nomination of Kakadu National Park, will be<br />
accepted by this international committee.<br />
The World List, which contains more than 80 places, has the<br />
capacity to capture the imagination of people everywhe * re, being<br />
evidence of the finest achievements of past and present<br />
civilisations and of our globe's remarkable natural phenomena.<br />
The acceptance of Australia's invitation to host the Fifth<br />
Session of the World Heritage Committee will provide us with a<br />
unique opportunity to demonstrate our commitment to the<br />
preservation and development of our unique cultural and natural<br />
environment. It also represents an international recognition of the important<br />
role we are playing in the field of preservation of Australia's<br />
heritage. I hope that it will prove possible for the members of the World<br />
Heritage Committee to visit both the Kakadu National Park and<br />
the Great Barrier Reef to witness at first hand their tremendous<br />
features which have been universally acclaimed.<br />
