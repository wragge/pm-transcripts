' ACQUARIE NETWORK WEEKLY BROADCAST<br />
BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE RT. HON.<br />
WILLIAM McMAHON, CH, MP. AUGUST 1972<br />
NURSING HOMES<br />
Interviewer Paul Lynch<br />
Q. Prime Minister, taking calls from listeners to<br />
radio stations on this and other sations. it is quite obvious,<br />
I believe, that while everybody knows that your Government is<br />
planning to do something to assist people requiring nursing<br />
home care, most people, including those eligible for such<br />
care, don't yet know, two weeks after the Budget, exactly what<br />
this eligibility is and exactly what you will be doing for them.<br />
PM: I can understand that and for that reason I asked<br />
my colleague the Acting Minister for Health to make a statement<br />
about it in the House yesterday. I will have a word with him,<br />
as soon as I get back to the House, to see if we can do more to<br />
make known to the public what the benefits are and how valuable<br />
they will be to people who require three or four different<br />
kinds of attention that is for pensioners themselves, for<br />
non-pensioners and what we call domiciliary care that is<br />
lookinq after peoDle who require nursing attention in their own<br />
hrmes. We will als give substantial subsidies to organisations<br />
that will go to people's homes and give them nursing<br />
attention when needed.<br />
Q. As I understand it I have had a look at the<br />
speech made by your colleague as I understand it, certain<br />
pensioners will, in fact, be able to get nursing home care without<br />
having to get anything out of their pockets or their<br />
family's pocket from January 1. Is that correct?<br />
PM: That is correct. You have got two different kinds<br />
of benefit one, intensive care and the other is ordinary<br />
care. Now the Commonwealth benefit will be in the first case<br />
that is, intensive care, $ 56 a week, and ordinary care,<br />
Now, this will mean that the pensioner himself, or herself,<br />
should be able to keep $ 6 themselves, and that is a marked<br />
improvement on anything we have had before. / 2 </p>

Q. Non-pensioners will still have to shell out,<br />
I understand, something like $ 15 or $ 20 a week?<br />
PM: Yes. Well, between that I think it is about<br />
$ 18 a week, because the non-pensioners will be covered by<br />
the National Health Insurance Scheme, and of course they<br />
will be expected to make some payment, remembering, of course,<br />
that some nursing homes will be treated as a home f~ or them,<br />
and they will be living there and not in their own home or<br />
with a relative.<br />
0. Prime Minister, one point which I discovered from<br />
Dr Forbes' speech, about which I had not been aware befDre,<br />
and this is that the Federal Government is from now on going<br />
to insist that any nursing homes that want to raise their fees,<br />
and which are participants in this scheme, will have to<br />
justify any such increase. This is something of a departure.<br />
PM: Yes, it is a departure, but I think a necessary<br />
one and a desirable one, too. Because if we are providing<br />
large sums of money, then we cannot have these institutions<br />
pushing up the fees that have to be paid immediately we<br />
increase the Commonwealth benefit. So we will require them<br />
to justify price increases, either before they become<br />
eligible for a payment, or if they wtqfl to increase the<br />
amount that has to be paid by a patient, they will have to<br />
justify that, too, or they will not get the increased<br />
benefit.<br />
Q. trime Minister, I am curious about one point,<br />
as discussed by the various Ministers of your Cabinet, and<br />
this is that not all nursing homes will be eligible for these<br />
new benefits, and only people who are attending the justified<br />
nursing homes will be enabled to get the new benefits. Now,<br />
why is this, and how many Australians do you think will be<br />
denied these new benefits as a result?<br />
PM: Look, I couldn't give you those figures, because<br />
I haven't had that problem posed to me before. But if you<br />
are asking me why is it that you requirB them to justify their<br />
prices, then it is simply for this reason. The Commonwealth<br />
itself is making a substantial amount of money available in<br />
order that the new type of nursing attention can be given<br />
whether it is domiciliary or whether it is in : he home itself.<br />
And, similarly too, with other kinds of benefits. Now we<br />
just couldn't put up with the idea that if we granted an<br />
additional amount, as we have, say, in the case of New South<br />
Wales of $ 10.50 for each pensioner requiring attention, that<br />
immediately the hostel, or the nursing home itself pushed<br />
up its fees so that there was no real benefit to the<br />
pensioner himself or herself, it would be intolerable. That<br />
is why we require them to justify the increase in prices.<br />
Prime Minister, thank you very much. </p>
