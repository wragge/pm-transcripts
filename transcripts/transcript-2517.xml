PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS: PM No. 10/ 19072<br />
PRESIDENT NIXON'S PEACE PROPOSALS<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr. William McMahon<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr. William McIAahon, commented<br />
this evening on President Nixon's statement made earlier today,<br />
Australian time, on efforts to-7.7ards peace in Indo-China.<br />
Mr. McMahon said all Australians would be pleased that<br />
President Nixon had made Public his imaginative and far-reaching<br />
propo~ sals for ending the fighting irn Indo-China on honourable<br />
terms. Fair-minded people would be impressed by President Nixon's<br />
account of the US negotiating efforts and the persistence with<br />
which those efforts had been carried on.<br />
It was a matter for raegret that the United States<br />
initiatives had so far met with a negative response from Hanoi.<br />
MLr. McMahon commended the statesmanlike attitude of<br />
President Thieu and Vice-President Huong in declaring their<br />
readiness -to step down while new Presidential elections were held.<br />
Mr. McMahon drewa particular attention to the following<br />
points in Mr. Nixon's statemqent!-<br />
" Both sides will respect the 1954 Geneva<br />
Agreements on Indo-China and those of 1962<br />
on Laos.<br />
There will be no foreign intervention in the<br />
Indo-Chinese countries and the Indo-Chinese<br />
peoples will be left to settle their own<br />
affairs by themselves.<br />
The problems existing among the Indo-Chinese<br />
countries will be settled by the Indo-Chinese<br />
parties on the basis of mutual respect for<br />
independence, sovereignty, territorial<br />
integrity and non-interference in each other's<br />
affairs. </p>
<p>2.<br />
" Among the problers that will be settled<br />
is the implementation of the principle<br />
that all armed forces of the countries of<br />
Indo-China must remain within their<br />
national frontiers."<br />
It was to be noted that it was now for the North<br />
Vietnamese to accept or reject proposals under which elections<br />
would be held under international sunervision and open to all<br />
political forces and parties in Vietnam, including the NLF.<br />
Needless to say, the Australian Government would<br />
welcome the achievement of a negotiated settlement under which<br />
hostilities in Indo-China would be ended. This would, amongst<br />
othe2r things, permit the withdrawal of the small Australian Army<br />
Assistance Group which is now engaged on training duties.<br />
Mr. McMahon said he looked forward to the detailed<br />
presentation of the joint United States/ Republic of Vietnam<br />
proposals. He sincerely hoped that they would be most carefully<br />
considered by Hanoi. It would be a profound disappointment to us<br />
all if the North Vietnamese reaction were no more than a repetition<br />
of its sterile demand that the United States bring the war to an<br />
end by, as President Nixon put it, " joining its enemy to overthrow<br />
its ally".<br />
CANBERRA, 26 January, 1972. </p>
