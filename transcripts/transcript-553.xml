Pr-OPENING OF NEWq SCIENCE LABORATORIES AT 4ESLEY<br />
COLLEGE, MELBOURNE<br />
ON 7TH JULY, 1962.<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon. R. G. Menzies<br />
Mr. President, Headnaastex Mr. Robson and ladies and Gentlemen:<br />
I always like to begin even the feeblest of speeches<br />
with a couple of preliminary observations, and the first one<br />
that I want to make to you is that the President of the Council<br />
is a man possessed of low cunning. ( Laughter) I have found,<br />
after many years in office, that if people write and say to<br />
me, "' vie would like you to do so and so on 15th of August, or<br />
whatever it may be and I am engaged on the 1 5th of August, I<br />
can honestly say how deeply sorry I am that I can't be there.<br />
( Laughter) But with great, low cunning, as he has practically<br />
admitted to you he said to me, in effect, " Now, do come and<br />
do this job Iand name your own date." ( Laughter) Well, you<br />
know, I don t want anybody to be encouraged by this example,<br />
but there's nothing more difficult than that. The only<br />
possible hope you have is to get out of the country. ( Laughter)<br />
And, believe it or not, I can't be out of the country all the<br />
time. ( Laughter) He also made a glancing reference to my<br />
majority. Well, as I said to an audience last night, I'm " 1it" i.<br />
( Laughter) ( Applause)<br />
But, Sir, one develops a certain amount of philosophy<br />
about these things. I've had the most remarkable experience;<br />
no doubt bred into me by this school. I've run a minority<br />
Government. I had a majority Government once which was sustained<br />
in office by one and a half Independents, ( Laughter) and each<br />
time I went back to the Lodge at the end of the week for dinner,<br />
I would say to my wife, " M1y dear, nothing but death can put me<br />
out of office before Tuesday." ( Laughter).<br />
Which reminds me Sir, that my wife is tremendously<br />
sorry not to be here. She? s not only been under doctor's orders,<br />
but doing frightfully well under them, I am happy to say. She<br />
is also becoming impatient of them, and therefore I have to say<br />
every now and then, " No. You shall not go." I don't think she<br />
can be all that well, because it is the first time she has ever<br />
taken my advice, ( Laughter)<br />
Now, Sir, I'm the least scientific of mortals. All<br />
I know about science is that a few misguided fellows in my time<br />
did chemistry, and they had a distinguished teacher who was<br />
known irreverently as " Bunse" l and some of them studied physics<br />
and some of them branched off into a mysterious thing called<br />
mechanics. All I know is that the only record you will find<br />
of me in the scholastic history of the school is in things like<br />
History, English, French and Latin. As for the mathematical<br />
and scientific subjects, having an indecently good memory, I<br />
was a master of the bookwork and didn't know what it was all<br />
about. ( Laughter) So I could get 50, and that, after all,<br />
oddly enough, was more than some people got. ( Laughter)<br />
Yes, Sir, I associate myself a great deal with the<br />
humanities, with those studies of humane letters which the<br />
world needs so much and which, perhaps, it tends to neglect<br />
not a little. But more and more in recent times, I've had<br />
borne in on me tha this world is changing almost at an<br />
explosive rate. The population of the world we used to<br />
think we knew about it will probably more or less double<br />
between now and the turn of the century. This presents the<br />
most colossal problem. More thousands of millions of people, ** e/ 2 </p>
<p>and in a world in which the pressure of population on the<br />
resources of the world comes greater and greater; where<br />
the mirrored problem of sustenance becomes more and more<br />
acute as years go on. And if all these problems are to be<br />
solved if they are to be solved on the principle of justice<br />
which cloesn't breed hatred between those who have not and<br />
those who have, then we, ourselves, must make a contribution<br />
in the field of science which will harness the resources of<br />
the world to produce more to feed more people, to give more<br />
hope, more skill, more productivity to other nations in the<br />
world. This business of scientific training it is not<br />
just a matter for ourselves, though we need it. It is something<br />
which will represent some measure of what we are contributing<br />
to the world. That is not to say that everybody is to<br />
become a scientist. I had a faint and friendly quarrel with<br />
a very distinguished scientist one of the most distinguished<br />
in our history, when he suggested one day that every Cabinet<br />
Minister ought to be required to have a scientific degree.<br />
And I thought, " Oh dear." ( Laughter) It would afford me a<br />
much-needed relief from office. I had no complaint about<br />
that but the idea of twenty experts sitting in a Cabinet<br />
really frightened me, rather ( Laughter) I wondered what<br />
would become of the real experts when they were being overruled<br />
by the political exports.<br />
But, Sir, it is true, profoundly true that this<br />
world, not only as we see it now, but as we look at it over<br />
the next twenty, thirty, forty years, with the eye of imagination<br />
in my case, this world is going to ru quire such added<br />
stores of pure science, such added stores of applied science,<br />
of technology, if it is going to sustain itself and raise the<br />
average level of wellbeing and of happiness. In other words,<br />
Sir, to come back to the point about the humanities, I think<br />
it is tremendously important that people should pursue humane<br />
studies, but they won't be able to in the future unless the<br />
scientists and the technologists have done their part to raise<br />
the standards of the world and to give us the means of justifying<br />
our own independent existence in Australia. Science, I<br />
see as the developer and the protector.<br />
Well, now Sir, you may be a classical scholar or a<br />
student of history or of literature and want nothing more than<br />
a library. I don't mean one of those great things, containing<br />
all those well-bound books that every gentlemen's library ought<br />
to include, I mean a library the books that you know, that<br />
you read, that you look at, that you turn to. This is all the<br />
reflective scholar in those fields will need an adequate<br />
library and there you are. But in science I was so<br />
interested today to hear Mr. Robson talking about the difference<br />
between his time and today. Of course there is a difference.<br />
When I look back, even looking through the door at<br />
these mysteries, at the rather sketchy equipment, the rather<br />
sketchy apparatus, I just marvel when I go into a well-furnished<br />
lab, today and see what is needed for these purposes; how far<br />
the boundaries of scicantific knowledge have been pushed. So<br />
far indeed that what was advanced in my time is elementary<br />
today. And this is as it should be. The more advanced the<br />
study, the more complex will become the apparatus needed, the<br />
mathods to be employed.<br />
E~ very time I speak with the Universities Commission,<br />
which is something that gives me satisfaction as I look back<br />
on it, I am reminded that in a new university, in the development<br />
of a university, the cost on the scientific side far </p>
<p>3.<br />
excels anything on the other side of university life. If a<br />
university is going to be a great university in the scientific<br />
field, then it must expect to spend hundreds of thousands or<br />
millions more on scientific equipment than it would on the<br />
side of humane letters in the old-fashioned nineteenth century<br />
way. Well, I acknowledge this.<br />
It has been my great honour and Mr. Robson has<br />
referred to it, to have been the promoter of a lot of new<br />
things in the university field and of vast expenditures in<br />
the university field in Australia. So vast that I don't even<br />
talk about them now until the last moment in case the Treasury<br />
overhears me. ( Laughter) But on the scientific side, no<br />
longer can things be done on the cheap. This is why this<br />
industrial fund seems to me to be such an imaginative affair,<br />
Quite frankly, Mr. Robson, Mr. Booth and Mr. Trigg, I had no<br />
idea that big businessmen were so imaginative. ( Laughter)<br />
But those limitations on their imagination which makes them<br />
fail to understand my Budget ( Laughter) have not prevented<br />
them from this tremendous conception.<br />
Think of it. School after school helped in a massive<br />
wdy to produce first-class scientific training&amp; And don't<br />
let us think of any training at school as ending when the boys<br />
leave school because thatis not true. The best of those who<br />
use these facilities will be in the universities6 The best<br />
of those who go to the universities will find themselves<br />
irresistibly drawn into post-graduate work, into research work<br />
and will provide the scientific leaders of the future. Right<br />
down through the line, we must aim at the very best that we<br />
can get and we can't get the best in the field of science,<br />
whatever the genius of the teacher, whatever the incipient<br />
genius of the student, unless you have the scientific apparatus<br />
that can be used. People like myself can achi. e: ve a certain<br />
amount of half-merited success scholastically by having good<br />
memories, by being able to read and learning how to read and<br />
learning how to remember and learning, I hope, how to think.<br />
But you can't teach science in the modern world unless you can<br />
also put into the hands of the student the things that are<br />
needed to illustrate to him, to give him the feel of the<br />
developments that have occurred in physics and chemistry and<br />
in a score of other subsequent and perhaps mere refined studies.<br />
So it is for those reasons that I am delighted to be<br />
here and I am particularly delighted to be here in my old<br />
school. I notice a few changes well hI don't mean individually,<br />
I noticed today with some astonishmcnt hat my contemporaries<br />
who are here today seem to me to look rather elderly. I don't<br />
understand it. lU putting that on one side, the one thing<br />
that I notice with regret is that in my day there were forms<br />
with backs and if somebody of a wicked disposition got in<br />
early at assembly and pushed the first one back, the whole<br />
of them went right back to the back wall of the hall ( Laughter)<br />
and this was received with magnificent applause. ( Laughter)<br />
It was regarded as the most instructive physics lesson for the<br />
day. ( Laughter) But now, I'm afraid Sir, with prosperity you've<br />
become respectable. You have chairs, but you can't prevent<br />
me from turning my<br />
m1 ' ind back to the fact that when I used to<br />
sit down in that corner, it was my pride and joy to look at<br />
L. A. Adamson and be frightened of him. ( Laughter) To look at<br />
Harold Stewart and be more frightened of him, with his gimlet eye<br />
and a most unfailing perception of the gaps in my knowledge of<br />
Latin. ( Laughter) But all came well on a Friday morning when he<br />
would stand up and sing, in a fine true voice much to our enjoyment,<br />
" W'hen I was a now boy, and an addle-hea ed cub".( Laughter)<br />
So my mind goes back to that, Sir new boy no longer, addleheaded<br />
cub only in the views of my more biased adversaries.,<br />
Sir, I have the very greatest pleasure in declaring the<br />
new rL 1ro </p>
