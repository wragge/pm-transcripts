A&amp; -My-(/ I<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA THURSDAY' ' JANUARY 19-81<br />
ERIC ROBINSON<br />
I was deeply saddened to learn of the untimely death<br />
of my colleague Eric Robinson. With his passing, the<br />
Government, the Liberal Party and the nation have lost<br />
a man of energy and conviction.<br />
Eric Robinson was first elected to the House of<br />
Representatives in 1972 as the Member for McPherson<br />
and was re-elected on four occasions. Since 1975--he<br />
served as Minister for the Capital Territory, Minister<br />
for Post and Telecommunications, Minister Assisting<br />
thezTreasurer and Minister for Finance.<br />
Prior to entering Federal Parliament and for a brief<br />
. period after his entry, Eric Robinson was President<br />
of the Queensland Division of the Liberal Party of<br />
Australia and brought to that role the commitment and<br />
concern for Liberal values that characterised his<br />
political career.<br />
There were times when Eric and I . did not completely<br />
agree. But the strength of his beliefs; the vigour<br />
and forthrightness with which he pressed his convictions;<br />
together with his personal and unselfish efforts to many<br />
people within the Liberal Party whom he helped and guided<br />
all these will continue to draw recognition and<br />
appreciation from us all.<br />
On behalf of my colleagues in Government and all<br />
members of the Liberal Party, Tamie and I extend our<br />
deep sympathy to -his *. fazily. 000---</p>
