PRIME MINISTER'S COMM1ENTS AT JOINT PRESS CONFERENCE BY<br />
HEADS OF GOVERNMENT FOLLOWING MEETING IN RUNAWAY BAY, JAM4AICA<br />
believe it has been a constructive meeting with Heads of<br />
State, and Heads of Government from a diverse group of countries.<br />
Out of the discussion of two days has come, I think, a remarkable<br />
degree of understanding, and at the same time a remarkable<br />
degree of recognised common interests and a significant area of<br />
agreement.<br />
We have discussed extensively, as you have been told, the<br />
North-South problems, but we also had an extensive discussion of<br />
problems within the developed world, within the major industrial<br />
world. Those discussions centred around the problem, the evil<br />
of inflation and the damage that it does to developed and<br />
developing alike, as Prime Minister Manley indicated in his<br />
opening remarks on behalf of all of us,-remarks which I share<br />
fully and support fully, not just on that subject, but on the<br />
totality of what the Prime minister indicated as Chairman.<br />
Inflation causes many social inequalities, it is devicive<br />
in a country, between countries, whether they are in the developed<br />
world or in the developing world. It leads to a lack of<br />
confidence of consumers, a lack of confidence in investment, and<br />
it leads to a serious and tragic loss of jobs an increase in<br />
unemployment. I think there was agreement amongst us in the inflationary<br />
situation in which we find ourselves, about the inappropriateness<br />
of Keynesian policies he wrote for a different age and<br />
different circumstances and most regretted that he still has<br />
some advocates in the present environment.<br />
But inflation, perhaps above all other things, leads to enormous<br />
and growing pressures for protection. It means quite clearly<br />
that developed countries can provide less assistance and less<br />
help, less access to their own markets for the goods of the<br />
developing world. In the inflationary circumstance, there is<br />
a slower growth of trade, the general market growth is much<br />
less than it needs to be. The problems of employiment in almost<br />
all countries could be overcome and that the very serious<br />
problems of poverty and the lack of adequate income from<br />
resources in the developing world could be tackled with sufficient<br />
vigour. I think to find again, a diverse group of countries,<br />
such as we are, having a common view about this particular<br />
problem is very useful and constructive. We expect certain views<br />
out of OECD, or out of GATT, but to have a shared interest and<br />
view on this subject from this meeting, I think, should reinforce<br />
all of us against the common enemy.<br />
I was pleased to see the advance that has been made in the<br />
Common Fund discussions and that the recognition that a Fund<br />
needs to be established. I am sure we will be bending our own<br />
views and efforts to make the next negotiating round a success<br />
and to resolve what difficulties remain. Its objective as<br />
we know, is stability, the advantage tCo producers and consumers,<br />
and second window operations I also regard as important in relation<br />
to the Common Fund. / 2 </p>
<p>Othere areas of assistance to the developing world were also<br />
discussed at length: the Stabex arrangements operated largely<br />
by Europe and the Lome Convention for many developing countries,<br />
but not for all; the compensatory finance arrangements of the<br />
International Monetary Fund both of which are directed towards<br />
in a sense, overcoming a particular problem of lack of exchange<br />
on the part of developing countries, and both directing themselves<br />
to a solution to that particular problem how one or other<br />
or both might be further or better developed.<br />
The discussions overall with the Prime Minister and colleagues<br />
I found very useful and constructive. As I indicated at the<br />
outset I think there was a remarkable area of agreement between<br />
us as the discussions unfolded. Quite certainly, from my part<br />
the perception and understandings of many problems have been<br />
greatly widened. I think this again is the value of an<br />
unstructured meeting, of people coming together for a free and<br />
plain exchange of views. Tolerance wasn't needed, but tolerance<br />
was, at the same time, was shown and exhibited in the room, and<br />
understanding was shown. I think that augurs well.<br />
Again, Prime Minister Manley, I would like to thank you for<br />
hosting the meeting, for chairing it, and for the very warm<br />
hospitality we have received over the last two or three days.<br />
Thank you very much indeed.<br />
