FOR PRESS 10 FEBRUARY 1977<br />
THE NATIONAL GALLERY<br />
I have expressed no view on any of the applicants for Director<br />
of the National Gallery.<br />
I have been pressing for a considerable time for recommenC. ations<br />
for Director of the National Gallery, and I have been<br />
concerned that recommendations have not been put before now.<br />
A report attributing to me certain views concerning applicants<br />
is without any foundation in fact.<br />
The matter in the first instance was one for recommendation<br />
by the Gallery Council. It will be Cabinet that will make<br />
the appointment. It is not my appointment. </p>
