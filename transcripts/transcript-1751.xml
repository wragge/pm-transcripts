FOR PRESS: RARPM. No. 4/ 1968<br />
U. S. BALANCE OF PAYMENTS<br />
AUSTRALIA U. S. DISCUSSIONS<br />
JOINT COMMUNIQUE<br />
The Economic Committee of Australian Cabinet and<br />
associated officials met today with the U. S. Under Secretary of State<br />
for Political Affairs, Mr Eugene V. Rostow, and his party. The<br />
discussions continued throughout the day.<br />
Mr Rostow came to Australia as special envoy of<br />
President Johnson for the purpose of explaining and discussing the<br />
short and long-term implications of the United States balance of payments<br />
measures announced on January I by the President.<br />
The talks were penetrating and frank.<br />
The Australian Government expressed full and<br />
immediate understanding and acceptance of the necessities which led<br />
the United States to take its action, and expressed its support for the<br />
overall objective of achieving a viable system of International payments<br />
adequate to the needs of an expanding world economy. It acknowledged<br />
the President's clear Intention to develop his programme of action without<br />
sacrifice of U. S. commitments in the field of security or of its<br />
contribution towards the needs of the developing world. This the Australian<br />
Government applauded. The Australian Government noted that the proposed<br />
adjustments were directed more particularly towards the countries In<br />
balance of payments surplus and expressed the hope that these countries<br />
would co-operate with the United States and other countries to achieve<br />
the goals of the programme. The Australian Government gave a first assessment of<br />
how some of the measures might affect Australia's economic position, and<br />
explained the special circumstances of Australia's balance of payments<br />
and reserves position arising from Its economic developmental needs and<br />
its defence commitments in the South-East Asian area. Ministers<br />
referred to the common Interests of Australia and the United States in<br />
world trade, In security, and In aid to developing countries.<br />
They expressed the view that the particular combination<br />
of circumstances affecting the Australian balance of payments made it<br />
necessary In the interest of both countries to keep any adverse effect<br />
of the U. S. measures to a minimum.<br />
To ensure this, there had to be a full understanding of the<br />
consequences of the U. S. proposals. These consequences would become<br />
apparent as the situation developed, and would require careful study over<br />

a period of time. For this purpose, -close consultation at both the<br />
political and the official level would be maintained so that the special<br />
interests and concerns of the Government of Australia would continue<br />
to be taken into account at every stage of the development of the<br />
United States programme. It was agreed that both Governments would work<br />
together with other governments in their continuing effort to build<br />
a unified and growing world economy based on the principles of<br />
international co-operation and international responsibility.<br />
