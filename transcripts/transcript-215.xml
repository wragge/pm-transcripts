P. M. No. 3j/ 1960<br />
CHAIRMAN OF COMMON LEAL TH GRANTS COMMISSION<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon. R. G. Menzies<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr. Menzies, today announced the<br />
appointment of a new Chairman of the Commonwealth Grants<br />
Commission, the statutory body ihich makes recommendations to<br />
the Commonwealth for the payment of special grants to the<br />
claimant States at Present Western Australia and Tasmania.<br />
Sir Alexander Fitzgerald, who has been the<br />
Commission's Chairman for 15 years does not wish to be reappointed<br />
after his present term expires on 30th of this mont'.,<br />
The Commonwealth Government has appointed Mr. P. D.<br />
Phillips, of Melbourne as Chairman of the Commission for a<br />
period of three years commencing on 1st October, 1960. Mr.<br />
Phillips has had a distinguished career at the Bar from which he<br />
retired in 1958. He retains a lectureship in law at Melbourne<br />
University. The new Chairman has a wide knowledge of Commonwealth<br />
and State affairs and has been active in matters relating<br />
to public administration. He was Chairman of the Victorian<br />
Transport Regulation 3oard from 1934 to 1937; Deputy Chairman<br />
of the Commonwealth Liquid Fuel Control Board in 1944/ 45. He<br />
has also served as Chairman of the Australian Institute of<br />
International Affairs and of the Victorian group of the<br />
Institute of Public Administration and as President of the<br />
Victorian branch of the Economic Society.<br />
The Commonwealth has re-appointed Sir Alexander Reid,<br />
of Perth as a member of the Grants Commission for<br />
a similar three-year term. The other member is Professor Wilfred<br />
Prest of Melbourne. The Prime Minister said that as Chairman of the<br />
Commonwealth Grants Commission, Sir Alexander Fitzgerald had<br />
served Australia with distinguished competence. He had taken up<br />
the post towards the end of 1945, which meant that his work<br />
spanned the whole period since the uniform tax system had been<br />
established on a permanent basis. Those years had seen immense<br />
changes in the Australian economy and in the relationships of the<br />
States with the Commonwealth and with one another. At every<br />
stage new difficulties had emerged and these had often had a<br />
severe effect upon the financially weaker members of the Federation<br />
with whose position the Grants Commission was especially<br />
concerned. With his colleagues, Sir Alexander had brought to the<br />
solution of these probelms great skill, tact and impartiality.<br />
Mr. Menzies concluded that the Commonwealth had always had the<br />
utmost confidence in Sir Alexander's judgment and so, he believed,<br />
did all the State Governments with whom he had to deal.<br />
