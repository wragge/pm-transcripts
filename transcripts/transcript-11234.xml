    <content><![CDATA[<p>With hope in God, the Commonwealth of Australia is constituted as a democracy with a federal system of Government to serve the common good.</p>
<p>We the Australian people commit ourselves to this Constitution</p>
<blockquote><p style="margin-left: 40px;">Â proud that our national unity has been forged by Australians from many ancestries;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">never forgetting the sacrifices of all who defended our country and our liberty in time of war;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">upholding freedom, tolerance, individual dignity and the rule of law;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">honouring Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders, the nationâs first people, for their deep kinship with their lands and for their ancient and continuing cultures which enrich the life of our country;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">recognising the nation-building contribution of generations of immigrants;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">mindful of our responsibility to protect our unique natural environment;</p>
<blockquote><p style="margin-left: 40px;">supportive of achievement as well as equality of opportunity for all;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">and valuing independence as dearly as the national spirit which binds us together in both adversity and success.</p>
</blockquote>
