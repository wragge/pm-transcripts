Democracy is at work here today, it has been at work in the United States of America as well. </p>
<p>If I could publicly acknowledge and congratulate the election of Senator Obama as the next President of the United States.</p>
<p>The great thing about Senator Obama was so much of his campaign was about hope.</p>
<p>It was about what we can do to change the world, what we can do together to tackle the great challenges the world faces together, the great global challenge of climate change. What we can do as a community of States, as a collection of peoples, as a organisation of States to act together on this great challenge.</p>
<p>And also the other great challenges of our age, including the global financial crisis.</p>
<p>But there is something more I think in Senator Obama's message.</p>
<p>It's so much about the inspiration from this individual himself and that is: this is a person who has come from an extraordinary background in American politics and risen to the highest elected office in that great American democracy.</p>
<p>I think he speaks as an inspiration in terms of his own personal journey in addition to his message of hope to the world.</p>
<p>We wish him well, we wish him god speed.</p>
<p>This is a great challenge he faces for us all.</p>
