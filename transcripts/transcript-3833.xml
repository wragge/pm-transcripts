SPEECH NOTES FOR PRIME 1MINISTER FOR CIVIC RECEPTIOIN, TUMUT,<br />
26 JULY 1975<br />
1, I AM DELIGHTED TO BE HERE TODAY WITH MY WIFE TO<br />
SHARE THE WARMTH AND HOSPITALITY OF TUMUT SHIRE. IT SEEMS<br />
LIKE YESTERDAY THAT WE WERE IN THE AREA TO HELP CELEBRATE<br />
THE TUMUT AND DISTRICT SESQUI-CENTENARY'WHICH EVERYONE<br />
ENJOYED SO MUCH.<br />
SON THE WAY DOWN FROM CANBERRA THIS MORNING I HAD<br />
ANOTHER LOOK AT THE SPECIAL SOUVENIR PROGRAM WHICH WAS<br />
PREPARED LAST YEAR FOR THOSE 150 ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATIONS,<br />
AND IT CONTAINS QUITE FASCINATING INFORMATION ON THE EARLY<br />
YEARS OF SETTLEMENT HERE, ESPECIALLY ON THE PIONEERING<br />
FAMILIES WHOSE TIRELESS EFFORTS FULFILLED THE VISION OF<br />
0 HUME AND HOVELL.<br />
S 2. I WAS ESPECIALLY PLEASED TO READ THE ARTICLE BY<br />
MY OLD AND VERY DEAR FRIEND, THE LATE FRANK GREEN, ON THE<br />
S ORIGINAL BATTLE FOR CANBERRA. MORE THAN ANYWHERE ELSE IN<br />
AUSTRALIA, TUMUT FELL AN EARLY VICTIM-TO SENATE OBSTRUCTION.<br />
BUT IT TOOK TIME, AS SENATE OBSTRUCTION ALWAYS DOES. IN<br />
THESE HEADY DAYS OF ENTHUSIASM FOR APPOINTING ROYAL<br />
COMMISSIONS, IT'S INTERESTING TO RECALL THAT AS EARLY AS<br />
1903 A ROYAL COMMISSION WAS APPOINTED TO EXAMINE SITES AT<br />
ALBURY, ARMIDALE, BOMBALA, LAKE GEORGE, ORANGE AND TUMUT<br />
AND TO REPORT ON THEIR SUITABILITY AS POSSIBLE SITES FOR A<br />
NEW NATIONAL CAPITAL. AND TOWARDS THE END OF THAT YEAR, THE<br />
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES DECIDED ON TUMUT, AFTER AN<br />
EXHAUSTIVE AND DOUBTLESS EXHAUSTING VOTE. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
I WAS THAT CLOSE TO BEING ABLE TO LIVE AT THE LODGE, TUMUT.<br />
3. BUT THE SENATE, IN THE WAY SENATES HAVEDECIDED<br />
AGAINST TUMUT AND SUBSTITUTED BOMBALA INSTEAD, THE HOUSE<br />
IN TURN DECLINED TO AGREE TO THE CHANGE AND THE BILL LAPSED,<br />
DOUBLE DISSOLUTIONS WERE A LONG WAY OFF. IN 1904, A BILL<br />
WAS INTRODUCED INTO THE SENATE, NAMING BOMBALA AS THE SITE BUT<br />
WHEN. IT WENT TO THE HOUSE, THE MEMBERS DECIDED AGAINST.<br />
BOMBALA AND SUBSTITUTED DALGETY. AND. PRESUMABLY BECAUSE<br />
NEITHER BOMBALA NOR TUMUT HAD WON, AND HONOUR. WAS VINDICATED,<br />
THE SENATE GRACIOUSLY AGREED TO DALGETY.<br />
THAT IS WHEN THE BATTLE REALLY STARTED OF COURSE<br />
BECAUSE DALGETY WAS OVER 200 MILES AWAY, AND QUITE BEYOND<br />
THE PALE.., THE NEW SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT OFFERED SITES<br />
ONLY AT TUMUT, LYNDHURST AND YASS AND-CONVINCED MEMBERS<br />
OF THE HOUSE THAT THE 1904 ACT HAD TO BE RECONSIDERED,<br />
4. IT TOOK UNTIL 1908 FOR ANOTHER BILL TO BE INTRODUCED<br />
PROVIDING FOR EXHAUSTIVE BALLOT ON NOMINATED SITES, AND TUMUT<br />
1WAS BACK IN THE RUNNING, ONLY TO BE DEFEATED BY CANBERRA IN<br />
THE END, BUT THE BATTLE CONTINUED IN THE PRESS, IN THE HOPE<br />
THAT THE SENATE WOULD REJECT CANBERRA, PLUS CA CHANGE.<br />
AND THE SENATE SUCCUMBED TO THE PRESS, AS IS ITS WONT, AND<br />
LOOKED LIKED DEADHEATING ON CANBERRA. Sa / 3<br />
I </p>
<p>t<br />
-3-<br />
SENATOR lCCOLL SUDDENLY NOMINATED TUMUT, WHICH<br />
WOULD HAVE SECURED CANBERRA'S SELECTION, SO THE DALGETY<br />
SUPPORTERS VOTED FOR TUMUT, RESULTING IN 18 VOTES EACH<br />
FOR CANBERRA AND TUMUT. IN A SECOND BALLOT, SENATOR McCOLL<br />
AS SENATORS SOMETIMES DO CHANGED HIS MIND, DESERTED TUMUT<br />
AND CAME BACK TO CANBERRA,<br />
THE DEAKIN GOVERNMENT WAS TOTTERING AT THE TIME<br />
THAT VOTE WAS TAKEN ON 6 NOVEMBER 1908, AND A WEEK LATER<br />
WENT OUT OF OFFICE,. TO BE REPLACED BY ANDREW FISHER'S LABOR<br />
GOVERNMENT. FISHER AND BILLY HUGHES THOUGhTTHE ARGUMENT<br />
HAD GONE ON LONG ENOUGH, AND PROBABLY SAW NO JOY IN ANY<br />
MORE UNNECESSARY TRIALS OF STRENGTH WITH THE SENATE, EIGHT<br />
DAYS AFTER TAKING OFFICE, PRIME MINISTER FISHER SENT A COPY<br />
OF THE SEAT OF GOVERNMENT ACT TO THE NEW SOUTH ' ALES<br />
PREMIER, WHOSE CO-OPERATION WAS IMMEDIATELY FORTHCOMING,<br />
STRANGE, ISN'T IT, THAT LESS THAN TEN YEARS AFTER FEDERATION,<br />
WHEN STATES RIGHTS WAS A VERY GENUINE PREOCCUPATION, A<br />
NEW SOUTH IALES PREMIER SAW FIT TO PUT THE NATIONAL INTEREST<br />
FIRST, REPLYING: " THIS GOVERNMENT IS ANXIOUS TO HAVE THE'LOCATION<br />
OF THE SEAT OF GOVERNMENT DETERMINED WITHOUT DELAY<br />
AND WE ARE PREPARED TO CONSIDER IN A LIBERAL<br />
MANNER ANY PROPOSAL OF THE. COMMONWEALTH IN THAT<br />
DIRECTION. To SECURE FINALITY CONCESSIONS MAY<br />
BE NECESSARY. THIS STATE IS NOT LIKELY TO<br />
INSIST ON A RIGID INTERPRETATION OF THE CONSTITUTION<br />
0<br />
AND I FEEL SURE THE PARLIAMENT OF THE COMMONWEALTH<br />
SWILL RECIPROCATE THE GENEROUS SPIRIT IN WHICH WE<br />
ARE PREPARED TO DEAL WITH THE SUBJECT." </p>
<p>-4-<br />
PEHAPS I SHOULD SEND A COPY OF THAT GRACIOUS MISSIVE TO<br />
MR LEWIS,<br />
6. I CAN'T SAY NOW THAT I REGRET THE DECISION TAKEN<br />
BY OUR PREDECESSORS EIGHT YEARS BEFORE I WAS BORN. TUMUT<br />
IS A MUCH MORE RELAXING PLACE FOR NOT BEING THE FEDERAL<br />
CAPITAL, AND I'M SURE ITS CITIZENS LIVE LONGER. THIS<br />
AFTERNOON I'M TO MEET THREE RESIDENTS TO BE OF BLAKENEY<br />
LODGE. THEIR COMBINED AGES ADD UP-TO 253 YEARS, I'M<br />
SURE THEY RECALL THE CAPITAL CONTROVERSY; I WOULD BE<br />
SURPRISED IF THEY WOULD HAVE WANTED TUMUT TO CHANGE TOO<br />
MUCH IN THE LAST 80 YEARS.<br />
7, ALTHOUGH TUMUT HAS NOT LOST ANY OF ITS CHARM,<br />
IT HAS BEEN CLOSE TO AND AFFECTED BY ONE OF THE GREATEST<br />
ENGINEERING UNDERTAKINGS OF THIS CENTURY, THE SNOWY IMOUNTAINS<br />
O SCHEME. BEGUN BY BEN CHIFLEY'S LABOR GOVERNMENT IN 1949;<br />
THE $ 800 MILLION SCHEME HAS PROVIDED STIMULUS AND EMPLOYMENT.<br />
O IN AND AROUND TUMUT CULMINATING IN THE COMPLETION LAST<br />
FINANCIAL YEAR OF THE CONSTRUCTION OF TUMUT 3, THE LAST AND<br />
SLARGEST OF THE SNOWY PROJECTS. BUT THAT FACT SHOULD NOT BE<br />
THOUGHT OF AS AN ENDING ONLY, RATHER IT IS THE END OF THE<br />
-BEGINNING, BECAUSE TUMUT IS ONE OF THE GATEWAYS TO THE SCHEME<br />
AND TO ALL THE TOURIST AND RECREATION FACILITIES IT HAS OPENED UP,<br />
a </p>
<p>I KNOW THE SHIRE COUNCIL IS ANXIOUS TO PURSUE<br />
NEW EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE PEOPLE OF TUMUT, AND<br />
THAT MUCH THOUGHTFUL WORK HAS BEEN DONE IN THIS REGARD,<br />
I HAVE READ WITH INTEREST, FOR EXAMPLE, THE CASE YOU HAVE<br />
PREPARED ON THE POSSIBILITY OF LOCATING A PULP AND PAPER<br />
MILL FOR TUMUT, I UNDERSTAND YOUR RESERVATIONS AS WELL AS<br />
YOUR ASPIRATIONS FOR ROAD CONSTRUCTION IN THE AREA, AND<br />
YOUR POSITION IN RELATION TO THE CURRENT CLIMATE FOR RURAL<br />
INDUSTRIES, INEVITABLY AFFECTED AT PRESENT BY WORLD ECONOMIC<br />
-TRENDS. I LOOK FORWARD TO MEETING AND, IN MANY CASES TO<br />
RENEWING ACQUAINTANCE WITH COUNCILLORS AND THEIR WIVES WHO<br />
CAN GIVE ME THE MOST UP TO DATE INFORMATION ON THE PROBLEMS<br />
AS WELL AS THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE TUMUT SHIRE.<br />
8, I MUST SAY I AM ALWAYS PLEASED TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY<br />
. TO DISCUSS THE BROADER ISSUES OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT AT GRASS ROOTS<br />
LEVEL-I TAKE GREAT PRIDE IN THE FACT THAT MY GOVERNMENT,<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN LABOR GOVERNMENT, HAS GONE OUT OF ITS WAY TO<br />
DEMONSTRATE ITS REAL INTEREST AND CONCERN FOR THE THIRD TIER<br />
OF GOVERNMENT, THE ONE CLOSEST TO THE PEOPLE, THE LEVEL OF<br />
GOVERNMENT MOST IGNORED BY OUR COALITION PREDECESSORS. ONLY<br />
LAST YEAR WE LEGISLATED TO PROVIDE FOR THE ALLOCATION OF<br />
DIRECT FEDERAL GOVERNMENT GRANTS TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT, DIRECT<br />
GRANTS BASED ON THE CASE ADVANCED IN EACH INSTANCE AT THE<br />
GRANTS COMMISSION HEARINGS, AND, SIGNIFICANTLY, WITH NO<br />
STRI NGS ATTACHED. I BELIEVE TUMUT SHIRE COUNCIL RECEIVED<br />
$ 126,000 LAST YEAR AND I AM QUITE SURE YOU HAVE PUT UP A SOUND<br />
AND PROPER CASE FOR THE NEW FINANCIAL YEAR,<br />
dsC </p>
<p>-6-<br />
9. I KNOW THAT TUMUT, LIKE THE REST OF AU'STRALIA,<br />
HAS SUFFERED FROM THE WORLD-WIDE ECONOMIC RECESSION AND<br />
SUBSEQUENT UNEMPLOYMENT.<br />
RED SCHEME GRANTS HAVE GONE SOME WAY TOWARDS<br />
ALLEVIATING IMMEDIATE LOCALISED UNEMPLOYMENT. IN ALL boo<br />
HAS BEEN ALLOCATED TO 26 PROJECTS INVOLVING / 62 JOBS,<br />
MAJOR SHIRE COUNCIL UNDERTAKINGS HAVE INCLUDED ROAD REPAIR<br />
AND MAINTENANCE WORK FOR 20 MEN FOR 16 WEEKS ($ 30,000),<br />
AND $ 24,000 FOR WORK ON REPAIRING AND EXTENDING THE TUMUT<br />
BOYS CLUB HALL, ANOTHER GRANT OF $ 25,400 MEANT 15 WEEKS<br />
WORK FOR 8 MEN EMPLOYED ON RECREATIONAL PROJECTS OF<br />
CONTINUING BENEFIT TO THE COMMUNITY,<br />
THE NIATIONAL RURAL ADVISORY COUNCIL SET UP BY<br />
SENATOR ' IRIEDT IS KEENLY AWARE OF THE PROBLEMS OF THE MAN<br />
AND WOMAN ON THE LAND, AND IS CURRENTLY ENGAGED IN A<br />
DETAILED STUDY OF HOW TO ATTRACT YOUNG PEOPLE INTO FARMING,<br />
AS WELL AS LOOKING INTO EMPLOYMENT ALTERNATIVES WHICH WOULD<br />
ENABLE OLDER PEOPLE TO LEAVE THE LAND EARLIER, IF THEY SO<br />
WISH. THE QUESTION OF FARMER CO-OPERATIVES'IS ALSO BEING<br />
STUDIED. ALL THIS WORK TOUCHES ON SOME OF TUMUT'S RURAL<br />
PROBLEMS. ./ 7 </p>
<p>-7-<br />
11, THE AUSTRALIAN APPLE AND PEAR CORPORATION SET UP.<br />
LAST SEPTEMBER HAS RECEIVED A GRANT OF $ 200,000 TO FINANCE<br />
MARKET RESEARCH PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCT PROMOTION<br />
ACTIVITIES. IN ADDITION TO SEEKING TO DIVERSIFY EXPORT<br />
MARKETS, THE CORPORATION HAS MOUNTED A 1975 SEASON<br />
PROMOTION CAMPAIGN TO STIMULATE CONSUMER DEMAND FOR APPLES.<br />
WE CAN EXPECT THIS TO HAVE AN IMPACT ON APPLE PRODUCTION HERE<br />
IN THE BATLOW TUMUT AREA. ALTHOUGH FRESH APPLE PRICES INSYDNEY<br />
THIS YEAR HAVE BEEN SLIGHTLY BELOW COMPARABLE 1974<br />
LEVELS, THEY ARE SUBSTANTIALLY ABOVE. COMPARABLE 1973 LEVELS,<br />
O OBVIOUSLY A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.<br />
As FAR AS THE FRUIT CANNING INDUSTRY IS CONCERNED,<br />
THE PICTURE IS BRIGHTER, BECAUSE THE 1974/ 75 TOTAL QUANTITY OF<br />
CANNING FRUIT HAS INCREASED BY 12.5 PER CENT, AND PRICES<br />
FOR APRICOTS ARE UP 32 PER CENT, PEACHES ARE UP 36 PER CENT<br />
AND PEARS ARE UP 12 PER CENT OVER THE PREVIOUS YEAR. THE<br />
INCREASE IN BOTH PRICES AND PRODUCTION INDICATE THAT GROSS<br />
RETURNS TO GROWERS WILL BE UP ON LAST SEASON.<br />
A NEW NATIONAL PANEL OF VEGETABLE GROWERS AND PROCESSORS<br />
OF PEAS AND BEANS HAS RECENTLY BEEN ESTABLISHED TO BRING<br />
PEOPLE TOGETHER TO. DISCUSS THE LONG-TERM FUTURE OF THE<br />
INDUSTRY AND CONTRACT CONDITIONS. STANDARDISATION OF CONTRACTS,<br />
PRICE RELATIVITIES, PRODUCTION AND MARKETING WILL ALL BE-.<br />
DISCUSSED BY ThE PANEL WITH OBVIOUS BENEFIT TO PRODUCERS IN<br />
THIS AREA. </p>
<p>r -8-<br />
12. ALTHOUGH THE FOREST INDUSTRIES AT TUMUT, AS<br />
ELSEWHERE IN AUSTRALIA, ARE AT PRESENT SOMEWHAT DEPRESSED AS<br />
A RESULT OF SOME DOWNTURN IN THE BUILDING INDUSTRY, THE<br />
FEDERAL DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE ASSURES ME THAT THE<br />
SLONG TERM FUTURE OF THOSE INDUSTRIES IN THE TUMUT REGION IS.<br />
S CONSIDERED TO BE QUITE BRIGHT.<br />
W BEEF PRODUCERS CAN TAKE HEART FROM THE FACT THAT<br />
WE ARE DOING EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO DEVELOP MEAT MARKETS<br />
AND REDUCE ARTIFICIAL TRADE BARRIERS, You MAY RECALL THAT.<br />
S. IN APRIL THIS YEAR, SENATOR WRIEDT ANNOUNCED AN AUSTRALIAN<br />
GOVERNMENT CONTRIBUTION OF $ 19,6 MILLION TO MATCH THE STATES IN<br />
CARRY-ON FINANCE FOR AUSTRALIAN BEEF PRODUCERS. THIS IS<br />
AVAILABLE TO FARMERS AT L PER CENT INTEREST WITH NO INTEREST<br />
ON CAPITAL PAYMENTS FOR THE FIRST TWELVE MONTHS, AND OF<br />
b COURSE IT WILL BE A GREAT HELP TO VERY MANY PEOPLE, BUT<br />
CE'RTAINLY IN THE SHORT TERM BEEF PRODUCERS ARE GOING THROUGH<br />
A DIFFICULT PERIOD.<br />
13. BUT, LIKE THOSE MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES<br />
WHO OVER SEVENTY YEARS AGO EXPRESSED THE-IR BELIEF IN TUMUT,<br />
I AM CONVINCED THAT THE LONG-TERM FUTURE OF TUMUT IS EXCELLENT.<br />
I THINK YOU ALL FOR THE MARBLE GIFT WHICH WILL REMIND ME OF<br />
YOUR KINDNESS AND HOSPITALITY TODAY IN TUMUT. </p>
