PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 13 JUNE 1991<br />
I am pleased to announce that the Queen has approved Letters<br />
Patent and Regulations establishing a new award to recognise<br />
the contributions of members of Australian police forces who<br />
serve with international peacekeeping organisations.<br />
The Award will be known as the Police Overseas Service<br />
Medal. Awards of the Medal will be made by the Governor-General on<br />
the recommendation of the Chief Officer of an Australian<br />
police force.<br />
The Medal will be placed directly after the Australian<br />
Service Medal in the Australian Order of Precedence of<br />
Honours and Awards.<br />
Arrangements are in hand for the manufacture of the insignia<br />
of the award which was designed by Mr Stuart Devlin AO CMG.<br />
Australian police men and women who have served in Cyprus<br />
will be entitled to wear the Police Overseas Service Medal<br />
as well as the United Nations Medal for Service in Cyprus. </p>
