TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
ADDRESS AT THE OPENING OF THE R. G. CASEY BUILDING<br />
BARTON, CANBERRA<br />
E&amp; EO<br />
Thank you very much Alexander; to my other Ministerial colleagues; to Gareth Evans,<br />
the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, and most particularly to three former Prime<br />
Ministers Sir John Gorton, Mr Gough Whitlam and Mr Malcolm Fraser. And as I look<br />
around the room I really am reminded that gathered here today are people who, either<br />
themselves or through their direct family connections, were influential in or shaped the<br />
Foreign Affairs and Trade policies of Australia over a very long period of time. As well<br />
as, of course, acknowledging the presence of the late Dr Evatt's daughter and the grand<br />
daughter of the late Lord Casey. I also, of course, acknowledge the presence of the<br />
daughter of Australia's longest serving Prime Minister, Mrs Heather Henderson, and her<br />
husband, Mr Peter Henderson, himself a former Secretary of the Department of Foreign<br />
Affairs. I really am delighted to be here today to open this magnificent building, to say a few<br />
words about the legacy of Richard Casey to the conduct of Australian foreign policy and<br />
also a few things about the contemporary viewpoint of foreign policy.<br />
You might ask why it is that this building should be named after Richard Gardiner Lord<br />
Casey. One reason the obvious one already stated by the Foreign Minister was that he<br />
was our longest-serving foreign minister, serving in that capacity for nine years under the<br />
prime ministership of Robert Menzies from April 1951 to January 1960.<br />
While that record length of service by itself makes Casey a very appropriate choice, there<br />
are other compelling reasons. Casey's nine years as foreign minister were only one<br />
highlight of a remarkably varied and distinguished public life which spanned almost half a<br />
century. As well as other ministerial appointments in the Lyons and Menzies governments, Casey<br />
served as Australia's first political liaison officer in London from 1924 to 193 1.<br />
Although he was not officially described as such, he was Australia's first ambassador in<br />
Washington in the second world war years, from 1940 to 1942. He was minister of state </p>
<p>for the Middle East in the British war cabinet from 1943 to 1944, followed by two years<br />
as Governor of Bengal. His public life culminated when he was appointed Governor-<br />
General of Australia in 1965, and if my political memory serves me correctly, he was<br />
defeated I don't know how narrowly by the then R G Menzies for leadership of the<br />
United Australia Party after the death of Lyons in the late 1930Os.<br />
Casey's public career was marked not just by its length and diversity. It was a career<br />
distinguished by the personal qualities and values including a deep integrity, honour and<br />
abiding respect for others with which Casey lived out his public duties, and by which he<br />
lived through the eighty-six years of his life.<br />
Walter Crocker captured well the essence of Casey when he wrote of him: ' He was not<br />
an ideologist of any hue or shape. His loyalty was to the truth and to good government'.<br />
In the past, some people questioned his Australianness. What a furphy. He gave<br />
unstinting commitment to Australia, from the time he joined the Australian Imperial<br />
Force in 1914, including his service on Gallipoli and later on the Western front.<br />
Much of his life was spent living or travelling abroad. He had an enormous range of<br />
personal contacts friends, colleagues, acquaintances in Britain, the United States,<br />
Europe and Asia. He did feel a special affinity with Britain. But for all his overseas<br />
experiences and connections, Casey's home was Australia. He remained an Australian at<br />
heart wherever he was.<br />
So it's very fitting to name this building after such an eminent and honourable Australian.<br />
And it also happens to commemorate the twentieth anniversary of his death.<br />
The naming of the building also reminds us that both sides of politics have made major<br />
contributions over the years to Australia's international achievements. Apart from Casey<br />
himself, the contributions of Dr Evatt, Sir John McEwen, Doug Anthony, who I noticed<br />
has arrived and is sitting down at the rear of the hall, and Gareth Evans who all served<br />
as Ministers for Trade or Foreign Affairs for over seven years are all recognised<br />
appropriately by having areas of the building or its surroundings named after them.<br />
We are reminded by the presence of so many former Prime Ministers here today of the<br />
role played in shaping Australia's foreign relations by both sides of Australian politics. It<br />
was under Malcolm Fraser's government, for example, of which I was a member, that<br />
Australia welcomed more Indo-Chinese refugees per capita than any other nation in the<br />
world. As Prime Minister, Gough Whitlam opened up our modern relationship with<br />
China. A relationship to be built upon in different ways by successive Prime Ministers<br />
from both sides of the political fence, and a relationship which remains as important, if<br />
not more important, to Australia today than it was in the early 1970s. John Gorton was<br />
responsible on the Australian side for the Five Power Defence Arrangements which<br />
remain an important element in the security of Malaysia and Singapore.<br />
It is fitting, given the occupant of the building, that Casey's preoccupations and legacy as<br />
Foreign Minister mesh so well, today and into the future, with the pursuit of Australia's<br />
national interests through our foreign and trade policies. </p>
<p>While Casey's term as Foreign Minister was marked by many achievements, two have<br />
particular resonance in laying the groundwork for Australia's strong engagement today in<br />
the Asia-Pacific region.<br />
The first was his leadership, to which Alexander has already referred, in building links<br />
with Asian nations.<br />
On Casey's retirement as minister for external affairs, the then Prime Minister, Sir<br />
Robert Menzies, said in tribute that Casey had ' done more than any other man to<br />
cultivate friendship with our Asian neighbours, and to improve the mutual understanding<br />
which is the true foundation of peace'.<br />
From the outset, Casey was in no doubt, as he remarked in an August 1951 entry in his<br />
voluminous diaries that, and I quote:-' South-east Asia is of the greatest importance to<br />
Australia'. That conviction was expressed in his energetic and productive pursuit of<br />
closer relations with the countries he called Australia's ' friends and neighbours'.<br />
Casey's statements during his visit to Japan in 1951 were seen then and since to have<br />
marked the first real movement from enmity to close cooperation between Australia and<br />
Japan after the end of World War II. He foresaw the importance of bringing China into<br />
the international community.<br />
Casey's was a practical approach. He established and widened his personal contacts with<br />
regional leaders. He expanded Australia's diplomatic representation in the Asia region.<br />
He promoted the humanitarian and strategic value of technical and other assistance<br />
through the Colombo Plan. He played a vital role in negotiating the SEATO treaty.<br />
He took issue very strongly with the White Australia policy. He saw the White Australia<br />
policy, and the way in which it was implemented, as an unnecessary and offensive barrier<br />
to Australia's relations with our neighbours. He worked against it in a quiet but<br />
persistent way, helping to prepare the ground for its eventual abolition.<br />
At the end of his term, Casey was able to reflect, with justified satisfaction, that<br />
' Australia was accepted in South-east Asia as a country with a significant interest in the<br />
region, seeking relations of good will and cooperation and prepared to make a tangible<br />
contribution to the management of the region's problems'.<br />
In a speech marking Casey's death, Gough Whitlam then leader of the Opposition said<br />
that Casey was one of the first Australian statesmen to recognise the importance of Asia<br />
to Australia. He said that Casey, and I quote:-' had a regard, almost a love, for Asians<br />
which was free of sentimentality and rooted in a knowledge of their history and the<br />
diverse cultures of the region'.<br />
It is on the foundation established by him that we continue to build our engagement with<br />
our neighbours and make our strong contribution to the Asia-Pacific region today.<br />
His second achievement of enduring importance was the deepening of Australia's<br />
relations with the United States. </p>
<p>He was convinced that the United States with its economic, military and technological<br />
capabilities would be crucial to our security in that he knew would be the vastly<br />
changed strategic circumstances in post World War 11 specific affairs.<br />
The ANZUS treaty was negotiated and concluded in 1951 by Percy Spender. Casey<br />
cemented the alliance, and took it forward as an active reality. He was convinced not<br />
only of its political and strategic worth to Australia, but also of its importance to the<br />
security of the region<br />
In developing our relations with the nations of Asia and reinforcing the alliance with the<br />
United States, Casey did not lose sight of the continuing value to Australia of traditional<br />
associations with the United Kingdom and the rest of Europe. His approach to<br />
Australia's foreign relations was a comprehensive and interconnected exercise. He saw<br />
the scope for Australia's relationships with individual countries to reinforce and benefit<br />
each other and to achieve Australia's regional and international goals.<br />
I respected Casey, as a person and a politician, for his role in helping lead Australia to<br />
make its way in and adapt to a changing world. Having so recently welcomed President<br />
Clinton to Australia and participated in the APEC leaders' meeting in Manila, I am even<br />
more struck by the foresight of Casey and his legacy.<br />
I am sure that Casey would have taken great pleasure in the President's visit. That visit<br />
was an emphatic and unambiguous demonstration of the continuing vitality of the<br />
partnership between Australia and the United States. The welcome which both President<br />
Clinton and his wife were given by the Australian people said as much as any words<br />
about the closeness and warmth of the ties between our two countries.<br />
But the message of that visit and the earlier steps my government took to reinvigorate<br />
the alliance at the time of the AUSMI N talks in July was not just about the importance<br />
of our bilateral relationship and the strength of its historical and cultural roots. The<br />
message both to the Australian and the American people and to the people of the region<br />
was also of the contemporary relevance of our partnership, including the ANZUS<br />
alliance, in pursuing the shared future of Australia and the United States in the Asia-<br />
Pacific region.<br />
Of course, it is only to be expected that we will have different perspectives from the<br />
United States from time to time. Each of us has our own specific national circumstances<br />
and interests. But Australia and the United States have both over-riding common<br />
interests at stake economic, political and strategic in working together and with other<br />
regional countries to ensure stability and continued economic growth in the Asia Pacific.<br />
Our relationship with the United States is naturally complementary with the closeness of<br />
our relationships with the other members of the Asia-Pacific community.<br />
Along with our links with the United States, those relationships with Japan, Indonesia,<br />
China, and Korea, to name just a few individually and collectively form the building<br />
blocks of Australia's engagement in the region. </p>
<p>During my visits in September to Indonesia and Japan, I reinforced the new<br />
Government's commitment to strengthening Australia's cooperation with these two of<br />
our most important partners.<br />
China's success in fulfilling its potential is important to Australia, as it is to the rest of the<br />
region. At my meeting with President Jiang Zemin in Manila, I told him that I was committed to<br />
developing further the fundamentally sound relationship between Australian and China a<br />
commitment that I'm happy to say was reciprocated by the President. I look forward to<br />
giving further practical demonstration of that commitment when I visit China in the first<br />
half of next year.<br />
A China fully involved in the economic and political affairs of the Asia-Pacific region<br />
would be a force for stability in our region, as well as a proper expression of the huge<br />
potential of the region's most populous nation.<br />
I met also for the first time President Kim Young Sam. I also assured him of the priority<br />
my Government gave to our relationship with Korea which Australia's second largest<br />
export market and a very important political partner. That relationship is expanding<br />
dramatically and gaining a wider base as our people-to-people links strengthen through<br />
education and tourism.<br />
We'll continue to work at strengthening all of our regional relationships. Each country in<br />
Asia has its own dynamics, its own characteristics, and its own importance and its own<br />
separate national characteristics.<br />
I am confident especially after my visits to Indonesia and Japan, the meetings in Manila<br />
with other regional leaders and my discussions with the United States President that<br />
Australia's contribution to the region is both recognised, wanted and valued.<br />
Our engagement with the region is as strong as it is not only because our interests require<br />
it, but because our regional partners also have an interest in our active participation.<br />
Under the Coalition Australia will be an energetic and unreserved contributor to the<br />
region, not only by strengthening our close partnerships with other nations in the region,<br />
but also through practical support for regional prosperity and stability.<br />
Australia has so much to offer in our people, our distinct national identity, our natural<br />
resources, our skills, our technological innovativeness and our political and social<br />
stability. The people from Asia who have settled in Australia have come here because of the sort<br />
of country we are. They are welcome because of the qualities with which they enrich our<br />
society, our economy and our culture. And they are an especially valued link with our<br />
neighbours in the region. </p>
<p>We do not need, as a nation, need to turn ourselves into something we are not in order to<br />
be confident of our place in the region. We do not have to pass tests set by others any<br />
more than we should be setting tests for others to pass.<br />
But we do have to measure ourselves against the region in some important respects if we<br />
are to achieve the prosperity we seek. We cannot, for example, expect to benefit simply<br />
because we live cheek by jowl with the major source of the world's economic growth.<br />
We have to be competitive enough to profit from it.<br />
The one thing we can say with certainty about the future is that the regional and global<br />
environment will continue to change rapidly. Looking back over his years as Foreign<br />
Minister, Casey himself remarked on ' the speed with which human affairs can change'.<br />
At the APEC leaders meeting I described globalisation as perhaps the most potent<br />
economic force in the world today. An economic revolution has been wrought by free<br />
movement of capital and the rapid pace and spread of technological change.<br />
We talk a lot about the impact of globalisation on sovereignty because of the pressures<br />
that a global economy puts on the policy-making of individual national governments.<br />
While outside influences impinge more and more on domestic issues, it is likewise true<br />
that practically no domestic policy act in any country is without some repercussion<br />
elsewhere. And our domestic policy positions have a direct bearing on the effectiveness<br />
with which we can pursue our interests abroad.<br />
We cannot today afford to put our domestic and foreign policies into separate and<br />
unconnected compartments. Australia's success in improving her competitiveness, its<br />
market share, its influence and standing in the region and wider world will depend in<br />
large part on the government's success in implementing its economic reform programme.<br />
Equally, foreign and trade policies are a significant element in determining how<br />
successful we shall be in meeting the government's domestic economic objectives.<br />
In Manila, I was very struck by the commitment of APEC leaders to maintaining the<br />
momentum of trade liberalisation and the need for that as a key ingredient for the future<br />
growth and stability of the region.<br />
My government will do all it can to keep up that momentum. We want to see the free<br />
and open trade goal of APEC turned into reality, and even better with a knock-on<br />
effect to freer trade globally.<br />
As I have said before, this is not because of any conceptual ambition or blind ideological<br />
commitment. It is because, for example, my government wants to see our agricultural<br />
exports treated more equitably so that our farm sector is not discriminated against.<br />
International trading rules at present allow practices that would not be allowed in respect<br />
of manufactures to operate to the detriment of primary producing exporting nations. </p>
<p>Most important, it is because my government sees the dividends the Australian people<br />
can gain in the form of faster economic growth, greater opportunities and more jobs for<br />
our younger people especially.<br />
We need to ensure that markets are open so that we can increase our exports and the<br />
employment within Australia that those increased exports generate. For example,<br />
exports of medical and scientific equipment have more than doubled from $ 300 million in<br />
1987 to $ 750 million today, creating many hundreds of highly skilled and well-paid jobs.<br />
Under our recently concluded trade agreement with Taiwan, exports of Australian-built<br />
cars will increase from zero at present to 6,000 by the time that Taiwan joins the World<br />
Trade Organisation. This has helped create many new jobs at Mitsubishi's Tonsley Park<br />
plant in South Australia.<br />
Moreover, jobs in export industries are characterised by higher productivity and,<br />
therefore, higher wages. For instance, among small firms the wage differential is as high<br />
as 17 per cent.<br />
In the case of Foreign Affairs and Trade, ladies and gentlemen, there is, as there should<br />
be, a fundamental continuity between my Government's objectives and those of my<br />
predecessors' especially in the priority we give to our region and APEC.<br />
There are, however, differences of emphasis, some of which I have already alluded to in<br />
this speech.<br />
You will be well aware of the Government's strongly held view that when it comes to<br />
foreign policy there is no requirement on Australia to choose between its history and its<br />
geography. While we have to decide priorities in terms of allocation of resources and effort, we do<br />
not have to regard our links with countries in Asia and elsewhere as a zero-sum. While<br />
multilateral institutions play an important part especially in dealing with issues such as<br />
proliferation and trade we see success in achieving our objectives in them as likely to be<br />
founded on strong and well-matured relationships with our allies and friends. While<br />
committed to global free trade in the overall national interest, we are looking for practical<br />
results at the bilateral, regional and multilateral levels that will yield early concrete<br />
benefits for our own business community.<br />
One of the election promises made by the Government was to commission the first ever<br />
white paper on Foreign Affairs and Trade policy. That process is underway and, on the<br />
current timetable, the paper will be issued in March of next year. I expect the white<br />
paper to take a hard-headed approach and suggest clear strategies for pursuing<br />
Australia's national interests and achieving the Government's agenda.<br />
Finally may I say something rather more specific about the Department of Foreign Affairs<br />
and Trade and those who work within that Department.<br />
Much of the responsibility for protecting and advancing our national interests rests with<br />
the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, with its officers here in the R G Casey<br />
Building and in Australia's many overseas missions. </p>
<p>Coalition governments have always had a strong sense of the benefits of a highly<br />
professional and apolitical public service. My Government will be no exception.<br />
Inevitably a change of government after thirteen years will prompt some uncertainties in<br />
the public service. Public service and governments naturally get used to each other over<br />
such a long period, if not in the policy sense then at least in human and operational terms.<br />
I want to take the opportunity to say that my government looks to all of the public<br />
service, including, of course, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, for fearless,<br />
objective advice. It also looks for creative and innovative advice in implementing its<br />
goals. As society's demands change and a new government takes office with a different agenda,<br />
the public sector does need to adapt. The Government is working on reforms that aim to<br />
increase the public service's capacity to serve the Government and Australian public<br />
effectively, and the scope of the service's members to achieve greater satisfaction from<br />
their work.<br />
Jibes are often made about public servants. But my own experience has been one of<br />
dedicated and well-qualified people with a strong sense of national responsibility,<br />
integrity and commitment to their work. I have great respect for the quality of the<br />
Australian public service. The international reputation of Australia's public service and<br />
its foreign service is deservedly very high.<br />
The history of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is very much part of Casey's<br />
history. His connections with the Department and the various stages of its evolution go<br />
back a long way.<br />
When he went to London in the twenties, he did so as an official of the then External<br />
Affairs Branch of the Prime Minister's Department. As a new member of Parliament in<br />
the early thirties, Casey advocated a diplomatic service for Australia separate from<br />
Britain's. As a member of that newly-established service, he was the first Australian<br />
representative in Washington. As Minister he supported the development of a<br />
professional and highly qualified department, which served him and Australia with great<br />
distinction. If he were here with us today, Casey might well be surprised I'm sure he would by the<br />
size of this building, and by the size of the department which it houses. The<br />
Department's expansion since Casey's time is partly owing to the amalgamation of the<br />
separate Departments of Foreign Affairs and Trade in 1987 a very sensible move in<br />
recognition of the linkages between those areas and their effective implementation. The<br />
planned co-location of AUSTRADE in this building is to welcomed for similar reasons.<br />
The expansion reflects also the reality that, despite the tyranny of distance, Australia has<br />
never been isolationist and inward looking. We have always understood that our survival<br />
and prosperity depended on the world around us. As Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser<br />
commented on Casey's appreciation of the effect on Australia of events in other parts of<br />
the world. And our history as a nation built by immigrants from all over the world has<br />
reinforced that good sense. </p>
<p>The Department has had to continue evolving and adapting since Casey's time. The<br />
implosion of the Soviet Union and the collapse of communism by far the most profound<br />
example of the triumph of values and ideas in my life time have precipitated a<br />
transformation of cold-war structures and strategic balances which is still being worked<br />
through. The explosive growth of the Asian economies has brought about a second great sea<br />
change in world affairs. World economic structures are only beginning to adjust to the<br />
changes in economic relativities. Our region must cope with the consequent strategic<br />
changes over the coming decades.<br />
Now more than ever Australia has to be an outward-looking nation, confident and proud<br />
of our own distinctive identity, our place in the region and in the world, and properly<br />
equipped to pursue our national interests at home and abroad.<br />
It is sometimes said that advances in information technology and communication and<br />
the ease and speed of transport are reducing the importance of the role of foreign affairs<br />
and trade officials. There is no doubt that technology and transport have changed<br />
enormously the way in which our foreign service operates.<br />
But my visits overseas this year, to the South Pacific Forum, to Indonesia and Japan, to<br />
Manila for the APEC meeting, have made me keenly aware of the crucial role of the<br />
Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in conveying in a way that is listened to and<br />
acted on the right messages about Australia and the Australian Government's objectives<br />
and policies.<br />
In his 1958 book ' Friends and Neighbours', Casey referred to the qualities required of<br />
diplomats then, the need to know and I quote: ' their own country, its interests and<br />
strengths and weaknesses', to be ' well-acquainted with matters of defence and of trade'<br />
as well as international politics, and to be practised in what Casey called the ' relatively<br />
new art' of conference diplomacy and to deal with the media.<br />
Today, Australia's international agenda is even broader and more intense than it was in<br />
Casey's time. But the basic qualities identified by him are still demanded of our<br />
diplomats today. My own experience of their professionalism and skills convinces me<br />
that Casey would agree that Australia continues to be very well served by them.<br />
In declaring this building, which I do so with very considerable pride, I want to thank Mr<br />
Flood and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade for inviting me to undertake that<br />
honour. I wish all the officers of the Department a happy and purposeftil working<br />
environment. I want to reiterate the enormous value that my Government places on your<br />
professionalism, the spread of your understanding of the friends of neighbours we have<br />
all around the world. And to emphasise again as I finish that sound, competent,<br />
professional, high quality advice in the area of Foreign Affairs and Trade remains as<br />
essential as it has ever been for Australia and in a new and constantly changing world,<br />
perhaps even greater than it has ever been.<br />
Thank you very much. </p>
