TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH ALAN SUNDERLAND, SBS TV, SYDNEY, 26 APRIL 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
AS: Prime Minister, many people are saying it's a great coup for Australia to<br />
have this Global Cultural Diversity Conference here in Sydney why is<br />
that?<br />
PM: Perhaps it's some recognition of the success we have had with cultural<br />
diversity ourselves, in what we call multicultural ism. That is, the mores<br />
and tenets of our multicultural ism of our own democracy here as it has<br />
developed. I think that the fact that the conference is here important as<br />
the conference is in its own right the fact that it is here, pays us a<br />
compliment.<br />
AS: There is a sense in which global diversity, and managing cultural<br />
diversity, is particularly important in the world at the moment do you<br />
think Australia has something to say about how to achieve that?<br />
PM: I think we have, and as I said in my remarks, I don't think there is any<br />
single template here. You can't take the Australian experience and put it<br />
somewhere else, but the interesting thing is, though, after the Cold War<br />
when what is called the " bi-polar tension" the two camp tension which<br />
held everything else tight where community differences, ethnic<br />
differences, racial differences, religious differences were suppressed.<br />
Now that tension has gone, they are coming out. And, so rather than the<br />
United Nations, for instance or the rest of us being involved managing<br />
trouble spots which are the manifestation of the tension what this<br />
conference is about is dealing with the tension at its source. That is, what<br />
is causing these things. And if you see quite large problems look at<br />
Rwanda in the last week as a very express cause of these tensions yet<br />
the underlying tensions are well understood culturally well understood<br />
in that country. So, I think what we are about here is saying " well, in this </p>
<p>country of Australia, we have handled various... what would otherwise be<br />
various racial and religious tensions well". And probably one of the<br />
reasons we have, is that we have a very great sense of democracy a<br />
deep sense of democracy that our sense of democracy gives every<br />
person space ethnic space, religious space, political space and that<br />
tolerance lets it all work.<br />
AS: Well, that sense of democracy was very much on show today of course<br />
we had almost as many people outside the Conference protesting about<br />
Macedonia, Bosnia and other issues, as we did have inside listening to<br />
the speeches does that suggest that in some areas there is still some<br />
tension to be resolved?<br />
PM: There will always be tensions, but you made the point yourself it's the<br />
sort that is par for the course they are out the front having their say.<br />
And that itself is an expression of the very democratic values that make<br />
Australia work. And you notice that the Secretary-General in his speech<br />
talked about inculcation of the values of democracy. Not the models not<br />
the models where you have a parliamentary system or a presidential<br />
system not the models, but the values.<br />
AS: Okay if we talk about the tensions, there is one group I wanted to talk<br />
about briefly. It seems there are still, albeit a small group, but there are<br />
some Australians who would feel excluded by the multicultural process<br />
who would feel, rightly or wrongly, that they are not part of it, and they feel<br />
rejected by it and that shows itself in some of the more radical right-wing<br />
groups that demonstrate we have seen problems overseas, most<br />
recently with the bombing in Oklahoma. Do you think that Australia can<br />
afford to ignore this group of disaffected people who we can see we saw<br />
in Adelaide over the weekend, National Action people -who have a<br />
problem with the whole nature of our society?<br />
PM: I don't think we can ignore them, and I think we wish that these people are<br />
affected by the ambient attitudes of Australia the ambient societal<br />
attitudes. That is what the remedy... that is what the antidote is to these<br />
sorts of things it's not the Government's security forces crawling over<br />
them, or in them, but rather that they know that their message, essentially,<br />
is not to be generally accepted. But if the cause of the disaffection is<br />
some neglect by the rest us, is some insensitivity by the rest of us, well,<br />
that is something we should correct.<br />
AS: Sure.<br />
PM: But often these things are racist, intolerant in the case of Oklahoma,<br />
criminal so no multicultural policy is going to deal with that. </p>
<p>AS: Lets finish with a couple of brief, practical questions. You talked about<br />
the need to include the Aboriginal community in this society through the<br />
Social Justice package being an important part of reconciliation how is<br />
the Government going to deliver on a Social Justice package of that<br />
sense of proportion, at the same time as you have committed over the<br />
next few years, to cutting back your own budget, and your own<br />
discretionary spending, as much as you possibly can?<br />
PM: I don't think this is about money this is about rights. It's not about<br />
money.<br />
AS: But at the end of the day it must come with a price?<br />
PM: The bit that comes with a heavy price is land, and that is already factored<br />
in. That's Mabo and the Land Fund, and what we will now be spending<br />
on health but a large part of that has been factored in and community<br />
services, but the rest of the Social Justice things are about rights. They<br />
are not necessarily carrying a price ticket on them. So, I don't think<br />
money is the problem in all this it's just a matter of getting it right, and<br />
trying to move both the debate and the modalities of social justice for<br />
indigenous people moving it forward so that there is no more<br />
disappointment of one move forward and then slippage. But to move it<br />
forward with certitude.<br />
AS: Sure.<br />
PM: That's the challenge it's not really money.<br />
AS: Okay. Final question the republic has been a big part of the Keating<br />
Government's issue of identity for Australia coming together. When you<br />
went to Germany, the indications were then that we expected to see the<br />
Government's response on a republic in a few weeks still not there, how<br />
soon are we going to see that fairly important plank?<br />
PM: You will be seeing it, and not so far away, but it is the key thing is<br />
though is that it is central to the fabric of Australia to its society. You<br />
can't get around as an independent nation when the Head of State<br />
belongs somewhere else, and that should be pretty self-evident to<br />
anybody. And the second thing is, it is central economically that I mean,<br />
there is a sense about Australia now where people feel good about the<br />
country, they feel up-beat about the country, they feel confidence, they<br />
feel as though there is something special happening here they are<br />
moving forward with a sense of identity. What the republic does is make<br />
that identity clear it puts the seal on that identity. Because you can't get </p>
<p>4<br />
around the world borrowing the Head of State of another country. I think<br />
that is the important thing my opponents say " this is a distraction". Well,<br />
the ones who say that don't understand what it really means, and if they<br />
don't understand, then they are not entitled to run the rest of us.<br />
AS: Prime Minister, thanks for your time.<br />
PM: Thank you.<br />
ends. </p>
