PRIME MINISTER<br />
CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
ROCKHAMPTON ABORIGINAL CULTURAL CENTRE<br />
ROCKHAMPTON 9 APRIL 1988<br />
Your invitation to me to open the Rockhampton ~ boriginal<br />
Cultural Centre was welcome because it gives me an<br />
opportunity to deliver two important messages.<br />
First, I want to congratulate you on the tremendous spirit<br />
of co-operation and endeavour with which you have created<br />
this new Centre.<br />
Second, I want to talk about a spirit of co-operation and<br />
endeavour at the national level namely,; the new process of<br />
consultation currently taking place between the Federal<br />
Government and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander<br />
people of this nation.<br />
Today is truly a proud day for Rockhampton because we are<br />
celebrating the opening of a new centre in whose creation<br />
many parts of the Rockhampton community have played a role.<br />
The Rockhampton City Council, the local College of TAFE,<br />
service clubs and individual citizens can all take a share<br />
of the credit.<br />
The Federal and Queensland Governments each contributed more<br />
than $ 450,000 to the cost of the Centre, as part of the<br />
Commonwealth-State Bicentennial Commemorative Program.<br />
But all these efforts depended on the original idea and the<br />
determined commitment of the local Aboriginal community<br />
and in particular the members of the Central Queensland<br />
Aboriginal Corporation for Cultural Activities.<br />
What all these efforts have combined to produce is a<br />
building of very great significance:<br />
it will be an important tourist attraction for local,<br />
interstate and international visitors;<br />
it will help ensure that Aboriginal people retain their<br />
culture as a living thing for the inspiration and<br />
education of us all; and 005650 </p>
<p>2.<br />
through the cooperative spirit with which the Centre was<br />
built, it will serve as a lesson on how to get things<br />
done, together a lesson from which all Australians in<br />
our multicultural nation could learn.<br />
As I said, the Federal Government has contributed money to<br />
this Centre under a joint Commonwealth-State Bicentenary<br />
program. The Rockhampton Aboriginal Cultural Centre thus belongs to<br />
the significant group of projects being funded for<br />
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people as part of the<br />
Bicentennial celebrations.<br />
We ought to be under no illusion that for the Aboriginal<br />
people, 1788 signalled the end of an era.<br />
It brought to an end the more than 40,000 year long era of<br />
continuous unchallenged occupation of this land by<br />
Aboriginal people 40,000 years during which there<br />
flourished here a rich civilisation, which many of the first<br />
European settlers and many of their successors were<br />
simply not equipped to appreciate adequately or even to<br />
understand. So it is significant that at Rockhampton today we are in a<br />
small way correcting those failures. We are celebrating the<br />
public commencement of a building which will be. a lasting<br />
display case for that civilisation, in which its<br />
achievements and its richness can be fully recognised and<br />
more widely understood.<br />
So it is very appropriate that this Centre has received<br />
Bicentennial funding, and I am very pleased as<br />
Prime Minister, on behalf of all Australians, to be able to<br />
participate in this opening.<br />
But the Bicentennial holds a wider meaning for those of us<br />
I hope all of us who are concerned about a proper<br />
recognition of the role of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait<br />
Islander people in Australia today.<br />
Because I have made it clear right from the start of this<br />
Bicentennial year, and before, that Australians could not<br />
properly celebrate the Bicentenary without coming to a<br />
better understanding of, and understanding with, the<br />
Aboriginal people.<br />
By that I mean that the two hundred years of European<br />
settlement of Australia have been characterised by all too<br />
frequent failure, on the part of the Governments and the<br />
non-Aboriginal community, to meet the legitimate needs of<br />
the Aboriginal people.<br />
In our Bicentenary year, we should not only reflect on the<br />
richness of a 40,000 year old culture. 005651 </p>
<p>We should also, more fundamentally, respond to the real<br />
needs of the Aboriginal people:<br />
to participate more equitably in the affairs of our<br />
community, and<br />
to benefit more effectively from the fruits of our<br />
prosperity.<br />
The groundwork for such a response was laid two decades ago<br />
when the Australian people voted overwhelmingly in a<br />
referendum to give the Commonwealth the power to make laws<br />
regarding the Aboriginal and Islander people.<br />
The essential feature of such a Government response must be<br />
that its elements are agreed to, through consultation, by<br />
the Aboriginal and Islander people themselves.<br />
Accordingly the Federal Government is undertaki&amp; I~ a number<br />
of initiatives aimed at increasing Aboriginal<br />
self-management and economic independence.<br />
As the Aboriginal Affairs Minister, Gerry Hand, said in a<br />
Statement to Parliament last December outlining these new<br />
initiatives, Aboriginal people need to decide for themselves<br />
what should be done not just take whatever governments<br />
think or say is best for them.<br />
So underlying our proposed new measures is the most<br />
extensive series of consultations with Aboriginal people<br />
undertaken by any Government.<br />
Gerry Hand recently concluded the first round of these<br />
consultations.<br />
Between January 23 and March 10, he attended 46 meetings<br />
involving an estimated 6,000 people representing some 1,200<br />
organisations. Preceding these meetings were 450 community<br />
meetings held in 415 locations which enabled Aboriginal and<br />
Islander groups to work through the proposals Mr Hand would<br />
put to them.<br />
Many of you here will have been present at the Rockhampton<br />
meeting on February 27.<br />
Foremost among the subjects discussed in these consultations<br />
was the proposed Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander<br />
Commission, which I believe offers a new and exciting era in<br />
Aboriginal Affairs in this country.<br />
For the first time, under this new Commission, Aboriginal<br />
people will be involved in setting the priorities and making<br />
the decisions that affect them.<br />
This will largely be achieved through a national network of<br />
Regional Councils, whose representatives will be Aboriginal<br />
and Islander people elected by their own communities. 0 0 56( 52 </p>
<p>4.<br />
These Councils will then elect their own Commissioners<br />
withV-specified zones. The Board of Commissioners will be<br />
entirely made up of Aboriginal and Islander people and the<br />
majority will be elected by the people, not appointed by the<br />
government as is currently the situation.<br />
The result and it is an encouraging result from Mr<br />
Hand's consultations with Aboriginal and Islander people is<br />
that the overwhelming majority endorsed the new Comnmission<br />
" in principle" even though they suggested ways in which the<br />
proposal could be improved.<br />
As a result of this first round of consultations an Options<br />
Paper is now being circulated in a series of follow up<br />
meetings which will continue over the next few weeks.<br />
The second principal subject of consultation was the<br />
proposal to reach a compact or treaty between Aboriginal and<br />
non-Aboriginal Australians.<br />
Mr Hand found in his consultation that Aboriginal people<br />
were discussing the idea of a compact or treaty on,, an<br />
informal level.<br />
He stressed that the first step towards establishing such an<br />
agreement is for Aboriginal people to convey to the<br />
Government their view on how the process of discussing the<br />
concept should be set in place.<br />
We hope to get that process of formal discussion underway<br />
this year but the Minister has also stressed and I agree<br />
with him that we will not rush anybody into this.<br />
I have always believed that the Bicentenary provides an<br />
appropriate context in which serious work towards an<br />
agreement should be begun.<br />
But the matter is too important to be jeopardised by<br />
unnecessary haste.<br />
While work on this restructuring takes place, the Government<br />
is also making progress on issues of immediate relevance to<br />
Aboriginal living standards.<br />
Aboriginal unemployment persists at unacceptably high levels<br />
five or six times higher than among non-Aboriginals.<br />
Aboriginal incomes remain on average only half those enjoyed<br />
by other Australians.<br />
Accordingly the Federal Government has established the<br />
Aboriginal Employment Development Policy. With a<br />
substantial financial commitment by the Commonwealth, we<br />
seek to achieve employment equity for Aboriginal and Torres<br />
Strait Islanders.<br />
in the area of health, Aboriginal people are again severely<br />
disadvantaged by comparison to the wider-community. infant<br />
mortality rates, while declining, are still about three<br />
times higher, and life expectancy rates are some 20 years<br />
lower, than for non-Aboriginals. 005653 </p>
<p>We have established a-joint Federal-State working party to<br />
prepare a strategy to tackle these and similar health<br />
problems. In neither the employment nor the health field will it be<br />
possible to find easy or rapid solutions.<br />
But both of them demand action. Indeed, since ultimately<br />
the root cause of both of them can be traced back to that<br />
day in 1788 when European settlement of Australia began, it<br />
is essential that we take steps this year to begin resolving<br />
them.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
The legislation with which the Federal Government, subject<br />
to approval by Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders,<br />
proposes to establish the new Commission, wifl contain a<br />
very important introduction.<br />
This introduction, or preamble, is written in formal<br />
Parliamentary style so I won't read it out here. But its<br />
basic points, as currently proposed, are easy to summarise<br />
the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people<br />
were the prior occupiers and oqriginal owners of<br />
this land and they were dispossessed, without<br />
compensation, of that ownership;<br />
Aborigines consequently are the most disadvantaged<br />
group in Australia; and<br />
Australians want policies and programs which will<br />
overcome the economic and social disadvantage of<br />
the Aboriginal people, which will entitle them to<br />
enjoy their culture and their traditional laws<br />
where practicable, and which will enable them with<br />
pride and dignity to achieve full recognition and<br />
status within the Australian nation.<br />
This is not a mere assembly of words. It is important<br />
language describing important goals.<br />
Achieving those goals will require continued co-operation<br />
and understanding by all Australians the same kind of<br />
co-operation and understanding which allowed this Cultural<br />
Centre to be built.<br />
It is my hope that a wider application of that spirit will<br />
help create the conditions for a fuller realisation of the<br />
proper relationship between the Aboriginal and<br />
non-Aboriginal people of Australia.<br />
It is with that hope that I now declare this Cultural Centre<br />
open. I 005654 </p>
