PRIME MINISTOR Press Statement No. 517<br />
19 June 1975<br />
VIETNAM4ESE REFUGEES<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam, announced today that<br />
a total of 201 Vietnamese refugees will arrive in Sydney<br />
from Hong Kong tomorrow. Mr Whitlam said this would be the<br />
largest single group of Vietnamese refugees to leave Hong Kong<br />
for any country to'date. The Prime Minister said that.<br />
almost all those coming to Australia were unlikely to have<br />
been offered resettlement in other countries and for this<br />
reason their cases had received special consideration.<br />
Mr Whitlam said that 126 of the refugees, were<br />
adults, 65 were children and 10 were infants under two years<br />
of age. There were 35 family groups and 6 single persons.<br />
One-third of the family units were incomplete and almost<br />
all were without close relatives here or in any other<br />
refugee-receiving country to help them. Most were semi-skilled<br />
or unskilled workers. Others were students without vocational<br />
training.. The medical condition of most of the refugees was<br />
quite good. They had been given the usual migrant medical<br />
examinations and x-rays. After their arrival in Sydney, all<br />
the refugees will go directly to East Hills Migrant Hostel,<br />
where special arrangements had been made to receive them.<br />
Mr Whitlam said that selection and approval for<br />
entry of this group of refugees had been made because of<br />
Australia's commitment to take her fair share of refugees<br />
from Vietnam. Mr Whitlam said the Government continued to be<br />
in contact with the office of the United Nations High Commissioner<br />
for Refugees and would keep the position of refugees under<br />
review. CANBERRA. A. C. T. </p>
