SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
CITIZ: ENSHIP PROMOTION LAUNCH<br />
SYDNEY TOWN HALL, 4 NOVEMBER 1994<br />
It Is a great pleasure to be here, on this very happy occasion.<br />
My flr~ t duty is to congratulate all those who are becoming Australian citizens<br />
today. I have no doubt it Is a great moment for all of you. And I can also say it is a<br />
great moment for all of us who are sharing it with you.<br />
Words like pride come to mind. It is a proud moment. But there is much more<br />
than that at work here today. The feelings go much deeper than pride.<br />
Today we are seeing people from an extraordinary variety of cultures and<br />
countries, and an extraordinary variety of professions embrace Australia. And<br />
we are seeing Australia return the embrace.<br />
It is a ceremony with the elements of a marriage about it and a homecoming,<br />
and a family reunion, and a graduation ceremony.<br />
Whatever it is, the feeling Is a very warm one.<br />
Perhaps " sharing" is the operative word.<br />
People who decide to take out Australian citizenship decide to share in the<br />
responsibilities of being Australian.<br />
And in return Australia offers a share of the rewards.<br />
And a share of the pleasure too, I hope.<br />
We sincerely trust the pleasure will be lasting that whenever you say " I am<br />
Australian" you will feel proud to say It. That it will mean to you something<br />
special. </p>
<p>It does not mean that you are accorded some elevated status in the world,<br />
rather that you now acknowl edge as your home a country which is free and<br />
democratic, tolerant and just.<br />
It doe~ s not mean that you have renounced the inheritance of custom and<br />
tradition you brought with you to Australia, rather that you have adopted as your<br />
homeD a country which respects the diverse cultural Inheritance of all its<br />
citizens. You have lost something, but, we might say, you've gained a whole country.<br />
Nothing is asked for in return except your loyalty, that you keep faith with the<br />
pledge you are taking.<br />
There Is a real sense in which it can be said that when you take that pledge all<br />
Australians take it.<br />
The rights and responsibilities which you have taken on are borne by all<br />
Australians and no Australian and no Australian government can ever take<br />
them f~ or granted.<br />
It is not enough to merely say we subscribe to these values we should live by<br />
them, we should teach them, we should pass them on, we should enshrine<br />
them in our institutions and laws, we should be prepared to defend them.<br />
We have an extraordinary opportunity in Australia.<br />
We have the chance in the last decade of the century to pull the threads of our<br />
nationhood together: not into a monocultural, monolithic society, or into the<br />
shape of the classical nation-states of the past century and a half.<br />
The catchword is not uniformity, but difference. It is not conformity, but<br />
creativilty. It is not exclusive, but inclusive. Not closed to the world, but open to<br />
it. It is tru' 3 we need the things a nation needs.<br />
We need a sense of common purpose, we need the ties of fellow feeling to<br />
unite us, we need belief and loyalty.<br />
But these days we must surely recognise that we are increasingly united by the<br />
pride and the pleasure we take In multicultural Australia: our respect and<br />
enthusiasm for cultural diversity has become a defining element of Australia's<br />
nationat sentiment. </p>
<p>That is what we find so moving about this ceremony. That is what unites us<br />
today. I am sure the warmth is the warmth we feel when we welcome someone to our<br />
family. The pride is in seeing Australia in idea and reality mediate such<br />
vast cultural difference. So that men and women from Egypt, or Bangladesh,<br />
or England, or Russia, Indonesia or Peru can, without losing any of their<br />
individual identity, Identify themselves in common as Australians.<br />
If this does not inspire warmth and pride, what does?<br />
I have a feeling it is a variety of what one writer, Mary Kalantzis, recently cailed<br />
" la postnationalist sense of common purpose"<br />
This is not to cast off older Australian traditions or Institutions which serve us<br />
well. It Is not to devalue the culture that has grown here.<br />
In fac: I am quite certain we will see those traditions strengthened in coming<br />
years modified in places, inevitably, but strengthened in their essentials.<br />
BecaUse it is those essentials the essentially democratic, tolerant and<br />
pragmatic nature of them which has made the transformation to a<br />
multicultural Australia possible.<br />
Contemporary Australia is built upon them.<br />
Now we have the chance to make our multicultural society, and the tolerance<br />
and openness on which It has been built, a recognised and recognisable<br />
element of Australian nationhood.<br />
If we can do this It will fit us very well for the modem world in which the barriers<br />
between nations are dissolving and culture, communications and services<br />
number among the most valuable commodities a country can have.<br />
It will serve us marvellously in this regard and it will guarantee an Australia<br />
which is not only culturally rich but socially cohesive and harmonious.<br />
Just as Importantly, it will mean an Australia which counts among its primary<br />
values the capacity to find practical ways to mediate differences not just<br />
ethnic or cultural differences, but the differences between men and women.<br />
between urban and rural Australians, between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal<br />
Australians. </p>
<p>BecaLuse we want to invigorate our national life and national consciousness this<br />
year we established a Civics Expert Group, Invested with the task of finding out<br />
how much Australians know about their country and its traditions and<br />
Instititions. We have also asked them to tell us what is the best way to fill in<br />
the gaps in their knowledge.<br />
For the same reason we have taken on a major promotion of citizenship. We<br />
want to see a very large percentage of the million residents who are eligible for<br />
citizenship take the step that the people here today are taking.<br />
It will mean no less to their heritage and Individuality, but a great gain to the<br />
country In which they make their livelihoods and homes.<br />
The country which demands they leave nothing of their heritage behind unless<br />
it Includes hatred and violence.<br />
That 1: 3 another step we have taken: we will introducea Racial Vilification Bill to<br />
protect Australians against those few who would incite racial hatred.<br />
The Bill is not for the purposes of punishing common prejudice. It is to protect<br />
Innoce'nt men, women and children against fear and intimidation. All<br />
Australians are entitled to freedom from fear.<br />
The legislation embodies a warning to those who might attack the principal of<br />
tolerance on which our society Is built, and an assurance to those who might be<br />
their victims.<br />
It is something of a safety net for multicultural Australia. The expression in law<br />
of those things which today we pledge our belief in.<br />
Laws like pledges are necessary expressions of belief.<br />
But ultimately what matters most is the energy and imagination of people.<br />
In the Australia of my imagination people will continue to believe In their<br />
citizenship deeply, yet wear it lightly.<br />
I hope that is the message we all take from here: let us not be too pious about<br />
it, and let's keep the flag-waving and drum-beating to a respectable minimum.<br />
Let's simply rejoice in the fact that being Australian is a very good and fortunate<br />
thing to be.<br />
Thank you. </p>
