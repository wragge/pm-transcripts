FOR PRESS: PI. No. 94/ 1971<br />
VISIT TO UNITED STATES AND BRITAIN<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, ' Tr. William . IcMahon<br />
The following statement is being issued<br />
simultaneously in Washington and Canberra.-<br />
' In pursuance of the continuous consultations<br />
that occur between the two Governments, the Prime<br />
Minister of Australia will visit Washington at the<br />
invitation of President ilon and have discussions<br />
with him on 2 November on matters of mutual concern."<br />
The Prime Minister of Britain, 3Ir. Edward<br />
Heath, invited me upon my appointment as Prime Minister, to<br />
visit Britain for discussions.<br />
I informed Heath that although I could not<br />
accept the invitation immediately, I would do so as soon as it<br />
became practicable. We have now agreed that I should visit the<br />
United Kingdom as part of my forthcoming journey.<br />
In the circumstances that exist, it is<br />
appropriate that I should visit both London and Washington.<br />
