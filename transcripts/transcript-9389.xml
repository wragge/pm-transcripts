TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
ADDRESS TO MTIA ANNUAL DINNER, PARLIAMENT HOUSE,<br />
CANBERRA, TUESDAY, 24 OCTOBER 1994<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
Let me thank the Association very much for this invitation and Graham for<br />
those words of introduction. I have always liked coming to MVTIA dinners. I<br />
have been doing it now, on and off, since the early 1970s which is probably<br />
too long, but there it is. But the fact is, I have always believed in the<br />
Australian manufacturing industry. I have always believed in the capacity of<br />
Australian managers to take up challenges and do well. And, as you know, in<br />
my own family we were in the heavy engineering business and I've had, from<br />
boyhood, a fairly unique opportunity to understand how innovative Australian<br />
companies can be and how hard they try. So, as a consequence, I am very<br />
gratified by the success which the industry has had in recent years by its<br />
leadership and by its confidence and I am delighted to see the title of the<br />
program " A Dynamic Year for Australia'' and the sense of confidence which<br />
Graham mentioned in his introductory remarks.<br />
One of the nicest compliments I have been paid in recent times was paid to<br />
me by Bert Evans. Bert is a nice person and he does pay compliments, but<br />
not that often to me. But he said look I'm a member of the 180 degree club.<br />
And I said what's that Bert. He said well I'm one of the people that<br />
believed in tariff protection, I'm now one of the people who believe that the<br />
policies introduced over the last decade have given us a future we could<br />
never have had in the past. He didn't go on to say he is a true believe, but<br />
he's a believer. And I thought this was a tremendous admission not just of<br />
honesty and frankness, but of somebody who is prepared to see an<br />
opportunity and grasp it and speak for an industry which has seen an<br />
opportunity and grasped it. Because it is true and I think Bert would<br />
acknowledge that if we were having this discussion, or a meeting such as this<br />
years ago or even 10 years ago, the tariff drum would be well and truly<br />
beaten. And doubters would be admonished. But the fact is, now, with tariffs<br />
coming down, we've seen in the period since, manufacturing production<br />
double, we've seen manufactured exports triple. And as a consequence, one </p>
<p>of the things which is giving us a greater capacity to trade into the world and<br />
to reduce our debt and to service it is our capacity to produce goods and<br />
services. And that, of course, we are seeing very strongly with manufacturing<br />
industry. Graham gave you the figures. In the middle 1980s we were<br />
exporting 14 per cent of our GDP, that's today 22 per cent of our GDP. But<br />
we only need to go through a change such as that, continue that change and<br />
it won't be that long before we are well and truly above the ratio of<br />
comparable countries. That is, somewhere between 22 and 30 per cent of<br />
GDP. So we are well and truly on the way I think and we are seeing such<br />
great sophistication come into manufacturing as the competitive breezes<br />
have come into the economy, as the place has loosened up. As the<br />
competitiveness has changed, as the wage profit share changes, as the focus<br />
on productivity improved, as the exchange rate garnered competitiveness for<br />
us, all of these things have seen tremendous change. And one gets a<br />
tremendous, I think, boost of encouragement going to things like the launch of<br />
the Collins Class Submarine: the quietest, most effective conventional<br />
submarine in the world, made in this country. And when you look at the<br />
sophistication of the weapon systems, one can't pretend that such a thing can<br />
be whistled up out of nowhere, or that we claim it to be first class but it really<br />
isn't. In fact, it is. And that, along with the capacity to produce frigates, and<br />
other categories of naval vessels, sophisticated aeronautical products and<br />
everything then from super computing to remote sensing and all of the other<br />
technological things which we have managed to do, all proves, I think, that<br />
given the challenge, Australian manufacturing can get in there and measure<br />
up to it and also seeing what is coming. I mean, it is delightful for me to hear<br />
references to APEC at a dinner such as this. Or to see the MTIA set up in<br />
Indonesia, which it has, and to participate in the Australia Indonesia Today<br />
exhibition which is on this year, the largest trade exhibition we've ever had.<br />
To see the MTIA there and actually going hard at it does give one<br />
tremendous confidence that we are actually going to do something pretty<br />
clever in this country.<br />
Now I took on board Graham's remarks about microeconomic reform and I<br />
think microeconomic reform has to continue. A lot of it's behind us, but there<br />
is still a lot of it ahead of us, in all sectors. But we shouldn't forget, I think,<br />
that so much has been done in the labour market, even if more is to be done.<br />
In telecommunications, in air transport. Just take air transport as an example.<br />
Fares have declined by 30 per cent, passengers have risen by 80 per cent in<br />
2 1/ 2 years. Or in telecommunications if one looks at the tariffs now in<br />
telecommunications and the services it is a revolution we are seeing there.<br />
We've seen it in the ports and wharves, the trouble is that the yeilds are not<br />
going to the people who needs them, that is the shippers, they are staying in<br />
the hands of stevedoring companies and state government bodies. But the<br />
primary change is behind it and the Commonwealth Government this<br />
government has paid for much of the redundancies and the trade union<br />
movement has made most of the adjustments. We're now turning containers<br />
around here, in this country, equivalent to ports like Rotterdam. We've got<br />
lower than OECD crew manning levels on our ships and going lower, but we<br />
are not yet seeing this in lower freight rates and we need to. </p>
<p>But we need other changes too, and that is in places like power and water<br />
and gas. And I notice the Leader of the Opposition saying to you today. He<br />
said that ' four or five years ago, he thought of microeconomic reform' that's<br />
me ' and would have told you that it was on the top of the Government's<br />
agenda. Today he has almost completely forgotten about it.' Well I didn't<br />
forget about it at the COAG meeting and I didn't forget about it trying to push<br />
Hilmer past a whole lot of conservative Premiers and finding an uphill battle<br />
all the way. And I have always thought it a great irony that a Labor Prime<br />
Minister should be in there saying to a set of Liberal and National Party<br />
Premiers to believe in competition and try and get them committed to it in<br />
places like electricity, water and gas. I don't mind late converts providing<br />
they come on board. But it is in these areas where the micro reform has to<br />
continue. Graham also mentioned the labour market. And I think one needs to reflect<br />
there upon the success we have had to date. And that is we've now got a<br />
labour market which is much more supple and flexible than it has ever been.<br />
We've moved off centralised wage fixing. We are now moving strongly down<br />
the road of enterprise bargaining, particularly with certified agreements with<br />
companies and trade unions. And we are opening up this field, the non-union<br />
field, with enterprise flexibility agreements. Now I know that the recent<br />
decision of the Commission rankles the MTIA and they are, I think, appealing<br />
the decision about absorption into over award payments of payments in the<br />
safety net. But importantly, I think the MTIA's position isn't that there<br />
shouldn't be a safety net, they believe there should, but they don't want it<br />
caught up in other agreements which are not certified. Well these are things I<br />
think that a view is capable of being put upon. But we are told that of these<br />
enterprise flexibility agreements, that is in areas where unions are not<br />
involved but covered by federal award conditions, that they can be varied and<br />
suspended and that, though some unions have opposed their suspension, of<br />
the 12 so far proposed, only one has been rejected and there are another<br />
or so in the pipeline likely to be approved. So I don't think that the MTIA<br />
should shy away from enterprise flexibility agreements, even if some smaller<br />
companies are at pains not to have unions involved. And the reason, I think,<br />
why we have this condition that unions have a right to be heard, is because it<br />
is the suspension of the award which is material to their interest in other<br />
sectors or other companies within the same sector and hence, is of interest to<br />
them.<br />
At any rate these are things, which I think, in which time is going to tell. I<br />
think the enterprise flexibility agreements are going to be an important field of<br />
change for business and for the MTIA membership, as is indeed the larger<br />
companies who actually make green fields agreements with trade unions<br />
under the certified agreement area. At any rate, it's all light years from where<br />
it was even half a dozen years ago. And, of course, eons from where it was<br />
in the late 1 970s and the early 1 980s where we had 16 and 17 per cent<br />
wages growth with no productivity cover. Just banging its way right in, </p>
<p>hammering its way into the inflation rate and hammering its way into interest<br />
rates, low growth and with it, of course, low employment.<br />
Now I want to saying something tonight about monetary policy, interest rates,<br />
and the budget because today was an important day with the adjustment of<br />
interest rates up by 1 percentage point. I think the thing to say is that we<br />
should draw confidence from today's decision. That is, confidence in two<br />
things, that we are growing strongly but we are going to manage the growth<br />
and that the interest rate rise is basically about smoothing the growth and<br />
prolonging the period of growth. That is, prolonging the period of this<br />
recovery right through the 1990s. Not letting it get to an explosive cocktail<br />
where more drastic remedial surgery would otherwise need to be undertaken.<br />
Now, I notice the Leader of the Opposition today has attacked us for this<br />
saying that the Government has gone, he told you, on an extravagant<br />
spending spree and as a consequence, they are ending up now with rising<br />
interest rates. Well this is the same Opposition that told you when the<br />
government introduced the One Nation package that we would destroy the<br />
economy and that the 4 per cent growth forecast were fairyland stuff. Well it<br />
is no accident that Australia has pulled the right policy levers in recent years.<br />
It is no accident we have been right at the top of the OECD league table of<br />
growth and inflation and employment. It is no accident that in that survey by<br />
the Economist magazine each month, we are at the top of it and we have<br />
been at the top of it now for the last 15 months or so. And that is because we<br />
are growing in excess of 4 per cent or thereabouts and we are starting to see<br />
a lot of attendant employment growth come through as well.<br />
You need to have a bit of memory in this game, even a short term one helps.<br />
But at the last budget when we said that our forecast for investment growth<br />
was 14 1/ 2 per cent, that was ridiculed too. But now it is coming through,<br />
everyone is saying well it's too strong what are you going to do about it?<br />
Well the answer is we are trying to clear the decks so that investment can<br />
continue, at the same time smooth it and make clear that the interest rate<br />
adjustments which we have are ones which will, as I say, maintain the<br />
recovery and make it even longer than it might otherwise be.<br />
So the simple message is that we have worked so hard so far to bring about a<br />
durable recovery, we are not going to throw it away now. At its core, this<br />
decision to lift rates shows that the Government is determined to manage the<br />
growth and manage it well. As I said earlier, we should draw confidence from<br />
it. Now let me say this about the markets, because, I was just saying to Graham,<br />
I think it is very important when commentators for industries such as the MVTIA<br />
go onto radio or television, they should make the distinction between<br />
business, the employing bodies of this country, and the financial markets.<br />
Because a lot of people in the community think markets is business. In fact<br />
markets are the financial markets, the people who shuffle the paper all day.<br />
And the markets, I suppose, are entitled to be dubious about inflation in this </p>
<p>country after many years of an indifferent inflationary performance. But as we<br />
consolidate low inflation, markets should recognise the change and factor it<br />
into the equation. Ours today is a low inflation economy, but you would never<br />
know it from the bond rates. If you look at the bond rates, they appear to be<br />
factoring in an inflation rate 5 or 6 per cent. That is, with bond rates over<br />
per cent and real interest rate of 4, gets you back to an inflation rate of 5 or 6.<br />
Now I don't think there would be a person in this room in business that<br />
believes there are wage or price pressures out there that would give support<br />
to that 5 or 6 per cent assessment yet it is there. It is there in many other<br />
countries too, but it's here and it shouldn't be. So it's 5 or 6 per cent, when<br />
the underlying rate of inflation is 2. And this week we will have another<br />
consumer price index out and we will have a further indication of whether<br />
inflation is getting away. I don't think it is. But to be considering 5 or 6 in the<br />
face of 2 is a very long bow on the part of the markets indeed.<br />
We have become a low inflation economy and we should draw credits for that<br />
and it should be reflected in lower premiums. So, at some point, if we<br />
continue to churn out low inflation numbers the markets are going to have to<br />
cut their cloth accordingly. That is, the bond yields will have to come down if<br />
their implicit inflation forecast is not realised.<br />
Some commentators are saying that we should tighten both fiscal and<br />
monetary policy as the economy strengthens, that we should not rely<br />
excessively on monetary policy. Well, let me say, I couldn't agree more, but<br />
let's get clear what this means. It doesn't mean that we need to change the<br />
budget every time we hear a piece of good economic news and it doesn't<br />
mean interest rates have risen because fiscal policy is not tight enough. As<br />
the Governor of the Reserve Bank said last week, interest rates are there<br />
now to smooth the recovery. As I said earlier, to prolong it. They are not<br />
there because of pressures on the supply of money. The higher rates are<br />
there basically to have their effect upon activity.<br />
So, as I say, it doesn't mean interest rates have risen because fiscal policy is<br />
not tight enough. What it does mean is that the fiscal stimulus we provided to<br />
get the recovery going should be progressively withdrawn as economic<br />
activity strengthens. And, that is precisely what our medium term fiscal<br />
strategy does and the deficit target of 1 per cent of GDP by 1996/ 97 is at the<br />
core of it. So, monetary policy will play its role, but fiscal policy has that<br />
medium term strategy.<br />
If economic circumstances change fundamentally, sound economic<br />
management dictates fiscal policy may need to be modified, but the important<br />
thing is that is not the case now. The economic outlook has not changed<br />
significantly from our May forecast when we framed the ' Working Nation'<br />
initiatives and reaffirmed our program of fiscal consolidation. We therefore<br />
do not intend to bring down a mini budget or to adjust the current fiscal<br />
strategy as the Opposition and some financial commentators have been<br />
demanding. </p>
<p>We will review policy in the context of next year's budget, but at this stage<br />
there does not appear to be a case for a large change. Now, let me just<br />
briefly explain why. We are already tightening fiscal policy, not that we are<br />
getting much credit for it. Some people conveniently forget the 1993/ 94<br />
Budget. They conveniently forget all the hijinx in the Senate. They<br />
conveniently forget all the attempts to try and stop the tax changes and tax<br />
bills going through. They forget the fact that in that Budget we announced we<br />
would be pulling a massive $ 9 billion out of the economy by 1996/ 97 $ 9,000<br />
million out by 1996/ 97. That is, we were prepared on a discretionary basis to<br />
cut $ 9 billion from the economy to pull the budget deficit back by almost 2 per<br />
cent of GDP. That is in world terms an absolutely enormous cut. And, it is<br />
not $ 9 billion that will be coming from higher growth. This is not $ 9 billion<br />
coming in from the proceeds of activity. That is, more people in employment,<br />
higher company profits, more tax receipts, $ 9 billion coming from there. This<br />
is a discretionary $ 9 billion $ 9 billion which has been decided on by the<br />
Government. But, when you tell that to the deficit daleks and the others what response do<br />
you get? ' Oh well, we know about that, we have stuck that in our pocket, now<br />
what about the next $ 9 billion?" Well, of course, they never tell you how to do<br />
it, they just tell you you need to change it and, of course, most of these<br />
people are tired retainers on the old broadsheets they have been there for<br />
years singing the same tune that is, no deficit could be too little, no surplus<br />
too large regardless of the economic circumstances. These are the same<br />
people who said our growth and deficit reduction forecasts were<br />
unachievable. You see, there is a great injustice in public comment in this<br />
country, probably in most countries, but it is particularly true in this that they<br />
are never accountable. So, if you drag these people like Max Walsh and<br />
Paddy McGuiness and Terry McRann and all these other characters back<br />
and say ' but what did you say at the time?'. They said that growth was<br />
unachievable and the deficit reduction forecasts were unachievable. That is<br />
all wrong. They have all been proved wrong, but they have now moved on<br />
hoping that the community forgets what they said in the first place. Well, the<br />
community probably does, but I don't. I tend to keep an eye on them. It is<br />
pretty easy to keep an eye on them, they have been in the same place for<br />
years. Well, what are we to do? Remember this, the public sector of Australia is the<br />
third lowest in the OECD. This Labor Government has turned a relatively<br />
large public sector into a small one. Are we to slash the social welfare<br />
system that is carefully targeted? That is recognised internationally as<br />
equitable and effective and holds our nation together. Are we to increase the<br />
rate of company tax when we have, at last, a rate that is comparable to our<br />
Asian neighbours? Just remember this, that the tariff cuts, the cost to<br />
revenue from the tariff cuts and the company tax changes of 1993, cost the<br />
budget $ 12 billion and the tariff cuts and the company tax changes cost us<br />
about $ 5 billion every year. So, what do we do? Put them back up? Rebuild<br />
the tariff wall? Jack up the company tax rates or increase the personal<br />
income tax rates? Is there anyone out there looking for something higher </p>
<p>than 47 per cent? Because that is one of the options that people speak of.<br />
Or, are we to scrap the tax concessions for superannuation that encourages<br />
Australians to provide for their own future or hop back into the long term<br />
unemployed by knocking the White Paper changes out to leave a permanent<br />
underclass buried away out there while the rest of us move on to prosperity.<br />
Or, introduce a GST which was knocked over so comprehensively by the<br />
public at the last election.<br />
So, that is what these things are about. They are not jokes. Hopping into<br />
spending in education or in TAFE or into universities or cutting back the<br />
growth rate or cutting back, absolutely, payments to the aged or any of the<br />
other targeted areas of family assistance, these are the sorts of things that<br />
the Government, if accepting this advice, would have to do or stick up the tax<br />
rates which I've just mentioned to you. So, the fact of the matter is that we<br />
are maintaining fiscal consolidation at a pace appropriate to our economic<br />
circumstances. Let me repeat that, appropriate to our economic<br />
circumstances. The forecast deficit for 1994/ 95 is 2.5 per cent of GDP at a<br />
time when unemployment is about 9.5 per cent. So, if you want a<br />
comparison, the last time unemployment was 9.5 per cent, it was in 1984 and<br />
the deficit was 4.1 per cent of GDP. Now, with the same unemployment rate,<br />
it is 2.5 per cent. So, it demonstrates that, I mean if unemployment and the<br />
need for the economy to grow and create jobs is an indicator here, it means<br />
that the deficit is already substantially consolidated when compared with that<br />
period. And, from 1993/ 94 to 1996/ 97 we will have cut the deficit by 2.5 per<br />
centage points. That is pulling 1 per cent of GDP a year from it nearly<br />
$ 5,000 million a year stimulus taking it out as we go along.<br />
So, it is for that reason that we have received an appropriate<br />
acknowledgment from the OECD which says that the Australian fiscal<br />
consolidation is amongst the fastest in the world and our deficit reduction<br />
target is only tougher, certainly tougher than all G7 member countries except<br />
for Japan. So, I think, these things should be kept in some sensible<br />
perspective. Let me say a couple of things about superannuation. When I became<br />
Treasurer in 1983 we had $ 40 billion in super funds. As a result of the<br />
Government's policies under the Accord with the ACTU and the<br />
Government's superannuation guarantee charge we will see super funds<br />
rising from $ 180 billion where they are today to around $ 350 billion by the<br />
year 2000 $ 40 billion in 1983, $ 180 billion now, $ 350 billion by the year<br />
2000. By the Year 2013 the guarantee will be adding two percentage points<br />
of GDP to our national savings each year. It is difficult, I think, to overstate<br />
the significance of this. It is a breathtaking reform and it is hardly surprising<br />
that it has been acknowledged internationally as leading the world. We have<br />
got, in fact, the World Bank imploring other countries to adopt a retirement<br />
incomes policy similar to Australia and, again, the Economist Magazine said<br />
recently that Europe would do well to consider our system as a way of dealing<br />
with the budgetary impact of increasing pension costs for their aging<br />
population. </p>
<p>So, this is an enormous reform, one that the Government is very proud of and<br />
one that complements fiscal policy and the adding to and the addition to<br />
domestic savings in this country. The one, I might say, that our opponents do<br />
not support because they want to go back to a superannuation system which<br />
doesn't have a guarantee charge, where there is a contribution by each<br />
employee in the country accessing their superannuation tax provisions, but<br />
rather it being basically for those in the public sector and those in well off<br />
private sector employment, but for the great mass of people they could only<br />
get there by way of certain tax incentives and not under a specific charge.<br />
Now, all of these things, I think, are important when one tries to look at the<br />
totality of policy. So, perhaps let me conclude on these points and to say<br />
this, that, I think, Australia has come an enormously long way in the last<br />
dozen years or so. As Graham remarked earlier '. We are now exporting 22<br />
per cent of our GDP instead of 14 per cent. The debt service ratio on our<br />
debt that is the proportion of our exports that we commit to servicing our<br />
national debt has fallen from 22 per cent to 11 per cent. So, our capacity to<br />
service our on going debt has improved dramatically. That has come about<br />
by greater exports and lower interest rates.<br />
All this means, I think, is that we. continue to grow the Australian economy,<br />
but again we want to see private sector investment move in there and we will<br />
gradually withdraw the government stimulus as the private sector investment<br />
comes in. But, we are not going to pull the rug out of the pace where the<br />
whole thing collapses and, I think, this is one of the key points. While<br />
monetary policy and interest rates will apply a proper supporting role in<br />
smoothing the growth and extending the recovery period,<br />
The Metal Trades Industry Association and its affiliates can play an even<br />
greater role than they role they have played to date in growing out our<br />
manufacturing base and going into exports, but there is just one point that I<br />
might take issue with Graham about and that is, it is not simply microeconomic<br />
reform that is slowing the growth. If you like, that is an inhibition to<br />
a faster rate of growth in exports. One of these studies, done by McKinsey<br />
and company recently, showed when they looked at the 700 exporters of<br />
those with the fastest growing rate of exports in the categories of production<br />
they found that they were not very different to thousands of other companies<br />
the products weren't different, the structures of the companies were not<br />
different, the balance sheets were not different it was just that one group<br />
was enlightened and saw the opportunity and another group didn't. It<br />
underlines what has always been a problem in Australia and that is a real<br />
problem with entrepreneurship. That is, we are getting to the stage now were<br />
in the period of an open economy and deregulation the good managers are<br />
now climbing to the top, but we have been through three or four waves of<br />
people on the way through.<br />
Obviously, in the great body of companies there is a lot more potential there<br />
that hasn't come out which has got nought to do with ports and wharves or </p>
<p>telephones or anything else. It is just the fact is that they are happy to sit<br />
here in Australia and work off the domestic economy, not understanding there<br />
is a greater economy abroad. Now, we have got to tell them about that and, I<br />
think, the Metal Trades Industry Association and its focus on Asia is one of<br />
the key bodies in doing that and as a consequence more companies will be in<br />
the business. If then we can help them with a more supple economy, better<br />
micro-economic reform and the rest well then, we really are, I think, in there<br />
for the long run.<br />
So, don't mistake this point. There are very few, as Ralph Willis said last<br />
week eloquently in the House of Representatives, there are very few<br />
industrial countries that are anywhere near us at the moment in fiscal policy,<br />
in growth, in employment, in cultural change so we shouldn't underestimate<br />
our success, but it has been put there by a decade of hard work and change<br />
and it is only by doing it together and, I think, this is one thing the MTIA does<br />
well. It does talk to the trade unions, it talks to the government, it<br />
understands there is a place for it in this society and it tries to work things<br />
out. It is this sort of approach, I think, that pays results. In a consensus<br />
economy you will always do better than one which is basically adversarial.<br />
As I said, I always enjoy speaking to the MTIA. It is a body of substance, of<br />
people who actually do things. To get out there and make things, go and flog<br />
their wares around the world and there is always the objective test if you are<br />
a manufacturer it either works or it doesn't. This tends to concentrate the<br />
managerial mind on some of the other more esoteric areas of the public<br />
debate and that is why, I think, speaking to an industry organisation certainly<br />
beats the hell out of speaking to financial markets every day of the week.<br />
Thank you again for inviting Annita and me along tonight and as I say, I have<br />
been coming a long time now and I want to keep coming back. Arthur Calwell<br />
said to me when I first came to Canberra he said ' you know the thing to do<br />
after each election Paul, when the caucus meets be in it, because it is pretty<br />
hard to be in the game if you are not there.' Well, I could just put a little<br />
variation on the theme and say after each election at the Metal Trades<br />
Industry Annual Dinner, I hope I am invited to speak, of course, as a Minister,<br />
as Prime Minister and to see my party the great vehicle of Australian social<br />
and economic reform chart the way to the end of the century. Thank you.<br />
ends </p>
