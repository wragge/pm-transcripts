PRIME MINISTER<br />
EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
COO1MITTEE FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF AUSTRALIA<br />
SYDNEY 26 AUGUST 1986<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen<br />
It is aw-ys a pleasure to address CEDA. My own<br />
association, and that of my Government, with your<br />
organisation has been very important and productive. in<br />
fact this is the fourth time that I have had pleasure of<br />
speakinq t o CEDA since becoming Prime minister. I believe<br />
that is the best indication of the importance which I attach<br />
to this Forum.<br />
On the ". st occasion I was with you it was to commemorate<br />
CEDA's Silver Jubilee. My Address then recognised CEDA's<br />
abiding uommitment to longer-term structural &amp; nd developmentissues.<br />
That commitment, of course, is one which I share.<br />
On that occasion I noted, in Darticular, that our terms of<br />
trade w2: 3 declining faster than usual and that because of a<br />
r. Rex zd structural changes in the world economy it would<br />
be some time before any significant reversal was likely.<br />
Of course that was before the outbreak of the agricultural<br />
trade war between the US and the EEC. It also preceded the<br />
collapse of the oil market in February, a collapse which has<br />
dragged other commodity prices down as well. All of the<br />
policy prescriptions which I put forward on that occasion<br />
have very much greater relevance now.<br />
Those prescriptions came in two interrelated parts. The<br />
first, na~ turally, was sensible macro-economic policies I<br />
will coma back to this issue shortly.<br />
The second part covered a group of longer-term policies to<br />
promote structural change : policies to raise the skill<br />
levels and flexibility of the work force; policies which<br />
recognioe the need to foster innovation and managerial<br />
flair; policies to encourage a more outward looking, more<br />
innovative industrial base, including the winding back of<br />
protection; policies to lift the regulatory burden on<br />
busincGee and to let Australia get on with the job. </p>
<p>once again these prescriptions were hardly novel. I and my<br />
ministers have been propounding them consistently now for<br />
more than three years.<br />
We have beecn propounding them for one simple reason. And it<br />
is this.<br />
For decades Australian industry generally had been allowed<br />
to become tired and complacent. Governments had acquiesced<br />
in the general lassitude. Indeed at certain times in the<br />
electoral cycle they had even encouraged it.<br />
Australia had been lulled into a false sense of security by<br />
a feeling of~ invincibility. We thought ourselves the lucky<br />
country. we thought of ourselves as the natural place for<br />
foreigners to turn when they wanted to buy seemingly scarce<br />
primary coginiodities.<br />
And it must be said that there was a failure of political<br />
leadership failure to look beyond the next election and to<br />
plan for the longer-term. There was a profound failure of<br />
far-sighted vision.<br />
It has fallen to my Government and I welcome the challenge<br />
with zest to redeem the failure of decades. We have<br />
consistently7 put forward our vision for a better Pustralia:<br />
an Australiza which needed to undergo fundamental economic<br />
and social change if it was to realise the aspirations which<br />
we all legitimately hold.<br />
It was that vision which lay behind my calling of the<br />
National Economic Summit and the establishment of<br />
consultativo bodies such * as the various industry councils<br />
and EPAC. Xt is that vision which underpins our approach to<br />
industry po'. cy and industry regulation. It is that vision<br />
which provides the intellectual basis for the urgency with<br />
which tye have set out to foster national reconciliation and<br />
national Teconstruction.<br />
In my Address to the Nation around ten weeks ago, I pointed<br />
out the major difficulties facing Australia at the present<br />
time because of the unexpectedly sharp change in world<br />
trading conditions.<br />
The point is not that there was any sudden realisation that<br />
changes were required in Australia's way of doing things.<br />
As I say, wu have known that for years.<br />
The real point to note is that these new external<br />
developments have placed new demands on policy. These<br />
include, first, new demands on short-term economic<br />
management. They also include, a new urgency for industry<br />
policy because the time period available to us to effect<br />
long-term structural changes has contracted. </p>
<p>I 3.<br />
The task of coping with the new environment is daunting<br />
enough : just consider how much more difficult it would be<br />
if we had not begun some three years ago to give effect to<br />
longer-term policies to promote the necessary structural<br />
changes. Throughout our trading history Australia has been an<br />
exporter commodities, mostly some mixture of agricultural<br />
products and minerals. For much of this period there has<br />
also been a trend decline in the prices of our exports<br />
relative to imported manufactured goods.<br />
In the post-war period this decline has been of the ord ' er-of<br />
1 per cent per annum, a trend that all post-war Governments<br />
were content to live with. But since the end of 1984 there<br />
has been &amp; an abrupt and very sharp decline in the world<br />
prices of our exports, resulting in a fall of 15 per cent in<br />
ouz terms of trade.<br />
To put that in perspective, the terms of trade have now<br />
fallen to a post-war low in year average terms. The further<br />
8 per cent decline forecast for 1986-87 will mean, if<br />
realised, that Australia's terms of trade will have fallen<br />
to a level not seen since the 1930' s.<br />
The sad truth is that the cost to Australia of our lowered<br />
terms of trade is currently about $ 6 billion per annum.<br />
This develo'pment, needless to say, has been most unwelcome.<br />
But it is here and adjustment is inevitable.<br />
The Governm-ent cannot cr-eate the conditions which will<br />
enable us to avoid the need to adjust. What this Government<br />
can do cnd has done is to create the conditions which<br />
will ena'io Australia to maximize its future growth<br />
prospects. Last week's Budget is an indispensible element in that<br />
process. In a senso, the deterioration in the terms of trade has<br />
effectively focussed attention on another longer-term<br />
structural issue. Over the last decade or more Australia as<br />
a whole hcie increased the average share of GDP devoted, one<br />
way or another, to consumption. This has been at the<br />
expense of saving for investing in our future.<br />
overall domestic saving has fallen from an average of 17.5<br />
per cent of GDP per year in the ten years ended 1973-74 to<br />
just 11.4 per cent last year. Last year private savings<br />
amounted to 18.3 per cent of GDP, comparable with the<br />
average experience over the relevant 10 years. The<br />
difference between private and total saving in 1985-86 at<br />
6.9 per cent of GDP was devoted to financing, either<br />
directly or indirectly, the deficits of Governments and<br />
their authorities. </p>
<p>The investmrent share fell a little between these periods<br />
by about 2 percentage points. The remaining gap between<br />
domestic saving and our total financing requirement was met<br />
by increzising our dependence on overseas savings.<br />
In 1985-86 Australia spent about 6 per cent more than it<br />
earned. The difference was borrowed overseas. This came at<br />
a time wl'en the foreign currency value of our foreign debt<br />
had already been doubled over two years, partly reflecting<br />
the sharp depreciation of early 1985.<br />
The prescnt size of the current account deficit around 6<br />
per cent of GDP and bloated by the adverse shift in the<br />
terms of trade is simply not sustainable. Put bluntly, we<br />
must takc' our hands out of foreigners' pockets and learn 0to<br />
better live within our means.<br />
In effect, we are going to need to reduce our consumption<br />
level belowi where it otherwise would be and increase our<br />
national raite of saving.<br />
1:<br />
And as an cassential part of that adjustment, we are going to<br />
have to inc~ rease the capacity of our traded goods industries<br />
and to divarsify them.<br />
As I say, ' Cliat general prescription will not como as a<br />
surprise to any of you. It has been a consistent theme of<br />
my Goveriimzunt over these past three years. It is neither<br />
more nor c than the message of my Address to the N'ation.<br />
At that tir-, I indicated unequivocally that my Government<br />
would addre3s the' new circumstances directly through prices<br />
and incornee policy, accompanied by complementary fiscal<br />
restraint.<br />
My Govern'Aent's actions subsequently have demonstrated our<br />
capacity to respond to the new policy imperatives. Last<br />
week's Bud,-ot produced a degree of fiscal restraint that<br />
went beyoiid the reasonable expectations of market<br />
commentators. Last week's Budget and its associated policies provides<br />
Australia wi. th a substantial instalment in a medium term<br />
strategy lor negotiating this transitional period while<br />
Australia adjusts to the new economic realities. As a<br />
consequence, last week's Budget offers a real prospect for<br />
enhancing our long-term growth potential.<br />
Central to the Budget is a very substantial degree of<br />
restraint on outlays.<br />
At 6.9 per cent, the growth is nominal outlays is lower than<br />
the outcome in any year since 1968-69. The Budget provides<br />
for no growth in real terms in 1986-87, compared to an<br />
average rise over the past decade of 3.2 per cent. </p>
<p>Bringing outlays growth to a standstill in real terms has<br />
not been an easy task. It has required us to take a number<br />
of measures which otherwise we would not have wanted to<br />
take. However, the Government has had no real alternative.<br />
we have souight to apportion cuts fairly, with the least<br />
burden borne by those least capable of supporting it.<br />
Gross savings totalling well over $ 3 billion have been<br />
achieved since January 1985, with cuts in all functional<br />
areas. Defence Gpending growth has been cut to 1 per cent in<br />
1986-87, a significant reduction on the 3.75 per cent<br />
allowed Eor in the Five Year Defence Program. However, ' I<br />
note that average real growth in defence spending under my<br />
Governmenit remains greater than under our predecessors.<br />
Inevitably, significant cuts have been required in the<br />
hb-alth, oucation and social security areas. Our first<br />
priority, of course, has been to exclude from benefits those<br />
not in genuine need. We have achieved this by tightening<br />
eligibility criteria and administration.<br />
For example, the administration of unemployment benefits is<br />
to be modified in a number of ways. Additional staff will<br />
be undertaking selective reviews of recipients on a regional<br />
basis to identify and disqualify those wrongfully in receipt<br />
of benefit. These arrangements will also enable a better<br />
service to be provided to the older and longer-term<br />
unemployed. I<br />
In additilon recipients -of unemployment benefit will now be<br />
required to remain regi'stered with the CES and to lodge<br />
income statements personally. Similarly recipients of<br />
supporting parents benefits will be required to report on<br />
their circumstances at least quarterly and to attend for<br />
interview' after 3 months on benefit. Those and similar<br />
measures will save $ 77m in 1986-87.<br />
They also give the lie to glib assertions by the opposition<br />
that substantial further savings can be found by legitimate<br />
administ-. ative means.<br />
Having taken all of those measures it was still necessary to<br />
effect further savings in this area.<br />
It was for this reason that the pension adjustments which<br />
usually occur in November and may of each year have been<br />
each postponed for a period of 6 weeks. It is the<br />
Government's intention ultimately to restore the previous<br />
arrangements, but not until it is economically responsible<br />
to do so. </p>
<p>I would add that, even though significant cuts have been<br />
made the Government continues to accord the highest priority<br />
to the needy. This priority is reflected in the fact that<br />
the share of outlays devoted to social security and welfare<br />
payments is budgeted to rise by 0.4 percentage points to<br />
27.8 per cent in this year. The shares of other elements of<br />
the social wage remain broadly unchanged.<br />
Tax reform iemains central to this Government's agenda.<br />
Personal tax cuts will be delivered on 1 December, with a<br />
final tranche on 1 July 1987. Our commitment to this second<br />
tranche is to be reflected in legislation, to be introduced<br />
for passage this Session.<br />
Even after allowing for the greater contribution to health<br />
care fund:. ng which our circumstances now require from the<br />
Medicare levy, ordinary wage earners will receive a tax cut<br />
from 1 December of about $ 6 per week. The value of the tax<br />
cuts by 1987-88 will be 3 times the additional revenue<br />
raised in the tax package.<br />
Some administrative arrangments which affect the timing of<br />
tax payments by some of our largest companies have been<br />
changed to ensure more equitable treatment as between<br />
companies. But there are no new direct imposts on business<br />
in this Bodget.<br />
This Gover itent has accepted an unprecedented degree of<br />
fiscal planning discipline, represented by the fiscal<br />
trilogy. Cutlays have declined as a proportion oZ GDP in<br />
each of ti 1985-86 and the 1986-87 Budgets.<br />
It remains oar objective. to reduce tax receipts to 25 per<br />
cent of GDP, the " trilogy, limit". However, it is our view<br />
that, as wc need to increase derestic saving in present<br />
conditiont,, it would be inappropriate to move in that<br />
direction in 1986-87. On the contrary, additional tax<br />
revenue ha,; been sought.<br />
The decision regarding the tax share of GDP in the 1987-88<br />
Budget wi2l be taken in the light of circumstances at that<br />
time.<br />
Fiscal restraint is only one element of the necessary<br />
adjustment process. A second key element is to restrain<br />
increases in domestic costs in order to presezve<br />
substantially the enormous improvement in our<br />
competitiveness resulting from the depreciation of the<br />
exchange rate since early 1985.<br />
That depreciation has meant that Australian industries are<br />
now more competitive on a cost basis than at any time for<br />
about 20 yeais. But at the same time the sharp decline in<br />
the exchange rate around 40 per cent in TWI terms has<br />
imparted a very substantial inflationary stimulus. The<br />
acceleration of inflation in 1985-86 was due to the<br />
depreciation, not to increased wages costs. Wages growth in<br />
Australia was not much different from our trading partners. </p>
<p>Indeed it is worth remembering the wages policy achievements<br />
of the Accord. Our supposedly inflexible centralised wages<br />
fixing systom has in fact delivered a degree of real wage<br />
flexibility which few countries can match. Over the past 3<br />
years real wages have fallen 5 per cent in Australia. But<br />
in the US the fall was only 1. per cent and in the UK there<br />
was a real -ise of 10 per cent.<br />
Clearly wages have not been the cause of the increase in<br />
inflation. But that upsurge in inflation must not be built<br />
into our cost structure. That would simply compound our<br />
problems not help to solve the problem but to build the<br />
problenm in.<br />
In addition, the growth in household incomes will also have<br />
to share the-burden of the loss in national income due to<br />
the deterioration in the terms of trade.<br />
Accordingly at the next National Wage Case, the Governmient<br />
will argue Zor a 2 per cent discount. The Government will<br />
also seek a further adjustment of the wage increase in the<br />
case comme~ ncing around April next year, if economic<br />
conditions applying at the time warrant it.<br />
This Govern. Aent's main focus will continue to be on<br />
Australiaos ongoing competitive position and our terms of<br />
trade performance.<br />
on current figuring a 2 per cent discount will mean that<br />
wages are oxpected to grow at around the saTe modorate rates<br />
as in 1905.-86. Then, award yages grew by 4 per cent and<br />
average ea~ nings by around 6 A per cent. Sugh an outcome.<br />
would enTeAustralia to brsadly maintain our<br />
competitiveniess.<br />
Adjustment based on fiscal restraint and cost restraint<br />
offers the best prospect for resuming sustained and Gizeable<br />
rates of growth. It will allow monetary policy to carry a<br />
lesser burdan than it has over the past year.<br />
Interest raites have risen recently to underpin our currency.<br />
The fiscal restraint embodied in this Budget will mean that<br />
the net bond selling task is zero. The gross public sector<br />
borrowinij requirement is set to fall from around 6 per cent<br />
of GDP in 1985-86 to 4.4 per cent in 1986-87. That will<br />
reduce the direct claim on financial markets and thus free a<br />
higher proportion of domestic savings to finance investment<br />
without tcc-ourse to foreign borrowing.<br />
It should help to ease pressure off interest rates and<br />
improve the capacity of business to invest in the capital<br />
equipment necessary to diversify and enhance our traded<br />
goods industries.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, the macro-economic setting is but part<br />
of the adjustment that this economy must make. </p>
<p>8.<br />
The depreciation provides a major incentive for firms to<br />
take advantage of the freer, more open industrial structure<br />
which cur policies havo been creating over these past three<br />
years. The Government has laid the groundwork in many ways.<br />
Let me give just some examples:<br />
Deregulation of the financial sector;<br />
Positive incentives to increase research and<br />
development; Introduction of tax imputation to remove the double<br />
taxation of dividends;<br />
The e3tablishment of AUSTRADE;<br />
o Expansion of AIDC;<br />
The romoval of State purchasing preferences;<br />
Rela: ation of foreign investment guidelines; and<br />
Nov2s towards the adoption of uniform regulations across<br />
States.<br />
More neo: o to be done in changing Australian attitudes and<br />
improvi:_ efficiency. My recent Address to the Nation<br />
outlined ,; ome measures to achieve both these objectives.<br />
Work is proceeding on these within Government.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, such is the nature of our present<br />
crisis that it will take the efforts of the community as. a<br />
whole to put the economy squarely on track for sustained<br />
economic growth.<br />
This Goverrment is prepared to provide the necessary<br />
leadegsh-a and to implement the policies which are necessary<br />
( even at the cost of some short-term popularity).<br />
The Budc. et, to quote the Australian Financial Review, is<br />
economically responsible and politically honest.<br />
It is the Budget which we need, in conjunction with our<br />
other policies, to give us the best chance to rebuild<br />
Australia0s prosperity. The effort must engage us all.<br />
Mr Chairnan<br />
At the outset today, I referred to the previous occasions I<br />
have had the honour to address your members.<br />
With your indulgence, may I quote briefly from my Address to<br />
your Melbourne colleagues a week before the election of<br />
March 1983. </p>
<p>9.<br />
I said then:<br />
" This i not a challenge for the Government alone. It<br />
is a challenge for the entire Australian community.<br />
SWe will provide the leadership and take the initiatives<br />
which it is the responsibility of the elected national<br />
Government and the Government alone to provide and take.<br />
We seek, from the whole Australian community their<br />
co-operation, their sense of the common challenge and<br />
their common interests in meeting and bearing the crisis<br />
a crisis of the Australian economy and a crisis of the<br />
Austra. ian spirit which we all face together as<br />
Austra2lans."<br />
May I sufgot, Mr Chairman, that there is a double relevance<br />
in those wa:: ds today.<br />
We facc0 onze again, a time of tremendous challence.<br />
But even more relevant is the way we did, as a Government<br />
and as a poople, meet and beat the crisis of 1983. The<br />
Australian community all sectors of it did respond, in<br />
the manner we had sought.<br />
A new chal-onge lies before us all. Given the same response<br />
and spirit0 I am absolutely confident of our capacity as a<br />
nation to niet it triumphantly. </p>
