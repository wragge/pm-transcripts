PRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 28, 1980<br />
DOORSTOP, PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA<br />
Question: Prime Minister:<br />
I think the basis of the bipartisan approach is there if Mr Hayden<br />
is prepared to do what he has already indicated that. is over<br />
Afghanistan. He has said very plainly that a boycott of the Olympic<br />
Games is the most effective means of getting the message through<br />
to the Russian government and people. He has also said that he is<br />
prepared to join a boycott if it is going to be an effective one.<br />
All he has to do'is to join with the Government, and to work<br />
to make it effective.<br />
Nobody can'guarantee that it will be we believe it will be, but<br />
it won't be if everyone just sits back and does nothing. On the<br />
other issues, of course, he and at least Mr Young have said that<br />
it is nonsense to talk about any trade sanctions, because they<br />
wouldn't be effective, and that is what they have said, so they<br />
ought to stop talking about all the nonsense about wool. </p>
