PRIME MINISTER 3 May 1974<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER THE HON. E. G. WHITLAM, MP.<br />
DARTMOUTH DAM<br />
The River Murray Commission in the immediate future<br />
will have to make a decision about letting the main contract for<br />
the Dartmouth Dam, which will be the means of adding very<br />
substantially to the water available to South Australia in the<br />
years to come. The Australian Government had last year suggested that<br />
there could be some , merit in slowing down the rate of construction<br />
of-this project. Over the last few months, however, an appraisal<br />
of the overall impact of the project has shown that it would not<br />
be appropriate to slow down or defer the work. The appraisal will<br />
be published as soon as printed. The Australian Government will<br />
therefore facilitate an early decision by the River Murray<br />
Commission. The Australian Government still feels the grave concern<br />
over the management of the River Murray which I expressed at my<br />
meeting with the Premiers of South Australia, New South Wales and<br />
Victoria early last year. Indeed my concern has increased, since<br />
I do not believe it can be said that the progress made since that<br />
meeting has been such as to provide much cause for satisfaction.<br />
I would hope that as work goes on at top speed to build the great<br />
storage in the upper catchment of the Murray, there will be a similar<br />
sense of urgency associated with studies that will pave the way for<br />
the most effective use and management of this river and its associated<br />
land resources. I hope also that there will be a serious and<br />
concerted effort to reach agreement on the means whereby the<br />
River Murray Commission, in accordance with modern concepts of water<br />
management, can have a really effective role in the development<br />
and management of the River Murray.<br />
