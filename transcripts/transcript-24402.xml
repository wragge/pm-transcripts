    <content><![CDATA[<p>We have agreed to deepen the security aspects of our bilateral relationship, including our counter-terrorism cooperation and our shared efforts to deal with the threat posed by foreign terrorist fighters.</p>
<p>We recognise the challenges we both face on national security, as demonstrated by the terrorist attacks in Sydney in December 2014 and in Paris in January 2015.</p>
<p>We acknowledge that ISIL, or Daesh, poses a significant threat to global security and to both our countries.</p>
<p>We reaffirm our commitment to working with our international coalition partners to disrupt, degrade and ultimately destroy it.</p>
<p>Our renewed efforts will focus on counter-terrorism and national security policy.</p>
<p>Building on the Security Cooperation elements of our Strategic Partnership of 2012, we have decided to:</p>
<ul><li>enhance our high-level dialogue on global security and terrorism;</li>
<li>deepen our exchanges on national security policy, including responses to terrorism, countering violent extremism and on-line radicalisation;</li>
<li>extend our dialogue on the challenges posed by the phenomenon of foreign fighters;</li>
<li>further strengthen intelligence cooperation; and</li>
<li>establish a program of exchanges in counter-terrorism policing, including on tactical response policing.</li>
</ul><p>28 April 2015</p>
