  I warmly welcome President Clinton's appointment of Ambassador</p>
<p> Marc Ginsberg and Mrs Janet Ginsberg as his personal representatives</p>
<p> for Australia-America Friendship Week. Ambassador Ginsberg has a distinguished</p>
<p> background in diplomatic, trade, investment and security affairs and</p>
<p> has been a close adviser to President Clinton for many years.</p>
<p>  Ambassador Ginsberg and Mrs Ginsberg are participating in various</p>
<p> Friendship Week activities and attending a number of Battle of the</p>
<p> Coral Sea commemorative events from 1 to 10 May. The commemorations</p>
<p> provide the opportunity to reaffirm that the ANZUS alliance remains</p>
<p> as relevant as ever for both countries.</p>
<p>  The Battle of the Coral Sea was fought in May 1942 and proved to be</p>
<p> a turning point of the war in the South Pacific. It laid the foundation</p>
<p> for the Australian-American alliance.</p>
<p>  The continuing presence of the United States has been a vital element</p>
<p> in ensuring the security of the region through the enormous changes</p>
<p> that have taken place since the War. Fifty-six years on our partnership</p>
<p> continues to serve regional and global stability and prosperity and</p>
<p> is testimony to the strong bonds of friendship between the United</p>
<p> States and Australia.</p>
<p>  Above all, we remember with gratitude the sacrifices of the Americans</p>
<p> and Australians who fought in the Battle of the Coral Sea and the</p>
<p> many battles which followed.</p>
<p>  8 May 1998</p>
