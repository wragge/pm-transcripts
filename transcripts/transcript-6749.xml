CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
AUSTRALIAN DESIGN AWARD,<br />
MELBOURNE, 30 SEPTEMBER 1985<br />
Members of the Design Council<br />
Distinguished Guests,<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen,<br />
I am honoured to be here today to present the Australian<br />
Design Award to Consolidated Electronics for their<br />
" CEICART" Autophase 2000 Stereo Replay Machine a<br />
precision machine which automatically rectifys phase<br />
differences in stereo reproduction and allows for<br />
complete clarity in broadcast sound.<br />
In so doing, I want to congratulate the Australian<br />
Design Council, not only for its activities in promoting<br />
the importance of design in the commmercialisation of<br />
products, but also in promoting technological change and<br />
innovation in Australian industry.<br />
This years choice for the Australian Design. Award has<br />
three important characteristics:<br />
it is technologically advanced;<br />
its design is innovative, making it highly<br />
competitive with imports; and<br />
it has substantial export potential;<br />
These three characteristics exemplify the Government's<br />
goals for our manufacturing industry. For Australian<br />
industry to grow and develop it must become<br />
internationally competitive and export oriented.<br />
For me, there is a fourth characteristic the company<br />
is situated in Australia's No. 1 Electorate Wills.<br />
Indeed, the development and application of new<br />
technology iust be embraced as one of the driving forces </p>
<p>behind the process of economic change with important<br />
consequences for the competitiveness of industries.<br />
There is no escaping the fact that industrial innovation<br />
is essential to Australia's future economic wellbeing,<br />
not only in industries producing glamorous new products,<br />
but throughout established industries as well.<br />
However, the achievement of growth through innovation<br />
and technological change requires commitment by both<br />
industry and the Government.<br />
My Government has recognised that there are barriers to<br />
successful technological innovation, and we have put<br />
into place policies and programs to overcome many of<br />
these barriers. These include:<br />
the successful establishment of an economic<br />
environment conducive to industry growth and<br />
development which has resulted in a resurgence<br />
of profits from which investment in research and<br />
development, among other things, can proceed;<br />
incentives to stimulate private sector research<br />
and development, in particular the 150% tax<br />
incentive which has been effective from 1 July<br />
1985. These incentives are aimed at directly<br />
stimulating firms to undertake more and longer<br />
term investments in R D projects;<br />
the provision of venture capital through the<br />
Australian Industry Development Corporation as<br />
well as through taxation concessions for<br />
selected management investment companies for<br />
investments in tkechnologically intensive firms;<br />
and an examination of the methods by which public<br />
sector research can be transferred to industry<br />
These are the major Government measures.<br />
However, industry has an equal responsibility to<br />
overcome barriers to technological development and<br />
innovation. It is industry that stands to gain most in<br />
the long term.<br />
In the changing economic environment of the 1980s no<br />
longer can industry rely on protective barriers to<br />
maintain market shares, nor indeed can it rely on<br />
borrowed product and process technology that often<br />
operates on a scale less than that for which it was<br />
originally designed. r </p>
<p>The introduction of new or at least relevant<br />
technologies is essential if Australian industry is to<br />
once again significantly contribute to the Australian<br />
economy. In the Government's view there is a growing awareness in<br />
Australia that our major competitors, especially those<br />
within our own region, are undertaking new long term<br />
investments, adopting new business strategies and<br />
applying new technology. Our location in the most<br />
dynamic, forward-looking part of the world imposes on<br />
our industries a need to develop new technologies new<br />
products and processes if we are to compete<br />
effectively. Rapid growth of our trading partners will<br />
provide many market opportunities for future<br />
exploitation but only if we can improve our<br />
competitive performance.<br />
While the challenges are great, Australians need not be<br />
daunted or seek to avoid them. In fact, Australia is<br />
better placed than many of us appreciate. While there<br />
is plenty of room for improvement of our<br />
educationalsystem and research establishments, they are<br />
much higher in quality than in most countries within our<br />
region and reasonably good by the standards of<br />
industrial countries around the world. It is an<br />
advantage that our children grow up speaking English,<br />
the language of modern technology. In combination with<br />
our strong resource base, these human resources should<br />
enable Australia to move flexibly and effectively to<br />
take advantage of the emerging opportunities.<br />
In meeting these challenges, Australian industry must<br />
recognise the importance of, and increase its investment<br />
in, research and development.<br />
Countries such as Japan, America and Sweden, which have<br />
in the past recognised the importance of investment in<br />
research and development and innovation, have had growth<br />
patterns far in excess of Australia's. Australia, on<br />
the other hand, has a level of private sector R D less<br />
than nearly all comparable OECD countries.<br />
Australian Industry, therefore, must change its<br />
attitudes towards technological development and<br />
innovation and take advantage of the opportunities<br />
afforded to it by Government policies and programs which<br />
are designed to promote long-term structual change and<br />
economic growth. Strong, steady and sustained economic<br />
growth requires the progressive adoption of productive<br />
new technologies, structured change and high levels of<br />
investment. </p>
<p>4.<br />
I am heartened that there are some bodies such as the<br />
Australian Design Council which recognise and actively<br />
promote the importance of and the inter-relationship<br />
between technology, innovation and economic growth.<br />
I thank the Australian Design Council for promoting<br />
innovation and once again I congratulate Consolidated<br />
Electronics for their " CEICART" Machine. and I wish them<br />
and their employees a highly prosperous future. </p>
