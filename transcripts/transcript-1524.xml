STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE RT. HON.<br />
HAROLD HOLT, IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES<br />
16TH MARCH, 1967<br />
ANZAC COMMEMORATIVE MEDALLION AND BADGE<br />
Last March, the Minister for Defence announced that it had<br />
been decided by the Australian Government, in consultation with the New<br />
Zealand Government, to issue a medallion and lapel badge to the veterans<br />
of the Gallipoli Campaign.<br />
I am glad to be ale to announce that arrangements have now<br />
been completed for the production of the medallion and the badge. The<br />
Minister for the Army will be arranging distribution to those wishing to<br />
receive them as soon as possible.<br />
The Government hopes that production of the medallion and<br />
lapel badge will be sufficiently advanced to permit at least some of them<br />
to be distributed by Anzac Day.<br />
The medallion ( with the name of the recipient inscribed) will<br />
be issued to the surviving ' Members of the Australian Defence Force who<br />
served on the Gallipoli Peninsula, or in direct support of the operations<br />
from close off -shore, at any time during the period from the first Anzac<br />
Day in April, 1915 to the date of final evacuation in January, 1916. Next<br />
of kin or other entitled persons will be entitled to receive the medallion on<br />
behalf of their relatives, if the relative died on active service or has since<br />
died. For surviving members, a lapel badge will also be available<br />
for wearing. This will be a replica of teoverse ( or front) of the<br />
medallion and will be about 1" high and 2/ 3" wide the same size as the<br />
R. S. L. badge. The medallion is the work of Mr. Raymond Ewers, the wellknown<br />
Australian artist, based on a suggestion by Mr. Eric Garrett, a<br />
staff artist with the Department of the Army. It has been endorsed by<br />
both the Government of New Zealand and ourselves. It will be approximately<br />
3" high and 2" wide. The obverse of the medallion depicts Simpson and<br />
his donkey carrying a wounded soldier to safety. It will be bordered on<br />
the lower half by a laurel wreath above the word ANZAC. The reverse<br />
( the back) shows a map in relief of Australia and New Zealand superimposed<br />
by the Southern Cross. The lower half will be bordered by New Zealand<br />
fern leaves. The medallion will be cast in bronze and the lapel badge will<br />
be metal of a bronze colour.<br />
For the information of honourable members I present also a<br />
brief statement setting out the conditions of eligibility which will apply to<br />
the medallion and badge and the manner in which those desiring to receive<br />
them should apply. / 2 </p>
<p>BACKGROUND CONDITIONS OF ELIGIBILITY<br />
All members of the Australian Defence Force who served<br />
during the Gallipoli Campaign are entitled to receive the Anzac Commemorative<br />
medallion. The Campaign lasted from April 25, 1915 to January 8, 1916.<br />
The award will be made for service on the Gallipoli Peninsula and service<br />
in support of the operations in an area off-shore eastward of a line drawn<br />
from Yukyeri Point ( lat 39 SCU 40" N long 26 9' 45" E) through a point in<br />
lat 39 53' N long 26 0' E thence to Cape Gremea ( lat 40 35' N long 26 6' E).<br />
The award will also be available to members of philanthropic<br />
organisations and the Press who were accredited to the AIF, and to<br />
Australian members of the crews of merchant ships or hospital ships<br />
which operated in direct support within the defined area.<br />
Note The boundary line would run just off -shore from the land masses<br />
north and south of the Dardanelles, and is estimated to be within about<br />
miles from the beach at Anzac Cove.<br />
Applications Applications by next of kin of deceased Anzacs whose service<br />
conforms with the above conditions will be determined in accordance with<br />
the provisions applying to the issue of service medals. Briefly, these<br />
