TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
OPENING REMARKS AT PREMIERS' CONFERENCE, PARULAMENT<br />
HOUSE, CANBERRA, MONDAY 5 JULY 1993<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
I declare the meeting of the Premiers' Conference open and say that this Is<br />
somewhat of a significant occasion because this will be our first meeting where<br />
we have together participated In a study of the national fiscal outlook. Where,<br />
before, fiscal policy of our effect upon savings has always been something<br />
which we have together contemplated, on this occasion we have had quite a<br />
long run study between us and we have prepared a document called the<br />
* National Fiscal Outlook". And It attempts to look at the public sector, Its role<br />
over the medium term, its call on savings and therefore our role In Investment<br />
and in debt and In recovery.<br />
This is the first time we have sought to have that greater transparency,<br />
rationality, predicability thereby giving the rest of the country an Idea of where<br />
we are heading.<br />
This follows the meeting of the Council of Australian Governments which first<br />
met last year and in that it was itself a somewhat historic meeting because It<br />
was the first time that we separated out non-financial matters from the<br />
Premiers' Conference Loan Council agenda. Normally we would have an<br />
agenda for financial assistance grants, Loan Council matters et cetera then we<br />
would have other matters associated with it and invariably, as attendees of long<br />
standing here know we would not get often on to those issues. Now we have a<br />
separate non-financial meeting our Council of Australian Governments<br />
where such things as electricity generation and distribution, technical and<br />
further education, recognition of standards and reorganisation of ministerial<br />
councils has already produced a positive result and so In a way we have been<br />
operating the federation at the financial and at the policy level In a way that<br />
better meets the country's needs than we have In the past.<br />
We have been focusing on sensible, practical gains wherever we Could see<br />
them, and taking advantage of them. </p>
<p>At this meeting we have another opportunity to deal with the nation's public<br />
financing for the coming year and the fact that you now have a much better<br />
Idea of where the Commonwealth budget Is going by virtue of the national<br />
financial outlook and the fact that we now provide the States, all of you, and<br />
Territories with the ' offer document' at least two business days ahead of the<br />
meeting In this case last Friday means that all Governments represented<br />
here have an Idea of what the Commonwealth proposes and what you<br />
responses to it may be.<br />
The first thing I would like to say is that about the Issues of this meeting Is that<br />
this Is the third year of a real terms guarantee on the -pool of financial<br />
assistance grants to the States and we have maintained that commitment in<br />
that guarantee, on maintenance In real termns for 1 993-94. This for us Is<br />
despite considerable pressure on our own Budget, as you know in terms of the<br />
Outlook Statement.<br />
The Commonwealth offer also accepts In general terms the outcome of the<br />
1992-93 Grants Commission Review so, including all hospital funding grants In<br />
the base for both years, the Commonwealth In Its offer for this year is<br />
increasing comparable funding over $ 544 million over last year which Is an<br />
increase of about 3 per cent nominal and above the expected inflation rate.<br />
in that sense we think that we can do justice to the States In this and at the<br />
same time to national fiscal policy. It is very clearly the Commonwealth's view<br />
that the Budget IS playing an appropriate role In terms of cushioning the Impact<br />
of the recession and with the so-called natural stabilisers working. The world<br />
is slower than we thought it would be just a year or so ago and It Is just worth<br />
recalling that in December 1991 the OECD forecast for the year 1992 was 2.7<br />
per cent. That turned out to be .9 per cent which was a dramatic change from<br />
+ 3 growth for the OECD area as a whole to virtually And for 1993 in<br />
December 1991 the OECD forecast growth at 4.3 per cent for the area, In Its<br />
latest forecast It has 1993 coming out at .3 per cent. So a change from 4.3 per<br />
cent to .3 per cent and the previous year from 2.7 per cent to 9 per cent. This<br />
is a very dramatic change and most of that Is coming from in the case of<br />
Germany, Germany was In there for 1992 at 1.8 per cent and ended up for<br />
1993 at 2.5 per cent in forecast and ended up at -1.9 per cent. Japan was in at<br />
per cent and Its forecast for 1993 Is + 1 per cent rather than 3.5 per cent and<br />
the United States was 3.8 per cent and was In at 2.6 per cent. So, we can see<br />
how that 2.7 per cent and 4.3 per cent transiated themselves Into 9 per cent<br />
and per cent. That was not just the impact of restoring balance sheets and<br />
dealing with lower inflation and the blow out of the credit boom of the eighties,<br />
but the reunification of Germany has obviously put a very large dampener on<br />
European growth. That's obviously affected Japan as well and the United<br />
States. So, this is the context In which our fiscal situation Is set, And It means that for<br />
our country we've been growing of the order of 2.5 per cent while, as I say, the </p>
<p>OECD area In 1992-93 if you took at us, I just gave you the calender years<br />
but if you look across the financial year If you put OECD numbers In with our<br />
financial year we're growing at about 2.5 per cent and the OECD is growing at<br />
1 per cent. So we're doing better than twice the OECD growth rate. Now, part<br />
of that is because of the role of fiscal policy and lower interest rates and lower<br />
Inflation. And you saw on the national accounts a couple of weeks ago where a<br />
substantial contribution was being made from the public sector. And the public<br />
sector In deficit Is holding the growth in the economy up higher than It would<br />
otherwilse be.<br />
Now there is a view around the place, particularly from the Federal Opposition<br />
that we ought to be having the budget pulled more rapidly back into surplus.<br />
Well this Is very much a wrong view very much a wrong view. And, again, I<br />
remind people what the OECD secretariat and the IMF said just six or eight<br />
months ago. And that was, that the stance of fiscal policy In the area of the<br />
OECD and the IMF ought to be basically In deficit so that the world economy<br />
starts to come out. Now, that's meant that the One Nation funding which has<br />
been spent throughout calender 1992 and now Into calender 1993 Is playing its<br />
role not just in the nation of course, but In each state and it has had its<br />
own Impact upon fiscal policy.<br />
Now, I just paint that picture to put the setting. In that context, our budget and<br />
the maintenance of the same real In terms of payments to the states and<br />
the sixteen hundred million we're going to spend on health over the next three<br />
years is, we believe, getting the balance fairly right In terms of payments to the<br />
states. Now, I'm not sure what Premiers may say about the offer but I just want<br />
to make this point. And that Is that the Federal Opposition at the time of the<br />
last election was intent upon taking $ 709 million dollars out of financial<br />
assistance grants for this year. And that meant NSW losing $ 195 million,<br />
Victoria losing $ 145 million, Queensland $ 138 million, Westemn Australia $ 76<br />
million, South Australia $ 72 million, Tasmania $ 29 million, Northern Territory<br />
million and the ACT $ 11 million. Now, at the time we argued that that<br />
policy was a wrong policy I might say many of you couldn't see the wisdom<br />
of that position at the time and were happy to sign up to that policy and I only<br />
make the point that what you are receiving now Is far more generous than that<br />
which would have been received there.<br />
Could I just say that going back to the economic outlook could I just<br />
make these points. We are well positioned now to grow, particularly after the<br />
visit I had to China and Korea our stance with Asia, our competitiveness has<br />
improved thirty percent since the middle eighties has put us In a very good<br />
position to participate in the growth of this area of the world. We've got solid<br />
productivity growth at the moment, our productivity growing at about two per<br />
cent per annum. inflation is better than our trading partners; Australia's top five<br />
partners' inflation rate is 2.2 per cent and ours Is 1.2 per cent, well below that of<br />
our partners. As we said, manufactured exports In 1992-93 are now around<br />
per cent higher than a year earlier and nearly three times higher than a decade<br />
ago. interest rates are at historically low levels and, Importantly, the profit </p>
<p>share In the economy Is now already up to just about the late eighties level<br />
which Is beyond the sixties historic experience, even at this stage of the cycle.<br />
So, profitability has Improved, balance sheets of companies have improved and<br />
I think companies are In a position now where thley can look around for<br />
opportunities and take investment decisions.<br />
So, could I perhaps conclude on this note and invite the Treasurer to say a few<br />
things and then I'll Invite the Premiers to address the Commonwealth offer<br />
document and any other remarks they wish to make, just to say that In the<br />
1 980s Australian fiscal policy was arguably in better shape than any OECD<br />
country. As a consequence, we've been able to stand the shift in the budget<br />
balance better and cushion our economy better, than comparable countries.<br />
It's one of the reasons why we're growing at 2.5 per cent and they're growing at<br />
one per cent, on average. We know we've got a fiscal task to perform in the<br />
medium term. But not In 1993-94. 1993-94 Is a year when the budget should<br />
be In deficit; it's a year when we still need the public sector hauling activity<br />
along and at the same time encouraging private sector Investment. And It Is, as<br />
a result of that national fiscal outlook statement, that we will focus on the<br />
medium term of fiscal policy. And that statement allows all states to<br />
understand where we're coming from; It allows the public the opportunity to<br />
know what the shape of fiscal policy may be; and It also provides a role for the<br />
states In being part of that fiscal outlook and savings equation.<br />
So, we think the offer today Is a fair one, we've maintained our commitment to<br />
the real terms guarantee, we've sought also to receive the Grants Commission<br />
Report and Introduce It, and I remind you again that we'll be spending $ 1 ,600<br />
million over three years on health. So, with those things, we think In all the<br />
circumstances the Commonwealth offer Is a decent one and one which the<br />
states can accept.<br />
I now invite the Treasurer to augment my remarks.<br />
ends. </p>
