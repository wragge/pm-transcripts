FOR PRESS-: P. M. No. 11/ 1963<br />
EUROPEAN COMMON MARKET<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister,( t, Ho. R. G. Menzies)<br />
Cabinet today gave consideration to the latest<br />
dramatic developments in relation to the United Kingdom's<br />
application to join the 4. iropean Common Market.<br />
Throughout the long negotiations, we have<br />
ministerially, officially, and publicly presented our interests<br />
and views in a constructive and co-operative way, based upon<br />
two major propositions. The first was that the ultimate decision to<br />
join or not to join would be made by the United Kingdom and<br />
not by us, since we are not direct parties to either the<br />
application or the negotiations.<br />
The second was that we wished to see terms<br />
secured by the United Kingdom which recognised the continuing<br />
importance of protecting our own long-established and vital<br />
trading interests. Those interests remain and, of course,<br />
our anxiety to see them protected remains.<br />
At the same time, we have a sincere feeling of<br />
sympathy for the Government of Great Britain in the manner in<br />
which the negotiations were terminated. It certainly comes as<br />
a great shock that one of the negotiating parties, France~<br />
should have terminated the talks for published reasons which,<br />
if they had been stated originally, would probably have rendered<br />
the whole process of negotiation unnecessary0<br />
We recognise that the British Government will<br />
itself need to sort out the present position. It-may' well take<br />
some wreeks to discover what the effect of France* Lt's a. ctl~ on is<br />
upon the other Member-countries of the Common Market and, for'<br />
that matter, upon the policies of Great Britain herselfi<br />
Our position, which I am communicating to Mr.<br />
Macmillan, is that if the British Government, when it has made<br />
its own assessment of the present position, desires to have<br />
direct discussions with Australia, we will be immediately willing<br />
to engage in such discussions on both the ministerial and<br />
official level. Whatever the immediate European outcome, the<br />
trade relationships between Great Britain and Australia remain<br />
of the liveliest importance though they are of course at present<br />
dealt with by the 1956 Trade Agreement which is still current<br />
and by other existing commodity arrangements. We are not<br />
attracted by the idea of an early Prime Ministerst Conference,<br />
which we think would be in the present relatively confused state<br />
of affairs premature. But as I have said, we will be quite<br />
willing to engage in bi-latere-l discussions whenever they are<br />
sought. Meanwhile, our drive for new and diversified<br />
markets, which has boen vigorously and most successfully pursued<br />
for years, goes on. We have great hopes of better and better<br />
results, particularly having regard to the remarkable degree<br />
of stability in the cost level which has been achieved in<br />
Australia in recent years.<br />
CANBERRA, February, 1963. </p>
