AUSTRALIA,<br />
FOR PRESS 10 May 1976<br />
ADDRESS AT THE LAUNCHING OF A BOOK BY GUY BOYD<br />
The last time I took part in a presentation with Guy<br />
B~ oyd he was making the p-resentation. At that time we were<br />
in the middle of a somewhat dramatic course of events<br />
and Guy Boyd was offering some very welcome support.<br />
The work that he presented obviously brought us luck. It<br />
was followed very shortly by the greatest election victory<br />
in Australia's history.<br />
You will understand therefore why it is a very special<br />
pleasure for me today to be taking part in a presentation<br />
of a book on Guy Boyd's outstanding work.<br />
In presenting this book on behalf of Guy Boyd, I hope that<br />
it will have an enormous publishing success. It certainly<br />
deserves to.<br />
There must be an exceptional challenge to both artist,<br />
authors and publisher in presenting the work of a distinguished<br />
sculptor in book form.<br />
Having browsed through an early copy of this book which was<br />
sent to me I am impressed by the quality of the photography<br />
and the sense of the works which the photographs convey.<br />
I am not surprised to hear that the book has taken two years<br />
to prepare, or that many of the sculptures had to be specially<br />
treated so they could be effectively photographed. / 2 </p>
<p>The authors Anne Von Bertouch and Professor Patrick<br />
Hutchings have provided a fine accompainment to the photographs<br />
and I am sure that Guy Boyd must be delighted with the<br />
product. Lansdowne Editions are to be congratulated on their enterprise<br />
in producing this volume.<br />
The recognition of Guy Boyd's work by this book is a<br />
tribute to the quality of-his skill and the wish of many people<br />
that his work be more widely accessible.<br />
Guy Boyd's work has been-exhibited widely in Australia, and<br />
overseas. This book will help to bring it to a still wider<br />
audience. Guy Boyd's wor'k indeed the work of his whole<br />
family illustrates the great vitality of artistic life<br />
in Australia a vitality too often underrated.<br />
Through his work, Guy Boyd has helped to make this vitality know,, n<br />
to people overseas as well as at home. In exhibiting his work<br />
in other countries, Guy Boyd of course joins that very<br />
distinguished band of Australians who are making Australian<br />
art a vital part of the international artistic culture.<br />
It must be of great value to Australian art for such interchanges<br />
to take place for the best of Australian art to be exhibited<br />
abroad and-for the best art of other countries to come to Australia.<br />
Ensuring that Australians have access to the best art of other<br />
countries is one area whcre I believe the Government can have a<br />
useful role. Indleed, I believe, more generally, that the<br />
Government can have a constructive role to play in encouraging<br />
and facilitating the development of Australia's artistic life.<br />
Such a role must always be treated with caution the tastes of<br />
Governments are not renowned for their great sophistication.<br />
And when Governments rely on the tastes of a few they run the<br />
risk of favouring one section of the arts, one school, over<br />
another. 3 </p>
<p>If Government is to take a role in the encouragement of<br />
artistic endeavour it must do so with great sensitivity.<br />
In the absence of such sensitivity it would be all too easy<br />
for our artistic life to be distorted by the whims of a few.<br />
There is hardly an area of the arts where Australia has not<br />
excelled. The growing vitality of the arts in Australia is<br />
largely spontaneous but can certainly be helped by well-conceived<br />
actions of the Government.<br />
Previous Federal Liberal and Country Party Governments<br />
took a keen interest in encouraging the creative and -performing<br />
arts in Australia. They established the Commonwealth Literary<br />
Board, the Australian National Gallery, the Arts Council and<br />
they took the first steps in the establishement of the Film<br />
Corporation. I am pleased to recall that as Minister I took<br />
an active part in establishinig the Canberra School of" Music.<br />
A Government Parties Committee has now been established<br />
undcer the Chairmanship of David Hamer to assist it in developing<br />
the arts in Australia. During the Parliamentary recess this<br />
Committee will be visiting all States and meeting with people<br />
involved in the arts.<br />
I have been personally concerned that the Government's activities in<br />
promoting creative artists endeavour in Australia should<br />
remain with the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet and<br />
the Committee I have just referred to will be reporting directly<br />
to me.<br />
Yoei will all know that the Government is very concerned at the<br />
present time to review all areas of Government spending.<br />
Cabinet, in fact, has been meeting over the last few days for<br />
precisely this purpose. Every area of Government spending<br />
is being examined in the enquiry we are presently making.<br />
I need hardly say that Government activities in the arts are along<br />
with every other area, under very close examination at present. 14 </p>
<p>I do not want to pre-empt the results of that examination<br />
which is still proceeding by being too specific in my<br />
comments today, but the Government's commitments should not<br />
be in doubt. Let me re-eiphasise the broad purposes of the Government<br />
in this area.<br />
We fully intend to encourage the continued growth and<br />
development of the arts in Australia. In particular, it is<br />
our intention to encourage the development of Australian art<br />
rather than costly purchases overseas. We intend, for example,<br />
to give effect to the National-Gallery's policy of giving<br />
priority to. the purchase of Australian arts.<br />
Alongside this policy, Australia must of course be open to<br />
influence from overseas. Great art inevitably must cross political<br />
frontiers. We have announced our intention to support a more<br />
vigorous sponsorship of exhibitions which will give Australians<br />
ready access to the arts and culture of other countries.<br />
Australians are and ought to be in the vanguard of the aztistic<br />
world. Australia is more than an . efficient economy. Australia<br />
can be part of a vital world culture and the Government intends<br />
to play a part in encouraging this development.<br />
Guy Boyd and the other members of his family have made an enormous<br />
great contribution to the growth of Australian artistic life.<br />
I am delighted that in this book Guy Boyd's sculptural<br />
contribution has been recognised.<br />
I have much pleasure in launching this book.<br />
