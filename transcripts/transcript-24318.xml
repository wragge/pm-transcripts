<p>Air Marshal Geoff Brown will complete his tenure on 3 July 2015 having also demonstrated exceptional leadership throughout his military career, particularly in his role as the Chief of the Air Force during a period of significant capability growth within the Air Force and heightened operational commitments, including currently against the ISIL, or Daesh, death cult in Iraq.</p>
