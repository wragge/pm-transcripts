PRIME MINISTER, DC) ORSTOP BRISBANE, 3 FEBRUARY 1992.<br />
E OE PROOF ONLY<br />
PM: I might just begin by saying that I've just<br />
completed the last of a national round of discussions. I've<br />
got to see one or two more peak industry groups but by and<br />
large that completes, today's discussions, completes the round<br />
of national talks; and now the Government will sit down and<br />
largely from here on construct this economic statement which<br />
we expect to deliver on 26 February. So the real fightback<br />
for Australia, not as I said earlier the phoney one, the<br />
pretend one, il1 begin when the Government announces its<br />
statement of economic changes on 26 February.<br />
QUESTIONs Mr Keating why bring the statement forward, it<br />
was anticipated it was going to be March?<br />
PM: No, no, it's not coming forward, no there'e<br />
been no, the Government's been thinking about this, presenting<br />
it in it's initial week of sittings and that's what we're<br />
going to do.<br />
QUESTION: Prime Minister what particular case did<br />
Queensland make today? was there anything that particularly<br />
grabbed your attention?<br />
PM: A number of things but they are again, there<br />
is, the Premier had, well firstly I had discussion with the<br />
Premier about the State, the State's needs, about<br />
infrastructure and other issues in particular, and then he<br />
convened a meeting of the various sectors of industry and of<br />
course they addressed things which were sector specific.<br />
Some of them Queensland in general, in the main sector<br />
specific, and like all such industry discussions some of it<br />
we'd heard before, some of it new and it's the new bits that<br />
matter. QUESTION: Were you impressed with what you heard up<br />
there? PM: Oh I thought it was a very good discussion... I<br />
couldn't have hoped for more, I couldn't have hoped for a<br />
better discussion. </p>
<p>QUESTION; So it was worthwhile coming?<br />
PM: Absolutely.<br />
QUESTIONs what do you mean sector specific?<br />
PM:. Well they were talking about tourism, farmingf<br />
manufacturing, mining, these sorts of things.<br />
QUESTION: inaudible<br />
PM: Well they are things to note, things for us to<br />
note and think about....,. no, no, because you might talk about<br />
them when we might not in the end decide on things but it in<br />
important for us to get a frame of reference, a framework of<br />
reference which you can only get from discussions. I might<br />
add by the way Dr Heweon said we shouldn't have been doing any<br />
of this. He said businessmen and business women are only<br />
looking for a handout and that we shouldn't talk to them.<br />
Well that's not been my view. The process of consultation was<br />
conducted quite ambitiously through the 1980s and I think<br />
Australia has advanced accordingly much faster as a result of<br />
the fact that the Government did keep contact with the<br />
community in general.<br />
QUESTION: Mr Keating the balance of payments figures<br />
today does thet latest figure give you greater room to move<br />
in this looming statement of February 26?<br />
PM: Like I said last month, last month's figures<br />
didn't contract our room to move and this month's figure<br />
doesn't improve it. This is a good number by any measure,<br />
imports have fallen away quite sharply and the result is the<br />
current account for the month is down. One of the again,<br />
good factors, good things there was manufactured exports<br />
continued to grow strongly which has been the trend of the<br />
last half dozen ears and that's of course our saving grace<br />
getting that balance between the primary export sector,<br />
manufacturing and services.<br />
QUESTION: Well today's figure won't see you loosening the<br />
purse strings any more than you've been prepared to do up<br />
until now? </p>
<p>PM: No, no because it'Isa, again we make the point<br />
about balancel of payments figures monthly, they're up one<br />
monthI down the next, if you average them it's where, it's the<br />
three and six month averages where you see the trends and the<br />
trend in this one has been the right way.<br />
QUESTION: Spending about two billion in the package?<br />
PM.&amp; Well that's for us you'll have to wait and<br />
see what we spend.<br />
QUESTION: Prime Minister are you talking about one-off<br />
measures as weill as policy changes or..... inaudible...<br />
PM: well the package will be measures aimed at<br />
inducing a recovery and lifting employment, getting back to<br />
creating jobs which is the principal thing it's about. But<br />
it's about also having a structural and productive focus as<br />
well as having an effect on the cycle. In other words we<br />
want to do something more clever than simply have a budget<br />
bang that costs money and doesn't do much in the long term.<br />
We want these changes to be productive and structural as well.<br />
QUESTION: Are you still of the view that some States<br />
deserve a leg up over others, such as Victoria?<br />
PM: No, but each States have different problemi,<br />
Victoria carried the great ballast of manufacturing industry<br />
and manufacturing protection and the fallout from a lot of the<br />
economic changes have been greater in Victoria t~ an they have<br />
in other places. Similarly other States have been affected by<br />
downturns in other sectors, obviously what happens in rural<br />
commodities affects Queensland more than it affects Victoria.<br />
QUESTION: The Queensland Government is of the view that a<br />
leg up say to Victoria would be rewarding them for bad<br />
economic managament. what's your reaction to that?<br />
PM: Well they didn't put that view to me today.<br />
QUESTION: a Mr Keating are you sympathetic to the plight of<br />
the farmers for urgent land finance or special assistance in<br />
order to assis~ t them to plant a winter crop in the coming<br />
weeks? </p>
<p>PM: Well I'm not here to debate specific measures<br />
about QUESTION: You did mention the rural downturn in<br />
Queens land.<br />
PM: Yets I know, but you must also remember that in<br />
terms of commodities, the Government has got a guarantee<br />
of three billion in there under wool, we spent a couple, we've<br />
got a couple of billion of cover on wheat, and I think, you<br />
know, in the face of these international difficulties the<br />
Government's done about as much as you can possibly do to<br />
generally insulate the various sectors of rural Australia from<br />
international declining prices. But fortunately wheat prices<br />
are picking up, and that's the most important thing.<br />
QUESTION: A lot of these f armers are still going to need<br />
pretty easy access to plant a crop.<br />
PM:* But part of it was uncertainty about prices and<br />
wheat prices have picked up.<br />
QUESTION: Prime Minister Mr Goss said this morning if any<br />
State deserves special attention it should be the big growth<br />
States like Queensland and Western Australia because of their<br />
capacity to lead Australia out of recession through the<br />
resource and tourism sectors. Have you got any sympathy f or<br />
that view?<br />
PM: I have, I have, but other Premiers will say<br />
they have got the big populations and the big problems and<br />
what do you say to that?<br />
QUESTION: Wel~ l what do you say?<br />
PM:* Well I think they've both got a case and that's<br />
why I think one has to have a decent balance in one'Is view<br />
about things and do things which are to the national good,<br />
that have national effects and that have a commion thread<br />
running through them. </p>
<p>QUESTION: Queensland will be happy though do you think<br />
when you bringr the statement down?<br />
PM4, Well I should hope so, I mean as Treasurer I<br />
often defended the fact against the Premier of NSW and the<br />
premiers of victoria of my support for federal funding for<br />
Queensland -the adoption of Grants Commission formulae which<br />
they always regarded as a travesty. I still defended it and<br />
Queensland got the money.<br />
QUESTION; Should these measures you are looking at be<br />
population driven or should they be industry driven?<br />
PM:. Oh that's too simplistic a question.<br />
QUESTION: But were you criticised today for giving<br />
Queensland too little priority, in fact getting here too late<br />
in the exercise?<br />
PM Not at all I mean I arranged this weeks ago<br />
and it's just a matter of sticking to an itinerary. No I<br />
think, look, this notion about which I noticed in some of<br />
the newspapers about Queensland not getting attention, is<br />
really not on. I mean I notice the Courier Mail today is<br />
attacking us because there are not enough company directors on<br />
company board~ s in Queensland. This is a Federal Government<br />
sin apparently and then it said also it was not getting enough<br />
super fund money, so apparently this is a F'ederal Government<br />
problem. The fact is this sort of State-centric view of the<br />
world I think does not do Queensland justice, Queensland is<br />
better than that, it's doing better than that and the fact is<br />
obvious in the fact it's got so much growth which has occurred<br />
in the State.<br />
QUESTION: Mr Keating can you assure Queensland electors<br />
that they an. not going to suffer as a result of Queensland's<br />
ALP largely firm backing for ex-Prime Minister Hawke?<br />
PM: Oh well I, look, you know, I'm here to talk<br />
about jobs, recovery, the future of the economy, not the<br />
Queensland Labor Party's view about particular things<br />
including that.<br />
QUESTION., QUESaIrOeN : wYooruk ing with the Premier Closely? </p>
