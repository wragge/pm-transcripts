FOR MEDIA: SUNDAY 9 MARCH 1980<br />
ELECTORATE TALK<br />
The Government's determination to provide Australia with responsible<br />
economic management and lower taxes has been strongly<br />
reaffirmed. The decisions announced by Mr. Howard in Parliament<br />
last Thursday demonstrate in the clearest terms that our fight against<br />
inflation is still a first priority and that we recognise the<br />
need for tax relief. We are committed to reducing taxes to the<br />
extent that is economically responsible.<br />
We have taken two key tax decisions. Within the scope available<br />
we felt that benefits should be concentrated on single income<br />
families, and particularly those on low incomes. Therefore from<br />
July 1, the rebate for a dependent spouse will be increased by<br />
$ 203 a year from $ 597 to $ 800. There will also be equivalent<br />
percentage increases in the various other rebates the daughter/<br />
housekeeper, housekeeper, sole parent, invalid relative and parent<br />
rebates. For example, the sole parent rebate will rise from $ 417<br />
to $ 559 and the invalid relative rebate from $ 270 to $ 362. well<br />
over 2 million families will benefit as a result of these changes<br />
in rebates.<br />
The second major tax decision is to apply 50 per cent tax indexation<br />
for personal tax scales. This means that the tax threshold that<br />
is the leveil at which tax begins increases from $ 3,893 to $ 4,033.<br />
P. 11 taxpayers will benefit as a result. A taxpayer on the standard<br />
rate with a dependent spouse will be $ 4.70 a week better as a<br />
result of the changes. When allowance is made for the higher<br />
rebates the effective threshold for a taxpayer with a dependent<br />
spouse will increase from $ 5,698 to $ 6,533, and for a sole parent<br />
from $ 5,153 to $ 5,779. The taxpayer without dependents will<br />
benefit less, because we wished to help families most. However,<br />
a taxpayer without dependents on the standard rate of tax will<br />
still receive a tax cut of 85 cents a week.<br />
The Treasurer estimates that the new tax measures will take more<br />
than $ 600 million from our revenues so it is a significant<br />
decision. And the major benefit by far the largest percentage<br />
decrease in tax paid will go to Australia's single income families,<br />
and particularly to those with lower incomes. Those families with<br />
the lowest incomes will receive the greatest proportionate reduction<br />
in tax. That decision, that bias in favour of single income<br />
families was quite deliberate, because at the moment there is a<br />
bias against them. We therefore felt it right to increase spouse<br />
rebates so that single income families benefited by most. The<br />
introduction of the new tax measures from July 1 and not at an<br />
earlier date is consistent with prudent economic management. .2<br />

<p>The Government decided to use the estimated additional $ 340<br />
million from crude oil revenues this financial year to reduce<br />
the budget deficit. A lower deficit is a key weapon in lowering<br />
inflationary pressures. It will as a result help to keep down<br />
price rises and interest rates. Because of our responsible<br />
economic policies we have had only a slight rise in interest<br />
rates compared with other countries. Interest rates in the United<br />
States have risen by 5 per cent since the middle of last year<br />
and in the United Kingdom by 3 per cent. Interest rateg in<br />
Australia have risen by around 1 per cent.<br />
Australia as a trading nation cannot totally isolate itself<br />
from overseas problems. But what we can do and are doing is<br />
to make sure that our own economy is strong and well run, and<br />
that we retain the competitive edge. To do this it is essential<br />
that we maintain indeed strengthen the downward pressure on<br />
inflation. The benefits will show in increased employment and<br />
economic prosperity.<br />
Employment has risen by 2.3 per cent over the last year and<br />
economic growth has been faster than we expected at the time of<br />
the last budget. For the well-being of workers, industries,<br />
farming communities and for the security of all Australians on<br />
fixed incomes we can never slacken in this resolve. In essence,<br />
Mr. Howard's statement demonstrates our commitment to build on our<br />
hard won economic gains and to ease the tax burden on those most<br />
in need. 000---</p>
