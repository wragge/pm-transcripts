PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA FRIDAY, 28 JANUARY 1983<br />
BHP UTAH DEAL<br />
The Commonwealth Government welcomes the BHP<br />
initiative in acc uiring from General Electric a major<br />
part of Utah International. The arrangements should<br />
not involve any conflicts with the Government's<br />
foreign investment guidelines. Indeed, as a greater<br />
part of Utah's activities are located in Australia,<br />
the result will be greatly increased Australian<br />
ownership and management of key resources industries.<br />
As a result of acquiring one of the world's most<br />
successful mining companies, BH1P will also have a<br />
significant presence in the Western Hemisphere.<br />
The agreement will give Australia an increased<br />
influence in the international resources field as<br />
well as strengthening and rationalising industry<br />
on-shore.<br />
This is a bold step by BHP. A move such as this<br />
by a major Australian company helps reinforce<br />
Australia's position as an important economy in the<br />
region and, indeed, in the world.<br />
