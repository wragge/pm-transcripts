THE RT. HONo R. G. MENZILS AT CANBERRA ON<br />
FRIDAY, 5TH AUGUST, 1960, AT 10.30 A. M.<br />
Any decision yet Sir, on Australia's contribution<br />
to the Hunger C. mnoaign Food and<br />
Agricultural Organisation; I think you mentioned<br />
earlier in the year you would consider some<br />
contribution. I cannot answer that off-hand. I have a<br />
vague idea something has happened about it, but<br />
it is not clear in my mind. I will find out.<br />
Mr. Ca3lwell has suggested a Parliamentary<br />
Committee on Now Guinea, Sir a joint committee<br />
to investigate the position there.<br />
Yes, I noticed that. I thought that perhaps<br />
when he comes back and when we are in touch with<br />
each other, I ; ight have a word with him about<br />
that just to see the shape of what he has in<br />
mind. It will need, of course, to be discussed<br />
with the Cbinet then.<br />
Hzve you any other observations on New<br />
Guinea at the moment, Sir, that you can make?<br />
I don't think so. Except that since there<br />
has been a lot of artifically created confusion<br />
about our policy with allegations of differences<br />
between my policy and Mr. Hasluck's there<br />
being no differences whatever he and I have<br />
in hand the preparation of a short statement of<br />
policy which we will submit to the Cabinet<br />
with the idea of making it available quite early<br />
in the forthcoming session.<br />
For debate, Sir?<br />
I won't have any objection to it being<br />
debated.. I think that will be useful. Nor will<br />
there be any novelty in the statement, because as<br />
I say there are no differences about it.<br />
Will the statement by the one, Sir, in<br />
which the target dates will be set?<br />
No. This will be one on the broad policy<br />
that we have in relation to the Territory of<br />
Papua and New Guinea.<br />
There have been suggestions, Mr. Menzies,<br />
of discrimination between the natives and whites<br />
in New Guinea. W4ould you care to<br />
I have seen them only in one or two sections of<br />
the newspapers, particularly in one newspaper<br />
which spares no pains to create the impression<br />
that these discriminations exist in Australia.<br />
How about Mr. Clyde Cameron's activities;<br />
Well, I would have to rely on hearsay if I<br />
said what I would like to say about them. Get<br />

that down accurately that's a good sentence.<br />
Do you wish to elaborate further on that<br />
No. What sections of the Press are you referring<br />
to, seriously?<br />
Oh, now, come, come. What's the next<br />
question? Anything on the Congo, Sir?<br />
No nothing more.<br />
It looks pretty sticky.<br />
Yes. Well it is a fine example of an unprepared<br />
country getting self-government.<br />
Does it pose any lesson for New Guinea, Sir?<br />
It does not I think, have any particular<br />
bearing on that. The British colonial policy has<br />
always been somewhat different from the colonial<br />
policy of some other countries, and the whole<br />
idea has been to prepare the idigenous populations<br />
for ultimate self-government by steady stages so<br />
that they don't find themselves plunged into<br />
responsibilities that they are not trained to<br />
discharge. That is thc. tragedy of the Congo:<br />
this is going back to tribal warfare, very largely.<br />
You said a month ago, Sir, that the Prime<br />
Ministers had decided about the question of<br />
technical economic aid for the African countries.<br />
Has that take-n on any specific form?<br />
Not yet.<br />
Are wc contemplating doing anything for the<br />
Congo? The Congo is in thu hands of the United<br />
Nations and I have no doubt that they are examining<br />
both the economic as. woll as the military<br />
aspects of it. it is a tremendous problem.<br />
Incidentally a lot of white people have been<br />
killed in the Congo, as well as many others.<br />
Has Australia received any request from the United<br />
Nations to supply any troops at all for the Congo?<br />
No. Unless there is some Staff Officer or<br />
somebody from some other force, but you had butter<br />
ask Mr. Townley about that. But " troops" in the<br />
sense that you me: an it, No.<br />
Will we be sending a Minister to the General<br />
Assembly this year, Sir,<br />
I do not know. I have not settled the team<br />
yet. But I think that having regard to certain<br />
developments you know certain problems that<br />
are current it will be necessary to send a<br />
Minister. / 3<br />

PRI-E VINISTER Will you go yourself, Sir?<br />
No.<br />
Could you give mc a lead on who will go?<br />
No, I cannot.<br />
Is there anything you can tell us -bout<br />
legislation for the cci-. ng jession, Sirs<br />
No. You h-' d better ask the Attorney-<br />
General bout that:; he can answer those questions.<br />
Or Kolt H-olt would know what he is contemplating<br />
in the legislative programme. I<br />
Haven't discussed anything with him yet.<br />
Kr. i'enzies, assuming your Government is<br />
going to bring down a balanced budget, will many<br />
people get hurt in the process'<br />
You may make no assumption whatever about I.<br />
the Budget except that it is not yet disclosed.<br />
Is it going to be a good one, Sir?<br />
What's the next question? ( Laughter)<br />
The Constitutional Committee? What is<br />
the progress that has been made on that, Sir,<br />
since your return' Have you given any consideration<br />
to it? Has Sir Garfield'<br />
We have had no Cabinet on it. He is<br />
examining it, and so am I. But I don't think<br />
you need anticipate any legislation in this<br />
Session. Anything further on the restrictive trade<br />
practices and monopolies mentioned in the<br />
Governor-General's speech earlier this year,<br />
Sir' Well I cannot answer that off hand. I have<br />
not got around to that: we have had other<br />
matters in Cabinet. If anything is to be said<br />
about that it will no doubt be said in the course<br />
of this Session.<br />
Imports are running at a level which is<br />
alarming manufacturers again, Sir. Do you think<br />
that there is any...<br />
It is to be anticipated that there will<br />
be some fall in our overseas reserves in the<br />
course of the financial year. That was<br />
contemplated at the time Import Licensing<br />
was, in substance, lifted That is not to say<br />
that it is contemplated that that is a process<br />
which goes on indefinitely. It seemded to the<br />
Government to be clear that the first effect<br />
of raising import restrictions would be to<br />
produce a quickened demand for imports which<br />
might form a sort of hump in the import graPi<br />
But the whole policy has been based on the<br />
assumption that there will be some decline in<br />
overseas reserves. </p>

PRIME FLiSTER:<br />
QLJESTIO\: You do not see anything for concern in the<br />
situation, Sir?<br />
1o. There is nothing unexpected about it.<br />
ire you satisfied, Sir, wlith the capital<br />
ihflow that occurred in the last year and this<br />
one. I aimi, and I do not see any reason why it<br />
should not continue.<br />
Is the width of that import huirp, Sir,<br />
a bit wider that Cabinet m:-ay have first anticipated<br />
back in Scberuary2<br />
I do not think so, no.<br />
The Director of the . Associated Chan* bers of<br />
1anufacturers suggests th-t australia ray be<br />
flooded with second-hand cars from the United<br />
States as a result of thec removal of import<br />
restrictions. Has th. t bccn brought to your<br />
notice r. Kenzies'<br />
No. Unless there is something quite<br />
uncommon, I would not necessarily know about it.<br />
You might ask r. lcEwen about that.<br />
Sir, it has been reported from London that<br />
Britain will send a inister to Australia to<br />
discuss the posqsible development of the Blue<br />
Streak Rocket as a space research vehicle,<br />
Sir, could you give us any indication of the<br />
tiing of those talks or "' Yut us in" on the<br />
Blue Streak. I am at present in communication with 1r.<br />
Macmillan about it, and I think it is quite clear<br />
that he is going to send a Minister, probably<br />
with so: 1c expert people. But as to ' when' and<br />
' wlhat work' ought to be done in advance, well<br />
those are ;-atters that we are discussing by<br />
conmunication with each other. As to who the<br />
: inister will be, I do not know, but I expect<br />
that he will be a fairly senior Minister.<br />
Sir, have you reached any decision on the<br />
programme for Australian Space research put<br />
forward by the Academy of Science'<br />
No, there is nothing I can say ibout that.<br />
It was anrounced in the Cor-rmons, Sir, in<br />
respect of th. is visit that Britain was completing<br />
and would shortly send to you a technical<br />
appraisal on the prospects of space research<br />
here. Have you received it yet?<br />
e have had some papers from them, but we<br />
anticipatE that we will have more before we<br />
arrive at any conclusions with the visitors.<br />
Sir, the Iindonesian Government, thl-rough<br />
its inbassy hcre, has made some rather strong<br />
statements on the visit of the Dutch warships<br />
to lest 1\ ew Guinea. Does the Australian<br />
Government have any risgivings at all about the<br />

QUESTION: PRIME MIiNISTER:<br />
QUESTION: PRl E MINISTER:<br />
QTUESTION: PRIME MIi,' ISTER: presence of the Dutch warships going to ' lest<br />
New Guinea? We think the Dutch have a perfect right<br />
to send a warship there if they wish to. It<br />
would. be a very strange thing if our attitude<br />
was that the Dutch were not to maintain a<br />
posture of defence in respect of Jest New<br />
Guinea. At the very best their forces in West<br />
New Guinea are a tiny fraction of the forces<br />
available to Indonesia. I am perfectly certain<br />
th.. t the Dutch are not proposing to do anything<br />
provocative, nor will their warships, I am<br />
perfectly certain, enter Indonesian waters.<br />
There is no reason why the Dutch should be<br />
provocative. Anything, Sir, about the visit by Dr.<br />
Soekarno? No. The next nove, I think, is at their<br />
end. But it does not appear to be on the cards<br />
this year. Lasn't there an announcement from Djakarta,<br />
Sir, shortly before you returned that it had<br />
been cancelled? That could not have been right, because it<br />
had never been made, so it could not be<br />
cancelled. Let us put it this way, then, Sir:<br />
Yes: but he had never said he would..<br />
I remember hearing about that but it was just<br />
" tosh". You do not cancel an arrangement if<br />
you have not made one. The position is that<br />
I invited him to come. I said I thought there<br />
would be advantages in it and that I thought he<br />
would find it a very useful journey just as I<br />
had found my journey through Indonesia-and that i<br />
contact with our own Ambassador if his people<br />
could fix a convenient date for his visit, we<br />
would be delighted. fell he has not been able to.<br />
That will stand for next year<br />
Yes. It is an open invitation. But that<br />
earlier story rather suggests that he, having<br />
agreed to come, has now decided. not to come.<br />
WJell that is quite wrong: he has not broken<br />
any arrangement, because no arrangement was made.<br />
Sir, there has been some surprise expressed<br />
at the re-construction of the floor in King's<br />
Hall. Did the Cabinet authorise it?<br />
This is not a Cabinet matter. Presumably<br />
the Parliamentary authorities who have a vote<br />
for repairs and maintenance arranged this. It<br />
certainly did not ever come before me or the<br />
C:. hinet. B': t then, it would not. I suppose it<br />
will be just as slippery as the old one: we<br />
will all have to practise walking with bended<br />
knees and rubber heels. You can tell a Canberra<br />
man anywhere in the world by his gait. </p>

No. So far I an doing rather well, I<br />

No, thank you. Somebody else can do that.<br />
Sir, it has been announced officially that<br />
the Queen and Prince Philip will be going to<br />
India next year and the next year the Empire<br />
Games will be held in Perth. Has the West<br />
Australian Premier had any talks with you about<br />
a Royal Visit for 1962.<br />
Yes. Can you say what the result of it is, Sir?<br />
Io. I never make any statements about<br />
those things. I think it is fairly ' notorious'<br />
that he did have a word with me about it.<br />
I-there anything more we can say, or<br />
advance anything further, Sir?<br />
No, you just engage in your usual guess<br />
work. Oh! No' I never do that, Sir.<br />
He is under new man: agement: he has given<br />
up guessing. Could you say whether a visit is actually<br />
being arranged.<br />
I cannot say anything about it.<br />
When do you think you will be in a position<br />
to say something, Sir?<br />
I do not know.<br />
Can we take it that you have not wiped the<br />

You can take nothing. You cannot get a<br />
