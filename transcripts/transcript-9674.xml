PRIME MINISTER<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING, MP<br />
AUSTRALIA REMEMBERS WOMEN IN DEFENCE FORCES CEREMONY<br />
CANBERRA, 25 JULY 1995<br />
I am honoured to be delivering this address in another splendid ' Australia<br />
Remembers' commemorative event<br />
But this ceremony is different.<br />
At the launching of ' Australia Remembers' almost 12 months ago, I said that<br />
the Government wanted women to be involved in the commemorations to an<br />
extent that women have never been involved in our major national<br />
commemorations before.<br />
We have not been disappointed.<br />
It is my great pleasure to welcome you all to Parliament House. Thank you<br />
for coming.<br />
Today we remember what Australian women gave to their country and the<br />
cause of freedom in World War 11.<br />
They gave their labour and their love of this country. Many of them gave their<br />
lives.<br />
They gave themselves totally to the defence of Australia and the things<br />
Australia stood for the principles of freedom, democracy and human<br />
decency, the way of life Australians had constructed here, their communities<br />
and families.<br />
They worked at tasks Australian women had never taken on before. They<br />
served in places where Australians had never been. They served as one,<br />
regardless of where or what circumstances they came from.<br />
They played an essential role in the defence of Australia. </p>
<p>2<br />
As Mr Sciacca said, the response to calls for enlistment in the women's<br />
services was overwhelming some 67,000 enlisted in our armed forces.<br />
Within a year of the declaration of war in Europe, almost a third of all<br />
Australia's trained nurses had volunteered to serve overseas. The first of<br />
them embarked within four months of the beginning of the war. They served<br />
in Palestine, Libya, Egypt, Greece, Eritrea, Syria, the South-West Pacific and<br />
in England.<br />
Their experience is part of the Australian experience; it is inseparable from<br />
our military history, our national legends and traditions, and the inspiration<br />
and values we draw from these things.<br />
Women served during the blitz on London. They saw war in the deserts of<br />
North Africa. In Greece they served through frequent air raids and narrowly<br />
missed the arrival of invading German troops.<br />
In Malaya, Ceylon, Singapore, Papua, New Guinea, the Solomon Islands<br />
New Britain and Borneo many became internees and suffered terrible<br />
deprivations. Some were brutally murdered.<br />
Forty-one Australian Army nurses died in the fall of Singapore or as internees<br />
of the Japanese.<br />
From these terrible experiences emerged many stories of heroism.<br />
I think we are all familiar with the story of Sister Vivien Bullwinkel, who was<br />
the sole female survivor when nurses who endured the sinking of the Viner<br />
Brooke were put to death by the Japanese.<br />
Less well-known is the experience of the-nurses who were captured on<br />
Rabaul and, along with a number of civilians, sent to Japan. Here they were<br />
lodged in the Yokohama Rowing Club and provided with a few items of<br />
clothing and an inadequate diet.<br />
One member of the group, Sister Anderson, described their imprisonment:<br />
they worked at knitting small silk bags, making and gluing envelopes and at<br />
heavier tasks such as constructing air raid shelters, carrying bundles of<br />
firewood and clearing paths in the snow for guards to walk through in knee<br />
boots the women were barefooted. Sometimes the women became so<br />
hungry they cooked and ate the glue on the envelopes.<br />
There are other stories we should record today. In the bombing of Darwin on<br />
18 February 1942, Sister Margaret de Mestre and 11 other staff of the<br />
hospital ship Manunda were killed.<br />
Only one nurse was among the sixty-four survivors of the torpedoing of the<br />
Hospital Ship Centaur. </p>
<p>She was Sister Nell Savage who was awarded the George Cross for helping<br />
others while they floated on debris and rafts waiting for rescue.<br />
Fifty-five Australian Army Nursing Service members received decorations for<br />
their Second World War Service, including two George Medals. Eighty-two<br />
were mentioned in despatches.<br />
Many other Australian women served in medical units.<br />
Members of the Australian Army Medical Women's Service ( previously known<br />
as the Voluntary Aid Detachments) served with our Army nurses throughout<br />
Australia and in New Guinea and Borneo.<br />
Their dedication was personified by Miss May Douglas, the senior<br />
representative of the women's wartime services present here today.<br />
Originally a nursing orderly for the AIF, Miss Douglas was commissioned in<br />
1941 with the prospect that she might accompany the Army overseas.<br />
But her talents were employed in Australia where, in 1943, she was promoted<br />
to Lieutenant Colonel and appointed controller of the Australian Army Medical<br />
Women's Service.<br />
And in this capacity she travelled in Australia and New Guinea, visiting<br />
hospitals where her troops were serving.<br />
Today, I would also like to acknowledge the women of other medical units:<br />
The members of the Australian Army Physiotherapy service who<br />
served in the Middle East and the Pacific, on hospital ships and in<br />
base and forward areas.<br />
The women members of the Australian Army Medical Corps who<br />
served in military hospitals both in Australia and overseas as doctors,<br />
physiotherapists and masseuses.<br />
The women of the Royal Australian Naval Nursing Service who cared<br />
for Australian and Allied servicemen on bases throughout Australia, as<br />
well as at Milne Bay and on the Hospital Ship Manunda.<br />
And the women of the Royal Australian Air Force Nursing and Medical<br />
Service members who served not only in Australia, but also in New<br />
Guinea and in air evacuation units in Canada and the United States.<br />
Not all the women who served Australia served as nurses, of course.<br />
27,000 members of the Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force, fondly known<br />
as ' the WAAAFs', worked in 72 of 120 Air Force trades.<br />
I </p>
<p>And we might note today that they received just two-thirds or less of the male<br />
rates of pay.<br />
The WAAAF changed the role of women in wartime.<br />
The women were subject to rules which now seem at best curious.<br />
For instance, they were not supposed to serve further north than Cairns and<br />
Geraldton. Nevertheless some did serve in Darwin and the north-west of<br />
Western Australia, and in New Guinea and the Solomon Islands.<br />
They were also not supposed to fly aircraft though I am told that two women,<br />
Nell Palfreyman and Margaret Piddington were given some experience in this<br />
traditional part of air force life.<br />
In acknowledging the WAAAFs today I think it is true to say that we recognise<br />
not only the great service they rendered to the country in wartime, but the<br />
example they set for the peace the example of women's capacity and right<br />
to play a part in realms of our national life from which they had always been<br />
excluded. The same might be said of the Australian Women's Army Service, which was<br />
formed in 1941 with the same objective of releasing men for fighting units.<br />
Thousands of women rushed to enlist in what became known as the ' AWAS'<br />
by 1944 the number totalled over 24,000.<br />
Again, they were paid just two-thirds of the male rate.<br />
They were grudgingly allowed the same rank as men and provided with the<br />
same basic equipment: with one difference apparently they were allowed to<br />
have " a vase of flowers on the cupboards by their beds".<br />
In November 1944, the War Cabinet approved the posting of 500 members of<br />
AWAS to New Guinea. I do not know if the same conditions applied.<br />
When women were first admitted into the Royal Australian Navy in 1941, they<br />
were admitted under the proviso ' that there be no publicity about this break in<br />
tradition'. Over 3,000 women enlisted in the Women's Royal Australian Naval Service<br />
during the Second World War. None went to sea because it was thought<br />
inappropriate to have women on ships, but they played an extremely<br />
important role not least in the Allied Intelligence Bureau and the Coast<br />
Watching Service.<br />
Then there were the 7,000 members of the Australian Women's Land Army<br />
who, while not one of the Services, wore uniforms, were subject to discipline<br />
and learned to take orders. 77-</p>
<p>They covered the loss of 100, 000 farm workers to the defence forces.<br />
As John Curtin said, their work was hard, demanding, constant and vital to<br />
the war effort.<br />
Of course, ' Australia Remembers' honours all our veterans, including those<br />
who stayed at home and kept the country running.<br />
During the war, Australia turned to women as a vast untapped labour<br />
resource. By 1944, 250,000 women were working in Australia's factories. Over 40 per<br />
cent of munitions workers were women.<br />
Much of the work was hideously monotonous and harmful to their health.<br />
They suffered hardship and illness. But they made a huge contribution to<br />
winning the war and therefore to our freedom and the preservation of our<br />
democracy. They made a massive contribution to the story of Australia and I<br />
hope that, after today, Australians will always acknowledge this.<br />
Our own generation and generations to come should know that when liberty<br />
was threatened, Australian women rallied to defend it. No less than<br />
Australia's men, they were prepared to give their labour and their lives.<br />
We all should know what we owe them to no small extent, our freedom and<br />
our way of life, including that part of it which today makes it possible for<br />
women to share much more fully in the work and the rewards.<br />
This generation of Australian women were both pioneers and defenders of<br />
the Australian faith.<br />
And today all Australia salutes them. </p>
