    <content><![CDATA[<p>Â 8 OCTOBER 1987</p>
<p>Mr David Simmons, member for Calare ( NSW) has beenÂ appointed chairman of the Prime minister's Country TaskÂ Force. Mr Simmons was previously deputy chairman of the task force.Â He succeeds Mr Barry Cunningham, Member for McMillanÂ ( Victoria) who has takenÂ on the position of Government Whip.Â The new deputy of the task force is Mrs Wendy Fatin, MemberÂ for Brand ( WA).</p>
<p>Both Mr Simmons and Mrs Fatin have been members of the taskÂ force since I announced its formation in March 1986. DuringÂ that time the task force has fulfilled the important role ofÂ listening to, assessing, and reporting directly to me onÂ issues of importance to country people.</p>
<p>The task force is based on the Government Caucus PrimaryÂ Industry and Resources Committee, which is also chaired byÂ Mr Simmons. The task force works in close consultation withÂ the Minister for Primary industries and Energy, Mr JohnÂ Kerin, the minister for Resources, Mr Peter Morris, theÂ minister for Trade Negotiations, Mr Michael Duffy and theÂ minister for Local Government, Senator Margaret Reynolds.</p>
<p>Since its formation the task force has dealt with a wideÂ range of rural and socio-economic issues relating to people<br />living in provincial cities and towns, as well as to theÂ farm sector. These issues include small business, women's<br />affairs, education, job generation, care for the elderly,Â primary production, Aboriginal affairs, and local<br />government. The task force's objective is to provide long-term solutionsÂ to the problems facing people who live in non-metropolitan<br />Australia by meeting with a wide range of community groups,Â assessing their points of view, and reporting to me and my<br />Ministers on issues of concern.</p>
<p>Under Mr Cunningham's leadership the task force has providedÂ rural Australians with a direct link to me on issues whichÂ most affect their lives. I thank Mr Cunningham for hisÂ valuable contribution to the task force, his commitment, andÂ his understanding of ~ rural people and rural issues. I amÂ certain Mr Simmons, who represents a major rural area ofÂ NSW, will continue to provide country people with a directÂ link to my Government, and an understanding of theirÂ concerns.Â </p>
