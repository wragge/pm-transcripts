FOR PRESS: 66/ 052<br />
P. M. No. 32/ 1966<br />
KOOYONG BY-ELECTION RESULT<br />
Comment by the Prime Minister, Mr. Harold Holt<br />
The Kooyong result has given to the Federal<br />
Parliamentary Liberal Party a very able young recruit who<br />
should have a long life of fruitful parliamentary service ahead<br />
of him. His majority is considerably below that attained by<br />
Sir Robert Menzies in 1963, but it is unrealistic and misleading<br />
to attach the significance to the percentage of movement which<br />
Mr. Calwell has done. It is notorious that by-election<br />
figures tend to run against the Government of the day. In<br />
1965, Sir Robert Menzies, then at the height of his prestige<br />
as a national leader with a record tenure of office, scored<br />
his highest vote in Kooy' , ng in an election which increased the<br />
Government's majority from one to more than twenty.<br />
Another factor which undoubtedly affected the<br />
scale of movement was the fact that both the A. L. P. and the<br />
which had merely put in a token campaign against Sir<br />
Robert at earlier elections, each mounted a most vigorous and<br />
thorough campaign on this occasion,. Each saw in the by-election<br />
an opportunity to score tactical political gains and campaigned<br />
accordingly. In the circumstances, whatever he may say<br />
publicly, privately Mr. Caiwell can take little comfort from the<br />
result. The D. L. P. vote has increased by approximately the<br />
same proportion of the total as the A. L. P. vote.<br />
The A. L. P. attempted to convert the Kooyong by-election<br />
into a national forum on the issues of South Viet Ram and the<br />
National Service scheme. In the result, the combined vote for<br />
parties supporting the Government's policies on both these issues<br />
has been nearly two-and-a-half times that secured by the A. IL. P.<br />
CANBERRA, 4th April, 1966. </p>
