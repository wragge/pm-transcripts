GOULBURN ADDRESS MONDAY 8 DECEMBER, 1975<br />
IN THIS ELECTION CAMPAIGN, THE LIBERAL AND NATIONAL<br />
COUNTRY PARTIES HAVE PUT FORWARD POSITIVE AND<br />
CONSTRUCTIVE POLICIES WHICH COME TO GRIPS WITH THE<br />
PROBLEMS FACING AUSTRALIA.<br />
THE A. L. P. HAS NOT OFFERED ONE CONSTRUCTIVE SUGGESTION<br />
ONil THESE PROBLEMS,<br />
THE CLOSEST MR. WHITLAM CAME TO CONSTRUCTIVE POLICIES<br />
WAS WHEN HE HELP UP A COPY OF OUR POLICIES EVEN<br />
THEN HE HELD THEM AT ARM'S LENGTH,<br />
IN THE FIRST WEEK OF THE CAMPAIGN, MR. WHITLAM<br />
SAID HE WAS GOING TO STAND ON. HIS RECORD THE<br />
ONLY PROBLEM WAS, WHICH RECORD WAS HE GOING TO STAND<br />
ON RECORD INFLATION, RECORD INDUSTRIAL STRIFE,<br />
OR RECORD UNEMPLOYMENT. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
BUT PERHAPS WE ARE EXAGGERATING MR. WHITLAM'S<br />
FAILURE TO DEAL WITH THE UNEMPLOYMENT PROBLEMI<br />
THOUGH HE COULDN'T FIND A JOB FOR 400,000 AUSTRALIANS,<br />
HE CERTAINLY SUCCEEDED IN FINDING A JOB FOR HIS SON,<br />
LABOR'S INCOMPETENCE LEAVES MORE THAN ENOUGH<br />
SCOPE FOR JOKES ABOUT MR. WHITLAM AND HIS MINISTRY<br />
OF SACKED MEN LABOR'S SAD SACKS,<br />
BUT TODAY, WE MUST TALK SERIOUSLY ABOUT THE TYPE<br />
OF AUSTRALIA WE WANT.<br />
ON DECEMBER 13, YOU WILL BE DECIDING THE FUTURE<br />
OF AUSTRALIA.<br />
YOU WILL DECIDE WHAT KIND OF COUNTRY YOU WANT<br />
FOR YOUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN </p>
<p>DO YOU WANT A SOCIALIST-AUSTRALIA?<br />
DOMINATED BY BIG-GOVERNMENT; BIG BUREAUCRACY,<br />
BY FORMS, RED TAPE; REGULATIONS AN4D CONTROLS?<br />
DO YOU WANT AUSTRALIA RUINED BY SOCIALIST<br />
I NCOMPETENCE?<br />
OR DO YOU WANT AUSTRALIA TO BE FREE, DEMOCRATIC<br />
AND PROSPEROUS?<br />
OUR WAY OF LIFE HAS BEEN BUILT BY PEOPLE FROM<br />
ALMOST EVERY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD.<br />
YOU OR YOUR PARENTS OR YOUR GRANDPARENTS CAME<br />
TO AUSTRALIA BECAUSE IT WAS A NEW COUNTRY<br />
A FREE COUNTRY WHEN MEN AND WOMEN COULD DECIDE<br />
FOR THEMSELVES HO' 14. T-HEY WIANTED TO LIVE THEIR LIVES-. </p>
<p>PEOPLE HAVE COME TO AUSTRALIA BECAUSE IT IS<br />
A LAND OF OPPORIUITY--A LAND FREE FROM THE<br />
FEARS, THE WARS OF OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD.<br />
THE MOST ENTERPRISING, THE MOST ADVENTUROUS<br />
THE MOST FAR-SIGHTED FROM OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE<br />
MADE THE LONG JOURNEY TO AUSTRALIA.<br />
TOGETHER ALL OF YOU HERE OUR PARENTS AND<br />
OUR GRANDPARENTS HAVE BUILT A COUNTRY TO BE<br />
PROUD OF<br />
AUSTRALIANS CAN HOLD THEIR HEADS UP ANYWHERE<br />
IN THE WORLD FOR THEIR ACHIEVEMENTS.<br />
IiN SPORT<br />
IN MEDICAL RESEARCH<br />
IiN THE ARTS, MUSIC, PAINTING, WRITING<br />
IN THE GREAT ENTERPRISE AND VISION<br />
IT HAS TAKEN TO BUILD AUSTRALIA </p>
<p>t4<br />
BUT OUR PROUDEST ACHIEVEMENT AS A PEOPLE IS THAT<br />
WE HAVE BUILT A COUNTRY WHICH CAN GUARANTEE A DECENT<br />
LIFE FOR ALL AUSTRALIANS RICH AND POOR, IN THE<br />
CITIES AND IN THE COUNTRY, OLD AND NEW<br />
NO OTHER COUNTRY CAN OFFER THE OPPORTUNITY, THE<br />
SOCIAL EQUALITY, THE TOLERANCE, THE FREEDOM, THE<br />
CONCERN FOR ONE'S FELLOWMAN, THE GOOD LIFE<br />
THAT AUSTRALIANS CAN ENJOY,<br />
NO OTHER COUNTRY HAS THE OPPORTUNITY THAT WE HAVE<br />
TO BE AN EXAMPLE TO THE WORLD OF WHAT FREE PEOPLE<br />
CAN DO.<br />
WE HAVE ACHIEVED THE BEST. BECAUSE WE HAVE<br />
ENCOURAGED THE BEST-BY ENCOURAGING THE BEST<br />
EFFORTS OF ALL WE tAN PROVIDE THE BEST LIFE<br />
TO ALL<br />
THIS IS THE AUSTRALIAN WAY </p>
<p>THE IDEALS WE ALL SHARE BUILD ON THE BEST<br />
ELEMENTS OF THE AUSTRALIAN WAY<br />
WE WANT EQUAL EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES<br />
FOR ALL<br />
WE WANT-TO ASSIST OTHE VERY BEST OF<br />
OUR ABILITY THE DISADVANTAGED AND<br />
THOSE IN NEED<br />
WE WANT TO PROVIDE ALL AUSTRALIANS WITH A<br />
BASIC LEVEL OF SECURITY BELOW WHICH NO-ONE CAN<br />
INVOLUNTARILY FALL<br />
* WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT ALL AUSTRALIANS<br />
CAN FIND A JOB -AND A SATISFYING JOB<br />
aw./ WE WANT TO ENCOURAGE THE DIFFERENT TALENTS<br />
THAT PEOPLE HAVE -AND TO BE TOLERANT OF<br />
DIFFERENCES </p>
<p>WE WANT TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO COMPETE<br />
TO DO BETTER TO IMPROVE THEIR OWN<br />
PERFORMANCE WE WANT TO ENCOURAGE AN APPRECIATION<br />
AND ADMIRATION OF ACHIEVEMENT SO THAT WE CANJ<br />
BUILD A GREAT AUSTRALIA<br />
WE WANT FREEDOM SO THAT PEOPLE CAN CONTROL<br />
THEIR OWN LIVES, MAKE THEIR OWN DECISIONS,<br />
FREEDOM FROM DICTATION AND DOMINATION BY<br />
POLITICIANS AND CIVIL SERVANTS.<br />
WE WANT AN AUSTRALIA BASED ON MUTUAL RESPECT<br />
BETWEEN ALL PEOPLE AN AUSTRALIA WHERE<br />
PEOPLE CAN RECOGNISE AND WORK TOGETHER IN<br />
THE COMMON INTEREST<br />
THAT IS THE KIND OF AUSTRALIA WE WANT </p>
<p>-6<br />
I BELIEVE THAT IS THE KIND OF AUSTRALIA YOU WANT<br />
THAT IS NOT THE KIND OF AUSTRALIA WE HAVE BEEN<br />
GETTING FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS<br />
FOR-THE LAST THREE YEARS THE LABOR PARTY HAS BEEN<br />
WRECKING AUSTRALIA IN ITS EFFORTS TO IMPOSE<br />
GREATER ANID GREATER GOVERNMENT CONTROL OVER EVERY<br />
ASPECT OF OUR LIVES<br />
MORE AND MORE GOVERNMEIIT SPENDING AND<br />
EXTRAVAGANCE HIGHER AND HIGHER TAXES<br />
MORE AND MORE BUREAUCRACY, REGULATIONS<br />
AND CONTROLS<br />
HAVE ALL DONE IMMENSE DAMAGE TO AUSTRALIA -MUCH<br />
GREATER DAMAGE THAN MANY PEOPLE REALISE </p>
<p>-7-<br />
BECAUSE INCOME TAX COLLECTED HAS GONE UP<br />
2 TIMES MOST OF AUSTRALIA'S FAMILIES FIND<br />
IT INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT TO MEET THEIR<br />
OWN NEEDS AS THEY SEE FIT<br />
NO WONDER PEOPLE ARE STRUGGLING TO MAKE ENDS<br />
MEET, AS A RESULT OF LABOR'S TAXES YOU HAVE TO WORK<br />
AN EXTRA MONTH A YEAR JUST TO PAY THE<br />
GOVERNMENTS BILLS<br />
WE WILL PUT AN END TO EXTRAVAGANCE AND WASTE<br />
LABOR'STAXES HAVE WIPED OUTTENS OF THOUSANDS<br />
OF-JOBS-IN PRIVATE ENTERPRISE<br />
THE MONEY THAT SHOULD HAVE GONE INTO<br />
BUILDING-FACTORIES, BUYING MACHINES,<br />
PROVIDING JOBS-HAS BEEN PAID IN TAXES TO<br />
THE GOVERNMENT </p>
<p>-8-<br />
UNDER LABOR AN AVERAGE OF 207 JOBS HAVE<br />
BEEN LOST EVERY DAY FOR THREE YEARS<br />
ONE JOB EVERY SEVEN MINUTES<br />
IT TOOK MR WHITLAM TO EXPORT OVERSEAS<br />
THE JOBS OF SO MANY THOUSANDS OF AUSTRALIANS<br />
ONLY GOUGH COULD DO IT,<br />
SOME ACHIEVEMENT, SOME RECORD?<br />
WE WILL RESTORE INCENTIVES AND GET AUSTRALIA<br />
MOVING AGAIN.<br />
LABOR'S TAXES, LABOR'S SOCIALISM<br />
FORCED UP PRICES.<br />
GAVE US THE WORST PERIOD OF RISING PRICES,<br />
THE HIGHEST INTEREST RATES IN AUSTRALIA'S<br />
HISTORY.<br />
MR-WHITLAM SAYS LABOR HAS LIVING-POLICIES<br />
HIS POLICIES MAY BE LIVING BUT THEY'RE KILLING<br />
AUSTRALIA. </p>
<p>-9-<br />
ON TOP OF ALL THIS WE HAVE HAD THREE YEARS OF<br />
A GOVERNMENT WHICH HAS DEGRADED THE STANDARDS OF<br />
PUBLIC LIFE<br />
NEVER BEFORE HAVE TWO MEN WHO WERE ACTING<br />
P. M. BEEN SACKED FOR DECEIVING THE PARLIAMENT<br />
NEVER BEFORE HAS A P. M. HAD TO BE SACKED<br />
BECAUSE HE TRIED TO GOVERN WITHOUT PARLIAMENT<br />
BECAUSE HE WAS PREPARED TO DAMAGE AUSTRALIA<br />
RATHER THAN FACE HIS MASTERS AND OURS<br />
THE PEOPLE<br />
AUSTRALIA CAN'T STAND THREE MORE YEARS OF THIS<br />
KIND OF GOVERNMENT<br />
