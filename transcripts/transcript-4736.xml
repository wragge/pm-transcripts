INTERVIEW4 AT CANBERRA AIRPORT<br />
PAUL DAVEY: Prime Minister, welcome back to Australia. Can<br />
you give us a couple of words as to how you think the trip<br />
went? PRIME MINISTER:-I believe it went very well. Australia's<br />
view is now certainly understood where it has not been<br />
understood before and the main element of what I was involved<br />
in of course, in the Multilateral Trade Negotiations, which are<br />
going to mean a great deal for all Australians whether we move<br />
forward into: a more sensible trading world or whether we go<br />
back to the discriminatory trading practices of older times.<br />
There are mixed views in Europe about what ought to happen.<br />
There are some very disturbing signs because one of the things<br />
that has stood by small countries, middle-ranking countries,<br />
developing countries, over the years has been the most favoured<br />
nation principle. If you make a trade rule or a restriction<br />
) it's got to apply to all comers and that has so far stopped you<br />
picking out a particular country and saying " your exports are<br />
damaging me, we won't have any more of your exports". Well now,<br />
in Europe there is a very strong move to try and do away with<br />
the most favoured nation principle which means treating all<br />
nations alike and establishing the circumstances in which a<br />
country which might be Britain, it might be France or it might<br />
be another country, can say a certain country's exports<br />
are damaging this industry, we are going to stop that country's<br />
exports to this country and this seems to me to be aimed at<br />
the heart of efficient producers and at the heart of the newly<br />
emerging countries, developing countries, as they -get to the<br />
stage of industrial take-off and it's a very dangerous principle<br />
which does give Australia a good deal of cause for concern.<br />
QUESTION: Are you confident, Prime Minister, that Australia's<br />
agricultural products will get into the EEC on a reasonable<br />
trading basis with them?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I'm confident we've got a better prospect of<br />
that happening than we have ever had. But at the same time<br />
I don't under-estimate the strength of Europe in pursuing its<br />
own interests. The United States has said there will be no<br />
trade agreement unless agriculture is included and that is<br />
precisely our position. Mr. Jenkins, as President of the<br />
Commission, said that he knows quite well in the agriculture<br />
area if the arrangements that are made don't give us a<br />
realistic opportunity of selling beef, for example, into the<br />
European market, then the arrangements are worthless so far<br />
as Australia is concerned and at least that recognition was<br />
an advance over previous attitudes. / 2<br />

QUESTION: Sir, there has been some speculation back here<br />
in Australia that you might have to use uranium as a lever<br />
to get into the EEC. Is that on, from your point of view?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Oh, there's been a great deal of speculation,<br />
but I don't wantE to add to it.<br />
QUESTION: Prime Minister, if I could just put one final<br />
point. You seem fromyorn Asian leg of your trip to have<br />
had quite considerable amount of success on the trade level<br />
with the Asian countries. Do you think maybe Australia is<br />
pushing too hard to get into the EEC. Is it maybe time that we<br />
should start concentrating on the Asian area rather more?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: We have been concentrating on the Asian theatre<br />
and our trade with Asian countries, obviously with Japan, but<br />
with Korea, with the ASEAN~ countries, both ways , has been growing<br />
very greatly. Now, I've got no doubt at all it will continue<br />
to grow. But what we need to understand is that certain<br />
Australian industries do need access to the highly affluent<br />
markets of Europe for their own well-being. This is the richest,<br />
the most powerful and technologically advanced trade bloc the<br />
world has ever seen about 260 million people and it's in that<br />
market that we're up against non-tariff barriers that have<br />
really denied us the possibility of any sort of reasonable trade.<br />
We haven't been up against barriers in the Asian theatre. After<br />
I became Prime Minister one of the first visits I made was to<br />
Japan, to China, and throughout my political life I've travelled<br />
extensively in Southeast Asia. I've got no doubt I will continue<br />
to do so.<br />
QUESTION: In a nutshell then, the Common Market is a must for<br />
Australia? PRIME MINISTER: If any area is saying to us we are going to<br />
establish arrangements that won't allow your goods to compete,<br />
we've got to take that very seriously. It's not a policy that<br />
was introduced many years ago, it's a continuing one. They are<br />
now talking about a sheep meat regime that would do enormous<br />
damage to New Zealand--really do to New Zealand what they have<br />
done to us in beef. and New Zealand's economy is not so diverse<br />
or flexible as ours. A year ago they bought in a wine regime.<br />
Now this was technically not a tariff barrier, it technically<br />
wasn't a barrier at all, but they established requirements<br />
at their frontiers that have halved Australia' s very useful<br />
wine trade into Europe. If we in our turn, established the same<br />
kind of regime on our borders, Europe would lose upwards of<br />
ten to twelve million dollars worth of wine trade with Australia<br />
each year. We believe that's the wrong sort of way of conducting<br />
trade and trade negotiations, but I'm making the point to show<br />
that their policies march on and what happened with wine is an<br />
additional example and a recent example of the way in which<br />
Australian commodities have been and are being excluded.<br />
