    <content><![CDATA[<p>4, &gt; AUSTRAI 4<br />PR-ME~ RINESTIER<br />7 EX TALKBACK, LAUNCESTON, TASMANIA LEON RYNER WITHTHE PRIME MIN~ ISTERc<br />9.30 AM 23.10.84<br />BYNER: HAVE YOU HAD TIM[ YET TO CONSIDER WHETHER OR NOT YOU WILL<br />DEBATE WITH ANDREW PEACOCK5 MAYBE THE 22ND or NOVEMBE. R?<br />HAWKE; I THINK THE TIMING IS STILL A MATTER-OF DISCUSSION.<br />THAT WE'RE QUITE HAPPY TO HAVE THE DEBATE. WE THIN~ K WHAT IT'S HAVE A TELEVISION<br />WE'VE SAID,*: LEON, IS<br />PR~ OBABLY BETTO BE<br />DONE AT THE NATIONAL PRESS CLUB IN CANBERRA AND I THINK REALLY THE . NATIONAL<br />PRESS CLUB OUGHT TO HAVE ITS VIEWS EXPRESSED TO US. WE'LL HAVE OUR BIT OF AN<br />INPUT AS TO WHAT WE THINK's APPROPRIATE. BUT I JUST AM QUITE HAPPY TO'HAVE<br />THE DEBATE. I MEAN, I DEBATE THE CHAP IN PARLIAMENT REGULAPZLY, AND EVERYONE<br />KNOWS THE RESULT.<br />BYN ER:<br />WE ARE A WEEK INTO THE CAMPAIGN. THE STYLE OF THE OPPOSITION LEADEIR IS<br />STARTING TO COME THROUGH, THE WAYi HE IHiTENDS TO PORTRAY HIIMSELF', PftESl'NT H23<br />POLICIES, THE REPETITION OF WEALTH TAX, CAPITAL GAINS, DEATH DUTIE. S. rOW,<br />APART FROM A SENSE OF DEJA VU, THIS SORT OF -rmING HAS WORKED BEFORE', IIASN'T<br />IT? HAWKE; WELL, I DON'T THINK YOU CAN DRAW COM4PARISONS EASILY, BETWEEN 1984 ANID EARLIER<br />TIMES. THE BASIC REASON FOR THAT, LEON, IS THAT YOU'VE HAD A LADOR GOX'ERNi'Elff<br />IN OFFICE NOW SINCE THE BEGINNING OF ' 83 AND IT HAS PRODUCED A RESULT, AND THE<br />PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO MAK( E JUDGEMENTS ON FACTS. YOU SEE, TH. E PROBLEN I1JITH THE<br />OPPOSITION ALWAYS, AND PARTICULARLY WITH THIS LEADER OF THE OPPOSIT10%' IS HE<br />TREATS THE AUSTRALIAN ELECTORATE As FOOLS. LET tIE BE PRECISE. ALL IIE EARD<br />FROM THE LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION FOR MONTHS WAS ORGANISED CRIME INM GENERALD<br />AND ATTACKS ON MY CHARACTER IN PARTICULAR. NOW TO 0O THAT* ITWA A<br />ABSURDITY TO SUGGEST THAT I IJAS A CROOK, THAT I'D BE PROTECTINUG2 ORG ANISED<br />CRIME, WAS MANIFESTLY ABSURD, AND IT INVOLVED A-JUDGEMENT ON THE PART ' OF THE<br />LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION THAT THE PEOPLE OF AUSTRALIA POULD BUY THA~ T SCRT OF<br />NONSENSE. HIS CREDIBILITY WAS 0O" THE LINE AND'Tfll'/' V E K. DE THEIR'~ UThI<br />ABOUT HIM, AND IT'S QUITE CLEAR WHAT THEY SAY ABJOUT HIM. VNW CRJID-1BLITV X'S<br />AT THF HFART OF TT ARATN, AND 11F'S TRlYING TO INSTIL FEAR INTO PEOPLE, TDSAY<br />LOYOu CAN'T TRUST THIS G0Vr. RH14, NT. NO.-I, I THINNK THE PEOPLE AnW su1.<br />SAYING, UILLL LOOK UVE SAW YOU FOR SEVEH YCARS, YOU HAD ' ZVEN VimsR I Onfl<br />POLICY, FOR ECONOMIIC POLICY.

SE OF A QuAK ILK U A MILLION IN UNEMPLOYMENT IN TOIE. J. AST<br />TWELVE MONTHS WITH YOU MOS. NOW THESE ARr THE THINGS THAT ARE IN VHgjR MINDS<br />AND I DON'T THINK YOU CAN TALK ABOUT THE PAST BEFORE WE WERE IN GOVIEi rJM; NT.<br />PEOPLE MAKE THEIR JUDIWNENTS, LEON ON THE FACTS.<br />SYNFR:<br />AS YOU KNOW, TASMANIA I$ A VERY PAROCHIAL STATE. AND V'M-WONDERIN0 WHETHER<br />YOU'RE SURPRISED AT Ml( kACOCK'S ACQUIESCENCE TO THE REQUEST FROM AU. ST'RAL IA S<br />ONLY LIBERAL PREMIER ON THE DAN ISSUE.<br />H-AWKE:<br />14FII TO SAY I'M SURPRISED IS UNDERSTATING IT, LEON. BECAUSE IS 00NO1UR<br />QUESTION OF THE CRFDIRTITY1 01 MR PLACOCK AND THE LIBERALS. EARLI~ qR T<br />YEAR, ON THE 31ST OF MAY, THE OPPOSITION SPOKESMIAN, MR CONINOLLY. L OTE ' TO THE<br />WILDERNESS SOCIETY, AND LCT IT BE KNOWN THAT THE POS17110N OF THE OP PO~ jITIoij<br />WAS THAT THE DAM ISSUE WAS DEAD. HE SAID IT'S OVE. R, WE EXPECT THE TASMANIAN<br />GOVERNMENT AND COMMONWEALTH GOVERNNFNT TO ADIIEREC TOIT-COMPENSATi9N1. S BEEN<br />PAID, IT'S FIXED. AND MR PEACOCK CAME DOWN HERE AND ONE (. NDERSTOOD TqAT THAT<br />WAS HIS POSITION WHEN HIE CAMC DOW4N HLRL. BUT HE RESPONDED TO M; R GRAY'. S<br />SUGGESTION THAT IT COULD STILL 6L ALIVE. NOW4 THAT IS SOMETHING THAT t CELIEVE<br />THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF TASMANIANS DON'T WANT, EVEN THOSE WHO PJERE<br />PREVIOUSLY IN FAVOUR OF THE DAM. THEY ACCEPT WHAT MR GRAY SAID ONl ITHE .6TH OF<br />JUNE OF THIS YEAR, THIAT MR HIAWK( E HAS KEPT HIS PROIMISES IN REGARD To'J035R<br />IN REGARD TO FUTURE PONFR REQUIREMENTS. NOW, L'OR5E THJAN RAISING Ii AGAIN, 14F<br />SAID# WELL WE WANT TO KEEP 11' ALIVt ANI) WL WON'T GIVE YOU BACK [ 401FY 3F. AT'S<br />BEEN PAID UNDER THE AGREEMENT, IF W4E TRY AND RESURRECT THE DAM. Nol. I .1TfthIN<br />THAT ORDINARY TASMANIANS, AS ORDINARY AUSTRALIANS SAY IF A DEAL IS. DONED<br />AND PARTICULARLY IF" MOINEY'S PAID UNDER A DEAL, THIN MY HONOUR ANiD INTECRITY'S<br />ON THE LINE. THAT'S WHAT THE ORDINARY AUSTRALIAN SAYS, AND I THIF K T11EV WILL<br />BE REPULSED BY THIS WELCHINC.<br />BYNER: PRIME MINISTER, THOSE EMPLOYMENT PROPOSALS YOU PUT FORWARD UNDER THE: C0.1" PENSATION<br />AGREEMENT, LIKE ABC TELEVISIONv CO~ tO* EALTlI BUILDINGS0 SURELY YOU CAN* SEE<br />MR GRAY'S POINT THAT TH-1EY'RE HARDLY STATE RFSPONSIBILIT.

<p>HAWKE: LOOK THE ARRANGEMENT IS QUITE CLEAR, AND I TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY OF C LARIFYING<br />THEE WAY A COUPLE OF MY REMARKS WERE INTERPRETED YESTERDAYs IN REGARD ~ 1O THE<br />WYNYARD AIRPORT. I SAID, HERE'S MR GRAY PUTTING UP OUR MONEY IN RESPECT OF THE<br />PROPOSAL. N~ IJST SHOULD ELABORATF ON THAT, UNDER THE ARRANGEMENT5THAT HE<br />WILLINGLY ENTERED INTO BETWEEN OURSELVES AND THE TASMANIAN GOVERNMENT, IQ GRAY,<br />WIE SAID TO FINALISE THE EMPLOYMENT GENERATION PART OF OUR UNDERTAKING, IT WAS<br />MILLION. THAT WAS COMMONWEALTH MONEY UNDER AND THAT'S THESEN.$ E I<br />WIAS REFERRING TO OUR MONEY, BUT THE ARRANGEMENT WAS THAT HOW THAT tmN0E 1AS<br />SPENT WOULD BE A MATTER OF AGREEMENT BETWEEN MR GRAY, TH -E TASMANIAN tOVERNm1ENT<br />AND MYSELF, THE COMVMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT. NOW WH11EN I SAY OUR MON4EYO I uAS<br />SIMPLY SAVING IT'S THE COMMONWEALTH'S MONEY THAT'S BEING PROVIDED BUT IT'S A<br />JOINT DECISION AS TO HOLI IT SHOULD BE USED. NOW PICKING UP YOUR SPEC. IFIC,<br />POINT, MR GRAY PUT UP CERTAIN PROPOSALS, AS HE WAS ENTITLED TO, AND W-E'VE PUT<br />UP CERTAIN PROPOSALS. NOll IF IIE CAN'T GET ORIG3INAL AGREEMENT, HELL TwENl UEVEv<br />JUST GOT TO HAVE FURTHER NEGOTIATION AND IT ILL BE WORKED OUT. NOUl, wou<br />POINTS A6OUT IT, ONE OF GENERAL INTEREST TO TAS5WxNIANS AS A WIHOLE, AND ONE<br />OF VERY PARTICULAR INTEREST TO THE PEOPLE OF LAUNCESTON. 11HERE TI1EW9' 3EEN<br />REFERENCE TO A ULRTAIN W-ORKS PROGRAM, tVLIICH ATTACKS JUST SAY ABC TELEVXSION9<br />ALL lHIAI' WA5 SAID THCRE IS THlAT TH4ESE PP.

IT WOULD rE 30OM-ICTINC TIII\ T COULD PPOVIDE IJORq HtZEDIATELY P2D<br />COULD BE OF IflIIEDIATE ASSISTANCE, WELL 1,11N OMINATED THEM9 BUT AS F0R AS<br />LAUNCESTON 0 LONCERNED, WHAT RR GRAY IS KNOCKING BACK, AND) THhll USv<br />IS THAT WE PUT UP $ 4 MILLION FOR UPGRADING THE SEWERAGiE SYSTEM IN LAUNCESTON.<br />NOVW THE PEOPLE OF LAUNCESTON HAVE BEEN TO US,, THROUGH 1-2 UREN 11E'VE SENT<br />ENGINEERS DOWN HERE TO STUDY THIS SYSTEM. WE KNOW IT'S A REAL PROUL~ t-ECECAUSE<br />OF ITS OUTDATED SYSTEM IN OPERATION AND WE'VE BEEN PREPARED TO M'AIKE $ 4 MILLION<br />AVAILABLE. CYN ER:<br />BUT THAT UAS ACTUALLY PART OF itlE ( 0MPENSATION FUND?<br />I IAUKE:<br />THIS IS $ 4 MILLION OUT OF THE $ 15 MILLION FORt EMIPLOYMENT PROJECTS. UE . lILL<br />SAY OK HERE'S $ 4 MILLION, UNDER THAT SCHEME, SO WE CAN GET GOIN4G WME"'. DIATELY<br />ON THE SEWERAGE PROBBLEr1S IN4 LAUNCESTON.<br />BYNER: WHAT ROSIN GRAY IS SAYING, I THIN"(, PRIME 14IN) STER0 IS THAT UIE SlOCUILD 11j'E<br />GOT 11HAT $ 4 11ILLION OUTSIDE THE $ 15 MILLION, BlECAUSE YOU SWOULD Mh CEIT</p>
<p>4.<br />ANYWAY. HAWKE: BUT EVERY PREMIER AROUND AUSTRALIA IS SAYING IN RESPECT OF THEIR Ot) N AREAS<br />OF RESPONSIBILITY. AFTER ALL SEWERAGE. IS* A STATE HATTER. NOT SOAETH NG<br />THE COMMONWEALTH DOESN'T ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY FOR SEWERAGE ALL ROQND.<br />AUSTRALIA. EVERYONE KNOWS THAT. BUT WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS ALRIGHT! HERE IS<br />A REAL PROBLEM IN LAUNCESTON. WE'VE SENT ENGINEERS DOWN HERE TO MA~ KE THEM<br />AVAILABLE UNDER MR UREN'S DEPARTMENT, TERRITORIES AND LOCAL GOVERK'iENT, AND<br />THE PEOPLE OF LAUNCESTON AT THE COUNCIL WERE RESPONSIVE TO THAT, SO t-E'RE<br />WiANTINI TO FOLLOW THAT UP 11,11MEDIATELY, WE'RE SAYING LOOK WERE'S TH4 MONEY<br />THAT'S AVAILABLE, LET'S USE $ 4 OF THAT. NOW I WOULD THINK THAT THE PEOPLE OF<br />IAIIN( 1' iIfN Akl NOT GiOrIG TO BF TOO PLEASED ABOUT N1~ GRAY SAYXN6 NO'HE.

I WENT OVER THERE VERY EARILY IN THE P. IECE; TT HAS<br />AiLL t UK. I I UP I UUzlzr) I I UlI) I of-miI mI nr i itinn ri r, in if nol im i i nhA ul'i<br />0016 T~ O HAPPEN TO ME. BUT I GOT A ui: DV 11ADN nrrPrPTlnP rONo TlIr PEOPLE OVER<br />THERE. I GOT SUCH A WARM RECEP'lIUN ItiAt 11 LL. U MK L2UOULUCK TO SAY, Aki ISN'T<br />Tlli nElqAR( Al) L[, IT LED " n COODLUCK TO . flYj jlp nsflUmofl TA) BEi A TASIMNI( AN<br />I HOPE THE PEOPLE OF TASMANIA REMEMBER THAT AB~ OUT MR GOODLUCK. HE WAS SO<br />INCENSElU IHAM THE PRIME MINISTER OF AUSTRALIA GOY A GOOD RECEPTION IN<br />TASMANIA THAT HE SAID HE WAS AfSHAMED TO 0E A TAS) MANIAN. NOW THAT WAS THE<br />REACTION I GOT. I WENT OVER THERE AND WE HAVE PUT A LOT OF' NONEY iNTO THE<br />VJEST COAST OF TASMANIA ALREADY. INCLUDING STRAHAN AND OTHER PLACESt AN<br />THERE'S BEEN TOTAL AGREEMENT. I JUST ASK LISYENERS TO REMEMBER THAT ONl THE<br />26TH OF JUNE WHEN WE SIGNED THE AGREEtiElfT, FIR GRAY SAID UNEQU XVOCALLY 1THAT<br />HR HAWKE HAD HONOURED HIS PROMISES AND HIS UNDERTAKING. YOU SEE, f4E'S<br />GETTING INTO AN ELECTORAL SITUATION N131H. AND ALTHOUGH HE'S tO GOOD* Fft* IEND CIF<br />fR PEACOC( K%, AS WE ALL K11O11, TEERE'S A CERTAIN, I mEAN * THEY'RE G0TH' LIBI'RALS<br />AND SO HE'S COT TO PLAY A BIT Orr POLITICS. DIJT THE PEOPLE OF TASf. UIIA WILL<br />SEE THROUGH THAT. / BYNER: U1HILST UE'RE TALKIN</p>
<p>BYNER: WHILST WE'RE TALKING ON THE WEST COAST, WHAT'S YOUR REACTION TO Ttd! E<br />PROBABLE CLOSURE OF MT LYELL MINE?<br />HAWKE:<br />WELL I NOTICED THE STATEMENT OF CONCERN BY THE RENISON GOLDFIELD, CORPORLATION<br />WHO RUN THE COMPANY. ALL I CAN SAY IS, AS OF COMING HERE TO TASfARIA, HE<br />HAVE RECEIVED NO COMI4UNICATION FROM THE COMPANY OR THE STATE GOVEFIN1, MENT ABOUT<br />THIS, SO THEY HAVEN'T BEEN -INTO UCH WITH US ABOUT IT AT ALL. IF TH* EY( SHOULD<br />BE IN TOUCH WITH US, WELL OF COURSE WEILL LOOK AT WHAT THEY'VE GOT TO SAY.<br />I EXPRESS MY DEEP CONCERN THAT THERE MAY BE THIS PROBLEMs AN4D I THINKTNERE'S<br />SOME 640 PEOPLE EMPLOYED AT THE MINE, THE BASIC PROBLEM AS THE CONPANY HAS<br />INDICATED IS A LOW AND CONTINUING LOU WORLDl PRICE FOR COPPER. I'V E REC: ENTLY<br />BEEN HAVING DISCUSSIONS WITH PEOPLE IN THE INDUSTRY AND ON THE-i-IMLAND<br />MT ISA MINES PEOPLE WERE TALKING TO US AT SOME LENGTH AND THEY 1ERE SAYING<br />58/ Al IHL R/ AIHLR UNUSUAL FEATURE OF THE W4ORLD PATTERN AT THE HiOMENT, THAT IS<br />THAT THERE'S BEEN A LIFT IN WORLD ACTIVITY AND DEMAND, BUT BECAUSE OF, THE<br />VERY CONSIDERABLE ACCUMULATED STOCK ON THE WORLD t1AR1K" ETo THAT THEY NME THE<br />JUDGEMENT THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE A FURTHER RUNDOtIN OF STOCKS TO ABUUT. 3OO,, OO<br />TONS FURTHER, BEFORE YOU'LL SEE THE IMPACT OF INCREASING DEMAND rf.<br />REFLECTED [ N HIGHER PRICES. NOW I EXPRESS THE HOPE THAT RENISOI GOLD MAY<br />TAKE THE SAME VIEW THAT WITHIN A RELATIVELY SHORT PERIOD THERE uILL g~ AN4<br />UPLIFT IN WORLD PRICES AND THAT THEY 14ILL BE PREPARED TO CARlRY ON PN THAT<br />BASIS. I MEAN OBVIOUSLY NO COMPANY CAN BE EXPECTED TO CARRY ON FOEVER<br />CARRYING SIGNIFICANT LOSSES, BUT I WOULD SUGGEST TO THEM, ON-THE EV<br />AVAILABLE TO MiE THAT THERE IS SOME REASON FOR OPTIMISM IN THE NOT TOO DISTAINT<br />FUTURE AND I HOPE THAI GIVEN THE DEDICATED SERVICE OF THE EMPLOY'ES OF THE<br />COMPANY OVER MANY YEARS, THAT THEY'LL TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT.<br />BYNER: PRIME MINISTER.-THE FREIGHT EQUALISATION RATES H1AVEN'T BEEN ALTERIP SlfNOE<br />YOUR GOVERNIMENT'S. ENTIRE TERM SO FAR. I KNOW THERE IS AN INQUIRY b'. c AT THE<br />MOMENT TO DETERMINE THE WHOLE SITUATION RE THE FREIGH4T EQUALISATION SCHEME-.<br />THERE ARE A LOT 01F PEOPLE WHO ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE E ODED'VALUE PF ' THE<br />AMOUNT WHICH THE FEDERAL GOVERNiMENT IS ACTUALLY PUTTING INTO THE SCHEK. E.<br />W1OULD YOU LIKE TO MAKE ANY COMIM-ENT?<br />HAWKE: I CERTAINLY UOULD. WEIVE PROVIDED $ 29.3 MILLION THIS FIfiANCIAL VE( ' 1 FOR<br />THE TASI-ANIAN FREIGHT EQUALISATION ScHEME AND IF YOU LOO', AT ALL AT.' tlR E<br />PROVIDING IN RESPECT OF TRANSPORT,, T14E FEDERAL GOVERN'MENT IS PROV6I11* G iWOUI<br />2,2 MILLION A WEEK TO YASMANIA'S TRANSPORT NEEDS. THAT'S 1mADE lip<br />A/ lKLLI0' 3 Fq-</p>
<p>6.<br />MILLION FOR THE FREIGHT EQUALISATION SCHEME, THERE'$ $ 51 MILLION FQR ROAD.<br />FUNDING THIS FINANCIAL YEAR, AND THAT'S A 42% RISE SINCE 82-831 TH YEAJ<br />BEFORE WE CAME INTO OFFICE. HISTORICALLY HIGH INCREASE BY THIS GOV CRNM[ NT<br />IN ROAD FINDING. WE'VE PROVIDED $ 18.1 MILLION TO THE AUSTRALIAN I ATIONAL<br />RAILWAYS COMRMISSION TO SUBSIDISE THE OPERATING LOSSES OF THE TASWAI1N.<br />RAILWAY SYSTEM, AND $ 3 MILION TO HELP THE REHABILITATION* OF THE TA'SM)' AN<br />RAILW-AY* SYSTEM AND $ 5.6 MILLION TO PROVIDE AIR FARE SUBSIDIES BETWqEIN. ThE<br />MAIN TASMANIAN PORTS AND MELBOURNE. SO THAI'S ABOUT $ 2 MILLION A W~ EEK TO KEET<br />THE TRANSPORT NEEDS OF TASMANIA. BUT MORE THAN THAT, AND I JUST WA T TO MAME<br />THIS POINT IN REGARD TO PARTICULARLY I GUESS THE PEOPLE OF NORTHERN TASPIANIA,<br />WHAT WE ARE DOING AS DISTINCT FROM THE OPPOSITION W1HO FOR YEARS AND YEARS<br />TALKED ABOUT THE PROBLEM OF THE EMPRESS OF AUSTRALIA. THEY IAI. KED AND ' TALKED,<br />WORDS ARE CHEAP WITH TH4E OPPOSITION PARTYO THAT'S THEIR STOCK, IN Tq1ADE,. AS<br />DISTINCT FROM1 WORDS WE ENGAGE IN ACTION AND WE PROVIDED $ 26 MiLL10.' s $ 26<br />MILLION AS A NON REPAYABLE GRANT TO TASMANIA TO ENABLE THEM TO PURCHASE , AND<br />MODIFY THAT OVERSEAS VESSEL, THE ' WILS HOLGERSSON' TO REPLACE TIIE. q-1PRESS OF<br />TASMANIA(?). NOW THAT'S A MILESTONE IN THIS AREA OF TRANSPORT. AS. I SAY THE<br />OPPOSITION IN GOVERNMENT FIDDLED AROUND WITH IT FOR YEARS AND DID OTHING.<br />AND WE'VE GIVEN TASMANIA THIS ENORfIOUS OPPORTUNITY TO DEVELOP Th,' E TOURIST TRADE.<br />NOW AGAINST WHAT WE'VE DON4E THERE, AND OUR VERY FIRM AND ACTION JUST ASK<br />YOU AND Y'OUR LISTENERS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE PROPOSALS OF THE OPPOITI'J ARE<br />AND THEIR ATTITUDE TO TASMANIANS AtID WH1AT THEY WOULD DO THEY'RE TALIUN13<br />ABOUT SELLING OFF. IF THEY W-ERE TO GET INTO PO. IER, THEY IIOULD SELL'OFF. 14ILD<br />JUST LIKE THAT. NO1Y1OWU JUST IMAGINE IIHAT THAT WOULD H4EAN TO TASHAsIA. BUT<br />YOU KNOW'., IT'S NOT VERY SURPRISINIC TO SEE THAT rHEV'D DO 0O. 1ETHIN1G LIKC nr4AT IN<br />THE TRANSPORT AREA BECAUSE, I JUST ASK YOU AND rHE LISTENERS TO GET: SO,, 1E<br />LULA U WHAT THE ATTITUDE OF THE OPPOSITION is TO TASMANIA, PARTICULARLY IN<br />THE TRANSPORT AREA. I'D LIKE TO, IF I COULD, TO READ OUT A QUESTIO1J THAT L! AS<br />PUT IN PARLIAMENT BY THE EXISTINIG SHADOW TRANSPORT FOR TRANSPORT,.. THAT's K<br />LUSHER. NOW. THIS ISWHAT HE ASKED ON THE 2ND CF APRIL 1081. IT VAS' A QUESTION<br />TO MR HOWJARD W-HO WAS THEN TREASURER.

THAT RE41LY<br />YOU SHOULD DENUDE TASMANIA... IF YOU CAN'T DO ' THAT, GIVE TASMANIA T. O vpEU<br />ZEALAND, ! MR HOWARD ' S RESPONSE QUOTE I THINK THAT THE BEST ANSWERi AN GIVE<br />TO THAT QUESTION IS TO SAY THAT I I-ILL ANALYSE IT THOROUGHLY." NOI) THAT's<br />THlE ATTITUDE OF,, THE LIBERALS TO TASMANIA. THE FELLOU W4HO WOULD 8CMI'IJSTER<br />FOR TRANSPORT IN THEIR GOVERNMENT WANTS TO GET RID OF TASMANI. A GIVE . IT TO NEU<br />ZEALAND AND TIlE DEPUTY LEADER OF TH E LIBERAL PARTY DOESN'T DISMXSS. ITJ[ TH<br />CONTEMPT, AS IT DESERVES,, BUT SAYS I WILL ANALYSE THE QUESTION THO.' OU HLY.<br />THERE'S YOUR CONTRAST. WHAT WE'VE DONE, WE'VE ACTED, WHERE THEY FiDOLED<br />AND TALKED IN REGARD TO A REPLACEMENT FOR THE EMPRESS OF AUSTRALIA $ 2 M1ILLION<br />A WEEK UNDER OUR GOVERNMENT FOR TASMANIA'S TRANSPORT NEED.

PEOPLEV SmA4 ~ 6U ISS<br />PEOPLE AROUND AUSTRALIA,, INCLUDINNG TAS1 -ANIA, WHO ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE FACT<br />THAT THEY'RE ALL PAYING HIGNER TAXES, THAT YOU WORK OVERTINME AND YQU* Effl UIP<br />LOSING 1HALF OR MORE TO TH4E GOVERNMENT. NO1W I K1NOW THAT YOU'RE CONOUCT .1. G1T A<br />REVIEW OF THE TAX SYSTEM AT THE MOMiENT. IS THERE ANYTIhING AT ALL ' flOATYVOU CAN<br />SAY SPECIFICALLY THAT CAN GIVE SOMBODY HOPE, THAT WE'RE NOT C. OINGGTO GE. T<br />TAXED<br />H{ AWKE:<br />WELL LET NE TALK ABOUT THE POSITION OF SMALL BUSINESS UNDER OUR GOVER~ iENT<br />CUMPARED TO OUR PREDECESSORS-GENERALLY AND THEN COME TO YOUR PmRiCULAR<br />POINT. THE BEST THING THAT CAN HAPPEN FOR SMALL BUSINESS IS THAT YOU HAVE A<br />GROWING ECOINO4, Y. NOW I ASK THE SMALL BUS1INESS [ MAN ORl WOMAN JUST To BE<br />TOTALLY OBJECTIVE AND ASK THEMSELVES HOWg1 THEY UERE DOING UNDER THE. PREVIOUS<br />GOVERN2-' ENT AND HO0W-THEY'RE DOING UNDER THIS ONE. UNDER THE PREVIOUS<br />GOVERNMENT THE AUSTRALIAN ECONONY VENT INTrO ITS W-. ORST RECESSION SICCE THE<br />GREAT DEPRESSION OF T14E 1930' S. YOU HAD THESE THINGS HAPPENING, ECOINC1.1C<br />GRO14TH HAD HALTED, YOU'D GOT INTO RECESS ION, eU HAD IN THE LAST ThLV o-mHs<br />A GROWTH IN UNEMPLOYMENT OF QUARTER OF A MILLIONo YOU HAD INFLATZON! AT DOUBLE<br />THE RATE, MORE TH4AN DOU BLE THE RATE OF T: hEP RESTr Or, THE INDUSTIALkSE D U11-1-<br />UHICH WE COM1PARE OURSELVES. AND YOU HAD RECORD HIG. H 11-TEREST RAfCS.

<p>GOVERNMENT. UNDER-MY GOVERNMENT, THAT'S BEEN TURNED ROUND-FROM ECON, 41IC<br />RECESSION TO THE POINT WHERE AUSTRALIA, THE LAST THELVE MONTHS UTIDKR IY<br />GOVERNMENT, HAD THE HIGHEST RATE OF ECONOMIC GROWTH IN THE WORLD,, THIE<br />CREATION OF MORE THAN A QUARTER OF A MILLION NEW JOBS, HALVING, MORE HAN<br />HALVING OF' THE INFLATION RATE* TO BRING IT BACK TO THE REST OF THE V1OR 0C AND<br />A REDUCTION IN INTEREST RATES. NOW THAT'S THE ENVIRONMENT UNDER 1tP1ICH, SM4ALL<br />BUSTNESS DOES VERY MUCH BETTER, AND IT HAS DOrE~ VERY tiUCII BETTER. tAS. IS<br />REFLECTED IN A WHOLE RANGE OF STATISTKCS. SO THAT'S THE FIRST POIUTr. N0ow,<br />SECONDLY, IN REGARD TO TAX, IT. IS THE CASE THAT UNDER THE LAST T11O BUDGETS,<br />OF THE CONSERVATIVES, THEY HAD TH4E RECORD HIGH TAX CAKE AS A PROPO RTION OF<br />THE COUNTRY'S PRODUCT, AND 14IGNER THAN IN OUR BUDGET, IN OUR LAST YNE, WHREN<br />YOU TAKE ACCOUNT OF THE MEDICARE EFFECT WHICH WAS JUST A TRANSFER FRO,'-WHtAT<br />PEOPLE WERE PAYING UNDER PRIVATE INSURANCE, NOW IF YOU TAKE THAT iNT-O ACCOUNT,<br />OURS WAS-LOW. IER IN PROPORTION TO THEIRS. NOW HHAT WE'VE PROUXSED NQ11-FOR THE<br />FUTURE IS AN OVERHAUL OF THE TAX SYSTEM. BUT HE'RE NOT WAITING F09 T1hAT<br />OVERHAUL. UITHIN A MATTER OF DAYS ALL. TAXPAYERS W-ILL GET A SUBSTAiJIAL REAL<br />TAX CUT IN THEIR PAY PACKETS. THEY'LL BE GETTING THAT. ON AVERAG!: T1* A WF-ILL.<br />BE EQUIVALENT TO AN $ 11 A WEEK WAGE INCREASE. IT I-ILL BE MUCH. ICS . INLTIN<br />THAN A WAGE INCREASE. NOW WE AREN'T HYPOTHESISING ABOUT rHE FUTURC. HIARD<br />REAL TAX CUTS NOW, IN A NON INFLATIONARY W-AYD UE'RE SAYING. TO THE. V USxcssS<br />COo: 4vUNITY AND TO THE PEOPLE OF AUSTRALIA THAT AFTER 84 YEARS AS A r D RAT IOND<br />THE TAX SYSTEM IS NOT PERFECT, SO WE WILL HAVE A REVIEVWJ NOT If-pO5j~ iG,* IT FRfO11<br />THE BACK ROiAS OF THE LIBERAL PARTY, AS WOULD BE TALKED ABOUT BY TOESE. PEOPLE0<br />NO CONSULTATION. LOOK AT ALL THE NEW TAXES THEY BROUGHT IN UHE( j Tf'EYj WERE INl<br />GOVERNMENT. DID THEY EVER TALK TO THE PEOPLE IN ADVANCE AND SAY9 IQE'LL IMPOSE<br />A $ 3 BILLION TAX SLUG ON YOU TH1ROUGH THE CRUDE OIL LEVY, DID THEY TALK TO THEN<br />ABOUT THE TAX ON NEWSBOY EARNINGS9 DID THEY TALK TO THEM ABOUT THE VAST<br />RANGE OF INCREASES IN SALES TAX?
