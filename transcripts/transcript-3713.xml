PRIME MINISTER'S INTERVIEW<br />
FOR CHANNEL 7 STATE FILE SPECIAL<br />
PERTH, SUNDAY, 20 APRIL, 1975<br />
Interviewer: Is it possible in the next two years to create<br />
a Socialist State in Australia having in mind this awful rate<br />
of inflation which confronts you?<br />
Mr. Whitlam: No. Even in the most favourable economic<br />
conditions and with a completely different Constitutional<br />
set-up, no, one couldn't.<br />
Interviewer: Then it follows, would you rather have come<br />
into Government at a different time than this awful time into<br />
which you have been plummeted?<br />
Mr. Whitlam: Oh sure, it's very bad luck that we have come<br />
into office just at a time when there are economic difficulties<br />
right around the world. Every country like us has the same<br />
sort of economic difficulties. That's bad luck. But at the<br />
same time it's your duty, obviously, to take office whenever<br />
the public drafts you to do so. So you can' * t just choose your<br />
time. You're in that game and you take it for better or for<br />
worse. Interviewer: It does seem Mr. Prime Minister, that you will<br />
be there for the full term this time. There has been a change<br />
as far as the Liberal/ Country Party coalition is concerned.<br />
Does that s urprise you? * 4<br />
Mr. Whitlam: As far as the Liberal Party is concerned.-I'm<br />
sure the Country Party still wants to pursue the old spoiling<br />
tactics of bringing about an election whenever it can do so.<br />
Interviewer: Do you see a change in tactics though as far<br />
as Mr. Fraser is concerned?<br />
Mr. Whitlam: Oh yO-s, very definitely.<br />
Interviewer: Does this surprise you?<br />
Mr. Whitlam: No, I thought he would be more rational or<br />
better conducted. I'm not wanting to say that Mr. Snedden<br />
wasn't well conducted himself although he was always getting<br />
up and saying something without being called 6~ y the Speaker<br />
and that sort of thing but his great error I think was to<br />
allow the Country Party to make a scene every day. Every day<br />
started off with disruption . Now Mr. Fraser, very sensibly,<br />
hasn't allowed that. </p>
<p>Interviewer: As far as the economy is concerned, Dr. Cairns<br />
has said that the Government deficit is expected to be<br />
$ 3,300 million by the end of the year and you've said in the<br />
dV House that you expect this to be reduced. How are you going<br />
to do it?<br />
Mr. Whitlam: I don't think it will be $ 3 billion it will be<br />
nearer $ 2 billion but what's caused the deficit of course has<br />
been the very large reductions in both personal income tax<br />
and company tax and also on motor cars, sales tax, which<br />
we've brought about. I know it's constantly asserted that the<br />
increase in the deficit is due to increased Government expenditure.<br />
It's not that. It's due to decreased Government revenue. We<br />
deliberately cut the taxes to spur the economy.<br />
Interviewer: But Mr. Whitlam, Medibank looks like being a<br />
certainty. It'Is going to go ahead on 1st July. Critics of<br />
Medibank will say that this is going to increase your deficit<br />
out of ; sight.<br />
Mr. Whitlam: N o, that's not so. After all, Government expenditures<br />
are not going to be any larger than they were previously<br />
for Medibank. There will now be Government expenditures in<br />
addition, where hitherto there has been expenditure by or through<br />
health funds. But the total amount being spent on health services<br />
will not ' increase. Surely itb a delusion to suggest that what<br />
you have to pay up till now to health funds is not a tax. Of<br />
course it's a tax. You don't get anything from the health funds.<br />
You don't get anything from the Government to meet your hospital<br />
or doctor's bills unless you contribute to funds. So sure they<br />
were voluntary funds but there was a compulsion. You got no<br />
assistance from the Government except through funds.<br />
Interviewer: But you aren't going to be allowed to levy special<br />
funds for Medibank.<br />
Mr. Whitlam: That's true. That's not our fault. The Senate<br />
twice knocked out the Bill which would have given a levy, I<br />
think it was 1.35% of your taxable income in order to finance<br />
the Government payment instead of the health fund payment towards<br />
those costs.*-<br />
Interviewer: So the money the people are paying now for private<br />
insurance won't necessarily go to the Government unless you<br />
increase taxes.<br />
Mr. Whitlam: There's an automatic increase so the reduction<br />
in taxes, the reduction in income taxes, will not be as great<br />
as it would have been because there will not be the levy for<br />
the specific purpose of health insurance through the Government<br />
that we propose. After all that's what I undertook at the last<br />
two Federal elections, but of course the Senate knocked that out. </p>
<p>So it has to come out of income tax directly instead of a<br />
health insurance levy.<br />
Interviewer: Do you expect the non-Labor States to join<br />
Medibank or be forced to join it?<br />
Mr. Whitlam: I think they will. It's true that South<br />
Australia and Tasmania will join as from the 1st of July.<br />
The other States I would expect will join later in the year<br />
and there is quite a good chance that Queensland, which has<br />
always had free public hospital treatment, will come into the<br />
joint funding, Commonwealth and State, of hospitals from the<br />
1st of July. When you talk about Medibank of course at the<br />
moment you are talking about the hospital aspect of Medibank.<br />
The medical aspect of Medibank, the doctor's bills, that will<br />
come in throughout Australia from the 1st of July whatever the<br />
States do but since the States conduct the hospitals, the<br />
hospital part of Medibank can only come in if the States<br />
co-operate. It will only come in in those States which do<br />
co-operate. All we are trying to do is do what was done in<br />
1947 make an agreement between the Commonwealth and States<br />
to share the cost of runninIg hospitals on condition that no<br />
charge is made for hospital treatment in the standard wards.<br />
That is, we are only wanting to do what was done 25 years ago.<br />
Menzies ended it in ' 51.<br />
Interviewer: It's not just Medibank which seems to be a<br />
problem and is a problem I'm sure for a lot of people,<br />
doctors especially.<br />
Mr. Whitlam: The sum total that we will pay either from t~ ces-from<br />
now on or up till now from taxes and compulsory contribution<br />
to funds, will be the same. The system will be simpler and<br />
more efficient in that generally, instead of having a dozen<br />
different funds, you will have one form of insurance.<br />
Interviewer: I would like to lead on from that if I mayto<br />
the beef industry, farmers up in arms'or miserable anyhow,<br />
and companies which are having to curtail their activities.<br />
Do you think it's fear yet in Australia that things are going<br />
to get out of hand, that money's got to come into Australia<br />
from somewhere?<br />
Mr. Whitlam: Money is in fact coming into Australia. The<br />
amount of money which has come in in Australia in the last<br />
six months or so is very high indeed.<br />
Interviewer: Will it save jobs?<br />
Mr. Whitlam: I think so, yes. Obviously most jobs in<br />
Australia, three-quarters of the jobs, are in the private<br />
sector and to have jobs in the private sector obviously the </p>
<p>private sector must be growing, it must have confidence to<br />
invest. It varies from one industry to another. There are<br />
-some industries in Australia which find it very difficult to<br />
compete with similar industries in other countries producing<br />
similar goods to those that we want to buy here. They're<br />
the cdnes that are in trouble.<br />
Interviewer: Can you predict the ones which are going to go?<br />
Mr. Whitlam: No, I don't. The industries which have found<br />
it tough in the last year are the ones which will never really<br />
in the future be the most thriving industries in Australia.<br />
Textiles and automobiles will not be, automobiles will not be<br />
the great growth industry in Australia in the next 20 years<br />
that they have been in the last 20 years. I think that is<br />
quite clear.-<br />
Interviewer: What about minerals?<br />
Mr. Whitlam: Minerals is going to boom.<br />
Interviewer: In the Government or in the private sector?<br />
Mr. Whitlam: All the minerals are in the private sector except<br />
uranium. All of them. But obviously, Governments have to accept<br />
some respon~ sibility and there has been a change since my Government<br />
took over in December, ' 72, in two respects. We do hiot believe<br />
that the National Government could just wash its hands of responsibility<br />
in two fields, where up till now, the State GoArnments<br />
did wash their hands of responsibility. One is, that we think<br />
our mineral resources should not continue to go into overseas<br />
control. Secondly, we think that the development of our-resources<br />
should pay regard to environmental factors. Now the only way<br />
that the Federal Government can exercise responsibility on<br />
minerals in the States, is in respect of export licences, and<br />
we don't give export licences for future-contracts unless there<br />
is a proper regard paid to Australian ownership and to environment.<br />
Interviewer: On the subject of uranium which you did bring up.<br />
Will any one nation get ' favoured nation' treatment when Australia<br />
decides to export uranium?<br />
Mr. Whitlam: No, obviously there are some-countries with which<br />
we already have an understanding, such as Japan, but the other<br />
countries which are interested, all the E. E. C. countries are<br />
interested and Iran is interested, there will be no favouritism<br />
between them We will obviously be interest6d in having<br />
propositions from them, mainly in order to see that we in<br />
Australia can enrich the uranium. We have known for 20 years<br />
how to produce the yellow cake, the powder, we have done that<br />
back in the ' 50' s in Batchelor, Rum Jungle and Mary Kathleen, </p>
<p>but we don't know how to enrich uranium. And that's what<br />
we want to learn.<br />
Interviewer: Will there be enough money, briefly,, coming<br />
in from uranium to enable the high standard of living in<br />
Australia to continue?<br />
Mr. Whitlam: I don't say from uranium only. Clearly I<br />
think we can be quite confident that there will be as much<br />
coming in from uranium in the future as there has been from<br />
wool in the past.<br />
Interviewer: The standard of living. Ought we in Australia,<br />
because of the standard of living is so high, be afraid of<br />
what's happening in Indo-China tonight?<br />
Mr. Whitlam: No. I suppose you're referring to the fact<br />
that in Indo-Chinia Governments are being changed but I think<br />
it is quite fantastic to suggest that any Government in Indo-<br />
China can attack Australia. Such a proposition wouldn't be<br />
accepted anywhere else in the world. I don't think it will<br />
be accepted in Australia.<br />
Interviewer: When you were Leader of the Opposition you were<br />
very keen on what you said was open Government and a lot of<br />
people questioned your decision not to table the cables that<br />
you sent to Hanoi and Saigon which were supposedly identical.'<br />
Mr. Whitlam: I quoted what Mr. Fraser himself had said ir 2<br />
that matter and quite properly, that the communications between<br />
Governments are never released because if they are, then you<br />
cease to be able to negotiate with other Governments. That is,<br />
it's never done.<br />
Interviewer: I find it difficult to understand though, why<br />
shouldn't it be done?<br />
Mr. Whitlan: I think all Governments take the attitude, when<br />
they are dealing with things that concern them, international<br />
affairs, the only effective way to deal with them is on a<br />
confidential basis. You just don't get any Government in the<br />
world releasing the cables-that it sends to other Governments<br />
or that other Governments send to it. It just doesn't happen.<br />
Incidentally the particular one in which Mr. Fraser stated that<br />
he wouldn't release the cable or the communications, it appears<br />
that no communication was sent. I'm checking on that. That<br />
was the original communication sent by the Prime Minister of<br />
South Vietnam exactly 10 years ago this month to Sir Robert<br />
Menzies, ostensibly to ask us to come and assist militarily<br />
in Indo-China. I haven't been able to find it. </p>
<p>Interviewer: As far as South Vietnam is concerned, your<br />
Government was very quick to recognise the new Government<br />
in Cambodia. If the Thieu Government falls, what will be<br />
your attitude?<br />
Mr. Whitlan: Whatever Government takes over and presumably<br />
it would be the we would of course recognise it.<br />
I have said all along and it's the general practice through<br />
the world that you recognise the Government, that is you have<br />
diplomatic relations with the Government which has control of<br />
the capital of a country. The alternative is to recognise<br />
a Government which no longer controls-the capital of the country.<br />
Interviewer: If such a thing occurs though, will you give<br />
consideration to the position of South Vietnamese refugees<br />
coming to Australia?<br />
Mr. Whitlam: We have already. As you know we have already<br />
said that the students can stay until things settle down at<br />
home and secondly, we have brought quite a number of orphans,<br />
that is little kids whom the South Vietnamese Government said<br />
were eligible to leave the country and whom the State Governments<br />
said had approved adoptive parents.<br />
Interviewer: That displays our new attitude in Australia of<br />
humanitarianism and being rational, sensible in foreign affairs.<br />
How do you respond to that criticism which, sounds awful to you<br />
I know, that we are being naive because that with the-~ new<br />
Government in Phnom Penh we hear this weekend that they have<br />
chopped their enemies heads off.<br />
Mr. Whitlam: Well wait a bit. They didn't say whom they had<br />
executed but there were seven people, that is the heads of the<br />
new regime that took over in the last week. There were seven<br />
people, they didn't say which ones they had got.<br />
Interviewer: They did name them beforehand didn't they?<br />
Mr. Whitlam: Oh yes, but I don't know which ones they had got.<br />
There were seven people, don't let us exaggerate<br />
Interviewer: Would you be angry about that?.<br />
Mr. Whitlam: I think they ought to show magnanimity in these<br />
matters. </p>
<p>Interviewer: And taking that a stage further<br />
Mr. Whitlam: and I have conveyed that view.<br />
Interviewer: This humanitarian line which we take in Australia,<br />
doesn't that leave us defenceless?'<br />
Mr. Whitlam: Are you suggesting that Indo-China, any of the<br />
countries in Indo-China could attack us?<br />
Interviewer: No, the other way around. Suppose you were<br />
angry and the Government was angry at what was going on up<br />
there, have we got anybody to send. I'm leading in to defence<br />
of course.<br />
Mr. Whitlan: Should we send troops? I thi'k it is absolutely<br />
unlikely that Australian soldiers will be sent to Indo-China<br />
again, ever. Let me point out that there is nobody in the<br />
Federal Parliament who has suggested that. No, wait a minute,<br />
there was one man, a Country Party member who was a Colonel up<br />
there, but he is the only one who has suggested it. I don't<br />
think I can usefully spend my time with you-answering suggestions<br />
that no elected person is prepared to make. There are no forces<br />
in the whole of Indo-China that have an aircraft, or a ship or<br />
a missile that could reach Australia and there is no prospect<br />
of anybody supplying them with aircraft, or ships, or missiles<br />
which could reach Australia<br />
Interviewer: I think that we are trying to get at here th~ at<br />
a lot of your critics have said that you are leaving Australia<br />
defenceless, in the sense that we are not building up our own<br />
forces. Interviewer: I am suggesting that if we were in a position<br />
where we wanted to act on behalf of a minority group or a group<br />
anywhere in the world, would we do it?<br />
Mr. Whitlam: We are prepared to send troops, we have them<br />
set aside., We have had them set aside for nearly a year now,<br />
to respond to any United Nations appeal for troops, and our<br />
armed forces are the best for thousands and thousands of miles<br />
around. There is no navy, no airforce, no army which could<br />
compete with ours. Sure, if you were competing militarily on<br />
the land in South East Asia, we couldn't, our army couldn't.<br />
But there's no army that could get to Australia and there's<br />
no navy or airforce within thousands of miles of Australia<br />
which could compete with us. </p>
<p>Interviewer: We would work with United Nations then?<br />
dr Mr. Whitlam: Yes, but even if we are alone.<br />
Interviewer: With the Americans?<br />
Mr. Whitlam: Yes, we have arrangements with the Americans.<br />
There are facilities here which are of very great value to<br />
the Americans. But quite apart from that, let's be clear<br />
about this, there is no airforce within thousands and thousands<br />
of miles of Australia which could compete with the R. A. A. F.<br />
There is no navy within thousands and thousands of miles of<br />
Australia which could compete with the R. A. N. and there are<br />
no armed forces which could land in Australia which the<br />
Australian Army gouldn't promptly eliminate.<br />
Interviewer: On the Western Seaboard then of Australia, ought<br />
we to be concerned about Russian activity in the Indian Ocean?<br />
You want to keep it peaceful?<br />
Mr. Whitlam: Yes, we ought to be concerned about the possibility<br />
of the Soviet and the U. S. competing with each other in the<br />
Indian Ocean because none of the countries around the Indian<br />
Ocean want this competition to come about, still less to escalate.<br />
Interviewer:. Is there a balance there at the moment, d1o you know?<br />
Mr. Whitlam: Yes, there seems to be.<br />
Interviewer: And does this affect our relationship with South<br />
Africa? It is suggested this week-end that we might be severing<br />
a link with the Republic of South Africa.<br />
Mr. Whitlam: Well certainly there are no military links with<br />
South Africa whatever. I don't suppose anybody is going to<br />
suggest it. Now there is speculation about whether we should<br />
have Qantas going to Johannesburg but these things haven't been<br />
decided. In any case a year's notice has to be given.<br />
Interviewer: Still on an aerial basis, there have been from time<br />
to time, many reports of Russian submarines ' in the Indian Ocean.<br />
One takes these on face value, they must be correct, but will<br />
the Government give consideration to basing a maritime reconnaissance<br />
squadron in Western Australia? There was one opice here in 1951,<br />
but since then nothing. </p>
<p>Mr. Whitlam: Well the facilities for surveillance of the<br />
Indian Ocean are better than they ever were. For instance,<br />
the airfield at Learmonth will now take any aircraft in<br />
the world.<br />
Interviewer: But they have to come from the Eastern States<br />
to get to here.<br />
Mr. Whitlan: Oh sure, but all the things that need to be<br />
there permanently have, under my Government, been immensely<br />
improved. You don't advertise these things but I suppose<br />
everybody knows how long the airfield is. It is as long as<br />
pretty well any airfield in the world. It will take any service<br />
aircraft which operates anywhere in the world and we are getting<br />
more maritime reconnaissance aircraft.<br />
Interviewer: We haven't made up our mind yet what we are<br />
going to get?<br />
Mr. Whitlam: No, but it's-going to be the Nimrod or the Orion,<br />
that is the military version of the Comet or the military version<br />
of the Electra.<br />
Interviewer: Travel, trips. A lot of critics say you spend<br />
far too much time out of Australia.<br />
Mr. Whitlam: That is no longer said. There was a tlarrific<br />
campaign of course last December and January about this but<br />
I think the critics have been suitably chastened since. 4<br />
Interviewer: You are off again soon.<br />
Mr. Whitlam: Yes, of course I am. I'm leaving next Wednesday to go<br />
to the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting in the Carribean,<br />
Kingston the capital of Jamaica and surely nobody is going to<br />
criticise an Australian Prime Minister going to a Commonwealth<br />
Heads of Government meeting. After all there are 34 countries in<br />
the Commonwealth and most of them are round the Indian Ocean or<br />
in the South Pacific. It is the most important forum to which<br />
Australia can belong.<br />
Interviewer: The Minister for Foreign Affairs will be away..<br />
Mr. Whitlam: He is attending the ANZUS meeting this coming<br />
week, and surely it's not going to be suggested that Senator<br />
Willessee, the Foreign Minister, shouldn't attend ANZUS. </p>
<p>Interviewer: The three top men of the nation will be away.<br />
Mr. Whitlam: Yes, Dr. Cairns is going to the Asian Development<br />
Bank meeting in Manil.. The Treasurer always has attended the<br />
meetings of the Asian Development Bank since it was established.<br />
Now surely nobody is going to suggest that we shouldn't be<br />
represented by the appropriate Minister at each of these gatherings.<br />
We have always been represented at the Commonwealth Heads of<br />
Government meeting, always by the Prime Minister except in<br />
Menzies time when there was a meeting in Nigeria so we sent an<br />
Ambassador and at the Asian Development Bank and at ANZUS.<br />
Australians expect us to be represented at these bodies and<br />
to be represented by the appropriate Minister.<br />
Interviewer: It is an unfortunate co-incidence that this should<br />
happen at this time.<br />
Mr. Whitiam: Well the Parliament won't be sitting the two weeks<br />
after this coming one, so it will be properly manned and<br />
Mr. Connor, a formidable character, a very competent character,<br />
will be Acting Prime Minister in a week's time.<br />
Interviewer: I don't want to cast any slurs in this at all, but<br />
I remember distinctly asking Mr. Gorton if there would ever. be<br />
a chance, when he was Prime Minister, that this country would be<br />
a sort of Switzerland or Sweden, a neutral country as a catalyst<br />
in the world to bring the nations together. Do you see that?<br />
Mr. Whitlam: No, we aren't a neutral country, we aren't a no<br />
aligned country, but very obviously we have to understand the<br />
point of view of countries which are not aligned since, I think<br />
this is right,-every country around the Indian Ocean and most of<br />
those in the South Pacific, are non-aligned. Where would be the<br />
nearest aligned country to Australia? Japan I would think would<br />
be the only one. You couldn't regard Singapore or Malaysia as<br />
aligned now, that is, everybody in our region is non-al igned<br />
except Australia and New Zealand and Japan..<br />
Interviewer: TPhe latest opinion poll says that if we went to<br />
the polls again tomorzrow, that you would lose Government.<br />
Mr. Whitlam: I don't comment on polls, but I'm certain of this;<br />
tjiat when there is an election campaign and people have to express<br />
their views on which of the parties they would like to form a<br />
Government, they will chose the Labor Party. I have no doubt<br />
that when it's just not a case of ' expressing dis-satisfaction<br />
with the Government-and I don't know of an over-whelmingly popular<br />
Government in any developed nation in the world niow. All the<br />
O. E. C. D. countries, the sort of countries like us, Japan, Western<br />
Europe, Northern America, Australia and New Zealand, the Government<br />
comes in for a colossal amount of criticism but when there is an<br />
election campaign and people have to face up to the question </p>
<p>11.<br />
Would the alternative be better than what we have had?<br />
I've no doubt that they will choose us again.<br />
Interviewer: As far as State relations are concerned, the<br />
Premier here, Sir Charles Court has often called your Government<br />
an obstructionist government, now how can you convey to him or<br />
establish a better rapport between Western Australia and Canberra?<br />
Mr. Whitlam: When Sir Charles and I get together we are perfectly<br />
civil, courteous.<br />
Interviewer: Yes, he has even said that.<br />
Mr. Whitlam: Ihave no personal arguments with Sir Charles Court,<br />
as a matter of fact I'll be going to the airport with him after<br />
this, but I must say that I get a bit disturbed at the fact that<br />
outside the country he spends just as much time abusing the<br />
Australian Government as promoting the Western Australian<br />
Government and this is just not done and I don't think it helps<br />
him nor the country overseas.<br />
Interviewer: Isn't this an easy out for any non-Labor Premier,<br />
to blame the Federal Government for anything that goes wrong?<br />
Mr. Whitlam: Yes, but it's not done and it's not effective if<br />
you do it outside the country. I made a very great number of<br />
visits overseas when I was Leader of the Opposition. I had<br />
very serious disagreements with the Australian Government a4%~<br />
the time but you don't remember that I bucketed the Australian<br />
Government when I was away. Billy Snedden, I'm sad to say, did<br />
do so when he was in the United States over Christmas. I don't<br />
think it does you any good. People in another country look askance<br />
when you criticise the Government of your own country. They know<br />
that you have disagreements with it if you are in the Opposition<br />
but they don't expect for you to disparage it.<br />
Interviewer: But isn't this because of the anxiety of the<br />
Opposition if you like, of the free, private sector, that there<br />
will be less and less money coming into Australia?<br />
Mr. Whitlam: Whatever the reason for it, there is no justification<br />
for it. The money coming into Australia in ' recent months has<br />
been very great indeed. Our balance of payments, whether it is<br />
the flow of money or the sale of-goods, is very favourable. </p>
<p>12.<br />
Interviewer: What promise would you make to the electorate<br />
looking at an election two hears hence of course If you<br />
were in that situation now, what are the goods things Australia<br />
can look forward to?<br />
Mr. Whitlam: To take the particular angle you have, I believe<br />
that in two year's time, we will have seen very much more recognition<br />
in Australia and overseas, that Australians should determine the<br />
pattern of control and development of their resources. That's<br />
where we camne in. We said it was not satisfactory that all these<br />
mineral resources which had been discovered in Western Australia<br />
and in Queensland in the 19601s, should be progressively passing<br />
under foreign control. Now there are a great number of Liberals<br />
agree with our attitude on this. John Gorton certainly did. He<br />
was right in my view..<br />
Interviewer: Whiat percentage say can you allow the Japanese<br />
trading.-partners to have in companies? You can't really have<br />
100% Australian ownership.<br />
Mr. Whitlam: We think we c an in some things, such as uranium<br />
aid this would be the general attitude around the world. Although<br />
I think uranium, for various economic and strategic reasons, is<br />
regarded as a substance which the National Government should<br />
regulate single-handed.<br />
Interviewer: What about ironi ore and oil?<br />
Mr. Whitlam: As long as there is a preponderant Australian<br />
control, that is satisfactory.<br />
Interviewer: Is that 51%,<br />
Mr. Whitlam: 51% I would think. Control can be achieved without<br />
ownership but the point is from now on we-ought to get the<br />
percentage up instead of letting it go down. We have had<br />
preponderaat overseas control and ownership for our iron ore<br />
and for our-Queensland coal and for our bauxite.<br />
Interviewer: This would make a higher standard of living then,<br />
because all that money which has gone abroad will stay here?<br />
Mr. Whitlam: Yes, most of it. </p>
<p>13.<br />
Interviewer: Makes you wonder what you would do with it.<br />
, Mr. Whitlam: There are plenty of things for us to do with<br />
capital in Australia, but what we need to do of course, is<br />
to concentrate on those things where we are strong and we<br />
are strong in mfinerals. This is the sort of thing where<br />
Australia ought to be marshalling her capital and skills<br />
from now on. There are some things in which we are very<br />
fortunate, where we are superbly equipped. There are some<br />
others where we are no better than any other country. The<br />
sensible thing is to concentrate on those things where you<br />
are fortunate or strong.<br />
Interviewer: Unemployment worries ' a lot of people. Does<br />
your Government seek the situation of full employment or<br />
can you see a reasonable level of unemployment?<br />
Mr. Whitlam: Obviously we are very dissatisfied with the<br />
number of people who have asked for jobs and can't get them<br />
at the moment. Now, what is regarded as a reasonable level of<br />
unemployment is a matter of--discussion but the present one is<br />
obviously too high. We haven't been used to it in Australia.<br />
It's no worse and even better than you get in North America<br />
or in many parts of Europe but that doesn't give you any<br />
satisfaction. It is coming down.<br />
Interviewer: We won't have to wait for two years before it<br />
gets better?<br />
Mr. Whitlam: It's got very much better in the last month<br />
and I think it will continue to get better over the coming<br />
months. Interviewer: Can you put a date on it? Would you say three<br />
months, six months?<br />
Mr. Whitlam: Well every one of those months, the number of<br />
people seeking jobs will go down. I have no doubt of that at all.<br />
Interviewer: You haven't got your fingres crossed.<br />
Mr. Whitlam: Oh no, I'm open-handed. </p>
