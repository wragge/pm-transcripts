FOR PRESSP. M. 59L19<br />
FORESTRY EDUCATION PT THE AUSTRALIAkN NATIONAL<br />
UNIVERSITY<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon. Sir Robert Menzies<br />
The Prime Minister, Sir Robert Menzies, announced<br />
today that the Government, following agreement with the<br />
Australian National University, has approved that the functions<br />
of the Australian Forestry School will be carried out by the<br />
Australian National University.<br />
The Australian National University will establish a<br />
Department of Forestry in the Faculty of Science of the School<br />
of General Studies. The Department will teach all years of a<br />
four-year forestry degree course for its own students and will,<br />
by arrangement with State universities accept students for the<br />
final two years of the course who havecompleted the first two<br />
years of an approved course in any Qf those universities. It<br />
will also engage in research and post-graduate training. The<br />
Australian National University will establish a body to advise<br />
the Faculty of Science on the professional aspects of forestry<br />
education which will include in its membership the heads of<br />
forest services of the participating States and other persons<br />
knowledgeable of forestry education and the forestry profession.<br />
The Univerwity has advertised for a professor who will<br />
be head of a department of forestry. It is hoped that an appointment<br />
can be made before the beginning of the 1965 University<br />
session. Arrangements for the University to take over the<br />
functions cf the School will be put in hand immediately, but<br />
the University does not wish to make firm decisions en the<br />
development ef forestry education before a prrfessor of forestry<br />
has been appointed. The existing teaching and supporting technioal nad<br />
clerical staff cf the Australian Forestry School will be offered<br />
appointments at the appropriate level in the School of General<br />
Studies at the University. The physical plant and equipment of<br />
the Forestry School will be transferred to the University, and<br />
for the period of three years at least the Univereity will use<br />
the teaching and residential buildings at present used by the<br />
Fcrestry School at Yarralumla, Canberra.<br />
CANBERRA, 2nd August, 1964.<br />
BACKGROUND The Australian Forestry Sohool is a branch of the<br />
Forestry and Timber Burea, which is now a Division of the<br />
Department of National Development. It was founded by the<br />
Commonwealth Government in 1925 at the request of the Premiers<br />
of the States to provide a National centre for higher forestry<br />
education. It replaced the Forestry Sehool at the University of<br />
Adelaide, which University provided the only Australian degree<br />
course in forestry from 1911 to 1925. The University 4f Adelaide<br />
generously consented to transfer this function to the Commonwealth<br />
Government. / 2 </p>
<p>2-<br />
The Forestry School gives the third and fourth years<br />
of a four-year course in forestry. Students accepted at the<br />
School must have completed at least two years of basic science<br />
training at one of the State universities, or have an equivalent<br />
background. Each of the older State Universities makes use of<br />
the School to give the third and fourth years of their fouryear<br />
degree course in forestry. Students who complete the<br />
course are awarded a degree in forestry from their home university<br />
and also a Diploma in Forestry by the Commonwealth<br />
Government. Since the establishment of the School of General<br />
Studies within the Australian National University, Commonwealth<br />
and State Governments have thought it appropriate that the<br />
functions cf School should be associated with the University.<br />
The Australian Forestry bohool has gained a signifioant<br />
reputation throughout the world and forestry is widely accepted<br />
as a suitable academic subject in many of the world universities.<br />
Discussions with the State Governments have shown that all of<br />
them except Victoria are prepared to make use of the Department<br />
of Forestry in the Australian National University to meet their<br />
needs for a basic degree in forestry for their Forest Service<br />
officers at least until 1969. It is understood that in Victoria<br />
the practice will continue that some officers &amp; f the State Forest<br />
Service will crmplete a forestry degree by a course at the<br />
University of M: 1elbourne after completing their course at the<br />
Victoriam School of Forestry, Creswick. </p>
