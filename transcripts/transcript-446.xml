<p>Joint Statement by the Prime Minister ( Mr. Menzies) Deputy<br />Prime Minister ( Mx Mce) an Prelier ( Mr, Nicklin)</p>
<p>The Prime Minister and Mr. John McEwen this afternoon had a most valuable discussion with the Premier and the members of his Cabinet.</p>
<p>As the Commonwealth Government, like the State Government of Queensland, is made up of both Liberal Party and Country Party Ministers, the discussions represented what might<br />be fairly described as a " family" political conference. Various<br />matters which have been under discussion in the past were<br />clarified by the exchanges, to a genuine mutual satisf~ action.<br />The Prime Minister made it clear that the<br />Commonwealth Government, being determined to make an early and<br />substantial reduction in unemployment was not proposing to<br />delay action until the meeting of Parliament. On the 3-ontrary,<br />it would announce some urgent decisions at the earliest possRble<br />moment after the cnclusion of its industry consultations next<br />week. Long range measures are already under examination but<br />this is not to prejudice or postpone short-term measures.<br />Queensland Ministers put several views of great<br />importance. One was that 1960, though it was a boom year for<br />most of Australia, was not one in Queensland; and that<br />Queensland had in consequence been more affected than other<br />States by the impact of the anti-inflationary measures taken by<br />the Commonwealth. One of the results of this, they said, was<br />that at present unemployment is much more serious in Queensland<br />than in any other State. Ways and means of making a quick<br />impact upon unemployment, particularly in the centres most<br />affected, were discussed and several constructive pr-oposals<br />were made by Queensland Ministers. These will be conveyed to<br />CommonwealtL-h Ministers by the Prime Minister and Mr. McEwjen and<br />will be examined. In addition to what have been referred to as " shortterm"<br />measures, action was taken to look at the longer term<br />development of the industrial potential of Queensland,<br />partiai larly in relation to the providing of employment and the<br />earning of export income. It was agreed that both the need and<br />the opportunity exist, but that Parther detailed talks are<br />needed before ultimate conclusions can be arrived at.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister said that he would facilitate  early visits or conferences by the Treasurer ( Mr. Hoolt), the Minister for National Development ( Senator Spooner) and the Minister for Shipping and Transport ( Mr. Opperman), In addition of course Queensland Commonwealth Ministers, Messrs Davidson, Adermann and Swartz will be available for frequent consultations.<br />" We all thought our discussions were invaluable", said Mr. Menzies and Mr. Nicklin after the meeting,.~! believe that<br />we have established a splendid basis for co-operation in the<br />interests not only of Queensland as a political unit but of the great actual and potential Australian resources which lie within the boundaries of this State. It is unreasonable to suppose<br />that every suggestion made hereafter can be accepted by one side or the other, but we are quite satisfied that we ! iave taken steps to eliminate misunderstandings arnd to enable each of us to help<br />the other in our cormcon tasks. The immediate task is to restore confidence, whicth is tthe vital, condition of renewed prosperity".</p>
<p>BRISBANE<br />26th January, 1962,</p>
