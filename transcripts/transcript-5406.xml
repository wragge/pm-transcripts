Tonight I would like to mnentionI some of the important initiatives<br />
the Government has taken recently in Immigration and Ethnic Affairs.<br />
On the one hand, there is a need to maintain a strong and viable<br />
Immigration programme which meet Australia's needs for skilled<br />
manpower and satisfies the desires of existing residents to be<br />
re-united with members of their families.<br />
But we also need to ensure that this inflow of migrants . is<br />
controlled in fairness, both to those seeking entry to Australia<br />
and to our residents. Our recent initiatives have sought to<br />
reconcile both these objectives.<br />
We are making it easier for relatives and friends of Australia<br />
to migrate if they are assured of support here; this is being<br />
done through a relaxation of our migrant entry requirements<br />
announced by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs,<br />
Ian Macphee in May this year.<br />
At the same time, we are. taking action to curb future illegal<br />
immigration by removing its principal incentive the possibility<br />
of later obtaining the right of legal permanent residence here.<br />
In deciding on these initiatives the Government had to face the<br />
fact that Australia already has many thousands of illegal<br />
immigrants.<br />
Their numbers have been building up over a period of years but'<br />
particularly since the " easy visa system"' for tourists was<br />
introduced in 1973.<br />
This. system was widely abused and was later abandoned.<br />
But, for course, by then many illegal migrants were already<br />
here. No-one could realistically suggest that we should seek out,<br />
detain and deport every illegal immigrant in Australia.<br />
Many have been here for some years and have established themselves<br />
successfully. / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
others have close family ties which cannot be ignored.<br />
At the same time the Government believes that people who were<br />
here legally, but temporarily should not be treated less<br />
favourably than those who were here illegally.<br />
Anyone who arrived in Australia before 1 January 1980, whether<br />
legally or illegally, is eligible to apply under what is<br />
called the " regularisation of status programme" and will be<br />
approved unless he or she has serious health or character<br />
problems. I am pleased to say that the English language and ethnic media<br />
press, radio and television have given strong editorial<br />
and other support to the programme.<br />
Ethnic community leaders have also lent their weight.<br />
By last week, just over a month since the date that the<br />
programme was announced, more than 11,500 enquiries and<br />
5,000 applications had already been made to the Department<br />
of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs.<br />
This is an excellent response and, as the opportunity to apply<br />
remains open until 31 December this year, it gives every<br />
indication of being a most successfull initiative.<br />
Reaching people who are eligible to apply is a very complex<br />
task and it requires the fullest possible support from other<br />
sections of the community.<br />
Even when they learn about the opportunity to become legal<br />
permanent residents, many of these people are afraid to come<br />
forward because they fear that, in some way, it may be a trap<br />
to lure them into the open so that they can be seized, gaoled<br />
and deported.<br />
For these people I have a simple, direct message: this is not<br />
a trap.<br />
The Government is not engaged on some sort of massive deportation<br />
exercise. This would be neither effective nor just.<br />
Indeed, the Australian community would be outraged if any<br />
government attempted deception of that kind.<br />
The first person illegally living in Australia to come forward<br />
was-a young Greek girl living in Goulburn, New South Wales,<br />
Jenny Giannopoulos.<br />
You may have seen television interviews with her on the day<br />
when she was told she was approved. / 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
Her relief and happiness were apparent as was her concern<br />
to encourage others, by her example, to come forward.<br />
Many have already done so and I hope that many more will<br />
follow.<br />
The programme is not just something of beneift to persons<br />
illegally in Australia.<br />
People who were here legally can also benefit from it.<br />
T am particularly pleased, therefore, that one of the greatest<br />
sportsmen of all time, a man whose name is a household word in<br />
this country as it is in his homeland, the West Indies, has<br />
agreed to place his own considerable personal prestige bEhind<br />
the programme.<br />
I refer to Sir Garfield Sobers who has become the first . person<br />
legally in this country approved under the new arrangements.<br />
Between the young Greek girl illegally here and the distinguished<br />
international sportsman, there are many thousands of other<br />
cases each of which would be a story in itself.<br />
The Government is determined to legalise their status as<br />
quickly and as simply as possible unless there are very grave<br />
reasons indeed for not doing so.<br />
In fact, no case will be rejected until my colleague, the<br />
Minister for Immigrationaid Ethnic Affair has personally<br />
considered all the circumstances of the case.<br />
I also want particularly to stress that from the moment -they<br />
are granted permanent residence under the programme, people have<br />
the same rights as any other resident of Australia.<br />
They will have the same right to sponsor relatives and friends.<br />
They will have the same right, after three years' legal residence<br />
here, to apply for Australian citizenship.<br />
They will have the same rights and access to the post-arrival<br />
settlement services which we have been developing and extending<br />
to assist-newcomers.<br />
The task of settling people in this country is not complete when<br />
a migrant arrives or when someone is granted change of status;<br />
this is only the beginning.<br />
We have introduced, extended and improved a wide range-c'f<br />
settlement services for migrants in order to help resolve the<br />
problems inevitable in making one's way in a new country and<br />
to reinforce their prospects of success economically, socially<br />
and culturally.<br />
This action flows from the Galbally Report which we commissioned,<br />
accepted in full and implemented promptly and effectivel. y. </p>
<p>-4-<br />
But I turn again, as one must, from these broader national<br />
purposes to the individuals'who have lived and are living<br />
among us in unnecessary apprehension because they have entered<br />
here illegally or failed to leave when their visas expired.<br />
I urge them to come forward. Ltk-~ F1 i~ S--s-</p>
